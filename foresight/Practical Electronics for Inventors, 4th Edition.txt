PREFACE
Inventors in the field of electronics are individuals who possess the knowledge, intu-
ition, creativity, and technical know-how to turn their ideas into real-life electrical 
gadgets. We hope that this book will provide you with an intuitive understanding of 
the theoretical and practical aspects of electronics in a way that fuels your creativity.
This book is designed to help beginning inventors invent. It assumes little to no 
prior knowledge of electronics. Therefore, educators, students, and aspiring hobby-
ists will find this book a good initial text. At the same time, technicians and more 
advanced hobbyists may find this book a useful resource.
Notes about the Fourth Edition
The main addition to the fourth edition is a new chapter on programmable logic. This 
chapter focuses on the use of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) and shows 
you how to program an FPGA evaluation board using both a schematic editor and 
the Verilog hardware definition language.
The book has also undergone numerous minor updates and fixes to errors discov-
ered in the third edition. In addition, there has been some pruning of outdated mate-
rial that is no longer relevant to modern electronics.

Practical Electronics  
for Inventors


1
Perhaps the most common predicament newcomers face when learning electronics is 
figuring out exactly what it is they must learn. What topics are worth covering, and in 
which general order should they be covered? A good starting point for answering these 
questions is the flowchart presented in Fig. 1.1. This chart provides an overview of the 
basic elements that go into designing practical electrical gadgets and represents the 
information you will find in this book. This chapter introduces these basic elements.
At the top of the chart comes the theory. This involves learning about voltage, 
current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, and various laws and theorems that help 
predict the size and direction of voltages and currents within circuits. As you learn 
the basic theory, you will be introduced to basic passive components such as resis-
tors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.
Next down the line are discrete passive circuits. Discrete passive circuits include 
current-limiting networks, voltage dividers, filter circuits, attenuators, and so on. 
These simple circuits, by themselves, are not very interesting, but they are vital ingre-
dients in more complex circuits.
After you have learned about passive components and circuits, you move on to 
discrete active devices, which are built from semiconductor materials. These devices 
consist mainly of diodes (one-way current-flow gates) and transistors (electrically 
controlled switches/amplifiers).
Once you have covered the discrete active devices, you get to discrete active/
passive circuits. Some of these circuits include rectifiers (ac-to-dc converters), ampli-
fiers, oscillators, modulators, mixers, and voltage regulators. This is where things 
start getting interesting.
Throughout your study of electronics, you will learn about various input/output 
(I/O) devices (transducers). Input devices (sensors) convert physical signals, such as 
sound, light, and pressure, into electrical signals that circuits can use. These devices 
include microphones, phototransistors, switches, keyboards, thermistors, strain 
gauges, generators, and antennas. Output devices convert electrical signals into 
physical signals. Output devices include lamps, LED and LCD displays, speakers, 
buzzers, motors (dc, servo, and stepper), solenoids, and antennas. These I/O devices 
allow humans and circuits to communicate with one another.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Electronics    3
To make things easier on the circuit designer, manufacturers have created inte-
grated circuits (ICs), which contain discrete circuits (like the ones mentioned in the 
previous paragraph) that are crammed onto a tiny chip of silicon. The chip is usually 
housed within a plastic package, where little internal wires link the chip to exter-
nal metal terminals. ICs such as amplifiers and voltage regulators are referred to 
as analog devices, which means that they respond to and produce signals of vary-
ing degrees of voltage. (This is unlike digital ICs, which work with only two voltage 
levels.) Becoming familiar with ICs is a necessity for any practical circuit designer.
Digital electronics comes next. Digital circuits work with only two voltage states: 
high (such as 5 V) or low (such as 0 V). The reason for having only two voltage states 
has to do with the ease of processing data (numbers, symbols, and control informa-
tion) and storage. The process of encoding information into signals that digital cir-
cuits can use involves combining bits (1s and 0s, equivalent to high and low voltages) 
into discrete-meaning “words.” The designer dictates what these words will mean to 
a specific circuit. Unlike analog electronics, digital electronics uses a whole new set of 
components, which at the heart are all integrated in form. 
A huge number of specialized ICs are used in digital electronics. Some of these ICs 
are designed to perform logical operations on input information; others are designed 
to count; while still others are designed to store information that can be retrieved 
later on. Digital ICs include logic gates, flip-flops, shift registers, counters, memo-
ries, processors, and so on. Digital circuits are what give electrical gadgets “brains.” 
In order for digital circuits to interact with analog circuits, special analog-to-digital 
(A/D) conversion circuits are needed to convert analog signals into strings of 1s and 
0s. Likewise, digital-to-analog conversion circuits are used to convert strings of 1s 
and 0s into analog signals.
With an understanding of the principals behind digital electronics, we are free to 
explore the world of microcontrollers. These are programmable digital electronics 
that can read values from sensors and control output devices using the I/O pins, all 
on a single IC controlled by a little program.
And mixed in among all this is the practical side of electronics. This involves 
learning to read schematic diagrams, constructing circuit prototypes using bread-
boards, testing prototypes (using multimeters, oscilloscopes, and logic probes), revis-
ing prototypes (if needed), and constructing final circuits using various tools and 
special circuit boards.
In the next chapter, we will start at the beginning by looking at the theory of 
electronics.

2.1  Theory of Electronics
This chapter covers the basic concepts of electronics, such as current, voltage, resis-
tance, electrical power, capacitance, and inductance. After going through these 
concepts, this chapter illustrates how to mathematically model currents and volt-
age through and across basic electrical elements such as resistors, capacitors, and 
inductors. By using some fundamental laws and theorems, such as Ohm’s law, 
Kirchhoff’s laws, and Thevenin’s theorem, the chapter presents methods for analyz-
ing complex networks containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors that are driven 
by a power source. The kinds of power sources used to drive these networks, as we 
will see, include direct current (dc) sources, alternating current (ac) sources (includ-
ing sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal periodic sources), and nonsinusoidal nonperiodic 
sources. We will also discuss transient circuits, where sudden changes in state (such 
as flipping a switch within a circuit) are encountered. At the end of the chapter, the 
approach needed to analyze circuits that contain nonlinear elements (diodes, transis-
tors, integrated circuits, etc.) is discussed.
We recommend using a circuit simulator program if you’re just starting out in 
electronics. The web-based simulator CircuitLab (www.circuitlab.com) is extremely 
easy to use and has a nice graphical interface. There are also online calculators 
that can help you with many of the calculations in this chapter. Using a simulator 
program as you go through this chapter will help crystallize your knowledge, while 
providing an intuitive understanding of circuit behavior. Be careful—simulators can 
lie, or at least they can appear to lie when you don’t understand all the necessary 
parameters the simulator needs to make a realistic simulation. It is always important 
to get your hands dirty—get out the breadboards, wires, resistors, power supplies, 
and so on, and construct. It is during this stage that you gain the greatest practical 
knowledge that is necessary for an inventor.
It is important to realize that components mentioned in this chapter are only “theo-
retically” explained. For example, in regard to capacitors, you’ll learn how a capac-
itor works, what characteristic equations are used to describe a capacitor under 
certain conditions, and various other basic tricks related to predicting basic behavior. 
To get important practical insight into capacitors, however, such as real- life capacitor

applications (filtering, snubbing, oscillator design, etc.), what type of real capacitors 
exist, how these real capacitors differ in terms of nonideal characteristics, which capac-
itors work best for a particular application, and, more important, how to read a capaci-
tor label, requires that you jump to Chap. 3, Sec. 3.6, which is dedicated to these issues. 
This applies to other components mentioned in this theory portion of the book.
The theoretical and practical information regarding transformers and nonlinear 
devices, such as diodes, transistors, and analog and digital integrated circuits (ICs), is 
not treated within this chapter. Transformers are discussed in full in Chap. 3, Sec. 3.8, 
while the various nonlinear devices are treated separately in the remaining chapters 
of this book.
A word of advice: if the math in a particular section of this chapter starts looking 
scary, don’t worry. As it turns out, most of the nasty math in this chapter is used to 
prove, say, a theorem or law or to give you an idea of how hard things can get if you 
do not use some mathematical tricks. The actual amount of math you will need to 
know to design most circuits is surprisingly small; in fact, basic algebra may be all 
you need to know. Therefore, when the math in a particular section in this chapter 
starts looking ugly, skim through the section until you locate the useful, nonugly 
formulas, rules, and so on, that do not have weird mathematical expressions in them. 
You don’t have to be a mathematical whiz to be able to design decent circuits.
2.2  Electric Current
Electric current is the total charge that passes through some cross- sectional area A per 
unit time. This cross- sectional area could represent a disk placed in a gas, plasma, or 
liquid, but in electronics, this cross- sectional area is most frequently a slice through a 
solid material, such as a conductor.
If ∆Q is the amount of charge passing through an area in a time interval ∆t, then 
the average current Iave is defined as:
FIGURE 2.1

If the current changes with time, we define the instantaneous current I by taking the 
limit as ∆t → 0, so that the current is the instantaneous rate at which charge passes 
through an area:

(2.1)
The unit of current is coulombs per second, but this unit is also called the ampere 
(A), named after Andre- Marie Ampere:
 
1 A = 1 C/s

Chapter 2: Theory    7
To sound less nerdy, the term amp can be used in place of ampere. Because the ampere 
is a rather large unit, current is also expressed in milliamps (1 mA = 1 × 10−3 A), micro-
amps (1 µA = 1 × 10−6 A), and nanoamps (1 nA = 1 × 10−9 A).
Within conductors such as copper, electrical current is made up of free electrons 
moving through a lattice of copper ions. Copper has one free electron per copper 
atom. The charge on a single electron is given by:
 
Qelectron = (− e) = −1.602 × 10−19 C 
(2.2.a)
This is equal to, but opposite in sign of, the charge of a single copper ion. (The posi-
tive charge is a result of the atom donating one electron to the “sea” of free electrons 
randomly moving about the lattice. The loss of the electron means there is one more 
proton per atom than electrons.) The charge of a proton is:
 
Qproton = (+ e) = +1.602 × 10−19 C 
(2.2.b)
The conductor, as a whole, is neutral, since there are equal numbers of electrons and 
protons. Using Eq. 2.2, we see that if a current of 1 A flows through a copper wire, the 
number of electrons flowing by a cross section of the wire in 1 s is equal to:
 
1 A

Now, there is a problem! How do we get a negative number of electrons flowing 
per second, as our result indicates? The only two possibilities for this would be to say 
that either electrons must be flowing in the opposite direction as the defined current, 
or positive charges must be moving in our wire instead of electrons to account for the 
sign. The last choice is an incorrect one, since experimental evidence exists to prove 
electrons are free to move, not positive charges, which are fixed in the lattice network 
of the conductor. (Note, however, there are media in which positive charge flow is 
possible, such as positive ion flow in liquids, gases, and plasmas.) It turns out that 
the first choice—namely, electrons flowing in the opposite direction as the defined 
current flow—is the correct answer.
Long ago, when Benjamin Franklin (often considered the father of electronics) 
was doing his pioneering work in early electronics, he had a convention of assigning 
positive charge signs to the mysterious (at that time) things that were moving and 
doing work. Sometime later, a physicist by the name of Joseph Thomson performed 
an experiment that isolated the mysterious moving charges. However, to measure 
and record his experiments, as well as to do his calculations, Thomson had to stick 
with using the only laws available to him—those formulated using Franklin’s posi-
tive currents. But these moving charges that Thomson found (which he called elec-
trons) were moving in the opposite direction of the conventional current I used in the 
equations, or moving against convention. See Fig. 2.2.
What does this mean to us, to those of us not so interested in the detailed phys-
ics and such? Well, not too much. We could pretend that there were positive charges 
moving in the wires and various electrical devices, and everything would work out 
fine: negative electrons going one way are equivalent to positive charges going in 

8    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
the opposite direction. In fact, all the formulas used in electronics, such as Ohm’s 
law (V = IR), “pretend” that the current I is made up of positive charge carriers. We 
will always be stuck with this convention. In a nutshell, it’s convenient to pretend 
that positive charges are moving. So when you see the term electron flow, make sure 
you realize that the conventional current flow I is moving in the opposite direction. In 
a minute, we’ll discuss the microscopic goings- on within a conductor that will clarify 
things a bit better.
Example 1: How many electrons pass a given point in 3 s if a conductor is carrying a 
2- A current?
FIGURE 2.3 
Answer: The charge that passes a given point in 3 s is:
 
∆Q = I × ∆t = (2 A)(3 s) = 6 C
One electron has a charge of 1.6 × 10−19 C, so 6 C worth of electrons is:
 
# Electrons = 6 C/1.602 × 10−19 C = 3.74 × 1019
FIGURE 2.2  Thomson changed the notion that positive charges were what were moving in con-
ductors, contrary to Franklin’s notion. However, negative electrons going one way is equivalent 
to positive charges going the opposite direction, so the old formulas still work. Since you deal 
with the old formulas, it’s practical to adopt Franklin’s conventional current—though realize that 
what’s actually moving in conductors is electrons.

Chapter 2: Theory    9
Example 2: Charge is changing in a circuit with time according to Q(t) = (0.001 C) sin 
[(1000/s) t]. Calculate the instantaneous current flow.

Answer: If we plug in a specific time within this equation, we get an instantaneous 
current for that time. For example, if t = 1, the current would be 0.174 A. At t = 3 s, 
the current would be − 0.5 A, the negative sign indicating that the current is in the 
opposite direction—a result of the sinusoidal nature.
Note: The last example involved using calculus—you can read about the basics of 
calculus in App. C if you’re unfamiliar with it. Fortunately, as we’ll see, rarely do you 
actually need to work in units of charge when doing electronics. Usually you worry 
only about current, which can be directly measured using an ammeter, or calculated 
by applying formulas that usually require no calculus whatsoever.
2.2.1  Currents in Perspective
What’s considered a lot or a little amount of current? It’s a good idea to have a gauge 
of comparison when you start tinkering with electronic devices. Here are some exam-
ples: a 100- W lightbulb draws about 1 A; a microwave draws 8 to 13 A; a laptop com-
puter, 2 to 3 A; an electric fan, 1 A; a television, 1 to 3 A; a toaster, 7 to 10 A; a fluorescent 
light, 1 to 2 A; a radio/stereo, 1 to 4 A; a typical LED, 20 mA; a mobile (smart) phone 
accessing the web uses around 200 mA; an advanced low- power microchip (indi-
vidual), a few µA to perhaps even several pA; an automobile starter, around 200 A; 
a lightning strike, around 1000 A; a sufficient amount of current to induce cardiac/ 
respiratory arrest, around 100 mA to 1 A.
2.3  Voltage
To get electrical current to flow from one point to another, a voltage must exist 
between the two points. A voltage placed across a conductor gives rise to an electro-
motive force (EMF) that is responsible for giving all free electrons within the conductor 
a push.
As a technical note, before we begin, voltage is also referred to as a potential dif-
ference or just potential—they all mean the same thing. We’ll avoid using these terms, 
however, because it is easy to confuse them with the term potential energy, which is 
not the same thing.
A simple flashlight circuit, consisting of a battery connected to a lamp, through 
two conductors and a switch, is shown in Fig. 2.4. When the switch is open (“off”), 
no current will flow. The moment the switch is closed, however, the resistance of the 
switch falls to almost zero, and current will flow. This voltage then drives all free 
electrons, everywhere within the circuit, in a direction that points from negative to 
positive; conventional current flow, of course, points in the opposite direction (see 
Benjamin Franklin).

10    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 2.4 
It is important to note that the battery needs the rest of the circuit, just as the  
rest of the circuit needs the battery. Without the linkage between its terminals, the 
chemical reactions within the battery cannot be carried out. These chemical reac-
tions involve the transfer of electrons, which by intended design can only occur 
through a link between the battery’s terminals (e.g., where the circuit goes). 
Figure 2.5 shows this process using an alkaline dry cell battery. Notice that the flow  
of current is conserved through the circuit, even though the nature of the current 
throughout the circuit varies—ionic current within sections of the battery, electron 
current  elsewhere.
FIGURE 2.5 
As free electrons within the lamp filament experience an EMF due to the applied 
voltage, the extra energy they gain is transferred to the filament lattice atoms, which 
result in heat (filament atomic vibrations) and emitted light (when a valence electron 
of a lattice atom is excited by a free electron and the bound electron returns to a lower 
energy configuration, thus releasing a photon).
A device that maintains a constant voltage across it terminals is called a direct 
current voltage source (or dc voltage source). A battery is an example of a dc voltage 
source. The schematic symbol for a battery is 
.

Chapter 2: Theory    11
2.3.1  The Mechanisms of Voltage
To get a mental image of how a battery generates an EMF through a circuit, we envi-
sion that chemical reactions inside yield free electrons that quickly build in number 
within the negative terminal region (anode material), causing an electron concentra-
tion. This concentration is full of repulsive force (electrons repel) that can be viewed 
as a kind of “electrical pressure.” With a load (e.g., our flashlight lamp, conductors, 
switch) placed between the battery’s terminals, electrons from the battery’s nega-
tive terminal attempt to alleviate this pressure by dispersing into the circuit. These 
electrons increase the concentration of free electrons within the end of the conductor 
attached to the negative terminal. Even a small percentage difference in free electron 
concentration in one region gives rise to great repulsive forces between free elec-
trons. The repulsive force is expressed as a seemingly instantaneous (close to the 
speed of light) pulse that travels throughout the circuit. Those free electrons nearest 
to the pumped- in electrons are quickly repulsed in the opposite direction; the next 
neighboring electrons get shoved, and so on down the line, causing a chain reaction, 
or pulse. This pulse travels down the conductor near the speed of light. See Fig. 2.6.
The actual physical movement of electrons is, on average, much slower. In fact, 
the drift velocity (average net velocity of electrons toward the positive terminal) is 
usually fractions of a millimeter per second—say, 0.002 mm/s for a 0.1- A current 
through a 12- gauge wire. We associate this drift movement of free electrons with 
current flow or, more precisely, conventional current flow I moving in the opposite 
direction. (As it turns out, the actual motion of electrons is quite complex, involving 
thermal effects, too—we’ll go over this in the next section.)
It is likely that those electrons farther “down in” the circuit will not feel the same 
level of repulsive force, since there may be quite a bit of material in the way which 
absorbs some of the repulsive energy flow emanating from the negative terminal 
(absorbing via electron- electron collisions, free electron–bond electron interactions, 
etc.). And, as you probably know, circuits can contain large numbers of components, 
some of which are buried deep within a complex network of pathways. It is possible 
to imagine that through some of these pathways the repulsive effects are reduced  
to a weak nudge. We associate these regions of “weak nudge” with regions of low 
FIGURE 2.6 

12    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
“electrical pressure,” or voltage. Electrons in these regions have little potential to 
do work—they have low potential energy relative to those closer to the source of 
pumped-in electrons.
Voltage represents the difference in potential energy. A unit charge has been at 
one location relative to another within a region of “electrical pressure”—the pres-
sure attributed to new free electrons being pumped into the system. The relationship 
between the voltage and the difference in potential energy is expressed as:
Implicit in the definition of voltage is the notion that voltage is always a mea-
surement between two points, say point A and point B. That is the reason for 
the subscript “AB” in VAB. The symbol ∆V means the same. Both infer that 
there is an absolute scale on which to measure and give individual points a 
specific voltage value. In electronics, we can create such a scale by picking a 
point, often the point where there is the lowest electrical pressure, and defin-
ing this point as the zero point, or 0- V reference. In many dc circuits, people 
choose the negative terminal of the battery as the 0- V reference, and let every-
one know by inserting a ground symbol 
 (more on this later). In practice, 
you rarely see voltages expressed using subscripts (VAB) or deltas (∆V), but 
instead you simply see the symbol V, or you may see a symbol like VR. The 
“blank symbol” V, however, is always modified with a phrase stating the two 
points across which the voltage is present. In the second case, VR, the subscript 
means that the voltage is measured across the component R—in this case, a 
resistor. In light of this, we can write a cleaner expression for the voltage/ 
potential energy expression:
V
U
q
=
Just make sure you remember that the voltage and potential energy variables 
represent the difference in relation to two points. As we’ll discover, all the big 
electronics laws usually assume that variables of voltage or energy are of this 
“clean form.”
In our flashlight example, we can calculate the difference in potential energy 
between an electron emanating from the negative terminal of the 1.5- V battery and 
one entering the positive terminal.
 
∆U = ∆Vq = (1.5 V)(1.602 × 10−19 C) = 2.4 × 10−19 J
Notice that this result gives us the potential energy difference between the two 
electrons, not the actual potential energy of either the electron emanating from the

negative terminal (U1) or the electron entering the positive terminal (U0). However, 
if we make the assumption that the electron entering the positive terminal is at zero 
potential energy, we can figure that the electron emanating from the negative termi-
nal has a relative potential energy of:
 
U1 = ∆U + U0 = ∆U + 0 = 2.4 × 10−19 J
Note: Increasing positive potential energy can be associated with similar charges get-
ting closer together. Decreasing energy can be associated with similar charges getting 
farther apart. We avoided the use of a negative sign in front of the charge of the elec-
tron, because voltages are defined by a positive test charge. We are in a pickle similar 
to the one we saw with Benjamin Franklin’s positive charges. As long as we treat the 
potential relative to the pumped- in electron concentration, things work out.
In a real circuit, where the number of electrons pumped out by the battery will 
be quite large—hundreds to thousands of trillions of electrons, depending on the 
resistance to electron flow—we must multiply our previous calculation by the total 
number of entering electrons. For example, if our flashlight draws 0.1 A, there will 
be 6.24 × 1017 electrons pumped into it by the battery per second, so you calculate the 
potential energy of all the new electrons together to be about 0.15 J/s.
What about the potential energies of free electrons at other locations throughout 
the circuit, such as those found in the lamp filament, those in the positive wire, those 
in the negative wire, and so on? We can say that somewhere in the filament of the 
lamp, there is an electron that has half the potential energy of a fresh pumped- in 
electron emanating from the negative terminal of the battery. We attribute this lower 
energy to the fact that other free electrons up the line have lost energy due to collision 
mechanisms, which in turn yields a weaker electrical repulsive pressure (shoving 
action) that our electron in question experiences. In fact, in our flashlight circuit, we 
attribute all loss in electrical pressure to be through the lamp filament as free- electron 
energy is converted into heat and light.
In regard to potential energies of free electrons within the conductors leading  
to and from the battery, we assume all electrons within the same conductor have the 
FIGURE 2.8  

14    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
same potential energy. This assumes that there is no voltage difference between points 
in the same conductor. For example, if you take a voltmeter and place it between 
any two points of a single conductor, it will measure 0 V. (See Fig. 2.8.) For practical 
purposes, we accept this as true. However, in reality it isn’t. There is a slight voltage 
drop through a conductor, and if we had a voltmeter that was extremely accurate we 
might measure a voltage drop of 0.00001 V or so, depending on the length of the 
conductor, current flow, and conductor material type. This is attributed to internal 
resistance within conductors—a topic we’ll cover in a moment.
2.3.2  Definition of Volt and Generalized Power Law
We come now to a formal definition of the volt—the unit of measure of voltage. Using 
the relationship between voltage and potential energy difference V = U/q, we define 
a volt to be:
 
1 volt
1 joule
1 coulomb , 1 V 1 J
1 C
J/C (Energy definition)
=
=
(Be aware that the use of “V” for both an algebraic quantity and a unit of voltage is a 
potential source of confusion in an expression like V = 1.5 V. The algebraic quantity 
is in italic.)
Two points with a voltage of 1 V between them have enough “pressure” to per-
form 1 J worth of work while moving 1 C worth of charge between the points. For 
example, an ideal 1.5- V battery is capable of moving 1 C of charge through a circuit 
while performing 1.5 J worth of work.
Another way to define a volt is in terms of power, which happens to be more use-
ful in electronics. Power represents how much energy per second goes into powering 
a circuit. According to the conservation of energy, we can say the power used to drive 
a circuit must equal the power used by the circuit to do useful work plus the power 
wasted, as in the case of heat. Assuming that a single electron loses all its potential 
energy from going through a circuit from negative to positive terminal, we say, for 
the sake of argument, that all this energy must have been converted to work—useful 
and wasted (heat). By definition, power is mathematically expressed as dW/dt. If we 
substitute the potential energy expression U = Vq for W, assuming the voltage is con-
stant (e.g., battery voltage), we get the following:
 
P
dW
dt
dU
dt
V dq
dt
=
=
=
Since we know that current I = dq/dt, we can substitute this into the preceding expres-
sion to get:
 
P = VI 
(2.3)
This is referred to as the generalized power law. This law is incredibly powerful, and it 
provides a general result, one that is independent of type of material and of the nature 
of the charge movement. The unit of this electrical power is watts (W), with 1 W = 
1 J/s, or in terms of volts and amps, 1 W = 1 VA.

Chapter 2: Theory    15
In terms of power, then, the volt is defined as:
 
1 volt
1 watt
1 amp , 1 V
1 W
1 A
W/A
=
=
=
The generalized power law can be used to determine the power loss of any circuit, 
given only the voltage applied across it and the current drawn, both of which can 
easily be measured using a voltmeter and an ammeter. However, it  doesn’t tell you 
specifically how this power is used up—more on this when we get to resistance. See 
Fig. 2.9.
Example 1: Our 1.5- V flashlight circuit draws 0.1 A. How much power does the cir-
cuit consume?
Answer:
 
P = VI = (1.5 V)(0.1 A) = 0.15 W

much current does it draw?

2.3.3  Combining Batteries
To get a larger voltage capable of supplying more power, we can place two batteries 
in series (end to end), as shown in Fig. 2.10. The voltage across the combination is 
equal to the individual battery voltages added together. In essence, we have placed 
two charge pumps in series, increasing the effective electrical pressure. Chemically 
speaking, if the batteries are of the same voltage, we double the number of chemical 
reactions, doubling the number of electrons that can be pumped out into the circuit.
In Fig. 2.10, we use the notion of a ground reference, or 0- V reference, symbolized 
. 
Though this symbol is used to represent an earth ground (which we define a bit later), 
it can also be used to indicate the point where all voltage measurements are to be 
FIGURE 2.9  

16    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
referenced within a circuit. Logically, whenever you create a scale of measure, you 
pick the lowest point in the scale to be zero—0 V here. For most dc circuits, the ground 
reference point is usually placed at the negative terminal of the voltage source. With 
the notion of ground reference point, we also get the notion of a point voltage, which 
is the voltage measured between the ground reference and a specific point of interest 
within the circuit. For example, the single battery shown in Fig. 2.10 has a voltage of 
1.5 V. We place a ground reference at the negative terminal and give this a 0- V point 
voltage, and place a 1.5- V point voltage marker at the positive terminal.
In the center of Fig. 2.10, we have two 1.5- V batteries in series, giving a combined 
voltage of 3.0 V. A ground placed at the negative terminal of the lower battery gives 
us point voltages of 1.5 V between the batteries, and 3.0 V at the positive terminal of 
the top battery. A load placed between ground and 3.0 V will result in a load current 
that returns to the lower battery’s negative terminal.
Finally, it is possible to create a split supply by simply repositioning the 0- V 
ground reference, placing it between the batteries. This creates +1.5 V and −1.5 V leads 
relative to the 0- V reference. Many circuits require both positive and negative volt-
age relative to a 0- V ground reference. In this case, the 0- V ground reference acts as a 
common return. This is often necessary, say, in an audio circuit, where signals are sinu-
soidal and alternate between positive and negative voltage relative to a 0- V reference.
2.3.4  Other Voltage Sources
There are other mechanisms besides the chemical reactions within batteries that give 
rise to an electromotive force that pushes electrons through circuits. Some examples 
include magnetic induction, photovoltaic action, thermoelectric effect, piezoelectric 
effect, and static electric effect. Magnetic induction (used in electrical generators) and 
photovoltaic action (used in photocells), along with chemical reactions, are, however, 
the only mechanisms of those listed that provide enough power to drive most circuits. 
The thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are usually so small (mV range, typically) 
that they are limited to sensor- type applications. Static electric effect is based on giv-
ing objects, such as conductors and insulators, a surplus of charge. Though voltages 
can become very high between charged objects, if a circuit were connected between 
the objects, a dangerous discharge of current could flow, possibly damaging sensi-
tive circuits. Also, once the discharge is complete—a matter of milliseconds—there  
FIGURE 2.10  

Chapter 2: Theory    17
is no more current to power the circuit. Static electricity is considered a nuisance in 
electronics, not a source of useful power. We’ll discuss all these different mechanisms 
in more detail throughout the book.
2.3.5  Water Analogies
It is often helpful to use a water analogy to explain voltage. In Fig. 2.11, we treat a dc 
voltage source as a water pump, wires like pipes, Benjamin Franklin’s positive charges 
as water, and conventional current flow like water flow. A load (resistor) is treated as 
a network of stationary force- absorbing particles that limit water flow. We’ll leave it 
to you to compare the similarities and differences.
Here’s another water analogy that relies on gravity to provide the pressure. Though 
this analogy falls short of being accurate in many regards, it at least demonstrates how 
a larger voltage (greater water pressure) can result in greater current flow.
FIGURE 2.11  
FIGURE 2.12  

18    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
It’s not wise to focus too much attention on these water analogies—they fall short 
of being truly analogous to electric circuits. Take them with a grain of salt. The next 
section will prove how true this is.
Example 1: Find the voltage between the various points indicated in the following 
figures. For example, the voltage between points A and B in Fig. 2.13a is 12 V.

2.4  A Microscopic View of Conduction (for Those Who Are Interested)
At a microscopic level, a copper conductor resembles a lattice of copper balls packed 
together in what’s called a face- centered- cubic lattice structure, as shown in Fig. 2.15. 
For copper, as well as other metals, the bonding mechanism that holds everything 
together is referred to as metallic bonding, where outermost valence electrons from the 
metal atoms form a “cloud of free electrons” which fill the space between the metal 
ions (positively charged atoms missing an electron that became “free”—see the plan-
etary model in Fig. 2.15b). This cloud of free electrons acts as a glue, holding the lat-
tice metal ions together.
FIGURE 2.13  
FIGURE 2.14  

Chapter 2: Theory    19
Each free electron within the cloud of free electrons moves about in random direc-
tions and speeds, colliding and rebounding “off” metal ions and other imperfections 
(impurities in lattice and grain boundary transitions, etc.). It is important to realize 
that this is occurring in a chunk of copper, at room temperature, without any applied 
voltage.
At room temperature, no free electrons ever leave the surface of the metal. A free 
electron cannot escape the coulomb (electric) attractive forces presented by the pos-
itive metal ions in the lattice. (We’ll see later that under special conditions, using 
unique mechanisms, it is possible for electrons to escape.)
According to what’s called the free- electron model—a classical model that treats 
free electrons as a gas of noninteracting charges—there is approximately one free 
electron per copper atom, giving a copper conductor a free electron concentration of 
ρn = 8.5 × 1028 electrons/m3. This model predicts that, under normal conditions (a piece 
of copper just sitting there at room temperature), the thermal velocity v of electrons  
(or root- mean- square speed) within copper is about 120 km/s (1.2 × 105 m/s), but

137 times stronger than the electromagnetic force. (b) Copper atoms, as viewed by the classic planetary model, consist-
ing of valance electrons held in orbit by electric forces. Quantum mechanics is required to explain why electrons exist in 
discrete energy levels, and why they don’t fall into the nucleus or radiate electromagnetic energy as they orbit. (c) Copper

depends on temperature. The average distance an electron travels before it collides 
with something, called the mean free path λ, is about 0.000003 mm (2.9 × 10−9 m), with 
the average time between collisions τ of roughly 0.000000000000024 s (2.4 × 10−14 s). 
The free- electron model is qualitatively correct in many respects, but isn’t as accurate 
as models based on quantum mechanics. (The speed, path, and time are related by 
v = λ/τ.)
In quantum mechanics, electrons obey velocity- distribution laws based on quan-
tum physics, and the movement of electrons depends on these quantum ideas. 
It requires that we treat electrons as though they were waves scattering from the 
lattice structure of the copper. The quantum view shows the thermal speed (now 
called Fermi velocity vF) of a free electron to be faster than that predicted by the 
free- electron model, now around 1.57 × 106 m/s, and contrarily, it is essentially inde-
pendent of temperature. In addition, the quantum model predicts a larger mean free 
path, now around 3.9 × 10−8 m, which is independent of temperature. The quantum 
view happens to be the accepted view, since it gives answers that match more pre-
cisely with experimental data. Table 2.1 shows the Fermi velocities of electrons for 
various metals.

function data from Paul A. Tipler and Ralph A. Llewellyn, Modern Physics, 3rd ed., W.H. Freeman, 1999.
Also, the surface binding energy (caused by electrostatic attraction) that prevents 
electrons from exiting the surface of the metal, referred to as the work function, is 
about 4.7 eV for copper (1 eV = 1.6022 × 10−19 J). The only way to eject electrons is 
through special processes, such as thermionic emission, field emission, secondary 
emission, and photoelectric emission.
(Thermionic emission: increase in temperature provides free electrons enough energy 
to overcome work function of the material. The emitted electron is referred to as a 
thermoelectron. Field emission: additional energy from an electric field generated by a 
high- voltage conductor provides an attractive enough positive field to free electrons 
from the surface. This requires huge voltages [MV per cm between emitting surface 

Chapter 2: Theory    21
and positive conductor]. Secondary emission: electrons are emitted from a metallic 
surface by the bombardment of high- speed electrons or other particles. Photoelectric 
emission: electron in material absorbs energy from incoming photon of particular fre-
quency, giving it enough energy to overcome work function. A photon must be of the 
correct frequency, governed by W = hf0, for this to occur [Planck’s constant h = 6.63 × 
10−34 J- s or 4.14 × 10−14 eV; f0 is in hertz]).
2.4.1  Applying a Voltage
Next, we wish to see what happens when we apply a voltage across the conductor—
say, by attaching a thick copper wire across a battery. When we do this, our randomly 
moving free electrons all experience a force pointing toward the positive end of the 
wire due to the electric field set up within the wire. (The field is due to the negative 
concentration of pumped- in electrons at one end relative to the neutral [positive rela-
tive to negative] concentration at the other end.) The actual influence this force has 
on the motion of the random free electrons is small—the thermal velocity is so large 
that it is difficult to change the momentum of the electrons. What you get is a slightly 
parabolic deviation in path, as shown in Fig. 2.16.
FIGURE 2.16  (a) Simplistic view of an electron randomly moving through a copper lattice, rebounding off lattice atoms 
and impurities. (b) An electron collides frequently with the ions and impurities in a metal and scatters randomly. In an 
electric field, the electron picks up a small component of velocity opposite the field. The differences in the paths are exag-
gerated. The electron’s path in an electric field is slightly parabolic. (c) Model illustrating current density, drift velocity, 
charge density, thermal velocity, and current.

22    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Normally, the field present in the wire would create a net acceleration component 
in the direction of the force; however, the constant collisions electrons experience 
create a drag force, similar to the drag experienced by a parachute. The net effect is 
an average group velocity referred to as the drift velocity vd. Remarkably, this velocity 
is surprisingly small. For example, the voltage applied to a 12- gauge copper wire to 
yield a 0.100- A current will result in a drift velocity of about 0.002 mm per second! 
The drift velocity is related, determined by
 
vd = J/(ρee)
where J is the current density—the current flowing through an area (J = I/A), ρe is 
the free- electron density in the material, and e is the charge of an electron. Table 2.1 
shows free- electron densities for various materials. As you can see, the drift velocity 
varies with current and diameter of the conductor.
The drift velocity is so slow, only fractions of a millimeter per second, that it is 
worth pondering how a measurable current can even flow. For example, what hap-
pens when you flip the switch on a flashlight? Of course, we don’t have to wait hours 
for electrons to move down the conductors from the battery. When we throw the 
switch, the electric field of the incoming electron has a repulsive effect on its neighbor 
within the wire. This neighbor then moves away toward another neighbor, creating a 
chain of interactions that propagates through the material at near the speed of light. 
(See Fig. 2.17.) This reaction, however, really isn’t the speed of light, but a fraction less, 
depending on the medium. The free electrons spreading throughout the conductor all 
start moving at once in response—those nearest the switch, as well as those nearest the 
light filament or LED. A similar effect occurs in fluid flow, as when you turn on a gar-
den hose. Because if the hose is already full of water, the outflow starts immediately. 
The force of the water at the faucet end is quickly transmitted all along the hose, and 
the water at the open end of the hose flows almost at the moment the faucet is opened.
In the case of alternating current, the field reverses directions in a sinusoidal fash-
ion, causing the drift velocity component of electrons to swish back and forth. If 
the alternating current has a frequency of 60 Hz, the velocity component would be 
vibrating back and forth 60 times a second. If our maximum drift velocity during 
an ac cycle is 0.002 mm/s, we could roughly determine that the distance between 
FIGURE 2.17  Illustration of how the electric field propagates down a wire as electrons are pumped into one end.

Chapter 2: Theory    23
maximum swings in the drift distance would be about 0.00045 mm. Of course, this 
 doesn’t mean that electrons are fixed in an oscillatory position. It means only that the 
drift displacement component of electrons is—if there is such a notion. Recall that an 
electron’s overall motion is quite random and its actual displacement quite large, due 
to the thermal effects.
2.5  Resistance, Resistivity, Conductivity
As was explained in the last section, free electrons in a copper wire at room tem-
perature undergo frequent collisions with other electrons, lattice ions, and impuri-
ties within the lattice that limit their forward motion. We associate these microscopic 
mechanisms that impede electron flow with electrical resistance. In 1826, Georg Simon 
Ohm published experimental results regarding the resistance of different materials, 
using a qualitative approach that  wasn’t concerned with the hidden mechanisms, 
but rather considered only the net observable effects. He found a linear relation-
ship between how much current flowed through a material when a given voltage 
was applied across it. He defined the resistance to be the ratio of the applied voltage 
divided by the resultant current flow, given by:
 
R
V
I
≡
 
(2.4)
This statement is called Ohm’s law, where R is the resistance, given in volts per 
ampere or ohms (abbreviated with the Greek symbol omega, Ω). One ohm is the 
resistance through which a current of 1 A flows when a voltage of 1 V is applied:
 
1 Ω = 1 V/1 A
The symbol 
 is used to designate a resistor.
Now, Ohm’s law isn’t really a law, but rather an empirical statement about the 
behavior of materials. In fact, there are some materials for which Ohm’s law actually 
 doesn’t work.
FIGURE 2.18  

24    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Ohm’s law can be applied only to ohmic materials—materials whose resistance 
remains constant over a range of voltages. Nonohmic materials, on the other hand, do 
not follow this pattern; they do not obey Ohm’s law. For example, a diode is a device 
that allows current to pass easily when the voltage is positive, but prevents current 
flow (creates a high resistance) when the voltage is negative.
CURIOUS NOTE ABOUT OHM’S LAW
Usually you see Ohm’s law written in the following form:
V = I × R
However, in this form it is tempting to define voltage in terms of resistance 
and current. It is important to realize that R is the resistance of an ohmic mate-
rial and is independent of V in Ohm’s law. In fact, Ohm’s law does not say 
anything about voltage; rather, it defines resistance in terms of it and cannot 
be applied to other areas of physics such as static electricity, because there is 
no current flow. In other words, you don’t define voltage in terms of current 
and resistance; you define resistance in terms of voltage and current. That’s 
not to say that you can’t apply Ohm’s law to, say, predict what voltage must 
exist across a known resistance, given a measured current. In fact, this is done 
all the time in circuit analysis.
2.5.1  How the Shape of a Conductor Affects Resistance
The resistance of a conducting wire of a given material varies with its shape. Doubling 
the length of a wire doubles the resistance, allowing half the current to flow, assum-
ing similar applied voltages. Conversely, doubling the cross- sectional area A has the 
opposite effect—the resistance is cut in half, and twice as much current will flow, 
again assuming similar applied voltages.
Increasing resistance with length can be explained by the fact that down the wire, 
there are more lattice ions and imperfections present for which an applied field (elec-
tric field instigated by added electrons pumped in by the source) must shove against. 
This field is less effective at moving electrons because as you go down the line, there 
are more electrons pushing back—there are more collisions occurring on average.
Decreasing resistance with cross- sectional area can be explained by the fact that 
a larger- volume conductor (greater cross- sectional area) can support a larger cur-
rent flow. If you have a thin wire passing 0.100 A and a thick wire passing 0.100 A, 
the thinner wire must concentrate the 0.100 A through a small volume, while the 
thick wire can distribute this current over a greater volume. Electrons confined to a 
smaller volume tend to undergo a greater number of collisions with other electrons, 
lattice ions, and imperfections than a wire with a larger volume. The concentration 
of free- electron flow, according to Benjamin Franklin’s convention, represents a con-
centration of conventional current flow in the opposite direction. This concentration 
of current flow is called the current density J—the rate of current flows per unit area. 
For a wire: J = I/A. Figure 2.19 demonstrates how the current density is greater in a 
thin 12- gauge wire than in a thicker 4- gauge wire. It also shows that the drift velocity 

Chapter 2: Theory    25
in the thick wire is less than the drift velocity in the thin wire—a result of a “decrease 
in electron field pressure” lowering the average “push” in the current flow direction.
2.5.2  Resistivity and Conductivity
We have left out the most important aspect of resistance that has nothing to do with 
the physical length or diameter of the material. How does the “chemistry” of the 
material affect the resistance? For example, if you have a copper wire with the same 
dimensions as a brass wire, which metal has the greater overall resistance? To answer 
this question, as well as provide a way to categorize materials, we adopt the concept 
of resistivity. Unlike resistance, resistivity is entirely independent of the dimensions 
of the material. Resistivity is a property unique to the material. The resistivity ρ is 
defined as follows:
 
R A
L
ρ ≡
 
(2.5)
where A is the cross- sectional area, L is the length, and R is the overall resistance of the 
material, as measured across its length. The units of resistivity are ohm- meters (Ωm).
For some, resistivity is too negative a concept—it tells you how “bad” something 
is at passing current. Optimists prefer the concept of conductivity—how “good” some-
thing is at passing current. Conductivity, symbolized σ, is simply the mathematical 
inverse of resistivity:
 
1
σ ≡ρ  
(2.6)
The units of conductivity are siemens, S = (Ωm)−1. (Mathematical note: [Ωm]−1 = 1/[Ωm]). 
Both conductivity and resistivity contain the same important underlining informa-
tion. Some prefer to play with equations that use the optimistic notion of conductiv-
ity (“glass half full”); others prefer the pessimistic notion of resistivity (“glass half 
empty”).
In terms of resistivity and conductivity, we can rewrite Ohm’s law as follows:

Table 2.2 shows the conductivities (resistivities, for the pessimists) of various

FIGURE 2.19  Effects of wire diameter on resistance. A thinner wire has more resistance per unit length than a thicker wire.

Physics, for a more complete list.) The conductivity of metals, such as copper and 
silver, is a factor of 1021 higher than that of a good insulator, such as Teflon. Though 
both copper and silver are great conductors, silver is simply too expensive for practi-
cal use. Though aluminum is a fairly good conductor and was actually used at one 
time in home circuitry, it quickly became apparent that it oxidized badly, inhibiting 
good electrical contacts and limiting current flow to channels of limited size. The 
result produced fire hazards.

An important feature of resistivity (or conductivity) is its temperature depen-
dency. Generally, within a certain temperature range, the resistivity for a large num-
ber of metals obeys the following equation:
 
ρ = ρ0[1 + α(T − T0)] 
(2.8)
where ρ is the calculated resistivity based on a set reference resistivity ρ0 and 
temperature T0. Alpha α is called the temperature coefficient of resistivity, given in units 

Chapter 2: Theory    27
of 1/°C or (°C)−1. The resistivity for most metals increases with temperature because 
lattice atom vibrations caused by thermal energy (increased temperature) impede the 
drift velocity of conducting electrons.

Pure water
2.5 × 105
 Distilled water is a very good insulator—it has a high resistivity. The rather weak 
mechanism of conduction is one based on ion flow, not electron flow, as we saw 
in metals. Water normally has an autoionization at room temperature that gives 
rise to an amount of H3O+ and OH− ions, which number small in comparison to 
H2O molecules (1:10−7). If a battery of known voltage is connected to two copper 
electrodes placed apart within a bucket of distilled water, and a current is mea-
sured in the hardwire section of the circuit, using Ohm’s law, we find that the 
water presents a resistance of around 20 × 106 Ω/cm. Between the electrodes, 
H3O+ flows toward the negative electrode, and OH− flows toward the positive 
electrode. When each ion makes contact with the electrodes, it deposits an 
electron or accepts an electron, whereby the ion recombines in solution.
Saltwater
∼0.2
 Adding an ionic compound in the form of common salt (NaCl) to water 
increases the ion concentration within solution—NaCl ionizes into Na+ and Cl−.  
A gram of salt added introduces around 2 × 1022 ions. These ions act as charge 
carriers, which in turn, effectively lowers the solution’s resistance to below an ohm 
per meter. If we use the solution as a conductor between a battery and a lamp—
via electrodes placed in solution—there is ample current to light the lamp.

Varies with moisture and salt content.
Air 
 Considered an insulator since it is fairly void of free electrons. However, like liq-
uids, air often contains concentrations of positive and negative airborne ions. 
The formation of an air ion starts out with an electron being knocked off a neu-
tral air molecule, such as oxygen (O2) or nitrogen (N2), via naturally occurring 
bombardment with x- rays, gamma rays, or alpha particles emitted by decay-
ing radon atoms. (There are about 5 to 10 ion pairs produced per second per 
centimeter at sea level; more around radon areas.) The positive molecule of 
oxygen or nitrogen rapidly attracts polar molecules (from 10 to 15 in number), 
mostly water. The resulting cluster is called a positive air ion. The liberated 
electron, on the other hand, will most likely attach itself to an oxygen molecule 
(nitrogen has no affinity for electrons). Note: air is considered neutral—ions are 
always formed in pairs, equal parts positive and negative.
 For current to flow through air, you must apply an electric field across the air—
say, by using two parallel plates placed apart and set to different potentials 
(a voltage existing between them). At low voltage, the field strength is small and 
you may get movement of air ions between the plates, but since the concentra-
tion of free- floating ions is so small, there is practically no current. However, if 
you increase the field strength, it is possible to accelerate those free electrons 
(those liberated by natural processes) within the air to such high velocities 
(toward the positive plate) that these electrons themselves can have enough 
energy to collide with air molecules and generate more ion pairs (positive and 
negative). The breakdown field strength at which to instigate these ionizations 
is somewhere around 3 megavolts per meter between plane electrodes in air. 
Two metal plates 1 cm apart need about 30,000 V for ionization to take place 
between the plates. However, you can increase the strength of an electric field 
by replacing one of the plates with a sharp metal point or thin wire. The required 
voltage drops to a few kilovolts. What occurs can be classified into the following:

Air
 Corona discharge: Ionization is limited to a small region around the electrode, 
where the breakdown field strength is exceeded. In the rest of the field, there is 
just a current of slow- moving ions and even slower- moving charged particles 
finding their way to the counter electrode (which may be an oppositely charged 
plate, or simply the wall of the room or the ground). Such a discharge may be 
maintained as long as the breakdown field strength is exceeded in some region.
 Spark discharge: May take place between two well- rounded conductors at 
different potentials, one of them often grounded. Like corona discharge, the 
discharge starts at a point where the breakdown field strength is exceeded. 
But in contrast to corona discharge, in a spark the ionization takes place all 
the way between the electrodes. The discharge is very fast, and the energy of 
the discharge is confined to a narrow volume. The voltage necessary to cause 
breakdown is called the breakdown voltage. For example, when you become 
charged by walking across an insulated floor (e.g., carpet) with insulated shoes 
and acquire a charge due to contact and friction, then touch a grounded 
object, charge will flow between you, even before you make physical contact—
the spark. Few people notice discharges at voltages lower than about 1000 V. 
Most people start to feel an unpleasant effect around 2000 V. Almost everyone 
will complain when exposed to discharges at voltages above 3000 V.
 Brush discharge: In between the corona discharge and the spark, which 
may take place, for example, between a charged material and a normally 
grounded electrode with a radius of curvature of some millimeters. If a brush 
discharge is maintained over longer periods, it may appear as irregular lumi-
nescent paths. Almost all discharges from insulators are brush discharges, like 
the crackle heard as you pick up a charged photocopy or that you feel when 
you pull a sweater over your head.
Vacuum
 Considered a perfect insulator, since, by definition, it contains no free charges 
at all. However, this  doesn’t mean it isn’t possible for charges to pass through 
it. Various mechanisms can eject electrons from a material into a so- called 
vacuum. (This applies for air, too.) Examples of such mechanisms include 
thermionic emission, where an increase in temperature provides free electrons 
enough energy to overcome surface potential barriers (the work function) of 
the material; field emission, whereby additional energy from an electric field 
generated by a high- voltage conductor provides an attractive enough positive 
field to free electrons from the surface, which requires huge voltages (MV per 
cm between emitting surface and positive conductor); secondary emission, 
where electrons are emitted from a metallic surface by the bombardment of 
high- speed electrons or other particles; photoelectric emission, where electrons 
are ejected from the surface of a material when a photon of a particular fre-
quency strikes it (absorbed electron). Many of these mechanisms are employed 
in vacuum tube technology. However, without such mechanisms to source elec-
trons, there will be no source of charge within the vacuum to support a current.
2.6  Insulators, Conductors, and Semiconductors
As we have seen, the electrical resistivities of materials vary greatly between conduc-
tors and insulators. A decent conductor has around 10−8 Ωm; a good insulator has 
around 1014 Ωm; a typical semiconductor from 10−5 to 103 Ωm—depending on tem-
perature. What is the microscopic explanation for these differences?
The answer to this question rests upon the quantum nature of electrons. In classi-
cal physics the energy of an electron in a metal can take on any value—it is said the 
energy values form a continuum. (Here, electron energy is considered zero at infinite 
  (Continued)

Chapter 2: Theory    29
distance from the nucleus and becomes more negative in energy closer to the nucleus, 
relative to the zero reference state. Negative energy infers that there is electric attrac-
tion between the positive nucleus and the electron—it is electric potential energy.) 
However, a quantum description of electrons in metals shows that the energy values 
of electrons are quantized, taking on discrete values. This comes from the wavelike 
nature of electrons—analogous to standing waves on strings existing only at discrete 
frequencies. Figure 2.20 shows an energy diagram illustrating the possible energy 
levels of an electron (ignoring lattice influences). The diagram illustrates only the 
possible energy levels—electrons are not necessarily in each level.
When a set of atoms forms a regular background lattice, the possible energy val-
ues of the electrons are altered even further. We still have discrete energy regions, 
called allowed bands, but we now get what are called energy gaps. Energy gaps are 
forbidden regions to the electron, and represent regions where no traveling wave 
(electron) can exist when placed in the periodic electric potential of the metal’s posi-
tive lattice ions. These gaps are quite large in the scale of atomic physics—within 
 electron- volts range. Again, energy levels presented in the band diagram specify only 
possible values of electron energies—they may or may not be occupied.
Now, quantum physics has an interesting property, called the Pauli exclusion prin-
ciple, which has a critical role in determining the properties of materials. The Pauli 
exclusion principle says that no two electrons in an atom can be in the same quantum 
state. The lowest common divisor of quantum states is the spin quantum number ms, 
which states that no more than two electrons with opposing spin (up or down) can be 
located in the same energy level. Now, if we consider a solid that has many free elec-
trons, which is in an equilibrium state, electrons fill the lowest energy levels available 
in the allowed band, up to two in each level. Those electrons further down in energy 
are more tightly bound and are called innermost electrons. When all the electrons are 
FIGURE 2.20  (Left) Energy diagram showing all possible energy levels of an electron in a solid; 
but it takes no account of the influence of an atomic crystalline lattice structure. (Right) Energy 
diagram that shows possible energy levels of an electron within a material made of a regular 
lattice of atoms. Electron energies are restricted to lie within allowed bands, and there is a large 
energy gap where no electrons are allowed. Even within the allowed bands, the possible electron 
energies are closely spaced discrete levels.

30    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
placed in the lowest energy state, we are left with two possible outcomes. In the first 
case, the highest level to be filled is somewhere in the middle of a band. In the second 
case, the electrons just fill one or more bands completely. We assume that the material 
is at low enough temperature to prevent electrons from jumping to higher energy lev-
els due to thermal effects.
Now if we add some energy to the free electrons by applying an electric field 
(attach a voltage source), for example, the electrons in the lower energy levels cannot 
accept that energy, because they cannot move into an already filled higher energy 
level. The only electrons that can accept energy are those that lie in the top levels, and 
then only if there are nearby empty levels into which they can move. Materials with 
electrons in only partly filled bands are conductors. When the top layer of their elec-
trons moves freely into the empty energy levels immediately above, there is a current. 
The electrons that jump from a lower level to a higher level are said to be excited. The 
valance band is an allowed occupied band. The conduction band is an allowed empty 
band. The energy- band structure for conductors is shown in Fig. 2.21a and c.
If the highest- energy electrons of a material fill a band completely, then a small 
electric field will not give these electrons enough energy to jump the large energy gap 
to the bottom of the next (empty) band. We then have an insulator (see Fig. 2.21b). An 
example of a good insulator is diamond, whose energy gap is 6 eV.
In semiconductors, the highest- energy electrons fill a band (the valance band) at 
T = 0, as in insulators. However, unlike insulators, semiconductors have a small 
energy gap between that band and the next, the conduction band. Because the energy 
gap is so small, a modest electric field (or finite temperature) will allow electrons 
to jump the gap and thereby conduct electricity. Thus, there is a minimum electric 
field under the influence of which a material changes from insulator to conductor. 
Silicon and germanium have energy gaps of 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV, respectively, and are 
semiconductors. For semiconductors, an increase in temperature will give a fraction 
FIGURE 2.21  Four possible band structures for a solid: (a) Conductor—allowed band is only partially full, so electrons 
can be excited to nearby states. (b) Insulator—forbidden band with large energy gap between the filled band and the next 
allowed band. (c) Conductor—allowed bands overlap. (d) Semiconductor—energy gap between the filled band and the 
next allowed band is very small, so some electrons are excited to the conduction band at normal temperatures, leaving 
holes in the valence band.

Chapter 2: Theory    31
of the electrons enough thermal energy to jump the gap. For an ordinary conductor, 
a rise in temperature increases the resistivity, because the atoms, which are obstacles 
to electron flow, vibrate more vigorously. A temperature increase in a semiconductor 
allows more electrons into the empty band and thus lowers the resistivity.
When an electron in the valance band of a semiconductor crosses the energy gap 
and conducts electricity, it leaves behind what is known as a hole. Other electrons in 
the valence band near the top of the stack of energy levels can move into this hole, 
leaving behind their own holes, in which still other electrons can move, and so forth. 
The hole behaves like a positive charge that conducts electricity on its own as a posi-
tive charge carrier. An electron excited from the valence band to the conduction band 
is thus doubly effective at conducting electricity in semiconductors.
Besides the intrinsic elemental semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, 
there are hybrid compounds—compounds such as gallium arsenide. Other semicon-
ductors are made by introducing impurities into a silicon lattice. For example, an atom 
in the chemical group of phosphorous, arsenic, and antimony can replace one of the 
silicon atoms in a lattice without affecting the lattice itself too much. However, each of 
these impurities has one more electron in its valence level than the silicon atom has; 
this extra electron, for which there is no room in the valence band, takes a place in the 
conduction band and can conduct electricity. A semiconductor with impurities of this 
sort is called an n- type semiconductor, and the extra electrons are called donor electrons.
Atoms of elements in the same chemical group as boron, aluminum, and gallium 
have one less valence electron than silicon has. If an atom is added to a lattice of sili-
con as an impurity, there is one less electron than is needed to form a bond that holds 
the lattice together. This electron must be provided by the electrons of the valence 
band of the lattice material, and holes are created in this band. These holes act as posi-
tive charge carriers. The impurity atoms are called acceptors. A semiconductor with 
such impurities is called a p- type semiconductor.
We will see later on how n- type and p- type semiconductors are used for mak-
ing one- way gates for current flow (diodes) and voltage- controlled current switches 
(transistors).
2.7  Heat and Power
In Sec. 2.3, we discovered the generalized power law, which tells us that if we can 
measure the current entering a device, as well as the voltage across the device, we 
know the power that is used by the device:
 
P = VI 
(2.9)
The generalized power law tells us how much power is pumped into a circuit 
but  doesn’t say anything about how this power is used up. Let’s consider a two- lead 
black box—an unknown circuit that may contain all sorts of devices, such as resis-
tors, lamps, motors, or transistors. If all we can do is measure the current entering the 
black box and the voltage across it—say, using an ammeter and voltmeter (or singu-
larly, a wattmeter)—we could apply the generalized power law, multiply the mea-
sured current and voltage readings together, and find the power pumped into the 

32    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
black box. For example, in Fig. 2.22, we measure 0.1 A entering when a voltage of 
10 V is applied, giving us a total consumed power of 1 W.
Knowing how much power is pumped into the black box is incredibly useful—
it allows for quick power consumption measurements and often simplifies circuit 
analysis—as we’ll see later. But let’s say that we are interested in figuring out how 
much power is lost to heating (energy that goes into lattice vibrations, emissive radia-
tion, etc.). We really can’t say, assuming we aren’t allowed to look inside the black 
box. There could be devices inside that take some of the initial energy and use it to do 
useful work, such as generating magnetic fields in the armature (rotor) and stator sec-
tions of a motor, causing the stator to rotate; or generating a magnetic field in a voice 
coil attached to a paper speaker cone that compresses air; or generating light energy, 
radio waves, and so on. There may be power converted into other weird forms not 
really coined as heat, such as driving chemical reactions, generating hysteresis effects, 
or eddy current in transformers.
The only time we can say for certain that power is totally converted into heat 
energy is if we assume our black box is a perfect resistor (100 percent ohmic in 
nature). Only then can we substitute Ohm’s law into the generalized power equation:
 
P = VI = V(V/R) = V2/R 
(2.10)
or
 
P = VI = (IR)I = I 2R
In this form, the power lost due to heating is often called Ohmic heating, Joule heating, 
or I 2R loss. Be careful how you interpret this law. For example, let’s consider our black 
box that drew 1 W of power. Given the power and the current—which we measure—
it would be easy to assume that the resistance of the black box is:
 
1 W
(0.01 A)

R
P
I
=
=
=
Ω
FIGURE 2.22  

Chapter 2: Theory    33
Accordingly, we would say the black box is a 100- Ω resistor generating 1 W of heat. 
As you can see, this is an erroneous assumption, since we have disregarded the 
internal workings of the black box—we  didn’t account for devices that perform 
useful work. You’ll often see people treat any load (black box) as a resistor when 
doing circuit analysis and such. This will get you the right answer when solving for 
a particular variable, but it is an analysis trick and  shouldn’t be used to determine 
how much heat is being generated, unless, of course, the black box is actually a 
resistor.
The following example provides some insight into where power is being used 
and how much of it is being converted into heat.
Example: With an ammeter and voltmeter, you measure the current drawn by a com-
puter to be 1.5 A and the voltage entering to be 117 V. How much power does the 
computer consume? Can we say how much power is lost to heat?
Answer: P = IV = (1.5 A)(117 V) = 176 W. Knowing how much of the power is lost to 
heating is practically impossible to measure without taking the computer apart.
Example: Determine the resistance of the following four round rods of material, each 
1 m long and 2 mm in diameter: copper, brass, stainless steel, and graphite. Also fig-
ure out how much power is lost to heating if a current of 0.2 A flows through each one.

  The total power pumped into this cir-
cuit gets converted into useful work and 
heat. The total “pump- in” power is:
  Ptot = IV = (0.757 A)(12 V) = 9.08 W
  (This is based on an open terminal bat-
tery measurement, without the rest of the 
circuit attached.) From there, we notice 
that some of the total power is wasted 
within the internal resistance of the bat-
tery, within the internal resistance of 
the wires, and within the resistance of 
the current- limiting resistor used by the 
LED. The power used to create light from 
the lamp and LED can be considered use-
ful power used. However, since we can’t 
really separate the heat from the light 
power for these devices, we must apply 
the generalized power law to them and be 
content with that. According to the con-
servation of energy (or power), all indi-
vidual powers within the circuit add up 
to the total power.

Using Table 2.2:
 ρcopper = 1.72 × 10−8 Ωm, ρbrass = 7.0 × 10−8 Ωm, ρsteel = 7.2 × 10−7 Ωm, ρgraphite = 3.5 × 10−5 Ωm
Substituting this into the resistance expression, we get:
 
Rcopper = 5.48 × 10−3 Ω, Rbrass = 2.23 × 10−2 Ω, Rsteel = 2.31 × 10−1 Ω, Rgraphite = 11.1 Ω
The power loss we get by using Eq. 2.10: P = I 2R = (0.2 A)2R = (0.04 A2)R:
 
Pcopper = 2.2 × 10−4 W, Pbrass = 8.9 × 10−4 W, Psteel = 9.2 × 10−3 W, Pgraphite = 0.44 W
2.8  Thermal Heat Conduction and Thermal Resistance
How is the energy transferred in heating? Within a gas, heat transfer represents the 
transfer of energy between colliding gas molecules. Gas molecules at a hotter tem-
perature move around more quickly—they have a high kinetic energy. When they are 
introduced into another, colder- temperature gas, the “hotter,” fast- moving molecules 
impart their energy to the slower- moving molecules. Gases tend to be the worst ther-
mal conductors, due to a low density of molecules.
In nonmetals, heat transfer is a result of the transfer of energy due to lattice 
 vibrations—energetically vibrating atoms in one region of a solid (e.g., the region 
near a flame) transfer their energy to other regions of a solid that have less energeti-
cally vibrating atoms. The transfer of heat can be enhanced by cooperative motion 
in the form of propagating lattice waves, which in the quantum limit are quantized 
as phonons. The thermal conductivity of nonmetals varies, depending greatly on the 
lattice structure.
In terms of metals, heat transfer is a result of both lattice vibration effects (as seen 
in nonmetals) as well as kinetic energy transfer due to mobile free electrons. Recall 
that free electrons within a metal are moving quite fast (∼106 m/s for most metals) 
at room temperature. Though quantum mechanics is required, it is possible to treat 
these electrons like a dense gas, capable of increasing its overall energy as heat is 
added, and likewise, capable of transporting this energy to regions of the metal that 
are lower in temperature. Notice, however, that an increase in metal temperature, as 
a whole, also increases the electrical resistance—the drift velocity component of the 
free electron goes down, due to both increased lattice vibrations and an increase in 
thermal velocity component. It becomes harder to influence the free electrons with 
an applied field. Metals are the best thermal conductors, due in part to the additional 
free electrons.
The energy an object has at temperature T is correlated to the internal energy—a 
result of its internal atomic/molecular/electron motions. It is not correct, however, 
to use the word heat, such as “object possesses heat.” Heat is reserved to describe the 
process of energy transfer from a high- temperature object to a lower- temperature 
object. According to the first law of thermodynamics, which is a statement about 
the conservation of energy, the change in internal energy of a system ∆U is equal to 

Chapter 2: Theory    35
the heat QH added to the system and the work W done by the system: ∆U = QH − W. 
If we assume that no work is done (energy transferred to, say, move a piston, in the 
case of a gas), we say ∆U = QH. With this assumption, we can take heat to be not a 
measure of internal energy of the system, but a change in internal energy. The main 
reason for this concept is that it is very difficult to determine the actual internal 
energy of a system; changes in internal energy are more meaningful and measurable.
In practice, what is most useful is the rate of heat transfer—the power loss due 
to heating. With the help of experimental data, the following formula can be used to 
determine how well certain materials transfer heat:
 
P
dQ
dt
k T
H
heat =
= −∇
 
(2.11)
Here, k is called the thermal conductivity (measured in W/m °C) of the material in ques-
tion, and ∇T is the temperature gradient:

i t
j t
k t T
∇
=

∂+



Now, the gradient is probably scary to a lot of you—it is simply a way to repre-
sent temperature distributions in 3- D, with time. To keep things simple, we will stick 
to 2- D, and represent the gradient as acting through an area A through a thickness L, 
and assume steady- state conditions:
 
P
k A T
L
heat = −
∆
 
(2.12)
where ∆T = Thot − Tcold, measured at points across the length L of the material. The 
material may be steel, silicon, copper, PC board material, and so on. Figure 2.24 shows 
a picture of the situation.
  When one end of a block of mate-
rial is placed at a hot temperature, 
heat will be conducted through 
the material to the colder end. The 
rate of heat transfer, or power due 
to heating, depends on the ther-
mal resistance of the material, 
which in turn is dependent on 
the geometry of the material and 
the material’s thermal resistiv-
ity. A weird- looking resistor- like 
symbol is used here to represent 
the thermal resistance. Table 2.4 
shows the thermal resistivities of 
various materials.

Thermal conductivity k, like electrical conductivity, has an inverse—namely, 
thermal resistivity λ. Again, one tells you “how good” a material is at transfer-
ring heat, the other tells you “how bad” it is at doing it. The two are related by 
k = 1/λ.
If we consider the geometry of the material, we can create a notion of thermal resis-
tance ℜtherm (analogous to electrical resistance), which depends on the cross- sectional 
area A, the length of the block of material L, and the thermal conductivity k, or resis-

A very useful property of Eq. 2.14 is that it is exactly analogous to Ohm’s law, and 
therefore the same principles and methods apply to heat flow problems as to circuit 
problems. For example, the following correspondences hold:
Thermal conductivity k [W/(m °C)]

Example: Calculate the temperature of a 4- in (0.1 m) piece of #12 copper wire at the 
end that is being heated by a 25- W (input power) soldering iron, and whose other 
end is clamped to a large metal vise (assume an infinite heat sink), if the ambient 
temperature is 25°C (77°F).
Answer: First, calculate the thermal resistance of the copper wire (diameter #12 wire 
is 2.053 mm, cross- sectional area is 3.31 × 10−6 m2):

Then, rearranging the heat flow equation and making a realistic assumption that only 
around 10 W of heat actually is transferred to the wire from the 25- watt iron, we get:
 
∆T = Pheatℜtherm = (10 W)(77.4°C/W) = 774°C
So the wire temperature at the hot end is estimated at:
 
25°C + ∆T = 799°C (or 1470°F)
It’s important to realize that in the preceding example, we assume steady- state 
conditions, where the soldering iron has been held in place for a long time. Also, the 
assumption that only 10 W were transferred is an important point, since there is a lot 
of heat being radiated off as heat to the air and the iron handle, and so on. In any case, 
things can get very hot, even when moderate power levels are in question.
2.8.1  Importance of Heat Production
Heat production has its place in electronics (toasters, hair dryers, water heaters, etc.), 
but most of the time heat represents power loss that is to be minimized whenever pos-
sible, or at least taken into consideration when selecting components. All real circuit 
components—not just resistors but things like capacitors, transformers, transistors, 
and motors—contain inherent internal resistances. Though these internal resistances 
can often be neglected, in some situations they cannot be ignored.
Major problems arise when unintended heat generation increases the temperature 
of a circuit component to a critical point, causing component failure by explosion, 
melting, or some other catastrophic event. Less severe problems may surface as a com-
ponent becomes thermally damaged, resulting in a change in characteristic properties, 
such as a shift in resistance that may cause undesirable effects in circuit behavior.

38    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To avoid problems associated with heat production, it’s important to use compo-
nents that are rated to handle two to three or more times the maximum power they are 
expected to dissipate. In cases where heat presents a shift in component parameter per-
formance, selecting a component with a lower temperature coefficient (TC) will help.
Heat dissipation (more correctly, the efficient removal of generated heat) becomes 
very important in medium-  to high- power circuits—power supplies, amplifier stages, 
transmitting circuits, and power- hungry circuits with power transistors. There are 
various techniques to remove heat from a circuit in order to lower the operating tem-
perature of components to below critical levels. Passive methods include heat sinks, 
careful component layout, and ventilation. Heat sinks are special devices that are 
used to draw heat away from temperature- sensitive devices by increasing the radi-
ating surface in air—which acts like a cooling fluid for conduction. Active methods 
include forced air (fans) or some sort of liquid cooling. We’ll discuss these methods 
throughout the book.
Example: Figure 2.25 shows a thin- film resistor in an integrated circuit. How hot 
will it get with 2 W dissipated over its 0.1 × 0.2- in surface (100 W/in2)? Assume the 
ground plane is at 80°C.
Answer: Since we have three different media through which this heat will be trans-
ferred, we must take into consideration thermal conduction within each. With the help 
of Eq. 2.14 and Table 2.4, we get the individual heat transfers through each region:

Adding this together:

Adding this to the 80°C for the aluminum ground plane leads to an estimated 100°C 
for maximum resistor temperature. This is a conservative estimate, since it neglects 
transverse heat spreading.

2.9  Wire Gauges
In Sec. 2.5, we saw that the current density within a copper wire increased as the 
diameter of the wire decreased. As it turns out, a higher current density translates 
into a hotter wire; there are more collisions occurring between electrons and copper 
lattice ions. There is a point where the current density can become so large that the 
vibrating effect can overpower the copper- lattice binding energy, resulting in wire 
meltdown (also referred to as the fusing point). To prevent this from occurring, it 
is important to select the appropriate wire size for anticipated current levels. Wire 
size is expressed in gauge number—the common standard being the American Wire 
Gauge (AWG)—whereby a smaller gauge number corresponds to a larger- diameter 
wire (high current capacity). Table 2.5 shows a short list of common AWG wires. 
Section 3.1, on wires and cables, provides a more in- depth list.

† A circular mil (CM) is a unit of area equal to that of a 1- mil- diameter circle. The CM area of a 
wire is the square of the mil diameter.

Example: A load device that is known to vary in output power from 0.1 mW to 5 W 
is to be connected to a 12- V source that is 10 ft away from the load. Determine the 
minimum wire gauge, provided by Table 2.5, that can safely support any anticipated 
current drawn by the load.
Answer: We only care about the maximum power level, so using the generalized 
power law:

Given only the selection of wire gauges provided by Table 2.5, a 22- gauge wire with a 
0.914- A rating would work, though we could be conservative and select an 18- gauge 
wire with a 2.32- A rating. Since the length is so short, there is no appreciable drop in 
voltage through the wire, so we can ignore the length.
Example: A 10- Ω heating device is powered by a 120- VAC source. How much current 
does it draw, and what size conductors should be used to connect to the device?
Answer: 120 VAC is an RMS value of a sinusoidal voltage—in this case, household 
line voltage. Though we’ll discuss this later when we cover ac, it can be treated like a 
dc voltage in terms of power dissipated through a resistor. So,

A 10- gauge wire would support this kind of current, though a larger 8- gauge wire 
would be safer.
Example: Why  shouldn’t you connect a wire across a voltage source? For example, if 
you connect a 12- gauge wire directly across a 120- V source (120- V mains outlet), what 
do you think will happen? What will happen when you do this to a 12- V dc supply, 
or to a 1.5- V battery?
Answer: In the 120- V mains case, you will likely cause a huge spark, possibly melting 
the wire and perhaps in the process receiving a nasty shock (if the wire isn’t insu-
lated). But more likely, your circuit breaker in the home will trip, since the wire will 
draw a huge current due to its low resistance—breakers trip when they sense a large 
level of current flowing into one of their runs. Some are rated at 10 A, others at 15 A, 
depending on setup. In a good dc supply, you will probably trip an internal breaker or 
blow a fuse, or in a bad supply, ruin the inner circuitry. In the case of a battery, there is 
internal resistance in the battery, which will result in heating of the battery. There will 
be less severe levels of current due to the internal resistance of the battery, but the 
battery will soon drain, possibly even destroying the battery, or in an extreme case 
causing the battery to rupture.
2.10  Grounds
As we left off in Sec. 2.3, we saw that understanding voltage is a relativity game. For 
example, to say that a point in a circuit has a voltage of 10 V is meaningless unless 
you have another point in the circuit with which to compare it. Often you define a 

Chapter 2: Theory    41
point in the circuit to be a kind of 0- V reference point on which to base all other volt-
age measurements. This point is often called the ground, and is frequently represented 
by the symbol shown in Fig. 2.27:
For example, Fig. 2.28 shows various ways in which to define voltages by select-
ing a ground—which in this case is simply a 0- V reference marker. The single battery 
provides a 1.5- V potential difference or voltage between its terminals. We can simply 
place a 0- V reference ground at the negative terminal and then state that the positive 
terminal sits at 1.5 V relative to the 0- V reference ground. The 0- V reference, or the 
negative terminal of the battery, is called the return. If a load, such as a lamp or resistor, 
is placed between the terminals, a load current will return to the negative terminal.
In the center diagram in Fig. 2.28, we have two 1.5- V batteries placed end to end. 
When batteries are linked this way, their voltages add, creating a combined total volt-
age of 3.0 V. With the 0- V reference ground at the bottom, we get 1.5- V and 3.0- V 
readings at the locations shown in the figure. A load placed across the two batteries 
(3.0- V difference) will result in a load current that returns to the lower battery’s nega-
tive terminal. In this case, the return is through the 0- V reference—the lower battery’s 
negative terminal.
Finally, it is possible to create a split supply by simply repositioning the 0- V 
ground reference, placing it between the batteries. This creates +1.5 V and −1.5 V leads 
relative to the 0- V reference. Many circuits require both positive and negative voltage 
relative to a 0- V ground reference. In this case, the 0- V ground reference acts as a com-
mon return. This is often necessary—say, in an audio circuit—where signals are sinu-
soidal and alternate between positive and negative voltage relative to a 0- V reference.
Now, the ground symbol shown in Fig. 2.27 as a 0- V reference, or as a return, 
is used all the time by various people. As it turns out, however, it really is sup-
posed to represent a true earth ground—a physical connection to the earth through 
FIGURE 2.27  
FIGURE 2.28  

42    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
a conductive material buried in the earth. For whatever reasons, the symbol’s dual 
meaning has survived, and this can often be a source of confusion to beginners.
2.10.1  Earth Ground
The correct definition of an earth ground is usually a connection terminated at a rod 
driven into the earth to a depth of 8 ft or more. This earth ground rod is wired 
directly to a mains breaker box’s ground bar and sent to the various ac outlets in 
one’s home via a green- coated or bare copper wire that is housed within the same 
mains cable as hot and neutral wires. The ground can then be accessed at the outlet 
at the ground socket. Metal piping buried in the earth is often considered an earth 
ground. See Fig. 2.29.
A physical link to the earth is important because the earth provides an electrically 
neutral body; equal numbers of positive and negative charges are distributed through 
its entirety. Due to the earth’s practically infinite charge neutrality, attempts at chang-
ing the earth potential, via electrical generators, batteries, static electrical mechanisms, 
or the like, will have essentially no measurable effect. Any introduction of new charge 
into the earth is quickly absorbed (the earth’s moist soil is usually rather conductive). 
Such charge interactions occur constantly throughout the planet, and the exchanges 
average out to zero net charge.
For practical purposes, then, the earth is defined to be at a zero potential (rela-
tive to other things)—a potential that is practically immune to wavering. This makes 
the earth a convenient and useful potential on which to reference other signals. By 
connecting various pieces of electronics equipment to the earth ground, they can all 
share the earth’s ground reference potential, and thus all devices share a common 
reference.
The actual physical connection to earth ground at a particular piece of equipment 
is usually through the power cord’s ground wire that links to the mains ground wire 
network when the device is plugged in. The ground wire from the power cord is 
typically connected internally to the equipment chassis (frame) and, more impor-
tant for our discussion, to the return portion of a channel that emanates from the 
interior circuitry. This is then brought out as a ground lead terminal. For example, 
in Fig. 2.30, an oscilloscope, function generator, and generic audiovisual device use 
FIGURE 2.29  Earth ground.

Chapter 2: Theory    43
BNC and UHF connectors for input and output channels. Internally, the outer con-
nector body of the BNC or UHF jack is wired to the return (or source) portion of the 
channel, while a central conductor wire (insulated from the outer body) is wired to 
the source (or return) portion of the channel. The important part, now, is that the 
return, or outer, connector is also internally wired to the mains ground wire through 
the power cord cable. This sets the return to an earth ground reference. In the case of 
the dc power supply, a separate earth ground terminal is presented at the face in the 
form of a banana jack terminal. In order to ground the dc supply, a jumper wire must 
be connected between the negative supply terminal and the ground terminal. If no 
jumper is used, the supply is said to be floating.
All the grounded pieces of equipment share a common ground. To prove this to 
yourself, try measuring the resistance between the ground terminals of any two sepa-
rate pieces of test equipment in your lab. If the devices are properly grounded, you 
will get a measurement of 0 Ω (but a bit more for internal resistances).
Besides acting simply as a reference point, grounding reduces the possibility of 
electrical shock if something within a piece of equipment should fail and the chassis 
or cabinet becomes “hot.” If the chassis is connected to a properly grounded outlet 
via a three- wire electrical system ground, the path of current flow from the hot chas-
sis will be toward ground, not through your body (which is a more resistive path). 
A ground system to prevent shock is generally referred to as a dc ground. We’ll dis-
cuss shock hazards and grounding later, when we cover ac.
Grounding also helps eliminate electrostatic discharge (ESD) when a statically 
charged body comes in contact with sensitive equipment. The charged body could be 
FIGURE 2.30  Illustration showing how various test instruments and an audiovisual device share a common ground 
connection through the mains ground wiring.

44    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
you, after a stroll you took across the carpet. Some ICs are highly vulnerable to dam-
age from ESD. By providing a grounded work mat or using a grounded wrist strap 
while working with sensitive ICs, you can avoid destroying your chips by ensuring 
that charge is drained from your body before you touch anything.
Another big job the ground system does is provide a low- impedance path to 
ground for any stray RF current caused by stray radiofrequency- producing devices, 
such as electrical equipment, radio waves, and so on. Stray RF can cause equipment 
to malfunction and contributes to RFI problems. This low- impedance path is usually 
called RF ground. In most cases, the dc ground and the RF ground are provided by 
the same system.
Common Grounding Error
As previously mentioned, the ground symbol, in many cases, has been used as a 
generic symbol in circuit diagrams to represent the current return path, even though 
no physical earth ground is used. This can be confusing for beginners when they 
approach a three- terminal dc power supply that has a positive (+), negative (−), and 
ground terminal. As we have learned, the ground terminal of the supply is tied to the 
case of the instrument, which in turn is wired to the mains earth ground system. A 
common mistake for a novice to make is to attempt to power a load, such as a lamp, 
using the positive and ground terminals of the supply, as shown in Fig. 2.31a. This, 
however,  doesn’t complete a current return path to the energy source (supply), so no 
current will flow from the source; hence, the load current will be zero. The correct 
procedure, of course, is to either connect the load between the positive and negative 
terminals directly, thus creating a floating load, or, using a jumper wire between the 
ground and negative supply, create a grounded load. Obviously, many dc circuits don’t 
need to be grounded—it will generally neither help nor hinder performance (e.g., 
battery- powered devices need no such connection).
Circuits that require both positive and negative voltage require a power supply 
to provide each polarity. The supply for the positive voltage will have the negative 
FIGURE 2.31  

Chapter 2: Theory    45
terminal as a return, and the negative supply will have the positive terminal as the 
return. These two terminals are connected together, forming a common return path 
for load current, as shown in Fig. 2.32. The connection between the negative and the 
positive terminals of the supplies results in a common or floating return. The floating 
common may be connected to the earth ground terminal of a supply, if a particular 
circuit requests this. Generally, it will neither help nor hinder circuit performance.
Unfortunately, the earth ground symbol is used a bit too loosely in electronics, 
often meaning different things to different people. It is used as a 0- V reference, even 
though no actual connection is made to Earth. Sometimes it actually means to connect 
a point in a circuit to earth ground. Sometimes it is used as a generic return—to elimi-
nate the need to draw a return wire. It could be used as an actual earth ground return 
(using the mains ground copper wire), though this is unwise. See Fig. 2.33. To avoid 
complications, alternative symbols are used, which we discuss next.
2.10.2  Different Types of Ground Symbols
To avoid misinterpretations regarding earth grounding, voltage references, and cur-
rent return paths, less ambiguous symbols have been adopted. Figure 2.34 shows an 
earth ground (could be Earth or reference), a frame or chassis ground, and a digi-
tal and analog reference ground. Unfortunately, the common return for digital and 
FIGURE 2.32  
FIGURE 2.33  

46    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
analog is a bit ambiguous, too, but usually a circuit diagram will specify what the 
symbol is referring to.
Table 2.6 provides a rundown on meanings behind these symbols.
TABLE 2.6  Types of Ground Symbols
FIGURE 2.34  

Chapter 2: Theory    47
2.10.3  Loose Ends on Grounding
There are a few loose ends on grounding that need mentioning. They are discussed 
here, with reference to Fig. 2.35.
Shock Hazard
In instances where high voltages are required and chassis grounds or metal frames are 
used as return paths, shock hazardous conditions can be created if the earth grounds 
are neglected. For example, in Fig. 2.35a when a load circuit uses a metal enclosure as 
a chassis ground, resistive leakage paths (unwanted resistive paths) can exist, which 
result in high voltages between the enclosure and earth ground. If, inadvertently, an 
earth- grounded object, such as a grounded metal pipe, and the circuit chassis are 
simultaneously touched, a serious shock will result. To avoid this situation, the chas-
sis is simply wired to an earth ground connection, as shown in Fig. 2.35b. This places 
the metal pipe and the enclosure at the same potential, eliminating the shock hazard. 
Similar hazardous conditions can develop in household appliances. Electrical codes 
require that appliance frames, such as washers and dryers, be connected to earth 
ground.
Grounding and Noise
The most common cause of noise in large- scale electronic systems is lack of good 
grounding practices. Grounding is a major issue for practicing design and system 
engineers. Though it is not within the scope of this book to get into the gory details, 
we’ll mention some basic practices to avoid grounding problems in your circuits.
If several points are used for ground connections, differences in potential between 
points caused by inherent impedance in the ground line can cause troublesome ground 
loops, which will cause errors in voltage readings. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.35c, where 
two separated chassis grounds are used. VG represents a voltage existing between sig-
nal ground and the load ground. If voltage measurements are made between the load 
ground and the input signal, VS, an erroneous voltage, (VS + VG) is measured. A way to 
circumvent this problem is to use a single- point ground, as shown in Fig. 2.35d.
FIGURE 2.35  

48    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The single- point ground concept ensures that no ground loops are created. As the 
name implies, all circuit grounds are returned to a common point. While this approach 
looks good on paper, it is usually not practical to implement. Even the simplest cir-
cuits can have 10 or more grounds. Connecting all of them to a single point becomes 
a nightmare. An alternative is to use a ground bus.
A ground bus, or bus bar found in breadboards and prototype boards, or which 
can be etched in a custom printed circuit board (PCB), serves as an adequate substi-
tute for a single- point ground. A bus bar is simply a heavy copper wire or bar of low 
resistance that can carry the sum total of all load currents back to the power supply. 
This bus can be extended along the length of the circuitry so that convenient con-
nections can be made to various components spaced about the board. Figure 2.35e 
shows a bus bar return. Most prototype boards come with two or three lines of con-
nected terminals extending along the length of the board. One of these continuous 
strips should be dedicated as a circuit ground bus. All circuit grounds should be 
tied directly to this bus. Care must be taken to make sure that all lead and wire con-
nections to the bus are secure. For prototype boards, this means a good solder joint; 
for wire- wrap board, a tight wire wrap; for breadboard, proper gauge wire leads to 
securely fit within sockets. Bad connections lead to intermittent contact that leads 
to noise.
Analog and Digital Grounds
Devices that combine analog and digital circuitry should, in general, have their ana-
log and digital grounds kept separate, and eventually connected together at one sin-
gle point. This is to prevent noise from being generated within the circuits due to a 
ground current. Digital circuits are notorious for generating spikes of current when 
signals change state. Analog circuits can generate current spikes when load currents 
change or during slewing. In either case, the changing currents are impressed across 
the ground- return impedance, causing voltage variations (use Ohm’s law) at the local 
ground plane with respect to the system reference ground, often located near the 
power supply. The ground return impedance consists of resistive, capacitive, and 
inductive elements, though resistance and inductance are predominant. If a constant 
current is impressed across the ground return, resistance is primary, and a dc offset 
voltage will exist. If the current is alternating, resistance, inductance, and capacitance 
all play a role, and a resulting high- frequency ac voltage will exist. In either case, 
these voltage variations get injected into the local circuits and are considered noise—
capable of screwing up sensitive signal levels used within the local circuits. There are 
a number of tricks to reduce noise (such as adding capacitors to counterbalance the 
inductance), but a good trick is to keep the digital and analog ground separated, then 
attach them together at one single point.
Example: What do the following symbols represent?
FIGURE 2.36  

Chapter 2: Theory    49
Answer: (a) Probably an analog circuit ground that is terminated at the supply to  
an actual earth ground connection. (b) A chassis ground that is connected to earth 
ground, probably to prevent shock hazards. (c) Appears like an analog ground return 
that is linked to both the chassis and the earth ground. (d) A floating chassis that is 
connected to circuit return ground—a potential shock hazard. (e) Separate analog 
and digital grounds that are linked to a common ground point near the supply, which 
in turn is grounded to earth.
2.11  Electric Circuits
Though we have already shown circuits, let’s define circuits in basic terms. An electric 
circuit is any arrangement of resistors, wires, or other electrical components (capaci-
tors, inductors, transistors, lamps, motors, etc.) connected together that has some 
level of current flowing through it. Typically, a circuit consists of a voltage source 
and a number of components connected together by means of wires or other conduc-
tive means. Electric circuits can be categorized as series circuits, parallel circuits, or a 
combination of series and parallel parts. See Fig. 2.37.
  Basic Circuit
   A simple lightbulb acts as a load (the part of the circuit on which work must be done to 
move current through it). Attaching the bulb to the battery’s terminals, as shown, will 
initiate current flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. In the process, 
the current will power the filament of the bulb, and light will be emitted. (Remember 
that the term current here refers to conventional current—electrons are actually flow-
ing in the opposite direction.)
  Series Circuit
   Connecting load elements (lightbulbs) one after the other forms a series circuit. The 
current through all loads in series will be the same. In this series circuit, the voltage 
drops by a third each time current passes through one of the bulbs (all bulbs are exactly 
the same). With the same battery used in the basic circuit, each light will be one- third 
as bright as the bulb in the basic circuit. The effective resistance of this combination 
will be three times that of a single resistive element (one bulb).
  Parallel Circuit
   A parallel circuit contains load elements that have their leads attached in 
such a way that the voltage across each element is the same. If all three 
bulbs have the same resistance values, current from the battery will be 
divided equally into each of the three branches. In this arrangement, light-
bulbs will not have the dimming effect, as was seen in the series circuit, 
but three times the amount of current will flow from the battery, hence 
draining it three times as fast. The effective resistance of this combination 
will be one- third that of a single resistive element (one bulb).
FIGURE 2.37  

50    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Circuit Analysis
Following are some important laws, theorems, and techniques used to help predict 
what the voltage and currents will be within a purely resistive circuit powered by a 
direct current (dc) source, such as a battery.
2.12  Ohm’s Law and Resistors
Resistors are devices used in circuits to limit current flow or to set voltage levels 
within circuits. Figure 2.38 shows the schematic symbol for a resistor; two different 
forms are commonly used. Schematic symbols for variable resistors—resistors that 
have a manually adjustable resistance, as well as a model of a real- life resistor, are 
also shown. (The real- life model becomes important later on when we deal with high- 
frequency ac applications. For now, ignore the model.)
If a dc voltage is applied across a resistor, the amount of current that will flow 
through the resistor can be found using Ohm’s law. To find the power dissipated as 
heat by the resistor, the generalized power (with Ohm’s law substitution) can be used.
 
V = I × R 
(2.15) Ohm’s law
 
P = IV = V2/R = I 2R 
(2.16) Ohm’s power law
R is the resistance or the resistor expressed in ohms (Ω), P is the power loss in watts 
(W), V is the voltage in volts (V), and I is the current in amperes (A).
   Combination of Series and Parallel
   A circuit with load elements placed both in series and in parallel will 
have the effects of both lowering the voltage and dividing the current. 
The effective resistance of this combination will be three- halves that of a 
single resistive element (one bulb).
FIGURE 2.37  (Continued)
FIGURE 2.38  

Chapter 2: Theory    51
UNIT PREFIXES
Resistors typically come with resistance values from 1 Ω to 10,000,000 Ω. Most 
of the time, the resistance is large enough to adopt a unit prefix convention to 
simplify the bookkeeping. For example, a 100,000- Ω resistance can be simpli-
fied by writing 100 kΩ (or simply 100k, for short). Here k = ×1000. A 2,000,000- Ω 
resistance can be shortened to 2 MΩ (or 2M, for short). Here M = ×1,000,000.
Conversely, voltages, currents, and power levels are usually small fractions of 
a unit, in which case it is often easier to use unit prefixes such as m (milli or 
×10−3), µ (micro or × 10−6), n (nano or ×10−9), or even p (pico or ×10−12). For exam-
ple, a current of 0.0000594 A (5.94 × 10−5 A) can be written in unit prefix form 
as 59.4 µA. A voltage of 0.0035 (3.5 × 10−3 V) can be written in unit prefix form 
as 3.5 mV. A power of 0.166 W can be written in unit prefix form as 166 mW.
Example: In Fig. 2.39, a 100- Ω resistor is placed across a 12- V battery. How much cur-
rent flows through the resistor? How much power does the resistor dissipate?
Answer: See Fig. 2.39.
2.12.1  Resistor Power Ratings
Determining how much power a resistor dissipates is very important when design-
ing circuits. All real resistors have maximum allowable power ratings that must not 
be exceeded. If you exceed the power rating, you’ll probably end up frying your 
resistor, destroying the internal structure, and thus altering the resistance. Typical 
 general- purpose resistors come in 1⁄8- , 1⁄4- , 1⁄2- , and 1- W power ratings, while high- power 
resistors can range from 2 to several hundred watts.
So, in the preceding example, where our resistor was dissipating 1.44 W, we should 
have made sure that our resistor’s power rating exceeded 1.44 W; otherwise, there 
could be smoke. As a rule of thumb, always select a resistor that has a power rating 
at least twice the maximum value anticipated. Though a 2- W resistor would work in 
our example, a 3- W resistor would be safer.
To illustrate how important power ratings are, we examine the circuit shown in 
Fig. 2.40. The resistance is variable, while the supply voltage is fixed at 5 V. As the 
resistance increases, the current decreases, and according to the power law, the power 
decreases, as shown in the graphs. As the resistance decreases, the current and power 
FIGURE 2.39  

52    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
increase. The far right graph shows that as you decrease the resistance, the power rat-
ing of the resistor must increase; otherwise, you’ll burn up the resistor.
Example 1: Using an ammeter, you measure a current of 1.0 mA through a 4.7- kΩ 
resistor. What voltage must exist across the resistor? How much power does the resis-
tor dissipate?
Answer: V = IR = (0.001 A)(4700 Ω) = 4.7 V; P = I2 × R = (0.001 A)2 × (4700 Ω) = 0.0047 W = 
4.7 mW
Example 2: Using a voltmeter, you measure 24 V across an unmarked resistor. With 
an ammeter, you measure a current of 50 mA. Determine the resistance and power 
dissipated in the resistor.
Answer: R = V/I = (24 V)/(0.05 A) = 480 Ω; P = I × V = (0.05 A) × (24 V) = 1.2 W
Example 3: You apply 3 V to a 1- MΩ resistor. Find the current through the resistor and 
the power dissipated in the process.
Answer: I = V/R = (3 V)/(1,000,000 Ω) = 0.000003 A = 3 µA; P = V2/R = (3 V)2/ 
(1,000,000 Ω) = 0.000009 W = 9 µW
Example 4: You are given 2- Ω, 100- Ω, 3- kΩ, 68- kΩ, and 1- MΩ resistors, all with 1- W 
power ratings. What’s the maximum voltage that can be applied across each of them 
without exceeding their power ratings?
Answer: P = V2/R ⇒ V = PR; voltages must not exceed 1.4 V (2 Ω), 10.0 V (100 Ω), 
54.7 V (3 kΩ), 260.7 V (68 kΩ), 1000 V (1 MΩ)
2.12.2  Resistors in Parallel
Rarely do you see circuits that use a single resistor alone. Usually, resistors are found 
connected in a variety of ways. The two fundamental ways of connecting resistors are 
in series and in parallel.
When two or more resistors are placed in parallel, the voltage across each resistor 
is the same, but the current through each resistor will vary with resistance. Also, the 
FIGURE 2.40  

Chapter 2: Theory    53
total resistance of the combination will be lower than that of the lowest resistance 
value present. The formula for finding the total resistance of resistors in parallel is:

(2.18) Two resistors in parallel
The dots in the equation indicate that any number of resistors can be combined. For 
only two resistances in parallel (a very common case), the formula reduces to Eq. 2.18.
(You can derive the resistor- in- parallel formula by noting that the sum of the indi-
vidual branch currents is equal to the total current: Itotal = I1 + I2 + I3 + … IN. This is 
referred to as Kirchhoff’s current law. Then, applying Ohm’s law, we get: Itotal = V1/R1 + 
V2/R2 + V3/R3 + … VN/RN. Because all resistor voltages are equal to Vtotal since they 
share the same voltage across them, we get: Itotal = Vtotal/R1 + Vtotal/R2 + Vtotal/R3 + … 
Vtotal/RN. Factoring out Vtotal, we get: Itotal = Vtotal (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 … 1/R4). We call 
the term in brackets Rtotal.
Note that there is a shorthand for saying that two resistors are in parallel. The 
shorthand is to use double bars | | to indicate resistors in parallel. So to say R1 is in 
parallel with R2, you would write R1 | | R2. Thus, you can express two resistors in par-
allel in the following ways:

In terms of arithmetic order of operation, the | | can be 
treated similar to multiplication or division. For example, in 
the equation Zin = R1 + R2 | | Rload, you calculate R2 and Rload in 
parallel first, and then you add R1.
Example 1: If a 1000- Ω resistor is connected in parallel with a 
3000- Ω resistor, what is the total or equivalent resistance? Also 
calculate total current and individual currents, as well as the 
total and individual dissipated powers.

These individual currents add up to the total input current:

this law, and Ohm’s law, you come up with the current divider

equations, shown at the bottom of Fig. 2.41. These equations come in handy when you 
know the input current but not the input voltage.
We could have just as easily found the total current using:
 
Iin = Vin/Rtotal = (12 V)/(750 Ω) = 0.016 A = 16 mA
To find how much power resistors in parallel dissipate, apply the power law:
 
Ptot = IinVin = (0.0016 A)(12 V) = 0.192 W = 192 mW
 
P1 = I1Vin = (0.012 A)(12 V) = 0.144 W = 144 mW
 
P2 = I2Vin = (0.004 A)(12 V) = 0.048 W = 48 mW
Example 2: Three resistors R1 = 1 kΩ, R2 = 2 kΩ, R3 = 4 kΩ are in parallel. Find the 
equivalent resistance. Also, if a 24- V battery is attached to the parallel circuit to com-
plete a circuit, find the total current, individual currents through each of the resistors, 
total power loss, and individual resistor power losses.

The current through each of the resistors:
 
I1 = V1/R1 = 24 V/1000 Ω = 0.024 A = 24 mA
 
I2 = V2/R2 = 24 V/2000 Ω = 0.012 A = 12 mA
 
I3 = V3/R3 = 24 V/4000 Ω = 0.006 A = 6 mA
The total current, according to Kirchhoff’s current law:
 
Itotal = I1 + I2 + I3 = 24 mA + 12 mA + 6 mA = 42 mA
The total power dissipated by the parallel resistors:
 
Ptotal = Itotal × Vtotal = 0.042 A × 24 V = 1.0 W
The power dissipated by individual resistors is shown in Fig. 2.42.
2.12.3  Resistors in Series
When a circuit has a number of resistors connected in 
series, the total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the 
individual resistances. Also, the amount of current flow-
ing through each resistor in series is the same, while the 
voltage across each resistor varies with resistance. The for-
mula for finding the total resistance of resistors in series is:
 Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + … 
(2.19)
The dots indicate that as many resistors as necessary may 
be added.
You can derive this formula by noting that the sum of 
all the voltage drops across each series resistor will equal 
the applied voltage across the combination Vtotal = V1 + V2 + 
V3 + … + VN. This is referred to as Kirchhoff’s voltage law. 
Applying Ohm’s law, and noting that the same current 
I flows through each resistor, we get: IRtotal = IR1 + IR2 + 
IR3 + … + IRN. Canceling the I’s you get: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + 
R3 + R4 + …
Example 1: If a 1.0- kΩ resistor is placed in series with a 
2.0- kΩ resistor, the total resistance becomes:
Rtot = R1 + R2 = 1000 Ω + 2000 Ω = 3000 Ω = 3 kΩ
When these series resistors are placed in series with 
a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.43, the total current flow I is 
simply equal to the applied voltage Vin, divided by the 
total resistance:

Since the circuit is a series circuit, the currents through each resistor are equal to 
the total current I:
I1 = 3 mA, I2 = 3 mA
To find the voltage drop across each resistor, apply Ohm’s law:
V1 = I1 × R1 = 0.003 A × 1000 Ω = 3 V
V2 = I2 × R2 = 0.003 A × 2000 Ω = 6 V
Now, we  didn’t really have to calculate the current. We could have just plugged  
I = Vin/Rtot into I1 and I2 in the preceding equations and got:

              (Voltage divider  
equations) 
These equations are called voltage divider equations and are so useful in electronics that 
it is worth memorizing them. (See Fig. 2.43.) Often V2 is called the output voltage Vout.
The voltage drop across each resistor is directly proportional to the resistance. The 
voltage drop across the 2000- Ω resistor is twice as large as that of the 1000- Ω resistor. 
Adding both voltage drops together gives you the applied voltage of 9 V:
 
Vin = V1 + V2    9 V = 3 V + 6 V
The total power loss and individual resistor power losses are:
Ptot = IVin = (0.003 A)(9 V) = 0.027 W = 27 mW
(Ptot = I2Rtot = (0.003 A)2(3000 Ω) = 0.027 W = 27 mW)
P1 = I2R1 = (0.003 A)2(1000 Ω) = 0.009 W = 9 mW
P2 = I2R2 = (0.003 A)2(2000 Ω) = 0.018 W = 18 mW
The larger resistor dissipates twice as much power.
Example 2: The input of an IC requires a constant 5 V, but the supply voltage is 9 V. 
Use the voltage divider equations to create a voltage divider with an output of 5 V. 
Assume the IC has such a high input resistance (10 MΩ) that it practically draws no 
current from the divider.
Answer: Since we assume the IC draws no current, we can apply the volt-
age divider directly:

Example 3: You have a 10- V supply, but a device that is to be connected to the supply 
is rated at 3 V and draws 9.1 mA. Create a voltage divider for the load device.
Answer: In this case, the load draws current and can be considered a resistor in paral-
lel with R2. Therefore, using the voltage divider relation without taking the load into 
consideration will not work. We must apply what is called the 10 percent rule.
The 10 Percent Rule:  This rule is a standard 
method for selecting R1 and R2 that takes into account 
the load and minimizes unnecessary power losses in 
the divider.
The first thing you do is select R2 so that I2 is 10 
percent of the desired load current. This resistance and 
current are called the bleeder resistance and bleeder cur-
rent. The bleeder current in our example is:
Ibleed = I2 = (0.10)(9.1 mA) = 0.91 mA
Using Ohm’s law, next we calculate the bleeder 
resistance:
Rbleed = R2 = 3 V/0.00091 A = 3297 Ω
Considering resistor tolerances and standard resistance 
values, we select a resistor in close vicinity—3300 Ω.
Next, we need to select R1, so that the output is 
maintained at 3 V.
To do this, simply calculate the total current 
through the resistor and use Ohm’s law:
I1 = I2 + Iload = 0.91 mA + 9.1 mA = 10.0 mA = 0.01 A

In terms of power ratings:

PR2 = V2
2/R2 = (3 V)2/(3300 Ω) = 0.003 W = 3 mW
Low- power ¼- W resistors will suffice.
In actual practice, the computed value of the bleeder resistor does not always come 
out to an even value. Since the rule of thumb for bleeder current is only an estimated 
FIGURE 2.45  

58    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
value, the bleeder resistor can be of a value close to the computed value. (If the com-
puted value of the resistance were 500Ω, a 5 percent 510Ω resistor could be used. See 
the standard resistor values table in the front matter of the book.) Once the actual 
value of the bleeder resistor is selected, the bleeder current must be recomputed. The 
voltage developed by the bleeder resistor must be equal to the voltage requirement of 
the load in parallel with the bleeder resistor. We’ll discuss voltage dividers, as well as 
more complex divider arrangements, in the section on resistors in Chap. 3.
Example: Find the equivalent resistance of series resistors R1 = 3.3k, R2 = 4.7k, R3 = 
10k. If a 24- V battery is attached to the series resistors to complete a circuit, find the 
total current flow, the individual voltage drops across the resistors, the total power 
loss, and the individual power loss of each resistor.
The equivalent resistance of the three 
resistors:
     Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3
Rtotal = 3.3 kΩ + 4.7 kΩ + 10 kΩ = 18 kΩ

V3 = Itotal × R3 = 1.33 mA × 10 kΩ = 13.30 V
The total power dissipated is:
 
Ptotal = Itotal × Vtotal = 1.33 mA × 24 V = 32 mW
Power dissipated by individual resistors is shown in Fig. 2.46.
2.12.4  Reducing a Complex Resistor Network
To find the equivalent resistance for a complex network of resistors, the network is bro-
ken down into series and parallel combinations. A single equivalent resistance for these 
combinations is then found, and a new and simpler network is formed. This new net-
work is then broken down and simplified. The process continues over and over again 
until a single equivalent resistance is found. Here’s an example of how reduction works.
FIGURE 2.46

using circuit reduction. Afterward, find the total current flow supplied by the bat-

2.12.5  Multiple Voltage Dividers
Example 1: You wish to create a multiple voltage divider that powers three loads: 
load 1 (75 V, 30 mA), load 2 (50 V, 10 mA), and load 3 (25 V, 10 mA). Use the 10 percent 
rule and Fig. 2.49 to construct the voltage divider.
An important point in determining the resistor 
when applying the 10 percent rule of thumb is that to 
calculate the bleeder current, you must take 10 percent 
of the total load current. The steps are as follows:
Find the bleeder current, which is 10 percent (0.1) of the 
total current:
IR4 = 0.1 × (10 mA + 10 mA + 30 mA) = 5 mA
To find R4 (bleeder resistor), use Ohm’s law:
R4 = (25 V − 0 V)/(0.005 A) = 5000 Ω
The current through R3 is equal to the current through 
R4 plus the current through load 3:
IR3 = IR4 + Iload3 = 5 mA + 10 mA = 15 mA
To find R3, use Ohm’s law, using the voltage difference between load 2 and load 3: 
R3 = (50 V − 25 V)/(0.015 A) = 1667 Ω or 1.68 kΩ, considering tolerances and standard 
resistance values.
The current through R2 is:
 
IR2 = IR3 + Iload2 = 15 mA + 10 mA = 25 mA
Using Ohm’s law, R2 = (75 V − 50 V)/(0.025 A) = 1000 Ω
The current through R1 is:
 
IR1 = IR2 + Iload1 = 25 mA + 30 mA = 55 mA
Using Ohm’s law: R1 = (100 V − 75 V)/(0.055 A) = 455 Ω
To determine resistor power ratings and total power losses in loads use P = IV. See 
results in Fig. 2.49.
Example 2: In many cases, the load for a voltage divider requires both positive and 
negative voltages. Positive and negative voltages can be supplied from a single- 
source voltage by connecting the ground return between two of the divider resistors. 
The exact point in the circuit at which the ground is placed depends upon the volt-
ages required by the loads.
FIGURE 2.49  

62    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
For example, the voltage divider in Fig. 2.50 is 
designed to provide the voltage and current to three 
loads from a given source voltage:
Load 1: +50 V @ 50 mA
Load 2: +25 V @ 10 mA
Load 3: −25 V @ 100 mA
The values of R4, R2, and R1 are computed exactly as 
was done in the preceding example. IR4 is the bleeder 
current and can be calculated as follows:
IR4 = 10% × (Iload1 + Iload2 + Iload3) = 16 mA
Calculating R4:
R4 = 25 V/0.016 A = 1562 Ω
To calculate current through R3, use Kirchhoff’s current law (at point A):
 
IR3 + Iload2 + Iload1 + IR4 + Iload3 = 0
 
IR3 + 10 mA + 50 mA − 16 mA − 100 mA = 0
 
IR3 = 56 mA
Calculating R3: R3 = 25 V/(0.056 A) = 446 Ω.
Calculating IR2: IR2 = IR3 + Iload2 = 56 mA + 10 mA = 66 mA.
Then R2 = 25 V/(0.066 A) = 379 Ω.
Calculating IR1 = IR2 + Iload1 = 66 mA + 50 mA = 116 mA.
Then R1 = 25 V/0.116 A = 216 Ω.
Though voltage dividers are simple to apply, they are not regulated in any way. If 
a load’s resistance changes, or if there is variation in the supply voltage, all loads will 
experience a change in voltage. Therefore, voltage dividers should not be applied to 
circuits where the divider will be weighed down by changes in load. For applications 
that require steady voltage and that draw considerable current, it is best to use an 
active device, such as a voltage regulator IC—more on this later.
2.13  Voltage and Current Sources
An ideal voltage source is a two- terminal device that maintains a fixed voltage across 
its terminals. If a variable load is connected to an ideal voltage source, the source will 
maintain its terminal voltage regardless of changes in the load resistance. This means 
that an ideal voltage source will supply as much current as needed to the load in 
order to keep the terminal voltage fixed (in I = V/R, I changes with R, but V is fixed). 
FIGURE 2.50  

Chapter 2: Theory    63
Now a fishy thing with an ideal voltage source is that if the resistance goes to zero, 
the current must go to infinity. Well, in the real world, there is no device that can sup-
ply an infinite amount of current. If you placed a real wire between the terminals of 
an ideal voltage source, the calculated current would be so large it would melt the 
wire. To avoid this theoretical dilemma, we must define a real voltage source (a bat-
tery, plug- in dc power supply, etc.) that can supply only a maximum finite amount 
of current. A real voltage source resembles an ideal voltage source with a small series 
internal resistance or source resistance rs, which is a result of the imperfect conduct-
ing nature of the source (resistance in battery electrolyte and lead, etc.). This internal 
resistance tends to reduce the terminal voltage, the magnitude of which depends on 
its value and the amount of current that is drawn from the source (or the size of the 
load resistance).
In Fig. 2.52, when a real voltage source is open- circuited (no load connected 
between its terminals), the terminal voltage (VT) equals the ideal source voltage (VS)—
there is no voltage drop across the resistor, since current can’t pass through it due to 
an incomplete circuit condition.
FIGURE 2.51  
FIGURE 2.52  

64    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
However, when a load Rload is attached across the source terminals, Rload and rs are 
connected in series. The voltage at the terminal can be determined by using the volt-
age divider relation:
 
V
V
R
R
r
T
s
s
load
load
=
+
From the equation, you can see that when Rload is very large compared to rs, (1000 
times greater or more), the effect of rs is so small that it may be ignored. However, 
when Rload is small or closer to rs in size, you must take rs into account when doing 
your calculations and designing circuits. See the graph in Fig. 2.52.
In general, the source resistance for dc power supplies is usually small; however, 
it can be as high as 600 Ω in some cases. For this reason, it’s important to always 
adjust the power supply voltage with the load connected. In addition, it is a good 
idea to recheck the power supply voltage as you add or remove components to or 
from a circuit.
Another symbol used in electronics pertains to dc current sources—see Fig. 2.52. 
An ideal current source provides the same amount of source current IS at all times to a 
load, regardless of load resistance changes. This means that the terminal voltage will 
change as much as needed as the load resistance changes in order to keep the source 
current constant.
In the real world, current sources have a large internal shunt (parallel) resistance 
rs, as shown in Fig. 2.52. This internal resistance, which is usually very large, tends 
to reduce the terminal current IT, the magnitude of which depends on its value and 
the amount of current that is drawn from the source (or the size of load resistance).
When the source terminals are open- circuited, IT must obviously be zero. However, 
when we connect a load resistance Rload across the source terminals, Rload and rs form 
a parallel resistor circuit. Using the current divider expression, the terminal current 
becomes:

From this equation, you can see that when Rload is small compared to rs, the dip in cur-
rent becomes so small it usually can be ignored. However, when Rload is large or closer 
to rs in size, you must take rs into account when doing your calculations.
A source may be represented either as a current source or a voltage source. In 
essence, they are duals of each other. To translate between the voltage source and 
current source representation, the resistance value is kept the same, while the voltage 
of the source is translated into the current of the source using Ohm’s law. See Fig. 2.53 
for details.
One way to look at an ideal current source is to say it has an internal resistance 
that is infinite, which enables it to support any kind of externally imposed potential 
difference across its terminals (e.g., a load’s resistance changes). An approximation to 
an ideal current source is a voltage source of very high voltage V in series with a very 
large resistance R. This approximation would supply a current V/R into any load that 
has a resistance much smaller than R. For example, the simple resistive current source 
circuit shown in Fig. 2.54 uses a 1- kV voltage source in series with a 1- MΩ resistor. It 

Chapter 2: Theory    65
will maintain the set current of 1 mA to an accuracy within 1 percent over a 0-  to 10- V 
range (0 < Rload < 10 kΩ). The current is practically constant even though the load resis-
tance varies, since the source resistance is much greater than the load resistance, and 
thus the current remains practically constant. (I = 1000 V/(1,000,000 Ω + 10,0000 Ω. 
Since 1,000,000 Ω is so big, it overshadows Rload.)
A practical current source is usually an active circuit made with transistors, as 
shown in Fig. 2.54c. Vin drives current through R1 into the base of the second transis-
tor, so current flows into the transistor’s collector, through it, and out its emitter. This 
current must flow through R2. If the current gets too high, the first transistor turns 
on and robs the second transistor of base current, so its collector current can never 
exceed the value shown. This is an excellent way of either making a current source or 
limiting the available current to a defined maximum value.
2.14  Measuring Voltage, Current, and Resistance
Voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters, used to measure voltage, current, and resis-
tance, ideally should never introduce any effects within the circuit under test. In 
 theory, an ideal voltmeter should draw no current as it measures a voltage between 
two points in a circuit; it has infinite input resistance Rin. Likewise, an ideal ammeter 
should introduce no voltage drop when it is placed in series within the circuit; it has 
zero input resistance. An ideal ohmmeter should provide no additional resistance 
when making a resistance measurement.
FIGURE 2.53  
FIGURE 2.54  

66    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Real meters, on the other hand, have limitations that prevent them from mak-
ing truly accurate measurements. This stems from the fact that the circuit of a meter 
requires a sample current from the circuit under test in order to make a display mea-
surement. Figure 2.55 shows symbols for an ideal voltmeter, ammeter, and ohmmeter, 
along with the more accurate real- life equivalent circuits.
An ideal voltmeter has infinite input resistance and draws no current; a real volt-
meter’s input resistance is several hundred MΩs. An ideal ammeter has zero input 
resistance and provides no voltage drop; a real ammeter’s input resistance is frac-
tions of ohms. An ideal ohmmeter has zero internal resistance; a real ohmmeter’s inter-
nal resistance is fractions of ohms. It is important to read your instrument manuals to 
determine the internal resistances.
The effects of meter internal resistance are shown in Fig. 2.56. In each case, the 
internal resistance becomes part of the circuit. The percentages of error in measure-
ments due to the internal resistances become more pronounced when the circuit 
resistances approach the meters’ internal resistance.
Figure 2.57 shows the actual makeup of a basic analog multimeter. Note that this 
device is overly simplistic; real meters are much more sophisticated, with provisions 
for range selection, ac measurements, and so on. At any rate, it shows you that the 
meters are nonideal due to the sample current required to drive the galvanometer’s 
needle.

Chapter 2: Theory    67
2.15  Combining Batteries
The two battery networks in Fig. 2.58 show how to increase the supply voltage and/
or increase the supply current capacity. To increase the supply voltage, batteries are 
placed end to end or in series; the terminal voltages of each battery add together 
to give a final supply voltage equal to the sum from the batteries. To create a sup-
ply with added current capacity (increased operating time), batteries can be placed in 
parallel—positive terminals are joined together, as are negative terminals, as shown in 
Fig. 2.58. The power delivered to the load can be found using Ohm’s power law: P = 
V2/R, where V is the final supply voltage generated by all batteries within the net-
work. Note that the ground symbol shown here acts simply as a 0- V reference, not as 
an actual physical connection to ground. Rarely would you ever connect a physical 
ground to a battery- operated device.
Note: When placing batteries in parallel, it’s important that the voltages and chem-
istry be the same—choose all similar batteries, all fresh. If the voltages are different, 
you can run into problems.
FIGURE 2.57  The heart of this simple analog multimeter is a galvanometer which measures 
current flow IG. Current sent through the galvanometer’s wire leads will generate a magnetic 
field from the coil windings in the center rotor. Since the coil is tilted relative to the N- S align-
ment of the permanent magnet, the rotor will rotate in accordance with the amount of current 
flow. Normally you get full deflection of the needle at extremely low current levels, so you can 
add a parallel resistor to divert current flow away from the galvanometer. The galvanometer can 
also be used as a voltmeter by placing its lead at the point voltages within the circuit. If there is 
a voltage difference at the leads, a current will flow into the galvanometer and move the needle 
in proportion to the voltage magnitude. A series resistor is used to limit current flow and needle 
deflection. A galvanometer can be used to make an ohmmeter, too, provided you place a battery 
in series with it. Again, to calibrate needle deflection, a series resistor RO is used.
FIGURE 2.58

2.16  Open and Short Circuits
The most common problems (faults) in circuits are open circuits and shorts. A short 
circuit in all or part of a circuit causes excessive current flow. This may blow a fuse or 
burn out a component, which may result in an open- circuit condition. An open circuit 
represents a break in the circuit, preventing current from flowing. Short circuits may be 
caused by a number of things—from wire crossing, insulation failure, or solder splatter 
inadvertently linking two separate conductors within a circuit board. An open circuit 
may result from wire or component lead separation from the circuit, or from a compo-
nent that has simply burned out, resulting in a huge resistance. Figure 2.59 shows cases 
of open- and short- circuit conditions. A fuse, symbolized 
, is used in the circuit and 
will blow when the current through it exceeds its current rating, given in amps.
A weird thing about a short circuit, if you consider all components to be ideal in 
nature, is that an infinite current will flow if an ideal voltage source is short- circuited, 
while the voltage across the short goes to zero. Real voltage sources have internal 
resistance, as do the conductors, so the maximum current level is reduced. However, 
there is usually still plenty of current available to do damage.
You can often diagnose a short circuit by noting a burning smell, or by placing 
your hand nearby to sense any components overheating. To prevent short circuits 
from destroying circuits, various protection devices can be used, such as fuses, tran-
sient voltage suppressors, and circuit breakers. These devices sense when too much 
current is flowing, and they will blow or trip, thus creating an open- circuit condition 
to limit excessive current damage.
Example 1: In the series circuit in Fig. 2.60, determine how much current flows 
through the normal circuit (a), then determine how much current flows when there is 
FIGURE 2.59  
FIGURE 2.60  

Chapter 2: Theory    69
a partial short (b), and determine how much current would flow during a full short if 
the 1- A fuse weren’t in place. Assume an internal 3- Ω circuit resistance at the moment 
of a full- short condition.
Answer: a. 11 mA, b. 109 mA, c. 4 A—fuse blows.
Example 2: In the parallel circuit in Fig. 2.61, determine the total current flow in the 
normal circuit (a), the open circuit (b), and the current flow in the short circuit (c). 
Assume the internal resistance of the battery is 0.2 Ω below 3 A, but goes to 2 Ω dur-
ing a short- circuit condition.
Answer: a. 3.4 A, b. 2.3 A, c. 6 A—fuse blows.
Example 3: In the parallel circuit in Fig. 2.62, loads B, C, and D receive no power when 
S2 is closed (assume all other switches are already closed); however, load A receives 
power. You notice the fuse is blown. After replacing the fuse, you close S2 with S3 and 
S4 open, and the fuse  doesn’t blow. Closing S3 power on loads B and C has no effect. 
Closing S4 causes B and C to turn off—load D receives no power, either. The fuse is 
blown again. What is the problem?
Answer: Load D has a short in it.
2.17  Kirchhoff’s Laws
Often, you will run across a circuit that cannot be analyzed with simple resistor cir-
cuit reduction techniques alone. Even if you could find the equivalent resistance by 
using circuit reduction, it might not be possible for you to find the individual cur-
rents and voltage through and across the components within the network. Likewise, 
if there are multiple sources, or complex networks of resistors, using Ohm’s law, as 
well as the current and voltage divider equations, may not cut it. For this reason, we 
turn to Kirchhoff’s laws.
FIGURE 2.61  
FIGURE 2.62  

70    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Kirchhoff’s laws provide the most general method for analyzing circuits. These 
laws work for either linear (resistor, capacitors, and inductors) or nonlinear elements 
(diodes, transistors, etc.), no matter how complex the circuit gets. Kirchhoff’s two laws 
are stated as follows.
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (or Loop Rule): The algebraic sum of the voltages around 
any loop of a circuit is zero:
 
V
V
V
Vn

(2.20)
In essence, Kirchhoff’s voltage law is a statement about the conservation of energy. If 
an electric charge starts anywhere in a circuit and is made to go through any loop in 
a circuit and back to its starting point, the net change in its potential is zero.
To show how Kirchhoff’s voltage law works, we consider the circuit in Fig. 2.63. 
We start anywhere we like along the circuit path—say, at the negative terminal of the 
5- V battery. Then we start making a loop trace, which in this case we choose to go 
clockwise, though it  doesn’t really matter which direction you choose. Each time we 
encounter a circuit element, we add it to what we’ll call our ongoing loop equation. To 
determine the sign of the voltage difference, we apply the loop trace rules shown in 
the shaded section of the figure. We continue adding elements until we make it back 
to the start of the loop, at which point we terminate the loop equation with an “= 0.”
As noted, Kirchhoff’s voltage law applies to any circuit elements, both linear and 
nonlinear. For example, the rather fictitious circuit shown here illustrates Kirchhoff’s 
voltage law being applied to a circuit that has other elements besides resistors and dc 
sources—namely, a capacitor, an inductor, and a nonlinear diode, along with a sinusoi-
dal voltage source. We can apply the loop trick, as we did in the preceding example, and 
come up with an equation. As you can see, the expressions used to describe the voltage 
changes across the capacitor, inductor, and diode are rather complex, not to mention the 
solution to the resulting differential equation. You don’t do electronics this way (there 
are tricks), but it nevertheless demonstrates the universality of Kirchhoff’s law.
FIGURE 2.63  

Chapter 2: Theory    71

tion equals the sum of the currents that leave the junction:

(2.21)
Kirchhoff’s current law is a statement about the conservation of charge flow through 
a circuit: at no time are charges created or destroyed.
The following example shows both Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws in action.
Example: By applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the following circuit, find all the unknown 
currents, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, assuming that R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and V0 are known. After 
that, the voltage drops across the resistors V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 can be found using 
Ohm’s law: Vn = InRn.
Answer: To solve this problem, you apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to enough closed 
loops and apply Kirchhoff’s current law to enough junctions that you end up with 
enough equations to counterbalance the unknowns. After that, it is simply a matter 
of doing some algebra. Figure 2.66 illustrates how to apply the laws in order to set up 
the final equations.
In Fig. 2.66, there are six equations and six unknowns. According to the rules of 
algebra, as long as you have an equal number of equations and unknowns, you can 
usually figure out what the unknowns will be. There are three ways we can think of 
to solve for the unknowns in this case. First, you could apply the old “plug and chug” 
FIGURE 2.64  
FIGURE 2.65  

72    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
method, better known as the substitution method, where you combine all the equa-
tions together and try to find a single unknown, and then substitute it back into 
another equation, and so forth. A second method, which is a lot cleaner and perhaps 
easier, involves using matrices. A book on linear algebra will tell you all you need to 
know about using matrices to solve for the unknown.
A third method that we think is useful—practically speaking—involves using 
a trick with determinants and Cramer’s rule. The neat thing about this trick is that 
you do not have to know any math—that is, if you have a mathematical computer 
program or calculator that can do determinants. The only requirement is that you be 
able to plug numbers into a grid (determinant) and press “equals.” We do not want 
to spend too much time on this technique, so we will simply provide you with the 
equations and use the equations to find one of the solutions to the resistor circuit 
problem. See Fig. 2.67a.
FIGURE 2.66  
FIGURE 2.67a  

Chapter 2: Theory    73
For example, you can find ∆ for the system of equations from the resistor problem 
by plugging all the coefficients into the determinant and pressing the “evaluate” 
button on the calculator or computer. See Fig. 2.67b.
Now, to find, say, the current through R5 and the voltage across it, you find ∆I5, then 
use I5 = ∆I5/∆ to find the current. Then you use Ohm’s law to find the voltage. Figure 
2.67c shows how it is done.
To solve for the other currents (and voltages), simply find the other ∆I’s and divide by ∆.
The last approach, as you can see, requires a huge mathematical effort to get a 
single current value. For simplicity, you can find out everything that’s going on in 
the circuit by running it through a circuit simulator program. For example, using 
MultiSim, we get the results in Fig. 2.68:
FIGURE 2.67b  
FIGURE 2.67c  
FIGURE 2.68  
   Doing long calculations is good theoretical 
exercise, but in practice it’s a waste of time.  
A problem such as this only takes a few min-
utes to solve using a simulator. The results 
from simulation:
  V1 = 2.027 V 
I1 = 2.027 A
  V2 = 2.351 V 
I2 = 1.175 A
  V3 = 2.555 V 
I3 = 0.852 A
  V4 = 0.204 V 
I4 = 0.051 A
  V5 = 5.622 V 
I5 = 1.124 A
  V6 = 5.417 V 
I6 = 0.903 A

74    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Plugging the results back into the diagram, you can see Kirchhoff’s voltage and 
current laws in action, as shown in Fig. 2.69. Take any loop, sum the changes in 
voltage across components, and you get 0 (note that the voltages indicated in black 
shadow represent point voltages relative to 0- V reference ground). Also, the current 
that enters any junction will equal the sum of the currents exiting the junction, and 
vice versa—Kirchhoff’s current law.
Now, before you get too gung ho about playing with equations or become lazy by 
grabbing a simulator, you should check out a special theorem known as Thevenin’s 
theorem. This theorem uses some very interesting tricks to analyze circuits, and it 
may help you avoid dealing with systems of equations or having to resort to simula-
tion. Thevenin’s theorem utilizes something called the superposition theorem, which 
we must consider first.
2.18  Superposition Theorem
The superposition theorem is an important concept in electronics that is useful when-
ever a linear circuit contains more than one source. It can be stated as follows:
Superposition theorem: The current in a branch of a linear circuit is equal to the sum of the 
currents produced by each source, with the other sources set equal to zero.
The proof of the superposition theorem follows directly from the fact that 
Kirchhoff’s laws applied to linear circuits always result in a set of linear equations, 
which can be reduced to a single linear equation in a single unknown. This means 
that an unknown branch current can thus be written as a linear superposition of each 
of the source terms with an appropriate coefficient. Be aware that the superposition 
should not be applied to nonlinear circuits.
It is important to make clear what it means to set sources equal to zero when 
interpreting the superposition theorem. A source may be a voltage source or a current 
FIGURE 2.69  

Chapter 2: Theory    75
source. If the source is a voltage source, to set it to zero means that the points in the 
circuit where its terminals were connected must be kept at the same potential. The 
only way to do this is to replace the voltage source with a conductor, thus creating a 
short circuit. If the source is a current source, to set it to zero means to simply remove 
it and leave the terminals open, thus creating an open circuit. A short circuit causes 
the voltage to be zero; an open circuit causes the current to be zero.
In Fig. 2.70, we will analyze the circuit using the superposition theorem. The cir-
cuit contains two resistors, a voltage source, and a current source.
First we remove the current source (create an open circuit at its terminals), as 
shown in Fig. 2.70b. The new current through R2 due to the voltage source alone is 
just VA divided by the equivalent resistance:
 
I
V

This current is called the partial current in branch 2 due to source 1. Next, the voltage 
source is removed and set to zero by replacing it with a conductor (we short it); see 
Fig. 2.70c. The resulting circuit is a current divider, and the resulting partial current 
is given by:
 
I

The superposition theorem is an important tool whose theory makes possible 
complex impedance analysis in linear, sinusoidally driven circuits—a subject we 
will cover a bit later. The superposition is also an underlying mechanism that makes 
possible two important circuit theorems: Thevenin’s theorem and Norton’s theorem. 
These two theorems, which use some fairly ingenious tricks, are much more practical 
to use than the superposition. Though you will seldom use the superposition directly, 
it is important to know that it is the base upon which many other circuit analysis 
tools rest.
FIGURE 2.70  The circuit in (a) can be analyzed using the superposition theorem by considering the simpler circuits in 
(b) and (c).

2.19  Thevenin’s and Norton’s Theorems
2.19.1  Thevenin’s Theorem
Say that you are given a complex circuit such as that shown in Fig. 2.71. Pretend 
that you are only interested in figuring out what the voltage will be across terminals 
A and F (or any other set of terminals, for that matter) and what amount of current 
will flow through a load resistor attached between these terminals. If you were to 
apply Kirchhoff’s laws to this problem, you would be in trouble—the amount of 
work required to set up the equations would be a nightmare, and then after that you 
would be left with a nasty system of equations to solve.
Luckily, a man by the name of Thevenin came up with a theorem, or trick, to 
simplify the problem and produce an answer—one that does not involve “hairy” 
mathematics. Using what Thevenin discovered, if only two terminals are of interest, 
these two terminals can be extracted from the complex circuit, and the rest of the 
circuit can be considered a black box. Now the only things left to work with are these 
two terminals. By applying Thevenin’s tricks (which you will see in a moment), 
you will discover that this black box, or any linear two- terminal dc network, can be 
represented by a voltage source in series with a resistor. (This statement is referred 
to as Thevenin’s theorem.) The voltage source is called the Thevenin voltage VTHEV, and 
the resistance is called the Thevenin resistance RTHEV; together, the two form what is 
called the Thevenin equivalent circuit. From this simple equivalent circuit you can 
easily calculate the current flow through a load placed across its terminals by using 
Ohm’s law: I = VTHEV/(RTHEV + RLOAD).
Note that circuit terminals (black box terminals) might actually not be present in 
a circuit. For example, instead, you may want to find the current and voltage across 
a resistor (RLOAD) that is already within a complex network. In this case, you must 
remove the resistor and create two terminals (making a black box) and then find 
the Thevenin equivalent circuit. After the Thevenin equivalent circuit is found, you 
simply replace the resistor (or place it across the terminals of the Thevenin equivalent 
circuit), calculate the voltage across it, and calculate the current through it by apply-
ing Ohm’s law again: I = VTHEV/(RTHEV + RLOAD). However, two important questions 
remain: What are the tricks? And what are VTHEV and RTHEV?
First, VTHEV is simply the voltage across the terminals of the black box, which can 
be either measured or calculated. RTHEV is the resistance across the terminals of the 
black box when all the dc sources (e.g., batteries) are replaced with shorts, and it, too, 
can be measured or calculated.
FIGURE 2.71  The essence of Thevenin’s theorem.

Chapter 2: Theory    77
As for the tricks, we can generalize and say that the superposition theorem is 
involved. However, Thevenin figured out, using the tricks presented in the following 
example, that the labor involved with applying the superposition theorem (remov-
ing sources one at a time, calculating partial currents, and adding them, etc.) could 
be reduced by removing all sources at once, and finding the Thevenin resistance. An 
example is the best cure. See Fig. 2.72.
2.19.2  Norton’s Theorem
Norton’s theorem is another tool for analyzing complex networks. Like Thevenin’s 
theorem, it takes a complex two- terminal network and replaces it with a simple equiv-
alent circuit. However, instead of a Thevenin voltage source in series with a Thevenin 
resistance, the Norton equivalent circuit consists of a current source in parallel with a 
 resistance—which happens to be the same as the Thevenin resistance. The only new 
trick is finding the value of the current source, which is referred to as the Norton cur-
rent INORTON. In essence, Norton’s theorem is to current sources as Thevenin’s theorem 
FIGURE 2.72  Here’s an example of how Thevenin’s theorem can be used in a voltage divider 
circuit to easily calculate the voltage across and the current flow through an attached load.
First remove the load R3 and open up the terminals of interest (A and B). Then, determine the 
Thevenin voltage VTHEV using Ohm’s law or the voltage divider equation—it’s the open- circuit 
voltage across A and B.
Next, calculate the Thevenin resistance RTHEV across the terminals A and B by replacing the 
dc source (VBAT) with a short and calculating or measuring the resistance across A and B. RTHEV is 
simply R1 and R2 in parallel.
The final Thevenin equivalent circuit is then simply VTHEV in series with RTHEV. The voltage 
across the load and the current through the load (R3) are:

is to voltage sources. Its underlying mechanism, like that of Thevenin’s, is the super-
position theorem.
Figure 2.73 shows how the circuit just analyzed by means of Thevenin’s theorem 
can be analyzed using Norton’s theorem. The Norton current INORTON represents the 
short- circuit current through terminals A and B.
A Norton equivalent circuit can be transformed into a Thevenin equivalent circuit 
and vice versa. The equivalent resistor stays the same in both cases; it is placed in 
series with the voltage source in the case of a Thevenin equivalent circuit and in par-
allel with the current source in the case of the Norton equivalent circuit. The voltage 
for a Thevenin equivalent source is equal to the nonload voltage appearing across the 
resistor in the Norton equivalent circuit. The current for a Norton equivalent source 
is equal to the short- circuit current provided by the Thevenin source.
Examples: Find the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits for everything between 
points A and B for each of the four circuits in Fig. 2.74.
FIGURE 2.73  To find INORTON, first remove load R3 and replace it with a short. Using Ohm’s law, 
and noticing that no current will ideally flow through R2 since it’s shorted, you find the short- 
circuit current, or Norton current, to be:

Next, find the Thevenin resistance—simply use the result from the previous example:
RTHEV = 800 Ω.
The final Norton equivalent circuit can then be constructed. Replacing R3, you can now deter-
mine how much current will flow through R3, using Ohm’s law, or simply applying the current 
divider equation.

Example: Here’s an example where Thevenin’s theorem can be applied a number of 
times to simplify a complex circuit that has more than one source. In essence, you 
create Thevenin subcircuits and combine them. Often this is easier than trying to find 
the whole Thevenin equivalent circuit in one grand step. Refer to Fig. 2.75.

(Recall that we replaced the 5- V source with a

Incorporating this equivalent circuit back into the 
main circuit, as shown in the second circuit down, we 
then determine the Thevenin equivalent circuit for 
everything to the left of c and d. Using Kirchhoff’s 
voltage law and resistors- in- series formulas:
VTHEV (c,d) = 2.5 V − 3.5 V = −1.0 V
(In terms of the diagram, this represents a polarity 
reversal, or simply flipping the battery.)
RTHEV (c,d) = 500 Ω + 1000 Ω = 1500 Ω
(Both sources were shorted to find RTHEV.)

Example: To increase the current capacity, batteries are placed in parallel. If the inter-
nal resistance is 0.2 Ω for each 1.5- V battery, find the equivalent Thevenin circuit. 
Refer to Fig. 2.76.
Answer: RTHEV = 0.04 Ω, VTHEV = 1.5 V. (Apply Thevenin’s theorem in steps.) As you 
can see, the net internal resistance of the Thevenin circuit is much less—a result of 
placing batteries in parallel.
2.20  AC Circuits
A circuit is a complete conductive path through which electrons flow from source to 
load and back to source. As we’ve seen, if the source is dc, electrons will flow in only 
one direction, resulting in a direct current (dc). Another type of source that is fre-
quently used in electronics is an alternating source that causes current to periodically 
change direction, resulting in an alternating current (ac). In an ac circuit, not only 
does the current change directions periodically, the voltage also periodically reverses.
Figure 2.77 shows a dc circuit and an ac circuit. The ac circuit is powered by a sinu-
soidal source, which generates a repetitive sine wave that may vary in frequency from 
a few cycles per second to billions of cycles per second, depending on the application.
The positive and negative swings in voltage/current relative to a zero volt/amp 
reference line simply imply that the electromotive force of the source has switched 
FIGURE 2.76  
FIGURE 2.77  

Chapter 2: Theory    81
directions, causing the polarity of the voltage source to flip, and forcing current to 
change directions. The actual voltage across the source terminals at a given instant in 
time is the voltage measured from the 0- V reference line to the point on the sinusoidal 
waveform at the specified time.
2.20.1  Generating AC
The most common way to generate sinusoidal waveforms is by electromagnetic 
induction, by means of an ac generator (or alternator). For example, the simple ac 
generator in Fig. 2.78 consists of a loop of wire that is mechanically rotated about 
an axis while positioned between the north and south poles of a magnet. As the 
loop rotates in the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it changes, and charges 
are forced through the wire, giving rise to an effective voltage or induced voltage. 
According to Fig. 2.78, the magnetic flux through the loop is a function of the angle of 
the loop relative to the direction of the magnetic field. The resultant induced voltage 
is sinusoidal, with angular frequency ω (radians per second).
Real ac generators are, of course, more complex than this, but they operate under 
the same laws of induction, nevertheless. Other ways of generating ac include using 
a transducer (e.g., a microphone) or even using a dc- powered oscillator circuit that 
uses special inductive and capacitive effects to cause current to resonate back and 
forth between an inductor and a capacitor.
Why Is AC Important?
There are several reasons why sinusoidal waveforms are important in electronics. The 
first obvious reason has to do with the ease of converting circular mechanical motion 
into induced current via an ac generator. However, another very important reason for 
using sinusoidal waveforms is that if you differentiate or integrate a sinusoid, you get 
a sinusoid. Applying sinusoidal voltage to capacitors and inductors leads to sinusoi-
dal current. It also avoids problems on systems, a subject that we’ll cover later. But one 
of the most important benefits of ac involves the ability to increase voltage or decrease 
voltage (at the expense of current) by using a transformer. In dc, a transformer is 
useless, and increasing or decreasing a voltage is a bit tricky, usually involving some 
FIGURE 2.78  Simple ac generator.

82    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
resistive power losses. Transformers are very efficient, on the other hand, and little 
power is lost in the voltage conversion.
2.20.2  Water Analogy of AC
Figure 2.79 shows a water analogy of an ac source. The analogy uses an oscillating 
piston pump that moves up and down by means of a cam mechanism, driven by a 
hand crank.
In the water analogy, water particles, on average, appear to simply swish back 
and forth as the crank is turned. In an ac electrical circuit, a similar effect occurs, 
though things are a bit more complex. One way to envision what’s going on is that 
within a conductor, the drift velocity of the sea of electrons is being swished back and 
forth in a sinusoidal manner. The actual drift velocity and distance over which the 
average drift occurs are really quite small (fractions of millimeter- per- second range, 
depending on conductor and applied voltage). In theory, this means that there is no 
net change in position of an “average” electron over one complete cycle. (This is not 
to be confused with an individual electron’s thermal velocity, which is mostly ran-
dom, and at high velocity.) Also, things get even more complex when you start apply-
ing high frequencies, where the skin effect enters the picture—more on this later.
2.20.3  Pulsating DC
If current and voltage never change direction within a circuit, then from one per-
spective, we have a dc current, even if the level of the dc constantly changes. For 
example, in Fig. 2.80, the current is always positive with respect to 0, though it varies 
periodically in amplitude. Whatever the shape of the variations, the current can be 
referred to as “pulsating dc.” If the current periodically reaches 0, it is referred to as 
“intermittent dc.”
FIGURE 2.79  

Chapter 2: Theory    83
From another perspective, we may look at intermittent and pulsating dc as a com-
bination of an ac and a dc current. Special circuits can separate the two currents into 
ac and dc components for separate analysis or use. There are also circuits that com-
bine ac and dc currents and voltages.
2.20.4  Combining Sinusoidal Sources
Besides combining ac and dc voltages and currents, we can also combine separate 
ac voltages and currents. Such combinations will result in complex waveforms. 
Figure 2.81 shows two ac waveforms fairly close in frequency, and their resultant 
combination. The figure also shows two ac waveforms dissimilar in both frequency 
and wavelength, along with the resultant combined waveform.
FIGURE 2.80  
FIGURE 2.81  (Left) Two ac waveforms of similar magnitude and close in frequency form a composite wave. Note the 
points where the positive peaks of the two waves combine to create high composite peaks: this is the phenomenon of 
beats. The beat note frequency is f2 − f1 = 500 Hz. (Right) Two ac waveforms of widely different frequencies and amplitudes 
form a composite wave in which one wave appears to ride upon the other.

84    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Later we will discover that by combining sinusoidal waveforms of the same 
 frequency—even though their amplitudes and phases may be different—you always 
get a resultant sine wave. This fact becomes very important in ac circuit analysis.
2.20.5  AC Waveforms
Alternating current can take on many other useful wave shapes besides sinusoidal. 
Figure 2.82 shows a few common waveforms used in electronics. The squarewave is 
vital to digital electronics, where states are either true (on) or false (off). Triangular 
and ramp waveforms—sometimes called sawtooth waves—are especially useful in 
timing circuits. As we’ll see later in the book, using Fourier analysis, you can create 
any desired shape of periodic waveform by adding a collection of sine waves together.
An ideal sinusoidal voltage source will maintain its voltage across its terminals 
regardless of load—it will supply as much current as necessary to keep the voltage the 
same. An ideal sinusoidal current source, on the other hand, will maintain its output 
current, regardless of the load resistance. It will supply as much voltage as necessary 
to keep the current the same. You can also create ideal sources of other waveforms. 
Figure 2.83 shows schematic symbols for an ac voltage source, an ac current source, 
and a clock source used to generate squarewaves.
In the laboratory, a function generator is a handy device that can be used to gener-
ate a wide variety of waveforms with varying amplitudes and frequencies.
2.20.6  Describing an AC Waveform
A complete description of an ac voltage or current involves reference to three proper-
ties: amplitude (or magnitude), frequency, and phase.
FIGURE 2.82  
FIGURE 2.83  

Chapter 2: Theory    85
Amplitude
Figure 2.84 shows the curve of a sinusoidal waveform, or sine wave. It demon-
strates the relationship of the voltage (or current) to relative positions of a circular 
rotation through one complete revolution of 360°. The magnitude of the voltage 
(or current) varies with the sine of the angle made by the circular movement with 
respect to the zero point. The sine of 90° is 1, which is the point of maximum cur-
rent (or voltage); the sine of 270° is −1, which is the point of maximum reverse 
current (or voltage); the sine of 45° is 0.707, and the value of current (or voltage) at 
the 45° point of rotation is 0.707 times the maximum current (or voltage).
2.20.7  Frequency and Period
A sinusoidal waveform generated by a continuously rotating generator will gener-
ate alternating current (or voltage) that will pass through many cycles over time. 
You can choose an arbitrary point on any one cycle and use it as a marker—say, for 
example, the positive peak. The number of times per second that the current (or 
voltage) reaches this positive peak in any one second is called the frequency of the 
ac. In other words, frequency expresses the rate at which current (or voltage) cycles 
occur. The unit of frequency is cycles per second, or hertz—abbreviated Hz (after 
Heinrich Hertz).
The length of any cycle in units of time is the period of the cycle, as measured 
from two equivalent points on succeeding cycles. Mathematically, the period is sim-
ply the inverse of the frequency:

The frequency of alternating current (or voltage) in electronics varies over a wide 
range, from a few cycles per second to billions of cycles per second. To make life 
easier, prefixes are used to express large frequencies and small periods. For example: 
1000 Hz = 1 kHz (kilohertz), 1 million hertz = 1 MHz (megahertz), 1 billion hertz = 
1 GHz (gigahertz), 1 trillion hertz = 1 THz (terahertz). For units smaller than 1, as  
in the measurements of period, the basic unit of a second can become millisecond  
(1 thousandth of a second, or ms), microsecond (1 millionth of a second, or µs), 
nanosecond (1 billionth of a second, or ns), and picosecond (1 trillionth of a second, 
or ps).
2.20.8  Phase
When graphing a sine wave of voltage or current, the horizontal axis represents time. 
Events to the right on the graph take place later, while events to the left occur earlier. 
Although time can be measured in seconds, it actually becomes more convenient to 
treat each cycle of a waveform as a complete time unit, divisible by 360°. A conven-
tional starting point for counting in degrees is 0°—the zero point as the voltage or 
current begins a positive half cycle. See Fig. 2.85a.
By measuring the ac cycle this way, it is possible to do calculations and record 
measurements in a way that is independent of frequency. The positive peak voltage 
or current occurs at 90° during a cycle. In other words, 90° represents the phase of the 
ac peak relative to the 0° starting point.
Phase relationships are also used to compare two ac voltage or current waveforms 
at the same frequency, as shown in Fig. 2.85b. Since waveform B crosses the zero 
point in the positive direction after A has already done so, there is a phase difference 
between the two waveforms. In this case, B lags A by 45°; alternatively, we can say 
that A leads B by 45°. If A and B occur in the same circuit, they add together, produc-
ing a composite sinusoidal waveform at an intermediate phase angle relative to the 
individual waveforms. Interestingly, adding any number of sine waves of the same 
frequency will always produce a sine wave of the same frequency—though the mag-
nitude and phase may be unique.
In Fig. 2.85c we have a special case where B lags A by 90°. B’s cycle begins exactly 
one- quarter cycle after A’s. As one waveform passes through zero, the other just 
reaches its maximum value.

Chapter 2: Theory    87
Another special case occurs in Fig. 2.85d, where waveforms A and B are 180° out 
of phase. Here it  doesn’t matter which waveform is considered the leading or lagging 
waveform. Waveform B is always positive when waveform A is negative, and vice 
versa. If you combine these two equal voltage or current waveforms together within 
the same circuit, they completely cancel each other out.
2.21  AC and Resistors, RMS Voltage, and Current
Alternating voltages applied across a resistor will result in alternating current through 
the resistor that is in phase with the voltage, as seen in Fig. 2.86. Given the ac volt-
age and resistance, you can apply Ohm’s law and find the ac current. For example, 
a sinusoidal waveform generated by a function generator can be mathematically 
described by:
 
V(t) = VP sin (2π × f × t) 
(2.24)
where VP is the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage waveform, f is the frequency, 
and t is the time. Using Ohm’s law and the power law, you get the following:

V t

If you graph both V(t) and I(t) together, as shown in Fig. 2.86, you notice that the 
current and the voltage are in phase with each other. As the voltage increases in one 
direction, the current also increases in the same direction. Thus, when an ac source 
is connected to a purely resistive load, the current and voltage are in phase. If the 
FIGURE 2.85  (a) An ac cycle is divided into 360° that are used as a measure of time or phase. (b) When two waves of the 
same frequency start their cycles at slightly different times, the time difference or phase difference is measured in degrees. 
In this drawing, wave B starts 45° (one- eighth cycle) later than wave A, and so lags 45° behind A. (c and d) Two special 
cases of phase difference: In (c) the phase difference between A and B is 90°; in (d) the phase difference is 180°.

load isn’t purely resistive (e.g., has capacitance and inductance), it’s a whole different 
story—more on that later.
To find the power dissipated by the resistor under sinusoidal conditions, we can 
simply plug the sinusoidal voltage expression into Ohm’s power law to get an instan-
taneous power expression:

Expressing voltage, current, and power in an instantaneous fashion is fine, math-
ematically speaking; however, in order to get a useful result, you need to plug in a 
specific time—say, t = 1.3 s. But how often do you need to know that the voltage, 
current, or power are at exactly t = 1.3 s? Better yet, when do you start counting? 
These instantaneous values are typically inconvenient for any practical use. Instead, 
it is more important to come up with a kind of averaging scheme that can be used to 
calculate effective power dissipation without dealing with sinusoidal functions.
Now, you might be clever and consider averaging the sinusoidal voltage or cur-
rent over a complete cycle to get some meaningful value. However, the average turns 
out to be zero—positive and negative sides of waveforms cancel. This may be a bit 
confusing, in terms of power, since the positive- going part of the wave still delivers 
energy, as does the negative- going part. If you’ve ever received a shock from 120- V 
line voltage, you’ll be able to attest to that.
The measurement that is used instead of the average value is the RMS or root 
mean square value, which is found by squaring the instantaneous values of the ac 
voltage or current, then calculating their mean (i.e., their average), and finally taking 
the square root of this—which gives the effective value of the ac voltage or current. 
These effective, or RMS, values don’t average out to zero and are essentially the ac 
equivalents of dc voltages and currents. The RMS values of ac voltage and current 
are based upon equating the values of ac and dc power required to heat a resistive 
element to exactly the same degree. The peak ac power required for this condition 
FIGURE 2.86  

Chapter 2: Theory    89
is twice the dc power needed. Therefore, the average ac power equivalent to a cor-
responding average dc power is half the peak ac power.

For example, a U.S. electric utility provides your home with 60 Hz, 120 VAC (in 
Europe and many other countries it’s 50 Hz, 240V AC). The “VAC” unit tells you 
that the supplied voltage is given in RMS. If you were to attach an oscilloscope to the 
outlet, the displayed waveform on the screen would resemble the following function: 
V(t) = 170 V sin (2π × 60 Hz × t), where 170 V is the peak voltage.
With our new RMS values for voltage and current, we can now substitute them 
into Ohm’s law to get what’s called ac Ohm’s law:
 
VRMS = IRMS × R 
(2.30) ac Ohm’s law
Likewise, we can use the RMS voltage and current and substitute them into Ohm’s 
power law to get what’s called the ac power law, which gives the effective power dis-

Again, these equations apply only to circuits that are purely resistive, meaning 
there is virtually no capacitance and/or inductance. Doing power calculation on cir-
cuits with inductance and capacitance is a bit more complicated, as we’ll see a bit later.
Figure 2.87 shows the relationships between RMS, peak, peak- to- peak and half- 
wave average values of voltage and current. Being able to convert from one type to 
another is important, especially when dealing with component maximum voltage 
and current ratings—sometimes you’ll be given the peak value, other times the 
RMS value. Understanding the differences also becomes crucial when making test

 measurements—see the note on pages 91–92 about making RMS test measurements. 
Most of the time, when dealing with ac voltage you can assume that voltage is 
expressed as an RMS value unless otherwise stated.
Example 1: How much current would flow through a 100- Ω resistor connected across 
the hot and neutral sockets of a 120- VAC outlet? How much power would be dis-
sipated? What would the results be using 1000- Ω, 10,000- Ω, and 100,000- Ω resistors?
Answer:
First, don’t try this with any ordinary resistor; you’d need a power resistor or spe-
cial heating element with a power rating of greater than 144 W! (Also, simply don’t 
attempt attaching a resistor with the outlets powered.) A 1000- Ω resistor plugged into 
the same outlet would dissipate 14.4 W; a 10,000- Ω resistor would dissipate 1.44 W; a 
100,000- Ω resistor would dissipate 0.14 W.
Example 2: What is the peak voltage on a capacitor if the RMS voltage of a sinusoidal 
waveform signal across it is 10.00 VAC?
Answer: VAC means RMS, so VP = 2 × VRMS = 1.414 × 10 V = 14.14 V.
Example 3: A sinusoidal voltage displayed on an oscilloscope has a peak amplitude 
of 3.15 V. What is the RMS value of the waveform?

How much current is flowing through the resistive element? What’s the resistance of

Answer: IRMS = PAVE/VRMS = 200 W/120 VAC = 1.7 A. R = VRMS/IRMS = 120 V/1.7 A = 72 Ω.

MEASURING RMS VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS
There are many digital multimeters that do not measure the RMS value of 
an ac voltage directly. Often the meter will simply measure the peak value 
and calculate the equivalent RMS value—assuming the measured waveform 
is sinusoidal—and then display this value. Analog meters usually measure the 
half- wave average value, but are made to indicate the equivalent RMS.
True RMS multimeters, on the other hand, measure the true RMS value of 
voltages and current, and are especially handy for nonsinusoidal voltage and 
currents. Though relatively expensive, these meters are worth the price. It’s 
important to note that true RMS meters will also include the contribution of 
any dc voltages or current components present along with the ac.
Fortunately, you can still get a fairly accurate idea of the RMS value of a sine 
waveform, knowing one of the other measurements such as the half- wave 
average, peak, or peak- to- peak value. This can be done by calculation, or 
using the table in Fig. 2.89. As you can see, it’s also possible to work out the 
RMS value of a few other symmetrical and regular waveforms, such as square 
and triangular waves, knowing their peak, average, or peak- to- peak values.
An important thing to note when using the table is that you need to know 
the exact basis on which your meter’s measurement is made. For example, 
if your meter measures the peak value, and then calculates and displays the 
equivalent sine wave RMS figure, this means you’ll need to use the table dif-
ferently when compared to the situation where the meter really measures the

2.22  Mains Power
In the United States, three wires run from the pole transformers (or underground or 
surface enclosed transformer) to the main service panel at one’s home. One wire is the 
A- phase wire (usually black in color), another is the B- phase wire (usually black in 
color), and the third is the neutral wire (white in color). Figure 2.90 shows where these 
three wires originate from the pole transformer. The voltage between the A- phase and 
the B- phase wires, or the hot- to- hot voltage, is 240 V, while the voltage between the 
neutral wire and either the A- phase or the B- phase wire, or the neutral- to- hot voltage, 
is 120 V. (These voltages are nominal and may vary from region to region, say 117 V 
instead of 120 V.)
At the home, the three wires from the pole/green box transformer are connected 
through a wattmeter and then enter a main service panel that is grounded to a 
long copper rod driven into the ground or to the steel in a home’s foundation. The 
A- phase and B- phase wires that enter the main panel are connected through a main 
disconnect breaker, while the neutral wire is connected to a terminal referred to as the 
neutral bar or neutral bus. A ground bar also may be present within the main service 
panel. The ground bar is connected to the grounding rod or to the foundation’s steel 
supports.
Within the main service panel, the neutral bar and the ground bar are connected 
together (they act as one). However, within subpanels (service panels that get their 
power from the main service panel but which are located some distance from the 
main service panel), the neutral and ground bars are not joined together. Instead, the 
subpanel’s ground bar receives a ground wire from the main services panel. Often 
the metal conduit that is used to transport the wires from the main service panel to 
the subpanel is used as the ground wire. However, for certain critical applications 
(e.g., computer and life- support systems), the ground wire probably will be included 
within the conduit. Also, if a subpanel is not located in the same building as the main 
half-wave average and calculates the sine wave RMS figure from that. So take 
care, especially if you’re not sure exactly how your meter works.

panel, a new ground rod typically is used to ground the subpanel. Note that different 
regions within the United States may use different wiring protocols. Therefore, do 
not assume that what we are telling you is standard practice where you live. Contact 
your local electrical inspector.
Within the main service panel, there are typically two bus bars into which circuit 
breaker modules are inserted. One of these bus bars is connected to the A- phase wire; 
the other bus bar is connected to the B- phase wire. To power a group of 120- V loads 
(e.g., upstairs lights and 120- V outlets), you throw the main breaker to the off posi-
tion and then insert a single- pole breaker into one of the bus bars. (You can choose 
either the A- phase bus bar or the B- phase bus bar. The choice of which bus bar you 
use becomes important only when it comes to balancing the overall load—more on 
that in a moment.) Next, you take a 120- V three- wire cable and connect the cable’s 
black (hot) wire to the breaker, connect the cable’s white (neutral) wire to the neutral 
bar, and connect the cable’s ground wire (green or bare) to the ground bar. You then 
run the cable to where the 120- V loads are located, connect the hot and neutral wires 
across the load, and fasten the ground wire to the case of the load (typically a ground 
screw is supplied on an outlet mounting or light figure for this purpose). To power 
other 120- V loads that use their own breakers, you basically do the same thing you 
did in the last setup. However, to maximize the capacity of the main panel (or sub-
panel) to supply as much current as possible without overloading the main circuit 
breaker in the process, it is important to balance the total load current connected to 
the A- phase breakers with the total load current connected to the B- phase breakers. 
This is referred to as “balancing the load.”
Now, if you want to supply power to 240- V appliances (ovens, washers, etc.), you 
insert a double- pole breaker between the A- phase and B- phase bus bars in the main (or 
subpanel). Next, you take a 240- V three- wire cable and attach one of its hot wires to the 
A- phase terminal of the breaker and attach its other hot wire to the B- phase terminal 
of the breaker. The ground wire (green or bare) is connected to the ground bar. You 
then run the cable to where the 240- V loads are located and attach the wires to the cor-
responding terminals of the load (typically within a 240- V outlet). Also, 120- V/240- V 
appliances are wired in a similar manner, except you use a four- wire cable that contains 
an additional neutral (white) wire that is joined at the neutral bar within the main 
panel (or subpanel).
In addition, in many places, modifications to mains wiring must be carried out 
or checked by a certified electrician. As a note of caution, do not attempt home wir-
ing unless you are sure of your abilities. If you feel that you are capable, just make 
sure to flip the main breaker off before you start work within the main service panel. 
When working on light fixtures, switches, and outlets that are connected to an indi-
vidual breaker, tag the breaker with tape so that you do not mistakenly flip the wrong 
breaker when you go back to test your connections.
2.23  Capacitors
If you take two oppositely charged parallel conducting plates separated a small dis-
tance apart by an insulator—such as air or a dielectric such as ceramic—you have 
created what’s called a capacitor. Now, if you apply a voltage across the plates of the 
capacitor using a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.91, an interesting thing occurs. Electrons 

Chapter 2: Theory    95
are pumped out the negative battery terminal and collect on the lower plate, while 
electrons are drawn away from the upper plate into the positive battery terminal. The 
top plate becomes deficient in electrons, while the lower plate becomes abundant in 
electrons.
Very quickly, the top plate reaches a positive charge +Q and the negative plate 
reaches a negative charge −Q. Accompanying the charge is a resultant electric field 
between the plates and a voltage equal to the battery voltage. 
The important thing to notice with our capacitor is that when we remove the 
voltage source (battery), the charge, electric field, and corresponding voltage (pres-
ently equal to the battery voltage) remain. Ideally, this state of charge will be main-
tained indefinitely. Even attaching an earth ground connection to one of the plates— 
doesn’t matter which one—will not discharge the system. For example, attaching an 
earth ground to the negative terminal  doesn’t cause the electrons within that plate to 
escape to the earth ground where neutral charge is assumed. (See Fig. 2.92.)
It might appear that the abundance of electrons would like to escape to the earth 
ground, since it is at a lower potential (neutral). However, the electric field that exists 
within the capacitor acts like a glue; the positive charge on the upper plate “holds” 
onto the abundance of electrons on the negative plate. In other words, the positive 
plate induces a negative charge in the grounded plate.
In reality, a real- life charged capacitor that is charged and removed from the volt-
age source would eventually lose its charge. The reason for this has to do with the 
FIGURE 2.91  
FIGURE 2.92  

96    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
imperfect insulating nature of the gas or dielectric that is placed between the plates. 
This is referred to as leakage current and, depending on the construction of the capaci-
tor, can discharge a capacitor within as little as a few seconds to several hours, if the 
source voltage is removed.
To quickly discharge a capacitor you can join the two plates together with a wire, 
which creates a conductive path for electrons from the negative plate to flow to the 
positive plate, thus neutralizing the system. This form of discharge occurs almost 
instantaneously.
The ratio of charge on one of the plates of a capacitor to the voltage that exists 
between the plates is called capacitance (symbolized C):
 
C
Q
V
=
 
(2.32) Capacitance related 
to charge and voltage
C is always taken to be positive, and has units of farads (abbreviated F). One farad is 
equal to one coulomb per volt:
 
1 F = 1 C/1 V
Devices that are specifically designed to hold charge (electrical energy in the form 
of an electric field) are called capacitors. Figure 2.93 shows various symbols used to 
represent capacitors, along with a real capacitor model that we’ll discuss a bit later.
The equation C = Q/V is a general one; it really  doesn’t tell you why one capacitor 
has a larger or smaller capacitance than another. However, in practice, when you buy 
a capacitor all you’ll be interested in is the capacitance value labeled on the device. (A 
voltage rating and other parameters are important, too, but we’ll talk about them later.) 
Most commercial capacitors are limited to a range from 1 pF (1 × 10−12 F) to 4700 µF (1 × 
10−6 F), with typical values for the first two digits of the capacitance of 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 
27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, 82, 100. (Examples: 27 pF, 100 pF, 0.01 µF, 4.7 µF, 680 µF).
Having a wide range of capacitances allows you to store different amounts of 
charge for a given potential difference, as well as maintaining different potential dif-
ferences for a given charge. With the appropriate capacitor, you can therefore control 
the storage and delivery of charge, or control potential differences.
FIGURE 2.93  

Chapter 2: Theory    97
Example 1: Five volts are applied across a 1000- µF capacitor until the capacitor is fully 
charged. How much charge exists on the positive and negative plates?
Answer: Q = CV = (1000 × 10−6 F)(5 V) = 5 × 10−3 C. This is the charge on the positive 
plate. The charge on the negative plate is the same, but opposite in sign.
Example 2: A 1000- µF capacitor and a 470- µF capacitor are arranged in the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.94, with a 10- V dc supply. Initially, the switch is at position B then 
thrown to position A, and then thrown to position B, and then to position A, and 
finally to position B. Assuming the capacitors have enough time to fully charge or 
discharge during the interval between switches, what is the final voltage across each 
capacitor after the last switch takes place?
Answer: When the switch is thrown from B to A 
the first time, C1 charges to:
Q1 = C1V = (1000 × 10−6 F)(10 V) = 0.01 C
When the switch is then thrown to B, the circuit 
becomes essentially one big capacitor equal to C1 
+ C2 or 1470 µF. Charge will flow from C1 to C2, 
since the system wants to go to the lowest energy 
configuration. The charge on each capacitor is the 
percentage of capacitance to the total capacitance 
for each capacitor multiplied by the initial charge 
on C1 before the switch was thrown to position B:

The voltage at the new equilibrium is:

The rest of the results are obtained in using similar calculations—the final result 
yields 9.0 V, as shown in the graph to the right.
We could be content with this limited knowledge. However, if you want to build 
your own capacitors, as well as understand time- dependent behavior, such as displace-
ment current and capacitive reactance, a deeper understanding of capacitance is needed.
2.23.1  Determining Capacitance
The capacitance of a capacitor is determined by plate area A, plate separation d, and 
insulating material or dielectric. If a voltage V is applied between two parallel plates, 
FIGURE 2.94  

98    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
an electric field equal to E = V/d will be produced. From Gauss’s law, each plate must 
contain an equal and opposite charge given by:
 
Q

d

(2.33)
where ε is the permittivity of the dielectric. Free space (vacuum) has a permittivity 
given by:
 
ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 C2/N ⋅ m2 
(2.34)
The constant εA/d term in the equation is the capacitance,

(2.35)
The relative permittivity of a material referenced to the permittivity in vacuum is 
referred to as the dielectric constant, which is given by:

where C is in farads, A is in meters squared, and d is in meters.
The dielectric constant varies from 1.00059 for air (1 atm) to over 105 for some 
types of ceramic. Table 2.6 shows relative dielectric constants for various materials 
often used in constructing capacitors.
Capacitors often have more than two plates, the alternate plates being connected 
to form two sets, as shown in the lower drawing in Fig. 2.95. This makes it possible 
to obtain a fairly large capacitance in a small space. For a multiple- plate capacitor, we 
use the following expression to find the capacitance:

2.23.2  Commercial Capacitors
Commercial capacitors, like those shown in Fig. 2.95, are constructed from plates 
of foil with a thin solid or liquid dielectric sandwiched between, so relatively large 
capacitance can be obtained in a small unit. The solid dielectrics commonly used are 
mica, paper, polypropylene, and special ceramics.
Electrolytic capacitors use aluminum- foil plates with a semiliquid conducting 
chemical compound between them. The actual dielectric is a very thin film of insulat-
ing material that forms on one set of the plates through electrochemical action when 
a dc voltage is applied to the capacitor. The capacitance obtained with a given area 
in an electrolytic capacitor is very large compared to capacitors having other dielec-
trics, because the film is so thin—much less than any thickness practical with a solid 
dielectric. Electrolytic capacitors, due to the electrochemical action, require that one 
lead be placed at a lower potential than the other. The negative lead (−) is indicated 
on the package, and some surface mount electrolytics mark the positive end. This 
polarity adherence means that, with the exception of special nonpolarized electrolyt-
ics, electrolytic capacitors  shouldn’t be used in ac applications. It is okay to apply a 
superimposed ac signal riding upon a dc voltage, provided the peak voltage  doesn’t 
exceed the maximum dc voltage rating of the electrolytic capacitor.
2.23.3  Voltage Rating and Dielectric Breakdown
The dielectric within a capacitor acts as an insulator—its electrons do not become 
detached from atoms the way they do in conductors. However, if a high enough voltage 
FIGURE 2.95  

100    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is applied across the plates of the capacitor, the electric field can supply enough force 
on electrons and nuclei within the dielectric to detach them, resulting in a breakdown 
in the dielectric. Failed dielectrics often puncture and offer a low- resistance current 
path between the two plates.
The breakdown voltage of a dielectric depends on the dielectric’s chemical com-
position and thickness. A gas dielectric capacitor breakdown is displayed as a spark 
or arc between the plates. Spark voltages are typically given in units of kilovolts per 
centimeter. For air, the spark voltage may range from 100 kV/cm for gaps as narrow 
as 0.005 cm to 30 kV/mm for gaps as wide as 10 cm. Other things that contribute to 
the exact breakdown voltage level are electrode shape, gap distance, air pressure or 
density, the voltage, impurities within the dielectric, and the nature of the external 
circuit (air humidity, temperature, etc.).
Dielectric breakdown can occur at a lower voltage between points or sharp- 
edged surfaces than between rounded and polished surfaces, since electric fields 
are more concentrated at sharp projections. This means that the breakdown voltage 
between metal plates can be increased by buffing the edges to remove any sharp 
irregularities. If a capacitor with a gas dielectric, such as air, experiences break-
down, once the arc is extinguished, the capacitor can be used again. However, if 
the plates become damaged due to the spark, they may require polishing, or the 
capacitor may need to be replaced. Capacitors with solid dielectrics are usually 
permanently damaged if there is dielectric breakdown, often resulting in a short or 
even an explosion.
Manufacturers provide what’s called a dielectric withstanding voltage (dwv), 
expressed in voltage per mil (0.001 in) at a specified temperature. They also provide 
a dc working voltage (dcwv) that takes into account other factors such as tempera-
ture and safety margin, which gives you a guideline to the maximum safe limits of 
dc voltage that can be applied before dielectric breakdown. The dcwv rating is most 
useful in practice.
As a rule of thumb, it is not safe to connect a capacitor across an ac power line 
unless it is designed for it. Most capacitors with dc ratings may short the line. Special 
ac- rated capacitors are available for such tasks. When used with other ac signals, the 
peak value of ac voltage should not exceed the dc working voltage.
2.23.4  Maxwell’s Displacement Current
An interesting thing to notice with our parallel- plate capacitor is that current appears 
to flow through the capacitor as it is charging and discharging, but  doesn’t flow under 
steady dc conditions. You may ask: How is it possible for current to flow through a 
capacitor, ever, if there is a gap between the plates of the capacitor? Do electrons jump 
the gap? As it turns out, no actual current (or electron flow) makes it across the gap, at 
least in an ideal capacitor.
As we calculated a moment ago using Gauss’s law, the charge on an air- filled 
capacitor plate can be expressed in terms of the electric field, area, and permittivity 
of free space:

Chapter 2: Theory    101
Some time ago, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) noted that 
even if no real current passed from one capacitor plate to the other, there was never-
theless a changing electric flux through the gap of the capacitor that increased and 
decreased with the magnitude and direction of the electric flux. (Electric flux for a 
parallel- plate capacitor is approximated by ΦE = EA, while a changing electric flux is 
expressed as dΦE/dt). Maxwell believed the electric flux permeated the empty space 
between the capacitor plates and induced a current in the other plate. Given the state 
of knowledge of electrodynamics at the time, he envisioned a displacement current 
(which he coined) crossing the empty gap, which he associated with a kind of stress 
within the ether (accepted at the time)—the “stress” being electric and magnetic fields. 
(The displacement current helped supply Maxwell with the missing component to 
complete a set of electromagnetic formulas known as Maxwell’s equations.) He asso-
ciated the displacement current with displacements of the ether. With a bit of theoret-
ical reckoning, as well as some help from some experimental data, he came up with 
the following equation, known as the displacement current, to explain how current 
could appear to enter one end of a capacitor and come out the other end.

Maxwell’s displacement expression appears to provide the correct answer, even 
though his notion of the ether has lost favor in the realm of physics. Modern physics 
provides a different model for displacement current than that envisioned by Maxwell 
and his ether. Nevertheless, the results obtained using Maxwell’s equation closely 
correlate with experiment.
As a side note, there also exists a magnetic field due to the displacement current, 
as shown in the drawing on the right in Fig. 2.96. You can calculate the magnetic field 
using what’s called Maxwell’s generalized form of Ampere’s law; however, the size 
of the magnetic field turns out to be so small that it essentially has no practical influ-
ence when compared to the electric field.
However deep you go when trying to explain the physical phenomena within a 
capacitor, such as using Maxwell’s equations or even modern physics, the practical 
equations that are useful in electronics really don’t require such detail. Instead, you 
can simply stick with using the following charge- based model.
FIGURE 2.96  

102    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
2.23.5  Charge- Based Model of Current Through a Capacitor
Though Maxwell’s displacement current provides a model to explain the apparent 
current flow through a capacitor in terms of changing electric fields, it really isn’t 
needed to define capacitor performance. Instead, we can treat the capacitor as a black 
box with two leads, and define some rules relating the current entering and exiting 
the capacitor as the applied voltage across the capacitor changes. We don’t need to 
worry about the complex physical behavior within.
Now, the question remains: how do we determine the rules if we don’t understand 
the complex behavior within? Simple—we use the general definition of capacitance 
and the general definition of current, and combine the two. Though the mathematics 
for doing this is simple, understanding why this makes logical sense is not entirely obvi-
ous. The following parallel- plate example provides an explanation. Refer to Fig. 2.97.
If we work in differentials (small changes), we can rewrite the general expression 
for capacitance as dQ = CdV, where C remains constant (with charge, voltage, or time). 
The general expression for current is I = dQ/dt, which, when combined with the last 
differential expression of capacitance, provides the expression:

(2.40) Apparent current 
“through” capacitor
Looking at Fig. 2.97, a “small” chunk dQ, which is equal to CdVc, enters the right 
plate during dt, while an equal- sized chunk exits the left plate. So a current equal 
to dQ/dt = CdVc/dt enters the left plate while an equal- sized current exits the right 
plate. (Negative electrons flow in the opposite direction.) Even though no actual cur-
rent (or electrons) passes across the gap, Eq. 2.40 makes it appear that it does. After 
our little exercise using differentials, however, we can see that there is really no need 
to assume that a current must flow across the gap to get an apparent current flow 
“through” the capacitor.
Moving on, we can take the capacitor current expression just derived, rearrange 
things, and solve for the voltage across the capacitor:

Chapter 2: Theory    103
It’s important to note that these equations are representative of what’s defined 
as an ideal capacitor. Ideal capacitors, as the equation suggests, have several curious 
properties that are misleading if you are dealing with real capacitors. First, if we 
apply a constant voltage across an ideal capacitor, the capacitor current would be 
zero, since the voltage isn’t changing (dV/dt = 0). In a dc circuit, a capacitor thus acts 
like an open circuit. On the other hand, if we try to change the voltage abruptly, from 
0 to 9 V, the quantity dV/dt = 9 V/0 V = infinity and the capacitor current would have 
to be infinite (see Fig. 2.98). Real circuits cannot have infinite currents, due to resistiv-
ity, available free electrons, inductance, capacitance, and so on, so the voltage across 
the capacitor cannot change abruptly. A more accurate representation of a real capaci-
tor, considering construction and materials, looks like the model shown in Fig. 2.93.
If the equations for an ideal capacitor are screwy, what do we do for real- life calcu-
lations? For the most part, you don’t have to worry, because the capacitor will be sub-
stituted within a circuit that has resistance, which eliminates the possibility of infinite 
currents. The circuit resistance is also usually much greater than the internal resistance 
of the capacitor, so that the internal resistance of the capacitor can typically be ignored. 
In a minute, we’ll see a few resistor- capacitor circuits that will demonstrate this.
FIGURE 2.98  
Under steady- state dc, a capacitor cannot pass cur-
rent. It can only store or discharge charge (which 
it collects from current) when the voltage across 
it changes. Here, when the “charge switch” is 
closed (shorted), the 9- V battery voltage is applied 
instantly across the capacitor. In a real capacitor, 
the capacitor charges up to its maximum value 
practically instantly. But upon closer examination, 
the charge takes time to build up, due to internal  
resistance, meaning the displacement current 
cannot reach infinity. Instead, the current jumps 
to Vbattery/Rinternal and quickly drops exponentially 
as the capacitor reaches full charge, during which 
the voltage rises exponentially until it levels off at 
the applied voltage. The graph to the left shows 
voltage and current curves as the capacitor charges 
up. Note the impossible behavior that an ideal 
treatment of a capacitor introduces.
When the discharge switch is closed, a conduc-
tive path from positive to negative plate is made, 
and charge electrons will flow to the plate with a 
deficiency of electrons. The current that results is in 
the opposite direction as the charging current, but 
resembles it in that it initially peaks to a value of 
Vbattery/Rinternal and decays as the charge neutralizes. 
The voltage drops exponentially in the process.

2.23.6  Capacitor Water Analogy
For those of you who are having problems with the previous explanations of appar-
ent or displacement current, perhaps the following water analogy will help. Take it 
with a grain of salt, however, since what’s going on in a real capacitor isn’t analogous 
in all regards. Refer to Fig. 2.99.
The water capacitor in Fig. 2.99 resembles a tube with a rubber membrane in the 
middle. The rubber membrane is somewhat analogous to the insulator or dielectric of 
a capacitor, while each separate compartment is analogous to each plate of a capacitor. 
If there is no pressure (analogous to voltage) across the water capacitor, each com-
partment contains the same amount of water (analogous to the number of free elec-
trons). However, if pressure is suddenly applied across the water capacitor, the pres-
sure within the top chamber increases, causing the membrane to expand downward, 
displacing water out from the lower chamber. Even though no water from the top 
makes it through the membrane, it appears as though current flows through the water 
capacitor, since the membrane is pushing the water within the lower chamber out. This 
is analogous to displacement current. Increasing the chamber size and altering the 
membrane strength are analogous to changing the capacitance and dielectric strength.
Example 1: A 10- µF capacitor is connected to a 50- mA constant current source. 
Determine the voltage across the capacitor after 10 µs, 10 ms, and 1 s.

(Remember, these examples assume ideal capacitors. If you used real capacitors, the 
results would follow the same trends, but would be limited in current.)
2.23.7  Energy in a Capacitor
Finally, energy cannot be dissipated in an ideal capacitor. (This is not the case for 
real capacitors because of internal resistance, but since the internal resistance is so 
small, that energy lost to heating is often ignored.) Energy can only be stored in 
the electric field (or potential that exists between the plates) for later recovery. The 
energy stored in a capacitor is found by substituting the capacitor current into the 
generalized power law (P = IV), then inserting the resulting power into the defini-
tion of power (P = dE/dt), and solving for E by integration:

2.23.8  RC Time Constant
When a capacitor is connected to a dc voltage source, it will charge up almost instanta-
neously. (In reality, a capacitor has internal resistance, as well as inductance, therefore 
the term “almost”—see Sec. 3.6, on capacitors, for real- life characteristics.) Likewise, a 
charged capacitor that is shorted with a wire will discharge almost instantaneously. 
However, with some resistance added, the rate of charge or discharge follows an 
FIGURE 2.100  

106    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
exponential pattern, as shown in Fig. 2.101. There are numerous applications that 
use controlled charge and discharge rates, such as timing ICs, oscillators, waveform 
shapers, and low- discharge power backup circuits.
For a charging capacitor, the following equations are used.
(You can derive the preceding expressions using Kirchhoff’s law, by summing the 
voltage around the closed loop: VS = RI + (1/C) ∫Idt. Differentiating and solving the 
differential equation, given an initial condition of current equal to V/R, the voltage 
across the resistor = VS, and the voltage across the capacitor VC = 0, you get the solu-
tion: I = (V/R)e−t/RC. The voltages across the resistor and capacitor are simply found by 
plugging the current into the expression for the voltage across a resistor VR = IR and 
the voltage across a capacitor: VC = (1/C) ∫Idt. We’ll discuss solving such circuits in 
detail in the section on transients in dc circuits.)
Theoretically, the charging process never really finishes, but eventually the charg-
ing current drops to an immeasurable value. A convention often used is to let t = RC, 
which makes V(t) = 0.632 VS. The RC term is called the time constant of the circuit and 
is the time in seconds required to charge the capacitor to 63.2 percent of the supply 
voltage. The lowercase tau τ is often used to represent RC: τ = RC. After two time 
constants (t = 2RC = 2τ) the capacitor charges another 63.2 percent of the difference 
between the capacitor voltage at one time constant and the supply voltage, for a total 
change of 86.5 percent. After three time constants, the capacitor reaches 95 percent of 
the supply voltage, and so on, as illustrated in the graph in Fig. 2.101. After five time 
constants, a capacitor is considered fully charged, having reached 99.24 percent of the 
source voltage.

cuit with R = 10 kΩ, and C = 100 µF. Decreasing the resistance 
means the capacitor charges up more quickly and the voltage

Example: An IC uses an external RC charging network to control its timing. The IC 
requires 3.4 V at VIN to trigger its output to switch from high to low, at which time 
an internal transistor (switch) is activated, allowing the capacitor to be discharged to 
ground. If a 5- s timing period before the trigger point is required, what value of R is

For a discharging capacitor, the following equations are used.

The voltage across the resistor and capacitor is found simply by plugging the current

into the expression for the voltage across a resistor VR = IR and the voltage across a 
capacitor: VC = (1/C) ∫Idt. We’ll discuss solving such circuits in detail in the section 
on transients in dc circuits.)
The expression for a discharging capacitor is essentially the inverse of that for a 
charging capacitor. After one time constant, the capacitor voltage will have dropped 
by 63.2 percent from the supply voltage, so it will have reached 37.8 percent of the sup-
ply voltage. After five time constants, the capacitor is considered fully discharged, it 
will have dropped 99.24 percent, or down to 0.76 percent of the supply voltage.
Example: If a 100- µF capacitor in a high- voltage power supply is shunted by a 100k 
resistor, what is the minimum time before the capacitor is considered fully discharged 
when power is turned off?
Answer: After five time constants, a capacitor is considered discharged:
 
t = 5τ = 5RC = (5)(100 × 103 Ω)(100 × 10−6 F) = 50 s
2.23.9  Stray Capacitance
Capacitance  doesn’t exist only within capacitors. In fact, any two surfaces at different 
electrical potential, and that are close enough together to generate an electric field, 
have capacitance, and thus act like a capacitor. Such effects are often present within 
circuits (e.g., between conductive runs or component leads), even though they are 
not intended. This unintended capacitance is referred to as stray capacitance, and it 
can result in a disruption of normal current flow within a circuit. Designers of electric 
circuits figure out ways to minimize stray capacitance as much as possible, such as 
keeping capacitor leads short and grouping components in such a way as to elimi-
nate capacitive coupling. In high- impedance circuits, stray capacitance may have a 
greater influence, since capacitive reactance (which we will discuss shortly) may be a 
greater portion of the circuit impedance. In addition, since stray capacitance usually 
appears in parallel with a circuit, it may bypass more of the desired signal at higher 
frequencies. Stray capacitance usually affects sensitive circuits more profoundly.
2.23.10  Capacitors in Parallel
When capacitors are placed in parallel, their capacitances add, just like resistors in 
series:
 
Ctot = C1 + C2 + … Cn 
(2.45)
(You derive this formula by applying Kirchhoff’s current law at the top junction, 
which gives Itot = I1 + I2 + I3 + … IN. Making use of the fact that the voltage V is the same 
across C1 and C2, you can substitute the displacement currents for each capacitor into 
Kirchhoff’s current expression as follows:

Chapter 2: Theory    109
Intuitively, you can think of capacitors in parallel representing one single capaci-
tor with increased plate surface area. It’s important to note that the largest voltage 
that can be applied safely to a group of capacitors in parallel is limited to the volt-
age rating of the capacitor with the lowest voltage rating. Both the capacitance and 
the voltage rating are usually included next to the capacitor symbol in schematics, 
but often the voltage rating is missing; you must figure out the rating based on the 
expected voltages present at that point in the circuit.
2.23.11  Capacitors in Series
When two or more capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than 
that of the smallest capacitor in the group. The equivalent capacitance is similar to 
resistors in parallel:

The term in parentheses is called the equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series.)
Capacitors may be connected in series to enable the group to withstand a larger 
voltage than any individual capacitor is rated to withstand (the maximum voltage rat-
ings add). The trade- off is a decrease in total capacitance—though that could be what 
you intend to do, if you can’t find a capacitor or create a parallel arrangement that 
gives you the desired capacitance value. Notice in Fig. 2.104 that the voltage does not 
divide equally between capacitors. The voltage across a single capacitor—say, C2—is 
a fraction of the total, expressed as (Ctotal/C2)VIN. There are various circuits that tap the 
voltage between series capacitors.
Use care to ensure that the voltage rating of any capacitor in the group is not 
exceeded. If you use capacitors in series to withstand larger voltages, it’s a good idea 
to also connect an equalizing resistor across each capacitor. Use resistors with about 
FIGURE 2.104  

110    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
100 Ω per volt of supply voltage, and be sure they have sufficient power- handling 
capability. With real capacitors, the leakage resistance of the capacitor may have more 
effect on the voltage division than does the capacitance. A capacitor with a high par-
allel resistance will have the highest voltage across it. Adding equalizing resistors 
reduces this effect.
Example: (a) Find the total capacitance and maximum working voltage (WV) for 
the capacitor in the parallel network. (b) Find the total capacitance, WV, V1, and V2. 
(c) Find the total capacitance and WV for the network of capacitors. (d) Find the 
value of C that gives a total capacitance of 592 pF with a total WV of 200 V. Individual 
capacitor WV values are in parentheses. Refer to Fig. 2.105.
2.23.12  Alternating Current in a Capacitor
Everything that was discussed about capacitors in dc circuits also applies in ac cir-
cuits, with one major exception. While a capacitor in a dc circuit will block current 
flow (except during brief periods of charging and discharging), a capacitor in an ac 
circuit will either pass or limit current flow, depending on frequency. Unlike a resis-
tor that converts current energy into heat to reduce current flow, a capacitor stores 
electrical energy and returns it to the circuit.
The graph in Fig. 2.106 shows the relationship between current and voltage when 
an ac signal is applied to a capacitor. The ac sine wave voltage has a maximum value 
of 100. In interval 0 to A, the applied voltage increases from 0 to 38 and the capacitor 
charges up to that voltage. In interval AB, the voltage increases to 71, so the capaci-
tor has gained 33 V more. During this interval, a smaller amount of charge has been 
added than 0A, because the voltage rise during AB is smaller than 0A. In interval BC, 
the voltage rises by 21, from 71 to 92. The increase in current in this interval is still 
smaller. In interval CD, the voltage increases only 8, and therefore the increase in cur-
rent is also smaller.
If you were to divide the first quarter cycle into a very large number of intervals, 
you’d see that the current charging the capacitor has the shape of a sine wave, just 
like the applied voltage. The current is largest at the start of the cycle and goes to zero 
FIGURE 2.105  
Answers:
(a) 157 µF (35 V)
(b) 0.9 µF (200 V), V1 = 136 V, V2 = 14 V

(d) C = 470 pF (WV > 100 V)

Chapter 2: Theory    111
at the maximum value of voltage, so there is a phase difference of 90° between the 
voltage and the current.
In the second quarter cycle, from time D to H, the applied voltage decreases and 
the capacitor loses its charge. Using the same reasoning as before, it’s apparent that 
the current is small during period DE and continues to increase during the other peri-
ods. The current is flowing against the applied voltage; however, since the capacitor 
is discharging into the circuit, the current flows in the negative direction during this 
quarter cycle.
The third and fourth quarter cycles repeat the events of the first and second, 
respectively, with one difference: the polarity of the applied voltage has reversed, and 
current changes to correspond. In other words, an alternating current flows in the cir-
cuit because of the alternate charging and discharging of the capacitor. As shown in 
the graph in Fig. 2.106, the current starts its cycle 90° before the voltage, so the current 
in a capacitor leads the applied voltage by 90°.
2.23.13  Capacitive Reactance
The amount of charge on a capacitor is equal to the voltage drop across the capaci-
tor times the capacitance (Q = CV). Within an ac circuit, the amount of charge moves 
back and forth in the circuit every cycle, so the rate of movement of charge (current) 
is proportional to voltage, capacitance, and frequency. When the effect of capacitance 
and frequency are considered together, they form a quantity similar to resistance. 
However, since no actual heat is being generated, the effect is termed capacitive reac-
tance. The unit for reactance is the ohm, just as for resistors, and the formula for cal-
culating the reactance of a capacitor at a particular frequency is given by:

(2.47) Capacitive reactance
where XC is the capacitive reactance in ohms, f is the frequency in Hz, C is the capaci-
tance in farads, and π = 3.1416. Often, omega ω is used in place of 2πf, where ω is 
called the angular frequency.
(You can derive this by noting that a sinusoidal voltage source placed across a 
capacitor will allow displaced current to flow through it because the voltage across it 
FIGURE 2.106  

112    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is changing (recall that I = CdV/dt for a capacitor). For example, if the voltage source 
is given by V0 cos (ωt), you plug this voltage into V in the expression for the displace-
ment current for a capacitor, which gives:
 
sin(
)
0
I
C dV
dt
CV
t

ω
Maximum current or peak current I0 occurs when sin (ωt) = −1, at which point I0 = 
ωCV0. The ratio of peak voltage to peak current V0/I0 resembles a resistance in light 
of Ohm’s law, and is given in units of ohms. However, because the physical phenom-
enon for “resisting” is different from that of a traditional resistor (heating), the effect 
is given the name capacitive reactance.)
As the frequency goes to infinity, XC goes to 0, and the capacitor acts like a short 
(wire) at high frequencies; capacitors like to pass current at high frequencies. As the 
frequency goes to 0, XC goes to infinity, and the capacitor acts like an open circuit; 
capacitors do not like to pass low frequencies.
It’s important to note that even though the unit of reactance is the ohm, there is 
no power dissipated in reactance. The energy stored in the capacitor during one por-
tion of the cycle is simply returned to the circuit in the next. In other words, over a 
complete cycle, the average power is zero. See the graph in Fig. 2.106.

are considered ideal in nature. (b) Graph showing the frequency response for real- life capacitors, which takes into account 
the parasitic resistances and inductances present within a real capacitor package. The pointy dips within the graph repre-
sent self- resonance, where the capacitive and inductive reactances cancel and only internal resistance within the capacitor 
package is left. The frequency at which point this occurs is called the self- resonant frequency.

Chapter 2: Theory    113
As you can see, the reactance decreases with an increase in frequency and/or an 
increase in capacitance. The left graph in Fig. 2.107 shows the reactance versus fre-
quency of a capacitor. Real capacitors don’t follow the graph and equation so pre-
cisely, a result of parasitic effects—see “Real Capacitor Models” in Fig. 2.93.
2.23.14  Capacitive Divider
Capacitive dividers can be used with ac input signals or even dc, since the capacitors 
will rapidly reach a steady state. The formula for determining the ac output voltage 
of a capacitive divider is different from the resistive divider, because the series ele-
ment, C1 is in the numerator, not C2, the shunt element. See Fig. 2.108.
Note that the output voltage is independent of the input frequency. However, if 
the reactance of the capacitors is not large at the frequency of interest (i.e., the capaci-
tance is not large enough), the output current capability will be very low.
2.23.15  Quality Factor
Components that store energy, like a capacitor (and as we’ll see, an inductor), may 
be compared in terms of quality factor Q, also known as the merit. The Q of any such 
component is the ratio of its ability to store energy to the sum total of all energy losses 
within the component. Since reactance is associated with stored energy and resis-
tance is associated with energy loss, we can express the quality factor as:
 
Reactance
Resistance
Q
X
R
=
=
 
(2.48)
Q has no units. When considering a capacitor, the reactance (in ohms) is simply the 
capacitive reactance X = XC. (For an inductor, we’ll see that X = XL, where XL is the 
inductive reactance.) R is the sum of all resistances associated with the energy losses 
in the component (in ohms). The Q of capacitors is ordinarily high. Good- quality 
ceramic capacitors and mica capacitors may have Q values of 1200 or more. Small 
ceramic trimmer capacitors may have Q values too small to ignore in some applica-
tions. Microwave capacitors can have poor Q values, 10 or less at 10 GHz or higher.
2.24  Inductors
In the preceding section we saw how a capacitor stored electrical energy in the form 
of an electric field. Another way to store electrical energy is in a magnetic field. 
FIGURE 2.108  

114    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Circular radiating magnetic fields can be generated about a wire any time current 
passes through it. Increasing or decreasing current flow through the wire increases 
and decreases the magnetic field strength, respectively. During such changes in mag-
netic field strength, we encounter a phenomenon known as inductance. Inductance is 
a property of circuits somewhat analogous to resistance and capacitance; however, 
it is not attributed to heat production or charge storage (electric field), but rather it 
is associated with magnetic fields—more specifically, how changing magnetic fields 
influence the free electrons (current) within a circuit. Theoretically, any device capa-
ble of generating a magnetic field has inductance. Any device that has inductance is 
referred to as an inductor. To understand inductance requires a basic understanding 
of electromagnetic properties.
2.24.1  Electromagnetism
According to the laws of electromagnetism, the field of a charge at rest can be rep-
resented by a uniform, radial distribution of electric field lines or lines of force (see 
Fig. 2.110a). For a charge moving at a constant velocity, the field lines are still radial and 
straight, but they are no longer uniformly distributed (see Fig. 2.110b). At the same time, 
the electron generates a circular magnetic field (see Fig. 2.110c). If the charge acceler-
ates, things get a bit more complex, and a “kink” is created in the electromagnetic field, 
giving rise to an electromagnetic wave that radiates out (see Fig. 2.110d and e).
As depicted in Fig. 2.110c, the electric field (denoted E) of a moving electron—or 
any charge for that matter—is, in effect, partially transformed into a magnetic field 
(denoted B). Hence, it is apparent that the electric and magnetic fields are part of 
the same phenomenon. In fact, physics today groups electric and magnetic fields 
together into one fundamental field theory, referred to as electromagnetism. (The work 
of Maxwell and Einstein helped prove that the two phenomena are linked. Today, 
certain fields in physics paint a unique picture of field interactions using virtual 
photons being emitted and absorbed by charges to explain electromagnetic forces. 
Fortunately, in electronics you don’t need to get that detailed.)
FIGURE 2.109  The three cornerstones of electronics are resistance, capacitance, and inductance. Inductance, unlike the 
other two, involves alternations in a circuit’s current and voltage characteristics as a result of forces acting upon free elec-
trons resulting in the creation and collapse of magnetic fields, usually concentrated in a discrete inductor device. Like a 
capacitor, however, inductive effects occur only during times of change, when the applied voltage/current increases or 
decreases with time. Resistance  doesn’t have a time dependency. Can you guess what will happen to the brightness of the 
lamp in each of the circuits in the figure when the switch is closed? What do you think will occur when the switch is later 
opened? We’ll discuss this a bit later.

Chapter 2: Theory    115
The simplest way to generate a magnetic field is to pass a current through a con-
ductor. Microscopically, each electron within a wire should be generating a magnetic 
field perpendicular to its motion. However, without any potential applied across the 
wire, the sheer randomness of the electrons due to thermal effects, collision, and so 
on, cause the individual magnetic fields of all electrons to be pointing in random 
directions. Averaged over the whole, the magnetic field about the conductor is zero 
(see Fig. 2.111a.1). Now, when a voltage is applied across the conductor, free electrons 
gain a drift component pointing from negative to positive—conventional current in 
the opposite direction. In terms of electron speed, this influence is very slight, but it’s 
enough to generate a net magnetic field (see Fig. 2.111a.2). The direction of this field 
is perpendicular to the direction of conventional current flow and curls in a direc-
tion described by the right- hand rule: your right thumb points in the direction of the 
conventional current flow; your finger curls in the direction of the magnetic field. See 
Fig. 2.111b. (When following electron flow instead of conventional current flow, you’d 
use your left hand.)
The magnetic field created by sending current through a conductor is similar in 
nature to the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. (In reality, the magnetic field 
pattern of a permanent bar magnet, in Fig. 2.111c, is more accurately mimicked when 
the wire is coiled into a tight solenoid, as shown in Fig. 2.111e.) The fact that both a 
current- carrying wire and a permanent magnet produce magnetic fields is no coin-
cidence. Permanent magnets made from ferromagnetic materials exhibit magnetic 
closed- loop fields, mainly as a result of the motion of unpaired electrons orbiting 
about the nucleus of an atom, as shown in Fig. 2.112, generating a dipole magnetic 
field. The lattice structure of the ferromagnetic material has an important role of fix-
ing a large portion of the atomic magnetic dipoles in a fixed direction, so as to set 
up a net magnetic dipole pointing from north to south. This microscopic motion of 
FIGURE 2.110  The electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomenon called electromagnetism. Magnetic 
fields appear whenever a charge is in motion. Interestingly, if you move along with a moving charge, the observable mag-
netic field would disappear—thanks to Einstein’s relativity.

FIGURE 2.112  Microscopically, the magnetic field of a permanent magnet is a result of unpaired valence electrons fixed 
in a common direction, generating a magnetic dipole. The fixing in orientation is a result of atomic bonding in the crystal-
line lattice structure of the magnet.

the unpaired electron about the nucleus of the atom resembles the flow of current 
through a loop of wire, as depicted in Fig. 2.111d. (Electron spin is another source of 
magnetic fields, but is far weaker than that due to the electron orbital.)
By coiling a wire into a series of loops, a solenoid is formed, as shown in Fig. 2.111e. 
Every loop of wire contributes constructively to make the interior field strong. In other 
words, the fields inside the solenoid add together to form a large field component that 
points to the right along the axis, as depicted in Fig. 2.111e. By placing a ferromagnetic 
material (one that isn’t initially magnetized) within a solenoid, as shown in Fig. 2.111f, 
a much stronger magnetic field than would be present with the solenoid alone is cre-
ated. The reason for such an increase in field strength has to do with the solenoid’s 
field rotating a large portion of the core’s atomic magnetic dipoles in the direction of 
the field. Thus, the total magnetic field becomes the sum of the solenoid’s magnetic 
field and the core’s temporarily induced magnetic field. Depending on material and 
construction, a core can magnify the total field strength by a factor of 1000.
2.24.2  Magnetic Fields and Their Influence
Magnetic fields, unlike electric fields, only act upon charges that are moving in a 
direction that is perpendicular (or has a perpendicular component) to the direction 
of the applied field. A magnetic field has no influence on a stationary charge, unless 
the field itself is moving. Figure 2.113a shows the force exerted upon a moving charge 
placed within a magnetic field. When considering a positive charge, we use our right 
hand to determine the direction of force upon the moving charge—the back of the 
FIGURE 2.113  Illustration showing the direction of force upon a moving charge in the presence of a fixed magnetic field.

118    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
hand points in the direction of the initial charge velocity, the fingers curl in the direc-
tion of the external magnetic field, and the thumb points in the direction of the force 
that is exerted upon the moving charge. For a negative charge, like an electron, we 
can use the left hand, as shown in Fig. 2.113b. If a charge moves parallel to the applied 
field, it experiences no force due to the magnetic field—see Fig. 2.113c.
In terms of a group of moving charges, such as current through a wire, the net 
magnetic field of one wire will exert a force on the other wire and vice versa (pro-
vided the current is fairly large), as shown in Fig. 2.114. (The force on the wire is 
possible, since the electrostatic forces at the surface of the lattice structure of the wire 
prevent electrons from escaping from the surface.)
Likewise, the magnetic field of a fixed magnet can exert a force on a current- 
carrying wire, as shown in Fig. 2.115.
Externally, a magnet is given a north- seeking (or “north,” for short) and south- 
seeking (or “south,” for short) pole. The north pole of one magnet attracts the south 
pole of another, while like poles repel—see Fig. 2.115b. You may ask how two station-
ary magnets exert forces on each other. Isn’t the requirement that a charge or field must 
be moving for a force to be observed? We associate the macroscopic (observed) force 
with the forces on the moving charges that comprise the microscopic internal magnetic 
dipoles which are, at the heart, electrons in motion around atoms. These orbitals tend 
to be fixed in a general direction called domains—a result of the lattice binding forces.

field. (b) Illustration showing how bar magnets attract and repel.

Chapter 2: Theory    119
Another aspect of magnetic fields is their ability to force electrons within conduc-
tors to move in a certain direction, thus inducing current flow. The induced force is 
an electromotive force (EMF) being set up within the circuit. However, unlike, say, a 
battery’s EMF, an induced EMF depends on time and also on geometry. According to 
Faraday’s law, the EMF induced in a circuit is directly proportional to the time rate of 
change of the magnetic flux through the circuit:

(for a coiled wire of N loops) (2.49)
where ΦM is the magnetic flux threading through a closed- loop circuit (which is equal 
to the magnetic field B dotted with the direction surface area—both of which are vec-
tors, and summed over the entire surface area—as the integral indicates). According 
to the law, the EMF can be induced in the circuit in several ways: (1) the magnitude 
of B can vary with time; (2) the area of the circuit can change with time; (3) the angle 
between B and the normal of A can change with time; (4) any combination of these 
can occur. See Fig. 2.116.
The simple ac generator in Fig. 2.117 shows Faraday’s law in action. A simple 
rotating loop of wire in a constant magnetic field generates an EMF that can be used 
to power a circuit. As the loop rotates, the magnetic flux through it changes with 
time, inducing an EMF and a current in an external circuit. The ends of the loop are 
connected to slip rings that rotate with the loop, while the external circuit is linked to 
the generator by stationary brushes in contact with the slip rings.
A simple dc generator is essentially the same as the ac generator, except that the 
contacts to the rotating loop are made using a split ring or commutator. The result is 
a pulsating direct current, resembling the absolute value of a sine wave—there are no 
polarity reversals.
A motor is essentially a generator operating in reverse. Instead of generating a cur-
rent by rotating a loop, a current is supplied to the loop by a battery, and the torque

120    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
acting on the current- carrying loop causes it to rotate. Real ac generators and motors 
are much more complex than the simple ones demonstrated here. However, they still 
operate under the same fundamental principles of electromagnetic induction.
The circuit in Fig. 2.118 shows how it is possible to induce current within a sec-
ondary coil of wire by suddenly changing the current flow through a primary coil of 
wire. As the magnetic field of the primary expands, an increasing magnetic flux per-
meates the secondary. This induces an EMF that causes current to flow in the second-
ary circuit. This is the basic principle behind how transformers work; however, a real 
transformer’s primary and secondary coils are typically wound around a common 
ferromagnetic core to increase magnetic coupling.
2.24.3  Self- Inductance
In the previous section, we saw how an EMF could be induced in a closed- loop circuit 
whenever the magnetic flux through the circuit changed with time. This phenome-
non of electromagnetic induction is used in a number of mechanisms, such as motors, 
generators, and transformers, as was pointed out. However, in each of these cases, 
the induced EMF was a result of an external magnetic field, such as the primary coil 
FIGURE 2.117  Basic ac generator.
FIGURE 2.118  An induced voltage, or EMF, is generated in the secondary circuit whenever there is a sudden change in 
current in the primary.

Chapter 2: Theory    121
in relation to a secondary coil. Now, however, we will discuss a phenomenon called 
self- induction. As the name suggests, self- induction typically involves a looped wire 
inflicting itself with an induced EMF that is generated by the varying current that 
passes through it. According to Faraday’s law of induction, the only time that our 
loop can self- inflict is when the magnetic field grows or shrinks in strength (as a 
result of an increase or decrease in current). Self- induction is the basis for the induc-
tor, an important device used to store energy and release energy as current levels 
fluctuate in time- dependent circuits.
Consider an isolated circuit consisting of a switch, a resistor, and a voltage source, 
as shown in Fig. 2.119. If you close the switch, you might predict that the current flow 
through the circuit would jump immediately from zero to V/R, according to Ohm’s 
law. However, according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, this isn’t 
entirely accurate. Instead, when the switch is initially closed, the current increases 
rapidly. As the current increases with time, the magnetic flux through the loop rises 
rapidly. This increasing magnetic flux then induces an EMF in the circuit that opposes 
the current flow, giving rise to an exponentially delayed rise in current. We call the 
induced EMF a self- induced EMF.
Self- induction within a simple circuit like that shown in Fig. 2.119 is usually so small 
that the induced voltage has no measurable effect. However, when we start incorpo-
rating special devices that concentrate magnetic fields—namely, discrete inductors—
time- varying signals can generate significant induced EMFs. For the most part, unless 
otherwise noted, we shall assume the self- inductance of a circuit is negligible com-
pared with that of a discrete inductor.
2.24.4  Inductors
Inductors are discrete devices especially designed to take full advantage of the effects 
of electromagnetic induction. They are capable of generating large concentrations 
of magnetic flux, and they are likewise capable of experiencing a large amount of 
self- induction during times of great change in current. (Note that self- induction also 
FIGURE 2.119  (a) Circuit is open and thus no current or magnetic field is generated. (b) The moment the circuit is closed, 
current begins to flow, but at the same time, an increasing magnetic flux is generated through the circuit loop. This increas-
ing flux induces a back EMF that opposes the applied or external EMF. After some time, the current levels off, the magnetic 
flux reaches a constant value, and the induced EMF disappears. (d) If the switch is suddenly opened, the current attempts 
to go to zero; however, during this transition, as the current goes to zero, the flux decreases through the loop, thus generat-
ing a forward induced voltage of the same polarity as the applied or external EMF. As we’ll see later, when we incorporate 
large solenoid and toroidal inductors within a circuit, opening a switch such as this can yield a spark—current attempting 
to keep going due to a very large forward EMF.

122    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
exists within straight wire, but it is usually so small that it is ignored, except in special 
cases, e.g., VHF and above, where inductive reactance can become significant.)
The common characteristic of inductors is a looplike geometry, such as a sole-
noid, toroid, or even a spiral shape, as shown in Fig. 2.120. A solenoid is easily con-
structed by wrapping a wire around a hollow plastic form a number of times in a 
tight- wound fashion.
The basic schematic symbol of an air core inductor is given by 
. 
Magnetic core inductors (core is either iron, iron powder, or a ferrite- type ceramic), 
adjustable core inductors, and a ferrite bead, along with their respective schematic 
symbols are shown in Fig. 2.121.
Magnetic core inductors are capable of generating much higher magnetic field den-
sities than air core inductors as a result of the internal magnetization that occurs at 
the atomic level within the core material due to the surrounding wire coil’s magnetic 
field. As a result, these inductors experience much greater levels of self- induction 
when compared to air core inductors. Likewise, it is possible to use fewer turns when 
FIGURE 2.120  Various coil configurations of an inductor—solenoid, toroid, and spiral.
FIGURE 2.121  

Chapter 2: Theory    123
using a magnetic core to achieve a desired inductance. The magnetic core material 
is often iron, iron powder, or a metallic oxide material (also called a ferrite, which is 
ceramic in nature). The choice of core material is a complex process that we will cover 
in a moment.
Air core inductors range from a single loop in length of wire (used at ultrahigh fre-
quencies), through spirals in copper coating of an etched circuit board (used at very 
high frequencies), to large coils of insulated wire wound onto a nonmagnetic former. 
For radio use, inductors often have air cores to avoid losses caused by magnetic hys-
teresis and eddy current that occur within magnetic core–type inductors.
Adjustable inductors can be made by physically altering the effective coil length—
say, by using a slider contact along the uncoated coil of wire, or more commonly by 
using a ferrite, powdered iron, or brass slug screwed into the center of the coil. The 
idea behind the slug- tuned inductor is that the inductance depends on the perme-
ability of the material within the coil. Most materials have a relative permeability 
close to 1 (close to that of vacuum), while ferrite materials have a large relative per-
meability. Since the inductance depends on the average permeability of the volume 
inside the coil, the inductance will change as the slug is turned. Sometimes the slug 
of an adjustable inductor is made of a conducting material such as brass, which has 
a relative permeability near 1, in which case eddy currents flow on the outside of the 
slug and eliminate magnetic flux from the center of the coil, reducing its effective 
area.
A ferrite bead, also known as a ferrite choke, is a device akin to an inverted fer-
rite core inductor. Unlike a typical core inductor, the bead requires no coiling of 
wire (though it is possible to coil a wire around it for increased inductance, but then 
you’ve created a standard ferrite core inductor). Instead, a wire (or set of wires) is 
placed through the hollow bead. This effectively increases the inductance of the 
wire (or wires). However, unlike a standard inductor that can achieve practically 
any inductance based on the total number of coil turns, ferrite beads have a limited 
range over which they can influence inductance. Their range is typically limited to 
RF (radiofrequency). Ferrite beads are often slipped over cables that are known to be 
notorious radiators of RF (e.g., computers, dimmers, fluorescent lights, and motors). 
With the bead in place, the RF is no longer radiated but absorbed by the bead and 
converted into heat within the bead. (RF radiation can interfere with TV, radio, and 
audio equipment.) Ferrite beads can also be placed on cables entering receiving 
equipment so as to prevent external RF from entering and contaminating signals in 
the cable runs.
Inductor Basics
An inductor acts like a time- varying current- sensitive resistance. It only “resists” 
during changes in current; otherwise (under steady- state dc conditions), it passes 
current as if it were a wire. When the applied voltage increases, it acts like a time- 
dependent resistor whose resistance is greatest during times of rapid increase in cur-
rent. On the other hand, when the applied voltage decreases, the inductor acts like 
a time- dependent voltage source (or negative resistance) attempting to keep current 
flowing. Maximal sourcing is greatest during times of rapid decreases in current.
In Fig. 2.122a, when an increasing voltage is applied across an inductor, resulting 
in an increasing current flow, the inductor acts to resist this increase by generating a 

124    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
reverse force on free electrons as a result of an increasing magnetic flux cutting across 
the coils of the solenoid (or crossing through the coil loops). This reverse force on 
free electrons can be viewed as an induced EMF that points in the opposite direction 
of the applied voltage. We deem this induced EMF a reverse EMF, also referred to as 
a back EMF. The result is that the inductor strongly resists during a sudden increase 
in current flow, but quickly loses its resistance once the current flow levels off to a 
constant value.
In Fig. 2.122b, when a decreasing voltage is applied across an inductor, resulting 
in a decreasing current flow, the inductor acts to resist this decrease by generating a 
forward force on free electrons as a result of a decreasing magnetic flux cutting across 
the coils of the solenoid (or crossing through the coil loops). This forward force on free 
electrons can be viewed as an induced EMF that points in the same direction as that 
of the applied voltage (the applied voltage that existed before the sudden change). We 
deem this induced EMF a forward EMF. The result is that the inductor acts like a volt-
age source during a sudden decrease in current flow, but quickly disappears once the 
current flow levels off to a constant value.
Another view of how inductors work is to consider energy transfer. The transfer 
of energy to the magnetic field of an inductor requires that work be performed by a 
voltage source connected across it. If we consider a perfect inductor where there is 
no resistance, the energy that goes into magnetic field energy is equal to the work 
performed by the voltage source. Or, in terms of power, the power is the rate at which 
energy is stored (P = dW/dt). Using the generalized power law P = IV, we can equate 
the powers and see that there must be a voltage drop across an inductor while energy 
is being stored in the magnetic field. This voltage drop, exclusive of any voltage drop 
due to resistance in a circuit, is the result of an opposing voltage induced in the circuit 
while the field is building up to its final value. Once the field becomes constant, the 
energy stored in the magnetic field is equal to the work performed by the voltage 
source.
Figure 2.123 illustrates what occurs when an inductor is energized suddenly as a 
switch is closed.
FIGURE 2.122  

Chapter 2: Theory    125
When an inductor is being energized, we say that elec-
trical energy from an externally applied source is trans-
formed into a magnetic field about the inductor. Only 
during times of change—say, when the switch is thrown, 
and the magnetic field suddenly grows in size—do we 
see inductive behavior that affects circuit dynamics.
In the circuit to the left, when the switch is thrown 
from position B to position A, a sudden change in volt-
age is applied across the inductor, resulting in a sudden 
increase in current flow. Where there was no magnetic 
field, there now is a rapidly growing magnetic field about 
the inductor. The inductor is said to be energizing. The 
expanding magnetic field cuts across its own inductor  
coils, which, by Faraday’s law, exerts a force on free elec-
trons within the coil. The force on these electrons is such  
as to be pointing in the opposite direction as the applied 
voltage. This effective reverse force and the effect it has 
on the free electrons is deemed a reverse EMF—it’s anal-
ogous to a little imaginary battery placed in the reverse 
direction of the applied voltage. (See Fig. 2.123b.) The 
result is that the inductor resists during increases in cur-
rent. After a short while, the current flow through the 
circuit levels off, and the magnetic field stops growing 
and assumes a constant value. With no change in mag-
netic field strength, there is no increase in magnet flux 
through our fixed coils, so there is no more reverse EMF. 
The inductor acts as a simple conductor. Figure 2.123c 
shows the induced voltage and voltage across the resis-
tor as a function of time.
Figure 2.123d shows the resultant current flow 
through the inductor as a result of the resultant volt-
age. Mathematically, the current flow is expressed by 
the following equation:

(You might question what happens if we assume an 
ideal inductor with zero internal resistance R. This is a 
very good  question—one that we’ll discuss when we get 
to defining inductance mathematically.)
In terms of energy, this can be viewed as the electrical 
energy being transformed into magnetic field energy. 
In terms of power, we see that a voltage drop occurs as 
energy is pumped into the magnetic field. (We associate 
the drop with the back EMF.) Once the current levels 
off, no more energy goes into the field; hence, no reverse 
voltage (or voltage drop) is present.
FIGURE 2.123  

126    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Figure 2.124 illustrates what occurs as an inductor is deenergized suddenly by 
opening a switch.
FIGURE 2.124  
When an inductor is being deenergized, we say that the 
magnetic field energy of the inductor is “transformed” 
back into electrical energy. Again, only during times of 
change, which in our case involves a decreasing current 
flow, do we notice effects of induction.
In the circuit to the left, when the switch is thrown from 
position A to B, a sudden change voltage occurs across 
the inductor. The inductor initially opposes this decrease 
by generating a collapsing magnetic field that cuts across 
the inductor coils. According to Faraday’s law, a decreas-
ing magnetic flux passes through the loops of the induc-
tor, thus imparting a force upon free electrons within the 
coil in the same direction the applied voltage was pointing 
right before the switch occurred. Since the force is in the 
same direction, we deem the effect a forward EMF. Hence, 
the inductor sources current when attempts are made to 
decrease current flow. The energy for it to do so comes 
from the magnetic field, whose energy drops in proportion 
to the electrical energy delivered to the circuit. See 2.124(b).
Part (c) shows the resultant voltage across an inductor 
adding the applied voltage to the inducted voltage.
Part (d) shows the resultant current flow through the 
inductor as a result of the resultant voltage.
Mathematically, the current flow is expressed by the fol-
lowing equation:

(Again, you might question what happens if we assume 
an ideal inductor with zero internal resistance R. This is a 
very good question—one that we’ll discuss when we get to 
defining inductance mathematically.)
Note: We must assume that when the switch is thrown 
from A to B, the transition occurs instantaneously. We’ll 
see in a moment that when a physical break occurs, cut-
ting current flow through an inductive circuit, the col-
lapsing magnetic field can be large enough to generate an 
EMF capable of causing a spark to jump between the break 
points (i.e., switch contacts).

Chapter 2: Theory    127
2.24.5  Inductor Water Analogy
The property of inductance in electric circuits is closely analogous to mass inertia in 
mechanical systems. For example, the property of an inductor resisting any sudden 
changes in current flow (increasing or decreasing) is similar to a mass on a spinning 
wheel resisting any change in motion (increasing or decreasing in speed). In the follow-
ing water analogy, we take this mass analogy to heart, incorporating a water  turbine/ 
flywheel device to represent a “water inductor.”
To start, we consider a basic electrical inductor circuit, as shown to the left in 
Fig. 2.125. The field generated by a suddenly applied voltage creates a reverse induced 
voltage of opposite polarity that initially “resists” current flow. Quickly, depending 
on the inductance value, the reverse voltage disappears as the magnetic field becomes 
constant, at which point it has reached a maximum strength and energy. A collaps-
ing field generated when the applied voltage is removed creates a forward induced 
voltage that attempts to keep current flowing. Quickly, depending on the inductance 
value, the forward voltage disappears and the magnetic field goes to zero.
In the water analogy, the turbine with attached flywheel resists any sudden 
changes in current flow. If water pressure is suddenly applied, the turbine initially 
resists water flow due to its mass and that of the attached flywheel. However, the 
pressure exerted over the turbine blades quickly gives rise to mechanical motion. 
Depending on the mass of the flywheel, the time it takes for the flywheel to reach a 
steady angular velocity will vary—a heavier flywheel will require more time (analo-
gous to a high- value inductor requiring more time to reach a constant current after a 
sudden increase in applied voltage). When the flywheel reaches this constant angular 
rotation, the water inductor has maximum rotational momentum and energy. This is 
analogous to the magnetic field strength reaching a constant maximum strength and 
energy when the reverse voltage disappears. If there is any sudden interruption in 
FIGURE 2.125  

128    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
applied pressure—say, by turning the tap to position B- S, as shown in Fig. 2.125—the 
flywheel’s angular momentum will attempt to keep current flowing. This is analo-
gous to the collapsing magnetic field in an inductor inducing a forward voltage.
Example: What will happen when the switches are closed in the following three cir-
cuits? What happens when the switches are later opened? How does the size of the 
inductance and capacitance influence behavior? Refer to Fig. 2.126.
Answer: (a) When the switch is closed in the inductor circuit, the lamp will suddenly 
light up brightly, but then quickly dims out. This is because the moment the switch 
is closed, the inductor has very high impedance to current flow, but quickly loses its 
impedance as the current becomes constant (the magnetic field is no longer expand-
ing). Once constant, the inductor acts like a short, and all current is diverted away 
from the lamp through the inductor. (We assume here that there is sufficient dc inter-
nal resistance in the inductor to prevent excessive current flow. Also, we assume the 
internal dc resistance of the inductor is much smaller than the internal resistance of 
the lamp.) A larger inductance value increases the time it takes for the lamp to dim 
out completely.
(b) When the switch is closed in the capacitor circuit, the opposite effect occurs; 
the lamp slowly builds up in brightness until it reaches maximum illumination. This 
is because when the switch is closed, the capacitor initially has very low impedance 
to current flow during rapid changes in applied voltage. However, as the capaci-
tor charges up, the capacitor’s impedance rises toward infinity, and consequently 
resembles an open circuit—hence, all current is diverted through the lamp. A larger 
capacitance value increases the time it takes for the lamp to reach full brightness.
(c) When the switch is closed in the resistor circuit, free- electron flow throughout 
the system is essentially instantaneous. Aside from small inherent inductance and 
capacitance built into the circuit, there are no time- dependent effects on current flow 
caused by discrete inductance or capacitance. Note that since the voltage source is 
ideal, no matter what value the parallel resistor has, there will always be 12 V across 
the lamp, and hence the brightness of the lamp does not change over time.
2.24.6  Inductor Equations
Conceptually, you should now understand that the amplitude of the induced 
 voltage—be it reverse or forward induced—is proportional to the rate at which the 
FIGURE 2.126  

Chapter 2: Theory    129
current changes, or the rate at which the magnetic flux changes. Quantitatively, we 
can express this relationship by using the following equation:

(2.51) Current through  
an inductor
In Eq. 2.50, the proportionality constant L is called the inductance. This constant 
depends on a number of physical inductor parameters, such as coil shape, number 
of turns, and core makeup. A coil with many turns will have a higher L value than 
one with few turns, if both coils are otherwise physically similar. Furthermore, if 
an inductor is coiled around a magnetic core, such as iron or ferrite, its L value will 
increase in proportion to the permeability of that core (provided circuit current is 
below the point at which the core saturates).
The basic unit of inductance L is the henry, abbreviated H. One henry equals an 
induced voltage of 1 V when the current is varying at a rate of 1 A/s:
 
1 H

Making inductors from scratch is common in electronics, unlike the construction 
of capacitors, which is left almost exclusively to the manufacturers. Though we’ll 
examine how to make inductors in a moment, it’s worth taking a look at some com-
mercial inductors. Note the inductance range, core type, current, and frequency lim-
its listed in Table 2.7.
FIGURE 2.127  The voltage measured across an ideal inductor is the induced voltage, or EMF, 
symbolized VL. When there is a steady- state dc current flow, there is no induced voltage (VL is 
zero) and the inductor resembles a short. As we’ll see, the inductor equations can yield surpris-
ingly unrealistic values, if we don’t consider internal resistance and capacitance inherently pres-
ent within a real inductor.

130    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Typical values for commercial inductors range from fractions of a nanohenry to 
about 50 H. Inductances are most commonly expressed in terms of the following unit 
prefixes:
nanohenry (nH): 
1 nH = 1 × 10−9 H = 0.000000001 H
microhenry (µH): 
1 µH = 1 × 10−6 H = 0.000001 H
millihenry (mH): 
1 mH = 1 × 10−3 H = 0.001 H
Example 1: Rewrite 0.000034 H, 1800 mH, 0.003 mH, 2000 µH, and 0.09 µH in a more 
suitable unit prefix format (1 ≤ numeric value < 1000).
Answer: 34 µH, 1.8 H, 3 µH, 2 mH, and 90 nH.
From another standpoint, inductance can be determined from basic physics prin-
ciples. Theoretically, you can determine the inductance any time by stating that the 
inductance is always the ratio of the magnetic flux linkage (NΦM) to the current:

where N is the total turns and  is the length. The variable A is the cross- sectional area 
of the coil, and µ is the permeability of the material on which the coil is wound. For 
most materials (excluding iron and ferrite materials), the permeability is close to the 
permeability of free space:
 
µ0 = 4π × 10−7 T ⋅ m/A

Inductance varies as the square of the turns. If the number of turns is doubled, the 
inductance is quadrupled. This relationship is inherent in the equation but is often 
overlooked. For example, if you want to double the inductance of a coil, you don’t 
double the turns; rather you make the number of turns 2(or 1.41) times the original 
number of turns, or 40 percent more turns.

Luckily, there are some simple formulas, shown in Fig. 2.129, for air core induc-
tors, as well as for a multiple- wound and a spiral- wound inductor. Note that the 
formulas’ answers will not be in standard form—they assume the results are in units 
of microhenrys.

A 20- turn coil would be close enough in practical work. Since the coil will be 0.75 in 
long, the number of turns per inch will be 19.6/0.75 = 26.1. A #17 enameled wire (or 
anything smaller) can be used. In practice, you wind the required number of turns on 
the form and then adjust the spacing between the turns to make a uniformly spaced 
coil of 0.75 in long.

On the Internet you’ll find a number of free web- based inductor calculators. 
Some are quite advanced, allowing you to input inductance, diameter, and 
length values, and afterward providing you with the required number of 
turns, possible number of layers required, dc resistance of the wire, wire gauge 
to use, and so on. Check these tools out—you can save yourself the trouble of 
doing calculations and looking up wire dimensions and such.
2.24.7  Energy Within an Inductor
An ideal inductor, like an ideal capacitor,  doesn’t dissipate energy, but rather stores 
it in the magnetic field and later returns it to the circuit when the magnetic field col-
lapses. The energy EL stored in the inductor is found by using the generalized power 
law P = IV, along with the definition of power P = dW/dt, and the inductor equation 
V = L dI/dt. By equating the work W with EL we get:

where EL = energy in joules, I = current in amps, and L = inductance in henrys. Note 
that in a real inductor a small portion of energy is lost to resistive heating through the 
inductor’s internal resistance.
2.24.8  Inductor Cores
To conserve space and material, inductors are often wound on a magnetic core mate-
rial, such as laminated iron or a special molded mix made from iron powder or 
ferrite material (iron oxide mixed with manganese, zinc, nickel, and other ingredi-
ents). A magnetic core increases the magnetic flux density of a coil greatly, and thus 
increases the inductance. This is further intensified if the magnetic core is formed into 
a doughnut- shaped toroid. See Fig. 2.130.
FIGURE 2.130  Magnetic core inductors.

134    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The reason a magnetic core is so influential has to do with the magnetiza-
tion that occurs within it as the outer coil passes current. When current is sent 
through the wire coil, a relatively weak magnetic field is set up at its center. 
This magnetic field, which we’ll call the external magnetic field, causes the 
atomic rearrangement of magnetic dipoles (refer to Fig. 2.112) within the core 
material. This realignment is such as to rotate the dipole moments in a common 
direction. As more current is passed through the coil, more and more dipoles 
line up. The core itself is now generating a magnetic field as a result of the 
dipole alignment. The net magnetic field Btotal generated by the whole inductor 
(coil and core) then becomes the sum of the external field (coil) and a term that 
is proportional to the magnetization M present in the core itself, as the external 
field is applied by the coil through the core. Mathematically, this is expressed:
 
Btotal = Bext + µ0M 
(1)
where µ0 is the permeability of free space. The magnetic intensity H due to real 
current in the coil, as opposed to the magnetic intensity generated by atomic 
magnetization of the core, is expressed:
 
H

(2)
This can be further reduced, using the notions of susceptibility and permeabil-
ity (consult a physics book), to:
 
Btotal = µH 
(3)
where µ is the permeability of the core material.
The ratio of magnetic flux density produced by a given core material compared 
to the flux density produced by an air core is called the relative permeability of the 
material µR = µ/µ0. For example, an air core generating a flux density of 50 lines of 
force per square inch can be made to generate 40,000 lines of force per square inch 
with an iron core inserted. The ratio of these flux densities, iron core to air core, or 
the relative permeability is 40,000/50, or 800. Table 2.8 shows permeabilities of some 
popular high- permeability materials.
Problems with Magnetic Cores
When a magnetic core material is conductive (e.g., steel), there is a phenomenon known 
as eddy currents that arise within the core material itself when there is an applied 
magnetic field that is changing. For example, in Fig. 2.131a, when an increasing cur-
rent is supplied through the outer coil, a changing magnetic flux passes through the 
core. This in turn induces a circular current flow within the core material. Eddy cur-
rents that are induced in the core represent loss in the form of resistive heating and 
can be a significant disadvantage in certain applications (e.g., power transformers). 
Eddy current losses are higher in materials with low resistivity.

Chapter 2: Theory    135
To avoid eddy currents, the conductive core (steel, in this case) can be laminated 
together with insulating sheets of varnish or shellac. Current will still be induced in 
the sheets of the core, as shown in Fig. 2.131b, but because the area of the sheets is 
limited, so is the flux change, and therefore so are these currents.
Ferrite materials have quite high intrinsic resistivity compared to, say, steel (10 to 
1,000 Ω- cm for Mn- Zn ferrites; 105 to 107 Ω- cm for Ni- Zn ferrites). Eddy current losses 
are therefore much less of a problem in ferrites, and this is the fundamental reason 
they are used in higher- frequency applications. Powdered iron cores, with their insu-
lating compound present between iron particles, also reduce eddy currents, since the 
path for the eddy current is limited to the powder particle size.
A second difficulty with iron is that its permeability is not constant, but varies 
with the strength of the magnetic field and, hence, with the current in the wind-
ings. (It also varies with temperature.) In fact, at sufficiently high magnetic fields, 
the core will saturate and its relative permeability will drop to a value near unity. 
Not only that, but the magnetic field in the iron depends on the past history of the

current in the winding. This property of remanence is essential in a permanent mag-
net, but in an inductor it gives rise to additional losses, called hysteresis losses. See 
Fig. 2.132.
To avoid loses associated with hysteresis, it is important to not run the core induc-
tor into saturation. This can be accomplished by running the inductor at lower current, 
using a larger core, altering the number of turns, using a core with lower permeability, 
or using a core with an air gap.
It is possible for the eddy current and hysteresis losses to be so large that the 
inductor behaves more like a resistor. Furthermore, there is always some capacitance 
between the turns of the inductor, and under some circumstances an inductor may 
act like a capacitor. (We’ll discuss this a bit later.)
Table 2.9 shows a comparison between the various core inductors.
Example 5: What is the inductance of a 100- turn coil on a powdered iron toroidal core 
with an index of inductance of 20?
FIGURE 2.132  Hysteresis curve showing how the magnetization of the core material does not represent a reversible 
process. At point a, no current is applied through the coil. Along path a- b- c, coil current, and thus H (applied magnetic 
field or magnetizing force), increases, causing the core’s magnetic dipole moments (in this case localized in domains) to 
rotate in proportion. As we approach point c, the core reaches saturation—increasing H causes no appreciable increase 
in M (magnetization or magnetic dipole density of core)—the domain’s dipole moments are aligned as much as possible 
parallel to H. Saturation causes a rapid decrease in permeability. The saturation point of a magnetic core varies with mate-
rial makeup; air and other nonmagnetic materials do not saturate—they have a permeability of 1. As H is decreased, the 
magnetization M does not follow the same path back down, but follows path c- d- e. Notice that when H goes to zero, the 
core remains magnetized. In essence, the core has become a permanent magnet. The term retentivity is used to describe 
this effect, and it presents another set of losses caused by hysteresis. In order to demagnetize the core, a reverse force is 
necessary to overcome the residual magnetism retained by the core. In other words, H must go negative in the opposite 
direction, driving the magnetic domains back into a random orientation. At point e, the core has again reached saturation; 
however, the magnetic dipoles (domains) are now pointing in the opposite direction. To reach saturation in the opposite 
direction again, H must be applied, as shown in path e- f- c. Air cores and other materials with a permeability of 1, such as 
brass and aluminum, are immune to hysteresis effects and losses.

Answer: To solve this you’d have to consult the manufacturer’s data sheets, but 
here we’ll use a FT- 50 with 61- Mix, as shown in the table in Fig. 2.133. Using the 
TABLE 2.9  Comparison of Inductor Cores
Air core
 Relative permeability is equal to 1. The inductance is independent of current- flow 
because air does not saturate. Limited to low inductance values, but can be 
operated at very high frequencies (e.g., RF applications ∼1 GHz).
Iron core
 Permeability is a factor of 1000 greater than for air core, but inductance is highly 
dependent on the current flowing through the coil because the core saturates. 
Chiefly used in power- supply equipment. Highly prone to eddy currents (power 
loss) due to the core’s high conductivity. Losses caused by eddy currents can be 
reduced by laminating the core (cutting it into thin strips separated by insulation, 
such as varnish or shellac. Experience significant power losses due to hysteresis. 
Eddy currents and hysteresis losses in iron increase rapidly as the frequency of ac 
increases. Limited to power- line and audio frequencies up to about 15,000 Hz. Lami-
nated iron cores are useless at radio frequencies.
Powdered iron
 Ground- up iron (powder) mixed with a binder or insulating material reduces eddy 
currents significantly, since the iron particles are insulated from one another. 
Permeability is low compared to iron core due to insulator concentration. Slug- 
tuned inductors, where the slug is powered iron can be made adjustable and 
are useful in RF work, even up to the VHF range. Manufacturers offer a wide vari-
ety of core materials, or mixes, to provide units that will perform over a desired 
frequency range with a reasonable permeability. Toroidal Cores are considered 
self- shielding. Manufacturers provide an inductance index AL for their toroidal 
cores. For powdered- iron toroids, AL provides the inductance in µH per 100 turns 
of wire on the core, arranged in a single layer. Formulas found in Fig. 2.133, and 
example problems 5 and 6 illustrate how to calculate inductance of a powdered-
iron toroidal inductor.
Ferrite
 Composed of nickel- zinc ferrites for lower permeability ranges and of manganese- 
zinc ferrites for higher permeabilities, these cores span the permeability range 
from 20 to above 10,000. They are used for RF chokes and wideband transformers. 
Ferrites are often used, since they are nonconductors and are immune to eddy 
currents. Like powdered-iron toroids, ferrite toroids also have an AL value provided 
by the manufacturers. However, unlike powdered-iron toroids, ferrite AL values are 
given in mH per 1000 turns. Formulas found in Fig. 2.133 and example problems 7 
and 8 illustrate how to calculate inductance of a ferrite toroidal inductor.

The preceding inductor equation (which we derived earlier) has some curious prop-
erties that may leave you scratching your head. For starters, let’s consider the dIL/dt 
term. It represents the rate of change in current through the inductor with time. 
FIGURE 2.133  

Chapter 2: Theory    139
If there is no change in current flow through the inductor, there is no measured volt-
age across the inductor. For example, if we assume that a constant dc current has been 
flowing through an inductor for some time, then dIL/dt is zero, making VL zero as 
well. Thus, under dc conditions the inductor acts like a short—a simple wire.
However, if the current IL is changing with time (increasing or decreasing), dIL/dt 
is no longer zero, and an induced voltage VL is present across the inductor. For exam-
ple, consider the current waveform shown in Fig. 2.134. From time interval 0 to 1s, 
the rate of current change dIL/dt is 1 A/s—the slope of the line. If the inductance L is 
0.1 H, the induced voltage is simply (1 A/s)(0.1 H) = 0.1 V during this time interval—
see the lower waveform. During interval 1s to 2s, the current is constant, making 
the dIL/dt zero and, hence, the induced voltage zero. During interval 2s to 3s, dIL/dt 
is −1 A/s, making the induced voltage equal to (−1 A/s)(0.1 H) = −0.1 V. The induced 
voltage waveform paints the rest of the picture.

From Example 11, notice how the induced voltage grows considerably larger as the 
change in current flow is more abrupt. When the change in current flow is in stantaneous, 
the inductor equation predicts an infinite induced voltage. How can this be?
The answer to this dilemma is explained by the following example. Say you have 
an ideal inductor attached to a 10- V battery via a switch, as shown in Fig. 2.135. The 
moment the switch is closed, according to the inductor equation, dI/dt should be infi-
nite (assuming ideal battery, wires, and coil wire). This means that the induced voltage 
should rise in proportion with the applied voltage, forever, and no current should flow. 
In other words, the reverse voltage should jump to infinity. (See Fig. 135b.) Likewise, 
if the switch is opened, as shown in Fig. 135c, an infinite forward voltage is predicted. 
The answer to this problem is rather subtle, but fundamentally important. As it turns 
FIGURE 2.135  Real inductors never generate infinite induced voltages.

Chapter 2: Theory    141
out, these infinities we predict are never observed in the real world. There is always 
internal resistance within a real inductor as well as internal capacitance (as well as 
internal resistance and capacitance in the rest of the circuit). A realistic model of an 
inductor is shown in Fig. 135d, incorporating internal resistance and capacitance. It is 
these “imperfections” that explain why the predictions are not observed.
As we can see from the last example, ignoring internal resistance can cause con-
ceptual headaches. You may be wondering why someone  didn’t simply create an 
inductor equation that automatically included an internal resistance term. The fact 
of the matter is that we should, especially when considering a simple circuit like that 
shown in Fig. 2.135. However, it is important to define inductance as a unique quan-
tity and associate its effects with changing magnetic field energy alone, not with 
resistive heating within the coil or magnetic core losses, or with distributed capaci-
tance between the coil loops. As it turns out, when you start analyzing more complex 
circuits (say RL circuits and RLC circuits), the discrete resistance present within the 
circuit will keep the inductor equation from freaking out. In more precise circuits, 
knowing the internal resistance of the inductor is critical. A standard practice is to 
represent an inductor as an ideal inductor in series with a resistor RDC, where RDC 
is called the dc resistance of the inductor. More accurate models throw in parallel 
capacitance (interloop capacitance) and parallel resistance (representing magnetic 
core losses), which become important in high- frequency applications.
Before we move on, it should be noted that even though we must assume there is 
internal resistance within an inductor, it is still possible for induced voltages to reach 
surprisingly high values during transient conditions. For example, turning off induc-
tive circuits can lead to some dangerously high voltages that can cause arcing and 
other problems requiring special handling.
Example 12: Suppose you apply a linearly increasing voltage across an ideal 1-H 
inductor. The initial current through the inductor is 0.5 A, and the voltage ramps 
from 5 to 10 V over a 10 ms interval. Calculate the current through the inductor as a 
function of time.

2.24.10  Energizing RL Circuit
When a resistor is placed in series with an inductor, the resistance controls the rate at 
which energy is pumped into the magnetic field of the inductor (or pumped back into 
the circuit when the field collapses). When we consider an RL circuit with a dc supply 
and a switch, as shown in Fig. 2.136, the energizing response that begins the moment 
the switch is closed (t = 0) is illustrated by the voltage and current response curves in 
Fig. 2.136, as well as the equations to the right.
You can derive the expressions for the energizing response of an RL circuit by 
applying Kirchhoff’s law, summing the voltages around the closed loop:

To understand what’s going on within the energizing RL circuit, we first pre-
tend the resistor value is zero. With no resistance, when the switch is closed, the cur-
rent would increase forever (according to Ohm’s law and assuming an ideal voltage 
source), always growing just fast enough to keep the self- induced voltage equal to 
the applied voltage.
But when there is resistance in the circuit, the current is limited—Ohm’s law defines 
the value the current can reach. The reverse voltage generated in L must only equal the 
difference between the applied voltage and the drop across R. This difference becomes 
smaller as the current approaches the final Ohm’s law value. Theoretically, the reverse 
voltage never quite disappears, and so the current never quite reaches the no-inductor 
value. In practical terms, the differences become immeasurable after a short duration.
The time in seconds required for the current to build up to 63.2 percent of the maxi-
mum value is called the time constant, and is equal to L/R. After each time interval 
equal to this constant, the circuit conducts an additional 63.2 percent of the remaining 
current. This behavior is graphed in Fig. 2.137. As is the case with capacitors, after five 
time constants the current is considered to have reached its maximum value.
Example 13: If an RL circuit has an inductor of 10 mH and a series resistor of 10 Ω, 
how long will it take for the current in the circuit to reach full value after power is 
applied?
Answer: Since reaching maximum current takes approximately five time constants, 
t = 5τ = 5 (L/R) = 5 (10 × 10−3 H)/10 Ω = 5.0 × 10−3 s or 5.0 ms.
Note that if the inductance is increased to 1.0 H, the required time increases to 0.5 s. 
Since the circuit resistance  didn’t change, the final current is the same for both cases 
in this example. Increasing inductance increases the time required to reach full cur-
rent. Figure 2.137 shows current response curves for various inductors with the same 
resistance.

2.24.11  Deenergizing RL Circuit
Unlike a capacitor that can store energy in the form of an electric field when an applied 
voltage is cut (say, by means of a switch), an inductor does not remain “charged,” 
or energized, since its magnetic field collapses as soon as current ceases. The energy 
stored in the magnetic field returns to the circuit. Now, when current flow is cut (say, 
by means of a switch), predicting the current flow and voltage drops within an RL cir-
cuit is a bit tricky. We can say that the instant the switch is opened, a rapid collapse of 
the magnetic field induces a voltage that is usually many times larger than the applied 
voltage, since the induced voltage is proportional to the rate at which the field changes. 
The common result of opening the switch in such a circuit is that a spark or arc forms 
at the switch contacts during the instant the switch opens—see Fig. 2.138a. When the 
inductance is large and the current in the circuit is high, large amounts of energy are 
released in a very short time. It is not unusual for the switch contacts to burn or melt 
under such circumstances. The spark or arc at the opened switch can be reduced or 
suppressed by connecting a suitable capacitor and resistor in series across the contacts. 
Such an RC combination is called a snubber network. Transistor switches connected to 
large inductive loads, such as relays and solenoids, also require protection. In most 
cases, a small power diode connected in reverse across the relay coil will prevent field- 
collapse currents from harming the transistor—more on this in a moment.
If the excitation is removed without breaking the circuit, as theoretically dia-
grammed in Fig. 2.138b, the current will decay according to the following waveforms 
and equations.
You can derive the expressions for a deenergizing RL circuit by applying 
Kirchhoff’s law, summing the voltage around the closed loop:

As with the energizing RL circuit, the deenergizing RL circuit current response can be 
modeled in terms of time constants. After five time constants, the inductor is considered 
fully deenergized. Increasing the inductance increases this time, as shown in Fig. 2.139.

Chapter 2: Theory    145
FIGURE 2.139  
FIGURE 2.138  
In A, a break in current flow caused by opening a switch will 
cause a large inductive load’s magnetic field to collapse, thus 
generating a large forward voltage. This voltage can be so big 
that the “electron pressure” between the switch contacts be-
comes so large that electrons escape the metal surface of one 
switch contact and jump toward the other contact. As the lib-
erated electrons make the jump, they collide with airborne 
molecules, causing ionization reactions, which lead to a spark 
discharge across the switch contacts. The current and voltage 
response curves under such conditions are rather complex.
In B, if we remove the applied voltage but prevent a break 
in the circuit by moving the discharge to the ground (switch 
thrown to position B), we get predictable current and voltage

Inductance, be it intended or not, can have a major 
influence on signals. For example, the output sig-
nals across the inductor and resistor in the RL cir-
cuit to the left become increasingly distorted as 
the inductance increases. With a constant 1.0- kHz, 
0–5- V squarewave source, and fixed 10- Ω resistance, 
we increase the inductance and note the changes in 
the waveforms. First we note that the period of the 
squarewave is:
=
=
=
T
f
Period:

Now let’s see how the waveforms change as we 
choose increasing inductance values.
Graph A: Inductance: L = 0.1 mH
Time constant: τ = 0.0001 H/10 Ω = 0.01 ms
Here the RL time constant is 1 percent of the period, 
so the induced voltage spikes are narrow during 
squarewave high- to- low and low- to- high transitions. 
Considering that an inductor is fully energized or deen-
ergized after five time constants or, in this case, 0.05 ms, 
the inductor easily completely energizes and deener-
gizes during a half period of 0.5 ms. The voltage across 
the resistor is slightly rounded at the edges as a result.
Graph B: Inductance: L = 1 mH
Time constant: τ = 0.001 H/10 Ω = 0.1 ms
The RL time constant is 10 percent of the period, 
so induced voltage and the effects of exponen-
tial rise and fall during source voltage transitions  
are clearly visible. To fully energize or deenergize 
requires five time constants, or 0.5 ms, which is exactly 
equal to the half period of the signal. Hence, the mag-
netic field about the inductor is capable of absorbing 
and giving up all its magnetic field energy during each 
consecutive half cycle.
Graph C: Inductance: L = 10 mH
Time constant: τ = 0.01 H/10 Ω = 1 ms
The RL time constant is equal to the period of the 
squarewave. However, since it requires five time con-
stants, or 5 ms, to be fully energized or deenergized, the 
resulting voltages appear linear—you get to see only a 
small portion of the exponential rise or fall. The mag-
netic field about the inductor isn’t able to absorb or give 
up all its energy during a half cycle.
Graph D: Inductance: L = 1 H
Time constant: τ = 1 H/10 Ω = 0.1 s
The RL time constant is 100 times as large as the 
period of the squarewave. Again, to become fully ener-
gized or deenergized requires five time constants, or 
500 times the period. This means that there is practi-
cally no time for the inductor to fully energize or deen-
ergize. Though there is exponential rise and decay, 
practically, you see only the first 1⁄500 portion, which 
appears linear.

2.24.12  Voltage Spikes Due to Switching
Inductive voltage spikes are common in circuits where large inductive loads, such as 
relays, solenoids, and motors, are turned on and off by a mechanical or transistor- like 
switch. Spikes as high as a couple hundred volts are possible, even when the supply 
voltages are relatively small. Depending on the circuit design, these voltage spikes 
can cause arcing, leading to switch contact degradation, or damage to transistor or 
other integrated switching devices. Figure 2.141 shows a diode (a device that acts as a 
one- way gate to current flow) placed across the coil of a relay to provide a “pressure 
release” path for the inductive spike, should the supply voltage circuit be broken.
2.24.13  Straight- Wire Inductance
Every conductor passing current has a magnetic field associated with it and, therefore, 
inductance—the conductor need not be formed into a coil. For example, a straight 
wire has an inductance associated with it. This is attributed to the average alignment 
of magnetic fields of individual free electrons as they obtain a drift component under 
an applied EMF. The inductance of a straight nonmagnetic wire or rod in free space 
is given by:

where L is the inductance in µH, a is the wire radius in inches, b is the length in inches, 
and ln is the natural logarithm.

Skin effects change Eq. 2.56 slightly at VHF (30–300 MHz) and above. As the fre-
quency approaches infinity, the constant 0.75 in the preceding equation approaches 1.
Straight wire inductance is quite small, and is typically referred to as parasitic induc-
tance. We can apply the concept of reactance to inductors, as we did with capacitive 
FIGURE 2.141  

148    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
reactance earlier in this chapter. Parasitic inductive reactance at low frequencies (AF to 
LF) is practically zero. For instance, in our example, at 10 MHz the 0.106- µH inductance 
provides only 6.6 Ω of reactance. However, if we consider a frequency of 300 MHz, the 
inductive reactance goes to 200 Ω—a potential problem. For this reason, when design-
ing circuits for VHF and above it is important to keep component leads as short as 
possible (capacitor leads, resistor leads, etc.). Parasitic inductance in a component is 
modeled by adding an inductor of appropriate value in series with the component 
(since wire lengths are in series with the component).
2.24.14  Mutual Inductance and Magnetic Coupling
When two inductor coils are placed near each other with their axes aligned, the cur-
rent applied through coil 1 creates a magnetic field that propagates through coil 2. 
See Fig. 2.143.
As a result, a voltage is induced in coil 2 whenever the field strength of coil 1 changes. 
The voltage induced in coil 2 is similar to the voltage of self- induction, but since it 
acts upon the external coil 2, it is called mutual induction—the two coils are said to be 
FIGURE 2.142  
FIGURE 2.143  

Chapter 2: Theory    149
in ductively coupled. The closer the coils are together, the greater the mutual in ductance. 
If the coils are farther apart or are aligned off axis, the mutual inductance is relatively 
small—the coils are said to be loosely coupled. The ratio of actual mutual in ductance to 
the maximum possible mutual inductance is called the coefficient of coupling, which is 
usually given as a percentage. The coefficient with air core coils may run as high as 0.6 
to 0.7 if one coil is wound over the other, but much less if the two coils are separated. 
It is possible to achieve near 100 percent coupling only when the coils are wound on 
a closed magnetic core—a scenario used in transformer design. Mutual in ductance 
also has an undesirable consequence within circuit design, where unwanted induced 
voltages are injected into circuits by neighboring components or by external magnetic 
field fluctuations generated by inductive loads or high- current alternating cables.
2.24.15  Unwanted Coupling: Spikes, Lightning, and Other Pulses
There are many phenomena, both natural and man- made, that generate sufficiently 
large magnetic fields capable of inducing voltages in wires leading into and out of 
electrical equipment. A mutual inductance exists between the external source and the 
affected circuit in question. Parallel- wire cables linking elements of electronic equip-
ment consist of long wires in close proximity to each other. Signal pulses can couple 
both magnetically and capacitively from one wire to another. Since the magnetic 
field of a changing current decreases as the square of distance, separating the signal- 
carrying lines diminishes inductive coupling. Unless they are well shielded and fil-
tered, however, the lines are still susceptible to the inductive coupling of pulses from 
other sources. This is often experienced when using a long ground lead for a scope 
probe—external magnetic interference can couple to the ground lead of the probe 
and appear within the displayed signal as unwanted noise. Such coupling between 
external sources and electrical equipment can be quite problematic—even more so 
when the source generates a “burst” in magnetic field strength. Sudden bursts have 
a tendency to induce high- level voltage spikes onto ac and dc power lines, which can 
migrate into the inner circuitry where sensitive components lay prone to damage. 
For example, lightning in the vicinity of the equipment can induce voltages on power 
lines and other conductive paths (even ground conductors) that lead to the equipment 
location. Lightning that may appear some distance away can still induce large spikes 
on power lines that ultimately lead to equipment. Heavy equipment with electrical 
motors can induce significant spikes into power lines within the equipment location. 
Even though the power lines are straight, the powerful magnetic fields of a spike 
source can induce damaging voltages on equipment left plugged in during electrical 
storms or during the operation of heavy equipment that inadequately filters its spikes.
2.24.16  Inductors in Series and Parallel
FIGURE 2.144  

150    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When two or more inductors are connected in series, the total inductance is equal to 
the sum of the individual inductances, provided the coils are sufficiently separated, 
so that coils are not in the magnetic field of one another:
 
Ltot = L1 + L2 + L3+ … + LN 
(2.57) Inductors in series
You can derive the inductors- in- series formula by applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law. 
Taking the voltage drop across L1 to be L1dI/dt and the voltage drop across L2 to be 
L2dI/dt, and across L3 to be L3dI/dt, you get the following expression:

When only two inductors are in parallel, the formula simplifies to Ltot = (L1 × L2)/ 
(L1 + L2).
You derive this by applying Kirchhoff’s current law to the junction, which gives 
I = I1 + I2 + I3, making use of the fact that the voltage V is the same across L1, L2, and L3. 
Thus I1 becomes 1/L1 Vdt

2.24.17  Alternating Current and Inductors
When an alternating voltage is applied to an ideal inductance, the current that 
flows through the inductor is said to lag the applied voltage by 90°. Or if you like, 
the applied voltage leads the current by 90°. (This is exactly the opposite of what  
FIGURE 2.145  

Chapter 2: Theory    151
we saw with capacitors under ac.) The primary cause for the current lag in an inductor  
is due to the reverse voltage generated in the inductance. The amplitude of the reverse 
voltage is proportional to the rate at which the current changes. This can be demon-
strated by the graph in Fig. 2.146. If we start at time segment 0A, when the applied 
voltage is at its positive maximum, the reverse or induced voltage is also at a maxi-
mum, allowing the least current to flow. The rate at which the current is changing is 
the highest, a 38 percent change in the time period 0A. In the segment AB, the current 
changes by only 33 percent, yielding a reduced level of induced voltage, which is in 
step with the decrease in the applied voltage. The process continues in time segments 
BC and CD, the latter producing only an 8 percent rise in current as the applied and 
induced voltage approach zero.
In interval DE, the applied voltage changes direction. The induced voltage also 
changes direction, returning current to the circuit as the magnetic field collapses. The 
direction of this current is now opposite to the applied voltage, which sustains the cur-
rent in the positive direction. As the applied voltage continues to increase negatively, 
the current—although positive—decreases in value, reaching zero as the applied volt-
age reaches its negative maximum. The negative half cycle continues just as did the 
positive half cycle. Thus, we say that within a pure inductive ac circuit, the current 
lags the voltage by 90°.
2.24.18  Inductive Reactance
The amplitude of alternating current in an inductor is inversely proportional to the 
applied frequency. Since the reverse voltage is directly proportional to inductance for 
a given rate of current change, the current is inversely proportional to inductance 
for a given applied voltage and frequency. The combined effect of inductance and 
frequency is called inductive reactance. Like capacitive reactance, inductive reactance 
is expressed in ohms. The inductive reactance is given by the following formula:
 
XL = 2πfL 
(2.59) Inductive reactance
FIGURE 2.146  

152    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
where XL is inductive reactance, π = 3.1416, f is frequency in Hz, and L is inductance 
in henrys. Inductive reactance, in angular form (where ω = 2πf), is equal to:
 
XL = ωL.
You derive the expression for inductive reactance by connecting an inductor to a 
sinusoidal voltage source. To make the calculations more straightforward, we’ll use 
a cosine function instead of a sine function—there is really no difference here. For 
example, if the source voltage is given by V0 cos (ωt), the current through the induc-
tor becomes

the maximum current or peak current through an inductor occurs when sin (ωt) = 1, 
at which point it is equal to:

The ratio of peak voltage to peak current resembles a resistance and has units of 
ohms. However, because the physical phenomenon doing the “resisting” (e.g., reverse 
induced voltage working against forward voltage) is different from a resistor (heat-
ing), the effect is given a new name, inductive reactance:

As ω goes to infinity, XL goes to infinity, and the inductor acts like an open circuit 
(inductors do not like to pass high- frequency signals). However, as ω goes to 0, the XL 
goes to zero (inductors have an easier time passing low- frequency signals and ideally 
present no “resistance” to dc signals).
Figure 2.147 shows a graph of inductive reactance versus frequency for 1- µH, 
10- µH, and 100- µH inductors. Notice the response is linear—increasing the fre-
quency increases the reactance in proportion. However, in real inductors, the reactive 
response is a bit more complicated, since real inductors have parasitic resistance and 
capacitance built in. Figure 2.147 shows a real- life impedance versus frequency graph. 
FIGURE 2.147  

Chapter 2: Theory    153
Notice that when the frequency approaches what is called the resonant frequency, 
the impedance is no longer linear in appearance, but peaks and falls. (This will make 
more sense when we cover resonant circuits a bit later.)
Example 16: What is the reactance of an ideal 100- µH coil with applied frequencies of 
120 Hz and 15 MHz?
Answer:
 120 Hz: XL = 2πfL = 2π(120 Hz)(100 × 10−6 H) = 0.075 Ω
 15 MHz: XL = 2πfL = 2π(15 × 106 Hz)(100 × 10−6 H) = 9425 Ω

By the way, inductive reactance has an inverse called inductive susceptance, given 
by the following expression:

(2.60)
Inductive susceptance uses units of siemens, abbreviated S (S = 1/Ω). It simply tells 
you “how well” an inductor passes current, as opposed to “how bad” it does—as 
reactance implies.
2.24.19  Nonideal Inductor Model
Though the ideal inductor model and associated ideal equations are fundamentally 
important in circuit analysis, using them blindly without consideration of real induc-
tor imperfections, such as internal resistance and capacitance, will yield inaccurate 
results. When designing critical devices, such as high- frequency filters used in radio-
frequency receivers, you must use a more accurate real- life inductor model.
In practice, a real inductor can be modeled by four passive ideal elements: a series 
inductor (L), a series resistor RDC, a parallel capacitor CP, and a parallel resistor RP. 
RDC represents the dc resistance, or the measured resistance drop when a dc current 
passes through the inductor. Manufacturers provide the dc resistance of their induc-
tors on their specification sheets (e.g., 1900 series 100- µH inductor with an RDC of 
0.0065 Ω). RP represents magnetic core losses and is derived from the self- resonant 
frequency f0—the point at which the reactance of the inductor is zero (i.e., the imped-
ance is purely resistive). It can be calculated from the quality factor Q, as we’ll see

in a moment. The parallel resistor limits the simulated self- resonance from rising to 
infinity. CP represents the distributed capacitance that exists between coils and leads 
within the inductor, as shown in Fig. 2.148. When a voltage changes due to ac current 
passing through a coil, the effect is that of many small capacitors acting in parallel 
with the inductance of the coil. The graph in Fig. 2.148 shows how this distributed 
capacitance resonates with the inductance. Below resonance, the reactance is induc-
tive, but it increases as the frequency increases. Above resonance, the reactance is 
capacitive and decreases with frequency.
Inductors are subject to many types of electrical energy losses, however—wire 
resistance, core losses, and skin effect. All electrical conductors have some resistance 
through which electrical energy is lost as heat. Moreover, inductor wire must be sized 
to handle the anticipated current through the coil. Wire conductors suffer additional 
ac losses because alternating current tends to flow on the conductors’ surface. As the 
frequency increases, the current is confined to a thinner layer on the conductor sur-
face. This property is called the skin effect. If the inductor’s core is a conductive mate-
rial, such as iron, ferrite, or brass, the core will introduce additional losses of energy.
2.24.20  Quality Factor
Components that store energy, such as capacitors and inductors, can be described in 
terms of a quality factor Q. The Q of such a component is a ratio of its ability to store 
energy to the total of all energy losses within the component. In essence, the ratio 
reduces to: Q = X/R, where Q is the quality factor (no units), X is the reactance (induc-
tive or capacitive), and R is the sum of all resistance associated with the real energy 
losses within the component, given in ohms.
For a capacitor, Q is ordinarily high, with quality ceramic capacitors obtaining 
values of 1200 or more. Small ceramic trimmer capacitors may have Q values that are 
so small that they  shouldn’t be ignored in certain applications.
The quality factor for an inductor is given by Q = 2πfL/RDC. The Q value for an 
inductor rarely if ever approaches capacitor Q in a circuit where both components 
work together. Although many circuits call for the highest Q inductor obtainable, 
other circuits call for a specific Q, which may, in fact, be very low.
FIGURE 2.148  Inductors exhibit distributed capacitance, as explained in the text. The graph shows how this distributed 
capacitance resonates with the inductance. Below resonance, the reactance is inductive, but it decreases as frequency 
increases. Above resonance, the reactance is capacitive and increases with frequency.

Chapter 2: Theory    155
Inductive Divider
Inductive dividers can be used with ac input signals. A dc input voltage would split 
according to the relative resistances of the two inductors by using the resistive voltage 
divider. The formula for determining the ac output voltage of an inductive divider 
(provided the inductors are separated—that is, not wound on the same core—and 
have no mutual inductance) is shown in Fig. 2.149.
Note that the output voltage is independent of the input frequency. However, if  
the reactance of the inductors is not high at the frequency of operation, (i.e., the 
inductance is not large enough), there will be a very large current drawn by the 
shunt element (L2).
2.24.21  Inductor Applications
Inductors’ basic function in electronics is to store electrical energy in a magnetic 
field. Inductors are used extensively in analog circuits and signal processing, includ-
ing radio reception and broadcasting. Inductors, in conjunction with capacitors and 
other components, can form electric filters used to filter out specific signal frequen-
cies. Two (or more) coupled inductors form a transformer that is used to step up or 
step down an ac voltage. An inductor can be used as the energy storage device in a 
switching regulator power supply—the inductor is charged for a specific fraction of 
the regulator’s switching frequency and discharged for the remainder of the cycle. 
This charge/discharge ratio determines the output- to- input voltage ratio. Inductors 
are also employed in electrical transmission systems, where they are used to inten-
tionally depress system voltages or limit fault current. In this field, they are more 
commonly referred to as reactors.
2.25  Modeling Complex Circuits
As a note, let us tell you that this section is designed to scare you. You may have a 
hard time understanding some parts of this section if you don’t have a decent math 
background. However, this section is worth reading for theoretical footing and, more 
important, because it stresses the need to come up with alternative tricks to avoid the 
nasty math.
Theoretically, given enough parameters, any complex electric circuit can be mod-
eled in terms of equations. In other words, Kirchhoff’s laws always hold, whether our 
circuit consists of linear or nonlinear elements. Linear devices have responses that are 
proportional to the applied signal. For example, doubling the voltage across a resis-
tor doubles the current through it. With a capacitor, doubling the frequency of the 
FIGURE 2.149  

156    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
applied voltage across it doubles the current through it. With an inductor, doubling 
the frequency of voltage across it halves the current through it. We found that we 
could apply the following equations to model resistors, capacitors, and inductors:

In terms of voltage and current sources, we have, up until now, mainly discussed dc 
and sinusoidal sources, which we can express mathematically as:
 
VS = Constant, IS = Constant, VS = V0 sin (ωt), IS = I0 sin (ωt)
If a circuit contains only resistors, capacitors, inductors, and one of these sources, we 
simply apply Kirchhoff’s laws and come up with an equation or set of equations that 
accurately describes how the voltages and currents within our circuit will behave 
with time. Linear dc circuits are described by linear algebraic equations. On the other 
hand, linear time- dependent circuits are described by linear differential equations. The 
time dependence may be a result of a sinusoidal source, or it can simply be a dc 
source that is turned on or off abruptly—this is referred to as a transient.
As an example, if we have a series RLC circuit (see Fig. 2.150) with a dc source VS, 
we can write Kirchhoff’s voltage loop equations as:

This equation isn’t of any practical use at this stage. Mathematically, we need to sim-

thing with respect to time, then rearrange things to look like this:

This is an example of a linear second- order homogeneous differential equation. To 
solve it requires some mathematical tricks and defining initial conditions—at which 
point the switch is turned on or off.

Chapter 2: Theory    157
Now, let’s take the same RLC circuit, but remove the switch and dc supply and 
insert a sinusoidal supply (see Fig. 2.151). The supply is expressed mathematically 
as V0 cos (ωt).

This expression is a linear second- order nonhomogeneous differential equation. To 
find the solution to this equation, you could apply, say, the technique of variation of 
parameters or the method of undetermined coefficients. After the solution for the 
current is found, finding the voltages across the resistor, capacitor, and inductor is a 
simple matter of plugging the current into the characteristic voltage/current equa-
tion for that particular component. However, coming up with the solution for the 
current in this case is not easy because it requires advanced math.
As you can see, things don’t look promising, mathematically speaking. Things 
get even worse when we start incorporating sources that are nonsinusoidal, such as 
a squarewave source or a triangle wave source. For example, how do we mathemati-
cally express a squarewave voltage source? As it turns out, the simplest way is to use 
the following Fourier series:

where V0 is the peak voltage of the squarewave. If we take our RLC circuit and attach

we get:

FIGURE 2.151  

158    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
There are other sources we haven’t considered yet, such as nonsinusoidal nonre-
petitive sources (impulse, etc.). And things, of course, get worse when you consider 
circuits with more than three linear elements. Let’s not forget nonlinear devices, like 
diodes and transistors, which we haven’t even discussed yet.
When circuits get complex and the voltage and current sources start looking weird, 
setting up Kirchhoff’s equations and solving them can require fairly sophisticated 
mathematics. There are a number of tricks used in electronic analysis to prevent the 
math from getting out of hand, but there are situations where avoiding the nasty 
math is impossible. The comments in Fig. 2.152 should give you a feeling for the dif-
ficulties ahead.
FIGURE 2.152  

Chapter 2: Theory    159
In the next section, we’ll discuss complex numbers. Complex numbers, along with 
a concept known as complex impedances, are tricks that we’ll use to avoid setting up 
complex differential equations, at least under special circumstances.
2.26  Complex Numbers
Before we touch upon the techniques used to analyze sinusoidally driven circuits, a 
quick review of complex numbers is helpful. As you will see in a moment, a sinusoi-
dal circuit shares a unique trait with a complex number. By applying some tricks, you 
will be able to model and solve sinusoidal circuit problems using complex numbers 
and the arithmetic that goes with it, and—this is the important part—you will be able 
to avoid differential equations in the process.
A complex number consists of two parts: a real part and an imaginary part. (See 
Fig. 2.153.)
Both a and b are real numbers, whereas i
1
=
− is an imaginary unit, thereby making 
the term ib an imaginary number or the imaginary part of a complex number. In prac-
tice, to avoid confusing i (imaginary unit) with the symbol i (current), the imaginary 
unit i is replaced with a j.
A complex number can be expressed graphically on a complex plane (argand or 
gaussian plane), with the horizontal axis representing the real axis and the vertical 
axis representing the imaginary axis. (See Fig. 2.154.)
FIGURE 2.153  
FIGURE 2.154

(2.62)
Now let’s go a bit further—for the complex number to be useful in circuit analy-
sis, it must be altered slightly. If you replace a with r cos θ and replace b with r sin θ, 
the complex number takes on what is called the polar trigonometric form of a com-
plex number. (See Fig. 2.155.)
Okay, now you are getting there; just one more thing to cover. Long ago, a man by 
the name of Euler noticed that the cos θ + j sin θ part of the trigonometric form of the 
complex number was related to e jθ by the following expression:
 
e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ 
(2.63)
You can prove this by taking the individual power series for e jθ, cos θ, j sin θ. When 
the power series for cos θ and j sin θ are added, the result equals the power series for 
e jθ. This means that the complex number can be expressed as follows:
 
z = re jθ 
(2.64)
This represents the polar exponential form of a complex number. A shorthand ver-
sion of this form can be written as:
 
z = r ∠ θ 
(2.65)
FIGURE 2.155  

Chapter 2: Theory    161
Though this form goes by the name of polar coordinate form and has its basis in add-
ing vectors and angles, and so on, it helps to think of it as a shorthand version of the 
polar exponential form, since it is really no different from the exponential form (same 
arithmetic rules apply), but it turns out to be a bit more intuitive, as well as easier to 
deal with in calculations.
Now we have basically four ways to express a complex number:
 
z = a + jb, z = r cos θ + jr sin θ, z = re jθ, z = r ∠ θ
Each form is useful in its own right. Sometimes it is easier to use z = a + jb, and some-
times it is easier to use z = re jθ (or z = r ∠ θ)—it all depends on the situation, as we’ll 
see in a moment.
The model shown in Fig. 2.156 is designed to help you get a feeling for how the 
various forms of a complex number are related. For what follows, you will need

Notice that when multiplication or division is involved, it is easier to first convert the 
complex terms into exponential form (shorthand version). In essence, for addition 
and subtraction you’ll probably use rectangular form (though trigonometric form 
isn’t difficult in this case), and use exponential (shorthand) form for multiplication 
and division. If you understand the preceding calculation, you should find the ac 
 theory to come easy.

2.27  Circuit with Sinusoidal Sources
Suppose that you are given the two circuits shown in Fig. 2.157 containing linear ele-
ments (resistors, capacitors, inductors) driven by sinusoidal voltage sources.
To analyze the simpler of the two circuits, you could apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law

This expression, as we discovered earlier, is a linear second- order nonhomoge-
neous differential equation. To find the solution to this equation, you could apply, 
say, the technique of variation of parameters or the method of undetermined coeffi-
cients. After the solution for the current is found, finding the voltages across the resis-
tor, capacitor, and inductor is a simple matter of plugging the current into the charac-
teristic voltage/current equation for that particular component. However, coming up 
with the solution for the current in this case is not easy because it requires advanced 
math (and the work is tedious).
Now, as if things were not bad enough, let’s consider the more complex circuit 
in Fig. 2.157. To analyze this mess, you could again apply Kirchhoff’s voltage and 
current laws to a number of loops and junctions within the circuit and then come up 
with a system of differential equations. The math becomes even more advanced, and 
finding the solution becomes ridiculously difficult.
Before we scare you too much with these differential equations, let us tell you about 
an alternative approach, one that does away with differential equations completely. 
FIGURE 2.157  

Chapter 2: Theory    165
This alternative approach makes use of what are called complex  impedances—some-
thing that will use the complex numbers we talked about in the last section.
2.27.1  Analyzing Sinusoidal Circuits with Complex Impedances
To make solving sinusoidal circuits easier, it’s possible to use a technique that enables 
you to treat capacitors and inductors like special kinds of resistors. After that, you 
can analyze any circuit containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors as a “resis-
tor” circuit. By doing so, you can apply all the dc circuit laws and theorems that 
were presented earlier. The theory behind how the technique works is a bit techni-
cal, even though the act of applying it is not hard at all. For this reason, if you do not 
have the time to learn the theory, we suggest simply breezing through this section 
and pulling out the important results. Here’s a look at the theory behind complex 
impedances.
In a complex, linear, sinusoidally driven circuit, all currents and voltages within 
the circuit will be sinusoidal in nature after all transients have died out. These cur-
rents and voltages will be changing with the same frequency as the source voltage 
(the physics makes this so), and their magnitudes will be proportional to the mag-
nitude of the source voltage at any particular moment in time. The phase of the cur-
rent and voltage patterns throughout the circuit, however, most likely will be shifted 
relative to the source voltage pattern. This behavior is a result of the capacitive and 
inductive effects brought on by the capacitors and inductors.
As you can see, there is a pattern within the circuit. By using the fact that the 
voltages and currents will be sinusoidal everywhere, and considering that the fre-
quencies of these voltages and currents will all be the same, you can come up with 
a mathematical trick to analyze the circuit—one that avoids differential equations. 
The trick involves using what is called the superposition theorem. The superposi-
tion theorem says that the current that exists in a branch of a linear circuit that con-
tains several sinusoidal sources is equal to the sum of the currents produced by each 
source independently. The proof of the superposition theorem follows directly from 
the fact that Kirchhoff’s laws applied to linear circuits always result in a set of linear 
equations that can be reduced to a single linear equation with a single unknown. 
The unknown branch current thus can be written as a linear superposition of each of 
the source terms with an appropriate coefficient. (Figure 2.158 shows the essence of 
superimposing of sine waves.)
What this all means is that you do not have to go to the trouble of calculating the 
time dependence of the unknown current or voltage within the circuit because you 
know that it will always be of the form cos (ωt + φ). Instead, all you need to do is 
calculate the peak value (or RMS value) and the phase, and apply the superposition 
 theorem. To represent currents and voltages and apply the superposition theorem, it 
would seem obvious to use sine or cosine functions to account for magnitude, phase, 
and frequency. However, in the mathematical process of superimposing (adding, 
multiplying, etc.), you would get messy sinusoidal expressions in terms of sines and 
cosines that would require difficult trigonometric rules and identities to convert the 
answers into something you could understand. Instead, what you can do to represent 
amplitudes and phase of voltages and currents in a circuit is to use complex numbers.

166    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Recall from the section on complex numbers that a complex number exhibits sinu-
soidal behavior—at least in the complex plane. For example, the trigonometric form of 
a complex number z1 = r1 cos θ1 + jr1 sin θ1 will trace out a circular path in the complex 
plane when θ runs from 0 to 360°, or from 0 to 2π radians. If you graph the real part 
of z versus θ, you get a sinusoidal wave pattern. To change the amplitude of the wave 
pattern, you simply change the value of r. To set the frequency, you simply multiply θ 
by some number. To induce a phase shift relative to another wave pattern of the same 
frequency, you simply add some number (in degrees or radians) to θ. If you replace θ 
with ωt, where (ω = 2πf), replace the r with V0, and leave a place for a term to be added 
to ωt (a place for phase shifts), you come up with an expression for the voltage source 
in terms of complex numbers. You could do the same sort of thing for currents, too.
Now, the nice thing about complex numbers, as compared with sinusoidal func-
tions, is that you can represent a complex number in various ways, within rectangular, 
polar- trigonometric, or polar- exponential forms (standard or shorthand versions). 
Having these different options makes the mathematics involved in the superimpos-
ing process easier. For example, by converting a number, say, into rectangular form, 
you can easily add or subtract terms. By converting the number into polar- exponential 
FIGURE 2.158  (a) Shows two sine waves and the resulting sum—another sine wave of the same frequency, but shifted in 
phase and amplitude. This is the key feature that makes it easy to deal with sinusoidally driven linear circuits containing 
resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Note that if you were to try this with sine waves of different frequencies, as shown 
in (b), the resultant waveform isn’t sinusoidal. Superimposing nonsinusoidal waveforms of the same frequency, such as 
squarewaves, isn’t guaranteed to result in a similar waveform, as shown in (c).

Chapter 2: Theory    167
form (or shorthand form), you can easily multiply and divide terms (terms in the 
exponent will simply add or subtract).
It should be noted that, in reality, currents and voltages are always real; there is 
no such thing as an imaginary current or voltage. But then why are there imaginary 
parts? The answer is that when you start expressing currents and voltages with real 
and imaginary parts, you are simply introducing a mechanism for keeping track of 
the phase. (The complex part is like a hidden part within a machine; its function does 
not show up externally but does indeed affect the external output—the “real,” or 
important, part, as it were.) What this means is that the final answer (the result of the 
superimposing) always must be converted back into a real quantity. This means that 
after all the calculations are done, you must convert the complex result into either 
polar- trigonometric or polar- exponential (shorthand form) and remove the imagi-
nary part. For example, if you come across a resultant voltage expressed in the fol-
lowing complex form:
 
V(t) = 5 V + j 10 V
where the voltages are RMS, we get a meaningful real result by finding the mag-
nitude, which we can do simply by converting the complex expression into polar 
exponential or shorthand form:
 
e j

(10.0 V)

(63.4 )
+
°  = (11.2 V) e j(63.5°) = 11.2 V ∠ 63.5°
Whatever is going on, be it reactive or resistive effects, there is really 11.2 V RMS 
present. If the result is a final calculation, the phase often isn’t important for practical 
purposes, so it is often ignored.
You may be scratching your head now and saying, “How do I really do the super-
imposing and such? This all seems too abstract or wishy- washy. How do I actually 
account for the resistors, capacitors, and inductors in the grand scheme of things?” 
Perhaps the best way to avoid this wishy- washiness is to begin by taking a sinusoidal 
voltage and converting it into a complex number representation. After that, you can 
apply it individually across a resistor, a capacitor, and then an inductor to see what you 
get. Important new ideas and concrete analysis techniques will surface in the process.
2.27.2  Sinusoidal Voltage Source in Complex Notation
Let’s start by taking the following expression for a sinusoidal voltage:
 
V0 cos (ωt)    (ω = 2πf )
and converting it into a polar- trigonometric expression:
 
V0 cos (ωt) + jV0 sin (ωt)
What about the jV0 sin (ωt) term? It is imaginary and does not have any physi-
cal meaning, so it does not affect the real voltage expression (you need it, how-
ever, for the superimposing process). To help with the calculations that follow, the 

168    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
polar-trigonometric form is converted into the polar- exponential form using Euler’s 
relation e jθ = r cos (θ) + jr sin (θ):
 
V0ej(ωt) 
(2.67)
In polar- exponential shorthand form, this would be:
 
V0 ∠ (ωt) 
(2.68)
Graphically, you can represent this voltage as a vector rotating counterclockwise 
with angular frequency ω in the complex plane (recall that ω = dθ/dt, where ω = 2πf). 
The length of the vector represents the maximum value of V—namely, V0—while the 
projection of the vector onto the real axis represents the real part, or the instantaneous 
value of V, and the projection of the vector onto the imaginary axis represents the 
imaginary part of V.
Now that you have an expression for the voltage in complex form, you can place, 
say, a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor across the source and come up with a com-
plex expression for the current through each component. To find the current through 
a resistor in complex form, you simply plug V0e j(ωt) into V in I = V/R. To find the 
capacitor current, you plug V0e j(ωt) into I = C dV/dt. Finally, to find the inductor cur-
rent, you plug V0e j(ωt) into I = 1/L ∫Vdt. The results are shown in Fig. 2.160.
Comparing the phase difference between the current and voltage through and 
across each component, notice the following:
Resistor: The current and voltage are in phase, φ = 0°, as shown in the graph in Fig. 
2.160. This behavior can also be modeled within the complex plane, where the 
voltage and current vectors are at the same angle with respect to each other, both 
of which rotate around counterclockwise at an angular frequency ω = 2πf.
Capacitor: The current is out of phase with the applied voltage by +90°. In other words, 
the current leads the voltage by 90°. By convention, unless otherwise stated, the 
FIGURE 2.159  

Chapter 2: Theory    169
phase angle φ is referenced from the current vector to the voltage vector. If φ is 
positive, then current is leading (further counterclockwise in rotation); if φ is neg-
ative, current is lagging (further clockwise in rotation).
Inductor: The current is out of phase with the applied voltage by −90°. In other words, 
the current lags the voltage by 90°.
We call the complex plane model, showing the magnitude and phase of the volt-
ages and currents, a phasor diagram—where the term phasor implies phase compari-
son. Unlike a time- dependent mathematical function, a phasor provides only a snap-
shot of what’s going on. In other words, it only tells you the phase and amplitude at 
a particular moment in time.
Now comes the important trick to making ac analysis easy to deal with. If we take 
the voltage across each component and divide it by the current, we get the following 
(see Fig. 2.161):
FIGURE 2.160  

170    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
As you can see, the nasty V0e j(ωt) terms cancel, giving us resistance, capacitive reac-
tance, and inductive reactance in complex form. Notice that the resulting expressions 
are functions only of frequency, not of time. This is part of the trick to avoiding the 
nasty differential equations.
Now that we have a way of describing capacitive reactance and inductive reac-
tance in terms of complex numbers, we can make an important assumption. We can 
now treat capacitors and inductors like frequency- sensitive resistors within sinusoi-
dally driven circuits. These frequency- sensitive resistors take the place of normal 
resistors in dc circuit analysis. We must also replace dc sources with sinusoidal ones. 
If all voltages, currents, resistances, and reactances are expressed in complex form 
when we are analyzing a circuit, when we plug them into the old circuit theorems 
(Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s law, Thevinin’s theorem, etc.) we will come up with equa-
tions whose solutions are taken care of through the mathematical operations of the 
complex numbers themselves (the superposition theorem is built in).
For example, ac Ohm’s law looks like this:
 
V(ω) = I(ω) × Z(ω) 
(2.69)
What does the Z stand for? It’s referred to as complex impedance, which is a 
generic way of describing resistance to current flow, in complex form. The complex 
FIGURE 2.161  

Chapter 2: Theory    171
impedance may simply be resistive, it may be only capacitive, it may be inductive, 
or it could be a combination of resistive and reactive elements (e.g., an RLC circuit 
element). For example:

Any complex impedance Z: VZ = IZ × Z
Figure 2.162 shows what we just discussed, along with the phasor expression for 
a sinusoidal source, and a complex impedance Z composed of a resistor, a capacitor, 
and an inductor.
Continuing along the line of treating complex impedances as frequency- sensitive 
resistors, we can make use of the resistors in series equation, except now we take 
impedances in series:
 
Ztotal = Z1 + Z2 + Z3 + . . . + ZN 
(2.70) N in series
FIGURE 2.162

What a mathematical nightmare, you may say, after doing the last example. As 
you can see, the expressions can get ugly if we don’t start plugging values into the 
variables from the start. However, the act of finding a complex impedance and using 
it in ac analysis is vastly easier than using the characteristic equations of resistors, 
capacitors, and inductors; inserting them into Kirchhoff’s laws; and solving the dif-
ferential equations.
Example 3: The series RL circuit in Fig. 2.167 is driven by a 12- VAC (RMS), 60- Hz 
source. L = 265 mH, R = 50 Ω. Find IS, IR, IL, VR, and VL and the apparent power, real 
power, reactive power, and power factor.
FIGURE 2.166  

174    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
First, calculate the reactance of the inductor:
XL = jωL = j(2π × 60 Hz × 265 × 10−3 H) = j 100 Ω
Since the resistor and inductor are in series, 
the math is easy—simply add complex num-
bers in rectangular form:
Z = R + XL = 50 Ω + j100 Ω
In polar form, the result is:

Don’t let the imaginary part or phase angle 
fool you. The impedance is real; it provides 112 
ohms’ worth, though only a portion of this is 
real resistance—the rest is inductive reactance.

The −63.4° result means the current lags the 
applied voltage or total voltage across the net-
work by 63.4°. Since this is a series circuit I = 
IR = IL. The voltage across the resistance and 
inductor can be found using ac Ohm’s law or 
the ac voltage divider:
 VR = I × R = (0.107A ∠ −63.4°)(50 Ω ∠ 0°)
 
= 5.35 VAC ∠ −63.4°
 VL = I × XL = (0.107A ∠ −63.4°)(100 Ω ∠ 90°)
 
= 10.7 VAC ∠ 26.6°
Note that the preceding calculations were for 
only an instant in time t = 0, as is the case by 
stating the starting condition: VS = 12 VAC 
∠ 0°. But that’s all we need, since we know the 
phases and the voltages at those phases, which 
link amplitude. So to create an accurate picture 
of how the whole system behaves over time, 
we simply plug the more general ωt into the 
source voltage, and convert the RMS values 
into true values by multiplying by 1.414. We 
FIGURE 2.167  
 VS(t) = 17.0 V sin (ωt)
 VR(t) = 7.6 V sin (ωt − 63.4°)
 VL(t) = 15.1 V sin (ωt + 26.6°)
 IS(t) = 0.151 A sin (ωt − 63.4°)
 * Peak voltages and currents used in these functions are the 
RMS equivalents multiplied by 1.414.

Chapter 2: Theory    175
get VS = 17.0 V ∠ ωt, which isn’t a snapshot but a continuous mathematic description 
for all times. To make a graph, we must convert into trigonometric form, ignoring the 
imaginary part in the process: VS = 17.0 V cos (ωt). Since we are only concerned with 
phase, we can express VS in terms of a sine function, VS = 17.0 V sin (ωt) and refer-
ence all other voltage and current waveforms from it by adding their phase terms and 
including their peak values, as shown in the following equations.
The apparent power due to the total impedance:
 
VA = IRMSVRMS = (0.107A)(12 VAC) = 1.284 VA
Only resistance consumes power, however:
 
PR = IRMS
2R = (0.107A)2 (50 Ω) = 0.572 W
The reactive power due to the inductor is:
 
VAR = IRMS

2.27.3  Odd Phenomena in Reactive Circuits
In reactive circuits, circulation of energy accounts for seemingly odd phenomena. In 
our example in Fig. 2.167, it appears that Kirchhoff’s law  doesn’t add up, since the 
arithmetical sum of the resistor and inductor voltages is:
 
5.35 VAC + 10.70 VAC = 16.05 VAC
This is greater than the 12- VAC source voltage. The problem here is that we haven’t 
taken into account the phase.
FIGURE 2.168  

176    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Their actual result, when phase is taken into account, is:
 
Vtotal = VR + VL = 5.35 VAC ∠ −63.4° + 10.70 VAC ∠ 26.6°
 
= 2.4 VAC − j4.8 VAC + 9.6 VAC + j4.8 VAC = 12 VAC
Figure 2.168 graphically illustrates this point.
Note that the use of “VAC” to represent the fact that the voltages are expressed in 
RMS values is not always followed. Some people like to simply write “V” and assume 
that all voltages are sinusoidal and thus given in RMS form. The actual peak voltages 
are related to the RMS voltage value by VP = 1.414 × VRMS.
In other cases, such as a series circuit with capacitance and inductance, the volt-
ages across the components may exceed the supply voltage. This condition can exist 
because, while energy is being stored by the inductor, the capacitor is returning 
energy to the circuit from its previously charged state, and vice versa. In a parallel 
circuit with inductive and capacitive branches, the currents circulating through the 
components may exceed the current drawn from the source. Again, the phenomenon 
occurs because the inductor’s collapsing field supplies current to the capacitor and 
the discharging capacitor provides current to the inductor. We will take a look at these 
cases in a moment.
2.28  Power in AC Circuits (Apparent Power, Real Power, Reactive Power)
In a complex circuit containing resistors, inductors, and capacitors, how do you deter-
mine what kind of power is being used? The best place to start is with the generalized 
power law P = IRMSVRMS. However, for now, let’s replace P with VA, and call VA the 
apparent power:
 
VA = IRMSVRMS 
(2.74) Apparent power
In light of our RL series circuit in Fig. 2.167, we find the apparent power to be:
 
VA = IRMSVRMS = (0.107A)(12 V) = 1.284 VA
The apparent power VA is no different from the power we calculate using the gen-
eralized ac power expression. The reason for using VA instead of P is simply a con-
vention used to help distinguish the fact that the calculated power isn’t purely real 
and is not expressed in watts, as real power is. Instead, apparent power is expressed 
in volt- amperes, or VA, which happens to be the same letters used for the variable 
for apparent power. (This is analogous to the variable for voltage being similar to the 
unit volt, though the variable is distinguished from the unit by being italicized.) In 
essence, the apparent power takes into account both resistive power losses as well as 
reactive power. The reactive power, however, isn’t associated with power loss, but is 
instead associated with energy storage in the form of magnetic fields within induc-
tors and electric fields within capacitors. This energy is later returned to the circuit as 
the magnetic field in an inductor collapses, or the electric field vanishes as a capacitor 
discharges later in the ac cycle. Only if a circuit is purely resistive can we say that the 
apparent power is in watts.

Chapter 2: Theory    177
So how do we distinguish what portions of the apparent power are real power 
and reactive power? Real power is associated with power loss due to heating through 
an ohmic material, so we can define real power using ac Ohm’s law within the general-
ized power expression:
 
PR = IRMS
2R 
(2.75) Real power
In our series RL circuit in Fig. 2.167, we find the real power to be:
 
PR = IRMS
2R = (0.107 A)2 (50 Ω) = 0.572 W
Notice that real power is always measured in watts.
Now, to determine the reactive power due to capacitance and inductance within 
a circuit, we create the notion of reactive power. The reactive power is given in volt- 
ampere reactive, or VAR. We can define the reactive power by using the Ohm’s power 
law, replacing resistance (or impedance) with a generic reactance X:
 
VAR = IRMS
2X 
(2.76) Reactive power
At no time should watts be associated with reactive power. In fact, reactive power is 
called wattless power, and therefore is given in volt- amperes, or VA.
Considering the RL series circuit in Fig. 2.167, the reactive power is:
 
VAR = IRMS
2XL = (0.107 A)2 (100 Ω) = 1.145 VA
You may be saying, great, we can now add up the real power and reactive 
power, and this will give us the apparent power. Let’s try it out for our RL circuit in 
Fig. 2.167:
 
0.572 + 1.145 = 1.717
But wait, the calculated apparent power was 1.284 VA, not 1.717 VA. What’s wrong? 
The problem is that a simple arithmetic operation on variables that are reactive can’t 
be done without considering phase (as we saw with adding voltages). Considering 
phase for our RL series circuit:
 
VAR = I 2
RMSXL = (0.107 A ∠ −63.4°)2 (100 Ω ∠ 90°) = 1.145 VA ∠ −36.8°
 
VAR = 0.917 VA − j0.686 VA
 
PR = I 2
RMS R = (0.107 A ∠ −63.4°)2 (50 Ω ∠ 0°) = 0.573 ∠ −126.8°
 
PR = −0.343 W − j0.459 W
Adding the reactive and real power together now gives us the correct apparent 
power:
 
VA = VAR + PR = 0.574 VA − j1.145 VA = 1.281 VA ∠ −63.4°

178    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To avoid doing such calculations, we note the following relationship:
Here, we don’t have to worry about phase angles—the Pythagorean theorem used 
in the complex plane, as shown in Fig. 2.169, takes care of that. Using the RL series 
example again and inserting our values into Eq. 2.77, we get an accurate expression 
relating real, apparent and reactive powers:
 
1.284

2.28.1  Power Factor
Another way to represent the amount of apparent power to reactive power within a 
circuit is to use what’s called the power factor. The power factor of a circuit is the ratio 
of consumed power to apparent power:
 
PF
P
P
P
VA

(2.78)
In the example in Fig. 2.167:
 
PF
0.572 W
1.284 VA
0.45
=
=
Power factor is frequently expressed as a percentage, in this case 45 percent.
An equivalent definition of power factor is:
 
PF = cos φ 
(2.79)
where φ is the phase angle (between voltage and current). In the example in Fig. 2.167, 
the phase angle is −63.4°, so:
 
PF = cos (−63.4°) = 0.45
as the earlier calculation confirms.
The power factor of a purely resistive circuit is 100 percent, or 1, while the power 
factor of a purely reactive circuit is 0.
Since the power factor is always rendered as a positive number, the value must 
be followed by the words “leading” or “lagging” to identify the phase of the voltage 
with respect to the current. Specifying the numerical power factor is not always suf-
ficient. For example, many dc- to- ac power inverters can safely operate loads having 
large net reactance of one sign but only a small reactance of the opposite sign.

Chapter 2: Theory    179
The final calculation of the power factor in the example in Fig. 2.167 yields the value 
of 0.45 lagging.
In ac equipment, the ac components must handle reactive power as well as real 
power. For example, a transformer connected to a purely reactive load must still be 
capable of supplying the voltage and be able to handle the current required by the 
reactive load. The current in the transformer windings will heat the windings as a 
result of I 2R losses in the winding resistances.
As a final note, there is another term to describe the percentage of power used in 
reactance, which is called the reactive factor. The reactive factor is defined by:

power, real power, reactive power, and power factor.

Since the inductor and capacitor are in series,

bers in rectangular form:
Z = XL + XC = j80 Ω + (−j20 Ω) = j60 Ω
In polar form, this is 60 Ω ∠ 90°. The fact that 
the phase is 90°, or the result is positive imag-
inary, means the impedance is net inductive. 
Don’t let the imaginary part fool you—the 
impedance is actually felt—it provides 60 Ω 
of impedance, even though it’s not resistive.

sion easy. The −90° result means the source current 
(total current) lags the source voltage by 90°. Since this 
is a series circuit: IS = IL = IC.
The voltage across the inductor and capacitor 
can be found using ac Ohm’s law (or the ac voltage 
divider):
       VL = IS × XL = (0.167 A ∠ −90°)(80 Ω ∠ 90°)
            = 13.36 VAC ∠ 0°
 
VC = IS × XC = (0.167 A ∠ −90°)(20 Ω ∠ −90°) 
            = 3.34 VAC ∠ −180°
Notice that the voltage across the inductor is greater 
than the supply voltage; the capacitor supplies current 
to the inductor as it discharges.
To convert these snapshots into a continuous set of functions, we convert all RMS 
values to true value (× 1.414), add the ωt term to the phase angles, and convert to 
trigonometric form, then delete the imaginary part. Our results would all be in terms 
of cosines, but to make things pretty, we select sines. Doing this  doesn’t make any 
practical difference. See graphs and equations to left.
The apparent power due to the total impedance is:
 
VA = IRMSVRMS = (0.167 A)(10 VAC) = 1.67 VA
The real (true) power consumed by the circuit is:
 
PR = IRMS
2R = (0.167 A)2(0 Ω) = 0 W
Only reactive power exists, and for the inductor and capacitor:
 
VARL = IRMS
2XL = (0.167 A)2(80 Ω) = 2.23 VA
 
VARC = IRMS
2XC = (0.167 A)2(20 Ω) = 0.56 VA

Hz source. L = 2.2 mH, C = 5.5 µF. Find IS, IL, IC, VL, and VC and the apparent power, 
real power, reactive power, and power factor.

In polar form, the result is 13.33 Ω

negative imaginary, means the impedance is 
net capacitive. Don’t let the imaginary part 
fool you—the impedance is actually felt—it 
provides 13.3 Ω of impedance, even though 
it’s not resistive.

To convert these snapshots into a continuous set of functions, we convert all RMS 
values to true value (× 1.414), add the ωt term to the phase angles, and convert to

The apparent power is:

Only reactive power exists, and for the inductor and capacitor:

Hz source. L = 25 mH, C = 1 µF, and R = 1.0 Ω. Find the total impedance Z, VL, VC, VR, 
and IS, and the apparent power, real power, reactive power, and power factor.
First let’s find the reactances of the 
inductor and capacitor:

and R in series:
Z = R + XL + XC = 1 Ω + j157.1 Ω − j159.2 Ω
   = 1 Ω − j(2.1 Ω)
In polar form, the result is 2.33 Ω ∠ −64.5°. 
The fact that the phase is −64.5°, or the 
imaginary part is negative, means the 
FIGURE 2.172

impedance is net capacitive. Don’t let the 
imaginary part fool you—the impedance is 
actually felt—it provides 2.33 Ω of imped-
ance, even though it’s not entirely resistive.
The total current can now be found using

Note that we used 2.33 Ω ∠ −64.5° (polar

result means the total current leads the 
source voltage by 64.5°. Since this is a series 
circuit: IS = IL = IC = IR.
The voltage across each component can 
be found using ac Ohm’s law:
 VL = ISXL = (0.429 A ∠ 64.5°)(157.1 Ω ∠ 90°)
 
= 67.40 VAC ∠ 154.5°
 VC = ISXC 
 
= (0.429 A ∠ 64.5°)(159.2 Ω ∠ −90°)

 VR = ISR = (0.429 A ∠ 64.5°)(1 Ω ∠ 0°)
 
= 0.429 VAC ∠ 64.5°
Notice that the voltage across the inductor and capacitor are huge at this particular 
phase when compared to the supply voltage; the capacitor supplies current to the 
inductor as it discharges, while the inductor supplies current to the capacitor as its 
magnetic field collapses. To convert these snapshots into a continuous set of func-
tions, we convert all RMS values to true value (× 1.414), add the ωt term to the phase 
angles, and convert to trigonometric form, then delete the imaginary part. Our results 
would all be in terms of cosines, but to make things pretty, we select sines. Doing this 
 doesn’t make any practical difference. See graphs and equations in Fig. 2.172.
The apparent power is:
 
VA = IRMSVRMS = (0.429 A)(1.00 VAC) = 0.429 VA
The real (true) power, or power dissipated by resistor is:

It should have become apparent from the last example that the VARs for the induc-
tor and the capacitor became surprisingly large. When dealing with real- life compo-
nents, the VAR values become important. Even though volt- amps do not contribute 
to the overall true power loss, this does not mean that the volt- amps aren’t felt by the 
reactive components. Components like inductors and transformers (ideally reactive 
components) are usually given a volt- amp rating that provides the safety limit to 
prevent overheating the component. Again, it is the internal resistances within the 
inductor or transformer that must be considered.
Example 7: The LCR parallel circuit in Fig. 2.173 is driven by a 12.0- VAC (RMS), 600- 
Hz source. L = 1.061 mH, C = 66.3 µF, and R = 10 Ω. Find Ztot, VL, VC, VR, and IS, and 
the apparent power, real power, reactive power, and power factor. First let’s find the 
reactances of the inductor and capacitor:

The fact that there is no reactive part to the

let’s finish solving.

A power factor of 1 indicates the circuit is purely resistive. How can this be? In this 
case we have a special condition where a circulating current is “trapped” within the 
LC section. This only occurs at a special frequency called the resonant frequency. 
We’ll cover resonant circuits in a moment.

2.29  Thevenin’s Theorem in AC Form
Thevenin’s theorem, like the other dc theorems, can be modified so that it can be 
used in ac linear circuits analysis. The revised ac form of Thevenin’s theorem reads: 
Any complex network of resistors, capacitors, and inductors can be represented by 
a single sinusoidal power source connected to a single equivalent impedance. For 
example, if you want to find the voltage across two points in a complex, linear, sinu-
soidal circuit or find the current and voltage through and across a particular element 
within, you remove the element, find the Thevenin voltage VTHEV(t), replace the sinu-
soidal sources with a short, find the Thevenin impedance ZTHEV(t), and then make 
the Thevenin equivalent circuit. Figure 2.174 shows the Thevenin equivalent circuit 
for a complex circuit containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The following 
example will provide any missing details.
Example: Suppose that you are interested in finding the current through the resistor 
in the circuit in Fig. 2.175.
Answer: First, you remove the resistor in order 
to free up two terminals to make a black box. 
Next, you calculate the open circuit, or Thevenin 
voltage VTHEV, by using the ac voltage divider 
equation. First, however, let’s determine the 
reactances of the capacitor and inductor:

2.30  Resonant Circuits
When an LC circuit is driven by a sinusoidal voltage source at a special frequency 
called the resonant frequency, an interesting phenomenon occurs. For example, if 
you drive a series LC circuit (shown in Fig. 2.176) at its resonant angular frequency 
ω0 = 
LC
1/
, or equivalently its resonant frequency f0 = 1/(2
LC
π
), the effective imped-
ance across the LC network goes to zero. In effect, the LC network acts like a short. 
This means that the sourced current flow will be at a maximum. Ideally, it will go to 
infinity, but in reality it is limited by internal resistances of all the components in the 
circuit. To get an idea of how the series LC resonant circuit works, let’s take a look 
at the following example.
Example: To get an idea of how the LC series 
circuit works, we find the equivalent imped-
ance of the circuit—taking L and C in series. 
Unlike the previous examples, the frequency 
is unknown, so it must be left as a variable:

the impedance goes to zero while the current goes to infinity. In other words, if you plug 
the resonant frequency into the impedance and current equations, the result gives you 
zero and infinity, respectively. In reality, internal resistance prevents infinite current.
Inductive and capacitive reactances at resonance are equal but opposite in phase, 
as depicted by the equations with Fig. 2.176.
Intuitively, you can imagine that the voltage across the capacitor and the voltage 
across the inductor are exactly equal but opposite in phase at resonance, within the 
LC series circuit. This means the effective voltage drop across the series pair is zero; 
therefore, the impedance across the pair must also be zero.

resonant frequency expression for the series LC circuit; however, the circuit behavior 
is exactly opposite. Instead of the impedance going to zero and the current going to 
infinity at resonance, the impedance goes to infinity while the current goes to zero. In 
essence, the parallel LC network acts like an open circuit. Of course, in reality, there 
is always some internal resistance and parasitic capacitance and inductance within 
the circuit that prevent this from occurring. To get an idea of how the parallel LC 
resonant circuit works, let’s take a look at the following example.
Example: For an LC parallel- resonant circuit, we 
take the inductor and capacitor in parallel (apply-

the impedance goes to infinity while the cur-
rent goes to zero. In other words, if you plug 
the resonant frequency into the im pedance 
and current equations, you get infinity and 
zero, respectively. In reality, internal resis-
tances and parasitic inductances and capaci-
tors within the circuit prevent infinite cur-
rent. Notice that as the frequency approaches 
zero, the current in creases toward infinity, 
since the inductor acts like a short at dc. On the other hand, if the frequency increases 
toward infinity, the capacitor acts like a short, and the current goes toward infinity.
Intuitively, we can imagine that at resonance, the impedance and voltage across 
L are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase (direction) with respect to C. From 
this you can infer that an equal but opposite current will flow through L and C. In 
other words, at one moment a current is flowing upward through L and downward 
through C. The current through L runs into the top of C, while the current from C 
runs into the bottom of the inductor. At another moment the directions of the currents 
reverse (energy is “bounced” back in the other direction; L and C act as an oscillator 
pair that passes the same amount of energy back and forth, and the amount of energy

is determined by the sizes of L and C). This internal current flow around the LC loop 
is referred to as a circulating current. Now, as this is going on, no more current will 
be supplied through the network by the source. Why? The power source  doesn’t 
“feel” a potential difference across it. Another way to put this would be to say that if 
an external current were to be supplied through the LC network, it would mean that 
one of the elements (L or C) would have to be passing more current than the other. 
However, at resonance, this does not happen because the L and C currents are equal 
and pointing in the opposite direction.

For most electronics work, these previous formulas will permit calculation of fre-
quency and component values well within the limits of component tolerances. 
Resonant circuits have other properties of importance in addition to the resonant 
frequency, however. These include impedance, voltage drop across components in 
series- resonant circuits, circulating currents in parallel- resonant circuits, and band-
width. These properties determine such factors as the selectivity of a tuned circuit 
and the component ratings for circuits handling considerable power. Although the 
basic determination of the tuned- circuit resonant frequency ignored any resistance in 
the circuit, that will play a vital role in the circuit’s other characteristics.
2.30.1  Resonance in RLC Circuits
The previous LC series-  and parallel- resonant circuits are ideal in nature. In reality, 
there is internal resistance or impedance within the components that leads to a 
deviation from the true resonant effects we observed. In most real LC resonant 
circuits, the most notable resistance is associated with losses in the inductor at high 
frequencies (HF range); resistive losses in a capacitor are low enough at those fre-
quencies to be ignored. The following example shows how a series RLC circuit 
works.

the total current  doesn’t go to infinity; instead 
it goes to 2 A, which is just VS/R = 10 VAC/ 
5 Ω = 2 A. The resistance thus prevents a zero 
impedance condition that would otherwise be 
present when the inductor and capacitor reac-
tances cancel at resonance.

As pointed out in Fig. 2.178, at resonance, the reactance of the capacitor cancels 
the reactance of the inductor, and thus the impedance is determined solely by the 
resistance. We can therefore deduce that at resonance the current and voltage must 
be in phase—recall that in a sinusoidal circuit with a single resistor, the current and 
voltage are in phase. However, as we move away from the resonant frequency (keep-
ing component values the same), the impedance goes up due to increases in reactance 
of the capacitor or the inductor. As you go lower in frequency from resonance, the

capacitor’s reactance becomes dominant—capacitors increasingly resist current as 
the frequency decreases. As you go higher in frequency from resonance, the induc-
tor’s reactance becomes dominant—inductors increasingly resist current as the fre-
quency increases. Far from resonance in either direction, you can see that resistance 
has an insignificant effect on current amplitude.
Now if you take a look at the graph in Fig. 2.178, notice how the current curve 
looks like a pointy hilltop. In electronics, describing the pointiness of the current 
curve is an important characteristic of concern. When the reactance of the induc-
tor or capacitor is of the same order of magnitude as the resistance, the current 
decreases rather slowly as you move away from the resonant frequency in either 
direction. Such a curve, or “hilltop,” is said to be broad. Conversely, when the  
reactance of the inductor or capacitor is considerably larger than the resistance,  
the current decreases rapidly as you move away from the resonant frequency in 
either direction. Such a curve, or “hilltop,” is said to be sharp. A sharp resonant  
circuit will respond a great deal more readily to the resonant frequency than to  
frequencies quite close to resonance. A broad resonant circuit will respond 
al most equally well to a group or band of frequencies centered about the resonant 
 frequency.
As it turns out, both sharp and narrow circuits are useful. A sharp circuit gives 
good selectivity. This means that it has the ability to respond strongly (in terms of cur-
rent amplitude) at one desired frequency and is able to discriminate against others. 
A broad circuit, on the other hand, is used in situations where a similar response 
over a band of frequencies is desired, as opposed to a strong response at a single 
frequency.
Next, we’ll take a look at quality factor and bandwidth—two quantities that pro-
vide a measure of the sharpness of our RLC resonant circuit.
2.30.2  Q (Quality Factor) and Bandwidth
As mentioned earlier, the ratio of reactance or stored energy to resistance or con-
sumed energy is by definition the quality factor Q. (Q is also referred to as the 
figure of merit, or multiplying factor.) As it turns out, within a series RLC circuit 
(where R is internal resistance of the components), the internal resistive losses 
within the inductor dominate energy consumption at high frequencies. This means 
the inductor Q largely determines the resonant circuit Q. Since the value of Q is 
independent of any external load to which the circuit might transfer power, we 
modify the resonant circuit Q, by calling it the unloaded Q or QU of the circuit. See 
Fig. 2.179.
In the example RLC series- resonant circuit from Fig. 2.178, we can determine 
the unloaded Q of the circuit by dividing the reactance of either the inductor or the 
capacitor (they have the same relative impedance at resonance) by the resistance:

194    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
As you can see, if we increase the resistance, the unloaded Q decreases, giving rise to 
broad current response curves about resonance, as shown in the graph in Fig. 2.179. 
With resistances of 10, 20, and 50 Ω, the unloaded Q decreases to 4, 2, and 0.8, respec-
tively. Conversely, if the resistance is made smaller, the unloaded Q increases, giving 
rise to a sharp current response curve about resonance. For example, when the resis-
tance is lowered to 2 Ω, the unloaded Q becomes 20.
2.30.3  Bandwidth
An alternative way of expressing the sharpness of a series- resonant circuit is using 
what is called bandwidth. Basically, what we do is take the quality factor graph in 
Fig. 2.179 and convert it to the bandwidth graph in Fig. 2.179. This involves changing 
the current axis to a relative current axis and moving the family of curves for varying 
Q values up so that all have the same peak current. By assuming that the peak current 
of each curve is the same, the rate of change of current for various values of Q and 
the associated ratios of reactance to resistance are more easily compared. From the 
curves, you can see that lower Q circuits pass frequencies over a greater bandwidth 
of frequencies than circuits with a higher Q. For the purpose of comparing tuned cir-
cuits, bandwidth is often defined as the frequency spread between the two frequen-
cies at which the current amplitude decreases to 0.707 or 1/ 2 times the maximum 
value. Since the power consumed by the resistance R is proportional to the square 
of the current, the power at these points is half the maximum power at resonance, 
assuming that R is constant for the calculations. The half- power, or −3- dB, points are 
marked on the drawing.
For Q values of 10 or greater, the curves shown in Fig. 2.179 are approximately 
symmetrical. On this assumption, bandwidth (BW) can be easily calculated:
 
BW

QU
=
 
(2.81)
where BW and f are in units of hertz.

As we discovered earlier, these voltages may become many times larger than the 
source voltage, due to the magnetic and electric stored energy returned by the induc-
tor and capacitor. This is especially true for circuits with high Q values. For example, 
at resonance, the RLC circuit of Fig. 2.178 has the following voltage drops across the 
capacitor and inductor:
 
VC = XCI = 40 Ω ∠ −90° × 2 A ∠ 0° = 80 VAC ∠ −90°
 
VL = XLI = 40 Ω ∠ +90° × 2 A ∠ 0° = 80 VAC ∠ +90°
The actual amplitude of the voltage when we convert from the RMS values is a 
factor of 1.414 higher, or 113 V. High- Q circuits such as those found in antenna cou-
plers, which handle significant power, may experience arcing from high reactive 
voltages, even though the source voltage to the circuit is well within component 
ratings. When Qs of greater than 10 are considered, the following equation gives a 
good approximation of the reactive voltage within a series- resonant RLC circuit at 
resonance:
 
VX = QUVS 
(2.82)
2.30.5  Capacitor Losses
Note that although capacitor energy losses tend to be insignificant compared to 
inductor losses up to about 30 MHz within a series- resonant circuit, these losses may 
affect circuit Q in the VHF range (30 to 300 MHz). Leakage resistance, principally 
in the solid dielectric between the capacitor plates, is not exactly like the internal 
wire resistive losses in an inductor coil. Instead of forming a series resistance, resis-
tance associated with capacitor leakage usually forms a parallel resistance with the 
capacitive reactance. If the leakage resistance of a capacitor is significant enough to 
affect the Q of a series- resonant circuit, the parallel resistance must be converted to an

where RP is the leakage resistance and XC is the capacitive reactance. This value is 
then added to the inductor’s internal resistance and the sum represents the R in an 
RLC resonant circuit.

When calculating the impedance, current, and bandwidth of a series- resonant circuit, 
the series leakage resistance is added to the inductor’s coil resistance. Since an induc-
tor’s resistance tends to increase with frequency due to what’s called the skin effect 
(electrons forced to the surface of a wire), the combined losses in the capacitor and 
the inductor can seriously reduce circuit Q.

2.30.6  Parallel- Resonant Circuits
Although series- resonant circuits are common, the vast majority of resonant circuits 
are parallel- resonant circuits. Figure 2.180 shows a typical parallel- resonant circuit. 
As with series- resonant circuits, the inductor internal coil resistance is the main 
source of resistive losses, and therefore we put the series resistor in the same leg as 
the inductor. Unlike the series- resonant circuit whose impedance goes toward a mini-
mum at resonance, the parallel- resonant circuit’s impedance goes to a maximum. 
For this reason, RLC parallel- resonant circuits are often called antiresonant circuits or 
rejector circuits. (RLC series- resonant circuits go by the name acceptor). The following 
example will paint a picture of parallel resonance behavior.

Chapter 2: Theory    197
Example: The impedance of the RLC parallel circuit 
is found by combining the inductor and resistor in 
series, and then placing it in parallel with the capaci-
tor (using the impedances in parallel formula):

Plugging these equations into a graphing program, 
you get the curves shown in Fig. 2.180. Note that at a 
particular frequency, the impedance goes to a maxi-
mum, while the total current goes to a minimum. 
This, however, is not at the point where XL = XC—
the point referred to as the resonant frequency in the 
case of a simple LC parallel circuit or a series RLC 
circuit. As it turns out, the resonant frequency of a 
parallel RLC circuit is a bit more complex and can be 
expressed three possible ways. However, for now, we 
make an approximation that is expressed as before:

The lower graph in Fig. 2.180 shows the quality factor and how it is influenced by the 
size of the parallel resistance in the inductor leg.
FIGURE 2.180  

198    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Unlike the ideal LC parallel resonant circuit we saw in Fig. 2.177, the addition of 
R changes the conditions of resonance. For example, when the inductive and capaci-
tive reactances are the same, the impedances of the inductive and capacitive legs do 
not cancel—the resistance in the inductive leg screws things up. When XL = XC, the 
impedance of the inductive leg is greater than XC and will not be 180° out of phase 
with XC. The resultant current is not at a true minimum value and is not in phase with 
the voltage. See line (A) in Fig. 2.181.
Now we can alter the value of the inductor a bit (holding Q constant) and get a new 
frequency where the current reaches a true minimum—something we can accomplish 
with the help of a current meter. We associate the dip in current at this new frequency 
with what is termed the standard definition of RLC parallel resonance. The point 
where minimum current (or maximum impedance) is reached is called the antireso-
nant point and is not to be confused with the condition where XL = XC. Altering the 
inductance to achieve minimum current comes at a price; the current becomes some-
what out of phase with the voltage—see line (B) in Fig. 2.181.
It’s possible to alter the circuit design of our RLC parallel- resonant circuit to draw 
some of the resonant points shown in Fig. 2.181 together—for example, compensat-
ing for the resistance of the inductor by altering the capacitance (retuning the capaci-
tor). The difference among the resonant points tends to get smaller and converge to 
within a percent of the frequency when the circuit Q rises above 10, in which case 
they can be ignored for practical calculations. Tuning for minimum current will not 
introduce a sufficiently large phase angle between voltage and current to create cir-
cuit difficulties.
As long as we assume Qs higher than 10, we can use a single set of formulas to 
predict circuit performance. As it turns out, what we end up doing is removing the 
series inductor resistance in the leg with the inductor and substituting a parallel- 
equivalent resistor of the actual inductor loss series resistor, as shown in Fig. 2.182.
FIGURE 2.181  

Chapter 2: Theory    199
This parallel- equivalent resistance is often called the dynamic resistance of the 
 parallel- resonant circuit. This resistance is the inverse of the series resistance; as the series 
resistance value decreases, the parallel- equivalent resistance increases. Alternatively, 
this means that the parallel- equivalent resistance will increase with circuit Q. We use 
the following formula to calculate the approximate parallel- equivalent resistance:

Multiplying QU by the reactance also provides the approximate parallel- equivalent

At resonance, assuming our parallel equivalent representation, XL = XC, and RP 
now defines the impedance of the parallel- resonant circuit. The reactances just equal 
each other, leaving the voltage and current in phase with each other. In other words, 
at resonance, the circuit demonstrates only parallel resistance. Therefore, Eq. 2.84 can

In the preceding example, the circuit impedance at resonance is 9510 Ω.
At frequencies below resonance, the reactance of the inductor is smaller than the 
reactance of the capacitor, and therefore the current through the inductor will be larger

than that through the capacitor. This means that there is only partial cancellation of 
the two reactive currents, and therefore the line current is larger than the current with 
resistance alone. Above resonance, things are reversed; more current flows through 
the capacitor than through the inductor, and again the line current increases above a 
value larger than the current with resistance alone. At resonance, the current is deter-
mined entirely by RP; it will be small if RP is large and large if RP is small.
Since the current rises off resonance, the parallel- resonant- circuit impedance must 
fall. It also becomes complex, resulting in an increasing phase difference between 
the voltage and the current. The rate at which the impedance falls is a function of 
QU. Figure 2.180 presents a family of curves showing the impedance drop from reso-
nance for circuit Qs ranging from 10 to 100. The curve family for parallel- circuit 
impedance is essentially the same as the curve family for series- circuit current. As 
with series- tuned circuits, the higher the Q of a parallel- tuned circuit, the sharper 
the response peak. Likewise, the lower the Q, the wider the band of frequencies to 
which the circuit responds. Using the half- power (−3- dB) points as a comparative 
measure of circuit performance, we can apply the same equations for bandwidth for 
a series- resonant circuit to a parallel- resonant circuit, BW = f/QU. Table 2.11 summa-
rizes performance of parallel- resonant circuits at high and low Qs, above and below 
resonance.

Note on Circulating Current
When we covered the ideal LC parallel- resonant circuit, we saw that quite a large 
circulating current could exist between the capacitor and the inductor at resonance, 
with no line current being drawn from the source. If we consider the more realis-
tic RLC parallel- resonant circuit, we also notice a circulating current at resonance 
(which, too, can be quite large compared to the source voltage), but now there exists 
a small line current sourced by the load. This current is attributed to the fact that even 
though the impedance of the resonant network is high, it isn’t infinite because there 
are resistive losses as the current circulates through the inductor and capacitor—most 
of which are attributed to the inductor’s internal resistance.
Taking our example from Fig. 2.183 and using the parallel- equivalent circuit, as 
shown to the right in Fig. 2.183, we associate the total line current as flowing through 
the parallel inductor resistance RP. Since the inductor, capacitor, and parallel resistor 
are all in parallel according to the parallel- equivalent circuit, we can determine the 
circulating current present between the inductor and capacitor, as well as the total 
line current now attributed to the parallel resistance:

The circuiting current is simply ICIR = IC = IL when the circuit is at the resonant fre-
quency. For parallel- resonant circuits with an unloaded Q of 10 or greater, the circu-
lating current is approximately equal to:
 
ICIR = QU × ITOT 
(2.86)
Using our example, if we measure the total line current to be 1 mA, and taking the 
Q of the circuit to be 30, the approximated circulating current is (30)(1 mA) = 30 mA.
FIGURE 2.183  

202    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Example: A parallel- resonant circuit permits an ac line current of 50 mA and has a Q 
of 100. What is the circulating current through the elements?
 
IC = QU × IT = 100 × 0.05 A = 5 A
Circulating current in high- Q parallel- tuned circuits can reach a level that causes 
component heating and power loss. Therefore, components should be rated for the 
anticipated circulating current, and not just for the line currents.
It is possible to use either series-  or parallel- resonant circuits to do the same work 
in many circuits, thus providing flexibility. Figure 2.184 illustrates this by show-
ing both a series- resonant circuit in the signal path and a parallel- resonant circuit 
shunted from the signal path to ground. Assuming both circuits are resonant at the 
same frequency f and have the same Q: the series- tuned circuit has its lowest imped-
ance at the resonant frequency, permitting the maximum possible current to flow 
along the signal path; at all other frequencies, the impedance increases causing a 
decrease in current. The circuit passes the desired signal and tends to impede signals 
at undesired frequencies. The parallel circuit, on the other hand, provides the high-
est impedance at resonance, making the signal path lowest in impedance for the 
signal; at all frequencies off resonance, the parallel circuit presents a lower imped-
ance, providing signals a route to ground away from the signal path. In theory, the 
effects displayed for both circuits are the same. However, in actual circuit design, 
there are many other things to consider, which ultimately determine which circuit is 
best for a particular application. We will discuss such circuits later, when we cover 
filter  circuits.
2.30.7  The Q of Loaded Circuits
In many resonant circuit applications, the only practical power lost is dissipated in 
the resonant circuit internal resistance. At frequencies below around 30 MHz, most of 
the internal resistance is within the inductor coil itself. Increasing the number of turns 
in an inductor coil increases the reactance at a rate that is faster than the accompany-
ing internal resistance of the coil. Inductors used in circuits where high Q is necessary 
have large inductances.
When a resonant circuit is used to deliver energy to a load, the energy consumed 
within the resonant circuit is usually insignificant compared to that consumed by the 
load. For example, in Fig. 2.185, a parallel load resistor RLOAD is attached to a resonant 
circuit, from which it receives power.
FIGURE 2.184  

Chapter 2: Theory    203
If the power dissipated by the load is at least 10 times as great as the power lost 
in the inductor and capacitor, the parallel impedance of the resonant circuit itself will 
be so high compared with the resistance of the load that for all practical purposes the 
impedance of the combined circuit is equal to the load impedance. In these circum-
stances, the load resistance replaces the circuit impedance in calculating Q. The Q of 
a parallel- resonant circuit loaded by a resistance is:
 
LOAD
LOAD
Q
R
X
=
 
(2.87)
where QLOAD is the circuit- loaded Q, RLOAD is the parallel load resistance in ohms, and 
X is the reactance in ohms of either the inductor or the capacitor.
Example 1: A resistive load of 4000 Ω is connected across the resonant circuit shown 
in Fig. 2.185, where the inductive and capacitive reactances at resonance are 316 Ω. 
What is the loaded Q for this circuit?
Answer:
 
4000

Ω=
The loaded Q of a circuit increases when the reactances are decreased. When a circuit 
is loaded with a low resistance (a few kiloohms) it must have low- reactance elements 
(large capacitance and small inductance) to have reasonably high Q.
Sometimes parallel load resistors are added to parallel- resonant circuits to lower 
the Q and increase the circuit bandwidth, as the following example illustrates.
Example 2: A parallel- resonant circuit needs to be designed with a bandwidth of 
400.0 kHz at 14.0 MHz. The current circuit has a QU of 70.0 and its components have 
reactances of 350 Ω each. What is the parallel load resistor that will increase the band-
width to the specified value?
Answer: First, we determine the bandwidth of the existing circuit:
 
BW

70.0
0.200 MHz

=
FIGURE 2.185  

204    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Since the desired Q is half the original value, halving the resonant impedance or 
 parallel- resistance value of the circuit will do the trick. The present impedance of the 
circuit is:
 
Z = QUXL = 70 × 350 Ω = 24,500 Ω
The desired impedance is:
 
Z = QUXL = 35.0 × 350 Ω = 12,250 Ω
or half the present impedance.
A parallel resistor of 24,500 Ω will produce the required reduction in Q as band-
width increases. In real design situations, things are a bit more complex—one must 
consider factors such as shape of the bandpass curve.
2.31  Lecture on Decibels
In electronics, often you will encounter situations where you will need to compare 
the relative amplitudes or the relative powers between two signals. For example, if an 
amplifier has an output voltage that is 10 times the input voltage, you can set up a ratio:
 
Vout/Vin = 10 VAC/1 VAC = 10
and give the ratio a special name—called gain. If you have a device whose output 
voltage is 10 times smaller than the input voltage, the gain ratio will be less than 1:
 
Vout/Vin = 1 VAC/10 VAC = 0.10
In this case, you call the ratio the attenuation.
Using ratios to make comparisons between two signals or powers is done all the 
time—not only in electronics. However, there are times when the range over which 
the ratio of amplitudes between two signals or the ratio of powers between two sig-
nals becomes inconveniently large. For example, if you consider the range over which 
the human ear can perceive different levels of sound intensity (average power per area 
of air wave), you would find that this range is very large, from about 10−12 to 1 W/m2. 
Attempting to plot a graph of sound intensity versus, say, the distance between your 
ear and the speaker, would be difficult, especially if you are plotting a number of 
points at different ends of the scale—the resolution gets nasty. You can use special log 
paper to automatically correct this problem, or you can stick to normal linear graph 
paper by first “shrinking” your values logarithmically. For this we use decibels.
To start off on the right foot, a bel is defined as the logarithm of a power ratio. It 
gives us a way to compare power levels with each other and with some reference 
power. The bel is defined as:
 
bel
log
1
0
P
P
=



 
(2.88)
where P0 is the reference power and P1 is the power you are comparing with the refer-
ence power.

Chapter 2: Theory    205
In electronics, the bel is often used to compare electrical power levels; however, 
what’s more common in electronics and elsewhere is to use decibels, abbreviated dB. 
A decibel is 1⁄10 of a bel (similar to a millimeter being 1⁄10 of a centimeter). It takes 10 deci-
bels to make 1 bel. So in light of this, we can compare power levels in terms of  decibels:

(2.89) Decibels in

Example: Express the gain of an amplifier (output power divided by input power) in 
terms of decibels, if the amplifier takes a 1- W signal and boosts it up to a 50- W signal.
Answer: Let P0 represent the 1- W reference power, and let P1 be the compared power:

The amplifier in this example has a gain of nearly 17.00 dB (17 decibels).
Sometimes when comparing signal levels in an electronic circuit, we know the 
voltage or current of the signal, but not the power. Though it’s possible to calculate 
the power, given the circuit impedance, we take a shortcut by simply plugging ac 
Ohm’s law into the powers in the decibel expression. Recall that P = V2/Z = I2Z. Now, 
this holds true only as long as the impedance of the circuit  doesn’t change when the 
voltage or current changes. As long as the impedance remains the same, we get a 
comparison of voltage signals and current signals in terms of decibels:

In the expressions above we used the laws of logarithms to remove square terms. 
For example:
10 log (V1
2/V0
2) = 10(log V1
2 − log V0
2)
= 10(2 log V1 − 2 log V0) = 20(log V1 − log V2)
= 20 log (V1/V0).
Notice that the impedance terms cancel and the final result is a factor of 2 greater—a 
result of the square terms in the log being pushed out (see law of logarithms). The 
power and voltage and current expressions are all fundamentally the same—they are 
all based on the ratio of powers.
There are several power ratios you should learn to recognize and be able to associ-
ate with the corresponding decibel representations.
For example, when doubling power, the final power is always 2 times the initial (or 
reference) power—it  doesn’t make a difference if you are going from 1 to 2 W, 40 to 

206    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
80 W, or 500 to 1000 W, the ratio is always 2. In decibels, a power ratio of 2 is repre-
sented as:
 
dB = 10 log (2) = 3.01 dB
There is a 3.01- dB gain if the output power is twice the input power. Usually, people 
don’t care about the .01 fraction and simply refer to the power doubling as a 3- dB 
increase in power.
When the power is cut in half, the ratio is always 0.5 or 1/2. Again, it  doesn’t mat-
ter if you’re going from 1000 to 500 W, 80 to 40 W, or 2 to 1 W, the ratio is still 0.5. In 
decibels, a power ratio of 0.5 is represented as:
 
dB = 10 log (0.5) = −3.01 dB
A negative sign indicates a decrease in power. Again, people usually ignore the .01 
fraction and simply refer to the power being cut in half as a −3- dB change in power 
or, more logically, a 3- dB decrease in power (the term “decrease” eliminates the need 
for the negative sign).
Now if you increase the power by 4, you can avoid using the decibels formula and 
simply associate such an increase with doubling two times: 3.01 dB + 3.01 dB = 6.02 dB 
or around 6 dB. Likewise, if you increase the power by 8, you, in effect, double four 
times, so the power ratio in decibels is 3.01 × 4 = 12.04, or around 12 dB.
The same relationship is true of power decreases. Each time you cut the power in 
half, there is a 3.01- dB, or around 3- dB decrease. Cutting the power by four times is 
akin to cutting in half twice, or 3.01 + 3.01 dB = 6.02 dB, or around a 6- dB decrease. 
Again, you can avoid stating “decrease” and simply say that there is a change of −6 dB.
Table 2.12 shows the relationship between several common decibel values and 
the power change associated with those values. The current and voltage changes are 
also included, but these are valid only if the impedance is the same for both values.

2.31.1  Alternative Decibel Representations
It is often convenient to compare a certain power level with some standard refer-
ence. For example, suppose you measured the signal coming into a receiver from 
an antenna and found the power to be 2 × 10−13 mW. As this signal goes through the 
receiver, it increases in strength until it finally produces some sound in the receiver 
speaker or headphones. It is convenient to describe these signal levels in terms of 
decibels. A common reference power is 1 mW. The decibel value of a signal compared 
to 1 mW is specified as “dBm” to mean decibels compared to 1 mW. In our example, 
the signal strength at the receiver input is:
 
dB
10 log 2
10
mW
1 mW
127 dBm
13
m =
×



= −

There are many other reference powers used, depending upon the circuits and power 
levels. If you use 1 W as the reference power, then you would specify dBW. Antenna 
power gains are often specified in relation to a dipole (dBd) or an isotropic radiator 
(dBi). Anytime you see another letter following dB, you will know that some reference 
power is being specified. For example, to describe the magnitudes of a voltage relative 
to a 1- V reference, you indicate the level in decibels by placing a “V” at the end of dB, 
giving units of dBV (again, impedances must stay the same). In acoustics, dB, SPL is 
used to describe the pressure of one signal in terms of a reference pressure of 20 µPa. 
The term decibel is also used in the context of sound (see Sec. 15.1).
2.32  Input and Output Impedance
2.32.1  Input Impedance
Input impedance ZIN is the impedance “seen” looking into the input of a circuit or 
device (see Fig. 2.186). Input impedance gives you an idea of how much current can 
be drawn into the input of a device. Because a complex circuit usually contains reac-
tive components such as inductors and capacitors, the input impedance is frequency 
sensitive. Therefore, the input impedance may allow only a little current to enter at 
one frequency, while highly impeding current enters at another frequency. At low 
frequencies (less than 1 kHz) reactive components may have less influence, and the 
term input resistance may be used—only the real resistance is dominant. The effects of 
capacitance and inductance are generally more significant at high frequencies.
When the input impedance is small, a relatively large current can be drawn into 
the input of the device when a voltage of specific frequency is applied to the input. 
FIGURE 2.186  

208    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
This typically has an effect of dropping the source voltage of the driver circuit feed-
ing the device’s input. (This is especially true if the driver circuit has a large output 
impedance.) A device with low input impedance is an audio speaker (typically 4 or 
8 Ω), which draws lots of current to drive the voice coil.
When the input impedance is large, on the other hand, a small current is drawn 
into the device when a voltage of specific frequency is applied to the input, and, 
hence,  doesn’t cause a substantial drop in source voltage of the driver circuit feeding 
the input. An op amp is a device with a very large input impedance (1 to 10 MΩ); 
one of its inputs (there are two) will practically draw no current (in the nA range). In 
terms of audio, a hi-fi preamplifier that has a 1- MΩ radio input, a 500- kΩ CD input, 
and a 100- kΩ tap input all have high impedance input due to the preamp being a 
voltage amplifier not a current amplifier—something we will discuss later.
As a general rule of thumb, in terms of transmitting a signal, the input impedance 
of a device should be greater than the output impedance of the circuit supplying the 
signal to the input. Generally, the value should be 10 times as great to ensure that the 
input will not overload the source of the signal and reduce the strength by a substan-
tial amount. In terms of calculations and such, the input impedance is by definition 
equal to:
 
Z
V
I
in
in
in
=
 
For example, Fig. 2.187 shows how to determine what the input impedance is for 
two resistor circuits. Notice that in example 2, when a load is attached to the output, 
the input impedance must be recalculated, taking R2 and Rload in parallel.
In Sec. 2.33.1, which covers filter circuits, you’ll see how the input impedance 
becomes dependent on frequency.
2.32.2  Output Impedance
Output impedance ZOUT refers to the impedance looking back into the output of a 
device. The output of any circuit or device is equivalent to an output impedance ZOUT 
in series with an ideal voltage source VSOURCE. Figure 2.186 shows the equivalent cir-
cuit; it represents the combined effect of all the voltage sources and the effective total

impedance (resistances, capacitance, and inductance) connected to the output side of 
the circuit. You can think of the equivalent circuit as a Thevenin equivalent circuit, 
in which case it should be clear that the VSOURCE present in Fig. 2.186 isn’t necessarily 
the actual supply voltage of the circuit but the Thevenin equivalent voltage. As with 
input impedance, output impedance can be frequency dependent. The term output 
resistance is used in cases where there is little reactance within the circuit, or when the 
frequency of operation is low (say, less than 1 kHz) and reactive effects are of little 
consequence; the effects of capacitance and inductance are generally most significant 
at high frequencies.
When the output impedance is small, a relatively large output current can be 
drawn from the device’s output without significant drop in output voltage. A source 
with an output impedance much lower than the input impedance of a load to which 
it is attached will suffer little voltage loss driving current through its output imped-
ance. For example, a lab dc power supply can be viewed as an ideal voltage source in 
series with a small internal resistance. A decent supply will have an output imped-
ance in the milliohm (mΩ) range, meaning it can supply considerable current to a 
load without much drop in supply voltage. A battery typically has a higher internal 
resistance and tends to suffer a more substantial drop in supply voltage as the current 
demands increase. In general, a small output impedance (or resistance) is considered 
a good thing, since it means that little power is lost to resistive heating in the imped-
ance and a larger current can be sourced. Op amps, which, we saw, have large input 
impedance and tend to have low output impedance.
When the output impedance is large, on the other hand, a relatively small output 
current can be drawn from the output of a device before the voltage at the output 
drops substantially. If a source with a large output impedance attempts to drive a 
load that has a much smaller input impedance, only a small portion appears across 
the load; most is lost driving the output current through the output impedance.
Again, the rule of thumb for efficient signal transfer is to have an output imped-
ance that is at least 1⁄10 that of the load’s input impedance to which it is attached.
In terms of calculations, the output impedance of a circuit is simply its Thevenin 
equivalent resistance RTHEV. The output impedance is sometimes called the source 
impedance. In terms of determining the output impedance in circuit analysis, it 
amounts to “killing” the source (shorting it) and finding the equivalent impedance 
between the output terminals—the Thevenin impedance.
For example, in Fig. 2.188, to determine the output impedance of this circuit, we 
effectively find the Thevinin resistance by “shorting the source” and removing the 
load, and determining the impedance between the output terminals. In this case, 
the output impedance is simply R1 and R2 in parallel.

In Sec. 2.3.1, when we cover filter circuits, you’ll see how the output impedance 
becomes dependent on frequency.
2.33  Two-Port Networks and Filters
2.33.1  Filters
By combining resistors, capacitors, and inductors in special ways, you can design 
networks that are capable of passing certain frequencies of signals while rejecting 
others. This section examines four basic kinds of filters: low- pass, high- pass, band-
pass, and notch filters.
Low- Pass Filters
The simple RC filter shown in Fig. 
2.189 acts as a low- pass filter—it 
passes low frequencies but rejects high 
frequencies.
Example: To figure out how this net-
work works, we find the transfer func-
tion. We begin by using the voltage 
divider to find 
out
V
 in terms of 
in
V , and 
consider there is no load (open output 
or RL = ∞):

Intuitively, we imagine that when the 
input voltage is very low in frequency, 
the capacitor’s reactance is high, so 
it draws little current, thus keeping 
the output amplitude near the input 
amplitude. However, as the frequency 
of the input signal increases, the capac-
itor’s reactance decreases and the 
capacitor draws more current, which 
in turn causes the output voltage to 
drop. Figure 2.189 shows attenuation 
versus frequency graphs—one graph 
expresses the attenuation in decibels.
The capacitor produces a delay, as shown in the phase plot in Fig. 2.189. At very 
low frequency, the output voltage follows the input—they have similar phases. As 
the frequency rises, the output starts lagging the input. At the cutoff frequency,  
the output voltage lags by 45°. As the frequency goes to infinity, the phase lag 
approaches 90°.
Figure 2.190 shows an RL low- pass filter that uses inductive reactance as the 
 frequency- sensitive element instead of capacitive reactance, as was the case in the 
RC filter.

Intuitively we imagine that when the input voltage is very low in frequency, the induc-
tor  doesn’t have a hard time passing current to the output. However, as the frequency 
gets big, the inductor’s reactance increases, and the signal becomes more attenuated 
at the output. Figure 2.190 shows attenuation versus frequency graphs—one graph 
expresses the attenuation in decibels.
The inductor produces a delay, as shown in the phase plot in Fig. 2.190. At very 
low frequency, the output voltage follows the input—they have similar phases. As 
the frequency rises, the output starts lagging the input. At the cutoff frequency,  
the output voltage lags by 45°. As the frequency goes to infinity, the phase lag 
approaches 90°.

where the source resistance is ignored. The output impedance also depends on the 
frequency ω. For good voltage coupling, the output impedance of this filter should be 
much smaller than the input impedance of the next stage. The maximum value of Zout 
is also an important number, and it is maximum when the impedance of the inductor 
is infinity (

Intuitively, we imagine that when the 
input voltage is very low in frequency, 
the capacitor’s reactance is very high, 
and hardly any signal is passed to the 
output. However, as the frequency rises, 
the capacitor’s reactance decreases, and 
there is little attenuation at the out-
put. Figure  2.194 shows attenuation 
versus frequency graphs—one graph 
expresses the attenuation in decibels.
In terms of phase, at very low fre-
quency the output leads the input in 
phase by 90°. As the frequency rises to 
the cutoff frequency, the output leads by 
45°. When the frequency goes toward 
infinity, the phase approaches 0, the point 
where the capacitor acts like a short.

Intuitively, we imagine that when the input voltage is very low in frequency, the 
inductor’s reactance is very low, so most of the current is diverted to ground—the sig-
nal is greatly attenuated at the output. However, as the frequency rises, the inductor’s 
reactance increases and less current is passed to ground—the attenuation decreases. 
Figure 2.195 shows attenuation versus frequency graphs—one graph  expresses the 
attenuation in decibels.
In terms of phase, at very low frequency the output leads the input in phase by 90°. 
As the frequency rises to the cutoff frequency, the output leads by 45°. When the fre-
quency goes toward infinity, the phase approaches 0, the point where the inductor acts 
like an open circuit.

Bandpass Filter
The RLC bandpass filter in Fig. 2.196 acts 
to pass a narrow range of frequencies 
(band) while attenuating or rejecting all 
other frequencies.

FIGURE 2.196  The parallel bandpass filter shown here yields char-
acteristics similar to those of the previous bandpass filter. However, 
unlike the previous filter, as you approach the resonant frequency of 
the tuned circuit, the LC (RL coil) section’s impedance gets large, not 
allowing current to be diverted away from the load. On either side of 
resonance, the impedance goes down, diverting current away from load.

The notch filter in Fig. 2.197 acts to pass a wide range of frequencies, while attenuat-
ing (rejecting) a narrow band of frequencies.
Example: To find the transfer function or attenuation 
of the unloaded RLC circuit, we set up equations for 
Vin and Vout:

This is the transfer function for an unloaded output. Now 
we get more realistic and have a load resistance attached 
to the output. However, in this case, the load resistance 
is so large that we can assume it draws inconsequential 
current, so we don’t need to place it into the equation:

The attenuation versus frequency graph based on this 
equation is shown in Fig. 2.197.
FIGURE 2.197  The notch filter shown here yields stop-
band characteristics similar to those of the previous 
notch filter. However, unlike the previous filter, as you 
approach the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit, 
the LC (RL coil) section’s impedance gets large, not al-
lowing current to be sent to the load. On either side of 
resonance, the impedance goes down, allowing current 
to reach load.

2.33.2  Attenuators
Often it is desirable to attenuate a sinusoidal voltage by an amount that is indepen-
dent of frequency. We can do this by using a voltage divider, since its output is inde-
pendent of frequency. Figure 2.198 shows a simple voltage divider attenuator network 
inserted between a source and a load circuit to decrease the source signal’s magnitude 
before it reaches the load. As we go through this example, you will pick up additional 
insight into input and output impedances.
Example: In (a), the source has an output 
impedance equal to the internal resis-
tance of the source:
Zout = RS
In (b), the attenuator network has input 
and output impedances of:
Zin = R1 + R2
                        Zout = R2
We can come up with a transfer function 
for this, taking the same current to flow 
through R2:

If you rearrange terms, you can see this

In (c), the load has an input imped-
ance of:
Zin = RL
FIGURE 2.197  (Continued)
FIGURE 2.198  

222    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
However, when we assemble the circuit, 
the useful input and output impedances 
change. Now, looking at things from the 
point of view of the source, as shown in 
(d), the source sees an input impedance 
of the attenuator combined with the load 
impedance, which is R1 in series with the 
parallel combination of R2 and RL:

Compensated Attenuator
We just saw how a voltage divider could be used to attenuate a signal in a manner 
that is independent of frequency. However, in practice, there is always stray capaci-
tance in a real circuit, and eventually a frequency is reached at which the voltage 
divider behaves like either a low- or a high- pass filter. This problem can be overcome 
by using a compensated attenuator circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.199.
At low frequencies the circuit behaves like an ordinary resistive divider, but at high 
frequencies the capacitive reactance dominates, and the circuit behaves like a capaci-
tive voltage divider. The attenuation is independent of frequency, provided that:

In practice, one of the capacitors is usually variable, so that the attenuator can be 
adjusted to compensate for any stray capacitance.
Such compensated attenuators are often used at the input of an oscilloscope to 
raise the input resistance and lower the input capacitance so as to make the oscil-
loscope into a more nearly ideal voltmeter. However, this results in a decrease in 
sensitivity of the scope to input voltage.
2.34  Transient Circuits
Transients within circuits remove any steady- state condition. They represent a sud-
den change in voltage introduced by an external agent, such as a switch being thrown 
or a transistor switching states. During a transient, the voltages and currents through-
out the circuit readjust to a new dc value in a brief but nonnegligible time interval 
immediately following the transient event. The initial condition is a dc circuit; the 
final condition is a different dc circuit; but the interval in between—while the circuit 
is readjusting to the new conditions—may exhibit complex behavior. The introduc-
tion of a transient into a circuit containing reactive components usually requires solv-
ing differential equations, since the response is time dependent. The following simple 
example is an exception to the rule (no reactances—no differential equations), but is a 
good illustration of transient behavior, nevertheless. Refer to Fig. 2.200.
Example:
 1.  Initially the switch S is open. The instant it is closed (t = 0), VS is ap-
plied across R and current flows immediately, according to Ohm’s law. 
If the switch remains closed thereafter (t > 0), the current remains the 
same as it was at the instant S was closed:

 2.  Initially S is closed. The instant it is open (t = 0), the voltage across and

 3.  Initially S is in position A (t < 0), and the voltage across R is V1, thus 
making the current I = V1/R. Neglecting the time delay for the switch ele-
ment to move to position B, the instant S is thrown to position B (t = 0), the 
voltage immediately changes and the voltage across R is V2, thus making 
I = V2/R.

The preceding example may have seemed like child’s play, but there is an important 
thing to notice from it. Just before the transient event of switching, the voltage across 
FIGURE 2.200 

224    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
and the current through the resistor were both zero (or a constant value). Immediately 
after the switching event, the voltage and current jumped to new levels instanta-
neously. The resistor’s natural response after the event was time independent as indi-
cated by Ohm’s law, V = IR. In other words, under a forced response (source is now in 
the picture), the resistor voltage can change instantly to a new steady state; under a 
forced response, the resistor current can change instantly to a new steady state.
When we consider capacitors and inductors, a forced response (applying or remov-
ing source influence) does not result in voltages and currents instantly jumping to a 
new steady state. Instead, there is a natural response after the forced response where 
the voltage and currents vary with time. With the help of Kirchhoff’s laws, transient 
circuits can be modeled; the resulting differential equations take into account tran-
sient events by applying initial conditions. The following two examples, which were 
actually covered earlier in the capacitor and inductor sections, show what happens 
when voltage is suddenly applied to an RL and an RC circuit.

This is an example of a linear first- order homogeneous 
differential equation. It is linear because the unknown 
appears only once to the first power in each term. It  
is first- order because the highest derivative is the first, 
and it is homogeneous because the right- hand side, 
which would contain any terms not dependent on the 
unknown I, is zero. The solution to all linear first- order 
homogeneous differential equations is of the form:
I = I0eαt
where the constant α is determined by substituting the 
solution back into the differential equation and solving 
the resulting algebraic equation:
1

In this case the solution is:

α = −
The constant I0 is determined from the initial condition 
at t = 0, at which time the voltage across the capacitor 
cannot change abruptly, and thus if the capacitor has 
zero voltage across it before the switch is closed, it will 
also have zero voltage immediately after the switch is 
closed. The capacitor initially behaves like a short cir-
cuit, and the initial current is:

Once you’ve memorized the response equations for a charging and discharging 
RC as well as the equations for an energizing and a deenergizing RL circuit (see fol-
lowing equations), it’s often possible to incorporate these equations into transient 
circuits without starting from scratch and doing the differential equations.

The following example problems illustrate how this is done.
Example 1: The circuit in Fig. 2.203 was under steady state before the switch was 
opened. Determine the current flow I2 the instant the switch is opened, and then 
determine both I2 and the voltage across R2 1 ms after that.
Answer: Unlike a resistor’s voltage, a capacitor’s voltage cannot 
change instantaneously (instead, it takes time). Because of this, 
the instant the switch is opened, the capacitor voltage remains 
as it was prior to the event:
VC (0+) = VC (0−) = 24 V
where 0+ means the instant after the switch is flipped, and 0− 
means the instant before the switch is flipped.
The instant after the switch is opened (t = 0+), the source is no longer part of 
the circuit, and we are left with the capacitor and two resistors all in series. Using 
Kirchhoff’s law for this new circuit:
 
VC + VR1 + VR2 = 0
 
24 V + I(10 Ω + 20 Ω) = 0
 
I = −24 V/30 Ω = 0.800 A
FIGURE 2.203 

Chapter 2: Theory    227
This is the same current through R2 the instant the switch is opened. To determine the 
current 1 ms (t = 0.001 s) after the switch is opened, simply treat the circuit as an RC 
discharge circuit (see Eq. 2.44), taking R = R1 + R2:

The voltage across R2 at this time is:
 
VR2 = IR2 = (0.573 A)(20 Ω) = 11.46 V
Example 2: In the circuit in Fig. 2.204, determine the current I when the switch is 
opened (t = 0). Also determine the voltage across the resistor and inductor at t = 0.1 s.
Answer: When the switch is opened, the inductor voltage cannot change instan-
taneously, so it resembles a short, which gives rise to the forced response:
24 V
(10

)
0.80 A
I f =

Ω=
where the inductor’s resistance is in series with R.
For any time after t = 0, the natural, or source- free, response is simply a deen-
ergizing RL circuit, where R is the combined resistance of the fixed resistor and 
the resistance of the inductor:
In = Ce−Rt/L = Ce−30t/5 = Ce−6t
The total current is the sum of the forced and natural responses:
 
I = If + In = 0.80 A + Ce−6t
The trick then is to find C by finding the current I(0+):
 
I(0+) = VS/RL = 24 V/10 Ω = 2.4 A
 
2.4 A

Thus:
 
I(t) = (0.8 + 1.60 e−6t) A
The voltage across the resistor and the inductor at t = 0.1 s can be found by first cal-
culating the current at this time:
 
I(0.1) = (0.8 + 1.6e(−6 × 0.1))A = 1.68 A
Then:
 
VR = IR = 1.68 A × 20 Ω = 33.6 V
 
VL = 24 V − VR = 24 V − 33.6 V = −9.6 V
FIGURE 2.204 

228    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Example 3: Calculate the current IL in the circuit in Fig. 2.205 at t = 0.3 s.
Answer: Notice that the 12- Ω resistor has no effect on the current IL. 
Therefore, you get a simple RL energizing circuit with RL in series 
with L:

So at t = 0.3 s:
IL = (3 A)(1 − e−1.3(0.3 s)) = 0.99 A
Here are some important things to notice during a forced response in regard to 
resistors, capacitors, and inductors:
Resistor: Under a forced response, a voltage is instantly placed across a resistor and 
a current immediately flows. There is no delay in voltage or current response 
(ideally).
Capacitor: Under a forced response, the voltage across a capacitor cannot change 
instantly, so at the instant a transition occurs it acts like an open circuit or con-
stant voltage source. The voltage at instant t = 0− or t = 0+ is a constant—the voltage 
that was present before the event. Also, at the instant t = 0− or t = 0+ the current is 
zero, since no time transpires for charge to accumulate. However, after t = 0+, the 
capacitor voltage and current have a natural response that is a function of time.
Inductor: Under a forced response, an inductor voltage cannot change instantaneously, 
so it acts like a short, meaning there is no voltage across it at t = 0− or t = 0+. The 
current, however, at t = 0− or t = 0+ will be a constant—the value of the current 
prior to the transient event. However, after t = 0+, the inductor voltage and current 
have a natural response that is a function of time.
(Recall that t = 0− means the instant prior to the transient event, and t = 0+ is the instant 
immediately after the transient event.)
Sometimes determining the voltage and currents within a transient circuit is a 
bit tricky, and requires a different approach than we encountered in the last three 
examples. The following few examples provide a good illustration of this.
Example 4: In the circuit in Fig. 2.206, determine the current through 
the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor the instant before 
the switch is closed (t = 0−) and the instant after the switch is closed 
(t = 0+). Find IC and IL when the switch has been closed for t = 0.5 s.
Answer: Before the switch is closed, the capacitor acts as an open cir-
cuit, preventing current from flowing. The instant after the switch 
is closed, the capacitor cannot change in voltage instantaneously, so 
the current is still zero. The instant before and the instant after the 
FIGURE 2.205 
FIGURE 2.206 

Chapter 2: Theory    229
switch is closed, the voltage across the capacitor is equal to the supply voltage. All 
this can be expressed by:
 
IL (0−) = IL (0+) = 0
 
VC (0−) = VC (0+) = 18 V
When the switch is closed, we have a source- free RC circuit for which:
 
IC = Be−t/R1C = Be−t/(1.5)
At t = 0+,
 
IC (0+)R1 + VC (0+) = 18 V

response) plus the natural response of an RL circuit:

circuit 0.6 s after the switch is opened. What is the induced voltage in the inductor at 
t = 0.4 s?
Answer: Since the switch is initially closed, the capacitor is 
shorted out, there is no voltage across it, and the current is sim-
ply equal to the supply voltage divided by the resistance of the 
inductor:

The characteristic roots are:

The complete current response is the sum of the forced and natural responses:
 
I = If + In = 0 + A1e−0.46t + A2e−0.04t
I(0+) = 4 implies that A1 + A2 = 4.

2.34.1  Series RLC Circuit
There’s another transient example, which is a bit heavy in the math but is a  
classic analog of many other phenomena found in science and engineering. See 
Fig. 2.209.

Since either value of α represents a solution to the original differential equation, the 
most general solution is one in which the two possible solutions are multiplied by 
arbitrary constants and added together:
 
I = I1eα1t + I2eα2t
The constants I1 and I2 must be determined from the initial conditions. An nth- order 
differential equation will generally have n constants that must be determined from 
initial conditions. In this case the constants can be evaluated from a knowledge of I(0) 
and dI/dt(0). Since the current in the inductor was zero for t < 0, and since it cannot 
change abruptly, we know that:
 
I(0) = 0
The initial voltage across the inductor is the same as across the capacitor, so that:

where α1 and α2 are given in Eq. 2.92.
The solution to the preceding equation has a unique character, depending on 
whether the quantity under the square root in Eq. 2.92 is positive, zero, or negative. 
We consider these three cases.
Case 1: Overdamped
For R2 > 4L/C, the quantity under the square root is positive, and both values of α are 
negative with |α2| > |α1|. The solution is the sum of a slowly decaying positive term 
and a more rapidly decaying negative term of equal initial magnitude. The solution 
is sketched in Fig. 2.210. An important limiting case is the one in which R2 >> 4L/C. 
In that limit, the square root can be approximated as:

In this limit, the current rises very rapidly (in a time ∼L/R) to a value near V0/R and 
then decays very slowly back to zero. The overdamped response curve is shown in 
Fig. 2.210.

Chapter 2: Theory    233
Case 2: Critically Damped
For R2 = 4L/C, the quantity under the square root is zero, and α1 = α2. Equation 2.93 
is then zero divided by zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the method of solution 
outlined here fails. A more productive approach is to let

The shape of the curve is not very different from the overdamped case, except that it 
approaches zero as fast as possible without overshooting the t axis and going nega-
tive. The critically damped response curve is shown in Fig. 2.211.
Critical damping is difficult to achieve: only a small change in R moves from this 
point. Small temperature change will cause that to occur. Energy transfer from C to L 
is now smaller than loss in R.
FIGURE 2.210

Notice that the solution is very different from the others, since it is oscillatory, with 
the oscillation amplitude decaying exponentially in time, as shown in Fig. 2.212. 
FIGURE 2.211  

Chapter 2: Theory    235
Although ω is referred to as the angular frequency, note that it has units of radians 
per second, and it is related to the usual frequency f, which has units of cycles per 
second or hertz ω = 2πf. The period of oscillation is T = 1/f = 2π/ω.
The underdamped case is very interesting. At t = 0, all the energy is stored in the 
capacitor. As the current increases, energy is dissipated in the resistor and stored in 
the inductor until one- quarter of a cycle has passed, at which time there is no energy 
left in the capacitor. But as time goes on, the energy in the inductor decreases and 
the energy in the capacitor increases until one- half cycle has elapsed, at which time 
all the energy except that dissipated in the resistor is back in the capacitor. The 
energy continues to slosh back and forth, until it is eventually all dissipated by the 
resistor. A series LC circuit without any resistance would oscillate forever without 
damping.
This type of differential equation that we have seen for a series RLC circuit appears 
in many areas of science and engineering. It is referred to as a damped harmonic oscil-
lator. Shock absorbers on an automobile, for example, are part of a mechanical har-
monic oscillator designed to be nearly critically damped.
2.35  Circuits with Periodic Nonsinusoidal Sources
Suppose that you are given a periodic nonsinusoidal voltage (e.g., a squarewave, 
triangle wave, or ramp) that is used to drive a circuit containing resistors, capacitors, 
and inductors. How do you analyze the circuit? The circuit is not dc, so you cannot 
use dc theorems on it. The circuit is not sinusoidal, so you cannot directly apply com-
plex impedances on it. What do you do?
FIGURE 2.212  

236    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
If all else fails, you might assume that the only way out would be to apply 
Kirchhoff’s laws on it. Well, before going any further, how do you mathematically 
represent the source voltage in the first place? That is, even if you could set up 
Kirchhoff’s equations and such, you still have to plug in the source voltage term. For 
example, how do you mathematically represent a squarewave? In reality, coming 
up with an expression for a periodic nonsinusoidal source is not easy. However, for 
the sake of argument, let’s pretend that you can come up with a mathematical rep-
resentation of the waveform. If you plug this term into Kirchhoff’s laws, you would 
again get differential equations (you could not use complex impedance then, because 
things are not sinusoidal).
To solve this dilemma most efficiently, it would be good to avoid differential 
equations entirely and at the same time be able to use the simplistic approach of 
complex impedances. The only way to satisfy both these conditions is to express a 
nonsinusoidal wave as a superposition of sine waves. In fact, a man by the name 
of Fourier discovered just such a trick. He figured out that a number of sinusoidal 
waves of different frequencies and amplitudes could be added together in a special 
manner to produce a superimposed pattern of any nonsinusoidal periodic wave pat-
tern. More technically stated, a periodic nonsinusoidal waveform can be represented 
as a Fourier series of sines and cosines, where the waveform is a summation over a 
set of discrete, harmonically related frequencies.
2.35.1  Fourier Series
A time- dependent voltage or current is either periodic or nonperiodic. Figure 2.213 
shows an example of a periodic waveform with period T.
The wave is assumed to continue indefinitely in both the +t and the −t directions. 
A periodic function can be displaced by one period, and the resulting function is 
identical to the original function:
 
V(t ± T) = V(t)

The constant term a0/2 is the average value of V(t). The superposition theorem then 
allows you to analyze any linear circuit having periodic sources by considering the 
behavior of the circuit for each of the sinusoidal components of the Fourier series. 
Although most of the examples that we will use have voltage or current as the depen-
dent variable and time as the independent variable, the Fourier methods are very 
general and apply to any sufficiently smooth function f(t).
Using Euler’s expression, ejθ = cos θ + j sin θ, we can convert Eq. 2.98 into a general 
expression for a periodic waveform as the sum of complex numbers:

(2.102)
By allowing both positive and negative frequencies (n > 0 and n < 0), it is possible to 
choose the Cn in such a way that the summation is always a real number. The value of 
Cn can be determined by multiplying both sides of Eq. 2.102 by e−jmω0t, where m is an 
integer, and then integrating over a period. Only the term with m = n survives, and 
the result is:

Note that C−n is the complex conjugate of Cn, and so the imaginary parts of Eq. 2.102 
will always cancel, and the resulting V(t) is real. The n = 0 term has a particularly 
simple interpretation; it is simply the average value of V(t):

and corresponds to the dc component of the voltage. Whether the integrals in the 
preceding expression are over the interval −T/2 to T/2 or some other interval such 
as 0 to T is purely a matter of convenience, so long as the interval is continuous and 
has duration T.

238    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The following example illustrates a Fourier series of a squarewave, as depicted in 
Fig. 2.214.
To create a mathematical expression in terms of a series of complex numbers, as 
Eq. 2.102 requests, we first determine the constants from Eq. 2.103 by breaking the 
integral into two parts for which V(t) is constant:

Note that cos nπ is +1 when n is even (0,2,4, . . .) and −1 when n is odd (1,3,5, . . .), so 
that all the even values of Cn are zero. Any periodic function, when displaced in time 
by half a period, is identical to the negative of the original function:

In this case V(t) is said to have half- wave symmetry, and its Fourier series will contain 
only odd harmonics. The squarewave is an example of such a function. If the wave 
remained at +V0 and −V0 for unequal times, the half- wave symmetry would be lost, 
and its Fourier series would then contain even as well as odd harmonics.
In addition to its half- wave symmetry, the squarewave shown in Fig. 2.214 is an 
odd function, because it satisfies the relation:
 
V(t) = −V(−t)
This property is not a fundamental property of the wave but arises purely out of the 
choice of where, with respect to the wave, the time origin (t = 0) is assumed. For exam-
ple, if the squarewave in Fig. 2.214 were displaced by a time of T/4, the resulting 
squarewave would be an even function, because it would then satisfy the relation:
 
V(t) = V(−t)
FIGURE 2.214  

Chapter 2: Theory    239
It’s important to note that an odd function can have no dc component, since the nega-
tive parts exactly cancel the positive parts on opposite sides of the time axis. The 
cosine is an even function, and the sine is an odd function. Any even function can 
be written as a sum of cosines (bn = 0 in Eq. 2.98), and any odd function can be writ-
ten as a sum of sines (an = 0 in Eq. 2.98). Most periodic functions (such as the one in 
Fig. 2.213) are neither odd nor even.
The Fourier series calculation can often be simplified by adding or subtracting a 
constant to the value of the function, or by displacing the time origin so that the func-
tion is even or odd or so that it has half- wave symmetry.

The first three terms of the preceding series (n = 1,3,5) along with their sum are plot-
ted in Fig. 2.215. Note that the series, even with as few as three terms, is beginning to 
resemble the squarewave.
For waveforms more complicated than a squarewave, the integrals are more dif-
ficult to perform, but it is still usually easier to calculate a Fourier series for a peri-
odic voltage than to solve a differential equation in which the same time- dependent 
FIGURE 2.215

voltage appears. Furthermore, tables of Fourier series for the most frequently encoun-
tered waveforms are available and provide a convenient shortcut for analyzing many 
circuits. Some common waveforms and their Fourier series are listed in Fig. 2.216.

the Fourier series to analyze a circuit with a periodic source. Here a squarewave 
source is connected to a simple RC circuit. Refer to Fig. 2.217.

The sum of the first three terms (n = 1, n = 3, n = 5) of the Fourier series for VC(t) and 
VR(t) are shown in Fig. 2.217b. As n approaches infinity, the waveforms approach the 
real deal.
Note that circuits with squarewave sources can also be analyzed as transient cir-
cuits. In the circuit in Fig. 2.217a, during a half period (such as 0 < t < T/2) when the 
source voltage is constant, the voltage across the capacitor is expressed as:
 
VC(t) = A + Be−t/RC
The constants A and B can be determined from
 
VC (∞) = A = V0
 
VC (T/2) = A + Be−T/2RC = −VC(0) = −A − B
The first equation results from knowing that if the source remains at +V0 forever, the 
capacitor would charge to voltage V0. The second equation is required to ensure that 
the function has half- wave symmetry. Hence,

Nonperiodic voltages and currents can also be represented as a superposition of sine 
waves as with the Fourier series. However, instead of a summation over a set of dis-
crete, harmonically related frequencies, the waveforms have a continuous spectrum 
of frequencies. It is possible to think of a nonperiodic function as a periodic function 
with an infinite period. The fundamental angular frequency, which was ω0 = 2π/T for 
the Fourier series, approaches zero as the period approaches infinity. In this case, to 
remind us that we’re now dealing with an infinitesimal quantity, we represent the 
angular frequency as ∆ω. The various harmonics within the waveform are separated 
by the infinitesimal ∆ω, so that all frequencies are present. The waveform as a sum-
mation, as was done with Fourier series, is:

Although T is infinite, the term CnT is usually finite in value. The CnT term is referred 
to as the Fourier transform of V(t) and is rewritten as V(ω). After integration, it is only 
a function of angular frequency ω. The following two equations are called a Fourier 
transform pair:

These two equations are symmetric. (V(ω) is sometimes defined as

the symmetry even more perfect.)
Like the coefficients of the Fourier series, the Fourier transform V(ω) is generally 
complex, unless V(t) is an even function of time. When V(t) is an odd function of time, 
the Fourier transform V(ω) is entirely imaginary. For this reason, when plotting a 
Fourier transform, it is customary to plot either the magnitude |V(ω)| or the square 
of the magnitude |V(ω)|2—referred to as the power spectrum—as a function of ω.
As an example, we will calculate the Fourier transform of the square pulse shown 
in Fig. 2.218a and given by:

The magnitude |V(ω)| is plotted as a function of ω in Fig. 2.218b. As before, most of 
the Fourier spectrum is a band of frequencies within about 1/τ of zero.
In practice, if we were to attach a nonperiodic pulse, such as our square pulse, to 
some complex circuit with total impedance Z(ω), we could determine the current as a 
function of time (and thus individual voltages and currents within the circuit) by first 
using the Fourier transform voltage for the square pulse,

Using the Fourier transforms for a problem like this seems incredibly difficult—try 
placing a simple RCL network into the impedance and solving the integrals. However, 
the Fourier transform, as nasty as it can get, provides the easiest method of solution 
for the nonperiodic problems.
In summary, analyzing a circuit by this method involves first converting to the fre-
quency domain by calculating the Fourier transform of the sources from Eq. 2.106, then 
using the impedance to determine the Fourier transform of the unknown Eq. 2.107, 
FIGURE 2.218  

Chapter 2: Theory    245
and finally converting back to the time domain by calculating the inverse Fourier 
transform of the unknown from Eq. 2.105. Solving things this way, using the difficult 
integrals, is actually usually much easier than solving the corresponding differential 
equation with a time- dependent source.
Note that special devices called spectrum analyzers can display the Fourier trans-
form |V(ω)| of a voltage as a function of frequency.
Enough of the difficult stuff; let’s let a simulator do the thinking for us.
2.37  SPICE
SPICE is a computer program that simulates analog circuits. It was originally designed 
for the development of integrated circuits, from which it derives its name: Simulation 
Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis, or SPICE for short.
The origin of SPICE is traced back to another circuit simulation program called 
CANCER (Computer Analysis of Non- Linear Circuits Excluding Radiation), devel-
oped by Ronald Rohrer, of University of California–Berkeley, along with some of his 
students. CANCER was able to perform dc, ac, and transient analysis, and included 
special linear- companion models for basic active devices like diodes (Shockley equa-
tion) and bipolar transistors (Ebers- Moll equations).
When Rohrer left Berkeley, CANCER was rewritten and renamed SPICE, released 
as version 1 to the public in 1972. SPICE 1 was based on nodal analysis and included 
revised models for bipolar transistors (using Gummel- Poon equations), as well as 
new models for JFET and MOSFET devices.
In 1975, SPICE 2 was introduced, with modified nodal analysis (MNA) that 
replaced the old nodal analysis, and now supported voltage sources and induc-
tors. Many things were added and many alterations were made to SPICE 2. The  
last version of SPICE 2 to be written in FORTRAN, version SPICE 2G.6, came out  
in 1983.
In 1985, SPICE 3 appeared on the scene, written in the C programming language 
rather than FORTRAN. It included a graphical interface for viewing results and also 
polynomial capacitors and inductors and voltage- controlled sources, as well as mod-
els for MESFETs, lossy transmission lines, and nonideal switches. SPICE 3 also had 
improved semiconductor models and was designed to eliminate many convergence 
problems found in previous versions. From this time on, commercial versions of 
SPICE have appeared: HSPICE, IS_SPICE, and MICROCAP and PSPICE (MicroSim’s 
PC version of SPICE).
Today, there are many user- friendly simulator programs out there that use 
SPICE as the brains behind the analysis. These high- level simulator programs allow 
you to click, drag, and drop components onto a page and draw wire connections. 
Test instruments, such as voltmeters, power meters, oscilloscopes, and spectrum 
analysis, can be dragged and connected to the circuit. Almost any type of source 
is available as well as any type of device (passive, active, digital, etc.)—MultiSim 
from Electronics Workbench contains a component library of over 13,000 models. 
Figure  2.219 shows an example screen shot depicting the various elements that 
come with a simulator. Three popular commercial simulators include MicroSim, 
TINAPro, and CircuitMaker. There are also online simulation programs such as 
CircuitLab (www.circuitlab.com) that are quick and easy to use.

2.37.1  How SPICE Works
Here we take a look at the heart of simulators—SPICE. What are the mathematical 
tricks the code in SPICE uses to simulate electrical circuits described by nonlinear dif-
ferential equations? At the core of the SPICE engine is a basic technique called nodal 
analysis. It calculates the voltage at any node, given all of the circuit resistances (or, 
inversely, their conductances) and the current sources. Whether the program is per-
forming dc, ac, or transient analysis, SPICE ultimately casts its components (linear, 
nonlinear, and energy- storage elements) into a form where the innermost calculation 
is nodal analysis.
FIGURE 2.219  Screen shot of a simulator user interface, showing the various devices, sources, test equipment, and analy-
sis capabilities. The simulator shown is MultiSim from Electronics Workbench.
Basic devices: Passive devices, diodes, LEDs, thyristors, transistors, analog amplifiers and comparators, TTL logic devices, 
CMOS logic devices, miscellaneous digital (e.g., TIL, VHDL, VERILOG HDL), mixed signal devices, indicators, RF 
devices, electromechanical devices, and so on.
Sources: dc and ac voltage and current sources; clock source; AM source and FM voltage and current sources; FSK source; 
voltage- controlled sine, square, and triangle sources as well as current- controlled ones; pulse voltage and current sources; 
exponential voltage and current sources; piecewise linear voltage and current sources; controlled one- shot, polynomial, 
and nonlinear dependent sources.
Analysis techniques: dc operating point, ac analysis, transient analysis, Fourier analysis, noise analysis, distortion analysis, 
dc sweep, sensitivity, parameter sweep, temperature sweep, pole zero, transfer function, worst case, Monte Carlo, trace 
width analysis, batched analysis, user- defined analysis, noise figure analysis, and so on.
Test equipment: Multimeter, function generator, wattmeter, oscilloscope, bode plotter, word generator, logic analyzer, 
logic converter, distortion analyzer, spectrum analyzer, network analyzer, and so on.

Chapter 2: Theory    247
Kirchhoff discovered that the total current entering a node is equal to the total 
current leaving a node. Stated another way, the sum of currents in and out of a node 
is zero. These currents can be described by equations in terms of voltages and con-
ductances. If you have more than one node, then you get more than one equation 
describing the same system (simultaneous equations). The trick then is finding the 
voltage at each node that satisfies all the equations simultaneously.
For example, let’s consider the simple circuit in Fig. 2.220. In this circuit there are 
three nodes: node 0 (which is always ground), node 1, and node 2.
Using Kirchhoff’s current law in the form of “the sum of current in and out of a 
node is zero,” we can create two equations for the two nodes 1 and 2 (0 is by default 
ground):
 
0

Since the mission here is to calculate the node voltages, we rewrite these equations in 
order to separate V1 and V2:

The trick now becomes finding values of V1 and V2 that satisfy both equations. 
Although we could solve one variable in terms of the other from one equation and 
plug it into the second equation to find the other variable, things get messy (so 
many R variables to deal with). Instead, we’ll take a cleaner approach—one that 
involves conductance G, where G = 1/R. This will make the bookkeeping easier, 
and it becomes especially important when the nodal number increases with com-
plex circuits.
Writing resistors in terms of total conductance:
 
G11 = 1/R1 + 1/R2, G21 = −1/R2, G12 = −1/R2, G22 = 1/R2 + 1/R3.
FIGURE 2.220  

248    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Thus, the system of equations is transformed into:
 
G11V1 + G12V2 = IS
 
G21V1 + G22V2 = 0
Solving the second equation for V1:
 
1
22

we then stick this into the first equation and solve for V2:

See how much cleaner the manipulations were using conductances? V2 is described 
by circuit conductances and IS alone. We still must find the numerical value of V2 
and stick it back into the V1 equation while, in the process, calculating the numerical 
values of the conductances. However, we have found circuit voltages V1 and V2 that 
satisfy both system equations.
Although the last approach  wasn’t that hard, or messy, there are times when the 
circuits become big and the node and device counts so large that bookkeeping terms 
become a nightmare. We must go a step further in coming up with a more efficient 
and elegant approach. What we do is use matrices.
In matrix form, the set of nodal equations is written:

Treating each matrix as a variable, we can rewrite the preceding equation in compact 
form:
 
G ¥ v = i 
(2.109)
In matrix mathematics, you can solve for a variable (almost) as you would in any 
other algebraic equation. Solving for v you get:
 
v = G−1 ¥ i 
(2.110)
where G−1 is the matrix inverse of G. (1/G does not exist in the matrix world.) This 
equation is the central mechanism of the SPICE algorithm. Regardless of the  analysis—
ac, dc, or transient—all components or their effects are cast into the conductance

matrix G and the node voltages are calculated by v = G−1 ¥ i, or some equivalent 
method.

2.37.2  Limitations of SPICE and Other Simulators
Simulation of a circuit is only as accurate as the behavior models in the SPICE devices 
created for it. Many simulations are based on simplified models. For more complex 
circuits or subtle behaviors, the simulation can be misleading or incorrect. This can 
mean disaster if you’re relying entirely on SPICE (or an advanced simulator based on 
SPICE) when developing circuits. SPICE can also be deceiving, since simulations are 
free of noise, crosstalk, interference, and so on—unless you incorporate these behav-
iors into the circuit. Also, SPICE is not the best predictor of component failures. You 
must know what dangers to look for and which behaviors are not modeled in your 
SPICE circuit. In short, SPICE is not a prototype substitute—the performance of the 
actual breadboard provides the final answer.
2.37.3  A Simple Simulation Example
As an example, we will look at simulating a simple RLC crossover network (which 
we will meet again in Chap. 15) with the free and easy-to-use online simulator 
CircuitLab (www.circuitlab.com). 
The first step is to draw the schematic using the editing tool (see Fig. 2.221). The 
LRC network is responsible for separating an audio signal into two parts: a low-pass 
filter to drive the low-frequency woofer speaker and a high-pass filter to drive the 
tweeter.
As well as adding the appropriate components to the design and connecting them, 
we have added an ac voltage source to represent the input signal and attached two 
labels (Tweeter and Woofer), so that we can see the results of the simulation (there 
will be labels next to our graph plots).

250    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When we are ready, we can run a simulation. In this case, we are going to carry 
out a frequency-domain simulation so that we can determine the crossover frequency 
of the network. To do this, we specify V1 as being the input as well as start and end 
frequencies. We also specify the outputs that we wish to see plotted (see Fig. 2.222).
FIGURE 2.221  CircuitLab schematic diagram.
FIGURE 2.222  CircuitLab simulation parameters.

Chapter 2: Theory    251
When we click the Simulate button, CircuitLab will run the simulation and pro-
duce an output plot, as shown in Fig. 2.223.
From Fig. 2.223, we can see that the crossover frequency where both speakers are 
receiving the same magnitude of signal is at around 1.6 kHz.
CircuitLab is a good starting point for understanding simulators. We strongly 
encourage you to try some of the sample schematics on the website and experiment 
with a few simulations.

3.1  Wires, Cables, and Connectors
Wires and cables provide low- resistance pathways for electric currents. Most electri-
cal wires are made from copper or silver and typically are protected by an insulating 
coating of plastic, rubber, or lacquer. Cables consist of a number of individually insu-
lated wires bound together to form a multiconductor transmission line. Connectors, 
such as plugs, jacks, and adapters, are used as mating fasteners to join wires and 
cable with other electrical devices.
3.1.1  Wires
A wire’s diameter is expressed in terms of a gauge number. The gauge system, as it turns 
out, goes against common sense. In the gauge system, as a wire’s diameter  increases, 
the gauge number decreases. At the same time, the resistance of the wire  decreases. 
When currents are expected to be large, smaller- gauge wires  (large- diameter wires) 
should be used. If too much current is sent through a large- gauge wire (small- 
diameter wire), the wire could become hot enough to melt. Table 3.1 shows various 
characteristics for B&S- gauged copper wire at 20°C. For rubber- insulated wire, the 
allowable current should be reduced by 30 percent.
Wire comes in solid core, stranded, or braided forms.

CHAPTER 3
This wire is useful for wiring breadboards; the solid- core ends slip easily 
into breadboard sockets and will not fray in the process. These wires 
have the tendency to snap after a number of flexes.

254    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Stranded Wire
The main conductor is comprised of a number of individual strands 
of copper. Stranded wire tends to be a better conductor than solid- core 
wire because the individual wires together comprise a greater surface 
area. Stranded wire will not break easily when flexed.
Braided Wire
A braided wire is made up of a number of individual strands of wire 
braided together. Like stranded wires, these wires are better conduc-
tors than solid- core wires, and they will not break easily when flexed. 
Braided wires are frequently used as an electromagnetic shield in noise- 
reduction cables and also may act as a wire conductor within the cable 
(e.g., coaxial cable).

wires are needed.

3.1.2  Cables
A cable consists of a multiple number of independent conductive wires. The wires 
within cables may be solid core, stranded, braided, or some combination in between. 
Typical wire configurations within cables include the following:
This wire is used for building coils and electromagnets or anything 
that requires a large number of loops, say, a tuning element in a radio 
 receiver. It is built of solid- core wire and insulated by a varnish coating. 
Typical wire sizes run from 22 to 30 gauge.

Paired Cable
This cable is made from two individually insu-
lated conductors. Often it is used in dc or low- 
frequency ac applications.
Twin Lead
This cable is a flat two- wire line, often referred  
to as 300- Ω line. The line maintains an impedance 
of 300 Ω. It is used primarily as a  transmission 
line between an antenna and a receiver (e.g., TV, 
radio). Each wire within the cable is stranded to 
reduce skin effects.
Shielded  
Twin Lead
This cable is similar to paired cable, but the 
inner wires are surrounded by a metal- foil 
wrapping that’s connected to a ground wire. 
The metal foil is designed to shield the inner 
wires from external magnetic fields—potential 
forces that can create noisy signals within the 
inner wires.
Kinds of Cables
Twisted Pair
This cable is composed of two interwound 
 insulated wires. It is similar to a paired cable, 
but the wires are held together by a twist.
The common CAT5 cable used for Ethernet, 
among other things, is based on a set of four 
twisted pairs.
Unbalanced  
Coaxial
This cable typically is used to transport high- 
frequency signals (e.g., radio frequencies). The 
cable’s geometry limits inductive and capacitive 
effects and also limits external magnetic inter-
ference. The center wire is made of solid- core 
copper or aluminium wire and acts as the hot 
lead. An insulative material, such as polyeth-
ylene, surrounds the center wire and acts to sep-
arate the center wire from a surrounding braided 
wire. The braided wire, or copper shielding, acts 
as the cold lead or ground lead. Characteristic 
impedances range from about 50 to 100 Ω.
Dual Coaxial
This cable consists of two unbalanced coaxial 
cables in one. It is used when two signals must 
be transferred independently.
Balanced 
 Coaxial
This cable consists of two solid wires insu-
lated from one another by a plastic insulator. 
Like unbalanced coaxial cable, it too has a cop-
per shielding to reduce noise pickup.  Unlike 
 unbalanced coaxial cable, the shielding does not 
act as one of the conductive paths; it only acts as 
a shield against external magnetic  interference.

Ribbon
This type of cable is used in applications where 
many wires are needed. It tends to flex easily. 
It is designed to handle low- level voltages and 
often is found in digital systems, such as com-
puters, to transmit parallel bits of information 
from one digital device to another.
Multiple  
Conductor
This type of cable consists of a number of 
 individually wrapped, color- coded wires. It is 
used when a number of signals must be sent 
through one cable.
Fiberoptic
Fiberoptic cable is used in the transport of 
electro magnetic signals, such as light. The  
conducting- core medium is made from a glass 
material surrounded by a fiberoptic clad-
ding (a glass material with a higher index of 
refraction than the core). An electromagnetic 
signal propagates down the cable by multiple 
total internal reflections. It is used in direct 
transmission of images and illumination and 
as waveguides for modulated signals used 
in  telecommunications. One cable typically 
 consists of a number of individual fibers.
117- Volt
This is a typical home appliance connector. 
It comes in unpolarized and polarized forms. 
Both forms may come with or without a 
ground wire.
Banana
This is used for connecting single wires to 
electrical equipment. It is frequently used with 
testing equipment. The plug is made from a 
four- leafed spring tip that snaps into the jack.
This is a simple connector that uses a screw 
to fasten a metal spade to a terminal. A bar-
rier strip often acts as the receiver of the spade 
lugs.

Phono connectors are often referred to as RCA

Crimp
Crimp connectors are color- coded according to 
the wire size they can accommodate. They are 
useful as quick, friction- type connections in 
dc applications where connections are broken

These are often referred to as UHF plugs. They 
are used with RG- 59/U coaxial cable. Such con-

BNC
BNC connectors are used with coaxial cables. 
Unlike the F- type plug, BNC connectors use 
a twist- on bayonet- like locking mechanism. 
This feature allows for quick connections
T- Connector
T- connectors consist of two plug ends and one 
central jack end. They are used when a connec-
tion must be made somewhere along a coaxial 
cable.
DIN Connector
These connectors are used with multiple con-
ductor wires. They are often used for intercon-
necting audio and computer accessories.
Meat Hook
These connectors are used as test probes. The 
spring- loaded hook opens and closes with the 
push of a button. The hook can be clamped 
onto wires and component leads.
D- Connector
D-connectors are used with ribbon cable. Each 
connector may have as many as 50 contacts. 
The connection of each individual wire to each 
individual plug pin or jack socket is made by 
sliding the wire in a hollow metal collar at the 
backside of each connector. The wire is then 
soldered into place.

are also widely used.

3.1.5  High- Frequency Effects Within Wires and Cables
Weird Behavior in Wires (Skin Effect)
When dealing with low-current dc hobby projects, wires and cables are straight-
forward—they act as simple conductors with essentially zero resistance. However, 
when you replace dc currents with very high-frequency ac currents, weird things 
begin to take place within wires. As you will see, these “weird things” will not allow 
you to treat wires as perfect conductors.
First, let’s take a look at what is going on in a wire when a dc current is flowing 
through it.
A wire that is connected to a dc source will 
cause electrons to flow through the wire in a 
manner similar to the way water flows through 
a pipe. This means that the path of any one 
electron essentially can be anywhere within 
the volume of the wire (e.g., center, middle 
 radius, surface).
FIGURE 3.7
An ac voltage applied across a wire will cause 
electrons to vibrate back and forth. In the 
 vibrating process, the electrons will generate 
magnetic fields. By applying some physical 
principles (finding the forces on every electron 
that result from summing up the individual 
magnetic forces produced by each electron), 
you find that electrons are pushed toward 
the surface of the wire. As the frequency of 
the  applied signal increases, the electrons 
are pushed further away from the center and 
 toward the surface. In the process, the center 
region of the wire becomes devoid of conducting 
electrons.
FIGURE 3.8
Now, let’s take a look at what happens when a high- frequency ac current is sent 
through a wire.
The movement of electrons toward the surface of a wire under high- frequency 
conditions is called the skin effect. At low frequencies, the skin effect does not have a 
large effect on the conductivity (or resistance) of the wire. However, as the frequency  
increases, the resistance of the wire may become an influential factor. Table 3.2 
shows just how influential skin effect can be as the frequency of the signal increases 
(the table uses the ratio of ac resistance to dc resistance as a function of frequency).
One thing that can be done to reduce the resistance caused by skin effects is to 
use stranded wire—the combined surface area of all the individual wires within the 
conductor is greater than the surface area for a solid- core wire of the same diameter.

Weird Behavior in Cables (Lecture on Transmission Lines)
Like wires, cables also exhibit skin effects. In addition, cables exhibit inductive and 
capacitive effects that result from the existence of magnetic and electrical fields within 
the cable. A magnetic field produced by the current through one wire will induce a 
current in another. Likewise, if two wires within a cable have a net difference in charge 
between them, an electrical field will exist, thus giving rise to a capacitive effect.
Taking note of both inductive and capacitive effects, it is possible to treat a cable as 
if it were made from a number of small inductors and capacitors connected together. 
An equivalent inductor- capacitor network used to model a cable is shown in Fig. 3.10.
The impedance of a cable can be modeled  
by treating it as a network of inductors and 
capacitors.

264    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To simplify this circuit, we apply a reduction trick; we treat the line as an infinite 
ladder and then assume that adding one “rung” to the ladder (one inductor- capacitor 
section to the system) will not change the overall impedance Z of the cable. What this 
means—mathematically speaking—is we can set up an equation such that Z = Z + 
(LC section). This equation can then be solved for Z. After that, we find the limit as 
∆x goes to zero. The mathematical trick and the simplified circuit are shown below.
By convention, the impedance of a cable is called the characteristic impedance 
 (symbolized Z0). Notice that the characteristic impedance Z0 is a real number. This 
means that the line behaves like a resistor despite the fact that we assumed the cable 
had only inductance and capacitance built in.
The question remains, however, what are L and C? Well, figuring out what L and 
C should be depends on the particular geometry of the wires within a cable and on 
the type of dielectrics used to insulate the wires. You could find L and C by applying 
some physics principles, but instead, let’s cheat and look at the answers. The follow-
ing are the expressions for L and C and Z0 for both a coaxial and parallel- wire cable:

Impedance Matching
Since a transmission line has impedance built in, the natural question to ask is, How 
does the impedance affect signals that are relayed through a transmission line from one 
device to another? The answer to this question ultimately depends on the impedances 
of the devices to which the transmission line is attached. If the impedance of the trans-
mission line is not the same as the impedance of, say, a load connected to it, the signals 
propagating through the line will only be partially absorbed by the load. The rest of the 
signal will be reflected back in the direction it came from. Reflected signals are gener-
ally bad things in electronics. They represent an inefficient power transfer between two 
electrical devices. How do you get rid of the reflections? You apply a technique called 
impedance matching. The goal of impedance matching is to make the impedances of two 
devices—that are to be joined—equal. The impedance- matching techniques make use 
of special matching networks that are inserted between the devices.
Before looking at the specific methods used to match impedances, let’s first take a 
look at an analogy that should shed some light on why unmatched impedances  result 
in reflected signals and inefficient power transfers. In this analogy, pretend that the 
transmission line is a rope that has a density that is analogous to the transmission line’s 
characteristic impedance Z0. Pretend also that the load is a rope that has a density that 
is analogous to the load’s impedance ZL. The rest of the analogy is carried out below.
Unmatched Impedances (Z0 < ZL)
A low- impedance transmission line that is connected to a high- impedance load is 
analogous to a low- density rope connected to a high- density rope. In the rope analogy, 
if you impart a pulse at the left end of the low- density rope (analogous to sending an

electrical signal through a line to a load), the pulse will travel along without problems 
until it reaches the high- density rope (load). According to the laws of physics, when 
the wave reaches the high- density rope, it will do two things. First, it will induce a 
smaller- wavelength pulse within the high- density rope, and second, it will induce a 
similar- wavelength but inverted and diminished pulse that rebounds back toward the 
left end of the low- density rope. From the analogy, notice that only part of the signal 
energy from the low- density rope is transmitted to the high- density rope. From this 
analogy, you can infer that in the electrical case similar effects will occur—only now 
you are dealing with voltage and currents and transmission lines and loads.
Unmatched Impedances (Z0 > ZL)
A high- impedance transmission line that is connected to a low- impedance load 
is analogous to a high- density rope connected to a low- density rope. If you impart 
a pulse at the left end of the high- density rope (analogous to sending an electrical 
signal through a line to a load), the pulse will travel along the rope without prob-
lems until it reaches the low- density rope (load). At that time, the pulse will induce 
a longer- wavelength pulse within the low- density rope and will induce a similar- 
wavelength and diminished pulse that rebounds back toward the left end of the high- 
density rope. From this analogy, again you can see that only part of the signal energy 
from the high- density rope is transmitted to the low- density rope.
Matched Impedances (Z0 = ZL)
Connecting a transmission line and load of equal impedances together is analo-
gous to connecting two ropes of similar densities together. When you impart a pulse in 
the “transmission line” rope, the pulse will travel along without problems.  However, 
unlike the first two analogies, when the pulse meets the load rope, it will continue on

through the load rope. In the process, there will be no reflection, wavelength change, 
or amplitude change. From this analogy, you can infer that if the  impedance of a 
transmission line matches the impedance of the load, power transfer will be smooth 
and efficient.
Standing Waves
Let’s now consider what happens to an improperly matched line and load when 
the signal source is producing a continuous series of sine waves. You can, of course, 
expect reflections as before, but you also will notice that a superimposed standing- 
wave pattern is created within the line. The standing- wave pattern results from the 
interaction of forward- going and reflected signals. Figure 3.17 shows a typical resulting 
standing- wave pattern for an improperly matched transmission line attached between 
a sinusoidal transmitter and a load. The standing- wave pattern is graphed in terms of 
amplitude (expressed in terms of Vrms) versus position along the transmission line.
A term used to describe the standing- wave pattern is the voltage standing- wave 
ratio (VSWR). The VSWR is the ratio between the maximum and minimum rms volt-
ages along a transmission line and is expressed as
 
VSWR
V
V
=
rms,max
rms,min
The standing- wave pattern shown in Fig. 3.17 has VSWR of 4/1, or 4.
Assuming that the standing waves are due entirely to a mismatch between load 
impedance and characteristic impedance of the line, the VSWR is simply given by 
either

or
whichever produces a result that is greater than 1.
A VSWR equal to 1 means that the line is properly terminated, and there will be 
no reflected waves. However, if the VSWR is large, this means that the line is not 
properly terminated (e.g., a line with little or no impedance attached to either a short 
or open circuit), and hence there will be major reflections.

Techniques for Matching Impedances
This section looks at a few impedance- matching techniques. As a rule of thumb, with 
most low- frequency applications where the signal’s wavelength is much larger than 
the cable length, there is no need to match line impedances. Matching impedances 
is usually reserved for high- frequency applications. Moreover, most electrical equip-
ment, such as oscilloscopes, video equipment, etc., has input and output impedances 
that match the characteristic impedances of coaxial cables (typically 50 Ω). Other 
 devices, such as television antenna inputs, have characteristic input impedances that 
match the characteristic impedance of twin- lead cables (300 Ω). In such cases, the 
impedance matching is already taken care of.

IMPEDANCE- MATCHING NETWORK
A general method used to match impedances when both source and 
load impedances are practically purely resistive (very small amounts 
of reactance) is to use a resistive L pad network, as shown to the left. 
Either side of the L pad can be the source or load, but the Z1 side 
must be the side with higher impedance. The following equations 
are used to determine the L pad resistor values:

where Pload is the power dissipated by load and Ppad is the power dis-
sipated by the pad resistors. L pads are used in both audio and RF  
applications. For example, speaker L pads are designed to match the 
impedance of the speaker, and they are commonly available with 4, 8, 
16 Ω impedances. A special configuration of variable resistors can we 
used to control volume while maintaining constant load impedance on 
the output of an audio amplifier. Other resistor networks, such as T pads 
and Pi pads, are also used for matching impedances: Pi networks are  
employed in amplifiers and T networks used in transmatches. To get a 
more in- depth overview of all these resistive networks, try an internet 
search, using L, T, and Pi pads as your keywords.

to 1. You also could choose NP equal to 20 and NS equal to 2 and you 
would get the same result.

BROADBAND TRANSMISSION- LINE TRANSFORMER
A broadband transmission- line transformer is a simple device that 
consists of a few turns of miniature coaxial cable or twisted- pair 
cable wound about a ferrite core. Unlike conventional transformers, 
this  device can more readily handle high- frequency matching (its 
geometry eliminates capacitive and inductive resonance behavior). 
These devices can handle various impedance transformations and can 
do so with  incredibly good broadband performance (less than 1 dB 
loss from 0.1 to 500 MHz).

QUARTER- WAVE SECTION
A transmission line with characteristic impedance Z0 can be matched 
with a load with impedance ZL by inserting a wire segment that has a 
length equal to one quarter of the transmitted signal’s wavelength (λ/4) 
and which has an impedance equal to
Z
Z ZL

To calculate the segment’s length, you must use the formula λ = v/f, 
where v is the velocity of propagation of a signal along the cable and f is 
the frequency of the signal. To find v, use
/

v
c
k
where c = 3.0 × 108 m/s, and k is the dielectric constant of the cable’s 
insulation.
 For example, say you wish to match a 50- Ω cable that has a dielectric 
constant of 1 with a 200- Ω load. If you assume the signal’s frequency is 
100 MHz, the wavelength then becomes

STUBS
A short length of transmission line that is open ended or short- circuit 
terminated possesses the property of having an impedance that is 
 reactive. By properly choosing a segment of open- circuit or short -
circuit line and placing it in shunt with the original transmission 
line at an  appropriate position along the line, standing waves can be 
eliminated. The short segment of wire is referred to as a stub. Stubs 
are made from the same type of cable found in the transmission line. 
Figuring out the length of a stub and where it should be placed is 
fairly tricky. In practice, graphs and a few formulas are required. 
A detailed handbook on  electronics is the best place to learn more 
about using stubs.

3.2  Batteries
A battery is made up of a number of cells. Each cell contains a positive terminal, or

272    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When a load is placed across a cell’s terminals, a conductive bridge is formed 
that initiates chemical reactions within the cell. These reactions produce electrons 
in the anode material and remove electrons from the cathode material. As a result, a 
potential is created across the terminals of the cell, and electrons from the anode flow 
through the load (doing work in the process) and into the cathode.
A typical cell maintains about 1.5 V across its terminals and is capable of deliver-
ing a specific amount of current that depends on the size and chemical makeup of the 
cell. If more voltage or power is needed, a number of cells can be added together in 
either series or parallel configurations. By adding cells in series, a larger- voltage bat-
tery can be made, whereas adding cells in parallel results in a battery with a higher 
current- output capacity. Figure 3.25 shows a few cell arrangements.
Battery cells are made from a number of different chemical ingredients. The use 
of a particular set of ingredients has practical consequences on the battery’s overall 
performance. For example, some cells are designed to provide high open- circuit 
voltages, whereas others are designed to provide large current capacities. Certain 
kinds of cells are designed for light- current, intermittent applications, whereas 
others are designed for heavy- current, continuous- use applications. Some cells are 
designed for pulsing applications, where a large burst of current is needed for a 
short period of time. Some cells have good shelf lives; others have poor shelf lives. 
 Batteries that are designed for one- time use, such as carbon- zinc and alkaline bat-
teries, are called primary batteries. Batteries that can be recharged a number of times, 
such as nickel metal hydride and lead- acid batteries, are referred to as  secondary 
batteries.
3.2.1  How a Cell Works
A cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy by going through what are 
called oxidation- reduction reactions (reactions that involve the exchange of electrons).

FIGURE 3.24
FIGURE 3.25

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    273
The three fundamental ingredients of a cell used to initiate these reactions include 
two chemically dissimilar metals (positive and negative electrodes) and an electro-
lyte (typically a liquid or pastelike material that contains freely floating ions). The 
following is a little lecture on how a simple lead- acid battery works.
For a lead- acid cell, one of the electrodes is made from pure lead (Pb); the other 
electrode is made from lead oxide (PbO2); and the electrolyte is made from a sulfuric 
acid solution (H2O + H2SO4 → 3H+ + SO4
2− + OH−).
When the two chemically dissimilar electrodes are placed in the sulfuric 
acid solution, the electrodes react with the acid (SO4
−2, H+ ions), causing the 
pure lead electrode to slowly transform into PbSO4 crystals. During this trans-
formation reaction, two electrons are liberated within the lead electrode. Now, 
if you examine the lead oxide electrode, you also will see that it too is con-
verted into PbSO4 crystals. However, instead of releasing electrons during its 
transformation, it releases O2
−2 ions. These ions leak out into the electrolyte

solution and combine with the hydrogen ions to form H2O (water). By placing 
a load element, say, a lightbulb, across the electrodes, electrons will flow from 
the electron- abundant lead electrode, through the bulb’s filament, and into the 
electron- deficient lead oxide electrode.
As time passes, the ingredients for the chemical reactions run out (the battery 
is drained). To get energy back into the cell, a reverse voltage can be  applied 
across the cell’s terminals, thus forcing the reactions backward. In theory, a lead- 
acid battery can be drained and recharged indefinitely. However, over time, 
chunks of crystals will break off from the electrodes and fall to the bottom of 
the container, where they are not recoverable. Other problems arise from loss of 
electrolyte due to gasing during electrolysis (a result of overcharging) and due 
to evaporation.
3.2.2  Primary Batteries
Primary batteries are one- shot deals—once they are drained, it is all over. Common 
primary batteries include carbon- zinc batteries, alkaline batteries, mercury batteries, 
silver oxide batteries, zinc air batteries, and silver- zinc batteries. Here are some com-

3.2.3  Comparing Primary Batteries
Carbon- Zinc Batteries
Carbon- zinc batteries (“standard- duty”) are general- purpose primary- type batteries 
that were popular back in the 1970s, but have become obsolete with the advent of 
alkaline batteries. These batteries are not suitable for continuous use (only for inter-
mittent use) and are susceptible to leakage. The nominal voltage of a carbon- zinc cell 
is about 1.5 V, but this value gradually drops during service. Shelf life also tends to be 
poor, especially at elevated temperatures. The only really positive aspect of these bat-
teries is their low cost and wide size range. They are best suited to low- power appli-
cations with intermittent use, such as in radios, toys, and general- purpose low- cost 
devices. Don’t use these cells in expensive equipment or leave them in equipment for 
long periods of time—there is a good chance they will leak. Standby applications and 
applications that require a wide temperature range should also be avoided. In all, 
these batteries are to be avoided, if you can even find them.
Zinc- Chloride Batteries
Zinc- chloride batteries (“heavy- duty”) are a heavy- duty version of the carbon- zinc 
battery, designed to deliver more current and provide about 50 percent more capacity. 
Like the carbon- zinc battery, zinc- chloride batteries are essentially obsolete as com-
pared to alkaline batteries. The terminal voltage of a zinc- chloride cell is initially 
about 1.5 V, but drops as chemicals are consumed. Unlike carbon- zinc batteries, 
zinc- chloride batteries perform better at low temperatures, and slightly better at 
higher temperatures, too. The shelf life is also longer. They tend to have lower 
internal resistance and higher capacities than carbon- zinc, allowing higher currents 
to be drawn for longer periods. These batteries are suited to moderate, intermit-
tent use. However, an alkaline battery will provide better performance in similar 
 applications.
Alkaline Batteries
Alkaline batteries are the most common type of household battery you can buy—
they have practically replaced the carbon- zinc and zinc- chloride batteries. They 
are relatively powerful and inexpensive. The nominal voltage of an alkaline cell is 
again 1.5 V, but  doesn’t drop as much during discharge as the previous two bat-
tery types. The internal resistance is also considerably lower, and remains so until 
near the end of the battery’s life cycle. They have very long shelf lives and better 
high- and low- temperature performance, too. General- purpose alkaline batteries 
don’t work particularly well on high- drain devices like digital cameras, since the 
internal resistance limits output current flow. They will still work in your device, 
but the battery life will be greatly reduced. They are well suited to most general- 
purpose applications, such as toys, flashlights, portable audio equipment, digital 
cameras, and so on. Note that there is a rechargeable version of an alkaline battery, 
as well.
Lithium Batteries
Lithium batteries use a lithium anode, one of a number of different kinds of cathodes, 
and an organic electrolyte. They have a nominal voltage of 3.0 V—twice that of most 

276    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
other primary cells—that remains almost flat during the discharge cycle. They also 
have a very low self- discharge rate, giving them an excellent shelf life—as much as 
10 years. The internal resistance is also quite low, and remains so during discharge. 
It performs well in both low and high temperatures, and advanced versions of this 
battery are used on satellites, on space vehicles, and in military applications. They 
are ideal for low- drain applications such as smoke detectors, data- retention devices, 
pacemakers, watches, and calculators.
Lithium- Iron Disulfide Batteries
Unlike other lithium cells that have chemistries geared to obtaining the greatest 
 capacity in a given package, lithium- iron disulfide cells are a compromise. To match 
existing equipment and circuits, their chemistry has been tailored to the standard 
nominal 1.5- V output (whereas other lithium technologies produce double that). 
These cells are consequently sometimes termed voltage- compatible lithium batteries. 
Unlike other lithium technologies, lithium- iron disulfide cells are not rechargeable. 
Internally, the lithium- iron disulfide cell is a sandwich of a lithium anode, a sepa-
rator, and an iron disulfide cathode with an aluminum cathode collector. The cells 
are sealed but vented. Compared to the alkaline cells—with which they are meant 
to compete—lithium- iron disulfide cells are lighter (weighing about 66 percent of 
same- size alkaline cells) and higher in capacity, and they have a much longer shelf 
life—even after 10 years on the shelf, lithium disulfide cells still retain most of their 
capacity. Lithium iron- disulfide cells operate best under heavier loads. In high- 
current applications, they can supply power for a duration exceeding 260 percent 
of the time that a similar- sized alkaline cell can supply. This advantage diminishes 
at lower loads, however, and at very light loads may disappear or even reverse. 
For example, under a 20- mA load, a certain manufacturer rates its AA- size lithium- 
disulfide cells to provide power for about 122 hours while its alkaline cells will 
last for 135 hours. However, under a heavy load of 1 A, the lithium disulfide cell 
overshadows the alkaline counterpart by lasting 2.1 hours versus only 0.8 hours for 
the alkaline battery.
Mercury Cells
Zinc- mercuric oxide, or “mercury,” cells take advantage of the high electrode 
 potential of mercury to offer a very high energy density combined with a very flat 
discharge curve. Mercuric oxide forms the positive electrode, sometimes mixed with 
manganese dioxide. The nominal terminal voltage of a mercury cell is 1.35 V, and 
this remains almost constant over the life of the cell. They have an internal resistance 
that is fairly constant. Although made only in small button sizes, mercury cells are 
capable of reasonably high- pulsed discharge current and are thus suitable for appli-
cations such as quartz analog watches and hearing aids as well as voltage references 
in instruments, and the like.
Silver Oxide Batteries
The silver oxide battery is the predominate miniature battery found on the  market 
today. Silver oxide cells are made only in small button sizes of modest capacity 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    277
but have good pulsed discharge capability. They are typically used in watches, 
calculators, hearing aids, and electronic instruments. This battery’s general char-
acteristics include higher voltage than comparable mercury batteries, flatter dis-
charge curve than alkaline batteries, good low- temperature performance, good 
 resistance to shock and vibration, essentially constant internal resistance, excellent 
service maintenance, and long shelf life—exceeding 90 percent charge after storage 
for five years. The nominal terminal voltage of a silver oxide cell is slightly over 
1.5 V and remains almost flat over the life of the cell. Batteries built from cells 
range from 1.5 V to 6.0 V and come in a variety of sizes. Silver oxide hearing aid 
batteries are designed to produce greater volumetric energy density at higher dis-
charge rates than silver oxide watch or photographic batteries. Silver oxide photo 
batteries are designed to provide constant voltage or periodic high- drain pulses 
with or without a low drain background current. Silver oxide watch batteries, using 
a sodium  hydroxide (NaOH) electrolyte system are designed primarily for low- 
drain continuous use over long periods of time—typically five years. Silver oxide 
watch batteries using potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte systems are designed 
primarily for continuous low drains with periodic high- drain pulse demands, over 
a period of about two years.
Zinc Air Batteries
Zinc air cells offer very high energy density and a flat discharge curve, but have 
relatively short working lives. The negative electrode is formed of powdered zinc, 
mixed with the potassium hydroxide electrolyte to form a paste. This is retained 
inside a small metal can by a separator membrane that is porous to ions, and on 
the other side of the membrane is simply air to provide the oxygen (which acts 
as the positive electrode). The air/oxygen is inside an outer can of nickel- plated 
steel that also forms the cell’s positive connection, lined with another membrane 
to distribute the oxygen over the largest area. Actually there is no oxygen or air in 
the zinc- oxygen cell when it’s made. Instead, the outer can has a small entry hole 
with a covering seal, which is removed to admit air and activate the cell. The zinc 
is consumed as the cell supplies energy, which is typically for around 60 days. The 
nominal terminal voltage of a zinc- oxygen cell is 1.45 V, and the discharge curve 
is relatively flat. The internal resistance is only moderately low, and they are not 
suitable for heavy or pulsed discharging. They are found mainly in button and pill 
packages, and are commonly used in hearing aids and pagers. Miniature zinc air 
batteries are designed primarily to provide power to hearing aids. In most hear-
ing aid applications, zinc air batteries can be  directly substituted for silver oxide 
or mercuric oxide batteries and will typically give the longest hearing aid service 
of any common battery system. Notable characteristics include high capacity- to- 
volume ratio for a miniature battery, more stable voltage at high currents when 
compared to mercury or silver oxide batteries, and essentially constant internal 
resistance. They are activated by removing the covering (adhesive tab) from the air 
access hole, and they are most effective in applications that consume battery capacity 
in a few weeks.

3.2.4  Secondary Batteries
Secondary batteries, unlike primary batteries, are rechargeable by nature. The actual 
discharge characteristics for secondary batteries are similar to those of primary batteries, 
but in terms of design, secondary batteries are made for long- term, high- power- level 
discharges, whereas primary batteries are designed for short discharges at low power 
levels. Most secondary batteries come in packages similar to those of primary batteries, 
with the exception of, say, lead- acid batteries and special- purpose batteries. Secondary 
batteries are used to power such devices as laptop computers, portable power tools, 
electric vehicles, emergency lighting systems, and engine starting systems.
Here are some common packages for secondary batteries:
Comparing Secondary (Rechargeable) Batteries
LEAD- ACID BATTERIES
Lead- acid batteries are typically used for high- power applications, such as motor-
ized vehicle power and battery backup applications. There are basically three types 
of lead- acid batteries: flooded lead- acid, valve- regulated lead- acid (VRLA), and 
FIGURE 3.29

FIGURE 3.28

280    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
sealed lead- acid (SLA). The flooded types must be stood upright and tend to lose 
electrolytes while producing gas over time. The SLA and VRLA are designed for a 
low overvoltage potential to prohibit the battery from reaching its gas- generating 
potential during discharge. However, SLA and VRLA can never be charged to their 
full potential. VRLA is generally used for stationary applications, while the SLA can 
be used in various positions. Lead- acid batteries typically come in 2- V, 4- V, 6- V, 8- V, 
and 12- V versions, with capacities ranging from 1 to several thousand amp- hours. 
The flooded lead- acid battery is used in automobiles, forklifts, wheelchairs, and UPS 
devices.
An SLA battery uses a gel- type electrolyte rather than a liquid to allow it to be 
used in any position. However, to prevent gas generation, it must be operated at 
a lower potential—meaning it’s never fully charged. This means that it has a rela-
tively poor energy density—the lowest for all sealed secondary batteries. However, 
they’re the cheapest secondary, making them best suited for applications where 
low- cost, stationary power storage is the main concern. SLA batteries have the lowest 
self- discharge rate of any of the secondary batteries (about 5 percent per month). 
They do not suffer from memory effect (as displayed in NiCad batteries), and they 
perform well with shallow cycling; in fact, they tend to prefer it to deep cycling, 
although they perform well with intermittent heavy current demands, too. SLA 
batteries aren’t designed for fast charging—typically 8 to 16 hours for full recharge. 
They must also always be stored in a charged state. Leaving them in a discharged 
state can lead to sulfation, a condition that makes the batteries difficult, if not 
impossible, to recharge. Also, SLA batteries have an environmentally unfriendly 
 electrolyte.
The basic technique for recharging lead- acid batteries, be they flooded, sealed, or 
valve- regulated, is to read the technical directions that come with them. If you don’t 
know what you’re doing—say, trying to make your own battery recharger—you may 
run into a serious problem, such as blowing up batteries with too much pressure, 
melting them, or destroying the chemistry. (The procedure for charging lead- acid 
batteries is different from that for NiCad and NiMH batteries in that voltage limiting 
is used instead of current limiting.)
NICKEL- CADMIUM (NiCAD) BATTERIES
Nickel- cadmium batteries are made using nickel hydroxide as the positive elec-
trode and cadmium hydroxide as the negative electrode, with potassium hydroxide 
as the electrolyte. Nickel- cadmium batteries have been a very popular recharge-
able battery over the years; however, with the introduction of NiMH batteries, they 
have seen a decline in use. In practical terms, NiCad batteries don’t last very long 
before needing a recharge. They put out less voltage (per cell) than a standard 
alkaline (1.2 V versus 1.5 V for alkaline). This means that applications that require 
four or more alkaline batteries might not work at all with comparable- sized NiCad 
batteries. During discharge, the average voltage of a sealed NiCad cell is about 1.2 V per 
cell. At nominal discharge rates, the characteristic is very nearly flat until the cell 
approaches full discharge. The battery provides most of its energy above 1.0 V per 
cell. The self- discharge rate of a NiCad is not great, either—around two to three 
months. However, like SLAs, sealed NiCads can be used in virtually any position. 
NiCads have a higher energy density than SLAs (about twice as much), and with 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    281
a relatively low cost, they are popular for powering compact portable equipment: 
cordless power tools, model boats and cars, and appliances such as flashlights and 
vacuum cleaners. NiCads suffer from memory effect and are therefore not really 
suitable for applications that involve shallow cycling or spending most of their 
time on a float charger. They perform best in situations where they’re deeply  cycled. 
They have a high number of charge/discharge cycles—around 1000.
Use a recommended charger—a constant current–type charger with due regard 
for heat dissipation and wattage rating. Improper charging can cause heat damage or 
even high- pressure rupture. Observe proper charging polarity. The safe charge rate 
for sealed NiCad cells for extended charge periods is 10 hours, or C/10 rate.
NICKEL METAL HYDRIDE (NiMH) BATTERIES
NiMH batteries are very popular secondary batteries, replacing NiCad batteries in 
many applications. NiMH batteries use a nickel/nickel hydroxide positive electrode, 
a hydrogen- storage alloy (such as lanthanum- nickel or zirconium- nickel) as a nega-
tive electrode, and potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte. They have a higher energy 
density than standard NiCad batteries (about 30 to 40 percent higher) and don’t require 
special disposal requirements, either. The nominal voltage of a NiMH battery is 1.2 V 
per cell, which must be taken into consideration when substituting them into devices 
that use standard 1.5- V cells such as alkaline cells. They self- discharge in about two to 
three months and do display some memory effect, but not as bad as NiCad batteries. 
They are not as happy with a deep discharge cycle as a NiCad battery, and they tend to 
have a shorter work life. Best results are achieved with load currents of 0.2- C to 0.5- C 
(one- fifth to one- half of the rated capacity). Typical applications include remote-control 
vehicles and power tools (although NiMH batteries are rapidly being superceded by 
Li-ion and LiPo batteries).
Recharging NiMH batteries is a bit complex due to significant heat generation; 
the charge uses a special algorithm that requires trickle charging and temperature 
 sensing. Unlike NiCad batteries, NiMH batteries have little memory effect. The 
 batteries require regular full discharge to prevent crystalline formation.
Li- ION BATTERIES
Lithium is the lightest of all metals and has the highest electrochemical potential, 
giving it the possibility of an extremely high energy density. However, the metal 
itself is highly reactive. While this isn’t a problem with primary cells, it poses an 
explosion risk with rechargeable batteries. For these to be made safe, lithium- ion 
technology had to be developed; the technology uses lithium ions from chemicals 
such as lithium- cobalt dioxide, instead of the metal itself. Typical Li- ion batteries 
have a negative electrode of aluminum coated with a lithium compound such as 
lithium- cobalt dioxide, lithium- nickel dioxide, or lithium- manganese dioxide. The 
positive electrode is generally of copper, coated with carbon (generally either graph-
ite or coke), while the electrolyte is a lithium salt such as lithium- phosphorous hexa-
fluoride, dissolved in an organic solvent such as a mixture of ethylene carbonate 
and dimethyl carbonate. Li- ion batteries have roughly twice the energy density of 
NiCads, making them the most compact rechargeable yet in terms of energy stor-
age. Unlike NiCad or NiMH batteries, they are not subject to memory effect, and 
have a relatively low self- discharge rate—about 6 percent per month, less than half 

282    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
that of NiCads. They are also capable of moderately deep discharging, although 
not as deep as NiCads, as they have a higher internal resistance. On the other hand, 
Li- ion batteries cannot be charged as rapidly as NiCads, and they cannot be trickle 
or float charged, either. They also are significantly more costly than either NiCads 
or NiMH batteries, making them the most expensive rechargeables of all. Part of 
this is that they must be provided with built- in protection against both excessive 
discharging and overcharging (both of which pose a safety risk). Most Li- ion bat-
teries are therefore supplied in self- contained battery packs, complete with “smart” 
protective circuitry. They are subject to aging, even if not used, and have moderate 
discharge currents. The main applications for Li- ion batteries are in places where as 
much energy as possible needs to be stored in the smallest possible space, and with 
as little weight as possible. They are found in laptop computers, PDAs, camcorders, 
and cell phones.
Li- ion batteries require special voltage- limiting recharging devices. Commercial 
Li- ion battery packs contain a protection circuit that prevents the cell voltage from 
going too high while charging. The typical safety threshold is set to 4.30 V/cell. 
In addition, temperature sensing disconnects the charging device if the internal tem-
perature approaches 90°C (194°F). Most cells feature a mechanical pressure switch 
that permanently interrupts the current path if a safe pressure threshold is exceeded. 
The charge time of all Li- ion batteries, when charged at a 1- C initial current, is about 
three hours. The battery remains cool during charge. Full charge is attained after the 
voltage has reached the upper voltage threshold and the current has dropped and 
leveled off at about 3 percent of the nominal charge current. Increasing the charge 
current on a Li- ion charger does not shorten the charge time by much. Although the 
voltage peak is reached more quickly with higher current, the topping charge will 
take longer.
LITHIUM POLYMER (Li- POLYMER) BATTERIES
The lithium polymer batteries are a lower- cost version of the Li- ion batteries. Their 
chemistry is similar to that of the Li- ion in terms of energy density, but uses a dry 
solid polymer electrolyte only. This electrolyte resembles a plastic- like film that does 
not conduct electricity but allows an exchange of ions (electrically charged atoms or 
groups of atoms). The dry polymer is more cost effective during fabrication, and the 
overall design is rugged, safe, and thin. With a cell thickness measuring as little 
as 1 mm, it is possible to use this battery in thin compact devices where space is an 
issue. It is possible to create designs which form part of a protective housing, are in 
the shape of a mat that can be rolled up, or are even embedded into a carrying case 
or piece of  clothing. Such innovative batteries are still a few years away, especially 
for the  commercial market.
Unfortunately, the dry Li- polymer suffers from poor ion conductivity, due to 
high internal resistance; it cannot deliver the current bursts needed for modern com-
munication devices. However, it tends to increase in conductivity as the temperature 
rises, a characteristic suitable for hot climates. To make a small Li- polymer battery 
more conductive, some gelled electrolyte may be added. Most of the commercial   
Li- polymer batteries used today for mobile phones are hybrids and contain gelled 
electrolytes.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    283
The charge process of a Li- polymer battery is similar to that of the Li- ion battery. 
The typical charge time is around one to three hours. Li- polymer batteries with gelled 
electrolyte, on the other hand, are almost identical to Li- ion batteries. In fact, the same 
charge algorithm can be applied.
NICKEL- ZINC (NiZn) BATTERIES
Nickel- zinc batteries are commonly used in light electric vehicles. They are con-
sidered the next generation of batteries used for high- drain applications, and are 
 expected to replace sealed lead- acid batteries due to their higher energy densities 
(up to 70 percent lighter for the same power). They are also relatively cheap com-
pared to NiCad batteries.
NiZn batteries are chemically very similar to NiCad batteries; both use an alka-
line electrolyte and a nickel electrode, but they differ significantly in their voltage. 
The NiZn cell delivers more than 0.4 V of additional voltage both at open circuit and 
 under load. With the additional 0.4 V per cell, multicell batteries can be constructed 
in smaller packages. For example, a 19.2- V pack can replace a 14.4- V NiCad pack, 
representing a 25 percent lower cell space and delivering higher power and a 45 per-
cent lower impedance. They are also less expensive than most rechargeables. They 
are safe (abuse- tolerant). The life cycle is a bit better than for NiCad batteries for 
typical applications. They have superior shelf life when compared to lead- acid. Also, 
they are considered environmentally green—both nickel and zinc are nontoxic and 
easily recycled.
In terms of recharge times, it takes less than two hours to achieve full recharge; 
there is an 80 percent charge in one hour. This feature makes them useful in cordless 
power tools. Their high energy density and high discharge rate make them suitable 
for applications that demand large amounts of power in small, lightweight packages. 
They are found in cordless power tools, UPS systems, electric scooters, high- intensity 
dc lighting and the like.
NICKEL- IRON (NiFe) BATTERIES
Nickel- iron batteries, also called nickel alkaline or NiFe batteries, were introduced in 
1900 by Thomas Edison. These are very robust batteries that are tolerant of abuse and 
can have very long life spans (30 years or more). The open- circuit voltage of these 
cells is 1.4 V, and the discharge voltage is about 1.2 V. They withstand overcharge and 
over- discharge. They accept high depth of discharge (deep cycling) and can remain 
discharged for long periods without damage, unlike lead- acid batteries that need 
to be stored in a charged state. They are, however, very heavy and bulky. Also, the 
low reactivity of the active components limits high- discharge performance. The cells 
take a charge slowly, give it up slowly, and have a steep voltage dropoff with state 
of charge. Furthermore, they have a low energy density compared to other second-
ary batteries, and a high self- discharge rate. NiFe batteries are used in applications 
similar to those for lead- acid batteries, but oriented toward a necessity of longevity. 
(A typical lead- acid battery will last around five years, compared to around 30 to 80 
years for a NiFe battery.)

RECHARGEABLE ALKALINE- MANGANESE (RAM) BATTERIES
Rechargeable alkaline- manganese, or RAM, batteries are the rechargeable version of 
primary alkaline batteries. Like the primary technology, they use a manganese diox-
ide positive electrolyte and potassium hydroxide electrode, but the negative electrode 
is now a special porous zinc gel designed to absorb hydrogen during the charging 
process. The separator is also laminated to prevent it being pierced by zinc dendrites. 
These are often considered a poor substitute for a rechargeable, as compared to a 
NiCad or NiMH battery. RAM batteries have a tendency to plummet in capacity 
over few recharge cycles. It is feasible for a RAM battery to lose 50 percent of its 
capacity after only eight cycles. On the positive side, they are inexpensive and read-
ily available. They can usually be used as a direct replacement for non-rechargeable 
batteries, but they usually have a lower nominal voltage, making them unsuitable  
for some devices, but not in high- drain devices like digital cameras. They have a low 
self- discharge rate and can be stored on standby for up to 10 years. Also, they are 
environmentally friendly (no toxic metals are used) and maintenance- free; there is 
no need for cycling or worrying about memory effect. On the short side, they have 
limited current- handling capability and are limited to light- duty applications such 
as flashlights and other low- cost portable electronic devices that require shallow 
 cycling. Recharging a RAM battery requires a special recharger; if you charge them 
in a standard charger, they may explode.
THE SUPERCAPACITOR
The supercapacitor isn’t really a battery but a cross between a capacitor and a battery. 
It resembles a regular capacitor, but uses special electrodes and some electrolytes. 
There are three kinds of electrode material found in a supercapacitor: high- surface- 
area- activated carbons, metal oxide, and conducting polymers. The one using high- 
surface- area- activated carbons is the most economical to manufacture. This system 
is also called double layer capacitor (DLC) because the energy is stored in the double 
FIGURE 3.30

286    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
layer formed near the carbon electrode surface. The electrolyte may be aqueous or 
organic. The aqueous electrolyte offers low internal resistance but limits the voltage 
to 1 V. In contrast, the organic electrolyte allows 2 and 3 V of charge, but the internal 
resistance is higher.
To make the supercapacitor practical for use in electronic circuits, higher voltages 
are needed. Connecting the cells in series accomplishes this task. If more than three 
or four capacitors are connected in series, voltage balancing must be used to prevent 
any cell from reaching overvoltage.
Supercapacitors have values from 0.22 F upwards to several F. They have higher 
energy storage capacity than electrolytic capacitors, but a lower capacity than a 
battery (approximately 1⁄10 that of a NiMH battery). Unlike electrochemical batter-
ies that deliver a fairly steady voltage, the voltage of a supercapacitor drops from 
full voltage to zero volts without the customary flat voltage curve characteristic 
of most batteries. For this reason, supercapacitors are unable to deliver the full 
charge. The percentage of charge that is available depends on the voltage require-
ments of the applications. For example, a 6- V battery is allowed to discharge to 
4.5 V before the equipment cuts off; the supercapacitor reaches that threshold with 
the first quarter of the discharge. The remaining energy slips into an unusable 
voltage range.
The self- discharge of the supercapacitor is substantially higher than that of 
the electrochemical battery. Typically, the voltage of the supercapacitor with an 
organic electrolyte drops from full charge to the 30 percent level in as little as 
10 hours. Other supercapacitors can retain the charged energy longer. With these 
designs, the capacity drops from full charge to 85 percent in 10 days. In 30 days, 
the voltage drops to roughly 65 percent, and to 40 percent after 60 days.
The most common supercapacitor applications are memory backup and standby 
power for real-time clock ICs. Only in special applications can the supercapacitor 
be used as a direct replacement for a chemical battery. Often the supercapacitor is 
used in tandem with a battery (placed across its terminals, with a provision in place 
to limit high influx of current when equipment is turned on) to improve the current 
handling of the battery: during low load current the battery charges the superca-
pacitor; the stored energy of the supercapacitor kicks in when a high load current 
is requested. In this way the supercapacitor acts to filter and smooth pulsed load 
currents. This enhances the battery’s performance, prolongs the runtime, and even 
extends the longevity of the battery.
Limitations include an inability to use the full energy spectrum—depending on 
the application, not all energy is available. A supercapacitor has low energy density, 
typically holding 1⁄5 to 1⁄10 the energy of an electrochemical battery. Cells have low 
voltages—serial connections are needed to obtain higher voltages. Voltage balanc-
ing is required if more than three capacitors are connected in series. Furthermore, 
the self- discharge is considerably higher than that of an electrochemical battery.
Advantages include a virtually unlimited life cycle—supercapacitors are not sub-
ject to the wear and aging experienced by electrochemical batteries. Also, low imped-
ance can enhance pulsed current demands on a battery when placed in parallel with 
the battery. Supercapacitors experience rapid charging—with low- impedance ver-
sions reaching full charge within seconds. The charge method is simple—the voltage- 
limiting circuit compensates for self- discharge.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    287
FIGURE 3.31
3.2.5  Battery Capacity
Batteries are given a capacity rating that indicates how much electrical energy they 
are capable of delivering over a period of time. The capacity rating is specified in 
terms of ampere- hours (Ah) and millampere- hours (mAh). Knowing the battery 
 capacity, it is possible to estimate how long the battery will last before being considered 
dead. The following example illustrates this.

288    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Example: A battery with a capacity of 1800 mAh is to be used in a device that draws 
120 mA continuously. Ignoring possible loss in capacity as a result of load current 
magnitude, how long should the battery be able to deliver power?
Answer: Ideally, this would be:
 
t =
=
1800
120
15
 
 
mAh
mA
h
Note: In reality, you must consult the battery manufacturer’s data sheets and analyze 
their discharge graphs (voltage as a function of time and of load current) to get an 
accurate determination of actual discharge time. As the load current increases, there 
is an apparent loss in battery capacity caused by internal resistance.
Typical capacity ratings for AAA, AA, C, D, and 9- V NiMH batteries are 1000 mAh 
(AAA), 2300 mAh (AA), 5000 mAh (C), 8500 mAh (D), 250 mAh (9).
C Rating
The charge and discharge currents of a battery are measured in capacity rating or 
C rating. The capacity represents the efficiency of a battery to store energy and its 
ability to transfer this energy to a load. Most portable batteries, with the exception of 
lead- acid, are rated at 1 C. A discharge rate of 1 C draws a current equal to the rated 
capacity that takes one hour (h). For example, a battery rated at 1000 mAh provides 
1000 mA for 1 hour if discharged at 1 C rate. The same battery at 0.5 C provides 
500 mA for 2 hours. At 2 C, the same battery delivers 2000 mA for 30 minutes. 1 C is 
often referred to as a 1- hour discharge; 0.5 C would be 2 hours, and 0.1C would be a 
10- hour discharge. The discrepancy in C rates between different batteries is largely 
dependent on the internal resistance.
Example: Determine the discharge time and average current output of a battery with 
a capacity rating of 1000 mAh if it is discharged at 1 C. How long would it take to 
discharge at 5 C, 2 C, 0.5 C, 0.2 C, and 0.05 C?
Answer: At 1 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 1000 mA (rated capacity/
hour), so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/1 C = 1 h
At 5 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 5000 mA (five times rated capacity/
hour), so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/5 C = 0.2 h
At 2 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 2000 mA (two times rated capacity/
hour), so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/2 C = 0.5 h
At 0.5 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 500 mA (half the rated capacity/
hour), so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/0.5 C = 2 h

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    289
At 0.2 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 200 mA (20 percent rated capacity/
hour) so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/0.2 C = 5 h
At 0.05 C, the battery is attached to a load drawing 50 mA (5 percent rated capacity/
hour) so the discharge time is:
 
t = 1 hC/C rating = 1 hC/0.05 C = 20 h
Again, note that these values are estimates. When load currents increase (especially 
when C values get large), the capacity level drops below nominal values—due to 
nonideal internal characteristics such as internal resistance—and must be determined 
using manufacturer’s discharge curves and Peurkert’s equation. Do a search of the 
Internet, using “Peurkert’s equation” as a keyword, to learn more.
3.2.6  Note on Internal Voltage Drop of a Battery
Batteries have an internal resistance that is a result of the imperfect conducting ele-
ments that make up the battery (resistance in electrodes and electrolytes). Though the 
internal resistance may appear low (around 0.1 Ω for an AA alkaline battery, or 1 to  
2 Ω for a 9- V alkaline battery), it can cause a noticeable drop in output voltage if a 
low- resistance (high- current) load is attached to it. Without a load, we can measure 
the open- circuit voltage of a battery, as shown in Fig. 3.32a. This voltage is essentially 
equal to the battery’s rated nominal voltage—the voltmeter has such a high input 
resistance that it draws practically no current, so there is no appreciable voltage drop. 
However, if we attach a load to the battery, as shown in Fig. 3.32, the output termi-
nal voltage of the battery drops. By treating the internal resistance Rin and the load 
resistance Rload as a voltage divider, you can calculate the true output voltage present 
across the load—see the equation in Fig. 3.32b.
Batteries with large internal resistances show poor performance in supplying 
high current pulses. (Consult the battery comparison section and tables to determine 
which batteries are best suited for high- current, high- pulse applications.) Internal 
FIGURE 3.32

290    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
resistance also increases as the battery discharges. For example, a typical alkaline 
AA battery may start out with an internal resistance of 0.15 Ω when fresh, but may 
 increase to 0.75 Ω when 90 percent discharged. The following list shows typical 
 internal resistance for various batteries found in catalogs. The values listed should not 
be assumed to be universal—you must check the specs for your particular batteries.

Here a green LED is used to indicate that the battery is okay. This 
stays on all the time to indicate that the battery is live, and the red LED 
comes on when the battery voltage falls below the set threshold. A green 
LED has around 2.0 V across it when it is illuminated. This value varies 
a bit with different manufacturers, but is pretty well matched within 
any batch. Add the base emitter voltage, and you need 2.6 V on the base 
of the right transistor (i.e., across the R3 ) to turn on the transistor. 2.6 V  
across R3  needs 9.1 across the supply rail. Below this threshold voltage, 
the transistor is off and the red LED is on. Above this voltage, the red 
LED is off. By adjusting the values of the three resistors, you can alter 
the threshold level. We’ll discuss transistors and LEDs later on in this 
book.
3.3  Switches
A switch is a mechanical device that interrupts or diverts electric current flow within 
a circuit.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    291
3.3.1  How a Switch Works
Two slider- type switches are shown in Fig. 3.35. The switch in Fig. 3.35a acts as an 
interrupter, whereas the switch in Fig. 3.35b acts as a diverter.
Other kinds of switches, such as push- button switches, rocker switches, magnetic- 
reed switches, etc., work a bit differently than slider switches. For example, a  
magnetic- reed switch uses two thin pieces of leaflike metal contacts that can be forced 
together by a magnetic field. This switch, as well as a number of other unique switches, 
will be discussed later on in this section.
(a) When the lever is pushed to the right, the 
metal strip bridges the gap between the two 
contacts of the switch, thus allowing current to 
flow. When the lever is pushed to the left, the 
bridge is broken, and current will not flow.
(b) When the lever is pushed upward, a conduc-
tive bridge is made between contacts a and b. 
When the lever is pushed downward, the con-
ductive bridge is relocated to a position where 
current can flow between contact a and c.
FIGURE 3.35
3.3.2  Describing a Switch
A switch is characterized by its number of poles and by its number of throws. A pole 
represents, say, contact a in Fig. 3.35b. A throw, on the other hand, represents the 
particular contact- to- contact connection, say, the connection between contact a and 
contact b or the connection between contact a and contact c in Fig. 3.35b. In terms of 
describing a switch, the following format is used: (number of poles) “P“ and (number 
of throws) “T.“ The letter P symbolizes “pole,” and the letter T symbolizes “throw.” 
When specifying the number of poles and the number of throws, a convention must 
be followed: When the number of poles or number of throws equals 1, the letter S, 
which stands for “single,” is used. When the number of poles or number of throws 
equals 2, the letter D, which stands for “double,” is used. When the number of poles 
or number of throws exceeds 2, integers such as 3, 4, or 5 are used. Here are a few 
examples: SPST, SPDT, DPST, DPDT, DP3T, and 3P6T. The switch shown in Fig. 3.35a 
represents a single- pole single- throw switch (SPST), whereas the switch in Fig. 3.35b 
represents a single- pole double- throw switch (SPDT).
Two important features to note about switches include whether a switch 
has  momentary contact action and whether the switch has a center- off position. 
Momentary- contact switches, which include mainly pushbutton switches, are used 
when it is necessary to only briefly open or close a connection. Momentary- contact 
switches come in either normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) forms. A nor-
mally closed pushbutton switch acts as a closed circuit (passes current) when left 
 untouched. A normally open pushbutton switch acts as an open circuit (broken cir-
cuit) when left untouched. Center- off position switches, which are seen in diverter 
switches, have an additional “off” position located between the two “on” positions. 
It is important to note that not all switches have center- off or momentary- contact 
 features—these features must be specified.

Magnetic Reed Switch
A reed switch consists of two closely spaced leaflike contacts that are 
enclosed in an air- tight container. When a magnetic field is brought 
nearby, the two contacts will come together (if it is a normally open reed 
switch) or will push apart (if it is a normally closed reed switch).
Binary- Coded Switches
These switches are used to encode digital information. A mechanism 
inside the switch will “make” or “break” connections between the switch 
pairs  according to the position of the dial on the face of the switch. These 
sitches come in either true binary/hexadecimal and complementary binary/
hexa-decimal forms. The charts below show how these switches work:

DIP Switch
DIP stands for “dual- inline package.” The geometry of this switch’s 
pin- outs allows the switch to be placed in IC sockets that can be wired 
directly into a circuit board. 
Mercury Tilt- Over
This type of switch is used as a level- sensing 
switch. In a normally closed mercury tilt- over 
switch, the switch is “on” when oriented ver-
tically (the liquid mercury will make contact 
with both switch contacts). However, when the 
switch is tilted, the mercury will be displaced, 
hence breaking the conductive path.

Here’s a simple home security alarm that’s triggered into action (buzzer 
and light go on) when one of the normally open switches is closed. 
Magnetic reed switches work particularly well in such applications.

are more common than the toxic and expensive 
mercury.

hold wiring applications.

Current- Flow Reversal
A DPDT switch, shown here, can be used to reverse the direction of 
current flow. When the switch is thrown up, current will flow throw 
the left light- emitting diode (LED). When the switch is thrown down, 
current will flow throw the right LED. (LEDs only allow current to flow 
in one direction.)
Multiple Selection Control of a Voltage- Sensitive Device via a Two- Wire Line
Say you want to control a remote device by 
means of a two- wire line. Let’s also assume 
that the remote device has seven different 
 operational settings. One way of controlling 
the device would be to design the device in 
such a way that if an individual resistor with-
in the device circuit were to be altered, a new 
function would be enacted. The resistor may 
be part of a voltage divider, may be attached in 
some way to a series of window comparators 
(see op amps), or may have an analog-to-digital 
converter interface. After figuring out what val-
ued resistor enacts each new function, choose 
the appropriate valued resistors and place them 
 together with a rotary switch. Controlling the 
remote device becomes a simple matter of turn-
ing the rotary switch to select the appropriate 
resistor.
3.4  Relays
Relays are electrically actuated switches. The three basic kinds of relays include 
 mechanical relays, reed relays, and solid- state relays. For a typical mechanical relay, 
a current sent through a coil magnet acts to pull a flexible, spring- loaded conduc-
tive plate from one switch contact to another. Reed relays consist of a pair of reeds 
(thin, flexible metal strips) that spring together whenever a current is sent through 
an encapsulating wire coil. A solid- state relay is a device that can be made to switch 
states by applying external voltages across n- type and p- type semiconductive junc-
tions (see Chap. 4). In general, mechanical relays are designed for high currents 
(typically 2 to 15 A) and relatively slow switching (typically 10 to 100 ms). Reed 
relays are designed for moderate currents (typically 500 mA to 1 A) and moderately 
fast switching (0.2 to 2 ms). Solid- state relays, on the other hand, come with a wide 
range of current ratings (a few microamps for low- powered packages up to 100 A 
for high- power packages) and have extremely fast switching speeds (typically 1 to 
100 ns). Some limitations of both reed relays and solid- state relays include limited 
switching arrangements (type of switch section) and a tendency to become damaged 
by surges in power.

296    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
A mechanical relay’s switch section comes in many of the standard manual switch 
arrangements (e.g., SPST, SPDT, DPDT, etc.). Reed relays and solid- state  relays,  unlike 
mechanical relays, typically are limited to SPST switching. Some of the  common 
 symbols used to represent relays are shown below.
The voltage used to activate a given relay may be either dc or ac. For, example, 
when an ac current is fed through a mechanical relay with an ac coil, the flexible- 
metal conductive plate is pulled toward one switch contact and is held in place as 
long as the current is applied, regardless of the alternating current. If a dc coil is sup-
plied by an alternating current, its metal plate will flip back and forth as the polarity 
of the applied current changes.
Mechanical relays also come with a latching feature that gives them a kind of 
memory. When one control pulse is applied to a latching relay, its switch closes. Even 
when the control pulse is removed, the switch remains in the closed state. To open the 
switch, a separate control pulse must be applied.

Subminiature Relays
Typical mechanical relays are designed for switching rela-
tively large currents. They come with either dc or ac coils. 
Dc- actuated relays typically come with excitation- voltage rat-
ings of 6, 12, and 24 V dc, with coil resistances (coil ohms) of 
about 40, 160, and 650 Ω, respectively.  AC- actuated relays typi-
cally come with excitation- voltage ratings of 110 and 240 V ac, 
with coil resistances of about 3400 and 13600 Ω, respectively. 
Switching speeds range from about 10 to 100 ms, and current 
ratings range from about 2 to 15 A.
Miniature Relays
Miniature relays are similar to subminiature relays, but they 
are  designed for greater sensitivity and lower- level currents. 
They are almost exclusively actuated by dc voltages but may 
be designed to switch ac currents. They come with excitation 
voltages of 5, 6, 9, and 12, and 24 V dc, with coil resistances 
from 50 to 3000 Ω.
Reed Relays
Two thin metal strips, or reeds, act as movable contacts. The reeds 
are placed in a glass- encapsulated container that is surrounded 
by a coil magnet. When current is sent through the outer coil, the 
reeds are forced together, thus closing the switch. The low mass 
of the reeds  allows for quick switching, typically around 0.2 to 
2 ms. These relays come with dry or sometimes mercury-wetted 
contacts. They are dc- actuated and are designed to switch lower- 
level currents, and come with excitation voltages of 5, 6, 12, and 
24 V dc, with coil resistances around 250 to 2000 Ω. Leads are 
made for PCB mounting.
Solid- State Relays
Solid-State Relays or SSRs are sealed modules designed to be 
used in the same way as electromechanical relays, but switching 
using opto-isolators and power transistors or Triacs. As such they 
are not really basic components, but modules.
They are usually divided in two varieties, AC and DC. An AC 
device usually uses an opto-isolator with zero-switching detec-
tor and a Triac to switch the load as the voltage is close to 0 V 
in the cycle, but a DC device uses a MOSFET or IGBT transistor 
(see Chap. 4) to switch the load.
Using an opto-isolator has the dual advantage of only requiring 
a couple of mA to switch the relay on, but also isolates the con-
trol side of the relay from the switching side.

3.4.2  A Few Notes about Relays
To make a relay change states, the voltage across the leads of its magnetic coil should 
be at least within ±25 percent of the relay’s specified control- voltage rating. Too 
much voltage may damage or destroy the magnetic coil, whereas too little voltage 
may not be enough to “trip” the relay or may cause the relay to act erratically (flip 
back and forth).
The coil of a relay acts as an inductor. Now, inductors do not like sudden 
changes in current. If the flow of current through a coil is suddenly interrupted, 
say, a switch is opened, the coil will respond by producing a sudden, very large 
voltage across its leads, causing a large surge of current through it. Physically 
speaking, this phenomenon is a result of a collapsing magnetic field within the 
coil as the current is terminated abruptly. [Mathematically, this can be under-
stood by noticing how a large change in current (dI/dt) affects the voltage across 
a coil (V = LdI/dt).] Surges in current that result from inductive behavior can cre-
ate menacing voltage spikes (as high as 1000 V) that can have some nasty effects 
on neighboring devices within the circuit (e.g., switches may get zapped, transis-
tors may get zapped, individuals touching switches may get zapped, etc.). Not 
only are these spikes damaging to neighboring devices, they are also damaging 
to the relay’s switch contacts (contacts will suffer a “hard hit” from the flexible- 
metal conductive plate when a spike occurs in the coil).
The trick to getting rid of spikes is to use what are called transient suppressors. 
You can buy these devices in prepackaged form, or you can make them yourself. 
The following are a few simple, homemade transient suppressors that can be used 
with relay coils or any other kind of coil (e.g., transformer coils). Notably, the switch 
incorporated within the networks below is only one of a number of devices that may 
interrupt the current flow through a coil. In fact, a circuit may not contain a switch at 
all but may contain other devices (e.g., transistors, thyristors, etc.) that may have the 
same current- interrupting effect.
FIGURE 3.45
Placing a diode in reverse bias across a relay’s coil eliminates voltage 
spikes by going into conduction before a large voltage can form across 
the coil. The diode must have a peak current capability able to handle 
currents equivalent to the maximum current that would have been flow-
ing through the coil before the current supply was interrupted. A good 
general- purpose diode that works well for just such applications is the 
1N4004 diode.
DC-Driven Coil
When dealing with ac- actuated relays, using a diode to eliminate voltage 
spikes will not work—the diode will conduct on alternate half- cycles. 
 Using two diodes in reverse parallel will not work either—the current 
will never make it to the coil. Instead, an RC series network placed across 
the coil can be used. The capacitor absorbs excessive charge, and the 
resistor helps control the discharge. For small loads driven from the 
power line, setting R = 100 Ω and C = 0.05 µF works fine for most cases. 
(Note: There are special devices, such as bidirectional TVs, MOVs, and 
MTLVs, that are designed for dc transients. See Sec. 4.5.)

3.5  Resistors
There are various kinds of resistors available today. There are fixed resistors, vari-
able resistors, digitally adjustable resistors, fusible resistors, photoresistors, and vari-
ous resistor arrays (networks). Figure 3.47 shows schematic symbols and pictures of 
some of the most common types.
DC- Actuated Switch
Here, a dc- powered SPDT relay is used to 
 relay current to one of two light bulbs. When 
the switch in the control circuit is opened, the 
relay coil receives no current; hence the relay 
is relaxed, and current is routed to the upper 
bulb. When the switch in the control circuit is 
closed, the relay coil receives current and pulls 
the flexible- metal conductive plate downward, 
thus routing current to the lower bulb. The 
 diode acts as a transient suppressor. Note that 
all components must be selected according to 
current and voltage ratings.

AC- Actuated Switch
Here, an ac- actuated relay is used to switch 
ac current to one of two ac- rated light bulbs. 
The behavior in this circuit is essentially the 
same as in the preceding circuit. However, cur-
rents and voltages are all ac, and an RC net-
work is used as a transient suppressor. Make 
sure that resistor and capacitor are rated for a 
potential transient current that is as large as 
the typical coil current. The capacitor must be 
rated for ac line voltage. A discrete transient 
suppressor (e.g., bipolar TVs or MOV) can 
take the place of an RC network.

Relay Driver
If a relay is to be driven by an arbitrary con-
trol voltage, this circuit can be used. The npn 
bipolar transistor acts as a current- flow control 
valve. With no voltage or input current applied 
to the transistor’s base lead, the transistor’s 
collector- to- emitter channel is closed, hence 
blocking current flow through the relay’s coil. 
However, if a sufficiently large voltage and 
input current are applied to transistor’s base 
lead, the transistor’s collector- to- emitter chan-
nel opens, allowing current to flow through 
the relay’s coil.

300    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Resistors perform two basic functions in electronics: to limit current flow and to 
set voltage levels within a circuit. Figure 3.48a shows a resistor being used to reduce 
current flow to an LED. Without the resistor, the LED would receive excess current 
capable of melting its sensitive p- n junction. A variation of the LED circuit is shown 
with a variable resistor in series with the current- limiting resistor. The variable resis-
tor (or potentiometer, or pot) provides additional current limiting with the desired 
effect of controlling the brightness of the LED.
Figure 3.48b demonstrates how two resistors are used to create a voltage divider  
 capable of providing a dc voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage. In this  example, 
a voltage of 12 V is reduced to a voltage of 5 V—a usable logic HIGH level for a 
microcontroller’s input. A photoresistor replacing one of the voltage divider resis-
tors acts as a variable resistor whose resistance decreases with light intensity. When 
this resistance decreases, the voltage present at the microcontroller’s input increases, 
eventually reaching a logic HIGH level. Once a logic HIGH is set up, it is then up to 
the microcontroller’s program to determine what course of action to take next.
The key features of current limiting and voltage setting are implemented in vari-
ous ways in electronics. Resistors are used to set operating current and signal levels 
in circuits, provide voltage reduction, set precise gain values in precision circuits, act 
as shunts in ammeters and voltage meters, behave like damping agents in oscillators 
and timer circuits, act as bus and line terminators in digital circuits, provide feedback 
FIGURE 3.47
FIGURE 3.48

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    301
networks for amplifiers, and act as pullup and pulldown elements in digital circuits. 
They are also used in attenuators and bridge circuits. Special kinds of resistors are 
even used as fuses.
3.5.1  Resistance and Ohm’s Law
From Chap. 2, we learned that if a dc voltage is applied across a resistor, the amount 
of current that will flow through the resistor can be found using Ohm’s law—simply 
rearrange the equation (I = V/R). To find the power dissipated as heat by the resistor, 
apply the second equation below. By plugging Ohm’s law into the power equation, 
you also get P = I 2 × R and P = V 2/R, which come in handy, too.
 
V = I × R (Ohm’s law)
 
P = I × V (Power law)
R is the resistance, or the resistor, expressed in ohms (Ω), P is the power loss in watts 
(W), V has the voltage in volts (V), and I is the current in amperes (A).
Resistance values are given in kiloohms (kΩ) or megaohms (MΩ), where k repre-
sents 1000 and M represents 1,000,000. So a 3.3- kΩ resistor is equal to 3300 Ω, while 
a 2M resistor is equal to 2,000,000 Ω. Voltage, current, and power are often expressed 
in millivolts (mV), milliamps (mA), and milliwatts (mW), where m is equal to 0.001.  
1 mV = 0.001 V; 200 mA = 0.2 A, 33 mW = 0.033 W.
As an example, in Fig. 3.49, the amount of current through a 100- Ω resistor 
 attached to a 12- V battery is I = 12 V/100 Ω = 0.120 A or 120 mA. The power loss due 
to heating becomes P = 0.120 A × 12 V = 1.44 W.
Determining the power loss is very important when designing circuits. All real 
resistors have maximum allowable power ratings that must not be exceeded. If you 
exceed the power rating you’ll probably end up frying your resistor, destroying the 
internal structure, and thus altering the resistance. Typical general- purpose resistors 
come in 1⁄8- , 1⁄4- , 1⁄2- and 1- W power ratings, while high- power resistors can range from 
2 to several hundred watts.
So, going back to our example circuit in Fig. 3.49, the power rating of the resistor 
must be greater than the calculated dissipated power of 1.44 W. In reality, the power 
rating should be greater than this for safety. As a rule of thumb, always select a  resistor 
FIGURE 3.49

302    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
that has a power rating at least twice the maximum value anticipated. Though a 
2- W resistor would work in our example, a 3- W resistor would be safer. Other fac-
tors, such as ambient temperature, enclosures, resistor groupings, pulsed opera-
tion, and additional air cooling will increase or decrease the required power rating 
of a resistor—see the section on real resistor characteristics for more information.
3.5.2  Resistors in Series and Parallel
Rarely do you see circuits that use a single resistor alone. Usually, resistors are found 
connected in a variety of ways. The two fundamental ways of connecting resistors are 
in series and in parallel.
Resistors in Parallel
When two or more resistors are placed in parallel, the voltage across each resistor is 
the same, but the current through each resistor will vary with resistance. Also, the 
total resistance of the combination will be lower than that of the lowest resistance 
value present. The formula for finding the total resistance of resistors in parallel is:

The dots in the equation indicate that any number of resistors can be combined. For 
only two resistances in parallel (a very common case), the formula reduces to the 
equation above.

An important thing to note after applying these equations is that the current enter-
ing the top junction of the resistors in parallel equals the sum of the current entering 
the resistors (Iin = I1 + I2). This statement is referred to as Kirchhoff’s current law. With 
this law, and Ohm’s law, you come up with the current divider equation, shown to the 
right in Fig. 3.50. This equation comes in handy when you know the input current but 
not the input voltage.
To find how much power resistors in parallel dissipate, apply the power law, as 
shown in Fig. 3.49.
Resistors in Series
When a circuit has a number of resistors connected in series, the total resistance of the 
circuit is the sum of the individual resistances. Also, the amount of current flowing 
through each resistor in series is the same, while the voltage across each resistor var-
ies with resistance. The formula for finding the total resistance of resistors in series is:
 
Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + … (Resistors in series)
The dots indicate that as many resistors as necessary may be added.
Example: If a 1.0- kΩ resistor is placed in series with a 2.0- kΩ resistor, what is the total 
resistance?
 
Rtotal = R1 + R2 = 1000 Ω + 2000 Ω = 3000 Ω = 3 kΩ
If we attach the two resistors to an input voltage Vin = 9 V, the total current flow, 
which will be the same as the individual current flow through each resistor, is:

To find the voltage drop across each resistor, apply Ohm’s law:
 
V1 = I1 × R1 = 0.003 A × 1000 Ω = 3 V
 
V2 = I2 × R2 = 0.003 A × 2000 Ω = 6 V
FIGURE 3.51

304    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You can use this approach to find the voltage drop across any number of resistors in 
series. Also, notice that the voltage drop across each resistor is directly proportional 
to the resistance. The 2000- Ω resistor value is twice as large as the 1000- Ω resistor and 
the voltage drop across the 2000- Ω resistor is twice as large.
An important thing to notice with the voltage drops is that they all add up to the 
supply voltage Vin. If you start at the positive terminal of the battery (+9 V) and subtract 
the 3- V drop across R1 and then subtract the 6- V drop across R2, you end up with zero: 
+9 V − 3 V − 6 V = 0 V. Another way to put it is to say that the sum of the voltage changes 
around a closed path is zero. The resistors are power sinks, while the battery is a power 
source. It is common to assign a + sign to power sources and a − sign to power sinks. 
This means the voltages across the resistors have the opposite sign from the battery 
voltage. Adding all the voltages yields zero. This is called Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Now, if there are only two resistors in series, you can avoid calculating currents and 
simply apply the following handy equations, referred to as the voltage divider equations:

A voltmeter reading from ground to the middle of the two resistors, which we’ll call 
the output voltage Vout, will read 6 V, since you’re really just measuring the voltage 
drop across R2.
3.5.3  Reading Resistor Labels
Axial lead resistors, such as carbon composition, carbon film, and metal film, use 
color bands to indicate resistance values. The most common labeling scheme uses 
four bands: the first band represents the first digit, the second band the second digit, 
the third band the multiplier (as an exponent of 10), and the fourth band the tolerance 
(if there is no fourth band, the tolerance is 20 percent). The table in Fig. 3.52 indicates 
the meaning of each color in regard to number, multiplier, and tolerance.
On precision resistors, you’ll find five bands: the first three bands are used as 
significant figures, the fourth band is the multiplier, while a space between the fourth 
and fifth band that is wider than the others is used to identify the fifth tolerance band.
Another five- band labeling scheme that is typically reserved for military- spec 
 resistors has a fifth band reserved for reliability level. The reliability band tells you 
the percentage change in resistance over a time interval (e.g., 1000 hours, brown = 
1 percent, red = 0.1 percent, orange = 0.01 percent, yellow = 0.001 percent).
Surface- mount resistors use either a three- digit or a four- digit label. In the three- 
digit scheme, the first two digits represent significant figures, and the last digit is 
the multiplier. For values less than 100 Ω, the letter “R” is substituted for one of the 
significant digits and represents a decimal point (e.g., 1R0 = 1.0 Ω).
When tolerance levels become important (e.g., narrower than around ±2 percent), 
an extra digit letter is placed at the end of the previous three- digit code to indicate 
tolerance (e.g., F = ±1). See examples in Fig. 3.52.
Precision surface- mount resistors with a four- digit code use the first three digits 
as significant figures, while using the last digit as the multiplier. Again, the letter “R” 
is used as a decimal point—see the examples in Fig. 3.52.

NOTE OF CAUTION (RESISTOR BODY COLOR)
Resistor body color usually  doesn’t carry significant meaning. It sometimes 
represents the resistor’s temperature coefficient, but this is seldom of great 
 importance in most hobby- type work. However, a note of caution: there are 
two resistor body colors that you should be aware of if you go tinkering around 
inside consumer electronics equipment. Resistor body colors white and blue are 
used to mark nonflammable resistors and fusible resistors. If you encounter this 
type of resistor in a circuit, do not replace it with a normal resistor. Doing so 
may cause a fire hazard if something goes wrong in the circuit. Nonflammable 
resistors and fusible resistors are designed so that they don’t catch fire when 
they overheat. When fusible resistors overheat, they cut the current flowing like 
a fuse. We’ll discuss these resistors in greater detail later in this chapter.

3.5.4  Real Resistor Characteristics
There are a number of things to consider when selecting a resistor for a given applica-
tion. Two primary considerations include selecting the appropriate nominal resistance 
and power rating. The next step is to develop an acceptable tolerance for the resistor that 
ensures it will function properly in all extremes of the application. This task can be a bit 
difficult because it requires understanding a variety of nonideal characteristics that vary 
from one resistor family (or even between resistors in the same family) to another.
There are many different kinds of resistors out there, each with its specific set of 
limitations and suitable applications. A resistor that is good for one application can be 
disastrous in another. Resistors designated as “precision” resistors (such as precision 
metal film) are designed for applications where tight resistance tolerance and stability 
are primary considerations. They generally have restricted operating temperature 
limits and power dissipation ratings. “Power” resistors (such as power wirewounds) 
tend to be designed to optimize power dissipation at the expense of precision, and 
generally have extended operating temperature limits. “General- purpose” resistors 
(such as carbon film) tend to be somewhere in between, and are suitable for most 
general applications.
The following is a rundown of the important specifications used when selecting 
resistors. You can find detailed specifications for real resistors by checking out the 
manufacturers’ data sheets (e.g., www.vishay.com).
Voltage Rating
This is the maximum value of dc or RMS voltage that can be imposed across a  resistor 
at specified ambient temperatures. The voltage rating is related to the power rat-
ing by V

, where V is the voltage rating (in volts), P is the power rating (in 
watts), and R is the resistance (in ohms). For a given value of voltage and power 
 rating, a critical value of resistance can be calculated. For values of resistance below 
the critical value, the maximum voltage is never reached; for values of resistance

ing how a real resistor will behave. Model (a) represents an ideal resistor, while model (b) represents a temperature variable 
model for noninductive resistors. Model (c) takes into consideration the inherent inductive and capacitive elements within 
a resistor’s construction. For UHF and microwave designs, model (c) could be used with L representing lead inductances.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    307
above the critical value, the power dissipated is lower than the rated power. One- 
half- watt and some 1- W resistors usually are rated only to 250 to 350 V. For high- 
voltage applications (e.g., a high- voltage amplifier), you may have to resort to, say,  
1 W (continuous, 1000- V surge) or 2 W, 750- V- rated resistors.
Tolerance
This is expressed as the deviation (in percent) in resistance from the nominal  value, 
measured at 25°C with no load applied. Typical resistor tolerances are 1 percent  
2 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 20 percent. Precision resistors, such as precision 
wirewounds, are made with tolerances as tight as ±0.005 percent. To understand 
what tolerance means, consider a 100- Ω resistor with 10 percent tolerance. The speci-
fied tolerance means that the resistor’s resistance could actually be anywhere  
between 90 and 110 Ω. On the other hand, a 100- Ω resistor with 1 percent tolerance 
has a possible resistance range from 99 to 101 Ω.
Carbon- composition resistors, as a whole, have the worst tolerance, around 5 to 
20 percent. Carbon- film resistors are about 1 to 5 percent, metal- film about 1 percent, 
and precision metal- film resistors as low as 0.1 percent. Most wirewound resistors are 
from 1 to 5 percent, while precision wirewounds can achieve ±0.005 percent toler-
ance. Foil resistors, a relatively new technology, can achieve 0.0005 percent. For most 
general- purpose applications, a resistor with a 5 percent tolerance is adequate.
Power Rating
Resistors must be operated within specified temperature limits to avoid permanent 
damage to the materials. The temperature limit is defined in terms of the maximum 
power, called the power rating, and a derating curve that is provided by the resistor 
manufacturers (see Fig. 3.54). The power rating of a resistor is the maximum power in 
watts that the resistor can safely dissipate as heat, usually specified at +25°C.  Beyond 
+25°C, the derating curve, which plots the maximum allowable power versus the am-
bient temperature, is used. The derating curve is usually linearly drawn from the full- 
rated load temperature to the maximum allowable no- load temperature. A resistor 
FIGURE 3.54

308    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
may be operated at ambient temperatures above the maximum full- load ambient tem-
perature if operating at lower than full- rated power capacity. The maximum allowable 
no- load temperature is also the maximum storage temperature for the resistor.
In regard to resistor life, any change in temperature of 30 to 40°C is tolerated—the 
resistor will return to its normal resistance when the temperature returns to its nomi-
nal value. However, if the resistor gets too hot to touch, you may end up permanently 
damaging it. For this reason, it’s important to be conservative when specifying the 
power rating of a resistor.
Standard power ratings for resistors include: 1⁄16, 1⁄10, 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 
100, 200, 250, and 300 W. To determine the power rating for a particular application, 
use P = IV (P = I 2R or P = V 2/R), then, as a rule of thumb, select a resistor that has 
a power rating two to four times greater than the calculated value. Note, however, 
that there are many factors that go into selecting the power rating of a resistor. For 
more accurate design applications, you may have to weigh in other factors, such as 
whether resistors are grouped or enclosed within a box, whether they are fan cooled, 
or whether they are pulsed. In that case, you can use the chart in Fig. 3.55 to calculate 
an approximate power rating.
A kit of 1/4- , 1/2- and 1- W carbon- film and metal- film resistors is usually suffi-
cient for most applications. A selection of 1- to 5- W wirewound resistors often comes 
in handy, and in rare instances you may have to resort to 10-  to 600- W aluminum- 
housed wirewound or thick- film power resistors.
Note that in some applications (e.g., input stages to amplifiers), an effect called 
contact noise can be reduced by increasing the power rating (size) of the resistor—see 
the section on noise later in this chapter.
Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR or TC)
This tells you the amount of resistance change that occurs when the temperature of 
a resistor changes. TC values are typically expressed as parts per million (ppm) for 
each degree centigrade change from some nominal temperature—usually room tem-
perature (25°C).
So a resistor with a TC of 100 ppm will change 0.1 percent in resistance over a 
10°C change, and will change 1 percent over a 100°C change (provided the tempera-
ture change is within the resistor’s rated temperature range, e.g., −55 to +145°C, mea-
sured at 25°C room temperature). A positive TC means an increase in resistance with 
increasing temperature, while a negative TC indicates a decreasing resistance with an 
increase in temperature.
Here’s another example: A 1000- Ω resistor with a TC of +200 ppm/°C is heated 
from 27°C to 50°C. The change in resistance in parts per million is:
 
(200 ppm/°C) × (50°C − 27°C) = 4600 ppm
meaning the new resistance is:
 
1000 Ω × (1 + 4600 ppm/1,000,000 ppm) = 1004.6 Ω
There are a wide range of TC values available from ±1 ppm/°C to ±6700 
ppm/°C.

310    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Specifying TC is important in applications where the change in resistance with 
temperature changes must be small. Equally important may be applications where 
a specific TC is required (e.g., temperature compensation circuits). Typically, there 
are two contributors to temperature- related resistance changes: increased tem-
perature due to dissipated power and ambient temperature variations. The exact 
correspondence between dissipation, ambient temperature, and the TC is not a lin-
ear function, but rather resembles a bell- shaped or S- shaped curve. Therefore, for 
serious high- precision applications, you’ll have to check out the manufacturer’s 
resistor data sheets.
When designing circuits, you have to ask yourself which instances require high 
stability and low TC. For example, using a carbon- composition resistor in a stable, 
high- precision circuit is asking for trouble due to its high TC and weak tolerance. 
Using a more stable metal- film resistor with a TC of 50 to 100 ppm/°C will improve 
accuracy and stability considerably. Precision- film resistors have greatly improved 
accuracy and TCs—20, 10, 5, or 2 ppm/°C and accuracies as good as 0.01 percent. 
Carbon- film resistors have much higher TCs than metal- film resistors—around 500 
to 800 ppm/°C. It’s easy to mistakenly insert a drifty carbon- film resistor for the 
 intended metal- film type. Carbon- film resistors are also unique among the major 
 resistor families, since they alone have a negative temperature coefficient. They are 
often used to offset the thermal effects of the other components.
As a note: often, matching TCs for pairs or sets of resistors is more important than 
the actual TC itself. In these cases, matched sets are available that ensure that the 
resistance values of the set track in the same magnitude and direction as operating 
temperature changes.
Frequency Response
Resistors are not perfect—they have inherent inductive and capacitive features that 
can alter the device’s impedance, especially as the applied ac voltage frequency 
 increases. (Figure 3.56 shows a frequency model of a resistor.) For this reason, it’s 
possible for a resistor to perform like an R/C circuit, a filter, or an inductor. The pri-
mary cause of these inductive and capacitive effects results from imperfect interior 
layout of the resistive element as well as the resistor’s leads. In spiraled and wire-
wound  resistors, these inductive and capacitive reactances are created by the loops 
and spaces formed by the spirals or turns of wire. In pulse applications, these reac-
tive distortions result in a poor replication of the input. It is probable that a 20- ns 
pulse will be completely missed by a wirewound resistor, while a foil resistor, due 
to its superior design, achieves full replication in the time allotted. As the frequency 
increases, inductive reactance becomes more prevalent.
Even though the definition of the useful frequency range of a resistor is applica-
tion dependent, typically the useful range of the resistor is the highest frequency at 
which the impedance differs from the resistance by more than the tolerance of the resis-
tor. Typical reactive values for these special designs are less than 1 µH for a 500- Ω 
resistor, and less than 0.8- pF capacitance for a 1- MΩ resistor. A typical fast- rise- time 
resistor has a rise time of 20 ns or less. (Rise time is an associated parameter relating 
the resistor’s response to a step or pulse input.)
Wirewound resistors are notorious for their poor frequency response due to their 
internal coil windings. In composition resistors, frequency response also  suffers from 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    311
the capacitances that are formed by the many conducting particles that are held in 
contact by the dielectric binder. The most stable resistors for high- frequency opera-
tions are film resistors. The impedance for film resistors remains constant until around 
100 MHz and then decreases at higher frequencies. In general, a resistor with a smaller 
diameter will have better frequency response. Most high- frequency resistors have a 
length- to- diameter ratio between 4:1 and 10:1. Manufacturers often supply data sheets 
that show the frequency response of their resistors. Impedance  analyzers can also aid 
in modeling a resistor’s frequency response.
Noise
Resistors exhibit electrical noise in the form of small ac voltage fluctuations when 
dc voltage is applied. Noise is extremely difficult to measure accurately and  doesn’t 
affect the value of the resistor but can have a devastating effect on low- level signals, 
digital amplifiers, high- gain amplifiers, and other applications. Noise in a resistor is 
a function of the applied voltage, physical dimensions, and materials. The total noise 
is a sum of Johnson noise, current- flow noise, noise due to cracked bodies, loose end 
caps, and leads. For variable resistors, noise can also be caused by the brief jumping 
motion of the wiper as it moves along the resistive element (e.g., wire turns).
There are three main types of resistor noise: thermal, contact, and shot noise. 
Thermal noise is dependent mainly on temperature, bandwidth, and resistance, 
while shot noise is dependent on bandwidth and average dc current. Contact noise 
is dependent upon average dc current, bandwidth, material geometry, and type. The 
following is a brief summary of the various kinds of resistor noise.
Johnson noise is temperature- dependent thermal noise. Thermal noise is also called 
“white noise” because the noise level is the same at all frequencies. The magnitude of 
thermal noise, Vrms, is dependent on the resistance value and the temperature of the 
resistance due to thermal agitation:
 
V
kRT f
RMS =
4
∆
FIGURE 3.56

312    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
where Vrms is the root- mean- square value of the noise voltage (in volts), K is 
Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K), R is the resistance (in ohms), T is the tem-
perature (in Kelvin), and ∆f is the bandwidth (in hertz) over which the noise energy 
is measured. For resistors, the thermal noise is equivalent for equal valued resistors, 
regardless of material type (carbon, metal film, etc.). The only way to reduce thermal 
noise is to reduce the resistance value. This is why you try to avoid using a 10- MΩ 
resistor on the input stages of amplifiers.
Current noise varies inversely with frequency and is a function of the current flow-
ing through the resistor and the value of the resistor—see Fig. 3.56. The magnitude of 
the current noise is directly proportional to the square root of the current. The current 
noise magnitude is usually expressed by a noise index given as the ratio of the root- 
mean- square current noise voltage (Vrms) over one decade bandwidth to the average 
voltage caused by a specified constant current passed through the resistor at a speci-
fied hot- spot temperature.

where NI is the noise index, Vdc is the dc voltage drop across the resistor, and f1 and 
f2 represent the frequency range over which the noise is being computed. Units of 
noise index are µV/V. At higher frequencies the current noise becomes less dominant 
compared to Johnson noise.
Contact noise is directly proportional to a constant that depends on resistor 
material/size and upon the average dc current. In amplifiers, for example, using 
a  larger 2- W carbon- composition resistor will improve performance over that 
of a 1⁄2- W equivalent under the same conditions. The predominant noise in carbon 
composition, carbon film, metal oxide and metal film is composed of contact noise, 
which can be very large at low frequencies due to a 1/f frequency characteristic. 
Wirewound resistors do not have this noise—only resistors made of carbon particles. 
If no current (ac or dc) flows in the resistor, the noise is equal to the thermal noise. 
The contact noise increases as the current is increased. This means that for low- noise 
operation, the dc or ac current should be kept low. The material and geometry of 
a resistor greatly affects the contact noise, and therefore doubles the power rating 
of the resistor, which increases the size and area, and will reduce the contact noise 
generated by the resistor.
Shot noise is dependent upon current—the more average dc current through a 
resistor, the more noise you get. To reduce this type of noise, dc current levels must 
be kept low. This is often put into action in the first amplifier stage or in low- level 
stages such as reverb- recover amps in audio, where it is the most critical. It’s best to 
use a wirewound or metal- film resistor in these applications, unless you are making 
a high- frequency amp where inductance of the wirewound resistor comes into play.
The best resistors for low- noise applications are precision resistors. Precision 
wirewounds tend to be the quietest, having only thermal noise (unless terminations 
are faulty), but they aren’t readily available in large resistance values and are usu-
ally  inductive. Precision film resistors also have extremely low noise—you’ll have to 
consult the manufacturers’ websites to see how noise- free modern film resistors have 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    313
become. Next down the line comes metal oxide, followed by carbon film, and, last, 
carbon composition. Composition resistors show some degree of noise due to internal 
electrical contacts between conducting particles held together with the binder. And 
remember that, when designing critical circuits, you’ll cut down on contact noise 
(not applicable to wirewounds) by using the resistor with the largest practical wattage.
Don’t forget potentiometers, which are most commonly carbon composition. 
They generally have large values (e.g., 1 MΩ for volume control), which make them 
major sources of noise in an amplifier. For absolute lowest noise, conductive plastic 
element pots should be used, employing the lowest practical value and largest practi-
cal power rating.
Voltage Coefficient of Resistance
Resistance is not always independent of the applied voltage. The voltage coefficient 
of resistance is the change in resistance per unit change in voltage, expressed as a 
percentage of the resistance at 10 percent of rated voltage. The voltage coefficient is 
given by the relationship:

where R1 is the resistance at the rated voltage V1 and R2 is the resistance at 10 percent 
of rated voltage V2. Voltage coefficient is associated with carbon- composition and 
carbon- film resistors, and is a function of the resistor’s value and its composition.
Stability
This is defined as the repeatability of resistance of a resistor when measured at a refer-
ence temperature and subjected to a variety of operating and environmental conditions 
over time. Stability is difficult to specify and measure, since it is application dependent. 
Generally, wirewound and bulk- metal resistor designs are best, while designs using 
composition resistors are least stable. For highest resistance stability, it’s best to operate 
critical resistors with limited temperature rise and limited load level. Changes in tem-
perature alternately apply and relieve stresses on the resistive element, thus causing 
change in resistance. The wider these temperature variations and the more rapid these 
changes are, the greater the change in resistance. If severe enough, this can literally 
 destroy a resistor. Humidity can also alter the resistance by causing the insulation of the 
resistor to swell, thus applying pressure to the resistive element.
Reliability
This is the degree of probability that a resistor will perform its desired function. It is 
typically rated as mean time between failures (MTBF) or failure rate per 1,000 hours 
of operation. Reliability isn’t usually a critical specification for most general- purpose 
applications. It often does pop up in critical applications, such as those used by the 
military.
Temperature Rating
This is the maximum allowable temperature at which the resistor may be used. Often, 
two temperatures are used—one for full loads up to, say, +85°C derated to no load 
at +145°C. Temperature range may be specified, for example, from −55°C to +275°C.

314    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
3.5.5  Types of Resistors
There are numerous resistor technologies out there, with new technologies springing 
up all the time. The major technologies include carbon film, metal film, thick film, 
thin film, carbon composition, wirewound, and metal oxide. When selecting resistors 
for an application, you generally specify whether the resistor is to be a precision resis-
tor, semiprecision resistor, general- purpose resistor, or power resistor.
Precision resistors have low voltage and power coefficients and excellent tempera-
ture and time stabilities, along with low noise and very low reactance. These resis-
tors are available in metal- film or wire constructions and are typically designed for 
circuits having very close resistance tolerances on values.
Semiprecision resistors are smaller than precision resistors and are used primarily 
for current- limiting or voltage- dropping functions. They have long- term tempera-
ture stability.
General- purpose resistors are used in circuits that do not require tight resistance tol-
erances or long- term stability. For general- purpose resistors, initial resistance varia-
tions may be in the neighborhood of 5 percent, and the variation in resistance under 
full- rated power may approach 20 percent. Typically, general- purpose resistors have 
a high coefficient of resistance and high noise levels. However, good-quality metal 
film resistors are low cost and often used as general-purpose resistors.
Power resistors are used for power supplies, control circuits, and voltage dividers 
where operational stability of 5 percent is acceptable. Power resistors are available in 
wirewound and film construction. Film- type power resistors have the advantage of 
stability at high frequencies and have higher resistance values than wirewound resis-
tors for a given size.
The following provides finer details highlighting the differences between the var-
ious available resistors.
Precision Wirewound
Precision wirewound resistors are very stable resistors manufactured with high toler-
ances. They are made by winding wire of nickel- chromium alloy onto a ceramic tube 
covered with a vitreous coating. They are designed to have a very low temperature 
coefficient of resistance (as low as 3 ppm/°C) and can achieve accuracies up to 0.005 
percent. They are usually expected to operate in a temperature range from -55 to 200°C, 
with a maximum operating temperature of 145°C. Life is generally rated at 10,000 
hours at rated temperature and load, though this can increase if operated below rated 
temperature. The allowable change in resistance under these conditions is about 0.10 
percent. In terms of noise, there is little—only contact noise. The power- handling capa-
bility is generally low, but high- power versions are available with heat sinks.
Because of the wire- winding nature, these resistors have a component of inductances 
as well as capacitance associated with them. They tend to be inductive at lower fre-
quencies and somewhat capacitive at higher frequencies, regardless of resistance value. 
They also have a resonant frequency—with a very low Q value. For this reason, they are 
unsuitable for operation above 50 kHz—forget about RF applications. Precision wire-
wounds are not to be used for general- purpose work, but are reserved for high- accuracy 
dc applications such as high- precision dc measuring equipment and as reference resis-
tors for voltage regulators and decoding networks. (Note: There are certain  precision 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    315
wirewounds listed in manufacturers’ catalogs as “type HS” wirewounds. These resis-
tors have a special winding pattern that can greatly cut down on the inductance of the 
winds. There are two different types of HS wirewounds: one type has almost zero 
inductance but greatly increased interwinding capacitance; the other type has low 
inductance and low capacitance and is well suited for fast- settling amplifiers.)
Once considered the best and most stable resistors, precision wirewounds now have 
a competitor—precision film resistors, which can match them in most every regard.
Power Wirewound  
Power wirewound resistors are similar to their precision counterparts but are 
 designed to handle a lot more power. They will handle more power per unit vol-
ume than any other resistor. Some of the most powerful are wound similar to 
heater  elements and require some form of cooling (e.g., fans or immersion in liq-
uids such as mineral oil or high- density silicone liquids). These resistors are wound 
on a winding form, such as a ceramic tube, rod, heavily anodized aluminum, or 
fiberglass mandrel. The cores on which the windings are made have high heat con-
ductivity (Steatite, Alumina, beryllium oxide, etc.). They come in various shapes—
oval, flat, cylindrical—most shapes designed for heat dissipation. Chassis- mount 
wirewounds are generally cylindrical power resistors wound on a ceramic core 
molded and pressed into an aluminum heat sink and usually with heat- radiating 
fins. These are designed to be mounted to metal plates or a chassis to further con-
duct heat, which results in a rating about five times the normal power rating. Power 
wirewounds come in a variety of different accuracy and TCR ratings.
Metal Film  
In applications that involve fast rise times (microseconds) or high frequencies (mega-
hertz), metal- film resistors are usually the best. They are also quite cheap and come 
in small sizes (e.g., surface- mount). Metal- film resistors are often considered the 
best compromise of all resistors. Once considered less accurate and stable than wire-
wounds, the technology has greatly improved, with special precision metal- film resis-
tors reaching TC values as low as 20, 10, 5, and even 2 ppm/°C, with accuracies as 
good as 0.01 percent. They also have much less inductance than wirewounds and are 
smaller in size and less expensive. When compared to carbon- film resistors, they have 
lower TCs, lower noise, linearity, and better frequency characteristics and accuracy. 
They also surpass carbon- film resistors in terms of high- frequency characteristics. 
Carbon- film resistors do, however, come with higher maximum resistance values.
A metal- film resistor is made from a base metal that is vaporized in a vacuum and 
deposited on a ceramic rod or wafer. The resistance value is then controlled by careful 
adjustment of the width, length, and depth of the film. The process is very exacting, 
resulting in resistors with very tight tolerance values. Metal- film resistors are used 
extensively in surface- mount technology.
Carbon Film  
Carbon- film resistors are the most common resistor around. They are made by coating 
(dipping, rolling, printing, or spraying) a ceramic substrate with a special carbon- film 

316    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
mixture. The thickness and percentage of the carbon mixture roughly determine the 
resistance. To tailor resistances to precise values the ceramic pieces can be cut to a spe-
cific length. Further refinement is accomplished by cutting a spiral trimming groove—
see Fig. 3.53. An alternative method of producing carbon film is to mechanically apply 
carbon dust dispersed in a curable polymeric binder. The material is painted on the 
substrate in a spiral pattern and cured at a moderately elevated temperature.
Carbon- film resistors, with 1 percent tolerances, are normally manufactured with 
spiral cuts and have the same kind of voltage- overload limitations as metal- film 
types. Though these resistors are very popular, they are drifty (TC values around 
500 to 800 ppm/°C) and should not be used in circuits where metal- film resistors are 
intended. In other words, don’t confuse the two when building or replacing blown 
components. Carbon- film resistors have many of the same characteristics as carbon- 
composition  resistors—such as being noisy and having a voltage coefficient; they 
outperform carbon- composition resistors in terms of lower TCR ratings and tighter 
tolerances.  Resistor types include general- purpose, through- hole, and surface- mount 
devices. They also come in specialty types, such as high- power, high- voltage, and fus-
ible.  Tolerances of 1 percent or even better can be achieved; however, caution must be 
used in getting tight tolerances for this type of resistor because the TC, voltage coef-
ficient, and stability may mean that it is good only for that tolerance at the time it was 
installed. The TC of carbon- film resistors is in the neighborhood of 100 to 200 ppm and 
is generally negative. Frequency response of carbon- film resistors is among the best—
far better than wirewounds, and much better than carbon composition.
Carbon Composition  
Carbon- composition resistors, though not as popular as they once were, still find 
use in noncritical applications. They are composed of carbon particles mixed with a 
binder. The resistance value is varied by controlling the carbon concentration. This 
mixture is molded into a cylindrical shape and hardened by baking. Leads are 
attached axially to each end, and the assembly is encapsulated in a protective coat-
ing. Composition resistors are economical and exhibit low noise levels for resistances 
of about 1 MΩ. Composition resistors are usually rated for temperatures in the neigh-
borhood of 70°C for power ranging from 1⁄8 to 2 W. They have end- to- end shunted 
capacitance that may be noticed at frequencies in the neighborhood of 100 kHz, espe-
cially for resistance values above 0.3 MΩ.
However, due to poor tolerances—from 5 to 20 percent—carbon- composition 
 resistors should not be used in critical applications. Due to their construction, they 
generate considerable noise that varies depending on resistance value and the 
 package size (though above 1 MΩ they exhibit low noise).
Though composition resistors have many poor characteristics, they do quite well 
in overvoltage conditions. Where a metal- film resistor’s spiral gap would be zapped 
(breakdown causing it to short and destroy itself) during a severe overvoltage con-
dition, a carbon- composition resistor  wouldn’t be so wimpy. A carbon- composition 
resistor uses a large chunk of resistive material that can handle large overloads for 
a short time without any flashover effects (shorting). So if you’re planning to dis-
charge a high- voltage capacitor through a series resistor where tolerances and such 
aren’t important, carbon composition isn’t a bad choice. Power- handling capability 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    317
in relation to physical size is greater than with precision wirewounds but less than 
with power wirewounds.
Bulk- Metal Foil Resistors  
Foil resistors are similar in characteristics to metal films; they have better stability 
and lower TCRs (approaching those of precision wirewounds), and accuracy about 
that of metal- film resistors. High- precision versions can achieve tolerances as low 
as 0.005 percent and TCR values of 0.2 ppm/°C. Their main shining point is their 
 excellent frequency response. Foil resistors are manufactured by rolling the same 
wire materials as used in precision wirewound resistors to make thin strips of foil. 
This foil is then bonded to a ceramic substrate and etched to produce the value 
required. Their main disadvantage is limited high- value resistance values—less 
than those of metal films.
Filament Resistors
The filament resistors are similar to what’s called “bathtub boat resistors,” except 
they are not packaged in a ceramic shell (boat). The individual resistive element with 
the leads already crimped is coated with an insulating material, generally a high- 
temperature varnish. These are used in applications where tolerance, TCR, and sta-
bility are not important but the cost is. The cost of this type is slightly higher than for 
carbon composition and the electrical characteristics are better.
Thin- and Thick- Film Resistors  
Thin- film resistors are made by depositing an extremely thin layer of NiCr resistive 
film (less than 1 µm) on an aluminum oxide substrate, while using NiCu materials 
as conducting electrodes. Thin- film technology offers extreme precision and stability 
(tight tolerances and low TCR values). However, these resistors have relatively limited 
surge capabilities due to the low mass of the resistive material. Thin- film resistors 
are designed as small surface- mount devices used in PCB designs and are frequently 
used as microwave passive and active power components such as microwave power 
resistors, microwave power terminations, microwave resistive power dividers, and 
microwave attenuators.
Thick- film resistors, in contrast to thin- film resistors, use a thicker film of RuO2, 
and have PdAg electrodes. These materials are also mixed with glass- based material 
to form a paste for printing on the substrate. The thickness of the printing material is 
usually 12 µm. Thick- film resistors also exhibit decent precision and stability, perhaps 
approaching those of thin- film resistors; however, they far exceed thin films in terms 
of maximum surge capacity—one to two orders of magnitude difference. Thick- film 

318    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
resistors come in two- lead packages and in surface- mount form. Some thick- film 
 resistors are designed as power resistors.
Both thin- film and thick- film technologies are constantly improving, and it is 
 difficult to specify all characteristics. Your best bet is to consult manufacturers’ data 
sheets for more details.
Power- Film Resistors
Power- film resistors are similar in manufacture to their respective metal- film or 
 carbon- film resistors. They are manufactured and rated as power resistors, with power 
rating being the most important characteristic. Power- film resistors are available in 
higher maximum values than power wirewound resistors and have a very good fre-
quency response. They are generally used in applications requiring good frequency 
response and/or higher maximum values. Generally, they are used for power appli-
cations, where tolerances are wider, and the temperature ratings are changed so that 
under full load the resistor will not exceed the maximum design temperature. Also, the 
physical size of the resistor is larger, and in some cases the core is made from a heat- 
conductive material attached to a heat sink to dissipate heat more efficiently.
Metal Oxide (Power- Metal- Oxide Film, Flameproof)  
Metal- oxide resistors contain a resistance element formed by the oxidation reaction 
of a vapor or spray of tin- chloride solution on the heated surface of a glass or ceramic 
rod. The resulting tin- oxide film is adjusted to value by cutting a helix path through 
the film. These resistors can sustain high temperatures and electrical overloads, and 
have moderate- to- precision characteristics. Resistor types in this class include high- 
power and flameproof axial through- hole and surface- mount types. Axial versions 
are either blue in color or white. The outer shell of these resistors, which is flameproof 
like the interior, is also resistant to external heat and humidity. Metal- oxide resistors 
can be used to replace carbon- composition components in some applications. They 
are ideal for pulse- power applications. Small- sized power- type metal- oxide resistors 
come in a 0.5- to 5- W range, with standard tolerances of ±1 to ±5 percent and TCRs 
around ±300 ppm/°C. Metal- oxide resistors are used in general- purpose voltage 
 dividers, RC timing circuits, and as pullup and pulldown resistor surge applications 
(e.g., RC snubber circuits, current- limiting circuits, and overload ground lines). They 
also come with maximum resistance values exceeding those of wirewound resistors. 
In general, they have decent electrical and mechanical stability and high reliability.
Fuse Resistors (Carbon Composition,   
Power Oxide, Metal Film)   
       
A fuse resistor acts as both a resistor and a fuse. Fuse resistors are designed to open- 
circuit (fuse) when subjected to a large surge current or fault condition. They are spe-
cially spiraled to provide the fusible function with flame- retardant coating. The fusing 
current is calculated based on the amount of energy required to melt the resistive 
material (the melt temperature plus the amount of energy required to vaporize the 
resistive material). These resistors will typically run hotter than a normal precision or 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    319
power resistor, so that a momentary surge will bring the resistive element up to fusing 
temperature. Some designs create a hot spot inside the resistor to assist in this fusing. 
The major unknown when using fuse resistors is the heat transfer of the materials, 
which can be quite significant for pulses of long duration and is very difficult to calcu-
late. Mounting fuse resistors is critical, since this will affect the fusing current. Many 
fuse resistors are made to mount in fuse clips for more accurate fusing characteristics. 
They come in a variety of types, including carbon film, metal film, thin film, and wire-
wound fusible. Fuse resistors are widely used in constant voltage and overload pro-
tection circuits found in battery chargers, TV sets, cordless phones, PC/CPU coolers, 
and so on. Like traditional fuses, they come in fast- and slow- burn types.
Chip Resistor Arrays
Resistor arrays contain any combination of two or more resistive elements produced 
on a single substrate. The resistive elements can be constructed using thick- film or 
thin- film technologies. These arrays come in SIP and DIP packages as well as leadless 
surface- mountable packages with solderable terminations. Various circuit schematics 
are available, including isolated resistors, single common and dual common bused 
resistors. Resistor arrays are used for a wide range of applications where economy 
of space and weight and placement costs are at a premium. Tolerances are 1 percent 
and 5 percent, temperature coefficients range from 50 ppm to 200 ppm, and power 
capabilities compare to individual resistors of similar size.
Cement Resistors  
These resistors are designed as power resistors with the added provision of being 
heat and flame resistant. Typical power ratings range from 1 W to 20 W or more. 
Tolerances are around 5 percent, with TCR ratings of around 300 ppm/°C.
Zero- Ohm Resistors (Zero- Ohm Jumpers)  
These are really nothing more than a piece of wire used for crossovers, permanent 
jumpers, or program jumpers (manual switch circuitry) in PCB design. They look 
like a signal diode with a single black stripe in the center—not to be confused with a 
diode that has its stripe nearer to one end. The single black stripe is meant to signify 
a 0- Ω value. Advantages to using these zero- ohm resistors over simple wires  include 
ease of handling for mechanized PCB placement machinery, very low jumper-  
to- jumper capacitance (suitable for high- speed data lines), small footprint, and 
 overall improvement of PC board performance.

3.5.6  Variable Resistors (Rheostats, Potentiometers, Trimmers)
Variable resistors are often called potentiometers, or “pots” for short, because one very 
common use for them is as an adjustable voltage divider. For many years they were 
called “volume controls,” because another very common use was for adjusting the 
audio volume produced by amplifiers and radio and TV receivers. Another early 
name for essentially the same component (when it was used simply as a variable 
resistance) was “rheostat,” meaning a device to set the flow (of current). See Fig. 3.57.
Pots are made in a variety of physical forms, with different kinds of resistance ele-
ments. Some pots are designed to handle frequent manual adjustment via a control 
knob, while others are designed to be adjusted only occasionally with a screwdriver 
(or similar tool) for fine- tuning a circuit. The latter type is usually referred to as a 
preset pot, or simply a trimpot. Most rotary pots made for manual control offer a total 
rotation of about 270°—3⁄4 of a single turn. Such a limited range, however, can make 
accurate settings difficult, so multirevolution pots are also available. These pots have 
a resistance element arranged in a spiral or helix, and the wiper moves along as the 
control spindle is turned through multiple revolutions (typically, 10 or 20). It is pos-
sible to really home in on a resistance value with one of these pots. Multirevolution 
pots are rather expensive when compared to single- turn pots. For applications that 
require a logarithmic response (such as audio applications), you can get a pot with a 
logarithmic taper, as opposed to a linear taper. (Actually most logarithmic pots don’t 
have a true logarithmic response, as shown in Fig. 3.57. It is difficult to design such 
a device cheaply; making one with a near- logarithmic response isn’t so expensive.) 
Reverse logarithmic and antilog pots are also available—these are explained in the 
next section, on pot characteristics.
Trimpots can be made in circular, multiturn circular, linear- slider, and multiturn 
linear- slider form. Low- cost varieties generally use an open construction where the 
resistance element and slider are fully exposed and therefore are prone to contami-
nation by dust and moisture. Higher- quality trimpots are generally housed inside a 
small plastic case, which is often hermetically sealed. Some multirevolution trimpots 
FIGURE 3.57

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    321
use a worm drive system with a circular element, while others use a linear element 
with a slider driven via a lead- screw. In both cases, the reduction drive is designed to 
have very low backlash, providing smooth and accurate adjustment.
Pots can be combined together and actuated by using a common spindle. Such 
pots are referred to as ganged pots. Generally, only two pots are combined this way, but 
it’s possible to have more. Dual ganged pots with logarithmic taper are often used in 
amplifier design when dealing with stereo, where you have two distinct signals.
There are various materials used in the construction of pots, such as carbon, 
 Cermet, conductive plastic, and simple wire. Many of the characteristics that apply 
to fixed resistors also apply to variable resistors of the same nature—see the sec-
tion on fixed resistor characteristics. Characteristics unique to pots—such as resolu-
tion, resistance taper, hop- on/hop- off resistance, and contact resistance—will differ, 
 depending on material makeup. We will discuss these characteristics in a moment.
There are basically two ways a pot can be used in electronics. It can be used to 
adjust current levels or it can be used to adjust voltage levels. Figure 3.58 shows the 
basic setups for each scenario.
Adjusting load current: Here, a pot’s 
variable resistance element (a- to- b) 
is in series with a load. Adjusting 
manual control of the pot alters the 
current to the load. The current as a 
function of pot resistance is:
I
V
R
R
=
+
IN
POT
LOAD
Notice in the graph that the load cur-
rent follows a curve similar to that 
of the voltage. The equations in the 
figure display the maximum and 
minimum voltages and currents that 
can be applied across and through 
the load, where RPOTMAX represents 
the maximal pot resistance—which 
in this example is 10 kΩ.
 Adjusting load voltage: The second 
configuration is essentially a vari-
able voltage divider, which is used 
for adjusting the voltage applied to 
the load. Notice that in the graph, the 
load current  doesn’t fall as quickly as 
in the previous configuration. In fact, 
from 0 to 5 kΩ the current falls about 
only 1⁄10 its maximum value. How-
ever, from 5 kΩ on, the drop grows 
significantly.
FIGURE 3.58

322    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
3.5.7  Potentiometer Characteristics
Resistance Taper
Pots have either linear or log tapers. Pots with linear tapers have a linear relation-
ship between the wiper position and the resistance; for example, moving the wiper 
by 10 percent down the resistive element changes the resistance by 10 percent. (See 
Fig. 3.57.) On the other hand, a potentiometer with a log taper follows a logarithmic 
resistance change with wiper position, as shown in Fig. 3.57.
Naturally, the main use of common log taper pots is for controls that need to 
adjust a quantity in an approximate logarithmic fashion—such as for audio. Linear 
pots are used for most other applications. As an example, if you use a linear pot for 
a volume control, you’d run into problems; its adjustment grows far too rapidly as 
the pot is turned up from zero, while the rest of the pot’s rotation  doesn’t have much 
control—the pot’s useful range as a volume control is squeezed into the first 60° or so 
of rotation, making it hard to set the right level. The log taper pot, on the other hand, 
is perfect as a volume control, since its logarithmic change with position matches that 
of the human ear’s logarithmic response to sound levels.
Now, in reality, most modern log taper pots don’t have a true logarithmic charac-
teristic, but instead follow a rough approximation of a logarithmic curve, as shown in 
Fig. 3.57. The cost of manufacturing a true logarithmic taper is too high; it’s cheaper 
to coat a strip of material with two resistive elements of different resistive composi-
tion. This is quite acceptable as a volume control and is close to a two- slope resistance 
element, with the transition at about 50 percent rotation. There are indeed pots with 
true logarithmic response, which are made using a wirewound element on a  tapered 
form or are made with a bulk- metal element with a carefully granulated tapered 
 pattern.
Also shown in Fig. 3.57 are the curves for rotary reverse logarithmic and antilog 
taper pots, which are virtually the same as true logarithmic and log taper pots but 
made for the opposite, or anticlockwise, operation. These are not common nowadays, 
but are still available for special applications.
Resolution
This represents the smallest change in tapping ratio that can be made by moving the 
pot’s wiper. The resolution of wirewound pots tends to be fairly poor because the 
element is wound from discrete turns of resistance wire and the wiper contact can 
usually only slide from one turn to the next. The output of the pot, therefore, tends 
to vary in small regular steps, each corresponding to the voltage drop in one turn of 
the elements.
Pots using an etched bulk- metal element tend to have similar problems. However, 
pots that use a carbon- composition, hot- molded- carbon, or Cermet element tend to 
have somewhat better resolution because the resistance of their element is more finely 
graduated. Where high resolution is needed, multiturn pots tend to be more widely 
used than single- turn pots. It is argued that multiturn pots don’t have superior set-
tability. The next time you need a pot with superior settability, evaluate a multiturn 
pot and a single- turn pot. Set each one to the desired value, tap the pots with a pencil, 
and tell which one stays put. Normally, it is expected that a multiturn pot, whether it 
has a linear or a circular layout, is better, but in reality this is not true—it can be two 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    323
to four times worse than a single- turn pot because the mechanical layout of a single- 
turn pot is more stable and balanced.
Contact Resistance
This represents the contact resistance between the pot’s wiper and the resistance 
element, which has an effect on the resolution. Contact resistance also affects the 
noise generated by the pot, both when it’s being adjusted and when it’s simply in 
a fixed setting. The type of contact style and material used in pots affects contact 
resistance. For example, many carbon- composition pots use a simple wiper stamped 
from nickel- plated spring steel, with multiple fingers to give parallel wiping contacts 
in order to reduce contact resistance. Higher- power wirewound pots may use a wiper 
with a brush made from a single block of carbon, but the block is made with a load-
ing of copper powder to keep the contact resistance as low as possible. High- grade 
pots with Cermet or bulk- metal elements generally have a multifinger spring metal 
wiper of gold- plated phosphor bronze or steel. Many small trimpots of the cheaper 
variety have a simple spring metal wiper with a pressed dimple contact that touches 
the element. This is okay when the trimpot  doesn’t get a lot of adjustment, but with 
frequent adjustment, the contact resistance tends to rise.
Hop- on and Hop- off Resistance
Most pots, whether rotary or linear- slider in design and regardless of type of resis-
tance element, tend to have metal contact strips at the ends of the fixed element. The 
wiper contact generally touches and rests on these metal strips when it’s at either 
extreme of its travel. However, when the wiper is moved away from these extremes, 
it soon hops on or off the actual resistance element. Ideally, the change in resistance 
that occurs at the hop- on and hop- off should be zero, so that there are no sudden 
changes when the pot is used as a volume control, for example. However, it isn’t 
easy to manufacture a pot without this flaw; the best generally keep the hop- on and 
hop- off resistance below about 1 percent of the total value of the resistance element. 
This is so low that it usually can’t be detected in most audio and similar applications.
Pot Markings
As well as being marked with a character string indicating the total value of the resis-
tance element—for example, 100 K or 1 M—the case of a pot generally also carried a 
code letter showing its resistance taper curve. Today most pots are marked according 
to the simplified taper coding system adopted by Asian component manufacturers:
A = log taper
B = linear taper
However, in older equipment you may come across pots marked according to an 
earlier taper coding system:
A = linear taper
C = log or audio taper
F = antilog taper
Notice the possible source of confusion!

324    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Notes on Pots
Don’t exceed your pot’s I and V ratings. If you put a constant voltage between the 
wiper and one end and turn the resistance way down, you will exceed the maximum 
wiper current rating and soon damage or destroy the wiper contact. Note that the 
power rating of most variable resistors is based on the assumption that the power 
dissipation is uniformly distributed over the entire element. If half of the element 
is required to dissipate the device’s rated power, the pot may last for a short while. 
However, if a quarter of the element is required to dissipate the same amount of 
power, the pot will fail quickly. Also, some trimming pots are not rated to carry any 
significant dc current through the wiper. This dc current, even a milliamp, could 
cause electromigration, leading to an open circuit or noisy, unreliable wiper action. 
Carbon pots are not likely to be degraded by such a failure.
Digital Pots
Digital pots are basically analog variable resistors whose value is set by applying a 
digital code to their digital input leads. The actual inner circuitry is an array of digi-
tally controlled switches that can add or subtract segments of an integrated array 
of single polycrystalline resistor elements. Depending on the digital code applied, 
a few or all the internal integrated resistors can add in series to a desired resultant 
resistance. Some digital pots are quite advanced, allowing you to store wiper posi-
tions in memory. Other control signals may enable the chip, increment or decrement 
the resistance a given amount, and so on. Digital pots can be used as three- terminal 
devices or as two- terminal devices. The most common is a three- terminal device, 
where the digital pot acts as a voltage divider. The two- terminal method is used 
to make the digital pot a variable current- control device—say, to step the amount 
of current flow through a diode. These devices are very handy in many types of 
analog circuits that interface with digital, such as amplifiers where the gain is de-
termined by the digital pot’s resistance in the feedback circuit. Another example is 
in filter design, where the digital pot replaces the resistance used to set the cutoff 
frequency. It is worth purchasing a few of these devices once you start playing with 
 microcontrollers.
3.6  Capacitors
FIGURE 3.59

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    325
Capacitors perform a number of functions in electronics. One major function is simple 
energy storage, where charge from an applied current is stored within the capacitor and 
later released back into the circuit as useful current. The rate of charging and discharg-
ing can be controlled by placing a resistor in series with the capacitor. This effect is 
often used in high- current discharge circuits (photoflashes, actuators, etc.), as well as 
small energy backup supplies for low- power memory ICs. It is also used to smooth 
out power supply ripple, control timing in ICs, and alter the shape of waveforms.
The second major function of a capacitor when placed in series with a signal 
path is to block dc while allowing ac signal components to pass. A capacitor used 
in this way is referred to as a dc- blocking or ac- coupling capacitor. At dc, a capacitor’s 
impedance is ideally infinite—no current flows, no dc levels within a mixed signal 
are passed. However, if an ac signal is applied, the capacitor’s impedance becomes 
a finite value, dependent on the frequency of the signal. The higher the frequency, 
the lower the impedance—ideally. So, in essence, a series capacitor can be used to 
couple two circuits together without introducing unwanted dc shifts into the next 
stage, and can control how much of a given frequency signal gets through—it con-
trols the attenuation.
Now, a capacitor placed in parallel with a signal path (i.e., to ground) has an effect 
opposite that of the coupling capacitor. Instead, it acts as a decoupling capacitor, allow-
ing dc to continue along the path, while diverting high- frequency signal components 
to ground—the capacitor acts as a low- impedance path to ground. A similar effect, 
known as bypassing, is used when a capacitor is placed across a particular circuit ele-
ment to divert unwanted frequencies around it. Decoupling and bypassing become 
fundamental when removing unwanted random high- frequency ripple and other 
undesired alterations within a supply voltage (or voltage- critical location) caused by 
random noise, or sudden current demands generated by accompanying circuit ele-
ments. Without decoupling and bypassing, many sensitive circuits, especially those 
incorporating digital logic ICs, have a tendency to misbehave.
Capacitors are also in passive and active filter networks, LC resonant circuits, 
RC snubber circuits, and so on. In these applications, it’s the reactive response to 
change in applied frequency that makes the capacitor useful. We’ll take a closer look 
at  capacitor applications later in this chapter.
FIGURE 3.60

326    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
3.6.1  Capacitance
When a dc voltage V is applied across the leads of a capacitor, one of its “plates” 
charges up to a value of Q = CV, while the other plate will charge up to −Q. Here Q 
is the charge in coulombs (C) and C is the capacitance, or simply the proportional 
constant that relates Q with V. Capacitance is measured in farads, F (1 F = 1 C/1 V). 
Once the capacitor is charged, obtaining a voltage nearly equal to the source volt-
age, it will not pass any dc current—the physical separation between plates pre-
vents this.
Capacitors come with various capacitance values, typically from 1 pF (1 × 10−12F) 
to 68,000 µF (0.068 F), and with various maximum voltage ratings, from a few volts to 
thousands of volts, depending on the type of capacitor.
In practical terms, the capacitance simply tells you how much charge can be 
stored within the capacitor. For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.60 shows how a 4300- µF 
capacitor holds more charge than a 100- µF capacitor, and, hence, will supply more 
current to keep the LED lit longer.
3.6.2  Capacitors in Parallel
When capacitors are placed in parallel, their capacitances add, just as they do for 
resistors in series:
 
Ctot = C1 + C2 + … Cn (Parallel capacitors)
Intuitively, you can think of capacitors in parallel representing one single capacitor 
with increased plate surface area. It’s important to note that the largest voltage that 
can be applied safely to a group of capacitors in parallel is limited to the voltage rat-
ing of the capacitor with the lowest voltage rating. Both the capacitance and voltage 
rating are usually included next to the capacitor symbol in schematics, but often the 
voltage rating is missing; you must figure out the rating based on the expected volt-
ages present at that point in the circuit.
FIGURE 3.61

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    327
3.6.3  Capacitors in Series
When two or more capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than 
that of the smallest capacitor in the group. The equivalent capacitance is calculated 
similarly to the resistance calculation for resistors in parallel:

C

Capacitors in series

 (
)
Capacitors may be connected in series to enable the group to withstand a larger 
voltage than any individual capacitor is rated to withstand (the maximum voltage 
ratings add). The trade- off is a decrease in total capacitance—though that could be 
what you intend to do, if you can’t find a capacitor or create a parallel arrangement 
that gives you the desired capacitance value. Notice in Fig. 3.61 that the voltage does 
not divide equally among capacitors. The voltage across a single capacitor—say, C2—
is a fraction of the total, expressed as (Ctot/C2)Vin. There are circuits that tap the volt-
age between series capacitors.
Use care to ensure that the voltage rating of any capacitor in the group is not 
 exceeded. If you use capacitors in series to withstand larger voltages, it’s a good idea to 
also connect an equalizing resistor across each capacitor. Use resistors with about 100 Ω 
per volt of supply voltage, and be sure they have sufficient power- handling capability. 
With real capacitors, the leakage resistance of the capacitor may have more effect on the 
voltage division than does the capacitance. A capacitor with a high parallel resistance 
will have the highest voltage across it. Adding equalizing resistors reduces this effect.
3.6.4  RC Time Constant
When a capacitor is connected to a dc voltage source, it will charge up almost instan-
taneously. Likewise, a charged capacitor that is shorted with a wire will discharge 
almost instantaneously. However, with some resistance added, the rate of charge or 
discharge follows an exponential pattern, as shown in Fig. 3.62. There are numerous 
applications that use controlled charge and discharge rates, such as timing ICs, oscil-
lators, waveform shapers, and low- discharge power backup circuits.
FIGURE 3.62

328    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When charging a capacitor through a resistor, the voltage across the capacitor, 
with respect to time, is given as:
 
V(t) = VS (1 − e−(t/RC)) (Charging RC)
where V(t) is the capacitor voltage in volts at time t, VS is the source voltage, t is the 
time in seconds after the source voltage is applied, e = 2.718, R is the circuit resistance 
in ohms, and C is the capacitance in farads. Theoretically, the charging process never 
really finishes, but eventually the charging current drops to an unmeasurable value. 
A convention often used is to let t = RC, which makes V(t) = 0.632 Vs. The RC term is 
called the time constant of the circuit and is the time in seconds required to charge 
the capacitor to 63.2 percent of the supply voltage. The lowercase tau (τ) is often 
used to represent RC: τ = RC. After two time constants (t = 2RC = 2τ), the capacitor 
charges  another 63.2 percent of the difference between the capacitor voltage at one 
time constant and the supply voltage, for a total change of 86.5 percent. After three 
time constants, the capacitor reaches 95 percent of the supply voltage, and so on, as 
illustrated in the graph in Fig. 3.62. After five time constants, a capacitor is considered 
fully charged, having reached 99.24 percent of the source voltage.
For a discharging capacitor, the following equation is used:
 
V(t) = VSe−(t/RC) (Discharging RC)
This expression is essentially the inverse of the previous expression for a charg-
ing capacitor. After one time constant, the capacitor voltage will have dropped by 
63.2 percent from the supply voltage, so it will have reached 37.8 percent of the 
supply voltage. After five time constants, the capacitor is considered fully discharged; 
it will have dropped 99.24 percent, or down to 0.76 percent of the supply voltage.
3.6.5  Capacitive Reactance
The amount of charge that can be placed on a capacitor is proportional to the  applied 
voltage and the capacitance (Q = CV). Within an ac circuit, the amount of charge moves 
back and forth in the circuit every cycle, so the rate of movement of charge (current) 
is proportional to voltage, capacitance, and frequency. When the effect of  capacitance 
and frequency are considered together, they form a quantity similar to  resistance. 
However, since no actual heat is being generated, the effect is termed capacitive 
 reactance. The unit for reactance is the ohm, just as for resistors, and the formula for 
calculating the reactance of a capacitor at a particular frequency is given by:
 
X
fC
C =
1
2π
 (
)
Capacitive reactance
where XC is the capacitive reactance in ohms, f is the frequency in hertz, C is the 
capacitance in farads, and π = 3.1416. Often, omega (ω) is used in place of 2πf.
It’s important to note that even though the unit of reactance is the ohm, there is 
no power dissipated in reactance. The energy stored in the capacitor during one por-
tion of the cycle is simply returned to the circuit in the next. In other words, over a 
complete cycle, the average power is zero. See the graph in Fig. 3.63.

As you can see, the reactance decreases with an increase in frequency and/or an 
increase in capacitance. The right graph in Fig. 3.63 shows the reactance versus the 
frequency of a capacitor. Real capacitors don’t follow the graph and equation so pre-
cisely, a result of parasitic effects.
3.6.6  Real Capacitors
There are many different types of capacitors, used for various applications. Selecting 
the right one can be confusing. The main reason for the variety of different capaci-
tors has to do with nonideal characteristics of real capacitors. They contain salient 
imperfections or parasitic effects that can mess up a particular circuit’s performance. 
Some capacitors, due to their construction, may have larger resistive or inductive 
components inherent in their design. Others may act in a nonlinear fashion or may 
contain dielectric memory. Understanding the effects these parasitics have in each 
application largely determines which capacitor you select.
The four major nonideal capacitor parameters are leakage (parallel resistance), 
equivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent series inductance (ESL), and dielectric 
 absorption (memory). Figure 3.64 shows a schematic model of a real- life capacitor. 
These parameters, as well as a number of other specifications are explained in the 
following section.
3.6.7  Capacitor Specifications
DC Working Voltage (DCWV)
This is the maximum safe limit of dc voltage across a capacitor to prevent dielectric 
breakdown—a condition that usually results in a puncture in the dielectric offering a 
low- resistance current path between the two plates. It is not safe to connect  capacitors 
FIGURE 3.63

330    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
across an ac power line unless they are rated for it. Capacitors with dc ratings may 
short the line. Several manufacturers make capacitors specifically rated for use across 
the ac power line. For use with other ac signals, the peak value of ac voltage should 
not exceed the dc working voltage, unless otherwise specified in component rat-
ings. In other words, the RMS value of ac should be 0.707 times the DCWV value or 
lower. With many types of capacitors, further derating is required as the operating 
 frequency increases.
Capacitor Leakage (RL)
This is the internal leakage, as shown in the real capacitor model, that trickles off at 
a rate determined by the RLC time constant. Leakage becomes an important param-
eter when dealing with ac coupling applications and storage applications, and when 
 capacitors are used in high- impedance circuits. Capacitors notorious for high leakage 
are electrolytic- type capacitors, on the order of 5 to 20 nA per µF. These capacitors are 
not suited for storage or high- frequency coupling applications. A better choice would 
be a film- type capacitor such as polypropylene or polystyrene, which has extremely 
low leakage current—insulation resistance typically greater than 106 MΩ.
Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR)
This is a mathematical construct, expressed in ohms, that allows all capacitor losses 
(resistance in capacitor leads, electrodes, dielectric losses, and leakage) at a single 
specific frequency to be expressed as a single series resistance with the capacitance. 
A high ESR causes a capacitor to dissipate more power (loss) when high- ac currents 
are flowing. This can degrade the capacitor. This can also have serious performance 
consequences at RF and in supply decoupling carrying high ripple currents. How-
ever, it is unlikely to have a significant effect in precision high- impedance, low- level 
analog circuitry. ESR can be calculated using the following equation:
 
ESR = XC/Q = XC × DF
where XC is the reactance, Q the quality factor, and DF the dissipation factor of the 
capacitor. Once you know the ESR, you can calculate how much power is lost due 
to internal heating, assuming a sine wave RMS current is known: P = IRMS
2 × ESR. 
So a capacitor that’s considered lossy presents a large XC and is highly resistive to 
signal power. Using capacitors with low ESR is important in high- current, high- 
performance applications, such as power supplies and high- current filter networks. 
FIGURE 3.64

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    331
The lower the ESR, the higher the current- carrying ability. A few capacitors with low 
ESR include both mica and film types.
Equivalent Series Inductance (ESL)
The ESL of a capacitor models the inductance of the capacitor’s leads in series with 
the equivalent capacitance of the capacitor plates. Like ESR, ESL can also be a seri-
ous problem at high frequencies (e.g., RF), even though the precision circuitry itself 
may be operating at dc or low frequencies. The reason is that the transistors used in 
the analog circuits may have gain extending up to transition frequencies of hundreds 
of megahertz, or even several gigahertz, and can amplify resonances involving low 
values of inductance. This makes it essential that the power supply terminals of such 
circuits be decoupled properly at high frequency. Electrolytic, paper, or plastic- film 
capacitors are a poor choice for decoupling at high frequencies; they basically consist 
of two sheets of foil separated by sheets of plastic or paper dielectric and formed 
into a roll. This kind of structure has considerable self- inductance and acts more 
like an inductor than a capacitor at frequencies exceeding just a few megahertz. An 
 appropriate choice for HF decoupling is a monolithic, ceramic- type capacitor, which 
has very low series inductance. It consists of a multilayer sandwich of metal films 
and ceramic dielectric, and the films are joined in parallel to bus bars rather than 
rolled in series. A minor trade- off is that monolithic ceramic capacitors can be micro-
phonic (i.e., sensitive to vibration), and some types may even be self- resonant, with 
comparatively high Q, because of the low series resistance accompanying their low 
inductance. Disc ceramic capacitors are often used, but they are often quite inductive, 
although less expensive. Lead length of a capacitor and its construction determine 
the capacitor’s self- inductance and, thus, its resonant frequency.
Dissipation Factor (DF) or Tangent Delta (tan c)
This is the ratio of all loss phenomena (dielectric and resistive) to capacitive reac-
tance, usually expressed as a percent. It can be thought of as the ratio of energy dis-
sipated per cycle to energy stored per cycle. It is also the ratio of the current in phase 
with the applied voltage to the reactive current. Dissipation factor also turns out to be 
equivalent to the reciprocal of the capacitor’s figure of merit, or Q, which is also often 
included in the manufacturer’s data sheet. DF must be given at a specific frequency 
to be meaningful. A lower DF indicates less power dissipated under otherwise identi-
cal conditions.
Dielectric Absorption (DA)
Monolithic ceramic capacitors are excellent for HF decoupling, but they have con-
siderable dielectric absorption, which makes them unsuitable for use as the hold 
capacitor of a sample- hold amplifier. Dielectric absorption is a hysteresis- like inter-
nal charge distribution within the dielectric that causes a capacitor that is quickly 
discharged and then open- circuited to appear to recover some of its charge. Since 
the amount of charge recovered is a function of its previous charge, this is, in effect,  
a charge memory and will cause errors in any sample- hold amplifier where such a 
capacitor is used as the hold capacitor. DA is given as a percent of charge stored in a 
capacitor’s dielectric, as opposed to the foil surfaces. It can be approximated by the 
ratio of the equilibrium value “self- recharge” voltage to the voltage before discharge. 

332    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Capacitors with low dielectric absorption, typically less than 0.01 percent, suitable for 
sample- hold applications, include polyester, polypropylene, and Teflon.
Temperature Coefficient (TC)
This represents the change in capacitance with temperature, expressed linearly as 
parts per million per degree centigrade (ppm/°C), or as a percent change over a 
specified temperature range. Most film capacitors are not linear; therefore, their TC is 
usually expressed as a percentage. TC should always be factored in to designs operat-
ing at temperature above or below 25°C.
Insulation Resistance (IR)
This is a measure of the resistance to a dc current flow through the capacitor 
under steady- state conditions. Values for film and ceramic capacitors are usually 
expressed in megaohm- microfarads for a given design and dielectric. The actual 
resistance of the capacitor is obtained by dividing the megohm- microfarads by 
the capacitance.
Quality Factor (Q)
This is the ratio of the energy stored to that dissipated per cycle. It is defined as  
Q = XC/RESR. In one respect, Q is a figure of merit that defines a circuit component’s 
ability to store energy compared to the energy it wastes. The rate of heat conversion 
is generally in proportion to the power and frequency of the applied energy. Energy 
entering the dielectric, however, is attenuated at a rate proportional to the frequency 
of the electric field and the loss tangent of the material. Thus, if a capacitor stores 1000 J 
of energy and dissipates only 2 J in the process, it has a Q of 500.
IRMS
This is the maximum RMS ripple current in amps at a given frequency.
Ipeak
This is the maximum peak current in amps at 25°C for nonrepetitive pulses or where 
the pulse time off is sufficient to allow cooling so overheating will not result.
Graphs Representing Real Capacitor Characteristics
Graph A: Real capacitors aren’t entirely capacitively reactive. 
They also have inductive and resistive elements (ESL, ESR) that 
influence their overall impedance. As shown in the graph, as 
the frequency increases toward the capacitor’s self- resonant fre-
quency, the impedance reaches a minimum, equal to the ESR. 
Past this frequency, the nonideal inductive reactance character-
istic kicks in, leading to an increase in overall impedance. For 
many applications, the capacitor’s series- resonant frequency 
sets the upper frequency limit, especially where the phase angle 
of the capacitor is expected to maintain near 90° voltage/current 
relationship. The type of construction of the capacitor and lead 
length affect the self- inductance and thus can shift the resonant 
frequency. Graphs like these are given by manufacturers and 
are useful when selecting decoupling capacitors.

capacitors changes with frequency.
3.6.8  Types of Capacitors
Here’s an overview of the various capacitors available. More in- depth coverage is 
provided in Table 3.7.
Trimmer (Variable)
These are usually designated as tuning or trimmer capacitors. Trimmer capacitors use 
ceramic or plastic dielectrics and are typically within the picofarad range.  Trimmer 
Graph C: Shows the temperature characteristics for various 
capacitors. Note the extraordinary curve of the HiK ceramic 
capacitor. Utmost attention must be used when using this type

tions. NPO ceramics have the best temperature characteristic, 
followed by film, mica, and tantalum.

tem-perature for various capacitors.
FIGURE 3.65  (Continued)

334    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
capacitors often have their capacitance range printed on them but also may use the 
following color code: yellow (1 to 5 pF), beige (2 to 10 pF), brown (6 to 20 pF), red  
(10 to 40 pF), purple (10 to 60 pF), black (12 to 100 pF), and so on. They are often used 
for fine- tuning sensitive circuits or for compensating as a circuit ages.
Air Core (Variable)
This is an air- spaced capacitor dielectric that is the best approximation to the 
ideal picture. These capacitors are large when compared to those of the same 
value using other dielectrics. Their capacitance is very stable over a wide tem-
perature range. Leakage losses are low, and therefore a very high Q can be 
 obtained. To vary the capacitance, the effective surface area of an array of par-
allel plates is altered via a mechanical turn- knob. Tuning capacitors are used 
mainly in radio- tuning  applications.
Vacuum
These come in both fixed and variable types. They are rated by their maximum work-
ing voltages (3 to 60 kV), capacitance (1 to 5000 pF), and currents. Losses are specified 
as negligible for most applications. There is excellent leakage control. These are used 
in high- voltage applications such as RF transmitters.
Aluminum Electrolytic
These capacitors have space between their foil plates filled with a chemical paste. 
When voltage is applied, a chemical reaction forms a layer of insulating material on 
the foil. Electrolytic capacitors are popular because they provide high capacitance 
values in small packages at a reasonable cost. They leak badly, have bad tolerances, 
drift, and have high internal inductance, limiting them to low- frequency applica-
tions. Their range is from about 0.1 to 500,000 µF. Aluminum electrolytic capaci-
tors are very popular and are heavily used in almost every kind of circuit, since 
they are cheap, readily available, and good for filters and storage of large amounts 
of charge. They will explode, however, if the rated working voltage is exceeded 
or polarity is reversed. This also means you  shouldn’t apply an ac voltage across 
an electrolytic capacitor. If an ac voltage is superimposed on a dc voltage, make 
sure that the peak value does not exceed the voltage rating. Aluminum electro-
lytic  capacitors are not suited for high- frequency coupling applications due to poor 
isolation resistance and internal inductance. Electrolytic capacitors should not be 
used if the dc potential is well below the capacitor working voltage. Applications 
include power supply ripple filters, audio coupling, and bypassing. There are also 
nonpolarized electrolytic capacitors, but these are more expensive and larger than 
their polarized relatives.
Tantalum Electrolytic
These capacitors are made of tantalum pentoxide. Like electrolytic capacitors, they are 
polarized, so watch the “+” and “−.” They are smaller, lighter, and more stable; they 
leak less and have less inductance when compared to aluminum electrolytics, but they 
tend to be more expensive, have a lower maximum working voltage and capacitance, 
and are easily prone to damage due to current spikes. For the last reason, tantalum elec-
trolytics are used mostly in analog signal systems that lack high current- spike noise. 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    335
Tantalum capacitors are not suited for storage or high- frequency coupling applications 
due to poor isolation resistance and internal inductance. They should not be used if the 
dc potential is well below the capacitor working voltage. Applications include block-
ing, bypassing, decoupling, and filtering.
Polyester Film
These capacitors use a thin polyester film as their dielectric. They do not have as 
high a tolerance as polypropylene capacitors, but they have good temperature stabil-
ity, and they are popular and cheap. Tolerances are from 5 to 10 percent. These are 
a good choice for coupling and/or storage applications due to high isolation resis-
tance. They are typically used in moderately high- frequency circuits and audio and 
oscillator circuits.
Polypropylene Film
This type uses a polypropylene film dielectric and is used mainly when a higher 
tolerance is needed than what a polyester film capacitor can provide. Tolerance 
is about 1 percent. This is a good choice for coupling and/or storage applications 
due to high isolation resistance. This type exhibits stable capacitance for frequen-
cies below 100 kHz. These capacitors are used for noise suppression, blocking, 
bypassing, coupling, filtering, and timing.
Silver Mica
These are made from depositing a thin layer of silver on a mica dielectric. They are 
very stable with respect to time (tolerances of 1 percent or less), and have a good tem-
perature coefficient and excellent endurance, but they don’t come in high capacitance 
values and can be expensive. They are used in resonance circuits and high- frequency 
filters, due to good stability with temperature. They are also used in high- voltage 
circuits, because of their good insulation. Their temperature coefficient, in regard to 
oscillators, isn’t as low as can be achieved by other types, and some silver micas have 
been known to behave erratically.
Ceramic (Single- Layer)
These capacitors are constructed with materials such as titanium acid barium for the 
dielectric. Internally, these capacitors are not constructed as a coil, so they have low 
inductance and are well suited for use in higher- frequency applications. Together 
with electrolytics, they are the most widely used capacitor around. Ceramic capaci-
tors come in three basic varieties:
Ultrastable or temperature compensating: This type is one of the most highly stable capaci-
tors, made from a mixture of titanates. It has very predictable temperature coeffi-
cients (TCs) and, in general, does not have an aging characteristic. The most popular 
ultrastable ceramic capacitor is the NPO (negative- positive 0 ppm/°C) or COG (EIA 
designation); others include N030 (SIG) and N150 (P2G). The TC for these capaci-
tors is specified in the capacitance change in parts per million (ppm) per  degrees 
centigrade. To calculate the maximum capacitance change with  temperature, the 

336    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
following equation is used. Here we used a 1000- pF NPO capacitor that has reached 
35°C, or a change in temperature (∆T) of 10°C above the standard reference tem-
perature of 25°C. The TC of an NPO capacitor is 0 ± 30 ppm/°C.

Therefore, a 1000- pF capacitor subjected to a 10°C change in temperature may  result 
in a value as high as 1000.3 pF or as low as 999.7 pF. Ultrastable capacitors are best 
suited for applications where stability over a wide variation of temperatures and 
high Q are required. Filter networks and most circuits associated with tuning and 
timing, as well as various types of resonant circuits, generally require ultrastable 
capacitors. They are particularly suitable for oscillator construction in order to com-
pensate for frequency drift with temperature. See Table 3.7 for more details.
Semistable: These are not nearly as temperature stable as the ultrastable capaci-
tors; however, they have a higher electrostatic capacity. All semistable capaci-
tors vary in capacitance value under the influence of temperature, operating 
voltage (both ac and dc), and frequency. These capacitors are best suited for 
 applications where high capacitance values are important, while Q stability over 
 temperature is not a major concern. The TC for semistable capacitors is expressed 
as a percentage. So a 1000- pF X7R capacitor, which has a TC of ±15 percent, 
might be as high as 1150 pF or as low as 850 pF at temperatures above or 
below 25°C. EIA TC designations are as follows: the first character defines the 
low- temperature limit (X = −55°C, Y = −30°C, Z = +10°C); the second character 
defines the high- temperature limit (5 = +85°C, 7 = +125°C); the third character 
defines the maximum capacitance change in percentage (V = +22, −82 percent,  
U = +22, −56 percent, T = +22, −33 percent, S = ±22 percent, R ±15 percent,  
P = ±10 percent, F = ±7.5 percent, E = ±4.7 percent). See Table 3.7 and Fig. 3.66 for 
more details and applications.
HiK: This variety has a high dielectric constant, or electrostatic capacity, but it has poor 
stability, poor DA, and a high voltage coefficient, and is sensitive to vibration—
some types may be resonant, with comparatively high Q. There is very poor tem-
perature drift, high voltage coefficient of capacitance, high voltage coefficient of 
dissipation, high frequency coefficient of capacitance, and significant aging rate. 
These also exhibit low inductance, a wide range of values, small size, and higher 
density than dipped ceramic. They are best suited for coupling (dc  blocking) and 
power supply bypassing. They should be used only in linear  applications where 
performance and stability are of no great concern.
Multilayer Ceramic
These capacitors were developed to meet the demand for high- density ceramic 
 capacitors. They incorporate multiple printed layers of electrode plates made of 
thin ceramic sheets. These capacitors are more compact and have, in general, better 
temperature characteristics than single- layer ceramic capacitors. They are, however, 
more expensive. Like single- layer ceramic capacitors, they come in ultrastable, stable, 
and HiK types. See Table 3.7 for more details and applications.

Polystyrene
These use a polystyrene dielectric. They are constructed like a coil inside, so they are 
not suitable for high- frequency applications. They are used extensively within filter 
circuits and timing applications, and also in coupling and storage applications due to 
a high isolation resistance. A warning worth noting: polystyrene capacitors exhibit a 
permanent change in value should they ever be exposed to temperatures much over 
70°C; they do not return to their old value upon cooling.
Metallized Film (Polyester and Polypropylene)
These utilize thin conductors or plates that have a distinct size advantage over other 
types. They are formed by a vacuum- deposition process that laminates a film sub-
strate with a thin aluminum coating measured in angstroms. These capacitors are 
used where small signal levels (low current/high impedance) and small physical size 
are primary factors.
Metallized- film capacitors are generally not appropriate for large- signal ac appli-
cations. Film and foil types are better suited for this purpose, since they have much 
thicker plates (foil) that help carry away heat buildups, thus lowering losses, extend-
ing life, and reducing effects on DF.
One major advantage of metallized- film capacitors is their self- healing charac-
teristic—a feature resulting from the extreme thinness of the metallized electrode 
material. Whenever a flaw or weak spot in the dielectric results in a short condition, 
the stored electrons in the capacitor and the accompanying circuitry will immediately 
avalanche across the shorted point. This can vaporize the thin metallic electrode. 
The vaporized electrode forms a reasonably concentric pattern away from the point 
of the short. As a result of the vaporization, the short condition is removed and 
the capacitor is again operational. This effect is known as clearing, which is the self- 
healing process. In nonmetallized capacitors, the short condition results in a cata-
strophic permanent failure.
Some disadvantages over nonmetallized film capacitors include a slightly higher 
dissipation factor, slightly lower insulation resistance, lower maximum current, and 
lower maximum ac- voltage- frequency capability. In general, this type is a good- 
quality, low- drift, temperature- stable capacitor. Applications include moderately 
high- frequency, low- current circuits, noise suppression, timing, snubbing, switching 
power supplies, bypassing, and audio applications.
Supercapacitors (Double- Layer or Ultracapacitors)
These devices store extremely large amounts of charge (from 0.022 to 50 F)—much 
more than a typical capacitor. This level of energy storage approaches around 1⁄10 that 
of a low- density battery. However, unlike a battery, the power output can be 10 times 
greater—a useful feature in high- current pulse applications.
Supercapacitors consist of two nonreactive porous plates suspended within an 
electrolyte. A voltage applied to the positive plate attracts the negative ions in the 
electrolyte, while the voltage on the negative plate attracts the positive ions. This 
 effectively creates two layers of capacitive storage, one where the charges are separat-
ed at the positive plate and another where the charges are separated at the negative 
plate. Conductive rubber membranes contain the electrode and electrolyte material 
and make contact with a cell. Several cells are stacked in series to achieve the desired 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    341
voltage ratings. Typical voltage ratings are 3.5 and 5.5, in keeping with their common 
role as backup capacitors for 3.3 V or 5 V devices.
Battery/Supercapacitor Comparison
A supercapacitor can be charged to any voltage within its voltage rating extremely 
quickly, and it can be stored totally discharged, while many batteries are damaged 
by quick charging. The state of charge of a supercapacitor is simply a function of its 
voltage, while the state of charge of a battery is complex and often unreliable. Though 
a battery will store more energy than a supercapacitor, a supercapacitor is able to 
deliver frequent high- power pulses without any detrimental effect, while many bat-
teries experience reduced life under similar conditions.
Supercapacitors can be used as an intermediate power source or a bridge between 
batteries and conventional capacitors. Many applications benefit from the use of super-
capacitors, from those requiring short power pulses to those requiring low- power, long- 
duration support of critical memory systems—they are capable of maintaining contents 
of low- dissipation CMOS memory for several months. They are excellent solutions in a 
number of systems when used alone or combined with other energy sources. Examples 
include quick- charge applications that can be charged in seconds and then discharge 
over a few minutes (power tools and toys), short- term support for uninterruptible 
power systems, where the supercapacitor provides the power for short outages, or as a 
bridge to a generator or other continuous backup power supply. They can provide load- 
leveling to an energy- rich, power- poor energy source such as a solar array.
When supercapacitors are strategically placed within battery- powered systems, 
they can prevent peak power–induced battery stress by supplying the peak power 
demands for the battery. This often allows a smaller- capacity battery to be used, and 
it can even extend the overall life span of the battery.
Supercapacitors exhibit high ESR, so they are not recommended for ripple 
 absorption in dc power supply applications. See the “Capacitor Applications” section 
for example supercapacitor circuits.
Oil- Filled Capacitor
This type is used in high- voltage, high- current applications that generate a lot of heat—
the oil cools the capacitor. Applications include induction heating, high- energy pulsing, 
commutation, equipment bypassing, ignitions, frequency conversion, high- voltage rip-
ple filtering, snubbing, coupling, and spark generation. Voltages range from 1 to 300 kV, 
and capacitance from around 100 pF to 5000 µF. Typically, they come in large packages.
Reading Capacitor Labels
There are many different schemes used for labeling capacitors. Some use color bands, 
and some use combinations of numbers and letters. Capacitors may be labeled with 
their capacitance value, tolerance, temperature coefficient, voltage rating, or some com-
bination of these specifications. Figure 3.66 shows several popular labeling systems.
3.6.9  Capacitor Applications
Coupling and DC Blocking
Coupling capacitors act to pass a range of ac signals from one circuit to another, 
while preventing any dc components from passing. This is due to the capacitor’s 

342    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 3.66

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    343
reactance—at dc the reactance is theoretically infinite, but at higher ac frequencies 
the reactance decreases. Effective coupling requires that the capacitor’s impedance 
be as low as possible at the frequency range of interest. If not, certain frequencies 
may become more attenuated than others. The formulas in Fig. 3.67 can be used 
to find the cutoff frequency, or −3- dB frequency (1⁄2 power point), attenuation, and 
phase shift, assuming ideal conditions and purely resistive load.
Note that in many situations, the load (or coupled stage) to which the capacitor 
is coupled may be frequency sensitive—its impedance may change with frequency 
due to inductive and capacitive elements. For example, Fig. 3.70 shows how the input 
impedance of a transistor amplifier changes with frequency. Since the selection of the 
coupling capacitor determines which frequencies get attenuated, understanding the 
changing impedance of the coupled stage is important.
The major characteristics to look at when selecting a coupling capacitor are insu-
lation resistance (IR), ESR, voltage rating, and overall frequency response. Consult 
Table 3.7 for suggested coupling capacitors. For example, for many audio applica-
tions, polypropylene and polyester film and even an electrolytic capacitor may be 
good choices, but for a high- frequency, high- stability decoupling application, up into 
the megahertz range, an NPO multilayer ceramic capacitor may be required.
Bypassing
Bypass capacitors are often used to bypass undesired alternating signals (supply rip-
ple, noise, etc.) around a component or group of components to ground. Often the ac 
FIGURE 3.67  Blocking: A capacitor is used to block or prevent dc voltages from passing from one 
circuit to another. To block the dc voltage, the capacitor is placed in series with the circuit element.
  Coupling: A coupling capacitor is used to couple or link together only the ac signal from one 
circuit element to another. The capacitor is connected in series between the input and the coupled 
load. Considering a purely resistive load, the attenuation and cutoff frequency (or -3- dB frequency)  
can be estimated by means of the formulas to the right. These formulas are based on an ideal 
 capacitor.

344    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is removed (or greatly attenuated) from the ac/dc mixture, leaving the dc free to feed 
the bypassed component. Figure 3.68 shows the basics behind bypassing.
As a general rule of thumb, the impedance of the bypass capacitor should be 
10 percent of the input impedance of the circuit element.
There are many types of capacitors used for bypassing, from electrolytic to  ceramic 
NPO. The one you choose will depend on the kind of frequency response and stability 
you require. Major characteristics to consider include insulation resistance (IR), ESL, 
and ESR.
Power Supply Decoupling (Bypassing)
Decoupling becomes very important in both digital and analog dc circuits. In these 
dc circuits, any slight variations in voltage within the circuit may cause improper 
operation. For example, in Fig. 3.69, noise (random fluctuations in supply voltage) 
present on the VCC line can cause problems by presenting improper voltage levels to 
an IC’s sensitive supply lead. (Some ICs will act erratically if this happens.) However, 
by placing a bypass capacitor in parallel to the IC’s input, the capacitor will bypass 
the high- frequency noise around the IC to ground, thus maintaining a steady dc voltage. 
The bypass capacitor acts to decouple the IC from the supply.
It’s important to note that variations within the supply voltage line aren’t caused 
just by random low- level fluctuations. They are also caused by sudden fluctua-
tions in voltage caused by high- current switching action that draws sudden, large 
amounts of current from the supply line. The more current these devices draw, the 
bigger the ripple in the supply line. Relay and motor switching is notorious in this 
regard. (Usually these devices incorporate a snubber diode or some type of local 
transient suppressor to limit the magnitude of the transient. However, low- level, 
high- frequency ringing that occurs after switching will often sneak into the line.) 
Even TTL and CMOS ICs can generate current spikes in the power lines, due to a 
In this circuit,the RC section acts like a low-
pass filter, which attenuates high frequencies 
from reaching the load or circuit element.
As XC < RL, signals bypass RL through C.
As XC > RL, signals pass through RL.
where XC = 1/(2πfC), the capacitor’s reactance. 
In other words, at high frequencies, XC gets 
small, so signals tend to be diverted around 
RL through C. 
  The graph in the figure shows the 
 attenuation versus frequency response, and 
the equations tell you how to calculate the 
cutoff frequency, attenuation, and phase 
shift.
  Note that the R in the circuit in this 
figure isn’t often physically present as a dis-
crete component. It may represent, say, the 
inherent resistance present in the power sup-
ply line (which is usually much smaller than 
what’s shown). Though R helps set the fre-
quency response, it can reduce the  clamping 
efficiency.
FIGURE 3.68

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    345
transient state in which both output transistors are simultaneously on. The resis-
tance between the 5- V supply terminals limits the supply current, and as speed 
increases this resistance gets smaller, and the transient currents increase to as high 
as 100 mA. These transient currents usually contain high frequencies due to the fast 
switching of the logic device. When the current spikes propagate down a power 
distribution system, they can develop 10- to 100- mV voltage spikes. Even worse, if 
an entire bus changes states, the effects are additive, resulting in transients as high 
as 500 mV propagating down the power lines. Such large transients wreak havoc 
within logic circuits.
It’s important to regard the power supply and the distribution systems (wires, PCB 
bus, etc.) as nonideal. The power supply contains internal resistance, and the sup-
ply distribution system (wires, PCB traces, etc.) contains small amounts of resistance, 
 inductance, and capacitance. Any sudden demands in current from a device attached to 
the distribution system will thus result in a voltage dip in the supply—use Ohm’s law.
SELECTING AND PLACING DECOUPLING CAPACITORS
What Needs Bypassing: High clock- rate logic circuits and other sensitive analog cir-
cuits all require decoupling of the power supplies. As a general rule of thumb, use 
one 0.1- µF ceramic per digital chip, two 0.1- µF ceramics per analog chip, (one on each 
supply where positive and negative supplies are used) and one 1- µF tantalum per 
every eight ICs or per IC row, though you can often do with less. Also, a good place 
for bypass capacitors is on power connectors. Anytime power lines are leading off 
to another board or long wire, it’s a good idea to throw in a bypass capacitor; long 
wires act like inductive antennas, picking up electrical noise from any magnetic field. 
A capacitor at both ends of the wire is a good idea—a 0.01- µF or 0.001- µF capacitor 
connected across the line will often do the trick.
FIGURE 3.69  The top circuit uses a 0.1- µF decoupling capacitor to keep the dc supply line free of high- 
frequency transients. The lower circuit uses three capacitors of different capacitance levels to handle a wide 
range of transient frequencies.

346    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Placement: Capacitor placement is crucial for good high- frequency decoupling. Place 
capacitors as close as possible to the IC, between power pin and ground pin, and 
ensure that leads consist of wide PC tracks. Run traces from device to capacitor, then 
to power planes. Capacitor lead lengths must be kept short (less than 1.5 mm); even 
a small amount of wire has considerable inductance, which can resonate with the 
capacitor. Surface- mount capacitors are excellent in this regard, since you can place 
them almost on top of the power leads, thus eliminating lead inductance.
Size of Capacitor: The frequency of the ripple has a role in choosing the capacitor 
value. A rule of thumb: the higher the frequency ripple, the smaller the bypass 
 capacitor. In Fig. 3.69, a 0.01-  to 0.1- µF capacitor with a self- resonant frequency 
from around 10 to 100 MHz is used to handle high- frequency transients. If you 
have very high- frequency components in your circuit, it might be worth using a 
pair of capacitors in parallel—one large value (say, 0.01 µF) and one small value 
(say, 100 pF). If there is a complex ripple, several bypass capacitors in parallel 
may be used, each one targeting a slightly different frequency. For example, in 
the lower circuit in Fig. 3.69, C1 (1 µF) catches the lower voltage dips that are rela-
tively low in frequency (associated with bus transients), C2 (0.1 µF) the midrange 
frequencies, and C3 (0.001 µF) the higher frequencies. In general, local decoupling 
values range from 100 pF to 1 µF. It’s generally not a good idea to place a large  
1- µF capacitor on each individual IC, except in critical cases; if there is less than 10 
cm of reasonably wide PC track between each IC and the capacitor, it’s possible to 
share it among several ICs.
Type of Capacitor: The type of capacitor used in decoupling is very important. 
Avoid capacitors with low ESR, high inductance, and high dissipation factor. For 
example, aluminum electrolytic capacitors are not a good choice for high- frequency 
decoupling. However, a 1- µF tantalum electrolytic, as mentioned before, is useful 
when decoupling at lower frequencies. Monolithic ceramic capacitors, especially 
FIGURE 3.70

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    347
When a capacitor is charged through a resis-
tor, its voltage follows a very predictable curve. 
By  applying the capacitor’s voltage to a level- 
sensitive input of an IC, the IC will trigger an out-
put response, once the voltage across the  capacitor 
reaches the set trigger level. For example, in the 
circuit in the figure, a 74HCT14 Schmitt inverter, 
along with an RC network, comprise a simple 
squarewave oscillator. Assuming the capaci-
tor is discharged, the inverter’s output is HIGH  
(+5 V). Current then passes through the  resistor 
and starts collecting as charge within the capaci-
tor. Once the capacitor reaches 1.7 V, the inverter 
interprets a HIGH input level, and sets the output 
LOW. C1 then begins discharging, and once its 
voltage reaches 0.9 V, the inverter interprets a 
LOW input level, and it again sets the output 
HIGH. The process continues. The frequency 
of oscillation is determined by the RC time 
constant. A smaller capacitance yields a higher 
frequency—it takes less time to charge up. Many 
different kinds of capacitors could be used, such 
as polypropylene, polyester, polystyrene (less 
than a few hundred kilohertz), and even electro-
lytic (at lower frequencies).
 surface- mount types, are an excellent choice for high- frequency decoupling due to 
their low ESL and good frequency response. Polyester and polypropylene capaci-
tors are also good choices, provided you keep lead lengths short. The capacitor you 
eventually choose will depend on the frequency range you’re trying to eliminate. See 
Table 3.7 for suggested decoupling capacitors.
3.6.10  Timing and Sample and Hold
To change the voltage across a capacitor, it takes a finite amount of time—a character-
istic dependent on the capacitance value and any added series resistance. The charg-
ing time, as well as the acquired voltage level, can easily be predicted, for example, 
by using the RC time constant. This phenomenon is put to use in timing circuits, such 
as oscillators, signal generators, and latch timers. An explanation of how a simple 
relaxation oscillator works is shown in Fig. 3.71.
In sample- and- hold circuits, a capacitor will acquire an analog voltage level equal 
to that which is taken during a sample (switch closed). The stored charge within the 
capacitor holds onto this voltage level until a new sample is taken. See the sample- 
and- hold circuits in Fig. 3.72.
In both timing and sample- and- hold circuits, important capacitor character-
istics to look for include high insulation resistance (IR), relatively low ESR, low 
dielectric absorption (DA), and good capacitance stability. Polystyrene capacitors 
with very high IR ratings are good in many timing and storage applications, except 
within timing circuits that exceed a few hundred kilohertz, where ESL  becomes 
a factor. Monolithic ceramic capacitors, though good at high frequencies, have 
 considerably high dielectric absorption, making them unsuitable for sample- and- hold 
FIGURE 3.71
Simple Relaxation Oscillator

348    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
 applications. Other capacitors often used in both cases include polypropylene and 
polyester, both of which have good IR ratings. In low- frequency relaxation- type 
oscillators and latch timers, electrolytic capacitors are often used, but they should 
not be used for sample- and- hold circuits; their leakage levels are too high to hold a 
constant sample voltage.
3.6.11  RC Ripple Filter
The full- wave rectifier dc supply, shown in Fig. 3.73, uses a capacitor to smooth out 
the rectified dc pulses in order to create a near constant dc output. The capacitor 
stores charge and delivers it to the load when the rectified or pulsing dc voltage 
 decreases below its peak value. However, as it does this, the voltage drops according 
to the RLC time constant, until the capacitor recharges during another positive cycle. 
The resultant output voltage therefore takes on a small ac ripple. Since ripple is usu-
ally bad when driving sensitive circuits, it’s important to keep it as low as possible 
by using a large capacitance value. Figure 3.74 shows how to derive and calculate the 
ripple voltage, average dc voltage, and ripple factor, given the input frequency, aver-
age dc rectified voltage, capacitance, and load resistance.
The ripple factor represents the maximum variation in output voltage (in rms) 
per the average dc output voltage. A typical and practical ripple factor to shoot 
for is usually around 0.05. Large capacitance values are desired to keep RF low—
typically 1000 µF or more. Increasing the load resistance (decreasing load current) 
will also keep it down. To achieve higher capacitance levels, place filter capacitors 
in parallel.
Note that many times you’ll probably include a voltage regulator IC between 
the filter capacitor and load to combat ac- line surges and maintain a constant 
 output voltage with changing load- current demands. These regulators typically 
Sample- and- hold circuits are used to sample an 
analog signal and hold it so that it can be analyzed 
or converted into, say, a digital signal at one’s lei-
sure. In the first circuit, a switch acts as a sample/
hold control. Sampling begins when the switch is 
closed and ends when the switch is opened. When 
the switch is opened, the input voltage present at 
that exact moment will be stored in C. The op amp 
acts as a buffer, relaying the capacitor’s voltage to 
the output, but preventing the capacitor from dis-
charging (ideally, no current enters the input of 
an op amp). The length of the sample voltage that 
can be held varies, depending on the capacitor’s 
leakage. Use capacitors with high ESR, low DA, 
low ESL, and high stability. See text.
  The LF398 is a special sample- and- hold IC 
whose control of sample- and- hold functions is 
enacted by a digital input signal. An external 
 capacitor is still needed, however, to hold the 
sample voltage.
Sample- and- Hold Circuits

have  additional built- in ripple rejection. See the chapter on voltage regulators and 
power supplies.
Important capacitor characteristics to consider in power supply filtering  include 
ESR, voltage, and ripple current ratings. In most power supplies, the filtering capaci-
tors are electrolytic, since most other types can’t supply the necessary microfarads. In 
some high- voltage, high- current supplies, oil- filled capacitors may be used.
FIGURE 3.73  Here, a 1000- µF capacitor supply filter is used to reduce the output ripple voltage. With 
a 100- Ω load, the ripple voltage in this circuit is 0.34 VAC, or 1.17 V peak to peak. The ripple factor 
(rms ripple voltage divided by average dc voltage) is 0.00251. If we replaced the full- wave bridge with 
a half- wave rectifier, the ripple voltage would be twice as large. See equations in Fig. 3.74 and Problem 
7 at the end of this chapter.

Speaker Crossover Network
3.6.12  Arc Suppression
There are two types of discharge that can damage switching contacts and gener-
ate noise in the process. The first is glow discharges, caused by the ignition of gases 
 between contacts. These develop at around 320 V with about a 0.0003- in gap, and can 
be sustained at a much wider gap range. The other type of discharge is arc discharge, 
occurring at much smaller voltages, about 0.5 MV/cm. Minimum voltages and cur-
rent are required for arc discharges to be sustained. Contact material also plays a role 
in sustained arc discharges (see table in Fig. 3.77).
The main cause of discharge or arcing is the sudden switching off of an induc-
tive load, such as a relay, motor, solenoid, or transformer. These inductive loads do 
not instantly let go of a current. At the instant a contact opens, the current through 
the contact does not want to change. When the switch is closed, the resistance is 
essentially zero, making the voltage zero, too. As the contact opens, the resistance 
increases, which leads to a high voltage that leads to the arcing or discharge effect 
across the contacts, usually destructive to contact life—it promotes contact erosion. 
See Fig. 3.77.
The role of the RC network, or snubber, is to keep the voltage across the contacts be-
low 300 V, while keeping the rate of voltage change below 1 V/µs, as well as keeping 
the current below the minimum current levels specified for a particular switch contact 
material. See the table in Fig. 3.77. The capacitor acts to absorb the instantaneous volt-
age change. When the contacts are closed, the capacitor  doesn’t play a role. As the 
contacts open, any change in voltage is restricted by the capacitor if its value is large 
enough to restrict the voltage change to less than 1 V/µs. However, a capacitor alone is 
not a good idea. When the contacts are opened, the capacitor charges up to the  supply 
FIGURE 3.75  Crossover networks are used to provide each speaker in a 
system a range of frequencies most responsive to a given speaker’s dynamic 
range. For example, the circuit in the figure is a simple first- order crossover 
for a system including a tweeter (high- frequency dynamic) and woofer 
(low- frequency dynamic). To divert only high frequencies to the tweeter, a 
capacitor is placed in series with the tweeter, where the internal resistance 
of the tweeter and the capacitance form a high- pass RC circuit. A low- pass 
filter is used to pass low frequencies to the woofer. It uses an inductor in 
series with the woofer’s resistance. The response curves and formulas for 
calculating the cutoff frequency for each filter are provided to the right in 
the figure. Some popular crossover capacitors include polypropylene, poly-
ester, and metallized- film capacitors.

Active Filters
FIGURE 3.76  With the help of op amps, low- pass, high- pass, bandpass, and notch filters can be created with gain, if 
desired. Such filters are called active filters, since they have an active element (op amp), as opposed to being passive 
(no additional power source). The circuits in the figure are low- pass and high- pass active filters suitable for audio applica-
tions. The gain and desired cutoff frequency (-3 dB) can be obtained by using the provided formulas to calculate the com-
ponent values. Polyester, polypropylene film, and metallized capacitors are good in filters at audio ranges.

352    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
voltage. As the contacts close, an inrush of current results, limited only by residual 
resistance, and damage may still result. For this reason, a resistor is connected in series 
with the capacitor. The voltage across the contacts when opened is equal to the load 
current × resistance (V = IR). It is recommended that V ≤ supply voltage. In this case, 
the maximum resistance of the network will be equal to the load resistance.
Usually a 0.1- to 1- µF polypropylene film/foil or metallized- film capacitor with 
a voltage rating from 200 to 630 V will work for most applications. A carbon 22-  to 
1000- Ω, 1⁄4- to 2- W capacitor is usually used for the resistance—the size and watt-
age depend on the load conditions. (In high- voltage applications, oil- filled capacitors 
with voltage ratings in the kilovolts are often used.) You can avoid building your own 
RC networks by simply buying prefab versions from the manufacturer.
Note that often shunt resistors, diodes, and gas discharge valves, along with vari-
ous transient suppressor devices, can also be used to suppress arcing. However, some 
advantages RC networks have over these devices include bipolar operation suitable 
for ac application, relay operating time not very much affected, and no current con-
sumption; electromagnetic interference suppression is also achieved (high- frequency 
EMI is present within the chaotic discharging sparks, but becomes dampened by the 
RC network).
In some ac circuits it may be necessary to connect the RC network across the load. 
For example, with ac relays, the relay contacts can also suffer from mechanical and 
electrical erosion due to arcing when subject to inductive spikes caused by sudden 
switching. Though diodes are used to suppress transients generated by dc relays, 
they cannot be used with ac relays due to the ac source’s dual polarity. The rightmost 
circuit in Fig. 3.77 shows an RC network connected across the ac relay to reduce arc-
ing effects.
3.6.13  Supercapacitor Applications
The extremely high capacitance levels and low leakage rates of supercapacitors make 
them nifty devices in many low- energy supplies that require recharging in mere seconds. 
Many interesting solar- power circuits can be made, such as light- seeking robots that use 
solar energy stored in a supercapacitor to drive small motors. Usually in these circuits 
special energy- saving modulating circuits are used to pulse the motor in order to con-
serve energy. Figure 3.78 shows a few simple supercapacitor circuits to get you started.

The circuit at the top in the figure uses a super-
capacitor to store charge from a solar panel over 
time. The larger the capacitance, the more charge 
that can be stored and the more current that can be 
delivered to a load. Here, a simple flashing LED 
(FLED) is used as a nighttime beacon, getting its 
power from the supercapacitor charged during the 
day. Assuming the solar panel has fully charged C 
if C = 0.047 F, then FLED flashes for around 10 min 
when the light is removed or the switch is opened. 
If C = 1.5 F, then FLED flashes for hours. There 
are a number of other cool solar- powered circuits 
you can make, such as solar- powered engines and 
backup supplies. Though the circuitry is a bit more 
complex, they all basically use the same principle 
of energy storage shown here.
  The second circuit is similar to the first, except 
now there is a phototransistor Q1 that keeps tran-
sistor Q2 off if exterior light exists. This prevents 
the supercapacitor C1 from discharging unless it’s 
dark. When it’s dark, Q1 turns off and Q2 turns 
on, providing approximately 10 s of illumination 
for one 40- mA, 1.5- V lamp. This can be used for 
short- term nightlights, for mailboxes, or near home 
entrances. This is a good circuit to avoid the hassle 
of dealing with dead batteries.
  The circuit at the bottom uses a supercapacitor as 
a power backup for a battery (or a dc power source 
with current- limiting protection). As with the previ-
ous circuit, energy is stored in the  supercapacitor; 
however, now a current- limiting regulator sec-
tion is added to limit the current delivered to the 
supercapacitor when the power is first applied to 
the circuit. Thus, the supercapacitor can charge up 
without imposing a high current load on the bat-
tery. The MOSFET must be rated to dissipate the 
heat generated during the charging phase. This is 
a one- off event each time the device is turned on, 
which lasts only a few seconds, so the MOSFET 
 doesn’t have to be rated to dissipate that amount 
of power continuously.

Problem 3: If a 100- µF capacitor in a high- voltage power supply is shunted by a

discharged when power is turned off?
Answer: 50 s. Hint: After five time constants, a capacitor is considered discharged.
Problem 4: An IC uses an external RC charging network to control its timing. To

Answer: Vdc = 12.92 V, Vr(pp) = 2.35 V, Vr(rms) = 0.68 VAC, ripple factor = 0.0526, percent 
ripple = 5.26%. See Fig. 3.74.
3.7  Inductors
Problem 7: For the half- wave rectifier supply shown in Fig. 3.82, find the average dc 
output voltage, the peak- to- peak ripple voltage, the rms ripple voltage, the ripple 
factor, and percent ripple.
The basic role of an inductor is to prevent any sudden changes in current from flow-
ing through it. (Refer to Sec. 2.24 for the details of how this works.) Under ac con-
ditions, an inductor’s impedance (reactance) increases with frequency; an inductor 
acts to block high- frequency signals while allowing low- frequency signals to pass 
through it. By selecting the proper inductance value, it is possible to create high- 
frequency chokes (e.g., RF/EMI chokes) that, when placed in series with power or 
signal paths, will prevent RF (radiofrequency) or EMI (electromagnetic interference) 
from entering into the main circuit, where they could introduce undesired hum and 
false triggering effects.
Filter networks can be created when inductors are used alongside other 
 com ponents such as resistors and capacitors. For example, Fig. 3.84a and b show 
FIGURE 3.82
FIGURE 3.83

356    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 3.84
low- pass and high- pass filters using an inductor as the reactive element. In the low- 
pass filter, the inductor “chokes” out the high- frequency components, while in 
the high- pass filter the inductor passes the low- frequency components to ground—
high- frequency components are prevented from taking the same path and follow 
the signal path. Series- resonant (bandpass) and parallel- resonant (notch) filters are 
shown in Figs. 3.84c and d. Parallel- resonant filters are used in oscillator circuits to 
eliminate, from an amplifier, any input frequencies significantly different from the 
resonant frequency of the LC filter. Such circuits are often used to generate radio-
frequency carrier signals for transmitters. Resonant filters also act as tuned circuits 
used in radio reception. 
The energy storage nature of an inductor can be utilized in switching power 
supplies. For example, in Fig. 3.84e, a step- up switching regulator or “boost con-
verter” is used to increase a 5- V input voltage to a 12- V output voltage. When 
the control element (transistor) is on, energy is stored in the inductor. The load, 
isolated by the diode, is supplied by the charge stored in the capacitor. When the 
control element is off, the energy stored in the inductor is added to the input volt-
age. At this time, the inductor supplies load current as well as restoring charge 
to the capacitor. Other converter configurations include step- down and inverting 
switching regulators.
A heavily wound, iron core inductor can be used as an electromagnet, capable 
of attracting steel and other ferromagnetic materials. A solenoid is an electromagnet 
that has a mechanical mechanism that is pulled when the solenoid is energized by 
current. The movement mechanism may involve latching or unlatching a door, or 
opening or closing a valve (i.e., a solenoid valve), or making or breaking switch con-
tacts (as in an electrical relay).
Coupled inductors that share magnetic flux linkage are used to create transformers—
devices that utilize mutual inductance to step up or step down ac voltages and 
currents.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    357
3.7.1  Inductance
The voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate at which the current 
 changes. The relationship between voltage and current are described by the  following 
 equations:

The proportionality constant L is the inductance, which depends on a number of 
physical parameters, such as coil shape, number of turns, and core makeup. The basic 
unit of inductance is the henry, abbreviated H. One henry equals an induced voltage 
of 1 V when the current is varying at a rate of 1 A/s:

Typical values of inductance for commercial inductors vary from a few nanohenrys 
for small air core inductors to 50 H for large iron core inductors.
3.7.2  Constructing Inductors
Although constructing a capacitor from scratch is rare and usually unnecessary, con-
structing an inductor from scratch is quite common. Often it is necessary, since spe-
cific inductance values may be difficult to find or overly expensive in commercial 
units. Even stock inductors often require trimming to match an accurately desired 
value. Figure 3.85 shows some formulas used to construct inductors. Refer to 
Sec. 2.24 to see example calculations.
3.7.3  Inductors in Series and Parallel
When two or more inductors are connected in series, the total inductance is equal to 
the sum of the individual inductances, provided the coils are sufficiently separated 
so that coils are not in the magnetic field of one another:
 
LTOT = L1 + L2 + L3 + … + LN  (Inductor in series)

358    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 3.85

total inductance is given by:

When only two inductors are in parallel, the formula simplifies to LTOT = (L1 × L2)/ 
(L1 + L2). Refer to Sec. 2.24 to see how these formulas were derived.
3.7.4  RL Time Constant
When a resistor is placed in series with an inductor, the resistance controls the rate at 
which energy is pumped into the magnetic field of an inductor (or pumped back into 
the circuit when the field collapses). Figure 3.87 shows energizing and deenergizing 
RL circuits with corresponding current- versus- time response curves.
In the energizing RL circuit, the inductor current and voltage as a function of time 
after the switch is thrown to the up position is given by the following equation:

The time in seconds required for current to build up to 63.2 percent of the maximum 
value is called the time constant τ, which is equal to L/R. After five time constants, 
the current is considered to have reached its maximum value.
For a deenergizing RL circuit, things are a bit tricky. However, if we assume when 
we remove the applied voltage that there is no break in the circuit by moving the dis-
charge to the ground, we can apply the following deenergizing equations:
 
I t

It takes one time constant τ = L/R for the inductor to lose 63.2 percent of its initial 
current value. After five time constants, the current is considered to have reached its 
minimum value.
The deenergizing RL circuit requires special attention. In real life, when the cur-
rent flow through an inductor is suddenly interrupted—say, by flipping a switch—
there can be a very large induced voltage generated as the inductor’s magnetic field 
rapidly collapses. The magnitude of the induced voltage can be so great that “elec-
tron pressure” at the switch contacts overcomes the work function of the metal, and 
a spark may jump between the contacts. Section 2.24 describes inductive spikes in 
greater detail.
3.7.5  Inductive Reactance
An inductor has a frequency- sensitive impedance, or inductive reactance, that 
 increases with applied frequency. Unlike resistance, the inductive reactance 
 doesn’t dissipate energy in the form of heat, but temporarily stores energy in a 
magnetic field and later returns it (or reflects it back) to the source. Inductive reac-
tance has units of ohms, and it increases with frequency according to the following  
equation:
 
XL = 2πfL  (Inductive reactance)
For example, a 1- H coil with an applied frequency of 60 Hz will provide 377 Ω of 
reactance, while a 10- µH inductor at 20 MHz will provide 1257 Ω of reactance.
Note that the preceding equation is for an ideal inductor. Real inductors have 
imperfections, such as internal resistance and capacitance that tend to cause the 
reactance to deviate from the equation, especially at higher frequencies—see 
Sec. 2.24.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    361
3.7.6  Real Inductors
There are many different kinds of inductors used for various applications. 
 Selecting the right inductor requires understanding the nonideal characteristics 
of real inductors. Real inductors have imperfections, such as internal resistance 
and  capacitance, that make them operate slightly differently than the ideal equa-
tions predict. Some inductors, due to their construction, may have larger resistive 
or capacitive components inherent in their design that can cause the inductor to 
act in a nonlinear fashion when approaching certain frequencies. (See Sec. 2.24 
for details.) Other important differences include current- handling capacity, toler-
ance, maximum inductance and size, quality factor (Q), saturation characteristics, 
adjustability, radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI), and environmental 
 endurance.
The following provides important inductor specifications that you’ll find listed in 
manufacturer data sheets.
3.7.7  Inductor Specifications
Inductance (L): The property of an element that tends to oppose any change in the 
current flowing through it. The inductance depends on core material, core shape, 
size, and turn count of the coil. The unit of inductance is the henry (H). Most 
 often, inductances are expressed in microhenries (µH).
1 henry (H) = 106 µF
1 millihenry (mH) = 103 µH
1 nanohenry (nH) = 10−3 µH
Inductive tolerance: Inductive tolerance is the allowed amount of variation from the 
nominal value specified by the manufacturer. Standard inductance tolerances are 
typically designated by a tolerance letter: F = ±1%, G = ±2%, H = ±3%, J = ±5%, 
K = ±10%, L = ±15% (some military products L = ±20%), M = ±20%.
Direct current resistance (DCR): The resistance of the inductor winding measured 
 using dc current. The DCR is most often minimized in the design of an inductor 
and specified as a maximum rating.
Incremental current: The dc bias current flowing through an inductor that causes an 
inductance drop of 5 percent from the initial zero dc bias inductance value. This 
current level indicates where the inductance can be expected to drop significantly 
FIGURE 3.88

362    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
if the dc bias current is increased further. This applies mostly to ferrite cores rather 
than to powdered iron. Powdered iron cores exhibit soft saturation characteristics, 
which means their inductance drop from higher dc levels is much more gradual 
than that of ferrite cores. The rate at which the inductance will drop is also a func-
tion of the core shape.
Maximum dc current (IDC): The level of continuous direct current that can be passed 
through an inductor with no damage. The dc current level is based on a maximum 
temperature rise at the maximum rated ambient temperature. For low- frequency 
currents, the RMS current can be substituted for the dc- rated current.
Saturation current: The dc bias current flowing through an inductor that causes the 
inductance to drop by a specified amount from the initial zero dc bias inductance 
value. Common specified inductance drop percentages are 10 percent and 20 per-
cent. It is useful to use the 10 percent inductance drop value for ferrite cores and 
20 percent for powdered iron cores in energy storage applications. The cause of 
the inductance drop due to the dc bias current is related to the magnetic proper-
ties of the core. The core, and some of the space around the core, can store only a 
given amount of magnetic flux density. Beyond the maximum flux density point, 
the permeability of the core is reduced; thus, the inductance drops. Core satura-
tion does not apply to air core inductors.
Self- resonant frequency (SRF or f0): The frequency at which the inductor’s distributed 
capacitance resonates with the inductance. At this frequency, the inductance is 
equal to the capacitance and they cancel each other. As a consequence, at SRF, the 
inductor acts as a purely resistive high- impedance element. Also at this frequency, 
the Q value of the inductor is zero. Distributed capacitance is caused by the turns 
of wire layered on top of each other and around the core. This capacitance is in 
parallel to the inductance. At frequencies above SRF, the capacitive reactance of 
the parallel combination will become the dominant component.
Quality factor (Q): The measure of the relative losses in the inductor. Q is defined as 
the ratio of inductive reactance to the effective resistance, or XL/RE. Since both XL 
and RE are functions of frequency, the test frequency must be given when specify-
ing Q. As the self- resonant frequency, Q is zero since the inductance is zero at that 
point. Ideally, Q = XL/RDC = 2πf L/RDC.
Inductance temperature coefficient: The change in inductance per unit temperature change. 
Measured under zero bias condition and expressed in parts per million (ppm).
Resistance temperature coefficient: The change in dc wire resistance per unit tempera-
ture change. Measured low dc bias (<1 VDC) and expressed in parts per million 
(ppm).
Curie temperature (TC): The temperature beyond which the core material loses its 
magnetic properties.
Magnetic saturation flux density (BSAT): A core parameter that indicates the maximum 
flux the material can be induced to hold. At this value of flux density, all magnetic 
domains within the core are magnetized and aligned.

3.7.8  Types of Inductors
There are many different inductors out there. Some inductors are designed for 
general- purpose filtering, others for RF/EMI filtering, others for high- current choking, 
and still others for energy storage (in switching power supplies). Typically, manufacturers  
break down their inductor stock into the following categories: common- mode, 
general- purpose, high- current, high- frequency, power, and RF chokes. Fundamental 
specifications for selection include inductance value, dc- rated current, dc resistance, 
tolerance, and quality factor (Q). Table 3.8 provides a general overview matching 
inductance characteristics to specified application.

Used predominantly in high- 
density PCB surface- mount circuits 
where size, interboard magnetic 
coupling, and vibration are major 
concerns. They have fewer para-
sitic characteristics and less resis-
tive loss when compared to most 
other leaded inductors. Come 
with excellent Q values, and high- 
frequency performance, while 
generating very little noise. Smaller 
boards and shorter traces also 
reduce EMI emissions and signal 
cross- coupling. Come in various 
current ratings.
Used for EMI/RFI attenuation and 
suppression, as well as reactive 
elements in LC resonant oscilla-
tors and impedance- matching 
networks, and other choke- coil 
type applications. They are found 
in A/D converters, bandpass filters, 
pulse generators, RF amplifiers, 
signal generators, switching power 
supplies, and telecom.
Molded inductors
Small with axial leads for PC board 
mounting. Outer coating protects 
coil from the environment. Comes 
in a shielded version as well. Fre-
quency range is typically greater 
than 50 kHz.
Used in filters, AD converters, AM/
FM radio, pulse generators, signal 
generators, switching power sup-
plies, and telecom.
Shielded inductors
The magnetic shield is designed 
to prevent magnetic coupling and 
RF/EMI interference issues—espe-
cially important in densely packed 
boards where signal corruption is 
a major concern. Come in surface- 
mount, axial lead, and other 
configurations and a variety of 
current- handling ratings.
Used in high- reliability  applications 
where magnetic coupling is to 
be avoided. Used for dc/dc 
 converters, computers, telecom 
equipment, filters, LDC displays, 
etc.
Conformal coated  
(dipped) inductors
An inexpensive inductor that 
comes with axial or radial leads—
similar to molded inductors. Outer 
coating protects inductor from 
environments
Typically used in less harsh envi-
ronments than molded inductors. 
Usually used in less critical RFI/EMI 
applications. Higher-Q versions 
can be used in many of the same 
applications as molded inductors.
Table 3.9 provides a selection guide to help determine what kind of inductor to 
use for a particular application. For in- depth details about specific inductors, check 
out manufacturers’ websites and read through their data sheets. (Some noteworthy

High-current chokes
Hash choke
RF choke
These devices utilize ferrite or pow-
dered iron cores to achieve large 
inductance values for low coil 
count and small volume. Fewer 
turns translates into lower dc resis-
tance—an important feature for 
high- current applications.
High- current hash chokes are used 
for home appliances, communica-
tions systems, computer add- ons, 
dc- fc, switching power supplies, 
transmitters, and uninterrupted 
power supplies. Power line chokes 
are used for filters, power supplies, 
RFI suppression, power amps, 
switching regulators, SCR and Triac 
controls, and speaker crossover 
networks.
Wideband chokes
Wideband chokes attenuate 
 unwanted signals in circuits 
 without contributing to power 
losses at lower frequencies or dc. 
Impedances range from 20 to 
500 Ω and are obtained over 
frequencies from 1.0 to 400 MHz. 
Currents are limited only by #22 or 
#24 AWG tinned copper wire used 
in construction.
Used mainly in PC boards to filter 
out EMI and RFI. Also used in RF 
circuits to suppress parasitic oscil-
lation at VHF and UHF. Used in 
A/D converters, communications 
systems, computer add- ons, dc- fc, 
I/O boards, RF power amplifiers, 
signal generators, switching power 
supplies, telecom equipment, and 
uninterrupted power supplies.
Toroids
Exhibit high inductance due to 
powdered iron or ferrite core, and 
also display good self- shielding 
due to core shape (good low EMI 
source). Low coil count reduces 
dc resistance compared to other 
solenoid- wound inductors. Come 
in a variety of types: small surface- 
mount devices, larger general- 
purpose devices, and high- power 
toroids that can handle very large 
currents. Toroids are also less 
susceptible to induced noise from 
other components, as the applied 
magnetic field induces equal and 
opposite currents inside the toroid, 
thus canceling interference
Toroids are used in a variety of dif-
ferent applications. They are used 
as chokes in ac power lines and 
to reduce EMI. Also used in home 
appliances, audio generators, 
auto electronics, bandpass filters, 
audiovisual equipment, dc- fc, I/O 
boards, impedance match trans-
formers, oscillators, pulse genera-
tors, switching power supplies, 
telecom equipment, transmitters, 
tuned amplifiers,  uninterrupted 
power supplies, VHF/UHF 
 repeaters, ripple filters, etc.
Pot cores
Provide ultra- high inductance 
values and high dc current ratings 
while maintaining a stable induc-
tance due to high saturation cur-
rents and self- shielding. Excellent 
Q values in a small size.
Commonly used in telecom,  audio, 
and automotive  applications. 
Used as dc chokes,  differential 
mode chokes, filters, and in switch-
ing circuits.

applications requiring high-Q 
characteristics, where losses and 
distortion (common in magnetic 
core inductors due to hysteresis 
and eddy currents) cannot be tol-
erated. Without a magnetic core, 
however, these inductors have low 
inductance values. Used primarily 
for RF applications. Surface- mount 
air coil are also available.
Used in RF resonant tank circuits 
for TV tuners, FM stereo receiv-
ers, garage door openers, pulse 
generators, RF power amplifiers, 
switching power supplies, RC toys, 
uninterrupted power supplies, and 
walkie- talkies.
Adjustable inductors  
(variable or tunable)
May use a slider contact along 
coils or, more commonly, a fer-
rite, powered iron, or brass slug 
screwed into the center of the 
coil. The inductance changes 
as the slug is screwed in and 
out of the coil. Magnetic cores 
increase the permeability or induc-
tance, while brass slugs decrease 
inductance due to eddy current 
induction in a slug that reduces 
internal magnetic flux in the core. 
These devices are used to adjust 
resonant circuits that require high 
Q values. Used in circuits requiring 
very narrow bandwidths.
Typically used at frequencies 
above 50 kHz. Used in LC reso-
nant tank circuits in AM/FM radio, 
TV, and other communication 
 systems. Used in garage door 
openers, I/O boards, oscillators, 
pulse generators, RF power ampli-
fiers, signal generators, switching 
power  supplies, toys, transmitters, 
 uninterrupted power supplies, 
VHF/UHF repeaters, and walkie- 
talkies.
Common-mode chokes
Common- and differential- mode 
chokes are used to eliminate noise 
on a pair of conductors. Common- 
mode noise is defined as noise 
that is present in or common to 
both conductors, and can be the 
result of induced noise caused by 
the antenna effect on a conduc-
tor or PC trace. Used to prevent 
EMI and RF interference from 
power supply lines and for preven-
tion of malfunctioning of elec-
tronic equipment. Common- mode 
chokes usually have ferrite core 
material well suited to attenuate 
common- mode current.
Common- mode chokes are very 
useful devices found in many  
radio circuits. They may help 
 nearly any interference problem, 
from cable TV to telephones to 
audio interference caused by 
RF picked up on speaker leads. 
Particularly well- suited for applica-
tions such as line filters in switch- 
mode power supplies, and are 
also commonly used in desktop 
computers, industrial electronics, 
office equipment, and consumer 
electronics such as TVs and audio 
equipment.

3.7.9  Reading Inductor Labels
If you are lucky, the inductance value and tolerance will be printed on your inductor 
in an easy- to- read format (e.g., 82 µH ± 10%). However, many molded and dipped 
inductors come with a band color code. For smaller surface- mount inductors, a spe-
cial shorthand printed code provides the inductance value and tolerance—see 
Fig. 3.90.
TABLE 3.9  Inductor Selection Guide
INDUCTOR TYPE
DESCRIPTION
APPLICATION
Ferrite beads (ferrite chokes)
Unlike a typical core inductor, the 
bead requires no coiling of wire—
though wire/cable from a circuit 
may be coiled around it or simply 
pass through it. This effectively 
increases the inductance of the 
wire (or wires). The inductance 
range is rather limited to RF. Used 
for removing RF energy that exists 
within a transmission line structure 
(PCB trace). To remove unwanted 
RF energy, chip beads are used as 
high- frequency resistors (attenu-
ators) that allow dc to pass while 
absorbing RF energy and dissipat-
ing it as heat. Come in hollow and 
leaded core versions.
Ferrite beads are often slipped 
over cables that radiate RF (com-
puters, dimmers, fluorescent lights, 
motors, etc.). Ferrite beads are 
also placed on cables entering 
receiving equipment to prevent 
external RF from entering and 
contaminating signals in the cable 
runs. The “bumps” on computer 
and appliance cables (mouse, 
keyboard, monitor, etc.) are usu-
ally a ferrite bead coated by the 
plastic cord coating.
Ceramic core inductor
These inductors use a special 
ceramic core that surpasses many 
ferrite- core- type inductors in terms 
of high- frequency operation, low 
IDC, high SRF, high Q, and tight 
tolerances.
Used in LC resonant circuits 
such as oscillators and signal 
 generators. Used in impedance 
matching, circuit isolation, and RF 
filtration. Found in mobile phones, 
Bluetooth devices, wireless instru-
ments, as well as audio, TV, and 
telecom devices.
Antenna rods ferrite core
Phenolic core
Commonly used in antenna appli-
cations where narrow bandwidths 
are required. The core material, or 
“rod,” on which the coil is wound 
is either ferrite, powered iron, or, 
alternatively, phenolic (essentially 
an air core). The magnetic core 
versions are far more popular, but 
the phenolic cores provide higher 
operating frequencies.
As antennas, ferrite cores with 800 
permeability rods are suitable in  
100- kHz to 1- MHz range. The 125 
permeability rods are suitable in 
the 550- kHz to 1.6- MHz range. The 
40 permeability rods are suitable 
in the 30- MHz range. The 20 per-
meability rods are suitable in the 
150- MHz range. As the core’s per-
meability decreases, the operating 
frequency increases.
Current sense inductor
Used to sense current passing 
through conductors. Specified by 
frequency range. Often come with 
a center tap.
Used in high- current, low- profile 
point of load (POL) converters,  
dc/dc converters in distributed 
power systems, and dc/dc con-
verters for field- programmable 
gate arrays. Found in PDAs, 
notebooks, desktops, servers, and 
battery- powered devices.

Filter Circuits
FIGURE 3.91  Filters offer little opposition to certain frequencies while blocking others. In (a), a low- pass filter is con-
structed using a resistor and inductor. The inductor’s impedance increases with frequency, thus preventing high- frequency 
signals from passing. In (b), a high- pass filter blocks low frequencies—the inductor acts as a low- impedance path to 
ground for low- frequency signals. (c) shows a bandpass filter, allowing only a very narrow band of frequencies through. 
See Chap. 2 for the theory. (d) shows a low- pass filter used with a speaker. (e) shows a differential- mode high- pass filter

fective against common- mode signals, however. (f) shows an ac- line filter used to filter RF energy from power lines.

Switching Regulators
FIGURE 3.92  In switching regulator applications, an inductor is used as an 
 energy storage device, when the semiconductor switch is on, the current in the 
inductor ramps up and energy is stored. When the switch is turned off, the 
stored energy is released into the load. Output voltages have a ripple that must 
be minimized by selecting appropriate inductance and output capacitor values.  
Figure  3.92a, b, and c shows various switching regulator configurations: buck 
 (lower output voltage), boost (higher output voltage), and buck- boost (opposite 
polarity). Note that in the boost converter, the boost inductor current does not 
continuously flow to the load. During the switch “on” period, the inductor cur-
rent flows to ground and the load current is supplied from the output capacitor.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    371
FIGURE 3.93  (a) An amplifier with positive feedback can be made to produce 
an output even in the absence of any input. Such circuits are called oscillators. 
In (a), an operational amplifier uses an LC resonant filter that eliminates from 
the amplifier input any frequencies significantly different from the LC resonant 
filter’s resonant frequency: f

 The amplifier is alternately driven to 
saturation in the positive and negative direction, so it produces a squarewave at 
V2. This squarewave has a Fourier component that is fed back to the noninverting 
input through resistor R in order to keep the oscillation from damping out. A sine 
wave is generated at V1.
  (b) There are two basic types of LC oscillators, Colpits and Hartley. The 
Colpits uses two capacitors, as shown here. It is generally favored over the 
Hartley, shown in (c), because of the simplicity of requiring only one inductor, 
which is usually more expensive and difficult to obtain than capacitors C1 and C2. 
The frequency of the Colpits oscillator is given by the formula in (b).
See Chap. 10 on oscillators for more details.
Oscillators

372    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Radio Circuits
Here are a few simple radiofrequency circuits 
that make use of LC resonant filters to tune 
the circuits.
  (a) The simplest radio receiver consists of 
nothing more than an antenna, a diode (ger-
manium), and a pair of headphones. Such a  
receiver has no frequency selectivity, how-
ever, and will receive several of the strongest 
AM broadcast stations simultaneously. By 
adding a variable inductor that forms a reso-
nant LC circuit with the antenna capacitance, 
a usable radio receiver can be constructed 
that is capable of tuning in to a number of 
different stations. (The variable capacitor 
provides additional tunability.) The encoded 
audio signal within the AM carrier is demod-
ulated by the diode (the diode generates low- 
frequency [audio] Fourier components that 
are absent in the transmitted wave). After 
passing through the diode, only the positive 
half of the wave remains. This wave contains 
low- frequency components in addition to 
components at the frequency of the carrier 
wave. With the addition of a low- pass filter, 
only the  low- frequency components  remain. 
The frequency response of headphones and of 
a human ear will effectively act as a  low- pass 
filter. The demodulated signal can be input 
into an amplifier to drive a speaker—see 
amplifier  circuit. Real radio AM receivers are 
much more sophisticated than this, using a 
superheterodyne design scheme.
  (b) A radio transmitter consists of an RF 
oscillator, one or more amplifier stages, and 
a modulator. In the simple FM transmitter 
shown here, the LC resonant filter sets the 
amplifier oscillatory frequency—the variable 
capacitor allows for adjustability. Audio sig-
nals that enter will be frequency- modulated 
into the carrier and radiated as radio waves. 
An FM radio receiver should be able to pick 
up the circuit signal. A homemade inductor 
can be made by tightly winding 10 turns of 
22- gauge wire around a 1⁄4- in form.

3.7.11  EMI/EMC Design Tips
The following are some tips to avoid EMI and EMC problems. Tips include proper 
design techniques for PCB layout, proper power supply considerations, and effective 
use of filtering components. (Referenced letters that follow refer to Fig. 3.95.)
PCB Design Tips
Avoid slit apertures in PCB layout, such as a ground plane that is divided into two 
parts. Regions of high impedance are sources of high EMI, so use wide tracks for 
power lines on the trace sides for increased conduction. Make signal tracks stripline 
(ground planes above and below) and include ground plane and power plane when-
ever possible. Keep HF and RF tracks short and lay out the HF tracks first—see (a). In 
Fig. 3.95. Avoid track stubs, since they cause reflections and harmonics—see (b). Use a 
surrounding guard ring and ground fill where possible on sensitive components and 
terminations. A guard ring around trace layers reduces emission out of board. Like-
wise, connect to ground only at a single point—see (e). Keep separate power planes 
over a common ground to reduce system noise and power coupling—see (d). Keep 
track runs as orthogonal as possible between adjacent layers—see (c). Also avoid loop 
track that acts as a receiving or radiating antenna. Avoid floating conductor areas, 
since they act as EMI radiators. Connect them to a ground plane otherwise.
Power Supply
Avoid loops in supply lines, as shown in (h). Also decouple supply lines at local bound-
aries—see (i). Position high- speed circuits closest to the power supply, while placing 
the slowest section farthest away to reduce power plane transients—see (g). When pos-
sible, isolate individual systems on both power supply and signal lines—see (j).
Filtering Components
Position biasing and pull- up/down components close to driver/bias points. Make 
use of common- mode chokes between current- carrying and signal lines to increase 
FIGURE 3.95

374    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
coupling and eliminate stray fields—see (k). Place decoupling capacitors close to chip 
supply lines to reduce component noise and power line transients—see (l).
These tips were adapted from an Engineering Note, “Electro- Magnetic Interfer-
ence and Electro- Magnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC)” written by David B. Fancher, 
Inductive Products Division, Vishay Dale.
3.8  Transformers
3.8.1  Basic Operations
A basic transformer is a two- port (four- terminal) device capable of transforming an ac 
input voltage into a higher or lower ac output voltage. Transformers are not designed 
to raise or lower dc voltages, however, since the conversion mechanism relies on a 
changing magnetic field generated by a changing current. A typical transformer con-
sists of two or more insulated wire coils that share a common laminated iron core. One 
of the coils is called the primary (containing NP turns), while the other coil is called the 
secondary (containing NS turns). A simplistic representation of a transformer is shown 
in Fig. 3.96, along with its schematic symbol.
FIGURE 3.95  (Continued)

When an ac voltage is applied across the primary coil of the transformer, an 
 alternating magnetic flux ΦM

 emanates from the primary, propagates 
through the iron- laminated core, and passes through the secondary coil. (The iron 
core increases the inductance, and the laminations decrease power- consuming eddy 
 currents.)  According to Faraday’s law of induction, the changing magnetic flux 
induces a voltage of VS = NSdΦM/dt, assuming there is perfect magnetic flux coupling 
(coefficient of coupling k = 1). Combining the primary flux equation with the second-
ary induced voltage equation results in the following useful expression:

(3.1) Transformer voltage ratio
This equation says that if the number of turns in the primary coil is larger than the 
number of turns in the secondary coil, the secondary voltage will be smaller than 
the primary voltage. Conversely, if the number of turns in the primary coil is less 
than the number of turns in the secondary, the secondary voltage will be larger than 
the primary.
When a source voltage is applied across a transformer’s primary terminals while 
the secondary terminals are open- circuited (see Fig. 3.97), the source treats the trans-
former as if it were a simple inductor with an impedance of ZP = jωLP = ωL ∠ 90°, 
where LP represents the inductance of the primary coil. This means that the primary 
current will lag the voltage (source voltage) by 90°, and the primary current will be 
FIGURE 3.96
FIGURE 3.97

376    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
equal to VP/ZP, according to Ohm’s law. At the same time, a voltage of (NS/NP) VP 
will be present across the secondary and will be in phase with the primary voltage or 
180° out of phase, depending on the secondary coil winding direction or depending 
on which secondary coil end you choose as a reference (more on this in a moment).
When there is no load attached to the secondary of a transformer, the current 
within the primary is called the magnetizing current of the transformer. An ideal 
transformer, with no internal losses, would consume no power, since the current 
through the primary inductor would be 90° out of phase with the voltage (in P = IV, I is 
imaginary and the “power” is imaginary or reactive). With no load in the secondary, 
the only losses in the transformer are associated with those losses in the iron core and 
losses within the primary coil wire itself.
Example 1: A transformer has a primary of 200 turns and a secondary of 1200 turns. 
If a 120 VAC is applied to the primary, what voltage appears across the secondary?

This is an example of a step- down transformer, since the secondary voltage is lower 
than the primary voltage.
As you can see from the previous example, either winding of a transformer can be 
used as the primary, provided the windings have enough turns (enough inductance) 
to induce a voltage equal to the applied voltage without requiring an excessive cur-
rent. The windings must also have insulation with a voltage rating sufficient for the 
voltage present.
Now let’s take a look at what happens when you attach a load to the secondary, 
as shown in Fig. 3.98.
FIGURE 3.98

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    377
When a load is attached to the secondary, the secondary current sets up a magnetic 
field that opposes the field set up by the primary current. For the induced voltage 
in the primary to equal the applied voltage, the original field must be maintained. 
The primary must draw enough additional current to set up a field exactly equal 
and opposite to the field set up by the secondary current. At this point, for practical 
purposes, we assume that the entire primary current is a result of the secondary load. 
(This is close to true, since the magnetizing current will be very small in comparison 
with the primary load current at rated power output.)
Current Ratio
To figure out the relationship between the primary and secondary currents, consider 
that an ideal transformer is 100 percent efficient (real transformers are around 65 to 
99 percent efficient, depending on make), and then infer that all the power dissipated 
by the load in the secondary will be equal to the power supplied by the primary 
source. With the help of the generalized power law, we get:
 
PP = PS
 
IPVP = ISVS
Plugging our transformer voltage equation (3.1) into the VS term, we get:

(3.2) Ideal transformer current ratio
Example 3: A transformer with a primary of 180 turns and a secondary with 1260 
turns is delivering 0.10 A to a load. What is the primary current?

Notice from the previous example that even though the secondary voltage is larger 
than the primary voltage, the secondary current is smaller than the primary current. 
The secondary current in an ideal transformer is 180° out of phase with the primary 
current, since the field in the secondary just offsets the field in the primary. The phase 
relationship between the currents in the windings holds true no matter what the phase 
difference between the current and the voltage of the secondary. In fact, the phase dif-
ference, if any, between voltage and current in the secondary will be reflected back to 

378    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
the primary as an identical phase difference. Note that phase, however, can be selected 
according to how you pull the secondary out—see the following note.
NOTE ABOUT PHASE
By now you may be a bit annoyed with the notion of phase. For example, 
to say that the primary voltage is out of phase with the secondary by 180° 
is a smack in the face of relativity. Couldn’t you simply wind the secondary 
winding in a different direction or, more easily, simply reverse the secondary 
leads to get an output that is within phase? The answer is yes. It is a relativ-
ity game with the transformer pins. Figure 3.99 shows two transformers that 
are identical in very way except for the winding direction of the secondary. 
The winding A arrangement, when tested with a common ground and oscil-
loscope, yields in-phase voltage, while the winding in B yields voltage and 
currents that are 180° out of phase with the primary. To avoid confusion, 
phase dots are used to tell you the relative orientation of the windings. The 
way to read the phase dots is that current goes into the primary dot and 
causes current to exit out the secondary dot. The following drawing should 
help give you a sense of the direction of current flow and polarities that are 
defined by the position of the primary and secondary phase dots.

The transformer symbol actually isn’t fully defined until phase dots are 
included. If you don’t see them, either phase isn’t important in the circuit, 
or the author forgot to include them. In many applications, keeping track of 
phase between the primary and secondary is not important since the second-
ary stage doesn’t care about what the primary is doing. One the other hand, 
there are circuits whose secondary stages do indeed care and they won’t 
work properly if phase isn’t strictly adhered to. Usually these circuits have 
an additional linkage between the primary and secondary stages (e.g., tran-
sistor, capacitor additional transformer, etc.) and the fundamental operation 
of the circuit depends of interplay between the primary and secondary phase 
voltages. An example of a circuit that doesn’t care about the secondary phase 
is a dc power supply that uses a step-down transformer’s secondary to feed 
a rectifier stage. The rectifier stage doesn’t care about phase. An example of 
a circuit that does care about phase is a Joule Thief circuit that links the sec-
ondary to primary through a bipolar transistor stage. Google “Joule Thief” 
to check out this interesting circuit. You’ll also find phase dots frequently 
within radio circuitry where phase again is important.
Power Ratio
A moment ago, when deriving the transformer current equation, we assumed that the 
transfer of power from primary to secondary was 100 percent efficient. However, it 
is important to realize that there is always some power loss in the resistance of the 

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    379
FIGURE 3.99
coils and in the iron core of the transformer. This means that the power taken from the 
source is greater than the power used in the secondary. This can be stated by the fol-
lowing expression:
 
PS = n × PP 
(3.3) Efficiency factor
where PS is the power output from the secondary, PP is the power input to primary  
and n is the efficiency factor. The efficiency n is always less than 1. It is usually 
 expressed as a percentage—for example, 0.75 represents an efficiency of 75 percent.
Example 4: What is the power input to the primary if a transformer has an efficiency 
of 75 percent and its full load output at the secondary is 100 W?

Transformers are typically designed to have highest efficiency at the manufacturer’s 
rated outputs. Above or below the rated output, the efficiency drops. The amount 
of power a transformer can handle depends on its own losses (heating of wire and 

380    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
core, etc.). Exceeding the rated power of a transformer can lead to wire meltdown 
or insulation breakdown. Even when the load is purely reactive, the transformer 
will still be generating heat loss due to internal resistance of the coils and losses in 
the core. For this reason, manufacturers also specify a maximum volt- amp rating, or 
VA- rating, that should not be exceeded.
Impedance Ratio
Using ac Ohm’s law, IP = VP/ZP, and assuming an ideal transformer, where power 
from the primary is 100 percent transferred to secondary, we can come up with an 
equation relating the primary and secondary impedances:
 
PP = PS
 
IPVP = ISVS

(3.4) Transformer impedance ratio
where ZP is the impedance looking into the primary terminal from the power source, 
and ZS is the impedance of the load connected to the secondary. Figure 3.100 shows 
an equivalent circuit.
If the load impedance in the secondary increases, the impedance looking into the 
primary (from the source’s point of view) will also increase in a manner that is pro-
portional to the ratio of the turns squared.
Example 5: A transformer has a primary with 500 turns and a secondary with 1000 
turns. What is the primary impedance if a 2000- Ω load impedance is attached to the 
secondary?

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    381
As you can see, by selecting the proper turns ratio, the impedance of a fixed load can 
be transformed to any desired value (ideally). If transformer losses can be neglected, 
the transformed (reflected) impedance has the same phase angle as the actual load 
 impedance. Hence, if the load is purely resistive, the load presented by the primary 
to the power source will also be pure resistance. If the load impedance is complex 
(e.g., inductance and capacitance are thrown in so that load current and voltage are 
out of phase with each other), then the primary voltage and current will show the 
same phase angle.
In electronics, there are many instances where circuits require a specific load 
 resistance (or impedance) for optimum performance. The impedance of the actual 
load dissipating power may differ widely from the impedance of the source. In 
this case, a transformer can be used to change the actual load into an impedance of 
desired value. This is referred to as impedance matching. We can rearrange Eq. 3.4 
and get:

where NP/NS is the required turns ratio—primary to secondary, ZP is the primary

is to be connected to an 8.0- Ω speaker. What turns ratio, primary to secondary, is

Center- Tap Transformers
Rarely do you see transformers in the real world with just four leads—two for the 
primary and two for the secondary. Many commercial transformers employ center 
taps. A center tap is simply an electrical connection that is made somewhere between 
the two ends of a transformer winding. By using a center tap, it is possible to utilize 
only a fraction of the winding voltage. For example, in Fig. 3.103, a transformer’s 
Example 8: If a step- up transformer has a turns ratio of 1:3, what are the voltage 
ratio, current ratio, and impedance ratio? Assume ratios are given in the form 
“primary: secondary.”
Answer: Voltage ratio is 1:3, current ratio is 3:1, impedance ratio is 1:9.
Transformer Gear Analogy
It is often helpful to think of transformers as gearboxes. For example, in the gearbox 
analogy in Fig. 3.102, the primary winding is analogous to the input shaft (where the 
motor is attached) and the secondary winding is analogous to the output shaft. Current is 
equivalent to shaft speed (rmp) and voltage is equivalent to torque. In a gearbox, 
 mechanical power (speed multiplied by torque) is constant (neglecting losses) and is 
equivalent to electrical power (voltage times current), which is also constant. The gear 
ratio is equivalent to the transformer step- up or step- down ratio. A step- up transformer 
acts like a reduction gear (in which mechanical power is transferred from a small, rapidly 
rotating gear to a large, slowly rotating gear): it trades current (speed) for voltage (torque), 
by transferring power from a primary coil to a secondary coil having more turns. A step- 
down transformer acts similarly to a multiplier gear (in which mechanical power is trans-
ferred from a large gear to a small gear): it trades voltage (torque) for current (speed), by 
transferring power from a primary coil to a secondary coil having fewer turns.
FIGURE 3.102

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    383
secondary is center- tapped midway between its winding, yielding two output volt-
ages VS1 and VS2. If we place a ground reference on the center tap (it is treated now 
as a common), we see the voltages in terms of phase, as shown in the example circuit 
in Fig. 3.103. In this case, the two secondary voltages are equal because we assumed 
that the number of turns on either end of the center tap were the same. In general, the 
secondary voltages are determined by the turns ratio.
Center taps can be placed on both the primary side and the secondary side, with 
multiple taps on either side. For example, a typical power transformer has several 
secondary windings, each providing a different voltage. Figure 3.104 shows a sche-
matic of a typical power supply transformer. It is possible to join pins with a jump-
er to get the desired voltage ratios across other pins. Manufacturers will  provide 
you with the voltages between the various tap points, usually specifying CT as the 
center- tap voltage. Center taps provide flexibility in design and allow varying out-
puts, which you implement by incorporating switches, for example. We’ll see how 
FIGURE 3.103
FIGURE 3.104

384    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
a center- tap transformer is used to split incoming 240 VAC for the main into two 
120- VAC legs within the circuit breaker of your house, and we’ll also discover how 
full- wave center- tap rectifier circuits are used in building dc power supplies.
Real Transformer Characteristics
A perfect or ideal transformer has a primary- to- secondary coupling coefficient of 1. 
This means that both coils link with all the magnetic flux lines, so that the voltage 
induced per turn is the same for both coils. This also means that the induced volt-
age per turn is the same for both primary and secondary coils. Iron core transform-
ers operating at low frequencies come close to being ideal. However, due to various 
 imperfections, such as eddy current, hysteresis losses, internal coil resistance, and 
skin effects at higher frequencies, this isn’t quite true.
In real transformers, not all of the magnetic flux is common to both windings. 
Flux not associated with linkage is referred to as leakage flux and is responsible for a 
voltage of self- induction. There are small amounts of leakage inductance associated 
with both windings of a transformer. Leakage inductance acts in exactly the same 
manner as an equivalent amount of ordinary inductance inserted in series with the 
circuit. The reactance associated with leakage inductance is referred to as leakage 
reactance, which varies with transformer build and frequency. Figure 3.105 shows a 
real- life model of a transformer including leakage reactances for both primary and 
secondary coils, namely, XL1 and XL2. When current flows through a leakage reac-
tance, there is an associated voltage drop. The voltage drop becomes greater with 
increasing current and increases as more power is taken from the  secondary.
The internal resistances of a transformer’s windings R1 and R2 also result in volt-
age drop when there is current flow. Although these voltage drops are not in phase 
with those caused by leakage reactance, together they result in a lower secondary 
voltage under load than is indicated by the transformer turns ratio formula.
Another nonideal characteristic of transformers is stray capacitance. An elec-
tric field exists between any two points having a different voltage. When current 
flows through a coil, each turn has a slightly different voltage than its adjacent 
turns. This results in capacitance between turns and is modeled by C1 and C2 in 
Fig. 3.105. A mutual capacitance CM also exists between the primary and secondary 
windings for the same reason. It is also possible for transformer windings to exhibit 
capacitance relative to nearby metal, such as a chassis, shield, or even the core itself.
FIGURE 3.105

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    385
Stray capacitance tends to have little influence in power and audio transformers, 
but becomes influential as the frequencies increase. In RF applications where trans-
formers are used, the stray capacitance can resonate with either the leakage reactance 
or, at lower frequencies, the winding reactances, especially under very light or zero- 
ohm loads. In the frequency region around resonance, transformers do not exhibit 
behavior as described by the previous transformer equations.
Iron core transformers also experience losses with hysteresis and eddy current, as 
was discussed in Sec. 2.24. These losses, which add to the required magnetizing cur-
rent, are equivalent to adding a resistance in parallel to R1 in Fig. 3.105.
TRANSFORMER PRECAUTIONS
There are three basic rules to observe when using a transformer. First, never 
apply a voltage that is greatly in excess of the transformer winding ratings. 
Second, never allow a significant direct current to flow through any winding 
not designed to handle it. Third, don’t operate the transformer at a frequency 
outside the range specified by the manufacturer. Applying a voltage of, say, 
120 VAC to a secondary in hopes of achieving 1200 VAC at the primary is a 
bad idea—expect smoke and combustion, accompanied by insulation failure. 
Similar results can be expected with excessive dc current through the pri-
mary. In terms of frequency, a 60- Hz transformer driven at 20 Hz will draw 
too much magnetizing current and will run dangerously hot.
3.8.2  Transformer Construction
Cores
Transformers used for power and audio frequencies have cores made of many thin 
laminations of silicon steel. The laminations reduce eddy currents, as discussed in 
Sec. 2.24. A typical laminated core is made from E- shaped and I- shaped pieces, sand-
wiched together, as shown in Fig. 3.106. Transformers made from these cores are 
therefore often referred to as EI transformers.
FIGURE 3.106

386    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Two common core shapes in use are shown in Fig. 3.106. In the shell construction, 
both the primary and the secondary windings are wound around the same inner leg, 
while in the core construction, primary and secondary windings are wound on separate 
legs. The core construction is often implemented to minimize capacitive effects between 
primary and secondary windings, or when one winding is to be operated at very high 
voltage. The size, shape, and type of core material, as well as the frequency range, influ-
ence the required number of turns in each winding. In most transformers, the coils are 
wound in layers, with a sheet of special paper insulation placed between each layer. 
A thicker insulation is used between adjacent coils and between the core and the first coil.
Powdered iron cores, with their low eddy current characteristics, are used in trans-
formers that operate above mains frequencies (60 Hz) up to several kilohertz. These 
cores have a very high permeability and thus provide decent stepping capability for 
their size. Transformers that are used in even higher- frequency applications, such as RF, 
often contain cores made from nonconductive magnetic ceramic materials or ferrites.
A common core shape for powdered iron and ferrite core transformers is the 
toroid, as shown in Fig. 3.107a. The closed ring shape of the toroid eliminates air 
gaps inherent in the construction of an EI core. The primary and secondary coils 
are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. Ferrite cores 
are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to a mega-
hertz. In general, toroidal transformers are more efficient (around 95 percent) than 
cheaper laminated EI transformers; they are more compact (about half the size), weigh 
less (about half), have less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio applica-
tions), and have lower off- load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits).
FIGURE 3.107
Shielding
To eliminate mutual capacitance between windings within a transformer, an electro-
static shield is often placed between the windings. Some transformers may incorporate 
a magnetic shield, as shown in Fig. 3.107b. The magnetic shield helps prevent outside 
magnetic fields (interference) from inducing currents within the inner windings. The 
shield also helps prevent the transformer from becoming an interference radiator itself.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    387
Windings
For small- power and signal transformers, the windings are made from solid wire 
copper, insulated typically with enamel; sometimes additional insulation is used for 
safety. Larger- power transformers may be wound with copper or aluminum wire, or 
even strip conductors for very heavy current; in some cases multistrand conductors 
are used to reduce skin effect losses. High- frequency transformers operating in the 
kilohertz range often have windings made of Litz wire to minimize skin effects. For 
signal transformers, the windings may be arranged in a way to minimize leakage 
inductance and stray capacitance in order to improve high- frequency response.
3.8.3  Autotransformers and Variable Transformers
An autotransformer is similar to a standard transformer; however, it uses only one 
single coil and a center tap (or taps) to make primary and secondary connections. See 
Fig. 3.108. As with standard transformers, autotransformers can be used to step up 
or step down voltages, as well as match impedances; however, they will not provide 
electrical isolation like a standard transformer, since their primary and secondary are 
on the same coil—there is no electrical isolation between the two coils.
Although an autotransformer has only one winding, the laws of induction that 
were used with a standard transformer to step up and step down voltage can be 
 applied just as well. This also applies to principles of current and impedance as a 
function of the number of winding turns. In Fig. 3.108, the current in the common 
winding is the difference between the line current (primary current) and the load 
current (secondary current), since these currents are out of phase. Hence, if the line 
and load currents are nearly equal, the common section of the winding may be 
wound with comparatively small wire. The line and load currents will be equal only 
when the primary (line) and secondary (load) voltages are close in magnitude.
Autotransformers are often used in impedance- matching applications. They are 
also frequently used for boosting or reducing the power- line voltage by relatively 
FIGURE 3.108

388    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
small amounts. Figure 3.108 shows a switch- stepped autotransformer whose out-
put voltage can be set to any number of values determined by the switch contact 
position.
A variable transformer or Variac (commercial name) is similar to the switch- 
stepped autotransformer in Fig. 3.108; however, it has a continuous wiper action 
along a circular coil, as shown in Fig. 3.109. A Variac acts like an adjustable ac voltage 
source. Its primary is connected to the hot and neutral of the 120- V line voltage, while 
the secondary leads consist of the neutral and an adjustable wiper that moves along 
the single core winding.
Being able to adjust the line voltage is a very useful trick when troubleshooting 
line- power equipment, where the fuse instantly blows at normal line voltage. Even 
without a fuse blowing, troubleshooting at around 85 V may reduce the fault  current.
It is important to note that a Variac by itself does not provide isolation protec-
tion like a standard transformer, since the primary and secondary shared a common 
winding. It is therefore important, if you plan to work on ungrounded, “hot chassis” 
equipment, that you place an isolation transformer before the Variac—never after it. 
If you don’t, shock hazards await. Figure 3.109c shows a schematic of such an 
FIGURE 3.109  (a) Nonisolated 120-V Variac whose output voltage is varied by rotating a wiper. (b) Nonisolated 240-V 
Variac. (c) A homemade variable ac supply with isolation protection provided by means of an isolation transformer. (d) ac 
power supply that houses an isolation transformer, Variac, switch, fuse, ac outlet, and meter.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    389
 arrangement. It includes a switch and fuse protection, as well as current and voltage 
meters, all of which create an adjustable, fully isolated ac power source.
To avoid the hassle of cascading a Variac and isolation transformer together, sim-
ply get an ac power supply that houses both elements together in one package—see 
Fig. 3.109d.
Boosting and Bucking
We just saw how autotransformers are used in applications requiring a slight boost 
or reduction in voltage to a load. It is possible to accomplish the same effect by  using 
a normal (isolated) transformer with just the right primary/secondary turns ratio. 
There is still another alternative—use a step- down configuration with secondary 
winding connected in a series- aiding (“boosting”) or series- opposing (“bucking”) 
configuration, as shown in Fig. 3.110.
In the boosting configuration, the secondary coil’s polarity is oriented so that its 
voltage directly adds to the primary voltage. In the bucking configuration, the sec-
ondary coil’s polarity is oriented so that its voltage directly subtracts from the pri-
mary voltage. An autotransformer does the same job as the boosting and bucking 
functions displayed here, but using only a single winding, making it cheaper and 
lighter to manufacture.
3.8.4  Circuit Isolation and the Isolation Transformer
Transformers perform an important role in isolating one circuit from another. 
Figure 3.111 shows an example application that uses a transformer to isolate a load 
connected to an ac outlet. In this application, there is no need to step up or step down 
the voltage, so the transformer has a 1:1 winding ratio. Such a transformer is referred 
to as an isolation transformer. In Fig. 3.111, a mains isolation transformer is used to iso-
late a load from the source, as well as provide ground fault protection. An isolation 
transformer should be used whenever you work on nongrounded equipment, with 
no input isolation such as switch- mode power supplies.
In your home wiring, the neutral (white) and the ground (green) connections are 
tied together at the main junction box, so they are basically at the same potential— 
0 V, or earth ground. If you accidentally touch the hot wire while being in contact 
FIGURE 3.110

390    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 3.111
with a grounded object, current will pass through your body and give you a poten-
tially fatal shock. With an isolation transformer, the secondary winding leads act as a 
120- V source and return, similar to the mains’ hot and neutral, but with an important 
 difference. Neither the secondary source nor return runs are tied to earth ground! 
This means that if you touch the secondary source or return while being in contact 
with a grounded object, no current will flow through your body. Current only wants 
to pass between the secondary source and return runs. (Note that all transformers 
provide isolation, not just line isolation transformers. Therefore, equipment with 
input power transformers already have basic isolation protection built in. Isolation 
transformers used for laboratory work are explained in greater detail in Sec. 7.5.12.)
Isolation transformers are also typically constructed with two isolated Faraday 
shields between the primary and secondary windings. The use of the two shields di-
verts high- frequency noise, which would normally be coupled across the transformer to 
ground. Increasing the separation between the two Faraday shields minimizes the capaci-
tance  between the two and, hence, the coupling of noise between the two. Therefore, the 
 isolation transformer acts to clean up line power noise before being delivered to a circuit.
3.8.5  Various Standard and Specialized Transformers
Power Transformers
FIGURE 3.112
These transformers are used primarily to reduce line voltage. They come 
in a variety of different shapes, sizes, and primary and secondary wind-
ing ratios. They often come with taps and multiple secondary windings. 
Color- coded wires are frequently used to indicate primary and secondary 
leads (e.g., black wires for primary, green for secondary, and yellow for 
tap lead is one possibility). Other transformers use pins for primary, sec-
ondary, and tapped leads, allowing them to be mounted on a PC board. 
You can also find transformers in wall- mount packages that plug directly 
into an ac outlet, with screw- in terminals as secondary and tapped leads.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    391
Audio Transformers
FIGURE 3.114
Air Core RF Transformers
Audio transformers are used primarily to match impedances between audio 
 devices (e.g., between microphone and amplifier or amplifier and speaker), 
though they can be implemented in other ways as well. They work best at audio 
frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Outside this range they will reduce or block 
signals. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and typically contain a center 
tap in both the primary and secondary windings. Some come with color- coded 
wires to specify leads, while other audio transformers have pinlike  terminals 
that can be mounted on PC boards. Spec tables provide dc resistance values for 
primary and secondary windings to help you select the appropriate transformer 
for the particular matching application. Besides performing simple  impedance 
matching, audio transformers can be used to step up or step down a signal volt-
age, convert a circuit from unbalanced to balanced and vice versa, block dc cur-
rent in a circuit while allowing ac current to flow, and provide basic isolation 
between one device and another. Note that audio transformers have a maximum 
input level that cannot be exceeded without causing distortion. Also, audio 
transformers cannot step up a signal by more than about 25 dB when used in 
typical audio circuits. Because of this, an audio transformer cannot be substi-
tuted for a microphone preamp. If more than 25 dB of gain is required, an active 
preamp must be used instead of a transformer.
FIGURE 3.113
Air core transformers are special devices used 
in radio- frequency circuits. (They are used 
for RF coupling, such as antenna tuning and 
impedance matching.) Unlike steel or fer-
rite core transformers, the core is made from 
a nonmagnetic form, usually a hollow tube 
of plastic. The degree of coupling  between 
windings in an air core transformer is much 
less than that of a steel core  transformer; how-
ever, there are no losses associated with eddy 
currents, hysteresis, saturation, and so on, as 
is the case with magnetic cores. This becomes 
critically important in RF applications—at 
high frequencies, steel core transformers 
experience significant losses. Toroidal air 
core transformers aren’t common nowadays, 
except in VHF (very high frequency) work. 
Today, special coupling networks and RF 
powdered- iron and ferrite toroids have gen-
erally replaced air cores, except in situations 
where the circuit handles very high power or 
the coils must be very temperature stable.

392    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Ferrite and Powdered- Iron Toroidal Transformers
Pulse and Small Signal Transformers
FIGURE 3.116
FIGURE 3.115
Toroidal ferrite and powdered- iron transformers are used from 
a few hundred hertz well into the UHF spectrum. The prin-
cipal  advantage of this type of core is self- shielding and low 
losses due to eddy currents. The permeability/size ratio is also 
very large, making them compact devices requiring fewer coil 
turns than  traditional transformers. The most common ferrite 
toroid  transformer is the conventional broadband transformer. 
 Broadband transformers provide dc isolation between the primary 
and secondary circuits. The primary of a step- down impedance 
transformer is wound to occupy the entire core, with the second-
ary wound over the primary, as shown in Fig. 3.115. This style of 
transformer is frequently used in impedance matching. In stan-
dard broadcast radio receivers, these transformers operate in a 
frequency range from 530 to 1550 kHz. In shortwave receivers, RF 
transformers are subjected to frequencies up to about 20 MHz; in 
radar, it approaches upward of 200 MHz.
Pulse transformers are special transformers optimized for transmitting 
rectangular electrical pulses—ones with fast rise and fall times and con-
stant amplitude. A small signal transformer is a small version of a pulse 
transformer. These devices are used in digital logic and telecom circuits, 
often for matching logic drivers to transmission lines. Medium- size power 
versions are used in power- control circuits such as camera flash control-
lers, while larger- power versions are used in electrical power distribu-
tion to interface low- voltage control circuitry with high- voltage power 
semiconductive gates, such as TRIACs, IGBTs, thyristors, and MOSFETs. 
Special high- voltage pulse transformers are used to generate high- power 
pulses for radar, particle accelerators, or other pulsed power applications.
  To minimize pulse shape distortion, a pulse transformer requires very 
low leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open- 
circuit inductance. Low coupling capacitance is also important in power- 
pulse transformer applications to protect circuitry on the primary side 
from high- power transients created by load.
3.8.6  Transformer Applications
There are three principal uses for transformers: to transform voltages and currents 
from one level to another, to physically isolate the primary circuit from the second-
ary, and to transform circuit impedances from one level to another. Here are some 
examples in action.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    393
Current Transformers
Center- Tap Pole Transformer
FIGURE 3.118  In the United States, main power lines carry ac voltages upward of several 
thousand volts. A center- tap pole transformer is used to step down the line voltage to 240 V. 
The tap then acts to break this voltage up into 120-V portions. Small appliances, such as TVs, 
lights, and hair dryers can use either the top line and the neutral line or the bottom line and 
the neutral line. (The neutral is grounded to a ground rod through a link between neutral 
and ground buses in the breaker box.) Larger appliances, such as stoves, refrigerators, and 
clothes dryers often make use of the 240- V terminals and often use the neutral terminal as 
well. See App. A for more on power distribution and home wiring.
FIGURE 3.117
Current transformers are special devices used primarily to measure 
larger currents that would be too dangerous to measure with an 
ammeter. They are designed to provide a current in their secondary 
that is proportional to the current flowing in the primary. A typical 
current transformer resembles a toroidal core inductor with many 
secondary windings. The primary coil consists of simply passing a 
single cable- to- be- measured (insulated) through the center of the 
toroid. The output current through the secondary is many times 
smaller than the actual current through the cable (primary). These 
transformers are specified by their input and output current ratio 
(400:5, 2000:5, etc.). Current transformers designed for electrical 
supply applications are designed to drive 5- A (full- scale) meters. 
There are also wideband current transformers used to measure 
high- frequency waveforms and pulsed currents.

394    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Transformer Used for Landscape Lighting
FIGURE 3.119  Here a step- down low- voltage transformer is used to drive quartz halogen landscape lamps. The lamps in this 
case don’t care if the voltage is ac since the frequency (60 Hz) is too fast for there to be any noticeable variation in luminous 
output. Most commercial transformers used for landscape wiring, or for driving solenoid- powered sprinkler systems, will 
come with multiple outputs. This transformer provides 12- V, 24- V, and 14- V outputs. The 14- V output may be used to drive 
12- V lamps if there is an anticipated voltage drop along long cable runs; the 24- V output may be used to drive 24- V devices. 
Note that the total load should not consume more power than the transformer’s rated output capacity. For example, this 100- W 
transformer should not be used to drive more than, say, ten 10- watt lamps or five 20- watt lamps. Exceeding this will result in 
lamp dimming.
Step- Down Transformer for DC Power Supply
FIGURE 3.120  Transformers are essential ingredients in power supply design. Here a 120- V to 18V- 0- 18V 
 center- tap transformer is used to create a split ±12- V dc power supply. The transformer acts to reduce the volt-
age to 18 VAC across each coil end and the center tap. The rectifier section built from diodes acts to eliminate 
negative swings in the upper positive section and eliminate positive swings in the lower section. Capacitors are 
thrown in to remove the pulsating dc and make the voltages appear dc. The regulators are used to set the dc volt-
ages to exactly +12 V and −12 V. See Chap. 11 on power supplies for more details.

Chapter 3: Basic Electronic Circuit Components    395
Various Transformer/Rectifier Arrangements
FIGURE 3.121
There are various ways in which to create dc power supplies. 
 Figure 3.121 shows the four basic schemes used. Each scheme has 
its pros and cons, which are briefly described here and in greater 
detail in the sections on diodes and power supply in chapters to 
come.
  (a) Dual complementary rectifier: Very efficient and best 
choice for two balanced outputs with a common return. The out-
put windings are bifilar wound for precisely matched series resis-
tances, coupling, and capacitance.
VAC = 0.8 × (VDC + 2)
IAC = 1.8 × IDC
(b) Full- wave bridge: Most efficient use of transformer’s secondary 
winding. Best for high- voltage outputs.
 
VAC = 0.8 × (VDC + 2)
IAC = 1.8 × IDC
(c) Half- wave rectifier: This design should be avoided for power 
supply design, as it is an inefficient use of the transformer. This 
arrangement causes the core to become polarized and to saturate 
in one direction.
(d) Full- wave center tap: While more efficient than the half- wave 
rectifier circuit, the full wave does not make full use of second-
aries, but is good for high- current, low- voltage applications, as 
there is only one diode drop per positive half cycle.
 
VAC = 1.7 × (VDC + 1)
IAC = 1.2 × IDC

396    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
(a) Maximum power is transferred to a load if the 
load impedance is equal to the Thevenin impedance 
of the network supplying power. To supply maxi-
mum power transfer from the audio amplifier with 
an output impedance of 500 Ω to an 8- Ω speaker, we 
must properly match the load impedance with that 
of the output impedance (or Thevenin impedance) 
of the source. If we were not to match impedance 
and attempt to drive the 8- Ω speaker directly, the 
impedance mismatch would result in very poor 
(low peak power) performance. Also, the amplifier 
would dissipate considerable power in the form of 
heat as it tries to drive the low- impedance speaker.
 When going from a high- impedance (high- voltage, 
low- current) source to a low- impedance (low- voltage, 
high- current) load, we need to use a step- down 
transformer. To determine the turns  ratio required, 
we refer back to Eq. 5:

Audio Impedance Matching
FIGURE 3.122
In other words, the required winding ratio is 7.906:1. With such a 
transformer in place, the speaker will load the amplifier to just the 
right degree, drawing power at the correct voltage and current levels 
for the most efficient power transfer to load.
(b) Note that most transistor or IC hi- fi amplifier and speaker sys-
tems have amplifiers with output impedances much lower than the 
speaker impedance. A typical speaker impedance is 8 Ω, for example, 
but most hi- fi amplifiers have an output impedance of 0.1 Ω or less. 
This not only ensures that most of the audio energy is transferred 
to the speaker, but also that the amplifier’s low output impedance 
provides good electrical damping for the speaker’s moving voice 
coil—giving higher fidelity.
 Older valve amplifiers needed a different form of impedance 
matching, because output valves generally had fairly fixed and rela-
tively high output impedance so they  couldn’t deliver audio energy 
efficiently into the low load impedance of a typical speaker. So an 
output transformer had to be used to produce a closer impedance 
match. The transformer stepped up the impedance of the speaker, so 
that it gave the output valve an effective load 
of a few thousand ohms; this was at least com-
parable to the valve’s own output impedance, 
so only a small amount of energy was wasted 
as heat in the valve.
 (c) The only area in audio where imped-
ance matching (of a different kind) tends 
to be important is with transducers such as 
 microphones, turntable pickups, and tape 
heads. Here, the transducer often needs to 
be provided with particular load impedance, 
but not in order to maximize power or signal 
 transfer.
 The diagram in (c) shows a typical match-
ing arrangement for a microphone connected 
through a matching transformer to an input 
stage (unity gain stage) of an audio amplifier IC.

3.9  Fuses and Circuit Breakers
Fuses and circuit breakers are devices designed to protect circuits from excessive cur-
rent flows, which are often a result of large currents that result from shorts or sudden 
power surges. A fuse contains a narrow strip of metal that is designed to melt when 
current flow exceeds its current rating, thereby interrupting power to the circuit. 
Once a fuse blows (wire melts), it must be replaced with a new one. A circuit breaker 
is a mechanical device that can be reset after it “blows.” It contains a spring- loaded 
contact that is latched into position against another contact. When the current flow 
exceeds a breaker’s current rating, a bimetallic strip heats up and bends. As the strip 
bends, it “trips” the latch, and the spring pulls the contacts apart. To reset the breaker, 
a button or rockerlike switch is pressed to compress the spring and reset the latch.
In homes, fuses/circuit breakers are used to prevent the wires within the walls 
from melting under excessive current flow (typically upwards of 15 A); they are not 
designed to protect devices, such as dc power supplies, oscilloscopes, and other 
line- powered devices, from damage. For example, if an important current- limiting 
component within a test instrument (powered from the main line) shorts out, or if it 
is connected to an extremely large test current, the circuit within the device may be 
flooded with, say, 10 A instead of 0.1 A. According to P = I 2R, the increase in wattage 
will be 10,000 times larger, and as a result, the components within the circuit will 
fry. As the circuit is melting away, no help will come from the main 15- A breaker—
the surge in current through the device may be large, but not large enough to trip 
the breaker. For this reason, it is essential that each individual device contain its 
own properly rated fuse.
Fuses come in fast- action (quick- blow) and time- lag (slow- blow) types. A fast- acting 
fuse will turn off with just a brief surge in current, whereas a time- lag fuse will take a 
while longer (a second or so). Time- lag fuses are used in circuits that have large turn- 
on currents, such as motor circuits, and other inductive- type circuits.
In practice, a fuse’s current rating should be around 50 percent larger than the 
expected nominal current rating. The additional leeway allows for unexpected, slight 
variations in current and also provides compensation for fuses whose current ratings 
decrease as they age.
Fuses and breakers that are used with 120- V ac line power must be placed in 
the hot line (black wire in the United States) and must be placed before the device 
they are designed to protect. If a fuse or circuit breaker is placed in the neutral line 
(white wire), the full line- voltage will be present at the input, even if the fuse/circuit 
breaker blows. Circuit breakers that are used to protect 240- V ac appliances (e.g., 
stoves, clothes dryers) have fuses on all three input wires (both the hot wires and 
the neutral wire) (see Fig. 3.124). Power distribution and home wiring are covered in 
detail in App. A.

4.1  Semiconductor Technology
The most important and perhaps most exciting electrical devices used today are built 
from semiconductive materials. Electronic devices, such as diodes, transistors, thy-
ristors, thermistors, photovoltaic cells, phototransistors, photoresistors, lasers, and 
integrated circuits, are all made from semiconductive materials, or semiconductors.

4.1.1  What Is a Semiconductor?
Materials are classified by their ability to conduct electricity. Substances that eas-
ily pass an electric current, such as silver and copper, are referred to as conductors. 
Materials that have a difficult time passing an electric current, such as rubber, glass, 
and Teflon, are called insulators. There is a third category of material whose con-
ductivity lies between those of conductors and insulators. This third category of 
material is referred to as a semiconductor. A semiconductor has a kind of neutral 
conductivity when taken as a group. Technically speaking, semiconductors are 
defined as those materials that have a conductivity σ in the range between 10-7 and  
103 mho/cm (see Fig. 4.2). Some semiconductors are pure- elemental structures 
(e.g., silicon, germanium), others are alloys (e.g., nichrome, brass), and still others 
are liquids.

402    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Silicon
Silicon is the most important semiconductor used in building electrical devices. Other 
materials such as germanium and selenium are sometimes used, too, but they are less 
popular. In pure form, silicon has a unique atomic structure with very important 
properties useful in making electrical devices.
FIGURE 4.2
FIGURE 4.3  
Silicon is ranked second in the order of elements appearing in the earth’s crust, 
an average of 27 percent occurring in igneous rocks. It is estimated that a cubic mile 
of seawater contains about 15,000 tons of silicon. It is extremely rare to find silicon 
in its pure crystalline form in nature, and before it can be used in making electronic 
devices, it must be separated from its binding elements. After individuals—chemists, 
material scientists, etc.—perform the purification process, the silicon is melted and 
spun into a large “seed” crystal. This long crystal can then be cut up into slices or 
wafers that semiconductor- device designers use in making electrical contraptions.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    403
For the semiconductor- device designer, a silicon wafer alone does not prove very 
useful. A designer would not use the silicon wafer in its pure form to build a device; 
it just does not have quite the right properties needed to be useful. A semiconductor- 
device designer is looking for a material that can be made to alter its conductive state, 
acting as a conductor at one moment and as an insulator at another moment. For the 
material to change states, it must be able to respond to some external force applied 
at will, such as an externally applied voltage. A silicon wafer alone is not going to 
do the trick. In fact, a pure silicon wafer acts more as an insulator than a conductor, 
and it does not have the ability to change conductive states when an external force 
is ap plied. Every designer today knows that a silicon wafer can be transformed and 
combined with other transformed silicon wafers to make devices that have the ability 
to alter their conductive states when an external force is applied. The  transforming 
process is referred to as doping.
Doping
Doping refers to the process of “spicing up” or adding ingredients to a silicon 
wafer in such a way that it becomes useful to the semiconductor- device designer. 
Many ingredients can be added in the doping process, such as antimony, arsenic, 
aluminum, and gallium. These ingredients provide specialized characteristics 
such as frequency response to applied voltages, strength, and thermal integrity,  
to name a few. By far, however, the two most important ingredients that are of  
fundamental importance to the semiconductor- device designer are boron and 
phosphorus.
When a silicon wafer is doped with either boron or phosphorus, its electrical 
conductivity is altered dramatically. Normally, a pure silicon wafer contains no 
free electrons; all four of its valence electrons are locked up in covalent bonds with 
neighboring silicon atoms (see Fig. 4.5). Without any free electrons, an applied 
voltage will have little effect on producing an electron flow through the wafer.

404    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
However, if phosphorus is added to the silicon wafer, something very interest-
ing occurs. Unlike silicon, phosphorus has five valence electrons instead of four. Four 
of its valence electrons will form covalent bonds with the valence electrons of four 
neighboring silicon atoms (see Fig. 4.6). However, the fifth valence electron will not 
have a “home” (binding site) and will be loosely floating about the atoms. If a voltage 
is applied across the silicon- phosphorus mixture, the unbound electron will migrate 
through the doped silicon toward the positive voltage end. By supplying more phos-
phorus to the mixture, a larger flow of electrons will result. Silicon that is doped with 
phosphorus is referred to as n- type silicon, or negative- charge- carrier- type silicon.
Now, if you take pure silicon and add some boron, you will see a different kind 
of conduction effect. Boron, unlike silicon or phosphorus, contains only three valence 
electrons. When it is mixed with silicon, all three of its valence electrons will bind 
with neighboring silicon atoms (see Fig. 4.7). However, there will be a vacant spot—
called a hole—within the covalent bond between one boron and one silicon atom. If 
a voltage is applied across the doped wafer, the hole will move toward the negative 
voltage end, while a neighboring electron will fill in its place. Holes are considered 
positive charge carriers even though they do not contain a physical charge per se. 
Instead, it only appears as if a hole has a positive charge because of the charge imbal-
ance between the protons within the nucleus of the silicon atom that receives the hole 
and the electrons in the outer orbital. The net charge on a particular silicon atom with a 
hole will appear to be positive by an amount of charge equivalent to one proton (or 
a “negative electron”). Silicon that is doped with boron is referred to as p- type silicon, 
or positive- charge- carrier- type silicon.
A silicon wafer in pure form 
 doesn’t contain any free charge 
carriers; all the electrons are 
locked up into covalent bonds 
between neighboring atoms.

As you can see, both n- type and p- type silicon have the ability to conduct elec-
tricity; one does it with extra unbound electrons (n- type silicon), and the other does 
it with holes (p- type silicon).
A Note to Avoid Confusion
Boron atoms have three valence electrons, not four like silicon. This means that the 
combined lattice structure has fewer free valence electrons as a whole. However, this 
does not mean that a p- type silicon semiconductor has an overall positive charge; the 
missing electrons in the structure are counterbalanced by the missing protons in the 
nuclei of the boron atoms. The same idea goes for n- type silicon, but now the extra 
electrons within the semiconductor are counterbalanced by the extra protons within 
the phosphorus nuclei.
Another Note to Avoid Confusion (Charge Carriers)
What does it mean for a hole to flow? A hole is nothing, right? How can nothing 
flow? Well, it is perhaps misleading, but when you hear the phrase “hole flow” or 
“flow of positive charge carriers in p- type silicon,” electrons are in fact flowing. 
You may say,  doesn’t that make this just like the electron flow in n- type silicon? 
No. Think about tipping a sealed bottle of water upside down and then right side 
up (see Fig. 4.8). The bubble trapped in the bottle will move in the opposite direc-
tion of the water. For the bubble to proceed, water has to move out of its way. In 
this analogy, the water represents the electrons in the p- type silicon, and the holes 
represent the bubble. When a voltage is applied across a p- type silicon semicon-
ductor, the electrons around the boron atom will be forced toward the direction of 
the positive terminal. Now here is where it gets tricky. A hole next to a boron atom 
will be pointing toward the negative terminal. This hole is just waiting for an 
electron from a neighboring atom to fall into it, due in part to the lower energy 
configuration there. Once an electron, say, from a neighboring silicon atom, falls 
into the hole in the boron atom’s valence shell, a hole is briefly created in that sili-
con atom’s valence shell. The electrons in the silicon atom lean toward the positive 
terminal, and the newly created hole leans toward the negative terminal. The next 
silicon atom over will let go of one of its electrons, and the electron will fall into the 
hole, and the hole will move over again—the process continues, and it appears as 
if the hole flows in a continuous motion through the p- type semi conductor.
When boron is added 
to silicon, a hole is 
formed. This hole acts 
like a positive charge 
(see text) that aids  
in conduction. Silicon 
doped with boron is 
called p- type silicon.

A Final Note to Avoid Confusion
And finally, why is a hole called a positive charge carrier? How can “nothing” carry 
a positive charge? Well, what’s going on here is this: A hole, as it moves through the 
mostly silicon- based crystal, causes a brief alteration in the electrical field strength 
around the silicon atom in the crystal where it happens to be situated. When an elec-
tron moves out of the way, thus creating a new hole, this silicon atom as a whole will 
be missing an electron, and hence the positive charge from the nucleus of the silicon 
atom will be felt (one of the protons is not counterbalanced). The “positive charge 
carrier” attributed to holes comes from this effective positive nuclear charge of the 
protons fixed within the nucleus.
4.1.2  Applications of Silicon
You may be asking yourself, why are these two new types of silicon (n- type and p- type) 
so useful and interesting? What good are they for semiconductor- device designers? 
Why is there such a fuss over them? These doped silicon crystals are now conductors. 
Big deal, right? Yes, we now have two new conductors, but the two new conductors 
have two unique ways of passing an electric current—one does it with holes, the other 
with electrons. This is very important.
The manners in which n- type and p- type silicon conduct electricity (electron flow 
and hole flow) are very important in designing electronic devices such as diodes, tran-
sistors, and solar cells. Some clever people figured out ways to arrange slabs, chucks, 
strings, etc. made of n- type and p- type silicon in such a way that when an external volt-
age or current is applied to these structures, unique and very useful features result. These 
unique features are made possible by the interplay between hole flow and electron flow 
between the n- type and p- type semiconductors. With these new n- type/p- type contrap-
tions, designers began building one- way gates for current flow, opening and closing 
channels for current flow controlled by an external electrical voltage and/or current. 
Folks figured out that when an n- type and a p- type semiconductor were placed together 
and a particular voltage was applied across the slabs, light, or photons, could be pro-
duced as the electrons jumped across the junction between the interface. It was noticed 
that this process could work backward as well. That is, when light was exposed at the 
np junction, electrons were made to flow, thus resulting in an electric current. A number 
of clever contraptions have been built using n- type and p- type semiconductor combina-
tions. The following chapters describe some of the major devices people came up with.

4.2  Diodes
A diode is a two- lead semiconductor device that acts as a one- way gate to electric cur-
rent flow. When a diode’s anode lead is made more positive in voltage than its cathode 
lead—a condition referred to as forward biasing—current is permitted to flow through 
the device. However, if the polarities are reversed (the anode is made more negative 
in voltage than the cathode)—a condition referred to as reversed biasing—the diode 
acts to block current flow.

Diodes are used most commonly in circuits that convert ac voltages and current 
into dc voltages and currents (e.g., ac/dc power supply). Diodes are also used in 
 voltage- multiplier circuits, voltage- shifting circuits, voltage- limiting circuits, and 
voltage- regulator circuits.
4.2.1  How p-n Junction Diodes Work
A p-n junction diode (rectifier diode) is formed by sandwiching together n- type and p- type 
silicon. In practice, manufacturers grow an n- type silicon crystal and then abruptly 
change it to a p- type crystal. Then either a glass or plastic coating is placed around the 
joined crystals. The n side is the cathode end, and the p side is the anode end.
The trick to making a one- way gate from these combined pieces of silicon is getting 
the charge carriers in both the n- type and p- type silicon to interact in such a way that 
when a voltage is applied across the device, current will flow in only one direction. 
Both n- type and p- type silicon conducts electric current; one does it with electrons 
(n- type), and the other does it with holes (p- type). Now the important feature to 

408    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
note here, which makes a diode work (act as a one- way gate), is the manner in which 
the two types of charge carriers interact with each other and how they interact with 
an applied electrical field supplied by an external voltage across its leads. Below is an 
explanation describing how the charge carriers interact with each other and with the 
electrical field to create an electrically controlled one- way gate.
A diode’s one- way gate feature does not work all the time. That is, it takes a mini-
mal voltage to turn it on when it is placed in forward- biased direction. Typically for 
silicon diodes, an applied voltage of 0.6 V or greater is needed; otherwise, the diode 
will not conduct. This feature of requiring a specific voltage to turn the diode on may 
seem like a drawback, but in fact, this feature becomes very useful in terms of acting 
as a voltage- sensitive switch. Germanium diodes, unlike silicon diodes, often require 
a forward- biasing voltage of only 0.2 V or greater for conduction to occur. Figure 4.12 
shows how the current and voltage are related for silicon and germanium diodes.
Forward-Biased (“Open Door”)
When a diode is connected to a battery, as shown 
here, electrons from the n side and holes from the 
p side are forced toward the center (pn interface) 
by the electrical field supplied by the battery. The 
electrons and holes combine, and current passes 
through the diode. When a diode is arranged in 
this way, it is said to be forward- biased.
When a diode is connected to a battery, as shown 
here, holes in the n side are forced to the left, 
while electrons in the p side are forced to the 
right. This results in an empty zone around the 
p-n junction that is free of charge carriers, bet-
ter known as the depletion region. This depletion 
region has an  insulative quality that prevents 
current from flowing through the diode. When 
a diode is  arranged in this way, it is said to be 
reverse- biased.

Another fundamental difference between silicon diodes and germanium diodes, 
besides the forward- biasing voltages, is their ability to dissipate heat. Silicon diodes do 
a better job of dissipating heat than germanium diodes. When germanium diodes get

hot—temperatures exceeding 85°C—the thermal vibrations affect the physics inside 
the crystalline structure to a point where normal diode operation becomes unreliable. 
Above 85°C, germanium diodes become worthless.
4.2.2  Diode Water Analogy
A diode (or rectifier) acts as a one- way gate to current flow—see the water analogy in 
Fig. 4.13. Current flows in the direction of the arrow, from anode (+) to cathode (−), 
provided the forward voltage VF across it exceeds what’s called the junction threshold 
voltage. As a general rule of thumb, silicon p- n junction diodes have about a 0.6- V 
threshold, germanium diodes a 0.2- V threshold, and Schottky diodes a 0.4- V thresh-
old. However, don’t take this rule too seriously, because with real- life components, 
you’ll find these thresholds may be a few tenths of a volt off. For example, it’s entirely 
possible for a silicon p- n junction diode’s threshold to be anywhere between 0.6 and 
1.7 V; for germanium, 0.2 to 0.4 V; and for Schottky diodes, 0.15 to 0.9 V.
Note that if you actually put 12 V across a forward-biased diode as shown in 
Fig. 4.13, a very large current would flow, probably destroying the diode. Also, the 
axes of Fig. 4.13 are not to scale.
In terms of limits, avoid supplying a diode with a forward current IF beyond its 
peak current rating I0(max). If you do, you’ll get internal junction meltdown. Likewise, 
avoid applying a reverse voltage VR any bigger than the diode’s peak inverse voltage 
(PIV) rating. This, too, can render a diode worthless. See the graph in Fig. 4.13.
4.2.3  Kinds of Rectifiers/Diodes
There are numerous types of diodes, each specifically designed to work better in 
one application or another. Diodes for high- power applications (switching, power 
supplies, etc.) which draw lots of current or rectify high voltages typically go by 
the name rectifier diodes. On the other hand, diodes that go by names such as signal, 
switching, fast recovery, or high speed are designed to provide a low internal capaci-
tance (they store less charge but usually have weaker junctions for large currents). 
At high speeds, these diodes will reduce RC switching time constants, which means 
fewer time delays and lower signal losses.
FIGURE 4.13  

410    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Schottky diodes have a particularly low junction capacitance and faster switch- 
ing (∼10 ns) when compared to silicon p- n junction diodes due to their special  
metal- semiconductor- junction interface. They also have a lower junction threshold 
voltage—as low as 0.15 V, but usually a bit more (0.4 V average). Both these charac-
teristics enable them to detect low- voltage, high- frequency signals that ordinary p- n 
junction diodes would not see. (A Schottky with a 0.3- V threshold can pass signals 
greater than 0.3 V, but a silicon p- n junction diode with a 0.7- V threshold can only 
pass signals greater than 0.7 V.) For this reason, Schottky diodes are very popular in 
low- voltage signal rectifiers in RF circuits, signal switching in telecommunication, 
small dc/dc converters, small low- voltage power supplies, protection circuits, and 
voltage clamping arrangements. Their high- current density and low-voltage drop 
also make them great in power supplies, since they generate less heat, requiring 
smaller heat sinks to be used in design. Therefore, you’ll find both rectifier and fast- 
switching Schottky diodes listed in the catalogs.
Germanium diodes are used mostly in RF signal detection and low- level logic 
design due to their small threshold voltage of about 0.2 V. You do not see them in 
high- current rectifying applications, since they are weaker and leak more than silicon 
FIGURE 4.14  
Common Diode/Rectifier Packages

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    411
diodes when temperatures rise. In many applications, a good Schottky signal diode 
can replace a germanium diode.
4.2.4  Practical Considerations
Five major specs to consider when choosing a diode are peak inverse voltage, PIV; 
forward current- handling capacity, IO(max); response speed tR (time for diode to switch 
on and off); reverse- leakage current, IR(max); and maximum forward- voltage drop, 
VF(max). Each of these characteristics can be manipulated during the manufacturing 
process to produce the various special- purpose diodes. In rectification applications 
(e.g., power supplies, transient protection), the most important specs are PIV and 
current rating. The peak negative voltages that are stopped by the diode must be 
smaller in magnitude than the PIV, and the peak current through the diode must be 
less than IO(max). In fast and low- voltage applications, tR and VF become important 
characteristics to consider. In the applications section that follows, you’ll get a better 
sense of what all these specs mean.

Reverse- Polarity Protection
Battery reversal or power polarity reversal can be fatal to portable equipment. The 
best design is to use a mechanical block to safeguard against reverse installation. 
However, even momentarily fumbling around and making contacts can lead to 
problems. This is especially true for one or more single- cell battery applications that 
use AA- alkaline, NiCad, and NiMH batteries. For these systems you must ensure 
that any flow of reverse current is low enough to avoid damaging the circuit or the 
battery.
Diodes come in a variety of different packages. Some are standard two- lead deals; 
others are high- power packages with heat- sink attachments (e.g., TO- 220, DO- 5). 
Some come in surface- mount packages, and others contain diode arrays in IC form, 
used for switching applications. Dual- diode and diode- bridge rectifiers also come in 
a variety of package sizes and shapes for varying power levels.

Voltage Regulator
FIGURE 4.15  
FIGURE 4.16 
Here’s a spin- off of the last circuit, making use of the 
three diodes to create a simple regulated (steady) low- 
voltage output equal to the sum of the threshold volt-
ages of the diodes: 0.6 V + 0.6 V + 0.6 V = 1.8 V. The 
series resistor is used to set the desired output current 
(I) and should be less than the value calculated using 
the following formula, but not so low that it exceeds 
the power ratings of itself and the diodes:

S =

Diodes and the series resistor must have proper power 
ratings for the amount of current drawn. Use P = IV. 
Note that for higher- power critical voltage sources, 
you’ll typically use a zener diode regulator or, more 
commonly, a special regulator IC instead.
When current passes through a diode, there is a voltage drop 
across it of about 0.6 V, for a silicon p- n junction diode. 
(Germanium diodes have around a 0.2- V drop; Schottky, 
around 0.4 V—all these values vary slightly, depending on 
the specific diode used.) By placing a number of diodes in 
series, the total voltage drop across the combination is the 
sum of the individual voltage drops across each diode. Volt-
age droppers are often used in circuits where a fixed small 
voltage difference between two sections of a circuit is needed. 
Unlike resistors that can be used to lower the voltage, the diode 
arrangement typically  doesn’t waste as much power to resis-
tive heating and will supply a stiffer regulated voltage that 
is less dependent on current variations. Later in this chapter, 
you’ll see that a single zener diode can often replace a mul-
tiple series diode arrangement like the one shown here.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    413
Here’s a more practical example for driving a relay 
that contains an extra diode placed across a tran-
sistor driver in order to protect the transistor from 
damage due to inductive spikes generated from the 
relay’s coil when the transistor is turned off. This 
arrangement also deadens spikes during turn- on 
time. This dual diode arrangement is sometimes 
used in voltage regulator circuits, where one diode 
is wired from the output to the input and another 
is wired from ground to the output. This prevents 
any attached loads from sending damaging spikes 
back into the IC’s output.
FIGURE 4.17  Series diode: This is the simplest battery- reversal protection. It can be used with external power connections, 
too—plug- and- jack. The diode allows current from a correctly installed battery to flow to load, but blocks current flow from 
a backward- installed battery. The drawback with a series diode is that the diode must handle the full load current. Also, 
the forward voltage drop of the diode shortens the equipment’s operating time—cuts off about 0.6 V right away. Schottky 
diodes with low thresholds can do better. See Problem 1 at the end of Sec. 4.2 for another reverse- polarity protection circuit.
Parallel diode: In applications that call for alkaline or other batteries that have high output impedances, you can guard 
against reverse installations by using a parallel (shunt) diode, while eliminating the diode’s voltage drop. This approach 
protects the load but draws high current from the backward- installed battery. The diode must be properly rated for current 
and power. Another application of the parallel diode is in meter protection, where it acts to divert large currents entering 
the negative terminal of the meter.
Note: In more sophisticated battery- powered designs, special ICs or transistor arrangements are used to provide essen-
tially zero voltage drop protection, while providing a number of other special features, such as reverse polarity protection, 
thermal shutdown, and voltage level monitor.
When current flowing through an inductor is sud-
denly switched off, the collapsing magnetic field 
will generate a high- voltage spike in the inductor’s 
coils. This voltage spike or transient may have an 
amplitude of hundreds or even thousands of volts. 
This is particularly common within relay coils. A 
diode—referred to as a fly- back diode for this type 
of application—placed across the relay’s coil can 
protect neighboring circuitry by providing a short 
circuit for the high- voltage spike. It also protects 
the relay’s mechanical contacts, which often get 
viciously slapped shut during an inductive spike. 
Notice, however, that the diode is ineffective 
during turn- on time. Select a rectifier diode with  
sufficient power ratings (1N4001, 1N4002, etc.). 
Schottky rectifiers (e.g., 1N5818) work well, too.
FIGURE 4.18  
Transient Suppression with Fly- Back Diodes

414    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 4.18  (Continued)
Here’s another example of how inductive kickback 
from a motor that is running and then suddenly 
turned off can generate a voltage transient that 
can potentially damage connected electronics—in 
this case, a 2N2907 transistor. The diode reroutes 
or shorts the induced voltage to the opposite ter-
minal of the motor. Here a 1N5818 Schottky diode 
is used—though you could use other p- n junction 
types, too. The Schottky diode happens to be a bit 
faster and will clip the transient voltage a bit lower 
down—at around 0.4 V.
Note: Devices such as TVs and varistors are  
specially designed for transient suppression. See 
the section on transient suppressors later in this  
chapter.
FIGURE 4.19
In the adjustable waveform clipper cir-
cuit, the maximum output is clipped to a 
level determined by the resistance of the 
potentiometer. The idea is to set the nega-
tive end of the diode to about 0.6 V lower 
than the maximum desired output level, 
to account for the forward voltage drop of 
the diode. That’s what the potentiometer 
is intended to do. +V should be a volt or 
so higher than the peak input voltage.
The adjustable attenuator is similar to the 
last circuit, but the additional opposing 
diode allows for clipping on both positive 
and negative swings. You can use separate 
potentiometers if you want separate posi-
tive and negative clipping level control. 
+V should be a volt or so higher than the 
peak input voltage.
The diode voltage clamp provides dc 
restoration of a signal that has been 
 ac- coupled (capacitively coupled). This is 
important for circuits whose inputs look 
like diodes (e.g., a transistor with ground-
ed emitter); otherwise, an ac- couple  signal 
would fade away.
Diode Clamps
Diode clamps are used to clip signal levels, or they can shift an ac waveform up or 
down to create what’s called a pulsing dc waveform—one that  doesn’t cross the 0- V 
reference.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    415
FIGURE 4.20  
Full- wave center- tap rectifier: This commonly 
used circuit is basically two combined half- 
wave rectifiers that transform both halves 
of an ac wave into a pulsing dc signal. When 
designing power supplies, you need only two 
diodes, provided you use a center- tap trans-
former. The average output voltage is 0.9 Vrms 
of half the transformer secondary; this is the 
maximum that can be obtained with a suitable 
choke- input filter. The peak output voltage 
is 1.4 ë Vrms of half the transformer second-
ary; this is the maximum voltage that can be 
 obtained from a capacitor- input filter. The PIV 
impressed on each diode is independent of the 
type of load at the output. This is because the 
peak inverse voltage condition occurs when 
diode A conducts and diode B does not con-
duct. As the cathodes of diodes A and B reach 
a positive peak (1.4 Vrms), the anode of diode 
B is at the negative peak, also 1.4 Vrms, but in 
the opposite direction. The total peak inverse 
voltage is therefore 2.8 Vrms. The frequency of 
the output pulses is twice that of the half- wave 
rectifier, and thus comparatively less filtering 
is required. Since the diodes work alternately, 
each handles half of the load current. The cur-
rent rating of each rectifier need be only half 
the total current drawn from the supply.
In the diode switch circuit, an input waveform 
is ac- coupled to the diode through C1 at the 
input and C2 at the output. R2 provides a refer-
ence for the bias voltage. When the switch is 
thrown to the ON position, a positive dc volt-
age is added to the signal, forward- biasing the 
diode and allowing the signal to pass. When 
the switch is thrown to the OFF position, the 
negative dc voltage added to the signal reverse-  
biases the diode and the signal does not get 
through.
FIGURE 4.19  (Continued)
Half- wave rectifier: Used to transform an ac 
signal into pulsing dc by blocking the negative 
swings. A filter is usually added (especially in 
low- frequency applications) to the output to 
smooth out the pulses and provide a higher aver-
age dc voltage. The peak inverse voltage (PIV)—
the voltage that the rectifier must withstand 
when it isn’t conducting—varies with load, and 
must be greater than the peak ac voltage (1.4 ë 
Vrms). With a capacitor filter and a load drawing 
little or no current, it can rise to 2.8 ë Vrms (capaci-
tor voltage minus the peak negative swing of 
voltage from transformer secondary).

416    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Half- wave voltage doubler: Takes an ac input  
voltage and outputs a dc voltage that is  
approximately equal to twice the input’s peak 
voltage (or 2.8 times the input’s RMS voltage). 
(The actual multiplication factor may differ 
slightly, depending on the capacitor, resistor, 
and load values.) In this circuit, we take VIN 
to mean the secondary voltage from the trans-
former. During the first negative half cycle, 
DA conducts, charging C1 to the peak rectified 
voltage VIN (peak), or 1.4 VIN (RMS). During the 
positive half cycle of the secondary voltage, 
DA is cut off and DB conducts, charging capaci-
tor C2. The voltage delivered to C2 is the sum 
of the transformer peak secondary voltage, 
VIN (peak) plus the voltage stored in C1, which 
is the same, so the sum gives 2 VIN (peak), or 
2.8 VIN (RMS). On the next negative cycle, DB 
is nonconducting and C2 will discharge into an  
attached load. If no load is present, the capaci-
tors will remain charged—C1 to 1.4 VIN (RMS), 
C2 to 2.8 VIN (RMS). When a load is connected to 
the output, the voltage across C2 drops during 
the negative half cycle and is recharged up to 
2.8 VIN (RMS) during the positive half cycle. The 
output waveform across C2 resembles that of a 
half- wave rectifier circuit because C2 is pulsed 
once every cycle. Figure 4.21 shows levels to 
which the two capacitors are charged through-
out the cycle. In actual operation, the capacitor 
will not discharge all the way to zero, as shown.
Full- wave doubler: During the positive half cycle of the transformer secondary voltage, DA conducts charging C1 to VIN 
(peak) or 1.4 VIN (RMS). During the negative half cycle, DB conducts, charging C2 to the same value. The output voltage is the 
sum of the two capacitor voltages, which will be 2 VIN (peak) or 2.8 VIN (RMS) under no- load conditions. The graph shows 
each capacitor alternately receiving a charge once per cycle. The effective filter capacitance is that of C1 and C2 in series, 
which is less than the capacitance of either C1 or C2 alone. R1 and R2 are used to limit the surge current through the rectifiers. 
Their values are based on the transformer voltage and the rectifier surge current rating, since at the instant the power sup-
ply is turned on, the filter capacitors look like a short- circuited load. Provided the limiting resistors can withstand the surge 
current, their current- handling capacity is based on the maximum load current from the supply. The peak inverse voltage 
across each diode is 2.8 VIN (RMS).
Voltage Multiplier Circuits
FIGURE 4.20  (Continued)
Full- wave bridge rectifier: This rectifier pro-
duces a similar output as the last full- wave 
rectifier, but  doesn’t require a center- tap trans-
former. To understand how the device works, 
follow the current through the diode one- way 
gates. Note that there will be at least a 1.2- V 
drop from zero- to- peak input voltage to 
zero- to- peak output voltage (there are two 
0.6- V drops across a pair of diodes during a 
half cycle). The average dc output voltage into 
a resistive load or choke- input filter is 0.9 ë Vrms 
of the transformer’s secondary; with a capaci-
tor filter and a light load, the maximum output 
voltage is 1.4 ë Vrms. The inverse voltage across 
each diode is 1.4 Vrms; there the PIV of each 
diode is more than 1.4 Vrms.
See the following text for the pros and cons 
of the various rectifier configurations.
FIGURE 4.21  

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    417
Pros and Cons of the Rectifier Circuits
Comparing the full- wave center- tap rectifier and the full- wave bridge rectifier, 
you’ll notice both circuits have almost the same rectifier requirements. However, 
the center- tap version has half the number of diodes as the bridge. These diodes 
will require twice the maximum inverse voltage ratings of the bridge diodes (PIV 
> 2.8 Vrms, as opposed to >1.4 Vrms). The diode current ratings are identical for the 
two circuits. The bridge makes better use of the transformer’s secondary than 
the center- tap rectifier, since the transformer’s full winding supplies power dur-
ing both half cycles, while each half of the center- tap circuit’s secondary provides 
power only during its positive half- cycle. This is often referred to as the transformer 
utilization factor, which is unity for the bridge configuration and 0.5 for the full- 
wave center- tap configuration.
The bridge rectifier is often not as popular as the full- wave center- tap rectifier in 
high- current, low- voltage applications. This is because the two forward- conducting 
series- diode voltage drops in the bridge introduce a volt or more of additional loss, 
and thus consume more power (heat loss) than a single diode would within a full- 
wave rectifier.
In regard to the half- wave configuration, it’s rarely used in 60- Hz rectification for 
other than bias supplies. It does see considerable use, however, in high- frequency 
switching power supplies in what are called forward converter and fly- back con-
verter topologies.
Voltage tripler: On one half of the ac cycle, C1 and C3 
are charged to VIN (peak) through D1, D2, and D3. On the 
 opposite half of the cycle, D2 conducts and C2 is charged 
to twice VIN (peak), because it sees the transformer plus 
the charge in C1 as its source. (D1 is cut off during this 
half cycle.) At the same time, D3 conducts, and with the 
transformer and the charge in C2 as the source, C3 is 
charged to three times the transformer voltage.
Voltage quadrupler: Works in a similar manner as the 
previous one. In both these circuits, the output voltage 
will approach an exact multiple of the peak ac voltage 
when the output current drain is low and the capaci-
tance values high.
Capacitance values are usually 20 to 50 µF, depend-
ing on the output current drain. Capacitor dc ratings are 
related to VIN (peak) by:
C1—Greater than VIN (peak) or 0.7 VIN (RMS)
C2—Greater than 2 VIN (peak) or 1.4 VIN (RMS)
C3—Greater than 3 VIN (peak) or 2.1 VIN (RMS)
C4—Greater than 4 VIN (peak) or 2.8 VIN (RMS)

Diode Logic Gates
FIGURE 4.23  These simple diode logic gates are useful for learning the basics of digital logic, and can also be adapted 
for non- logic- level electronics (e.g., higher- voltage and power analog- like circuits)—see the following battery- backup 
 example (Fig. 4.24). When designing high- power circuits, make sure your diodes have the proper PIV and current ratings 
for the job. It’s also important to note that the recovery time of power diodes won’t be as fast as digital logic ICs or fast- 
switching diodes.
Battery Backup
FIGURE 4.24  
Devices are powered by a wall adapter with 
battery backup, typically diode- OR for the bat-
tery and wall- adapter connections, as shown in 
Fig. 4.24. Normally if the switch is closed, power 
is delivered to the load from the 12- V wall 
adapter through D1; D2 is reverse- biased (off), 
since its negative end is 2.4V more  positive than 
its positive end. If power is interrupted (switch 
opened), D1 stops conducting, and the battery 
kicks in, sending current through D2 into the load; 
D1 blocks current from flowing back into the wall 
adapter. There is a penalty for using diodes 
for  battery backup, however, since the diode 
in series with the battery limits the minimum 
voltage at which the battery can supply power 
(around a 0.6- V drop for silicon p- n junction,  
0.4 V for Schottky). Better battery- backup  designs 
implement transistors or special ICs that con-
tain an internal comparator which switches over 
 battery power through a low- resistance transistor 
without the 0.6- V penalty. Check out MAXIM’s 
website for some example ICs.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    419
AM Detector
Diodes are often used in the detection of ampli-
tude modulated (AM) signals, as demonstrated 
in the simple AM radio in Fig. 4.25. Within an 
AM radio signal, an RF carrier signal of con-
stant high frequency (550 to 1700 kHz) has 
been amplitude modulated with an audio sig-
nal (10 to 20,000 Hz). The audio information is 
located in duplicate in both upper and lower 
sidebands, or the envelope of the AM signal. 
Here, an antenna and LC- tuning circuit act to 
“resonate” in on the specific carrier frequency 
of  interest (transform radio signal into corre-
sponding electrical signal). A signal diode (e.g., 
1N34) is then used to rectify out the negative 
portion of the incoming signal so it can be ma-
nipulated by the next dc stages. The rectified 
signal is then stripped of its high- frequency 
carrier by passing through a low- pass filter. 
The output signal is the audio signal. This 
signal can be used to drive a simple crystal 
earpiece, a modern sensitive headphone, or a 
telephone  receiver earpiece. (Low- impedance 
earphones or speakers will require additional 
amplification via a  coupling capacitor of 1 lF 
or so.)
FIGURE 4.25
Schottky diode termination can be used to counteract the high- speed 
transmission line effects, which cause over/undershoots from signal 
reflections, reduce noise margins, and destroy timing. These types of 
distortions can cause false triggering in clock lines and erroneous data 
on address, data, and control lines, as well as contribute significantly to 
clock and signal jitter. For applications where transmission line imped-
ance is variable or unknown, it’s not possible to specify a termination 
resistance value—an alternative is needed. The Schottky diode termina-
tion has the ability to maintain signal integrity, save significant power, 
and permit flexible system design. A Schottky diode termination con-
sists of a diode series combination, where one diode clamps to VCC, or 
supply voltage, and the other to ground. The diodes at the end of the 
transmission line minimize the effect of reflection via a clamping opera-
tion. The top diode clamps voltages that exceed VCC by the forward- bias 
threshold limit. This clamping will minimize overshoots caused by 
reflections. For falling edge signals, a clamp diode to ground affects a 
similar termination. This clamping function does not depend on match-
ing the transmission line characteristic impedance, making it useful in 
situations where the line impedance is unknown or variable.

Read- Only Memory (ROM)
FIGURE 4.27  
FIGURE 4.28  The reverse- bias direction is the standard configuration used in most applications, along with a series 
resistor. In this configuration, the zener diode acts like a pressure release value, passing as much current as necessary to 
keep the voltage across it constant, equal to VZ. In other words, it can act as a voltage regulator. See application in Fig. 4.29.
This circuit is a simple read- only memory 
(ROM) made with diodes. Here, the ROM 
acts as a decimal- to- binary encoder. With 
no buttons pressed, all LEDs are lit. If 
1 is pressed, current from the supply is 
diverted away from the 23, 22, and 21 lines 
via the diodes to ground, but is allowed to 
pass on the 20 line, thus presenting 0001 on 
the LED readout. In reality, using a PROM 
such as this for encoding—or anything 
else, for that matter—isn’t practical. Usu-
ally there is a special encoder IC you buy 
or you simply take care of the encoding—
say, with a multiplexed keypad that’s  
interfaced with a microcontroller—the 
 actual encoding is taken care of at the pro-
gramming level. At any rate, it’s a fun cir-
cuit, and this gives you a basic idea of how 
read- only memory works.
4.2.6  Zener Diodes
A zener diode acts like a two- way gate to current flow. In the forward direction, 
it’s easy to push open; only about 0.6 V—just like a standard diode. In the reverse 
direction, it’s harder to push open; it requires a voltage equal to the zener’s breakdown 
voltage VZ. This breakdown voltage can be anywhere between 1.8 and 200 V, depend-
ing on the model (1N5225B = 3.0 V, 1N4733A = 5.1 V, 1N4739A = 9.1 V, etc.). Power 
ratings vary from around 0.25 to 50 W.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    421
Zener Voltage Regulator
These circuits act as voltage regulators, preventing any supply voltage or load cur-
rent variations from pulling down the voltage supplied to the load. The following 
explains how the zener diode compensates for both line and load variations.
FIGURE 4.29  Line regulation example: If the line voltage increases, it will cause an increase in line current. Since the load 
voltage is constant (maintained by the zener), the increase in line current will result in an increase in zener current, thus 
maintaining a constant load current. If the line voltage decreases, less line current results, and less current is passed by the 
zener. See graph in Fig. 4.29, top right.
Load regulation example: If the load voltage attempts to decrease as a result of decreased load resistance (increased load 
current), the increase in load current is offset by the decrease in zener current. The voltage across the load will remain 
fairly constant. If the load voltage attempts to increase due to an increase in load resistance (decrease in load current), the 
decrease in load current is offset by an increase in zener current. See graph in Fig. 4.29, bottom right.

Note that zener regulators are somewhat temperature dependent and aren’t the best choice for critical applications. 
A linear regulator IC, though more expensive, is less dependent on temperature variations due to an internal error ampli-
fier. They do typically use an internal zener to supply the reference, nonetheless.

FIGURE 4.31
Here’s a method for obtaining a split supply 
from a non- center- tapped transformer  using 
two zener diodes. Z1 and Z2 are selected of 
equal voltage and power rating for desired 
split voltage and load. As with the previous 
example, the temperature dependency of the 
zener diodes makes this arrangement less 
 accurate than a supply that uses two separate 
regulator ICs. However, it’s a simple alterna-
tive for noncritical applications. See Chap. 11 
on power supplies.
Waveform Modifier and Limiter
FIGURE 4.32
Two opposing zener diodes act to clip both halves of 
an  input signal. Here a sine wave is converted to a near 
squarewave. Besides acting to reshape a waveform, this 
arrangement can also be placed across the output terminal 
of a dc power supply to prevent unwanted voltage tran-
sients from reaching an attached load. The breakdown 
voltages in that case must be greater than the supply volt-
age, but smaller than the maximum allowable transient 
voltage. A single bidirectional TVS does the same thing—
see the section on transient suppressors.
4.2.7  Zener Diode Applications
Split Supply from Single Transformer Winding
Voltage Shifter
FIGURE 4.33
This circuit shifts the input voltage down by an 
amount equal to the breakdown voltage of the 
 zener diode. As the input goes positive, the zener 
 doesn’t go into breakdown until it reaches 5.1 V 
(for the 1N5281B). After that, the output follows 
the input, but shifted 5.1 V below it. When the 
 input goes negative, the output will follow the 
 input, but shifted by 0.6 V—the forward thresh-
old voltage drop of the zener.
Voltage Regulator Booster
FIGURE 4.34
Zener diodes can be used to raise the level of a voltage regulator and obtain dif-
ferent regulated voltage outputs. Here 3- V and 6- V zener diodes are placed in 
series to push the reference ground of a 5 V regulator IC up 9 V to a total of 14 V. 
Note that in real designs, capacitors may be required at the input and output. See 
the section on voltage regulator ICs.

4.2.8  Varactor Diodes (Variable Capacitance Diodes)
A varactor or variable capacitance diode (also called a varicap) is a diode whose junc-
tion capacitance can be altered with an applied reverse voltage. In this way, it acts as 
a variable capacitor. As the applied reverse voltage increases, the width of its junction 
increases, which decreases its capacitance. The typical capacitance range for varac-
tors ranges from a few picofarads to over 100 pF, with a maximum reverse voltage 
range from a few volts to close to a hundred volts, depending on device. (Many stan-
dard diodes and zener diodes can be used as inexpensive varactor diodes, though the 
relationship between reverse voltage and capacitance isn’t always as reliable.)
Overvoltage Protection
FIGURE 4.35
Increasing Wattage Rating of Zener
FIGURE 4.36
Here’s a simple circuit that effectively increases the wattage rating 
 (current- handling capacity) of a zener diode by letting a power transis-
tor take care of the majority of the regulating current. The zener itself 
takes a small portion of the total current and creates a base voltage/
current (with the help of the base- to- ground resistor) that changes the 
collector- to- emitter current flow according to any variations in line or 
load current.
Simple LED Voltmeter
FIGURE 4.37
Here’s a simple circuit voltmeter that uses 
the sequence of zener diodes with increasing 
breakdown voltages. LEDs glow in sequence as 
the input voltage rises. It’s okay to use differ-
ent zener diodes so long as the series resistors 
limit current through LED to a safe level. Most 
LEDs are happiest around 20 mA or so. You can 
calculate the worst- case scenario to be at the  
5 V LED leg when Vin = 16 V. If you’re looking 
for more sophistication, you can always use  
an analog- to- digital converter, along with a 
microcontroller and LCD or LED display.
If excessive voltage is applied to the jack (say, via an incorrectly rated 
wall plug- in supply), the zener diode will conduct until the fuse is 
blown. The breakdown voltage of the zener should be slightly above 
the maximum tolerable voltage that the load can handle. Either a fast-  or 
a slow- blow fuse can be used, depending on the sensitivity of the load. 
The current and voltage ratings of the fuse must be selected according to 
the expected limits of the application. Note that there are other, similar 
overvoltage protection designs that use special devices, such as TVSs and 
varistors. These devices are cheap and are very popular in design today.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    425
The low capacitance levels provided by a varactor usually limit its use to high- 
frequency RF circuits, where the applied voltage is used to change the capacitance of 
an oscillator circuit. The reverse voltage may be applied via a tuning potentiometer, 
which acts to change the overall frequency of an oscillator, or it may be applied by 
a modulating signal (e.g., audio signal), which acts to FM- modulate the oscillator’s 
high- frequency carrier. See the examples that follow.
When designing with varactor diodes, the reverse- bias voltage must be abso-
lutely free of noise, since any variation in the bias voltage will cause changes in 
capacitance. Unwanted frequency shifts or instability will result if the reverse- bias 
voltage is noisy. Filter capacitors are used to limit such noise.
Varactors come in both single and dual forms. The dual varactor configuration 
contains two varactors in series- opposing configuration, with common anodes and 
separate cathodes. In this configuration, the varactors acts as series capacitors that 
change capacitance levels together when a voltage is applied to the common anode 
lead. See Fig. 4.39.
Oscillator with Pot- Controlled Varactor Tuning
FIGURE 4.39
Unlike the preceding circuit, this circuit acts 
simply as a variable high- frequency oscillator, 
whose frequency is varied via a  potentiometer 
(R1). The voltage from the pot is  applied to a 
dual varactor diode D1 through a low- frequency 
filter (C1, R2) to ensure that the varactor bias is 
clean dc. This alters the  effective capacitance 
of the D1- L1 tuned circuit, which changes the 
frequency of the entire oscillator. C2 and C6 
are dc- blocking (ac- coupling) capacitors. Q1 is 
an N- channel JFET in common drain configu-
ration with feedback to the gate through C3. R3 
is the gate bias resistor. R4 is the drain voltage 
resistor with filter capacitor C5.
FM Modulator
FIGURE 4.38
FM modulation: FM (frequency modulation) 
is produced when the frequency of a carrier is 
changed instantaneously according to the mag-
nitude of an applied modulating signal. (The fre-
quency of the carrier is usually in the megahertz, 
while the modulating signal is typically in the 
hertz to kilohertz range, e.g., audio modulating 
radio signal.) One way to produce FM is to use a 
voltage- controlled oscillator. The oscillator will 
have an output frequency proportional to the 
modulating signal’s amplitude. As the ampli-
tude of the modulating signal increases, the fre-
quency of the carrier increases. Here a  Colpitts 
LC oscillator uses a varactor diode in place of 
one of its regulator capacitors that form the 
tuned circuit. The modulating voltage is applied 
across the diode and changes the diode’s capaci-
tance in proportion. This causes the oscillator 
frequency to change, thus generating FM in the 
process. L2 (RFC) is a radiofrequency choke that 
prevents high- frequency signals from feeding  
back into the modulating source. C3 and C4 are 
ac- coupling capacitors. The rest of the compo-
nents go into making the Colpitts oscillator.

426    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
4.2.9  PIN Diodes
PIN diodes are used as RF and microwave switches. To high- frequency signals, the 
PIN diode acts like a variable resistor whose value is controlled by an applied dc  
forward- bias current. With a high dc forward bias, the resistance is often less than an 
ohm. But with a small forward bias, the resistance appears very large (kiloohms) to 
high- frequency signals. PIN diodes are constructed with a layer of intrinsic (undoped) 
semiconductor placed between very highly doped p- type and n- type material, creat-
ing a PIN junction.
In terms of application, PIN diodes are used primarily as RF and microwave 
switches—even at high power levels. A common application is their use as transmit/
receive switches in transceivers operating from 100 MHz and up. They are also used 
as photodetectors in fiber- optic systems. For the most part, you’ll never need to use 
them, unless you are a graduate student in electrical engineering or physics, or are 
working for a high- tech firm.
RF Switching with PIN Diodes
FIGURE 4.40
At RF frequencies, switching is very finicky, 
 requiring special design techniques to minimize 
signal contamination and degradation. Here 
are two switching circuits that make use of PIN  
diodes. In the SPST switch circuit, a signal from 
a RF generator (VG), can be allowed to pass, or 
can be prevented from passing to the load by 
applying a bias voltage to the PIN diode. The 
RFC is a high- frequency choke to prevent RF 
from entering bias supply, while the capacitor 
to ground is used to supply clean dc at the bias 
input. The SPDT switch circuit is similar to the 
first, but with, of course, two bias inputs.
4.2.10  Microwave Diodes (IMPATT, Gunn, Tunnel, etc.)
There are a number of diodes that you’ll probably never have to use, but they are 
around nevertheless. These diodes are used for very special purposes at the high- 
frequency end—microwave and millimeter wave (>20 GHz) range, often in micro-
wave amplifiers and oscillators. Most standard diodes and bipolar transistors usually 
won’t cut it at such high speeds, due to the relatively slow diffusion or migration of 
charge carriers across semiconductor junctions. With the tunnel, Gunn, IMPATT, and 
other diodes, the variable effects that lead to useful alterations in, say, an amplifier’s 
gain or an oscillator’s resonant frequency involve entirely different physics—physics 
that allows for alterations at essentially the speed of light. The physics may be elec-
tron tunneling (through electrostatic barrier separating p- type and n- type regions, 
rather than being thermionically emitted over the barrier, as generally occurs in a 
diode)—tunnel diode. Or it may be due to a negative resistance at forward biasing 
because of an increase in effective mass (slowing down) of electrons due to com-
plex conduction band symmetry—Gunn diodes. It may also be a negative resistance 
resulting in electrons moving to higher, less mobile bands, reducing current flow 
with applied forward bias—IMPATT diodes. Anyway, you get the idea—it’s hairy 
high- frequency stuff that should probably be left to the experts. (Note: TRAPATT and 
Baritt diodes are also used in microwave applications.)

4.2.11 Problems
Problem 1: What does this circuit do? What’s the final output voltage? What are 
the individual voltage drops across each diode with plug tip- positive and plug tip- 
negative? (Assume each diode has a 0.6  V forward voltage drop.) To prevent diode 
meltdown, what would be the minimum load resistance, assuming 1N4002 diodes?
FIGURE 4.41
FIGURE 4.42
FIGURE 4.43
Answer: Polarity protection circuit that will output the same polarity regardless of the 
polarity applied to input. The final output voltage is 11.4 V. Tip- positive: VD1 = 0.6 V, 
VD2 = 11.4 V, VD3 = 11.4 V, VD4 = 0.6 V; Tip- negative: VD1 = 11.4 V, VD2 = 0.6 V, VD3 = 0.6 V, 
VD4 = 11.4 V. Load resistance should not drop below 11.4 Ω, assuming 1N4002 diodes, 
since they have a maximum current rating of 1 A. It’s a good idea to keep the current 
to around 75 percent of the maximum value for safety, so 15 Ω would be a better limit.
Problem 2: What does the output look like for the circuit to the left in Fig. 4.42? What 
happens if a load of 2.2K is attached to the output?
Answer: Clamp circuit, where the output is shifted so that it’s practically pure alter-
nating dc, for the exception of a 0.6  V negative dip due to the diode drop. This gives 
a maximum peak of 27.6 V and a minimum of −0.6 V. (Recall Vpeak = 1.41 × Vrms.) With 
the load attached, the output level decreases slightly—the capacitor/load resistor 
acts like a high- pass filter, with a cutoff frequency of 1/(2πRC). In simulation, the 
output goes to 8.90 V(RMS) or 24.5 peak, −0.6 V minimum.
Problem 3: A 10- to 50- mA load requires a regulated 8.2 V. With a 12 V ± 10 percent 
power supply and 8.2  V zener diode. What series resistance is required? Assume 
from the data sheets (or experimentation) that the zener diode’s minimum regulation 
current is 10 mA. Determine the power ratings for the resistor and zener diode.
Answer: Vin,max = 13.2 V, Vin,min = 10.8 V: RS = (10.8 V − 8.2 V)/(10 mA + 50 mA) = 43 Ω; 
PR = (13.2 V − 8.2 V)2/(43 Ω) = 0.58 W; PZ = 8.2 V(13.2 V − 8.2 V)/(43 Ω) = 0.95 W. See 
Fig. 4.29 for details.

DIODE TYPE
SYMBOL
MODE OF OPERATION
p- n Junction
Acts as one- way gate to current- flow, from anode (A) to 
cathode (C). Comes in silicon and germanium types. Both 
require a forward- bias voltage to conduct; typically 0.6
to 1.7 V for silicon, and 0.2 to 0.4 V for germanium.
Used in rectification, transient suppression, voltage  
multiplication, RF demodulation, analog logic, clamps, fast  
switches, and voltage regulation.
Schottky
Similar in operation to p- n junction diode, but designed with  
special metal semiconductor junction instead of a p- n  
junction. This provides for extremely low junction capacitance  
that stores less charge. Results of this junction yield quicker
switching times, useful in fast clamping and high- frequency  
applications approaching the gigahertz range. Also, generally  
has a lower forward- bias voltage of around 0.4 V (average)— 
but can be from 0.15 to 0.9 V or more. Used in similar  
applications as p- n junction diode, but offers better low- signal  
level detection, speed, and low- power loss in rectification due  
to low forward threshold.
Zener
Conducts from A to C like p- n junction diode, but will also  
conduct from C to A if the applied reverse voltage is greater  
than the zener’s breakdown voltage rating VZ. Acts like a  
voltage- sensitive control valve. Comes with various breakdown  
voltages—1.2 V, 3.0 V, 5.1 V, 6.3 V, 9 V, 12 V, etc., and power  
ratings. Applications include voltage regulation, waveform  
clipping, voltage shifting, and transient suppression.
LED & Laser
Light- emitting diode (LED) emits a near constant wavelength of  
light when forward- biased (A > C) by a voltage of about 1.7 V.  
Comes in various wavelengths (IR through visible), sizes, power  
ratings, etc. Used as indicator and emitting source in IR and  
light- wave communications. Laser diode is similar to LED, but  
provides a much narrower wavelength spectrum (about 1 nm  
 compared to around 40 nm for LED), usually in the IR region.  
They have very fast response times (lns). These features provide  
clean signal characteristics useful in fiber- optic systems, where  
minimized dispersion effects, efficient coupling, and limited  
degradation over long distances are important. They are also  
used in laser pointers, CD/DVD players, bar- code readers, and  
in various surgical applications.
Photo
Generates a current when exposed to light, or can be used to  
alter current flow passing through it when the light intensity  
changes. Operates in reverse- bias direction (current flows from  
C to A) when exposed to light. Current increases with light  
intensity. Very fast response times (ns). Not as sensitive as  
phototransistors, but their linearity can make them useful in  
simple light meters.
Varactor 
(Varicap)
Acts like a voltage- sensitive variable capacitor, whose  
capacitance decreases as the reverse- bias voltage on the  
diode increases. Designed with a junction specifically
formulated to have a relatively large range of capacitance  
values for a modest range of reverse- bias voltages. Capacitance 
range in the picofarad range, so they are usually limited to RF  
applications, such as tuning receivers and generating FM.
PIN,  
IMPATT Gunn, 
Tunnel, 
etc.
Most of these are resistance devices used in RF, microwave,  
and millimeter wave applications (e.g., amplifiers and  
oscillators). Unique conduction physics yields much faster  
response times when compared to standard diodes that use  
charge carrier dispersion across a p- n junction.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    429
4.3  Transistors
Transistors are semiconductor devices that act as either electrically controlled switches 
or amplifier controls. The beauty of transistors is the way they can control electric 
current flow in a manner similar to the way a faucet controls the flow of water. With 
a faucet, the flow of water is controlled by a control knob. With a transistor, a small 
voltage and/or current applied to a control lead acts to control a larger electric flow 
through its other two leads.
Transistors are used in almost every electric circuit you can imagine. For example, 
you find transistors in switching circuits, amplifier circuits, oscillator circuits, current- 
source circuits, voltage- regulator circuits, power- supply circuits, digital logic ICs, and 
almost any circuit that uses small control signals to control larger currents.
4.3.1  Introduction to Transistors
Transistors come in a variety of designs and come with unique control and current- 
flow features. Most transistors have a variable current- control feature, but a few do 
not. Some transistors are normally off until a voltage is applied to the base or gate, 
whereas others are normally on until a voltage is applied. (Here, normally refers to the 
condition when the control lead is open circuited. Also, on can represent a variable 
amount of current flow.) Some transistors require both a small current and a small 
voltage applied to their control lead to function, whereas others only require a volt-
age. Some transistors require a negative voltage and/or output current at their base 
lead (relative to one of their other two leads) to function, whereas others require a 
positive voltage and/or input current at their base.
The two major families of transistors are bipolar transistors and field- effect 
transistors (FETs). The major difference between these two families is that bipolar 
transistors require a biasing input (or output) current at their control leads, whereas 
FETs require only a voltage—practically no current. [Physically speaking, bipolar 
transistors require both positive (holes) and negative (electrons) carriers to operate, 
whereas FETs only require one charge carrier.] Because FETs draw little or no current, 
they have high input impedances (∼1014 Ω). This high input impedance means that 
the FET’s control lead will not have much influence on the current dynamics within 
the circuit that controls the FET. With a bipolar transistor, the control lead may draw 
a small amount of current from the control circuit, which then combines with the 
main current flowing through its other two leads, thus altering the dynamics of the 
control circuit. 
In reality, FETs are definitely more popular in circuit design today than bipolar 
transistors. Besides drawing essentially zero input- output current at their control 
leads, they are easier to manufacture, cheaper to make (require less silicon), and can 
be made extremely small—making them useful elements in integrated circuits. One 
drawback with FETs is in amplifier circuits, where their transconductance is much 
lower than that of bipolar transistors at the same current. This means that the voltage 
gain will not be as large. For simple amplifier circuits, FETs are seldom used unless 
extremely high input impedances and low input currents are required.
Table 4.4 provides an overview of some of the most popular transistors. Note that 
the term normally used in this chart refers to conditions where the control lead 

430    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
(e.g., base, gate) is shorted (is at the same potential) with one of its channel leads 
(e.g., emitter, source). Also, the terms on and off used in this chart are not to be taken 
too literally; the amount of current flow through a device is usually a variable quan-
tity, set by the magnitude of the control voltage. The transistors described in this chart 
will be discussed in greater detail later on in this chapter.
4.3.2  Bipolar Transistors
Bipolar transistors are three- terminal devices that act as electrically controlled 
switches or as amplifier controls. These devices come in either npn or pnp configu-
rations, as shown in Fig. 4.44. An npn bipolar transistor uses a small input current

and positive voltage at its base (relative to its emitter) to control a much larger  
collector- to- emitter current. Conversely, a pnp transistor uses a small output base  
current and negative base voltage (relative its emitter) to control a larger emitter- 
to- collector current.
An npn bipolar transistor is made by sandwiching a thin 
slice of p semiconductor between two n- type semiconduc-
tors. When no voltage is applied at the transistor’s base, 
electrons in the emitter are prevented from passing to the 
collector side because of the p-n junction. (Re member 
that for electrons to flow across a p-n junction, a biasing 
voltage is needed to give the electrons enough energy to 
“escape” the atomic forces holding them to the n side.) 
Notice that if a negative voltage is applied to the base, 
things get even worse—the p-n junction between the base 
and emitter becomes reverse-biased. As a result, a deple-
tion region forms and prevents current flow.
If a positive voltage (of at least 0.6 V) is applied to the base 
of an npn transistor, the pn junction between the base and 
emitter is forward-biased. During forward bias, escaping 
electrons are drawn to the positive base. Some electrons 
exit through the base, but—this is the trick—because 
the p- type base is so thin, the onslaught of electrons that 
leave the emitter get close enough to the collector side that 
they begin jumping into the collector. Increasing the base 
voltage increases this jumping effect and hence increases 
the emitter- to- collector electron flow. Remember that con-
ventional currents are moving in the opposite direction to 
the electron flow. Thus, in terms of conventional currents, 
a positive voltage and input current applied at the base 
cause a “positive” current I to flow from the collector to 
the emitter.

Bipolar transistors are incredibly useful devices. Their ability to control current 
flow by means of applied control signals makes them essential elements in electri-
cally controlled switching circuits, current- regulator circuits, voltage- regulator cir-
cuits, amplifier circuits, oscillator circuits, and memory circuits.

Theory
Figure 4.46 shows a typical characteristic curve for a bipolar transistor. This charac-
teristic curve describes the effects the base current IB and the emitter- to- collector volt-
age VEC have on the emitter/collector currents IE and IC. (As you will see in a second, 
IC is practically equal to IE.)

Some important terms used to describe a transistor’s operation include satura-
tion region, cutoff region, active mode/region, bias, and quiescent point (Q- point). 
Saturation region refers to a region of operation where maximum collector current 
flows and the transistor acts much like a closed switch from collector to emitter. Cutoff 
region refers to the region of operation near the voltage axis of the collector charac-
teristics graph, where the transistor acts like an open switch—only a very small leak-
age current flows in this mode of operation. Active mode/region describes transistor 
operation in the region to the right of saturation and above cutoff, where a near- linear 
relationship exists between terminal currents (IB, IC, IE). Bias refers to the specific dc 
terminal voltages and current of the transistor to set a desired point of active- mode 
operation, called the quiescent point, or Q- point.
The Formulas
The fundamental formula used to describe the behavior of a bipolar transistor 
(at least within the active region) is
IC = hFEIB = βIB

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    433
where IB is the base current, IC is the collector current, and hFE (also referred to as β) 
is the current gain. Every transistor has its own unique hFE. The hFE of a transistor is 
often taken to be a constant, typically around 10 to 500, but it may change slightly 
with temperature and with changes in collector- to- emitter voltage. (A transistor’s 
hFE is given in transistor spec tables.) A simple explanation of what the current- gain 
formula tells you is this: If you take a bipolar transistor with, say, an hFE of 100 and 
then feed (npn) or sink (pnp) a 1- mA current into (npn) or out of (pnp) its base, a col-
lector current of 100 mA will result. Now, it is important to note that the current- gain 
formula applies only if rules 1 and 2 are met, i.e., assuming the transistor is within the 
active region. Also, there is a limit to how much current can flow through a transistor’s 
terminals and a limit to the size of voltage that can be applied across them. We will 
discuss these limits later in the chapter (Fig. 4.47).
Now, if you apply the law of conservation of current (follow the arrows in 
Fig. 4.47), you get the following useful expression relating the emitter, collector, and 
base currents:
IE = IC + IB
SOME IMPORTANT RULES
Rule 1  For an npn transistor, the voltage at the collector VC must be greater 
than the voltage at the emitter VE by at least a few tenths of a volt; otherwise, 
current will not flow through the collector- emitter junction, no matter what 
the applied voltage is at the base. For pnp transistors, the emitter voltage must 
be greater than the collector voltage by a similar amount.
Rule 2  For an npn transistor, there is a voltage drop from the base to the 
emitter of 0.6 V. For a pnp transistor, there is a 0.6- V rise from base to emitter. 
In terms of operation, this means that the base voltage VB of an npn transistor 
must be at least 0.6 V greater than the emitter voltage VE; otherwise, the tran-
sistor will not pass an collector- to-emitter current. For a pnp transistor, VB must 
be at least 0.6 V less than VE; otherwise, it will not pass a collector- to- emitter 
current.

434    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
If you combine this equation with the current- gain equation, you can come up with 
an equation relating the emitter and base currents:
IE = (hFE + 1)IB
As you can see, this equation is almost identical to the current- gain equation (IC = 
hFEIB), with the exception of the +1 term. In practice, the +1 is insignificant as long as 
hFE is large (which is almost always the case). This means that you can make the fol-
lowing approximation:
IE ≈ IC
Finally, the second equation below is simply rule 2 expressed in mathematical 
form:
VBE = VB − VE = + 0.6 V (npn)
VBE = VB − VE = − 0.6 V (pnp)
Figure 4.47 shows how all the terminal currents and voltages are related. In the 
figure, notice that the collector voltage has a question mark next to it. As it turns out, 
the value of VC cannot be determined directly by applying the formulas. Instead, VC’s 
value depends on the network that is connected to it. For example, if you consider the 
setup shown in Fig. 4.48, you must find the voltage drop across the resistor in order 
to find the collector voltage. By applying Ohm’s law and using the current- gain rela-
tion, you can calculate VC. The results are shown in the figure.
It is important to note that the equations here are idealistic in form. In reality, 
these equations may result in “unreal” answers. For instance, they tend to “screw 
up” when the currents and voltages are not within the bounds provided by the char-
acteristic curves. If you apply the equations blindly, without considering the oper-
ating characteristics, you could end up with some wild results that are physically 
impossible.
One final note with regard to bipolar transistor theory involves what is called 
transresistance rtr. Transresistance represents a small resistance that is inherently pres-
ent within the emitter junction region of a transistor. Two things that determine the 
transresistance of a transistor are temperature and emitter current flow. The follow-
ing equation provides a rough approximation of the rtr:

VC = VCC −(hFEIB)R

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    435
In many cases, rtr is insignificantly small (usually well below 1000 Ω) and does not 
pose a major threat to the overall operation of a circuit. However, in certain types of 
circuits, treating rtr as being insignificant will not do. In fact, its presence may be the 
major factor determining the overall behavior of a circuit. We will take a closer look 
at transresistance later on in this chapter.
Here are a couple of problems that should help explain how the equations work. 
The first example deals with an npn transistor; the second deals with a pnp transistor.

436    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The base of the npn water transistor is repre-
sented by the smaller tube entering the main 
device from the left side. The collector is rep-
resented by the upper portion of the vertical 
tube, while the emitter is represented by the 
lower portion of the vertical tube. When no 
pressure or current is applied through the 
“base” tube (analogous to an npn transistor’s 
base being open circuited), the lower lever 
arm remains vertical while the top of this arm 
holds the upper main door shut. This state is 
analogous to a real bipolar npn transistor off 
state. In the water analogy, when a small cur-
rent and pressure are applied to the base tube, 
the vertical lever is pushed by the entering 
current and swings counterclockwise. When 
this lever arm swings, the upper main door 
is permitted to swing open a certain amount 
that is dependent on the amount of swing of 
the lever arm. In this state, water can make its 
way from the collector tube to the emitter tube, 
provided there is enough pressure to overcome 
the force of the spring holding the door shut. 
This spring force is analogous to the 0.6 V bi-
asing voltage needed to allow current through 
the collector- emitter channel. Notice that in 
this analogy, the small base water current com-
bines with the collector current.

The main feature to note here is the need for a 
lower pressure at the base for the pnp water tran-
sistor to turn on. By allowing current to flow 
out the base tube, the lever moves,  allowing 
the emitter- collector door to open. The degree 
of openness varies with the amount of swing 
in the lever arm, which corresponds to the 
amount of current escaping through the base 
tube. Again, note the 0.6 V biasing spring.

In the pnp circuit, everything is reversed; current must leave the base in 
order for a collector current to flow.
Basic Operation
TRANSISTOR SWITCH
Here, an npn transistor is used to control current flow through a light 
bulb. When the switch is thrown to the on position, the transistor is 
properly biased, and the collector- to- emitter channel opens, allowing 
current to flow from VCC through the light bulb and into ground. The 
amount of current entering the base is determined by

To find the collector current, you can use the current- gain relation (IC = 
hFEIB), provided that there is not too large a voltage drop across the light 
bulb (it  shouldn’t cause VC to drop below 0.6 V + VE). When the switch 
is thrown to the off position, the base is set to ground, and the transis-
tor turns off, cutting current flow to the light bulb. R2 should be large 
(e.g., 10 kW) so that very little current flows to ground.
FIGURE 4.52
CURRENT SOURCE
The circuit here shows how an npn transistor 
can be used to make a simple current source. 
By applying a small input voltage and current  
at the transistor’s base, a larger collector/load

rent is related to the base voltage by

EMITTER FOLLOWER
The network shown here is called an emit-
ter follower. In this circuit, the output voltage 
(tapped at the emitter) is almost a mirror image 
of the input (output “follows” input), with the 
 exception of a 0.6 V drop in the output relative 
to the input (caused by base- emitter pn junc-
tion). Also, whenever VB Ä 0.6 V (during nega-
tive swings in input), the transistor will turn 
off (the pn junction is reversed- biased). This 
effect results in clipping of the output (see 
graph). At first glance, it may appear that the 
emitter follower is useless—it has no voltage 
gain. However, if you look at the circuit more 
closely, you will see that it has a much larger 
input impedance than an output impedance, 
or more precisely, it has a much larger output 
current (IE) relative to an input current (IB). 
In other words, the emitter follower has cur-
rent gain, a feature that is just as important in 
applications as voltage gain. This means that 
this circuit requires less power from the sig-
nal source (applied to Vin) to drive a load than 
would otherwise be  required if the load were 
to be powered  directly by the source. By 
manipulating the transistor gain equation and 
using Ohm’s law, the input resistance and out-
put resistance are:

EMITTER FOLLOWER

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    439
EMITTER- FOLLOWER (COMMON- COLLECTOR) AMPLIFIER
The circuit shown here is called a common- collector amplifier, which has current gain but no voltage gain. It makes use of 
the emitter- follower arrangement but is modified to avoid clipping during negative input swings. The voltage divider 
(R1 and R2) is used to give the input signal (after passing through the capacitor) a positive dc level or operating point 
(known as the quiescent point). Both the input and output capacitors are included so that an ac input- output signal can be 
added without disturbing the dc operating point. The capacitors, as you will see, also act as filtering elements.
To design a common- collector amplifier used to 
power a 3- kW load, which has a supply voltage 
VCC = +10 V, a transistor hFE of 100, and a desired 
f3dB point of 100 Hz, you
1.  Choose a quiescent current IQ = IC. For this 
problem, pick IQ = 1 mA.
2.  Next, select VE = ½VCC to allow for the largest 
possible symmetric output swing without clip-
ping, which in this case, is 5 V. To set VE = 5 V 
and still get IQ = 1 mA, make use of RE, whose 
value you find by applying Ohm’s law:
 
5  V
1  mA

3.  Next, set the VB = VE + 0.6 V for quiescent condi-
tions (to match up VE so as to avoid clipping). 
To set the base voltage, use the voltage divider 
(R1 and R2). The ratio between R1 and R2 is 
 determined by rearranging the voltage- divider 
relation and substituting into it VB = VE + 0.6 V:

Fortunately, you can make an approximation and simply let R1 = R2. This 
approximation “forgets” the 0.6- V drop but usually isn’t too dramatic. 
The actual sizes of R2 and R1 should be such that their parallel resistance 
is less than or equal to one- tenth the dc (quiescent) input resistance at the 
base (this prevents the voltage divider’s output voltage from lowering 
under loading conditions):

Here, Rin(base),dc = hFERE, or specially, Rin(base),dc = 100(5 k) = 500 k. Using the 
approximation above, R1 and R2 are calculated to be 100 k each. (Here you 
did not have to worry about the ac coupler load; it did not influence the 
voltage divider because you assumed quiescent setup conditions; C2 acts 
as an open circuit, hence “eliminating” the presence of the load.)
4.  Next, choose the ac coupling capacitors so as to block out dc levels and other undesired frequencies. C1 forms a high- pass 
filter with Rin (see diagram). To find Rin, treat the voltage divider and Rin(base),ac as being in parallel:

Notice that Rin(base),ac is used, not Rin(base),dc. This is so because you can no longer treat the load as being absent when fluc-
tuating signals are applied to the input; the capacitor begins to pass a displacement current. This means that you must 
take RE and Rload in parallel and multiply by hFE to find Rin(base,ac):

lower, the common emitter has voltage gain. To figure

for maximum swing without clipping. Like the emitter

For example, if VCC is 10 V and IQ is 0.5 mA, RC is then 10 k. The gain of this

But what about RE? According to the circuit, there’s no emitter resistor. If you 
use the gain formula, it would appear that RE = 0 W, making the gain infinite. 
However, as mentioned earlier, bipolar transistors have a trans resistance (small 
internal resistance) in the emitter region, which is approximated by using
0.026V

Applying this formula to the example, taking IQ = 0.5 mA = IC ò IE, the RE term

Notice that the gain is negative (output is inverted). This results in the fact 
that as Vin increases, IC increases, while VC (Vout) decreases (Ohm’s law). Now, 
there is one problem with this circuit. The rtr term happens to be very unstable, 
which in effect makes the gain unstable. The instability stems from rtr depen-
dence on temperature. As the temperature rises,

COMMON- EMITTER AMPLIFIER
The circuit shown here is known as a common- 
emitter amplifier. Unlike the common- collector 
amplifier, the common- emitter amplifier pro-
vides voltage gain. This amplifier makes use of 
the common- emitter arrangement and is modi-
fied to allow for ac coupling. To understand how 
the amplifier works, let’s go through the follow-
ing example.
To design a common- emitter amplifier with a 
voltage gain of -100, an f3dB point of 100 Hz, and 
a quiescent current IQ = 1 mA, where hFE = 100 and 
VCC = 20 V:
1.  Choose RC to center Vout (or VC) to 
1⁄2VCC to al-
low for maximum symmetrical swings in the 
output. In this example, this means VC should 
be set to 10 V. Using Ohm’s law, you find RC:

2.  Next we select RE to set VE = 1 V for tempera-
ture stability. Using Ohm’s law, and taking IQ = 
IE = 1 mA, we get RE = VE/IE = 1 V/1 mA = 1 kW.
3.  Now, choose R1 and R2 to set the voltage 
 divider to establish the quiescent base volt-
age of VB = VE + 0.6 V, or 1.6 V. To find the 
proper ratio between R1 and R2, use the volt-
age  divider  (rearranged a bit):

This means R1 = 11.5R2. The size of these resis-
tors is found using the similar procedure you 
used for the common- collector amplifier; their 
parallel resistance should be less than or equal 
to 
1⁄10Rin(base),dc.

After plugging R1 = 11.5R2 into this expression and using Rin(base),dc = hFERE, you find that R2 = 10 kW, which in turn means  
R1 = 115 kW (let’s say, 110 kW is close enough for R1).
VE and IC increase, VBE decreases, but VB remains fixed. This means that the biasing- voltage range narrows, which in effect 
turns the transistor’s “valve” off. To eliminate this pinch, an emitter resistor is placed from emitter to ground (see second 
circuit). Treating RE and rtr as series resistors, the gain becomes

By adding RE, variations in the denominator are reduced, and therefore, the variations in gain are reduced as well. In prac-
tice, RE should be chosen to place VE around 1 V (for temperature stability and maximum swing in output). Using Ohm’s 
law (and applying it to the example), choose RE = VE/IE = VE/IQ = 1 V/1 mA = 1 k. One drawback that arises when RE is added 
to the circuit is a reduction in gain. However, there is a trick you can use to eliminate this reduction in voltage gain and 
at the same time maintain the temperature stability. If you bypass RE with a capacitor (see third circuit), you can make RE 
“disappear” when high- frequency input signals are applied. (Recall that a capacitor behaves like an infinitely large resis-
tor to dc signals but becomes less “resistive,” or reactive to ac signals.) In terms of the gain equation, the RE term goes to 
zero because the capacitor diverts current away from it toward ground. The only resistance left in the gain equation is rtr.

VOLTAGE REGULATOR
The zener diode circuit here can be used to make a simple voltage regula-
tor. However, in many applications, the simple regulator has problems; 
Vout isn’t adjustable to a precise value, and the zener diode  provides only 
moderate protection against ripple voltages. Also, the simple zener 
diode regulator does not work particularly well when the load imped-
ance varies. Accommodating large load variations requires a zener diode 
with a large power rating—which can be costly.
 The second circuit in the figure, unlike the first circuit, does a better 
job of regulating; it provides regulation with load variations and pro-
vides high- current output and somewhat better stability. This circuit 
closely resembles the preceding circuit, except that the zener diode is 
connected to the base of an npn transistor and is used to regulate the 
collect- to- emitter current. The transistor is configured in the emitter- 
follower configuration. This means that the emitter will follow the base 
(except there is the 0.6- V drop). Using a zener diode to regulate the base 
voltage results in a regulated emitter voltage. According to the transistor 
rules, the current required by the base is only 1/hFE times the emitter- to- 
collector current. Therefore, a low- power zener diode can regulate the 
base voltage of of a transistor that can pass a considerable amount of 
current. The capacitor is added to reduce the noise from the 
zener diode and also forms an RC filter with the resistor that 
is used to reduce ripple voltages.
In some instances, the preceding zener diode circuit may 
not be able to supply enough base current. One way to fix 
this problem is to add a second transistor, as shown in the 
third circuit. The extra transistor (the one whose base is con-
nected to the zener diode) acts to amplify current sent to the 
base of the upper transistor.

(The double line means to take RE and R3 in parallel.) To find rtr, use rtr = 0.026 V/IE = 0.026 V/IC = 0.026 V/1 mA =

the gain can be simplified to

DARLINGTON PAIR
By attaching two transistors together as shown 
here, a larger current- handling, larger hFE 
equivalent transistor circuit is formed. The 
combination is referred to as a Darlington pair. 
The equivalent hFE for the pair is equal to the 
product of the individual transistor’s hFE val-
ues (hFE = hFE1hFE2). Darlington pairs are used for 
large current applications and as input stages 
for amplifiers, where big input impedances are 
required. Unlike single transistors, however, 
Darlington pairs have slower response times 
(it takes longer for the top transistor to turn 
the lower transistor on and off) and have twice 
the base- to- emitter voltage drop (1.2 V instead 
of 0.6 V) as compared with single transistors. 
Darlington pairs can be purchased in single 
packages.

Types of Bipolar Transistors
SMALL SIGNAL
This type of transistor is used to amplify 
low- level signals but also can be used as a 
switch. Typical hFE values range from 10 to 
500, with maximum IC ratings from about 80 to 
600 mA. They come in both npn and pnp forms. 
Maximum operating frequencies range from 
about 1 to 300 MHz.
SMALL SWITCHING
These transistors are used primarily as  switches 
but also can be used as amplifiers. Typical hFE 
values range from around 10 to 200, with maxi-
mum IC ratings from around 10 to 1000  mA. 
They come in both npn and pnp forms. 
 Maximum switching rates range between 
10 and 2000 MHz.
HIGH FREQUENCY (RF)
These transistors are used for small signals 
that run at high frequencies for high- speed 
switching applications. The base region is very 
thin, and the actual chip is very small. They 
are used in HF, VHF, UHF, CATV, and MATV 
 amplifier and oscillator applications. They 
have a maximum frequency rating of around 
2000 MHz and maximum IC currents from 10 to 
600 mA. They come in both npn and pnp forms. 
POWER
These transistors are used in high- power 
 amplifiers and power supplies. The collector 
is connected to a metal base that acts as a heat 
sink. Typical power ratings range from around 
10 to 300 W, with frequency ratings from 
about 1 to 100 MHz. Maximum IC values range 
 between 1 to 100 A. They come in npn, pnp, and 
Darlington (npn or pnp) forms.

Important Things to Know about Bipolar Transistors
The current gain of a transistor (hFE) is not a very good parameter to go by. It can vary 
from, say, 50 to 500 within same transistor group family and varies with changes in 
collector current, collector- to- emitter voltage, and temperature. Because hFE is some-
what unpredictable, one should avoid building circuits that depend specifically on 
hFE values.
All transistors have maximum collector- current ratings (IC,max), maximum collector- 
to- base (BVCBO), collector- to- emitter (BVCEO), and emitter- to- base (VEBO) breakdown 
voltages, and maximum collector power dissipation (PD) ratings. If these ratings are 
exceeded, the transistor may get zapped. One method to safeguard against BVEB is 
to place a diode from the emitter to the base, as shown in Fig. 4.62a. The diode pre-
vents emitter- to- base conduction whenever the emitter becomes more positive than 
the base (e.g., input at base swings negative while emitter is grounded). To avoid 
exceeding BVCBO, a diode placed in series with the collector (Fig. 4.62b) can be used 
to prevent collector- base conduction from occurring when the base voltage becomes 
excessively larger than the collector voltage. To prevent exceeding BVCEO, which may 
be an issue if the collector holds an inductive load, a diode placed in parallel with the 
DARLINGTON PAIR
These are two transistors in one. They  provide 
more stability at high current levels. The 
 effective hFE for the device is much larger than 
that of a single transistor, hence allowing for a 
larger current gain. They come in npn (D- npn) 
and pnp (D- pnp) Darlington packages.
PHOTOTRANSISTOR
This transistor acts as a light- sensitive bipo-
lar transistor (base is exposed to light). When 
light comes in contact with the base region, a 
base current results. Depending on the type of 
phototransistor, the light may act exclusively 
as a biasing agent (two- lead phototransistor) or 
may simply alter an already present base cur-
rent (three- lead phototransistor). See Chap. 5 
for more details.
TRANSISTOR ARRAY
This consists of a number of transis-
tors combined into a single integrated 
package. For example, the transistor 
array shown here is made of three npn 
transistors and two pnp transistors.

load (see Fig. 4.62c) will go into conduction before a collector- voltage spike, created 
by the inductive load, reaches the breakdown voltage.
FIGURE 4.62
Pinouts for Bipolar Transistors
Bipolar transistors come in a variety of different package types. Some transistors come 
with plastic housings; others come with metal can- like housings. When attempting 
to isolate the leads that correspond to the base, emitter, and collector terminals, first 
check to see if the package that housed the transistor has a pinout diagram. If no pin-
out diagram is provided, a good cross- reference catalog (e.g., NTE Cross- Reference 
Catalog for Semiconductors) can be used. However, as is often the case, simple switch-
ing transistors that come in bulk cannot be “looked up”—they may not have a label. 
Also, these bulk suppliers often will throw together a bunch of transistors that all 
look alike but may have entirely different pinout designations and may include both 
pnp and npn polarities. If you anticipate using transistors often, it may be in your best 
interest to purchase a digital multimeter that comes with a transistor tester. These 
multimeters are relatively inexpensive and are easy to use. Such a meter comes with 
a number of breadboard- like slots. To test a transistor, the pins of the transistor are 
placed into the slots. By simply pressing a button, the multimeter then tests the tran-
sistor and displays whether the device is an npn or pnp transistor, provides you with 
the pinout designations (e.g., “ebc,” “cbe,” etc.), and will give you the transistor’s hFE.
Here, an npn transistor is used to control a 
 relay. When the transistor’s base receives a 
control voltage/current, the transistor will 
turn on, allowing current to flow through 
the  relay coil and causing the relay to switch 
states. The  diode is used to eliminate voltage 
spikes  created by the relay’s coil. The relay 
must be chosen  according to the proper voltage 
 rating, etc.

DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER
The differential amplifier shown here is a device that com-
pares two separate input signals, takes the difference between 
them, and then amplifies this difference. To understand how 
the circuit works, treat both transistors as identical, and then 
notice that both transistors are set in the common- emitter con-
figuration. Now, if you apply identical input signals to both 
V1 and V2, identical currents flow through each transistor. This 
means that (by using VC = VCC - ICRC) both transistors’ collec-
tor voltages are the same. Since the output terminals are sim-
ply the left and right transistors’ collector voltages, the output 
voltage (potential difference) is zero. Now, assume the signals 
applied to the inputs are different, say V1 is larger than V2. 
In this case, the current flow through the left transistor will 
be larger than the current flow through the right transistor. 
This means that the left transistor’s VC will decrease relative 
to the right transistor’s VC. Because the transistors are set in 
the common- emitter configuration, the effect is amplified. The 
 relationship between the input and output voltages is given by

Rearranging this expression, you find that the gain is equal 
to RC/rtr.
Understanding what resistor values to choose can be 
 explained by examining the circuit shown here. First, choose 
RC to center VC to 
1⁄2VCC, or 5 V, to maximize the dynamic range. 
At the same time, you must choose a quiescent current (when 
no signals are applied), say, IQ = IC = 50 lA. By Ohm’s law RC = 
(10V - 5V)/50 lA = 100 kW. RE is chosen to set the transistor’s 
emitters as close to 0 V as possible. RE is found by adding both 
the right and left branch’s 50 lA and taking the sum to be the 
current flow through it, which is 100 lA. Now, apply Ohm’s 
law: RE = 0 V - 10 V/100 lA = 100 kW. Next, find the transresis-
tance: rtr ò 0.026 V/IE = 0.026 V/50 lA = 520 W. The gain then is 
equal to 100 kW/520 W = 192.
In terms of applications, differential amplifiers can be used 
to extract a signal that has become weak and which has picked 
up considerable noise during transmission through a cable 
(differential amplifier is placed at the receiving end). Unlike 
a filter circuit, which can only extract a signal from noise if 
the noise frequency and signal frequency are different, a dif-
ferential amplifier does not require this condition. The only 
requirement is that the noise be common in both wires.
When dealing with differential amplifiers, the term 
common- mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is frequently used to 
describe the quality of the amplifier. A good differential am-
plifier has a high CMRR (theoretically infinite). CMRR is the 
ratio of the voltage that must be applied at the two inputs in 
parallel (V1 and V2) to the difference voltage (V1 - V2) for the 
output to have the same magnitude.

COMPLEMENTARY- SYMMETRY AMPLIFIER
FIGURE 4.65
Recall that an npn emitter follower acts to clip the output during negative swings in the input (the transistor turns off when 
VB Ä VE + 0.6 V). Likewise, a pnp follower will clip the output during positive input swings. But now, if you combine an 
npn and pnp transistor, as shown in the circuit shown here, you get what is called a push- pull follower, or complementary- 
symmetry amplifier, an amplifier that provides current gain and that is capable of conducting during both positive and 
negative input swings. For Vin = 0 V, both transistors are biased to cutoff (IB = 0). For Vin > 0 V, the upper transistor conducts 
and behaves like an emitter follower, while the lower transistor is cut off. For Vin < 0 V the lower transistor conducts, while 
the upper transistor is cut off. In addition to being useful as a dc amplifier, this circuit also conserves power because the 
operating point for both transistors is near IC = 0. However, at IC = 0, the characteristics of hFE and rtr are not very constant, so 
the circuit is not very linear for small signals or for near- zero crossing points of large signals (crossover distortion occurs).
CURRENT MIRROR
Here, two matched pnp transistors can be used to 
make what is called a current mirror. In this cir-
cuit, the load current is a “mirror image” of the 
control current that is sunk out of the leftmost 
transistor’s collector. Since the same amount of 
biasing current leaves both transistors’ bases,  
it follows that both transistors’ collector- to- 
emitter currents should be the same. The  control 
current can be set by, say, a resistor connected 
from the collector to a lower potential.  Current 
mirrors can be made with npn transistors, too. 
However, you must flip this circuit upside 
down, replace the pnp transistors with npn 
transistors, reverse current directions, and 
swap the supply voltage with ground.
FIGURE 4.66
MULTIPLE CURRENT SOURCES
The circuit here is an expanded version of the 
previous circuit, which is used to supply a  
“mirror image” of control current to a number 
of different loads. (Again, you can design such 
a circuit with npn transistor, too, taking into 
consideration what was mentioned in the last 
example.) Note the addition of an extra transis-
tor in the control side of the circuit. This tran-
sistor is included to help prevent one transistor 
that saturates (e.g., its load is removed) from 
stealing current from the common base line 
and hence reducing the other output currents.

MULTIVIBRATORS (FLIP- FLOPS)
FIGURE 4.68
A. A bistable multivibrator is a circuit that is designed to 
remain in either of two states indefinitely until a control 
signal is applied that causes it to change states. After the 
circuit switches states, another signal is required to switch 
it back to its previous state. To understand how this 
circuit works, initially assume that V1 = 0V. This means 
that the transistor Q2 has no base current and hence no 
collector current. Therefore, current that flows through 
R4 and R3 flows into the base of transistor Q1, driving it 
into saturation. In the saturation state, V1 = 0, as assumed 
initially. Now, because the circuit is symmetric, you can 
say it is equally stable with V2 = 0 and Q1 saturated. The 
bistable multivibrator can be made to switch from one 
state to another by simply grounding either V1 or V2 as 
needed. This is accomplished with switch S1. Bistable 
multivibrators can be used as memory devices or as 
frequency dividers, since alternate pulses restore the 
circuit to its initial state.
B. A monostable multivibrator is a circuit that is stable 
in only one state, in this case Vout = 0V. It can be thrown 
into its unstable state (Vout = VCC) by applying an external 
trigger signal, but it will automatically return to its stable 
state after a duration set by the RTCT network. Here when 
a negative trigger pulse is applied at the input, the fast 
decaying edge of the pulse will pass through capacitor C1 
to the base of Q1 via blocking diode D1 turning Q1 ON. 
The collector of Q1 which was previously at VCC quickly 
drops to below zero voltage, effectively giving CT a reverse 
charge of −0.6V across its plates. Transistor Q2 now has a 
minus base voltage at its base, holding the transistor fully 
OFF. This represents the circuit’s unstable state (VOUT = VCC). 
CT begins to discharge this −0.6V through RT, attempting to 
charge up to VCC. This negative voltage at Q2’s base begins 
to decrease gradually at a rate set by the time constant of 
RTCT. As Q2’s base voltage increases up to VCC, it begins to 
conduct, causing Q1 to turn off again. The system returns 
to its original stable state.
C. An asatable multivibrator is a circuit that is not stable 
in either of two possible output states and it acts like an 
oscillator. It also requires no external trigger pulse, but 
uses positive feedback network and a RC timer network to 
create built-in triggering that switches the output between 
VCC and 0V. The result is a square wave frequency generator. 
In the circuit to the left, Q1 and Q2 are switching transistors 
connected in cross-coupled feedback network, along with 
two time-delay capacitors. The transistors are biased for 
linear operation and are operated as common emitter 
amplifiers with 100% positive feedback. When Q1 is OFF, its 
collector voltage rises toward VCC, while Q2 if ON. As this 
occurs, plate A of capacitor C1 rises towards VCC. Capacitor 
C1’s other plate B, which is connected to the base of Q2 is 
at 0.6V since Q2 is in conducting state, thus the voltage 
across C1 is 6.0 – 0.6V = 5.4V. (It’s high value of charge). The 
instant Q1 switches ON, plate A of C1 falls to 0.6V, causing 
an equal and instantaneous fall in voltage on plate B of C1. 
C1 is pulled down to -5.4 (reverse charge) and this negative

voltage turns transistor Q2 hard OFF (one unstable state). C1 now begins to charge in the opposite 
direction via R3 toward the +6V supply rail, and Q2’s base voltage increases toward VCC with a time 
constant C1 R3. However, when Q2’s base voltage reaches 0.6V, Q2 turns fully ON, starting the whole 
process over again, but now with C2 taking the base of Q1 to −5.4V while charging up via resistor R2 
and entering the second unstable state. This process repeats over and over again as long as the supply 
voltage is present. The amplitude of the output is approximately VCC with the time period between states 
determined by the RC network connected across the base terminals of the transistors. It’s possible to 
drive low impedance loads (or current loads) such as LEDs, speakers, etc. without affecting the operation 
of the astable multivibrator by introducing another transistor into the circuit—as shown in figure C.

at least one of the transistors is biased (turned on), a high voltage will appear at the output. In 
the AND gate circuit, both A and B must be high in order for C to go high. In other words, both 
transistors must be biased (turned on) for a high voltage to appear at the output.

4.3.3  Junction Field- Effect Transistors
Junction field- effect transistors (JFETs) are three- lead semiconductive devices that are 
used as electrically controlled switches, amplifier controls, and voltage- controlled 
resistors. Unlike bipolar transistors, JFETs are exclusively voltage- controlled—they 
do not require a biasing current. Another unique trait of a JFET is that it is normally 
on when there is no voltage difference between its gate and source leads. However, 
if a voltage difference forms between these leads, the JFET becomes more resistive 
to current flow (less current will flow through the drain- source leads). For this rea-
son, JFETs are referred to as depletion devices, unlike bipolar transistors, which are 
en-hancement devices (bipolar transistors become less resistive 
when a current/voltage is applied to their base leads).
JFETs come in either n- channel or p- channel configurations. 
With an n- channel JFET, a negative voltage applied to its gate 
(relative to its source lead) reduces current flow from its drain 
to source lead. (It operates with VD > VS.) With a p- channel JFET, 
a positive voltage applied to its gate reduces current flow from 
its source to drain lead. (It operates with VS > VD.) The symbols 
for both types of JFETs are shown at the left.

450    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
An important characteristic of a JFET that is useful in terms of applications is its 
extremely large input impedance (typically around 1010 Ω). This high input imped-
ance means that the JFET draws little or no input current (lower pA range) and there-
fore has little or no effect on external components or circuits connected to its gate—no 
current is drawn away from the control circuit, and no unwanted current enters the 
control circuit. The ability for a JFET to control current flow while maintaining an 
extremely high input impedance makes it a useful device used in the construction 
of bidirectional analog switching circuits, input stages for amplifiers, simple two- 
terminal current sources, amplifier circuits, oscillators circuits, electronic gain- control 
logic switches, audio mixing circuits, etc.
How a JFET Works
An n- channel JFET is made with an n- type silicon channel that contains two p- type 
silicon “bumps” placed on either side. The gate lead is connected to the p- type bumps, 
while the drain and source leads are connected to either end of the n- type channel 
(see Fig. 4.71).
When no voltage is applied to the gate of an n- channel JFET, current flows 
freely through the central n- channel—electrons have no problem going through an 
n- channel; there are a lot of negative charger carriers already in there just waiting to 
help out with conduction. However, if the gate is set to a negative voltage—relative 
to the source—the area in between the p- type semiconductor bumps and the center 
of the n- channel will form two reverse- biased junctions (one about the upper bump, 
another about the lower bump). This reverse- biased condition forms a depletion 
region that extends into the channel. The more negative the gate voltage, the larger 
is the depletion region, and hence the harder it is for electrons to make it through the 
channel. For a p- channel JFET, everything is reversed, meaning you replace the nega-
tive gate voltage with a positive voltage, replace the n- channel with a p- channel semi-
conductor, replace the p- type semiconductor bumps with n- type semiconductors, 
and replace negative charge carriers (electrons) with positive charge carriers (holes).

Here are water analogies for an n- channel and p- channel JFET. Pretend water flow is

Technical Stuff
The following graph describes how a typical n- channel JFET works. In particular, the 
graph describes how the drain current (ID) is influenced by the gate- to- source voltage 
(VGS) and the drain- to- source voltage (VDS). The graph for a p- channel JFET is similar 
to that of the n- channel graph, except that ID decreases with an increasing positive 
VGS. In other words, VGS is positive in voltage, and VDS is negative in voltage.
 N-CHANNEL JFET WATER ANALOGY
When no pressure exists between the gate and 
source of the n- channel water JFET, the device 
is fully on; water can flow from the drain pipe 
to the source pipe. To account for a real JFET’s 
high input impedance, the JFET water analogy 
uses a plunger mechanism attached to a mov-
ing flood gate. (The plunger prevents current 
from entering the drain source channel, while 
at the same time it allows a pressure to control 
the flood gate.) When the gate of the n- channel 
JFET is made more negative in pressure rela-
tive to the source tube, the plunger is forced to 
the left. This in turn pulls the accordion- like 
flood gate across the drain- source channel, 
thus decreasing the current flow.
The p- channel water JFET is similar to the 
 n- channel water JFET, except that all currents 
and pressures are reversed. The p- channel 
JFET is fully on until a positive pressure, rela-
tive to the source, is applied to the gate tube. 
The positive pressure forces the accordion 
across the drain- source channel, hence reduc-
ing the current flow.

452    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When the gate voltage VG is set to the same voltage as the source (VGS = VG − VS = 
0 V), maximum current flows through the JFET. Technically speaking, people call 
this current (when VGS = 0 V) the drain current for zero bias, or IDSS. IDSS is a constant 
and varies from JFET to JFET. Now notice how the ID current depends on the drain- 
source voltage (VDS = VD − VS). When VDS is small, the drain current ID varies nearly 
linearly with VDS (looking at a particular curve for fixed VGS). The region of the graph 
in which this occurs is called the ohmic region, or linear region. In this region, the JFET 
behaves like a voltage- controlled resistor.
Now notice the section of the graph were the curves flatten out. This region is 
called the active region, and here the drain current ID is strongly influenced by the 
gate- source voltage VGS but hardly at all influenced by the drain- to- source voltage 
VDS (you have to move up and down between curves to see it).
Another thing to note is the value of VGS that causes the JFET to turn off (point 
where practically no current flows through device). The particular VGS voltage that 
causes the JFET to turn off is called the cutoff voltage (sometimes called the pinch- off 
voltage VP), and it is expressed as VGS,off.
Moving on with the graph analysis, you can see that when VDS increases, there 
is a point where ID skyrockets. At this point, the JFET loses its ability to resist cur-
rent because too much voltage is applied across its drain- source terminals. In JFET 
lingo, this effect is referred to as drain- source breakdown, and the breakdown voltage 
is expressed as BVDS.
For a typical JFET, IDSS values range from about 1 mA to 1 A, VGS,off values range 
from around −0.5 to −10 V for an n- channel JFET (or from +0.5 to +10 V for a p- channel 
JFET), and BVDS values range from about 6 to 50 V.
Like bipolar transistors, JFETs have internal resistance within their channels 
that varies with drain current and temperature. The reciprocal of this resistance is 
referred to as the transconductance gm. A typical JFET transconductance is around a few 
thousand Ω−1, where Ω−1 = 1/Ω or 
Ω
. 
Another one of the JFET’s built- in parameters is its on resistance, or RDS,on. This 
resistance represents the internal resistance of a JFET when in its fully conducting 
state (when VGS = 0). The RDS,on of a JFET is provided in the specification tables and 
typically ranges from 10 to 1000 Ω.

Unfortunately, there is one equation and two unknowns. This means that you have 
to come up with another equation. Here’s how you get the other equation. First, you 
can assume the gate voltage is 0 V because it’s grounded. This means that
VGS = VG - VS = 0 V - VS = -VS
From this, you can come up with another equation for the drain current by

The two circuits here demonstrate how a JFET acts like a voltage- controlled light dimmer. In the n- channel circuit, a more 
negative gate voltage causes a larger drain- to- source resistance, hence causing the light bulb to receive less current. In the 
p- channel circuit, a more positive gate voltage causes a greater source- to- drain resistance.

BASIC CURRENT SOURCE AND BASIC AMPLIFIER
FIGURE 4.78  A simple current source can be constructed by shorting the source and gate termi-
nals together (this is referred to as self- biasing), as shown in the left- most circuit. This means that 
VGS = VG - VS = 0 V, which means the drain current is simply equal to IDDS. One obvious drawback 
of this circuit is that the IDDS for a particular JFET is unpredictable (each JFET has its own unique 
IDDS that is acquired during manufacturing). Also, this source is not adjustable. However, if you 
place a resistor between the source and ground, as shown in the right- most circuit, you can make 
the current source adjustable. By increasing RS, you can decrease ID, and vice versa (see Problem 2).  
Besides being adjustable, this circuit’s ID current will not vary as much as the left circuit for 
changes in VDS. Though these simple JFET current sources are simple to construct, they are not as 
stable as a good bipolar or op amp current source.
FIGURE 4.79  The JFET circuit here is called a source follower, which is analogous to the bipolar 
emitter follower; it provides current gain but not voltage gain. The amplitude of the output signal 
is found by applying Ohm’s law: VS = RSID, where ID = gmVGS = gm(VG − VS). Using these equations, 
you get

Since VS = Vout and VG = Vin, the gain is simply RSgm/(1 + RSgm). The output impedance, as you saw 
in Problem 2, is 1/gm. Unlike the emitter follower, the source follower has an extremely larger 
input impedance and therefore draws practically no input current. However, at the same time, 
the JFET’s transconductance happens to be smaller than that of a bipolar transistor, meaning the 
output will be more attenuated. This makes sense if you treat the 1/gm term as being a small inter-
nal resistance within the drain- source channel (see rightmost circuit). Also, as the drain current 
changes due to an applied waveform, gm and therefore the output impedance will vary, resulting 
in output distortion. Another problem with this follower circuit is that VGS is a poorly controlled 
parameter (a result of manufacturing), which gives it an unpredictable dc offset.

are zero, making the upper transistor a follower with zero dc offset. Also, since the lower JFET responds directly to the 
upper JFET, any temperature variations will be compensated. When R1 and R2 are set equal, Vout = Vin. The resistors help 
give the circuit better ID linearity, allow you to set the drain current to some value other than IDSS, and help to improve the 
linearity. In terms of applications, JFET followers are often used as input stages to amplifiers, test instruments, or other 
equipment that is connected to sources with high source impedance.
IMPROVED SOURCE FOLLOWER
The source follower circuit from the pre-
ceding example had poor linearity and an 
unpredictable dc offset. However, you can 
eliminate these problems by using one of the 
two  arrangements shown here. In the far- left 
circuit, you replace the source resistor with 
a bipolar current source. The bipolar source 
acts to fix VGS to a constant value, which in 
turn eliminates the nonlinearities. To set the 
dc offset, you adjust R1. (R2 acts like RS in the 
preceding circuit; it sets the gain.) The near- 
left circuit uses a JFET current source instead 
of a bipolar source. Unlike the bipolar circuit, 
this circuit requires no adjusting and has bet-
ter temperature stability. The two JFETs used 
here are matched (matched JFETs can be found 
in pairs, assembled together within a single 
package). The lower transistor sinks as much 
current as needed to make VGS = 0 (shorted 
gate). This means that both JFETs’ VGS values

As with bipolar amplifiers, the resistors are used to set the gate voltages and set the quiescent currents, while the capaci-
tors act as ac couplers/high- pass filters. Notice, however, that both JFET amplifiers only require one self- biasing resistor. 
JFET AMPLIFIERS
Recall the emitter- follower and common- 
emitter bipolar transistor amplifiers from the 
last chapter. These two amplifiers have JFET 
counterparts, namely, the source- follower and 
the common- source amplifier shown here. 
(The source- follower amplifier provides cur-
rent gain; the common- source amplifier pro-
vides voltage gain.) If you were to set up the

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    457
Now, an important question to ask at this point 
is, Why would you choose a JFET amplifier 
over a bipolar amplifier? The answer is that a 
JFET provides increased input impedance and 
low input current. However, if extremely high 
input impedances are not required, it is better 
to use a simple bipolar amplifier or op amp. 
In fact, bipolar amplifiers have fewer nonlin-
earity problems, and they tend to have higher 
gains when compared with JFET amplifiers. 
This stems from the fact that a JFET has a low-
er transconductance than a bipolar transistor 
for the same current. The difference between 
a bipolar’s transconductance and JFET’s trans-
conductance may be as large as a factor of 100. 
In turn, this means that a JFET amplifier will 
have a significantly smaller gain.
FIGURE 4.81  (Continued)
VOLTAGE- CONTROLLED RESISTOR
According to the graphs you saw earlier, if VDS drops low enough, the 
JFET will operate within the linear (ohmic) region. In this region, the ID 
versus VDS curves follow approximate straight lines for VDS smaller than 
VGS - VGS,off. This means that the JFET behaves like a voltage- controlled 
resistor for small signals of either polarity. For example, if you take a 
voltage- divider network and replace one of the resistors with a JFET, 
you get a voltage- controlled voltage divider (see upper left- hand  figure). 
The range over which a JFET behaves like a traditional resistor depends 
on the particular JFET and is roughly proportional to the amount by 
which the gate voltage exceeds VGS,off. For a JFET to be  effective as a 
linearly responding resistor, it is important to limit VDS to a value 
that is small compared with VGS,off, and it is important to keep |VGS|  
below |VGS,off|. JFETs that are used in this manner are frequently used 
in electronic gain- control circuits, electronic attenuators, electronically 
variable filters, and oscillator amplitude- control circuits. A simple elec-
tronic gain- control circuit is shown here. The voltage gain for this circuit 
is given by gain = 1 + RF/RDS(on), where RDS is the drain- source channel 
resistance. If RF = 29 kW and RDS(on) = 1 kW, the maximum gain will be 30. 
As VGS approaches VGS,off, RDS will increase and become very large such 
that RDS >> RF, causing the gain to decrease to a minimum value close to 
unity. As you can see, the gain for this circuit can be varied over a 30:1 
ratio margin.

Practical Considerations
JFETs typically are grouped into the following categories: small- signal and switching 
JFETs, high- frequency JFETs, and dual JFETs. Small- signal and switching JFETs are 
frequently used to couple a high- impedance source with an amplifier or other device 
such as an oscilloscope. These devices are also used as voltage- controlled switches. 
High- frequency JFETs are used primarily to amplify high- frequency signals (with the 
RF range) or are used as high- frequency switches. Dual JFETs contain two matched 
JFETs in one package. As you saw earlier, dual JFETs can be used to improve source- 
follower circuit performance.

RELAY DRIVER
Here, an n- channel JFET is used to switch a 
relay. When the switch is set to position A, 
the JFET is on (gate isn’t properly biased for a 
depletion effect to occur). Current then passes 
through the JFET’s drain- source region and 
through the relay’s coil, causing the relay to 
switch states. When the switch is thrown to 
position B, a negative voltage—relative to the 
source—is set at the gate. This in turn causes 
the JFET to block current flow from reaching 
the relay’s coil, thus forcing the relay to switch 
states.

AUDIO MIXER/AMPLIFIER
This circuit uses a JFET—set in the common- 
source arrangement—to combine (mix) signals 
from a number of different sources, such as 
microphones, preamplifiers, etc. All inputs 
are applied through ac coupling capacitors/
filters. The source and drain resistors are used 
to set the overall amplification, while the 1- MW 
 potentiometers are used to control the individual 
gains of the input signals.
ELECTRICAL FIELD METER
Here, a JFET is used to construct a simple static 
electricity detector. When the antenna (simple 
wire) is placed near a charged object, the elec-
trons in the antenna will be drawn toward 
or away from the JFET’s gate, depending on 
whether the object is positively or negatively 
charged. The repositioning of the electrons 
sets up a gate voltage that is proportional to 
the charge placed on the object. In turn, the 
JFET will either begin to resist or allow cur-
rent to flow through its drain- source channel, 
hence resulting in ammeter needle deflection. 
R1 is used to protect the ammeter, and R2 is 
used to calibrate it.

4.3.4  Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field- Effect Transistors
Metal oxide semiconductor field- effect transistors (MOSFETs) are incredibly popular 
transistors that in some ways resemble JFETs. For instance, when a small voltage is 
applied at its gate lead, the current flow through its drain- source channel is altered. 
However, unlike JFETS, MOSFETs have larger gate lead input impedances (≥1014 Ω, 
as compared with ∼109 Ω for JFETs), which means that they draw almost no gate 
current whatsoever. This increased input impedance is made possible by placing a 
metal oxide insulator between the gate and the drain-source channel. There is a price 
to pay for this increased amount of input impedance, which amounts to a very low 
gate- to- channel capacitance (a few pF). If too much static electricity builds up on

Enhancement MOSFETs
Depletion MOSFETs

460    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
the gate of certain types of MOSFETs during handling, the accumulated charge may 
break through the gate and destroy the MOSFET. (Some MOSFETs are designed with 
safeguards against this breakdown—but not all.)
The two major kinds of MOSFETs are enhancement- type MOSFETs and depletion- 
type MOSFETs (see Fig. 4.88). A depletion- type MOSFET is normally on (maximum 
current flows from drain to source) when no difference in voltage exists between the 
gate and source terminals (VGS = VG − VS = 0 V). However, if a voltage is applied to its 
gate lead, the drain- source channel becomes more resistive—a behavior similar to a 
JFET. An enhancement- type MOSFET is normally off (minimum current flows from 
drain to source) when VGS = 0 V. However, if a voltage is applied to its gate lead, the 
drain- source channel becomes less resistive.
Both enhancement- type and depletion- type MOSFETs come in either n- channel or  
p- channel forms. For an n- channel depletion- type MOSFET, a negative gate- source 
voltage (VG < VS) increases the drain- source channel resistance, whereas for a p- channel 
depletion- type MOSFET, a positive gate- source voltage (VG > VS) increases the channel 
resistance. For an n- channel enhancement- type MOSFET, a positive gate- source volt-
age (VG > VS) decreases the drain- source channel resistance, whereas for a p- channel 
enhancement- type MOSFET, a negative gate- source voltage (VG < VS) decreases the 
channel resistance.
MOSFETs are perhaps the most popular transistors used today; they draw very 
little input current, are easy to make (require few ingredients), can be made extremely 
small, and consume very little power. In terms of applications, MOSFETs are used in 
ultrahigh input impedance amplifier circuits, voltage- controlled “resistor” circuits, 
switching circuits, and found with large-scale integrated digital ICs.
Like JFETs, MOSFETs have small transconductance values when compared with 
bipolar transistors. In terms of amplifier applications, this can lead to decreased gain 
values. For this reason, you will rarely see MOSFETs in simple amplifier circuits, 
unless there is a need for ultrahigh input impedance and low input current features.
How MOSFETs Work
Both depletion and enhancement MOSFETs 
use an electrical field—produced by a gate 
voltage—to alter the flow of charge carri-
ers through the semiconductive drain- source 
channel. With depletion- type MOSFETs, the 
drain- source chan nel is inherently conductive; 
charge car riers such as electrons (n- channel) or 
holes (p- channel) are already present within 
the n- type or p- type channel. If a negative 
gate- source voltage is applied to an n- channel 
depletion- type MOSFET, the resulting electri-
cal field acts to “pinch off” the flow of elec-
trons through the channel (see Fig. 4.88a). A 
p- channel depletion- type MOSFET uses a 
positive gate- source voltage to “pinch off” 
the flow of holes through its channel (see 
Fig.  4.88b). (The pinching- off effect results 
from depletion regions forming about the 
upper and lower gate contacts.) Enhancement 
MOSFETs, un like depletion MOSFETs, have 
a normally resistive channel; there are few 
charge carriers within it. If a positive gate- 
source voltage is applied to an n- channel 
enhancement- type MOSFET, electrons within

the p- type semiconductor region migrate into the channel and thereby increase the conductance of the channel (see 
Fig. 4.88c). For a p- channel enhancement MOSFET, a negative gate- source voltage draws holes into the channel to increase 
the conductivity (see Fig. 4.88d).
Theory
In terms of theory, you can treat depletion-type MOSFETs like JFETs, except you 
must give them larger input impedances. The following graphs, definitions, and 
formulas summarize the theory.

VDD = 20 V, VGS,th = 2 V, and VGS = 5 V, what should the resistance of RD be to center 
VD to 10 V? Also, what is the gain for this circuit?
First, determine the drain current:
ID = k (VGS - VGS,th)2

Applying Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, you 
can come up with the following expressions:
VDD = VDS + IDRD
VDD = VD + IDRD
where the last expression takes into account 
the grounded source terminal. (Note the 1- MW 
resistor. It is a self- biasing resistor and is used 
to compensate leakage currents and other 
 parameters that can lead to MOSFET instabil-
ity. The voltage drop across this resistor can be 
neglected because the gate leakage current is 
very small, typically in the nA or pA range.) 
Now, if you assume that there is no input volt-
age, you can say that ID = IDSS. This means that
VD = VDD - IDSSRD
= 20 V - (10 mA)(1 kW) = 10 V
To find the gain, use the following formula:

Important Things to Know about MOSFETs
MOSFETs may come with a fourth lead, called the body terminal. This terminal forms 
a diode junction with the drain- source channel. It must be held at a nonconducting 
voltage [say, to the source or to a point in a circuit that is more negative than the 
source (n- channel devices) or more positive than the source (p- channel devices)]. If 
the base is taken away from the source (for enhancement- type MOSFETs) and set 
to a different voltage than that of the source, the effect shifts the threshold voltage 
VGS,th by an amount equal to 1⁄2VBS
1/2 in the direction that tends to decrease drain cur-
rent for a given VGS. Some instances when shifting the threshold voltage becomes 
important are when leakage effects, capacitance effects, and signal polarities must 
be counterbalanced. The body terminal of a MOSFET is often used to determine 
the operating point of a MOSFET by applying an incremental ac signal to its gate.
To find the gain, first find the transconductance:
gm = 2k (VGS - VGS,th) = 2(1000 lmhos/V)(5 V - 2 V) = 6000 lmhos
Next, substitute gm into the gain expression:

Damaging a MOSFET Is Easy
MOSFETs are extremely fragile. Their delicate gate- channel oxide insulators are sub-
ject to electron bombardment from statically charged objects. For example, it is pos-
sible for you to blow a hole through one of these insulators simply by walking across 
a carpet and then touching the gate of the MOSFET. The charge you pick up during 
your walk may be large enough to set yourself at a potential of a few thousand volts. 
Although the amount of current discharged during an interaction is not incredibly 
large, it does not matter; the oxide insulator is so thin (the gate- channel capacitance 
is so small, typically a few pF) that a small current can be fatal to a MOSFET. When 
installing MOSFETs, it is essential to eliminate all static electricity from your work 
area. In Chap. 7 you’ll find guidelines for working with components subject to elec-
trostatic discharge.
Kinds of MOSFETs
Like the other transistors, MOSFETs come in either metal can- like containers or plastic 
packages. High- power MOSFETs come with metal tabs that can be fastened to heat 
sinks. High/low MOSFET driver ICs also are available. These drivers (typically DIP 
in form) come with a number of independent MOSFETs built in and operate with 
logic signals.

Things to consider when purchasing a MOSFET include breakdown voltages, 
ID,max, RDS(on),max, power dissipation, switching speed, and electrostatic discharge  
protection.

Applications
Here, an n- channel enhancement- type power 
MOSFET is used to control the current flow 
through a lamp. The voltage- divider resistor 
R2 sets the gate voltage, which in turn sets the 
drain current through the lamp.

CURRENT SOURCE
In the circuit shown here, an op amp is com-
bined with an n- channel depletion- type 
 MOSFET to make a highly reliable  current 
source (less than 1 percent error). The  MOSFET 
passes the load current, while the  inverting in-
put of the op amp samples the voltage across 
RS and then compares it with the voltage 
 applied to the noninverting input. If the drain 
current  attempts to increase or decrease, the 
op amp will respond by decreasing or increas-
ing its output, hence altering the MOSFETs 
gate  voltage in the process. This in turn con-
trols the load current. This op amp/MOSFET 
current source is more reliable than a simple 
bipolar transistor- driven source. The amount 
of leakage current is extremely small. The load 
 current for this circuit is determined by apply-
ing Ohm’s law (and applying the rules for op 
amps discussed in Chap. 8):

AMPLIFIERS
Common- source and source- follower ampli-
fiers can be constructed using both deple-
tion- and enhancement- type MOSFETs. The 
de pletion- type amplifiers are similar to the  
JFET amplifiers discussed earlier, except 
that they have higher input impedances. 
The enhancement- type MOSFET amplifiers  
essentially perform the same operations as the 
depletion- type MOSFET amplifiers, but they 
require a voltage divider (as compared with a 
single resistor) to set the quiescent gate volt-
age. Also, the output for the enhancement- type 
common- source MOSFET amplifier is  inverted. 
The role of the resistors and capacitors with-
in these circuits can be better understood by 
referring to the amplifier circuits  discussed 
 earlier.

AUDIO AMPLIFIER
In this circuit, an n- channel enhancement- type MOSFET is used to 
 amplify an audio signal generated by a high- impedance microphone 
and then uses the amplified signal to drive a speaker. C1 acts as an ac 
coupling capacitor, and the R2 voltage divider resistor acts to control the 
gain (the volume).

DIRECTION CONTROL OF A DC MOTOR
A permanent magnet DC motor rotates either clockwise or counterclockwise, 
depending on polarity of the applied voltage across its terminals. A simple 
circuit that can be used to control the on/off state of a motor as well as direc-
tion of rotation is shown to the left. This circuit is an H-bridge motor-control 
circuit built with power MOSFETS. Transistors Q1 and Q2 are Nchannel 
MOSFETs, and Q3 and Q4 are P-channel MOSFETS. To turn on the motor 
as well as control the direction of rotation, switches SW1 and SW2 are used. 
Both switches are push button switches that are of the normal open variety. 
When SW1 is pressed, the voltage on gates Q1 and Q3 goes to zero, turn-
ing off Q1 and turning on Q3. This creates a current path from Q3, through 
the motor and through Q2. This causes the motor to turn clockwise. When 
SW1 is released, the motor turns off. When SW2 is pressed, Q2 turns off and 
Q4 turns on, creating a reverse current path through Q1, the motor and Q4, 
and the motor turns counterclockwise. To provide digital control, SW1 and 
SW2 can be replaced by transistors (or similar switching devices) that can be 
turned on and off using a microcontroller.
FIGURE 4.103
RELAY DRIVER (DIGITAL- TO- ANALOG  
CONVERSION)
The circuit shown here uses an n- channel depletion- type MOSFET as an 
interface between a logic circuit and an analog circuit. In this example, 
an AND gate is used to drive a MOSFET into conduction, which in turn 
activates the relay. If inputs A and B are both high, the relay is switched 
to position 2. Any other combination (high/low, low/high, low/low) will 
put the relay into position 1. The MOSFET is a good choice to use as a 
digital-to-analog interface; its extremely high input resistance and low 
input current make it a good choice for powering high- voltage or high- 
current analog circuits without worrying about drawing current from 
the driving logic.

4.3.5 Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)
IGBTs are a hybrid of a MOSFET and a bipolar transistor. This is reflected in the 
IGBTs electronic symbol (see Fig. 4.104). This has the Gate terminal of a MOSFET and 
the Collector and Emitter terminals of a bipolar transistor. As you might have expect 
from this, the transistor is commonly used as a switch often at very high currents and 
voltages. The switch is voltage controlled like a MOSFET but has high current capa-
bilities of a bipolar transistor.
IGBTs have found a niche in very high power applications such as electric vehi-
cles, where modules are constructed from a number of IGBTs in parallel to achieve 
switching powers in the hundreds of amperes at high voltages. The very forgiving 
pulse capabilities have found application amongst hobbyists in solid-state Tesla coils.
4.3.6  Unijunction Transistors
Unijunction transistors (UJTs) are three- lead devices that act exclusively as electrically 
controlled switches (they are not used as amplifier controls). The basic operation of a UJT 
is relatively simple. When no potential difference exists between its emitter and either of 
FIGURE 4.104

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    469
How UJTs Work
A simple model of a UJT is shown in Fig. 4.105. It consists of a single bar of n- type semi-
conductor material with a p- type semiconductor “bump” in the middle. One end of the 
bar makes up the base 1 terminals, the other end the base 2 terminal, and the “bump” 
represents the emitter terminal. Below is a simple “how it works” explanation.
With no voltage applied to the emitter, only a 
relatively small number of electrons makes it 
through the n- region between base 1 and base 
2. Normally, both connectors to bases 1 and 
2 are resistive (each around a few thousand 
ohms).
When a sufficiently large voltage is applied to 
the emitter, the emitter- channel p-n junction 
is forward- biased (similar to forward-biasing 
a diode). This in turn allows a large number 
of base 1 electrons to exit through the emitter. 
Now, since conventional currents are defined to 
be flowing in the opposite direction of electron 
flow, you would say that a positive current flows 
from the emitter and combines with channel cur-
rent to produce a larger base 1 output current.
FIGURE 4.106
Technical Info
Figure 4.107 shows a typical VE versus IE graph of an UJT, as well as a UJT equivalent circuit. 
In terms of the UJT theory, if B1 is grounded, a voltage applied to the emitter will have no effect 
(does not increase conductance from one base to another) until it exceeds a critical voltage, known 
as the triggering voltage. The triggering voltage is given by the following expression:

its base leads (B1 or B2), only a very small current flows from B2 to B1. However, if a suf-
ficiently large positive trigger voltage—relative to its base leads—is applied to the emitter, 
a larger current flows from the emitter and combines with the small B2- to- B1 current, thus 
giving rise to a larger B1 output current. Unlike the other transistors covered earlier—
where the control leads (e.g., emitter, gate) provided little or no additional current—the 
UJT is just the opposite; its emitter current is the primary source of additional current.
FIGURE 4.105

470    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In this equation, RB1 and RB2 represent the inherent resistance within the region 
between each base terminal and the n- channel. When the emitter is open- circuited, 
the combined channel resistance is typically around a few thousand ohms, where RB1 
is somewhat larger than RB2. Once the trigger voltage is reached, the p-n junction is  
forward- biased (the diode in the equivalent circuit begins to conduct), and current 
then flows from the emitter into the channel. But how do we determine RB1 and RB2? 
Will the manufacturers give you these resistances? They most likely will not. Instead, 
they typically give you a parameter called the intrinsic standoff ratio η. This intrinsic 
standoff ratio is equal to the RB1/(RB1 + RB2) term in the preceding expression, pro-
vided the emitter is not conducting. The value of η is between 0 to 1, but typically it 
hangs out at a value around 0.5.
These UJTs are used in oscillatory, timing, and level- detecting circuits. 
Typical maximum ratings include 50 mA for IE, 35 to 55 V for the inter-
base voltage (VBB), and 300 to 500 mW for power dissipation.
TYPICAL APPLICATION (RELAXATION OSCILLATOR)
Most frequently, UJTs are used in oscillator 
circuits. Here, a UJT, along with some resistors 
and a capacitor, makes up a relaxation oscilla-
tor that is capable of generating three different 
output waveforms. During operation, at one 
instant in time, CE charges through RE until 
the voltage present on the emitter reaches the 
triggering voltage. Once the triggering voltage 
is exceeded, the E- to- B1 conductivity increases 
sharply, which allows current to pass from the 
capacitor- emitter region, through the emitter- 
base 1 region, and then to ground. CE suddenly 
loses its charges, and the emitter voltage sud-
denly falls below the triggering voltage. The 
cycle then repeats itself. The resulting wave-
forms generated during this process are shown 
in the figure. The frequency of oscillation is 
 determined by the RC charge- discharge period 
and is given by

PROGRAMMABLE (PUTs)
A PUT is similar to a UJT, except that RBB, IV (valley current level), 
IP (peak current level), and g (intrinsic standoff ratio) can be pro-
grammed by means of an external voltage divider. Being able to 
alter these parameters is often essential in order to eliminate cir-
cuit instability. The electronic symbol for a PUT looks radically 
different when compared with a UJT (see figure). The lead names 
are also different; there is a gate lead, a cathode lead, and an anode 
lead. PUTs are used to construct timer circuits, high- gain phase- 
control circuits, and oscillator circuits. We have included a simple 
PUT application in the applications section that follows.
FIGURE 4.110
RAMP GENERATOR WITH AMPLIFIER
FIGURE 4.112  Here, a UJT is combined with a few resistors, a bipolar transistor, and a capaci-
tor to make an oscillatory sawtooth generator that has controlled amplification (set by the bipo-
lar transistor). Like the preceding oscillators, C1 and R3 set the frequency. The bipolar transistor 
samples the voltage on the capacitor and outputs a ramp or sawtooth waveform.
Applications
TIMER/RELAY DRIVER
The circuit here causes a relay to throw its 
switch from one position to another in a repeti-
tive manner. The positive supply voltage charges 
up the capacitor. When the voltage across the 
capacitor reaches the UJT’s triggering voltage, 
the UJT goes into conduction. This causes the 
relay to throw its switch to position 2. When 
the capacitor’s charge runs out, the voltage 
falls below the triggering voltage, and the UJT 
turns off. The relay then switches to position 1. 
R1 controls the charging rate of the capacitor, 
and the size of the capacitor determines the 
amount of voltage used to trigger the UJT. C also 
determines the charge rate.

4.4  Thyristors
4.4.1  Introduction
Thyristors are two- to four- lead semiconductor devices that act exclusively as 
switches—they are not used to amplify signals, like transistors. A three- lead thyristor 
uses a small current/voltage applied to one of its leads to control a much larger cur-
rent flow through its other two leads. A two- lead thyristor, on the other hand, does 
not use a control lead but instead is designed to switch on when the voltage across its 
leads reaches a specific level, known as the breakdown voltage. Below this breakdown 
voltage, the two- lead thyristor remains off.
You may be wondering at this point, Why not simply use a transistor instead of 
a thyristor for switching applications? Well, you could—often transistors are indeed 
used as switches—but compared with thyristors, they are trickier to use because they 
require exacting control currents/voltages to operate properly. If the control cur-
rent/voltage is not exact, the transistor may lay in between on and off states. And 
according to common sense, a switch that lies in between states is not a good switch. 
Thyristors, on the other hand, are not designed to operate in between states. For these 
devices, it is all or nothing—they are either on or off.
In terms of applications, thyristors are used in speed- control circuits, power- 
switching circuits, relay- replacement circuits, low- cost timer circuits, oscillator cir-
cuits, level- detector circuits, phase- control circuits, inverter circuits, chopper circuits, 
logic circuits, light- dimming circuits, motor speed- control circuits, etc.

Here, a PUT is programmed by R1 and R2 to set 
the desired triggering voltage and anode cur-
rent. These two resistors form a voltage divider 
that sets the gate voltage VG (terminal used to 
turn PUT on or off). For the PUT to conduct, 
the anode voltage must exceed the gate volt-
age by at least 0.7 V. At a moment when the 
capacitor is discharged, the gate is reverse- 
biased, and the PUT is turned off. Over time, 
the capacitor begins charging through R4, 
and when enough charge is collected, a large 
enough voltage will be present to forward-bias 
the gate. This then turns the PUT on (i.e., if the 
anode current IA exceeds the peak current IP). 
Next, the capacitor discharges through the PUT 
and through R3. (Note: When a PUT is conduct-
ing, the voltage from the anode to the cathode 
is about 1 V.) As the capacitor reaches full dis-
charge, the anode current decreases and finally 
stops when the gate no longer has a sufficient 
voltage applied to it. After that, the charging 
 begins again, and the cycle repeats itself, over 
and over again. By tapping the circuit at the 
gate and source terminals, you can output both 
a spiked and sawtooth wave pattern.

Table 4.6 provides an overview of the major kinds of thyristors. When you see the 
phrase turns it on, this means a conductive path is made between the two conducting 
leads [e.g., anode (A) to cathode (C), MT1 to MT2]. Normally off refers to the condition 
when no voltage is applied to the gate (the gate is open- circuited). We will present a 
closer look at these thyristors in the subsections that follow.
4.4.2  Silicon- Controlled Rectifiers
SCRs are three- lead semiconductor devices that act as electrically controlled switches. 
When a specific positive trigger voltage/current is applied to the SCR’s gate lead (G), 
a conductive channel forms between the anode (A) and the cathode (C) leads. Current 
flows in only one direction through the SCR, from anode to cathode (like a diode).
TABLE 4.6  Major Kinds of Thyristors
TYPE
SYMBOL
MODE OF OPERATION
Silicon- controlled  
rectifier (SCR)
Normally off, but when a small current enters its gate (G), it turns on.
Even when the gate current is removed, the SCR remains on. To 
turn it off, the anode- to- cathode current flow must be removed, 
or the anode must be set to a more negative voltage than the 
cathode. Current flows in only one direction, from anode (A) to 
cathode (C).
Silicon- controlled 
switch (SCS)
Similar to an SCR, but it can be made to turn off by applying a 
positive voltage pulse to a four-lead, called the anode gate. This 
device also can be made to trigger on when a negative voltage 
is applied to the anode-gate lead. Current flows in one direction, 
from anode (A) to cathode (C).
Triac
 Similar to an SCR, but it can switch in both directions, meaning it 
can switch ac as well as dc currents. A triac remains on only when 
the gate is receiving current, and it turns off when the gate current is 
removed. Current flows in both directions, through MT1 and MT2.
Four- layer diode
 It has only two leads. When placed between two points in a circuit, it 
acts as a voltage- sensitive switch. As long as the voltage difference 
across its leads is below a specific breakdown voltage, it remains 
off. However, when the voltage difference exceeds the breakdown 
point, it turns on. Conducts in one direction, from anode (A) to 
cathode (C).
Diac
 Similar to the four- layer diode but can conduct in both directions. 
Designed to switch either ac or dc.
Another unique feature of an SCR, besides its current- controlled switching, has 
to do with its conduction state after the gate current is removed. After an SCR is trig-
gered into conduction, removing the gate current has no effect. That is, the SCR will 
remain on even when the gate current/voltage is removed. The only way to turn 
the device off is to remove the anode- to- cathode current or to reverse the anode and 
cathode polarities.

474    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In terms of applications, SCRs are used in switching circuits, phase- control cir-
cuits, inverting circuits, clipper circuits, and relay- control circuits, to name a few.
How SCRs Work
An SCR is essentially just an npn and a pnp bipolar transistor sandwiched together, as 
shown in Fig. 4.115. The bipolar transistor equivalent circuit works well in describing 
how the SCR works.
THE SCR IS OFF
Using the bipolar equivalent circuit, if the gate is not set to a specific positive voltage needed to turn the npn transistor on, 
the pnp transistor will not be able to “sink” current from its own base. This means that neither transistor will conduct, and 
hence current will not flow from anode to cathode.
THE SCR IS ON
If a positive voltage is applied to the gate, the npn transistor’s base is properly biased, and it turns on. Once on, the pnp 
transistor’s base can now “sink” current though the npn transistor’s collector—which is what a pnp transistor needs in 
order to turn on. Since both transistors are on, current flows freely between anode and cathode. Notice that the SCR will 
remain on even after the gate current is removed. This—according to the bipolar equivalent circuit—results from the fact 
that both transistors are in a state of conduction when the gate current is removed. Because current is already in motion 
through the pnp transistors base, there is no reason for the transistors to turn off.

Here, an SCR is used to construct a simple 
latching circuit. S1 is a momentary contact, nor-
mally open pushbutton switch, while S2 is a 
momentary contact, normally closed pushbut-
ton switch. When S1 is pushed in and released, 
a small pulse of current enters the gate of the 
SCR, thus turning it on. Current will then flow 
through the load. The load will continue to 
 receive current until the moment S2 is pushed, 
at which time the SCR turns off. The gate resistor 
acts to set the SCR’s triggering voltage/ current. 
We’ll take a closer look at the triggering speci-
fications in a second.

Kinds of SCRs
Some SCRs are designed specifically for phase- control applications, while others are 
designed for high- speed switching applications. Perhaps the most distinguishing 
feature of SCRs is the amount of current they can handle. Low- current SCRs typically 
come with maximum current/voltage ratings approximately no bigger than 1 A/ 
100 V. Medium- current SCRs, on the other hand, come with maximum current/volt-
age ratings typically no bigger than 10 A/100 V. The maximum ratings for high- 
current SCRs may be several thousand amps at several thousand volts. Low- current 
SCRs come in plastic or metal can- like packages, while medium and high- current 
SCRs come with heat sinks built in.
FIGURE 4.117  Here, an SCR is used to rectify a sinusoidal signal that is to be used to power 
a load. When a sinusoidal waveform is applied to the gate, the SCR turns on when the anode 
and gate receive the positive going portion of the waveform (provided the triggering voltage is 
exceeded). Once the SCR is on, the waveform passes through the anode and cathode, powering 
the load in the process. During the negative going portion of the waveform, the SCR acts like 
a reverse- biased diode; the SCR turns off. Increasing R1 has the effect of lowering the current/
voltage supplied to the SCR’s gate. This in turn causes a lag in anode- to- cathode conduction time. 
As a result, the fraction of the cycle over which the device conducts can be controlled (see graph), 
which means that the average power dissipated by Rload can be adjusted. The advantage of using 
an SCR over a simple series variable resistor to control current flow is that essentially no power 
is lost to resistive heating.

An SCR along with a few resistors, a capacitor, 
and a UJT can be connected together to make a 
variable- speed control circuit used to run a dc 
motor. The UJT, the capacitor, and the resistors 
make up an oscillator that supplies an ac volt-
age to the SCR’s gate. When the voltage at the 
gate exceeds the SCR’s triggering voltage, the 
SCR turns on, thus allowing current to flow 
through the motor. Changing the resistance 
of R1 changes the frequency of the oscillator 
and hence determines the number of times the 
SCR’s gate is triggered over time, which in turn 
controls the speed of the motor. (The motor 
 appears to turn continuously, even though it is 
receiving a series of on/off pulses. The number 
of on cycles averaged over time determines the 
speed of the motor.) Using such a circuit over 
a simple series variable resistor to control the 
speed of the motor wastes less energy.

4.4.3  Silicon- Controlled Switches
A silicon-controller switch (SCS) is a device similar to an SCR, but is designed for situ-
ations requiring increased control, triggering sensitivity, and firing predictability. For 
example, the typical turn-off time for an SCS is from 1 to 10 microseconds as opposed 
to 5 to 30 microseconds for an SCR. Unlike an SCR, an SCS has lower power, current 
and voltage ratings, typically with a max anode current from 100 mA to 300 mA and 
a power dissipation from 100 to 500 mW. Unlike an SCR, a SCS can also switch OFF 
when a positive voltage/input current is applied to an extra anode gate lead. The 
SCS can also be triggered into conduction when a negative voltage/output current is 
applied to that same lead. The figure below shows the schematic symbol for an SCS.
Technical Stuff
Here are some common terms used by the manufacturers to describe their SCRs:
VT 
On state- voltage. The anode- to- cathode voltage present when the SCR is on.
IGT 
Gate trigger current. The minimum gate current needed to switch the SCR on.
VGT 
Gate trigger voltage. The minimum gate voltage required to trigger the gate trigger current.
IH 
 Holding current. The minimum current through the anode- to- cathode terminal required 
to maintain the SCR’s on state.
PGM 
 Peak gate power dissipation. The maximum power that may be dissipated between the 
gate and the cathode region.
VDRM 
 Repetitive peak off- state voltage. The maximum instantaneous value of the off- state 
voltage that occurs across an SCR, including all repetitive transient voltages but exclud-
ing all nonrepetitive transient voltages.
IDRM 
 Repetitive peak off- state current. The maximum instantaneous value of the off- state 
current that results from the application of repetitive peak off- state voltage.
VRRM 
 Repetitive peak reverse voltage. The maximum instantaneous value of the reverse volt-
age that occurs across an SCR, including all repetitive transient voltages but excluding 
all non repetitive transient voltages.
IRRM 
 Repetitive peak reverse current. Maximum instantaneous value of the reverse current 
that results from the application of repetitive peak reverse voltage.

SCS are used in practically any circuit that needs a switch that turns on and off 
through two distinct control pulses. They are found in power-switching circuits, logic 
circuits, lamp drivers, voltage sensors, pulse generators, etc.
How an SCS Works
Figure 4.121a shows a basic four-layer, three-junction P-N-P-N silicon model of an 
SCS with four electrodes, namely the cathode (C), cathode gate (G1), anode gate 
(G2), and anode (A). An equivalent circuit of the SCS can be modeled by the back-
to-back bipolar transistor network shown in Fig. 4.121c. Using the two-transistor 
equivalent circuit, when a negative pulse is applied to the anode gate (G2), transis-
tor Q1 switches ON. Q1 supplies base current to transistor Q2, and both transistors 
switch ON. Likewise, a positive pulse at the cathode gate G1 can switch the device 
on. Because the SCS uses only small currents, it can be switched off by an appropriate 
polarity pulse at one of the gates. At the cathode gate, a negative pulse is required to 
switch the device off, while at the anode gate a positive pulse is needed.
FIGURE 4.121
Specifications
When buying an SCS, make sure to select a device that has the proper breakdown 
voltage, current, and power- dissipation ratings. A typical specification table will 
provide the following ratings: BVCB, BVEB, BVCE, IE, IC, IH (holding current), and PD 
(power dissipation). Here we have assumed the alternate lead name designations.
4.4.4  Triacs
Triacs are devices similar to SCRs—they act as electrically controlled switches—but 
unlike SCRs, they are designed to pass current in both directions, therefore making 
them suitable for ac applications. Triacs come with three leads, a gate lead and two 
conducting leads called MT1 and MT2. When no current/voltage is applied to the 
gate, the triac remains off. However, if a specific trigger voltage is applied to the gate, 
the device turns on. To turn the triac off, the gate current/voltage is removed.

Triacs are used in ac motor control circuits, light- dimming circuits, phase- control 
circuits, and other ac power- switching circuits. They are often used as substitutes for 
mechanical relays.
How a Triac Works
Figure 4.123 shows a simple n- type/p- type silicon model of a triac. This device 
resembles two SCRs placed in reverse parallel with each other. The equivalent circuit 
describes how the triac works.
FIGURE 4.123
Basic Applications
SIMPLE SWITCH
Here is a simple circuit showing how a triac 
acts to permit or prevent current from reaching 
a load. When the mechanical switch is open, no 
current enters the triac’s gate; the triac  remains 
off, and no current passes through the load. 
When the switch is closed, a small current slips 
through RG, triggering the triac into conduction 
(provided the gate current and voltage exceed 
the triggering requirements of the triac). The 
alternating current can now flow through the 
triac and power the load. If the switch is open 
again, the triac turns off, and current is pre-
vented from flowing through the load.
FIGURE 4.124
TRIAC IS OFF
Using the SCR equivalent circuit, when no current/voltage is applied to the gate lead, neither 
of the SCRs’ gates receives a triggering voltage; hence current cannot flow in either direction 
through MT1 and MT2.
TRIAC IS ON
When a specific positive triggering current/voltage is applied to the gate, both SCRs receive suf-
ficient voltage to trigger on. Once both SCRs are on, current can flow in either direction through 
MT1 to MT2 or from MT2 to MT1. If the gate voltage is removed, both SCRs will turn off when 
the ac waveform applied across MT1 and MT2 crosses zero volts.

FIGURE 4.125  A triac along with a variable resistor and a capacitor can be used to construct an 
 adjustable full- wave rectifier. The resistance R of the variable resistor sets the time at which the triac 
will trigger on. Increasing R causes the triac to trigger at a later time and therefore results in a larger 
amount of clipping (see graph). The size of C also determines the amount of clipping that will take 
place. (The capacitor acts to store charge until the voltage across its terminals reaches the triac’s trigger-
ing voltage. At that time, the capacitor will dump its charge.) The reason why the capacitor can intro-
duce additional clipping results from the fact that the capacitor may cause the voltage at the gate to lag 
the MT2- to- MT1 voltage (e.g., even if the gate receives sufficient triggering voltage, the MT2- to- MT1 
voltage may be crossing zero volts). Overall, more clipping results in less power supplied to the load. 
Using this circuit over a simple series variable resistor connected to a load saves power. A simple series 
variable resistor gobbles up energy. This circuit, however, supplies energy- efficient pulses of current.
AC MOTOR CONTROLLER
This circuit has the same 
basic structure as the 
light 
dimmer 
circuit, 
with the exception of the 
transient suppressor sec-
tion (R2C2). The speed of 
the motor is adjusted by 
varying R1.
This circuit is used in many household dimmer 
switches. The diac—described in the next section—
acts to ensure accurate triac triggering. (The diac 
acts as a switch that passes current when the voltage 
across its leads reaches a set breakdown value. Once 
the breakdown voltage is reached, the diac releases 
a pulse of current.) In this circuit, at one moment the 
diac is off. However, when enough current passes 
through the resistors and charges up the capacitor to 
a voltage that exceeds the diac’s triggering voltage, 
the diac suddenly passes all the capacitor’s charge 
into the triac’s gate. This in turn causes the triac to 
turn on and thus turns the lamp on. After the capaci-
tor is discharged to a voltage below the breakdown 
voltage of the diac, the diac turns off, the triac turns 
off, and the lamp turns off. Then the cycle repeats 
itself, over and over again. Now, it appears that the 
lamp is on (or dimmed to some degree) because the 
on/off cycles are occurring very quickly. The lamp’s 
brightness is controlled by R2.

Kinds of Triacs
Triacs come in low- current and medium- current forms. Low- current triacs typically 
come with maximum current/voltage ratings no bigger than 1 A/(several hundred 
volts). Medium- current triacs typically come with maximum current/voltage rating 
of up to 40 A/(few thousand volts). Triacs cannot switch as much current as high- 
current SCRs.

4.4.5  Four- Layer Diodes and Diacs
Four- layer diodes and diacs are two- lead thyristors that switch current without the 
need of a gate signal. Instead, these devices turn on when the voltage across their 
leads reaches a particular breakdown voltage (or breakover voltage). A four- layer diode 
resembles an SCR without a gate lead, and it is designed to switch only dc. A diac 
resembles a pnp transistor without a base lead, and it is designed to switch only ac.

Four- layer diodes and diacs are used most frequently to help SCRs and triacs

Fig.  4.105a, you can avoid unreliable triac triggering caused by device instability 
resulting from temperature variations, etc. When the voltage across the diac reaches 
the breakdown voltage, the diac will suddenly release a “convincing” pulse of cur-
rent into the triac’s gate.

4.5  Transient Voltage Suppressors
There are numerous devices that can be used to stomp out unwanted transients. 
Earlier on, we saw how a decoupling capacitor could absorb supply line fluctuations, 
and we also saw how diodes could clip transient spikes caused by inductive switch-
ing action. These devices work fine for such low- power applications, but there are 
times when transients get so large and energetic that a more robust device is required. 
Here we’ll take a look at various transient suppressor devices, such as TVSs, varis-
tors, multilayer varistors, Surgectors, and PolySwitches. But before we do that, here’s 
a little lecture on transients.

482    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
4.5.1  Lecture on Transients
Transients are momentary surges or spikes in voltage or current that can wreak havoc 
within circuits. The peak voltage of a transient can be as small as a few millivolts or 
as large as several thousand volts, with a duration lasting from a few nanoseconds 
to more than 100 ms, depending on their origin. In some cases, the transients are 
repetitive, recurring in a cyclic manner, as in the case of an inductive ringing transient 
caused by faulty wiring of a motor.
Transients are generated both internally within a circuit and externally—where 
they enter the circuit via power input lines, signal input/output lines, data lines, and 
other wires entering and leaving the circuit’s chassis. Internal transients, the pre-
dominant of the two, can result from inductive load switching, transistor/logic IC 
switching, arcing effect, and faulty wiring, to name a few.
In the case of inductive loads, such as motors, relay coils, solenoid coils, and 
transformers, the sudden switching off of these devices will cause the inductive 
component within the device to suddenly dump its stored energy into the supply 
line, creating a voltage spike—recall the inductor equation V = LdI/dt. In many 
cases, these induced voltages can exceed 1000 V, lasting anywhere from 50 ns to 
more than 100 ms. Any transistor or logic driver ICs as well as circuits that use the 
same supply line will suffer, either by getting zapped with the transient spike or 
suffering from erratic behavior due to propagation of the transient along the power 
line. (Power lines, or rails, are not perfect conductors and don’t have zero output 
impedance.)
Switching of TTL and CMOS circuits can also result in transient current spikes of 
a much smaller threat, yet enough to cause erratic behavior. For example, when the 
output transistors of a TTL gate switch on, a sudden surge in current is drawn from 
the supply line. This surge is often quick enough that the supply rail or PCB trace will 
dip in voltage (due to the fact that a conductor has built- in impedance). All circuits 
connected to the rail will feel this voltage dip, and the resulting consequences lead to 
oscillation or some sort of instability that can cause distortion or garble digital logic 
levels.
Arcing is another transient generator that comes from a number of sources, such 
as faulty contacts in breakers, switches, and connectors, where arcs jump between 
the gaps. When electrons jump the gap, the voltage suddenly rises, usually resulting 
in an oscillatory ringing transient. Faulty connections and poor grounding can also 
result in transients. For example, motors with faulty windings or insulation can gen-
erate a continuous stream of transients exceeding a few hundred volts. Poor electrical 
wiring practices can also aggravate load- switching transients.
Transients can also attack circuits from external sources through power input 
lines, signal input and output lines, data lines, and any other wire coming into or 
going out of a chassis containing the electronics. One cause of external transients 
is a result of induced voltages onto lines (power, telephone, distributed computer 
systems, etc.) due to lightning strikes near the lines or the switching of loads, capac-
itor banks, and so on, at the power utility. External transients may also enter the 
power line to a circuit due to inductive switching that occurs within a home, such 
as turning on a hair dryer, microwave, or washing machine. Usually the transient is 
consumed by other parallel loads, so the effects aren’t as pronounced. For valuable

electrical equipment, such as computers, monitors, printers, fax machines, phones, 
and modems, it is a good idea to use a transient power surge/battery backup protec-
tor, with a phone line, too, which will handle the surges and dips in the power and 
signal lines.
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is another common form of external transient that 
can do damage to sensitive equipment and ICs. It usually enters a system through 
the touch of a fingertip or handheld metal tool. Static electricity that is humidity- 
dependent can generate low- current transients up to 40,000 V. Systems that are inter-
connected with long wires, such as telephones and distributed computer systems are 
efficient collectors of radiated lightning energy. Close- proximity strikes can induce 
voltages of 300 V or more on signal lines.
Transients are to be avoided; they can cause electronics to operate erratically, 
perhaps locking up or producing garbled results. They can zap sensitive integrated 
circuits, causing them to fail immediately or sometime down the road. Today’s micro-
chips are denser than older chips and a transient voltage can literally melt, weld, pit, 
and burn them, causing temporary or permanent malfunctions to occur. They might 
also be the cause for decreased efficiency—say, a motor running at higher tempera-
tures due to transients, which interrupt normal timing of the motor and result in 
microjogging. This produces motor vibration, noise, and excessive heat.
4.5.2  Devices Used to Suppress Transients
There are several devices that can be used when designing circuits to limit the harm-
ful effects of transients. Table 4.10 provides an overview of the most popular devices.

484    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Transient Voltage Suppressor Diodes (TVSs)
Transient voltage suppressor diodes (TVSs) are popular semiconductor devices used 
to instantly clamp transient voltages and currents (electrostatic discharge, inductive 
switching kickback, induced lightning surges, etc.) to safe levels before they can do 
damage to a circuit. Earlier, in the section on diodes, you saw how standard diodes 
and zener diodes could be used for transient suppression. Though standard diodes 
and zener diodes can be used for transient protection, they are actually designed for 
rectification and voltage regulation and are not as reliable or robust as TVSs.
TVSs come in both unipolar (unidirectional) and bipolar (bidirectional) types. The 
unipolar TVS breaks down in one direction (current flows in the opposite direction of 
the arrow—like a zener diode) when its specified breakdown voltage VBR is exceeded. 
The bipolar TVS, unlike the unipolar TVS, can handle transients in either direction, 
when the applied voltage across it exceeds its breakdown voltage. See Fig. 4.131.
In terms of design, the TVS should be invisible until a transient occurs. Electrical 
parameters such as breakdown voltage, standby current (leakage current), and 
capacitance should have no effect on normal circuit performance. The TVS’s VBR is 
typically 10 percent above VRWM, which approximates the circuit operating voltage to

limit standby current and to allow for variations in VBR caused by the temperature 
coefficient of the TVS. (In catalogs, they give you both—VBR/VRWM: 12.4 V/11.1 V,  
15.2 V/13.6 V, 190 V/171 V, etc.) VRWM should be equal to, or slightly greater than, the 
normal operating voltage of the protected circuit. When a transient occurs, the TVS 
clamps instantly to limit the spike voltage to a safe voltage level, while diverting cur-
rent from the protected circuit. VC should be, of course, less than the maximum volt-
age the protected circuit can handle. Note that in ac circuits, you should use the peak 
voltage (Vpeak) values, not the RMS values for selecting VRWM and VBR (Vpeak = 1.4 VRMS ≤ 
VRWM). Also, make sure to choose a TVS that can handle the maximum expected tran-
sient pulse current. Figure 4.132 shows various TVS applications.
FIGURE 4.131
IMPORTANT TVS SPECIFICATIONS
Reverse stand- off voltage (VRWM): Also called working voltage, represents the maxi-
mum rated dc operating voltage of TVS. At this point, the device will appear as 
a high impedance to the protected circuit. Discrete devices are available with 
VRWMs from 2.8 to 440 V.
Maximum breakdown voltage (VBR): The point where TVS begins to conduct and 
become a low- impedance path for a transient. Discrete devices are available 
with VBR from 5.3 to 484 V. The breakdown voltage is measured at a test current 
IT, typically 1 mA or 10 mA. VBR is about 10 percent greater than VRWM.
Maximum peak current (IPP): The maximum permissible surge current that the 
device can withstand before frying.
Leakage current (IR): The maximum leakage current measured at the working 
voltage.
Maximum clamping voltage (VC): The maximum clamping voltage during the 
specified peak impulse current IPP. Typically 35 to 40 percent higher than VBR 
(or 60 percent higher than VRWM).
Capacitance (CJ): Internal capacitance of TVS, which may become a factor in 
high- speed data circuits.

Fig. 1–3: Very high transient voltages are generated when an inductive load is disconnected, such as motors, relay coils, 
and solenoids. Here, TVSs provide protection to the driving circuitry, as well as limiting damage to relay and solenoid 
metal contacts.
Fig. 4–7: Typical power sources employing TVS for transient protection. The TVS is chosen for the breakdown voltage that 
is equal to or greater than the dc output voltage. In most applications, a fuse in the line is desirable.
Fig. 8–9: Input states are vulnerable to low- current, high- voltage static discharges or crosstalk transmitted on the signal 
wires. Usually an op amp or other IC will have an internal clamp diode, but this provides limited protection for high cur-
rents and voltage. Here, an external TVS diode is used to provide additional protection. The second circuit has a TVS on 
the output of an op amp to prevent a voltage transient due to a short circuit or an inductive load from being transmitted 
into the output stage.
Fig. 10: Transients generated on the line can vary from a few microseconds’ to several milliseconds’ duration and up to 
10,000 V. This threat has given rise to high- noise- immunity ICs. However, the input diodes to these devices, again, have 
limited internal diode protection, and IC damage is still possible, resulting in either an open circuit or slow degradation of 
the circuit’s performance with time. Here, a TVS located on the signal line can absorb this excess energy and prevent damage.

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    487
Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) and Multilayer Varistors
A metal oxide varistor (MOV) is a bidirectional semiconductor transient suppressor 
that acts like a voltage- sensitive variable resistor. Internally, it consists of a complex 
ceramic crystal structure with various multidirectional metal oxide p- n junction 
boundaries between crystal grains, all sandwiched between two electrodes. Each 
individual p- n junction is highly resistive, up until a voltage across the grain bound-
ary in excess of around 3.6 V, where it then is bias on—has a very small resistance. 
The voltage at which the MOV itself switches is dependent on the average number 
of grains between its electrode leads. During the manufacturing process, this value 
can be varied to create any desired breakdown threshold. Due to the random orienta-
tion of the boundaries within the MOV, there is no directional, so the MOV acts as a 
bipolar device—it can be used for ac or dc applications.
In terms of applications, an MOV is usually connected across the mains input 
of the equipment or the circuit it’s protecting, with a series filter inductor and/or 
fuse thrown in to protect the MOV itself. In the presence of a transient, the MOV’s 
resistance switches from high resistance (several megaohms) to very low resistance 
(a few ohms), transforming itself into a high- current shunt for the transient current. 
MOVs are made with various clamping voltages, peak current ratings, and maxi-
mum energy ratings—reflecting the fact that an MOV can absorb a very large amount 
of power for a very brief time or smaller amounts over a longer time. For example, 
an MOV rated at 60 J can absorb 60 W for 1 s, or 600 W for 0.1 s, or 6 kW for 10 ms, 
or 60 kW for 1 ms, and so on.
FIGURE 4.133
In many regards, MOVs resemble back- to- back zener diodes. However, unlike 
diodes, MOVs can handle higher- energy transients than zener diodes, since there 
is no single p- n junction, but rather numerous p- n junctions throughout its struc-
ture. The highly conductive ZnO grains act as heat sinks, ensuring a rapid and even 
distribution of thermal energy throughout the device and minimizing temperature 
rise. (Note that MOVs can dissipate only a relatively small amount of average power 
and are unsuited to applications that demand continuous power dissipation.) They 
are about as fast as zeners and clamp surge voltage to safe levels. Leakage is very 
low, which means little power is stolen from the circuit. Unlike the zener and other 

488    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
devices, the varistor fails shorted. A zener will also fail in an open- circuit condition 
that leaves equipment unprotected during a subsequent surge. This helps protect the 
circuit against subsequent surges; a shorted varistor across an ac or other line might 
fracture if the energy is high. MOVs should be fused or located where they won’t 
effect other components should this happen.
In comparison to TVS diodes, MOVs can handle more total power/energy, while 
leaving a smaller footprint. TVS diodes, however, exhibit much better clamp ratios  
(better- quality protection) and faster response times (1 to 5 ns compared to about 
5 to 200 ns for MOVs). The speed limitation of MOVs, however, is a result of para-
sitic inductance in the package and leads, and can be minimized with short lead 
design. MOVs also exhibit an inherent wear- out mechanism within their structure. 
As the device absorbs transient energy, the electrical characteristics (e.g., leakage, 
breakdown voltage) tend to drift. On the other hand, TVS diodes have no inherent 
wear- out mechanism. MOVs have an effective capacitance range from 75 pF for small 
MOVs to as high as 20,000 pF for large ones. This, combined with the lead induc-
tance, makes practical MOVs slower than TVS diodes, but still fast—in the range of 
5 to 200 ns, depending on the device. However, transients that they are designed to 
remove are usually much longer, so they are usually perfect for the job.
MOVs are found in power supplies of computers and other sensitive equipment, 
and in mains filters and stabilizers to prevent damage from mains- borne transients 
due to switching or lightning. They are used in telecommunication and data systems 
(power supply units, switching equipment, etc.), industrial equipment (control, prox-
imity switches, transformers, motors, traffic lighting), consumer electronics (televi-
sions and video sets, washing machines, etc.), and automotive products (all motor 
and electronic systems).
One variation of the MOV found in surface- mount form is the multilayer varistor, 
or MLTV. By having surface- mount contacts, lead self- inductance and series resis-
tance are minimized, allowing for much quicker response time—less than 1 ns. A 
decrease in series resistance also translates into a massive increase in peak current 
capability per component unit volume. Even though this is the case, the energy rat-
ings of MLTVs are rather conservative when compared to those of other varistors. 
One of MLTVs’ strong points is their ability to survive many thousands of strikes, at 
full rated peak current, without degradation. MLTVs have a characteristic similar to 
capacitors, having an effective dielectric constant of around 800—much lower than 
conventional capacitors. Because of this feature, MLTVs are also used in filter cir-
cuits. MLTVs come with an operating voltage from 3.5 V to around 68 V, and they are 
used extensively for transient voltage protection for ICs and transistors, as well as for 
many ESD and I/O protection schemes.
The following are specifications for MOV and MLTVs:
Maximum continuous dc voltage (VM(DC)): The maximum continuous dc voltage that 
may be applied up to the maximum operating temperature of the device. The 
rated dc operating voltage (working voltage) is also used as the reference point 
for leakage current. This voltage is always less than the breakdown voltage of the 
device.
Maximum continuous ac voltage (VM(AC)): The maximum continuous sinusoidal RMS 
voltage that may be applied at any temperature up to the maximum operating 

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    489
temperature of the device. It’s related to the previous dc rating by VM(DC) = 1.4 × 
VM(AC). This means that if a nonsinusoidal waveform is applied, the recurrent peak 
voltage should be limited to 1.4 × VM(AC).
Transient energy rating (WTM): Energy is given in joules (watt- seconds). This repre-
sents the maximum allowable energy for a single 10/1000- µs impulse current 
waveform with continuous voltage applied.
Peak current rating (IPK): The maximum current rating for a given maximum clamping 
voltage VC.
Varistor voltage (VB(DC) or VNOM): The voltage at which the device changes from the off 
state to the on state and enters its conduction mode of operation. The voltage is 
usually characterized at the 1- mA point and has a specified minimum and maxi-
mum voltage listed.
Clamping voltage (VC): The clamping voltage across an MOV at a peak current IPK.
Leakage at rated dc voltage (IL): The leakage current when the device is in nonconduct-
ing mode, when a specified voltage is applied.
Capacitance (Cp): The capacitance of the device, typically specified at a frequency of 
1 MHz at a bias of 1 Vpp. This capacitance is usually 100 pF or lower for smaller 
devices, and up to a few thousand for larger ones.
In terms of design, a varistor must operate under both a continuous operating 
(standby) mode and the predicted transient (normal) mode. Determine the necessary 
steady- state voltage rating (working voltage), and then establish the transient energy 
absorbed by the varistor. Calculate the peak transient current through the varistor 
and determine the power dissipation requirements. Select a model to provide the 
required voltage- clamping characteristics.

Surgector
There are other transient voltage suppression devices out there, such as the Surgector, 
gas discharge, and spark gap TVSs. The Surgector utilizes silicon thyristor technology 
to provide bidirectional “crowbar” clamping action for transients of either polarity. 
This is accomplished with a five- layer p- n junction structure. Surgectors remain in a 
low- leakage, reverse- bias state, presenting effectively no load to the circuit as long as 
the applied voltage is at or below its VDRM rating. A transient voltage exceeding this 
value will cause the device to avalanche (breakdown), beginning the clamping action 
across the line to which it is connected. As the leading edge of the transient voltage 
attempts to rise higher, the Surgector current will increase through the circuit’s source 
impedance until the VBO, or breakover voltage mode, is reached. Thyristor action is 
then rapidly triggered, and the Surgector switches to its “on,” or latched state. This 
very low impedance state crowbars the line with effectively the characteristics of a 
forward p- n junction, thereby short- circuiting the transient voltage.
FIGURE 4.135
PolySwitch
A PolySwitch (also known as polyfuse, multiswitch, and generically resettable fuse) 
is a special positive temperature coefficient resistor that is constructed from a con-
ductive polymer mix. It resembles a varistor and PTC thermistor in one. At normal  
temperatures, the conductive particles within the polymer form densely packed 
low- resistance chains, allowing current to flow easily. However, if the current flow 
through the PolySwitch increases to a point where its temperature rises above a criti-
cal level, the crystalline structure of the polymer suddenly changes into an expanded 
amorphous state. At this point, the device’s resistance dramatically increases, caus-
ing a sudden drop in current flow. The point at which this occurs is referred to as the 
trip current. If the voltage level is maintained after tripping, enough holding current 
will generally flow, keeping the device in a tripped state. The PolySwitch will reset 
itself only if the voltage is reduced and the device is allowed to cool, at which point 
the polymer particles rapidly return to their densely packed state, and the resistance 
drops.
PolySwitches can be used in numerous applications wherever you need a low- 
cost, self- resetting solid- state circuit breaker. They are used to limit over- current 
in speakers, power supplies, battery packs, motors, etc. For example, Fig. 4.136 

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    491
FIGURE 4.136
shows how a PolySwitch used to protect a speaker from excessive current sourced 
by an amplifier. The PolySwitch is rated with a trip current that is slightly higher 
than that rated for the power level the speaker can handle. For example, an 8-Ω, 5- W 
speaker has a maximum current rating determined by the generalized power law.
Avalanche Diodes
Avalanche diodes are designed to break down and conduct at a specified reverse- bias 
voltage. This behavior is similar to that of a zener diode, but its operation is caused 
by a different mechanism, called the avalanche effect (a reverse electric field applied 
across a p- n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, lead-
ing to a large current). However, unlike zener diodes that are rather restricted in 
maximum breakdown voltage, avalanche diodes are available with breakdown volt-
age of over 4000 V. Avalanche diodes are used in circuits to guard against damaging 
high- voltage transients. They are connected to a circuit so that they’re reverse- biased 
(the cathode is set positive with respect to the anode). In this configuration, the ava-
lanche diode is nonconducting and  doesn’t interfere with the circuit. However, if the 
voltage rises beyond a safe design limit, the diode goes into avalanche breakdown, 
eliminating the harmful voltage by shunting current to ground. Avalanche diodes 
are specified with a clamping voltage VBR and a maximum- size transient that it can 
absorb, specified either in terms of joules of energy or as I 2t. The avalanche break-
down event is not destructive, provided the diode isn’t overheated. One side effect 
that occurs in avalanche diodes is RF noise generation.
4.6  Integrated Circuits
An integrated circuit (IC) is a miniaturized circuit that contains a number of resistors, 
capacitors, diodes, and transistors stuffed together on a single chip of silicon no 
bigger than your fingernail. The number of resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transis-
tors within an IC may vary from just a few to millions.
The trick to cramming everything into such a small package is to make all the 
components out of tiny n-type and p-type silicon structures that are embedded into 
the silicon chip during the production phase. To connect the little transistors, resis-
tors, capacitors, and diodes together, aluminum plating is applied along the surface

of the chip. Figure 4.137 shows a magnified cross-sectional view of an IC showing 
how the various components are embedded and linked together.
ICs come in analog, digital, or analog/digital form:
• Analog (or linear) ICs produce, amplify, or respond to varying voltages. Some 
common analog ICs include voltage regulators, operational amplifiers, compara-
tors, timers, and oscillators.
• Digital (or logic) ICs respond to or produce signals having only high and low volt-
age states. Common digital ICs include logic gates (such as AND, OR, or NOR), 
microcontrollers, memories, binary counters, shift registers, multiplexers, encoders, 
and decoders.
• Analog/digital ICs share properties common with both analog and digital ICs. 
Analog/digital ICs may take a number of different forms. For example, the IC 
may be designed primarily as an analog timer but may contain a digital counter. 
Alternatively, the IC may be designed to read in digital information and then use 
this information to produce a linear output that can be used to drive, say, a stepper 
motor or LED display.
ICs are so pervasive that you are likely to use them in any project that you will 
undertake. You will find them used in many of the chapters that follow.
4.6.1  IC Packages
ICs come in many and various packages (see Fig. 4.138). The determining factors for 
the package type are the number of pins and the power dissipation. For example, a 
high-power voltage regulator IC may have three pins and look just like a high-power 
transistor.
However, the majority of ICs have many more pins and are arranged in a dual 
 in-line (DIL) package (see Fig. 4.138) of 8, 14, 16, 20, 24, or 40 pins. There are also sur-
face-mount versions of the DIL packages, as well as packages arranged as a square 
with pins on all sides. Some of the surface-mount packages have extremely small 
spacing between pins—sometimes as small as 0.5 mm, which is two pins every mil-
limeter and not really intended for hand soldering. 

Chapter 4: Semiconductors    493
Some of the most common packages are listed in Table 4.11.
You will often find that the same ICs are available in multiple packages, mak-
ing it possible to prototype in something easy to solder like DIL or SO, and then 
switch to a smaller package for the final product.

Optoelectronics is a branch of electronics that deals with light- emitting and light- 
detecting devices. Light- emitting devices, such as lamps and light- emitting diodes 
(LEDs), create electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) by using an electric current to 
excite electrons into higher energy levels (when an electron changes energy levels, 
a photon is emitted). Light- detecting devices such as phototransistors and photo-
resistors, on the other hand, are designed to take incoming electromagnetic energy 
and convert it into electric currents and voltages. This is usually accomplished using 
photons to liberate bound electrons within semiconductor materials. Light- emitting 
devices typically are used for illumination purposes or as indicator lights. Light- 
detecting devices are used primarily in light- sensing and communication devices, 
such as dark- activated switches and remote controls. This chapter examines the fol-
lowing optoelectronic devices: lamps, LEDs, photoresistors, photodiodes, solar cells, 
phototransistors,  photothyristors, and optoisolators.
Optoelectronics
CHAPTER 5
5.1  A Little Lecture on Photons
Photons are the elemental units of electromagnetic radiation. White light, for exam-
ple, is composed of a number of different kinds of photons; some are blue photons, 
some are red photons, etc. It is important to note that there is no such thing as a white

 photon. Instead, when the combination of the various colored photons interacts with 
our eye, our brain perceives what we call white light.
Photons are not limited to visible light alone. There are also radiofrequency pho-
tons, infrared photons, microwave photons, and other kinds of photons that our eyes 
cannot detect.
In terms of the physics, photons are very interesting creatures. They have no rest 
mass, but they do carry momentum (energy). A photon also has a distant wavelike 
character within its electromagnetic bundle. The wavelength of a photon (horizon-
tal distance between consecutive electrical or magnetic field peaks) depends on the 
medium in which it travels and on the source that produced it. It is this wavelength 
that determines the color of a photon. A photon’s frequency is related to its wave-
length by λ = ν/f, where ν is the speed of the photon. In free space, ν is equal to the 
speed of light (c = 3.0 × 108 m/s), but in other media, such as glass, ν becomes smaller 
than the speed of light. A photon with a large wavelength (or small frequency) is 
less energetic than a photon with a shorter wavelength (or a higher frequency). The 
energy of a photon is equal to E = hf, where h is Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10−34 J∙s).
The trick to “making” a photon is to accelerate/decelerate a charged particle. For 
example, an electron that is made to vibrate back and forth within an antenna will pro-
duce radiofrequency photons that have very long wavelengths (low energies) when 
compared with light photons. Visible light, on the other hand, is produced when outer- 
shell electrons within atoms are forced to make transitions between energy levels, accel-
erating in the process. Other frequency photons may be created by vibrating or rotating 
molecules very quickly, while still others, specifically those with very high energy (e.g., 
gamma rays), can be created by the charge accelerations within the atomic nuclei.
Figure 5.2 shows the breakdown of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiofrequency 
photons extend from a few hertz to about 109 Hz (wavelengths from kilometers to 
about 0.3 m). They are often generated by alternating currents within power lines and 
electric circuits such as radio and television transmitters.
Microwave photons extend from about 109 up to 3 × 1011 Hz (wavelengths from 
30 cm to 1 mm). These photons can penetrate the earth’s atmosphere and hence are 
used in space vehicle communications, radio astronomy, and transmitting telephone 
conversations to satellites. They are also used for cooking food. Microwaves are often 
produced by atomic transitions and by electron and nuclear spins.
Infrared photons extend from about 3 × 1011 to 4 × 1014 Hz. Infrared radiation is cre-
ated by molecular oscillations and is commonly emitted from incandescent sources 
such as electric heaters, glowing coals, the sun, human bodies (which radiate photons 
in the range of 3000 to 10,000 nm), and special types of semiconductor devices.
Light photons comprise a narrow frequency band from about 3.84 × 1014 to about 
7.69 × 1014 Hz and are generally produced by a rearrangement of outer electrons in 
atoms and molecules. For example, in the filament of an incandescent light bulb, elec-
trons are randomly accelerated by applied voltages and undergo frequent  collision. 
These collisions result in a wide range of electron acceleration, and as a result, a broad 
frequency spectrum (within the light band) results, giving rise to white light.
Ultraviolet photons extend from approximately 8 × 1014 to 3.4 × 1016 Hz and are 
produced when an electron in an atom makes a long jump down from a highly 
excited state. The frequency of ultraviolet photons—unfortunately for us—tend to 
react badly with human cell DNA, which in turn can lead to skin cancer. The sun 

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    497
 produces a large output of ultraviolet radiation. Fortunately for us, protective ozone 
molecules in the upper atmosphere can absorb most of this ultraviolet radiation by 
converting the photon’s energy into a vibrating motion within the ozone molecule.
X- rays are highly energetic photons that extend from about 2.4 × 1016 to 5 × 1019 Hz, 
making their wavelengths often smaller than the diameter of an atom. One way of 
producing x- rays is to rapidly decelerate a high- speed charged particle. X- rays tend 
to act like bullets and can be used in x- ray imagery.
Gamma rays are the most energetic of the photons, whose frequency begins around 
5 × 1019 Hz. These photons are produced by particles undergoing transitions within 
the atomic nuclei. The wavelike properties of gamma rays are extremely difficult to 
observe.
5.2  Lamps
Lamps are devices that convert electric current into light energy. One approach used 
in the conversion process is to pass a current through a special kind of wire filament. 
As current collides with the filament’s atoms, the filament heats up, and photons 
are emitted. (As it turns out, this process produces a variety of different wavelength 
photons, so it appears that the emitted light is white in color.) Another approach 
used to produce light involves placing a pair of electrodes a small distance apart 
within a glass gas- enclosed bulb. When a voltage is set across the electrodes, the gas

Incandescent
These lamps use a tungsten wire filament to pro-
duce a glowing white light when current passes 
through it. The filament is enclosed in an evacu-
ated glass bulb filled with a gas such as argon, 
krypton, or nitrogen that helps increase the bril-
liance of the lamp and also helps prevent the 
 filament from burning out (as would be the case 
in an oxygen- rich environment). Incandescent 
lamps are used in flashlights, home lighting, 
and as indicator lights. They come in a variety 
of  different sizes and shapes, as well as various 
 current, voltage, and candlelight power ratings.
Halogen
Similar to a typical incandescent lamp, these 
lamps provide ultrabright output light. Unlike 
a typical incandescent lamp, the filament is 
coated on the inside of a quartz bulb. Within 
this bulb, a halogen gas, such as bromine or 
 iodine, is placed. These lamps are used in pro-
jector lamps, automotive headlights, strobe 
lights, etc.
Gas- Discharge
This lamp produces a dim, pale light that  results 
from the ionization of neon gas molecules 
 between two electrodes within the bulb. Types 
of gas- discharge lamps include neon, xenon 
flash, and mercury vapor lamps. Gas- discharge 
lamps have a tendency to suddenly switch on 
when a particular minimum operating voltage 
is met. For this reason, they are sometimes used 
in triggering and voltage- regulation applica-
tions. They are also used as indicator lights and 
for testing home ac power outlets.
Fluorescent
This is a lamp consisting of a mercury vapor–filled glass tube whose inner wall is coated with a 
material that fluoresces. At either end of the tube are cathode and anode incandescent filaments. 
When electrons emitted from an incandescent cathode electrode collide with the mercury atoms, 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation is emitted. The UV radiation then collides with the lamp’s florescent 
coating, emitting visible light in the process. Such lamps require an auxiliary glow lamp with 
 bimetallic contacts and a choke placed in parallel with the cathode and anode to initiate discharge 
within the lamp. These are highly efficient lamps that are often used in home lighting applications.

ionizes (electrons are stripped from the gas atoms) emitting photons in the process. 
Figure 5.3 gives an overview of some of the major kinds of lamps.
Technical Stuff about Light Bulbs
A lamp’s brightness is measured in what is called the mean spherical candle power 
(MSCP). Bulb manufacturers place a lamp at the center of an integrating sphere that 
averages the lamp’s light output over its surface. The actual value of the MSCP for a 
lamp is a function of color temperature of the emitting surface of the lamp’s filament. 
For a given temperature, doubling the filament’s surface area doubles the MSCP. 
Other technical things to consider about lamps include voltage and current ratings, 
life expectancy, physical geometry of the bulb, and filament type. Figure 5.4 shows a 
number of different bulb types.
In recent years, incandescent light bulbs have become something of a rarity. In 
domestic lighting situations, they have almost completely been replaced by compact 
fluorescent designs, and indeed are not even for sale in some European countries. 
There is also a trend toward using arrays of LEDs for illumination in place of incan-
descent bulbs (see the next section). In applications that formerly would have used 
incandescent indicator lights, LEDs now rule supreme. LEDs have a much longer life, 
lower power consumption, and much greater tolerance of physical and thermal shock.
5.3  Light- Emitting Diodes
Light- emitting diodes (LEDs) are two- lead devices that are similar to pn- junction 
diodes, except that they are designed to emit visible or infrared light. When a 
LED’s anode lead is made more positive in voltage than its cathode lead (by at 
least 0.6 to 2.2 V), current flows through the device and light is emitted. However, 
if the polarities are reversed (anode is made more negative than the cathode), the 
LED will not conduct, and hence it will not emit light. The symbol for an LED is 
shown in Fig. 5.5.
LEDs are available in a wide range of colors. Historically, red was the first LED 
color. Yellow and green and infrared LEDs followed. It was not until the 1990s that 
blue LEDs became available. These days, LEDs are available in pretty much any 
color, including white.
There are also high-powered LEDs that are used for illumination and organic 
LEDs (OLEDs) made from polymers that can be built into displays.
Often, LEDs (especially infrared LEDs) are used as transmitting elements in 
remote- control circuits (e.g., TV remote control). The receiving element in this case 
Xenon Flash Lamp
This is a gas- discharge lamp that is filled with 
a xenon gas that ionizes when a particular volt-
age is applied across its electrodes. These lamps 
come with three leads: an anode, a cathode, and a 
trigger- voltage lead. Normally, a particular volt-
age is applied across the anode and cathode leads, 
and the lamp is off. However, when a particular 
voltage is applied to the trigger lead, the gas sud-
FIGURE 5.3  (Continued)
denly ionizes and releases an extremely bright flash. These lamps are used in 
photographic applications and in special- effects lighting projects.

may be a phototransistor that responds to changes in LED light output by altering the 
current flow within the receiving circuit.
5.3.1  How an LED Works
The light- emitting section of an LED is made by joining n- type and p- type semicon-
ductors together to form a pn junction. When this pn junction is forward- biased, elec-
trons in the n side are excited across the pn junction and into the p side, where they

combine with holes. As the electrons combine with the holes, photons are emitted. 
Typically, the pn- junction section of an LED is encased in an epoxy shell that is doped 
with light- scattering particles to diffuse the light and make the LED appear brighter. 
Often a reflector placed beneath the semiconductor is used to direct light upward. 
The cathode and anode leads are made from a heavy- gauge conductor to help wick 
heat away from the semiconductor.

Visible- Light LEDs
These LEDs are inexpensive and durable devices that typically are used  
as indicator lights. Common colors include green (∼565 nm), yellow  
(∼585 nm), orange (∼615 nm), and red (∼650 nm). Maximum forward volt-
ages are about 1.8 V, with typical operating currents from 10 to 30 mA. 
Infrared LEDs
These LEDs are designed to emit infrared photons that have wavelength 
between approximately 880 and 940 nm. They are used in conjunction 
with a photosensor (e.g., photodiode, photoresistor, phototransistor) in 
remote- control circuits (e.g., TV remotes, intrusion alarms). They tend to 
have a narrower viewing angle when compared with a visible- light LED 
so that transmitted information can be directed efficiently. Photon output 
is characterized in terms of output power per specific forward current. 
Typical outputs range from around 0.50 mW/20 mA to 8.0 mW/50 mA. 
Maximum forward voltages at specific forward currents range from about 
1.60 V at 20 mA to 2.0 V at 100 mA.
Miniature

Lens
Blinking LEDs
These LEDs contain a miniature integrated circuit within their package 
that causes the LED to flash from 1 to 6 times each second. They are used 
primarily as indicator flashers, but may be used as simple oscillators.

502    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
5.3.3  More on LEDs
LEDs emit visible light, infrared radiation, or even ultraviolet radiation when 
forward- biased. Visible single- tone LEDs emit relatively narrow bands of green, yel-
low, orange, red, and blue light (with spectrum spread usually less than 40 nm at 
90 percent peak intensity). Infrared diodes emit one of several bands beyond red. 
Multicolor LEDs
Multicolor LEDs mount a number of LEDs in a single package. The color 
they produce is a mixture of the colors produced by each LED. The ulti-
mate multicolor LED is an RGB LED that has red, green, and blue LEDs 
within a single package. This allows any color to be mixed by controlling 
the brightness of each of the LEDs, with white light being produced if all 
the LEDs are on with equal intensity. The packages usually have a com-
mon anode or common cathode connection.
  A variation on this has red and green LEDs back to back to indicate 
polarity (the polarity of the supply voltage will determine which LED is 
forward-biased and on, and which is reverse-biased and off).

LED Displays
These are used for displaying numbers and other characters. In the LED 
display shown here, seven individual LEDs are used to make up the 
display. When a voltage is applied across one of the LEDs, a portion of 
the 8 lights up. Unlike liquid- crystal displays, LED displays tend to be 
more rugged, but they also consume more power. 
  As well as such seven-segment LEDs, LED packages containing 
LEDs in a matrix are also available.

White LEDs provide a variety of wavelengths to mimic white light and are used in 
low- level lighting applications, such as backlighting, headlamps, and nightlights.
High-power LEDs (HPLEDs) are now available. These have forward currents of 
hundreds of mA to more than 1 A. Such LEDs are very bright but also generate a lot 
of heat. They must be mounted on a heat sink to prevent thermal destruction.
LEDs have very fast response times, excellent efficiency, and long lifetimes. They 
are current- dependent devices whose light output is directly proportional to the for-
ward current.
To light an LED, apply a voltage greater than the LED’s forward voltage VLED, and 
limit current flow via a series resistor to a level below the LED’s maximum rating, 
usually to ILED—the manufacturer’s recommended value. The following equation is 
used to select the series resistor:

VLED varies with LED color. Typical VLED values are 1.7 V for non- high- brightness 
red, 1.9 V for high- brightness high- efficiency low- current red, 2 V for orange and 
yellow, 2.1 V for green, 3.4 to 3.6 V for bright white and most blue types, and 6 V 
for 430- nm blue. Given the preceding voltage drops, it’s a good idea to use at least a 
3- V supply voltage for lower- voltage LEDs, 4.5 V for 3.4- V types, and 6 V for 430- nm 
blue. If you don’t know the recommended ILED value of a given LED, it’s usually safe 
to assume it will be around 20 mA. Table 5.1 shows the range of LED types and cor-
responding characteristic values.

5.3.4  LED Applications
FIGURE 5.10  (a) It’s important to keep the LED current flow below the maximum rating. Select a series current- limiting 
resistor according to the provided formula. A 1K pot can be added to provide variable light- intensity control. (b) Here’s a 
circuit that can be used to power LEDs from an ac line. The key is the capacitor, which acts to attenuate the ac signal, and 
the resistor, which acts to limit the current level. Since the capacitor must pass current in both directions, a small diode is 
connected in parallel with the LED to provide a path for the negative half cycle and also to limit the reverse voltage across 
the LED. A second LED with polarity reverse may be substituted for the diode, or a tricolor LED could be used, which 
would appear orange with alternating current. The resistor is chosen to limit the worst- case inrush current to about 150 
mA, which will drop to less than 30 mA in a millisecond, as the capacitor charges. The 0.47- µF capacitor has a reactance of 
5640 Ω at 60 Hz, so the LED current is about 20 mA half wave, or 10 mA average. A larger capacitor will increase the cur-
rent and a smaller one will reduce it. The capacitor must be a nonpolarized type with a voltage rating of 200 V or more.  
(c) This is also an ac- line powered arrangement used to create a nightlight using white LEDs. Like the previous circuit, the 
0.47- µF input capacitor attenuates the ac voltage level, and the 180- Ω resistor acts to limit current. The bridge rectifier with 
attached filter capacitor creates a near constant dc voltage, while the zener diode acts to regulate the voltage level. In this 
case, there are four white LEDs in series, each with a 3.4- V drop, for a total voltage drop of 13.6 V; therefore, a 15- V zener is 
used. (d) Do not put LEDs in parallel with each other without using individual dropping resistors for each LED. Although 
this usually works, it is not reliable. LEDs become more conductive as they warm up, which may lead to unstable current 
distribution through paralleled LEDs. LEDs in parallel need their own individual dropping resistors, as shown in the 
figure. Series strings can be paralleled if each string has its own dropping resistors. (e) It’s okay to put LEDs in series with 
a single common series resistor. Simply add up the voltage drops of all the diodes in series, and use that value in place of 
VLED in the series- resistor formula. It’s a good idea not to exceed 80 percent of the supply voltage in order to maintain good 
stability and predicable current consumption. (f) Here, a zener diode is used to create a simple voltage- level indicator: 
when the voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage of the zener, current flows, lighting the LED. (g) This circuit reverses the 
polarity at the output using a DPDT switch. D1 goes on when the polarity is one way, and D2 goes on when the polarity is 
another way. (h) Two LEDs in reverse- parallel make up a simple polarity indicator. Note that both LEDs appear on with ac. 
(i) Basic circuit showing how to use tricolor LEDs. (j) Blinking LEDs don’t require a series resistor, but don’t apply more 
than the recommended supply voltage—3 to 9 V is a safe range. A zener placed in reverse parallel with the blinking LED 
can be used for overvoltage protection. A number of standard LEDs can be made to blink using a blinking LED. You can 
also use the blinking LED to drive transistors that can be made to switch on and off as the blinking LED flashes.

506    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In Chap. 13, we will look at how you drive LED displays from a microcontroller, 
including techniques such as multiplexing, Charlieplexing, and driving RGB LEDs 
with PWM signals to mix colors.
5.3.5  Laser Diodes
Laser diodes are light- emitting diodes with two “mirrors” on the surface of the diode 
to create a laser cavity. When the diode is forward- biased, charges are injected into 
the active area of the junction, while electrons and holes recombine in the junction, 
creating spontaneous emission of photons. These photons can cause other electron- 
hole pairs to recombine by stimulated emission. When the current is high enough, 
the device lases. Laser diodes are driven by low- voltage power and usually incorpo-
rate optical feedback from a monitor photodiode (commonly built into the same laser 
diode package) to regulate the laser diode current.
FIGURE 5.11  Figure shows a rough diagram of a laser diode of the type found in a laser pointer or CD player. The size 
of the package is typically 5 to 10 mm overall, but the laser diode chip is less than 1 mm in length. The maxim beam as it 
emerges from the laser diode is wedge- shaped and highly divergent (unlike a helium- neon laser) with a typical spread of 
10 by 30°. External optics are required to produce anything approaching a parallel (collimated) beam. A simple (spheri-
cal) short- focal- length convex lens will work reasonably well for this purpose, but diode laser modules and laser pointers 
might use a lens that at least on the surface is aspheric (not ground to a spherical shape, as are most common lenses). The 
beam from the back end of the laser diode chip hits a built- in photodiode that is normally used in an optoelectronic feed-
back loop to regulate current and thus beam power.

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    507
Compared to LEDs, laser diodes have quicker response times and very narrow 
spectrum spread (around 1 nm), and can focus radiation to a spot as small as 1 µm 
in diameter—even for a cheap laser diode using simple optics found in a CD player. 
Unlike gas lasers, however, a laser diode’s output beam is divergent, typically ellipti-
cal or wedge- shaped, and astigmatic, requiring refocusing.
The output wavelength of a laser diode is usually fixed to a single mode: for 
example red (635 nm, 670 nm), infrared (780 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, 1,550 nm, etc.), and 
green, blue, violet. However, multimode laser diodes also exist where the emission 
spectrum consists of several individual spectral lines with a dominant line (line with 
greatest intensity) occurring at the nominal wavelength of the device. Multimode 
laser diodes are often desirable  because problems with mode hops are suppressed— 
consequently, they generally have a better signal- to- noise ratio. Mode hops are slight 
changes in the wavelength caused by thermal expansion of the laser cavity.
Typical optical output for low- powered laser diodes range from around 1 mW to 
5 mW, while high- power laser diodes can reach 100 W or more. The highest- power 
units consist of arrays of laser diodes—not a single device alone.
Laser diodes are used in CD players, CD- ROM drives, and DVD and Blu-ray 
players. They are also used in laser printers, laser fax machines, laser pointers, sight-
ing and alignment scopes, measurement equipment, high- speed fiber- optic and free- 
space communication systems; as pump source for other lasers; in bar- code and UPC 
scanners; and in high- performance imagers. In those applications requiring high- 
speed modulation or pulse rates (into the gigahertz range), special integrated driver 
chips are needed to control the laser diode drive current (more on that in a bit).
A variety of small laser diodes are found in CD players, CD- ROM drives, laser 
printers, and bar- code scanners. The most common laser diodes around are those 
used in CD players and CD- ROM drives. These produce a mostly invisible beam in 
the near infrared spectrum at 780 nm. The optical output from the actual laser diode 
itself may be up to 5 mW, but once it passes through the optics leading to the CD, the 
power drops to 0.3 to 1 mW. Higher- power IR laser diodes found in read- write drives 
have more power output—up to 30 mW or so. Even higher-power blue laser diodes 
can be found in Blu-ray players.
Visible laser diodes have replaced the helium- neon lasers used in bar- code scan-
ners, laser pointers, positioning devices in medicine (e.g., CT and MRI scanners), and 
many other applications. The first visible- light laser diode emitted with a wavelength 
around 670 nm in the deep red spectrum. More recently, 650- and 635- nm red laser 
diodes have dropped in price. 635 to 650- nm laser diodes are used in DVD technol-
ogy. The shorter wavelength compared to 780 nm is one of the several improvements 
that enable DVDs to store about eight times the amount of information as CDs (4 to 
5 GB per layer and up to two layers on each side of the disc, as compared to a typical 
CD that stores only around 650 MB). Like the IR laser diodes, the visible laser diodes 
have a typical maximum power around 3 to 5 mW, and cost about $10 to $50 for 
the basic laser diode device—more with optics and drive electronics. Higher- power 
types are also available but can cost upward of several hundred dollars for something 
like a 20- mW module. Very high- power diode lasers using arrays of laser diodes or 
laser diode bars with power output of watts or greater may cost thousands of dollars.
It’s important to note that you should never look into a laser beam or any specular 
reflection of the laser beam—“you might poke your eye out.” Also, laser diodes are  

508    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD), so it’s important to use ground-
ing straps and grounded equipment when working with them, as well as following 
manufacturer’s suggested handling precautions.
Laser Diode Drive Circuits
You should never drive a laser diode without the proper drive circuitry. Without the 
proper drive circuitry, you can run into all sorts of problems stemming from swings 
in operating temperature with unstable injection current. The results can lead to a 
fried laser diode, or one whose life is short. For this reason, it’s important to have a 
driver circuit that can provide stable current without the possibility of supply tran-
sients screwing things up. Two basic techniques used to achieve stable optical output 
from a laser diode are described here.
Automatic current control (ACC) or constant current circuit: This involves driving the 
laser diode without a photodiode feedback loop; the laser diode is simply driven 
at constant current. This is a simple method to use, but the optical output will 
fluctuate as the laser diode temperature changes. However, there are circuits 
and corresponding laser diodes that are designed to control the diode’s operat-
ing temperature (without using the photodiode) that are very popular. The con-
stant current circuit with temperature control provides faster control loop and 
precision current reference for accurately monitoring laser current. In addition, 
in many cases, the laser diode’s internal photodiode may exhibit drift and have 
a poor noise characteristic. If performance of the internal photodiode is inferior, 
the laser diode’s optical output is liable to be noisy and unstable. Constant current 
operation without temperature control, however, is generally not a good idea, 
except in cheap, low- power situations (cheap laser pointers, etc.). If the operating 
temperature of the laser diode decreases significantly, the optical power output 
will increase, and this could easily exceed its maximum rating.
Automatic power control (APC) circuit: This drive circuit is based on a photodiode feed-
back loop that monitors the optical output and provides a control signal for the 
laser diode to maintain a constant optical output level. Constant power control 
prevents the possibility of the optical power output increasing as the laser diode’s 
temperature decreases. However, when operating in the constant power mode 
and without temperature control, mode hops and changes in wavelength will still 
occur. Also, if the diode’s heat sink is inadequate and the temperature is allowed 
to rise, the optical power will decrease. In turn, the drive circuit will increase the 
injection current, attempting to maintain the optical power at a constant level. 
Without an absolute current limit, thermal runaway is possible and the laser may 
be damaged or destroyed in the process.
Regardless of the type of drive circuit used, the key is to prevent the drive current 
from overshooting the maximum operating level. Exceeding the maximum optical 
output, even for a nanosecond, will damage the mirror coatings on the laser diode 
end facets. Your typical laboratory power supply should not be used to directly drive 
a laser diode—it simply  doesn’t provide enough protection. Typical drive circuits 
incorporate slow- start circuitry, capacitive filtering, and other provisions to elimi-
nate supply spikes, surges, and other switching transients.

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    509
Figure 5.12 shows a few do- it- yourself laser diode supplies. Though these drive 
circuits will work with many low- powered laser diodes that don’t require modula-
tion, it’s worth your while to check out the laser data manufacturer’s data sheets for 
recommended drive circuits. Creating your own drive circuits can be very tricky, and 
you’ll probably end up frying a few expensive laser diodes in the process. Of course, 
you can also buy a laser diode drive chip, which may be the best bet if you’re doing 
something a bit more complex than creating a laser pointer. These drive chips may 
support high- bit- rate modulation in addition to providing the constant current needed 
for optically stable power. Other types of chips can be adapted to linear and switching 
regulators. Some companies worth checking out include MAXIM, Linear Technology, 
Sharp, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Analog Devices, and Burr- Brown. Often, these manufac-
turers provide free samples.
FIGURE 5.12  (a) This circuit can be used to identify the proper connections and polarity and then to drive the laser diode 
for testing purposes. Here a 0-  to 10- VDC supply with current- limiting resistor is in series with the diode. If your power 
supply has a current limiter, set it at 20 to 25 mA to start. You can always increase it later. R2 limits the maximum current. 
If you know the specs for your diode, this is a good idea (and to protect your power supply, too). You can always reduce 
its value if your laser diode requires more than about 85 mA (with R2 = 100 Ω). (b) This runs on a (wall adapter) power 
supply from 6 to 9 V. There is heavy capacitive filtering in this circuit. Changes would be needed to enable this circuit to 
be modulated at any reasonable rate. Note that C4 is estimated; also, an LM341 shunt regulator set up as a 2.5- V reference 
could replace the 2.5- V zener. (c) The resistor value depends on your specific laser diode current requirements. Power is 
provided by a 5.5- to 9- VDC battery. For the resistor, a small 10- Ω carbon resistor in series with a precision 20- Ω adjustable 
resistor can be used. It’s a good idea to place three ordinary diodes in series instead of a laser diode, then measure the cur-
rent through them and adjust the resistor until the necessary current level is reached, in this case 50 to 60 mA. You can turn 
up the current, never exceeding your diode’s maximum limit. The dim glow will increase in intensity, but at some point 
a distinctive step in intensity is reached. (d) This circuit is from an inexpensive laser pointer. It includes some capacitive 
filtering, as well as a power- adjust pot R1. Unlike the previous circuit, this one  doesn’t have any absolute reference, so 
power output will be dependent on the battery voltage to some extent. It’s possible to modulate this module at a reason-
able frequency by removing or greatly reducing the value of the filter capacitor C1. 

510    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
DRIVE CIRCUIT PRECAUTIONS
Even with a suitable drive circuit, watch out for intermittent or unreliable connections 
between the laser diode and the drive circuit. An intermittent contact in the photodi-
ode feedback circuit will usually destroy a laser diode. Even if a power- control poten-
tiometer’s wiper breaks contact with the resistive element, there can be problems. 
Also, never use a switch or relay to make or break the connection between the drive 
circuit and the laser diode. The following are some other laser diode precautions:
Power measurement: It’s not safe to assume that the optical power output of a laser 
diode will match what’s stated in the manufacturer’s minimum- maximum data— 
each diode will have a unique operating characteristic as a result of manufac-
turing tolerances. For accuracy, you must measure the output with an optical 
power meter or a calibrated photodiode. Remember, once the laser diode is 
past the threshold point, stimulated emission is achieved and the optical output 
increases significantly for a small increase in forward current. Therefore, a very 
slight increase in drive current may cause the optical output to exceed the abso-
lute maximum. Also, make sure to include optical losses through any lenses or 
other components when making measurements and calculations.
Operating temperature and heat sinks: In most applications, laser diodes require heat 
sinks, especially when operating continuously. Without a heat sink, the laser 
diode junction temperature will quickly increase, causing optical output to 
degrade. If the laser diode temperature continues to rise, exceeding the maxi-
mum operating temperature, the diode can be catastrophically damaged or the 
long- term performance may degrade significantly. Generally, a lower operating 
temperature will help extend the diode’s lifetime. Visible laser diodes with lower 
wavelengths (e.g., ∼635 nm) are typically more sensitive to temperature than the 
IR laser diodes. Often, thermoelectric cooling is required to keep temperatures 
down. When using heat sinks, a small amount of non- silicone- type heat sink com-
pound improves thermal conductivity between laser diode and heat sink.
Windows: Keep laser diode windows and other opticals in the path clean. Dust or fin-
gerprints will cause diffraction or interference in the laser output that can result in 
lower output or anomalies in the far- field pattern. The window should be cleaned 
using a cotton swab and ethanol.
The Easy Way Out: Laser Diode Modules and Laser Pointers
If all you really want is a visible laser to shoot around, a commercial diode laser mod-
ule or some brands of laser pointers (those that include optical feedback based on laser 
power regulation) may be the ticket. Both the modules and laser pointers include a 
 driver circuit capable of operating reliably on unregulated low- voltage dc input and 
a collimating lens matched to the laser diode. Many of the modules will permit fine 
adjustment of the lens position to optimize the collimation or permit focusing to a point 
at a particular distance. However, neither the module nor the pointer is designed to be 
modulated at any more than a few hertz, due to heavy internal filtering designed to 
protect the laser diode from power spikes. Therefore, they are generally not suited for 
laser communication applications. In general, it’s a whole lot easier starting out with 
the module or pointer rather than a laser diode and homemade power supply, or even 

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    511
a commercial driver, if it isn’t explicitly designed for your particular laser diode. There 
is no way to know how reliable or robust an inexpensive laser pointer will be, or if the 
beam quality will be acceptable. Diode laser modules are generally more expensive 
and of higher quality than the pointers, so they may be better for serious applications. 
Also, consider a helium- neon laser, since even the cheapest type is likely to generate 
a beam with better beam quality than the typical diode laser module or laser pointer.
Laser Diode Specifications
Lasing wavelength, λp: The wavelength of light emitted by the laser diode. For a single- 
mode device, this is the wavelength of the single spectral line of the laser output. 
For a multimode device, this is the wavelength of the spectral line with the greatest 
intensity.
Threshold current, Ith: The boundary between spontaneous emission and the stimulated 
emission shown on the optical power output versus forward current curve. Below 
the threshold current point, the output resembles the incoherent output from an 
LED; at or above the specified threshold current, the device begins to produce laser 
output. Once past the threshold point, stimulated emission is achieved and the 
optical output increases significantly for small increases in forward current.
Operating current, Iop: The amount of forward current through the laser diode necessary 
to produce the specified typical optical output at a specified operating temperature.
Operating voltage, Vop: The forward voltage across the laser diode when the device 
produces its specified typical optical output at a specified operating temperature.
Optical power output, PO: Maximum allowable instantaneous optical power output in 
either continuous or pulse operation.
Operating temperature range: Range of case temperatures within which the device may 
be safely operated.
Monitor current, Im: The current through the photodiode, at a specified reverse- bias 
voltage, when the laser diode is producing its typical optical power output.
Photodiode dark current, ID(PD): The current through the reverse- biased internal monitor 
photodiode when the laser is not emitting.
Reverse voltage, VR: Maximum allowable voltage when reverse bias is applied to the laser 
diode or photodiode. For laser diodes with an internal monitor photodiode, the reverse 
voltage is specified for the laser diode as VL(LD) and for the photodiode as VR(PD).
Aspect ratio, AR: The ratio of the laser diode’s divergence angles, θ⊥ (perpendicular) 
and θ ∙ (parallel). A diode with a 30° perpendicular divergence and a 10° parallel 
divergence has an elliptical beam with an aspect ratio of 3:1.
Astigmatism, As or Das: The laser beam appears to have different source points for 
the directions perpendicular and parallel to the junction plane. The astigmatic 
distance is defined as the distance between the two apparent sources. A laser 
diode with a large amount of astigmatism must have the astigmatism corrected 
(or reduced) if the laser diode output is to be accurately focused—otherwise, the 
resulting focused beam will be astigmatic.
Beam divergence, θ⊥ and θ∙: Also referred to as radiation angles. The beam divergence 
is measured as the full angle and at the half- maximum intensity point, known 

512    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
as full- width half- maximum, or FWHM. Angular specifications are provided for 
both the perpendicular axis and the parallel axis.
Polarization ratio: The output from a single- cavity laser diode is linearly polarized par-
allel to the laser junction. Spontaneous emission with a random polarization and/or 
with a polarization perpendicular to the laser junction is also present. The polar-
ization ratio is defined as the parallel component divided by the perpendicular 
component. For a diode operating near its maximum power, the ratio is typically 
greater than 100:1. When operating near the threshold point, the ratio would be 
considerably lower as the spontaneous emission becomes more significant.
Slope efficiency, SE: Also referred to as differential efficiency. This is the mean value of 
the incremental change in optical power for an incremental change in forward 
current when the device is operating in the lasing region of the optical power 
output versus forward current curve.
Rise time: Time required for the optical output to rise from 10 percent to 90 percent of 
its maximum value.
Positional accuracy (Dx, Dy, Dz): Also referred to as emission point accuracy. These speci-
fications define the positional accuracy of the laser diode emitter with respect to 
the device package. Dx and Dy are measured as the planar displacement of the 
chip from the physical axis of the package. Dz is measured perpendicular to the 
reference surface. Specifications may list both angular error expressed in degrees 
and the linear error in microns.
5.4  Photoresistors
Photoresistors are light- controlled variable resistors. These are also known as light-
dependent resistors (LDRs). In terms of operation, a photo resistor is usually very 
resistive (in the megaohms) when placed in the dark. However, when it is illumi-
nated, its resistance decreases significantly; it may drop as low as a few hundred 
ohms, depending on the light intensity. In terms of applications, photoresistors are 
used in light- and dark- activated switching circuits and in light- sensitive detector 
circuits. Figure 5.13 shows the symbol for a photoresistor.
5.4.1  How a Photoresistor Works
FIGURE 5.13
Photoresistors are made from a special kind 
of semiconductor crystal, such as cadmium 
sulfide (for light) or lead sulfide (for infra-
red). When this semiconductor is placed in 
the dark, electrons within its structure do not 
want to flow through the resistor because they 
are too strongly bound to the crystal’s atoms. 
However, when illuminated, incoming pho-
tons of light collide with the bound electrons, 
 stripping them from the binding atom, thus 
creating a hole in the process. These liber-
ated electrons can now contribute to the cur-
rent flowing through the device (the resistance 
goes down).

5.4.2  Technical Stuff
Photoresistors may require a few milliseconds or more to fully respond to changes 
in light intensity and may require a few seconds to return to their normal dark resis-
tance once light is removed. In general, photoresistors pretty much all function in 
a similar manner. However, the sensitivity and resistance range of a photoresis-
tor may vary greatly from one device to the next. Also, certain photoresistors may 
respond better to light that contains photons within a particular wavelength of 
the spectrum. For example, cadmium sulfide photoresistors respond best to light 
within the 400- to 800- nm range, whereas lead sulfide photoresistors respond best 
to infrared photons.

As the intensity of light increases, the resis-
tance of the photoresistor decreases, so Vout in 
the top circuit gets smaller as more light hits 
it, whereas Vout in the lower circuit gets larger.
Simple Light Meter
Here, a photoresistor acts as the light- sensing 
element in a simple light meter. When dark, 
the photoresistor is very resistive, and little 
current flows through the series loop; the 
 meter is at its lowest deflection level. When an 
increasingly bright light source is shone on the 
photoresistor, the photoresistor’s resistance 
begins to decrease, and more current begins to 
flow through the series loop; the meter starts to 
deflect. The potentiometer is used to adjust the 
sensitivity of the meter.

Dark- Activated Relay
The two circuits shown here make use of light- 
sensitive voltage dividers to trip a relay whenever 
the light intensity changes. In the light- activated 
circuit, when light comes in contact with the 
 photoresistor, the photoresistor’s resistance de-
creases, causing an increase in the transistor’s 
base current and voltage. If the base current and 
voltage are large enough, the transistor will allow 
enough current to pass from collector to emitter, 
triggering the relay. The dark- activated  relay 
works in a similar but opposite manner. The 
value of R1 in the light- activated circuit should be 
around 1 kΩ but may need some adjusting. R1 in 
the dark- activated circuit (100 kΩ) also may need 
adjusting. A 6- to 9- V relay with a 500- Ω coil can 
be used in either circuit.
5.5  Photodiodes
Photodiodes are two- lead devices that convert light energy (photon energy) directly 
into electric current. If the anode and cathode leads of a photodiode are joined together 
by a wire and then the photodiode is placed in the dark, no current will flow through 
the wire. However, when the photodiode is illuminated, it suddenly becomes a small 
current source that pumps conventional current from the anode through the wire and 
into the cathode. Figure 5.16 depicts the symbol for a photo diode.
FIGURE 5.16
Photodiodes are used most commonly to detect fast pulses of near- infrared light 
used in wireless communications. They are often found in light- meter circuits (e.g., 
camera light meters, intrusion alarms, etc.) because they have very linear light/cur-
rent responses.

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    515
A photodiode is built by sandwiching a very thin n- type semiconductor together 
with a thicker p- type semiconductor. (The n side has an abundance of electrons; the 
p side has an abundance of holes.) The n side of the combination is considered the 
cathode, while the p side is considered the anode. Now, if you shine light on this 
de vice, a number of photons will pass through the n- semiconductor and into the 
p- semiconductor. Some of the photons that make it into the p side will then collide 
with bound electrons within the p- semiconductor, ejecting them and creating holes 
in the process. If these collisions are close enough to the pn interface, the ejected 
electrons will then cross the junction. What you get in the end is extra electrons on 
the n side and extra holes on the p side. This segregation of positive and negative 
charges leads to a potential difference being formed across the p-n junction. Now if 
you connect a wire from the cathode (n side) to the anode (p side), electrons will flow 
through the wire, from the electron- abundant cathode end to the hole- abundant 
anode end (or if you like, a conventional positive current will flow from the anode 
to cathode). A commercial photodiode typically places the p-n  semiconductor in a 
plastic or metal case that contains a window. The window may contain a magnifying 
lens and a filter.
5.5.2  Basic Operations
Here, a photodiode acts to convert light energy 
directly into electric current that can be mea-
sured with a meter. The input intensity of light 
(brightness) and the output current are nearly 
linear.
Photovoltaic Current Source
FIGURE 5.18
Photoconductive Operation
Individual photodiodes may not produce enough current needed to drive 
a particular light- sensitive circuit. Usually they are incorporated along 
with a voltage source. Here, a photodiode is connected in reversed- biased 
 direction with a battery. When dark, a small current called the dark current 
(within the nA range) flows through the photodiode. When the photodi-
ode is illuminated, a larger current flows. This circuit, unlike the preceding 
circuit, uses the battery for increased output current. A resistor placed in 
series with the diode and battery can be used to calibrate the meter. Note 
that if you treat the photodiode as if it were an ordinary diode, conduction 
will not occur; it must be pointed in the opposite direction.
5.5.3  Kinds of Photodiodes
Photodiodes come in all shapes and sizes. Some come with built- in lenses, some come 
with optical filters, some are designed for high- speed responses, some have large 
surface areas for high sensitivity, and some have small surface areas. When the sur-
face area of a photodiode increases, the response time tends to slow down. Table 5.2 
presents a sample portion of a specifications table for a photodiode.

5.6  Solar Cells
Solar cells are photodiodes with very large surface areas. The large surface area of a 
solar cell makes the device more sensitive to incoming light, as well as more power-
ful (larger currents and voltages) than photodiodes. For example, a single silicon 
solar cell may be capable of producing a 0.5- V potential that can supply up to 0.1 A 
when exposed to bright light.
FIGURE 5.20

Solar cells can be used to power small devices such as solar- powered calculators 
or can be added in series to recharge nickel cadmium batteries. Often solar cells are 
used as light- sensitive elements in detectors of visible and near- infrared light (e.g., 
light meters, light- sensitive triggering mechanism for relays). Like photodiodes, solar 
cells have a positive and negative lead that must be connected to the more positive 
and more negative voltage regions within a circuit. The typical response time for a 
solar cell is around 20 ms.

Chapter 5: Optoelectronics    517
5.6.1  Basic Operations
Power Sources
Like batteries, solar cells can be combined in 
series or parallel configurations. Each solar cell 
produces an open- circuit voltage from around 
0.45 to 0.5 V and may generate as much as 0.1 A  
in bright light. By adding cells in  series, 
the output voltage becomes the sum of the 
 individual cell voltages. When cells are placed 
in parallel, the output current increases.

Battery Recharger
The circuit here shows how nine solar cells 
placed in series can be used to recharge two 
1.5- V NiCd cells. (Each cell provides 0.5 V, so 
the total voltage is 4.5 V minus a 0.6- V drop 
due to the diode.) The diode is added to the 
circuit to prevent the NiCd cells from dis-
charging through the solar cell during times of 
darkness. It is important not to exceed the safe 
charging rate of NiCd cells. To slow the charge 
rate, a resistor placed in series with the batteries 
can be added.

5.7  Phototransistors
Phototransistors are light- sensitive transistors. A common type of phototransistor 
resembles a bipolar transistor with its base lead removed and replaced with a light- 
sensitive surface area. When this surface area is kept dark, the device is off (prac-
tically no current flows through the collector- to- emitter region). However, when 
the light- sensitive region is exposed to light, a small base current is generated that 
controls a much larger collector- to- emitter current. Field- effect phototransistors 
(photoFETs) are light- sensitive field- effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transis-
tors, photoFETs use light to generate a gate voltage that is used to control a drain- 
source current. PhotoFETs are extremely sensitive to variations in light but are more 
fragile (electrically speaking) than bipolar phototransistors.

5.7.1  How a Phototransistor Works
Figure 5.23 shows a simple model of a two- lead bipolar phototransistor. The details 
of how this device works are given below.
FIGURE 5.23

The bipolar phototransistor resembles a bipolar transistor (with no base lead) that 
has an extra large p- type semiconductor region that is open for light exposure. When 
photons from a light source collide with electrons within the p- type semiconductor, 
they gain enough energy to jump across the pn- junction energy barrier—provided 
the photons are of the right frequency/energy. As electrons jump from the p region 
into the lower n region, holes are created in the p- type semiconductor. The extra elec-
trons injected into the lower n- type slab are drawn toward the positive terminal of the 
battery, while electrons from the negative terminal of the battery are drawn into the 
upper n- type semiconductor and across the n-p junction, where they combine with 
the holes. The net result is an electron current that flows from the emitter to the col-
lector. In terms of conventional currents, everything is backward. That is, you would 
say that when the base region is exposed to light, a positive current I flows from the 
collector to the emitter. Commercial phototransistors often place the pnp semicon-
ductor in an epoxy case that also acts as a magnifying lens. Other phototransistors 
use a metal container and a plastic window to encase the chip.
5.7.2  Basic Configurations
In many ways, a phototransistor is much like 
an ordinary bipolar transistor. Here, you can 
see the emitter- follower (current gain, no 
voltage gain) and the common- emitter ampli-
fier (voltage gain) configurations. The emitter- 
follower and common- emitter circuits are 
 discussed in Chap. 4.

5.7.3  Kinds of Phototransistors
Three- Lead Phototransistor
Two- lead phototransistors may not be able to 
inject enough electrons into the base region to 
promote a desired collector- to- emitter current. 
For this reason, a three- lead phototransistor 
with a base lead may be used. The extra base 
lead can be fed external current to help boost 
the number of electrons injected into the base 
region. In effect, the base current depends on 
both the light intensity and the supplied base 
current. With optoelectronic circuits, three- 
lead phototransistors are often used in place 
of two- lead devices, provided the base is left 
untouched.
Photodarlington
This is similar to a conventional bipolar Dar-
lington transistor but is light- sensitive. Photo-
darlingtons are much more sensitive to light 
than ordinary phototransistors, but they tend 
to have slower response times. These devices 
may or may not come with a base lead.

5.7.4  Technical Stuff
Like ordinary transistors, phototransistors have maximum breakdown voltages and 
current and power dissipation ratings. The collector current IC through a phototran-
sistor depends directly on the input radiation density, the dc current gain of the 
device, and the external base current (for three- lead phototransistors). When a photo-
transistor is used to control a collector- to- emitter current, a small amount of leakage 
current, called the dark current ID, will flow through the device even when the device 
is kept in the dark. This current is usually insignificant (within the nA range). Table 
5.3 presents a portion of a typical data sheet for phototransistors.

520    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
5.7.5  Applications
Light- Activated Relay
Here, a phototransistor is used to control the 
base current supplied to a power- switching 
transistor that is used to supply current to a 
relay. In the light- activated circuit, when light 
comes in contact with the phototransistor, the 
phototransistor turns on, allowing current to 
pass from the supply into the base of the power- 
switching transistor. The power- switching tran-
sistor then turns on, and current flows through 
the relay, triggering it to switch states. In the 
dark- activated circuit, an opposite effect occurs. 
When light is removed from the phototransis-
tor, the phototransistor turns off, allowing more 
current to enter the base of the power- switching 
transistor. The 100- k potentiometers are used to 
adjust the sensitivity of both devices by control-
ling current flow through the phototransistor.
Receiver Circuit
The circuit shown here illustrates how a 
phototransistor can be used as a modulated 
lightwave detector with an amplifier section 
 (current gain amplifier). R2 and R3 are used 
to set the dc operating point of the power- 
switching transistor, and R1 is used to set the 
sensitivity of the phototransistor. The capaci-
tor acts to block unwanted dc signals from 
 entering the amplifier section.
FIGURE 5.26
Tachometer
Here is a simple example of how a phototran-
sistor can be used as a simple input stage for 
a frequency counter, or tachometer. A rotat-
ing disk with a hole (connected to a rotating 
shaft) will pass light through its hole once ev-
ery revolution. The light that passes will then 
trigger the phototransistor into conduction. A 
frequency counter is used to count the number 
of electrical pulses generated.

5.8  Photothyristors
Photothyristors are light- activated thyristors. Two common photothyristors include 
the light- activated SCR (LASCR) and the light- activated triac. A LASCR acts like a 
switch that changes states whenever it is exposed to a pulse of light. Even when the 
light is removed, the LASCR remains on until the anode and cathode polarities are 
reversed or the power is removed. A light- active triac is similar to a LASCR but is 
designed to handle ac currents. The symbol for a LASCR is shown below.
FIGURE 5.27
cathode
gate

LASCR
5.8.1  How LASCRs Work
The equivalent circuit shown here helps  explain 
how a LASCR works. Again, like other p-n 
 junction optoelectronic device, a photon will 
collide with an electron in the p- semiconductor 
side, and an electron will be ejected across the 
p-n junction into the n side. When a number of 
photons liberate a number of electrons across 
the junction, a large enough current at the base 
is generated to turn the transistors on. Even 
when the photons are eliminated, the LASCR 
will remain on until the polarities of the anode 
and cathode are reversed or the power is cut. 
(This results from the fact that the transistors’ 
bases are continuously simulated by the main 
current flowing through the anode and cathode 
leads.)

5.8.2  Basic Operation
When no light is present, the LASCR is off; no 
current will flow through the load. However, 
when the LASCR is illuminated, it turns on, 
 allowing current to flow through the load. The 
resistor in this circuit is used to set the trigger-
ing level of the LASCR.

5.9  Optoisolators
Optoisolators/optocouplers are devices that interconnect two circuits by means of 
an optical interface. For example, a typical optoisolator may consist of an LED and a 
photo transistor enclosed in a light- tight container. The LED portion of the optoiso-
lator is connected to the source circuit, whereas the phototransistor portion is con-
nected to the detector circuit. Whenever the LED is supplied current, it emits photons 
that are detected by the phototransistor. There are many other kinds of source- sensor 
combinations, such as LED- photodiode, LED- LASCR, and lamp- photoresistor pairs.
In terms of applications, optoisolators are used frequently to provide electrical 
isolation between two separate circuits. This means that one circuit can be used to 
control another circuit without undesirable changes in voltage and current that might 
occur if the two circuits were connected electrically. Isolation couplers typically are 
enclosed in a dark container, with both source and sensor facing each other. In such 
an arrangement, the optoisolator is referred to as a closed pair (see Fig. 5.30a). Besides 
being used for electrical isolation applications, closed pairs are also used for level con-
versions and solid- state relaying. A slotted coupler/interrupter is a device that contains 
an open slot between the source and sensor through which a blocker can be placed 
to interrupt light signals (see Fig. 5.30b). These devices are frequently used for object 
detection, bounce- free switching, and vibration detection. A reflective pair is another 
kind of optoisolator configuration that uses a source to emit light and a sensor to 
detect that light once it has reflected off an object. Reflective pairs are used as object 
detectors, reflectance monitors, tachometers, and movement detectors (see Fig. 5.30c).

Basic Isolators/Level Shifters
Here, a diode/phototransistor optoisolator is 
used to provide electrical isolation between 
the source circuit and the sensor circuit, as 
well as providing a dc level shift in the output. 
In the leftmost circuit, the output is noninvert-
ed, while the output in the rightmost circuit is 
inverted.
Optocoupler with Amplifier
In optoelectronic ap plications, the 
phototransistor section of an 
 optoisolator may not be able to 
provide enough power- handling 
capacity to switch large currents.

rate a power- switching transistor

detection built in so 
that they turn on only 
at the zero-crossing 
point, minimizing 
current surges. This 
device can be used to 
control a regular triac 
to switch 110 V ac.

5.10  Optical Fiber
While strictly speaking, optical fibers are “optical” rather than “optoelectrical,” they 
are often used with photodiodes and LEDs/laser diodes as a medium through which 
to carry data encoded on beams of light. Figure 5.34 shows how an optical fiber works.
FIGURE 5.34  Optical fiber.
The boundary between the two layers, with an outer layer of higher reflective 
index, ensures that the fiber as a whole acts as a wave guide, with minimal losses 
of light as it bounces down the fiber. Therefore, optical fibers are much better than 
wires for transmitting data over long distances. They can also achieve staggering 
bandwidths, being immune to the induction and capacitive problems associated with 
wire. As such, they are heavily employed in the telecom industry, especially for high-
bandwidth “pipes” between cities and also as submarine cables. It is becoming more 
and more common for fiber to replace copper in the final mile of telecom connections, 
actually terminating in homes to provide very high-speed Internet and cable TV. 
As Fig. 5.34 implies, light will follow various paths through the fiber, and these 
paths will be of different lengths, limiting the effective bandwidth. This effect will 
reduce as the diameter of the internal core reduces. Taken to its limit, a single-mode 
fiber has a core of between 8 µm and 10.5 µm, and a cladding material diameter of 
125 µm. This can be thought of as allowing only the straight-through path of light 
shown in Fig. 5.34. These fibers can achieve bandwidths in the order of 50 Gb/s over 
hundreds of miles.
Data are sent using a light source at the sending end (LED or laser diode) and a 
photodiode or transistor at the other end. Laser diodes are used in telecom systems 
because the coherent light that they produce travels better, but LEDs are also used in 
low-cost systems, such as fiber-based audio links in consumer digital audio systems.

525
Sensors are devices that measure a physical property, such as temperature, humidity, 
stress, and so on. As this is an electronics book, we are concerned with converting 
such measurements into electrical signals. We have also stretched the definition of a 
sensor a little to include things such as global positioning systems (GPSs) that locate 
your position in space.
Many sensors will provide an output signal that is simply a voltage proportional 
to the property being measured. Others are digital devices that provide digital data 
about the property. In both cases, these measurements will often be the input to a 
microcontroller.
6.1 General Principals
Before we look at some of the vast array of sensors that are available, we will cover 
some of the general principles that underpin all sensing.
6.1.1  Precision, Accuracy, and Resolution
When looking at a sensor, it is important to understand the difference between pre-
cision and accuracy, particularly as precision often gives a misleading impression 
of the accuracy of the sensor. A classic example of this is digital weighting scales. 
These may confidently tell you that you weigh 85.7 kilograms when you actually 
weigh 92.1 kilograms. This is only an error of 10 percent or so, and may not matter 
if you always use the same scales, but as an absolute measurement, it might be well 
off the mark.
So precision is a matter of the number of digits reported by the sensor. For an 
analog sensor, the readings are continuous. 
When it comes to digital sensors, there will be a number of bits of resolution. That 
might be 8 bits (1 in 256), 12 bits (1 in 4096), or higher; that is, the reading is no longer 
continuous, but has been quantized.
Sensors
CHAPTER 6

526    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
6.1.2  The Observer Effect
The observer effect states that the act of observing a property changes it. This is the 
case in a car tire, for example. When you measure the pressure with a conventional 
tire gauge, you will let a little of the air out, thus changing the pressure that you are 
measuring. For most sensors, this change will have a negligible effect, but it is some-
thing worth keeping at the back of your mind when deciding whether you are getting 
a true reading.
6.1.3  Calibration
If your invention is a low-cost consumer item that will be mass-produced, then it 
will be much cheaper and easier to produce if there is no calibration to do. In fact,

individual calibration to take differences in individual sensors into account is likely 
to be prohibitively expensive. 
If, on the other hand, your invention is specialized, high-value equipment, then 
individual calibration of sensors is possible.
The principal of calibration is the same whatever property the sensor measures. 
The idea is that you take a number of readings from the sensor of unknown accuracy 
while the sensor is measuring a standard value of known accuracy. So, to calibrate a 
temperature sensor, your accurate standard might be boiling distilled water at 100°C, 
or more likely, the temperature in a highly accurate oven constructed for the purpose 
of calibrating the sensor. This oven will itself need to have been calibrated against an 
even more accurate standard.
When you have discovered the degree to which your sensor deviates from the 
standard, then you can compensate for it in some way. Since the sensor will almost

certainly be supplying information to a microcontroller, a common way to make the 
calibration is to change the values in a lookup table. This table contains accurate 
values against raw values. For example, the raw value straight from a 12-bit ana-
log-to-digital converter is a number between 0 and 1023. These numbers, perhaps 
in increments of 5, might be the left-hand side of the table, with the right-hand side 
of the table containing the equivalent temperature as a decimal in degrees Celsius. 
Interpolation can be used in the gaps between the raw readings by assuming that the 
small segment of the curve is linear (see Fig. 6.3).

Some IC sensors are actually calibrated individually during the manufacturing 
process, with the values for the lookup table being written into the read-only mem-
ory (ROM) of the sensor. This allows accurate sensing at low cost.
6.2  Temperature
Temperature sensors are one of the most common types of sensors. Computers and 
many types of equipment will sense their own temperature to prevent overheating. 
In addition, as well as electronic thermometers, there are thermostats that keep tem-
perature constant by controlling the power to a load, usually just turning it on and 
off. Figure 6.4 shows a variety of temperature sensors.
FIGURE 6.4  Temperature sensors.

Chapter 6: Sensors    529
6.2.1  Thermistors
The term “thermistor” is a combination of the words “thermal” and “resistor.” 
A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance changes markedly with temperature. 
Thermistors come in two flavors: negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and posi-
tive temperature coefficient (PTC). An NTC thermistor’s resistance will decrease with 
increasing temperature, and a PTC thermistor will behave the opposite way, with the 
resistance increasing as temperature increases. The NTC is the more common type.
The relationship between temperature and resistance in a thermocouple is not a 
linear one. Even over relatively short temperature ranges—say 0 to 100°C, a linear 
approximation will introduce considerable errors (see Fig. 6.5).

The Steinhart-Hart equation is a third-order approximation used to determine the 
temperature as a function of the thermistor’s resistance. It works for both NTC and 
PTC devices. It is normally stated as:
 
1
ln( )
ln3
T = A + B
R + C
R
( )
 
(6.1)
T is the temperature in Kelvin; R is the resistance of the thermistor; and A, B, and 
C are constants specific to that thermistor. The manufacturer of a thermistor will give 
all three constant values.
An alternative and more common model for this relationship uses a single param-
eter (Beta) and assumes constants of T0 and R0, where T0 is usually 25°C and R0 is the 
resistance of the thermistor at that temperature.
Using this equation, the temperature can be approximated to:

As well as providing Beta, T0, and R0 , the data sheet will also specify a temperature

To use a thermistor as a thermometer for input to a microcontroller, a voltage 
is required that can be measured by the analog-to-digital converter of the micro-
controller. Figure 6.6 shows a typical arrangement using a potential divider with a 
 fixed-value resistor of the same value as R0.

If we place a NTC thermistor at the top of the potential divider, then as the tem-

6.2.2  Thermocouples
While thermistors are good for measuring relatively small ranges in temperature—
typically –40 to +125°C, for much higher temperatures and temperature ranges, ther-
mocouples are used (see Fig. 6.7).
Any conductor subjected to a thermal gradient will experience something called 
the Seebeck effect; that is, it will generate a small voltage. The magnitude of this 
voltage is dependent on the type of metal, so if two different metals are joined, the 
temperature of that junction can be measured by measuring the voltage across the 
metal leads, at the far end from the junction. It is also necessary to measure the tem-
perature at the other end of the thermocouple leads (often using a thermistor, since 
this will probably be at room temperature). This second temperature is called the 
“cold-junction” temperature.

532    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Lookup tables are often used to calculate the absolute temperature at the junc-
tion, based on the voltage and the cold-junction temperature, as the relationship 
is not completely linear and needs a fifth-order polynomial to model it accurately. 
Manufacturer’s data sheets for thermocouples will normally contain large tables for 
calculating the temperature.
The most commonly used metals for a thermocouple are the alloys chromel  
(90 percent nickel and 10 percent chromium) and alumel (95 percent nickel, 2 percent 
manganese, 2 percent aluminum, and 1 percent silicon). A thermocouple made with 
these materials will typically be able to measure temperatures over the range –200°C 
to +1350°C. The sensitivity is 41 µV/°C for these metals.
6.2.3  Resistive Temperature Detectors
Resistive temperature detectors (RTDs) are perhaps the simplest temperature sen-
sors to understand. Like thermistors, RTDs rely on their resistance changing with 
temperature. However, rather than use a special material that is sensitive to tempera-
ture changes (like a thermistor), they simply use a coil of wire (normally platinum) 
around a glass or ceramic core. The resistance of the core is often contrived to be 
100 Ω at 0°C.
RTDs are much less sensitive than thermistors and can therefore be used over a 
much wider range of temperatures. The resistance of platinum changes in a relatively 
linear manner, and can be assumed to be linear for a range of 100°C or so. For the 
range 0 to 100°C, the resistance of a platinum RTD will vary by 0.003925 Ω/Ω/°C.
So, a 100 Ω (at 0°C) platinum RTD will, at a temperature of 100°C, have a resis-
tance of:
100 Ω + 100°C × 100 Ω × 0.003925 Ω/Ω/°C = 139.25 Ω
The first 100 Ω in the equation above is for the base resistance of the RTD at 0°C.
This can be arranged in a potential divider in the same way as a thermistor.
6.2.4  Analog Output Thermometer ICs
An alternative to using a thermistor and fixed-value resistor in a potential divider 
arrangement is to use a special-purpose temperature measurement IC.
Devices such as the TMP36 come in a three-pin package and are used as shown 
in Fig. 6.8.

Chapter 6: Sensors    533
Unlike a thermistor, the sensor’s output voltage is almost linear at 10 mV/°C for a 
temperature range of –40 to +125°C. The accuracy is only ±2°C over the temperature 
range.
The temperature in °C is simply calculated from Vout using the formula:
 
T = 100Vout – 50
The constant 50 is specified in the data sheet for the TMP36.
These devices are considerably more expensive than thermistors and series resis-
tors, but they are very easy and convenient to use.
6.2.5  Digital Thermometer ICs
An even higher technology approach to temperature measurement is to use a digital 
thermometer IC. These devices have a serial interface for use by microcontrollers. 
A typical digital thermometer IC is the DS18B20. It uses a serial bus standard called 
1-Wire that can allow multiple sensors to share the same data line (see Fig. 6.9).

These devices are more accurate than the linear devices such as the TMP36. The 
digital thermometer IC has a stated accuracy of ±0.5°C and a temperature range of 
–55°C to +125°C.
Since digital thermometer ICs transmit their data digitally, they are very suitable 
for remote sensing, as lead length and electrical interference will have less effect than 

534    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
with an analog device. In fact, they will either work accurately or not at all in an elec-
trically noisy environment.
Digital thermometer ICs can also be configured to work in “parasitic” power 
mode, where they harvest power from the data line, allowing them to be connected 
with just two wires. The GND and positive supply to the DS18B20 are both grounded, 
and the microcontroller must control a MOSFET transistor that pulls the data line up 
to the supply voltage under strict timing conditions.
Chapter 13 contains more information about using the 1-Wire interface with 
microcontrollers.
6.2.6  Infrared Thermometers/Pyrometers
If you have been to the doctor recently and have had your temperature taken, you 
will probably have seen an infrared thermometer that is placed near your ear and 
measures the temperature just on the inside surface of the ear without any actual 
contact. The ear is chosen because it is effectively a hole into the body that is free 
from the influence of external radiation, so that the back surface of the ear acts as a 
“black-body” radiator.
Pyrometers, or more specifically, broadband pyrometers, measure the radiation 
intensity, which has dimensions of energy per second per unit of area and use the 
Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine the temperature:
 
j ∗ = σT4
The radiation intensity (j∗) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, 
where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.6704 × 10–8 Js–1m–2K–4). 
These devices use an infrared sensor such as the MLX90614 coupled with optics 
that focus the infrared radiation from the subject onto the sensor. When used for 
other measurement applications, the infrared thermometer will often have a low-
power laser align with the sensor so that it can be aimed to take spot readings of 
temperature.
Devices such as the MLX90614 are more than just a sensor, containing a low-noise 
amplifier, high-precision analog-to-digital converter, and all the associated electron-
ics to produce a digital output. 
As with other IC sensors, the advantages of including all the electronics in the same 
package as the sensor itself are the reduction of noise and simplicity of interfacing.
Other sensors are available for high temperatures, such as those found in indus-
trial furnaces, and the term “pyrometer,” with its overtones of fire, is usually reserved 
for such high-temperature applications.
6.2.7  Summary
Table 6.1 shows a number of temperature sensors and their characteristics.
The figures for accuracy in Table 6.1 are somewhat arbitrary, as for most sensors, 
high accuracy can be obtained by individual calibration. It is also the accuracy of 
the overall system—including the electronics that use the sensor value—that counts. 
The figures assume the use of off-the-shelf components using data sheet parameters

6.3  Proximity and Touch
This section deals with detecting objects or measuring their distance from the sensor. 
Figure 6.10 shows a selection of such sensors.
FIGURE 6.10  Proximity and touch sensors.
6.3.1  Touch Screens
Touch screens are commonly used in cellular phones and tablet computers. There 
are many different technologies used in touch screens. The most commonly used are 
resistive touch screens.

536    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Resistive touch screens are one of the older and more readily used touch screen 
technologies. They rely on a transparent sheet on top of the display. This sheet is 
flexible and also conductive. Figure 6.11 shows a typical arrangement for a four-wire 
resistive touch screen.

Both the top and bottom surfaces are coated with a conductive layer. Insulating 
dots are evenly sprayed onto the rigid bottom surface to keep the layers apart, except 
when they are pressed together. 
To determine the X position of a touch, A is set to 0 V and B to 5 V, establishing a 
voltage gradient across the top surface. The voltage measured at C, or for that matter 
D, will be proportional to the X position. This is converted into coordinates using an 
analog-to-digital converter.
The conductive layer acts just like a potentiometer with C as the slider. If the 
device measuring the voltage at C has a very high input impedance, then the resis-
tance of the track from the surface to the terminal C can be ignored. Most microcon-
trollers will have an analog-to-digital converter with a high input resistance, typi-
cally several MΩ. So, the voltage at C will be between 0 and 5 V in direct proportion 
to the distance from A of the touch.
When it comes to reading the Y position, some crafty footwork has to take place. 
Now C will be set to 0V, D to 5V, and the voltage measured at A or B.
All this processing will be carried out by either a special-purpose controller chip 
or a microcontroller. 
6.3.2 Ultrasonic Distance
Ultrasonic distance-measuring devices are much loved by the developers of hobby 
robots. They are also found in commercial equivalents to the tape measure.
These devices send out a pulse of ultrasound and time how long it takes for the 
reflection to come back. A simple calculation involving the speed of sound will deter-
mine the distance to the object (see Fig. 6.12).

Chapter 6: Sensors    537
These devices have a measurement range of up to around 5 meters (15 ft), but this 
depends very much on the size and sound reflecting properties of the object. They 
also suffer limits of accuracy due to variations in the speed of sound, which is depen-
dent on many factors, including atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. 
For example, at 0°C, the speed of sound in dry air is 331 meter/second, but this rises 
to 346 meter/second at 25°C—a difference of 4.5 percent.
Sometimes separate transducers are used for sending and receiving the pulses of 
ultrasound, and sometimes a single transducer is used in both roles.
Some devices rely on a microcontroller to initiate the pulse and time the echo. 
Other, more expensive, devices will have their own digital processing that generates 
an output that can be read from a microcontroller as one of the following:
• An analog output voltage proportional to the distance
• Serial data
• A train of varying pulse lengths dependent on the distance
In some cases, all three outputs are provided, such as with the SparkFun device 
SKU: SEN-00639.
Example: Assuming that in dry air at 20°C, the speed of sound is 340 meter/second, 
if the time period between a pulse of ultrasound being sent is 10 milliseconds, how 
far away is the reflecting object?
Answer: distance = velocity × time = 340 × 0.01 = 3.4 m
However, that is the distance for the entire round-trip, so the actual distance to the 
object is half of that, or 1.7 meters.
6.3.3  Optical Distance
Another useful device for measuring distance at close range is the infrared optical 
sensor (see Fig. 6.13). This type of device uses the amount of reflection of a modu-
lated infrared pulse to determine the distance to the object. The Sharp GP2Y0A21YK 
(SparkFun SKU: SEN-00242) is a typical sensor of this type.

FIGURE 6.12  Ultrasonic distance measurement.

538    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Infrared optical sensors are used for closer range measurements than the ultra-
sonic devices and produce an analog output. This is not linear or particularly accu-
rate, so these devices are most useful for simple proximity detection rather than 
actual measurement.
At close range, the measurements become ambiguous, as shown in the distance/
output voltage plot of Fig. 6.14. Therefore, the sensors are usually mounted recessed 
so that no object can get closer than the ambiguous distance, which is about 5 cm for 
the sensor in Fig. 6.14.

When this type of sensor is used with a microcontroller, a lookup table is used to 
convert the measured voltage to a distance reading. 
In some circumstances, you just need to know whether or not something is pres-
ent. This can be detected with a slotted optical sensor, where the infrared source and 
sensor are aligned with a slot in between. When the beam is broken, the object is 
detected.

Chapter 6: Sensors    539
6.3.4  Capacitive Sensors
Capacitive sensors are frequently used as proximity or touch sensors as a replace-
ment for mechanical push switches. They sense conductors and therefore are ideal 
for sensing proximity of a hand or finger.
There are various different approaches to capacitive sensing, but they all follow 
the basic principals shown in Fig. 6.15.
FIGURE 6.15  Capacitive sensing.
Send
Receive
1MΩ
In this case, the sensing is accomplished using two general-purpose input/output 
(GPIO) pins of a microcontroller. The Send pin is configured as an output, and the 
Receive pin as an input. A single fixed resistor between the two pins forms one half 
of an RC arrangement, with the capacitor formed by the object being sensed and a 
sensor plate forming the other half of the capacitor. 
When a hand moves close to the plate, the capacitance increases. This is sensed 
as the control software toggles the state of the Send pin and times how long it takes 
for the Receive pin to catch up with the changed state. In this way, it effectively mea-
sures the capacitance and hence the proximity of the object being sensed. The longer 
it takes for the Receive pin to change to the same state as the Send pin, the closer the 
object is to the plate.
This type of sensing has the advantages that it requires very little special hard-
ware and can sense through glass, plastic, and other insulators. More advanced 
versions of this approach can sense in two dimensions to make a capacitative touch 
screen. 
6.3.5  Summary
Table 6.2 compares the relative merits of the different types of distance sensors.
Another type of sensor that is used in industrial settings is the inductive sensor. 
This is in essence a mini-metal detector. 
Proximity of a magnet can also be detected using magnetic sensors such as Hall 
effect sensors (discussed in Sec. 6.6.3) and even the humble read switch, which con-
sists of a pair of contacts in a glass envelope that close when near a magnet.

6.4 Movement, Force, and Pressure
Many different types of sensors can tell us about how things are moving. This has 
become a common occurrence in smartphones, where an accelerometer is used to 
detect the orientation of the device for automatic switching of the screen between 
landscape and portrait format, as well as for game playing. Figure 6.16 shows a vari-
ety of different movement-detecting devices.
FIGURE 6.16  Movement sensors.
6.4.1  Passive Infrared
Passive infrared (PIR) detectors are most commonly used in intruder alarms. They 
detect changes in infrared heat. Because they require a plastic lens, they are usually 
sold as a detector module on a printed circuit board. 

Chapter 6: Sensors    541
More advanced movement detectors will have multiple detectors that respond 
to a rapid change in the level of infrared heat. When this is detected, the module 
may activate a relay, or in some modules, switch a transistor with an open collector 
arrangement. 
Figure 6.17 shows how to use an open collector device such as the PIR sensor from 
SparkFun (SKU: SEN-08630) to give a digital output.

6.4.2  Acceleration
The ready use of accelerometers in cellular phones has led to them becoming a low-
cost and readily available component. The most common of these use a technology 
called microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The basic principal for these devices 
is to measure the position of a mass attached to a spring that stretches under accelera-
tion (see Fig. 6.18). The neat trick is that all of this is fabricated onto an IC.
Spring (k)

FIGURE 6.18  Mass and spring accelerometer.
This arrangement is basically the same as a spring balance of the sort favored by 
fishermen and travelers worried about exceeding their baggage allowance. In fact, 
turning it through 90 degrees, you would be measuring the gravitational constant 
whose units are those of an acceleration. This is how an accelerometer can determine 
its orientation on the vertical axis.
The force acting on the mass due to the acceleration is:
 
F = k (x – x0) = m a

Since the manufacturer will know k and m, we just need to be able to measure 
the displacement of the mass m. Measuring this movement often uses the capacitive 
effect of the mass, in relation to one or two plates. A common arrangement is for 
the mass to move between two plates making a capacitive divider (see Fig. 6.19 and 
Sec. 2.23.14 in Chap. 2).

FIGURE   6.19  Measuring 
the offset of the mass.
If the mass, shown as a rectangle in between two plates in Fig. 6.19, is half-
way between the two plates A and C, then the capacitance between A and B and 
between B and C will be equal. An acceleration to the left of the diagram will 
move the weight to the right, changing the ratio of the capacitance.
Most accelerometers come in a little IC package that not only includes three 
accelerometers—one for each dimension—but also all the necessary electronics, 
analog-to-digital converters, and digital electronics to provide serial communi-
cation of the data back to a microcontroller using an I2C serial interface. 
A much used low-cost accelerometer is the MMA8452Q (SparkFun SKU: 
COM-10953).
6.4.3  Rotation
Measuring rotation can be as simple as using a potentiometer as a voltage 
divider, where the voltage at the slider is proportional to the angle of rotation 
(see Fig. 6.20). However, the potentiometer will not measure a full 360 degrees, 
and it has stops at both ends of the track that prevent it from turning all the way 
around. 
A more flexible alternative to the potentiometer is the quadrature encoder. 
This type of device rotates without any stops, so you can just keep turning it. 
These are often used as an alternative to potentiometers in electrical appliances. 
They actually just measure steps to the left or steps to the right, rather than the 
absolute position.
A quadrature encoder is really just a pair of concentric tracks that each has 
a contact. They act as a pair of switches producing pulses as the shaft is rotated 
(see Fig. 6.21).

The transitions of A and B are used to determine the direction in which the shaft is

1 to 4 and a counterclockwise from 4 down to 1.
Clockwise (AB): LH HL HH HL
Counterclockwise (AB): HL HH LH LL

Chapter 6: Sensors    543
As you can tell, this is a digital device that will be connected directly to a 
microcontroller.
Quadrature encoders come in various resolutions. Low-cost ones may have only 
12 pulses per revolution. Better-quality devices can have up to 200 pulses per revolu-
tion and be designed for high-speed operation of up to 30,000 rpm. Such devices will 
use optical sensors rather than contacts.
A variation on the quadrature encoders that measure relative rotation are abso-
lute rotary encoders. This type of device is essentially a rotary switch with a number 
of tracks that then indicate the angle by providing a binary output. 
Rather than count in “normal” binary, the binary numbers for each position are 
arranged so that only one bit changes between one position of the switch and the 
next. This type of encoding is called a Gray code. For example, the 3-bit Gray code 
looks like this: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100.

6.4.4  Flow
The simplest sensors for measuring flow are variations on 
some kind of paddle wheel or turbine that is placed in the 
flow and spins at a speed proportional to the flow. The prob-
lem of measuring the rate of rotation remains. An anemom-
eter that measures the wind speed is a typical example of this 
(see Fig. 6.22).
The wind will cause the arrangement of cups to spin at 
a rate of rotation proportional to the wind strength. Some 
fixed point on the cup assembly passes close to a proxim-
ity sensor that produces a pulse for each full rotation. In this 
way, you get a stream of pulses at a frequency proportional 
to the wind speed. Measuring the speed is then just a matter 
of using a microcontroller to count the number of pulses in a 
given period of time.

6.4.5  Force
Force can be sensed using a force-sensitive resistor. These devices operate in a similar 
manner to a resistive touch screen. They are two layers, with conducting tracks and 
a microdot insulating layer, but the harder you press, the more of the top conductor 
comes into contact with the bottom conductor and the lower the resistance. These 
devices are not usually very accurate.
Strain gauges operate on the principal of deforming the geometry of a resistor as 
it is put under tension or compression (see Fig. 6.23).

Chapter 6: Sensors    545
For a more accurate sensing of force, a load cell is used. This arranges two or more 
strain gauges bonded onto a deformable metal block. They will often also include 
temperature compensation.
6.4.6  Tilt
Although an accelerometer can be used to measure the angle of tilt, or just detect tilt 
from the horizontal, if all that is required is to know that the sensor has tilted from 
the horizontal, then a simpler sensor can be used. The simplest of these use a small 
metal ball in a case, which sits on contacts when horizontal but rolls off when the 
device is tipped.
6.4.7  Vibration and Mechanical Shock
Piezoelectric materials are good for detecting shock and vibration. The vibration sen-
sor in Fig. 6.16 uses a small weight (just a rivet) on the end of a flexible strip of piezo-
electric material. When the weight wobbles due to vibration, a voltage is generated 
across the terminals. The output of these voltages will drift, so for practical use, place 
a 10 MΩ resistor in parallel with them. This same approach will work for detecting 
mechanical shock.
6.4.8  Pressure
Unless you plan to work in process control or build a weather station, sensing pres-
sure is unlikely to be something that you will need to do. Except for when you have 
very particular sensing requirements, the solution is nearly always to buy a digital 
sensor on a chip, such as the two listed in Table 6.5.

Other types of pressure sensors are on a larger scale, usually based on traditional

as a potentiometer, a strain gauge, or capacitative position sensing like that used in 
an IC accelerometer.

6.5  Chemical
There are many sensors available for detecting chemicals of various kinds—far too 
many to list here. The selection shown in Fig. 6.24 illustrates a range of the sensors 
available, and we’ll look at their principals of operation in the following sections.
FIGURE 6.24  Chemical sensors.
6.5.1  Smoke
Domestic smoke detectors are (or should be) a feature of every home. The most 
 common devices are actually quite sophisticated in their sensing (see Fig. 6.25).
Americium
Ionizing radiation

Stream of ions
Detector

FIGURE 6.25  An ionizing smoke detector.
They use a radioisotope (Americium) that generates a stream of ionized particles 
in a chamber that is open to the air. This allows a small current to flow between 
the metal casing of the radiation source and a detecting plate at the far side of the 
chamber.
If smoke particles enter the chamber—even microscopic particles—they attach 
themselves to the ions, neutralizing them and reducing the current flowing. This is 
detected by the control electronics.
The other common type of smoke detector (optical) uses a focused infrared LED 
with a photodiode, off-axis from the infrared LED. When smoke enters the sensor, the 
smoke particles scatter light, which can be detected by the photodiode. 
6.5.2  Gas
Gas detectors, such as the MQ-4 from Hanwei Electronics (SparkFun SKU: SEN-
09404) shown in Fig. 6.24, contain a small heating element and a catalytic detector 
to detect concentrations of methane as low as 200 parts per million. Other types of 
sensors use different catalysts to make them sensitive to other gases.

Chapter 6: Sensors    547
Using such a device involves supplying a voltage (often 5 V) to the heating ele-
ment (which typically draws a few tens of milliamps) and putting the sensor pins 
in a voltage divider arrangement with a fixed resistor to create a measurable output 
voltage.
6.5.3  Humidity
Although highly accurate techniques are available for measuring humidity, in many 
applications, an accuracy of 1 or 2 percent is acceptable and can be achieved with a 
low-cost capacitative sensor. These sensors are often combined with a temperature 
sensor, control electronics, and a serial interface for use by a microcontroller. 
Capacitative sensing relies on humidity changing the dielectric constant of a poly-
mer separating the two plates. These devices achieve better accuracy by laser calibra-
tion; that is, they are calibrated during manufacture by using a laser to write into 
digital memory on the device, setting a calibration parameter.
Unless extreme accuracy is required in a very specialized application, there is 
little reason to use anything other than an IC humidity sensor.
6.6  Light, Radiation, Magnetism, and Sound
Figure 6.26 shows a selection of various types of sensors associated with detecting 
radiation or magnetism.
FIGURE 6.26  Light, radiation, and magnetic sensors.
6.6.1  Light
Light detection is used in many different ways, from optical transmission of data 
to proximity detection. There are many types of sensors for this purpose, including 
some we have already discussed, such as the photoresistor. For information about the 
use of photoresistors, photodiodes, and phototransistors, see Chap. 5.
6.6.2 Ionizing Radiation
To sense ionizing radiation, a Geiger–Müller tube is usually used. These tubes con-
tain a low-pressure inert gas such as neon. A high voltage (400 to 500 V) is applied 
between the outer conducting cathode and a wire anode running down the middle 
of the tube (see Fig. 6.27).

548    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
When ionizing radiation passes through the tube, the gas is ionized and conducts, 
producing a pulse at Vout. These pulses are counted using a Geiger counter, tradition-
ally producing a click sound with each event.
Different tubes are designed to be more sensitive to different types of radiation. To 
detect alpha particles, tubes with a very thin mica end will allow the easily stopped 
alpha particles to pass through and be detected.
6.6.3  Magnetic Fields
In discussing sensing rotational speed in a flow meter, we suggested detecting each 
rotation by sensing when a magnet passed a sensor. This sensor could just be a coil of 
wire, in which a current would be induced. However, the slower the magnet moves 
past the coil, the smaller the signal available. An alternative to this is to measure the 
static magnetic field and just detect the presence or absence of the magnet. A common 
device for doing this is called a Hall effect sensor.
The Hall effect is an electrical effect that occurs when a current passes through a 
conductor in the presence of a magnetic field. Referring to Fig. 6.28, when current is 
flowing along a bar of thickness d, in the presence of a magnetic field B, a voltage VH 
will appear between the top and bottom surfaces of the conductor.

Chapter 6: Sensors    549
where n is the charge carrier density, e is the charge of an electron, d is the length of 
the conductor, I is the current flowing through it, and B is the magnetic field density.
Practical Hall effect sensors usually combine the sensor itself with high-gain 
amplification in a single IC. Others take this a step further and actually incorporate a 
serial interface to send the data to a microcontroller.
There are two types of Hall effect sensors. The most common type also acts as 
a switch and just provides an on-off indication of the presence of a nearby magnet. 
A more flexible type of Hall effect sensor (a linear sensor) provides a linear output 
 voltage proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
6.6.4 Sound
Sensing sound relies on using a microphone and amplifier (see Chap. 15). If you are 
sensing the sound level, then you will also need to use a low-pass filter and rectifica-
tion to determine an indication of the level of sound (see Fig. 6.29).

6.7 GPS
A side effect of consumer devices, such as smartphones and dedicated satellite navi-
gation systems, is that GPS modules are readily available at relatively low cost.
GPS relies on a constellation of satellites (see Fig. 6.30). Each satellite contains a 
highly accurate clock that is synchronized with all the other satellites in the constel-
lation. The satellites then broadcast this time signal.
A GPS receiver on the ground will attempt to receive time signals from as many sat-
ellites as possible and use the differences in those times, due to the time for the signals 
to travel, to calculate the position of the receiver.

550    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
GPS modules are generally a single IC, but require a special antenna that is usu-
ally the largest part of the module. Figure 6.31 shows the Venus 638 FLPx GPS mod-
ule from SparkFun with its antenna attached. This module and modules like it have 
a serial interface that transmits a stream of updates giving the position of the receiver 
and various other information, such as the time and number of satellites currently 
being received.

7.1  Safety
7.1.1  Lecture on Safety
Probably the most hazardous thing in electronics is your household line voltage, 
around 120 V at 60 Hz in the United States (240 V at 50 Hz in many other countries). 
What often happens is an ungrounded metal object comes in contact with a hot wire, 
and then you touch the “hot object,” discovering in the process that your body acts as 
a conducting medium for current to flow to ground. (The ground and ground wires 
are, in effect, at the same potential as the neutral wire—they are tied together at the 
utility box.) The frequency and amplitude of the line voltage tend to be at the perfect 
levels for inducing involuntary muscle contractions that prevent you from letting go 
of a hot or energized object. This freezing effect is extremely dangerous. The longer 
you’re stuck, the more damage current will inflict upon your internal tissues (tissue 
heating), and the more likely you’ll suffer from cardiac and/or respiratory arrest.
Voltage and frequency levels below household line levels can cause cardiac/
respiratory arrest, too (especially if your internal resistance is low, such as with a 
wet body), but are less likely to cause the dreaded freezing effect. Frequencies above 
household line levels actually are less likely to cause severe muscle contractions, so 
the chances of fatality decrease somewhat. At very high voltages, there is an arc-
ing effect that can occur, which can give you a nasty jolt even if you’re not touch-
ing an object directly. The electric potential between you and the energized object 
is so great that the air becomes a conducting medium. Ironically, the initial jolt you 
receive from an arc will often be large enough to throw you clear of danger. However, 
besides being extremely painful, such jolts may induce cardiac/respiratory arrest, 
and depending on where you’re standing, the fall may be what kills you.
In more specific terms, what kills you or what causes greatest tissue damage is 
the amperage. When you come in contact with a live wire or energized object, the 
amount of current that passes through your body to ground depends on the voltage 
level (assuming an ideal voltage source) and your internal resistance. A heavily cal-
lused dry palm may present a resistance of 1 MΩ, while a thin, wet palm may present 
Hands-on Electronics
CHAPTER 7

552    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
only 100 Ω. Resistance tends to be lower in children, and different body tissues exhibit 
a range of resistances. Nerves, arteries, and muscles are low in resistance. Bone, fat, 
and tendon are relatively high in resistance. Across the chest of an average adult, the 
resistance is about 70 to 100 Ω. The low resistance across the chest and the higher 
resistance through the air-filled lungs provide a path of least resistance through the 
heart and spinal cord regions—the critical regions for life support. A 100- to 1000-mA 
current is sufficient to induce cardiac/respiratory arrest. Thermal burns due to I2R 
losses through body parts can also be significant, resulting in loss of life or limb, even 
long after the initial exposure. Since the thermal heating effects increase with the 
square of the current, higher current levels truly cause nastier burns, whether they 
are internal or external.
As a rough guideline, a 10-mA, 50- to 60-Hz cycle line current, from hand to foot, 
will merely give you a tingly sensation. However, above 10 mA, at the same fre-
quency, it’s possible you’ll freeze to the circuit you’re touching. Outlets using ground 
fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) will cut power if they sense sudden ground current 
flow in this current range—the tripping point around 5 to 10 mA. Currents from 20 to 
100 mA may be fatal, but it’s the 100-mA to 1-A range that’s the deadliest. Above 
1 A, the heart is thrown into a single contraction, and internal heating becomes sig-
nificant. You may be thrown clear of the power source, but then cardiac and/or respi-
ratory arrest may ensue.
The most lethal form of electrocution occurs via hand-to-hand current flow; cur-
rent passes right across the heart, lungs, and spinal cord. Hand-to-foot electrocution 
is less fatal, carrying a mortality rate of around 20 percent. For this reason, when 
working on line voltages, make sure to keep one hand in your pocket. Another safety 
practice is to use the back of your hand when touching unknown entities. This pre-
vents the “grip of death.”
Consumer electronics equipment—such as TVs, computer monitors, microwave 
ovens, and electronic flash units—use voltage at power levels that are potentially 
lethal. Normally, the hazardous circuitry is safely enclosed to prevent accidental 
contact. However, during servicing, the cabinet or enclosure will likely be open and 
safety interlocks may be defeated. Depending on the type of circuitry and your gen-
eral state of health, there is a wide variation of voltage, current, and total energy that 
can kill.
Microwave ovens are probably the most dangerous household appliance to mess 
around with. They operate at several thousand volts (5000 V or more), at higher cur-
rent levels (more than an amp may be available momentarily). This is instantly a 
lethal combination.
Old-fashioned cathode-ray tube TVs and monitors may have 35 kV on the cathode-
ray tube, with current lower than a couple of milliamps. However, the cathode-
ray tube capacitance can hold a painful charge for quite some time. In addition, portions 
of the circuitry within TVs and monitors, as well as all other devices that plug 
into the wall socket (such as switching power supplies), are line connected. These 
circuits’ internal grounds may be several hundred volts higher than the utility earth 
ground. Without isolation between the 120 V and the circuit, a real potential shock 
hazard exists if you come in contact with the circuit’s floating ground (see the discus-
sion of isolation transformers in Sec. 7.5.12). Switch-mode power supplies, electronic 
flash units, and strobe lights have large energy storage capacitors that can deliver a 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    553
lethal discharge, long after the power has been removed. This even applies to dispos-
able cameras with a flash. Even portions of apparently harmless devices like VCRs 
and CD players, or vacuum cleaners and toasters, can be hazardous (though the live 
parts may be insulated or protected, you shouldn’t count on it).
The following list of safety tips will help you prolong your life.
ELECTRONICS SAFETY TIPS
1.  Do not attempt repairs on line-powered circuits with the power on. Always 
remove the main power first.
2.  Use one hand when taking measurements, and keep your other hand at 
your side or in your pocket. If you do get shocked, it’s less likely that cur-
rent will pass through your heart.
3.  If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with the power off, 
discharge (across) a large power supply filter or an energy-storage capaci-
tor with a 2-W or greater resistor of 100 to 500 Ω/V; for example, for a 
200-V capacitor, use a 20- to 100-KΩ resistor. (A screwdriver’s metal tip 
is often used to discharge a capacitor, but the sudden discharge may not 
be well tolerated by the capacitor.) Monitor while discharging and verify 
that there is no residual charge with a suitable voltmeter. Large capacitors 
can store a lethal amount of charge and may retain the charge for a num-
ber of days. Even capacitors rated at voltages as low as 5 or 10 V can be 
dangerous.
4.  Perform as many tests as possible with the power off and the equipment 
unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section 
can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.
5.  Avoid standing in a position that could be dangerous if you were to lose 
muscle control due to shock. Often the fall alone is more dangerous than 
the initial shock.
6.  When working on high-power circuits, bring someone else along who can 
assist you if something goes wrong. If you see that someone cannot let go of 
a “hot” object, do not grab onto that person. Instead, use a stick or insulated 
object to push the person away from the source. It’s not a bad idea to learn 
CPR, too.
7.  All high-voltage test instruments (such as power supplies, signal gener-
ators, and oscilloscopes) that are operated on a 120 or 240 V ac supply 
should use three-wire line cable.
8.  Use only shielded (insulated) lead probes when testing circuits. Never 
allow your fingers to slip down to the metal probe tip when testing a “hot” 
circuit. Also, make sure to remove power from a circuit when making a 
connection with wires and cables.
9.  Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered or 
unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped or 
difficult-to-access locations. If you must probe live, put electrical tape over 
all but the last 1⁄16 of the test probe to avoid the possibility of an accidental 
(Continued)

554    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
short that could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference 
end of the meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you 
need to probe with only one hand.
10.  If circuit boards need to be removed from their mounting, put insulating 
material between the boards and anything they may short to. Hold them 
in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with insulation sticks 
made of plastic or wood.
11.  Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may acciden-
tally contact.
12.  When working on ac-line circuits, wearing rubber-bottomed shoes or sneak-
ers, or standing on a sheet of rubber or wood, can reduce possible shocks.
13.  The use of a GFCI-protected outlet is a good idea, but it will not protect 
you from shock from many points in a line-connected device, such as a TV, 
monitor, or the high-voltage side of a microwave oven. (Note that a GFCI 
may be a nuisance by tripping at power-on or at other random times due to 
leakage paths, like your scope probe ground, or due to the highly capacitive 
or inductive input characteristics of line-powered equipment.)
14.  A fuse or circuit breaker is too slow and insensitive to provide any protec-
tion for you or, in many cases, your equipment. However, these devices may 
save your scope probe ground wire should you accidentally connect it to a 
live chassis.
15.  Know your equipment. TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chas-
sis as the ground return, yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect 
to the earth ground of the ac line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as the 
ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the chas-
sis is a suitable ground for your test equipment! Use an isolation transformer 
if there is any chance of contacting line-connected circuits. A Variac is not 
isolated, so you need a combination of a Variac and an isolation transformer 
for safety.
16.  Make sure all components that are connected to ac power lines meet 
required power ratings.
17.  When building power supplies and other instruments, make sure that 
all wires and components are enclosed in a metal box or insulated plas-
tic enclosure. If you use a metal box, it is important that you ground 
the conductive shell (attach a wire from the inner surface of the box to 
the ground wire of the power cable, preferably with a screw along with  
solder). Grounding a metal box eliminates shock incurred as a result of a 
hot wire coming loose and falling onto the box, thereby making the whole 
box hot.
18.  When making holes in metal boxes through which to insert an ac line cable, 
place a rubber grommet around the inner edge of the hole to eliminate the 
chance of fraying the cable.
19. Wear eye protection: large plastic-lens eyeglasses or safety goggles.
20.  Don’t wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact 
circuitry and conduct current.

7.1.2  Damaging Components with Electrostatic Discharge
Scuffling across a carpet while wearing sneakers on a dry day can result in a transfer 
of electrons from the carpet to your body. In such a case, it is entirely possible that 
you will assume a potential of 1000 V relative to ground. Handling a polyethylene 
bag can result in static voltages of 300 V or more, whereas combing your hair can 
result in voltages as high as 2500 V. The drier the conditions (lower the humidity), 
the greater the chance is for these large voltages to form. Now, the amount of electro-
static discharge (ESD) that can result from an electrostatically charged body coming 
in contact with a grounded object is not of much concern in terms of human stan-
dards. However, the situation is entirely different when subjecting certain types of 
semiconductor devices to similar discharges.
Devices that are particularly vulnerable to damage include field-effect transistors, 
such as MOSFETs and JFETs. For example, a MOSFET, with its delicate gate-channel 
oxide insulator, can be destroyed easily if an electrostatically charged individual 
touches its gate. The gate-channel breakdown voltage will be exceeded, and a hole 
will be blown through the insulator, which will destroy the transistor. Here is a run-
down of the vulnerable devices out there:
■ Extremely vulnerable: MOS transistors, MOS ICs, JFETs, laser diodes, microwave 
transistors, and metal film resistors
■ Moderately vulnerable: CMOS ICs, LS TTL ICs, Schottky TTL ICs, Schottky diodes, 
and linear ICs
■ Somewhat vulnerable: TTL ICs, small signal diodes and transistors, and piezoelec-
tric crystals
■ Not vulnerable: Capacitors, carbon-composite resistors, inductors, and many other 
analog devices
7.1.3  Component Handling Precautions
Devices that are highly vulnerable to damage are often marked with “Caution, com-
ponents subject to damage by static electricity.” If you see a label like this, use the 
following precautions:
■ Store components in their original packages, in electrically conductive containers 
(such as a metal sheet or aluminum foil), or in conductive foam packages.
■ Do not touch leads of ESD-sensitive components.
■ Discharge the static electricity on your body before touching components by touch-
ing a grounded metal surface such as a water pipe or large appliance.
■ Never allow your clothing to make contact with components.
■ Ground tabletops and soldering irons (or use a battery-powered soldering iron). 
You also should ground yourself with a conductive wrist guard that’s connected 
with a wire to ground.
Never install or remove an ESD-sensitive component into or from a circuit when 
power is applied. Once the component is installed, the chances for damage are greatly 
reduced.
While these risks are real, and you will no doubt occasionally lose a component 
to static, it is also important to keep a sense of perspective and take the necessary 

556    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
precautions around devices that you know are expensive or vulnerable. You certainly 
do not need to wear a grounded wrist strap all the time.
7.2  Constructing Circuits
This section briefly discusses the steps involved in building a working circuit: draw-
ing a circuit schematic, building a prototype, making a permanent circuit, finding a 
suitable enclosure for the circuit, and applying a sequence of troubleshooting steps to 
fix improperly functioning circuits.
7.2.1  Drawing a Circuit Schematic
The circuit schematic, or circuit diagram, is a blueprint of a circuit. For a schematic to 
be effective, it must include all the information necessary so that you or anyone else 
reading it can figure out what parts to buy, how to assemble the parts, and possibly 
what kind of output behavior to expect. The following are guidelines for making an 
easy-to-read, unambiguous schematic:
■ The standard convention used when drawing a schematic is to place inputs on the 
left, outputs on the right, positive supply terminals on the top, and negative sup-
ply or ground terminals on the bottom of the drawing.
■ Keep functional groups—such as amplifiers, input stages, filters, and so on—
separated within the schematic. This will make it easier to isolate problems during 
the testing phase.
■ Give all circuit components symbol designations (such as R1, C3, Q1, and IC4), and 
provide the exact size or type of component information (such as 100 k, 0.1 µF, 
2N2222, or 741). It is also important to include the power rating for certain devices, 
such as resistors, capacitors, relays, speakers, and so on.
■ Use abbreviations for large-valued components (for example, 100 kΩ instead 
of 100,000 Ω, or 100 pF instead of 100 × 10−12 F). Common unit prefixes include  
p = 10−12, n = 10−9, µ = 10−6, k = 103, and M = 106.
■ When labeling ICs, place lead designations (such as pin numbers) on the outside of 
the device symbol, and place the name of the device on the inside.
■ In certain circuits where the exact shape of a waveform is of importance (such as 
logic circuits and inverting circuits), it is helpful to place a picture of the expected 
waveforms at locations of interest on your circuit diagram. This will help isolate 
problems later during the testing phase.
■ Power-supply connections to op amps and digital ICs are usually assumed and 
typically left out of the schematic. However, if you anticipate confusion later on, 
include these supply voltages in your drawing.
■ To indicate joined wires, place a dot at the junction point. Unjoined wires simply 
cross (do not include a dot in such cases).
■ Include a title area near the bottom of the page that contains the circuit name, 
the designer’s name, and the date. It is also useful to leave room for a list of  
revisions.
Figure 7.1 shows a sample schematic.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    557
Once you have completed the circuit schematic, see if anything looks fishy. Are 
there missing connections or missing component values? Are component polarities 
indicated? Have you considered the power ratings of the components? Have you 
made connections as simple as possible? It is better to check things now; finding an 
error when you are soldering things together is much more annoying than erasing a 
few lines on a drawing.
You can draw the schematic with a pencil on paper, and often this is good enough 
while you are developing the project, especially if it is a simple one. However, at 
some stage, you will probably want to draw the circuit using an electronic computer-
aided design (CAD) tool. The advantages of using a CAD tool are as follows:
■ When you modify your schematic, the diagram stays clear in a way that a sche-
matic with a lot of erasing doesn’t.
■ A good CAD system will apply electrical design rules to your schematic—at the 
very least, warning you about unconnected leads.
■ A CAD system provides two views of a project: the schematic and the printed 
circuit board (PCB) layout. You can usually automatically route and lay out a PCB 
from the schematic.
■ To be able to lay out a PCB, the CAD package needs to know about the geometry 
of the component. A catalog of components is supplied that contains information 
about the component package and pin assignments. Manufacturers will often pro-
vide component libraries for CAD packages.
There are many electronic CAD packages, including some that are very 
expensive. One of the most popular is EAGLE CAD. A free version of this product is 
available that restricts use to relatively small PCBs and a maximum of two layers of 
copper. Options for CAD packages are listed in Sec. 7.5.22. Most require a reason-
able investment in time to learn to use properly.
If a full-blown CAD system is more than you need (or are prepared to learn), an 
alternative is to use a general-purpose drawing tool such as Microsoft Visio or 
OmniGraffle, both of which have libraries of electronics component symbols available.

558    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
7.2.2  A Note on Circuit Simulator Programs
Now, before you build a circuit, or even before you finish the schematic, you might 
consider using a circuit simulator program to test your idea to see if it works. Circuit 
simulator programs allow you to construct a computer model of your circuit and 
then test it (measure voltages, currents, wave patterns, logic states, and so on) with-
out ever needing to touch a real component. A typical simulator program contains a 
library of analog and digital devices, both discrete and integrated in form. If you wish 
to model an oscillator circuit—one that is built from a few bipolar transistors, some 
resistors, a capacitor, and a dc power supply—all you do is select the parts from the 
library, set the values of these parts, and then arrange the parts to form an oscillator 
circuit. 
To test the circuit, simply choose one of the simulator’s test instruments, and then 
attach the test instrument’s probes to the desired test points within the circuit. For 
example, if you are interested in what the output waveform of the oscillator looks 
like, choose the simulator’s oscilloscope, and then attach the test leads and measure 
the output. The computer screen will then display a voltage versus time graph of the 
output. Some other instruments found in simulator programs include multimeters, 
logic analyzers, function generators, and bode plotters.
Why make a computer simulation of a circuit before building a real one? For sev-
eral reasons:
■ When you make a computer simulation, you do not need to worry about working 
with faulty components. 
■ There is no need to worry about destroying components with excessive current; 
the computer program does not “care about the numbers.” 
■ A simulator program does all the mathematical work for you. The simulator allows 
you to fiddle around with component values until the circuit is working as desired. 
■ Using a simulator program can make learning electronics an intuitive process and 
saves time spent at the workbench.
Some popular simulator programs include Electronics Workbench, CircuitMaker, 
and MicroSim/Pspice. Electronics Workbench and CircuitMaker are relatively easy 
to use, while Pspice is a bit more technical.
7.2.3  Making a Prototype of Your Circuit
Once you are satisfied with the schematic, the next step is to make a prototype of 
your circuit. The most common tool used during the prototype phase is a solderless 
modular breadboard. A breadboard acts as a temporary assembly board on which 
electrical parts such as resistors, transistors, and ICs are placed and joined together 
by wires or built-in conductive pathways hidden underneath the surface of the 
breadboard (see Fig. 7.2).
Breadboards come with an array of small square sockets spaced about 0.100 in 
from center to center. When a wire or component lead is inserted into one of these 
sockets, a spring-like metal sleeve built into the socket acts to hold the wire or lead in 
place. Breadboard sockets are designed to accept 22-gauge wire but can expand to fit 
wire diameters between 0.015 and 0.032 in (0.38 and 0.81 mm). The upper and lower 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    559
rows of sockets of a breadboard typically are reserved for power-supply connections, 
while the sockets between the central gap region are reserved for DIP ICs.
See Sec. 7.5.17 for more on prototyping boards.
7.2.4  The Final Circuit
Once you are finished making a successful prototype, the next step is to construct a 
more permanent circuit. At this point, you must choose the type of mounting board 
on which to place your circuit. Your choices include a perforated board, a wire-wrap 
board, a pre-etched board, or a custom-etched PCB. Let’s take a closer look at each of 
these boards.
Perforated Board
A perforated board is an insulated board with an array of holes drilled into it (see 
Fig. 7.3). To join a lead from one electrical component to another, each of the compo-
nents’ leads is placed through neighboring holes. The lead ends sticking out the back 
side of the board are then twisted together (and possibly soldered).

Constructing a circuit on a perforated board is easy. Few supplies are needed, and 
making connections does not require much skill. However, what you get in the end is 
a fairly bulky circuit that is liable to fall apart over time and may pick up noise inad-
vertently (jumper wires will act like little antennas). In general, perforated boards are 
used for constructing simple, noncritical types of circuits.

560    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Wire-Wrap
Using a wire-wrap board is another way to assemble moderately complex circuits con-
taining ICs. Every wire-wrap board is made up of an array of sockets, each of which 
has a corresponding pin-like extension sticking out of the opposite side of the board 
(see Fig. 7.4).

FIGURE 7.4  
FIGURE 7.5  
IC leads are inserted directly into the wire-wrap’s sockets, while discrete com-
ponents, such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors, must be mounted on special 
platforms like blocks or single post-like pins (see Fig. 7.4b). Each of these platforms 
contains a number of nail-like heads on which discrete component leads are attached, 
either by coiling the leads around the nail head or by fastening the leads to the nail 
head with solder. The nail-like tips of the platforms are then inserted into the board’s 
sockets. 
To connect components together, the pins on the back side of the wire-wrap 
board are joined together with wires (typically 30-, 28-, or 26-gauge single-conductor 
wires). In order to fasten the joining wires to the pins, a special wire-wrap tool is used 
(see Fig. 7.5). This tool wraps the joining wire around the pin by means of a bit section 
that rotates around a hollow core. The wire is inserted into the bit, the hollow core 
is placed over the pin, and then the wire-wrap tool is twisted several times (usually 
around seven times) and removed.

7 turns

In practice, to save time and avoid making mistakes, it is desirable to do all the 
wrapping in a single pass. To follow this approach, some bookkeeping is required. 
Notice in Fig. 7.4a that each socket/pin is given a row/column designation. 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    561
For example, a pin located three rows down and two rows in from the left is given a 
C2 designation, and a pin that is located five rows down and seven rows in is given 
an E7 designation. 
To figure out how to arrange electrical components on the board, making a simple 
sketch of the wire-wrap board is helpful. On the sketch, draw in all the components, 
fixing each component lead to a specific row/column coordinate. Once the sketch 
is complete, simply grab your wire-wrap tool and start making wire connections 
between the pins, using the sketch as a guide.
Wire-wrap boards are suitable platforms for circuits that contain a number of ICs, 
such as logic circuits. However, because the sockets of these boards are not designed 
for linear component leads (you must use platforms in such cases), it may be easier to 
use a pre-etched, or custom-etched PCB for building analog circuits.
Pre-etched Perforated Boards
A pre-etched perforated board is made of an insulating material that is coated with a 
pre-etched copper pattern and has a number of holes drilled into it. To join electrical 
components, simply place the leads of the components in the appropriate holes that 
are joined by a copper-etched strip, and then apply solder. 
Pre-etched boards come with a variety of different etched patterns. Figure 7.6 
shows samples of the kinds of patterns available.
FIGURE 7.6

Custom-Etched Boards (PCBs)
If you are looking to build a circuit with a professional appearance, designing a 
custom-etched circuit board, or PCB, is the ticket, and the next section describes how to 
do this.
Designing custom-etched circuit boards takes a bit longer, but the time spent is 
often well worth the effort. There are times when making a custom-etched board is 
essential to ensure proper circuit operation, especially when dealing with circuits 
that contain components whose properties are greatly influenced by the length of 
the leads. For example, very high-speed logic circuits require the unique microstrip 
line geometries and precise placement of components to achieve fast rise times 
and at the same time avoid crosstalk among circuit elements. Sensitive low-level 

562    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
amplifier circuits also benefit from well-placed microstrip interconnections; the short 
and direct interconnections help eliminate noise pickup.
7.2.5  Making a PCB
To create the PCB layout, you can either draw the design by hand or use a CAD tool. 
Once you have the design, you have a number of choices for actually creating the board:
■ Using an etch-resistant pen
■ Printing the layout onto overhead projector (OHP) transparency film and using 
photosensitive board
■ Using laser printer toner transfer
■ Using CAD and a desktop router to cut out the pattern on the copper-clad board
■ Sending the Gerber design files away to a PCB shop
Each of these approaches has pros and cons. The last option has started to become 
cost-effective, with prices as low as a dollar a board for a run of ten boards, and will 
produce professional-quality results. However, you do need to wait, sometimes for 
a week or two. 
We will look at each of these approaches in turn.
Etch-Resistant Pen
Custom etching involves using graphic and chemical techniques to convert a copper-
covered board into a custom-etched one. By doing your own custom etching, you can 
construct highly reliable, tightly compact circuits that require few jumper wires (see 
Fig. 7.7).
FIGURE 7.7  
To design a custom-etched PCB, you first need an insulated board (usually 1⁄16 in. 
thick and made from a fire-resistant epoxy-bonded fiberglass) that is completely cov-
ered on one or both sides with a very thin copper coating. Next, you must transform 
your circuit schematic into a PCB layout. This involves rearranging components in 
such ways as to make all conductive pathways short and direct. The layout should 
also eliminate any wire crossing, if possible.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    563
Once you feel that your hardwired sketch is complete, the next step is to transfer 
it onto the copper-coated board. Afterward, the trick is to etch out all the undesired 
copper-coated sections while leaving the conductive pathways intact. 
At this point, there are a number of different transferring/etching techniques 
from which you can choose. Perhaps the simplest technique involves using a PCB 
kit, which you can buy for a few bucks from a store such as RadioShack. A typical kit 
comes with a single or dual copper-coated board, a bottle of etching solvent, a perma-
nent marker, a bottle of rubbing alcohol, and a drill bit. 
To make your custom-etched board, you first transfer your hardwired sketch onto 
the surface of the board with, say, a pencil. Next, you drill in the appropriate holes 
where component leads are to go. Now, with the etch-resistant pen, you trace over the 
pencil sketch, making sure to encircle the drilled-out holes. After that, you place the 
board in a tub of etching solvent (typically ferric chloride) and wait until the copper 
dissolves away from the sections of the board that are not coated with magic-marker 
ink (the ink does not dissolve in the solvent; it acts to protect the underlying copper). 
After the board is removed from the solvent bath, it is washed off with water, and the 
magic-marker ink is then removed with a rag doused in rubbing alcohol. 
Using a PCB kit is great for simple, single-run productions. PCB kits are easy to use, 
inexpensive, and require practically no special equipment other than what is provided 
in the kit itself. However, one problem with these kits is that you can construct only 
one circuit board at a time. Another problem with these kits is the limited precision 
you get by using a magic marker to create conductive pathways. If you are interested 
in making multiple copies of a circuit, and if you are looking for greater line precision, 
a more sophisticated technique that involves photochemical processes is required.
Photo-etching with OHP Transparency Film
Only the simplest of designs are really suited to hand-drawn PCB design. If you 
invest the time to learn a CAD system, it is unlikely that you will go back to the 
manual approach. 
A great advantage of having your PCB design in a CAD system is that you can 
print it. For this technique, you print it onto transparent film, of the type that used to 
be used on overhead projectors. This film is available in letter and A4 sizes and comes 
in two types: one for laser printers and one for inkjet printers. Don’t put the inkjet 
film into a laser printer (it is likely to melt onto the drum).
Using EAGLE PCB, as shown in Fig. 7.8, you can see the schematic (a), the PCB 
with all the component positions and labels (b), and, finally, just the copper (c).
The process followed here is to draw the schematic and then switch to the board 
view. Here, you drag the components onto the board, leaving airwires connecting the 
components according to the schematic. You can then load a set of design rules and 
click a button, and a PCB layout will be generated automatically. You will probably 
want to intervene, and rip up some of the wires and route them your own way, but 
generally, the automated layout isn’t a bad start.
Once the design is printed onto the film, it is placed on top of presensitized 
copper-clad board. This board is PCB with a photosensitive layer that hardens when 
exposed to UV light. This is available from most hobby electronic stores. While short 
exposure to room lighting will do it no harm, you should keep it in a light-proof 
container.

564    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The board-film sandwich is often held in a frame 
(a clip photo frame will do) while an exposure is 
made using a UV light box. The board is then put 
into a tray of developer, and the image of the PCB 
tracks will become visible on the board, just like 
an old-fashioned photograph being developed.
Next, the board is etched in a chemical that 
dissolves the copper except where it is protected 
by the photographic image of the PCB tracks. This 
part of the process is the same as for a pen-drawn 
PCB.
Figure 7.9 shows a homemade photo-etching 
kit that uses an array of UV LEDs inside an index 
card box to provide the UV exposure. Commercial 
kits are available, of course.
Note that the black areas will end up as copper. 
Quite large areas of black can be seen on the film. 
This reduces the quantity of copper that needs 
to be dissolved and hence extends the life of the 
FIGURE 7.8  EAGLE PCB, schematic and copper layer.
FIGURE 7.9  A photo-etching kit.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    565
chemical. The large areas of copper are generally connected to GND and are termed 
a ground plane.
FIGURE 7.10  A CNC router cutting a PCB.
Laser Printer Toner Transfer
A variation on the transparency film option is to print the PCB layout onto special 
paper using a laser printer, and then use a domestic iron to transfer the toner onto the 
copper-clad board. In this case, the image must be printed reversed. 
With practice, good results can be achieved with this technique, which has the 
advantage of not requiring special tools. There are a number of Internet videos and 
tutorials describing this approach.
Creating a PCB with a Router
Low-cost desktop CNC routers offer a chemical-free method of producing PCBs by 
using normal copper-clad PCB, but then using a computer-controlled CNC router to 
cut away the unwanted copper (see Fig. 7.10).
The process is similar to the photo-etching method. Once the PCB artwork is 
done, the copper layer is dispatched to the router as if it were a printer.
Using a PCB Service
It used to be that designing a PCB was a very specialized skill, and in some ways, it 
still is. For very complex projects heading toward quantity production, the services 
of a specialist PCB design company are worth considering. 
However, programs like EAGLE PCB will take a lot of the difficulty away, both by 
automating the track layout on the PCB and enforcing design rules such as minimum 
track widths, separations, and so on. This makes it entirely feasible to design your 
own PCBs and submit the finished design files to a PCB service. This service is likely 

566    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
to be almost entirely automated, so you will need to make sure your design is right 
before you send it, because these services will not check your design.
A PCB service will produce a great-looking result. All of these services generally 
allow a two-layer board, which provides a top and bottom copper layer. What is great 
is that they also do the following:
■ Create the vias that link a track on one layer to one beneath it.
■ Provide a silk-screen layer that can label the components and mark their positions.
■ Provide a mask layer that covers all the copper not actually intended to be soldered. 
Figure 7.11 shows a typical PCB produced by such a service. The cost for ten of 
these boards can be as low as $10 plus shipping. 
FIGURE 7.11  A PCB created by a PCB services.
The design files that you send to a PCB service are called Gerber files. Table 7.1 
shows the files that you should submit. Each of the files has a different extension 
that indicates its contents. The computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) job feature of 
EAGLE CAD will produce these files for you automatically, using a CAM job file that 
you will find in the instructions on the PCB service’s web site.

All that remains to do is to pay, create a zip file containing the files, and e-mail 
them to the PCB service. Your boards will come back in the post days or weeks later, 
depending on the service level you chose.
Some PCB services will also accept EAGLE CAD .brd files and other CAD formats 
without requiring the generation of Gerber files.
When schematics get even a little complicated, you rapidly find that trying to 
route everything on one layer of copper becomes impossible, and a two-layer board 
becomes necessary. The top and bottom layers can either connect where a component 
lead naturally passes through both layers or using vias that are holes in the board just 
to allow a trace to jump layers.
New and better PCB deals come along all the time, so check the newsgroups to see 
what people are using. Two useful providers are Itead Studio (www.iteadstudio.com) 
and Elektor PCB Service (www.elektor.com). 
A Note About Board Layout
When arranging components on a circuit board, ICs and resistors should be placed 
in rows and should all be pointing in the same direction. Also, make sure to leave 
about a 2 mm border around the circuit board to allow room for card lifters, guides, 
and standoffs. 
Bring power supply leads or other I/O leads to the edge of the board, connect-
ing them through an edge connector, D-connector, barrier-strip connector, or single-
binder posts fixed to the edge of the board. Avoid mounting heavy components on 
circuit boards to prevent damage in case of a fall. 
It is also a good idea to place polarity marking on the board next to devices such 
as diodes and electrolytic capacitors. Placing labels next to IC pins is also helpful. 
Consider labeling test points, trimmer functions (such as zero adjustment), inputs 
and outputs, indicator light functions, and power-supply terminals as well.
7.2.6  Special Pieces of Hardware Used in Circuit Construction
Three pieces of hardware are used frequently during the construction phase: pro-
totyping boards with I/O interfacing gold-plated fingers, IC and transistor socket 
holders, and heat sinks.
Prototyping boards with gold-plated fingers typically are inserted into a card 
cage along with a number of other boards. Each board is inserted through a plastic 
guide and into an edge connector. Separate boards can be linked by means of a flat 
multiple-conductor cable (see Fig. 7.12a). The nice thing about these boards is that 
you can easily remove them from a cage to work on them, without making a mess 
of things in the process. When designing multiple-board devices, it is wise to use a 
separate board for each functional group of a circuit (for example, amplifier sections, 
memory-chip sections, and so on). This will make it easy to find and fix problems 
later on.
IC sockets are used in situations where there is a good chance that the device 
they house will need replacing (see Fig. 7.12b). It is tempting to use such holders 
everywhere within a circuit; however, placing too many IC sockets in a circuit board 
can lead to headaches later on. Often, the socket sections of these holders are poorly 
designed and may prove unreliable over time.

568    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Heat sinks are metal devices with large surface areas that are connected to heat-
generating devices (such as power diodes and transistors) to help dissipate heat 
energy. A heat sink is usually connected to a component by means of a screw and 
washer fastener (see Fig. 7.12c). Silicon grease placed between the washer and heat 
sink is often used to enhance the thermal conductivity between the electrical compo-
nent and heat sink.
7.2.7  Soldering
Solder is a tin-lead (these days, mostly without the lead) alloy used to join compo-
nent leads together. Electrical solder often comes with a rosin flux mixed in, which 
is used to dissolve oxides that are present on the metal surfaces to be joined. Recent 
legislation in Europe (known as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, 
or RoHS) has outlawed the use of lead in consumer electronics. In the United States, 
there are tax incentives to reduce the use of lead. This has led (no pun intended) to 
the development of lead-free solders.
Before solder can be applied with a soldering iron, all metal surfaces must be 
cleansed of oils, silicones, waxes, or grease. Use a solvent, steel wool, or fine sandpa-
per to remove undesirable residue.
When soldering PCBs, use a low-wattage iron (25 to 40 W). To ensure good 
soldering connections, a thin, bright coating of molten solder should be present 
on the tip of the iron. With time, this coat becomes contaminated with oxides and 
should be renewed by wiping its surface with a sponge and then reapplying fresh 
solder. (Applying a fresh coat of solder to the tip of an iron is referred to as tinning 
an iron.)
The trick to making good soldering connections is to first heat the two metal 
pieces to be joined. Do not melt the solder first; otherwise, you will not be able to 
control the placement of the molten solder. Solder likes to flow toward hot spots.
Also when working on a circuit, make sure not to splatter solder on your board. 
If a small piece of solder lands between two separate conductive lines, you will end

up shorting them. When you are finished soldering, inspect your work carefully for 
stray solder spatters and for a good sound joint.
To protect sensitive components from the heat of the soldering iron’s tip, heat-
sink components by gripping the component lead with a needle-nose pliers. Special 
heat-sink clips are also available for this purpose.
See Sec. 7.5.16 for more on soldering equipment.
7.2.8  Desoldering
If you make a bad connection or need to replace a component, you must melt the sol-
der and start over again. But simply melting the solder and then attempting to yank 
the part while the solder is still wet is not always easy. This is especially true when it 
comes to dealing with ICs. 
The trick to freeing a component from the solder’s hold is to first melt the solder 
and then remove the solder with an aspiration tool, or “sucker.” An aspiration tool 
typically resembles a turkey baster or a large syringe-like device. Another method 
that can be used to remove solder is to use a solder wick. This device resembles a 
braided copper wire and acts to draw solder away from a connection by means of 
capillary action.
7.2.9  Enclosing the Circuit
Circuits typically are enclosed in either an aluminum or plastic box. Aluminum enclo-
sures are often used when designing high-voltage devices, whereas plastic containers 
typically are used for lower-voltage applications. If you design a high-voltage circuit 
housed in an aluminum box, make sure to ground the box to avoid getting shocked.

FIGURE 7.13  
Circuit boards that are placed within an aluminum box should be supported off 
the ground with standoffs. If the circuit is ac-powered, drill a hole through the back 
side of the box, and insert a strain relief that grips the cable and a grommet around 
the edges of the hole. Place frequently used switches, dials, and indicators on the 
front panel, and place seldom-used switches and fuses on the back panel. 
If you expect that your circuit will be generating a lot of heat (running more than 
10 W or so), consider installing a blower fan. For circuits running on moderately low 

570    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
power, simple perforated holes placed on the top and bottom of the box will aid in 
conductive cooling. 
Place major heat-producing components, such as power resistors and transistors, 
toward the back of the box, connecting them through the back panel to heat sinks. Make 
sure to orient heat sinks with their fins in the vertical direction. Also, if you are building 
a multiple-board cage device, align all boards vertically to allow for efficient ventilation.
Plastic boxes usually come with built-in standoffs on which to rest the circuit 
board. Typically, these boxes allow for extra room underneath the board for items 
such as batteries and speakers.

7.3  Multimeters
A multimeter, or volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM), is an instrument used to measure 
current, voltage, and resistance. The two most common types of multimeters include 
the analog VOM and the digital VOM, as shown in Fig. 7.15.
The obvious difference between the two types of VOMs is that an analog VOM 
uses a moving-pointer mechanism that swings along a calibrated scale, while the 
digital VOM uses some complex digital circuitry to convert input measurements into 
a digitally displayed reading. Technically speaking, analog VOMs are somewhat less 
accurate than digital VOMs (they typically have a 3 percent higher error in reading 
FIGURE 7.14  

572    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
than a digital VOM), and multiple scales make them harder to read. Also, the resolu-
tion (displayable accuracy) for an analog VOM is roughly 1 part in 100, as compared 
with a 1 part in 1000 resolution for a digital VOM. Despite these limitations, analog 
VOMs are superior to digital VOMs when it comes to testing circuits that contain 
considerable electrical noise. Unlike digital VOMs, which may go blank when noise 
is present, analog VOMs are relatively immune to such disturbances.
Here, we’ll look at how these devices work. Also see Sec. 7.5.3, which discusses 
which type of multimeter you may need for your electronics laboratory.

FIGURE 7.15  
7.3.1  Basic Operation
Measuring Voltages
The trick to measuring voltages with a VOM is to turn 
the selector knob to the voltage setting. If you want to 
measure a dc voltage, the knob is turned to the appro-
priate dc voltage-level setting. If you wish to measure 
an ac voltage, the knob is turned to the ac voltage set-
ting (Vac, or Vrms). Note that the displayed voltage in the 
Vac setting is the RMS voltage (Vrms = 0.707 Vpeak-to-peak). 
Once the VOM is set correctly, the voltage between 
two points in a circuit can be measured by touching the 
VOM’s probes to these points (the VOM is placed in 
parallel). For example, Fig. 7.16 shows the procedure 
used to measure the voltage drop across a resistor.

Measuring Currents
Measuring currents with a VOM is almost as easy 
as measuring voltages. The only difference (besides 
changing the setting) is that you must break the test 
circuit at the location where you wish to make a cur-
rent reading. Once the circuit is open, the two probes 
of the VOM are placed across the break to complete 
the circuit (VOM is placed in series). Fig. 7.17 shows 
how this is done. When measuring ac currents, the 
VOM must be set to the RMS current setting.

Measuring resistances with a VOM is simple enough: 
remove the power to the resistive section of interest, 
and then place the VOM’s probes across this section. 
Of course, make sure to turn the VOM selector knob 
to the ohms setting beforehand.
7.3.2  How Analog VOMs Work
An analog VOM contains an ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter all in one. In prin-
ciple, understanding how each one of these meters works individually will help to 
explain how an analog VOM works as a whole.
Ammeter
An ammeter uses a D-Arsonval galvanometer that consists of a current-controlled 
electromagnetic that imparts a torque on a spring-loaded rotatable needle. The 
amount of deflection of the needle is proportional to the current flow through 
the electromagnet. The electromagnetic coil has some inherent resistance, which 
means you need to throw Rm into the circuit, as shown in Fig. 7.19. (Rm is 
typically around 2 k or so.) 
Now, a galvanometer alone could be used to measure currents directly; how-
ever, if the input current is excessively large, it will force the needle beyond the 
viewable scale. To avoid this effect, a number of shunt resistors placed in paral-
lel with the galvanometer make up a current divider capable of diverting some 
of the “needle-bending” current away from the galvanometer. The current value 
read from the display must be read from the appropriate ruler marking on the 
display that corresponds to the shunt resistance chosen. 
To make this device capable of measuring ac currents, a bridge rectifier can 
be incorporated into the design to provide a dc current to the galvanometer (see the 
lower circuit). The dc current will produce a needle swing that is proportional to 
the alternating voltage measured. A typical ammeter has about a 2-k input resis-
tance. Ideally, an ammeter should have zero input resistance.

Voltmeter
An analog voltmeter, like the ammeter, also uses a D-Arsonval galvanometer. 
Again, the galvanometer has some internal resistance (Rm). When the voltmeter’s 
leads are placed across a voltage difference, a current will flow from the higher 
potential to lower potential, going through the galvanometer in the process. The 
current flow and the needle deflection are proportional to the voltage difference. 
Again, as with the ammeter, shunt resistors are used to calibrate and control 
the amount of needle deflection. To make ac voltage measurements, a bridge 
rectifier, like the one shown in the previous example, can be incorporated into 
the meter’s design. A typical voltmeter has an input resistance of 100 k. An 
ideal voltmeter should have infinite input resistance.

574    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Ohmmeter
To measure resistance, an ohmmeter uses an inter-
nal battery to supply a current through the mea-
sured load and through a galvanometer (the load 
and galvanometer are in series). If the tested load is 
small, a large current will flow through the galva-
nometer, and a large deflection will occur. However, 
if the tested load resistance is large, the current 
flow and the deflection will be small. (In a VOM, 
the ohmmeter calibration markings are backward: 
0 W is set to the right of the scale.) 
The amount of current flow through the galva-
nometer is proportional to the load resistance. The 
ohmmeter is first calibrated by shorting the probe 
leads together and then zeroing the needle. Like the other meters, an ohmmeter uses a number of 
shunt resistors to control and calibrate the needle deflections. A typical ohmmeter has an input 
resistance of about 50 W. An ideal ohmmeter should have zero input resistance.

7.3.3  How Digital Multimeters Work
A digital multimeter is composed of a number of 
functional groups, as shown in the block diagram. 
The signal scaler is an attenuator amplifier that acts as 
a range selector. The signal conditioner converts the 
scaled input signal to a dc voltage within the range 
of the analog-to-digital converter (A/D converter). In 
the case of ac voltage measurements, the ac voltage is 
converted into a dc voltage via a precision rectifier-
filter combination. The gain of the active filter is set 
to provide a dc level equal to the RMS value of the ac 
input voltage or current. 
The signal conditioner also contains circuits to 
convert current and/or resistance into proportional dc 
voltages. The A/D converter converts the dc analog 
input voltage into a digital output voltage. The digi-
tal display provides a digital readout of the measured 
input. Control logic is used to synchronize the opera-
tion of the A/D converter and digital display.
7.3.4  A Note on Measurement Errors
When measuring the current through (or voltage/resistance across) a load, the read-
ing obtained from the VOM will always be different when compared with the true 
value present before the meter was connected. This error comes from the internal 
resistance of the VOM. 
For each setting (ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter), there will be a different 
internal resistance. A real ammeter typically will have a small input resistance of 
around 2 k, while a voltmeter may have an internal resistance of 100 k or more. For 
an ohmmeter, the internal resistance is usually around 50 Ω. It is crucial to know 
these internal resistances in order to make accurate measurements. The following 
examples show how large the percentage error in readings can be for meters with 
corresponding input resistances.

To minimize the percentage error, an ammeter’s input resistance should be less 
than the Thevenin resistance of the original circuit by 20 times or more. Conversely, a 
voltmeter should have an input resistance that is larger than the Thevenin resistance 
of the original circuit by 20 times or more. The same goes for the ohmmeter: it should 
have an input resistance that is at least 20 times the Thevenin resistance of the origi-
nal circuit. By following these simple rules, it is possible to reduce the error to below 
5 percent. 
Another approach (perhaps a bit more tedious) is to look up the internal resis-
tances of your VOM, make your measurements, and then add or subtract the internal 
resistances afterward. (See Appendix B for information about detailed error analysis.)
7.4  Oscilloscopes
Oscilloscopes measure voltages, not currents or resistances—just voltages. This is an 
important point to get straight from the start. An oscilloscope is an extremely fast xy 
plotter capable of plotting an input signal versus time or versus another input signal. 

576    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
As a signal is supplied to the input of a scope, a luminous spot appears on the 
screen. As changes in the input voltage occur, the luminous spot responds by moving 
up or down, or left or right. In most applications, the oscilloscope’s vertical-axis 
(y axis) input receives the voltage part of an incoming signal and then moves the spot 
up or down depending on the value of the voltage at a particular instant in time. The 
horizontal axis (x axis) is usually used as a time axis, where an internally generated 
linear ramp voltage is used to move the spot across the screen from left to right at a 
rate that can be controlled by the operator. 
If the signal is repetitive, such as a sinusoidal wave, the oscilloscope can make the 
sinusoidal pattern appear to stand still. This makes a scope a useful tool for analyzing 
time-varying voltages.

Even though oscilloscopes measure only voltage, it is possible to convert quantities 
such as current, strain, acceleration, pressure, and so on into voltages that the scope can 
use. To convert a current into a voltage, a resistor of known resistance is used; the current 
is measured indirectly by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor and then apply-
ing Ohm’s law. To convert strain, movement, and so on into voltage requires the use of 
transducers (electromechanical devices). By applying some calibrating tricks, the mag-
nitude of, say, a pressure applied to a pressure transducer can be measured accurately.
Here, we’ll look at how oscilloscopes work. Also see Sec. 7.5.5, which discusses 
which type of scope you may need for your electronics laboratory.
7.4.1  How Scopes Work
While it is still possible to buy an analog oscilloscope that uses a cathode-ray tube, 
the majority of modern oscilloscopes are effectively a computer with fast analog-to-
digital converters and an LCD or OLED display. As well as reducing the size and 
weight of the oscilloscope, the use of digital signal processing allows the scope to do 
things that an analog scope cannot do, such as generate clearer color-coded signals, 
provide the memory to pan left and right, allow you to export the display image to 
your computer, and show a frequency domain display. Digital scopes are comparable 
in price to their analog counterparts.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    577
Interestingly, a veteran user of an analog oscilloscope would recognize the con-
trols of a digital oscilloscope. The basic procedure for operating a digital oscilloscope is 
exactly the same as for an analog oscilloscope. It is actually easier to understand what an 
oscilloscope does by studying the workings of an analog oscilloscope than a digital one.
An analog oscilloscope is built around a cathode-ray tube. All the circuits inside 
the scope are designed to take an input signal and modify it into a set of electrical 
instructions that supply the tube’s electron gun with aiming instructions (the location 
where to focus the beam). Most of the knobs and switches on the face of a scope that 
are connected to the interior circuitry are designed to help modify the instructions 
sent to the cathode-ray tube. For example, these controls set voltage scale, time scale, 
intensity of beam, focus of beam, channel selection, triggering, and so on.
Cathode-Ray Tube
A cathode-ray tube consists of an electron gun (filament, cathode, control grid, and 
anode), a second anode, vertical deflection plates, horizontal deflection plates, and 
a phosphor-coated screen. When current flows through the filament, the filament 
heats the cathode to a point where electrons are emitted. The control grid controls the 
amount of electrons that flow through the electron gun, and thus controls the inten-
sity of the beam. If this grid is made more negative in voltage, more electrons will be 
repelled away from the grid, thus reducing the electron flow. 
The electron beam is focused into a sharp point-like beam by applying a control-
ling voltage or focus voltage to anode 1. The second anode is supplied with a large 
voltage that is used to give the electrons within the beam the additional momentum 
needed to cause a photon emission once they collide with the phosphor screen. The 
beam-focusing section of the tube is referred to as the electron gun. 
There are two sets of electrostatic deflection plates (vertical and horizontal) that 
are set between the second anode and the inner face of the phosphor screen. One set 
of plates is used to deflect the electron beam vertically; the other set is used to deflect 
the beam horizontally. For example, when one of the plates of a pair of plates is made 
more negative in charge than the other, the electron beam will bend away from the 
negative plate and veer toward the more positive plate. (The electrons in the beam 
are usually moving with sufficient forward velocity that they never actually come in 
contact with the plates.) When a sawtooth voltage is applied to the horizontal plates, 
the gradually rising potential across the plates pulls the electron beam from the nega-
tive plate to the positive plate, causing the beam to scan across the phosphor screen. 
The vertical plates cause the electron beam to move up and down.

The next step in understanding how an oscilloscope works is knowing how an 
incoming signal is converted into a set of electrical signals or applied voltages that 
control the beam-aiming mechanisms of the cathode-ray tube. This is where the inte-
rior circuitry comes in.

FIGURE 7.28 
Let’s take a sinusoidal signal and see how the interior circuits of a scope convert it 
into something you can see on a display. The first thing you do is apply the sinusoi-
dal signal to the vertical input. From the vertical input, the sinusoidal signal is sent 
to a vertical amplifier, where it is amplified so that it can supply enough voltage to 
deflect the electron beam. The vertical amplifier then sends a signal to the sweep 
selector. When the sweep selector is switched to the internal position (the other posi-
tions are explained in Sec. 7.4.5), the signal from the vertical amplifier will enter the 
sync amplifier. 
The sync amplifier is used to synchronize the horizontal sweep (sawtooth in 
this case) with the signal under test. Without the sync amplifier, the display pattern 
would drift across the screen in a random fashion. The sync amplifier then sends a 
signal to the sawtooth sweep generator, telling it to start a cycle. The sawtooth sweep 
generator then sends a sawtooth signal to a horizontal amplifier (when horizontal 
input is set to internal). At the same time, a signal is sent from the sawtooth sweep 
generator to the blanking circuit. The blanking circuit creates a high negative voltage 
on the control grid (or high positive voltage on the cathode-ray tube cathode), which 
turns off the beam as it snaps back to the starting point. Finally, voltages from the 
vertical and horizontal amplifiers (sawtooth) are sent to the vertical and horizontal 
plates in a synchronized fashion. The final result is a sinusoidal pattern displayed on 
the scope’s screen.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    579
The other features—such as vertical direct and horizontal direct inputs, external 
horizontal input, external trigger, line frequency, and xy mode—are described in 
Sec. 7.4.5. 
It is important to note that the scope does not always use a sawtooth voltage 
applied to the horizontal plates. You can change the knobs and inputs and use another 
input signal for the horizontal axis. Controls such as intensity, focus, and horizontal 
and vertical position of the beam can be understood by looking at the oscilloscope 
circuit diagram.
7.4.3  Aiming the Beam
When no voltages are applied to the horizontal and 
vertical plates, the electron beam is focused at the 
center of the scope’s display. 
When a dc voltage is applied to the vertical plates, 
while no voltage is applied to the horizontal plates, 
the electron beam shifts up or down depending on 
the sign of the applied voltage.
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the vertical 
plates, while no voltage is applied to the horizontal 
plates, a vertical line is traced on the y axis.
When a sawtooth voltage is applied to the horizon-
tal plates, while no voltage is applied to the vertical 
plate, the electron beam traces a horizontal line from

back to the left and repeats its left-to-right sweep.

The scope can be used to 
compare two source signals 
(e.g., measure phase shifts, 
voltage and frequency dif-
ferences, etc.).
Digital Measurements
A scope can be used to cre-
ate timing diagrams for dig-

The scope no longer uses 
the x axis as the time axis, 
but uses signal voltage from 
another external source.
When a dc voltage is applied to the vertical plates, 
while a sawtooth voltage is applied to the horizon-
tal plates, a horizontal line is created that is shifted 
up or down depending on the sign of the dc vertical 
plate voltage (+ or -).
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the verti-
cal plates and a sawtooth voltage is applied to the 
horizontal plates, the electron beam moves up as the 
signal voltage increases and at the same time moves 
to the left as the sawtooth voltage is applied to the 
horizontal plates. The display gives a sinusoidal 
graph. If the applied sinusoidal frequency is twice 
that of the sawtooth frequency, two cycles appear on 
the display.

7.4.5  What All the Little Knobs and Switches Do
Figure 7.31 shows a typical layout of an oscilloscope control panel. The control panel 
of the scope you use may look slightly different (knob positions, digital display, num-
ber of input channels, and so on), but the basic ingredients are the same. If you do not 
find what you need in this section, refer to the oscilloscope user manual that comes 
with the scope.

582    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The control panel of an oscilloscope is divided into the following sections:
Vertical mode: This section of the scope contains all the knobs, buttons, and so on that 
control the vertical graphics of the scope. Most of these are associated with the 
voltage amplitude of an incoming signal.
Horizontal mode: This section of the scope contains all the knobs, buttons, and so on 
that control the horizontal portion of the graphics display. These usually are asso-
ciated with the time base for the scope.
Trigger mode: This section of the scope contains all the knobs, buttons, and so on that 
control the way in which the scope “reads” an incoming signal. This section of the 
scope is probably the most technical. To understand triggering, read the upcom-
ing “Trigger Mode” section.
Vertical Mode
The following are the vertical mode controls:
CH1 and CH2 coaxial inputs: Where input signals enter the scope.
AC, GRD, and DC switches:
  ■ AC: Blocks the dc component of the signal, passing only the ac part of the signal.
  ■ DC: Measures direct input of both ac and dc components of the input signal.
  ■  GRD: Grounds input, causing vertical plates in cathode-ray tubes to become 
uncharged, thus eliminating electron beam deflection. Used to recalibrate the 
vertical component of the electron beam to a reference position on the display 
after altering the vertical position of the knob.
CH1 VOLTS/DIV and CH2 VOLTS/DIV knobs: Used to set the voltage scale on the 
display. For example, 5 V/div means that each division (1 cm) on the display is 
5 V high.
MODE switches:
  ■  CH1, BOTH (DUAL), CH2 switch: This switch allows you to pick between dis-
playing a signal from channel 1 or channel 2, or display both channels at the 
same time.
NORM, INVERT: This switch lets you choose to display a signal normally or inverted.

ADD, ALT, and CHOP:
  ■  ADD: Adds signals from channel 1 and channel 2 together arithmetically.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    583
  ■  ALT: Alternate sweep is selected regardless of sweep time, and the NORM-
CHOP switch has no effect.
  ■  CHOP: Operates the triggering SOURCE switch, providing automatic or man-
ual selection of the alternate or chop method of dual-trace sweep generation.
POSITION knob: This knob allows you to move the displayed image up or down on 
the screen.
XY mode: When selected, the sweep rate (time base) supplied by the scope is switched 
off, and an external signal voltage applied to the channel 2 input replaces it.
Horizontal Mode
The following are the horizontal mode controls:
SEC/DIV knob: This knob sets the sweep speed or the scale for the horizontal time 
display. For example, 0.5 ms/DIV means each division (1 cm) on the display is 
0.5 ms wide.
MODE switches:
  ■  NO DLY: This setting takes the horizontal signal and presents it to display 
immediately.
  ■  DLY’D: This setting delays the horizontal signal for a time you specify on the 
delay time section of scope. Use this to set the delay time of a signal.
SWEEP-TIME variable control: Sometimes known as the sweep frequency control, fine 
frequency control, or frequency vernier. Used as a fine sweep-time adjustment. In 
the extreme clockwise (CAL) position, the sweep time is calibrated by using the 
SWEEP TIME/CM switch. In the other positions, the variable control provides a 
continuously variable sweep rate.
POSITION knob: Moves the horizontal display left or right. This feature is useful 
when comparing two input signals. It allows you to align the wave patterns for 
comparison.
Trigger Mode
The following are the trigger mode controls:
EXT TRIG jack: Input terminal for external trigger signals.
CAL terminal: Provides a calibrated 1-kHz, 0.1-V peak-to-peak squarewave signal. 
The signal can be used to calibrate the vertical-amplifier attenuators and to check 
frequency compensation of probes used with the scope.
HOLDOFF control: Used to adjust holdoff time (ignore triggers until holdoff time has 
expired).

TRIGGERING mode switch:
  ■  SINGLE: When a signal is nonrepetitive, or if it varies in amplitude, shape, or 
time, a conventional repetitive display can produce an unstable presentation. 
SINGLE enables the RESET switch for triggered single-sweep operation. The 
signal sweep can be used to photograph a nonrepetitive signal. Pushing the RE-
SET button initiates a single sweep that begins when the next sync trigger occurs.
  ■  NORM: Used for triggered sweep operation. The triggering threshold is adjust-
able by means of the triggering LEVEL control. No sweep is generated in the 
absence of the triggering signal or if the LEVEL control is set in such a way 
as to allow the threshold to exceed the amplitude of the triggering signal 
(see Fig. 7.35).
  ■  AUTO: Selects automatic sweep operation, where the sweep generator free-
runs and generates a sweep without a trigger signal (this is often referred to as 
a recurrent sweep operation). In AUTO mode, the sweep generator automatically 
switches to triggered sweep operation if an acceptable trigger signal is present. 
The AUTO position is useful when first setting up the scope in order to observe 
a waveform. It provides a sweep for waveform operation until other controls 
can be set properly. DC AUTO sweep must be used for dc measurements and 
for signals of such low amplitude that the sweep is not triggered.
  ■  FIX: This is the same as the AUTO mode, except that triggering always occurs at 
the center of the sync trigger waveform regardless of the LEVEL control setting.
SLOPE button: Selects the point at which a scope will trigger. When positive slope is 
selected, the scope will begin a sweep only when the signal voltage crosses the 
LEVEL voltage during a positive sloping rise (see the description of the LEVEL 
knob). A negative slope setting initiates a sweep to occur when the signal crosses 
the LEVEL voltage during a negative sloping fall (see Fig. 7.34).

RESET button: When the triggering MODE switch is set to SINGLE, pushing the 
RESET button initiates a single sweep that begins when the next sync trigger 
occurs.
READY/TRIGGER indicator: In SINGLE trigger mode, an indicator light turns on 
when the RESET button is pushed in, indicating that a sweep is beginning. The 
light turns off when the sweep is completed. In the NORM, AUTO, and FIX 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    585
triggering modes, the indicator turns on for the duration of the triggered sweep. 
The indicator also shows when the LEVEL control is set properly to obtain triggering.
LEVEL knob: Used to trigger a sweep. LEVEL sets the point when the scope will trigger 
based on the amplitude of the applied signal. The level can be shifted up or down. 
The READY/TRIGGER indicator turns on when the sweep is triggered, indicating 
that the triggering LEVEL control is within the proper range (see Fig. 7.35).

COUPLING switch: Used to select input coupling for the sync trigger signal.
  ■  AC: This is the most commonly used position. AC position permits triggering 
from 10 Hz to typically over 35 MHz (depending on your scope) and blocks any 
dc component of the sync trigger signal.
  ■  LF REJ: The dc signals are rejected, and signals below 10 kHz are attenuated; 
the sweep is triggered by only the higher-frequency components of the signal. 
This is useful for providing stable triggering when the trigger signal contains 
line-frequency components, such as 60-Hz hum.
without LF REJ
with LF REJ
  ■  HF REJ: Attenuates signals above 100 kHz. This is used to reduce high-frequen-
cy noise or to initiate a trigger from the amplitude of a modulated envelope 
rather than the carrier frequency.
  ■ VIDEO: Used to view composite video signals. 
  ■  DC: Permits triggering from dc to typically over 35 MHz. The DC coupling can 
be used to provide stable triggering for low-frequency signals that would 

586    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
otherwise be attenuated if measured in the AC setting. The LEVEL control can 
be adjusted to provide triggering at the desired dc level on the waveform.
7.4.6  Measuring Things with Scopes
A scope’s buttons and knobs must be set properly to obtain accurate measurements. 
If just one of these buttons or switches is set wrong, things can go haywire. You must 
make sure every button is set correctly.
This section covers a number of applications for oscilloscopes, such as making 
phase measurements between two signals. For each application, the procedure is 
to set the scope to the initial settings listed next, and then adjust particular buttons 
and knobs to put the scope in the proper configuration needed for that particular 
application.
Initial Scope Settings
First, start with the following settings:
■  Power switch: Off
■  Internal recurrent sweep (TRIGGER mode switch): Off (NORM or AUTO position)
■  Focus: Lowest setting
■  Gain: Lowest setting
■  Intensity: Lowest setting
■  Sync controls (LEVEL, HOLDOFF): Lowest settings
■  Sweep selector: External (EXT)
■  Vertical position control: Midpoint
■  Horizontal position control: Midpoint
Next, adjust the settings as follows:
■  Power switch: On
■  Focus: Until beam is in focus
■  Intensity: Desired luminosity
■  Sweep selector: Internal (use the linear internal sweep if more than one sweep is 
available)
■  Vertical position control: Until beam is centered on display
■  Horizontal position control: Until beam is centered on display
■  Internal recurrent sweep: On; set the sweep frequency to any frequency above 100 Hz
without HF REJ

FIGURE 7.37

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    587
■  Horizontal gain control: Check that the luminous spot has expanded into a horizon-
tal trace or line; return horizontal gain control to zero or lowest setting
■  Internal recurrent sweep: Off
■  Vertical gain control: To midpoint; touch the vertical input with a finger; the stray 
signal pickup should cause the spot to be deflected vertically into a trace or line; 
check that the line length is controllable by adjusting the vertical gain control; re-
turn the vertical gain control to zero or the lowest setting
■  Internal recurrent sweep: On; advance the horizontal gain control to expand the spot 
into a horizontal line

3.  Fiddle with the vertical VOLT/DIV knob until the signal comes into view.
4.  Set the input selector (AC/GRD/DC) to ground (GRD).
5.  Switch the scope to the internal recurrent sweep. Fiddle with the SEC/DIV knob 
until the electron beam is tracing out a desired path of the screen.
6.  Now you should have a horizontal line in view. Center this line on the x axis or 
some desired reference position by adjusting the vertical position knob. Make 
sure you do not fiddle around with the vertical position knob after it has been set 
to the desired reference point. If you do, your measurements will be offset. If you 
think you have accidentally moved the vertical position line, set the input selector 
to GRD and recalibrate.

588    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
7.  Set the input selector switch (AC/GRD/DC) to DC. Connect the probe to the 
signal being measured.
8.  Fiddle with the vertical and horizontal VOLT/DIV knob and SEC/DIV knob to 
get the signal into view.
9.  Once you have an image of your signal on the screen, take a look at your VOLT/
DIV and SEC/DIV knobs and record these settings. Now, visually measure the 
period, peak-to-peak voltage, and so on of the displayed image, using the centi-
meter grid lines on the scope’s screen as a ruler. To find the actual voltages and 
times, multiply the measurement made in centimeters by the VOLT/DIV (or 
VOLTS/cm) and SEC/DIV (SEC/cm) recorded set values. The example in 
Fig. 7.39 shows how to calculate the peak-to-peak voltage, root-mean-square 
voltage, period, and frequency of a sinusoidal waveform.
Measuring Current
As mentioned earlier, oscilloscopes can measure only voltages; they do not directly 
measure currents. However, with the help of a resistor and Ohm’s law, you can trick 
the scope into making current measurements. You simply measure the voltage drop 
across a resistor of known resistance and let I = V/R do the rest. Typically, the resis-
tor’s resistance must be small to avoid disturbing the operating conditions within 
the circuit that is being measured. A high-precision 1-Ω resistor is often used for such 
instances.
Let’s now take a look at the specifics of how to measure currents with a scope.
1.  Set up your equipment as shown in Fig. 7.40.

2.  Set the scope to the initial settings listed earlier in the “Initial Scope Settings” 
 section.
3.  Apply a dc current to be measured through the resistor. Here, we’ll use a 1-Ω 
resistor to make the calculations simple and to avoid altering the dynamics of 
the circuit being tested. The wattage of the resistor must be at least 2 Ω times the 
square of the maximum current (expressed in amps). For example, if the maxi-
mum anticipated current is 0.5 A, the minimum wattage of the resistor should be 
2 Ω × (0.5 A)2 = 1⁄2 W.
4.  Measure the voltage drop across the resistor using the scope. The unknown cur-
rent will equal the magnitude of the voltage measured, provided that you stick 
with the 1  Ω resistor. Figure 7.41 shows some example measurements, two of 
which describe how to measure RMS and total (dc + ac) effective currents.

Phase Measurements Between Two Signals
Suppose that you wish to compare the phase relationship between two voltage sig-
nals. To do so, apply one of the signals to CH1 and the other to CH2. Then, using the 
DUAL setting (or BOTH setting), you can display both signals at the same time and 
align them side by side to compare the phased difference between them. Here’s how 
to view both signals:

1.  Step up your equipment as shown in Fig. 7.42.
2.  Set the scope to the initial settings listed earlier in the “Initial Scope Settings” sec-
tion. Note that cables should be short, of the same length, and have similar electri-
cal characteristics. At high frequencies, a difference in cable length or a difference 
in electrical characteristics between cables can introduce improper phase shifts.
3.  Switch the scope’s internal recurrent sweep to on.
4.  Set the scope to dual trace (DUAL) mode.
5.  Fiddle with the CH1 and CH2 VOLT/DIV settings until both signals are of similar 
amplitudes. This makes measuring phase differences easier.
6.  Determine the phase factor of the reference signal. If one period (360°) of a signal 
is 8 cm, then 1 cm equals one-eighth of 360°, or 45°. The 45° value represents the 
phase factor (see Fig. 7.43).
7.  Measure the horizontal distance between corresponding points (for example, cor-
responding peaks or troughs) of the two waveforms. Multiply this measured dis-
tance by the phase factor to get the phase difference (see Fig. 7.43). For example, 
if the measured difference between the two signals is 2 cm, then the phase differ-
ence is 2 × 45°, or 90°.

7.4.7  Scope Applications
The ability for an oscilloscope to “freeze” a high-frequency waveform makes it an 
incredibly useful instrument for testing electronic components and circuits whose 
response curves, transient characteristics, phase relationships, and timing relationships 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    591
are of fundamental importance. For example, scopes are used to study the shape of 
particular waveforms (such as squarewave, sawtooth, and so on). They are used to 
measure static noise (current variation caused by poor connections between compo-
nents), pulse delays, impedances, digital signals, and other values. The list goes on. 
This section presents a few example scope applications.

Here, a scope is used to determine if the sliding con-

eter will present a solid voltage line on the scope’s 
screen, whereas a bad potentiometer will present a 
noisy pattern on the display. Before concluding that 
a potentiometer is bad, make sure that noise was not 
present beforehand. For example, the cables used in 
this test may have been at fault.

7.4.8  Measuring Impedances
The method of measuring impedance presented here makes use of comparing the 
reflected pulse with the output pulse. When the output signal travels down a trans-
mission line, part of the signal will be reflected and sent back along the line to the 
source whenever the signal encounters a mismatch or difference in impedance. 
The line has a characteristic impedance. If the line impedance is greater than 
the source impedance (thing being measured), the reflected signal will be inverted. 
If the line impedance is lower than the source impedance, the reflected signal will 
not be inverted.

To make electronics a safe and enjoyable experience, you need a decent electronics 
laboratory. In this section, you’ll learn key features common to all good electronics 
laboratories. You’ll discover how to set up a work area to limit external electromag-
netic noise from coupling with your circuits, as well as how to prevent ESD from 
damaging sensitive ICs. You’ll also learn about the various kinds of test equipment, 
prototyping equipment, and tools needed for troubleshooting and designing circuits. 
If you are serious about electronics, you will naturally end up with a setup like this. 
However, to get started, you do not need to have all this equipment; a desk, soldering 
iron, and multimeter will get you a long way.
Keep in mind that the most important tool you’ll use when doing electronics is 
your brain. So if you lack a piece of equipment or tool listed here, see how you can 
work around the problem. However, be aware that you may spend more time than 
is necessary locating problems or constructing “flaky” circuits, simply because you 
lack the right gear.
Finally, if some of the information that follows seems a bit over your head, don’t 
panic. Most of the technical information relates to test equipment specifications and 
troubleshooting nomenclature. The aim is to give you a good enough understanding 
to determine which features are important when purchasing items.
7.5.1  Work Area
Get a sturdy, large workbench so you can spread stuff out. Ideally, it should be 
equipped with a ground plane of metal that can be easily connected to and discon-
nected from earth ground (the green wire ground of an ac outlet). The ground plane 
helps prevent RF background radiation, 60-Hz noise, and other external electromag-
netic and electrostatic disturbances from coupling with your circuit. Place an insu-
lating sheet or cardboard between the bench and the circuit you’re testing so that 
nothing shorts to ground. 
For casual measurements that don’t require high precision, you can usually get by 
without a ground plane. If you run into interference problems and your bench doesn’t 
have a ground plane, simply place your circuit on a double-insulated metal sheet 
that’s soldered to a wire connected to ground. A grounded, single-sided copper-clad 
board, placed copper side up, with a cardboard sheet over the top, will also work.
You can find a number of electronics workbenches online, or you can make your 
own. A design plan for a five-shelf, 31 × 72 × 72-in. metal-frame workbench constructed

(Sec. 7.5.23).
FIGURE 7.52  A workstation that has been set up to minimize ESD by using grounded dissipative mats and a wrist strap. 
For reliable grounding, use separate grounding wires for each mat and wrist strap, running them directly to a common 
ground point.
Damaging ESD between your body and sensitive ICs can be eliminated at your 
workbench by making sure your tabletop work area, your body, and the floor area are 
grounded to earth or a common reference. Note that you should not directly ground 
yourself—the risk of line voltage shock is a real potential hazard. Instead, invest in 
a wrist strap that houses a series 1-MΩ resistor. The resistor limits potentially lethal 
current flow, while providing a sufficient path for ESD.
If you’re using a rubber mat on a concrete floor to limit the risk of electrical shock, 
make sure it’s made with antistatic rubber; otherwise, you may actually be increas-
ing the risk of ESD. For carpeted areas, you can buy a special antistatic ground mat 
or spray it with antistatic spray. DESCO, 3M, and a number of other manufacturers 
make ESD-protective work mats and complete workstation grounding kits.
Also, make sure that all equipment is properly grounded. This includes ground-
ing your soldering iron’s tip when soldering sensitive components. Though most 
equipment is already grounded to earth through the three-wire power cords, don’t 
assume the ground is without fault. Test all grounds to see if they are at the same 
potential. Use an ohmmeter to test the resistance between earth ground and equip-
ment ground posts, plugs, and chassis bodies. If an item is not properly grounded 
and you touch it, you’ll become the best path to ground. Good grounding also elimi-
nates ground loops and limits external noise from coupling with your circuit.
7.5.2  Test Equipment
You can obtain a vast assortment of equipment for your laboratory. The limiting fac-
tor is your budget. A great place to look for used equipment is eBay. You’ll find new, 
top-of-the-line items all the way down to the clunkers. However, be aware that you 
can find new equipment that’s not that much more expensive than the used stuff by 
checking out electronics sites such as www.web-tronics.com and others listed in 
Sec. 7.5.20.
Do your homework before purchasing anything. Make sure the specs (band-
width, input impedance, accuracy, and so on) stand up to the testing you have in mind. 

596    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Don’t be misled into thinking that you must have the newest and most expensive 
instruments to work with electronics. Unabused equipment that is 20 years old or 
even older can be remarkably reliable. Just be certain that the seller can verify that 
the equipment is in working order and has been recently calibrated. Also, ask for an 
inspection period before the deal is final.
7.5.3  Multimeters
If you plan to do a lot of serious bench work, get a bench digital multimeter (DMM) 
with at least five-digit resolution. For more digits and higher accuracy, expect to pay 
considerably more. Be sure the meter comes with autorange lockout so it can achieve the 
highest accuracy and speed. For many circuits, it’s important that the meter come with a 
high-impedance input (>10,000 MΩ) that stays at high impedance up to 20 V or so. This 
prevents the meter from loading down your circuit and reduces measurement errors. 
There are a number of meters with 10-MΩ inputs, which are okay if you don’t 
see the 10 MΩ being a problem. Look for meters with four-wire resistance measure-
ment capability—a feature that eliminates errors caused by test lead resistance. A few 
decent meters you can find on eBay include the HP3468A (5.5-digit), the HP34401A 
(6.5-digit), and the HP3485A (8.5-digit).
If you are on a budget, then look for a hand-held DMM with a pull-out stand on 
the back, a large display, and a backlight. These make a reasonable alternative to a 
high-quality multimeter. 
FIGURE 7.53  Left: HP 34401A bench DMM with 6.5-digit resolution and computer interface. 
Center: Metex M-3860M 33⁄4 digital DMM loaded with handy features, such as an RS232 interface, 
true RMS, temperature, inductance, capacitance, logic analyzer, transistor hFE tester, diode tester, 
and frequency counter. Right: A simple analog meter useful for monitoring trends.
It’s also nice to have a few auxiliary meters handy for taking a number of mea-
surements at the same time. Get a hand-held DMM with true RMS and at least three 
to four digits of resolution. These meters will run you anywhere from $50 to $300, 
although you shouldn’t need to pay more than $100 to $150 for a decent one. Hand-
held meters with additional features—such as a capacitance tester, an inductance 
tester, diode and transistor testers, a frequency counter, and a thermometer—come 
in handy, especially when prototyping. You never know when you’ll need to check 
polarity of an LED, check the hFE of a transistor, or check whether your guess at a 
capacitance label is on target.
Analog meters, though not as popular today, are still useful. They have inferior 
accuracy and resolution when compared with a DMM, but when you watch an ordinary 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    597
analog meter, your eye can detect trends or rates of change that are hard to spot on 
a DMM, especially in the presence of noise or jitter. Another advantage of an analog 
meter is its passive nature; it won’t inject noise into your circuit, as a digital meter is 
capable of doing. An analog meter will also tell you things about a slowly moving 
signal, as you don’t just get an instantaneous reading but can see how fast the read-
ing is changing. This is something that you cannot really see on a digital meter. Some 
digital meters get around this problem by providing a barograph-type display to 
accompany the numbers.
As a final option, you can check out some PC-based DMMs. These devices plug in 
to your computer directly through an expansion slot (such as the PCI slot) or through 
a box that is linked to your computer via a serial, parallel, or USB cable. Current 
technology has made PC-based performance much better than in the past. Check out 
National Instruments’ NI PXI-4070 DMM, which is a 61⁄2-digit DMM—a very impres-
sive device. Consider these instruments if you plan to do data logging.
7.5.4  DC Power Supplies
Probably the single most used piece of equipment that you will use is a lab dc power 
supply to provide a steady dc voltage. Get a variable dc constant-voltage/constant-
current supply that can be configured for single- and split-polarity applications, as 
follows:
■  A single-polarity arrangement—say, a +12-V supply used for driving a dc motor—
would use the positive terminal (+) as the source and the negative terminal (−) as 
the return. 
■  A split supply—say, a ±15-V one used to power an operational amplifier that 
swings both positive and negative in reference to a common ground—would use 
the positive terminal (+15 V), the negative terminal (−15 V), and the common ter-
minal (COM), which acts as a 0-V reference.
Some supplies, like the center supply shown in Fig. 7.54, house two separate vari-
able voltage sources. To create a split power source using such a supply, the two 
variable sections are connected in series using a jumper cable; the common becomes 
the junction point where the jumper cable is located. (You’ll typically need to flip a 
switch on the supply to specify series mode.)
Buy a model that has built-in current and voltage displays. The current being 
drawn by a circuit is a great indicator of health or ill health.
FIGURE 7.54  Constant current/voltage supplies with current lockout and voltage controls. 
The supply to the left comes with a negative, common, and positive terminal. The center supply 
houses three independent dc sources, two of which are variable, while the other is fixed at 5 V. 
The variable sections can be used independently, in series, or in parallel. To create a split supply, 
the two sections are placed in series, and the common becomes the junction between the two 
sections. The supply to the right houses split and fixed (5-V) sections. It can save and recall three 
voltage/current settings.

598    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Your supply should also come with an earth ground terminal that is internally 
connected to earth ground through the ac power cord’s ground wire, which has a 
conductive path to the ground rod buried outside your home. Many circuits, and 
most test equipment (oscilloscopes, function generators, and so on), will use the 
earth ground as a reference. For example, the outer BNC sleeve of an oscilloscope’s 
input channel or the output sleeve of a function generator’s output is typically earth 
ground.
Also look for supplies that come with an additional fixed +5-V output useful for 
powering logic circuits. These outputs are typically rated for 3 A.
Your supply should come with fine and coarse adjustment controls and current-
limit lockout. Avoid digital current/voltage controls, since they don’t let you con-
tinuously sweep up and down while monitoring for trends.
A nice supply, available for about $500 used, is the HP3631A shown in Fig. 7.54. 
It comes with save and recall features that allow you to store and recall up to three 
power supply setups. It also comes with an RS-232 interface. If you can’t afford a sup-
ply like this, you can find other supplies—minus all the bells and whistles—that will 
do the job. There are a number of other programmable supplies out there, but they 
tend to be rather expensive. Another option is to build your own supply, as discussed 
in Chap. 11.
Switch-mode variable power supplies can be bought for less than $100 for a single 
output and around $150 for dual-channel. If you are trying to keep costs down and 
are not going to be doing much work that requires a split power supply, then a single-
channel device may be just fine for you.
Another useful troubleshooting tool is a set of batteries—alkaline, NiHM, or 
whatever is suitable. You can use a stack of them to create any desired voltage—
for example, two 9-V batteries for +18 V or ±9 V. Batteries are a useful alternative 
power supply for low-noise circuits, such as in a preamplifier. If the preamp’s output 
doesn’t get quiet when you substitute your batteries in place of your ordinary supply, 
don’t blame the power supply. You can also use batteries to power low-noise circuits, 
like those sealed in a metal box, without contaminating their signals with power sup-
ply noise.
7.5.5  Oscilloscope 
Get a bench oscilloscope (which displays voltage waveforms) with at least two chan-
nels so that you can track two signals at once. Also, make sure it comes with a band-
width of at least 100 MHz. 
Even when working on slow amplifier circuits, a wide-bandwidth scope is impor-
tant to catch high-frequency oscillations. A wide bandwidth is also important for 
catching higher-frequency components or harmonics of nonsinusoidal waveforms. 
For example, to catch the fifth harmonic of a 100-MHz square waveform, you’ll need 
a more expensive scope (and probe) with a bandwidth of 500 MHz. 
As a rule of thumb, to make accurate frequency measurements, your scope’s band-
width should be three to five times greater than the fundamental frequency wave-
form you’re measuring. To make truly accurate amplitude measurements that are 
not dominated by the scope’s frequency response, you’ll need a bandwidth greater 
than ten times the frequency being measured. Signal measurements on frequencies 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    599
beyond the scope’s bandwidth will result in attenuation drops greater than −3 dB, 
and rise and fall times that can literally turn a nice, clean squarewave into a weak sine 
wave. Figure 7.56 shows attenuation and rise-time effects on a 50-MHz squarewave 
measured with 20-MHz, 100-MHz, and 500-MHz scopes.
FIGURE 7.55  From vintage to high-tech, scopes will cost you accordingly. Left: An Eiko TR-410 
10-MHz scope for around $30 on eBay. It’s an incredibly slow scope by today’s standards, but 
it’s okay for general-purpose work on low-frequency circuits. Center: Tektronix 2246 100-MHz, 
four-channel analog oscilloscope with voltage and time cursors with on-screen readout. For about 
$400, used, on eBay, it’s a good investment for general-purpose testing. Right: Cutting-edge  
Infiniium 54850 oscilloscope with InfiniiMax 1130 probes has a 6-GHz bandwidth with a 20-Gsa/s 
sample rate on all four of its channels. It comes with a user interface based on Microsoft 
Windows XP Pro, and supports CD-RW, dual-monitor, and third-party software. Don’t expect 
to be able to buy one for personal use, unless you plan on robbing a bank. At the other end of 
the cost spectrum, new LCD-based scopes can be bought for around $55 (check out http://store.
nkcelectronics.com/digital-storage-oscilloscope-very-low-cost.html) and take up a lot less bench 
space than a vintage scope.
When buying a scope (Fig. 7.55), you’ll need to decide between an analog or a 
digitizing scope. In terms of recent technology, digital scopes are more powerful and 
more responsive. Analog scopes do have some positives, such as familiar controls, 
instantaneous display updating for real-time adjustments, direct dedicated controls 
for often-used adjustments, and a reasonable price range. However, they lack accu-
racy, have no pretrigger viewing capability and limited bandwidth (seldom exceeds 
400 MHz), and can’t store waveforms into memory for later recall.
Modern digitizing scopes, on the other hand, have display storage; high accuracy; 
pretrigger viewing capability; peak/glitch detection; automatic measurements; com-
puter and printer connectivity; waveform-processing capability, including waveform 
math functions; display modes such as averaging and infinite persistence; and self-
calibration. A good digitizing scope will cost you a considerable amount. Expect to 
pay $1,000 or more for a used one, and as much as $50,000 for a new, top-of-the-line 
model. However, the price of digital scopes is falling all the time, and a dual-channel 
50 MHz or 250 M samples/second (MS/s) with more features than you could shake 
a stick at can be bought for less than $500. The price rises steeply with bandwidth, so 
check what is available and read the reviews before you buy.
If you decide on a digitizing scope, make sure it comes with a high sample rate, 
which is the rate at which the scope can take a “snapshot” of the incoming signals. 
A higher sample rate translates into more real-time bandwidth and better real-time 
resolution. Most manufacturers use a sample rate–to–real-time bandwidth ratio of 
at least 4:1 (if digital reconstruction is employed) or 10:1 (without reconstruction) to 
prevent aliasing. Also, make sure to consider the scope’s memory depth.

600    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 7.56  Screenshots show the same 50-MHz squarewave displayed on three different scopes with different band-
widths. The 500-MHz scope shows the best high-frequency detail and representation of rise times. As you move down in 
bandwidth, notice the increase in rise time and amplitude attenuation. The bandwidth of your scope should be at least 
three times the fundamental frequency of the fastest signal you expect to measure, and as much as ten times more for 
accurate amplitude measurements.
An alternative to a stand-alone oscilloscope is a PC-based scope. These scopes 
use your computer and the software running on it as the testing component. Most 
PC-based scopes are composed of an interface card or adapter. The card adapter con-
nects to your PC via an expansion slot (such as an ISA or a PCI slot), via a serial, 
parallel, or USB port, depending on the model. A test probe then connects to the 
interface. Software on your PC interprets the data coming through the interface and 
displays the results on the monitor. Low-cost (low-performance) PC-based scopes 
cost around $100, but the price goes up considerably with bandwidth. 
Unless you’re focused more on data acquisition than circuit testing and trouble-
shooting, we suggest a stand-alone scope over a PC-based one. Having to boot up 
a computer before you can use the scope becomes irritating. Although a number of 
high-end PC-based scopes come with decent bandwidth, the affordable ones will 
usually come with crummy bandwidth (20 MHz or so). Expect to pay upward of 
$1,000 for one with bandwidth of at least 100 MHz.
CompuScope 8500 can sample one ana-
log input at speeds up to 500 MS/s with 
8-bit resolution and data storage in 
on-board memory. It has two separate 
inputs: a 1-MW input and a very high-
bandwidth 50-W input. GageScope soft-
ware running on your computer captures 
data from the CompuScope plug-in, ana-
lyzes the data, and automatically calcu-
lates the result. CompuScope 8500 can 
measure rise times, fall times, frequency, 
pulse width, and amplitude, and it can 
even perform spectral analysis.
7.5.6  Oscilloscope Probes
Get suitable probes for your scope, preferably three: one for a trigger and two for 
separate channels. Though it’s possible to connect a scope to your circuit with just a 
FIGURE 7.57

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    601
bare wire, that’s a bad idea. The bare wire can load the scope’s input amplifier with 
its high capacitance and inductance, but it can also cause a short. 
Multimeter test leads or hookup wire rigged to a BNC connector will work 
for certain applications (usually low frequency), but they can pick up external 
radiation (such as 60-Hz power, radio, TV, and fluorescent lighting) that can 
corrupt your signals. Using a shielded, unterminated coaxial cable with make-
shift probe wires can reduce stray pickup; however, the coaxial cable, in con-
junction with a standard scope, can introduce a new set of problems. The inher-
ent capacitance of a coaxial cable (typically 100 pF/m) has the tendency to 
capacitively load a circuit under test, while the cable will experience resonant 
effects at certain frequencies, generating signal reflections that result in signal 
corruption. For this reason, it’s a bad idea to lengthen a dedicated probe cable 
by attaching a coaxial cable, unless you’re dealing with special 50-Ω probes and 
50-Ω scopes.
Without the appropriate probe, you can run into all sorts of problems. The 
main problem you’ll face is circuit loading, where the thing you’re using to 
probe your circuit will draw too much current and result in a voltage drop. 
Also, if the thing you’re using has built-in capacitance and inductance (for 
example, coaxial cable), you’ll run into capacitive-loading problems that will 
affect timing measurements, as well as inductive-loading problems that will 
distort signals. With a long ground probe wire, the distributed internal induc-
tance of the wire will interact with the probe’s capacitance and cause ring-
ing—seen as a sinusoid of decaying amplitude impressed on pulses. These 
loading effects may also cause a working circuit to malfunction or a nonwork-
ing circuit to spring to life. 
 Even when using dedicated oscilloscope probes, you’ll still run into these 
loading problems, and they will grow more severe with increasing frequency. 
At higher frequencies, the capacitive reactance of the probe’s tip decreases, 
resulting in increased loading. This will limit the bandwidth and increase rise 
times. In terms of resistive loading, a probe with lower built-in resistance will 
cause greater attenuation.
The best thing to do when selecting a probe is to find your scope’s manual and 
see what kind of probes it recommends. If a manual is nowhere to be found, check 
out the oscilloscope or probe manufacturers’ websites for suggestions. Otherwise, 
consider the following:
■  Make sure that the probe’s input connectors match those of your scope. Most 
scopes come with BNC-type input connectors; others may use SMA connectors. 
More sophisticated scopes may have specially designed connectors to support 
readout, trace, probe power (for active probes and differential probes), and other 
special functions.

602    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
■  Choose a probe whose input resistance and capacitance match the input resistance 
and capacitance of your scope. Matching is critical for ensuring proper signal 
transfer and fidelity. The input resistance and capacitance of a probe are used to 
describe its loading effects. At low frequencies (<1 MHz), the probe input resis-
tance is the key factor for loading of the circuit being tested. At higher frequencies, 
the probe input capacitance becomes the significant factor.
Scopes come with either a 1-MΩ input resistance or a 50-Ω input resistance (some 
come with both). A 1-MΩ input is most common and is used for general-purpose test-
ing, while a 50-Ω input is used within 50-Ω environments where high speed and low 
loading are needed. You must use 1- MΩ probes with 1-MΩ inputs, and 50-Ω probes 
with 50-Ω inputs. An exception to this one-to-one resistance matching occurs when 
using attenuator probes. For example, a 10X probe used with a 1-MΩ input will have 
a 10-MΩ input resistance, while a 10X probe used with a 50-Ω input will have a 500-Ω 
input resistance. 
The input capacitance of a scope, unlike its standard input resistance (1 MΩ or 
50 MΩ) can vary, depending on the scope’s bandwidth and other design features. 
Though a common input capacitance for many 1-MΩ scopes is usually 20 pF, it’s 
entirely possible your scope has a different value, between 5 pF and 100 pF or so. To 
match the probe’s capacitance with that of the scope, choose a probe whose capaci-
tance is within the same range of your scope, and then narrow things down by adjust-
ing the probe’s compensation network, using the probe’s trimmer capacitor. This is 
referred to as “compensating your probe”. It’s important to note that trimming will 
have little effect if the input capacitance of the scope is outside the compensation 
range of the probe. 
Now that you have some probe theory behind you, let’s take a look at some real 
probes.
Passive Probes
Practically speaking, the most common probe used for general-purpose testing is 
a passive probe built for 1-MΩ input scopes. These passive probes are constructed 
of wires, connectors, and, when needed, compensation or attenuation resistors and 
capacitors. There are no active components within these probes, such as transistors or 
amplifiers, and thus they are quite rugged, relatively cheap, and easy to use. 
Passive voltage probes come in 1X, 10X, 100X, and 1000X forms, presenting no 
attenuation (1X), 10 times the attenuation (10X), 100 times the attenuation (100X), or 
1000 times the attenuation (1000X). The attenuating probes act to multiply the mea-
surement range of the scope by using an internal resistance that, when taken with 
the input resistance of the scope, creates a voltage divider. For example, a typical 
10X probe used with a 1-MΩ scope houses an internal 9-MΩ resistor that creates a 
10:1 attenuation ratio at the input channel. This means the displayed signal will be 
one-tenth the magnitude of the measured signal. This allows you to test a signal that 
might otherwise overload the scope circuits. (Table 7.2 shows a schematic of a typical 
10X probe.)
A 10X probe, when compared to a 1X probe, will also cause less circuit loading, 
since it draws less current as it measures. A 10X probe has significantly larger band-
width (around 60 to 300 MHz) when compared to that of a 1X probe (around 4 to

PASSIVE PROBES
CHARACTERISTICS AND APPLICATIONS
Typical 10X passive probe
Most common probe, used to measure  
low to intermediate signals less than  
500 V. The probe tip is usually 9 MΩ, which, 
when taken with the input resistance of 
the scope, provides a 10:1 attenuation 
ratio. A compensation capacitor located 
in the termination box at the end of probe 
cable is adjusted to match input capaci-
tance of scope. It’s best suited for general 
probing and troubleshooting. The probe’s 
high input impedance is usually 1 MΩ or 
greater, and is ideal for measuring sum-
ming junctions of op amps. The trade-offs 
include relatively low bandwidth and high 
capacitive loading when compared to low-
impedance divider probes.
Typical low-impedance probe—50 Ω or Zo
Provides the lowest possible capacitance 
(<1 pF) for high-frequency signals. It exhib-
its a frequency response that is essentially 
flat through their rated frequency range. 
The tip contains a resistor, usually either 
450 or 950 Ω, to give a 10:1 or 20:1 attenu-
ation ratio. The probe cable’s character-
istic impedance is 50 Ω, which is termi-
nated with a 50-Ω scope input. Its benefits 
include low capacitive loading and very 
high bandwidth (in the gigahertz range). 
It also has a very low cost compared to 
active probes. It’s used for probing low-
voltage signals (less than 50 V), such as 
ECL circuits and 50-Ω transmission lines. 
One trade-off is relatively heavy resistive 
loading, so you must have a good under-
standing of the circuit being measured. 
The scope must also come with 50-Ω input. 
Applications include high-speed device 
characterization in microwave commu-
nications, propagation delays in logic 
circuits, circuit board impedance testing, 
and high-speed sampling.
Compensated high-resistance passive divider probe  
(high-voltage probe)
Used for safely measuring voltage signals 
over 500 V, where typical probes would 
break down. The probe to the left has a 
tip resistance of 500 MΩ. The probe cable 
used is very similar to the one that is in the 
standard compensated high-resistance 
passive divider probe. An adjustable com-
pensation capacitor at the connection end 
to the scope is used to match probe and 
scope capacitances. The divider ratio of 
the probe can be selected and has a very 
high dynamic range. Trade-offs include a 
physically larger probe and a lower band-
width compared with standard probes. 
Applications include high-voltage video 
signals, switching power supplies, and 
large power transmission signals.

34 MHz). The 10X probe introduces about ten times less capacitance. Bandwidth dif-
ferences also apply to 100X and 1000X probes.
Look for switchable 1X/10X, 10X/100X, and 100X/1000X probes that house 
two probes in one. You switch between the two modes by flipping the switch on 
the probe’s body. These probes are very convenient when jumping between signals 
of varying magnitudes. However, keep in mind that when you switch modes, your 
bandwidth will change along with the voltage scale.
Active probe
Usually comes in two varieties: FET and 
bipolar input probes. Both types contain 
an active amplifier in addition to an RC 
network. The active amplifier drives a 50-Ω 
cable that is connected to a 50-Ω input 
scope. (Note that there are some active 
probe packages designed for use with 
1-MΩ scopes.) Active probes present very 
little resistive or capacitive loading and 
have a very high bandwidth (500 MHz to 
4 GHz), making them much less intrusive 
than standard passive probes. The probe 
can be used to analyze many different 
kinds of circuits, including ECL, CMOS, and 
GaAs. You can also look at typical analog 
circuits, transmission lines, and basically 
any circuit that has a source resistance 
between 0 and 10 KW. Active probe trade-
offs include high cost, limited dynamic 
range (±40 V typical), and ESD susceptibility.
Typical active differential probes
The major difference between this type 
and the previous active probe is that the 
tip has two inputs: a positive (noninverting) 
and a negative (inverting) input. These two 
inputs feed a differential amplifier, which in 
turn drives a 50-Ω cable that is connected 
to a 50-Ω scope input. (Note that there 
are some differential probe packages that 
are designed for 1-MΩ systems.) Differen-
tial probes allow you to make accurate 
differential measurements, measurements 
between two point voltages, not just one 
point referenced to ground. The primary 
features of an active probe allow for 
adjustment of dc offset, dc reject, and cou-
pling. These probes also have high com-
mon-mode rejection (CMRR), e.g., 3000:1 
at 1 MHz. This allows for accurate viewing 
of small signals in the presence of large 
dc offsets or other common-mode signals. 
These probes are used for measuring dif-
ferential amplifiers, troubleshooting power 
supplies, and testing other differential 
sources. They tend to be more expensive 
than passive probes, have less dynamic 
range, and require external power and a 
control module.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    605
Also note that typical 1X and 10X probes have a maximum voltage rating of 
around 400 to 500 V. The 100X and 1000X probes fare better at around 1.4 kV and 
20 kV, respectively. For high-voltage work extending up to 20 kV, get a specially 
designed high-voltage passive probe.
FIGURE 7.58  (a) General-purpose 1X/10X passive probe with assortment of probe attachments designed for use with 
a 1-MW, 20-pF scope. At 1X, there is no attenuation, but the bandwidth is limited to between 4 and 34 MHz. At 10X, 
signals are reduced to one-tenth their original magnitude, while the bandwidth increases from between 60 and 300 
MHz, depending on the probe and scope. (b) Active probe used primarily for high-frequency, low-voltage work. An ac-
tive probe’s internal FET provides extremely low-input capacitance (>1 pF) that allows for high bandwidths (500 MHz 
to 6 GHz) and minimal circuit loading. The probe typically comes with a 50-W output impedance to drive a 50-W cable, 
making it possible to increase probe cable length. It may require a special scope with a power connector/signal con-
nector, or an external power source. A limited voltage range of ±40 V is typical. (c) Differential probe houses an internal 
differential amplifier that allows you to make differential measurements (between any two points, not just between 
one point and ground). Differential probes come in 50-W and 1-MW packages, and may require a special scope with a 
power connector/signal connector or an external power source. (d) High-voltage probe used for heavy-duty measure-
ments of voltages over 2.5 kV. The P6015A from Tektronix can measure dc voltages up to 20 kV (RMS) and pulses up to 
40 kV. It comes with a bandwidth of 75 MHz. Other high-voltage probes, often termed 100X, 1000X, will provide vary-
ing maximum voltage and bandwidth limits.
Let’s not forget 50-Ω passive probes and 50-Ω scopes. Probes used with 50-Ω scopes 
are often referred to as ZO probes. The ZO refers to the characteristic impedance of a 
cable, which in this case is 50 Ω for the coaxial probe cable. These probes offer much 
higher bandwidth than the best 1-MΩ probes, approaching the gigahertz range, with 
rise times of 100 picoseconds or faster. Fifty-ohm systems are used primarily for high-
speed circuits.

606    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Active Probes
For extremely fast (>500 MHz) or high-impedance circuits, passive probes (even 10X) 
used with 1-MΩ scopes may not cut it. They can cause severe circuit loading, as 
well as attenuation and timing degradation. A better probe for high-speed work is an 
active probe. Active probes house internal FETs or other active devices that present an 
extremely high input resistance and low input capacitance (1 pF or so) to the input 
signal. With external power, the active devices amplify the signal without drawing 
power from the circuit being tested.
Active probe bandwidths range from 500 MHz to 4 GHz. An FET probe usually 
has a 50-Ω output impedance and drives a 50-Ω cable, though specially designed 
active probes with external boxed circuitry are made for 1-MΩ scopes. This allows 
the distance from the probe tip to the instrument to be increased within the prac-
tical limits of the probe amplifier system and the limitations of the coaxial cable. 
Another benefit to using active probes is that the length of the ground lead isn’t as 
critical as it was with passive probes due to the probe’s low input capacitance that 
reduces ground lead effects. One shortcoming of active probes is their limited voltage 
range—typically from ±0.6 to ±10 V—and their maximum voltage rating of ±40 V.
Differential Probes
Another useful probe is a differential probe, which measures differential signals—
potential differences between any two points, not just between one point and earth 
ground. You would use a differential probe for, say, measuring the signal developed 
across a collector load resistor or any other situation where signals are, in essence, 
“floating” above ground. 
Although it’s possible to make a differential measurement in an indirect manner 
using two standard passive probes (you measure the two points using two separate 
probes and scope channels, each of which is referenced to ground, then select the 
scope’s subtract math function—channel A minus channel B—to get the differential 
measurement), this approach doesn’t work well at high frequencies or for small sig-
nals approaching noise levels. The main problem with this approach is the two sepa-
rate paths down each probe and through each scope channel. Any delay differences 
between these paths result in time skewing of the two signals. On high-speed signals, 
this skew can result in significant amplitude and timing errors in the computed dif-
ference signal. 
Another problem is that the probes don’t provide adequate common-mode noise 
rejection. A differential probe, on the other hand, uses a differential amplifier to sub-
tract the two signals, resulting in one differential signal for measurements by one 
channel of the scope. This provides substantially higher common-mode rejection per-
formance over a broader frequency range. In modern differential probes, bandwidths 
of 1 GHz, with common-mode rejection ratios ranging from 60 dB at 1 MHz to 30 dB 
at 1 GHz, are typical.
Current Probes
One last probe for oscilloscopes worth mentioning is a current probe. A current probe 
provides a noninvasive way to measure current flow through a conductor. Two types 
of current probes are available: the traditional ac-only probes and the Hall effect 
semiconductor probes. The ac-only probes use a transformer to convert current flux 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    607
into ac voltage signals that are monitored by the scope. These probes usually have a 
frequency response of a few hundred hertz to a gigahertz. By combining a Hall effect 
device with an ac transformer, you get a probe whose response is from dc to around 
50 MHz. The key reason for using current probes is their noninvasive nature; the 
current probe typically imposes less loading than other probe types. You would use 
them for measurements that would otherwise be unsafe or disruptive to the circuit’s 
performance when gathered by other testing means.
Probe Suggestions
Here are a few suggestions for working with probes:
Compensate your probes: Most probes are designed to match the input characteris-
tics of specific oscilloscope models. There are, however, slight input variations 
from scope to scope and even between different input channels of the same scope. 
To deal with these variations, most probes, especially attenuating probes (10X 
and 100X) have built-in compensation networks. If your probe does, you should 
adjust this network to compensate the probe for the scope channel that you are 
using. Do this by attaching the probe to the scope, and then attach the probe tip to 
the probe compensation test point on the scope’s front panel, which gives you a 
1- to 10-kHz squarewave. Use the adjustment tool provided with the probe or any 
nonmagnetic screwdriver to adjust the compensation network to obtain a calibra-
tion waveform display that has flat tops with no overshoot or rounding. If the 
scope has a built-in calibration routine, run this routine for increased accuracy. An 
uncompensated probe can lead to various measurement errors, especially when 
measuring pulse rise or fall times. Check compensation frequently—whenever 
you change scope channels or whenever you change probe tip adapters.
Use appropriate probe tip adapters: Avoid using short lengths of wire soldered to cir-
cuit points as a substitute for a probe. Even an inch of wire can cause significant 
impedance changes at high frequencies.
Keep ground leads short: For passive probes, longer probe ground leads introduce 
significant inductance that will result in ringing and signal distortion. Do not 
attempt to lengthen a probe ground lead.
7.5.7  General- Purpose Function Generator
Get a general-purpose function generator capable of producing sine, square, and 
triangle waveforms. Make sure it comes with a decent upper frequency limit (pref-
erably upward of 5 MHz) and a decent voltage range. Some function generators 
also come with ramp, pulse, variable symmetry, counted bursts, gate, linear/log-
arithmic sweeps, AM, FM, VCO, dc offset, phase lock, and external modulation 
inputs—all of which are nice to have, but not entirely necessary. As with oscillo-
scopes, the cost of a function generator will increase with bandwidth. Figure 7.59 
shows typical function generators that you can find, used, on eBay and other used 
equipment sites.
For a very low-cost (possibly zero-cost) function generator in the audio range, try 
downloading a function generator app for your smartphone. There are several free apps 
for both iPhone and Android. You will need a headphone plug with test leads attached. 
These apps will generally allow you to set a frequency of 50 Hz to 20 KHz and select 

608    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
the usual waveform shapes. You will need to use one channel of your scope to measure 
the somewhat arbitrary and frequency-dependent amplitude of the waveform. This 
approach is obviously quite limited, but it is good enough in some circumstances.
7.5.8  Frequency Counter
For accurate high-speed frequency measurements, such as measuring a crystal’s oper-
ating frequency in a digital or an RF circuit, get a frequency counter. Oscilloscopes 
are simply too inaccurate (5 percent error or more) for such tasks. A counter with a 
bandwidth from 0 to 250 MHz isn’t so expensive—around $100 to $300.
Some multimeters have a frequency counter feature, but the maximum frequency 
is often quite low.
FIGURE 7.59  Left: Leader LFG-1300S, 2-MHz function generator with simple controls and many waveforms to select 
from, including amplitude modulation and linear/log sweep. Found for around $60, used, on eBay. Middle: HP 3312A func-
tion generator with a 0.1-Hz to 13-MHz bandwidth, providing sine, square, triangle, ramp, or variable symmetry pulses. 
Also has internal AM, FM, sweep, trigger, gate, or burst capability, along with external AM, FM, sweep, trigger, and gate 
capability. A great little instrument if you can find one for under $150. Right: Agilent 33120A 15-MHz function/arbitrary 
waveform generator, a high-performance signal source that provides sine, square, or triangular waveform signals over its 
0.1- to 15-MHz frequency range. This instrument also provides a continuously variable dc offset and variable duty cycle, 
and the clock signal voltage levels adjusted to TTL components. It comes with both HPIB and RS-232 interfaces. Expect to 
pay around $500 for a used one.
FIGURE 7.60  A selection of used frequency counters. Left: Tektronix CFC-250, dc to 100-MHz counter found new in the 
box for $95. Center: HP 5385A, 10-Hz to 1-GHz counter with eight-digit display, which comes with two input channels—
found for around $200, used, on eBay. Right: HP 5342A, 10-Hz to 18-GHz counter with 12-digit display—expensive.
7.5.9  Computer
It’s a good idea to have a separate computer dedicated for your laboratory. An old 
one will usually work fine.
You’ll probably use your laboratory computer most often for viewing manufac-
turer’s component specs, circuit diagrams, electronics online catalogs, and the like. 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    609
With the Internet, you can grab a complex IC while at your bench and get a complete 
data sheet with spec and pin assignments from your computer as you prototype—
just enter the part number into your favorite search engine. Professional component 
suppliers Farnell, RS Components, Mouser, Digi-Key, and Newark have links to the 
data sheets of most of the parts they sell, so even if you do not buy from them, this 
access is a very useful resource.
Of course, you’ll also use your computer to program microcontrollers. Again, 
having Internet access is important for downloading other people’s microcontroller 
source codes, microcontroller editor programs, and program updates.
Having circuit simulator and PCB layout programs on your computer is also 
handy. (See Sec. 7.5.22 for more on electronics CAD software.)
If you intend to install plug-in test equipment, make sure your computer comes 
with the appropriate number of expansion slots and ports. You’ll need a decent com-
puter to run sophisticated plug-in test software.
7.5.10  Miscellaneous Test Equipment
The amount of test equipment for electronics is extensive, and we’ve covered only 
the standard items so far. Other items include LCR meters, impedance analyzers, 
logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers, modulation analyzers, cable testers, power 
meters, network analyzers, and various specialized telecommunication equipment, 
to name a few. Fortunately, most of these items are not necessary for most hobby-type 
experimentation. If you’re dealing with modulation analysis and spectrum analysis, 
chances are you’re working or studying at an institution that has the necessary equip-
ment; there’s no need to shell out huge bucks for something you can borrow.
FIGURE 7.61  (a) BK-Precision LCR/ESR meter for measuring impedance (Z), inductance (L), capacitance (C), DCR, ESR, 
D, Q, and £, with wide range of test frequencies up to 100 kHz. Comes with four-wire testing that reduces error due to lead 
length. Used for spot frequency testing at various frequencies. (b) Agilent 4263B LCR meter capable of measuring more 
parameters (|Z|, |Y|, q, R, X, G, B, C, L, D, Q), with greater precision than the preceding meter. (c) Agilent impedance 
analyzer, unlike an LCR meter, can do continuous frequency sweeps and provide graphic analysis. Used to measure im-
pedance and even capable of measuring material permitivity and permeability. Measures parameters such as |Z|, |Y|, q, 
R, X, G, B, L, C, D, and Q from a range of 40 Hz to 110 MHz. Extremely small variations in component characteristics can be 
precisely evaluated with sweep measurements of 0.08 percent accuracy. Good instrument for evaluation of capacitors, in-
ductors, resonators, semiconductors, and other materials such as PCBs and toroidal cores. (d) Rohde & Schwartz spectrum 
analyzer that measures the frequency spectrum of a signal (signal amplitude versus frequency). Spectrum analyzers are 
used over a range of frequencies and may have different names, depending on their application. Used primarily for study-
ing noise levels, dynamic range, frequency range, and transmitting power levels when troubleshooting radio equipment.

7.5.11  Multifunction PC Instruments
Multifunction PC instruments, both expensive and reasonably priced, are growing in 
popularity. One in particular that caught our eye is the TINALab II by DesignSoft. In 
conjunction with TINAPro circuit simulator software (also by DesignSoft), the little 
TINALab II box (see Fig. 7.62) acts as a multimeter (optional), oscilloscope, logic ana-
lyzer, signal analyzer, signal/function generator, and spectrum analyzer—all in one. 
The box is connected to your laptop or desktop using a USB or RS232 interface. In 
TINAPro, with a click of the mouse, you can jump between different screens repre-
senting different test instrument panels and test plots.
Perhaps the most intriguing feature of DesignSoft’s package is the ability for 
TINAPro to act as both a simulator and a real-life tester at the same time. For exam-
ple, if you’re designing an amplifier circuit, using an op amp, a few capacitors, and 
resistors, you can first create a model of the amplifier in TINAPro and run a simu-
lation, using the simulator’s virtual instruments (virtual oscilloscope, virtual Bode 
plotter, and so on) to display the circuit’s behavior. Next, using a prototype board 
and discrete components, you can build the real-life circuit, and then test it using the 
TINALab II interface. Results of the simulation and real-time test results measured by 
TINALab II can be displayed next to each other on the same screen. If something is 
wrong with either the simulation or the real circuit, you can alter the circuit schematic 
and see if the simulation works, and then go to the real circuit, make the same altera-
tion, and see if it works. This is not only a great troubleshooting tool, but also a nice 
visual, hands-on way to learn electronics.
FIGURE 7.62  TINALab II from DesignSoft acts as a multifunction PC test instrument. Comes with digital oscilloscope, 
multimeter (optional), logic analyzer, signal analyzer, signal generator, and spectrum analyzer. Requires TINAPro circuit 
simulation software.
Here’s a rundown of TINALab II’s features:
Digital oscilloscope: Two-channel, 50-MHz bandwidth, 10/12-bit resolution, 4 GS/s 
equivalent sample rate on repetitive signals, and 20 MS/s for single-shot mode. 
Full-scale input range is ±400 V, with 5-mV/div to 100-V/div ranges.
Multimeter (optional): DC/AC from 1 mV to 400 V, and 100 µA to 2 A, with dc resis-
tance from 1 Ω to 10 MΩ.
Function generator: Synthesized sine, square, ramp, triangle, and arbitrary wave-
forms from dc to 4 MHz, with logarithmic and linear sweep, and modulation up to  
10 V peak to peak. Arbitrary waveforms can be programmed via the high-level 
language of TINAPro’s interpreter.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    611
Signal analyzer: Works in conjunction with the function generator, and measures 
and displays Bode amplitude and phase diagrams and Nyquist diagrams. It also 
works as a spectrum analyzer.
Logic generator and logic analyzer: Separate 16-channel digital inputs and outputs for 
generating or testing digital signals up to 40 MHz.
Other: Power supplies (±5 V, ±15 V), test card slot for plugging in experimenter 
modules.
TINALab II costs about $1,700, and the TINAPro simulator program is around 
$300 for the classic version and around $600 for the industrial version. This is a 
decent utility, considering all the instruments and software you get in a small pack-
age. However, be aware of certain limitations, such as bandwidth, that could lead 
to problems later on. For more information, check out DesignSoft’s website at  
www.tina.com.
7.5.12  Isolation Transformers
If you plan to do work on line-power circuits such as TVs or switch-mode power sup-
plies, or any line-power circuits that have no input isolation (no input transformer) 
and have a “floating ground” at a potential other than earth ground, use an isolation 
transformer between the line power and the circuit being tested. Attempting any 
repairs or simply sticking an oscilloscope’s ground lead into such circuits without 
using an isolation transformer can lead to nasty shocks, blown circuit components, 
and melted test equipment probe tips.
FIGURE 7.63  Basic schematic of a mains isolation transformer used to isolate the load from the source, as well as provide 
ground fault protection. An isolation transformer should be used whenever you work on nongrounded equipment with 
no input isolation, such as switch-mode power supplies. Notice that the voltage difference from secondary winding leads 
to earth ground is 0 V, unlike the 120-V difference in the primary side from hot to earth ground.
Figure 7.63 shows a simple mains isolation transformer. Isolation transformers are 
1:1, meaning that the windings of the primary and secondary are equal in number 
so there is no increase or decrease in current or voltage between the primary and the 
secondary. The transformer is designed to isolate the load from the source and pro-
vide ground fault protection.

612    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In your home wiring, the neutral (white) and the ground (green) connections are 
tied together at the main junction box, so they are basically at the same potential: 0 
V, or earth ground. If you accidentally touch the hot wire while being in contact with 
a grounded object, current will pass through your body and give you a potentially 
fatal shock. 
With an isolation transformer, the secondary winding leads act as a 120-V source 
and return, similar to the mains’ hot and neutral, but with an important difference. 
Neither the secondary source nor the return runs are tied to earth ground! This 
means that if you touch the secondary source or return while being in contact with a 
grounded object, no current will flow through your body. Current wants to pass only 
between the secondary source and the return runs. Note that all transformers pro-
vide isolation, not just line isolation transformers. Therefore, equipment with input 
power transformers already has basic isolation protection built in. Figure 7.64 shows 
a simple way to construct an isolation transformer using two standard 120-V/12-V 
transformers, back to back.
Isolation transformers are also typically constructed with two isolated Faraday 
shields between the primary and the secondary windings. The use of the two shields 
diverts high-frequency noise, which would normally be coupled across the trans-
former to ground. Increasing the separation between the two Faraday shields mini-
mizes the capacitance between the two and hence the coupling of noise between the 
two. Therefore, the isolation transformer acts to clean up line-power noise before 
being delivered to a circuit.
When do you need an isolation transformer? Well, for instance, within some TV 
sets, the inside cases are about 80 to 90 V above earth ground. If you open up a set 
and start fiddling around, you are liable to receive a nasty shock, since the test equip-
ment and yourself are at a ground (earth ground) that is 90 V below the TV’s internal 
ground. If you connect a scope to your TV’s ground, you create a ground loop, which 
is bad. In an older TV, there is no provision to protect its circuit from this kind of 
short.
Likewise, switch-mode power supplies all require the use of isolation transform-
ers when servicing. For example, a basic switch-mode power supply, like the one 
shown in Fig. 7.64, has a hot side and a cold side. There is an extreme shock hazard 
on the hot side of any switch-mode supply. Also, there is usually a diode bridge on 
the input. This means that the negative side of the filter capacitor is always one diode 
drop removed from the hot side of the ac power line. If you were to connect a scope 
ground to the “floating ground” side (point A) of the filter capacitor, you would blow 
out at least one of the bridge diodes, regardless of whether a fuse is incorporated 
into the design. The bridge diode will typically break down first, since connecting 
the ground lead of the scope places the full line voltage directly across the diode. In 
addition, you’ll probably vaporize the scope probe lead, burn yourself, and receive a 
potentially lethal shock.
Isolation transformers are specified in terms of the amount of isolation they 
can provide, given as the RMS voltage, and by their power ratings, given in volt-
amperes (VA). Additional specifications include efficiency and tolerance of voltage 
regulation. Typically, a 200-VA isolation transformer is sufficient for most modern 
equipment.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    613
Be extremely careful when dealing with ungrounded equipment. Always use an 
isolation transformer, and be extremely careful where you place your scope’s ground 
lead. Do not attempt repairs unless you have a decent scope, total safety isolation, 
and accurate service information. Again, remember that any misplaced scope ground 
lead can instantly ruin a line-operated switch-mode supply. Always use an isolation 
transformer, and think before you connect and measure.
7.5.13  Variable Transformers, or Variacs
A variable transformer, or Variac, is a very useful device that acts like an adjustable 
ac voltage source. Its construction is that of an autotransformer, whose primary is 
connected to the hot and neutral of the 120-V line voltage, while the secondary leads 
consist of the neutral and an adjustable wiper that moves along the single core wind-
ing (see Fig. 7.65). Make sure the neutral is the common lead taken at the output. 
Don’t use the hot lead; otherwise, the whole apparatus may be raised to live potential 
with respect to ground. 
Being able to adjust the line voltage is a very useful trick when troubleshooting 
line-power equipment, where the fuse instantly blows at normal line voltage. Even 
without a fuse blowing, troubleshooting at around 85 V may reduce the fault current. 
Also, gradually increasing the voltage supplied to recently repaired equipment, such 
as a monitor, is a good way to ensure there are no problems; you can monitor the 
exact point where failure occurs.
Be aware that a Variac by itself does not provide isolation protection like a stan-
dard or isolation transformer, since the primary and secondary share a common 
winding. Therefore, if you plan to do work on ungrounded, “hot chassis” equipment, 
like that mentioned in the previous section, you must place an isolation transformer 
before the Variac, never after. If you don’t, shock hazards await. Figure 7.65c shows a 
schematic of such an arrangement. It includes a switch and fuse protection, as well as 
FIGURE 7.64  The illustration on the left shows how a switch-mode supply can be dangerous. Without the use of an isola-
tion transformer, a ground lead of a scope connected to point A will blow out one of the bridge diodes, while vaporizing 
the scope probe tip. The illustration on the right shows how to construct a simple isolation transformer using two standard 
120-V/12-V transformers, back to back.

614    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
current and voltage meters, all of which create an adjustable, fully isolated ac power 
source. A 2-A Variac should suffice for most applications, although a 5-A or larger 
model isn’t bad.
To avoid the hassle of cascading a Variac and isolation transformer together, sim-
ply get an ac power supply that houses both elements in one package. B+K Precision’s 
1653A ac power supply, for example, has a 0- to 150-V ac, 2-A Variac, an isolation 
transformer, and a current/voltage meter, all in one package. Similar ac power sup-
plies can be found on eBay for around $50 (see Fig. 7.65d).
7.5.14  Substitution Boxes
Resistance, capacitance, inductance, and RC substitution boxes are nice to have 
around when you are trying to find the best resistance, capacitance, inductance, or 
RC circuit values needed within a circuit. Figure 7.66 shows a variety of commercial 
R, C, L, and RC-combination substitution boxes from IET Labs, Inc. (www.ietlabs 
.com). To select the desired resistance, capacitance, or inductance, simply dial in the 
value using the labeled thumbwheel switches. Voltage-divider substitution boxes are 
FIGURE 7.65  (a) Nonisolated 120-V Variac whose output voltage is varied by rotating a wiper. (b) Nonisolated 240-V 
Variac. (c) A homemade variable ac supply with isolation protection provided by means of an isolation transformer. (d) ac 
power supply that houses an isolation transformer, Variac, switch, fuse, ac outlet, and meter.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    615
also available and can be extremely handy when determining the best voltage divider 
network for a given prototype. Substitution boxes aren’t cheap, but the convenience 
and accuracy they provide is often well worth the cost.
Figure 7.67 shows a circuit diagram of a typical 0 to 9,999,999-Ω decade resistance 
box with 1-Ω resolution. Each wheel represents a decade, or a multiple of 10. Each 
resistor within a given wheel is of the same value—1, 10, 100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M, and 
so on—depending on the wheel it happens to be in. To select a desired resistance, you 
turn each switch to the appropriate position, thus placing resistors in series. 
One-half-watt metal film resistors are a good choice for the resistors within the 
box. If you wish to create a decade box with a 1⁄10-ohm range, the resistors of the 1⁄10 
place wheel should be of a wirewound variety or made of resistive wire. Be aware, 
however, that wirewound resistors are coiled like an inductor, so they can create 
inductive effects that can mess up the operation of some high-frequency circuits.
FIGURE 7.66  Selection of resistance, capacitance, inductance, and RC boxes from IET Labs, Inc. Resistance boxes come 
in seven- (0 to 9,999,999 W, 1-W resolution) and nine- (0 to 99,999,999.9 W, 0.1-W resolution) decade types. Capacitance boxes 
come in six (0 to 99.9999 mF, 100-pF resolution) decade types. Inductance boxes come in three (999 mH, 1-mH resolution) 
and four (9.999 mH, 1-mH resolution) decade types. RC boxes come with mixed decade selections given in provision R 
and C boxes. Uses thumbwheel switches to dial in resistance, capacitance, and inductance values. Accuracy is typically 
1 percent or better.
FIGURE 7.67  Resistor decade box made using thumbwheel switches.
Although making a resistance decade box is feasible, trying to put together a 
capacitance, inductance, or RC decade box isn’t worth the effort; the low-tolerance 

616    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
components are too expensive, while the construction process is messy and time-
consuming. It’s better to simply buy a custom box from the manufacturer. However, 
you can still put together some simple substitution boxes, like the RC boxes in 
Fig. 7.68, without too much work. Though they aren’t decade boxes—they can’t dial 
in any possible component value—they can provide an adequate range or at least 
provide values that coincide with popular standard component values (10, 22, 33, 47, 
56, 68, 82, and so on) that you find in the component catalogs.

10 to 150 pF (or whatever is suitable) and a 10-kW, one-turn potentiometer. Right: Custom RC substitution box that can be 
switched to various modes: resistance-only, capacitance-only, RC-series, and RC-parallel.
For example, a simple low-capacitance series RC substitution box, shown to the 
left in Fig. 7.68, is made with a plastic-film-dielectric tuning capacitor of 10 to 150 pF 
(or whatever is suitable) and a 10-kΩ, one-turn potentiometer. Another custom RC 
substitution box that can be switched to various modes (resistive-only, capacitance-
only, RC-series, and RC-parallel) is shown to the right in Fig. 7.68. 
The selection of component values is up to you. Here, component values were 
chosen to coincide with popular component values produced by manufacturers. 
Eighteen-position rotary switches can be used to select R and C values. A typical 
selection of capacitor types is 100- to 900-pF mica, 0.001 to 0.009 µF in polystyrene, 
0.01- to 0.9-µF polycarbonate, 1- to 9-µF polyester, and 10-µF and up tantalum or elec-
trolytic (be careful to maintain the proper polarity across polarized capacitors). Often, 
for high-precision, low-capacitance values, air-dielectric tuning capacitors are used. 
One-half-watt, 1 percent metal film resistors provide good tolerance for all resistances 
above 1 Ω. Below 1 Ω, wirewound resistors or resistive wire can be used, though, 
again, be aware of inductive effects of wirewound resistors at high frequencies.
7.5.15  Test Cables, Connectors, and Adapters
Make sure you have a variety of test cables, connectors, and adapters at your dis-
posal. This includes BNC, banana, hook, alligator, 0.100 male headers and 0.156 sock-
ets, phone, RCA, and F. You never know what kind of connector will be needed when 
you start troubleshooting some new circuit or piece of equipment.

7.5.16  Soldering Equipment
Soldering Iron
For most electronics work, a low-wattage, pencil-shaped soldering iron, from 25 to 
40 W, will work fine. For very small components and pads, you may need to go to a 
15-W iron. Very large connections may require a 50-W iron.
Adjustable temperature-controlled irons with digital displays are best, but this 
doesn’t mean you can’t get good results from $10 fixed-temperature irons with the 
proper tip wattage. Large irons and solder guns should not be used on any electronic 
assemblies or PCBs. Use them only on very large joints, such as between a large 
stranded wire (14-gauge or larger) and an aluminum chassis. 
Figure 7.71 shows plans for building a soldering iron with low standby power, 
as well as plans for building a temperature-adjustable soldering iron using a fixed-
temperature soldering iron.
FIGURE 7.70  Various soldering items: temperature-controlled soldering iron with digital display of tip temperature, roll 
of 60/40 rosin-core solder wire, solder pump, PanaVise Electronic Work Center for holding circuit boards while soldering.
In terms of tip size and shape, make sure to get an iron tip that is big enough for the 
job. The tip of the soldering iron should be small enough so that the joint being soldered 
can be seen easily, but should be large enough to quickly transfer the heat required to 
increase the joint temperature past the solder melting point. A chisel (spade) tip that 
is between 0.05 in. and 0.08 in. across the spade is ideal for general-purpose work. 
Smaller tips are required for small pads and surface-mount components.
Make sure your iron is powerful enough and hot enough. An iron that hasn’t 
reached full temperature or that is set at too low a temperature can easily delaminate 
a trace or pad and can also fry components. This occurs due to overheating—a result 
of needing to apply heat for too long a duration to get the solder to melt.
Also, make sure you know whether your iron’s tip is grounded (ESD-safe) or 
floating. In certain situations, a grounded soldering iron is required (for example, 
when soldering static-sensitive devices).
Solder and Fluxes
The solder types most commonly used for electrical connections are 60/40 (SN60) 
and 63/37 (SN63) solder. The terms 60/40 and 63/37 specify the alloy content: 
60 percent tin/40 percent lead and 63 percent tin/37 percent lead, respectively. Other 
solders may come with different percentages and metals, such as 62/36/2 (62 percent 
tin/36 percent lead/2 percent silver). The melting point for 60/40 and 63/37 solder 

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    619
is 361°F. The 63/37 solder is excellent for small, heat-sensitive components and PCB 
pads; 60/40 is reserved more for general-purpose work. Both 60/40 and 63/37 solder 
come with either a rosin flux core or a solid (without flux) core. Rosin flux core solder 
is usually the preferred choice for electronics.
If you plan to use solid core solder, you’ll need some flux paste or flux liquid. The flux 
paste or liquid must be applied to the metal surfaces to be joined before soldering takes 
place. When the soldering iron is placed on the flux-coated surfaces and heated, the flux 
will act as a chemical cleaner, removing oxidation from the metal surfaces and ensuring a 
good conductive solder joint. After soldering is complete, the remaining sticky flux resi-
due should be removed with a defluxer (sometimes isopropyl alcohol is used, or even 
water, if the flux core is water-soluble). This prevents dirt from collecting in left-behind 
flux residue—something that can create low-resistance pathways between PCB pads.
When using flux core solder, the inner flux core seeps out while the outer alloy 
coating is melted. Generally, when using flux core solder, no additional flux is 
required. However, before soldering takes place, the surfaces to be soldered should 
not be visibly oxidized. Fine-grade steel wool or sandpaper can be used to polish the 
surfaces prior to soldering.
As a final note in regard to solder fluxes, never use corrosive (acid core) or con-
ductive fluxes to solder electronic components. Use only mild fluxes such as those 
contained in rosin core solder or rosin flux.
Solder wire comes in a variety of wire diameters. The following list describes 
standard diameters and their intended uses.
0.020/0.508 mm (25 gauge) or smaller: This is excellent for soldering very small PCB 
pads and hand-soldering surface-mount components. However, it is too small for 
use as a general-purpose bench solder. It takes excessive heating time to apply 
sufficient solder to larger joints.
0.031/0.79 mm (21 gauge): This is excellent all-around solder for PCBs and general 
building and electronic repair.
0.040/1 mm (19 gauge) or larger: This is good for larger connections like tinning or con-
necting 14-gauge or larger wires to terminal strips, and soldering large stranded 
wires and other large components to aluminum chassis. It is not good for PCB 
soldering because excessive solder can be easily applied to pads, increasing the 
potential for undesired solder bridges between points.
When soldering traditional lead solder, your iron should be set to a temperature 
of around 330°C (625°F). Lead-free solders will require a higher temperature to melt 
well, typically around 400°C (750°F). If a joint is proving difficult to solder and will 
not flow, then a flux pen can be useful to get the solder flowing.
Solder-Removing Tools
To free components or clean up unwanted solder spillover, make sure you have a 
desoldering tool you’re comfortable using. Here is an overview of the various tools 
that are available:
Desoldering pump (solder sucker): The tool is applied to the joint that has been heated 
to the solder’s melting point. A plunger is activated, which sucks the solder into 
the tool’s reservoir. If done properly, this method can remove solder to the point 
that the component leads can be lifted away from the metal to which they were 

620    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
joined. You may need an antistatic solder sucker when dealing with static-sensi-
tive components; an ordinary solder sucker can generate high voltages as a result 
of internal friction. If you can’t get everything with the sucker, try cleaning up the 
fine stuff using a desoldering braid.
Desoldering braid (solder wick): This consists of a copper braid impregnated with non-
corrosive flux. The braid is laid on top of the solder joint to be desoldered, and 
the hot soldering tip is applied to the braid. As a result of capillary action, solder 
will flow toward the heat of the tip and away from the joint. This is used mainly 
if the joint doesn’t have too much solder and when dealing with narrow PC traces 
where a sucker may cause problems, or in static-sensitive situations where a non-
static sucker isn’t available. It’s a good choice for cleaning out solder holes in PCBs, 
as well as removing small solder splatters and solder bridges between IC leads.
Desoldering irons: If you anticipate the need, desoldering irons with attached vacuum 
suckers can really speed things up. The iron melts the solder, and then the vacuum 
is energized and sucks the molten solder into a reservoir for disposal. Desoldering 
irons are fairly expensive devices, but they are convenient.
Your soldering station should also have a damp sponge to keep your soldering 
tip free from excess solder and contamination. Special solder tip cleaning pastes also 
exist, and they do a decent job of removing oxidized material from the iron’s tip. 
A wire brush, a file, and steel wool are nice to have around for removing built-up 
oxidation that may coat the solder tip. However, be sure to “tin” the tip immediately 
afterward by melting solder with it, then brushing off the excess with a soft cloth to 
form a smooth, silvery soldering surface; otherwise, the tip will oxidize.
FIGURE 7.71  Soldering iron 
tips and heating elements 
will last longer if operated 
at reduced temperature. The 
circuit shown in (a) accom-
plishes this by half-wave 
rectification of the applied 
ac cycle. With current flow-
ing in only one direction, 
only one electrode of the 
neon bulb glows. By clos-
ing the switch, the diode is 
effectively 
short-circuited 
and full power is applied 
to the soldering iron, ignit-
ing both bulb electrodes 
brightly. For safety, the 
circuit should be enclosed 
in an aluminum chassis. 
A 30- to 40-W soldering 
iron works well. A square 
metal tray can be used to 
hold a sponge. Use machine 
screws and nuts to secure 
the iron holder. A sealer 
must be used around holes in the sponge tray to prevent moisture from leaking into the electrical components. A 3/16 ID 
grommet can be used to install the neon bulb. Heat shrink is used to insulate its leads.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    621
A temperature control gives greater flexibility than the simple control just 
described. An incandescent-light dimmer can be used to control the working tem-
perature of the tip. (b) shows a temperature control built into an electrical box. A 
dimmer and a duplex outlet are mounted in the box, as shown in the wiring dia-
gram. The dimmer controls only one of two ac outlets. Normally, a jumper on the 
duplex outlet connects the hot terminals of both outlets together. This jumper must 
be removed. The hot terminal is narrower than the neutral one and typically uses a 
brass connecting screw. The neutral terminal remains interconnected. The dimmer 
can be purchased at any hardware or electrical store.
7.5.17  Prototyping Boards
Solderless Breadboards
Get a large solderless breadboard with plenty of rows and columns, IC channels, 
and power buses, along with banana terminals for external power supply con-
nections. You’ll find additional breadboards and socket-and-bus strips helpful as 
well. Breadboards will accept component lead diameters from 0.3 to 0.8 mm (20 to 
30 AWG).
A note of caution: solderless breadboards are not good for building high-frequency 
RF circuits. The spring-loaded metal strips inside the board add too much stray 
capacitance to the circuit. Also, breadboards should not be used for high-current 
circuits above 100 mA or so.
Design Labs or Project Boards
Design labs or project boards are worth checking out, especially if you’re into experi-
menting. Along with a large breadboard, these devices usually have a built-in power 
supply (fixed and variable) and function generator, as well as on-board components 
such as potentiometers, switches, LED indicators, and speakers. Though some indi-
viduals may shy away from such labs because of their “amateur appeal,” they are, in 
fact, very convenient and practical—you avoid a lot of repetitive wiring, while keep-
ing your work area in order.
FIGURE 7.72  Left: Typical design lab. Center: Solderless breadboard. Right: Various perforated boards.

622    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Prototype PCBs
Following are various types of PCBs:
Blank copper-plated boards: It’s nice to have both single- and double-sided clad boards. 
These are useful in ground-plane construction, where the circuit is built on the 
unetched side of the board, and wherever a component connects to ground, its 
lead is soldered to the copper board. Ungrounded connections between compo-
nents are made point to point.
Bare perforated construction boards: These are phenolic or fiberglass circuit boards with 
perforations every 0.1-in., allowing common electronic devices to be mounted. 
These boards have no pads or buses, and are good for making “quick-and-dirty” 
circuits by bending the leads underneath the board and tacking them with solder. 
Large boards can be cut to any size desired.
Perforated boards with pads and buses: There are a variety to choose from, with varying 
pad and bus geometries, such as pad-per-hole, buses only, three-hole solder pads, 
ground plane, and volt/ground planes. A wide variety is nice to stock, but you 
can choose according to your needs.
PCB kit: These are designed for making your own custom PCBs. You can pick up a kit 
from RadioShack for $15, complete with two 3 × 41⁄2-in. copper-clad circuit boards, a 
resist-ink pen to create circuit patterns, etching and stripping solutions, an etching 
tank, and 1⁄16-in. drill bit, complete with instructions. There are more professional 
methods for making PCBs, but such kits are simple and good for small projects.
SURFBOARDS: These boards are an important breadboarding medium for surface-
mount components. They act as adapters that convert surface-mount component 
footprints to a single in-line (SIP) format with 0.100-in. centers, making them 
compatible with breadboard sockets. They are used for constructing arrays (such 
as resistor, capacitor, diode, and transistor arrays) and other surface-mount sub-
assemblies, and for evaluating surface-mount ICs.
7.5.18  Hand Tools
Wire Strippers and Cutters
First and foremost, get yourself a good set of wire strippers with built-in inner cutters, 
like those made by Ideal and GB Electronics. You’ll probably want two: one covering 
FIGURE 7.73  (a) Stripper (16–26 AWG). (b and c) Solderless crimping tools with additional features. (d) D-Sub crimping 
tool. (e) Diagonal cutter.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    623
wire gauges from 10 to 18, and another for covering 16 to 26. An additional pair of 4- or 
5-in. diagonal wire cutters or nippers is also vital for cutting wire, especially in awkward 
positions where the stripper’s cutters won’t reach.
Crimpers
It’s good to have a general-purpose solderless terminal crimping tool for connecting 
various spade terminal and butt connectors to wires. The tool should have a sepa-
rate section for insulated closure and noninsulated closure types, and a crimp gauge 
range from around 10 to 22.
You might also want to get a D-Sub crimping tool for crimping computer pin 
sockets, butted insulated connectors, telephone spade lugs, pin and socket con-
tacts, and other noninsulated connectors to wires. The gauge range should be from  
14 to 26.
There are many other special-purpose crimping tools, such as BNC, IDC, and 
modular crimping tools, which you’ll need if you plan to attach connectors to BNC 
cables, ribbon cables, and telephone or CAT5 cables. 
Other Tools
Here are some other tools that you should have:
Screwdriver set: Both Philips and standard.
Pliers set: Standard needle-nose, long-nose, and curved-nose.
Wrenches and nut driver: In a range of sizes.
Sheet metal shears, nibbling tool, and sheet metal bender: For cutting sheet metal (shears) 
or removing small pieces of metal (nibbling tool). With a bender, you can create 
your own metal enclosures.
IC remover: To get small ICs out of sockets without damaging the pins.
Tweezers: For small work, such as positioning surface-mount components.
Calipers: Used for determining component lead diameters, component sizes, board 
thickness, and so on.
Magnifying glass: For inspecting boards, wires, and components for cracks, flaws, 
hairline solder shorts, and cold-soldered joints.
X-acto knife: For general-purpose cutting.
Clip-on heat sink: Clamps on component leads to absorb or dissipate heat during sol-
dering and desoldering.
Dremel tool: With cutting, sanding, milling, and polishing attachments.
Power drill (drill press): For drilling holes in PCBs, enclosures, and so on.
Files: For enlarging holes and slots; removing burrs; shaping metal, wood, or plastic; 
and cleaning metal surfaces before soldering.
Wire-wrap tools: Only if you plan to use wire-wrap construction techniques. Get a 
proper-sized hand-wrapping tool, along with bits for your wire-wrap wires 
(30 AWG is the most common).
Vise and circuit board holder: PanaVise makes some excellent vises and board holders.
Hack saw: Used for cutting bolts and sheet and beam metal, as well as PCBs.

female crimp sockets. (e) Butt connectors, ring, spade, crimp-on quick disconnects, wire nuts. (f) Heat sinks and heat sink 
compound. (g) Nylon and aluminum standoffs, washers, bolts, rubber feet, and IC socket.
Wire and Cable
Get a selection of solid and stranded hookup wire with different color coatings and 
gauges (16, 22, and 24 gauges are sufficient for most purposes). Jumper wire used 
for solderless breadboards can be made using solid 22-AWG hookup wire or ready-
made male-to-male jumpers. If you desire flexible jumpers that won’t break as eas-
ily as solid-wire jumpers, you can use 22- or 24-AWG stranded hookup wire with 
0.156-in. female crimp pins (with optional 0.100-in. male headers soldered in). See 
Fig. 7.75 for construction details.
Other types of wire and cable worth keeping in stock include flat ribbon cable 
(28 AWG), CAT5 network cable, twisted-pair cable (24 AWG), coaxial cable (RG-59, 
RG-11, and so on), and household electrical wire, such as NM-B (indoor) or UF-B 
(outdoor). And don’t forget wire-wrap wire if you intend on doing wire-wrap circuit 
FIGURE 7.75  Making your own stranded-wire, square header jumpers, using hookup wire, female 0.156-in. crimp sock-
ets (solder a 0.100-in. male header pin into the socket for a male jumper), and 1⁄16- to 1⁄8-in. shrink tubing. A crimping tool is 
needed to fasten sockets to wire, although you might get away with using needle-nose pliers and a bit of finesse.

Chapter 7: Hands-on Electronics    625
board construction. The #30 wire with a Kynar jacket is perhaps the most popular 
type, although you might need larger wire for higher current runs.
Magnet Wire
Magnet wire (see Fig. 7.74b) is used to build custom coils and electromagnets or 
anything that requires a large number of loops, such as a tuning element in a radio 
receiver. Magnet wire is built of solid-core wire and is insulated by a varnish coating. 
A nice assortment of magnet wire ranging in gauge from 22 to 30 comes in handy.
Heat-Shrinkable Tubing
Heat-shrinkable tubing (see Fig. 7.74c) is a necessity for covering exposed wires and 
terminal connections, as well as combining a number of different wires together into 
a tight, single multiconductor cable. You can buy spools of tubing or purchase kits 
with short pieces of various color and diameter. Standard inner diameters of shrink-
able tubing before heat is applied include 3⁄64, 1⁄16, 3⁄32, 1⁄8, 3⁄16, 1⁄4, 5⁄16, 3⁄8, 1⁄2, 5⁄8, 3⁄4, 1, 2, 3, and 
4 in. A common shrink ratio is 2:1 (50 percent), so a 1⁄8-in. tube would shrink to 1⁄16 in., 
and so forth. However, you might also find shrink ratios of 3:1. A heat gun, or often 
even a hair dryer, can be used to shrink the tubes. 
Interconnects
For temporary wire-to-wire connections, wire nuts, butt connectors, and various pin-
and-socket connectors should be at hand (see Fig. 7.74d and e). Wire nuts simply 
twist wires together and enclose the connection. Butt connectors join two different 
wire ends together within a metal-insulated crimped tube. Pin-and-socket connec-
tors use various friction-fit mechanisms—male end on one wire, female end on the 
other. 
For connecting wires to more permanent structures, such as PCBs and chassis, 
a variety of connectors can be used. For PCBs, 0.100-in. male headers (straight 
or right-angle) with corresponding 0.156-in. female crimp sockets are extremely 
useful. For larger connections, PCB-mount terminal blocks or chassis terminal 
blocks with corresponding solderless terminals (what gets attached to the wire) 
are ideal. Look for solderless terminal kits that include male and female spade 
terminals, quick disconnect, and ring terminals, to accommodate various wire 
gauges.
More Hardware
Here are some additional hardware items to keep on hand (see Fig. 7.74g):
Battery holders: AAA, AA, C, D, 9-V, and coin.
Heat sinks: TO-3, TO-92, TO-202, TO-218, TO-220, and DIP case styles. Also get heat-
sink compound.
Standoffs: Aluminum and brass thread standoffs of 4-40, 6-32 thread of various 
lengths.
Hardware: Machine screws (4-40, 6-32), hex nuts (4-40, 6-32), and flat, split-lock wash-
ers (4, 6, and 8).
Adhesive rubber feet: For project boxes, to prevent slipping and surface scratches.

626    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Transistor and IC sockets: Primarily 8, 14, and 16-pin DIP sockets.
Instrumentation knobs: 1⁄8-in. and 1⁄4-in. shaft diameters with a screw to secure the knob 
to the shaft. These are used on potentiometers and the like.
Enclosures: Plastic and aluminum, with PCB mounting hardware.
Sheet metal: This is usually sold in large sheets, 4 × 8 ft or larger, and is used for 
making metal chassis.
Wire-wrap hardware: You will need this if you plan on using wire-wrap construction 
techniques. Get assorted posts, IC sockets, and so on.
Chemical-Related Items
Following are some other items to stock:
Epoxy: Two-part epoxy resin works well for joining odd-shaped items together. It 
creates a thick, strong bond. Try to find one that dries clear.
Silicon adhesive: This is useful for gluing components, such as Molex connectors, to 
circuit boards. Silicon adhesive can stand high temperatures, which is good for 
anything that holds a part to be soldered. It also dries to a rubbery consistency, so 
it can be peeled off if the component needs to be removed.
Deoxidizers and cleaners: An example is DeoxIT, which acts as a deoxidizer, cleaner, 
and preservative for metal electrical connections, such as switches, relay contact 
pads, and banana and audio plugs.
Defluxer: This is used for removing flux from soldered boards. It prevents low-
resistance bridges from forming.
Antioxidant joint compound: An example is Nolox, which is good for ensuring that 
electrical connections don’t corrode under moist conditions. For example, if 
you’re running low-voltage landscape wires to lights or other outdoor projects 
using wire-nut connections, apply a dab of the compound to the wire connections 
before securing things together with a wire nut.
Conductive writer and circuit sealer pens: A conductive silver-based ink pen, such as 
the CircuitWriter by CAIG Laboratories Inc., is handy for fixing up corroded 
or damaged circuit board traces. The pen is used to redraw the ruined traces. A 
carbon-based ink pen is good for coating button contacts and membranes, where 
soldering is out of the question. In addition, an acrylic-based sealer pen can be 
used to provide conductive and oxidation protection to unprotected and newly 
drawn traces.
Circuit chiller: This is used to rapidly cool components and for troubleshooting inter-
mittently faulting capacitors, resistors, semiconductors, and other defective com-
ponents. It also detects cold solder joints, cracks in PCBs, and oxidized junctions.
PCB chemicals: Kits will usually already have all the necessary items, but extra 
resist, tape, resist pens, paint, rub-on transfer, and etchant can’t hurt.

FIGURE 7.77
Electronic CAD programs are very important tools for learning, simulating, and con-
structing sophisticated circuits. Many software packages include schematic draw-
ing, often simulation, and sometimes PCB design, autorouting, and even realistic 3D 
modeling. You can learn more about the various programs by surfing the Internet. 
Most of the software companies allow you to download a free demo version of their 
software. In addition, some of the most popular electronic CAD tools for hobby use 
are available for free (with restricted board size and layers) or as open source. Here 
are some CAD programs to check out:

documents. Appropriate footprints are placed on the PCB, and you can reposition them 
as required. EDS 3 uses shape-based design checking to make sure the connectivity of 
your design is correct. All copper areas are checked for overlaps.
7.5.23  Building Your Own Workbench
After much deliberation, one of the authors decided he wanted a new workbench 
with a large tabletop, five shelves, a metal frame to which to attach things, a built-in 
backboard with power outlets, an on/off switch for a hanging fluorescent lamp, and 
a large wire-spool holding rod. The plans for building the workbench are shown in 
Fig. 7.78a and b. The whole design is based on a Pro Rack model 07200 from Do+Able 
Products, Inc. The rack cost only about $90, and the whole project ended up costing 
around $400 plus a good day’s work. That author got all the material at Home Depot, 
where they even cut all the wood for free.

Operational amplifiers (op amps) are incredibly useful high- performance differential 
amplifiers that can be employed in a number of amazing ways. A typical op amp is 
an integrated device with a noninverting input, an inverting input, two dc power 
supply leads (positive and negative), an output terminal, and a few other specialized 
leads used for fine- tuning. The positive and negative supply leads, as well as the fine- 
tuning leads, are often omitted from circuit schematics. If you do not see any supply 
leads, assume that a dual supply is being used.
Note that we have labeled the supply voltages +Vs and −Vs, as they are usually 
the same. However, they do not need to be, as you will see when we look at single-
supply op amps in this chapter.
By itself, an op amp’s operation is simple. If the voltage applied to the inverting 
terminal V− is more positive than the voltage applied to the noninverting terminal  
V+, the output saturates toward the negative supply voltage −VS. Conversely, if  
V+ > V−, the output saturates toward the positive supply voltage +VS (see Fig. 8.2). 
This “maxing out” effect occurs with the slightest difference in voltage between the 
input terminals.

At first glance, it may appear that an op amp is not a very impressive device—
it switches from one maximum output state to another whenever there’s a voltage 
difference between its inputs. Big deal, right? By itself, it does indeed have limited 
applications. The trick to making op amps useful devices involves applying what is 
called negative feedback.
When voltage is “fed” back from the output terminal to the inverting terminal (this 
is referred to as negative feedback), the gain of an op amp can be controlled—the op 
amp’s output is prevented from saturating. For example, a feedback resistor RF placed 
between the output and the inverting input, as shown in Fig. 8.3, acts to convey the 
state of the output back to the op amp’s input. This feedback information basically 
tells the op amp to readjust its output voltage to a value determined by the resistance 
of the feedback resistor. The circuit in Fig. 8.3, called an inverting amplifier, has an 
output equal to −Vin(RF/Rin) (you will learn how to derive this formula later in this 
chapter). The negative sign means that the output is inverted relative to the input. 
The gain is then simply the output voltage divided by the input voltage, or −RF/Rin 
(the negative sign indicates that the output is inverted relative to the input). As you 
can see from this equation, if you increase the resistance of the feedback resistor, there 
is an increase in the voltage gain. On the other hand, if you decrease the resistance of 
the feedback resistor, there is a decrease in the voltage gain.
By adding other components to the negative- feedback circuit, an op amp can be 
made to do a number of interesting things besides pure amplification. Other interest-
ing op amp circuits include voltage- regulator circuits, current- to- voltage converters, 
voltage- to- current converters, oscillator circuits, mathematical circuits (adders, sub-
tractors, multipliers, differentiators, integrators, etc.), waveform generators, active 
filter circuits, active rectifiers, peak detectors, sample- and- hold circuits, etc. Most of 
these circuits will be covered in this chapter.
Besides negative feedback, there’s positive feedback, where the output is linked 
through a network to the noninverting input. Positive feedback has the opposite 
effect as negative feedback; it drives the op amp harder toward saturation. Although 
positive feedback is seldom used, it finds applications in special comparator circuits 
that are often used in oscillator circuits. Positive feedback also will be discussed in 
detail in this chapter.
8.1  Operational Amplifier Water Analogy
This is the closest thing we could come up with in terms of a water analogy for an op 
amp. To make the analogy work, you have to pretend that water pressure is analo-
gous to voltage and water flow is analogous to current flow.

8.2  How Op Amps Work (The “Cop- Out” Explanation)
An op amp is an integrated device that contains a large number of transistors, several 
resistors, and a few capacitors. Figure 8.5 shows a schematic diagram of a typical 
low- cost general- purpose bipolar operational amplifier.
This op amp basically consists of three stages: a high- input- impedance differential 
amplifier, a high- gain voltage amplifier with a level shifter (permitting the output to 
swing positive and negative), and a low- impedance output amplifier. However, real-
izing that an op amp is composed of various stages does not help you much in terms 
of figuring out what will happen between the input and output leads. That is, if you 
attempt to figure out what the currents and voltages are doing within the complex 
The inverting and noninverting terminals of 
the water op amp are represented by the two 
tubes with elastic balloon ends. When the 
water pressure applied to both input tubes is 
equal, the  lever arm is centered. However, if 
the  water pressure applied to the noninverting 
tube is made larger than the pressure applied 
to the inverting tube, the noninverting balloon 
 expands and forces the lever arm downward. 
The lever arm then rotates the rotator valve 
counterclockwise, thus opening a canal from 
the compressor tube (analogous to the posi-
tive supply voltage) to the output tube. (This is 
analogous to an op amp saturating in the posi-
tive direction whenever the noninverting input 
is more positive in voltage than the inverting 
input.) Now, if the pressure applied at the non-
inverting tube becomes less than the pressure 
applied at the inverting tube, the lever arm is 
pushed upward by the inverting balloon. This causes the rotator valve to rotate clockwise, thus opening the canal from the 
vacuum tube (analogous to the negative supply voltage) to the output. (This is analogous to an op amp saturating in the 
negative direction whenever the inverting input is made more positive in voltage than the noninverting input.) See what 
you can do with the analogy in terms of ex plaining negative feedback. Also note that in the analogy there is an infinite 
“input water impedance” at the input tubes, while there is a zero “output water impedance” at the output tube. As you will 
see, ideal op amps also have similar input and output impedance. In real op amps, there are always some leakage currents.

 system, you will be asking for trouble. It is just too difficult a task. What is important 
here is not to focus on understanding the op amp’s internal circuitry but instead to focus 
on memorizing some rules that individuals came up with that require only working 
with the input and output leads. This approach seems like a “cop- out,” but it works. 
8.3  Theory
There is essentially only one formula you will need to know for solving op amp 
circuit problems. This formula is the foundation on which everything else rests. It is 
the expression for an op amp’s output voltage as a function of its input voltages V+ 
(noninverting) and V− (inverting) and of its open- loop voltage gain Ao:
Vout = Ao(V+ − V−)
This expression says that an ideal op amp acts like an ideal voltage source that sup-
plies an output voltage equal to Ao(V+ − V−) (see Fig. 8.6). Things can get a little more 
complex when we start talking about real op amps, but generally, the open- loop voltage 
expression above pretty much remains the same, except now we have to make some 
slight modifications to our equivalent circuit. These modifications must take into 
account the nonideal features of an op amp, such as its input resistance Rin and output 
resistance Rout. Figure 8.6 right shows a more realistic equivalent circuit for an op amp.
To give meaning to the open- loop voltage gain expression and to the ideal and 
real equivalent circuits, the values of Ao, Rin, and Rout are defined within the following 
rules:
Rule 1: For an ideal op amp, the open- loop voltage gain is infinite (Ao = ∞). For a real 
op amp, the gain is a finite value, typically between 104 to 106.
Rule 2: For an ideal op amp, the input impedance is infinite (Rin = ∞). For a real op 
amp, the input impedance is finite, typically between 106 (e.g., typical bipolar op 
amp) to 1012 Ω (e.g., typical JFET op amp). The output impedance for an ideal  
op amp is zero (Rout = 0). For a real op amp, Rout is typically between 10 to 1000 Ω.
Rule 3: The input terminals of an ideal op amp draw no current. Practically speak-
ing, this is true for a real op amp as well—the actual amount of input current is 
usually (but not always) insignificantly small, typically within the picoamps (e.g., 
typical JFET op amp) to nanoamps (e.g., typical bipolar op amp) range.
Now that you are armed with Vout = Ao(V+ − V−) and rules 1 through 3, let’s apply 
them to a few simple example problems.

8.4  Negative Feedback
Negative feedback is a wiring technique where some of the output voltage is sent 
back to the inverting terminal. This voltage can be “sent” back through a resistor, 
capacitor, or complex circuit or simply can be sent back through a wire. So exactly 
what kind of formulas do you use now? Well, that depends on the feedback  circuit, 
but in reality, there is nothing all that new to learn. In fact, there is really only one 
formula you need to know for negative- feedback circuits (you still have to use the 
rules, however). This formula looks a lot like our old friend Vout = Ao(V+ − V−). There 
is, however, the V− in the formula—this you must reconsider. V− in the formula 
changes because now the output voltage from the op amp is “giving” extra voltage 
(positive or negative) back to the inverting terminal. What this means is that you 
must replace V− with fVout, where f is a fraction of the voltage “sent” back from Vout. 
That’s the trick!
EXAMPLE 1
Solve for the gain (Vout/Vin) of the circuit below.
Since V- is grounded (0 V) and V+ is simply Vin, you can plug these 
values into the open- loop voltage gain expression:
Vout = Ao(V+ − V−)
       = Ao(Vin − 0 V) = AoVin
Rearranging this equation, you get the expression for the gain:
V
V

If you treat the op amp as ideal, Ao would be infinite. However, if you 
treat the op amp as real, Ao is finite (around 104 to 106). This circuit acts 
as a simple noninverting comparator that uses ground as a reference. 
If Vin > 0 V, the output ideally goes to +∞ V; if Vin < 0V, the output 
ideally goes to -∞ V. With a real op amp, the output is limited by the 
supply voltages (which are not shown in the drawing but assumed). 
The exact value of the output voltage is slightly below and above the 
positive and negative supply voltages, respectively. These maximum 
output voltages are called the positive and negative saturation voltages.
FIGURE 8.7
EXAMPLE 2
Solve for the gain (Vout/Vin) of the circuit below.
Since V+ is grounded (0V) and V- is simply Vin, you can substitute these 
values into the open- loop voltage gain expression:
Vout = Ao(V+ − V−)
       = Ao(0 V − Vin) = −AoVin
Rearranging this equation, you get the expression for the gain:

If you treat the op amp as ideal, -Ao is negatively infinite. However, 
if you treat the op amp as real, -Ao is finite (around -104 to -106). This 
circuit acts as a simple inverting comparator that uses ground as a refer-
ence. If Vin > 0 V, the output ideally goes to -∞ V; if Vin < 0 V, the output 
ideally goes to +∞ V. With a real op amp, the output swings are limited 
to the saturation voltages.

640    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
There are two basic kinds of negative feedback, voltage feedback and operational 
feedback, as shown in Fig. 8.9.
Now, in practice, figuring out what the fraction f should be is not important. That is, 
you do not have to calculate it explicitly. The reason why we have introduced it in the 
open- loop voltage expression is to provide you with a bit of basic understanding as to 
how negative feedback works in theory. As it turns out, there is a simple trick for making 
op amp circuits with negative feedback easy to calculate. The trick is as follows: If you 
treat an op amp as an ideal device, you will notice that if you rearrange the open- loop 
voltage expression into Vout/Ao = (V+ − V−), the left side of the equation goes to zero—Ao 
is infinite for an ideal op amp. What you get in the end is then simply V+ − V− = 0. This  
result is incredibly important in terms of simplifying op amp circuits with negative  
feedback—so important that the result receives its own rule (the fourth and final rule).
Rule 4: Whenever an op amp senses a voltage difference between its inverting 
and noninverting inputs, it responds by feeding back as much current/voltage 
through the feedback network as is necessary to keep this difference equal to zero 
(V+ − V− = 0). This rule only applies for negative feedback.
The following sample problems are designed to show you how to apply rule 4 
(and the other rules) to op amp circuit problems with negative feedback.
Negative Feedback Example Problems
BUFFER (UNITY GAIN AMPLIFIER)
Solve for the gain (Vout/Vin) of the circuit below.
 Since you are dealing with negative feedback, 
you can apply rule 4, which says that the output 
will attempt to make V+ - V- = 0. By examining 
the simple connections, notice that Vin = V+ and 
V- = Vout. This means that Vin - Vout = 0. Rearrang-
ing this expression, you get the gain:
V

Gain

A gain of 1 means that there is no amplification; 
the op amp’s output follows its input. At first 
glance, it may appear that this circuit is useless. 
However, it is important to recall that an op amp’s input impedance is huge, while its output imped-
ance is extremely small (rule 2). This feature makes this circuit useful for circuit- isolation applica-
tions. In other words, the circuit acts as a buffer. With real op amps, it may be necessary to throw 
in a resistor in the feedback loop (lower circuit). The resistor acts to minimize voltage offset errors 
caused by input bias currents (leakage). The resistance of the feedback resistor should be equal to 
the source resistance. We will discuss input bias currents later in this chapter.

INVERTING AMPLIFIER
Solve for the gain (Vout/Vin) of the circuit below.
Because you have negative feedback, you 
know the output will attempt to make the dif-
ference between V+ and V- zero. Since V+ is 
grounded (0 V), this means that V- also will be 
0 V (rule 4). To figure out the gain, you must 
find currents I1 and I2 so you can come up with 
an expression containing Vout in terms of Vin. 
Using Ohm’s law, you find I1 and I2 to be

Because an ideal op amp has infinite input 
impedance, no current will enter its invert-
ing terminal (rule 3). Therefore, you can 
apply  Kirchhoff’s junction rule to get I2 = -I1. 
Substi tuting the calculated values of I1 and I2 into this expression, you get Vout/R2 = -Vin/R1. 
Rearranging this expression, you find the gain:

The negative sign tells you that the signal that enters the input will be inverted (shifted 180ç). 
Notice that if R1 = R2, the gain is -1 (the negative sign simply means the output is inverted). In 
this case you get what’s called a unity- gain inverter, or an inverting buffer. When using real op 
amps that have relatively high input bias currents (e.g., bipolar op amps), it may be necessary 
to place a resistor with a resistance equal to R1||R2 between the noninverting input and ground 
to minimize voltage offset errors.
NONINVERTING AMPLIFER
Solve for the gain (Vout/Vin) of the circuit below.
By inspection, you know that V+ = Vin. By 
apply ing rule 4, you then can say that V- = V+. 
This means that V- = Vin. To come up with an 
expression relating Vin and Vout (so that you can 
find the gain), the voltage divider relation is 
used:

Solve for Vout in terms of V1 and V2.
Since you know that V+ is grounded (0 V), and 
since you have negative feedback in the circuit, 
you can say that V+ = V- = 0 V (rule 4). Now that you 
know V-, solve for I1, I2, and I3 in order to come 
up with an expression relating Vout with V1 and 
V2. The currents are found by applying Ohm’s

Like the last problem, assume that no current

This means that you can apply Kirchhoff’s

If you make R1 = R2 = R3, Vout = -(V1 + V2). Notice that the sum is negative. To get a positive sum, you 
can add an inverting stage, as shown in the lower circuit. Here, three inputs are added together to 
yield the following output: Vout = V1 + V2 + V3. Again, for some real op amps, an additional input- 
bias compensation resistor placed between the noninverting input and ground may be needed to 
avoid offset error caused by input bias current. Its value should be equal to the parallel resistance 
of all the input resistors.

Solve for Vout in terms of Vin.
Because you have feedback, and because  
V+ = 0 V, you can say that V- is 0 V as well  
(rule 4). Now that you know V-, solve for 
IR and IC so that you can come up with an 
 expression relating Vout with Vin. Since no 
current enters the input of an op amp (rule 3),  
the displacement current IC through the 
 capacitor and the current IR through the 
 resistor must be related by IR + IC = 0. To find 
IR, use Ohm’s law:

Such a circuit is called an integrator; the input signal is integrated at the output. Now, one prob-
lem with the first circuit is that the output tends to drift, even with the input grounded, due to 
nonideal characteristics of real op amps such as voltage offsets and bias current. A large resistor 
placed across the capacitor can provide dc feedback for stable biasing. Also, a compensation 
resistor may be needed between the noninverting terminal and ground to correct voltage offset 
errors caused by input bias currents. The size of this resistor should be equal to the parallel 
 resistance of the input resistor and the feedback compensation resistor.

Such a circuit is called a differentiator; the input signal is differentiated at the output. The first dif-
ferentiator circuit shown is not in practical form. It is extremely susceptible to noise due to the op 
amp’s high ac gain. Also, the feedback network of the differentiator acts as an RC low- pass filter 
that contributes a 90ç phase lag within the loop and may cause stability problems. A more practical 
differentiator is shown below the first circuit. Here, both stability and noise problems are corrected

8.5  Positive Feedback
Positive feedback involves sending output voltage back to the noninverting input. 
In terms of the theory, if you look at our old friend Vout = Ao(V+ − V−), the V+ term 
changes to fVout ( f is a fraction of the voltage sent back), so you get Vout = Ao( fVout − 
V−). Now, an important thing to notice about this equation (and about positive feed-
back in general) is that the voltage fed back to the noninverting input will act to 
drive the op amp “harder” in the direction the output is going (toward saturation). 
This makes sense in terms of the equation; fVout adds to the expression. Recall that 
negative feedback acted in the opposite way; the fVout (= V−) term subtracted from 
the expression, preventing the output from “maxing out.” In electronics, positive 
feedback is usually a bad thing, whereas negative feedback is a good thing. For 
most applications, it is desirable to control the gain (negative feedback), while it is 
undesirable to go to the extremes (positive feedback).
There is, however, an important use for positive feedback. When using an op amp 
to make a comparator, positive feedback can make output swings more pronounced. 
Also, by adjusting the size of the feedback resistor, a comparator can be made to experi-
ence what is called hysteresis. In effect, hysteresis gives the comparator two thresholds. 
The voltage between the two thresholds is called the hysteresis voltage. By obtaining two 
thresholds (instead of merely one), the comparator circuit becomes more immune to 
noise that can trigger unwanted output swings. To better understand hysteresis, let’s 
take a look at the following comparator circuit that incorporates positive feedback.
with the addition of a feedback capacitor and input resistor. The additional components provide 
high- frequency rolloff to reduce high- frequency noise. These components also introduce a 90ç lead 
to cancel the 90ç phase lag. The effect of the additional components, however, limits the maximum 
frequency of operation—at very high frequencies, the differentiator becomes an integrator. Finally, 
an additional input- bias compensation resistor placed between the noninverting input and ground 
may be needed to avoid offset error caused by input bias current. Its value should be equal to the 
resistance of the feedback resistor.

Assume that the op amp’s output is at positive saturation, say, +15 V. If Vin is 0 V, 
the voltage difference between the inverting input and noninverting input (Vd) will 
be 1.36 V. You get this by using Ohm’s law:
IF = (Vout − Vin)/(R1 + R2)
Vd = IFR1
This does not do anything to the output; it remains at +15 V. However, if you reduce 
Vin, there is a point when Vd goes to 0 V, at which time the output switches states. 
This voltage is called the negative threshold voltage (−VT). The negative threshold voltage 
can be determined by using the previous two equations—the end result being −VT = 
−Vout/(R2/R1). In the example, −VT = −1.5 V. Now, if the output is at negative satura-
tion (−15 V) and 0 V is applied to the input, Vd = −1.36 V. The output remains at −15 V. 
However, if the input voltage is increased, there is a point where Vd goes to zero and the 
output switches states. This point is called the positive threshold voltage (+VT), which is 
equal to +Vout/(R2/R1). In the example, +VT = +1.5 V. Now the difference between the two 
saturation voltages is the hysteresis voltage: Vh = +VT − (−VT). In the example, Vh = 3 V.

8.6  Real Kinds of Op Amps
General Purpose
There is a huge selection of general- purpose and precision 
op amps to choose from. Precision op amps are specifically 
designed for high stability, low offset voltages, low bias cur-
rents, and low drift parameters. Because the selection of op 
amps is so incredibly large, we will leave it to you to check 
out the electronics catalogs to see what devices are available. 
When checking out these catalogs, you will find that op 
amps (not just general- purpose and precision) fall into one 
of the following categories (based on input  circuitry): bipo-
lar, JFET, MOSFET, or some hybrid thereof (e.g., BiFET). In 
general, bipolar op amps, like the 741 (industry standard), 
have higher input bias currents than either JFET or MOSFET 
types. This means that their input terminals have a greater 
tendency to “leak in” current. Input bias current results in 
voltage drops across resistors of feedback networks, biasing 
networks, or source impedances, which in turn can offset 
the output voltage. The amount of offset a circuit can tolerate 
ultimately depends on the application. Now, as we briefly 
mentioned earlier in this chapter, a compensation resistor 
placed between the noninverting terminal and ground (e.g., 
bipolar inverting amplifier circuit) can reduce these offset 
errors. (More on this in a minute.)

646    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
A simple way to avoid problems associated 
with input bias current is to use a FET op amp. 
A  typical JFET op amp has a very low input bias 
 current, typically within the lower pico amp 
range as compared with the nanoamp range 
for a typical bipolar op amp. Some MOSFET 
op amps come with even lower input bias cur-
rents, often as low as a few tenths of a picoamp. 
Though FET op amps have lower input bias 
 current than bipolar op amps, there are other 
features they have that are not quite as desir-
able. For example, JFET op amps often experi-
ence an undesired effect called phase inversion. 
If the input common- mode voltage of the JFET 
approaches the negative supply too closely, 
the inverting and noninverting input terminals 
may reverse directions—negative feedback 
 be comes positive feedback, causing the op amp 
to latch up. This problem can be avoided by 
using a bipolar op amp or by restricting the common- mode range of the signal. Here are some other general comments about 
bipolar and FET op amps: offset voltage (low for bipolar, medium for JFET, medium to high for MOSFET), offset drift (low 
for bipolar, medium for FET), bias matching (excellent for bipolar, fair for FET), bias/temperature variation (low for bipolar, 
fair for FET).
To avoid getting confused by the differences between the various op amp technologies, it is often easier to simply 
concentrate on the specifications listed in the electronics catalogs. Characteristics to look for include speed/slew rate, 
noise, input offset voltages and their drift, bias currents and their drift, common- mode range, gain, bandwidth, input 
impedance, output impedance, maximum supply voltages, supply current, power dissipation, and temperature range. 
Another feature to look for when purchasing an op amp is whether the op amp is internally or externally frequency 
compensated. An externally compensated op amp requires external components to prevent the gain from dropping 
too quickly at high frequencies, which can lead to phase inversions and oscillations. Internally compensated op amps 
take care of these problems with internal circuitry. All the terms listed in this paragraph will be explained in greater 
detail in a minute.

FIGURE 8.19
Programmable Op Amp
A programmable op amp is a versatile device 
that is used primarily in low- power applica-
tions (e.g., battery- powered circuits). These 
devices can be programmed with an exter-
nal current for desired characteristics. Some 
of the characteristics that can be altered by 
applying a programming current include 
quiescent power dissipation, input offset 
and bias currents, slew rate, gain- bandwidth 
prod uct, and input noise characteristics—all 
of which are roughly proportional to the pro-
gramming current. The programming current 
is typically drawn from the programming pin 
(e.g., pin 8 of the LM4250) through a resistor and into ground. The programming current 
allows the op amp to be operated over a wide range of supply currents, typically from around 
a few microamps to a few millamps. Because a programmable op amp can be altered so as to 
appear as a completely different op amp for different programming currents, it is possible to 
use a single device for a variety of circuit functions within a system. These devices typically 
can operate with very low supply voltages (e.g., 1 V for the LM4250). A number of different 
manufacturers make programmable op amps, so check the catalogs. To learn more about how 
to use these devices, check out the manufacturers’ literature (e.g., for National Semiconductor’s 
LM4250, go to www.national.com).

Common- mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The input to a difference amplifier, in gen-
eral, contains two components: a common- mode and a difference- mode signal. The 
common- mode signal voltage is the average of the two inputs, whereas the difference- 
mode signal is the difference between the two inputs. Ideally, an amplifier affects the 
difference- mode signals only. However, the common- mode signal is also amplified 
to some degree. The common- mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which is defined as the 
ratio of the difference signal voltage gain to the common- mode signal voltage gain 
provides an indication of how well an op amp does at rejecting a signal applied simul-
taneously to both inputs. The greater the value of the CMRR, the better is the perfor-
mance of the op amp.
Single- Supply Op Amps
These op amps are designed to be operated 
from a single positive supply (e.g., +12 V) and 
allow input voltages all the way down to the 
negative rail (normally tied to ground). Figure 
8.21 shows a simple dc amplifier that uses a 
single- supply op amp. It is important to note 
that the output of the amplifier shown cannot 
go negative; thus it cannot be used for, say, ac- 
coupled audio signals. These op amps are fre-
quently used in battery- operated devices.
Audio Amplifiers
These are closely related to conventional op 
amps but designed specifically to operate best 
(low audio band noise, crossover distortion, 
etc.) within the audio- frequency spectrum (20 
to 20,000 Hz). These devices are used mainly in 
sensitive preamplifiers, audio systems, AM- FM 
radio receivers, servo amplifiers, and intercom 
and automotive circuits. There are a number of 
audio amplifiers to choose from. Some of these 
devices contain unique features that differ when 
compared with those of conventional op amps. 
For example, the popular LM386 low- voltage au-
dio amplifier has a gain that is internally fixed at 20 but which can be increased to up to 200 with an external capacitor and resis-
tor placed across its gain leads (pins 1 and 8). This device is also designed to drive low- impedance loads, such as an 8- W speaker, 
and runs off a single supply from +4 to +12 V—an ideal range for battery- powered applications. The LM383 is another audio 
amplifier designed as a power amplifier. It is a high- current device (3.5 A) designed to drive a 4- W load (e.g., one 4-W speaker or 
two 8- W speakers in parallel). This device also comes with thermal shutdown circuitry and a heat sink. We’ll take a closer look 
at audio amplifiers in Chap. 15.

Differential- input voltage range. Range of voltage that may be applied between 
input terminals without forcing the op amp to operate outside its specifications. If 
the inputs go beyond this range, the gain of the op amp may change drastically.
Differential input impedance. Impedance measured between the noninverting and 
inverting input terminals.
Input offset voltage. In theory, the output voltage of an op amp should be zero when 
both inputs are zero. In reality, however, a slight circuit imbalance within the internal 
circuitry can result in an output voltage. The input offset voltage is the amount of 
voltage that must be applied to one of the inputs to zero the output.
Input bias current. Theoretically, an op amp should have an infinite input imped-
ance and therefore no input current. In reality, however, small currents, typically 
within the nanoamp to picoamp range, may be drawn by the inputs. The average 
of the two input currents is referred to as the input bias current. This  current can 
result in a voltage drop across resistors in the feedback network, the bias network, 
or source impedance, which in turn can lead to error in the output voltage. Input 
bias currents depend on the input circuitry of an op amp. With FET op amps, input 
bias currents are usually small enough not to cause serious offset voltages. Bipolar 
op amps, on the other hand, may cause problems. With bipolar op amps, a com-
pensation resistor is often required to center the output. We will discuss how this 
is done in a minute.
Input offset current. This represents the difference in the input currents into the 
two input terminals when the output is zero. What does this mean? Well, the input 
terminals of a real op amp tend to draw in different amounts of leakage current, even 
when the same voltage is applied to them. This occurs because there is always a slight 
difference in resistance within the input circuitry for the two terminals that originates 
during the manufacturing process. Therefore, if an op amp’s two terminals are both 
connected to the same input voltage, different amounts of input current will result, 
causing the output to be offset. Op amps typically come with offset terminals that can 
be wired to a potentiometer to correct the offset current. We will discuss how this is 
done in a minute.
Voltage gain (AV). A typical op amp has a voltage gain of 104 to 106 (or 80 to 120 dB;  
gain in dB = 20 log10A0
11) at dc. However, the gain drops to 1 at a frequency called 
the unity- gain frequency fT, typically from 1 to 10 MHz—a result of high- frequency 
limitations in the op amp’s internal circuitry. We will talk more about high- frequency 
behavior in op amps in a minute.
Output voltage swing. This is the peak output voltage swing, referenced to zero, 
that can be obtained without clipping.
Slew rate. This represents the maximum rate of change of an op amp’s output 
voltage with time. The limitation of output change with time results from inter-
nal or external frequency compensation capacitors slowing things down, which in 
turn results in delayed output changes with input changes (propagation delay). At 
high frequencies, the magnitude of an op amp’s slew rate becomes more critical. A 
 general- purpose op amp like the 741 has a 0.5 V/µs slew rate—a relatively small 
value when compared with the high- speed HA2539’s slew rate of 600 V/µs.
Supply current. This represents the current that is required from the power supply 
to operate the op amp with no load present and with an output voltage of zero.

8.8  Powering Op Amps
Most op amp applications require a dual- polarity power supply. A simple split 
±15- V supply that uses a tapped transformer is presented in Chap. 11. If you are 
using batteries to power an op amp, one of the following arrangements can be 
used.
Now, it is often desirable to avoid split- supplies, especially with small battery-
powered applications. One option in such a case is to use a single- supply op amp. 
However, as we pointed out a second ago, these devices will clip the output if the 
input attempts to go negative, making them unsuitable for ac- coupled applications. 
To avoid clipping while still using a single supply, it is possible to take a conven-
tional op amp and apply a dc level to one of the inputs using a voltage- divider  
network. This, in turn, provides a dc offset level at the output. Both input and output 
offset levels are referenced to ground (the negative terminal of the battery). With 
the input offset voltage in place, when an input signal goes negative, the voltage 
applied to the input of the op amp will dip below the offset voltage but will not go 
below ground (provided you have set the bias voltage large enough, and provided 
the input signal is not too large; otherwise, clipping occurs). The output, in turn, will 
fluctuate about its offset level. To allow for input and output coupling, input and 
output capacitors are needed. The two circuits in Fig. 8.24 show noninverting and

inverting ac- coupled amplifiers (designed for audio) that use conventional op amps 
that run off a single supply voltage.
In the noninverting circuit, the dc offset level is set to one- half the supply voltage by 
R1 and R2 to allow for maximum symmetrical swing. C1 (and R2) and C3 (and Rload) act as 
ac coupling (filtering) capacitors that block unwanted dc com ponents and low- level fre-
quencies. C1 should be equal to 1/(2πf3dBR1), while C3 should be equal to 1/(2πf3dBRload), 
where f3dB is the cutoff frequency (see Chaps. 9 and 15).
When using conventional op amps with single supply voltages, make sure to stay 
within the minimum supply voltage rating of the op amp, and also make sure to account 
for maximum output swing limitations and maximum common- mode input range.
8.9  Some Practical Notes
As a note of caution, never reverse an op amp’s power supply leads. Doing so 
can result in a zapped op amp IC. One way to avoid this fate is to place a diode 
between the op amp’s negative supply terminal and the negative supply, as shown 
in Fig. 8.25.
Also keep wires running from the power supply to the op amp’s supply termi-
nals short and direct. This helps prevent unwanted oscillations/noise from arising 
in the output. Disturbances also may arise from variations in supply voltage. To 
eliminate these effects, place bypass capacitors from the supply terminals to ground 
as shown in Fig. 8.25. A 0.1- µF disk capacitor or a 1.0- µF tantalum capacitor should 
do the trick.
Both bipolar and JFET op amps can experience a serious form of latch if the input 
signal becomes more positive or negative than the respective op amp power supplies. If

the input terminals go more positive than +VS + 0.7 V or more negative than −Vs − 0.7 V, 
current may flow in the wrong direction within the internal circuitry, short- circuiting the 
power supplies and destroying the device. To avoid this potentially fatal latch- up, it is 
important to prevent the input terminals of op amps from exceeding the power supplies. 
This feature has vital consequences during device turn- on; if a signal is applied to an op 
amp before it is powered, it may be destroyed at the moment power is applied. A “hard 
wire” solution to this problem involves clamping the input terminals at risk with diodes 
(preferably fast low- forward- voltage Schottky diodes; see Fig. 8.25). Current- limiting 
resistors also may be needed to prevent the diode current from becoming excessive. This 
protection circuitry has some problems, however. Leakage current in the diodes may 
increase the error. See manufacturers’ literature for more information.
8.10  Voltage and Current Offset Compensation
In theory, the output voltage of an op amp should be zero when both inputs are 
zero. In reality, however, a slight circuit imbalance within the internal circuitry can 
result in an output voltage (typically within the microvolt to millivolt range). The 
input offset voltage is the amount of voltage that must be applied to one of the 
inputs to zero the output—this was discussed earlier. To zero the input offset volt-
age, manufacturers usually include a pair of offset null terminals. A potentiometer 
is placed between these two terminals, while the pot’s wiper is connected to the 
more negative supply terminal, as shown in Fig. 8.26. To center the output, the two 
inputs can be shorted together and an input voltage applied. If the output saturates, 
the input offset needs trimming. Adjust the pot until the output approaches zero.
Notice the resistor placed between the noninverting terminal and ground within 
the inverting amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 8.26 right. What is the resistor used for? 
It is used to compensate for output voltage errors caused by a voltage drops across 
R1 and R2 as a result of input bias current. As discussed earlier, bipolar op amps tend 
to have larger input bias currents than FET op amps. With FET op amps, the input 
bias errors are usually so small (in the picoamp range) that the output voltage error 
is insignificant, and the compensation resistor is not needed. However, with bipolar 
op amps, this is not the case (input bias currents in the nanoamp range), and compen-
sation is often necessary. Now, in the inverting amplifier, the bias current—assuming 
for now that the compensation resistor is missing—introduces a voltage drop equal to  
Vin = Ibias(R1∙R2), which is amplified by a factor of −R2/R1. In order to correct this prob-
lem, a compensation resistor with a resistance equal the R1∙R2 is placed between the

noninverting terminal and ground. This resistor makes the op  amp “feel” the same 
input driving resistance.
8.11  Frequency Compensation
For a typical op amp, the open- loop gain is typically between 104 and 106 (80 to 
120 dB). However, at a certain low frequency, called the breakover frequency fB, the gain 
drops by 3 dB, or drops to 70.7 percent of the open- loop gain (maximum gain). As the 
frequency increases, the gain drops further until it reaches 1 (or 0 dB) at a frequency 
called the unity- gain frequency fT. The unity- gain frequency for an op amp is typi-
cally around 1 MHz and is given in the manufacturer’s specifications (see Fig. 8.27 
left). The rolloff in gain as the frequency increases is caused by low- pass filter- like 
characteristics inherently built into the op amp’s inner circuitry. If negative feedback 
is used, an improvement in bandwidth results; the response is flatter over a wider 
range of frequencies, as shown in the far- left graph in Fig. 8.27. Now op amps that 
exhibit an open- loop gain drop of more than 60 dB per decade at fT are unstable due 
to phase shifts incurred in the filter-like regions within the interior circuitry. If these 
phase shifts reach 180° at some frequency at which the gain is greater than 1, nega-
tive feedback becomes positive feedback, which results in undesired oscillations (see 
center and right grafts in Fig. 8.27). To prevent these oscillations, frequency compen-
sation is required. Uncompensated op amps can be frequency compensated by con-
necting an RC network between the op amp’s frequency- compensation terminals. 
The network, especially the capacitor, influences the shape of the response curve. 
Manufacturers will supply you with the response curves, along with the component 
values of the compensation network for a particular desired response.
Perhaps the easiest way to avoid dealing with frequency compensation is to buy 
an op amp that is internally compensated.
8.12  Comparators
In many situations, it is desirable to know which of two signals is bigger or to know 
when a signal exceeds a predetermined voltage. Simple circuits that do just this can 
be constructed with op amps, as shown in Fig. 8.28. In the noninverting comparator 
circuit, the output switches from low (0 V) to high (positive saturation) when the 
input voltage exceeds a reference voltage applied to the inverting input. In the invert-
ing comparator circuit, the output switches from high to low when the input exceeds 
the reference voltage applied to the noninverting terminal. In the far- right circuit, a 
voltage divider (pot) is used to set the reference voltage.

Note that not all op amps are able to operate with a grounded negative supply, 
and a special-purpose comparator IC is a better approach.
Another, more popular method for comparing two voltages is to use a special 
IC called a comparator. A comparator, like an op amp, has an inverting input, a non-
inverting input, an output, and power supply leads—its schematic looks like an op 
amp, too. However, unlike op amps, comparators are not frequency compensated and 
therefore cannot be used as linear amplifiers. In fact, comparators never use negative 
feedback (they often use positive feedback, as you will see). If negative feedback were 
used with a comparator, its output characteristics would be unstable. Comparators 
are specifically designed for high- speed switching—they have much larger slew 
rates and smaller propagation delays than op amps. Another important difference 
between a comparator and an op amp has to do with the output circuitry. Unlike an 
op amp, which typically has a push- pull output stage, a comparator uses an internal 
transistor whose collector is connected to the output and whose emitter is grounded. 
When the comparator’s noninverting terminal is less positive in voltage than the 
inverting terminal, the output transistor turns on, grounding the output. When the 
noninverting terminal is made more positive than the inverting terminal, the output 
transistor is off. In order to give the comparator a high output state when the transis-
tor is off (V− < V+), an external pull- up resistor connected from a positive voltage source 
to the output is used. The pull- up resistor acts like the collector resistor in a transistor 
amplifier. The size of the pull- up resistor should be large enough to avoid exces-
sive power dissipation yet small enough to supply enough drive to switch what-
ever load circuitry is used on the comparator’s output. The typical resistance for a 
pull- up resistor is anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand ohms. Figure 8.29  
shows a simple noninverting and inverting comparator circuit with pull- up resistors 
included. Both circuits have an output swing from 0 to +5 V.
FIGURE 8.28

Comparators are commonly used in analog- to- digital conversion. A typical appli-
cation might be to connect a magnetic tape sensor or photodiode to an input of a com-
parator (with reference voltage set at the other input) and allow the sensor to drive the

to- digital conversion is discussed in greater detail in Chap. 12.
8.13  Comparators with Hysteresis
Now there is a basic problem with both comparator circuits shown in Fig. 8.29. When 
a slowly varying signal is present that has a level near the reference voltage, the output 
will “jitter” or flip back and forth between high and low output states. In many situa-
tions having such a “finicky” response is undesirable. Instead, what is usually desired 
is a small “cushion” region that ignores small signal deviations. To provide the cushion, 
positive feedback can be added to the comparator to provide hysteresis, which amounts 
to creating two different threshold voltages or triggering points. The details of how hys-
teresis works within comparator circuits are given in the following two examples.
8.13.1  Inverting Comparator with Hysteresis
In the inverting comparator circuit shown in Fig. 8.30, positive feedback through R3 pro-
vides the comparator with two threshold voltages or triggering points. The two thresh-
old voltages result from the fact that the reference voltage applied to the noninverting 
terminal is different when Vout is high (+15 V) and when Vout is low (0 V)—a result of 
feedback current. Let’s call the reference voltage when the output is high Vref1, and call 
the reference voltage when Vout is low Vref2. Now let’s assume that the output is high 
(transistor is off) and Vin > Vref1. In order for the output to switch high, Vin must be greater 
than Vref1. However, what is Vref1? It is simply the reference voltage that pops up at the 
noninverting terminal when the output transistor is off and the output is high (+15 V).
To calculate Vref1, simply use the basic 
resistor network shown below the main 
circuit and to the left:

If Vin > Vref1 when the output is already 
high, the output suddenly goes low—
transistor turns on. With the output now 
low, a new reference voltage Vref2 is in 
place. To calculate Vref2, use the resistor 
network shown to the right of the first:

8.13.2  Noninverting Comparator with Hysteresis
Unlike the inverting comparator, the 
noninverting comparator only requires 
two resistors for hysteresis to occur. 
(Extra resistors are needed if you wish 
to use a voltage divider to set the refer-
ence voltage. However, these resistors 
do not have a direct role in developing 
the hysteresis voltage.) Also, the termi-
nal to which the input signal is applied 
is the same location where the thresh-
old shifting occurs—a result of positive 
feedback. The threshold level applied 
to the noninverting terminal is shifted 
about the reference voltage as the out-
put changes from high (+VC) to low (0 V). 
For example, assume that Vin is at a low 
enough level to keep Vout low. For the out-
put to switch high, Vin must rise to a trig-
gering voltage, call it Vin1, which is found 
simply by using the resistor network 
shown to the far left:

What’s desired: Vin1 = 8 V, Vin2 = 6 V, given +VC = 10 V and load of 100 kW. 
Question: What should Vref, Rpull- up, R2, and R1 be?
First, choose Rpull- up < Rload, and R2 > Rpull- up to minimize the effects of 
loading. For Rpull- up, choose 1 kW, and for R2, choose 1 M. Next, using the 
equations to the right, we find R1 and Vref.

Say we want to design a comparator circuit with a Vref1 = +6 V, a Vref2 = +5 V, and +VC = +15 V that drives a 100- kW load. 
The first thing to do is pick a pull- up resistor. As a rule of thumb,
Rpull- up < Rload
R3 > Rpull- up
Why? Because heavier loading on Rpull- up (smaller values of R3 and Rload) reduce the maximum output voltage, thereby 
 reducing the amount of hysteresis by lowering the value of Vref1. Pick Rpull- up = 3 kW, and choose R3 equal to 1 MW. Combin-
ing equations above gives us the practical formulas below the diagrams. With equation (1), calculate n, which is (6 V - 5 V)/ 
5 V = 0.20. Next, using equation (2), find R1, which is simply (0.2)(1 M) = 200 kW. Using equation (3), find R3, which is 
166 k/(15 V/6 V - 1) = 111 kW. These are the values presented in the circuit.

8.14  Using Single- Supply Comparators
Like op amps, comparator ICs come in both dual- and single- supply forms. With 
single- supply comparators, the emitter and the “negative supply” are joined inter-
nally and grounded, whereas the dual- supply comparator has separate emitter 
(ground) and negative supply leads. A few sample comparator ICs, along with two  
single- supply comparator circuits are shown below.
8.15  Window Comparator
A window comparator is a very useful circuit that changes its output state whenever 
the input voltage is anywhere between predetermined high and low reference volt-
ages. The region between these two reference voltages is called the window. Figure 
8.33 shows a simple window comparator built with two comparators (op amps also 
can be used). In the left- most circuit, the window is set between +3.5 V (Vref,high) and 
+6.5 V(Vref,low). If Vin is below +3.5 V, the lower comparator’s output is grounded, 
while the upper comparator’s output floats. Only one ground is needed, however, 
to make Vout = 0 V. If Vin is above +6.5 V, the upper comparator’s output is grounded, 
while the lower comparator’s output floats—again Vout goes to 0 V. Only when Vin is 
between +3.5 and +6.5 V will the output go high (+5 V). The right- most circuit uses a 
voltage- divider network to set the reference voltages.

8.16  Voltage- Level Indicator
A simple way to make a voltage- level indicator is to take a number of comparators that 
share a common input and then supply each comparator with a different reference or 
triggering voltage, as shown in Fig. 8.34. In this circuit, the reference voltage applied 
to a comparator increases as you move up the chain of comparators (a result of the 
voltage- divider network). As the input voltage increases, the lower comparator’s out-
put is grounded first (diode turns on), followed in succession by the comparators (LEDs) 
above it. The potentiometer provides proportional control over all the  reference voltages.

8.17  Instrumentation Amplifiers
Instrumentation amplifiers perform the same job as a differencing amplifier. That is 
they are used to amplify the difference between their positive and negative inputs. A 
typical practical application might be in an ECG (electrocardiogram) machine, where 
small differences in voltage between electrodes placed on the chest of the patient are 
amplified to produce the characteristic heartbeat trace so beloved of hospital dramas.
Instrumentation amplifiers have buffered inputs giving superior performance 
to basic differencing amplifiers and although you can construct an instrumentation 
amplifier from three regular op amps (see Fig. 8.35) it is more usual to use a special 
purpose instrumentation amplifier IC that includes the accurately matched resistors 
needed for precise operation. Instrumentation amplifiers have very good common 
mode rejection.
The resistors R1 need to be matched. 
If Rg is omitted then the amplifier has 
unity gain. Otherwise, the gain of the 
amplifier is given by:

Op Amp Power Booster (AC Signals)
There are times when an op amp needs a boost 
in output power- handling capacity while 
at the same time maintaining both positive 
and negative output swings. A simple way 
to increase the output power while maintain-
ing the swing integrity is to attach a comple-
mentary transistor push- pull circuit to the op 
amp’s output, as shown in this circuit. At high 
speeds, additional biasing resistors and capac-
itors are needed to limit crossover distortion. 
At low speeds, negative feedback helps elimi-
nate much of the cross over distortion.

Precision Current Source
Here, a precision current uses a JFET to drive 
a bipolar output transistor used to sink current 
through a load. Unlike the preceding current 
source, this circuit is less susceptible to output 
drift. Use of the JFET helps achieve essentially zero 
bias current error (a single bipolar output stage 
will leak base current). This circuit is accurate for 
output currents larger than the JFET’s IDS(on) and 
provided Vin is greater than 0 V. For large currents, 
the FET- bipolar com bination can be replaced with 
a Darlington transistor, provided its base current 
does not introduce significant error. The output 
current or load current is determined by
Iload = Vin/R2
R2 acts as an adjustment control. Additional com-
pensation may be required depending on  the 
load reactance and the transistors’  parameters. 
Make sure to use transistors of sufficient power 
ratings to handle the load current in question.

The circuit shown here transforms a current into a voltage. The feedback 
resistor RF helps establish a voltage at the inverting input and controls 
the swing of the output. The output voltage for this circuit is given by
Vout = IinRF
The light- activated circuits shown below use this principle to generate 
an output voltage that is proportional to the amount of input current 
drawn through the light sensor.

Programmable- Gain Op Amp
This circuit is simply an inverting amplifier 
whose feedback resistance (gain) is selected by 
means of a digitally controlled bilateral switch 
(e.g., CMOS 4066). For example, if the bilat-
eral switch’s input a is set high (+5 to +18 V)  
while its b through d inputs are set low (0 V), 
only resistor Ra will be present in the feedback 
loop. If you make inputs a through d high, then 
the effective feedback resistance is equal to 
the parallel resistance of resistors Ra through 
Rd. Bilateral switches are discussed in greater  
de tail in Chap. 12.

Overvoltage Protection (Crowbar)
This circuit acts as a fast- acting overvoltage pro-
tection control used to protect sensitive loads 
from voltage surges generated in the power 
supply. Initially, let’s assume that the supply 
is doing what it should—generating a constant  
+6 V. In this case, the voltage applied to the op 
amp’s noninverting input is set to 3 V (by means 
of the R1,R2 voltage divider—the pot provides 
fine- tuning adjustment). At the same time, the 
inverting input is set to 3 V by means of the 
3- V zener diode. The op amp’s differential in-
put voltage in this case is therefore zero, mak-
ing the op amp’s output zero (op amp acts as a 
comparator). With the op amp’s output zero, the 
SCR is off, and no current will pass from anode 
(A) to cathode to ground. Now, let’s say there’s a 
sudden surge in the supply voltage. When this 
occurs, the voltage at the noninverting  input 
increases, while the voltage at the inverting 
 input remain at 3 V (due to the 3- V zener). This 
causes the op amp’s output to go high, trigger-
ing the SCR on and diverting all current from 
the load to ground in the process. As a result, the 
fuse (breaker) blows and the load is saved. The 
switch is opened to reset the SCR.

Sample- and- Hold Circuits
Sample- and- hold circuits are used to sample an 
analog signal and hold it so that it can be analyzed 
or converted into, say, a digital signal at one’s  
leisure. In the first circuit, a switch acts as a sample/
hold control. Sampling begins when the switch 
is closed and ends when the switch is opened. 
When the switch is opened, the input voltage 
present at that exact moment will be stored in C. 
The op amp acts as a unity- gain amplifier (buffer),  
relaying the capacitor’s voltage to the output 
but preventing the capacitor from discharging 
(recall that ideally, no current enters the inputs 
of an op amp). The length of time a sample volt-
age can be held varies depending on how much 
current leaks out of the capacitor. To minimize 
leakage currents, use op amps with low input- 
 bias currents (e.g., FET op amps). In the other two 
circuits, the sample/hold manual switch is re-
placed with an electrically controlled switch—the 
left- most circuit uses a bilateral switch, while the 
right- most circuit uses a MOSFET. Capacitors best 
suited for sample/hold applications include Tef-
lon, polyethylene, and polycarbonate dielectric 
 ca pacitors.

Peak Detectors
The circuits shown here act as peak detectors—they 
follow an incoming voltage signal and store its 
maximum voltage within C (see graph). The op amp 
in the upper circuit acts as a buffer—it “measures” 
the voltage in C, outputs that voltage, and prevents 
C from discharging. The diode also prevents the 
capacitor from discharging when the input drops 
below the peak voltage stored on C. The second cir-
cuit is a more practical peak detector. The additional 
op amp makes the detector more sensitive; it com-
pensates for the diode voltage drop (around 0.6 V) 
by feeding back C’s voltage to the inverting ter-
minal. In other words, it acts as an active rectifier. 
Also, this circuit incorporates a switch to reset the 
detector. Often, peak detectors use a FET in place of 
the diode and use the FET’s gate as a reset switch. 
Reducing the capacitance of C promotes faster 
response times for changes in Vin.

Active Rectifiers
A single diode acts to rectify a signal—however, at 
the cost of a diode drop (e.g., 0.6 V). Not only does 
this voltage drop lower the level of the output, but 
it also makes it impossible to rectify low- level  
signals below 0.6 V. A simple solution to this prob-
lem is to construct an active rectifier like the one 
shown here. This circuit acts as an ideal rectifier, in 
so far as it rectifies signals all the way down to 0 V. 
To figure out how this circuit works, let’s apply the 
rules we have learned. If Vin is positive, current I will 
flow in the direction shown in the simplified network 
shown below the main circuit. Since V+ is grounded, 
and since we have feedback, V- = V+ = 0 V (rule 4), we 
can use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to find Vout1, Vout2, and 
finally, Vout3:

Vout2 = Vout1 + 0.6 V = -Vin
Vout3 = Vout2 = -Vin
Notice that there is no 0.6- V drop present at the 
 final output; however, the output is inverted rela-
tive to the input. Now, if Vin is negative, the output 
will source current through D1 to bring V- to 0 V 
(rule 4). But since no current will pass through R2 (due to buffer), the 0 V at V- is present at Vout2 and likewise present at 
Vout3. The buffer stage is used to provide low output impedance for the next stage without loading down the rectifier stage. 
To preserve the polarity of the input at the output, an inverting buffer (unity- gain inverter) can be attached to the output.

Noninverting Clipper Amplifier
This simple amplifier circuit acts to clip both posi-
tive and negative going portions of the output sig-
nal. The clipping occurs in the feedback network 
whenever the feedback voltage exceeds a zener 
diode’s breakdown voltage. Removing one of the 
zener diodes results in partial clipping (either posi-
tive or negative going, depending on which zener 
diode is removed). This circuit can be used to limit 
overloads within audio amplifiers and as a simple 
sinewave- to- squarewave converter.

A filter is a circuit that is capable of passing a specific range of frequencies while block-
ing other frequencies. As you discovered in Chap. 2, the four major types of filters 
include low- pass filters, high- pass filters, bandpass filters, and notch filters (or band- reject 
filters). A low- pass filter passes low- frequency components of an input signal, while a 
high- pass filter passes high- frequency components. A bandpass filter passes a narrow 
range of frequencies centered around the filter’s resonant frequency, while a notch 
filter passes all frequencies except those within a narrow band centered around the 
filter’s resonant frequency.
Filters
CHAPTER 9
Filters have many practical applications in electronics. For example, within a dc 
power supply, filters can be used to eliminate unwanted high- frequency noise present 
within the ac line voltage, and they act to flatten out pulsing dc voltages generated by 
the supply’s rectifier section. In radio communications, filters make it possible for a

radio receiver to provide the listener with only the desired signal while rejecting all 
others. Likewise, filters allow a radio transmitter to generate only one signal while 
attenuating other signals that might interfere with different radio transmitters’ signals. 
In audio electronics, filter networks called crossover networks are used to divert low 
audio signals to woofers, middle- range frequencies to midrange speakers, and high 
frequencies to tweeters. A high-pass filter is often used to eliminate 60 Hz mains hum 
from audio circuits. The list of filter applications is extensive.
There are two filter types covered in this chapter, namely, passive filters and active 
filters. Passive filters are designed using passive elements (e.g., resistors, capacitors, 
and inductors) and are most responsive to frequencies between around 100 Hz and 
300 MHz. (The lower frequency limit results from the fact that at low frequencies the 
capacitance and inductance values become exceedingly large, meaning prohibitively 
large components are needed. The upper frequency limit results from the fact that at 
high frequencies parasitic capacitances and inductances wreak havoc.) When designing 
passive filters with very steep attenuation falloff responses, the number of inductor and 
capacitor sections increases. As more sections are added to get the desired response, 
greater is the chance for signal loss to occur. Also, source and load impedances must 
be taken into consideration when designing passive filters.
Active filters, unlike passive filters, are constructed from op amps, resistors, and 
capacitors—no inductors are needed. Active filters are capable of handling very low 
frequency signals (approaching 0 Hz), and they can provide voltage gain if needed 
(unlike passive filters). Active filters can be designed to offer comparable performance 
to LC filters, and they are typically easier to make, less finicky, and can be designed 
without the need for large- sized components. Also, with active filters, a desired input 
and output impedance can be provided that is independent of frequency. One major 
drawback with active filters is a relatively limited high- frequency range. Above around 
100 kHz or so, active filters can become unreliable (a result of the op amp’s bandwidth 
and slew- rate requirements). At radiofrequencies, it is best to use a passive filter.
9.1  Things to Know Before You Start Designing Filters
When describing how a filter behaves, a response curve is used, which is simply 
an attenuation (Vout/Vin) versus frequency graph (see Fig. 9.2). As you discovered 
in Chap. 2, attenuation is often expressed in decibels (dB), while frequency may 
be expressed in either angular form ω (expressed in rad/s) or conventional form f 
(expressed in Hz). The two forms are related by ω = 2πf. Filter response curves may be 
plotted on linear- linear, log- linear, or log- log paper. In the case of log- linear graphs, 
the attenuation need not be specified in decibels.

Chapter 9: Filters    665
Here are some terms that are commonly used when describing filter response:
−3- dB Frequency (f3dB). This represents the input frequency that causes the output sig-
nal to drop to −3 dB relative to the input signal. The −3- dB frequency is equivalent 
to the cutoff frequency—the point where the input- to- output power is reduced by 
one- half or the point where the input- to- output voltage is reduced by 1/ 2. For 
low- pass and high- pass filters, there is only one −3- dB frequency. However, for 
bandpass and notch filters, there are two −3- dB frequencies, typically referred to 
as f1 and f2.
Center frequency (f0). On a linear- log graph, bandpass filters are geometrically sym-
metrical around the filter’s resonant frequency or center frequency—provided the 
response is plotted on linear- log graph paper (the logarithmic axis representing 
the frequency). On linear- log paper, the central frequency is related to the −3- dB 
frequencies by the following expression:
0
1
2
f
f f
=
For narrow- band bandpass filters, where the ratio of f2 to f1 is less than 1.1, the 
response shape approaches arithmetic symmetry. In this case, we can approxi-
mate f0 by taking the average of −3- dB frequencies:

Passband. This represents those frequency signals that reach the output with no more 
than −3 dB worth of attenuation.
Stop- band frequency (fs). This is a specific frequency where the attenuation reaches 
a specified value set by the designer. For low- pass and high- pass filters, the fre-
quencies beyond the stop- band frequency are referred to as the stop band. For 
bandpass and notch filters, there are two stop- band frequencies, and the frequen-
cies between the stop bands are also collectively called the stop band.
Quality factor (Q). This represents the ratio of the center frequency of a bandpass fil-
ter to the −3- dB bandwidth (distance between −3- dB points f1 and f2):

For a notch filter, use Q = (f2 − f1)/f0, where f0 is often referred to as the null frequency.
9.2  Basic Filters
In Chap. 2 you discovered that by using the reactive properties of capacitors and 
inductors, along with the resonant behavior of LC series and parallel networks, you 
could create simple low- pass, high- pass, bandpass, and notch filters. Here’s a quick 
look at the basic filters covered in Chap. 2:

666    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Now, all the filters shown in this figure have a common limiting characteristic, 
namely, a shallow 6- dB per octave falloff response beyond the −3- dB point(s). (You 
can prove this to yourself by going back to Chap. 2 and fiddling with the equations.) 
In certain noncritical applications, a 6- dB per octave falloff works fine, especially in 
cases where the signals you want to remove are set well beyond the −3- dB point. 
However, in situations where greater frequency selectivity is needed (e.g., steeper 
falloffs and flatter passbands), 6- dB per octave filters will not work. What is needed 
is a new way to design filters.
Making Filters with Sharper Falloff and Flatter Passband Responses
One approach used for getting a sharper falloff would be to combine a number of  
6- dB per octave filters together. Each new section would act to filter the output of the pre-
ceding section. However, connecting one filter with another for the purpose of increas-
ing the “dB per octave” slope is not as easy as it seems and in fact becomes impractical 
in certain instances (e.g., narrow- band bandpass filter design). For example, you have 
to contend with transient responses, phase- shift problems, signal degradation, winding 
capacitances, internal resistances, magnetic noise pickup, etc. Things can get nasty.
To keep things practical, what we will do is skip the hard- core filter theory 
(which can indeed get very nasty) and simply apply some design tricks that use basic 
response graphs and filter design tables. To truly understand the finer points of filter 
theory is by no means trivial. If you want in- depth coverage of filter theory, refer 
to a filter design handbook. (A comprehensive handbook written by Zverck covers 
almost everything you would want to know about filters.)
Let’s begin by jumping straight into some practical filter design examples that 
require varying degrees of falloff response beyond 6 dB per octave. As you go through 
these examples, important new concepts will surface. First, we will discuss passive 
filters and then move on to active filters.
9.3  Passive Low- Pass Filter Design
Suppose that you want to design a low- pass filter that has a f3dB = 3000 Hz (attenuation 
is −3 dB at 3000 Hz) and an attenuation of −25 dB at a frequency of 9000 Hz—which 
will be called the stop frequency fs. Also, let’s assume that both the signal- source imped-
ance Rs and the load impedance RL are equal to 50 Ω. How do you design the filter?

Chapter 9: Filters    667
First, make a rough attenuation versus fre-
quency graph to give yourself a general idea 
of what the response looks like (see far- left 
figure). Next, you must normalize the graph. 
This means that you set the −3- dB frequency 
f3dB to 1 rad/s. The figure to the near left shows 
the normalized graph. (The reason for normal-
izing becomes important later on when you 
start applying design tricks that use normal-
ized response curves and tables.) In order to 
determine the normalized stop frequency, sim-
ply use the following relation, which is also 
re ferred to as the steepness factor:
A

This expression tells you that the normalized 
stop frequency is three times larger than the 
normalized −3- dB point of 1 rad/s. Therefore, 
the normalized stop frequency is 3 rad/s.
Next, you must pick a filter response type. Three of the major kinds to 
choose from include the Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel. Without get-
ting too technical here, what is going on is this: Butterworth, Chebyshev, 
and Bessel response curves are named after individuals who were able to 
model LC filter networks after a mathematical function called the transfer 
function, given here:

The N’s in the equation are the numerator’s coefficients, the D’s are

−
v = 2of). The high-
est power n in the denominator is referred to as the order of the filter or  
the number of poles. The highest power m in the numerator is referred to 
as the number of zeros. Now, by manipulating this function, individuals 
(e.g., Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel) were able to generate unique 
graphs of the transfer function that resembled the attenuation response 
curves of cascaded LC filter networks. What is important to know, for 
practical purposes, is that the number of poles within the transfer func-
tion correlates with the number of LC sections present within the cas-
caded filter network and determines the overall steepness of the response 
curve (the decibels per octave). As the number of poles increases (number 
of LC sections increases), the falloff response becomes steeper. The coeffi-
cients of the transfer function influence the overall shape of the response 
curve and correlate with the specific capacitor and inductor values found 
within the filter network. Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel came up 
with their own transfer functions and figured out what values to place in 
the coefficients and how to influence the slope of the falloff by manipu-
lating the order of the transfer function. Butterworth figured out a way to 
manipulate the function to give a maximally flat passband response at the 
expense of steepness in the transition region between the passband and 
the stop band. Chebyshev figured out a way to get a very steep transition 
between the passband and stop band at the expense of ripples present in 
the passband, while Bessel figured out a way to minimize phase shifts 
at the expense of both flat passbands and steep falloffs. Later we will dis-
cuss the pros and cons of Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessell filters. 
For now, however, let’s concentrate on Butterworth filters.

Continuing on with our low- pass filter problem, 
let’s choose the Butterworth design approach, 
since it is one of the more popular designs used. 
The next step is to use a graph of attenuation 
versus normalized frequency curves for But-
terworth low- pass filters, shown in the figure. 
(Response curves like this are provided in 
filter handbooks, along with response curves 
for Chebyshev and Bessel filters.) Next, pick 
out the single response curve from the graph 
that provides the desired −25 dB at 3 rad/s, as 
stated in the problem. If you move your finger 
along the curves, you will find that the n = 3 
curve provides sufficient attenuation at 3 rad/s. 
Now, the filter that is needed will be a third- 
order low- pass filter, since there are three poles. 
This means that the actual filter that you will 
construct will have three LC sections.
Now that you have determined the order of the 
filter, move on to the next step—creating a nor-
malized LC filter circuit. (This circuit will not 
be the final filter circuit you will use—it will 
need to be altered.) The circuit networks that 
are used in this step take on either a o or the 
T configuration, as shown in the figure. If the 
source and load impedances match, either con-
figuration can be used—though a o network 
is more attractive because fewer inductors are 
needed. However, if the load impedance is 
greater than the source impedance, it is better 
to use T configuration. If the load impedance 
is smaller than the source impedance, it is bet-
ter to use the o configuration. Since the initial 
problem stated that the source and load imped-
ances were both 50 W, choose the o configura-
tion. The values of the inductors and capaci-
tors are given in Table 9.1. (Filter handbooks 
will provide such tables, along with tables for 
Chebyshev and Bessel filters.) Since you need 
a third- order filter, use the values listed in the  
n = 3 row. The normalized filter circuit you get 
in this case is shown in Fig. 9.8.

As mentioned a moment ago, this circuit is not the final circuit that we’ll use. 
That is, the component values listed here will not work! This is so because the graphs 
and tables you used to get to this point used the normalized frequency within them. 
Also, you haven’t considered the effects of the source and load impedances. In order 
to construct the final working circuit, you must frequency and impedance scale the 
component values listed in the circuit in Fig. 9.8. This leads us to the next step.
To account for impedance matching of the 
source and load, as well as getting rid of the 
normalized frequency, apply the following 
frequency and impedance scaling rules. To fre-
quency scale, divide the capacitor and inductor 
values that you got from the table by v = 2ofc. To 
impedance scale, multiply resistor and induc-
tor values by the load impedance and divide 
the capacitor values by the load impedance. In 
other words, use the following two equations 
to get the actual component values needed:

670    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
9.4  A Note on Filter Types
It was briefly mentioned earlier that Chebyshev and Bessel filters could be used 
instead of Butterworth filters. To design Chebyshev and Bessel filters, you take the 
same approach you used to design Butterworth filters. However, you need to use dif-
ferent low- pass attenuation graphs and tables to come up with the component values 
placed in the π and T LC networks. If you are interested in designing Chebyshev and 
Bessel filters, consult a filter design handbook. Now, to give you a better understand-
ing of the differences between the various filter types, the following few paragraphs 
should help.
Butterworth filters are perhaps the most popular filters used. They have very 
flat frequency response in the middle passband region, although they have some-
what rounded bends in the region near the −3- dB point. Beyond the −3- dB point, the 
rate of attenuation increases and eventually reaches n × 6 dB per octave (e.g., n = 3, 
attenuation = 18 dB/octave). Butterworth filters are relatively easy to construct, and  
the components needed tend not to require as strict tolerances as those of the other 
filters.
Chebyshev filters (e.g., 0.5- dB ripple, 0.1- dB ripple Chebyshev filter) provide a 
sharper rate of descent in attenuation beyond the −3- dB point than Butterworth and 
Bessel filters. However, there is a price to pay for the steep descent—the cost is a 
ripple voltage within the passband, referred to as the passband ripple. The size of the 
passband ripple increases with order of the filter. Also, Chebyshev filters are more 
sensitive to component tolerances than Butterworth filters.
Now, there is a problem with Butterworth and Chebyshev filters—they both 
introduce varying amounts of delay time on signals of different frequencies. In other 
words, if an input signal consists of a multiple- frequency waveform (e.g., a modu-
lated signal), the output signal will become distorted because different frequencies 
will be displaced by different delay times. The delay- time variation over the pass-
band is called delay distortion, and it increases as the order of the Butterworth and 
Chebyshev filters increases. To avoid this effect, a Bessel filter can be used. Bessel 
filters, unlike Butterworth and Chebyshev filters, provide a constant delay over the 
passband. However, unlike the other two filters, Bessel filters do not have as sharp 
an attenuation falloff. Having a sharp falloff, however, is not always as important as 
good signal reproduction at the output. In situations where actual signal reproduc-
tion is needed, Bessel filters are more reliable.
9.5  Passive High- Pass Filter Design
Suppose that you want to design a high- pass filter that has an f3dB = 1000 Hz and an 
attenuation of at least −45 dB at 300 Hz—which we call the stop frequency fs. Assume 
that the filter is hooked up to a source and load that both have impedances of 50 Ω 
and that a Butterworth response is desired. How do you design the filter? The trick, 
as you will see in a second, involves treating the high- pass response as an inverted 
low- pass response, then designing a normalized low- pass filter, applying some con-
version tricks on the low- pass filter’s components to get a normalized high- pass 
filter, and then frequency and impedance scaling the normalized high- pass filter.

Chapter 9: Filters    671
First, make a simple sketch of the response 
curve for the high- pass filter, as shown in the 
far- left graph. Next, take the high- pass curve 
and flip it around in the horizontal direction 
to get a low- pass response. Then normalize 
the low- pass response. (This allows you to 
use the low- pass design techniques. Later you 
will need to apply a transformation trick on 
the normalized component values of the low- 
pass filter to get the desired high- pass filter.) 
To find the steepness factor As and normalized 
stop- band frequency fs, follow the same basic 
procedure as you used in the low- filter exam-
ple, except now you must take f3dB over f:
A
f
f
s
s
1000 Hz
300 Hz
3.3
3dB
=
=
=
This expression tells us that the normalized stop- 
band frequency is 3.3 times larger than the nor-
malized −3- dB frequency. Since the normalized 
graph sets f3dB to 1 rad/s, fs becomes 3.3 rad/s.
Next, take the low- pass filter response 
from the preceding step and determine which 
response curve in Fig. 9.6 provides an attenua-
tion of at least −45 dB at 3.3 rad/s. The n = 5 curve 
does the trick, so you create a fifth- order LC 
network. Now, the question to ask is, Do you 
use the π or the T network? Initially, you might 
assume the π network would be best, since the 
load and source impedances are equal and since 
fewer inductors are needed. However, when 
you apply the transformational trick to get the 
low- pass filter back to a high- pass filter, you 
will need to interchange inductors for capaci-
tors and capacitors for inductors. Therefore, if 
you choose the low- pass T network now, you 
will get fewer inductors in the final high- pass 
circuit. The fifth- order normalized low- pass fil-
ter network is shown in the figure.
To convert the low- pass into a high- pass  
filter, replace the inductors with capacitors that 
have value of 1/L, and replace the capacitors 
with inductors that have values of 1/C. In other 
words, do the following:

Narrow- Band Design
Narrow- band filters (f2/f1 < 1.5), unlike wide- band filters, cannot be made simply 
by cascading low- pass and high- pass filters together. Instead, you must use a new, 
slightly tricky procedure. This procedure involves transforming the −3- dB band-
width (∆fBW = f2 − f1) of a bandpass filter into the −3- dB frequency f3dB of a low- pass fil-
ter. At the same time, the stop- band bandwidth of the bandpass filter is transformed 
into the corresponding stop- band frequency of a low- pass filter. Once this is done, a 
normalized low- pass filter is created. After the normalized low- pass filter is created, 
the filter must be frequency scaled in a special way to get the desired bandpass filter.  
9.6  Passive Bandpass Filter Design
Bandpass filters can be broken down into narrow- band and wide- band types. The 
defining difference between the two is the ratio between the upper −3- dB frequency 
f1 and lower −3- dB frequency f2. If f2/f1 is greater than 1.5, the bandpass filter is placed 
in the wide- type category. Below 1.5, the bandpass filter is placed in the narrow- band 
category. As you will see in a moment, the procedure used to design a wide- band 
bandpass filter differs from that used to design a narrow- band filter.
Wide- Band Design
The basic approach used to design wide- band bandpass filters is simply to combine a 
low- pass and high- pass filter together. The following example will cover the details. 
Suppose that you want to design a bandpass filter that has −3- dB points at f1 = 1000 
Hz and f2 = 3000 Hz and at least −45 dB at 300 Hz and more than −25 dB at 9000 
Hz. Also, again assume that the source and load impedances are both 50 Ω and a 
Butterworth design is desired.
The basic sketch shown here points out the 
basic response desired. The ratio f2/f1 = 3, 
which is larger than 1.5, so you do indeed have 
a wide- band situation. Notice how the sketch 
resembles low- pass and high- pass response 
curves placed together on the same graph. If 
you break up the response into low-  and high- 
phase curves, you get the following results:
Low- pass 
-3 dB at 3000 Hz
 
-25 dB at 9000 Hz
High- pass 
-3 dB at 1000 Hz
 
-45 dB at 300 Hz
Now, to design the wide- band bandpass fil-
ter, construct a low- pass and high- pass filter 
using the values above and the design tech-
nique used in the preceding two example prob-
lems. Once you have done this, simply cascade 
the low- pass and high- pass filters together. The 
nice thing about this problem is the low- pass 
and high- pass filters that are needed are simply 
the filters used in the preceding low- pass and 
high- pass examples. The final cascade network 
is shown at the bottom of the figure.

(The normalized circuit also must be impedance scaled, as before.) When frequency 
scaling the components of the normalized low- pass filter, do not divide by ω = 2πf3dB, 
as you would do with low- pass scaling. Instead, the normalized low- pass filter’s 
components are divided by 2π(∆fBW). Next, the scaled circuit’s branches must be reso-
nated to the bandpass filter’s center frequency f0 by placing additional inductors in 
parallel with the capacitors and placing additional capacitors in series with the induc-
tors. This creates LC resonant circuit sections. The values of the additional inductors 
and capacitors are determined by using the LC resonant equation (see Chap. 2 for the 
details):

NARROW- BANDWIDTH BANDPASS FILTER EXAMPLE
Suppose that you want to design a bandpass filter with −3- dB points at f1 = 900 Hz and 
f2 = 1100 Hz and at least −20 dB worth of attenuation at 800 and 1200 Hz. Assume that 
both the source and load impedances are 50 Ω and that a Butterworth design is desired.
Since f2/f1 = 1.2, which is less than 1.5, a narrow- band filter is needed. 
The initial step in designing a narrow- band bandpass filter is to nor-
malize the bandpass requirements. First, the geometric center frequency 
is determined:

Notice how things are a bit confusing. For each pair of stop- band fre-

which represents the more severe requirement −375 Hz.

Now choose a low- pass Butterworth response that provides at least

next step is to create a third- order normalized low- pass filter using the 
π configuration and Table 9.1.
Next, impedance and frequency scale the normalized low- pass filter 
to require an impedance level of 50 W and a −3- dB frequency equal to the 
desired bandpass filter’s bandwidth (DfBW = f2 - f1)—which in this exam-
ple equals 200 Hz. Notice the frequency- scaling trick! The results follow:

674    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
9.7  Passive Notch Filter Design
To design a notch filter, you can apply a technique similar to the one you used in the 
narrow- band bandpass example. However, now you use a high- pass filter instead of 
a low- pass filter as the basic building block. The idea here is to relate the notch filter’s 
−3- dB bandwidth (∆fBW = f1 − f2) to the −3- dB frequency of a high- pass filter and relate 
the notch filter’s stop- band bandwidth to the stop- band frequency of a high- pass 
filter. After that, a normalized high- pass filter is created. This filter is then frequency 
scaled in a special way—all its components are divided by 2π∆fBW. (This circuit also 
must be impedance scaled, as before.) As with the narrow- band bandpass filter 
example, the scaled high- pass filter’s branches must be resonated to the notch filter’s 
center frequency f0 by inserting additional series capacitors with existing inductors 
and inserting additional parallel inductors with existing capacitors.
EXAMPLE
Suppose that you want to design a notch filter with −3- dB points at f1 = 800 Hz and  
f2 = 1200 Hz and at least −20 dB at 900 and 1100 Hz. Let’s assume that both the source 
and load impedances are 600 Ω and that a Butterworth design is desired.
The important part comes now. Each circuit branch of the low- 
pass filter must be resonated to f0 by adding a series capacitor 
to each inductor and a parallel inductor to each capacitor. The 
LC resonant equation is used to determine the additional com-
ponent values:

9.8  Active Filter Design
This section covers some basic Butterworth active filter designs. We already dis-
cussed the pros and cons of active filter design earlier in this chapter. Here we will 
focus on the actual design techniques used to make unity- gain active filters. To begin, 
let’s design a low- pass filter.

To come up with the final notch filter design, start out by 
treating the steepness factor as the steepness factor for a 
high- pass filter. Next, apply the same tricks you used ear-
lier to construct a high- pass filter. Horizontally flip the 
high- pass response to get a low- pass response. Then nor-
malize the low- pass response (setting the normalized stop 
frequency to 1.7 rad/s) and use Fig. 9.6 (n = 3 provides at least 
−20 dB at 1.7 rad/s). Next, use Table 9.1 and the π network to 
come up with a normalized low- pass design. Then apply the 
low- pass to high- pass transformational tricks to get a nor-
malized high- pass filter:

The first two circuits in the figure show the low- pass to

Next, impedance and frequency scale the normalized 
high- pass filter to require an impedance level of 600 Ω and 
a −3- dB frequency equal to the desired notch filter’s band-
width (∆fBW = f2 - f1)—which in the example equals 400 Hz.

9.8.1  Active Low- Pass Filter Example
Suppose that you wish to design an active low- 
pass filter that has a 3- dB point at 100 Hz and 
at least 60 dB worth of attenuation at 400 Hz—
which we’ll call the stop frequency fs.
The first step in designing the filter is to 
normalize low- pass requirements. The steep-
ness factor is
A

=

This means that the normalized position of fs is 
set to 4 rad/s. See the graphs in Fig. 9.14. Next, 
use the Butterworth low- pass filter response 
curves in Fig. 9.6 to determine the order of fil-
ter you need. In this case, the n = 5 curve pro-
vides over −60 dB at 4 rad/s. In other words, 
you need a fifth- order filter.
Now, unlike passive filters design, active fil-
ter design requires the use of a different set of 
basic normalized filter networks and a differ-
ent table to provide the components of the net-
works. The active filter networks are shown in 
Fig. 9.14—there are two of them. The one to the 
left is called a two- pole section, while the one on 
the right is called a three- pole section. To design 
a Butterworth low- pass normalized filter of a 
given order, use Table 9.2. (Filter handbooks 
provide Chebyshev and Bessel tables as well.) 
In this example, a five- pole filter is needed,  
so according to the table, two sections are 
required—a three- pole and a two- pole section. 
These sections are cascaded together, and the 
component values listed in Table 9.2 are placed 
next to the corresponding components within 
the cascaded network. The resulting normal-
ized low- pass filter is shown in Fig. 9.15.

9.8.2  Active High- Pass Filter Example
The approach used to design active high- pass filters is similar to the approach used to 
design passive high- pass filters. Take a normalized low- pass filter, transform it into a 
high- pass circuit, and then frequency and impedance scale it. For example, suppose 
that you want to design a high- pass filter with a −3- dB frequency of 1000 Hz and 50 
dB worth of attenuation at 300 Hz. What do you do?
The normalized filter will provide the cor-
rect response, but the component values are 
impractical—they’re too big. In order to bring 
these values down to size, the circuit must be 
frequency and impedance scaled. To frequency 
scale, simply divide the capacitor values by 
2πf3dB (you need not frequency scale the resis-
tors—they aren’t reactive). In terms of imped-
ance scaling, you do not have to deal with 
source/load impedance matching. Instead, 
simply multiply the normalized filter circuit’s 
resistors by a factor of Z and divide the capaci-
tors by the same factor. The value of Z is cho-
sen to scale the normalized filter components 
to more practical values. A typical value for Z 
is 10,000 Ω. In summary, the final scaling rules 
are expressed as follows:

Taking Z to be 10,000, you get the final low- 
pass filter circuit shown at the bottom of the 
figure.
The first step is to convert the high- pass 
response into a normalized low- pass response, 
as shown in the figure. The steepness factor for 
the low- pass equivalent response is given by

This means that the stop frequency is set to 
3.3 rad/s on the normalized graph. The But-
terworth response curve shown in Fig. 9.6 tells 
you that a fifth- order (n = 5) filter will provide 
the needed attenuation response. Like the last 
example, a cascaded three- pole/two- pole nor-
malized low- pass filter is required. This filter 
is shown in Fig. 9.16.
Next, the normalized low- pass filter must 
be converted into a normalized high- pass fil-
ter. To make the conversion, exchange resistors 
for capacitors that have values of 1/R F, and 
exchange capacitors with resistors that have 
values of 1/C Ω. The second circuit in Fig. 9.16 
shows the transformation.

9.8.3  Active Bandpass Filters
To design an active bandpass filter, it is necessary to determine if a wide- band or 
narrow- band type is needed. If the upper 3- dB frequency divided by the lower 3- dB 
frequency is greater than 1.5, the bandpass filter is a wide- band type; below 1.5, it is 
a narrow- band type. To design a wide- band bandpass filter, simply cascade a high- 
pass and low- pass active filter together. To design a narrow- band bandpass filter, you 
have to use some special tricks.
Wide- Band Example
Suppose that you want to design a bandpass filter that has −3- dB points at f1 = 1000 
Hz and f2 = 3000 Hz and at least −30 dB at 300 and 10,000 Hz. What do you do?
Like the last example problem, to construct 
the final circuit, the normalized high- pass fil-
ter’s component values must be frequency and 
impedance scaled:

Again, let Z = 10,000. The final circuit is shown

Yes it is—it is greater than 1.5. This means that 
you simply have to cascade a low- pass and 
high- pass filter together. Next, the response 
requirements for the bandpass filter are 
broken down into low- pass and high- pass 
re quirements:
Low- pass: 
−3 dB at 3000 Hz
 
 
−30 dB at 10,000 Hz

Narrow- Band Example
Suppose that you want to design a bandpass filter that has a center frequency f0 = 
2000 Hz and a −3- dB bandwidth ∆fBW = f2 − f1 = 40 Hz. How do you design the filter? 
Since f2/f1 = 2040 Hz/1960 Hz = 1.04, it is not possible to used the low- pass/high- pass 
cascading technique you used in the wide- band example. Instead, you must use a dif-
ferent approach. One simple approach is shown below.
The steepness factor for the low- pass filter is

This means that the normalized stop frequen-
cies for both filters will be 3.3 rad/s. Next, use 
the response curves in Fig. 9.6 to determine 
the needed filter orders—n = 3 provides over 
−30 dB at 3.3 rad/s. To create the cascaded, nor-
malized low- pass/high- pass filter, follow the 
steps in the last two examples. The upper two 
circuits in the figure show the steps involved 
in this process. To construct the final bandpass 
filter, the normalized bandpass filter must be 
frequency and impedance scaled.

Narrow- Band Notch Filters Example
To design a narrow- band notch filter (f2/f1 < 1.5), an RC network called the twin-
 T (see Fig. 9.21) is frequently used. A deep null can be obtained at a particular fre-
quency with this circuit, but the circuit’s Q is only 1⁄4. (Recall that the Q for a notch 
filter is given as the center or null frequency divided by the −3- dB bandwidth.) To 
increase the Q, use the active notch filter shown in Fig. 9.22.
9.8.4  Active Notch Filters
Active notch filters come in narrow- and wide- band types. If the upper −3- dB fre-
quency divided by the lower −3- dB frequency is greater than 1.5, the filter is called a 
wide- band notch filter—less than 1.5, the filter is called a narrow- band notch filter.
Wide- Band Notch Filter Example
To design a wide- band notch filter, simply combine a low- pass and high- pass filter 
together as shown in Fig. 9.20.
Picking a convenient value for C—which we’ll 
set to 0.01 µF—the resistors’ values become

The final circuit is shown at the bottom of the 
figure. R2 can be replaced with a variable resis-
tor to allow for tuning.
For example, if you need a notch filter to have  
−3- dB points at 500 and 5000 Hz and at least  
−15 dB at 1000 and 2500 Hz, simply cascade a 
low- pass filter with a response of
3 dB at 500 Hz
15 dB at 1000 Hz
with a high- pass filter with a response of
3 dB at 5000 Hz
15 dB at 2500 Hz
After that, go through the same low- pass and 
high- pass design procedures covered earlier. 
Once these filters are constructed, combine 
them as shown in the circuit in Fig. 9.20. In this 
circuit, R = 10 k is typically used.

9.9  Integrated Filter Circuits
A number of filter ICs are available on the market today. Two of the major catego-
ries of integrated filter circuits include the state- variable and switched- capacitor filter 
ICs. Both these filter ICs can be programmed to implement all the second- order func-
tions described in the preceding sections. To design higher- order filters, a number 
of these ICs can be cascaded together. Typically, all that’s needed to program these 
filter ICs is a few resistors. Using IC filters allows for great versatility, somewhat sim-
plified design, good precision, and limited design costs. Also, in most applications, 
frequency and selectivity factors can be adjusted independently.
An example of a state- variable filter IC is the AF100 made by National 
Semiconductor. This IC can provide low- pass, high- pass, bandpass, and notch filter-
ing capabilities (see Fig. 9.23). Unlike the preceding filters covered in this chapter, the 
state- variable filter also can provide voltage gain.
Like the narrow- bandpass example, let’s sim-
ply go through the mechanics of how to pick 
the component values of the active notch filter. 
Here’s an example.
Suppose that you want to make a “notch” at 
f0 = 2000 Hz and desire a −3- dB bandwidth of 
∆fBW = 100 Hz. To get this desired response, do 
the following. First determine the Q:

For the AF100, the low- pass gain is set using resistors R1 and Rin (gain = −R1/Rin). 
For the high- pass filter, the gain is set by resistors R2 and Rin (gain = −R2/Rin). (The 
negative sign indicates that the output is inverted relative to the input.) Setting the 
gain for the bandpass and notch functions is a bit more complex. Other parameters, 
such as Q, can be tweaked by using design formulas provided by the manufacturer. 
A good filter design handbook will discuss state- variable filters in detail and will 
provide the necessary design formulas. Also, check out the electronics catalogs to see 
what kinds of state- variable ICs exist besides the AF100.
Switched- capacitor filters are functionally similar to the other filters already dis-
cussed. However, instead of using external resistors to program the desired character-
istics, switched- capacitor filters use a high- frequency capacitor- switching network tech-
nology. The capacitor- switching networks act like resistors whose values can be changed 
by changing the frequency of an externally applied clock voltage. The frequency of the 
clock signal determines which frequencies are passed and which frequencies get rejected. 
Typically, a digital clock signal is used to drive the filter—a useful feature if you are looking 
to design filters that can be altered by digital circuits. An example of a switched- capacitor 
IC is National Semiconductor’s MF5 (see Fig. 9.24). By simply using a few external resis-
tors, a power source, and an applied clock signal, you can program the filter for low- pass, 
high- pass, and bandpass functions. Again, like the state- variable ICs, manufacturers will 
provide you with necessary formulas needed for selecting the resistors and the frequency 
of the clock signal.
Switched- capacitor filters come in different filter orders. For example, the MF4 
is a fourth- order Butterworth low- pass filter, and the MF6 is a sixth- order low- pass 
Butterworth filter; both are made by National Semiconductor. These two ICs have 
unity passband gain and require no external components, but they do require a clock 
input. There are a number of different kinds of switched- capacitor filters out there, 
made by a number of different manufacturers. Check the catalogs.
As an important note, the periodic clock signal applied to a switched- capacitor 
filter can generate a significant amount of noise (around 10 to 25 mV) present in the 
output signal. Typically, this is not of much concern because the frequency of the 
noise—which is the same as the frequency of the clock—is far removed from the sig-
nal band of interest. Usually a simple RC filter can be used to get rid of the problem.

Within practically every electronic instrument there is an oscillator of some sort. The 
task of the oscillator is to generate a repetitive waveform of desired shape, frequency, 
and amplitude that can be used to drive other circuits. Depending on the application, 
the driven circuit(s) may require either a pulsed, sinusoidal, square, sawtooth, or 
triangular waveform.
Oscillators and Timers
CHAPTER 10
In digital electronics, squarewave oscillators, called clocks, are used to drive bits 
of information through logic gates and flip- flops at a rate of speed determined by 
the frequency of the clock. In radio circuits, high- frequency sinusoidal oscillators are 
used to generate carrier waves on which information can be encoded via modulation. 
The task of modulating the carrier also requires an oscillator. In oscilloscopes, a saw-
tooth generator is used to generate a horizontal electron sweep to establish the time 
base. Oscillators are also used in synthesizer circuits, counter and timer circuits, and 
LED/lamp flasher circuits. The list of applications is endless.
The art of designing good oscillator circuits can be fairly complex. There are a num-
ber of designs to choose from and a number of precision design techniques required. 
The various designs make use of different timing principles (e.g., RC charge/discharge 
cycle, LC resonant tank networks, crystals), and each is best suited for use within a spe-
cific application. Some designs are simple to construct but may have limited frequency 
stability. Other designs may have good stability within a certain frequency range, but 
poor stability outside that range. The shape of the generated waveform is obviously 
another factor that must be considered when designing an oscillator.
This chapter discusses the major kinds of oscillators, such as the RC relaxation 
oscillator, the Wien- bridge oscillator, the LC oscillator, and the crystal oscillator. The 
chapter also takes a look at popular oscillator ICs.

10.1  RC Relaxation Oscillators
Perhaps the easiest type of oscillator to design is the RC relaxation oscillator. Its oscilla-
tory nature is explained by the following principle: Charge a capacitor through a resistor 
and then discharge it when the capacitor voltage reaches a certain threshold voltage. 
After that, the cycle is repeated, continuously. In order to control the charge/discharge 
cycle of the capacitor, an amplifier wired with positive feedback is used. The amplifier 
acts like a charge/discharge switch—triggered by the threshold voltage—and also pro-
vides the oscillator with gain. Figure 10.2 shows a simple op amp relaxation oscillator.
Assume that when power is first applied, the op 
amp’s output goes toward positive saturation 
(it is equally likely that the output will go to 
negative saturation—see Chap. 8 for the details). 
The ca pacitor will begin to charge up toward the 
op amp’s positive supply voltage (around +15 V) 
with a time constant of R1C. When the voltage across 
the capacitor reaches the threshold voltage, the op 
amp’s output suddenly switches to negative satu-
ration (around -15 V). The threshold voltage is the 
voltage set at the non-inverting input, which is

The threshold voltage set by the voltage divider 
is now -7.5 V. The capacitor begins discharging 
toward negative saturation with the same R1C 
time constant until it reaches -7.5 V, at which 
time the op amp’s output switches back to the 
positive saturation voltage. The cycle repeats 
indefinitely, with a period equal to 2.2 R1C.
Let’s initially pretend the circuit shown here 
does not contain the PUT. In this case, the  
circuit would resemble a simple integrator 
circuit; when a negative voltage is placed at 
the inverting input (-), the capacitor charges 
up at a linear rate toward the positive satura-
tion voltage (+15 V). The output signal would 
simply provide a one- shot ramp voltage—it 
would not generate a repetitive triangular 
wave. In order to generate a repetitive wave-
form, we must now include the PUT. The  
PUT introduces oscillation into the circuit  
by acting as an active switch that turns on 
(anode- to- cathode conduction) when the anode-
to-cathode voltage is greater by one diode drop 
than its gate-to-cathode voltage. The PUT will 
remain on until the current through it falls 
 below the minimum holding current rating. 
This switching action acts to rapidly discharge 
the capacitor before the output saturates.

Here’s another relaxation oscillator that generates a sawtooth waveform

integrator network—with the exception of the PUT (programmable unijuction 
transistor) in the feedback loop. The PUT is the key ingredient that makes this cir-
cuit oscillate. Here’s a rundown on how this circuit works.

Here’s a simple dual op amp circuit that generates both triangular and square 
waveforms (see Fig. 10.4). This circuit combines a triangle- wave generator with a 
comparator. 
When the capacitor discharges, the PUT turns off, and the cycle repeats. 
The gate voltage of the PUT is set via voltage- divider resistors R4 and 
R5. The R1 and R2 voltage- divider resistors set the reference voltage at 
the inverting input, while the diodes help stabilize the voltage across 
R2 when it is adjusted to vary the frequency. The output- voltage ampli-
tude is determined by R4, while the output frequency is approximated 
by the expression below the figure. (The 0.5 V represents a typical voltage 
drop across a PUT.)
The rightmost op amp in the circuit acts as a comparator—it is wired 
with positive feedback. If there is a slight difference in voltage between 
the inputs of this op amp, the V2 output voltage will saturate in either 
the positive or negative direction. For sake of argument, let’s say the 
op amp saturates in the positive direction. It will remain in that satu-
rated state until the voltage at the noninverting input (+) drops below 
zero, at which time V2 will be driven to negative saturation. The thresh-
old voltage is given by

where Vsat is a volt or so lower than the op amp’s supply voltage (see 
Chap. 8) Now this comparator is used with a ramp generator (leftmost 
op amp section). The output of the ramp generator is connected to the 
input of the comparator, while its output is fed back to the input of the 
ramp generator. Each time the ramp voltage reaches the threshold volt-
age, the comparator changes states. This gives rise to oscillation. The 
period of the output waveform is determined by the R1C time constant, 
the saturation voltage, and the threshold voltage:

The frequency is 1/T.
Here is a unijunction transistor (UJT), along with some resistors and a 
capacitor, that makes up a relaxation oscillator that is capable of gen-
erating three different output waveforms. During operation, at one 
instant in time, C charges through R until the voltage present on the 
emitter reaches the UJT’s triggering voltage. Once the triggering voltage 
is exceeded, the E- to-B1 conductivity increases sharply, which allows 
current to pass from the capacitor- emitter region through the emitter- 
base 1 region and then to ground. When this occurs, C suddenly loses 
its charge, and the emitter voltage suddenly falls below the triggering 
voltage. After that, the cycle repeats itself. The resulting waveforms 
generated during this process are shown in the figure. The frequency of 
oscillation is given by

686    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
All the relaxation oscillators shown in this section are relatively simple to con-
struct. Now, as it turns out, there is even an easier way to generate basic waveforms. 
The easy way is to use an IC especially designed for the task. An incredibly popular 
squarewave- generating chip that can be programmed with resistors and a capacitor 
is the 555 timer IC.
10.2  The 555 Timer IC
The 555 timer IC is an incredibly useful precision timer that can act as either a 
timer or an oscillator. In timer mode—better known as monostable mode—the 555 
simply acts as a “one- shot” timer; when a trigger voltage is applied to its trigger 
lead, the chip’s output goes from low to high for a duration set by an external  
RC circuit. In oscillator mode—better known as astable mode—the 555 acts as a  
rectangular- wave generator whose output waveform (low duration, high duration, 
frequency, etc.) can be adjusted by means of two external RC charge/discharge  
circuits.
The 555 timer IC is easy to use (requires few components and calculations) and 
inexpensive and can be used in an amazing number of applications. For example, 
with the aid of a 555, it is possible to create digital clock waveform generators, LED 
and lamp flasher circuits, tone- generator circuits (sirens, metronomes, etc.), one- shot 
timer circuits, bounce- free switches, triangular- waveform generators, frequency 
dividers, etc.
where g is the UJT’s intrinsic standoff ratio, which is typically around 
0.5. See Chap. 4 for more details.
Here a simple relaxation oscillator is built from a Schmitt trigger 
 inverter IC and an RC network. (Schmitt triggers are used to transform 
slowly changing input waveforms into sharply defined, jitter- free out-
put waveforms [see Chap. 12]). When power is first applied to the cir-
cuit, the voltage across C is zero, and the output of the inverter is high 
(+5 V). The capacitor starts charging up toward the output voltage via R. 
When the capacitor voltage reaches the positive- going threshold of the 
inverter (e.g., 1.7 V), the output of the inverter goes low (}0 V). With the 
output low, C discharges toward 0 V. When the capacitor voltage drops 
below the negative- going threshold voltage of the inverter (e.g., 0.9 V), 
the output of the inverter goes high. The cycle repeats. The on/off times 
are determined by the positive-  and negative- going threshold voltages 
and the RC time constant.
The third example is a pair of CMOS inverters that are used to con-
struct a simple squarewave RC relaxation oscillator. The circuit can 
work with voltages ranging from 4 to 18 V. The frequency of oscillation

10.2.1  How a 555 Works (Astable Operation)
Figure 10.6 is a simplified block diagram showing what is inside a typical 555 timer 
IC. The overall circuit configuration shown here (with external components included) 
represents the astable 555 configuration.
The 555 gets its name from the three 5- kW 
 resistors shown in the block diagram. These 
resistors act as a three- step voltage divider 
between the supply voltage (VCC) and ground.  
The top of the lower 5- kW resistor (+ input to 
comparator 2) is set to 
1⁄3VCC, while the top of the 
middle 5- kW resistor (- input to comparator 1) 
is set to 
2⁄3VCC. The two comparators output ei-
ther a high or low voltage based on the analog 
voltages being compared at their inputs. If one 
of the comparator’s positive inputs is more 
positive than its negative input, its output logic 
level goes high; if the positive input voltage is 
less than the negative input voltage, the output 
logic level goes low. The outputs of the com-
parators are sent to the inputs of an SR (set/
reset) flip- flop. The flip- flop looks at the R 
and S inputs and produces either a high or a 
low based on the voltage states at the inputs 
(see Chap. 12).

Pin 1 (ground).  IC ground.
Pin 2 (trigger).  Input to comparator 2, which is used to set the flip- flop. When the 
voltage at pin 2 crosses from above to below 1⁄3VCC, the comparator switches to 
high, setting the flip- flop.
Pin 3 (output).  The output of the 555 is driven by an inverting buffer capable of sink-
ing or sourcing around 200 mA. The output voltage levels depend on the output 
current but are approximately Vout(high) = VCC − 1.5 V and Vout(low) = 0.1 V.
Pin 4 (reset).  Active- low reset, which forces Q
‾ high and pin 3 (output) low.
Pin 5 (control).  Used to override the 2⁄3VCC level, if needed, but is usually grounded 
via a 0.01- µF bypass capacitor (the capacitor helps eliminate VCC supply noise). An 
external voltage applied here will set a new trigger voltage level.
Pin 6 (threshold).  Input to the upper comparator, which is used to reset the flip- 
flop. When the voltage at pin 6 crosses from below to above 2⁄3VCC, the comparator 
switches to a high, resetting the flip- flop.
Pin 7 (discharge).  Connected to the open collector of the npn transistor. It is used to short 
pin 7 to ground when Q
‾ is high (pin 3 low). This causes the capacitor to discharge.
Pin 8 (Supply voltage VCC).  Typically between 4.5 and 16 V for general- purpose TTL 
555 timers. (For CMOS versions, the supply voltage may be as low as 1 V.)
In the astable configuration, when power is first applied to the system, the capaci-
tor is uncharged. This means that 0 V is placed on pin 2, forcing comparator 2 high. 
This in turn sets the flip- flop so that Q
‾ is low and the 555’s output is high (a result of 
the inverting buffer). With Q
‾ low, the discharge transistor is turned off, which allows 
the capacitor to charge toward VCC through R1 and R2. When the capacitor voltage 
exceeds 1⁄3VCC, comparator 2 goes low, which has no effect on the SR flip- flop. However, 

688    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
when the capacitor voltage exceeds 2⁄3VCC, comparator 1 goes high, resetting the flip- flop 
and forcing Q
‾ high and the output low. At this point, the discharge transistor turns on 
and shorts pin 7 to ground, discharging the capacitor through R2. When the capacitor’s 
voltage drops below 1⁄3VCC, comparator 2’s output jumps back to a high level, setting the 
flip- flop and making Q
‾ low and the output high. With Q
‾ low, the transistor turns off, 
allowing the capacitor to start charging again. The cycle repeats over and over again. 
The net result is a squarewave output pattern whose voltage level is approximately VCC 
− 1.5 V and whose on/off periods are determined by the C, R1 and R2.

Now there is a slight problem with the last circuit—
you cannot get a duty cycle that is below 0.5  
(or 50 percent). In other words, you cannot make 
thigh shorter than tlow. For this to occur, the R1C1 
network (used to generate tlow) would have to 
be larger the (R1 + R2)C1 network (used to gener-
ate thigh). Simple arithmetic tells us that this is  
impossible; (R1 + R2)C1 is always greater than 
R1C1. How do you remedy this situation? You 
attach a diode across R2, as shown in the figure. 
With the diode in place, as the capacitor is charg-
ing (generating thigh), the preceding time con-
stant (R1 + R2)C1 is reduced to R1C1 because the 
charging current is diverted around R2 through 
the diode. With the diode in place, the high and 
low times become
When a 555 is set up in astable mode, it has no 
 stable states; the output jumps back and forth. 
The time duration Vout remains low (around 
0.1 V) is set by the R2C1 time constant and the 
1⁄3VCC 
and 
2⁄3VCC levels; the time duration Vout stays high 
(around VCC - 1.5 V) is determined by the (R1 + R2)
C1 time constant and the two voltage levels (see 
graphs). After doing some basic calculations, the 
following two practical expressions arise:
tlow = 0.693R2C1
thigh = 0.693(R1 + R2)C1

For reliable operation, the resistors should be

10.2.3  How a 555 Works (Monostable Operation)
Figure 10.9 shows a 555 hooked up in the monostable configuration (one- shot 
mode). Unlike the astable mode, the monostable mode has only one stable state. This 
means that for the output to switch states, an externally applied signal is needed.
thigh = 0.693R1C1
tlow = 0.693R2C1
To generate a duty cycle of less than 0.5, or 50 per-
cent, simply make R1 less than R2.

In the monostable configuration, initially (before a trigger pulse is applied) the 
555’s output is low, while the discharge transistor is on, shorting pin 7 to ground and 
keeping C discharged. Also, pin 2 is normally held high by the 10- k pull- up resis-
tor. Now, when a negative- going trigger pulse (less than 1⁄3VCC) is applied to pin 2, 
comparator 2 is forced high, which sets the flip- flop’s Q
‾ to low, making the output 
high (due to the inverting buffer), while turning off the discharge transistor. This 
allows C to charge up via R1 from 0 V toward VCC. However, when the voltage across 
the capacitor reaches 2⁄3VCC, comparator 1’s output goes high, resetting the flip- flop 
and making the output low, while turning on the discharge transistor, allowing the 
capacitor to quickly discharge toward 0 V. The output will be held in this stable state 
(low) until another trigger is applied.

10.2.5  Some Important Notes about 555 Timers
555 ICs are available in both bipolar and CMOS types. Bipolar 555s, like the ones 
you used in the preceding examples, use bipolar transistors inside, while CMOS 
555s use MOSFET transistors instead. These two types of 555s also differ in terms 
of maximum output current, minimum supply voltage/current, minimum trig-
gering current, and maximum switching speed. With the exception of maximum 
output current, the CMOS 555 surpasses the bipolar 555 in all regards. A CMOS 
555 IC can be distinguished from a bipolar 555 by noting whether the part number 
contains a C somewhere within it (e.g., ICL7555, TLC555, LMC555, etc.). (Note 
that there are hybrid versions of the 555 that incorporate the best features of both 
the bipolar and CMOS technologies.) Table 10.1 shows specifications for a few 555 
devices.

The monostable circuit only has one stable 
state. That is, the output rests at 0 V (in reality, 
more like 0.1 V) until a negative- going trig-
ger pulse is applied to the trigger lead—pin 2. 
(The negative- going pulse can be implemented 
by momentarily grounding pin 2, say, by using 
a pushbutton switch attached from pin 2  to 
ground.) After the trigger pulse is applied, the 
output will go high (around VCC - 1.5 V) for  
the duration set by the R1C1 network. Without 
going through the derivations, the width of 
the high output pulse is
twidth = 1.10R1C1
For reliable operation, the timing resistor R1 
should be between around 10 kW and 14 MW, 
and the timing capacitor should be from around 
100 pF to 1000 lF.

Chapter 10: Oscillators and Timers    691
If you need more than one 555 timer per IC, check out the 556 (dual version) and 
558 (quad version). The 556 contains two functionally independent 555 timers that 
share a common supply lead, while the 558 contains four slightly simplified 555 tim-
ers. In the 558, not all functions are brought out to the pins, and in fact, this device 
is intended to be used in monostable mode—although it can be tricked into astable 
mode with a few alterations (see manufacturer’s literature for more information).

PRACTICAL TIP
To avoid problems associated with false triggering, connect the 555’s pin 5 
to ground through a 0.01- µF capacitor (we applied this trick already in this 
section). Also, if the power supply lead becomes long or the timer does not 
seem to function for some unknown reason, try attaching a 0.1- µF or larger 
capacitor between pins 8 and 1.

The monostable circuit shown here acts as a delay timer 
that is used to actuate a relay for a given duration. With 
the pushbutton switch open, the output is low (around 
0.1 V), and the relay is at rest. However, when the switch 
is momentarily closed, the 555 begins its timing cycle; 
the output goes high (in this case }10.5 V) for a duration 
equal to
tdelay = 1.10R1C1
The relay will be actuated for the same time duration. 
The diodes help prevent damaging current surges—
generated when the relay switches states—from damag-
ing the 555 IC, as well as the relay’s switch contacts.

10.3  Voltage- Controlled Oscillators
Besides the 555 timer IC, there are a number of other voltage- controlled oscillators 
(VCOs) on the market—some of which provide more than just a squarewave output. 
For example, the NE566 function generator is a very stable, easy- to- use triangular- 
wave and squarewave generator. In the 566 circuit below, R1 and C1 set the center 
frequency, while a control voltage at pin 5 varies the frequency; the control voltage is 
applied by means of a voltage- divider network (R2, R3, R4). The output frequency of 
the 566 can be determined by using the formula shown in Fig. 10.14.
LED and Lamp Flasher and Metronome
All these circuits are oscillator circuits 
(astable multivibrators). In the LED flasher 
circuit, a transistor is used to amplify the 555’s 
output in order to provide sufficient current 
to drive the LED, while RS is used to prevent 
excessive current from damaging the LED. In 
the lamp- flasher circuit, a MOSFET amplifier 
is used to control current flow through the 
lamp. A power MOSFET may be needed if the 
lamp draws a considerable amount of current. 
The metronome circuit produces a series of 
“clicks” at a rate determined by R2. To control 
the volume of the clicks, R4 can be adjusted.

Other VCOs, such as the 8038 and the XR2206, can create a trio of output wave-
forms, including a sine wave (approximation of one, at any rate), a square wave, and 
triangular wave. Some VCOs are designed specifically for digital waveform genera-
tion and may use an external crystal in place of a capacitor for improved stability. To 
get a feel for what kinds of VCOs are out there, check the electronics catalogs.
10.4  Wien- Bridge and Twin- T Oscillators
A popular RC- type circuit used to generate low- distortion sinusoidal waves at low 
to moderate frequencies is the Wien- bridge oscillator. Unlike the oscillator circuits 
discussed already in this chapter, this oscillator uses a different kind of mechanism to 
provide oscillation, namely, a frequency- selective filter network.
The heart of the Wien- bridge oscillator is its frequency- selective feed-
back network. The op amp’s output is fed back to the inputs in phase. 
Part of the feedback is positive (makes its way through the frequency- 
selective RC branch to the noninverting terminal), while the other part 
is negative (is sent through the resistor branch to the inverting input of 
the op amp). At a particular frequency f0 = 1/(2oRC), the inverting input 
voltage (V4) and the noninverting input voltage (V2) will be equal and 
in phase—the positive feedback will cancel the negative feedback, and 
the circuit will oscillate. At any other frequency, V2 will be too small to 
cancel V4, and the circuit will not oscillate. In this circuit, the gain must 
be set to +3. The resistors must satisfy the condition R3/R4 = 2 (which 
gives a noninverting gain of 3). Anything less than this value will cause 
oscillations to cease; anything more will cause the output to saturate. 
With the component values listed in the figure, this oscillator can cover a 
frequency range of 1 to 5 kHz. The frequency can be adjusted by means 
of a two- ganged variable- capacitor unit.
The second circuit shown in the figure is a slight variation of the first. 
Unlike the first circuit, the positive feedback must be greater than the 
negative feedback to sustain oscillations. The potentiometer is used to 
adjust the amount of negative feedback, while the RC branch controls 
the amount of positive feedback based on the operating frequency. Now, 
since the positive feedback is larger than the negative feedback, you 
have to contend with the “saturation problem,” as encountered in the last 
 example. To prevent saturation, two zener diodes placed face to face 
(or back to back) are connected across the upper 22- kW resistor. When the 
output voltage rises above the zener’s breakdown voltage, one or the other 
zener diode conducts, depending on the polarity of the feedback. The con-
ducting zener diode shunts the 22- kW resistor, causing the resistance of the 
negative feedback circuit to decrease. More negative feedback is applied 
to the op amp, and the output voltage is controlled to a certain degree.
FIGURE 10.15
10.5  LC Oscillators (Sinusoidal Oscillators)
When it comes to generating high- frequency sinusoidal waves, commonly used in 
radiofrequency applications, the most common approach is to use an LC oscillator. 
The RC oscillators discussed so far have difficulty handling high frequencies, mainly 
because it is difficult to control the phase shifts of feedback signals sent to the ampli-
fier input and because, at high frequencies, the capacitor and resistor values often 
become impractical to work with. LC oscillators, on the other hand, can use small 
inductances in conjunction with capacitance to create feedback oscillators that can 
reach frequencies up to around 500 MHz. However, it is important to note that at low 
frequencies (e.g., audio range), LC oscillators become highly unwieldy.

694    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
LC oscillators basically consist of an amplifier that incorporates positive feedback 
through a frequency- selective LC circuit (or tank). The LC tank acts to eliminate from 
the amplifier’s input any frequencies significantly different from its natural resonant 
frequency. The positive feedback, along with the tank’s resonant behavior, acts to 
promote sustained oscillation within the overall circuit. If this is a bit confusing, envi-
sion shock exciting a parallel LC tank circuit. This action will set the tank circuit into 
sinusoidal oscillation at the LC’s resonant frequency—the capacitor and inductor will 
“toss” the charge back and forth. However, these oscillations will die out naturally 
due to internal resistance and loading. To sustain the oscillation, the amplifier is used. 
The amplifier acts to supply additional energy to the tank circuit at just the right 
moment to sustain oscillations. Here is a simple example to illustrate the point.
Here, an op amp incorporates positive feedback that is altered by an LC 
resonant filter or tank circuit. The tank eliminates from the noninverting 
input of the op amp any frequencies significantly different from the tank’s 
natural resonant frequency:
f
LC
1
2ππ
=
(Recall from Chap. 2 that a parallel LC resonant circuit’s impedance becomes 
large at the resonant frequency but falls off on either side, allowing the 
feedback signal to be filtered out to ground.) If a sinusoidal voltage set at 
the resonant frequency is present at V1, the amplifier is alternately driven to 
saturation in the positive and negative directions, resulting in a square wave 
at the output V2. This square wave has a strong fundamental Fourier compo-
nent at the resonant frequency, part of which is fed back to the noninverting 
input through the resistor to keep oscillations from dying out. If the ini-
tially applied sinusoidal voltage at V1 is removed, oscillations will continue, 
and the voltage at V1 will be sinusoidal. Now in practice (considering real- 
life components and not theoretical models), it is not necessary to apply a 
sine wave to V1 to get things going (this is a fundamentally important point 
to note). Instead, due to imperfections in the amplifier, the oscillator will 
self- start. Why? With real amplifiers, there is always some inherent noise 
present at the output even when the inputs of the amplifier are grounded 
(see Chap. 8). This noise has a Fourier component at the resonant frequency, 
and because of the positive feedback, it rapidly grows in amplitude (perhaps 
in just a few cycles) until the output amplitude saturates.

Now, in practice, LC oscillators usually do not incorporate op amps into their designs. 
At very high frequencies (e.g., RF range), op amps tend to become unreliable due to slew- 
rate and bandwidth limitations. When frequencies above around 100 kHz are needed, it is 
essential to use another kind of amplifier arrangement. For high- frequency applications, 
what is typically used is a transistor amplifier (e.g., bipolar or FET type). The switching 
speeds for transistors can be incredibly high—a 2000- MHz ceiling is not uncommon for 
special RF transistors. However, when using a transistor amplifier within an oscillator, 
there may be a slight problem to contend with—one that you did not have to deal with 
when you used the op amp. The problem stems from the fact that transistor- like ampli-
fiers often take their outputs at a location where the output happens to be 180° out of 
phase with its input (see Chap. 4). However, for the feedback to sustain oscillations, the 
output must be in phase with the input. In certain LC oscillators this must be remedied 
by incorporating a special phase- shifting network between the output and input of the 
amplifier. Let’s take a look at a few popular LC oscillator circuits.

Chapter 10: Oscillators and Timers    695
Hartley LC Oscillator
Colpitts LC Oscillator
A Hartley oscillator uses an inductive voltage divider to determine the 
feedback ratio. The Hartley oscillator can take on a number of forms 
(FET, bipolar, etc.)—a JFET version is shown here. This oscillator 
achieves a 180ç phase shift needed for positive feedback by means of a 
tapped inductor in the tank circuit. The phase voltage at the two ends of 
the inductor differ by 180ç with respect to the ground tap. Feedback via L2 
is coupled through C1 to the base of the transistor amplifier. (The tapped 
inductor is basically an autotransformer, where L1 is the primary and L2 is 
the secondary.) The frequency of the Hartley is determined by the tank’s 
resonant frequency:
f
L C
T
T
1
2ππ
=
This frequency can be adjusted by varying CT. RG acts as a gate- biasing 
resistor to set the gate voltage. RS is the source resistor. CS is used 
to improve amplifier stability, while C1 and C2 act as a dc- blocking 
 capacitor that provides low impedance at the oscillator’s operating 
frequency while preventing the transistor’s dc operating point from 
being disturbed. The radiofrequency choke (RFC) aids in providing 
the amplifier with a steady dc supply while eliminating unwanted ac  
disturbances.
The second circuit is another form of the Hartley oscillator that uses 
a bipolar transistor instead of a JFET as the amplifier element. The fre-
quency of operation is again determined by the resonant frequency of 
the LC tank. Notice that in this circuit the load is coupled to the oscilla-
tor via a transformer’s secondary.

The Colpitts oscillator is adaptable to a wide range of frequencies and 
can have better stability than the Hartley. Unlike the Hartley, feedback 
is obtained by means of a tap between two capacitors connected in series. 
The 180ç phase shift required for sustained oscillation is achieved by 
using the fact that the two capacitors are in series; the ac circulating cur-
rent in the LC circuit (see Chap. 2) produces voltage drops across each 
capacitor that are of opposite signs—relative to ground—at any instant in 
time. As the tank circuit oscillates, its two ends are at equal and opposite 
voltages, and this voltage is divided across the two capacitors. The signal 
voltage across C4 is then connected to the transistor’s base via coupling 
capacitor C1, which is part of the signal from the collector. The collector 
signal is applied across C3 as a feedback signal whose energy is coupled 
into the tank circuit to compensate for losses. The operating frequency 
of the oscillator is determined by the resonant frequency of the LC tank:

10.6  Crystal Oscillators
When stability and accuracy become critical in oscillator design—which is often 
the case in high- quality radio and microprocessor applications—one of the 
best approaches is to use a crystal oscillator. The stability of a crystal oscillator 
(from around 0.01 to 0.001 percent) is much greater than that of an RC oscillator 
(around 0.1 percent) or an LC oscillator (around 0.01 percent at best).
When a quartz crystal is cut in a specific manner and placed between two conduc-
tive plates that act as leads, the resulting two- lead device resembles an RLC tuned 
resonant tank. When the crystal is shock- excited by either a physical compression 
or an applied voltage, it will be set into mechanical vibration at a specific frequency 
and will continue to vibrate for some time, while at the same time generating an ac 
voltage between its plates. This behavior, better know as the piezoelectric effect, is 
similar to the damped electron oscillation of a shock- excited LC circuit. However, 
unlike an LC circuit, the oscillation of the crystal after the initial shock excitation 
will last longer—a result of the crystal’s naturally high Q value. For a high- quality 
crystal, a Q of 100,000 is not uncommon. LC circuits typically have a Q of around a 
few hundred.
The RLC circuit shown in Fig. 10.20 is used as an equivalent circuit for a crystal. The 
lower branch of the equivalent circuit, consisting of R1, C1, and L1 in series, is called 
C1 and C2 are dc- blocking capacitors, while R1 and R2 act to set the bias 
level of the transistor. The RFC choke is used to supply steady dc to 
the amplifier. This circuit’s tank can be exchanged for one of the two 
adjustable tank networks. One tank uses permeability tuning (variable 
inductor), while the other uses a tuning capacitor placed across the 
inductor to vary the resonant frequency of the tank.

The Clapp oscillator has exceptional frequency 
stability. It is a simple variation of the Colpitts 
oscillator. The total tank capacitance is the 
series combination of C1 and C2. The effective 
inductance L of the tank is varied by changing 
the net reactance by adding and subtracting 
capacitive reactance via CT from inductive reac-
tance of LT. Usually C1 and C2 are much larger 
than CT, while LT and CT are series resonant at 
the desired frequency of operation. C1 and C2 
determine the feedback ratio, and they are so 
large compared with CT that adjusting CT has 
almost no effect on feedback. The Clapp oscil-
lator achieves its reputation for stability since 
stray capacitances are swamped out by C1 and 
C2 , meaning that the frequency is almost entirely 
determined by LT and CT. The frequency of 
operation is determined by

the motional arm. The motional arm represents the series mechanical resonance of the 
crystal. The upper branch containing C0 accounts for the stray capacitance in the crys-
tal holder and leads. The motional inductance L1 is usually many henries in size, while 
the motional capacitance C1 is very small (<<1 pF). The ratio of L1 to C1 for a crystal 
is much higher than could be achieved with real inductors and capacitors. Both the 
internal resistance of the crystal R1 and the value of C0 are both fairly small. (For a  
1- MHz crystal, the typical components values within the equivalent circuit would be 
L1 = 3.5 H, C1 = 0.007 pF, R1 = 340 Ω, C0 = 3 pF. For a 10- MHz fundamental crystal, the 
typical values would be L1 = 9.8 mH, C1 = 0.026 pF, R1 = 7 Ω, C0 = 6.3 pF.)
In terms of operation, a crystal can be driven at series resonance or parallel resonance. In 
series resonance, when the crystal is driven at a particular frequency, called the series reso-
nant frequency fs, the crystal resembles a series- tuned resonance LC circuit; the impedance 
across it goes to a minimum—only R1 remains. In parallel resonance, when the crystal is 
driven at what is called the parallel resonant frequency fp, the crystal resembles a parallel- 
tuned LC tank; the impedance across it peaks to a high value (see the graphs in Fig. 10.20).
Quartz crystals come in series- mode and parallel- mode forms and may either be 
specified as a fundamental- type or an overtone- type crystal. Fundamental- type crys-
tals are designed for operation at the crystal’s fundamental frequency, while overtone- 
type crystals are designed for operation at one of the crystal’s overtone frequencies. 
(The fundamental frequency of a crystal is accompanied by harmonics or overtone 
modes, which are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, a crystal 
with a 15- MHz fundamental also will have a 45- MHz third overtone, a 75- MHz fifth 
overtone, a 135- MHz ninth overtone, etc. Figure 10.21 below shows an equivalent RLC 
circuit for a crystal, along with a response curve, both of which take into account the 
overtones.) Fundamental- type crystals are available from around 10 kHz to 30 MHz, 
while overtone- type crystals are available up to a few hundred megahertz. Common 
frequencies available are 100 kHz and 1.0, 2.0, 4, 5, 8, and 10 MHz.

698    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Designing crystal oscillator circuits is similar to designing LC oscillator circuits, 
except that now you replace the LC tank with a crystal. The crystal will supply posi-
tive feedback and gain at its series or parallel resonant frequency, hence leading to 
sustained oscillations. Here are a few basic crystal oscillator circuits to get you started.
The simple op amp circuit shown here resembles the LC oscillator circuit in Fig. 10.16, 
except that it uses the series resonance of the crystal instead of the parallel resonance 
of an LC circuit to provide positive feedback at the desired frequency. Other crystal 
oscillators, such as the Pierce oscillator, Colpitts oscillator, and a CMOS inverter 
oscillator, shown below, also incorporate a crystal as a frequency- determining com-
ponent. The Pierce oscillator, which uses a JFET amplifier stage, employs a crystal as 
a series- resonant feedback element; maximum positive feedback from drain to gate 
occurs only at the crystal’s series- resonant frequency. The Colpitts circuit, unlike the 
Pierce circuit, uses a crystal in the parallel feedback arrangement; maximum base- 
emitter voltage signal occurs at the crystal’s parallel- resonant frequency. The CMOS 
circuit uses a pair of CMOS inverters along with a crystal that acts as a series- resonant 
feedback element; maximum positive feedback occurs at the crystal’s series resonant 
frequency.
FIGURE 10.22
There are a number of ICs available that can make designing crystal oscillators 
a breeze. Some of these ICs, such as the 74S124 TTL VCO (squarewave generator), 
can be programmed by an external crystal to output a waveform whose frequency 
is determined by the crystal’s resonant frequency. The MC12060 VCO, unlike the 
74S124, outputs a pair of sine waves. Check the catalogs to see what other types of 
oscillator ICs are available.
Now there are also crystal oscillator modules that contain everything (crystal and 
all) in one single package. These modules resemble a metal- like DIP package, and they 
are available in many of the standard frequencies (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 16, 24, 25, 50, 
and 64 MHz, etc.). Again, check out the electronics catalogs to see what is available.
10.7  Microcontroller Oscillators
In Chap. 13, we will also see how a microcontroller can be used to generate a wave-
form using a digital-to-analog convertor. The basic technique is to store the wave-
form in memory and then play it through the digital-to-analog converter. 
In the case where just a squarewave is required, a simple 8-pin microcontroller 
with a built-in clock can be an effective alternative to a 555 timer, requiring fewer 
external components.

Circuits usually require a dc power supply that can maintain a fixed voltage while 
supplying enough current to drive a load. Batteries make good dc supplies, but their 
relatively small current capacities make them impractical for driving high- current, 
frequently used circuits. An alternative solution is to take a 120- V ac, 60- Hz line volt-
age and convert it into a usable dc voltage.
There are two approaches to this. The more traditional approach is to use a step-
down transformer. The other approach is to use a “switch-mode” power supply. This 
latter method has all but taken over from step-down transformers in recent years, and 
is the reason your “wall-wart” black plastic power adapters have become smaller and 
lighter. They also have the advantage that they will often work without modification or 
switch flipping on the higher line voltages found in other parts of the world. We’ll dis-
cuss both methods in this chapter, beginning with the step-down transformer approach.
The trick to converting the ac line voltage into a usable (typically lower- level) dc 
voltage is to first use a transformer to step down the ac voltage. After that, the trans-
formed voltage is applied through a rectifier network to get rid of the negative swings 
(or positive swings if you are designing a negative voltage supply). Once the negative 
swings are eliminated, a filter network is used to flatten out the rectified signal into a 
nearly flat (rippled) dc voltage pattern. Figure 11.1 shows the process in action.

Now there is one problem with this supply—it is unregulated. This means that 
if there are any sudden surges within the ac input voltage (spikes, dips, etc.), 
these variations will be expressed at the supply’s output (notice the spike that 
gets through in Fig. 11.1). Using an unregulated supply to run sensitive circuits 
(e.g., digital IC circuits) is a bad idea. The current spikes can lead to improper 
operating characteristics (e.g., false triggering, etc.) and may destroy the ICs in 
the process. An unregulated supply also has a problem maintaining a constant 
output voltage as the load resistance changes. If a highly resistive (low- current) 
load is replaced with a lower- resistance (high- current) load, the unregulated out-
put voltage will drop (Ohm’s law).
Fortunately, there is a special circuit that can be placed across the output of an 
unregulated supply to convert it into a regulated supply—a supply that eliminates 
the spikes and maintains a constant output voltage with load variations (see Fig. 11.2). 
This special circuit is called a voltage regulator.
A voltage regulator is designed to automatically adjust the amount of current 
flowing through a load—so as to maintain a constant output voltage—by comparing 
the supply’s dc output with a fixed or programmed internal reference voltage. 
A simple regulator consists of a sampling circuit, an error amplifier, a conduction 
element, and a voltage reference element (see Fig. 11.3).

Chapter 11: Voltage Regulators and Power Supplies    701
The regulator’s sampling circuit (voltage divider) monitors the output voltage 
by feeding a sample voltage back to the error amplifier. The reference voltage element 
(zener diode) acts to maintain a constant reference voltage that is used by the error 
amplifier. The error amplifier compares the output sample voltage with the reference 
voltage and then generates an error voltage if there is any difference between the two. 
The error amplifier’s output is then fed to the current- control element (transistor), 
which is used to control the load current.
In practice, you do not have to worry about designing voltage- regulator circuits 
from scratch. Instead, what you do is spend 50 cents for a voltage- regulator IC. Let’s 
take a closer look at these integrated devices.
11.1  Voltage- Regulator ICs
There are a number of different kinds of voltage- regulator ICs on the market 
today. Some of these devices are designed to output a fixed positive voltage, some 
are designed to output a fixed negative voltage, and others are designed to be 
adjustable.
11.1.1  Fixed-Regulator ICs
One popular line of regulators includes 
the three- terminal LM78xx series shown 
here. The “xx” digits represent the out-
put voltage, e.g., 7805 (5 V), 7806 (6 V), 
7808 (8 V), 7810 (10 V), 7812 (12 V), 7815 
(15 V), 7818 (18 V), and 7824 (24 V). These 
devices can handle a maximum output 
current of 1.5 A if properly heat- sunk. To 
 remove unwanted input or output spikes/ 
noise, capacitors can be attached to the 
regulator’s input and output terminals, 
as shown in the figure. A popular series 
of negative voltage- regulator IC is the 
LM79xx regulators, where “xx” repre-
sent the negative output voltage. These 
devices can handle a maximum output 
current of 1.5 A. A number of different 
manufacturers make their own kinds of 
voltage regulators. Some of the regula-
tors can handle more current than others.
These devices are also available as 
SMD parts, typically in a SOT-89 package. 
Be sure to check the data sheets though, as 
these parts often have a lower maximum 
output current than their through-hole 
siblings.
Check out the catalogs to see what is 
available.

11.1.3  Regulator Specifications
The specifications tables for regulators typically will provide you with the follow-
ing information: output voltage, accuracy (percent), maximum output current, 
power dissipation, maximum and minimum input voltage, 120- Hz ripple rejection 
(decibels), temperature stability (∆Vout/∆T), and output impedance (at specific fre-
quencies). A regulator’s ripple rejection feature can greatly reduce voltage varia-
tions in a power supply’s output, as you will discover later in this chapter.
A voltage regulator from the 78xx or for that matter, a variable regulator like the 
LM317 needs the input voltage to be at least 2 V higher than the regulated output. 
LDO (Low Drop Out) voltage regulators reduce this 2 V to just 0.5 V in some circum-
stances. This has the advantage that the regulator can run from a lower input voltage 
and therefore run a lot cooler. For an example, LDO regulator take a look at the data 
sheet for an LM2940.
11.2  A Quick Look at a Few Regulator Applications
Before we take a look at how voltage regulators are used in power supplies, it is worth-
while seeing how they are used in other types of applications. Here are a few examples.
11.1.2  Adjustable-Regulator ICs
The LM317 regulator shown here is a popular  
3-terminal adjustable positive voltage regulator. 
Unlike the 7800 fixed voltage-regulator series, 
the LM317 is a floating regulator—it sees only 
the input-to-output differential voltage—and  
it can be programmed via two external resis- 
tors to set the output voltage. In operation, the 
LM317 develops a nominal 1.25 V reference 
voltage between the output and adjust termi-
nals. This reference voltage is impressed across 
program resistor R1, and since this voltage is 
constant, a constant current I1 flows through 
the output set resistor R2, giving an output volt-
age given by the equation shown in the figure. 
Increasing R2 forces the regulator’s output to a 
higher level. The LM317 is designed to accept an 
unregulated input voltage of up to 37 V and can 
output a maximum current of 1.5 A. The TL783 
is another positive adjustable regulator that can 
output a regulated voltage of from 1 to 125 V, 
with a maximum output current of 700 mA. The 
LM337T, unlike the previous two regulators, 
is an adjustable negative voltage regulator. It 
can output a regulated voltage of from –1.2 V to  
–37 V, with a maximum output current of 1.5 A. 
Again, check the electronics catalogs to see what 
other kinds of adjustable regulators are available. 
(Cin should be included if the regulator is far from 
the power source; it should be around 0.1 lF or 
so. Cout is used to eliminate voltage spikes at the 
output; it should be around 0.1 lF or larger.)

The constant current regulator is often used as a power supply for LEDs, espe-
cially the higher-power devices.
11.3  The Transformer
It is important that you choose the right transformer for your power supply. The 
transformer’s secondary voltage should not be much larger than the output volt-
age of the regulator; otherwise, energy will be wasted because the regulator will be 
forced to dissipate heat. However, at the same time, the secondary voltage must not 
drop below the required minimum input voltage of the regulator (typically 2 to 3 V 
above its output voltage).
11.4  Rectifier Packages
Three basic rectifier networks used in power supply designs include the half- wave, 
full- wave, and bridge rectifiers, shown in Fig. 11.7. To understand how these recti-
fiers work, see Chap. 4.
FIGURE 11.6
Half- wave, full- wave, and bridge rectifiers can be constructed entirely from indi-
vidual diodes. However, both full- wave and bridge rectifiers also come in preas-
sembled packages (see Fig. 11.8).

704    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Make sure that the power supply’s rectifier diodes have the proper current and 
peak- inverse- voltage (PIV) ratings. Typical rectifier diodes have current ratings from 
1 to 25 A, PIV ratings from 50 to 1000 V, and surge- current ratings from around 30 to 
400 A. Popular general- purpose rectifier diodes include the 1N4001 to 1N4007 series 
(rated at 1 A, 0.9- V forward voltage drop), the 1N5059 to 1N5062 series (rated at 2 A, 
1.0- V forward voltage drop), the 1N5624 to 1N5627 series (rated at 5 A, 1.0- V forward 
voltage drop), and the 1N1183A- 90A (rated at 40 A, 0.9- V forward voltage drop). For 
low- voltage applications, Schottky barrier rectifiers can be used; the voltage drop 
across these rectifiers is smaller than a typical rectifier (typically less than 0.4 V); how-
ever, their breakdown voltages are significantly smaller. Popular full- wave bridge 
rectifiers include the 3N246 to 3N252 series (rated at 1 A, 0.9- V forward voltage drop) 
and the 3N253 to 3N259 series (rated at 2 A, 0.85- V forward voltage drop).
11.5  A Few Simple Power Supplies
Regulated +5- V Supplies
The first supply uses 
a center- tapped trans-
former rated at 12.6 V 
at 1.2 to 3 A. The volt-
age after rectifi cation 
resides at an 8.9- V  
peak pulse. The filter 
capacitor (C1) smoothes 
the pulses, and the 
7805 outputs a regu-
lated +5 V. C2 is placed 
across the output of 
the  regulator to bypass 
 high- frequency 
noise 
that might be gener-
ated by the load. The 
diode 
placed 
across  
the 7805 helps protect the
FIGURE 11.9
regulator from damaging reverse- current surges generated by the load. Such surges may result 
when the power supply is turned off. For example, the capacitance across the output may dis-
charge more slowly than the capacitance across the input. This would reverse- bias the regulator 
and could damage it in the process. The diode diverts the unwanted current away from the regula-
tor. The second power supply is similar to the first but uses a bridge rectifier.

FIGURE 11.10a  This dual- polarity linear power supply will provide any positive or negative voltage between 1.2 and 
35 V. The complementary regulators—LM317 (+) and LM337 (-)—can deliver up to 1.5 A (output voltage dependent) if 
provided adequate heat sinking. This is sufficient for testing or powering a wide variety of everyday circuits. The key is 
the center- tap transformer with secondary tapped to ground that supplies both positive and negative voltages relative to 
ground. It converts the line voltage from 120 VAC to 48 VAC at the secondary, which is center- tapped and divided into  
24- VAC portions. By using the center tap as a ground or common connection, it is possible to get both positive and nega-
tive outputs relative to ground. The diodes rectify the ac from the transformer output into a pulsing dc waveform. C1 and 
C2 electrolytic capacitors perform bulk filtering of the pulsing dc waveform, resulting in a raw dc voltage. C3 and C4 are 
small film capacitors bypassing the electrolytic capacitors to improve transient response and filter high- frequency line 
noise. The LM317 (+) and LM337 (-) are complementary adjustable voltage regulators, whose output can be programmed 
with two external resistors. The output voltage is given by:

7912 regulators. This circuit is particularly useful when powering op amp circuits.
C5 and C6 improve the regulators’ ripple rejection from 65 dB to 80 dB by preventing ripple voltage from being amplified 
at the output of the regulator. C7 and C8 electrolytic capacitors stiffen the output voltage and reduce output impedance. C9 
and C10 are small bypass capacitors to filter any high- frequency noise present at the output. All bypass capacitors should 
have low impedance (e.g., polyester, polypropylene, polystyrene, or Mylar film capacitors are okay). A 48- VAC CT (24- 0- 24) 
transformer is about the practical upper limit of commonly available models. This limit is set by the maximum input 
 voltage of the regulators, and also by the bulk filter capacitors that are rated at 35 VDC.

11.6  Technical Points about Ripple Reduction
When using a supply to power sensitive circuits, it is essential to keep the variation in 
output voltage as small as possible. For example, when driving digital circuits from 
a 5- V supply, the variation in output voltage should be no more than 5 percent, or 
0.25 V, if not lower. In fact, digital logic circuits usually have a minimum 200- mV 
noise margin around critical logic levels. Small analog signal circuits can be espe-
cially finicky when it comes to output variations. For example, they may require a 
variation less than 1 percent to operate properly. How do you keep the output varia-
tion error low? You use filter capacitors and voltage regulators.
Filter capacitors act to reduce the fluctuations in output by storing charge during 
the positive- going rectifier cycle and then releasing charge through the load—at a 
slow enough rate to maintain a level output voltage—during the  negative- going rec-
tifier cycle. If the filter capacitor is too small, it will not be able to store enough charge 
to maintain the load current and output voltage during the  negative- going cycle.
FIGURE 11.12
As it turns out, the amount of current drawn by a load influences the rate of capaci-
tor discharge. If a low resistance, high- current load is placed across the supply’s output, 
the capacitor will discharge relatively quickly, causing the voltage across the capacitor 
and therefore the voltage across the load to drop relatively quickly. On the other hand, 
a highly resistive, low- current load will cause the capacitor to discharge more slowly, 
which means the dip in output voltage will not be as significant. To calculate the drop 
in voltage of the capacitor during its discharge cycle, use

This figure shows a simple way to add an exter-

device. With no external power (external dc 
adapter plug not connected), the shorting jack 
acts to switch power to the battery. However, 
when external dc power is applied via a dc 
adapter plug, the shorting jack switches power 
from the battery to the dc adapter connects.

to describe the discharge cycle; see Fig. 11.12.) ∆t can be approximated by dividing 1 by 
the rectified output voltage frequency. For a full- wave rectifier, the period is 1/120 Hz, 
or 8.3 × 10−3 s. In reality, the actual amount of time the capacitor spends discharging 
during a peak- to- peak variation is about 5 ms. The other 3.3 ms is used up during the 
charge. To make life easier on you, the following equation simplifies matters:

Note that the ripple voltage is not given in the peak- to- peak form but is given in the 
rms form (recall that V

). To test the equation out, let’s find the ripple voltage 
for a 5- V supply that has a 4700- µF filter capacitor and a maximum load current of 
1.0 A. (Here we are pretending that no voltage regulator is present at this point.) After 
plugging the numbers into the equation, you get Vripple(rms) = 510 mV. But now, recall that 
a minute ago we said that the amount of variation in the output had to be ±0.25 V% 
to run digital ICs—510 mV is too big. Now you could keep fiddling around with the 
capacitance value in the equation and come up with an even better answer, say, let-
ting C equal infinity. In theory, this is fine, but in reality, it is not fine. It is not fine for 
three basic reasons. The first reason has to do with the simple fact that you cannot find 
a capacitor at Radio Shack that has an infinite capacitance. If an infinite- capacitance 
capacitor existed, the universe would not be the same, and you and we probably 
would not be around to talk about it. The second reason has to do with capacitor toler-
ances. Unfortunately, the high- capacity electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies 
have some of the worst tolerances among the capacitor families. It is not uncommon 
to see a 5 to 20 percent or even larger percentage tolerance for these devices. The mere 
fact that the tolerances are so bad makes being “nitpicky” about the equation a ques-
tionable thing to do. The third and perhaps most important reason for avoiding fid-
dling around with the equation too much has to do with the inherent ripple- rejection 
characteristics of voltage regulators. As you will see, the voltage regulator can save us.
Voltage regulators often come with a ripple- rejection parameter given in decibels. 
For example, the 7805 has a ripple- rejection characteristic of about 60 dB. Using the 
attenuation expression, you can find the extent of the ripple reduction:

The last expression says that the output ripple is reduced by a factor of 1000. This 
means that if you use the regulator with the initial setup, you will only have an 
output ripple of 0.51 mV—a value well within the safety limits. At this point, it is 
important to note that the 7805 requires a minimum voltage difference between its 
input and output of 3 V to function properly. This means that to obtain a 5- V output, 
the input to the regulator must be at least 8 V. At the same time, it is important to 
note the voltage drop across the rectifier (typically around 1 to 2 V). The secondary 
voltage from the transformer therefore should be even larger than 8 V. A transformer 
with a secondary voltage of 12 V or so would be a suitable choice for the 5- V supply.

Chapter 11: Voltage Regulators and Power Supplies    709
Now let’s see how well the LM319 adjustable regulator rejects the ripple. Let’s 
say that an LM317 is used in a power supply that has a transformer secondary rms 
voltage of 12.6 V. The capacitor’s peak voltage during a cycle will be 17.8 V (the peak- 
to- peak voltage of the secondary). An LM317 has a ripple- rejection characteristic of 
around 65 dB, but this value can be raised to approximately 80 dB by bypassing the 
LM317’s voltage divider with a 10- µF capacitor (see Fig. 11.13).
A line filter is an LC filter circuit that is inserted 
into a supply to filter out unwanted high- 
frequency interference present in the input line 
supply. Line filters also can help reduce voltage 
spikes, as well as help eliminate the emission 
of radiofrequency interference by the power 
supply. Line filters are placed before the trans-
former, as shown in the figure. AC line filters 
can be purchased in preassembled packages. 
See the electronics catalogs for more info.
A transient suppressor is a device that acts to 
short out when the terminal voltage exceeds safe 
limits (e.g., spikes). These devices act like bidirec-
tional high- power zener diodes. They are inex-
pensive, come in diode- like packages, and come 
with low- voltage and peak- pulse- voltage ratings.

If you let C = 4700 µF and assume a 1.5- A maximum load current, you get a ripple 
voltage of
Vr(rms) = 0.0024 s(1.5 A/4700 µF) = 760 mV
Again, the ripple voltage is too much for sensitive ICs to handle. However, if you con-
sider the LM319’s ripple- rejection characteristic (assuming that you use the bypass-
ing capacitor), you get a reduction of

In other words, the output ripple is reduced by a factor of 10,000, so the final output 
ripple voltage is only 0.076 mV.

11.8  Switching Regulator Supplies (Switchers)
A switching power supply, or switcher, is a unique kind of power supply that can 
achieve power conversion efficiencies far exceeding those of the linear supplies cov-
ered earlier in this chapter. With linear regulated supplies, the regulator converts 
the input voltage that is higher than needed into a desired lower output voltage. To 
lower the voltage, the extra energy is dissipated as heat from the regulator’s con-
trol element. The power- conversion efficiency (Pout/Pin) for these supplies is typically 
lower than 50 percent. This means that more than half the power is dissipated as heat.
Switchers, on the other hand, can achieve power- conversion efficiencies exceeding 
85 percent, meaning that they are much more energy efficient than linearly regulated 
supplies. Switchers also have a wide current and voltage operating range and can be 
configured in either step- down (output voltage smaller than input voltage), step- up 
(output voltage larger than input voltage), or inverting (output is the opposite polar-
ity of the input) configurations. Also, switchers can be designed to run directly off ac 
line power, without the need for a power transformer. By eliminating the hefty power 
Overvoltage Protection
The crowbar and clamp circuits shown here can be placed across the 
output of a regulated supply to protect a load against an unregulated 
voltage that would be present at the output if the voltage regulator 
failed (shorted internally).
CROWBAR
For the crowbar circuit, when the supply voltage exceeds the zener 
 diode’s breakdown voltage by 0.6 V, the zener diode conducts, trigger-
ing the SCR into conduction. The SCR then diverts potentially harmful 
current to ground. The crowbar’s SCR will not turn off until the power 
supply is turned off or the SCR’s anode- to- cathode current is interrupted, 
say, by means of a switch.
CLAMP
A zener diode placed across the output of a supply also can be used for 
overvoltage protection. However, it may “fry” if the unregulated current 
is too large. To avoid frying the zener diode, use a high- power transis-
tor to help divert the current. When the zener diode’s breakdown volt-
age is exceeded, some of the current that flows through it will enter the 
transistor’s base, allowing the excessive current to flow toward ground. 
Using clamps can eliminate false triggering caused by voltage spikes; 
the crowbar, on the other hand, would need to be reset in such a case.
FIGURE 11.15
Bleeder Resistors and Transient Suppressors
When a resistor is placed across the output of the unregulated supply, it 
will act to discharge the high- voltage (potentially lethal) filter capacitor 
when the supply is turned off and the load removed. Such a resistor is 
referred to as a bleeder resistor. A 1- k, 1/2- W resistor is suitable for most 
applications.
An RC network placed across the primary coil of the transformer can 
prevent large, potentially damaging inductive transients from forming 
when the supply is turned off. The capacitor must have a high-voltage 
rating. A typical RC network consists of a 100- W resistor and a 0.1- lF, 
1- kV capacitor. Special z-lead transient suppressor devices can also be 
used, as was mentioned earlier.

transformer, the switcher can be made light and small. This makes switchers good 
supplies for computers and other small devices.
A switching supply resembles a linear supply in many ways. However, two unique 
features include an energy- storage inductor and a nonlinear regulator network. Unlike 
a linear supply, which provides regulation by varying the resistance of the regulator’s 
control element, a switcher incorporates a regulation system in which the control ele-
ment is switched on and off very rapidly. The on/off pulses are controlled by an oscil-
lator/error amplifier/pulse- width modulator network (see Fig. 11.17).
FIGURE 11.17
During the on cycle, energy is pumped into the inductor (energy is stored in the 
magnetic fields about the inductor’s coil). When the control element is turned off, 
the stored energy in the inductor is directed by the diode into the filter and into 
the load. The sampling circuit (R2 and R3) takes a sample of the output voltage and 
feeds the sample to one of the inputs of the error amplifier. The error amplifier then 
compares the sample voltage with a reference voltage applied to its other input. If 
the sample voltage is below the reference voltage, the error amplifier increases its 
output control voltage. This control voltage is then sent to the pulse- width modu-
lator. (If the sample voltage is above the reference voltage, the error amplifier will 
decrease the output voltage it sends to the modulator.) While this is going on, the 
oscillator is supplying a steady series of triggering voltage pulses to the pulse- width 
modulator. The modulator uses both the oscillator’s pulses and the error amplifier’s 
output to produce a modified on/off signal that is sent to the control element’s base. 
The modified signal represents a squarewave whose on time is determined by the 
input error voltage. If the error voltage is low (meaning the sample voltage is higher 
than it should be), the modulator sends a short- duration on pulse to the control ele-
ment. However, if the error voltage is high (meaning the sample voltage is lower 
than it should be), the pulse- width modulator sends a long- duration on pulse to the 
control element. (The graph in Fig. 11.17 shows how the oscillator, error amplifier, 
and pulse- width modulator outputs are related.) Using a series of on/off pulses that 
can be varied in frequency and duration gives the switching regulator its exceptional 
efficiency; releasing a series of short pulses of energy over time is more efficient than 
taking excessive supply energy and radiating it off as heat (linear supply).

712    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Figure 11.18 shows a typical switching regulator arrangement. The 556 dual- timer 
IC houses both the oscillator and pulse- width modulator, while the UA723 voltage- 
regulator IC acts as the error amplifier. R2 and R3 comprise the sampling network, 
R6 and R7 set the reference voltage, and R4 and R5 set the final control voltage that is 
sent to the pulse- width modulator.
FIGURE 11.18
Step- Up, Step- Down, and Inverting Configurations
The switching regulator in Fig. 11.17 is referred to as a step- down regulator. It is used 
when the regulated output voltage is to be lower than the regulator input voltage. 
Now, switching regulators also come in step- up and inverting configurations. The 
step- up version is used when the output is to be higher than the input, whereas  
the inverting version is used when the output voltage is to be the opposite polarity of 
the input voltage. Here’s an overview of the three configurations.
STEP- DOWN REGULATOR
STEP- UP SWITCHER REGULATOR
This is used when output is to be higher than 
input voltage. When the control element is on, 
energy is stored in the inductor. The load, iso-
lated by the diode, is supplied by the charge 
stored in CF. When the control element is off, 
the energy stored in L is added to the input 
voltage. At the same time, L supplies load cur-
rent, as well as restoring the charge on CF —the 
charge on CF is used to supply the load current 
when the control element is off and when the 
energy in L is discharged.

This is used when output voltage is to be lower

is on, L stores energy, helps supply load cur-
rent, and supplies current to the filter capaci-
tor. When the control element is off, the energy 
stored in L helps supply load current but again 
restores charge on CF —the charge on CF is used 
to supply the load when the control element 
turns off and L has discharged its energy.

INVERTING SWITCHER REGULATOR
This is used when output voltage is to be the 
opposite polarity of the input voltage. When 
the control element is on, energy is stored in L, 
while the diode isolates L from load. The load 
current is supplied by the charge on CF. When 
the control element is turned off, the energy 
stored in L charges CF to a polarity such that 
Vout is negative. IL supplies load current and 
restores the charge on CF while it is discharging 
its energy. CF supplies load current when the 
control element is off and the inductor is dis-
charged. An inverting switcher regulator can be 
designed to step up or step down the inverted 
output.
FIGURE 11.21
Switching Regulator ICs
Since switching regulators have become so common, special purpose ICs have been 
developed to simplify circuit design. There are many of these available. Switching 
regulator ICs that operate at higher frequencies use smaller inductors and reduce the 
cost of the design. 
One popular and very easy to use device is the LM2575 which is available in fixed 
and adjustable output versions. Just six components are needed including the regu-
lator IC to produce a 5-V power supply. That’s only three more components than an 
7805. Figure 11.22 shows the schematic for a 5-V regulator using this IC.

11.9  Switch-Mode Power Supplies (SMPS)
The logical extension of a switching regulator is to ditch the transformer entirely and 
work directly from rectified line voltage.
Transformer-based designs have become a rare occurrence in consumer electronics. 
Transformers are relatively expensive and heavy components. Watt for watt, a switch-
mode power supply is generally cheaper to produce.
By using the unique switching action of the switcher, it is possible to design a sup-
ply that does not require the hefty 60- Hz power transformer at the input stage. 

714    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In other words, you can design a switching power supply to run directly off a 120- V 
ac line—you still must rectify and filter the line voltage before feeding it to the regula-
tor. However, if you remove the power transformer, you remove the protective isola-
tion that is present between the 120- V ac line and the dc input to the supply. Without 
the isolation, the dc input voltage will be around 160-V. To avoid this potentially 
“shocking” situation, the switching regulator must be modified. One method for pro-
viding isolation involves replacing the energy- storage inductor with the secondary 
coil of a high- frequency transformer while using another high- frequency transformer 
or optoisolator to link the feedback from the error amplifier to the modulating ele-
ment (see Fig. 11.23).

Now, you may be wondering how removing one transformer and adding another 
transformer (if not two) makes things smaller and lighter. Well, according to the laws 
of physics, as the frequency of an alternating signal increases, the need for a large iron 
core within the transformer decreases. You can use the high- frequency transformer(s) 
because the switcher’s oscillator is beating so fast (e.g., 65 kHz). The difference in size 
and weight between a switching supply that uses high- frequency transformers and 
a supply that uses a 60- Hz power transformer is significant. For example, a 500- W 
switching supply takes up around 640 in3 as compared with 1520 in3 for a linear sup-
ply rated at the same power. Also, switching supplies run cooler than linear supplies. 
In terms of watts per cubic inch, a switching power supply can achieve 0.9 W/in3, 
while a linear supply usually provides 0.4 W/in3.
There is a slight problem with switchers that should be noted. As a result of the 
on/off pulsing action of the switching regulator, a switching supply’s output will 
contain a small switching ripple voltage (typically in the tens of millivolts). Usually 
the ripple voltage does not pose too many problems (e.g., 200- mV noise margins for 
most digital ICs are not exceeded). However, if a circuit is not responding well to the 
ripple, an external high- current, low- pass filter can be added.
11.10  Kinds of Commercial Power Supply Packages
To make life easier, you can forget about designing your own supplies and buy one 
that has been made by the pros. These supplies come in either linear or switcher form 
and come in a variety of different packages. Here are some of the packages that are 
available.

Chapter 11: Voltage Regulators and Power Supplies    715
These are used in low- power applications 
(e.g., ±5, ±10, ±15 V). Supplies are housed in 
small modules, usually around 2.5 ë 3.5 ë 1 in. 
They often come with pinlike leads that can be 
mounted directly into circuit boards or come 
with terminal- strip screw connections along 
their sides. These supplies may come with 
single (e.g., +5 V), dual (e.g., ±15 V), or triple 
(e.g., +5 V, ±15 V) output terminals. Linear 
units have power ratings from around 1 to 10 W, 
while switching units have power ratings from 
around 10 to 25 W. You must supply the fuses, 
switches, and filters.

This supply’s circuit board, transformer, etc. 
are mounted on a metal platform (if it is a

 instrument. These supplies come in linear and 
switching types and come with a wide range 
of voltage, current, and power ratings (around 
10 to 200 W for linear supplies, 20 to 400 W for 
switching supplies). You will probably have to 
supply the fuses, switches, and filters.

These supplies are enclosed in a metal box that 
is especially designed to efficiently radiate off 
excessive heat. They come in both linear and 
switching forms. Power rating ranges from 
around 10 to 800 W for linear supplies and 20 
to 1500 W for switching supplies.

Wall Plug- In
Wall plug- in power supplies (often called 
“ wall-warts”) get inserted directly into an 
ac wall socket. Some of these devices only 
provide ac transformation, others supply an 
unregulated dc voltage, and others supply a 
regulated dc output. Typical output voltages 
include +3, +5, +6, +7.5, +9, +12, and +15 V. They 
also come in dual- polarity form.
FIGURE 11.27
These devices are mostly switched mode, and are manufactured in millions, as they are not spe-
cific to a product. They are small and light, and it is possible to get a unit that can supply 2 A at 
12 V at a cost of less than $10.
This approach is helped by the largely standard 6.3 mm plug for the dc voltage, which, in most 
consumer appliances, has a positive inner connection and a negative outer sheath connection. Note 
that this is often the other way around in musical equipment, such as guitar effects pedals.

CHAPTER 12
12.1  The Basics of Digital Electronics
Until now, we have mainly covered the analog realm of electronics—circuits that accept 
and respond to voltages that vary continuously over a given range. Such analog circuits 
included rectifiers, filters, amplifiers, simple RC timers, oscillators, simple transistor 
switches, and so on. Although each of these analog circuits is fundamentally important 
in its own right, these circuits lack an important feature: they cannot store and process 
bits of information needed to make complex logical decisions. To incorporate logical 
decision-making processes into a circuit, you need to use digital electronics.
This chapter is concerned with laying the foundations of digital electronics. The 
actual implementation of digital electronics these days is either handled by micro-
controllers (see Chap. 13) or programmable logic devices (see Chap. 14).

Before beginning, we must warn you that there is a lot of information in this chapter, and it may be difficult to absorb 
all this at once. Some information is present largely for historical interest and to provide a better understanding of 
how complex digital systems such as microcontrollers work. Our advice is to skim to your heart’s content, and pull out 
whatever information you find practical. The basic principles are still the same, but if you find that your design uses 
more than three ICs, you probably could be using a microcontroller (the subject of Chap. 13).
Digital Electronics
12.1.1  Digital Logic States
In digital electronics, there are only two voltage states present at any point within a 
circuit. These voltage states are either high or low. The voltage being high or low at 
a particular location within a circuit can signify a number of things. For example, it 
may represent the on or off state of a switch or saturated transistor, one bit of a number, 
whether an event has occurred, or whether some action should be taken.

718    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The high and low states can be represented as true and false statements, which are 
used in Boolean logic. In most cases, high equals true and low equals false. However, 
this does not need to be the case—you could make high equal to false and low equal 
to true. The decision to use one convention over the other is a matter left ultimately 
to the designer. In digital lingo, to avoid people getting confused over which conven-
tion is in use, the term positive true logic is used when high equals true, while the term 
negative true logic is used when high equals false.
In Boolean logic, the symbols 1 and 0 are used to represent true and false, respec-
tively. Now, unfortunately, 1 and 0 are also used in electronics to represent high and 
low voltage states, where high equals 1 and low equals 0. As you can see, things can 
get a bit confusing, especially if you are not sure which type of logic convention is 
being used: positive true or negative true logic. In Sec. 12.3, you will see some exam-
ples that deal with this confusing issue.
The exact voltages assigned to high or low voltage states depend on the specific 
logic IC that is used (as it turns out, digital components are IC-based). As a gen-
eral rule of thumb, +5 V is considered high, while 0 V (ground) is considered low. 
However, as you will see in Sec. 12.4, this does not need to be the case. For example, 
some logic ICs may interpret a voltage from +2.4 to +5 V as high and a voltage from 
+0.8 to 0 V as low. Other ICs may use an entirely different range. 
12.1.2  Number Codes Used in Digital Electronics
Binary
Because digital circuits work with only two voltage states, it is logical to use the 
binary number system to keep track of information. A binary number is composed 
of two binary digits, 0 and 1, which are also called bits (for example, 0 = low voltage 
and 1 = high voltage). By contrast, a decimal number such as 736 is represented by 
successive powers of 10:
73610 = 7 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 6 × 100
Similarly, a binary number such as 11100 (2810) can be expressed as successive powers 
of 2: 
111002 = 1 × 24 + 1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 0 × 20
The subscript tells which number system is in use (X10 = decimal number and X2 = 
binary number). The highest-order bit (leftmost bit) is called the most significant 
bit (MSB), while the lowest-order bit (rightmost bit) is called the least significant bit 
(LSB). Methods used to convert from decimal to binary and vice versa are shown in 
Fig. 12.2.
It should be noted that most digital systems deal with 4, 8, 16, or 32 bits at a time. 
The decimal-to-binary conversion example given here has a 7-bit answer. In an 8-bit 
system, you would need to put an additional 0 in front of the MSB (for example, 
01101101). In a 16-bit system, nine additional 0s would need to be added (for exam-
ple, 0000000001101101).

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    719
As a practical note, the easiest way to convert a number from one base to another 
is to use a calculator. For example, to convert a decimal number into a binary num-
ber, type in the decimal number (in base 10 mode) and then change to binary mode 
(which usually entails a second function key). The number will now be in binary (1s 
and 0s). To convert a binary number to a decimal number, start out in binary mode, 
type in the number, and then switch to decimal mode.
Octal and Hexadecimal
Two other number systems used in digital electronics include the octal and hexadeci-
mal systems. In the octal system (base 8), there are 8 allowable digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
and 7. In the hexadecimal system (base 16), there are 16 allowable digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Here are examples of octal and hexadecimal numbers 
with decimal equivalents:
2478 (octal) = 2 × 82 + 4 × 81 + 7 × 80 = 16710 (decimal)
2D516 (hex) = 2 × 162 + D (=1310) × 161 + 9 × 160 = 72510 (decimal)
Of course, binary numbers are the natural choice for digital systems, but since 
these binary numbers can become long and difficult to interpret by our decimal-
based brains (a result of our ten fingers), it is common to write them out in hexadeci-
mal or octal form. 
Unlike decimal numbers, octal and hexadecimal numbers can be translated eas-
ily to and from binary. This is because a binary number, no matter how long, can be 
broken up into 3-bit groupings (for octal) or 4-bit groupings (for hexadecimal). You 
simply add zero to the beginning of the binary number if the total numbers of bits is 
not divisible by 3 or 4. Figure 12.3 should paint the picture better than words.

720    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Today, the hexadecimal system has essentially replaced the octal system. The octal 
system was popular at one time, when microprocessor systems used 12-bit and 36-bit 
words, along with a 6-bit alphanumeric code, which are all divisible by 3-bit units 
(1 octal digit). Today, microprocessor systems mainly work with 8-bit, 16-bit, 20-bit, 
32-bit, or 64-bit words, which are all divisible by 4-bit units (1 hex digit). In other 
words, an 8-bit word can be broken down into 2 hex digits, a 16-bit word into 4 hex 
digits, a 20-bit word into 5 hex digits, and so on. 
Hexadecimal representation of binary numbers pops up in many memory and 
microprocessor applications that use programming codes (for example, within 
assembly language) to address memory locations and initiate other specialized tasks 
that would otherwise require typing in long binary numbers. For example, a 20-bit 
address code used to identify one of a million memory locations can be replaced with 
a hexadecimal code (in the assembly program) that reduces the count to five hex dig-
its. Note that a compiler program later converts the hex numbers within the assembly 
language program into binary numbers (machine code), which the microprocessor 
can use. Table 12.1 shows a conversion table.

Binary-Coded Decimal
Binary-coded decimal (BCD) is used to represent each digit of a decimal number as a 
4-bit binary number. For example, the number 15010 in BCD is expressed as follows:
  1  5  0 
15010 = 0001 0101 000(BCD)
 /  |  \
0001 0101 000
To convert from BCD to binary is vastly more difficult, as shown in Fig. 12.4. 
Of course, you could cheat by converting the BCD into decimal first and then convert 
to binary, but that does not show you the mechanics of how machines do things with 
1s and 0s. You will rarely need to do BCD-to-binary conversion, so we will not dwell 
on this topic.

BCD is commonly used when outputting to decimal (0–9) displays, such as those 
found in digital clocks and multimeters. BCD will be discussed in Sec. 12.3.
Sign-Magnitude and 2’s Complement Numbers
Up to now, we have not considered negative binary numbers. How do you represent 
them? A simple method is to use sign-magnitude representation. In this method, you 
simply reserve a bit, usually the MSB, to act as a sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the num-
ber is positive; if the sign bit is 1, the number is negative (see Fig. 12.5). 
Although the sign-magnitude representation is simple, it is seldom used, because 
adding requires a different procedure than subtracting (as you will see in the next 
section). Occasionally, you will see sign-magnitude numbers used in display and 
analog-to-digital applications, but you will hardly ever see them in circuits that per-
form arithmetic.
A more popular choice when dealing with negative numbers is to use 2’s comple-
ment representation. In 2’s complement, the positive numbers are exactly the same as 
unsigned binary numbers. A negative number, however, is represented by a binary 
number, which when added to its corresponding positive equivalent results in zero. 
In this way, you can avoid two separate procedures for doing addition and subtrac-
tion. You will see how this works in the next section. A simple procedure outlining 

722    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
how to convert a decimal number into a binary number and then into a 2’s comple-
ment number, and vice versa, is outlined in Fig. 12.5.

Decimal to 2's complement
If the decimal number is positive, the 2's complement
number is equal to the true binary equivalent of the
decimal number.
If the decimal number is negative, the 2's complement
number is found by:
1)  Complementing each bit of the true binary
equivalent of the decimal (making 1's into 0's and vice
versa).  This is is called taking the 1's complement.
2)  Adding 1 to the 1's complement number to get the
magnitude bits.  The sign bit will always end up being 1.
2's complement to decimal
If the 2's complement number is positive (sign bit = 0),
perform a regular binary-to-decimal conversion.
If the 2's complement number is negative (sign bit =
1), the decimal sign will be negative.  The decimal is
found by:
1)  Complementing each bit of the 2's complement
number.
2)  Adding 1 to get the true binary equivalent.
3)  Performing a true binary-to-decimal conversion,
and including negative sign.

Arithmetic with Binary Numbers
Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing binary numbers, hexadecimal num-
bers, and other representations can be done with a calculator set to that particular base 
mode. But that’s cheating, and it doesn’t help you understand the mechanics of how 
it is done. The mechanics become important when designing the actual arithmetical 
circuits. Here are the basic techniques used to add and subtract binary numbers.
ADDING
Adding binary numbers is just like adding decimal numbers. When-
ever the result of adding one column of numbers is greater than one 
digit, a 1 is carried over to the next column to be added.

Subtracting binary numbers is not as easy as it looks. It is similar to 
decimal subtraction but can be confusing. For example, you might 
think that if you were to subtract a 1 from a 0, you would borrow a 1 
from the column to the left. No! You must borrow a 10 (210). It becomes 
a headache if you try to do this by hand. The trick to subtracting binary 
numbers is to use the 2’s complement representation that provides 
the sign bit, and then just add the positive number with the negative 
number to get the sum. This method is often used by digital circuits 
because it allows both addition and subtraction, without the headache 
of needing to subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

ASCII
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an alphanumeric 
code used to transmit letters, symbols, numbers, and special nonprinting characters 
between computers and computer peripherals (such as printers and keyboards). 
ASCII consists of 128 different 7-bit codes. 
Codes from 000 0000 (or hex 00) to 001 1111 (or hex 1F) are reserved for nonprint-
ing characters or special machine commands like ESC (escape), DEL (delete), CR (car-
riage return), and LF (line feed). Codes from 010 0000 (or hex 20) to 111 1111 (or hex 
7F) are reserved for printing characters like a, A, #, &, {, @, and 3. Tables 12.2 and 12.3 
show the ASCII nonprinting and printing characters. 
In practice, when ASCII code is sent, an additional bit is added to make it compatible 
with 8-bit systems. This bit may be set to 0 and ignored, it may be used as a parity bit for 
error detection (Sec. 12.3.8 covers parity bits), or it may act as a special function bit used 
to implement an additional set of specialized characters.

12.1.3  Clock Timing and Parallel versus Serial Transmission
Before moving on to the next section, let’s take a brief look at three important items: 
clock timing, parallel transmission, and serial transmission.
Clock Timing
Most digital circuits require precise timing to 
function properly. Usually, a clock circuit that 
generates a series of high and low pulses at a 
fixed frequency is used as a reference on which 
to base all critical actions executed within a 
system. The clock is also used to push bits of 
data through the digital circuitry. The period  
of a clock pulse is related to its frequency 
by T = 1/f. So, if T = 10 ns, then f = 1/(10 ns) = 
100 MHz.

Serial versus Parallel Representation
Binary information can be transmitted from one location to another in either a serial 
or parallel manner. The serial format uses a single electrical conductor (and a com-
mon ground) for data transfer. Each bit from the binary number occupies a separate 
clock period, with the change from one bit to another occurring at each falling or 
leading clock edge; the type of edge depends on the circuitry used. 
Figure 12.9 shows an 8-bit (10110010) word that is transmitted from circuit A to 
circuit B in 8 clock pulses (0–7). In computer systems, serial communications are used 
to transfer data between keyboard and computer, as well as to transfer data between 
two computers via a telephone line.

data
Parallel transmission uses separate electrical conductors for each bit (and a com-
mon ground). In Fig. 12.9, an 8-bit string (01110110) is sent from circuit A to circuit B. As 
you can see, unlike serial transmission, the entire word is transmitted in only one clock 
cycle, not eight clock cycles. In other words, it is eight times faster. Parallel communica-
tions are most frequently found within microprocessor systems that use multiline data 
and control buses to transmit data and control instructions from the microprocessor to 
other microprocessor-based devices (such as memory and output registers).

12.2  Logic Gates
Logic gates are the building blocks of digital electronics. The fundamental logic gates 
include the INVERT (NOT), AND, NAND, OR, NOR, exclusive OR (XOR), and exclu-
sive NOR (XNOR) gates. Each of these gates performs a different logical operation. 
Figure 12.10 provides a description of what each logic gate does and gives a switch 
and transistor analogy for each gate.

12.2.1  Multiple-Input Logic Gates
AND, NAND, OR, and NOR gates often come with more than two inputs (this is not 
the case with XOR and XNOR gates, which require two inputs only). Figure 12.11 
shows a four-input AND, an eight-input AND, a three-input OR, and an eight-input 
OR gate. With the eight-input AND gate, all inputs must be high for the output to 
be high. With the eight-input OR gate, at least one of the inputs must be high for the 
output to go high.

12.2.2  Digital Logic Gate ICs
As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the use of individual logic ICs 
has almost completely been superseded by the use of microcontrollers, the program-
mable logic devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, one 
or two logic ICs are still often used together in simple applications. 
There are a number of technologies used in the fabrication of digital logic. The 
most popular technology is complementary MOSFET (CMOS) logic.
A logic IC typically houses more than one logic gate (for example, a quad two-
input NAND, hex inverter, and so on). Each of the gates within the IC shares a 
common supply voltage that is implemented via two supply pins: a positive sup-
ply pin (+VCC or +VDD) and a ground pin (GND). The most popular “HC” range of 
digital logic gate ICs will operate from a supply of 2-6 V with 5 V being something 
of a standard operating voltage as a relic from the age of transistor-transistor 
logic (TTL).
Generally speaking, input and output voltage levels are assumed to be 0 V (low) 
and +5 V (high). However, the actual input voltage required and the actual out-
put voltage provided by the gate are not set in stone. For example, the 74HCxx 
series will recognize a high input from 2.5 to 5 V and a low from 0 to 2.1 V. 
However, for the CMOS 4000B series (VCC = +5 V), recognizable input voltages 
range from 3.3 to 5 V for high and 0 to 1.7 V for low. Guaranteed high and low 
output levels range from 4.9 to 5 V and 0 to 0.1 V, respectively. Again, we will 
discuss specifics later in Sec. 12.4. For now, let’s just get acquainted with what 
some of these ICs look like, as shown in Figs. 12.12 and 12.13. The CMOS devices 
listed in the figures include 74HCxx and 4000(B). The TTL devices shown include 
the 74xx, 74Fxx, and 74LS.

12.2.3  Applications for a Single Logic Gate
Before we jump into the heart of logic gate applications that involve combining logic 
gates to form complex decision-making circuits, let’s take a look at a few simple 
applications that require the use of a single logic gate.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    729
Enable/Disable Control
An enable/disable gate is a logic gate that acts to control the passage of a given 
waveform. The waveform—say, a clock signal—is applied to one of the gate’s inputs, 
while the other input acts as the enable/disable control lead. Enable/disable gates 
are used frequently in digital systems to enable and disable control information from 
reaching various devices. Figure 12.14 shows two enable/disable circuits: the first 
uses an AND gate, and the second uses an OR gate. NAND and NOR gates are also 
frequently used as enable gates.
In the upper part of the figure, an AND gate 
acts as the enable gate. When the input enable 
lead is made high, the clock signal will pass to 
the output. In this example, the input enable 
is held high for 4 ls, allowing 4 clock pulses 
(where Tclk = 1 ls) to pass. When the input 
enable lead is low, the gate is disabled, and no 
clock pulses make it through to the output.
Below, an OR gate is used as the enable 
gate. The output is held high when the input 
enable lead is high, even as the clock signal is 
varying. However, when the enable input is 
low, the clock pulses are passed to the output.

Waveform Generation
By using the basic enable/disable function of a logic gate, as illustrated in the previ-
ous example, it is possible, with the help of a repetitive waveform generator circuit, 
to create specialized waveforms that can be used for the digital control of sequencing 
circuits. 
An example waveform generator circuit is the Johnson counter. The Johnson 
counter will be discussed in Sec. 12.8. For now, let’s simply focus on the outputs. 
In Fig. 12.15, a Johnson counter uses clock pulses to generate different output

waveforms, as shown in the timing diagram. Outputs A, B, C, and D go high for 4 
µs (four clock periods) and are offset from each other by 1 µs. Outputs A, B, C,  and 
D produce waveforms that are complements of outputs A, B, C, and D, respectively.
Now, there may be certain applications that require 4-µs high/low pulses applied 
at a given time, as the counter provides. However, what would you do if the applica-
tion requires a 3-µs high waveform that begins at 2 µs and ends at 5 µs (relative to the 
time scale indicated in Fig. 12.15)? This is where the logic gates come in handy. For 
example, if you attach an AND gate’s inputs to the counter’s A and B outputs, you 
will get the desired 2- to 5-µs high waveform at the AND gate’s output: from 1 to 
2 µs the AND gate outputs a low (A = 1, B = 0), from 2 to 5 µs the AND gate outputs 
a high (A = 1, B = 1), and from 5 to 6 µs the AND gate outputs a low (A = 0, B = 1). See 
the leftmost area of Fig. 12.16.

Other possible connections and waveforms
Various other specialized waveforms can be generated by using different logic 
gates and tapping different outputs of the Johnson shift counter. In Fig. 12.16, six 
other possibilities are shown.
12.2.4  Combinational Logic
Combinational logic involves combining logic gates together to form circuits capable 
of enacting more useful, complex functions. For example, let’s design the logic used 
to instruct a janitor-type robot to recharge itself (seek out a power outlet) only when a 
specific set of conditions is met. The “recharge itself” condition is specified as follows: 
Either its battery is low (indicated by a high output signal from a battery-monitor 
circuit) 
OR 
The workday is over (indicated by a high output signal from a timer circuit)] 
OR 
[When vacuuming is complete (indicated by a high voltage output from a vacuum- 
completion monitor circuit) 
AND 
When waxing is complete (indicated by a high output signal from a wax- 
completion monitor circuit)]

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    731
Let’s also assume that the power-outlet-seeking routine circuit is activated when 
a high is applied to its input.
Two simple combinational circuits that perform the desired logic function for 
the robot are shown in Fig. 12.17. The two circuits use a different number of gates 
but perform the same function. Now, the question remains, how did we come up 
with these circuits? In either circuit, it is not hard to predict which gates are needed. 
You simply exchange the word and present within the conditional statement with 
an AND gate within the logic circuit, and exchange the word or present within the 
conditional statement with an OR gate within the logic circuit. Common sense takes 
care of the rest.

However, when you begin designing more complex circuits, using intuition to 
figure out what kind of logic gates to use and how to join them together becomes 
exceedingly difficult. To make designing combinational circuits easier, a special sym-
bolic language called Boolean algebra is used, which uses only true and false variables. 
A Boolean expression for the robot circuit would appear as follows:
 
E = (B + T) + VW
This expression amounts to saying that if B (battery-check circuit’s output) or T 
(timer circuit’s output) is true, or V and W (vacuum and waxing circuit outputs) are 
true, then E (enact power-outlet circuit input) is true. 
Note that the word or is replaced by the symbol +, and the word and is simply 
expressed in a way similar to multiplying two variables together (placing them side 
by side or using a dot between variables). Also note that the term true in Boolean 
algebra is expressed as a 1, and false is expressed as a 0. Here, we are assuming 
positive logic, where true equals high voltage. Using the Boolean expression for the 

732    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
robot circuit, we can come up with some of the following results (the truth table in 
Fig. 12.17 provides all possible results):
E = (B + T) + VW
E = (1 + 1) + (1 · 1) = 1 + 1 = 1     (battery is low, time to sleep, finished with chores = 
go recharge)
E = (1 + 0) + (0 · 0) = 1 + 0 = 1    (battery is low = go recharge)
E = (0 + 0) + (1 · 0) = 0 + 0 = 0    (hasn’t finished waxing = don’t recharge yet)
E = (0 + 0) + (1 · 1) = 0 + 1 = 1    (has finished all chores = go recharge)
E = (0 + 0) + (0 · 0) = 0 + 0 = 0     (hasn’t finished vacuuming and waxing = don’t 
recharge yet)
The robot example showed you how to express AND and OR functions in 
Boolean algebraic terms. But what about the negation operations (NOT, NAND, and 
NOR) and the exclusive operations (XOR and XNOR)? How do you express these in 
Boolean terms? 
• For a NOT condition, place a line over the NOT’ed variable or variables. 
• For a NAND expression, place a line over an AND expression. 
• For a NOR expression, place a line over an OR expression. 
• For exclusive operations, use the symbol ⊕. 
Figure 12.18 shows a rundown of all the possible Boolean expressions for the vari-
ous logic gates.

Boolean expressions for the logic gates
Like conventional algebra, Boolean algebra has a set of logic identities that can 
be used to simplify the Boolean expressions and thus make circuits more compact. 
These identities go by names such as the commutative law of addition, associate law of 
addition, and distributive law. Instead of worrying about what the various identities 
are called, simply make reference to the list of identities provided on the next page. 
Most of these identities are self-explanatory, although a few are not so obvious, as 
you will see in a minute. The various circuits in Fig. 12.19 show some of the identities 
in action.

Dealing with Exclusive Gates (Identities 22 and 23)
Now let’s take a look at a couple of not-so-obvious logic identities: those that 
involve the XOR (Identity 22) and XNOR (Identity 23) gates. The leftmost section 
in Fig. 12.21 shows equivalent circuits for the XOR gate. In the lower two equivalent 
circuits, Identity 22 is proved by Boolean reduction. Equivalent circuits for the XNOR 
gate are shown in the rightmost section of the figure. To prove Identity 23, you can 
simply invert Identity 22.

De Morgan’s Theorem (Identities 18 and 19)
To simplify circuits containing NANDs and NORs, you can use an incredibly use-
ful theorem known as De Morgan’s theorem. This theorem allows you to convert an 
expression having an inversion bar over two or more variables into an expression 
having inversion bars over single variables only. De Morgan’s theorem (Identities 18 
and 19) is as follows:

The easiest way to prove that these identities are correct is to use Fig. 12.22, 
noting that the truth tables for the equivalent circuits are the same. Note the inver-
sion bubbles present on the inputs of the corresponding leftmost gates. The inver-
sion bubbles mean that before inputs A and B are applied to the base gate, they 
are inverted (negated). In other words, the bubbles are simplified expressions for 
NOT gates.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    735
Why do you use the inverted-input OR gate symbol instead of a NAND gate 
symbol? Or why would you use the inverted-input AND gate symbol instead of a 
NOR gate symbol? This is left up to the designer to choose whatever symbol seems 
most logical to use. For example, when designing a circuit, it may be easier to think 
about ORing or ANDing inverted inputs than to think about NANDing or NORing 
inputs. Similarly, it may be easier to create truth tables or work with Boolean expres-
sions using the inverted-input gate. It is typically easier to create truth tables and 
Boolean expressions that do not have variables joined under a common inversion 
bar. Of course, when it comes time to construct the actual working circuit, you prob-
ably will want to convert to the NAND and NOR gates because they do not require 
additional NOT gates at their inputs.
Bubble Pushing
A shortcut method for forming equivalent logic circuits, based on De Morgan’s 
theorem, is to use what’s called bubble pushing.
Bubble pushing involves the following tricks: 
• Change an AND gate to an OR gate or change an OR gate to an AND gate. 
• Add inversion bubbles to the inputs and outputs where there were none, while 
removing the original bubbles. 
That’s it. You can prove to yourself that this works by examining the correspond-
ing truth tables for the original gate and the bubble-pushed gate, or you can work out 
the Boolean expressions using De Morgan’s theorem. Figure 12.23 shows examples 
of bubble pushing.

Universal Capability of NAND and NOR Gates
NAND and NOR gates are referred to as universal gates because each alone can be 
combined together with itself to form all other possible logic gates. The ability 
to create any logic gate from NAND or NOR gates is obviously a handy feature.

For example, if you do not have an XOR IC handy, you can use a single multigate 
NAND gate (such as 74HC00) instead. Figure 12.24 shows how to wire NAND or 
NOR gates together to create equivalent circuits of the various logic gates.

AND-OR-INVERTER Gates
When a Boolean expression is reduced, the equation that is left over typically will 
be of one of the following two forms: product of sums (POS) or sum of products (SOP). 
A POS expression appears as two or more OR'ed variables AND'ed together with 
two or more additional OR'ed variables. An SOP expression appears as two or more 
AND'ed variables OR'ed together with additional AND'ed variables. Figure 12.25 
shows two circuits that provide the same logic function (they are equivalent), but the 
circuit to the left is designed to yield a POS expression, while the circuit to the right 
is designed to yield a SOP expression.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    737
Which circuit is best for design: the one that implements the POS expression or 
the one that implements the SOP expression? The POS design shown here would 
appear to be the better choice because it requires fewer gates. However, the SOP 
design is nice because it is easy to work with the Boolean expression. For example, 
which Boolean expression in Fig. 12.25 (POS or SOP) would you rather use to create 
a truth table? The SOP expression seems the obvious choice. 
A more down-to-earth reason for using an SOP design has to do with the fact 
that special ICs called AND-OR-INVERTER (AOI) gates are designed to handle SOP 
expressions. For example, the 74LS54 AOI IC shown in Fig. 12.26 creates an inverted 
SOP expression at its output, via two two-input AND gates and two three-input 
AND gates NOR'ed together. A NOT gate can be attached to the output to get rid 
of the inversion bar, if desired. If specific inputs are not used, they should be held 
high, as shown in the example circuit in Fig. 12.26. AOI ICs come in many different 
configurations—check out the catalogs to see what’s available.

We have just covered how using the logic identities can simplify a Boolean expres-
sion. This is important because it reduces the number of gates needed to construct 
the logic circuit. However, as we are sure you will agree, having to work out Boolean 
problems in longhand is not easy. It takes time and ingenuity. A simple way to avoid 
the unpleasant task of using your ingenuity is to get a computer program that accepts 
a truth table or Boolean expression, and then provides you with the simplest expres-
sion, and perhaps even the circuit schematic.
However, let’s assume that you do not have such a program to help you out. 
Are you stuck with the Boolean longhand approach? No. You can use a technique 
referred to as Karnaugh mapping. With this technique, you take a given truth table 
(or Boolean expression that can be converted into a truth table), convert it into a 
Karnaugh map, apply some simple graphic rules, and come up with the simplest 
(most of the time) possible Boolean expression for your final circuit. Karnaugh 
mapping works best for circuits with three to four inputs—below this, things 
usually do not require much thought anyway; beyond four inputs, things get 
quite tricky. 
Here’s a basic outline showing how to apply Karnaugh mapping to a three-input 
system:
 1. Select a desired truth table. Let’s choose the one shown in Fig. 12.27. (If you have a 
Boolean expression, transform it into an SOP expression and use the SOP expres-
sion to create the truth table.)
FIGURE 12.27

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    739
 2. Translate the truth table into a Karnaugh map. A Karnaugh map is similar to a 
truth table but has its variables represented along two axes. Translating the truth 
table into a Karnaugh map reduces the number of 1s and 0s needed to present the 
information. Figure 12.27 shows how the translation is carried out.
 3. After you create the Karnaugh map, you can proceed to encircle adjacent cells of 
1s into groups of 2, 4, 8, …, 2n. The more cells you can encircle in one grouping the 
simpler the final equation will be. You are not allowed to encircle 0s nor allowed 
to make diagonal loops. Every 1 must be in at least one group. Overlapping and 
wrapping around map are allowed.
 4. Identify the variable that remain constant within each loop, and write out an SOP 
equation by OR’ing these variables together. Here, constant means that a vari-
able and its inverse are not present together within the loop. For example, in 
Figure 12.27 section 3, the loop that contains four 1s is reduced to B because B = 0 
throughout the loop, while A and B aren’t constant because they take on values of 
0 and 1 throughout that loop. (If a variable is constant 0, the final expression is the 
inverse of that variable; if the variable is constant 1 throughout the loop, the final 
expression is the non-inverted variable.)
 5. The SOP expression you end up with is the simplest possible expression. With it, 
you can create your logic circuit. You may need to apply some bubble pushing to 
make the final circuit practical, as shown in Fig. 12.27.
To apply Karnaugh mapping to four-input circuits, you apply the same basic 
steps used in the three-input scheme. However, now you must use a 4 × 4 Karnaugh 
map to hold all the necessary information. Figure 12.28 shows an example of how a 
four-input truth table (or unsimplified fourvariable SOP expression) can be mapped 
and converted into a simplified SOP expression that can be used to create the final 
logic circuit.

Other Looping Configurations
Figure 12.30 shows examples of other looping arrangements used with 4 × 4 Karnaugh 
maps.
FIGURE 12.29
Figure 12.29 shows and example that uses an AOI IC to implement the final SOP 
expression after mapping.
If you want to make your life easier, try one of the free online Karnaugh mapping 
calculators. Do a Google search for “Karnaugh Map Explorer 2.0”. This tool will save 
you the hassle of having to draw maps and apply looping tricks yourself. You simply 
enter values into a truth table (or into the Karnaugh map) and the program calculates 
the final logical expression.
12.3  Combinational Devices
Now that you know a little something about how to use logic gates to enact functions 
represented within truth tables and Boolean expressions, it is time to take a look at 
some common functions that are used in the real world of digital electronics. As you 
will see, these functions are usually carried out by an IC that contains all the neces-
sary logic.
As with almost everything discussed in this chapter, before using these ideas, 
you need to ask yourself if using a microcontroller would be more appropriate. 
However, many of the devices described here can be used with a microcontroller, 
especially when it comes to decoders. They can be a useful and low-cost solution 
for tasks such as driving more LEDs than there are pins on the microcontroller that 
you are using.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    741
A word on IC part numbers before we begin. As with the logic gate ICs, the com-
binational ICs that follow will be of either the 4000 or 7400 series. It is important to 
note that an original TTL IC, like the 74138, is essentially the same device (usually 
with the same pinouts and function, but not always) as its newer counterparts, such 
as the 74F138, 74HC128 (CMOS), and 74LS138. The practical difference resides in the 
overall performance of the device (speed, power dissipation, voltage level rating, and 
so on). We will get into these gory details in a bit.

12.3.1  Multiplexers (Data Selectors) and Bilateral Switches
Multiplexers or data selectors act as digitally controlled switches. The term data 
selector appears to be the accepted term when the device is designed to act like an 
SPDT switch, while the term multiplexer is used when the throw count of the switch 
exceeds two, such as an SP8T. We will stick with this convention (although others 
may not). 
A simple 1-of-2 data selector built from logic gates is shown in Fig. 12.32. The 
data select input of this circuit acts to control which input (A or B) gets passed to the 
output: When data select is low, input A passes while B is blocked. When data select 
is high, input B is passed while A is blocked. To understand how this circuit works, 
think of the AND gates as enable gates.

742    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
There are a number of different types of data selectors that come in IC form. For 
example, the 74LS157 quad 1-of-2 data selector IC, shown in Fig. 12.32, acts like an 
electrically controlled quad SPDT switch (or if you like, a 4PDT switch). When its 
select input is set high (1), inputs A1, A2, A3, and A4 are allowed to pass to outputs Q1, 
Q2, Q3, and Q4. When its select input is low (0), inputs B1, B2, B3, and B4 are allowed to 
pass to outputs Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. Either of these two conditions, however, ultimately 
depends on the state of the enable input.
When the enable input is low, all data-input signals are allowed to pass to the 
output; however, if the enable is high, the signals are not allowed to pass. This type of 
enable control is referred to as active-low enable, since the active function (passing the 
data to the output) occurs only with a low-level input voltage. The active-low input is 
denoted with a bubble (inversion bubble), and the outer label of the active-low input 
is represented with a line over it. Sometimes people omit the bubble and place a bar 
over the inner label. Both conventions are used commonly.
Figure 12.33 shows a 4-line-to-1-line multiplexer built with logic gates. This cir-
cuit resembles the 2-of-1 data selector shown in Fig. 12.32 but requires an additional 
select input to provide four address combinations.

When enable (E ) is set HIGH (1), all

FIGURE 12.33
In terms of ICs, there are multiplexers of various input line capacities. For exam-
ple, the 74151 8-line-to-1-line multiplexer uses three select inputs (S0, S1, S2) to choose 
among one of eight possible data inputs (I0 to I7) to be funneled to the output. Note that 
this device actually has two outputs: one true (pin 5) and one inverted (pin 6). The 
active-low enable forces the true output low when set high, regardless of the inputs.
To create a larger multiplexer, you combine two smaller multiplexers together. 
For example, Fig. 12.34 shows two 8-line-to-1-line 74HC151s combined to create a 
16-line-to-1-line multiplexer. Another alternative is to use a 16-line-to-1-line multi-
plexer IC like the 74HC150 shown in the figure. Check the catalogs to see what other 
kinds of multiplexers are available.
Finally, let’s take a look at a very useful device called a bilateral switch. An example 
bilateral switch IC is the 4066, shown to the far right in Fig. 12.32. Unlike the mul-
tiplexer, this device merely acts as a digitally controlled quad SPST switch or quad 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    743
transmission gate. Using a digital control input, you select which switches are on 
and which switches are off. To turn on a given switch, apply a high level to the cor-
responding switch select input; otherwise, keep the select input low.
In Sec. 12.9, we will look at analog switches and multiplexers. These devices use 
digital select inputs to control analog signals. Analog switches and multiplexers 
become important when you start linking the digital world to the analog world.
12.3.2  Demultiplexers (Data Distributors) and Decoders
A demultiplexer (or data distributor) is the opposite of a multiplexer. It takes a single 
data input and routes it to one of several possible outputs. A simple four-line demul-
tiplexer built from logic gates is shown on the left side of Fig. 12.35. To select the 
output (A, B, C, or D) to which you want to send the input signal (applied at E), you 
apply logic levels to the data select inputs (S0, S1), as shown in the truth table.

744    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Notice that the unselected outputs assume a high level, while the selected output 
varies with the input signal. An IC that contains two functionally separate four-line 
demultiplexers is the 74HC139, shown on the right side of Fig. 12.35. If you need 
more outputs, check out the 75xx154 16-line demultiplexer. This IC uses four data 
select inputs to choose from 1 of 16 possible outputs. Check out the catalogs to see 
what other demultiplexers exist.
A decoder is somewhat like a demultiplexer, but it does not route input data to 
a specific output via data select inputs. Instead, it simply uses the data select inputs 
to choose which output (or outputs) among many are to be made high or low. The 
number of address inputs, the number of outputs, and the active state of the selected 
output vary from decoder to decoder. The variance is based on what the decoder is 
designed to do. For example, the 74LS138 1-of-8 decoder shown in Fig. 12.36 uses a 
3-bit address input to select which of eight outputs will be made low; all other out-
puts are held high. Like the demultiplexer in Fig. 12.35, this decoder has active-low 
outputs.

Now what exactly does it mean to say an output is an active-low output? It simply 
means that when an active-low output is selected, it is forced to a low logic state; oth-
erwise, it is held high. Active-high outputs behave in the opposite manner. An active-
low output is usually indicated with a bubble, although sometimes it is indicated with 
a barred variable within the IC logic symbol—no bubble included. Active-high out-
puts have no bubbles. Both active-low and active-high outputs are equally common 
among ICs. 
By placing a load (for example, a warning LED) between +VCC and an active-low 
output, you can sink current through the load and into the active-low output when 
the output is selected. By placing a load between an active-high output and ground, 
you can source current from the active-high output and sink it through the load when 
the output is selected. The limits to how much current an IC can source or sink will 
be discussed in Sec. 12.4, and various schemes used to drive analog loads will be 
presented in Sec. 12.9.

Now let’s get back to the 74LS138 decoder and discuss the remaining enable 
inputs E E E
(

 For the 74LS138 to “decode,” you must make the active-low 
inputs E0  and E1 low, while making the active-high input E2 high. If any other set of 
enable inputs is applied, the decoder is disabled, making all active-low outputs high 
regardless of the selected inputs.
Other common decoders include the 7442 BCD-to-DEC (decimal) decoder, the 
74154 1-of-16 (hex) decoder, and the 7447 BCD-to-seven-segment decoder shown in 
Figure 12.37. Like the preceding decoder, these devices also have active-low outputs. 
The 7442 uses a binary-coded decimal input to select 1 of 10 (0 through 9) possible 
outputs. The 74154 uses a 4-bit binary input to address 1 of 16 (0 through 15) outputs, 
making that output low (all others high), provided the enables are both set low.

BCD-to DEC decoder
Now the 7447 is a bit different from the other decoders. With this device, more 
than one output can be driven low at a time. This is important because it allows the 
7447 to drive a seven-segment LED display; to create different numbers requires driv-
ing more than one LED segment at a time. For example, in Fig. 12.38, when the BCD 
number for 5 (0101) is applied to the 7447’s inputs, all outputs except b and e go low. 
This causes LED segments a, c, d, f, and g to light up—the 7447 sinks current through 
these LED segments, as indicated by the internal wiring of the display and the truth 
table.

The 7447 also comes with a lamp test active-low input (
)
LT that can be used 
to drive all LED segments at once to see if any of the segments are faulty. The 
ripple blanking input (
)
RBI and ripple blanking output (
)
RBO can be used in multi-
stage display applications to suppress a leading-edge and/or trailing-edge zero in a 
multidigit decimal. For example, using the ripple blanking inputs and outputs, it is 
possible to take an eight-digit expression like 0056.020 and display 56.02, suppress-
ing the two leading zeros and the one trailing zero. Leading-edge zero suppression is 
obtained by connecting the ripple blanking output of a decoder to the ripple blanking 
input of the next lower-stage device. The most significant decoder stage should have 
its ripple blanking input grounded. A similar procedure is used to provide automatic 
suppression of trailing zeros in the fractional part of the decimal.
12.3.3  Encoders and Code Converters
Encoders are the opposite of decoders. They are used to generate a coded output 
from a single active numeric input. To illustrate this in a simple manner, let’s take a 
look at the simple decimal-to-BCD encoder circuit shown in Fig. 12.39.

Simple decimal-to-BCD encoder
Truth table
In this circuit, normally all lines are held high by the pullup resistors connected to 
+5 V. To generate a BCD output that is equivalent to a single selected decimal input, 
the switch corresponding to that decimal is closed. (The switch acts as an active-low 
input.) The truth table in Fig. 12.39 explains the rest.
Figure 12.40 shows a 74LS147 decimal-to-BCD (ten-line-to-four-line) priority 
encoder IC. The 74LS147 provides the same basic function as the circuit shown in 
Fig. 12.39, but it has active-low outputs. This means that instead of getting an LLHH 
output when 3 is selected, as in the previous encoder, you get HHLL. The two out-
puts represent the same thing (3); one is expressed in positive true logic, and the 
other (the 74LS147) is expressed in negative true logic. If you do not like negative 
true logic, you can slap inverters on the outputs of the 74LS147 to get positive true logic. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    747
The choice to use positive or negative true logic really depends on what you are plan-
ning to drive. For example, negative true logic is useful when the device that you 
wish to drive uses active-low inputs.
Another important difference between the two encoders is the priority that is 
used with the 74LS147 and not used with the encoder in Fig. 12.39. The term priority is 
applied to the 74LS147 because this encoder is designed so that if two or more inputs 
are selected at the same time, it will select only the larger-order digit. For example, if 
3, 5, and 8 are selected at the same time, only the 8 (negative true BCD LHHH or 0111) 
will be output. The truth table in Fig. 12.40 demonstrates this; look at the “don’t care” 
or “X” entries. With the nonpriority encoder, if two or more inputs are applied at the 
same time, the output will be unpredictable.
The circuit shown in Fig. 12.41 provides a simple illustration of how an encoder 
and a decoder can be used together to drive an LED display via a 0 through 9 keypad. 
The 74LS147 encodes a keypad’s input into BCD (negative logic). A set of inverters 
then converts the negative true BCD into positive true BCD. The transformed BCD is 
then fed into a 7447 seven-segment LED display decoder/driver IC.
Figure 12.42 shows a 74148 octal-to-binary priory encoder IC. It is used to trans-
form a specified single octal input into a binary 3-bit output code. As with the 74LS147, 
the 74148 comes with a priority feature, so if two or more inputs are selected at the 
same time, only the higher-order number is selected.
A high applied to the input enable ( )
EI  forces all outputs to their inactive (high) 
state and allows new data to settle without producing erroneous information at the 
outputs. A group signal output (
)
GS  and an enable output (
)
EO  are also provided to 
allow for system expansion. The GS  output is active level low when any input is low

(active). The EO  output is low (active) when all inputs are high. Using the output 
enable along with the input enable allows priority coding of N input signals. Both EO  
and GS  are active high when the input enable is high (device disabled).
Figure 12.43 shows a 74184 BCD-to-binary converter (encoder) IC. This device 
has eight active-high outputs (Y1 – Y8). Outputs Y1 to Y5 are outputs for regular BCD-
to-binary conversion, while outputs Y6 to Y8 are used for a special BDC code called 
nine’s complement and ten’s complement. The active-high BCD code is applied to inputs 
A through E. TheG input is an active-low enable input.
A sample 6-bit BCD-to-binary converter and a sample 8-bit BCD-to-binary con-
verter that use the 74184 are shown to the right in Fig. 12.43. In the 6-bit circuit, since 
the LSB of the BCD input is always equal to the LSB of the binary output, the connec-
tion is made straight from input to output. The other BCD bits are applied directly to 
inputs A through E. The binary weighing factors for each input are A = 2, B = 4, C = 8, 
D = 10, and E = 20. Because only 2 bits are available for the MSD BCD input, the larg-
est BCD digit in that position is 3 (binary 11). To get a complete 8-bit BCD converter, 
you connect two 74184s together, as shown to the far right in Fig. 12.43.

12.3.4  Binary Adders
If you find yourself needing to do arithmetic in logic, then that is a pretty sure sign 
that you need to use a microcontroller. However, that microcontroller will contain 
exactly the sort of logic that we describe here in its arithmetic logic unit (ALU), so it 
is instructive to see how it works under the hood.
With a few logic gates, you can create a circuit that adds binary numbers. The 
mechanics of adding binary numbers is basically the same as that of adding decimal 
numbers. When the first digit of a two-digit number is added, a 1 is carried and 
added to the next row whenever the count exceeds binary 2 (for example., 1 + 1 = 10, 
or = 0 carry a 1). For numbers with more digits, you have multiple carry bits. 

750    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To demonstrate how you can use logic gates to perform basic addition, start 
out by considering the half-adder circuits in Fig. 12.45. Both half-adders shown are 
equivalent; one simply uses XOR/AND logic, while the other uses NOR/AND logic. 
The half-adder adds two single-bit numbers A and B and produces a 2-bit number. 
The LSB is represented as Σ0, and the MSB, or carry bit, is represented as Cout.
The most complicated operation the half-adder can do is 1 + 1. To perform addi-
tion on a two-digit number, you must attach a full-adder circuit (shown in Fig. 12.45) 
to the output of the half-adder. The full-adder has three inputs: two to input the 
second digits of the two binary numbers (A1, B1), and another that accepts the carry 
bit from the half-adder (the circuit that added the first digits, A0 and B0, of the two 
numbers). The two outputs of the full-adder will provide the 2d-place digit sum Σ1 
and another carry bit that acts as the third-place digit of the final sum. Now, you can 
keep adding more full-adders to the half-adder/full-adder combination to add larger 
numbers, linking the carry bit output of the first full-adder to the next full-adder, and 
so forth. To illustrate this point, a 4-bit adder is shown in Fig. 12.45.

A number of 4-bit full-adder ICs are available, such as the 74LS283 and 4008. 
These devices will add two 4-bit binary numbers and provide an additional input 
carry bit, as well as an output carry bit, so you can stack them together to get adders 
that are 8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit, and so on. For example, Fig. 12.46 shows an 8-bit adder 
made by cascading two 74LS283 4-bit adders.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    751
12.3.5  Binary Adder/Subtractor
Figure 12.47 shows how two 74LS283 4-bit adders can be combined with an XOR 
array to yield an 8-bit 2’s complement adder/subtractor. The first number X is 
applied to the X0 through X7 inputs, while the second number Y is applied to the Y0 
through Y7 inputs.

To add X and Y, the add/subtract switch is thrown to the add position, making 
one input of all XOR gates low. This has the effect of making the XOR gates appear 
transparent, allowing Y values to pass to the 74LS283s’ B inputs (X values are passed 
to the A inputs). The 8-bit adder then adds the numbers and presents the result to the 
Σ outputs.
To subtract Y from X, you must first convert Y into 1’s complement form; then you 
must add 1 to get Y into 2’s complement form. After that you simply add X to the 2’s 
complemented form of Y to get X−Y. When the add/subtract switch is thrown to the 
subtract position, one input to each XOR gate is set high. This causes the Y bits that 
are applied to the other XOR inputs to become inverted at the XOR outputs—you 
have just taken the 1’s complement of Y. The 1’s complement bits of Y are then pre-
sented to the inputs of the 8-bit adder. At the same time, Cin of the left 74LS283 is set 
high via the wire (see Fig. 12.47) so that a 1 is added to the 1’s complement number 
to yield a 2’s complement number. The 8-bit adder then adds X and the 2’s comple-
ment of Y together. The final result is presented at the Σ outputs. In the figure, 76 is 
subtracted from 28.
12.3.6  Comparators and Magnitude Comparator ICs
A digital comparator is a circuit that accepts two binary numbers and determines 
whether the two numbers are equal. For example, Fig. 12.48 shows a 1-bit and a 4-bit 
comparator. The 1-bit comparator outputs a high (1) only when the two 1-bit num-
bers A and B are equal. If A is not equal to B, then the output goes low (0). The 4-bit 
is basically four 1-bit comparators in one. When all individual digits of each number 
are equal, all XOR gates output a high, which in turn enables the AND gate, making 

752    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
the output high. If any two corresponding digits of the two numbers are not equal, 
the output goes low.
Now, say you want to know which number, A or B, is larger. The circuits in 
Fig. 12.48 will not do the trick. What you need instead is a magnitude comparator like the 
74HC85 shown in Fig. 12.49. This device not only tells you if two numbers are equal, 
but also which number is larger. For example, if you apply a 1001 (910) to the A3A2A1A0 
inputs and a second number 1100 (1210) to the B3B2B1B0 inputs, the A < B output will 
go high (the other two outputs, A > B and A = B, will remain low). If A and B were 
equal, the A = B output would have gone high, and so on. If you wanted to compare 
larger numbers—say, two 8-bit numbers—you simply cascade two 74HC85 compara-
tors together, as shown on the right side of Fig. 12.49. The leftmost 74HC85 compares 
the lower-order bits, while the rightmost 74HC85 compares the higher-order bits. To 
link the two devices together, you connect the output of the lower-order device to 
the expansion inputs of the higher-order device, as shown. The lower-order device’s 
expansion inputs are always set low (IA < B), high (IA = B), and low (IA > B).

12.3.7  A Note on Obsolescence and the  
Trend Toward Microcontroller Control
We have just covered most of the combinational devices you will find discussed in 
textbooks and listed within electronic catalogs. Many of these devices are still used. 
However, some devices, such as the binary adders and code converters, are obsolete.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    753
Today, the trend is to use software-controlled devices such as microcontrollers and 
FPGAs to carry out arithmetic operations and code conversions. Before you attempt 
to design any logic circuit, we suggest reading Chaps. 12 and 13 first.
Microcontrollers can be used to collect data, store data, and perform logical opera-
tions using the input data. They also can generate output signals that can be used to 
control displays, audio devices, stepper motors, servos, and so on. The specific func-
tions a microcontroller is designed to perform depend on the program you store in 
its internal ROM-type memory.
Programming the microcontroller typically involves simply using a special pro-
gramming unit provided by the manufacturer. The programming unit usually con-
sists of a prototyping platform that is linked to a host computer (via a USB port) 
that is running a development environment. In the development environment, you 
typically write out a program in a high-level language such as C, or some other spe-
cialized language designed for a certain microcontroller, and then, with the press of 
a key, the program is converted into machine language (1s and 0s) and downloaded 
into the microcontroller’s memory.
In many applications, a single microcontroller can replace entire logic circuits 
composed of numerous discrete components.
Replacing logic circuits with a microcontroller is almost certainly going to be very 
cost-effective as small microcontrollers often cost less than a dollar. However, replac-
ing physical logic with a program does have performance differences. It certainly 
won’t be as fast.
For systems where performance is important, FPGAs are probably a better 
approach. These are configured using either a logic gate schematic or a special pur-
pose hardware description logic, and provide the flexibility of a microcontroller 
without sacrificing the raw speed of an implementation in logic gate ICs.
12.4  Logic Families
These days, pretty much all logic gates use CMOS technology.
In general, ICs made from MOSFET transistors use less space due to their simpler 
construction, have very high noise immunity, and consume less power than equiva-
lent bipolar transistor ICs. Historically, the high-input impedance and input capaci-
tance of the MOSFET transistors (due to their insulated gate leads) result in longer 
time constants for transistor on/off switching speeds when compared with bipolar 
gates, and therefore typically result in a slower device. Over years of development, 
however, the CMOS technology has overtaken other technologies.
Both the bipolar and MOSFET logic families can be divided into a number of 
subclasses and from a historical perspective, it is useful to see where we have come 
from and some of the more exotic technologies that exist. The major subclasses of the 
bipolar family include transistor-transistor logic (TTL), emitter-coupled logic (ECL), 
and integrated-injection logic (IIL or I2L). The major subclasses of the MOSFET logic 
include P-channel MOSFET (PMOS), N-channel MOSFET (NMOS), and complemen-
tary MOSFET (CMOS). CMOS uses both NMOS and PMOS technologies. The two 
most popular technologies are TTL and CMOS. The other technologies are typically 
used in large-scale integration devices, such as microprocessors and memories. There 
are new technologies popping up all the time, which yield faster, more energy-efficient 

754    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
devices. Some examples include BiCMOS, GaAS, SOS, and Josephson junction 
technologies.
As you have already learned, digital logic ICs are grouped into functional cat-
egories that get placed into either the 74HC00 or 4000 or 4000 CMOS series (or the 
improved 4000B series).
12.4.1  CMOS Family of ICs
While the 7400 series was going through its various transformations toward CMOS 
technology, the CMOS series entered the picture. The original CMOS 4000 series 
(or the improved 4000B series) was developed to offer lower power consump-
tion than the TTL series of devices—a feature made possible by the high input 
impedance characteristics of its MOSFET transistors. The 4000B series also offered 
a larger supply voltage range (3 to 18 V), with minimum logic high = 2⁄3VDD and 
maximum logic low = 1⁄3VDD. The 4000B series, though more energy efficient than 
the TTL series, was significantly slower and more susceptible to damage due to 
electrostatic discharge. Figure 12.51 shows the internal circuitry of CMOS NAND, 
AND, and NOR gates. To figure out how the gates work, apply high (logic 1) or 
low (logic 0) levels to the inputs and see which transistor gates turn on and which 
transistor gates turn off.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    755
A further improvement in speed over the original 4000B series came with the 
introduction of the 40H00 series. Although this series was faster than the 4000B series, 
it was not quite as fast as the 74LS TTL series. The 74C CMOS series also emerged on 
the scene, which was designed specifically to be pin-compatible with the TTL line. 
Another significant improvement in the CMOS family came with the develop-
ment of the 74HC and the 74HCT series. Both these series, like the 74C series, were 
pin-compatible with the TTL 74 series. The 74HC (high-speed CMOS) series had the 
same speed as the 74LS, as well as the traditional CMOS low-power consumption. 
The 74HCT (high-speed CMOS TTL compatible) series was developed to be inter-
changeable with TTL devices (same I/O voltage level characteristics). The 74HC 
series is very popular today. 
Still further improvements in 74HC/74HCT series led to the advanced CMOS 
logic (74AC/74ACT) series. The 74AC (advanced CMOS) series approached speeds 
comparable with the 74F TTL series, while the 74ACT (advanced CMOS TTL compat-
ible) series was designed to be TTL compatible.
12.4.2  I/O Voltages and Noise Margins
The exact input voltage levels required for a logic IC to perceive a high (logic 1) or 
low (logic 0) input level differ between the various logic families. At the same time, 
the high and low output levels provided by a logic IC vary among the logic families. 
For example, Fig. 12.52 shows valid input and output voltage levels for the 74HC 
(CMOS) families.
In Fig. 12.52, the voltage ranges are represented as follows:
• VIH represents the valid voltage range that will be interpreted as a high logic input 
level.
• VIL represents the valid voltage range that will be interpreted as a low logic input 
level.
• VOL represents the valid voltage range that will be guaranteed as a low logic output 
level.
• VOH represents the valid voltage range that will be guaranteed as a high logic out-
put level.

12.4.3  Current Ratings, Fanout, and Propagation Delays
Logic IC inputs and outputs can sink or source only a given amount of current. IIL 
is defined as the maximum low-level input current, IIH as the maximum high-level 
input current, IOH as the maximum high-level output current, and IOL as the maxi-
mum low-level output current.
The limit to how much current a device can sink or source determines the size of 
loads that can be attached. The term fanout is used to specify the total number of gates 
that can be driven by a single gate of the same family without exceeding the current 
rating of the gate. The fanout is determined by taking the smaller result of IOL/IIL or 
IOH/IIH. For the 7HC, it is around 50.

12.5.1  Power Supply Decoupling
When a logic device makes a low-to-high or a high-to-low level transition, there is an 
interval during which the conduction times in the upper and lower totem-pole out-
put transistors overlap. During this interval, a drastic change in power supply cur-
rent occurs, which results in a sharp, high-frequency current spike within the supply 
line. If a number of other devices are linked to the same supply, the unwanted spike 
can cause false triggering of these devices. The spike also can generate unwanted 
electromagnetic radiation. 
To avoid unwanted spikes within logic systems, decoupling capacitors can be 
used. A decoupling capacitor, typically multilayer ceramic, from 0.01 to 0.1 µF (>5 V), 
is placed directly across the VCC-to-ground pins of each IC in the system. The capaci-
tors absorb the spikes and keep the VCC level at each IC constant, thus reducing the 
likelihood of false triggering and generally electromagnetic radiation. Decoupling 
capacitors should be placed as close to the ICs as possible to keep current spikes local, 
instead of allowing them to propagate back toward the power supply. You can usu-
ally get by with using one decoupling capacitor for every five to ten gates or one for 
every five counter or register ICs.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    757
12.5.2  Unused Inputs
Unused inputs that affect the logical state of a chip should not be allowed to float. 
Instead, they should be tied high or low, as necessary (floating inputs are liable to pick 
up external electrical noise, which leads to erratic output behavior). For example, a 
four-input NAND gate that uses only two inputs should have its two unused inputs 
held high to maintain proper logic operation. A three-input NOR gate that uses only 
two inputs should have its unused input held low to maintain proper logic operation. 
Likewise, the CLEAR and PRESET inputs of a flip-flop should be grounded or tied 
high, as appropriate.
If there are unused sections within an IC (for example, unused logic gates 
within a multigate package), the inputs that link to these sections may pick up 
unwanted charge and may reach a voltage level that causes output MOS transis-
tors to conduct simultaneously, resulting in a large internal current spike from the 
supply (VDD) to ground. The result can lead to excessive supply current drain and 
IC damage. To avoid this fate, inputs of unused sections of a CMOS IC should be 
grounded. Figure 12.54 illustrates what to do with unused inputs for NAND and 
NOR ICs.

As a last note of caution, never drive CMOS inputs when the IC’s supply voltage 
is removed. Doing so can damage the IC’s input protection diodes.
12.5.3  Logic Probes and Logic Pulsers
Two simple tools used to test logic ICs and circuits include the test probe and logic 
pulser, as shown in Fig. 12.55.
A typical logic probe comes in a pen-like package, with metal probe tip and power 
supply wires: one red and one black. Red is connected to the positive supply voltage 
of the digital circuit (VCC), and black is connected to the ground (VSS) of the circuit. To 
test a logic state within a circuit, the metal tip of the probe is applied. If a high voltage 
is detected, the probe’s high LED lights up; if a low voltage is detected, the probe’s 
low LED turns off. 

758    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Along with performing simple static tests, logic probes can perform a few simple 
dynamic tests, such as detecting a single momentary pulse that is too fast for the 
human eye to detect or detecting a pulse train, such as a clock signal. To detect a 
single pulse, the probe’s PULSE/MEMORY switch is thrown to the MEMORY posi-
tion. When a single pulse is detected, the internal memory circuit remembers the 
single pulse and lights up both the HI LED and PULSE LED at the same time. To clear 
the memory to detect a new single pulse, the PULSE/MEMORY switch is toggled. To 
detect a pulse train, the PULSE/MEMORY switch is thrown to the PULSE position. 
When a pulse train is detected, the PULSE LED flashes on and off. 
Logic probes usually will detect single pulses with widths as narrow as 10 ns and 
will detect pulse trains with frequencies around 100 MHz. Check the specifications 
that come with your probe to determine these minimum and maximum limits.
A logic pulser allows you to send a single logic pulse or a pulse train through an 
IC and circuits, where the results of the applied pulses can be monitored by a logic 
probe. Like a logic probe, the pulser comes with similar supply leads. To send a single 
pulse, the SINGLE-PULSE/PULSE-TRAIN switch is set to SINGLE-PULSE, and then 
the SINGLE-PULSE button is pressed. To send a pulse train, switch to PULSE-TRAIN 
mode. With the pulser model shown in Fig. 12.55, you get to select either 1 pulse per 
second (pps) or 500 pps.
12.6  Sequential Logic
The combinational circuits covered previously (encoders, decoders, multiplexers, 
parity generators/checkers, and so on) have the property of input-to-output imme-
diacy. This means that when input data is applied to a combinational circuit, the 
output responds almost immediately. Now, combinational circuits lack a very impor-
tant characteristic: they cannot store information. A digital device that cannot store 
information is not very interesting, practically speaking.
To provide “memory” to circuits, you must create devices that can latch onto data 
at a desired moment in time. The realm of digital electronics devoted to this subject 
is referred to as sequential logic. This branch of electronics is referred to as sequential 
because for data bits to be stored and retrieved, a series of steps must occur in a par-
ticular order. For example, a typical set of steps might involve first sending an enable

pulse to a storage device, and then loading a group of data bits all at once (paral-
lel load), or perhaps loading a group of data bits in a serial manner, which takes a 
number of individual steps. At a later time, the data bits may need to be retrieved by 
first applying a control pulse to the storage device. A series of other pulses might be 
required to force the bits out of the storage device.
To push bits through sequential circuits usually requires a clock generator. The 
clock generator is similar to the human heart. It generates a series of high and low 
voltages (analogous to a series of high and low pressures as the heart pumps blood) 
that can set bits into action. The clock also acts as a time base on which all sequential 
actions can be referenced. Clock generators will be discussed in detail in Sec. 12.6.7. 
Now, let’s take a look at the most elementary of sequential devices: the SR flip-flop.
12.6.1  SR Flip-Flops
The most elementary data-storage circuit is the set-reset (SR) flip-flop, also referred to 
as a transparent latch. There are two basic kinds of SR flip-flops: the cross-NOR SR 
flip-flop and the cross-NAND SR flip-flop.
Consider the cross-NOR SR flip-flop shown in Fig. 12.56. At first, it appears that 
figuring out what the cross-NOR SR flip-flop does given only two input voltages is 
impossible, since the NOR gates’ inputs depend on the outputs, and what are the 
outputs anyway? (For now, pretend that Q andQ are not complements but separate 
variables; you could call them X and Y if you like.) Well, first of all, you know that a 
NOR gate will output a high (logic 1) only if both inputs are low (logic 0). From this, 
you can deduce that if S = 1 and R = 0, Q must be 1 andQ must be 0, regardless of the 
outputs. This is called the set condition. Likewise, by similar argument, we can deduce 
that if S = 0 and R = 1, Q must be 0 andQ must be 1. This is called the reset condition.

But now, what about R = 0 and S = 0? Can you predict the outputs given only 
input levels? No! It is impossible to predict the outputs because the outputs are essen-
tial for predicting the outputs—it is a “catch-22.” However, if you know the states of 
the outputs beforehand, you can figure things out. For example, if you first set the 
flip-flop (S = 1, R = 0, Q = 1, Q = 0), and then apply S = 0, R = 0, the flip-flop would 
remain set (upper gate: S = 0, Q = 1 → Q  = 0; lower gate: R = 0, Q  = 0 → Q = 1). 
Likewise, if you start out in reset mode (S = 0, R = 1, Q = 0, Q  = 0), and then apply 
S = 0, R = 0, the flip-flop remains in reset mode (upper gate: S = 0, Q = 0 → Q  = 1; 
lower gate: R = 0, Q  =1 → Q = 0). In other words, the flip-flop remembers, or latches 
onto, the previous output state even when both inputs go low (0). This is referred to 
as the hold condition.
The last choice you have is S = 1, R = 1. Here, it is easy to predict what will happen 
because you know that as long as there is at least one high (1) applied to the input to 
the NOR gate, the output will always be 0. Therefore, Q = 0 and Q  = 0. Now, there 
are two fundamental problems with the S = 1, R = 1 state. First, why would you want 
to set and reset at the same time? Second, when you return to the hold condition from 
S = 1, R = 1, you get an unpredictable result, unless you know which input returned 
low last. Why? When the inputs are brought back to the hold position (R = 0, S = 0, 
Q = 0, Q  = 0), both NOR gates will want to be 1 (they want to be held). But let’s say 
one of the NOR gate’s outputs changes to 1 a fraction of a second before the other. In 
this case, the slower flip-flop will not output a 1 as planned, but will instead output 0.  
This is a classic example of a race condition, where the slower gate loses. But which 
flip-flop is the slower one? This unstable, unpredictable state cannot be avoided and 
is simply not used.
The cross-NAND SR flip-flop provides the same basic function as the NOR SR 
flip-flop, but there is a fundamental difference: its hold and indeterminate states are 
reversed. This occurs because, unlike the NOR gate, which outputs a high only when 
both its inputs are low, the NAND gate outputs a low only when both its inputs high. 
This means that the hold condition for the cross-NAND SR flip-flop is ˉS = 1, ˉR = 1, 
while the indeterminate condition is ˉS = 0, ˉR = 0.
Now let’s look at two simple applications for SR flip-flops.
Switch Debouncer
Say you want to use the far-left switch/pullup resistor circuit (see Fig. 12.57) to drive 
an AND gate’s input high or low (the other input is fixed high). When the switch 
is open, the AND gate should receive a high. When the switch is closed, the gate

should receive a low. That’s what should happen, but that’s not what actually hap-
pens. Why? Because of switch bounce.
When a switch is closed, the metal contacts bounce a number of times before 
coming to rest due to inherent springlike characteristics of the contacts. Though the 
bouncing typically lasts no more than 50 ms, the results can lead to unwanted false 
triggering, as shown in the far left circuit in Fig. 12.57. 
A simple way to get rid of switch bounce is to use the switch debouncer circuit, 
shown at center of Fig. 12.57. This circuit uses an SR flip-flop to store the initial switch 
contact voltage while ignoring all trailing bounces. In this circuit, when the switch is 
thrown from the B to A position, the flip-flop is set. As the switch bounces alternately 
high and low, the Q output remains high, because when the switch contact bounces 
away from A, the S input receives a low (R is low, too), but that’s just a hold condi-
tion; the output stays the same. The same debouncing feature occurs when the switch 
is thrown from position A to B.
Latched Temperature or Light Alarm
The simple circuit in Fig. 12.57 uses an SR flip-flop to sound a buzzer alarm when the 
temperature (when using a thermistor) or the light intensity (when using a photore-
sistor) reaches a critical level. When the temperature or light increases, the resistance 
of the thermistor or photoresistor decreases, and the R input voltage goes down. 
When the R input voltage goes below the high threshold level of the NAND gate, the 
flip-flop is set, and the alarm is sounded. The alarm will continue to sound until the 
RESET switch is pressed and the temperature or light level has gone below the critical 
triggering level. The pot is used to adjust this level.
Level-Triggered SR Flip-Flop (the Beginning of Clocked Flip-Flops)
Now it would be nice to make an SR flip-flop synchronous; that is, make the S and 
R inputs either enabled or disabled by a control pulse, such as a clock. Only when 
the clock pulse arrives are the inputs sampled. Flip-flops that respond in this manner are 
referred to as synchronous or clocked flip-flops (as opposed to the preceding asynchronous 
flip-flops). 
To make the preceding SR flip-flop into a synchronous or clocked device, simply 
attach enable gates to the inputs of the flip-flop, as shown in Fig. 12.58. The figure shows 
the cross-NAND arrangement, but a cross-NOR arrangement also can be used. In this 
setup, only when the clock is high are the S and R inputs enabled. When the clock is 
low, the inputs are disabled, and the flip-flop is placed in hold mode. The truth table 
and timing diagram in Fig. 12.58 help illustrate how this device works.

Edge-Triggered SR Flip-Flops
The level-triggered SR flip-flop has an annoying feature: its S and R inputs must be 
held at the desired input condition (set, reset, or no change) for the entire time that 
the clock signal is enabling the flip-flop. With a slight alteration, however, you can 
make the level-triggered flip-flop more flexible (in terms of timing control) by turn-
ing it into an edge-triggered flip-flop. 
An edge-triggered flip-flop samples the inputs only during either a positive or 
negative clock edge (↑ = positive edge, ↓ = negative edge). Any changes that occur 
before or after the clock edge are ignored—the flip-flop will be placed in hold mode. 
To make an edge-triggered flip-flop, introduce either a positive or a negative 
level-triggered clock pulse generator network into the previous level-triggered flip-
flop, as shown in Fig. 12.59.

FIGURE 12.59
In a positive edge-triggered generator circuit, a NOT gate with a propagation 
delay is added. Since the clock signal is delayed through the inverter, the output of 
the AND gate will not provide a low (as would be the case without a propagation 
delay), but will provide a pulse that begins at the positive edge of the clock signal and 
lasts for a duration equal to the propagation delay of the NOT gate. It is this pulse 
that is used to clock the flip-flop. 
Within the negative edge-triggered generator network, the clock signal is first 
inverted and then applied through the same NOT/AND network. The pulse begins 
at the negative edge of the clock and lasts for a duration equal to the propagation 
delay of the NOT gate. The propagation delay is typically so small (in nanoseconds) 
that the pulse is essentially an “edge.”
Pulse-Triggered SR Flip-Flops
A pulse-triggered SR flip-flop is a level-clocked flip-flop; however, for any change 
in output to occur, both the high and low levels of the clock must rise and fall. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    763
Pulse-triggered flip-flops are also called master-slave flip-flops; the master accepts the 
initial inputs and then “whips” the slave with its output when the negative clock 
edge arrives. Another analogy often used is to say that during the positive edge, the 
master gets cocked (like a gun), and during the negative clock edge, the slave gets 
triggered. Figure 12.60 shows a simplified pulse-triggered cross-NAND SR flip-flop.

The master is simply a clocked SR flip-flop that is enabled during the high clock 
pulse and outputs Y and Y  (set, reset, or no change). The slave is similar to the mas-
ter, but it is enabled only during the negative clock pulse (due to the inverter). The 
moment the slave is enabled, it uses the Y and Y  outputs of the master as inputs, and 
then outputs the final result.
Notice the preset

(
)  and clear CLR
(
) inputs. These are called asynchronous 
inputs. Unlike the synchronous inputs, S and R, the asynchronous inputs disregard 
the clock and either clear (also called asynchronous reset) or preset (also called asyn-
chronous set) the flip-flop. When - CLR is high and PRE is low, you get asynchronous 
reset, Q = 1, Q  = 0, regardless of the CLK, S, and R inputs. These active-low inputs 
are therefore normally pulled high to make them inactive. The ability to apply asyn-
chronous set and resets is often used to clear entire registers that consist of an array 
of flip-flops.
General Rules for Deciphering Flip-Flop Logic Symbols
Typically, you do not need to worry about constructing flip-flops from scratch. 
Instead, you buy flip-flop ICs, as discussed in the next section. Likewise, you do 
not need to worry about complex logic gate schematics. Instead, you use symbolic 
representations like the ones shown in Fig. 12.61. Although the symbols in the figure 
apply to SR flip-flops, the basic rules that are outlined can be applied to the D and JK 
flip-flops, which are discussed in the following sections.
12.6.2  SR Flip-Flop ICs
Occasionally, it can make sense to use a sequential logic IC rather than a microcon-
troller or FPGA, but gradually if you require more than one or two ICs, you should

flip-flop (latch) ICs. Always remember that switch debouncing with hardware logic 
costs money to make, but software switch debouncing for a switch connected to a 
microcontroller is free. It’s just an extra line or two of program code. The 74LS279A 
contains four independent SR latches (note that two of the latches have an EXTRA SET 
INPUT). This IC is commonly used in switch debouncers.

4044 Quad 3-state NAND SR latch
A LOW enable input effectively disconnects the latch states from the Q outputs, resulting in an open-circuit
condition or high-impedance (Z) state at the Q outputs.
FIGURE 12.62
The 4043 contains four three-state cross-coupled NOR SR latches. Each latch 
has individual set and reset inputs, as well as separate Q outputs. The three-state 
feature is an extra bonus, which allows you to effectively disconnect all Q outputs, 
making it appear that the outputs are open circuits (high impedance, or high Z). 
This three-state feature is often used in applications where a number of devices 
must share a common data bus. When the output data from one latch is applied 
to the bus, the outputs of other latches (or other devices) are disconnected via the 
high-Z condition. The 4044 is similar to the 4043 but contains four three-state cross-
coupled NAND RS latches.
12.6.3  D-Type Flip-Flops
A D-type flip-flop (data flip-flop) is a single input device. It is basically an SR 
flip-flop, where S is replaced with D and R is replaced with D  (inverted D). The 
inverted input is tapped from the D input through an inverter to the R input, as shown 
in Fig. 12.63. The inverter ensures that the indeterminate condition (race, or not used 
state, S = 1, R = 1) never occurs. At the same time, the inverter eliminates the hold

condition so that you are left with only set (D = 1) and reset (D = 0) conditions. The 
circuit in Fig. 12.63 represents a level-triggered D-type flip-flop.
To create a clocked D-type level-triggered flip-flop, first start with the clocked 
level-triggered SR flip-flop and throw in the inverter, as shown in Fig. 12.64.

Note the lowercase letters l and h in the truth table in this figure. The h is similar to 
the H for a high voltage level, and the l is similar to the L for low voltage level; how-
ever, there is an additional condition that must be met for the flip-flop’s output to do 
what the truth table indicates. The additional condition is that the D input must be 
fixed high (or low) in duration for at least one setup time (ts) before the positive clock 
edge. This condition stems from the real-life propagation delays present in flip-flop 
ICs. If you try to make the flip-flop switch states too fast (do not give it time to move 
electrons around), you can end up with inaccurate output readings. For the 7474, the 
setup time is 20 ns. Therefore, when using this IC, you must not apply input pulses 
that are within the 20-ns limit. Other flip-flops will have different setup times, so you 
will need to check the manufacturer’s data sheets. We will discuss setup time and 
some other flip-flop timing parameters in greater detail in Sec. 12.6.6.
D-type flip-flops are sometimes found in the pulse-triggered (master-slave) variety. 
Recall that a pulse-triggered flip-flop requires a complete clock pulse before the out-
puts will reflect what is applied at the input(s) (in this case, the D input). Figure 12.67 
shows the basic structure of a pulse-triggered D flip-flop. It is almost exactly like the 
pulse-triggered SR flip-flop, except for the inverter addition to the master’s input.
Now let’s look at a few simple D-type flip-flop applications.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    767
Stop and Go
In the stop-go indicator circuit, a simple level-triggered D-type flip-flop is used to 
turn on a red LED when its D input is low (reset) and turn on a green LED when the 
D input is high (set). Only one LED can be turned on at a time.
The divide-by-two counter uses a positive edge-triggered D-type flip-flop to 
divide an applied signal’s frequency by two. The explanation of how this works is 
simple: The positive edge-triggered feature does not care about negative edges. You 
can figure out the rest.
External Asynchronous Control Signal
A synchronizer is used when you want to use an external asynchronous control sig-
nal (perhaps generated by a switch or other input device) to control some action 
within a synchronous system. The synchronizer provides a means of keeping the 
phase of the action generated by the control signal in synch with the phase of the 
synchronous system. 
For example, say you want an asynchronous control signal to control the num-
ber of clock pulses that get from point A to point B within a synchronous system. 
You might try using a simple enable gate, as shown below the synchronizer circuit 
in Fig. 12.68. However, because the external control signal is not synchronous 
(in phase) with the clock, when you apply the external control signal, you may 
shorten the first or last output pulse, as shown in the lower timing diagram.

Certain applications do not like shortened clock pulses and will not function 
properly. To avoid shortened pulses, throw in an edge-triggered D-type flip-flop 
to create a synchronizer. The flip-flop’s CLK input is tapped off the input clock 
line, its D input receives the external control signal, and its Q output is connected 
to the AND gate’s enable input. With this arrangement, there will never be short-
ened clock pulses because the Q output of the flip-flop will not supply enable 
pulses to the AND gate that are out of phase with the input clock signal. This is 
due to the fact that after the flip-flop’s CLK input receives a positive clock edge, 
the flip-flop ignores any input changes applied to the D input until the next posi-
tive clock edge.

12.6.4  Quad and Octal D Flip-Flops
Most frequently, you will find a number of D flip-flops or D latches grouped 
together within a single IC. For example, the 74HC75, shown in Fig. 12.69, con-
tains four transparent D latches. Latches 0 and 1 share a common active-low enable  
E0 – E1, while latches 2 and 3 share a common active-low enable E2 – E3. From the 
function table, each Q output follows each D input as long as the corresponding 
enable line is high. When the enable line goes low, the Q output will become latched 
to the value that D was one setup time prior to the high-to-low enable transition. 
The 4042 is another quad D-type latch, which works as described in Fig. 12.69. 
D-type latches are commonly used as data registers in bus-oriented systems, as is 
also explained in the figure.

When E (enable) is HIGH, Q follows D.
Here a 4-bit data register  is
created by connecting the
enables together to form a
single enable input.  Data
on bus appears at the
outputs when the enable
input is HIGH.  When
enable goes LOW, the data
that was present on the bus
is latched (stored) until
latch input goes HIGH.

D flip-flops also come in octal form—eight flip-flops per IC. These devices are 
frequently used as 8-bit data registers within microprocessor systems, where devices 
share 8-bit or 2 × 8 = 16-bit data or address buses. An example of an octal D-type 
flip-flop is the 74HCT273 shown in Fig. 12.70. All D flip-flops within the 74HCT273 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    769
share a common positive edge-triggered clock input and a common active-low clear 
input. When the clock input receives a positive edge, data bits applied to D0 through 
D7 are stored in the eight flip-flops and appear at the outputs Q0 through Q7. To clear 
all flip-flops, the clear input is pulsed low.
12.6.5  JK Flip-Flops
Finally, we come to the last of the flip-flops: the JK flip-flop. A JK flip-flop resembles 
an SR flip-flop, where J acts like S and K acts like R. Likewise, it has a set mode (J = 1, 
K = 0), a reset mode (J = 0, K = 1), and a hold mode (J = 0, K = 0). However, unlike the 
SR flip-flop, which has an indeterminate mode when S = 1, R = 1, the JK flip-flop has 
a toggle mode when J = 1, K = 1. Toggle means that the Q andQ outputs switch to their 
opposite states at each active clock edge. 
To make a JK flip-flop, modify the SR flip-flop’s internal logic circuit to include 
two cross-coupled feedback lines between the output and input. This modification, 
however, means that the JK flip-flop cannot be level-triggered; it can only be edge-
triggered or pulse-triggered. Figure 12.71 shows how you can create edge-triggered 
flip-flops based on the cross-NAND SR edge-triggered flip-flop.

Edge-triggered JK flip-flops also come with preset (asynchronous set) and clear 
(asynchronous reset) inputs, as shown in Fig. 12.72.
There are pulse-triggered (master-slave) flip-flops, too. These devices are similar 
to the pulse-triggered SR flip-flops with the exception of the distinctive JK cross-
coupled feedback connections from the slave’s Q andQ outputs back to the master’s 
input gates. Figure 12.73 shows a simple NAND pulse-triggered JK flip-flop.
The pulse-triggered flip-flops are not as popular as the edge-triggered JK flip-
flops because of an undesired effect that can occur. Pulse-triggered JK flip-flops occa-
sionally experience what is called ones-catching. In ones-catching, unwanted pulses or 

770    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
glitches caused by electrostatic noise appear on J and K while the clock is high. The 
flip-flop remembers these glitches and interprets them as true data. Ones-catching 
normally is not a problem when clock pulses are of short duration; it is when the 
pulses get long that you must watch out. To avoid ones-catching altogether, stick 
with edge-triggered JK flip-flops.
Two major applications for JK flip-flops are found within counter and shift reg-
ister circuits. Here, we will introduce a counter application. We will discuss shift 
registers in Sec. 12.8 and additional counter circuits in Sec. 12.7.

Ripple Counter (Asynchronous Counter)
A simple counter, called a MOD-16 ripple counter (or asynchronous counter), can be con-
structed by joining four JK flop-flops together, as shown in Fig. 12.75. (MOD-16, or 
modulus 16, means that the counter has 16 binary states.) This means that it can count 
from 0 to 15—the 0 is one of the counts.
The ripple counter in Fig. 12.75 also can be used as a divide-by-2, -4, -8, or -16 
counter. Here, you simply replace the clock signal with any desired input signal that

Each flip-flop in the ripple counter is fixed 
in toggle mode (J and K are both held high). 
The clock signal applied to the first flip-
flop causes the flip-flop to divide the clock 
signal’s frequency by 2 at its Q0 output—
a result of the toggle. The second flip-flop 
receives Q0’s output at its clock input and 
likewise divides by 2. The process contin-
ues down the line. What you get in the end 
is a binary counter with four digits. The 
LSB is Q0, while the MSB is Q3. When the 
count reaches 1111, the counter recycles 
back to 0000 and continues from there. To 
reset the counter at any given time, the 
active-low clear line is pulsed low. To make 
the counter count backward from 1111 to 
0000, you would simply use the Q outputs.

FIGURE 12.76
To make a MOD-10 counter, you simply 
start with the MOD-16 counter and con-
nect the Q0 and Q3 outputs to a NAND gate. 
When the counter reaches 9 (1001), Q0 and 
Q3 will both go high, causing the NAND 
gate’s output to go low. The NAND gate 
then sinks current, turning the LED on, 
while at the same time disabling the clock-
enable gate and stopping the count. (When 
the NAND gate is high, there is no poten-
tial difference across the LED to light it up.) 
To start a new count, the active-low clear 
line is momentarily pulsed low. Now, to 
make a MOD-15 counter, you would apply 
the same basic approach used to the left, 
but you would connect Q1, Q2, and Q3 to a 
three-input NAND gate.
you wish to divide in frequency. To get a divide-by-2 counter, you only need the first 
flip-flop; to get a divide-by-8 counter, you need the first three flip-flops.
Ripple counters with higher MOD values can be constructed by slapping on more 
flip-flops to the MOD-16 counter. But how do you create a ripple counter with a 
MOD value other than 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on? For example, say you want to create a 
MOD-10 (0 to 9) ripple counter. And what do you do if you want to stop the counter 
after a particular count has been reached and then trigger some device, such as an 
LED or buzzer? Figure 12.76 shows just such a circuit.
Synchronous Counter
There is a problem with the ripple counter just discussed. The output stages of the 
flip-flops further down the line (from the first clocked flip-flop) take time to respond 
to changes that occur due to the initial clock signal. This is a result of the internal 
propagation delay that occurs within a given flip-flop. A standard TTL flip-flop may 
have an internal propagation delay of 30 ns. If you join four flip-flops to create a 
MOD-16 counter, the accumulative propagation delay at the highest-order output 
will be 120 ns. When used in high-precision synchronous systems, such large delays 
can lead to timing problems.
To avoid large delays, you can create what is called a synchronous counter. 
Synchronous counters, unlike ripple (asynchronous) counters, contain flip-flops 
whose clock inputs are driven at the same time by a common clock line. This means 
that output transitions for each flip-flop will occur at the same time. 
With this approach, unlike with the ripple counter, you must use some addi-
tional logic circuitry placed between various flip-flop inputs and outputs to give the 
desired count waveform. For example, to create a 4-bit MOD-16 synchronous counter 
requires adding two additional AND gates, as shown in Fig. 12.77. The AND gates act 
to keep a flip-flop in hold mode (if both inputs of the gate are low) or toggle mode 
(if both inputs of the gate are high), as follows:
• During the 0–1 count, the first flip-flop is in toggle mode (and always is); all the 
rest are in hold mode. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    773
• When it is time for the 2–4 count, the first and second flip-flops are placed in toggle 
mode; the last two are held in hold mode. 
• When it is time for the 4–8 count, the first AND gate is enabled, allowing the third 
flip-flop to toggle. 
• When it is time for the 8–15 count, the second AND gate is enabled, allowing the 
last flip-flop to toggle. 
You can work out the details for yourself by studying the circuit and timing 
waveforms.
The ripple (asynchronous) and synchronous counters discussed so far are simple 
but hardly ever used. In practice, if you need a counter—ripple or synchronous—you 
purchase a counter IC. These ICs are often MOD-16 or MOD-10 counters and usually 
come with many additional features. For example, many ICs allow you to preset the 
count to a desired number via parallel input lines. Others allow you to count up or to 
count down by means of control inputs. Counter ICs are discussed in Sec. 12.7.
12.6.6  Practical Timing Considerations with Flip-Flops
When working with flip-flops, it is important to avoid race conditions. For example, 
a typical race condition would occur if, say, you were to apply an active clock edge at 
the very moment you apply a high or low pulse to one of the inputs of a JK flip-flop. 
Since the JK flip-flop uses what is present on the inputs at the moment the clock edge 
arrives, having a high-to-low input change will cause problems because you cannot 
determine if the input is high or low at that moment—it is a straight line. 
To avoid this type of race condition, you must hold the inputs of the flip-flop 
high or low for at least one setup time ts before the active clock transition. If the input 
changes during the ts to the clock edge region, the output levels will be unreliable.

774    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To determine the setup time for a given flip-flop, you must look through the 
manufacturer’s data sheets. For example, the minimum setup time for the 74LS76 JK 
flip-flop is 20 ns. Other timing parameters, such as hold time and propagation delay, 
are also given by the manufacturers. A description of what these parameters mean is 
given in Fig. 12.78.
12.6.7  Digital Clock Generators and Single-Pulse Generators
You have already seen the importance of clock and single-pulse control signals. Now 
let’s take a look at some circuits that can generate these signals.
Clocks (Astable Multivibrators)
A clock is simply a squarewave oscillator. Chapter 10 discusses ways to generate 
squarewaves, so you can refer there to learn the theory. Here, we will simply present

Flip-Flop Timing Parameters
IMPORTANT TERMS
Setup time ts: The time that the input must be 
held before the active clock edge for proper 
operation. For a typical flip-flop, ts is around 
20 ns.
Hold time th: The time that the input must 
be held after the active clock edge for proper 
operation. For most flip-flops, this is 0 ns—
meaning inputs need not be held beyond the 
active clock signal.
TPLH: Propagation delay from clock trigger 
point to the low-to-high Q output swing. A 
typical TPLH for a flip-flop is around 20 ns.
TPHL: Propagation delay from clock trigger 
point to the high-to-low Q output swing. A 
typical TPLH for a flip-flop is around 20 ns.
fmax: Maximum frequency allowed at the clock 
input. Any frequency above this limit will 
result in unreliable performance. This can vary 
greatly.
tW(L): Clock pulse width (low), the minimum 
width (in nanoseconds) that is allowed at the 
clock input during the low level for reliable 
operation.
tW(H): Clock pulse width (high), the minimum 
width (in nanoseconds) that is allowed at the 
clock input during the high level for reliable 
operation.
Preset or clear pulse width: Also given by tW(L), 
the minimum width (in nanoseconds) of the 
low pulse at the preset or clear inputs.

Figure a. Here, two CMOS inverters are connected together to form an RC relaxation oscillator with squarewave output. 
The output frequency is determined by the RC time constant, as shown in the figure.
Figure b. The previous oscillator has one problem: it may not oscillate if the transition regions of its two gates differ, 
or it may oscillate at a slightly lower frequency than the equation predicts due to the finite gain of the leftmost gate. The 
oscillator shown here resolves these problems by adding hysteresis via the additional RC network.
Figure c. This oscillator uses a pair of CMOS NAND gates and RC timing network along with a pot to set the frequency. 
A squarewave output is generated with a maximum frequency of around 2 MHz. The enable lead could be connected to 
the other input of the first gate, but here it is brought out to be used as a clock enable input (the clock is enabled when 
this lead is high).
Figure d. Here, a TTL SR flip-flop with dual feedback resistors uses an RC relaxation-type configuration to generate a 
squarewave. The frequency of the clock is determined by the R and C values, as shown in the figure. Changing the C1-to-C2 
ratio changes the duty cycle.
Figure e. When high stability is required, a crystal oscillator is the best choice for a clock generator. Here, a pair of 
CMOS inverters and a feedback crystal are used (see Chap. 9 for details). The frequency of operation is determined by the 
crystal (such as 2 MHz or 10 MHz). Adjustment of the pot may be needed to start oscillations.
Figure f. A 555 timer in astable mode can be used to generate squarewaves. Here, we slap on a JK flip-flop that is in 
toggle mode to provide a means of keeping the low and high times the same, as well as providing clock-enable control. 
The timing diagram and the equations provided within the figure paint the rest of the picture.
Figure g. The 74S124 dual voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) outputs squarewaves at a frequency that is dependent on 
the value of an external capacitor and the voltage levels applied its frequency-range input (VRNG) and its frequency control 
input (Vfreq). The graph in this figure shows how the frequency changes with capacitance, while VRNG and Vfreq are fixed at 
2 V. This device also comes with active-low enable input. Other VCOs that are designed for clock generation include the 
74LS624, 4024, and 4046 PLL (Phase Locked Loop). You will find many more listed in the catalogs.
some practical circuits. Digital clocks can be constructed from discrete components 
such as logic gates, capacitors, resistors, and crystals, or can be purchased in IC form. 
Figure 12.79 shows some sample clock generators.
Monostables (One-Shots)
To generate single-pulse signals of a desired width, you can use a discrete device 
called a monostable multivibrator, or one-shot for short. A one-shot has only one stable 
state, high (or low), and can be triggered into its unstable state, low (or high), for a 
duration of time set by an RC network. One-shots can be constructed from simple 
gates, capacitors, and resistors. These circuits, however, tend to be “finicky” and 

776    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
simply are not worth talking about. If you want a one-shot, you can buy a one-shot 
IC, which typically costs around 50 cents.
Two popular one-shots, shown in Fig. 12.80, are the 74121 nonretriggerable mono-
stable multivibrator and the 74123 retriggerable monostable multivibrator.
Note that a 555 timer IC can also be used as a monostable and is a lower-cost 
device.

the 74121, you can choose between five possi-
ble trigger combinations, as shown in the truth 
table in the figure. Bringing the input trig-
ger in on B, however, is attractive when deal-
ing with slowly rising or noisy signals, since 
the signal is directly applied to an internal 
Schmitt-triggered inverter (recall hystersis). To 
set the desired output pulse width (tw), a resis-
tor/capacitor combination is connected to the 
Rext/Cext and Cext inputs, as shown. (An internal 
2-k resistor is provided, which can be used 
alone by connecting pin 9 to VCC and placing 
the capacitor across pins 10 and 11, or which 
can be used in series with an external resistor 
attached to pin 9. Here, the internal resistor 
will not be used.) To determine which values 
to give to the external resistor and capacitor, 
use the formula given by the manufacturer, 
which is shown to the left. The maximum tw 
should not exceed 28 s (R = 40 k, C = 1000 lF) 
for reliable operation. Also, note that with 
a nonretriggerable one-shot like the 74121, 
any trigger pulses applied when the device is 
already in its astable state will be ignored.

The 74123 is a dual, retriggerable one-shot. 
Unlike nonretriggerable one-shots, this device 
will not ignore trigger pulses that are applied 
during the astable state. Instead, when a new 
trigger pulse arrives during an astable state, 
the astable state will continue to be astable 
for a time of tw. In other words, the device is 
simply retriggered. The 74123 has two trigger 
inputs A B

CLR is low, the one-shot is forced back into its 
stable state (Q = low). To determine tw, use the

If Cext < 1000 pF, use tw/Cext/Rext graphs provided

Using a 555 timer as a one-shot to generate unique output waveforms
FIGURE 12.82
If you do not have a one-shot IC like the 74121, you can use a 555 timer (discussed 
in Chap. 9) wired in its monostable configuration, as shown in Fig. 12.82.
One-Shot/Continuous-Clock Generator
The circuit shown in Fig. 12.83 is a handy one-shot/continuous clock generator that 
is useful when you start experimenting with logic circuits. 
12.6.8  Automatic Power-Up Clear (Reset) Circuits
In sequential circuits, it is usually a good idea to clear (reset) devices when power is 
first applied. This ensures that devices, such as flip-flops and other sequential ICs, do 
not start out in a weird mode (for example, counter IC does not start counting at, say, 
1101 instead of 0000). Figures 12.84 and 12.85 show some techniques used to provide 
automatic power-up clearing.

In this circuit, switch S2 is used to select whether 
a single-step or a continuous-clock input is to 
be presented to the output. When S2 is in the 
single-step position, the cross-NAND SR flip-
flop (switch debouncer) is set (Q = 1, Q  = 0). 
This disables NAND gate B while enabling 
NAND gate A, which will allow a single pulse 
from the one-shot to pass through gate C to the 
output. To trigger the one-shot, press switch S1. 
When S2 is thrown to the continuous position, 
the switch debouncer is reset (Q = 0, Q  = 1). This 
disables NAND gate A and enables NAND 
gate B, allowing the clock signal generated by 
the 555/flip-flop to pass through gate C and to 
the output. (Just as a note to avoid confusion, 
you need gate C to prevent the output from 
being low and high at the same time.)

FIGURE 12.85
Let’s pretend that one of the devices in a circuit has a JK flip-
flop that needs clearing during power-up. In order to clear the 
flip-flop and then quickly return it to synchronous operations, 
you would like to apply a low (0) voltage to its active-low clear 
input; afterward, you would like the voltage to go high (at least 
above 2.0 V for a 74LS76 JK flip-flop). A simple way to imple-
ment this function is to use an RC network like the one shown 
in the figure. When the power is off (switch open), the capaci-
tor is uncharged (0 V). This means that the CLR line is low (0 V). 
Once the power is turned on (switch closed), the capacitor 
begins charging up toward VCC (+5 V). However, until the capac-
itor’s voltage reaches 2.0 V, the CLR line is considered low to the 
active-low clear input. After a duration of t = RC, the capacitor’s 
voltage will have reached 63 percent of VCC, or 3.15 V; after a 
duration of t = 5RC, its voltage will be nearly equal to +5 V. 
Since the 74LS76’s CLR input requires at least 2.0 V to be placed 
back into synchronous operations, you know that t = RC is long 
enough. Thus, by rough estimate, if you want the CLR line to 
remain low for 1 ls after power-up, you must set RC = 1 ls. Set-
ting R = 1 k and C = 0.001 lF does the trick.
This automatic resetting scheme can be used within circuits 
that contain a number of resettable ICs. If an IC requires an 
active-high reset (not common), simply throw in an inverter and 
create an active-high clear line, as shown in the figure. Depend-
ing on the device being reset, the length of time that the clear 
line is at a low will be about 1 ls. As more devices are placed 
on the clear line, the low time duration will decrease due to the 
additional charging paths. To prevent this from occurring, a 
larger capacitor can be used.
An improved automatic power-up clear circuit is shown in 
Fig. 12.85. Here a Schmitt-triggered inverter is used to make the 
clear signal switch off cleanly. With CMOS Schmitt-triggered 
inverters, a diode and input resistor (R2) are necessary to protect 
the CMOS IC when power is removed.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    779
12.6.9  Pullup and Pulldown Resistors
As you learned when dealing with the switch debouncer circuits, a pullup resistor is 
used to keep an input high that would otherwise float if left unconnected. If you want 
to set the “pulled up” input low, you can ground the pin, say, via a switch. 
It is important to get an idea of the size of pullup resistor to use. The key here is 
to make the resistor value small enough so that the voltage drop across it does not 
weigh down the input voltage below the minimum high threshold voltage (VIH,min) of 
the IC. At the same time, you do not want to make it too small; otherwise, when you 
ground the pin, excessive current will be dissipated.
In the left diagram in Fig. 12.86, a 10-k pullup resistor is used to keep a 74LS 
device’s input high. To make the input low, close the switch. To figure out if the 
resistor is large enough so as not to weigh down the input, use Vin = +5 V − RIIH, 
where IIH is the current drawn into the IC during the high input state, when the 
switch is open. For a typical 74LS device, IIH is around 20 µA. Thus, by applying 
the simple formula, you find that Vin= 4.80 V, which is well above the VIH,min level 
for a 74LS device. Now, if you close the switch to force the input low, the power 
dissipated through the resistor (PD = V2/R) will be (5 V)2/10 k = 25 mW. The graph 
shown in Fig. 12.86 provides Vin versus R and PD versus R curves. As you can see, 
if R becomes too large, Vin drops below the VIH,min level, and the output will not go 
high as planned. As R gets smaller, the power dissipation skyrockets. To determine 
what value of R to use for a specific logic IC, you look up the VIH,min and IIH,max val-
ues within the data sheets and apply the simple formulas. In most applications, a 
10-k pullup resistor will work fine.

780    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You will run into situations where a pulldown resistor is used to keep a floating 
terminal low. Unlike a pullup resistor, the pulldown resistor must be smaller because 
the input low current IIL (sourced by IC) is usually much larger than IIH. Typically, a 
pulldown resistor is around 100 to 1 kΩ. A lower resistance ensures that Vin is low 
enough to be interpreted as a low by the logic input. To determine if Vin is low enough, 
use Vin = 0 V + IILR. As an example, use a 74LS device with an IIL = 400 µA and a 500-Ω 
pulldown resistor. When the switch is open, the input will be 0.20 V—well below the 
VIL,max level for the 74LS (∼0.8 V). When the switch is closed, the power dissipated by 
the resistor will be (5 V)2/500 Ω = 50 mW. The graph shown in Fig. 12.86 provides Vin 
versus R and PD versus R curves. As you can see by the curves, if R becomes too large, 
Vin surpasses VIL,max, and the output will not be low as planned. As R gets small, the 
power dissipation skyrockets. If you need to use a pulldown resistor/switch arrange-
ment, be wary of the high power dissipation through the resistor when the switch is 
closed.
12.7  Counter ICs
In Sec. 12.6.5, you saw how flip-flops could be combined to make both asynchro-
nous (ripple) and synchronous counters. In practice, using discrete flip-flops is to be 
avoided. Instead, use a prefabricated counter IC. These ICs cost a dollar or two and 
come with many additional features, like control enable inputs, parallel loading, and 
so on. A number of different kinds of counter ICs are available. They come in either 
synchronous (ripple) or asynchronous forms and are usually designed to count in 
binary or binary-coded decimal (BCD).
12.7.1  Asynchronous Counter (Ripple Counter) ICs
Asynchronous counters work fine for many noncritical applications, but for high-
frequency applications that require precise timing, synchronous counters work 
better. Recall that unlike an asynchronous counter, a synchronous counter contains 
flip-flops that are clocked at the same time, and hence the synchronous counter 
does not accumulate nearly as many propagation delays as is the case with the 
asynchronous counter. Let’s look at a few asynchronous counter ICs you will find 
in the electronics catalogs.
7493 4-Bit Ripple Counter with Separate MOD-2 and MOD-8 Counter Sections
The 7493’s internal structure consists of four JK flip-flops connected to provide 
separate MOD-2 (0-to-1 counter) and MOD-8 (0-to-7 counter) sections. Both the 
MOD-2 and MOD-8 sections are clocked by separate clock inputs. The MOD-2 
section uses Cp0 as its clock input, while the MOD-8 section uses Cp1 as its clock 
input. Likewise, the two sections have separate outputs: MOD-2’s output is Q0, 
while MOD-8’s outputs consist of Q1, Q2, and Q3. The MOD-2 section can be used 
as a divide-by-2 counter. The MOD-8 section can be used as a divide-by-2 counter 
(output tapped at Q1), a divide-by-4 counter (output tapped at Q2), or a divide-by-8 
counter (output tapped at Q3). If you want to create a MOD-16 counter, simply join 
the MOD-2 and MOD-8 sections by wiring Q0 to Cp1, while using Cp0 as the single 
clock input. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    781
The MOD-2, MOD-8, or the MOD-16 counter can be cleared by making both 
AND-gated master reset inputs (MR1 and MR2) high. To begin a count, one or both 
of the master reset inputs must be made low. When the negative edge of a clock 
pulse arrives, the count advances one step. After the maximum count is reached 
(1 for MOD-2, 111 for MOD-8, or 1111 for MOD-16), the outputs jump back to zero, 
and a new count begins.

7490 4-Bit Ripple Counter with MOD-2 and MOD-5 Counter Sections
The 7490, like the 7493, is another 4-bit ripple counter. However, its flip-flops are 
internally connected to provide MOD-2 (count-to-2) and MOD-5 (count-to-5) counter 
sections. Again, each section uses a separate clock: Cp0 for MOD-2 and Cp1 for MOD-
5. By connecting Q0 to Cp1 and using Cp0 as the single clock input, a MOD-10 counter 
(decade or BCD counter) can be created. 
When master reset inputs MR1 and MR2 are set high, the counter’s outputs are 
reset to 0—provided that master set inputs MS1 and MS2 are not both high (the MS 
inputs override the MR inputs). When MS1 and MS2 are high, the outputs are set to 
Q0 = 1, Q1 = 0, Q2 = 0, and Q3 = 1. In the MOD-10 configuration, this means that the 
counter is set to 9 (binary 1001). This master set feature comes in handy if you wish 
to start a count at 0000 after the first clock transition occurs (with master reset, the 
count starts out at 0001).
7492 Divide-by-12 Ripple Counter with MOD-2 and MOD-6 Counter Sections
The 7492 is another 4-bit ripple counter that is similar to the 7490. However, it has a 
MOD-2 and a MOD-6 section, with corresponding clock inputs Cp0 (MOD-2) and Cp1 
(MOD-8). By joining Q0 to Cp1, you get a MOD-12 counter, where Cp0 acts as the single 
clock input. To clear the counter, high levels are applied to master reset inputs MR1 
and MR2.

12.7.2  Synchronous Counter ICs
Like the asynchronous counter ICs, synchronous counter ICs come in various MOD 
arrangements. These devices usually come with extra goodies, such as controls for 
up or down counting and parallel load inputs used to preset the counter to a desired 
start count. Synchronous counter ICs are more popular than the asynchronous ICs, 
not only because of these additional features, but also because they do not have such 
long propagation delays as asynchronous counters. Let’s take a look at a few popular 
IC synchronous counters.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    783
74193 Presettable 4-Bit (MOD-16) Synchronous Up/Down Counter
The 74193 is a versatile 4-bit synchronous counter that can count up or count down 
and can be preset to any count desired—at least a number between 0 and 15. There 
are two separate clock inputs: CpU is used to count up, and CpD is used to count down. 
One of these clock inputs must be held high in order for the other input to count. The 
binary output count is taken from Q0 (20), Q1 (21), Q2 (22), and Q3 (23). 
To preset the counter to any desired count, a corresponding binary number is 
applied to the parallel inputs D0 to D3. When the parallel load input PL
(
) is pulsed 
low, the binary number is loaded into the counter, and the count, either up or down, 
will start from that number. The terminal count up ( TCU ) and terminal count down  
( TCD ) outputs are normally high. The TCU  output is used to indicate when the maxi-
mum count has been reached and the counter is about to recycle to the minimum 
count (0000)—the carry condition. Specifically, this means that TCU  goes low when 
the count reaches 15 (1111) and the input clock (CpU) goes from high to low. TCU
remains low until CpU returns high. This low pulse at TCU  can be used as an input 
to the next high-order stage of a multistage counter. The terminal count down ( TCD )  
output is used to indicate that the minimum count has been reached (0000) and the 
counter is about to recycle to the maximum count 15 (1111)—the borrow condition. 
Specifically, this means that TCD  goes low when the down count reaches 0000 and 
the input clock (CpD) goes low. Figure 12.90 provides a truth table for the 74193, along 
with a sample load, up-count, and down-count sequence.

74192 Presettable Decade (BCD or MOD-10) Synchronous Up/Down Counter
The 74192, shown in Fig. 12.91, is essentially the same device as the 74193, except 
it counts up from 0 to 9 and repeats or counts down from 9 to 0 and repeats. When 
counting up, the terminal count up ( TCU ) output goes low to indicate when the 
maximum count is reached (9 or 1001) and the CpU clock input goes from high to 

784    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
low. TCU remains low until CpU returns high. When counting down, the terminal 
count down output ( TCD ) goes low when the minimum count is reached (0 or 0000) 
and the input clock CpD goes low. The truth table and example load, count-up, 
and count-down sequence provided in Fig. 12.91 explain how the 74192 works in 
greater detail.
74190 Presettable Decade (BCD or MOD-10)  
and 74191 Presettable 4-Bit (MOD-16) Synchronous Up/Down Counters
The 74190 and the 74191 do basically the same things as the 74192 and 74193, but the 
input and output pins, as well as the operating modes, are a bit different. (The 74190 
and the 74191 have the same pinouts and operating modes; the only difference is the 
maximum count.) Like the previous synchronous counters, these counters can be 
preset to any count by using the parallel load PL
(
)  operation. However, unlike the 
previous synchronous counters, to count up or down requires using a single input: 
D
U/ . When 
D
U/
 is set low, the counter counts up; when 
D
U/
 is high, the counter 
counts down. 
A clock enable input ( CE ) acts to enable or disable the counter. When CE  is low, 
the counter is enabled. When CE is high, counting stops, and the current count is held 
fixed at the Q0 to Q3 outputs.
Unlike the previous synchronous counters, the 74190 and the 74191 use a single 
terminal count output (TC) to indicate when the maximum or minimum count has 
occurred and the counter is about to recycle. In count-down mode, TC is normally 
low but goes high when the counter reaches zero (for both the 74190 and 74191). In 
count-up mode, TC is normally low but goes high when the counter reaches 9 (for the 
74190) or reaches 15 (for the 74191). 
The ripple-clock output ( RC ) follows the input clock (CP) whenever TC is high. 
This means, for example, that in count-down mode, when the count reaches zero, RC  
will go low when CP goes low. The RC  output can be used as a clock input to the next

higher stage of a multistage counter. This, however, leads to a multistage counter 
that is not truly synchronous because of the small propagation delay from CP to RC  
of each counter. To make a multistage counter that is truly synchronous, you must 
tie each IC’s clock to a common clock input line. You use the TC output to inhibit 
each successive stage from counting until the previous stage is at its terminal count. 
Figure 12.92 shows various asynchronous (ripple-like) and synchronous multistage 
counters built from 74191 ICs.
Presettable 4-Bit (MOD-16) Synchronous Up/Down Counter
The 74160 and 74163 resemble the 74190 and 74191 but require no external gates 
when used in multistage counter configurations. Instead, you simply cascade coun-
ter ICs together, as shown in Fig. 12.93. 
For both devices, a count can be preset by applying the desired count to the D0 to 
D3 inputs and then applying a low to the parallel enable input PE
(
) ; the input num-
ber is loaded into the counter on the next low-to-high clock transition. The master 
reset MR
(
) is used to force all Q output low, regardless of the other input signals. 
The two clock enable inputs (CEP and CET) must be high for counting to begin. The 
terminal count output (TC) is forced high when the maximum count is reached, 
but will be forced low if CET goes low. This is an important feature that makes the 
multistage configuration synchronous, while avoiding the need for external gating. 
The truth tables along with the example load, count-up, and count-down timing 
sequences in Figs. 12.93 and 12.94 should help you better understand how these two 
devices work.

12.7.3  A Note on Counters with Displays
If you want to build a fairly sophisticated counter that can display many digits, the 
previous techniques are not worth pursuing, because there are simply too many dis-
crete components to work with (for example, a separate seven-segment decoder/
driver for each digit). A common alternative approach is to use a microcontroller or 
FPGA that functions both as a counter and a display driver. 
What microcontrollers and FPGAs can do that discrete circuits have a hard 
time achieving is multiplex a display. In a multiplexed system, corresponding 
segments of each digit of a multidigit display are linked together, while the com-
mon lines for each digit are brought out separately. You can see that the number 
of lines is significantly reduced; a nonmultiplexed 7-segment 4-digit display has 
28 segment lines and 4 common lines, while the 4-digit multiplexed display has 
only 7 + 4, or 11, lines. 
The trick to multiplexing involves flashing each digit, one after the other 
(and recycling), in a fast enough manner to make it appear that the display is contin-
uously lit. In order to multiplex, the microcontroller’s program must supply the cor-
rect data to the segment lines at the same time that it enables a given digit via a control 
signal sent to the common lead of that digit. We will talk about multiplexing displays 
in greater detail in Chap. 13 with microcontrollers and Chap. 14 using FPGAs.

788    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Another approach used to create multidigit counters is to use a multidigit coun-
ter/display driver IC. One such IC is the ICM7217, a four-digit LED display program-
mable up/down counter made by Intersil. This device is typically used in hardwired 
applications where thumbwheel switches are used to load data and SPDT switches 
are used to control the chip. The ICM7217A provides multiplexed seven-segment 
LED display outputs that are used to drive common cathode displays.
A simple application of the ICM7217A is a four-digit unit counter shown in 
Fig. 12.96. If you are interested in knowing all the specifics of how this counter 
60-Hz, 10-Hz, and 1-Hz Clock-Pulse Generator
FIGURE 12.95
This simple clock-pulse generator provides a unique 
way to generate 60-, 10-, and 1-Hz clock signals that can 
be used in applications that require real-time counting. 
The basic idea is to take the characteristic 60-Hz ac line 
voltage (from the wall socket) and convert it into a lower-
voltage squarewave of the same frequency. (Note that 
countries other than the United States typically use 50 Hz 
instead of 60 Hz. For 50 Hz operation, use an appropriate 
transformer and replace the divide-by-6 counter with the 
divide-by-5 counter shown in the upper left of Fig. 12.94.) 
First, the ac line voltage is stepped down to 12.6 V by the 
transformer. The negative-going portion of the 12.6-V 
ac voltage is removed by the zener diode (which acts 
as a half-wave rectifier). At the same time, the zener 
diode clips the positive-going signal to a level equal to 
its reverse breakdown voltage (3.9 V). This prevents the 
Schmitt-triggered inverter from receiving an input level 
that exceeds its maximum input rating. The Schmitt-
triggered inverter takes the rectified/chipped sine wave 
and converts it into a true squarewave. The Schmitt  
trigger’s output goes low (∼0.2 V) when the input voltage exceeds its positive threshold voltage VT
+ (∼1.7 V) and goes high 
(∼3.4 V) when its input falls below its negative threshold voltage VT
− (∼0.9 V). From the inverter’s output, you get a 60-Hz 
squarewave (or a clock signal beating out 60 pulses per second). To get a 10-Hz clock signal, you slap on a divide-by-6 
counter. To get a 1-Hz signal, you slap a divide-by-10 counter onto the output of the divide-by-6 counter.

12.8  Shift Registers
Data words traveling through a digital system frequently must be temporarily held, 
copied, and bit-shifted to the left or to the right. A device that can be used for such 
applications is the shift register. A shift register is constructed from a row of flip-flops 
connected so that digital data can be shifted down the row either in a left or right 
direction. Most shift registers can handle parallel movement of data bits as well as 
serial movement, and also can be used to convert from parallel to serial or from serial 
to parallel. Figure 12.97 shows several types of shift register arrangements: serial-in/
serial-out, parallel-in/serial-out, and serial-in/parallel out.

12.8.1  Serial-In/Serial-Out Shift Registers
Figure 12.98 shows a simple 4-bit serial-in/serial-out shift register made from D flip-
flops. Serial data is applied to the D input of flip-flop 0. When the clock line receives 
a positive clock edge, the serial data is shifted to the right from flip-flop 0 to flip-flop 
1. Whatever bits of data were present at flip-flop 2’s, 3’s, and 4’s outputs are shifted to 
the right during the same clock pulse. To store a 4-bit word into this register requires 
four clock pulses. The rightmost circuit shows how you can rewire the flip-flops to 
make a shift-left register. To make larger bit-shift registers, more flip-flops are added 
(for example, an 8-bit shift register would require eight flip-flops cascaded together).

12.8.2  Serial-In/Parallel-Out Shift Registers
Figure 12.99 shows a 4-bit serial-in/parallel-out shift register constructed from D 
flip-flops. This circuit is essentially the same as the previous serial-in/serial-out shift 
register, except now you attach parallel output lines to the outputs of each flip-flop as 
shown. Note that this shift register circuit also comes with an active-low clear input 
CLR
(
)  and a strobe input that acts as a clock enable control. The timing diagram in the 
figure shows a sample serial-to-parallel shifting sequence.

12.8.3  Parallel-In/Serial-Out Shift Registers
Constructing a 4-bit parallel-to-serial shift register from D flip-flops requires some 
additional control logic, as shown in the circuit in Fig. 12.100. Parallel data must first 
be loaded into the D inputs of all four flip-flops. To load data, the SHIFT/ LOAD  is 
made low. This enables the AND gates with X marks, allowing the 4-bit parallel input 
word to enter the D0–D3 inputs of the flip-flops. When strobe and CLK are both high, 
the 4-bit parallel word is latched simultaneously into the four flip-flops and appears  
at the Q0–Q3 outputs. To shift the latched data out through the serial output, the

SHIFT/ LOAD  line is made high. This enables all unmarked AND gates, allowing the 
latched data bit at the Q output of a flip-flop to pass (shift) to the D input of the flip-
flop to the right. In this shift mode, four clock pulses are required to shift the parallel 
word out of the serial output.
12.8.4  Ring Counter (Shift Register Sequencer)
The ring counter (shift register sequencer) is a unique type of shift register that incor-
porates feedback from the output of the last flip-flop to the input of the first flip-flop. 
Figure 12.101 shows a 4-bit ring counter made from D-type flip-flops. In this circuit, 
when the START input is set low, Q0 is forced high by the active-low preset, while Q1, 
Q2, and Q3 are forced low (cleared) by the active-low clear. This causes the binary 
word 1000 to be stored within the register. When the START line is brought low, the 
data bits stored in the flip-flops are shifted right with each positive clock edge. The 
data bit from the last flip-flop is sent to the D input of the first flip-flop. The shifting 
cycle will continue to recirculate while the clock is applied. To start a fresh cycle, the 
START  line is momentarily brought low.
12.8.5  Johnson Shift Counter
The Johnson shift counter is similar to the ring counter except that its last flip-flop 
feeds data back to the first flip-flop from its inverted output (Q ). For this reason, this 
type is sometimes called a Moebius counter, as the bit sequence will be shifted out 
first “normally,” then inverted, then normally, and so on. In the simple 4-bit Johnson 
shift counter shown in Fig. 12.102, you start out by applying a low to the START line, 
which sets presets Q0 high; Q1, Q2, and Q3 low; and Q3 high. In other words, you load 
the register with the binary word 1000, as you did with the ring counter. 
Now, when you bring the START  line low, data will shift through the register. 
However, unlike the ring counter, the first bit sent back to the D0 input of the first 
flip-flop will be high because feedback is from Q3  not Q3. At the next clock edge, 
another high is fed back to D0; at the next clock edge, another high is fed back; at the 
next edge, another high is fed back. Only after the fourth clock edge does a low get 
fed back (the 1 has shifted down to the last flip-flop and Q3  goes high). At this point, 
the shift register is full of 1s.

792    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
As more clock pulses arrive, the feedback loop supplies lows to D0 for the next 
four clock pulses. After that, the Q outputs of all the flip-flops are low, while Q3 goes 
high. This high from Q3  is fed back to D0 during the next positive clock edge, and 
the cycle repeats. 
As you can see, the 4-bit Johnson shift counter has eight output stages (which 
require eight clock pulses to recycle), not four, as is the case with the ring counter.
12.8.6  Shift Register ICs
Now that we have covered the basic theory of shift registers, let’s take a look at prac-
tical shift register ICs that contain all the necessary logic circuitry inside. It is not 
uncommon for a serial to parallel shift register IC to be used with a microcontroller to 
provide it with more outputs when driving LEDs. The serial data is fed into the shift 
register and then the output latched to turn the LEDs on or off.
7491A 8-Bit Serial-In/Serial-Out Shift Register IC
The 7491A is an 8-bit serial-in/serial-out shift register that consists of eight internally 
linked SR flip-flops. This device has positive edge-triggered inputs and a pair of data 
inputs (A and B) that are internally ANDed together, as shown in the logic diagram 
in Fig. 12.103. This type of data input means that for a binary 1 to be shifted into the

register, both data inputs must be high. For a binary 0 to be shifted into the register, 
either input can be low. Data is shifted to the right at each positive clock edge.
74164 8-Bit Serial-In/Parallel-Out Shift Register IC
The 74164 is an 8-bit serial-in/parallel-out shift register. It contains eight internally 
linked flip-flops and has two serial inputs, Dsa and Dsb, which are ANDed together. 
Like the 7491A, the unused serial input acts as an enable/disable control for the other 
serial input. For example, if you use Dsa as the serial input, you must keep Dsb high to 
allow data to enter the register, or you can keep it low to prevent data from entering 
the register. 
Data bits are shifted one position to the right at each positive clock edge. The first 
data bit entered will end up at the Q7 parallel output after the eighth clock pulse. The 
master reset MR
(
) resets all internal flip-flops and forces the Q outputs low when it 
is pulsed low. 
In the sample circuit shown in Fig. 12.104, a serial binary number 10011010 (15410) 
is converted into its parallel counterpart. Note the AND gate and strobe input used in 
this circuit. The strobe input acts as a clock enable input; when it is set high, the clock 
is enabled. The timing diagram paints the rest of the picture.

75165 8-Bit Serial-In or Parallel-In/Serial-Out Shift Register IC
The 75165 is a unique 8-bit device that can act as either a serial-to-serial shift register 
or as a parallel-to-serial shift register. When used as a parallel-to-serial shift register, 
parallel data is applied to the D0–D7 inputs and then loaded into the register when 
the parallel load input PL
(
) is pulsed low. To begin shifting the loaded data out of the 
serial output Q7 (or Q7  if you want inverted bits), the clock enable input CE
(
)  must 
be set low to allow the clock signal to reach the clock inputs of the internal D-type 
flip-flops. When used as a serial-to-serial shift register, serial data is applied to the 
serial data input DS. A sample shift, load, and inhibit timing sequence is shown in 
Fig. 12.105.

794    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
74194 Universal Shift Register IC
Figure 12.106 shows the 74194 4-bit bidirectional universal shift register. This device 
can accept either serial or parallel inputs, provide serial or parallel outputs, and shift 
left or right based on input signals applied to select controls S0 and S1. Serial data 
can be entered into either the serial shift-right input (DSR) or the serial shift-left input 
(DSL). Select controls S0 and S1 are used to initiate a hold (S0 = low, S1 = low), shift left 
(S0 = low, S1 = high), shift-right (S0 = high, S1 = low), or to parallel load (S0 = high, 
S1 = high) mode. A clock pulse must then be applied to shift or parallel load the data. 
In parallel load mode (S0 and S1 are high), parallel input data is entered via the D0 
through D3 inputs and transferred to the Q0 to Q3 outputs following the next low-to-
high clock transition. The 74194 also has an asynchronous master reset MR
(
) input that 
forces all Q outputs low when pulsed low. To make a shift-right recirculating register, 
the Q3 output is wired back to the DSR input, while making S0 = high and S1 = low. To 
make a shift-left recirculating register, the Q0 output is connected back to the DSL input, 
while making S0 = low and S1 = high. The timing diagram in Fig. 12.106 shows a typi-
cal parallel load and shifting sequence.
74299 8-Bit Universal Shift/Storage Register with Three-State Interface
A number of shift registers have three-state outputs—outputs that can assume a high, 
low, or high impedance state (open-circuit or float state). These devices are commonly 
used as storage registers in three-state bus interface applications. 
An example 8-bit universal shift/storage register with three-state outputs is the 74299, 
shown in Fig. 12.107. This device has four synchronous operating modes that are selected 
via two select inputs, S0 and S1. Like the 74194 universal shift register, the 74299’s select 
modes include shifting right, shifting left, holding, and parallel loading (see the function

table in Fig. 12.107). The mode-select inputs, serial data inputs (DS0 and DS7), and parallel-
data inputs (I/O0 through I/O7) are positive edge triggered. The master reset MR
(
) input 
is an asynchronous active-low input that clears the register when pulsed low. 
The three-state bidirectional I/O port has three modes of operation: 
• The read-register mode allows data within the register to be available at the I/O 
outputs. This mode is selected by making both output-enable inputs (
1
OE and 
2
OE ) low and making one or both select inputs low. 

796    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
• The load-register mode sets up the register for a parallel load during the next low-
to-high clock transition. This mode is selected by setting both select inputs high. 
• The disable-I/O mode acts to disable the outputs (set to a high impedance state) 
when a high is applied to one or both of the output-enable inputs. This effectively 
isolates the register from the bus to which it is attached.
12.8.7  Simple Shift Register Applications
16-Bit Serial-to-Parallel Converter
A simple way to create a 16-bit serial-to-parallel converter is to join two 74164 8-bit 
serial-in/parallel-out shift registers, as shown in Fig. 12.108. To join the two ICs, sim-
ply wire the Q7 output from the first register to one of the serial inputs of the second 
register. (Recall that the serial input that is not used for serial input data acts as an 
active-high enable control for the other serial input.) 
In terms of operation, when data is shifted out of Q7 of the first register (or data 
output D7), it enters the serial input of the second (the example uses DSa as the serial 
input) and will be presented to the Q0 output of the second register (or data output 
D8). For an input data bit to reach the Q7 output of the second register (or data output 
D15), 16 clock pulses must be applied.

8-Bit Serial-to-Parallel Converter with Simultaneous Data Transfer
Figure 12.109 shows a circuit that acts as a serial-to-parallel converter that outputs the 
converted 8-bit word only when all 8 bits have been entered into the register. Here, a 
74164 8-bit serial-in/parallel-out shift register is used, along with a 74HCT273 octal 
D-type flip-flop and a divide-by-8 counter. At each positive clock edge, the serial 
data is loaded into the 74164. After eight clock pulses, the first serial bit entered is 
shifted down to the 74164’s Q7 output, while the last serial bit entered resides at the 
74164’s Q0 output. At the negative edge of the eighth clock pulse, the negative-edge 
triggered divide-by-8 circuit’s output goes high. During this high transition, the data 
present on the inputs of the 74HCT273 (which hold the same data present at the 
74164’s Q outputs) is passed to the 74HCT273’s outputs at the same time. (Think of 
the 74HCT273 as a temporary storage register that dumps its contents after every 
eighth clock pulse.)

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    797
8-Bit Parallel-to-Serial Interface
Figure 12.110 shows a 74165 8-bit parallel-to-serial shift register used to accept a parallel 
ASCII word and convert it into a serial ASCII word that can be sent to a serial device. 
Recall that ASCII codes are only 7 bits long (for example, the binary code for & is 010 
0110). How do you account for the missing bit? As it turns out, most 8-bit devices 
communicating via serial ASCII will use an additional eighth bit for a special pur-
pose, perhaps to act as a parity bit or as a special function bit to enact a special set 
of characters. Often, the extra bit is simply set low and ignored by the serial device 
receiving it. 
To keep things simple, let’s set the extra bit low and assume that is how the serial 
device likes things done. This means that you will set the D0 input of the 74165 low. 
The MSB of the ASCII code will be applied to the D1 input, while the LSB of the ASCII 
code will be applied to the D7 input. Now, with the parallel ASCII word applied to

the inputs of the register, when you pulse the parallel load line ( PL ) low, the ASCII 
word, along with the “ignored bit,” is loaded into the register. Next, you must enable 
the clock to allow the loaded data to be shifted out serially, by setting the clock enable 
input ( CE ) low for the duration it takes for the clock pulses to shift out the parallel 
word. After the eighth clock pulse (0 to 7), the serial device will have received all 
8 serial data bits. Practically speaking, a microprocessor or microcontroller is necessary 
to provide the CE  and PL  lines with the necessary control signals to ensure that the 
register and serial device communicate properly.
Recirculating Memory Registers
A recirculating memory register is a shift register that is preloaded with a binary word 
that is serially recirculated through the register via a feedback connection from the 
output to the input. Recirculating registers can be used for a number of applications, 
from supplying a specific repetitive waveform used to drive IC inputs to driving 
output drivers used to control stepper motors.
In the leftmost circuit in Fig. 12.111, a parallel 4-bit binary word is applied to the 
D0 to D3 inputs of a 74194 universal shift register. When the S1 select input is brought 
high (switch opened), the 4-bit word is loaded into the register. When the S1 input is 
then brought low (switch closed), the 4-bit word is shifted in a serial fashion through 
the register, out Q3, and back to Q0 via the DSR input (serial shift-right input) as posi-
tive clock edges arrive. Here, the shift register is loaded with 0111. As you begin shift-
ing the bits through the register, a single low output will propagate down through 
high outputs, which in turn causes the LED attached to the corresponding low output 
to turn on. In other words, you have made a simple Christmas tree flasher.
The rightmost circuit in Fig. 12.111 is basically the same thing as the leftmost cir-
cuit. However, now the circuit is used to drive a stepper motor. Typically, a stepper 
motor has four stator coils that must be energized in sequence to make the motor turn 
at a given angle. For example, to make a simple stepper motor turn clockwise, you 
must energize its stator coils 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the following sequence: 1000, 0100, 0010, 
0001, 1000, and so on. To make the motor go counterclockwise, apply the following

sequence: 1000, 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, and so on. You can generate these simple firing 
sequences with the 74194 by parallel loading the D0 to D3 inputs with the binary word 
1000. To output the clockwise firing sequence, simply shift bits to the right by setting 
S0 = high and S1 = low. As clock pulses arrive, the 1000 present at the outputs will then 
become 0100, then 0010, 0001, 1000, and so on. 
The speed of rotation of the motor is determined by the clock frequency. To output 
the counterclockwise firing sequence, simply shift bits to the left by setting S0 = low 
and S1 = high. To drive steppers, it is typically necessary to use a buffer/driver inter-
face like the 7407 shown in Fig. 12.111, as well a number of output transistors, not 
shown. Also, different types of stepper motors may require different firing sequences 
than the one shown here. Stepper motors and the various circuits used to drive them 
are discussed in detail in Chap. 15.
12.9  Analog/Digital Interfacing
A number of tricks are used to interface analog circuits with digital circuits. In this 
section, we’ll take a look at two basic levels of interfacing. One level deals with sim-
ple on/off triggering. The other level deals with true analog-to-digital and digital-to-
analog conversion—converting analog signals into digital numbers and converting 
digital numbers into analog signals. These techniques are just as applicable to con-
necting things to the digital input pins of a microcontroller.
12.9.1  Triggering Simple Logic Responses from Analog Signals
There are times when you need to drive logic from simple on/off signals generated 
by analog devices. For example, you may want to latch an alarm (via a flip-flop) 
when an analog voltage—say, one generated from a temperature sensor—reaches a 
desired threshold level. Or perhaps you simply want to count the number of times 
a certain analog threshold is reached. For simple on/off applications such as these, 
it is common to use a comparator or op amp as the interface between the analog 
output of the transducer and the input of the logic circuit. Often it is possible to 
simply use a voltage divider network composed of a transducer of variable resis-
tance and a pullup resistor. Figure 12.112 shows some sample networks to illustrate 
the point.
In Fig. 12.112a, a phototransistor is used to trigger a logic response. Normally, the 
phototransistor is illuminated, which keeps the input of the first Schmitt inverter low. 
The output of the second inverter is high. When the light is briefly interrupted, the 
phototransistor momentarily stops conducting, causing the input to the first inverter 
to pulse low, while the output of the second inverter pulses high. This high pulse 
could be used to latch a D flip-flop, which could be used to trigger an LED or a 
buzzer alarm.
In Fig. 12.112b, a single-supply comparator with open-collector output is used as 
an analog-to-digital interface. When an analog voltage applied to Vin exceeds the ref-
erence voltage (Vref) set at the noninverting input (+) via the pot, the output goes low 
(the comparator sinks current through itself to ground). When Vin goes below Vref, 
the output goes high (the comparator’s output floats, but the pullup resistor pulls the 
comparator’s output high).

800    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In Fig. 12.112c, a simple application of the previous comparator interface is shown. 
The input voltage is generated by an LM34 or LM35 temperature sensor. The LM34 
generates 10 mV/°F, while the LM35 generates 10 mV/°C. The resistance of the pot 
and V+ determine the reference voltage. If we want to drive the comparator low 
when 75°C is reached, we set the reference voltage to 750 mV, assuming we’re using 
the LM35.
In Fig. 12.112d, an op amp set in comparator mode can also be used as an ana-
log-to-digital interface for simple switching applications. CMOS logic can be driven 
directly through a current limiting resistor, as shown. If the supply voltage of the 
op amp exceeds the supply voltage of the logic, protection diodes should be used 
(as shown in the figure).
Protection diodes were not necessary with the LM339 because that has open-
collector outputs.
In Fig. 12.112e, an op amp that is used to drive TTL typically uses a transistor out-
put stage like the one shown here. The diode acts to prevent base-to-emitter reverse 
breakdown. When Vin exceeds Vref, the op amp’s output goes low, the transistor turns 
off, and the logic input receives a high.
In Fig. 12.112f, an n-channel MOSFET transistor is used as an output stage to an 
op amp.
12.9.2  Using Logic to Drive External Loads
Driving simple loads such as LEDs, relays, buzzers, or any device that assumes either 
an on or off state is relatively simple. When driving such loads, it is important to first 
check the driving logic’s current specifications—how much current, say, a gate can 
sink or source. After that, you determine how much current the device to be driven 
will require. If the device draws more current than the logic can source or sink, a 
high-power transistor typically can be used as an output switch. Figure 12.113 shows 
some sample circuits used to drive various loads.
FIGURE 12.112

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    801
In Fig. 12.113a, LEDs can be driven directly by logic through a current-limiting 
resistor. Current can either be sourced or sunk. If an LED requires more current than 
the logic can supply or sink, a transistor output stage like the one shown in Fig. 
12.113f can be used.
Figure 12.113b shows a simple way to get dual-lighting action from a pair of LEDs. 
When the gate’s output goes low, the upper green LED turns on, while the lower red 
LED turns off. The LEDs switch states when the output goes high.
Relays will draw considerable current. To avoid damaging the logic device, in 
Fig. 12.113c, a power MOSFET transistor is attached to the logic output. The diode is 
used to protect the circuit from current spikes generated by relay as it switches states.
A handy method for interfacing standard logic with loads is to use a gate with an 
open-collector output as a go-between. Recall that open-collector gates cannot source 
current; they can only sink current. However, they typically can sink ten times the 
current of a standard logic gate. In Fig. 12.113d, an open-collector gate is used to drive 
a relay. Check the current ratings of specific open-collector devices before using them 
to be sure they can handle the load current.
Figure 12.113e shows another open-collector application. In Fig. 12.113f, a bipolar 
transistor is used to increase the output drive current used to drive a high-current 
LED. Make sure the transistor is of the proper current rating.
Figure 12.113g is basically the same as the previous example, but the load can be 
something other than an LED. 
In Fig. 12.113h, an optocoupler is used to drive a load that requires electrical iso-
lation from the logic driving it. Electrical isolation is often used in situations where 
external loads use a separate ground system. The voltage level at the load side of the 
optical interface can be set via VCC. There are many different types of optocouplers 
available (see Chap. 5).
FIGURE 12.113

802    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
12.9.3  Analog Switches
Analog switches are ICs designed to switch analog signals via digital control. The 
internal structure of these devices typically consists of a number of logic control gates 
interfaced with transistor stages used to control the flow of analog signals.
Figure 12.114 shows various types of analog switches. The CMOS 4066B quad 
bilateral switch uses a single-supply voltage from 3 to 15 V. It can switch analog 
or digital signals within ±7.5 V and has a maximum power dissipation of around 
700 mW. Individual switches are controlled by digital inputs A through D. The TTL-
compatible AH0014D DPDT analog switch can switch analog signals of ±10 V via the 
A and B logic control inputs. Note that this device has separate analog and digital 
supplies: V+ and V− are analog; VCC and GND are digital. The DG302A dual-channel 
CMOS DPST analog switch can switch analog signals within the ±10-V range at 
switching speeds up to 15 ns.
FIGURE 12.114
A number of circuits use analog switches. They are found in modulator/demodu-
lator circuits, digitally controlled frequency circuits, analog signal-gain circuits, and 
analog-to-digital conversion circuits, where they often act as sample-hold switches. 
They can, of course, be used simply to turn a given analog device on or off.
12.9.4  Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer
Recall from Sec. 12.3 that a digital multiplexer acts like a data selector, while a 
digital demultiplexer acts like a data distributor. Analog multiplexers and demulti-
plexers act the same way but are capable of selecting or distributing analog signals. 
(They still use digital select inputs to select which pathways are open and which are 
closed to signal transmission.)
A popular analog multiplexer/demultiplexer IC is the 4051B, shown in Fig. 12.115. 
This device functions as either a multiplexer or demultiplexer, since its inputs and 
outputs are bidirectional (signals can flow in either direction). When used as a mul-
tiplexer, analog signals enter through I/O lines 0 through 7, while the digital code 
that selects which input is passed to the analog O/I line (pin 3) is applied to digital 
inputs A, B, and C. See the truth table in the figure. When used as a demultiplexer, 
the connections are reversed: The analog input comes in through the analog O/I line 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    803
(pin 3) and passes out through one of the seven analog I/O lines. The specific output 
is again selected by the digital inputs A, B, and C. Note that when the inhibit line 
(INH) is high, none of the addresses are selected.
The I/O analog voltage levels for the 4051B are limited to a region between the 
positive supply voltage VDD and the analog negative supply voltage VEE. Note that 
the VSS supply is grounded. If the analog signals you are planning to use are all posi-
tive, VEE and VSS can both be connected to a common ground. However, if you plan to 
use analog voltages that range from, say, −5 to +5 V, VEE should be set to −5 V, while 
VDD should be set to +5 V. The 4051B accepts digital signals from 3 to 15 V, while 
allowing for analog signals from −15 to +15 V.
12.9.5  Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog Conversion
In order for analog devices (temperature sensors, strain gauges, position sensors, 
light meters, and so on) to communicate with digital circuits in a manner that goes 
beyond simple threshold triggering, we use an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). An 
ADC converts an analog signal into a series of binary numbers, each number propor-
tional to the analog level measured at a given moment. Typically, the digital words 
generated by the ADC are fed into a microprocessor or microcontroller, where they 
can be processed, stored, interpreted, and manipulated. Analog-to-digital conversion 
is used in data-acquisition systems, digital sound recording, and within simple digi-
tal display test instruments (such as light meters and thermometers).
In order for a digital circuit to communicate with the analog world, we use a 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC). A DAC takes a binary number and converts it to 
an analog voltage that is proportional to the binary number. By supplying different 
binary numbers, one after the other, a complete analog waveform is created. DACs 
are commonly used to control the gain of an op amp, which in turn can be used to 
create digitally controlled amplifiers and filters. They are also used in waveform 
FIGURE 12.115

804    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
generator and modulator circuits and as trimmer replacements, and are found in a 
number of process-control and autocalibration circuits.
Many digital consumer products such as MP3 players, DVDs, and CD players use 
digital signal processing ADCs and DACs often contained in a microcontroller.
ADC and DAC Basics
Figure 12.116 shows the basic idea behind analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog 
conversion. In the analog-to-digital figure, the ADC receives an analog input signal 
along with a series of digital sampling pulses. Each time a sampling pulse is received, 
the ADC measures the analog input voltage and outputs a 4-bit binary number that is 
proportional to the analog voltage measured during the specific sample. With 4 bits, 
we get 16 binary codes (0000 to 1111) that correspond to 16 possible analog levels (for 
example, 0 to 15 V).
FIGURE 12.116
In the digital-to-analog conversion figure, the DAC receives a series of 4-bit binary 
numbers. The rate at which new binary numbers are fed into the DAC is determined 
by the logic that generates them. With each new binary number, a new analog volt-
age is generated. As with the ADC example, we have a total of 16 binary numbers to 
work with and 16 possible output voltages.
As you can see from the graphs, both these 4-bit converters lack the resolution 
needed to make the analog signal appear continuous (without steps). To make things 
appear more continuous, a converter with higher resolution is used. This means that 
instead of using 4-bit binary numbers, we use larger-bit numbers, such as 6-bit, 8-bit, 
10-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit, or even 18-bit or higher numbers. If our converter has a resolu-
tion of 8 bits, we have 28 = 256 binary numbers to work with, along with 256 analog 
steps. Now, if this 8-bit converter is set up to generate 0 V at binary 00000000 and 15 V 
at binary 11111111 (full scale), then each analog step is only 0.058 V high (1⁄256 × 15 V). 
With an 18-bit converter, the steps get incredibly tiny because we have 218 = 262,144 
binary numbers and steps. With 0 V corresponding to binary 000000000000000000 
and 15 V corresponding to 111111111111111111, the 18-bit converter yields steps that 
are only 0.000058 V high! As you can see in the 18-bit case, the conversion process 
between digital and analog appears practically continuous.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    805
Simple Binary-Weighted DAC
Figure 12.117 shows a simple 4-bit DAC that is constructed from a digitally con-
trolled switch (74HC4066), a set of binary-weighted resistors, and an operational 
amplifier. The basic idea is to create an inverting amplifier circuit whose gain is con-
trolled by changing the input resistance Rin. The 74HC4066 and the resistors together 
act as a digitally controlled Rin that can take on one of 16 possible values. You can 
think of the 74HC4066 and resistor combination as a digitally controlled current 
source. Each new binary code applied to the inputs of the 74HC4066 generates a 
new discrete current level that is summed by RF to provide a new discrete output 
voltage level. 
We choose scaled resistor values of R, R/2, R/4, and R/8 to give Rin discrete val-
ues that are equally spaced. To find all possible values of Rin, we use the formula pro-
vided in Fig. 12.117. This formula looks like the old resistors-in-parallel formula, but 
we must exclude those resistors that are not selected by the digital input code—that’s 
what the coefficients A through D are for (a coefficient is either 1 or 0, depending on 
the digital input). 
To find the analog output voltage, we simply use Vout = −Vref(RF/Rin)—the expres-
sion used for the inverting amplifier (see Chap. 8). Figure 12.117 shows what we get 
when we set Vref = −5 V, R = 100 kΩ, and RF = 20 kΩ, and take all possible input codes.
The binary-weighted DAC shown in Fig. 12.117 is limited in resolution (4-bit, 
16 analog levels). To double the resolution (make an 8-bit DAC), you might consider 
adding another 74HC4066 and R/16, R/32, R/64, and R/128 resistors. In theory, this 
works; in reality, it doesn’t. The problem with this approach is that when we reach the 
R/128 resistor, we must find a 0.78125-kΩ resistor, assuming R = 100 kΩ. Assuming 
we can find or construct an equivalent resistor network for R/128, we’re still in trou-
ble because the tolerances of these resistors will cause problems. This scaled-resistor 
approach becomes impractical when we deal with resolutions of more than a few 
bits. To increase the resolution, we scrap the scaled-resistor network and replace it 
with an R/2R ladder network. The manufacturers of DAC ICs do this as well.
FIGURE 12.117

806    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
R/2R Ladder DAC
An R/2R DAC uses an R/2R resistor ladder network instead of a scaled-resistor net-
work, as was the case in the previous DAC. The benefit of using the R/2R ladder is 
that we need only two resistor values: R and 2R. Figure 12.118 shows a simple 4-bit 
R/2R DAC. For now, assume that the switches are digitally controlled (in real DACs, 
they are replaced with transistors).
The trick to understanding how the R/2R ladder works is realizing that the 
current drawn through any one switch is always the same, no matter if it is thrown 
up or down. If a switch is thrown down, current will flow through the switch into 
ground (0 V). If a switch is thrown up, current will flow toward virtual ground—
located at the op amp’s inverting input (recall that if the noninverting input of an op 
amp is set to 0 V, the op amp will make the inverting input 0 V, via negative feed-
back). Once you realize that the current through any given switch is always constant, 
you can figure that the total current (I) supplied by Vref will be constant as well. Once 
you have that, you figure out what fractions of the total current pass through each 
of the branches within the R/2R network using simple circuit analysis. Figure 12.118 
shows that 1⁄2I passes through S3 (MSB switch), 1⁄4I through S2, 1⁄8I through S1, and 1⁄16I 
through S0 (LSB switch). If you’re interested in how that was figured out, the circuit 
reduction shown in Fig. 12.119 should help.
FIGURE 12.118
FIGURE 12.119
Now that we have a means of consistently generating fractions of 1⁄2I, 1⁄4I, 1⁄8I, 
and 1⁄16I, we can choose, via the digital input switches, which fractions are summed 
together by the amplifier. For example, if switches S3, S2, S1, and S0 are thrown to 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    807
0101 (5), 1⁄4 I + 1⁄16 I combine to form Isum. But what is I? Using Ohm’s law, it’s just I = 
Vref / R = +5 V / 10 kΩ = 500 µA. This means that Isum = 1⁄4(500 µA) + 1⁄16(500 µA) = 
156.25 µA. The final output voltage is determined by Vout = −IsumRF = − (156.25 µA)
(20 kΩ) = −3.125 V. The formulas and the table in Fig. 12.118 show the other possible 
binary/analog combinations.
To create an R/2R DAC with higher resolution, we simply add more runs and 
switches to the ladder.
Integrated DACs
Often, making DACs from scratch isn’t worth the effort. The cost as well as the likeli-
hood for conversion errors is great. The best thing to do is to simply buy a DAC IC. You 
can buy these devices from a number of different manufacturers (such as National 
Semiconductor, Analog Devices, and Texas Instruments). The typical resolutions for 
these ICs are 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 18 bits. DAC ICs also may come with a serial digi-
tal input, as opposed to the parallel input scheme shown in Figs 12.117 and 12.118. 
Before a serial-input DAC can make a conversion, the entire digital word must be 
clocked into an internal shift register.
Most often, DAC ICs come with an external reference input that is used to set the 
analog output range. There are some DACs that have fixed references, but these are 
becoming rare.
Often, you’ll see a manufacturer list one of its DACs as being a multiplying DAC. 
A multiplying DAC can produce an output signal that is proportional to the product 
of a varying input reference level (voltage or current) times a digital code. As it turns 
out, most DACs, even those that are specifically designated as multiplying DAC on 
the data sheets, can be used for multiplying purposes simply by using the reference 
input as the analog input. However, many such ICs do not provide the same quality 
multiplying characteristics, such as a wide analog input range and fast conversion 
times, as those that are called multiplying DACs.
Multiplying is most commonly applied in systems that use ratiometeric transduc-
ers (for example, position potentiometers, strain gauges, and pressure transducers). 
These transducers require an external analog voltage to act as a reference level on 
which to base analog output responses. If this reference level is altered, say, by an 
unwanted supply surge, the transducer’s output will change in response, and this 
results in conversion errors at the DAC end. However, if we use a multiplying DAC, 
we eliminate these errors by feeding the transducer’s reference voltage to the DAC’s 
analog input. If any supply voltage/current errors occur, the DAC will alter its out-
put in proportion to the analog error.
DACs are capable of producing unipolar (single-polarity output) or bipolar (positive 
and negative) output signals. In most cases, when a DAC is used in unipolar mode, 
the digital code is expressed in standard binary. When used in bipolar mode, the 
most common code is either offset binary or 2’s complement. Offset binary and 2’s 
complement codes make it possible to express both positive and negative values. 
Figure 12.120 shows all three codes and their corresponding analog output levels 
(referenced from an external voltage source).
Note that in the figure, FS stands for full scale, which is the maximum analog level 
that can be reached when applying the highest binary code. It is important to realize 
that at full scale, the analog output for an n-bit converter is actually (2n − 1) / 2n × Vref, 

808    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
not 2n/2n × Vref. For example, for an 8-bit converter, the number of binary numbers 
is 28 = 256, while the maximum analog output level is 255/256 Vref, not 256/256 Vref, 
since the highest binary number is 255 (1111 1111). The “missing count” is used up by 
the LSB-1 condition (0 state).
Example DAC ICs
DAC0808 8-BIT DAC
The DAC0808 (National Semiconductor) is a popular 8-bit DAC that requires an input 
reference current and supplies 1 of 256 analog output current levels. Figure 12.121 
shows a block diagram of the DAC0808, along with its IC pin configuration and a 
sample application circuit.
In the application circuit, the analog output range is set by applying a reference 
current (Iref) to pin 14 (+Vref). In this example, Iref is set to 2 mA via an external +10 V/5 
kΩ resistor combination. Note that another 5-kΩ resistor is required between pin 15 
(−Vref) and ground.

At full scale (all A’s high or binary 255), Iout = Iref (255/256) = (2 mA)(0.996) = 1.99 
mA. Considering that the DAC has 256 analog output levels, we can figure that each 
corresponding level is spaced 1.99 mA/256 = 0.0078 mA apart.
To convert the analog output currents into analog output voltages, we attach the 
op amp. Using the op amp rules from Chap. 8, we find that the output voltage is 
Vout = Iout × Rf. At full scale, Vout = (1.99 mA)(5 kΩ) = 9.95 V. Each analog output level 
is spaced 9.95 V/256 = 0.0389 V apart.
The DAC0808 can be configured as a multiplying DAC by applying the analog 
input signal to the reference input. In this case, however, the analog input current 
should be limited to a range from 16 µA to 4 mA to retain reasonable accuracy. See 
the National Semiconductor’s data sheets for more details.
DAC8043A SERIAL 12-BIT INPUT MULTIPLYING DAC
The DAC8083A (Analog Devices) is a high-precision 12-bit CMOS multiplying DAC 
that comes with a serial digital input. Figure 12.122 shows a block diagram, pin con-
figuration, and write cycle timing diagram for this device.
FIGURE 12.121
FIGURE 12.122

810    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Before the DAC8043 can make a conversion, serial data must be clocked into the 
input register by supplying an external clock signal (each positive edge of the clock 
load one bit). Once loaded, the input register’s contents are dumped off to the DAC 
register by applying a low pulse to the LD line. Data in the DAC register is then con-
verted to an output current through the Iout terminal. 
In most applications, this current is then transformed into a voltage by an op 
amp stage, as is the case within the two circuits shown in Fig. 12.123. In the unipolar 
(two-quadrant) circuit, a standard binary code is used to select from 4096 possible 
analog output levels. In the bipolar (four-quadrant) circuit, an offset binary code is 
used again to select from 4096 analog output levels, but now the range is broken up 
to accommodate both positive and negative polarities.

12.9.6  Analog-to-Digital Converters
There are a number of techniques used to convert analog signals into digital sig-
nals. The most popular techniques include successive approximation conversion 
and parallel-encoded conversion (or flash conversion). Other techniques include 
half-flash conversion, delta-sigma processing, and pulse-code modulation (PCM). 
In this section, we’ll focus on the successive approximation and parallel-encoded 
conversion techniques. Most microcontrollers will have built-in ADC channels 
using one of the techniques described here.
Successive Approximation
Successive approximation analog-to-digital conversion is the most common approach 
used in integrated ADCs. In this conversion technique, each bit of the binary output 
is found, one bit at a time—MSB first. This technique yields fairly fast conversion 
times (from around 10 to 300 µs) with a limited amount of circuitry. Figure 12.124 
shows a simple 8-bit successive approximation ADC, along with an example analog-
to-digital conversion sequence.
FIGURE 12.124
To begin a conversion, the SC  (start conversion) input is pulsed low. This causes 
the successive approximation register (SAR) to first apply a high on the MSB (D7) 
line of the DAC. With only D7 high, the DAC’s output is driven to one-half its full-
scale level, which in this case is +5 V because the full-scale output is +10 V. The +5-V 
output level from the DAC is then compared with the analog input level, via the 
comparator. If the analog input level is greater than +5 V, the SAR keeps the D7 line 
high; otherwise, the SAR returns the D7 line low. At the next clock pulse, the next bit 
(D6) is tried. Again, if the analog input level is larger than the DAC’s output level, D6 
is left high; otherwise, it is returned low.
During the next six clock pulses, the rest of the bits are tried. After the last bit 
(LSB) is tried, the CC (conversion complete) output of the SAR goes low, indicating 
that a valid 8-bit conversion is complete, and the binary data is ready to be clocked 
into the octal flip-flop, where it can be presented to the Q0–Q7 outputs. 

812    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The timing diagram shows a 3.8652-V analog level being converted into an 
approximate digital equivalent. Note that after the first approximation (the D7 try), 
the percentage error between the actual analog level and corresponding digital 
equivalent is 29.360 percent. However, after the final approximation, the percentage 
error is reduced to only 0.051 percent.
Until now, we’ve assumed that the analog input to our ADC was constant during 
the conversion. But what happens when the analog input changes during conversion 
time? Errors result. The more rapidly the analog input changes during the conversion 
time, the more pronounced the errors will become. To prevent such errors, a sample-
and-hold circuit is often attached to the analog input. With an external control signal, 
this circuit can be made to sample the analog input voltage and hold the sample 
while the ADC makes the conversion. 
With the exception of very high-speed ADCs, separate ADC ICs are now largely 
redundant and have been replaced with microcontrollers containing 12-bit or higher 
ADC channels.
Parallel-Encoded Analog-to-Digital Conversion (Flash Conversion)
Parallel-encoded analog-to-digital conversion, or flash conversion, is perhaps the 
easiest conversion process to understand. To illustrate the basics behind parallel 
encoding (also referred to as simultaneous multiple comparator or flash converting), let’s 
take a look at the simple 3-bit converter in Fig. 12.125.
FIGURE 12.125
The set of comparators is the key feature to note in this circuit. Each comparator 
is supplied with a different reference voltage from the 1 kΩ voltage divider network. 
Since we’ve set up a +5V reference voltage, the voltage drop across each resistor 
within the voltage divider network is 0.625 V. From this, you can determine the 
specific reference voltages given to each comparator (see Fig. 12.125).
To convert an analog signal into a digital number, the analog signal is applied to 
all the comparators at the same time, via the common line attached to the inverting 
inputs of all the comparators. If the analog voltage is between, say, 2.500 and 3.125 V, 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    813
only those comparators with reference voltage below 2.500 V will output a high. To 
create a 3-bit binary output, the eight comparator outputs are fed into an octal-to-
binary priority encoder. A D latch also can be incorporated into the circuit to provide 
enable control of the binary output. The truth table should fill in the rest.
12.10  Displays
A number of displays can be interfaced with control logic to display numbers, let-
ters, special characters, and graphics. Two popular displays that we’ll consider here 
include the light-emitting diode (LED) display and the liquid-crystal display (LCD).
12.10.1  LED Displays
LED displays come in three basic configurations: numeric (numbers), alphanumeric 
(numbers and letters), and dot-matrix forms (see Fig. 12.126). Numeric displays 
consist of seven LED segments. Each LED segment is given a letter designation, 
as shown in the figure. Seven-segment LED displays are most frequently used to 
generate numbers (0–9), but they also can be used to display hexadecimal (0–9, A, 
B, C, D, E, F). The 14-segment, 16-segment, and special 4 × 7 dot matrix displays  
are alphanumeric. The 5 × 7 dot matrix display is both alphanumeric and graphic—
you can display unique characters and simple graphics. See Chap. 5 for information 
about other types of LED displays.
FIGURE 12.126
Direct Drive of Numeric LED Displays
Seven-segment LED displays come in two varieties: common anode and common 
cathode. Figure 12.128 shows single digital eight-segment (seven digit segments + 
decimal point) displays of both varieties.
When driving a multidigit display, say, one with eight digits, the previous tech-
nique becomes awkward. It requires eight discrete decoder/driver ICs. One way to 
avoid this problem is to use a special direct-drive LED display driver IC. 
For example, National Semiconductor’s MM5450, shown in Fig. 12.133, is designed 
to drive 4- or 5-digit alphanumeric common anode LED displays. It comes with 34 
TTL-compatible outputs that are used to drive desired LED segments within a display. 
Each of these outputs can sink up to 15 mA. In order to specify which output lines 
are driven high or low, serial input data are clocked into the driver’s serial input. The 
serial data chain that is entered is 36 bits long. The first bit is a start bit (set to 1), and 
the remaining 35 bits are data bits. Each data bit corresponds to a given output data 

814    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
FIGURE 12.128
To drive a given segment of a common anode display, current must be sunk out through the 
corresponding segment’s terminal. With the common cathode display, current must be sourced 
into the corresponding segment’s terminal. A simple way to drive these displays is to use BCD to 
seven-segment display decoder/drivers, like the ones show in the figure. Applying a BCD input 
character results in a decimal digit being displayed (e.g., 0101 applied to A0–A3, or A–D displays a 
“5”). The 74LS47 active-low open-collector outputs are suited for a common anode display, while 
the 74HC4511’s active-high outputs are suited for a common cathode display. Both ICs also come 
with extra terminals used for lamp testing and ripple blanking, as well as leading zero suppres-
sion (controlling the decimal point).
FIGURE 12.127

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    815
line that is used to drive a given LED segment within the display. At the thirty-sixth 
positive clock signal, a LOAD signal is generated that loads the 35 data bits into the 
latches (see the block diagram in Fig. 12.133). At the low state of the clock, a RESET
signal is generated that clears the shift register for the next set of data. You can learn 
more about the MM5450 at http://www.micrel.com/_PDF/mm5450.pdf.
Multiplexed LED Displays
Another technique used to drive multidigit LED displays involves multiplexing. 
Multiplexing can drastically reduce the number of connections needed between dis-
play and control logic. In a multiplexed display, digits share common segment lines. 
Also, only one digit within the display is lighted at a time. To make it appear that a 
complete readout is displayed, all the digits must be flashed very rapidly in sequence, 
over and over again. The simple example in Fig. 12.129 shows multiplexing in action.
To reduce the component count further, you can do away with the 74HC4511 and just 
use 7 digital outputs from the microcontroller.
FIGURE 12.129
Here, we have a multiplexed common-cathode 
display—all digits share common segment 
lines (a–g). To supply a full one-digit readout, 
digits must be flashed rapidly, one at a time. 
To enable a given digit, the digit’s common 
line is grounded via one of the digital drivers 
(transistors)—all other digits’ common lines 
are left floating. In this example, the drivers 
are controlled by a microcontroller. To light the 
segments of a given digit, the microcontroller 
supplies the appropriate 4-bit BCD code to the 
seven-segment decoder/driver (74HC4511). As an 
example, if we wanted to display 1234, we would 
need to program the microcontroller (using soft-
ware) to turn off all digits except the MSD (left-
most digit) and then supply the decoder/driver 
with the BCD code for 1. Then the next signifi-
cant digit (2) would be driven, and then the next 
significant digit (3), and then the LSD (4). After 
that, the process would recycle for as long as we 
wanted our program to display 1234.
12.10.2  Liquid-Crystal Displays
In low-power CMOS digital systems (for example, battery- or solar-powered elec-
tronic devices), the dissipation of an LED display can consume most of a system’s 
power requirements, which is something you want to avoid, especially since you are 
looking to save power when using CMOSs. LCDs, on the other hand, are ideal for 
low-power applications.
Unlike an LED display, an LCD is a passive device. This means that instead of using 
electric current to generate light, it uses light that is already externally present (such as 
sunlight, room lighting). For the LCD’s optical effects to occur, the external light source 
needs to supply only a minute amount of power (within the mW/cm2 range).

816    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
One disadvantage with LCDs is their slow switching speeds (the time it takes 
for a new digit/character to appear). Typical switching speeds for LCDs range from 
around 40 to 100 ms. At low temperatures, the switching speeds get even worse. 
Another problem with LCDs is the requirement that external light be present. Though 
there are LCD displays that come with backlighting (such as an LED behind the dis-
play), obviously, this will increase power consumption.
“Smart” Alphanumeric Display
The HPDL-1414 is a “smart,” 
4-character, 16-segment display. 
This device is complete with LEDs, 
on-board 4-word ASCII memory, 
a 64-word character generator, 
17-segment drivers, 4-digit drivers, 
and scanning circuitry necessary to 
multiplex the four LED characters. 
It is TTL-compatible and relatively 
easy to use. The seven data inputs 
D0 to D6 accept a 7-bit ASCII code, 
while the digital select inputs A0 
and A1 accept a 2-bit binary code 
that is used to specify which of 
the four digits is to be lighted. The 
WRITE WR
(
)  input is used to load 
new data into memory. After a 
character has been written to mem-
ory, the IC decodes the ASCII data, 
drives the display, and refreshes it 
without the need for external hard-
ware or software.
FIGURE 12.131
Figure 12.130 shows a common 
anode, 2-character, 14-segment 
(+ decimal) alphanumeric dis-
play. Notice that the segments of 
the two characters are internally 
wired together. This means that 
the display is designed for mul-
tiplexing. Though it is possible 
to use a microcontroller along 
with transistor drivers to control 
this display, the number of lines 
required is fairly large. Another 
option is to use a special driver 
IC, like Intersil’s ICM7243B 
14-segment 6-bit ASCII driver. 
Another alternative is simply to 
avoid using this kind of display 
and use a “smart” alphanumeric 
display that contains all the nec-
essary control logic (drivers, code 
converters, and so on).

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    817
Basic Explanation of How an LCD Works
An LCD consists of a number of layers that include a polarizer, a set of transparent 
electrodes, a liquid-crystal element, a transparent back electrode, a second polarizer, 
and a mirror (see the leftmost illustration in Fig. 12.132).
The transparent top electrodes are used to generate the individual segments of 
a digit, character, and so on, while the transparent back electrode forms a common 
plane, often referred to as the back plane (BP). The top electrode segments and the 
back electrode are wired to external contacts. With no potential difference between 
a given top electrode and the back electrode, the region where the top electrode is 
located appears silver in color against a silver background. However, when a poten-
tial is applied between a given top electrode and back electrode, the region where the 
top electrode is located appears dark against a silver background.
The circuit in Fig. 12.132 shows a basic way to drive a seven-segment LCD. It uses 
a 74HC4511 BCD decoder and XOR gates to generate the prior drive signals for the 
LCD. A very important thing to note in this circuit is the clock. As it turns out, an 
LCD actually requires ac drive signals (for example, squarewaves) instead of dc drive 
signals. If dc were used, the primary component of the display—namely, the liquid 
crystal—would undergo electrochemical degradation (more on the liquid crystal in 
a moment). The optimal frequency of the applied ac drive signal is typically from 
around 25 Hz to a couple hundred hertz. Now that we understand that, it is easy to 
see why we need the XOR gates. 
As the clock delivers squarewaves to the back electrode (back plane, or BP), the XOR 
gates act as enable gates that pass and invert a signal and apply it to a given top electrode 
segment. For example, if a BCD code of 1001 (5) is applied to the decoder, the decoder’s 
outputs a, c, d, f, and g go high, while outputs b and e go low. When a positive clock pulse 
arrives, XOR gates attached to the outputs that are high invert the high levels. XOR gates 
attached to outputs that are low pass on the low levels. During the same pulse duration, 
the back plane is set high. Potentials now are present between a, c, d, f, and g segments 
and the back plane, and therefore these segments appear dark. Segments b and e, along 
FIGURE 12.132

818    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
with the background, appear silverish because no potential exists between them and 
the back plane. Now, when the clock pulse goes low, the display remains the same (pro-
vided the BCD input hasn’t changed), since all that has occurred is a reverse in polarity. 
This has no effect on the optical properties of the display.
Detailed Explanation of How an LCD Works (the Physics)
Figure 12.133 shows how an LCD generates a clear (silverish) segment. When con-
trol signals sent to the transparent top and back electrodes are in phase, no poten-
tial exists between the two electrodes. With no potential present, the cigar-shaped 
organic liquid crystals (nematic crystals) arrange themselves in spiral state, as shown 
in the figure. 
FIGURE 12.133
The upper crystal aligns itself horizontal to the page, while the lowest crystal 
aligns itself perpendicular to the page. The upper crystal and the lower crystal are 
held in place by tiny grooves that are etched into the inner surfaces of the glass sur-
faces of the cell. Crystals in between the upper crystal and the lower crystal progres-
sively spiral 90° due to electrostatic forces that exist between neighboring crystals. 
When polarized light passes through a region of the display that contains these spi-
rals, the polarization angle of the light is rotated 90°. 
Now, looking at the display as a whole, when incident unpolarized light passes 
through polarizer 1 (as shown in the figure), the light becomes polarized in the same 
direction of the plane of polarization of the first polarizer. The polarized light then 
passes through the transparent top electrode and enters the liquid-crystal cell. As 
it passes through the cell, its polarization angle is rotated 90°. The polarized light 
that exits the cell then passes through the transparent back electrode and the second 
polarizer without problems. (If we were to remove the liquid-crystal cell, all polar-
ized light that passed through the first polarizer would be absorbed, since we would 
have crossed polarizers.) The light that passes through the second polarizer then 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    819
reflects off the mirror, passes through the second polarizer, on through the liquid-
crystal cell (getting rotated 90°), through the first polarizer, and finally reaches the 
observer’s eye. This reflected light appears silver in color. Note that the background 
of LCDs constantly appears silver because no potential exists across the liquid-
crystal cell in the background region.
Figure 12.134 shows how an LCD generates a dark segment. When control sig-
nals sent to the top and back electrodes are out of phase, a potential difference exists 
between the two electrodes. This causes the crystals to align themselves in a parallel 
manner, as shown in the figure. When the polarized light from the first polarizer 
passes through the cell region containing these parallel crystals, nothing happens—
the polarization angle stays the same. However, when the light comes in contact 
with the second polarizer, it is absorbed because the angle of polarization of the light 
and the plane of polarization of the second polarizer are perpendicular to each other. 
Since light reaches the mirror, no light is reflected back to the observer’s eye, and 
hence the segment appears dark.
FIGURE 12.134
The LCD shown in Fig. 12.133 represents what is referred to as a standard twisted 
nematic display. Another common LCD is the supertwist nematic display. Unlike the 
standard twisted display, this display’s nematic crystals rotate 270° from top to 
bottom. The extra 180° twist improves the contrast and viewing angle.
Driving LCDs
CD4543B CMOS BCD-TO-SEVEN-SEGMENT LATCH/DECODER/DRIVER 
The CD4543B (Texas Instruments), shown in Fig. 12.135, is a BCD-to-seven-segment 
latch/decoder/driver that is designed for LCDs, as well as for LED displays. When 
used to drive LCDs, a squarewave must be applied simultaneously to the CD4543B’s 
Phase (Ph) input and to the LCD’s back plane. When used to drive LED displays, 
a high is required at the Phase input for common cathode displays, while a low is 

820    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
required for common anode displays. To blank the display (set outputs a–g low), the 
BL input is set high. The CD4543B also comes with a Latch Disable input (LD), which 
can be used to latch onto input data, preventing new input data from altering the 
display.
MM5453 LCD DRIVER
The MM5453 (National Semiconductor) is a 40-pin IC that can drive up to 33 seg-
ments of an LCD, which can be used to drive 41⁄2-digit seven-segment displays. It 
houses an internal oscillator section (requiring an external RC circuit) that generates 
the necessary squarewaves used to drive the LCD. To activate given segments within 
the display, a serial code is applied to the data input. The code first starts out with 
a start bit (high) followed by data bits that specify which outputs should be driven 
high or low. Figure 12.136 shows an example display circuit, along with correspond-
ing data format required to drive a 41⁄2-digit display.
VI-322-DP LCD AND ICL7106 31⁄2-DIGIT LCD, ADC DRIVER
There are a number of specialized LCDs that can be found in the electronics cat-
alogs. An example is Varitronix’s VI-322-DP 31⁄2-digit (plus ∼, +, BAT, ∆) LCD, 
shown in Fig. 12.136. This display is configured in a static drive arrangement 
(each segment has a separate lead) and is found in many test instruments. To 
drive this display, you first check to see what kind of driver the manufacturer 
suggests. In this case, the manufacturer suggests using Intersil’s ICL7106. This 
IC is a 31⁄2-digit LCD/LED display driver as well as an ADC. This dual-purpose 
feature makes it easy to interface transducers directly to the same IC that is driving 
the display. To learn how to use the ICL7106, check out Intersil’s data sheet at 
http://www.intersil.com.
FIGURE 12.135

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    821
Multiplexed LCDs
We have just seen examples of static-drive-type LCDs, where each segment (to elec-
trode) had its own lead, and a single common plane was used as the back electrode. 
Another type of LCD is designed with multiplexing in mind and is referred to as 
dynamic drive or multiplexed display. 
As with the multiplexed LED display, multiplexed LCDs can greatly reduce the 
number of external connections required between the display and driver. However, 
they require increased complexity in drive circuitry (or software) to drive. In a 
FIGURE 12.136
FIGURE 12.137

822    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
multiplexed LCD, appropriate segments are connected together to form groups that 
are sequentially addressed by means of multiple back-plane electrodes.
“Intelligent” Dot-Matrix LCD Modules
Dot-matrix LCDs are used to display alphanumeric characters and other symbols. 
These displays are used in cell phones, calculators, vending machines, and many 
other devices that provide the user with simple textual information. Dot-matrix LCDs 
are also used in laptop computer screens; however, these displays incorporate special 
filters, multicolor back lighting, and so on. For practical purposes, we’ll concentrate 
on the simple alphanumeric LCDs.
An alphanumeric LCD screen is usually divided into a number of 5 × 8 pixel blocks, 
with vertical and horizontal spaces separating each block. Figure 12.138 shows a dis-
play with 20 columns and 4 rows of 5 × 8 pixel blocks. Other standard configurations 
come with 8, 16, 20, 24, 32, or 40 columns and 1, 2, or 4 rows. To generate a character 
within a given block requires that each pixel within the block be turned on or off. As 
you can imagine, to control so many different pixels (electrode segments) requires a 
great deal of sophistication. For this reason, an intelligent driver IC is required.
FIGURE 12.138
Almost all alphanumeric LCD modules are controlled by Hitachi’s HD44780 (or 
equivalent) driver IC. This driver contains the following:
• A permanent memory (CG ROM) that stores 192 alphanumeric characters
• A random access memory (DD RAM) used to store the display’s contents
• A second random access memory (CG RAM) used to hold custom symbols
• Input lines for data and instruction control signals
• Multiplexed outputs for driving LCD pixels
• Additional outputs for communicating with expansion chips to drive more LCD 
pixels

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    823
This driver is built right into the LCD module. (You could attempt to construct 
your own module by interfacing the driver with an LCD, but it would not be worth 
the effort—the numerous tiny connections would drive you nuts.) From now on, all 
modules described in this section are assumed to be HD44780-driven.
BASIC OVERVIEW OF THE PINS
The standard LCD module comes with a 14-pin interface: eight data lines (D0–D7), 
three control lines (RS, W/R, and E), and three power lines (VDD, VSS, and VEE). 
VDD (pin 2) and VSS (pin 1) are the module’s positive and negative power supply 
leads. Usually, VDD is set to +5 V, while VSS is grounded. VEE (pin 3) is the display’s 
contrast control. By changing the voltage applied to this lead, the contrast of the dis-
play increases or decreases. A potentiometer placed between supply voltages, with 
its wiper connected to VEE, allows for manual adjustment. 
D0–D7 (pins 7–14) are the data bus lines. Data can be transferred to and from the 
display either as a single 8-bit byte or as two 4-bit nibbles. In the latter case, only the 
upper four data lines (D4–D7) are used. 
RS (pin 4) is the Register Select line. When this line is low, data bytes transferred 
to the display module are interpreted as commands, and data bytes read from the 
display module indicate its status. When the RS line is set high, character data can be 
transferred to and from the display module. 
R/W (pin 5) is the Read/Write control line. To write commands or character data 
to the module, R/W is set low. To read character data or status information from the 
module, R/W is set high. 
E (pin 6) is the Enable control input, which is used to initiate the actual transfer 
of command or character data to and from the module. When writing to the display, 
data on the D0–D7 lines is transferred to the display when the enable input receives a 
high-to-low transition. When reading from the display, data become available to the 
D0–D7 lines shortly after a low-to-high transition occurs at the enable input and will 
remain available until the signal goes low again.
Figure 12.139 shows the instruction set and standard set of characters for an LCD 
module. Next, we’ll go through some examples illustrating how to use the instruc-
tions and how to write characters to the display.
TEST CIRCUIT USED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO CONTROL THE LCD MODULE
Figure 12.140 shows a simple test circuit that is quite useful for learning how to 
send commands and character data to the LCD module. (In reality, the LCD module 
is connected to a microprocessor or microcontroller, as shown to the left in the figure.) 
In this circuit, switches connected to data inputs use pullup resistors in order to 
supply a high (1) when the switch is open or supply a low (0) when the switch is 
closed. 
The enable input receives its high and low levels from a debounced toggle switch. 
Debouncing the enable switch prevents the likelihood of multiple enable signals being 
generated. Multiple enable signals tend to create unwanted effects, such as generating 
the same character over and over again across the display. The 5-kΩ pot is used for 
contrast. Note that in this circuit, we’ve grounded the R/W line, which means we’ll 
only deal with writing to the display.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    825
WHEN POWER IS FIRST APPLIED
When power is first applied to the display, the display module resets itself to its initial 
settings. Initial settings are indicated in the LCD instruction set with an asterisk. As indi-
cated, the display is actually turned off during the initial setting condition. If we attempt 
to write character data to the display now, nothing will show up. In order to show some-
thing, we must issue a command to the module telling it to turn on its display. 
According to the instruction set, the Display & Cursor On/Off instruction can be 
used to turn on the display. At the same time, this instruction also selects the cursor 
style. For example, if we apply the command code 0000 1111 to D7–D0, making sure to 
keep RS low so the module will interpret data as a command, a blinking cursor with 
an underline should appear at the top leftmost position on the display. But before this 
command can take effect, it must be sent to the module by momentarily setting the 
Enable (E) line low.
Another important instruction that should be implemented after power-up is the 
Function Set command. When a two-line display is used, this command tells the 
module to turn on the second line. It also tells the module what kind of data transfer 
is going to be used (8-bit or 4-bit), and whether a 5 × 10 or 5 × 7 pixel format will be 
used (5 × 10 is found in some one-line displays). Assuming that the display used in 
our example circuit is a two-line display, we can send the command 0011 1000 telling 
the display to turn on both lines, use an 8-bit transfer, and provide a 5 × 7 pixel char-
acter format. Again, to send this command, we set RS low, then supply the command 
data to D7–D0, and finally pulse E low.
Now that the module knows what format to use, we can try writing a character to 
the display. To do this, we set the module to character mode by setting RS high. Next, 
we apply one of the 8-bit codes listed in the standard LCD character set table to the 
data inputs D7–D0. For example, if we want to display the letter Q, we apply 01010001 
(hex 51 or 51H). To send the character data to the LCD module, we pulse E low. A Q 
should then appear on the display. To clear the screen, we use the Clear Display com-
mand 0000 0001, remembering to keep RS low and then pulsing E low.
FIGURE 12.140

826    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
ADDRESSING
After power-up, the module’s cursor is positioned at the far-left corner of the first line 
of the display. This display location is assigned a hexadecimal address of 00H. As new 
characters are entered, the cursor automatically moves to the right to a new address 
of 01H, then 02H, and so on. Although this automatic incrementing feature makes life 
easy when entering characters, there are times when it is necessary to set the cursor 
position to a location other than the first address location.
To set the cursor to another address location, a new starting address must be 
entered as a command. There are 128 different addresses to choose from, although 
not all these addresses have their own display location. In fact, there are only 80 dis-
play locations laid out on a single line in one-line mode or 40 display locations laid 
out on each line in two-line mode. Now, as it turns out, not all display locations are 
necessarily visible on the screen at one time. This will be made more apparent in a 
moment. Let’s first try a simple address example with the LCD module set to two-
line mode (provided that two lines are actually available).
To position the cursor to a desired location, we use the Set Address command. 
This command is specified with the binary code 1000 0000 + (binary value of desired 
hex address). For example, to send a command telling the cursor to jump to the 07H 
address location, we apply (1000 0000 + 0000 0111) = 1000 0111 to the D7–D0 inputs, 
remembering to hold RS low and then pulsing E low. The cursor should now be 
located at the eighth position over from the left.
It is important to realize that the relationship between addresses and display loca-
tions varies from module to module. Most displays are configured with two lines of 
characters, with the first line starting at address 00H and the second line at address 
40H. Figure 12.141 shows the relationship between the address and display locations 
for various LCD modules. Note that the four-line module is really a two-line type 
with the two lines split, as shown in the figure.
FIGURE 12.141
SHIFTING THE DISPLAY
Regardless of their size, LCD modules have 80 display locations that can be writ-
ten to. With smaller displays, not all 80 locations can be displayed at once on the 
screen. For example, if we were to enter all the letters of the alphabet onto the first 
line of a 20-character display, only letters A through T would appear on the screen. 
Letters S through Z, along with the cursor, would be “pushed off” to the right of 
the screen, hidden from view. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    827
To bring these hidden characters into view, we can apply the Cursor/Display 
Shift command to shift all display locations to the left. The command for shifting to 
the left is 0001 1000. Every time this command is issued, the characters shift one step 
to the left. In our example, it would take seven of these commands to bring T through 
Z and the cursor into view.
To shift things to the right, we apply the command 0001 1100. To bring the cursor 
back to address 00H and shift the display address 00H back to the left-hand side of the 
display, a Cursor Home command (0000 0010) can be issued. Another alternative is 
to use the Clear Display command 0000 0001. However, this command also clears all 
display locations.
CHARACTER ENTRY MODE
If you do not want to enter characters from left to right, you can use the Character 
Entry Mode command to enter characters from right to left. To do this, the cursor must 
first be sent to the rightmost display location on the screen. After that, the Character 
Entry Mode command 0000 0111 is entered into the module. This sets the entry mode 
to autoincrement/display shift left. Now, when characters are entered, they appear 
on the right-hand side, while the display shifts left for each character entered.
USER-DEFINED GRAPHICS
Commands 0100 0000 to 0111 1111 are used to program user-defined graphics. To 
program these graphics on-screen, the display is cleared, and the module is sent a Set 
Display Address command to position the cursor at address 00H. At this point, the 
contents of the eight user character locations can be viewed by entering binary data 
0000 0000 to 0000 0111 in sequence. These characters will appear initially as garbage.
To start defining the user-defined graphics, a Set CGRAM command is sent to 
the module. Any value between 0100 0000 (40H) and 0111 1111 (7F) will work. Data 
entered from now on will be used to construct the user-defined graph, row by row. 
For example, to create a light bulb, the following data entries are made: 0000 1110, 
0001 0001, 0001 0001, 0001 0001, 0000 1110, 0000 1010, 0000 1110, 0000 0100. 
Notice that the first three most significant bits are always 0 because there are only 
5 pixels per row. Other user-defined graphics can be defined by entering the 8-byte 
sequence, and so on. Figure 12.142 shows how the CGRAM address corresponds to 
the individual pixels of the user-defined graphic.
FIGURE 12.142

828    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
There are up to eight user-defined graphics that can be programmed. These then 
become part of the character set and can be displayed by using codes 0000 0000 to 
0000 1111 or 0000 1000 to 0000 1111, both of which produce the same result.
One problem when creating user-defined graphics is they will be lost when 
power is removed from the module—a result of the volatile CGRAM. Typically, the 
user-defined graphic data is actually stored in an external nonvolatile EPROM or 
EEPROM, where the data is copied by a microprocessor and loaded into the display 
module sometime after power-up.
4-BIT DATA TRANSFER
As indicated in the Function Set command, the LCD module is capable of both 8-bit 
and 4-bit data transfer. In 4-bit mode, only data lines D4–D7 are used. The other four 
lines, D0–D3, are left either floating or tied to the power supply. To send data to the 
display requires sending two 4-bit chunks instead of one 8-bit word.
When power is first applied, the module is set up for 8-bit transfer. To set up 
4-bit transfer, the Function Set command with binary value 0010 0000 is sent to the 
display. Note that since there are only four data lines in use, all 8 bits cannot be sent. 
However, this is not a problem, since the 8-bit/4-bit selection is on data bit D4. From 
now on, 8-bit character and command bits must be sent in two halves, the first 4 most 
significant bits and then the remaining 4 bits. For example, to write character data 
0100 1110 to the display requires setting RS high, applying 0100 to the data lines, 
pulsing E low, then applying 1110 to the data lines, and pulsing E low again.
The 4-bit transfer is frequently used when the LCD module is interfaced with a 
microcontroller that has limited I/O lines. See Fig. 12.142.
12.11  Memory Devices
Memory devices provide a means of storing data on a temporary or permanent basis for 
future recall. The storage medium used in a memory device may be a semiconductor-
based IC (primary memory), a magnetic tape, a magnetic disk, or an optical disk 
(secondary memories). In most cases, the secondary memories are capable of storing 
more data than primary memories because their surface areas are larger. However, 
secondary memories take much longer to access (read or write) data because memory 
locations on a disk or tape must be physically positioned to the point where they can be 
read or written to by the read/write mechanism. Within a primary memory device, 
memory locations are arranged in tiny regions within a large matrix, where each 
memory location can be accessed quickly (matter of nanoseconds) by applying the 
proper address signals to the rows within the matrix.
Figure 12.143 shows an overview of primary and secondary memories. In this 
section, we’ll discuss only the primary memories, since these devices are used more 
frequently in designing gadgets than secondary memories. Secondary memories are 
almost exclusively used for storing large amounts of computer data, audio data, or 
video data.
Today, the technology used in the construction of primary memory devices is 
almost exclusively based on MOSFET transistors. Bipolar transistors are also used 
within memory ICs. However, these devices are less popular because the amount 
of data they can store is significantly smaller than that of a memory IC built with 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    829
MOSFET transistors. At one time, bipolar memories had a significant edge in speed 
over MOSFET memories, but today the speed gap has almost disappeared.
Memory devices consist of two basic subfamilies: read-only memory (ROM) and 
read/write memory (RWM), which is more commonly referred to as random-access 
memory (RAM). Within each of these subfamilies exist more subfamilies, as shown in 
Fig. 12.143. Let’s start out by discussing the ROM devices.
12.11.1  Read-Only Memory
ROM is used to store data on a permanent basis. These devices are capable of random 
access, like RAM devices, but unlike RAM devices, they do not lose stored data when 
power is removed from the IC. 
ROM is used in nearly all computers to store boot-up instructions (such as stack 
allocation, port and interrupt initializations, and instructions for retrieving the 
operating system from disk storage) that are enacted when the computer is first 
turned on. 
In some microcontroller applications (simple-function gadgets, appliances, 
toys, and so on), the entire stand-alone program resides in ROM. The microcon-
troller’s central processing unit (CPU) retrieves the program instructions and uses 
volatile RAM for temporary data storage as it runs through the ROM’s stored 
instructions. 
In some instances, you find ROM within discrete digital hardware, where it is 
used to store lookup tables or special code-conversion routines. For example, digital 
data from an ADC could be used to address stored words that represent, say, a binary 
equivalent to a temperature reading in Celsius or Fahrenheit. This also can be used 
to replace a complex logic circuit, where, instead of using a large number of discrete 
gates to get the desired function table, you simply program the ROM to provide the 
designed output response when input data is applied. The last few applications men-
tioned, however, are becoming a bit obsolete—the microcontroller seems to be taking 
over everything.
ROM is generally used for read-only operations and not written to after initially 
programmed. However, some ROM-like devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and 
flash memory, are capable of erasing stored data and rewriting data to memory. 
Before we take a look at these erasable ROM-like devices, let’s first cover some mem-
ory basics.
FIGURE 12.143

830    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
12.11.2  Simple ROM Made Using Diodes
To get a general idea of how ROM works, let’s consider the simple circuit in Fig. 12.144.
In reality, today’s ROM devices rarely use diode memory cells. Instead, they 
typically use transistor-like memory cells formed on silicon wafers. Also, a more 
realistic ROM device comes with three-state output buffers that can be enabled 
or disabled (placed in a high Z state) by applying a control signal. The three-state 
buffers make it possible to effectively disconnect the memory from a data bus 
to which it is attached. (In our simple diode memory circuit, the data is always 
present on the output lines.) The basic layout, with address decoder and memory 
cells, is pretty much the same for all memory devices. There are additional fea-
tures, however, and we’ll discuss these in a minute. First, let’s cover some memory 
nomenclature.
12.11.3  Memory Size and Organization
A ROM that is organized in an n × m matrix can store n different m-bit words; in other 
words, it can store n × m bits of information. To access n different words requires 
log2n address lines. For example, our simple ROM in Fig. 12.144 requires log2 8 = 3 
address inputs (this may look more familiar: 23 = 8). Note that within multiplexed 
memories and memories that come with serial inputs, the actual physical number of 
address inputs is ether reduced or the address information is entered serially, along 
with data and other protocol information. 
In terms of real memory ICs, the number of address inputs is typically eight or 
higher (for parallel input devices at any rate). Common memory sizes are indicated 
FIGURE 12.144
This is a simple ROM device that uses an address 
decoder IC to access eight different 4-bit words 
stored in a diode matrix. Data to be read is output 
via the D3–D0 lines. The diode matrix is broken 
up into rows and columns. The intersection of a 
row and column represents a bit location. When a 
given row and column are linked together with a 
diode, the corresponding data output line goes low 
(0) when the corresponding column is selected by 
the address decoder via the A2–A0 inputs. When a 
specific row is addressed, the NAND gate sinks cur-
rent, so the current from the supply passes through 
the diode and into the NAND gate’s output. This 
makes the corresponding data line low. When no 
diode is placed between a given column and row, 
the corresponding data line goes high (0) when 
the corresponding row is selected by the address 
decoder. (There is no path to ground in this case.) In 
this particular example, we have an 8 ë 4 ROM (eight 
different 4-bit words). By increasing the width of 
the matrix (adding more columns), it is possible to 
increase the word size. By increasing the height of 
the matrix (adding more rows—more addresses), it 
is possible to store more words. In other words, we 
could make an m ë n ROM.

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    831
in Table 12.2. Note that in the table, 1K is used to represent 1024 bits, not 1000 bits, 
as the k (kilo) would lead you to believe. By digital convention, we say that 21 = 2, 22 = 4,  
23 = 8, . . . 28 = 256, 29 = 512, 210 = 1,024 (or 1 K), 211 = 2,048 (or 2 K), . . . 218 = 262,144 (256K), 
219 = 524,288 (540 K), 220 = 1,048,576 (or 1 M, for mega), 221 = 2,097,152 (2 M), . . . 230 = 
1,073,741,824 (or 1 G, for giga), and so on.
If this convention confuses you, it should. It is not exactly obvious, and leaves you 
scratching your head. Also, when a data sheet says 64 K, you need to read further to 
figure out what the actual organization is, say, 2048 × 32 (2 K × 32), 4096 × 16 (4 K × 16), 
8192 × 8 (8 K × 8), 16,384 × 4 (16 K × 4), or another system.
In Table 12.2, watch out for terms such as kB, MB, and GB. These terms refer to 
bytes not bits; the B signifies 1 byte, or 8 bits. This means that a memory that stores 
1 kB actually stores 1 K × 8 (8 K) bits of data. Likewise, memories that store 1 MB 
and 1 GB actually store 1 M × 8 (8 M) and 1 G × 8 (8 G) bits of data, respectively.
12.11.4  Simple Programmable ROM
Figure 12.145 shows a more accurate representation of ROM-type memory. Unlike 
the diode ROM, each memory cell contains a transistor and fusible link. Initially, 
the ROM has all programmable links in place. With every programmable link in 
place, every transistor is biased on, causing high voltage levels (logic 1s) to be stored 
throughout the array. When a programmable link is broken, the corresponding mem-
ory cell’s transistor turns off, and the cell stores a low voltage level (logic 0). Note 
that this ROM contains three-state output buffers that keep the output floating until 
a low is applied to the Chip Enable (
)
CE  input. This feature allows the ROM to be 
interfaced with a data bus.
A basic ROM circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 12.145, along with the appropriate 
address and chip-enable waveforms needed to enact a read operation. To read data 
stored at a given address location, the Chip Enable input is set high to disable the 
chip (remove old data from data outputs)—see time t0. At time t1, a new address is 
placed on the 3-bit address bus (A2, A1, and A0). At time t2, the Chip Enable input is 
set low, which allows addressed data stored in memory to be output via D3, D2, D1, 
and D0. 
In reality, the stored data is not output immediately but is delayed for a very short 
time (from t2 to t3) due to the propagation delay that exists between the initial chip

enable signal and the signal that reaches the enable leads of the output buffers. In 
memory lingo, the time from t1 to t4 is referred to as the access time, which is between 
around 10 ns and a couple hundred nanoseconds, depending on the specific technol-
ogy used.
Now two important questions need addressing:
• How does one “break” a programmable link? In other words, how do we program 
the ROM? 
• Is it possible to restore a broken programmable link back to its unbroken” state? 
In other words, is it possible to reprogram the ROM? 
These lead to the next topic.
12.11.5  ROM Devices
There are basically two kinds of ROMs: those that can be programmed only once 
and those that can be reprogrammed any number of times. One-time program-
mable memories include the mask ROM (MROM) and the programmable ROM 
(PROM). ROMs that can be reprogrammed include the erasable programmable ROM 
(EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), and flash memory.
MROM
An MROM is a custom memory device that is permanently programmed by the 
manufacturer simply by adding or leaving out diodes or transistors within a mem-
ory matrix. In order to create a desired memory configuration, you must supply the 
manufacturer with a truth table stating which data configuration is desired. Using 
the truth table, the manufacturer then generates a mask that is used to create the inter-
connections within the memory matrix during the fabrication process. 
As you can imagine, producing a custom MROM is not exactly cheap; in fact, it 
is rather costly (more than $1,000). It is only worthwhile using an MROM if you plan 
FIGURE 12.145

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    833
to mass produce some device that requires the same data instructions (for example, 
program instructions) over and over again—no upgrades to memory needed in the 
future. In this case, the cost for each IC—after the initial mask is made—is relatively 
cheap, assuming you need more than a couple thousand chips. 
MROMs are commonly found in computers, where they are used to store system 
operating instructions and data that is used to decode keyboard instructions.
PROM
PROMs are fusible-link programmable ROMs. Unlike the MROM, with PROM 
devices, data is not etched in stone. Instead, the manufacturers provide you with a 
memory IC whose matrix is clean (full of 1s). The number of bits and the configura-
tion (n × m) of the matrix vary depending on specific ROM. To program the memory, 
each fusible link must be blown with a high-voltage pulse (such as 21 V). 
The actual process of blowing individual fuses requires a PROM programming 
unit. This PROM programmer typically includes a hardware unit (where the actual 
PROM IC is attached), along with programming cable that is linked to a computer 
(such as via a serial or parallel port). Using software provided by the manufacturer, 
you enter the desired memory configuration in the program running on the computer 
and then press a key, which causes the software program to instruct the external pro-
gramming unit to blow the appropriate links within the IC. 
PROMs are relatively easy to program once you have figured out how to use the 
software, but as with MROMs, once the device is programmed; the memory cannot 
be altered. In other words, if you mess things up, you must begin afresh with a new 
chip. These devices were popular some years ago, but today they are considered 
obsolete.
The most popular ROM-type devices used today are EPROM, EEPROM, and 
flash memory. These devices, unlike MROM and PROM devices, can be erased and 
reprogrammed—a very useful feature when prototyping or designing a gadget that 
requires future memory alterations.
EPROM
An EPROM is a device whose memory matrix consists of a number of specialized 
MOSFET transistors. Unlike a conventional MOSFET transistor, the EPROM transis-
tor has an additional floating gate that is buried beneath the control gate—insulated 
from both the control gate and drain-to-source channel by an oxide layer (see  
Fig. 12.146). 
FIGURE 12.146

834    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
In its erased (unprogrammed) state, the floating gate is uncharged and does not 
affect the normal operation of the control gate (which when addressed results in a 
high voltage or logic 1 being passed through to the data lines). To program an indi-
vidual transistor, a high-voltage pulse (around 12 V) is applied between the control 
gate and the drain terminal. This pulse, in turn, forces energetic electrons through the 
insulating layer and onto the floating gate (referred to as hot electron injection). After 
the high voltage is removed, a negative charge remains on the floating gate and will 
stay there for decades under normal operating conditions.
With the negative charge in place, the normal operation of the control gate is 
inhibited; when the control gate is addressed, the charge on the floating gate prevents 
a high voltage from reaching the data line—the addressed data appears as a low, or 
logic 0.
In order to reprogram (erase) an EPROM, you must first remove the device 
from the circuit and then remove a sticker covering its quartz window. After that, 
you remove all stored charges on the floating gates by shining ultraviolet (UV) 
light through the window onto the interior transistor matrix. The UV light liber-
ates the stored electrons within the floating gate region by supplying them with 
enough energy to force them through the insulation. It usually takes 20 minutes of 
UV exposure for the whole memory matrix to be erased. The number of times an 
EPROM can be reprogrammed is typically limited to a couple hundred cycles. After 
that, the chip degrades considerably.
EPROM is often used as nonvolatile memory within microprocessor-based 
devices that require the provision for future reprogramming. They are frequently 
used in prototyping and then substituted with MROMs during the mass-production 
phase. EPROMs are also integrated within microcontroller chips where their sole 
purpose is to store the microcontroller’s main program (more on this in Chap. 13).
EEPROM
An EEPROM device uses a technology somewhat related to the EPROM, but it 
does not require out-of-circuit programming or UV erasing. Instead, an EEPROM 
device is capable of selective memory cell erasure by means of controlled electrical 
pulses. 
In terms of architecture, an EEPROM memory cell consists of two transistors: one 
transistor resembles the EPROM transistor and is used to store data, and the other 
transistor is used to clear charge from the first transistor’s floating gate. By supplying 
the appropriate voltage level to the second transistor, it is possible to selectively erase 
individual memory cells instead of having to erase the entire memory matrix, as is 
the case with EPROM. The only major disadvantage with EEPROM over EPROM is 
size—due to the two transistors. However, today, with the introduction of new fabri-
cation processes, size is becoming less of an issue.
In terms of applications, EEPROM is ideal for remembering configuration and 
calibration settings of a device when the power is turned off. For example, EEPROM 
is found within TV tuners, where it is used to remember the channel, volume setting 
of the audio amplifier, and so on when the TV is turned off. EEPROM is also found 
on microcontrollers, where it can be used to store the main program or to hold other 
nonvolatile data

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    835
Flash Memory
Flash memory is generally regarded as the next evolutionary step in ROM technol-
ogy that combines the best features of EPROM and EEPROM. These devices have the 
advantage of both in-circuit programming (like EEPROM) and high storage density 
(like EPROM). 
Some variants of flash memory are electrically erasable, like EEPROM, but must 
be erased and reprogrammed on a device-wide basis, similar to EPROM. Other 
devices are based on a dual transistor cell and can be erased and reprogrammed on 
a word-by-word basis. Flash devices are noted for their fast write and erase times, 
which exceed those of EEPROM devices.
Flash memories are becoming very popular as mass-storage devices. They are 
found in digital cameras, where a high-capacity flash memory card is inserted directly 
into a digital camera and can store hundreds or thousands of high-resolution images. 
They are also used in digital music players, cellular phones, tablets, and so on.
Microcontrollers often include flash memory to contain their program. 
Serial Access Memory
So far, we have seen only memories that incorporated parallel access. These devices 
sit directly on the address and data buses, making it easy for processors to quickly 
access the memory. Serial access memory is easy to use in principle; however, since 
all their address lines are typically tied to an address bus within a microprocessor-
based system, it is not uncommon for the data to be inadvertently destroyed when 
the processor runs amuck (issues an undesired write).
Another type of memory that can “hide” the memory from the processor, as well 
as reduce the total number of pins, uses a serial access format. To move data to and 
from memory and the processor, a serial link is used. This serial link imposes a strict 
protocol on data transfers that practically eliminates the possibility that the processor 
can destroy data accidentally.
Figure 12.147 shows a few serial EPROM and EEPROM devices from Microchip. 
The SDA pin found in the EEPROM devices acts as a bidirection data lead used to 
transfer address and data information into the memory IC, as well as transfer data 
out to the processor. The SCL pin is the serial clock input used to synchronize the 
data transfer from and to the device. The 24xx64 and 24LC01B/02B EEPROMs also 
FIGURE 12.147

836    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
come with special device address inputs A0, A1, and A2, which are used for multiple 
device operation. WP is used to enable normal memory operation (read/write entire 
memory) or inhibit write operations.
Controlling a serial memory device is a bit complex, due to the serial protocol 
and variations in protocol from IC to IC. If you want to learn more about these serial 
memories (and you should—they are very handy in microcontroller applications for 
logging data and storing programs and similar tasks), check out the various manu-
facturers’ websites and read through their data sheets.
12.11.6  RAM
The erasable programmable ROM devices, like EEPROM, have limited read/write 
endurance—around 100,000 cycles—and take considerable time to write to memory. 
For applications that require constant and quick read and write cycles, it is necessary 
to use RAM. This type of memory is used for temporary storage of data and program 
instructions in microprocessor-based applications. Unlike ROM devices, however, 
RAM devices are volatile, which means they lose their data if power to the IC is 
interrupted.
There are two basic types of RAM: 
• Static RAM (SRAM): In an SRAM device, data is stored in memory cells that con-
sist of flip-flops. A bit that is written into an SRAM memory cell stays there until 
overwritten or until the power is turned off. 
• Dynamic RAM (DRAM): In a DRAM device, a bit written to the memory cell will 
disappear within milliseconds if not refreshed, or supplied with periodic clocking 
to replenish capacitor charge lost to leakage.
In general, the major practical differences between SRAM and DRAM include 
overall size, power consumption, speed, and ease of use. In terms of size, DRAM 
devices can hold more data per unit area than SRAM devices, since a DRAM’s capaci-
tor takes up less space than an SRAM’s flip-flop. In terms of power consumption, 
SRAMs are more energy-efficient because they do not require constant refreshing. 
In terms of speed and ease of use, SRAMs are superior because they do not require 
refresh circuitry.
In terms of applications, SRAMs are used when relatively small amounts of read/
write memory are needed and are typically found within application-specific ICs 
that require extremely low standby power. For example, they are frequently used 
within portable equipment such as pocket calculators. SRAM is also integrated into 
all modern microprocessors, where it acts as on-chip cache memory that provides a 
high-speed link between the processor and memory. On the other hand, DRAM is 
used in applications where a large amount of read/write memory (within the mega-
byte range) is needed, such as within computer memory modules.
In most situations, you do not need to worry about dealing with discrete RAM 
memory ICs. Most of the time, RAM is already built into a microcontroller or con-
ventionally housed on PCB memory modules that simply plug into a computer’s 
memory banks. In both these cases, you really do not need to know how to use 
the memory, because you can let the existing hardware and software take care of 
the addressing, refreshing, and so on. For this reason, we will not discuss the finer 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    837
details of the various discrete SRAM and DRAM ICs out there. Instead, we will take 
a look at some SRAM and DRAM block diagrams that illustrate the basics, and then 
we will discuss some memory packages, such as SIMMs and DIMMs, that are used 
within computers.
Very Simple SRAM
Figure 12.148 shows a very elementary SRAM that is set up with a 4096 (4 K) × 1-bit 
matrix. It uses 12 address lines to address 4096 different memory locations; each loca-
tion contains a flip-flop. The memory matrix is set up as a 64 × 64 array, with A0 to A5 
identifying the row and A6 to A11 identifying the column to pinpoint the specific loca-
tion to be used. The box labeled “Row Select” is a 6-to-64 decoder for identifying the 
appropriate 1-of-64 row. The box labeled “Column Select” is also a 6-to-64 decoder 
for identifying the appropriate 1-of-64 column.
FIGURE 12.148

838    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
To write a new bit of data to memory, the bit is applied to DIN, the address lines 
are set, the Chip Select input ( CS ) is set low (to enable the chip), and the Write Enable 
input ( WE ) is set low (to enable the DIN buffer). To read a bit of data from memory, 
the address lines are set, CS  is set low, and WE  is set high (to enable the DOUT buffer). 
See the timing waveforms in Fig. 12.148.
By combining eight 4 K × 1 SRAM ICs together, as shown in the lower circuit in 
Fig. 12.148, the memory can be expanded to form a 4 K × 8 configuration, which is 
useful in simple 8-bit microprocessor systems. When an address is applied to the 
address bus, the same address locations within each memory IC are accessed at the 
same time. Therefore, each data bit of an 8-bit word applied to the data bus is stored 
in the same corresponding address locations within the memory ICs.
There are other SRAM ICs that come with configurations larger than n × 1. For 
example, they may come in, say, an n × 4 or n × 8 configuration. As with the n × 1 
devices, these SRAMs can be expanded (two n × 8 devices could be combined to form 
an n × 16 expanded memory, four n × 8 devices could be combined to form an n × 32 
expanded memory, and so on).
Serial SRAM with a similar interface to serial EEPROM is also available. For an 
example of the types of serial SRAM available see http://ww1.microchip.com/
downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22127a.pdf.
Note on Nonvolatile SRAMs
In many applications, it would be ideal to have a memory device that combines both 
the speed and cycle endurance of an SRAM with the nonvolatile characteristics of 
ROM devices. To solve this problem, manufacturers have created what are called 
nonvolatile SRAMs. One such device incorporates a low-power CMOS SRAM together 
with a lithium battery and power-sensory circuitry. When the power is removed from 
the chip, the battery kicks in, providing the flip-flops with sufficient voltage to keep 
them set (or reset). SRAMs with battery backup, however, have limited lifetimes due 
to the life expectancies of the lithium batteries—around ten years.
Another nonvolatile SRAM that requires no battery backup is referred to as non-
volatile RAM (NOVRAM). These chips incorporate a backup EEPROM memory array 
in parallel with an ordinary SRAM array. During normal operation, the SRAM array 
is written to and read from just like an ordinary SRAM. When the power supply 
voltage drops, an onboard circuit automatically senses the drop and performs a store 
operation that causes all data within the volatile SRAM array to be copied to the 
nonvolatile EEPROM array. When power to the chip is turned on, the NOVRAM 
automatically performs a recall operation that copies all the data from the EEPROM 
array back into the SRAM array. A NOVRAM has essentially unlimited read/write 
endurance, like a conventional SRAM, but has a limited number of store-to-EEPROM 
cycles—around 10,000.
DRAM
Figure 12.149 shows a very basic 16 K × 1 DRAM. Normally, to access all 16,384 mem-
ory locations (capacitors) would require 14 address lines. However, in this DRAM 
(as within most large-scale DRAMs), the number of address lines is cut in half by 
multiplexing. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    839
To address a given memory location is a two-step process. First, a 7-bit row 
address is applied to A0–A6, and then Row Address Strobe (
)
RAS  is sent low. Second, 
a 7-bit column address is applied to A0–A6, and then Column Address Strobe (
)
CAS  
is sent low. At this point the memory location is latched and can now be read or writ-
ten to by using the WE input. When WE is low, data is written to the RAM via Din. 
When WE  is high, data is read from the RAM via Dout. See the timing waveforms in 
Fig. 12.149.
Simple DRAM devices like this must be refreshed every 2 ms or sooner to replen-
ish the charge on the internal capacitors. For our simple device, there are three 
ways to refresh the cells: use a Read cycle, use a Write cycle, or use an RAS -only 
cycle. Unless you are reading or writing to and from all 128 rows every 2 ms, the 
RAS -only cycle is the preferred technique. To perform this cycle, CAS is set high, 
A0–A6 are set up with the row address 000 0000, RAS  is pulsed low, the row address 
FIGURE 12.149

840    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is then incremented by 1, and the last two steps are repeated until all 128 rows have 
been accessed.
As you can see, needing to come up with the timing waveforms to refresh the 
memory is a real pain. For this reason, manufacturers produce DRAM controllers 
or actually incorporate automatic refreshing circuitry within the DRAM IC. In other 
words, today’s DRAMs have all the “housekeeping” functions built in. Practically 
speaking, this makes the DRAM appear static to the user.
DRAM technology is changing very rapidly. Today, there are a number of DRAM-
like devices that go by such names as ECC DRAM, EDO DRAM, SDRAM, SDRAM 
II, RDRAM, and SLDRAM (we will discuss some of these at the end of this chapter).
Computer Memory
As mentioned, you typically do not need to worry about RAM. (The only real excep-
tion would be NOVRAM that is used in many EEPROM-like applications.) RAM is 
usually either already integrated into a chip, such as a microcontroller, or is placed 
in reduced pin devices like single in-line memory modules (SIMMs) or dual in-line 
memory modules (DIMMs) that slide (snap) into a computer’s memory bank sockets. 
In both cases, not much thought is needed—assuming you are not trying to design 
a microcontroller or computer from scratch. The main concern nowadays is figuring 
out what kind of RAM module to buy for your computer.
Within computers, RAM is used to hold temporary instructions and data needed 
to complete tasks. This enables the computer’s CPU to access instructions and stored 
data in memory very quickly. For example, when the CPU loads an application, such 
as a word processor or page layout program, into memory, the CPU can quickly find 
what it needs, instead of needing to search for bits and pieces from, say, the hard drive 
or external drive. For RAM to be quick, it must be in direct communication with the 
computer’s CPU. Early on, memory was soldered directly onto the computer’s system 
board (motherboard). However, over time, as memory requirements increased, having 
fixed memory onboard became impractical. Today, computers house expansion slots 
arranged in memory banks. The number of memory banks and the specific configura-
tion vary, depending of the computer’s CPU and how the CPU receives information.
Historically, computers initially used either SIMM or DIMM memory modules. 
Both types of modules use dynamic RAM ICs as the core element. The actual SIMM or 
DIMM module resembles a PCB and houses a number of RAM ICs that are expanded 
onboard to provide the necessary bit width required by the CPU using the module. 
To install a SIMM or DIMM module, simply insert the module into one of the com-
puter memory banks sockets found on the motherboard. Many computer systems 
use 168-pin DIMMs. Older Pentium and later 486 PCs commonly use 72-pin SIMMs, 
while still older 486 PCs commonly use 30-pin SIMMs. 
A variation on standard sizes of DIMM memory is the SODIMM. SODIMM (Small 
Outline DIMM) are electrically the same as standard DIMMs but smaller in size and 
intended for use in laptop computers. 
DIMMs
DIMMs have opposing pins electrically isolated to form two separate contacts. 
DIMMs are often used in computer configurations that support a 64-bit or wider 
memory bus. 

Chapter 12: Digital Electronics    841
Each new generation of memory brings with it new formats of DIMM, with stra-
tegically placed slots to prevent accidental insertion of the wrong type of memory. 
DDR3 memory comes in 240-pin DIMMs. Figure 12.150 shows a somewhat sim-
pler sample package from an old 16 M × 64-bit synchronous DRAM that comes in a 
168-pin DIMM package.
FIGURE 12.150
DRAM Technology Used in Computer Memories
A number of DRAM technologies are incorporated into computer memory modules 
these days. Extended data out (EDO) memory is a technology that allows the CPU 
(ones that support EDO) to access memory 10 to 20 percent faster than standard 
DRAM chips. 
Another variation of DRAM is the synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), which uses a 
clock to synchronize signals input and output on a memory chip. The clock is coor-
dinated with the CPU clock so the timing of the memory chips and the timing of the 
CPU are in synch. Synchronous DRAMs save time in executing commands and trans-
mitting data, thereby increasing the overall performance of the computer. SDRAM 
allows the CPU to access memory approximately 25 percent faster than EDO memory. 
Double-data-rate SRAM (DDR or SDRAMM II) is a faster version of SDRAM that 
is able to read data on both the rising and falling edges of the system clock, thus dou-
bling the data rate of the memory chip. Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) is an extremely 
fast DRAM technology that uses a high-bandwidth “channel” to transmit data at 
speeds about ten times faster than a standard DRAM.


843
The microcontroller is essentially a computer on a chip. It contains a processing unit, 
ROM, RAM, serial communications ports, ADCs, and so on. In essence, a microcon-
troller is a computer, but without the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. These devices 
are called microcontrollers because they are small (micro) and because they control 
machines, gadgets, and so on. 
With one of these devices, you can build an “intelligent” machine. You write a 
program on a host computer; download the program into the microcontroller via the 
USB, parallel, or serial port of the PC; and then disconnect the programming cable 
and let the program run the machine. For example, in the microwave oven, a single 
microcontroller has all the essential ingredients to read from a keypad, write informa-
tion to the display, control the heating element, and store data such as cooking time.
There are literally thousands of different kinds of microcontrollers available. Some 
are one-time-programmable (OTP), meaning that once a program is written into its 
ROM (OTP-ROM), no changes can be made to the program. OTP microcontrollers are 
used in devices such as microwaves, dishwashers, automobile sensor systems, and 
many application-specific devices that do not require changing the core program. 
Other microcontrollers are reprogrammable, meaning that the microcontroller’s pro-
gram stored in ROM (which may be EPROM, EEPROM, or flash) can be changed if 
desired, which is a useful feature when prototyping or designing test instruments 
that may require future I/O devices.
Microcontrollers are found in bicycle light flashers, data loggers, toys such as 
model airplanes and cars, antilock braking systems, VCRs, microwave ovens, alarm 
systems, fuel injectors, exercise equipment, and many other items. They also can be 
used to construct robots, where the microcontroller acts as the robot’s brain, control-
ling and monitoring various input and output devices, such as light sensors, stepper 
and servo motors, temperature sensors, and speakers. With a bit of programming, 
you can make the robot avoid objects, sweep the floor, and generate various sounds 
to indicate that it has encountered difficulties (such as being low on power or tipped 
over) or has finished sweeping. The list of applications for microcontrollers is end-
less, and because they are so widely used, their cost is low.

CHAPTER 13

844    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
13.1  Basic Structure of a Microcontroller
Figure 13.1 shows the basic ingredients found within many microcontrollers. These 
include a CPU, ROM (OTP-ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, of flash), RAM, I/O ports, tim-
ing circuitry/leads, interrupt control, a serial port adapter (such as UART or USART), 
and an ADC/DAC.
The CPU retrieves program instructions that the user programs into ROM, while 
using RAM to store temporary data needed during program execution. The I/O 
ports are used to connect external devices that send or receive instructions to or from 
the CPU.
The serial port adapter is used to provide serial communications between the 
microcontroller and a PC or between two microcontrollers. It is responsible for con-
trolling the different rates of data flow common between devices. Example serial 
port adapters found within microcontrollers are the universal asynchronous receiver 
transmitter (UART) and universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver transmitter 
(USART). The UART can handle asynchronous serial communications, while the 
USART can handle either asynchronous or synchronous serial communications. 
Some microcontrollers take this a step further and include an interface for a Universal 
Serial Bus (USB) interface on the chip.
An interrupt system is used to interrupt a running program in order to process a 
special routine called the interrupt service routine. This boils down to the ability of a 
microcontroller to respond to external data that requires immediate attention, such as 
data conveyed by an external sensor indicating important shutdown information, say, 
when things get too hot or objects get too close. A timer/counter is used to “clock” 
the device—to provide the driving force needed to move bits around. Most microcon-
trollers that come with built-in ADCs and DACs can be used to interface with analog 
transducers, such as temperature sensors, strain gauges, and position sensors.
13.2  Example Microcontrollers
There are many different families of microcontrollers. Two of the most popular are 
made by the manufacturers Atmel and Microchip. In this section, we will take a close 
look at microcontrollers from these two manufacturers.

13.2.1  The ATtiny85 Microcontroller
The Atmel ATtiny85 microcontroller is an 8-pin IC available in both surface-mount 
and through-hole DIL packages. The device is designed to operate with a minimum 
of external components. Figure 13.2 shows what is inside one of these little packages.
The ATtiny 85 has three different types of memory:
• 8 kB of flash memory in which the program instructions are stored.
• 256 bytes of SRAM, which is used to contain data during execution of instructions.
• 512 bytes of EEPROM that is used to store nonvolatile data that needs to be 
retained after a loss of power.

The watchdog timer allows the microcontroller to be put into a sleep mode, in 
which it consumes negligible power. The watchdog timer will wake up the microcon-
troller after a certain amount of time has passed.
The device can either use the inaccurate internal oscillator or two of the pins that 
would otherwise be used for inputs or outputs can be sacrificed to use an external 
crystal oscillator.
Two timers can be used to generate internal interrupts; that is, to trigger some 
code to be executed periodically. External interrupts that are triggered by a change in 
the level at a pin are also possible.
All of the I/O pins can also be used with the internal ADC.
The ATtiny also has a Universal Serial Interface, which can communicate with 
a number of different types of serial buses including USB, Inter-Integrated Circuit 
(I2C), and serial. There is more about these serial protocols in Sec. 13.5.
Minimizing External Components
Figure 13.3 illustrates just how few components you need to make something with an 
ATtiny. The potentiometer is connected to a pin that will be used as an analog input, 
which could, for example, be used to control the rate at which the LED flashes.
The resistor R1 could be replaced by a direct connection from the RESET pin to 
VCC, but by using a resistor here, it becomes possible to have the RESET pin low 
force a reset—something that is necessary during programming. 
The chip will operate from a supply voltage of between 2.7 V and 5.5 V at a clock 
frequency of 10 MHz or below, making it suitable for running from a 3 V lithium cell 
or a pair of AA batteries. The clock frequency can be set during programming, and 
it can also be changed from program code while the ATtiny is actually running. The 
main reason for controlling the clock frequency is to reduce the power consumption. 
At 1 MHz, the power can be reduced to just 300 µA and in power-down mode, wait-
ing for an interrupt from the watchdog timer, power consumption is just 0.1 µA.
You may be wondering why we used a microcontroller to create something that 
we could have made with a 555 timer. Well, why not? The microcontroller is more 
expensive than a 555 timer, but only around a dollar, and also we can use slightly 
fewer components with a microcontroller. We also have a great deal more flexibility. 
Using this same hardware, we could do clever tricks such as turning the LED com-
pletely off if the potentiometer is at its most counterclockwise position. And there are 
three other unused I/O pins that we could do something with.

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    847
The catch is that to use a microcontroller, you need to program. But, if you are 
serious about developing something that will eventually become a product, chances 
are it will have a microcontroller in it.
Programming the ATtiny with AVR Studio
Atmel, the makers of the ATtiny, supply an integrated development environment 
(IDE) called AVR Studio (see Fig. 13.4) that takes away some of the pain of micropro-
cessor programming. 
The ATtiny is usually programmed in C, which offers a good compromise between 
performance and readability. We define readability as the property of a program that 
allows it to be understood by someone other than the person who wrote it. 
The standard AVR Studio way of doing things is powerful and flexible, but the 
C that you need to write is at a fairly low level, and not nearly as accessible as the 
BASIC Stamp language.
Programming the ATtiny with Arduino
Many people use the Arduino library to simplify the writing of code. This library 
includes all sorts of utility functions, rather like the commands found in the BASIC 
FIGURE 13.4
AVR Studio with a Blink program

848    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Stamp language. The Arduino library was developed from a project called Wiring, 
which is a useful library for AVR microcontrollers. It is used mostly with the Arduino 
development boards (see Sec. 13.4). However, the Arduino IDE (different from AVR 
Studio) can also be used to write the programs for most processors in the AVR 8-bit 
range, including the ATtiny85.
Figure 13.5 shows the program that would control the hardware of Fig. 13.4 within 
the Arduino IDE.
FIGURE 13.5
The Arduino IDE used with ATtiny
The Arduino IDE is open source and runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows systems. 
You need to install some extra configuration and library files to make the Arduino 
IDE work with the ATtiny microcontrollers. These instructions were developed at 
MIT. and details for installing and downloading can be found at http://hlt.media 
.mit.edu/?p=1695. 
The advantages of using an ATtiny microcontroller here rather than a full Arduino 
board are reduced cost (an ATtiny costs $1 or less) and lower power consumption. We 
will meet the Arduino in Sec. 13.4.
Whether you are programming the microcontroller with AVR Studio or Arduino, 
you will need USB programmer hardware that is connected to a USB port of your 
computer. The programmers use a technique called in-circuit system programming 
(ICSP), which uses a six pin header connected to pins on the ATtiny. This is one of the 
reasons that you use a resistor to tie up the RESET pin, as it is one of the pins used by 
the programmer. It is quite common to design this header into the PCB for the circuit, 
during development, allowing changes to be easily made to the firmware.

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    849
Other ATtiny Microcontrollers
If you find that you need more I/O pins, or you can make do with less memory and save 
cost, you may want to consider one of the other microcontrollers in the ATtiny range. 
The Atmel website contains comparison tables for all its microcontrollers at http://
www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/tinyAVR.aspx?tab=parameters.
13.2.2  The PIC16Cx Microcontrollers
Having briefly explored the ATtiny85 microcontroller, we turn our attention to some 
rival devices from Microchip. Like the ATtiny range, these microcontrollers are 8-bit.
Figure 13.6 shows Microchip’s PIC16Cx range of microcontrollers. As you can 
see in the internal architecture diagram, both microcontrollers house on-chip CPU, 
EPROM, RAM, and I/O circuitry. The architecture is based on a register file concept 
that uses separate buses and memories for programs and data (Harvard architecture). 
This allows execution to occur in parallel. As an instruction is being “pre-fetched,” 
the current instruction is executing on the data bus.
FIGURE 13.6
The PIC16C56’s program memory (EPROM) has space for 1024 words, while the 
PIC16C57 has space for 2048 words. An 8-bit-wide ALU contains one temporary 
working register, and performs arithmetic and Boolean functions between data held 
in the working register and any file register. The ALU and register file are composed 
of up to 80 addressable 8-bit registers, and the I/O ports are connected via the 

850    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
8-bit-wide data bus. Thirty-two bytes of RAM are directly addressable, while the 
access to the remaining bytes work through bank switching.
In order for bit movement to occur (clock generation), the PIC controllers require 
a crystal or ceramic resonator connected to pins OSC1 and OSC2. The PIC microcon-
trollers reach a performance of 5 million instructions per second (5 MIPS) at a clock 
frequency of 20 MHz. A watchdog timer is also included, which is a free-running 
on-chip RC oscillator that works without external components. It continues running 
when the clock has stopped, making it possible to generate a reset independent of 
whether the controller is working or sleeping.
These chips also come with a number of I/O pins that can be linked to external 
devices such as light sensors, speakers, LEDs, or other logic circuits. The PIC16C56 
comes with 12 I/O pins that are divided into three ports: port A (RA3–RA0), port B 
(RB7–RB0), and port C (RC7–RC0). The PIC16C57 comes with eight more I/O pins 
than the PIC16C56.
Programming the PIC Microcontroller
Microcontrollers use a set of machine-code instructions (1’s and 0’s) to perform vari-
ous tasks such as adding, comparing, sampling, and outputting data via I/O ports. 
These machine-code instructions are typically programmed into onboard ROM 
(EPROM, EEPROM, or flash) via a programming unit linked to a PC. The actual pro-
gramming, however, isn’t written out in machine code. It is written in a high-level 
language within an editor program running on the PC. The high-level language used 
may be a popular language such as C or a specially tailored language that the manu-
facturer has created to optimize all the features present within its microcontrollers. 
For ultimate performance, the user can revert to assembly language, which could also 
reduce memory usage and program size but at the expense of readability of the code.
Using a manual and software you get from the manufacturer, you learn to write 
statements that tell the microcontroller what to do. You type the statements in an 
editor program, and then use the compile/run option to check for syntax errors. 
Once you think the program is ready, you save it and run a compiler program to 
translate it into machine language. If there is an error in your program, the compiler 
may refuse to perform the conversion. In this case, you must return to the text editor 
and fix the bugs before moving on. 
Once the bugs are eliminated and the program is compiled successfully, a third 
piece of software is used to load the program into the microcontroller. This may 
require physically removing the microcontroller from the circuit and placing it into a 
special programmer unit linked to the host PC or may use ICSP, as described in the 
previous section.
Another way to do things involves using an interpreter instead of a compiler. An 
interpreter is a high-level language translator that resides within the microcontroller’s 
ROM, rather than in the host PC. This often means that an external ROM (EPROM, 
EEPROM, or flash) is needed to store the actual program. The interpreter receives the 
high-level language code from the PC and, on the spot, interprets the code and places 
the translated code (machine code) into the external ROM, where it can be used by 
the microcontroller. 
The interpreter approach may seem like a waste of memory, since the interpreter 
consumes valuable on-chip memory space. Also, using an interpreter significantly 

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    851
slows things down—a result of needing to retrieve program instructions from external 
memory. However, using an interpreter provides a very important advantage. By 
having the interpreter onboard to translate on the spot, an immediate, interactive 
relationship between the host program and microcontroller is created. This allows 
you to build your program, immediately try out small pieces of code, test the code by 
downloading the chunks into the microcontroller, and then see if the specific chunks 
of code work. The host programs used to create the source code often come with 
debugging features that let you test to see where possible programming or hard-
wiring errors may result by displaying the results (such as the logic state at a given 
I/O pin) on the computer screen while the program is executing within the micro-
controller. This allows you to perfect specific tasks within the program, such as a 
sound-generation routine, a stepper motor control routine, and so forth.
A halfway house between using interpreted code (BASIC Stamp, which we’ll look 
at next) and compiled machine code (AVR Studio) is to use a microcontroller with 
a boot loader installed into its EEPROM (Arduino). In this approach, a small boot 
loader program is installed once into the flash memory of the microcontroller. The 
boot loader then runs after every reset of the microcontroller and quickly checks for 
incoming programming commands on the serial port. If it finds them, it reads the 
serial data into the flash memory of the device so that it can then be run. This removes 
the need for special programming hardware.
Programming the PIC with BASIC Stamp
The BASIC Stamp is essentially a microcontroller with interpreter software built in. 
These devices also come with additional support circuitry, such as an EEPROM, volt-
age regulator, ceramic oscillator, and so on. BASIC Stamps are ideal for beginners 
because they are easy to program, quite powerful, and relatively cheap—a whole 
startup package costs around $80 or so. These devices are also very popular among 
inventors and hobbyists, and you’ll find a lot of helpful literature, application notes, 
and fully tested projects on the Internet.
The original Stamp was introduced in 1993 by Parallax, Inc. It got its name from 
the fact that it resembled a postage stamp. The early version of the BASIC Stamp 
was the REV D. Later improvements led to the BASIC Stamp I (BSI) and then BASIC 
Stamp II (BSII). 
Both the BSI and BSII have a specially tailored BASIC interpreter firmware built 
into the microcontroller’s EPROM. For both Stamps, a PIC microcontroller is used. 
The actual program that is to be run is stored in an onboard EEPROM. When the 
battery is connected, the Stamps run the BASIC program in memory. Stamps can be 
reprogrammed at any time by temporarily connecting them to a PC running a simple 
host program. The new program is typed in, a key is hit, and the program is loaded 
into the Stamp. I/O pins can be connected with other digital devices such as sense 
switches, LED displays, LCDs, servos, and stepper motors.
Here, we’ll focus on the BSII. To get started with the BSII, you will need program-
ming software, programming cable, the manual, the BASIC Stamp module, and an 
appropriate carrier board (optional). These all come in the BSII startup kit, at a lower 
cost than purchasing each part separately.

852    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Note: To fully understand all the finer details needed to program BASIC Stamps, it 
is necessary to read through the user’s manual. However, reading the user’s man-
ual alone tends not to be the best learning strategy, as it is easy to lose your place 
within all the technical terms, especially if you are a beginner. A good source to learn 
more about BASIC Stamps is the book Programming and Customizing the Basic Stamp 
Computer by Scott Edwards (McGraw-Hill, 2001). This book is geared toward begin-
ners and is easy reading.
BASIC STAMP II
BSII is a module that comes in a 24-pin DIL package (see Fig. 13.7). The brain of 
the BSII is the PIC16C57 microcontroller that is permanently programmed with a 
PBASIC2 instruction set within its internal one-time programmable EPROM (OTP-
EPROM). When programming the BSII, you tell the PIC16C57 to store symbols, 
called tokens, in external EEPROM memory. When the program runs, the PIC16C57 
retrieves tokens from memory, interprets them as PBASIC2 instructions, and carries 
out those instructions. The PIC16C57 can execute its internal program at a rate of 5 
MIPS. However, each PBASIC2 instruction takes up many machine instructions, so 
the PBASIC2 executes more slowly, around 3 to 4 MIPS.
The BSII comes with 16 I/O pins (P0–P15) that are available for general use by 
your programs. These pins can be interfaced with all modern 5-V logic, from TTL 
FIGURE 13.7

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    853
through CMOS (technically, they have characteristics like the 74HCT logic series). 
The direction of a pin—either input or output—is set during the programming phase. 
When a pin is set as an output pin, the BSII can send signals to other devices, like 
LEDs and servos. When a pin is set as an input pin, it can receive signals from exter-
nal devices, such as switches and photosensors. Each I/O pin can source 20 mA and 
sink 25 mA. Pins P0–P7 and pins P8–P15, as groups, can each source a total of 40 and 
sink 50 mA per group.
2048-BYTE EEPROM
The BSII’s PIC’s internal OTP-EPROM is permanently programmed at the factory 
with Parallax’s firmware, which turns this memory into a PBASIC2 interpreter chip. 
Because they are interpreters, the Stamp PICs have the entire PBASIC language per-
manently programmed into their internal program memory. This memory cannot be 
used to store your PBASIC2 program. Instead, the main program must be stored in 
the EEPROM, which retains data without power and can be reprogrammed easily. 
At runtime, the PBASIC2 program created on the host computer is loaded into the 
BSII’s EEPROM starting at the highest address (2047) and working downward. Most 
programs do not use the entire EEPROM, which means that PBASIC2 lets you store 
data in the unused lower portion of the EEPROM. Since programs are stored from the 
top of the memory downward, data is stored in the bottom of the memory working 
upward. If there is an overlap, the Stamp host software will detect this problem and 
display an error message.
RESET CIRCUIT
The BSII comes with a reset circuit. When power is first connected to the Stamp, 
or if it falters due to a weak battery, the power supply voltage can fall below the 
required 5 V. During such brownouts, the PIC is in a voltage-deprived state and will 
have the tendency to behave erratically. For this reason, a reset chip is incorporated 
into the design, forcing the PIC to reset to the beginning of the program and hold 
until the supply voltage is within acceptable limits.
POWER SUPPLY
To avoid supplying the BSII with unregulated supply power, a 5-V regulator is incor-
porated into the BSII. This regulator accepts a voltage range from slightly over 5 V up 
to 15 V and regulates it to a steady 5 V. It provides up to 50 mA. The regulated 5 V is 
available at output VDD, where it can be used to power other parts of your circuits, as 
long as no more than 50 mA is required.
CONNECTING BSII TO A HOST PC
To program a Stamp requires connecting it to a PC that runs host software to allow 
you to write, edit, download, and debug PBASIC2 programs. The PC communicates 
with the BSII through an RS-232 (COM port) interface consisting of pins SIN, SOUT, and 
ATM (serial in, serial out, and attention, respectively). 
During programming, the BSII host program pulses ATM high to reset the PIC and 
then transmits a signal to the PIC through SIN indicating that it wants to download 
a new program. PC-to-BSII connector hookup is shown in Fig. 13.7. This connection 
allows the PC to reset the BSII for programming, download programs, and receive 

854    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
debug data from the BSII. The additional pair of connections, pin 6 and 7 of the DB9 
socket, lets the BSII host software identify the port to which the BSII is connected. 
Usually, when programming a BSII, you use a special BSII carrier board, which 
comes with a prototyping area, I/O header, BSII-IC socket, 9-V battery clips, and an 
RS-232 serial port connector, as shown in Fig. 13.7. These boards, along with pro-
gramming cable and software, can be purchased as startup packages.
THE PBASIC LANGUAGE
Even though the BASIC Stamp has BASIC in its name, it cannot be programmed in 
Visual BASIC. It does not have a graphical user interface, a hard drive, or a lot of 
RAM. The BASIC Stamp must be programmed only with Parallel’s BASIC, PBASIC, 
which has been specifically designed to exploit all the BASIC Stamp’s capabilities. 
PBASIC is a hybrid form of the BASIC programming language, with which many 
people are familiar. PBASIC is called a hybrid because, while it contains some simplified 
forms of normal BASIC control constructs, it also has special commands to efficiently 
control I/O pins. PBASIC is an easy language to master and includes familiar instruc-
tions such as GOTO, FOR . . . NEXT, and IF . . . THEN. It also contains Stamp-specific 
instructions, such as PULSOUT, DEBUG, and BUTTON, which will be discussed shortly.
The actual program to be downloaded into the Stamp is first written using BSII 
editor software running on a Microsoft Windows PC, or on a Linux or Mac system 
running Windows using virtualization software. After you write the code for your 
application, you simply connect the Stamp to a serial port or USB-to-serial adapter 
connected to your computer, provide power to the Stamp, and download the code 
into the Stamp. As soon as the program has been downloaded successfully, it begins 
executing its new program from the first line of code.
The size of the program that can be stored in a Stamp is limited. For the BSII, 
2048 bytes worth of program space are available, which is enough for around 500 to 
600 lines of PBASIC code. The amount of program memory for the Stamps cannot be 
expanded, since the interpreter chip (PIC) expects the memory to be specific and fixed 
in size. However, in terms of data memory, expansion is possible. You can interface 
EEPROM or other memory devices to the Stamp’s I/O pins to gain more data storage 
area. This requires that you supply the appropriate code within your PBASIC program 
to make communication between the Stamp and external memory device you choose 
possible. Additional data memory is often available with Stamp-powered applica-
tions that monitor and record data (such as from an environmental field instrument).
The PBASIC language, like other high-level computer languages, involves defin-
ing variables and constants and using address labels, mathematical and binary oper-
ators, and various instructions (including branching, looping, numerics, digital I/O, 
serial I/O, analog I/O, sound I/O, EEPROM access, time, power control, and so on). 
Here’s a quick rundown of the elements of the PBASIC2 language.
Comments: Comments can be added within the program to describe what you’re 
doing. They begin with an apostrophe (’) and continue to the end of the line.
Variables: These are locations in memory that your program can use to store and 
recall values. These variables have limited range. Before a variable can be used 
in a PBASIC2 program, it must be declared. The common way used to declare 
variables is to use a directive VAR:
symbolvar  size

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    855
where the symbol can be any name that starts with a letter; can contain a mixture of 
letters, numbers, and underscore; and must not be the same as PBASIC keywords 
or labels used in the program. The size establishes the number of bits of storage 
the variable is to contain. PBASIC2 provides four sizes: bit (1 bit), nib (4 bits), byte 
(8 bits), and word (16 bits). Here are some examples of variable declarations:
'Declare variables. 
sense_invar bit     'Value can be 0 or 1. 
speedvar nib    'Value in range 0 to 15. 
lengthvar byte    'Value in range 0 to 255. 
nvar word   'Value in range 0 to 65535.
Constants: Constants are unchanging values that are assigned at the beginning of 
the program and may be used in place of the numbers they represent within the 
program. Defining constants can be accomplished by using the CON directive:
beeps         con  5        'number of beeps
By default, PBASIC2 assumes that numbers are in decimal (base 10). However, it is 
possible to use binary and hexadecimal numbers by defining them with prefixes. 
For example, when the prefix % is placed in front of a binary number (for example, 
%0111 0111), the number is treated as a binary number, not a decimal number. 
To define a hexadecimal number, the prefix $ is used (as in $EF). Also, PBASIC2 
will automatically convert quoted text into the corresponding ASCII codes. For 
example, defining a constant as A will be interpreted as the ASCII code for A (65).
Address labels: The editor uses address labels to refer to addresses (locations) within 
the program. This is different from other versions of BASIC, which use line num-
bers. In general, an address label name can be any combination of letters, num-
bers, and underscores. However, the first character in the label name cannot be 
a number, and the label name must not be the same as a reserved word, such as 
a PBASIC instruction or variable. The program can be told to go to the address 
label and follow whatever instructions are listed after. Address labels are indi-
cated with a terminating colon (for example, loop:).
Mathematical operators: PBASIC2 uses two types of operators: unary and binary. 
Unary operators take precedence over binary operators. Also, unary operations 
are always performed first. For example, in the expression 10 – SQR 16, the BSII 
first takes the square root of 16 and then subtracts it from 10. The unary operators 
are as follows:
 
ABS 
Returns absolute value
 
SQR 
Returns square root of value
 
DCD 
2n-power decoder
 
NCD 
Priority encoder of a 16-bit value
 
SIN 
Returns 2’s complement sine
 
COS 
Returns 2’s complement cosine
The binary operators are as follows:
 
+ 
Addition
 
−

Table 13.1 shows the PBASIC instructions used by BSII.
DEBUGGING
To debug PBASIC programs, the BASIC Stamp editor comes with two handy fea-
tures: syntax checking and a DEBUG command. 
Syntax checking alerts you to any syntactical error and is automatically per-
formed on your code the moment you try to download to the BASIC Stamp. Any 
syntax errors will cause the download process to abort and will cause the editor to 
display an error message, pointing out the error in the source code. 
The DEBUG command, unlike syntax checking, is an instruction that is written 
into the program to find logical errors—ones that the Stamp does not find, but ones 
that the designer had not intended. DEBUG operates similar to the PRINT command 
in the BASIC language and can be used to print the current status of specific vari-
ables within your PBASIC program as it is executed within the BASIC Stamp. If your 
PBASIC code includes a DEBUG command, the editor opens a special window at the 
end of the download process to display the result for you.
Making a Robot Using BSII
To demonstrate how easy it is to make interesting gadgets using BSII, let’s take a look 
at a robot application. In this application, the main objective is to prevent the robot 
from running into objects. The robot aimlessly moves around, and when it comes 
close to an object, the robot stops and then backs up and moves off in another direc-
tion. In this example, the robot is constructed as follows:
• A BSII acts as the robot’s brain.
• Two servos connected to wheels act as its legs.
• A pair of infrared transmitters and sensors acts as its eyes.
• A piezoelectric speaker acts as its voice.

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    859
Figure 13.8 shows the completed robot, along with the various individual 
components.
THE SERVOS
The directional movement of the robot is controlled by right and left servo motors that 
have been modified so as to provide a full 360 degrees worth of rotation (modifying a 
servo is discussed in Chap. 15). To control a servo requires generating pulses ranging 
from 1000 to 2000 µs in width at intervals of approximately 20 ms. With one of the ser-
vos used in our example, when the pulse width sent to the servo’s control line is set to 
1500 µs, the servo is centered—it doesn’t move. However, if the pulse width is short-
ened to, say, 1300 µs, the modified servo rotates clockwise. Conversely, if the pulse 
width is lengthened to, say, 1700 µs, the modified servo rotates counterclockwise.
The actual control pulses used to drive one of the servos in the robot are generated by 
the BSII using the PULSOUT pin, time1 and the PAUSE time2 instructions. The pin repre-
sents the specific BSII pin that is linked to a servo’s control line, and time1 represents how 
long the pin will be pulsed high. Note that for the PULSOUT instruction, the decimal 
placed in the time1 slot actually represents half the time, in microseconds (s), that the pin is 
pulsed high. For example, PULSOUT 1, 1000 means that the BSII will pulse pin 1 high for 
2000 µs, or 2 ms. For the PAUSE instruction, the decimal placed in the time2 slot represents 
a pause in milliseconds. For example, PAUSE 20, represents a 20-ms pause. Figure 13.9 
shows sample BSII code used to generate desired output waveforms to control a servo.

pause 20           'pause for 20 ms
The pulse widths need to be repeated for them to have a practical effect on the 
motors. It may be worth expanding this fragment to show loops of a second or more 
for each of the pulse widths.
Note that this sequence of pulses must be repeated every 20 ms or so for the servo 
to maintain its position.
IR TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS
The robot’s object-detection system consists of a right and left set of infrared (IR) LED 
transmitters and IR detector modules. The IR LEDs are flashed via a 555 timer at a high 
frequency, which in this example happens to be 38 kHz, 50 percent duty cycle. This fre-
quency is used to avoid interference from other household sources of IR light, primar-
ily incandescent lights, and to match the IR sensor shown in the figure. (Many types of 
IR LED transmitters and sensors could be used in this robot, and they may work best 
using a different frequency.) It is also possible to generate these pulses using the BASIC 
Stamp, but we have chosen to use external hardware to keep the program simple. 
The IR photons emitted by the LED rebound off objects in the path of the robot 
and reflect back to the IR detector module. When a detector module receives photons, 
the I/O pin of the BSII connected to the module goes low. Note that the BSII can exe-
cute only around 4000 instructions per second, while the number of pulses generated 
by the detector module is 38,000. In this case, the actual number of pulses received by 
the BSII will be less—around 10 or 20.
PIEZOELECTRIC SPEAKER
A piezoelectric speaker is linked to one of the BSII I/O terminals and is used to gener-
ate different sounds when the robot is moving forward or backing up. To provide the 
piezoelectric speaker with a sinusoidal waveform to generate sound, the FREQOUT 
pin, time, frequency instruction is used. The instruction FREQOUT 7, 1000, 440 creates 
a 440-Hz sinusoidal frequency on pin 7 that lasts for 1000 ms.
THE PROGRAM
The following is a program used to control the robot. It is first created using the 
PBASIC2 host software, and then downloaded into the BSII during runtime.

Note: Due to production tolerances, the motors may not stop rotating when pulsing 
at 1500 µs, so a small “fudge factor” may need to be added to or subtracted from the 
PULSOUT values.
Thinking about Mass Production
Recall that the major components of the BASIC Stamp circuit are the PIC (houses the 
CPU and ROM for storing PBASIC interpreter), external EEPROM (stores the pro-
gram), and the resonator. In large-scale runs, it would be nice to get rid of the exter-
nal memory and remove the interpreter program, and simply download a compiled 
PBASIC code directly into the PIC. This would save space and money. As it turns out, 
the BASIC Stamp editor software includes a feature to program PBASIC code directly 
into a PIC microcontroller using Parallax’s PIC16Cxx programmer. 
The major benefit of starting out with the Stamp is that you can easily fine-tune 
your code, test chunks, and immediately see if it works, which is important when cre-
ating prototypes. When prototyping with a PIC, checking for errors is much harder 
because you must compile everything at once—you can’t test out chunks of code.
13.2.3  32-Bit Microcontrollers
The microcontrollers that we have explored in the previous sections use an 8-bit 
data bus with a clock frequency in the tens of megahertz and a few kilobytes of 
storage. Anyone familiar with the microprocessor-based home computers of the 1980s 
and 1990s would recognize the specifications. In comparison to a modern smart-
phone with a 32-bit processor, clock frequencies in the gigahertz, and hundreds of 
megabytes of RAM, these microcontrollers offer lamentable performance. However, 
the important thing here is what they are being used for. The adage of “not using a 
sledgehammer to crack a nut” was never more appropriate.
Atmel, Microchip, and most of the other microcontroller manufacturers all pro-
duce high-performance microcontrollers that use a 32-bit data bus and have more 
memory and processing performance than most desktop computers had ten years 
ago. These are useful for some high-performance applications. If you find that you 
need this kind of performance, then it is worth considering using one from a manu-
facturer whose 8-bit devices you are already familiar with, as they generally use the 
same or similar software tools and can be programmed in much the same way. They 
just cost a lot more and work a lot faster.
13.2.4  Digital Signal Processing
If you have a microcontroller that has an ADC input and a DAC output, you can digitize 
an audio signal (let’s say music), process the data in some way, and then send it back out 
through the DAC. You might create a graphics equalizer or a dynamic voice changer that 
raises the pitch of your voice by an octave. This is called digital signal processing (DSP).

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    863
While you can do simple low-quality DSP with a standard 8-bit microcontroller, the 
ADCs are often too slow and the algorithms such as Fourier transforms that you apply 
to the audio signal must work in real time, and therefore benefit greatly from a fast CPU.
Microchip (among others) has variants of its standard microcontroller lines spe-
cifically designed for DSP. The dsPIC from Microchip is one such device that is fre-
quently used in low-cost DSP applications. It has a 16-bit internal data bus, a 40 MHz 
clock, and 2kB of RAM.
Note: DSP is a complex area, and there are many good books devoted to this topic. 
Understanding Digital Signal Processing by Richard G. Lyons (Pearson, 1996) is one 
such book.
13.3  Evaluation/Development Boards
The microcontroller manufacturers are very keen to get their products into your 
products, so most will offer low-cost development and evaluation boards for their 
microcontrollers. These will often take the form of a PCB that contains the micro-
controller, supporting components such as a crystal oscillator and voltage regulator, and 
a prototyping area where you can add your own components. They can also usually be 
programmed from a USB or sometimes RS-232 serial port, for which you will need to 
find an ancient PC, or more likely, use a USB-to-serial convertor. These boards include 
the use of the manufacturers’ preferred software development tools, although these are 
sometime limited in some way unless you buy the professional version of the software.
As well as boards produced by the microcontroller manufacturers, other boards 
are offered by third parties. These boards can be useful during the development pro-
cess, as they make prototyping much easier than starting from scratch.
Table 13.2 lists some of the most popular development boards available at the 
time of writing.

13.4  Arduino
Arduino is an open source hardware platform for microcontroller prototyping. It 
encompasses both a microcontroller development board and an IDE. The IDE is sim-
ple to use and available for Mac, Linux, and Windows computers.
Arduino boards are extremely popular as a starting point for using microcon-
troller technologies. Their popularity is due to a number of factors, including the 
following:
• Low cost (around $30)
• Open source design
• Easy-to-use and cross-platform IDE
• Availability of plug-in shields (expansion hardware)
13.4.1  A Tour of Arduino
The most popular Arduino board is the Arduino Uno (see Fig. 13.10). This board is 
based on an Atmel microcontroller, similar to the ATtiny called ATmega328 (although 
the ATtiny can also be programmed using the Arduino IDE). 
The ATmega328 microcontroller has 32kB of flash memory for storing programs, 
2kB of RAM, and 1kB of EEPROM. It also has a hardware serial interface, or UART, 
as well as the usual timers and interrupt capabilities.
The microcontroller itself is the large 28-pin IC in the bottom right of the board, as 
shown in Fig. 13.10. Beneath this are six analog pins that can also be used as digital 
I/O pins, and then a block of power connections.
The Arduino can either be powered through the DC input socket (7–12 V dc) or 
from USB, and will switch over automatically to whichever is supplied.
FIGURE 13.10
An Arduino Uno board

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    865
The connectors on the top side of the board offer an I2C interface, which actually 
uses two of the analog pins (A4 and A5) in the Arduino Uno, but they are repeated 
here for future boards that may have a separate I2C interface. There is also a row of 
digital I/O pins, some marked as being pulse-width modulation (PWM) capable. 
Two of these, D0 and D1, double as the Rx and Tx pins on the UART.
13.4.2  The Arduino IDE
The Arduino IDE provides a simple-to-use editor into which you can type your pro-
grams and upload them onto your Arduino board over USB (see Fig. 13.11). As well 
as the program editing area, the Arduino IDE also provides the following features:
• Color syntax highlighting
• A status area where the memory usage of your completed program is shown
• Links to the Arduino library documentation
• A serial monitor that allows two-way communication with the Arduino’s USB port
FIGURE 13.11
The Arduino IDE
Most of the Arduino boards, including the Arduino Uno, have a USB connector 
through which they can be programmed. So, after writing your program, or “sketch” 
as it is called in Arduino parlance, you select the type of board and click the Upload 
button. Your program will be compiled and loaded into the flash memory of the 
microcontroller.
13.4.3  Arduino Board Models
Along with the Arduino Uno, there are many other Arduino boards to suit different 
uses. They are all programmed in the same way, but have different sizes, costs, and 
numbers of I/O pins available.

866    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
New Arduino models are released quite often. As an open source project, different 
manufacturers frequently take a basic model and add some different features to it.
Some of the most used official Arduino models are listed in Table 13.3.
Along with the boards listed in Table 13.3, other manufacturers offer boards that 
simply replicate the features of the official designs with minor differences. More inter-
esting are the special-purpose Arduino boards. Some of these are listed in Table 13.4.
13.4.4  Shields
The success of Arduino had been in no small part due to the wide range of plug-in 
shields that add useful features to a basic Arduino board. A shield is designed to

fit into the header sockets of the main Arduino board (see Fig. 13.12). Most shields 
will then pass through these connections in another row of header sockets, mak-
ing it possible to construct stacks of shields with an Arduino at the bottom. Shields 
that have a display on them will not normally pass through in this way. You also 
need to be aware that if you stack shields in this way, you need to make sure that 
there are no incompatibilities, such as two of the shields using the same pin. Some 
shields get around this problem by providing jumpers to add some flexibility to pin 
assignments.
There are shields available for almost anything you could want an Arduino to do. 
They range from relay control to LED displays and audio file players. Most of these 
are designed with the Arduino Uno in mind, but are also usually compatible with the 
Arduino Mega.

13.4.5  The Arduino C Library
You may hear people refer to the “Arduino language,” but Arduino is actually just 
programmed in the C programming language, which has been around for many 
years. But Arduino provides a set of Arduino core functions that you can use in your 
programs, or sketches. 
There are a large number of commands available in the Arduino library. A selec-
tion of the most commonly used commands are listed in Table 13.6.
The main Arduino core, including all the commands listed in Table 13.6, is auto-
matically included in every sketch that you write. However, there are a number of 
other libraries that come bundled with the Arduino IDE that are added to your code 
only when you use them. To include them, use the include command followed by the 
name of the library, like this:
#include <Servo.h>
This command includes the Servo library that we will use in the example Arduino 
project that follows.
TABLE 13.6  Arduino Library Functions 
COMMAND
EXAMPLE
DESCRIPTION
Digital I/O
pinMode
pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
Sets pin 8 to be an output. The alternative is to set it to 
INPUT. 
digitalWrite
digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
Sets pin 8 high. To set it low, use the constant LOW 
instead of HIGH.
digitalRead
inti;
i = digitalRead(8);
Sets the value of i to HIGH or LOW depending on the 
voltage at the pin specified (in this case, pin 8).
pulseIn
i = pulseIn(8, HIGH)
Returns the duration in microseconds of the next HIGH 
pulse on pin 8.
tone
tone(8, 440, 1000);   
Makes pin 8 oscillate at 440 Hz for 1000 ms.

DESCRIPTION
Digital I/O
noTone
noTone();
Cuts short the playing of any tone that was in progress.
Analog I/O
analogRead
int r;
r = analogRead(0);
Assigns a value to r of between 0 and 1023. 0 for  
0 V 1023 if pin 0 is 5 V (3.3 V for a 3 V board).
analogWrite
analogWrite(9, 127);
Outputs a PWM signal (see Sec. 13.5). The duty cycle is 
a number between 0 and 255, 255 being 100%.
This must be used by one of the pins marked as PWM 
on the Arduino board (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11).
Time Commands
millis
unsigned long l;
l = millis();
The variable type long in Arduino is represented in  
32 bits. The value returned by millis() will be the number 
of milliseconds since the last reset. The number will wrap 
around after approximately 50 days.
micros
long l;
l = micros();
Like millis, except this is microseconds since the last 
reset. It will wrap after approximately 70 minutes.
delay
delay(1000);
Delay for 1000 ms, or 1 second.
delayMicroseconds
delayMicroseconds(100000);
Delay for 100,000 microseconds.
Note the minimum delay is 3 microseconds; the  
maximum is around 16 ms.
Interrupts
attachInterrupt
attachInterrupt(1, myFunction, 
RISING);
Associates the function myFunction with a rising  
transition on interrupt 1 (D3 on an Uno).
detachInterrupt
detachInterrupt(1);
Disables any interrupt on interrupt 1.
The libraries that are included in the Arduino IDE are listed in Table 13.7.
As well as the official Arduino libraries, as an open system, anyone can write a 
library and contribute it to the community, and many of these are extremely useful. 
Some of these other libraries are listed in Table 13.8.

There are many obvious similarities with the BASIC Stamp version. However, 
the C language used by Arduino provides a little more structure to the program, and 
seasoned programmers will probably feel happier using C rather than BASIC.
As noted in the previous section, a feature of the Arduino platform is the large 
number of libraries, both official and user-supplied, that can be included in the pro-
gram. The first line includes a library for controlling servos. Strictly speaking, this is 
C++, the object-oriented extension to C. So, to control a servo, we first need to create 
an instance (well, two in this case):
Servo leftServo; 
Servo rightServo;
Then we need to associate it with a particular pin using the following:
leftServo.attach(leftServoPin); 
rightServo.attach(rightServoPin);
From now on, all we need to do is give the servo an angle in degrees, using the 
write command, like this:
leftServo.write(180 - speed);
There is no need to worry about pulse lengths; all this is handled for us 
automatically.
13.4.7  Taking the Arduino Offboard
For all its convenience and ease of use, an Arduino Uno is just a microcontroller with 
the necessary support components to provide it with a regulated voltage and allow it 
to be programmed over USB. When the time comes to create a product, if it is a one-
off, you will probably just use the Arduino as it is, and buy yourself a replacement 
for the next project. If however, you will be producing a number of devices, you will 
probably want to lose the Arduino board and just use the programmed microcon-
troller in your project. 
Taking the Arduino offboard means that you will probably design your own PCB 
for the microcontroller that includes just those features of the Uno that you need in 
your project, along with those extra components that may have been provided by a 
shield or connections to other electronics on, say, a breadboard.
The ATmega328 is not as easy to run using an internal oscillator as the ATtiny. 
The IDE expects an external clock (crystal or ceramic resonator). You will prob-
ably also want to use a voltage regulator IC to provide a stable voltage to the 
microcontroller.
The schematic shown in Fig. 13.13 was produced in Eagle CAD, along with the 
corresponding board shown in Fig. 13.14.

Connecting switches to a digital input
13.5  Interfacing with Microcontrollers
Whether you are using an ATtiny, a PIC, or an Arduino, you can be fairly certain that 
you will need to connect some components to it. At the very least, there will probably 
be a switch or two.
You can use three types of interfaces to your microcontroller:
• Digital: Switches as inputs, LEDs or similar as outputs
• Analog: Sensors of various types (see Chap. 6) 
• Serial: A serial communications protocol of which there are four main types: TTL 
serial, I2C, 1-Wire, and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).
In the following sections, we will assume that your microcontroller has both ana-
log and digital inputs, as well as digital and PWM outputs. It is also assumed that the 
microcontroller is operating at 5V. This may not always be the case, as many micro-
controllers can be used at lower voltages, and 3.3 V is another common choice. If this 
is the case, you will need to adapt some of the schematics.
13.5.1  Switches
Single Switches
Switches are easy to connect to a digital input (see Fig. 13.15). Note the use of pullup 
resistors that keep the pin high until it is closed. When the switch is of the normally 
closed variety, then that current will be drawn continually, so you may want to use a 
high value of resistor there—say, 10 kΩ. However, for a normally open switch, cur-
rent will flow only when the switch is pressed, so 1 kΩ is fine.
With the switch to GND, as shown in all the examples in Fig. 13.15, when the 
switch is closed, the digital input will go low. This means that the logic of a button 
being pressed is inverted, as shown in the following sample Arduino C code. 
if (digitalRead(4) == LOW) 
{ 
  // the key was pressed, do something 
}

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    875
It is also possible to swap over the switch and resistor, so that the resistor is 
now a pulldown resistor, and the switch being closed will result in a logical HIGH 
at the input.
The choice of pullup resistor depends on how electrically noisy your environment 
is and how long the leads are from the microcontroller to the switch. Essentially, it is 
a compromise between immunity to noise and current consumption. Given that for a 
normally open switch, current will flow only when the button is pressed, 5 mA using 
a 1 kΩ resistor is not normally a problem. In fact, some would advocate a lower value, 
such as 270 Ω.
Many microcontrollers include internal pullup resistors that can be turned on 
and off for a particular digital input. On an ATmega and ATtiny microcontroller, this 
resistor typically has a value of 20 k to 40 kΩ, so in a noisy environment or if the lead 
to the switch is long, an external pullup resistor may be better.
Multiple Switches to One Analog Input
If you have a lot of switches and do not want to tie up a load of digital inputs, then a 
common technique is to use an analog input and a number of resistors. The voltage 
at the analog input will then depend on the switches that are pressed (see Fig. 13.16).
Figure 13.16 is taken from the schematic diagram for the Freetronics Arduino LCD 
shield, where it is used for the five switches of a joystick type arrangement of push 
buttons (thanks to Freetronics for permission to use this diagram). Note how the 
decimal values for 10-bit A to D for each button are given as a table.

876    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
The analog reading will not normally be exactly the value required due to resistor tol-
erances and power supply voltage changes, so in the code that interprets this, you would 
normally specify a band that would indicate a certain button, rather than just one value.
Using a Matrix Keypad
Keypads use switches arranged in a matrix, as shown in Fig. 13.17. The 4 × 3 keypad 
shown in the figure has a key at the intersection of each row and column. To deter-
mine which keys are pressed, the microcontroller will take each of the output pins 
Q0 to Q2 high in turn, and see what value is presented at each of the inputs I0 to I3. 
Note that if the microprocessor does not support internal pullup resistors, then these 
pullup resistors would be required on each input.

In practice, this is such a common component for microcontrollers that to write 
your own code for it would be needlessly reinventing the wheel. As an example, the 
following is the Arduino code for this that uses a library.
#include <Keypad.h> 
 
char keys[4][3] = { 
  {'1','2','3'}, 
  {'4','5','6'}, 
  {'7','8','9'}, 
  {'*','0','#'} 
}; 
 
byte rowPins[4] = {2, 7, 6, 4};  
byte colPins[3] = {3, 8, 5};  
 
Keypad keypad = Keypad(makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, 4, 3); 
 

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    877
void setup() 
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
 
void loop() 
{ 
  char key = keypad.getKey(); 
  if (key != null) 
  { 
    Serial.println(key); 
  } 
}
This example code will send any key that is pressed out through the Arduino 
serial monitor.
Debouncing
Attach an oscilloscope to the output of any of the circuits in Fig. 13.15, and you are 
likely to see an output something like what is shown in Fig. 13.18 when the switch is 
closed. This is called bouncing.
Switch bouncing can cause problems. Imagine the situation where pressing a button 
toggles an LED on and off. If there are an even number of bounces, then the LED will 
toggle on and then immediately off again, giving the impression that nothing happened.
It is therefore a good idea to debounce any switches that are connected to a micro-
controller input. Although it is perfectly possible to do this with hardware—say, with 
a monostable that ignores subsequent pulses from the switch after triggering—it 
reduces the component count if you do the debouncing in software. 
FIGURE 13.18
Switch bouncing

878    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
As with keyboard matrices, debouncing is a common problem that has been solved 
many times. The essence of software debouncing is the same as hardware debounc-
ing, and that is to take action on the first transition and then ignore any subsequent 
transitions of the output until a safe debounce period has elapsed. Depending on 
what else the microcontroller has to do, this can be as simple as inserting a delay for 
the debounce period in the code that immediately follows the detection of the first 
transition. However, sometimes this is not possible, such as when the microcontroller 
has other responsibilities (like refreshing an LED display). In these cases, a common 
approach is to set a variable to the milliseconds tick after the first transition and make 
a condition of actioning the button press that sufficient debounce time has elapsed. 
The Arduino code for this is as follows.
constintdebouncePeriod = 100; 
long lastKeyPressTime = 0; 
 
void loop() 
{ 
  long timeNow = millis(); 
  if (digitalRead(5) == LOW &&lastKeyPressTime>timeNow + debouncePeriod) 
  { 
    // button pressed and enough time elapsed since last press 
    // do what you need to do 
    lastKeyPressTime = timeNow; 
  } 
}
13.5.2  Analog Inputs
Many of the sensors described in Chap. 6 provide an analog output to indicate the 
property that they are reading. For example, the TMP36 temperature sensor IC would 
typically be connected directly to an analog input of a microcontroller, as shown in 
Fig. 13.19.
If you are measuring a voltage that is outside the range of the microcontroller’s 
analog input (say 0 to 10 V), then you can just use two resistors as a voltage divider 
to reduce the voltage appropriately. If there is a risk that the voltage may exceed the 
FIGURE 13.19

Micro
Reading the voltage from a TMP36 sensor

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    879
expected range, you can protect the microcontroller’s analog input by adding a zener 
diode (see Fig. 13.20).
In practice, the zener diode will start to conduct before 5.1 V, to the detriment 
of the linearity of the readings, which is why the input range is labeled as 0 to 50 V, 
rather than 0 to 55 V. Remember the voltage divider is 1:11, not 1:10.
If switching behavior is required, then this should be implemented in code rather 
than through hardware. This approach allows more flexibility, for instance, for add-
ing hysteresis or changing the set temperature. The following Arduino C code illus-
trates a simple temperature-control algorithm with 4 (±2) degrees of hysteresis.
const float hysteresis = 2.0; 
const float setPoint = 20.0; 
float temp = readTemperature(); 
if (temp <setPoint - hysteresis) 
{ 
  digitalWrite(heaterControlPin, HIGH); 
  } 
else if (temp >setPoint + hysteresis) 
{ 
  digitalWrite(heaterControlPin, LOW); 
}
This example assumes that there is a user-supplied function called read 
Temperature.
For measuring resistance, sensors that are resistive, like LDRs and thermistors, 
will usually simply be used as one leg of a potential divider to produce a voltage that 
can be read. This is discussed in the relevant sensor sections in Chap. 6.
13.5.3  High-Power Digital Outputs
Most microcontrollers will reliably provide us with only around 20 mA of source or 
sink current as a direct digital output. If you want to drive a higher power load, such 
as a relay or a high-power LED, then you need to use a transistor.
Note that Arduino will handle up to 40 mA per pin with a maximum per chip of 
200 mA. These figures should be derated by 25 percent for a production product,

880    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
but Atmel says that the chip can comfortably cope with the absolute maximum 
current ratings, as these figures are already derated.
Figure 13.21 shows how to accomplish this with bipolar transistors, and Fig. 13.22 
shows how to use MOSFETs. 
MOSFETs have a number of advantages over bipolar transistors. One is that for 
most applications, they do not need a gate resistor. However, MOSFETs are a capaci-
tative load, so the inrush current when the pin changes state can be very high, albeit 
for a very short duration. Microcontrollers will generally cope with this, but for ulti-
mate adherence to design rules, use a gate resistor of around 1 kΩ.
Another advantage of using MOSFETs as switches is their exceptionally low 
drain-source on resistance and high off resistance. This makes a small MOSFET 
FIGURE 13.21
Handling high-power outputs with bipolar transistors
FIGURE 13.22
Handling high-power outputs with MOSFETs

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    881
capable of controlling quite big loads. However, you should check the gate threshold 
voltage to make sure that it is not above the logic level. For instance, an N-channel 
MOSFET with a gate threshold voltage of 6 V is not going to turn on when the gate 
goes to just 5 V. This is more of a problem with high-power MOSFETs. When using 
high-power MOSFETs, look for those described as “logic-level” MOSFETs, meaning 
that they have a gate threshold significantly less than 5 V.
Relays and Other Inductive Loads
With the exception of some reed relays, very few relays will switch with a current 
less than 50 mA, and therefore you will nearly always need to use a transistor as just 
described. You also need to remember to use a reverse-biased diode across the relay’s 
coil, to prevent voltage spikes damaging the transistor during switching. Figure 13.23 
shows this arrangement.
Pulse-Width Modulation
The schematic shown in Fig. 13.23 is also suitable for controlling inductive loads like 
dc motors. If the digital output is driven as PWM, then this circuit can also be used to 
control the power going to the motor, and hence its speed (see Fig. 13.24).
The waveforms on the right in Fig. 13.24 show how you can control the motor 
speed by adjusting the duty-cycle (proportion of time the power is on). The pseudo-
code on the right shows how this is accomplished. Note that some microcontrollers 
also have dedicated hardware support to simplify the process of generating PWM 
signals.
If your microcontroller has fairly robust output drivers, then there is probably 
little point in using the 74HC07 buffer.
Directional Motor Control
Directional control of motors can be achieved using an H-bridge, as shown in  
Fig. 13.25.
Most useful for controlling motor currents of less than a couple of amps are 
IC H-bridges such as the TB6612FNG, which combine all the transistors into 
FIGURE 13.23
Controlling a relay or dc motor from a digital output

882    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
one package. They often also have features such as thermal shutdown, to protect 
against overloading.
Servo Motor Control
We have already touched on controlling servo motors in our robot example project. 
Since the servo uses a control signal, this can be provided directly from a digital out-
put (see Fig. 13.26).
Stepper Motor Control
A stepper motor has a number of coils that must be energized in the correct 
sequence to move the rotor. The arrangement shown in Fig. 13.27 can be used to 
accomplish this. 
FIGURE 13.24
Controlling a dc motor
FIGURE 13.25
Bidirectional motor control

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    883
See Chap. 15 for more information about motors.
13.5.4  Sound Interfaces
Figure 13.28 shows a schematic for detecting sound. The second comparator stage is 
optional, and the output of the first stage could be fed directly into an analog input, 
allowing the sound to be sampled. Most microcontroller ADCs are not terribly fast, 
but even so, they should be able to sample at above 10 kHz, allowing some primitive 
digital signal processing.
When it comes to generating sound, being digital devices, few activities come 
more naturally to a microcontroller than generating a squarewave. All it needs to do 
FIGURE 13.26
Controlling a servo
Stepper motor control
FIGURE 13.27

884    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is set a pin high, wait, set it low, then wait again, and keep repeating those steps. As 
demonstrated earlier in the chapter, both the Arduino library and the BASIC Stamp 
provide commands to do this directly. If you are using a piezo speaker, this can be 
driven directly from a digital output. If you are using a electromagnetic loudspeaker, 
then this will be beyond the drive capabilities of an output pin, and you will need to 
amplify the signal. For a range of audio amplifier circuits, refer to Chap. 16. But given 
that a squarewave sounds pretty harsh, then high-quality amplification is unneces-
sary, and a circuit like the one shown in Fig. 13.21, where the load is a loudspeaker, 
will work just fine. Make sure you do the math to check that the transistor can cope 
with the collector current, as most loudspeakers are 8 Ω. 
Generating a sine wave requires a bit of thought and effort. A first idea may be 
to use the PWM output of one of the pins to write out the waveform. However, the 
PWM switching frequency for most microcontrollers is at an audio frequency, so 
without a lot of care, the signal will sound as bad as a squarewave. A better way is 
to use a DAC, which has a number of digital inputs and produces an output voltage 
proportional to the digital input value. Fortunately, it is very easy to make a simple 
DAC—all you need are resistors. 
Figure 13.29 shows a DAC using an R-2R resistor network. It uses resistors of a 
value R and twice R, so R might be 5 KΩ and 2R 10 KΩ. Each of the digital inputs 
will be connected to an Arduino digital output. The four digits represent the 4 bits 
of a digital number, so this gives us 16 different analog outputs. Higher-resolution 
DACs can be made by using more stages. Alternatively, DAC ICs, which can be more 
convenient to use, are available.
13.5.5  Serial Interfaces
There are a number of different standards for serial interfaces to microcontrollers, 
which use different numbers of pins and approaches to communication. In this sec-
tion, we will explore some of them and look at how they can be used to connect 
things to a microcontroller.
When communicating with a peripheral, whichever serial interface it uses, there 
are a number of ways that the microcontroller might interact with the device. You 
may simply issue commands from the microcontroller, usually in the form of a 1-byte 
Detecting sound
FIGURE 13.28

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    885
code that means something like “take a temperature reading,” or in the case of serial 
EEPROM, “store this data here.” The device then may respond with a result or value. 
Another common, but far less intuitive, approach is for the device to use registers, 
and some of the commands concerned with fetching and setting bits in the register 
that then control the electronics of the device. So, for instance, setting an I2C FM 
receiver IC to operate in stereo rather than mono involves setting the appropriate 
bit in a register using a general-purpose write-register command, rather than a com-
mand specific to setting the mode to mono or stereo.
1-Wire Bus
As the name implies, the 1-Wire serial bus uses just a single connection (apart 
from a common ground) to communicate. This standard was developed by Dallas 
Semiconductors and is used in a variety of sensors and other devices such as ADCs 
and EEPROM. It can operate at either 5 V or 3.3 V, so always check that a device you 
are connecting to your microcontroller operates at the same voltage. If it doesn’t, then 
damage may ensue.
The DS18B20 temperature sensor uses the 1-Wire interface. This sensor was intro-
duced in Chap. 6. In this chapter, we will look at how the sensor can be used in para-
sitic power mode, so that only two connections are needed from the microcontroller 
to the device. Furthermore, up to 255 devices can be connected to the same wire. 
Figure 13.30 shows a DS18B20 attached to a microcontroller. 1-Wire devices act 
as either a master or slave. The microcontroller will be the master, and the periph-
eral devices, such as sensors, the slave. The slave devices contain a capacitor that is 
charged from the bus when no data is being transferred and used to power the slave 
device while the bus is being used for data. When the DS18B20 is being used this 
way, its GND and Vdd connections are tied together. The communication is two-way,

so the microcontroller will use the pin as both an input and an output, changing the 
pin’s direction while the program is running. Every slave device has a unique 64-bit 
identifier that is programmed into ROM during manufacture.
Communication is always initiated by the master (microcontroller), which will 
put the data line into output mode and send a command as a sequence of pulses. The 
data line is pulled up to 5 V, so pulses are from 5 V to GND. A pulse of 60 µS signifies 
a 0, and 15 µS indicates a 1.
When the microcontroller needs to issue a command, it first sends a reset pulse 
of at least 480 µS, followed by the command sequence that includes the identifier of 
the device. The available device IDs are found by a special search protocol where 
the master sends a command that requests devices with a particular bit in their ID 
to respond. If more than one responds, then it tries another bit, and in this way, effi-
ciently identifies all the devices.
Any microcontroller that you use with 1-Wire will have a library and example 
code for using the bus, so there is little point in looking at the low-level protocol. The 
following fragments of code illustrate how the Arduino OneWire library is used with 
a DS18B20.
#include <OneWire.h> 
 
OneWire  ds(10);   // DS18B20 on pin 10 
byte data[12];     // buffer for data 
byte addr[8];      // 64 bit device address 
 
void setup(void)  
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  if (ds.search(addr)) 
  { 
    Serial.println("Slave Found"); 
  } 
  else 
  { 
    Serial.println("Slave Not Found");

The first step is to include the OneWire library and define some byte arrays to 
hold the data and the device ID for the DS18B20. The setup function opens a serial 
port, so that the temperature readings can be sent to the Arduino serial monitor, and 
then searches for devices on the 1-Wire bus. There should only be one, and if it is 
found, then a suitable message is displayed.
void loop(void) 
{ 
  Serial.println(getReading()); 
  delay(1000); 
}
The main loop simply calls the function getReading, sends it to the Arduino serial 
monitor, and then pauses for a second.
float getReading() 
{ 
  ds.reset(); 
  ds.select(addr); 
  ds.write(0x44, true);   // command: start temp conversion, 
                          // true for parasitic power mode 
  delay(750);      
 
  ds.reset(); 
  ds.select(addr);     
  ds.write(0xBE);         // command: Read Scratchpad 
 
  for (inti = 0; i< 9; i++)  
  {            
    data[i] = ds.read(); 
  } 
  return (((data[1] << 8) + data[0]) * 0.0625); 
}
The getReading function is where most of the work goes on. It has two com-
mands: one to start the temperature conversion and another to read the data resulting 
from the conversion.
Each command is preceded by a reset. Note how the slave to be communicated 
with is set using ds.select(). We then read the response into the byte array called data. 
To actually decode the temperature, we need only the first 2 bytes of the data, which 
are combined into a 16-bit integer and multiplied by the scaling factor (defined in the 
DS18B20 data sheet) as 0.0625.
Next, we have this line:
(((data[1] << 8) + data[0]) * 0.0625);
This first shifts the byte contained in data[1] left by 8 bits, and then adds in the 
lower 8 bits contained in data[0]. This results in a 16-bit integer that must be multi-
plied by 0.0625 to produce a temperature in degrees Celsius (see the data sheet for 
the DS18B20).
The resulting trace in the Arduino serial monitor should look something like 
Fig. 13.31.

888    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
We have touched on only two of the DS18B20’s commands. For a full list of com-
mands and more information about the protocol, look at the DS18B20 data sheet 
(http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf).
I2C (TWI)
On the face of it, the I2C, also sometimes known as the Two-Wire Interface (TWI), 
serves much the same purpose as 1-Wire, although it has two wires rather than one 
for data. Like 1-Wire, it is a bus and can support multiple devices connected to the 
same two wires. It also can run at either 5 V or 3.3 V. However, it is faster than 1-Wire, 
with top speeds of up to 400 kbits/s.
The two data lines of I2C are open-drain connections that operate as both inputs 
and outputs at the microcontroller. They must have pullup resistors in the same way 
as 1-Wire, but there is no equivalent to the 1-Wire parasitic mode, so remote sensors 
will generally require four wires in total: two for data and two for power.
Figure 13.32 shows how two microcontrollers might communicate using I2C.

I2C microcontroller-to-microcontroller communication
I2C devices are either masters or slaves, and there can be more than one master 
device per bus. In fact, devices are allowed to change roles, although this is not usu-
ally done. It is common for microcontrollers to have an I2C interface and use it to 
exchange data between microcontrollers.
The serial clock line (SCL) is a clock, and the serial data line (SDA) carries the 
data. The timing of these pins is shown in Fig. 13.33. The master supplies the SCL 

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    889
clock, and when there is data to be transmitted, the sender (master or slave) takes the 
SDA line out of tri-state and sends data as logic highs or lows in time with the clock 
signal. When transmission is complete, the clock can stop and the SDA pin be taken 
back to tri-state. 
Whether using I2C or 1-Wire, from a microcontroller, the code is likely to be simi-
lar, and a library is provided to hide the low-level timing of the protocol.
The following example, in Arduino C, shows I2C in action to send data from one 
microcontroller to another. When using I2C to interface with a sensor or other I2C 
slave device, the process is similar, but the messages will generally be packed into 
byte arrays. For this kind of application, every device will be different, and the data 
sheet for the device should be studied to determine the format of the messages that it 
expects. These examples are adapted from the examples provided with the Arduino 
environment. Thanks to Nicholas Zambetti for making this code public domain.
We start with the code for the transmitting microcontroller.
#include <Wire.h> 
 
void setup() 
{ 
Wire.begin(); // join i2c bus 
} 
 
void loop() 
{ 
  Wire.beginTransmission(4);  // transmit to device #4 
  Wire.write("Hello");        // friendly greeting 
  Wire.endTransmission();     // stop transmitting 
  delay(1000); 
}
The transmission is very simple. We just say which device on the bus we want 
to send to, and then send it the data. In this case, the data is a string, but the write 
method can also take a single byte or a byte array as arguments for the data to be sent.
Receiving the data is a little more complex.
#include <Wire.h> 
 
void setup() 
{ 
  Wire.begin(4);                // join i2c bus with address #4

}

{ 
} 
 
void receiveEvent(inthowMany) 
{ 
  while(Wire.available())  
  { 
    char c = Wire.read();    // read a byte as a char 
    Serial.print(c);         // print the character 
  } 
  Serial.print('\n');        // end of line 
}
In this case, the receiver is a slave device and must identify itself—in this case, 
using the number 4 as its argument to Wire.begin. It then registers a function 
receiveEvent, which should be invoked whenever there is incoming data for this 
device. This function simply loops over each byte of data in the message, displaying 
it on the Arduino serial monitor.
Serial Peripheral Interface
Yet another microcontroller bus standard is the SPI bus. This one uses four data lines 
and is faster than the previous buses that we have looked at (up to 80 Mbits/s).
Figure 13.34 shows how a number of peripherals can be connected to the bus. 
Note that there can only be one master device.

The slave devices are not assigned addresses. Instead, the master (usually a micro-
controller) must have a dedicated Slave Select (SS) line for each of the slave devices, 
just selecting the one it communicates with. The other extra line is required because 
separate lines are used for each direction of communication. The Master Out/Slave 
In (MOSI) line carries the data from the master to the slave device, and the Master 
In/Slave Out (MISO) line does the reverse.

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    891
Many different data protocols have been layered over the physical serial interface, 
but the basic principal is the same as for the other buses that we have looked at. The 
approach to take is to find the SPI library for the microcontroller that you intend to 
use and read the data sheet for the device you wish to communicate with.
The SPI specification does not define the bit order for sending data, so make sure 
that your code agrees with the device in this respect.
SPI is also used as a means of ICSP on some microcontrollers, such as the ATmega 
and ATtiny families.
Serial
Many devices use yet another type of interface called just serial. This is a very old 
standard with its roots dating back to the days of teletypes. Some computers with 
serial ports can still be found. In the “good old days,” people used to attach modems 
to them for communicating over phone lines with other computers.
The normal voltages used in the signals for serial ports conform to the standard 
RS-232 and use voltages that swing both positive and negative with respect to GND. 
This is not terribly convenient when using microcontrollers. For this reason, micro-
controllers use the same communication protocol, but at logic levels. This is called 
TTL Serial, although more and more, it is being used by devices using 3.3 V rather 
than 5 V. See the next section for information about level conversion.
Electrically, TTL Serial uses two data pins: Tx and Rx (Transmit and Receive). It is 
not a bus, and the connection is point to point, so there are no problems with address-
ing different devices.
Another remnant from early computer history is the nomenclature around the 
bandwidth of serial connections. A serial connection must be set to the same baud 
rate at both ends of the connection. The baud rate is the number of bits per second, 
but that does include start, stop, and potentially parity bits, so the actual transmis-
sion of data is a little slower than the baud rate. To simplify matching up the baud 
rates at each end of the connection, a set of standard baud rates is used: 110, 300, 600, 
1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 128000, and 256000. Of 
these, 1200 is probably the slowest baud rate commonly in use, and many TTL serial 
devices will not go as high as 115200. 9600 is a very commonly used baud rate, and 
devices will often default to this rate, but be configurable to other rates.
As well as the baud rate, other parameters that define a serial connection are the 
number of bits per word, the type of parity bit, and the number of start and stop bits. 
Almost universally, these are defined as 8, none, and 1, respectively, which is often 
abbreviated to 8N1.
Bits are simply sent as high or low logic levels (see Fig. 13.35). As there is no sepa-
rate clock signal, timing is critical, so after the start bit, the receiver will sample at the

appropriate rate until it has read the 8 data bits and the 1 stop bit. The least significant 
bit of the data is sent first. 
Most microcontrollers will either have dedicated hardware for TTL Serial (a 
UART) or manufacturer-developed software libraries for serial.
13.5.6  Level Conversion
There is a recent trend for microcontrollers and other ICs to use 3.3 V or even 1.8 V 
rather than 5 V. Lower-voltage devices use less current and can be more convenient 
to power from batteries. The same is also true of modules that the microcontrollers 
need to communicate with. While some 3.3 V devices can tolerate 5 V, many cannot. 
This means that if you are communicating with them using one of the bus and serial 
interfaces discussed previously, you will need to make sure that you convert voltage 
levels appropriately.
SPI and TTL Serial Level Conversion
Converting levels on SPI and TTL Serial is quite easy, because they have separate 
lines for each direction of communication. Figure 13.36 shows how resistors can be 
used as simple voltage dividers.

TTL Serial 5 V to 3.3 V level conversion
The Tx output of the 3.3 V device can be connected directly to the Rx input of the 
5 V microprocessor, because it will see any input over about 2.5 V as a logical high 
anyway. The voltage divider is required when the 5 V Tx output of the microproces-
sor must be reduced to prevent damage to the 3.3 V device.
I2C and 1-Wire Level Conversion
The problem is more complex when pins change modes, from being an input and 
being an output, as they do with I2C and 1-Wire. In both these cases, the best solu-
tion is to use a custom level-shifting IC such as the TXS0102, which can convert two 
levels (ideal for I2C). Figure 13.37 shows the TXS0102 used to convert levels for I2C. 
Alternative ICs that perform the same role are the MAX3372, PCA9509, and PCA9306.
13.5.7  LED Display Interfaces
LED displays made up of a number of LEDs encapsulated in a single package 
can be a challenge to control. Such displays will normally be controlled using a 

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    893
microcontroller, however, it is not necessary to use a microcontroller to pin each 
individual LED. Instead, multi-LED displays are organized as common anode or 
common cathode, with all the LED terminals of the anode or cathode connected 
together and brought out through one pin. Figure 13.38 shows how a common 
anode seven-segment display might be wired internally.

A common cathode seven-segment LED display
In a common cathode display like this, the common cathode would be connected 
to ground, and each segment anode driven by a microcontroller pin through a sepa-
rate current-limiting resistor. Do not be tempted to use one resistor on the common 
pin and no resistors on the noncommon connections, as the current will be limited no 
matter how many LEDs are lit, and so the display would get dimmer as more LEDs 
were illuminated.
Multiplexing LED Displays
It is quite common for multiple displays to be contained in the same case. For 
example, Fig. 13.39 shows a three-digit seven-segment common cathode LED dis-
play. In this kind of display, each digit of the display is like the single-digit display 

894    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
of Fig. 13.39 and has its own common cathode. But, in addition, all the A segment 
anodes are connected together, as is each segment.
The microcontroller, or LED driver IC, using the display will activate each com-
mon cathode in turn, turn on the appropriate segments for that digit, and then move 
on to the next digit. This refresh happens very quickly, so that the display appears to 
show different numbers on each digit. This is called multiplexing. The same approach 
can be used with LED matrices, where each column is activated in turn, and then the 
appropriate pins are set for the rows of that column.
Note the use of transistors to control the common cathodes. This is simply to 
handle the current of potentially eight LEDs at once, which would be too much for 
most microcontrollers.
Charlieplexing
When looking to minimize the number of pins used to display a matrix of LEDs, 
an interesting technique called Charlieplexing can be used. (The name comes from 
the inventor Charlie Allen at Maxim.) This technique takes advantage of the feature 
of modern microcontroller I/O pins that allows them to be changed from outputs 
to high-impedance inputs while a program is executing. Figure 13.40 shows the 
arrangement for controlling six LEDs with three pins.

Chapter 13: Microcontrollers    895
Charlieplexing is a dynamic activity, so rather like multiplexing, not all the LEDs 
that you want to be lit are lit at the same time, but they will appear lit as the display 
is refreshed faster than the eye can keep up. To do this, the pins will be high, low, or 
high impedance input, as shown in Table 13.9.

The number of LEDs that can be controlled per microcontroller pin is given by the 
following formula:
 
LEDs = n2 – n
So, if we use 4 pins, we can have 16 – 4, or 12, LEDs, and 10 pins would give us a 
massive 90 LEDs. However, there are problems with scaling Charlieplexing up. One 
is due to the fact that the refresh rate needs to be fast enough to fool the eye, and a 
large number of pins will need a lot of sequence steps to energize all the LEDs that 
need energizing in a refresh cycle. This will also result in the LEDs becoming dim, as 
their duty cycle will be low. You can compensate for this to some extent by increasing 
the current through the LEDs, which will cope with fairly large peak currents for a 
small duration. This does lead to the problem that if the microcontroller freezes for 
some reason, the LEDs could burn out.
Controlling the Color of RGB LEDs
RGB LEDs are actually three LEDs in one package (one red, one green, and one blue). 
The package will often be common anode or common cathode. By controlling the 
power to each of the LEDs separately, it’s possible to set the overall color of the LED 
module to any color at any intensity.
While you could change the intensity of each color channel by controlling the cur-
rent to the LED in an analog fashion, it is far better to control it with a PWM signal. 
The duty cycle will control the brightness of the LED in a far more linear manner than 
controlling the current in an analog fashion. 


897
Designs that use the combinational and sequential logic described in Chap. 12 can 
be built using lots of separate ICs. Maybe you have a design that requires a 10-stage 
counter divider and binary-to-decimal decoder plus a NAND gate or two. While you 
can still buy the chips to make such a circuit, this would never be done for a com-
mercial product. The chip count for the logic part of all but the most complex designs 
is rapidly heading toward one. This one chip might be a microcontroller as described 
in Chap. 13, but this essentially moves the design problem from hardware design 
to software programming. Programming is a discipline with different roots to elec-
tronics and is fraught with problems of maintaining code and managing complexity. 
Software solutions can also be slow, as the software effectively has to ape what the 
equivalent logic circuit would be doing.
When using a microcontroller, you write code to be run on the device as the device 
is in use. An alternative approach (programmable logic) is to use a field-programma-
ble gate array (FPGA) or for smaller projects a complex programmable logic device 
(CPLD).
Using an FPGA or CPLD involves creating a combinational or sequential logic 
design, either by actually drawing out the gates, counter, shift registers, etc., into a 
CAD system, or describing the logic design using a hardware definition language 
(HDL). This description of the logic, either pictorial or textual, is then used to con-
figure general-purpose logic cells in the chip to the hardware that you want. It’s like 
creating your own custom chip containing just the logic that you need.
Programmable logic has a reputation for being difficult and inaccessible to the 
nonprofessional. While the technology of reconfigurable hardware takes some getting 
used to, the manufacturers of programmable logic devices have become less propri-
etary in their approach in recent years and even offer free to use design software for 
the inventor. In this chapter, you will learn how to get started with programmable 
logic, in particular using the Xilinx software tool ISE Studio and the Verilog hardware 
description language.
Since the best way to learn is to actually try things out, this chapter will use the 
Elbert 2 FPGA development board from Numato Labs (http://numato.com/elbert-
v2-spartan-3a-fpga-development-board.html).
Programmable Logic
CHAPTER 14

898    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
14.1  Programmable Logic
In the early days of digital computing, large numbers of logic gate ICs were combined 
onto printed circuit boards (PCBs) to make computer boards that would then be 
attached to a back-plane. You might have found hundreds of ICs on a single PCB, 
each of these chips containing a handful of gates or shift registers.
The arrival of large-scale integration (LSI) and the invention of the microproces-
sor reduced the IC count enough to use in home computing. However, open up a 
home computer from the early 1980s and you may still see rows of logic chips provid-
ing all the other functions that the computer needed: keyboard scanning, a cassette 
tape data storage interface, video output, etc.
All this clutter could easily fit on a single LSI chip, but having your own 
application-specific IC (ASIC) is a seriously expensive thing to do and was only pos-
sible for large production runs. Enter the programmable array logic (PAL). The PAL 
designed by Monolithic Memories Inc. was not the first programmable logic IC, but 
it was the first to really take off commercially.
The internal structure of the PAL is a sum of products arrangement of gates (see 
the section “AND-OR-INVERTER Gates” in Chap. 12). Figure 14.1 shows such an 
arrangement.
FIGURE 14.1  A sum of products term.
The inverted and noninverted inputs to the AND (sum) part of the logic are 
switched using “fuses” that can be blown during the manufacturing process or using 
special programming hardware. Some devices could only be programmed once 
while others were reprogrammable.
This idea of using cells of configurable logic underpins all modern types of pro-
grammable logic, although the scale and complexity has increased and the effort 
involved in programming them has decreased.
FPGAs generally have hundreds of thousands of logic cells. This is great if your 
FPGA is doing something complex, but may be excessive if you just want the equiva-
lent of a few logic gates. To address such small needs, CPLDs are used. These are 
the natural successors to PALs and operate in a similar manner, using “macro cells” 
that implement the sum of products–type terms of Fig. 14.1. FPGAs use a different 
arrangement that will be explained in the next section.
The design tools that are used to “program” CPLDs and FPGAs are now so 
sophisticated that there is little need for the designer to think in terms of the actual 
logic gates on the silicon. Instead, they can simply draw their design using logic gates 

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    899
chosen from a palette, connect them all up, specify the inputs and outputs, and then 
let the tool manage the process of translating that design into configuration of the 
programmable logic device (see Fig. 14.2).
FIGURE 14.2  Designing with logic gates.
Taking this a step further, you can skip the logic diagram stage entirely and express 
your design in a hardware description language like Verilog or VHDL and then have 
your software tool convert that into configuration information for the programmable 
logic chip.
Getting into mind-bending territory, you can (and people do) design a microcon-
troller on the FPGA (along with other logic circuitry) that then runs a program.
14.2  FPGAs
The main difference between FPGAs and CPLDs is that FPGAs do not use logic cells 
in a sum of products arrangement, but rather the cells use a lookup table (LUT). The 
lookup table will have a number of inputs say six inputs and a single output. You can 
think of this as a 64 × 1 bit ROM, with the inputs being the address lines of the ROM 
and the output being the bit stored at that address. The contents of these LUTs, com-
bined with other routing information, are what give the FPGA its logic.
LUTs are often not exactly arranged as a single six-input unit, but may comprise 
two five-input units, the sixth input being a select input that selects between the two 
LUTs. This allows extra flexibility when it comes to how the design software connects 
everything together.
The LUT will often be combined with extra components like a flip-flop to make 
an individual logic block.
Figure 14.3 shows a logical view of how this is all arranged.

900    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
General-purpose IO (GPIO) pins on the FPGA chip are connected to special-
purpose IO (input/output) blocks that provide buffered microcontroller-like inputs 
and outputs that can typically source or sink a few tens of milliamps.
The vast bulk of the functional units in the FPGA will be logic blocks and a typical 
modern FPGA may have from 200,000 to several million of these blocks. There may 
also be a fixed RAM block for use when the FPGA is to be configured as a proces-
sor. Taking this to its extreme you find high-end SoC (systems on a chip) FPGAs 
that include fixed high-performance processor cores and memory on a chip that also 
includes configurable logic cells. FPGAs are also often used to prototype an ASIC for 
very large production runs.
Routing between such vast numbers of logic blocks is pretty tricky, but fortu-
nately for us, we don’t have to do it, that’s what the design software is for. 
The information in the LUTs and the routing matrix (that defines the interconnec-
tions) is volatile. When you lose power, all that information disappears and the FPGA 
reverts to its original state. To configure the FPGA the configuration is usually stored 
outside of the FPGA in EEPROM. The FPGA will generally have a fixed hardware 
loading interface built in to it that will pull in the configuration as the FPGA starts up. 
This typically takes less than 200 ms.
14.3  ISE and the Elbert V2
There are quite a few FPGA vendors now, but the two biggest players are Xilinx 
(Xilinx.com) and Altera (altera.com); between them, they have almost 90 percent of 
the programmable logic market. Of the two, Xilinx has the largest share.
All the FPGA manufacturers have their own design tools that work specifically 
with their hardware. In this chapter we will use the Xilinx Sparta 3A FPGA chip with 
Xilinx’s design tool called ISE.
FIGURE 14.3  The logical structure of an FPGA.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    901
To get some practical experience of using an FPGA, there are a number of FPGA 
development boards that combine an FPGA with its configuration ROM and a 
selection of input/output devices, such as LEDs, switches, audio and video inter-
faces. The device that has been selected for this chapter is the Elbert V2 board, 
which is widely available and low cost, and includes its own USB interface for 
programming.
14.3.1  Installing ISE
The design tools of the FPGA manufacturers are frankly bloated monsters. The ISE 
design tool is a 7-GB (that’s right, gigabyte!) download. In many ways getting and 
installing the design tool is the hardest part of getting started with FPGAs. Once you 
have done that everything else seems relatively simple.
The first step in obtaining ISE is to visit Xilinx.com with your web browser and 
find the ISE download page, which you will find by following the links: Developer 
Zone->ISE Design Suite->Downloads. Scroll down the “downloads” area to ISE 
Design Suite (we used version 14.7). Do not be tempted to download the newer 
Vivado Design Suite. This is only for newer Xilinx FPGAs and does not support the 
Spartan 3A used on the Elbert 2.
There are Windows and Linux versions of the tool. In this book we will just 
describe the process of getting up and running in Windows.
When you click on the “Download” button, a long complicated survey will appear 
that you have to complete followed by a second long and complicated registration 
form. Persevere and eventually the download will start and you can go and do some-
thing else for a few hours while the download completes.
After installation you have to click on the link to request a free license key for 
ISE Web. This will be e-mailed to you as an attachment; save the file and then from 
ISE open the license manager from the Manage License option on the Help menu 
of ISE and add the license.
14.4  The Elbert 2 Board
Figure 14.4 shows the Elbert 2 board.
These boards are available direct for Numato Labs (http://numato.com) or from 
Amazon.com and various other sources. The price of the entire board was just $29.95 
at the time of writing. The only other thing you will need is a USB to mini-USB lead.

• Spartan XC3S50A FPGA in TQG144 package 
• 16-MB SPI flash memory for configuration
• USB 2.0 interface for on-board flash programming 
• Eight LEDs 
• Six push buttons
• 8-way DIP switch 
• VGA connector 

902    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
• Stereo jack 
• Micro SD card adapter
• Three seven-segment displays 
• 39 IOs for user-defined purposes
• On-board voltage regulators 
14.4.1  Installing the Elbert Software
The Elbert board has a software utility for programming the board. This handles just 
the final step of copying the binary file generated by ISE onto the Elbert V2’s flash 
memory. There is also a USB driver to install for Windows users. To set up your com-
puter to use the Elbert, visit the product page for the Elbert V2 at numato.com and 
click on the Downloads tab.
You will need to download:
• Configuration tool: This is used to program the board
• Numato Lab USB CDC driver
• User manual
To install the USB driver on Windows, plug the Elbert V2 board into your 
computer and the New Hardware Wizard should start. Point the wizard at the 
extracted “numatocdc” folder and the driver should install and the new hardware 
be recognized.
After this, the Elbert V2 will be connected to one of the virtual COM ports of your 
PC. To find out which port, open the Windows Device Manager and you should find 
it listed in the Ports section as shown in Fig. 14.5.

14.5  Downloads
All the code examples used in this book can be found in the GitHub repository 
(https://github.com/simonmonk/pefi4).
To install the examples on your PC, click on the “Download ZIP” button in the 
bottom right of the GitHub page and then extract the file. You will find the examples 
in the folder “fpga.”
It is worth working through the examples below to build-up the projects and get 
used to using ISE, but if you get stuck and need to compare what you have done with 
the final working design, then these files will come in handy.
14.6  Drawing Your FPGA Logic Design
The ISE design tool gives you two ways of programming your FPGA. One is to draw 
a familiar logic diagram and the second is to use the Verilog hardware description 
language (HDL). We will start with the schematic approach, although seasoned 
FPGA designers nearly always use Verilog or its rival VHDL.
For this first example, we will go into quite a lot of detail on using the ISE tool to 
get you up and running.
14.6.1  Example 1: A Data Selector
The first example that we will make is the data selector that you first met in Chap. 12 
(Fig. 12.32). The schematic for this is repeated in Fig. 14.6.
The three inputs (A, B, and “data select”) for this circuit will be hooked up to three 
of the push buttons on the Elbert V2 and the output will be connected to one of the 
LEDs so that we can see the circuit actually in use.
Step 1: Create a New Project
The first step is to fire up ISE and then select File->New Project from the menu. This 
will open the New Project Wizard shown in Fig. 14.7.
FIGURE 14.5  Finding the Elbert V2 port.

904    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Enter “data_selector” in the Name field. In the Location field navigate to the folder 
where you want to keep your ISE designs. The Working Directory field will auto-
matically update to match this directory, so you don’t need to change the Working 
Directory field.
Change the “Top-level source type” drop-down to “Schematic” and then click 
“Next.”
This will take you to the Project Settings shown in Fig. 14.8.
Change the settings so that they match Fig. 14.8 and then click “Next” again. The 
Wizard will then show you a summary of the new project and you can then click 
“Finish.”
This will create for you the new, but empty project shown in Fig. 14.9.
The screen is divided into four main areas:
In the top left you have the Project View. This is where you can find the various 
files that go to make up a project. It is organized as a tree structure. Initially there are 
A

two entries in this area. There is the entry that says “data_selector” and the second 
entry that has a seemingly random name (xc3s50a-4tq144). The latter will eventually 
contain two files, the schematic drawing that we are about to create and an imple-
mentation constraints file that defines how the inputs and outputs in the schematic 
connect to the actual switches and LEDs on the Elbert V2.
FIGURE 14.8  The New Project Wizard—Project Settings.
FIGURE 14.9  A new project.

906    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You can also double-click on “xc3s50a-4tq144” to open the project properties. So, 
if you made a mistake setting the project properties using the New Project Wizard, 
you can always correct it by double-clicking on this entry.
To the left, beneath the Project View is the Design View. This will eventually list 
useful actions that we can apply to our design including generating the binary file for 
programming the Elbert V2.
The wide area at the bottom of the window is the console. This is where error 
messages will appear.
The large area to the right of the window is the editor area. When it comes to 
drawing the schematic, this is where you will do it.
Step 2: Create a New Schematic Source
To create a new schematic, right click on data_selector in the Project View and select 
the option “New Source.” This will open the New Source Wizard (Fig. 14.10).
FIGURE 14.10  The New Source Wizard.
Select a Source Type of “Schematic” and enter “data_selector” in the File name 
field and then click “Next.” A summary screen will appear, to which you can respond 
by clicking “Finish.” This will result in a blank canvas being prepared for us in which 
we can draw the schematic.
This is shown in Fig. 14.11, labelling the parts that you are going to need.
The icon menu bar running vertically to the left of the editor area controls the 
mode of the window and also what appears on the left-hand side of the window:
• The top icon (an arrow) puts the window into select mode. You will need to click 
on this before you can drag circuit symbols about or change their properties.
• Click on the “Add wire” mode when you are connecting the gates and other circuit 
symbols together.
• IO markers are used to indicate the boundary between the schematic you are 
designing and the actual pins of the FPGA IC. This mode lets you add these symbols.
• Add logic symbols. This is the mode selected in Fig. 14.11. The left hand panel then 
divides into a top half that shows categories of circuit symbol and a bottom half 
that has a list of the component symbols in that category.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    907
FIGURE 14.11  The schematic editor.
Step 3: Add the Logic Symbols
Put the screen into “Add logic symbols” mode. You are going to need to add two 
two-input AND gates, a two-input OR gate and two invertors.
Click on the category “Logic” the select “and2” (2 input AND). Then click twice 
in the editor area to drop the two and gates. Then select “or2” and drop an OR gate 
in roughly the right location to the right of the AND gates, and final add in the two 
invertors (“inv”) below and to the left of the AND gates.
Zoom in a bit (Toolbar at the top of the window) and the editor area should look 
something like Fig. 14.12.
Step 4: Connect the Gates
Click on the “Add wire” icon and then connect the gates together in the arrangement 
of Fig. 14.6. To make a connection, click the mouse on one of the square connection 
points and drag out to the connection point or line that you want to connect to. The 
software will automatically put bends in the line for you. If you need to more things 
to tidy the diagram up then you can change to “Select” mode and drag the symbols 
and wires about.
The end result should be Fig. 14.13.
Step 5: Add the IO Markers
Click on the “Add IO Markers” icon and then add markers to all the inputs and the 
output by dragging the mouse out from the wire in question. Notice how the soft-
ware figures out that the output is an output.

908    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Initially, the connections are all given names like XLXN_1, etc. To change these 
names to more meaningful names, change to “Select” mode, right-click on an IO 
connector and chose the menu option “Rename Port.” Change the port names so that 
they agree with Fig. 14.14.
FIGURE 14.12  The logic gates in position.
FIGURE 14.13  Connecting the symbols with wires.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    909
FIGURE 14.14  The completed schematic.
Notice that we have called the output Q. This is because the word “OUT” is 
reserved for use by ISE, so you cannot call any of your connections “OUT” or you 
will get an error when you try and build the project.
The schematic is now complete, and now would be a good time to do “File->Save” 
to save the schematic design to file.
Step 6: Create an Implementation Constrains File
Now you need to get back to the original Project View to be able to create a new 
source file. Click on the little “Xs” in the top right corners of the various views that 
will have become layered on top of the Project View. You may also have to click the 
“Design” tab at the bottom of the Design View.
Right-click on “data_selector” and again select “New Source” to open the New 
Source Wizard. This time, select “Implementation Constraints File” and enter the 
file name “data_selector_elbert” as shown in Fig. 14.15. Click “Next” and finish the 
wizard.
This will open an empty text editor window where you need to type the following 
text:
# User Constraint File for data selector 
# implementation on Elbert V2
# Push buttons
NET “A” LOC = P80;   # SW1
NET “B” LOC = P79;   # SW2
NET “SEL” LOC = P78; # SW3

910    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
# Internal pull-ups need to be enabled
NET “A” PULLUP;
NET “B” PULLUP;
NET “SEL” PULLUP;
# LED
NET “Q” LOC = P46;  # LED8
The lines that begin with a # are comment lines. That is, like the lines of program 
code starting with // in Arduino C take no part in the functioning of the program, 
the lines starting with # are not part of the configuration information, they are just to 
make it easier to see what is going on.
In the section that starts with “# Push Buttons” you can see the link between the 
IO Connector names on the schematic and the FPGA GPIO pins that are connected to 
the switches. So, SW1 is connected to P80, etc.
FIGURE 14.15  Creating an Implementation Constraints File.
FIGURE 14.16  The switch and LED pin allocations for the Elbert V2.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    911
The connections from FPGA GPIO pins to the hardware 
provided on the Elbert V2 are all detailed in the Elbert user 
manual. Figure 14.16 taken from the manual with kind permission 
of Numata shows the pin allocations associated with the switches 
and LEDs.
The GPIO pins of the FPGA have configurable pull-up 
resistors and these are enabled in the implementation constraints 
file. The final line of the constraints file associates the output Q 
with pin P46.
Step 7: Generate the Programming File
You are now ready to generate the programming file to be down-
loaded onto the Elbert V2. So, select the data_selector entry in the 
hierarchy and a number of options for things to do will appear 
below it in the Processes section. One of those processes will be 
“Generate Programming File” (see Fig. 14.17). Right click on this 
option and select “Run.”
If all is well, there will be lots of text appearing in the Console 
as the programming file is generated. If there are any errors this is 
where they will appear, so read the error message carefully and it 
should point to where the problem is.
Step 8: Program the Elbert V2
The end result of all this activity will be a file within the working 
directory of the project called data_selector.bit. It is this file 
that we need to transfer onto the Elbert V2 using the Elbert V2 
Configuration Tool that you downloaded earlier.
Start up the program and then click on Open File. Navigate 
to the working directory for the project and select the file data_ 
selector.bit. Change the COM port in the drop-down list to match 
the COM port allocated to the Elbert that you discovered 
earlier (see Fig. 14.5) and then press the Program button. 
After a while, you should see a reassuring message appear 
(Fig. 14.18).
The FPGA on the Elbert V2 is now configured to be the 
data selector.
Testing the Result
Initially, you should see the D8 LED on the Elbert V2 lit. 
If you press SW2 the LED will turn off. Release the button 
and LED 8 will turn on again. Pressing SW1 will have no 
effect. Now hold SW3 down and you will notice that SW2 
no longer has any effect but SW1 does alter the LEDs state. 
This is the data selector working how it should. The logic 
is a little confusing, because the inputs are effectively inverted 
as they are pulled to GND when you press the button.

ming file.

912    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Viewing the Technology Schematic and Floorplan
Although it is perfectly ok to just trust ISE to do all the work of laying out and 
connecting up the FPGA for us, it is fun, if not particularly useful to peek under the 
hood and see what exactly it did.
You can see some of this information using other tools that are accessible from the 
Project view. 
If you expand the Synthesize XST line in the Processes, you will see an option 
“View Technology Schematic.” If you run this, you will get to see the schematic gen-
erated by ISE that includes additional IO buffers (Fig. 14.19).
FIGURE 14.19  The automatically generated schematic.
You can actually see which parts of the FPGA silicon were used for your design if 
you select the menu option Tools->Planahead->Floorplan Area (Fig. 14.20).
14.6.2  Example 2: A 4-bit Ripple Counter
In the second example using the schematic approach, we move beyond simple com-
binational logic to a ripple counter, again taken from Chap. 12, where you will find it 
in Fig. 12.75. This is repeated here as Fig. 14.21 for convenience.
As you did with the selector, start by creating a new project. Give it the name 
“ripple_counter.” You should find that when you run the New Project Wizard, this 
time, it remembers all the project settings from the last project.
Create a new Schematic source (“ripple_counter”) and draw the schematic.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    913
It can be hard to find the right symbols, so you will probably need to drop a 
selection of symbols onto the canvas before you find the right ones. Delete the ones 
you don’t want by selecting then and then pressing the delete key. The symbol we 
used for each JK Flipflop was found in the category Flip_Flop and called fjkc. Add 
some IO Markers for CLK, CLR and Q0 to Q3. You will also need to add four VCC 
symbols (“General” category) to pull the J and K pins high. The end result of this 
should look like Fig. 14.22.

914    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You also need to create an implementation constraints file and place the following 
contents in it.
# User Constraint File for 4-bit ripple counter
# implementation on Elbert V2
NET “CLK” CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE;
# Push button switch 1 is connected to pin 80
NET “CLK” LOC = P80;   # SW1
NET “CLR” LOC = P79;   # SW2
# Internal pull-ups need to be enabled
NET “CLK” PULLUP;
NET “CLR” PULLUP;
# LEDs
NET “Q0” LOC = P55;   # LED1
NET “Q1” LOC = P54;   # LED2
NET “Q2” LOC = P51;   # LED3
NET “Q3” LOC = P50;   # LED4
The new first like specifies that although the CLK is a clock pin it does not need 
the specialized clock connectivity lines that the FPGA can provide, since we are just 
going to be driving the clock using the push buttons.
Generate the Programming file and then deploy it onto the Elbert V2 using the 
Configuration tool. 
When you come to test the project using the button, you will need to keep SW2 
depressed, as this is the CLR (clear button) and the input from the switch is inverted.
You will also notice that there is a fair bit of key bouncing from the push switches 
and the LEDs may skip past some of the binary numbers.
14.7  Verilog
Verilog is a hardware description language. Along with its rival language VHDL, it is 
what is most commonly used to program an FPGA.
You probably found that programming a FPGA using schematic is familiar and 
easy to understand, so why would you want to learn a complicated programming 
language to do the same thing? Well, the answer is that actually as designs become

more and more complex, it can be easier to represent a design using a programming 
language than to draw it.
While it is feasible to use the schematic approach when designing some simple 
logic that could fit on a CPLD, as complexity increases, the problem of drawing all 
those gates and connecting them up gets impractical.
Verilog looks like a programming language and indeed you will find “if” state-
ments, code blocks and other software-like constructions.
14.7.1  Modules
Software programmers will recognise a Verilog module as being very like a class in 
object-oriented programming. It defines a collection of logic with public and private 
properties that can be instantiated a number of times in your design.
For nonprogrammers, it is probably best to think of it as a sub-assembly of the 
design with defined connections to be able to wire it up to other modules.
A simple design may be all contained in a single module, but when things 
start to get a little complex, the design will become a load of modules that are then 
interconnected.
14.7.2  Wires, Registers, and Busses
What would be variables in a conventional programming language are, in Verilog, 
wires (connecting one thing to another) or registers (that store state and are therefore 
more like a programming variable). These refer to a single binary digit. Often, you 
don’t want to work on a single bit and so you can group a number of bits into a bus 
and operate on the bus as a whole (sometimes also called a vector). This is rather like 
using a word of arbitrary length in a conventional programming language.
14.7.3  Parallel Execution
Because Verilog is describing hardware rather than software, there is an implicit par-
allelism in Verilog. If you have three counters in a design, all connected to different 
clocks, that is just fine. Each will do its own thing. It is not like using a microcontroller 
where there is a single thread of execution.
14.7.4  Number Format
A lot of the time, in Verilog, you will be dealing with a bus and it is convenient to 
assign values using numbers of any bit size in any radix. To accomplish this, Verilog 
uses a special number syntax. If you do not specify the number of bits and the radix, 
then the number is assumed to be decimal and unused bits are set to 0.
The number format starts with the number of bits, then there is an apostrophe, 
followed by a radix indicator (b, binary; h, hex; d, decimal) and then the number 
constant.
Here are some Verilog integer constants:
• 4’b1011—4-digit binary constant 
• 8’hF2—8-bit hex constant 

916    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
14.8  Describing Your FPGA Design in Verilog
In this section, you will work though using ISE to replicate the two earlier designs of 
a data selector and ripple counter in Verilog rather than using the schematic editor. 
You will then go on to look at some more complex designs where the modular and 
concise nature of using a HDL starts to pay dividends.
14.8.1  A Data Selector in Verilog
Rather than just looking at the Verilog code in isolation, let’s combine it with learning 
how to use it in ISE.
The first step is to create a new project. This time, when the New Project Wizard 
appears (Fig. 14.23), give it the name “data_selector_verilog,” change the drop-
down list at the bottom (top-level source type) to be HDL, and click “Next” and then 
“Finish” at the summary screen.
FIGURE 14.23  The New Project Wizard.
Now we need to create a new source file for the Verilog version of the data selector. 
So, right-click on the project and select the option “New Source.” This will open the 
New Source Wizard (Fig. 14.24).
Select a source type of Verilog Module and give the source the name “data_selector” 
and then click “Next.” This will allow you to define the inputs and outputs to the 
module (Fig. 14.25).
Use the wizard window to define three inputs (A, B, and SEL) and one output 
(Q). Then click “Next” and then after the summary screen click “Finish.” The wizard 
will then generate a template file for your Verilog module using the information you 
entered in the wizard (Fig. 14.26).
At present, this module does not actually do anything. We will add that Verilog 
code to it shortly. 

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    917
FIGURE 14.24  Creating a new Verilog source file.
FIGURE 14.25  Defining inputs and outputs for the new 
Verilog source.
Let’s analyze what has been generated by the Wizard. Here is the code that was 
generated.
module data_selector(
    input A,
    input B,
    input SEL,
    outputQ
    );
endmodule
The module starts with the “module” keyword and is followed by the name of 
the module. Inside the parentheses, the inputs and outputs to the module. The word 
“endmodule” marks the end of the module definition.

918    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Modify the text so that it appears as below. Note that the additions are marked in 
bold.
module data_selector(
    input A,
    input B,
    input SEL,
    output reg Q
    );
always @(A or B or SEL)
begin
 if (SEL) 
  
Q = A;
 else
  
Q = B;
end
endmodule
The first change is the addition of the word “reg” to the output definition for Q. 
This indicates that Q is a register and can therefore be modified.
The other addition is the “always” block. Immediately after “always” is the 
“sensitivity” list that follows “@.” This specifies the signals (separated by the word 
“or”) to which the “always” block is sensitive. That is the code between “begin” and 
“end” comes into play. It is very easy to think of this code as if it were a programming 
language rather than a hardware definition language.
FIGURE 14.26  The generated module code.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    919
If SEL is 1 then Q will be assigned to whatever the state of A is. Otherwise Q will 
be set to the value at the B input. This is exactly what the selector should do.
That’s all there is to the Verilog, however you still need an implementation 
constraints file if you want to try out the example on the Elbert V2. The one that you 
created for the schematic version of this project will work just fine. You can copy 
the implementation constraints file from the other project by right-clicking on the 
project name and clicking “Add Copy of Source.” This will allow you to take a copy 
of “data_selector_elbert.ucf.”
Build the project and then install it on the Elbert in the same way as you did for 
the schematic project. The project should work in exactly the same way.
14.8.2  A Ripple Counter in Verilog
The ripple counter schematic project can also be implemented in Verilog. This time, 
when you create the new project (you could call it “ripple_counter_verilog,””), add 
the inputs and outputs as shown in Fig. 14.27.
FIGURE 14.27  Defining the inputs and outputs for the ripple 
counter.
The output Q is defined as being a bus by checking the Bus checkbox. The MSB 
column indicates its most significant bit number (in this case 3) and the LSB of 0 is 
entered in the LSB column.
Finish of the wizard and the generated code will start like this:
module ripple_counter(
    input CLK,
    input CLR,
    output [3:0] Q
    );
You now need to add the counting logic for the counter, so edit the code to be:
module ripple_counter(
    input CLK,
    input CLR,
    output reg [3:0] Q
    );

920    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
always @(posedge CLK, posedge CLR)
begin
 if (CLR)
  
Q <= 0;
 elseif (CLK)
  
Q <= Q + 1;
end
endmodule
The added code is shown in bold. The sensitivity list in the always block includes 
positive edges of either the CLK or CLR signals. If either of these happen, then the 
code between begin and end comes into play. This simply says that if CLR goes high, 
then the count Q gets set back to 0 and if CLK is high then 1 is added to Q.
Note that in this case, since 0 and 1 are the same in any radix, we have not specified 
the radix or number of bits in the number constants.
You now need to add an implementation constraints file for the project that looks 
like this:
# User Constraint File for 4-bit ripple counter implementation 
on Elbert V2
NET “CLK” CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE;
# Push button switch 1 is connected to pin 80
NET “CLK” LOC = P80;   # SW1
NET “CLR” LOC = P79;   # SW2
# Internal pull-ups need to be enabled 
NET “CLK” PULLUP;
NET “CLR” PULLUP;
# LEDs
NET “Q[0]” LOC = P55;   # LED1
NET “Q[1]” LOC = P54;   # LED2
NET “Q[2]” LOC = P51;   # LED3
NET “Q[3]” LOC = P50;   # LED4
This is very similar to the one for the schematic-based counter, but in this case the 
separate bits of the Q bus are linked to the LEDs using a square bracket notation to 
indicate the bit linked to a particular LED.
Generate the binary file and install it on your Elbert V2 board and you should 
have something that behaves just like the schematic version.
14.9  Modular Design
When designing a complex system for a FPGA there is nothing to stop you putting all 
your Verilog code into one module. However, by splitting things up, it firstly makes 
it easier for others to understand what you have done as they can assume that the 
component modules perform the role they are supposed to and therefore see a bigger 
picture of how all the modules work together before getting into the nitty-gritty of 
how each one works.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    921
Breaking things up into a number of modules also makes it a log easier to take a 
module that you used in one project and use it in another, or to share it with someone 
else to use in their project.
When you create a project with more than one module, you will always have a 
top-level module. This is the module that brings all the sub-modules together and 
also the module that will have an implementation constraints file associated with it 
to map the IO pins of the FPGA to the signals in the design.
14.9.1  Counter/Decoder Example
In this example, you will build on the Verilog version of the counter module and 
add a 7-segment LED decoder module, so that it can count in decimal on one of the 
7-segment LEDS on the Elbert 2 board. 
See Sec. 13.3.2 for information on 7-segment decoding. The basic idea is that a 
four-digit binary input will be decoded into 7 segment bits for a segment display for 
the decimal values 0 to 9.
Figure 14.28 shows the relationship between the three modules that will be 
defined for this project.
FIGURE 14.28  Counter/decoder modules.
In this case, the top-level module will use one counter and one decoder module 
and combine them into a new module (counter_decoder).
Let’s start with the counter module, because we have already made this module 
once in the project ripple_counter_verilog. So, from the file menu use the option 
“Add copy of source” and go and find “ripple_counter.v” in the other project and 
add it to this project. It should look like this:
module ripple_counter(
    input CLK,
    input CLR,
    output reg [3:0] Q
    );

922    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
always @(posedge CLK, posedge CLR)
begin
 if (CLR)
  
Q <= 0;
 elseif (CLK)
  
Q <= Q + 1;
end
endmodule
Next, you are going to create a new Verilog source called “decoder_7_seg.v.” It 
should have a 4-bit bus input called D (the numeric digit 0 to 9 in 4 bits) and an 8-bit 
bus output SEG for each of the 7 segments of the display (plus 1 for the decimal 
point). The module it contains should look like this:
module decoder_7_seg(
    input [3:0] D,
    output reg [7:0] SEG
    );
always @(D)
begin
    case(D)
        0: SEG <= 8’b00000011;
        1: SEG <= 8’b10011111; 
        2: SEG <= 8’b00100101;
        3: SEG <= 8’b00001101;
        4: SEG <= 8’b10011001;
        5: SEG <= 8’b01001001;
        6: SEG <= 8’b01000001;
        7: SEG <= 8’b00011111;
        8: SEG <= 8’b00000001;
        9: SEG <= 8’b00001001;
        default: SEG <= 8’b11111111;
    endcase
end
endmodule
This time the always block just has a sensitivity list of the input data (D). 
The “case” statement will be familiar to C and Java programmers as being a 
“switch” statement. It is a short-hand way of chaining together a whole load of 
“if”statements. The “case” command takes a parameter (in this case D) and if 
value of D is 0, it sets the bit pattern for SEG to 8’b00000011. If D is 1 then SEG 
is set to the second bit pattern down, and so on. Note that the segment bits are 
inverted. A 0 means that that segment will be lit—that’s just how the Elbert V2 is 
wired up.
Both the decoder and counter modules are both going to be used by the top-
level module that we will call “counter_decoder.” Create a new Verilog source file 
called counter_decoder.v with the single input CLK and the 8-bit bus output SEG that 

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    923
will be connected to the segment LEDs. Edit the generated code so that the module 
appears as below:
module counter_decoder(
    input CLK,
    output [7:0] SEG
);
wire [3:0] data;
wire clear = 0;
decoder_7_seg decoder(.D (data), .SEG (SEG));
ripple_counter counter(.Q (data), .CLK (CLK),
 .CLR (clear));
endmodule
This is a pretty sparse module, as most of the work is taking place in the two 
modules that it uses.
To link the data output from the counter (D) to the data input to the 7-segment 
decoder (a different D) a wire bus is defined called “data.” Although the counter has 
a CLR (clear) input, this is not going to be used in the counter_decoder module and 
so a second wire (“clear”) is defined and its value set to 0.
Next comes the part where the two sub-modules are “instantiated” and their 
outputs and inputs coupled.
One way to think of a module is as the name for a logic gate (perhaps an AND 
gate). So instantiating an AND gate would mean adding one to a schematic design. 
You might add (instantiate) several AND gates onto the schematic. In this case, we 
are instantiating first a decoder_7_seg module and then a ripple_counter module.
Looking at the line starting “decoder_7_seg”: the syntax for instantiating a mod-
ule is to first specify the module name (“decoder_7_seg” and then the name of the 
instance (“decoder”). So if your design needed more than one “decoder_7_seg” then 
you could call them “decoder_1”, “decoder_2” and so on.
After the name of the instance comes the bit that allows you to associate the 
inputs and outputs of the instance with signals inside the containing module (in this 
case “counter_decoder”). This is contained in parentheses and is a mechanism that 
software programmers would consider to be like using named parameters. So, “D 
(data) means that the D input to the decoder should be linked to the wire bus called 
“data” in the module counter_decoder. Similarly, “SEG (SEG)” links the SEG output 
of the decoder to the SEG output of “counter_decoder” that will in turn be linked to 
the segment LEDs on the Elbert V2.
A “ripple_counter” instance is created in the same way, linking its Q output to 
“data,” passing through the CLK signal and setting the CLR input to “ripple_counter” 
to be “clear.”
Before you can build this example, you need to tell ISE which module is the 
top-level module. The top-level module is marked by an icon that looks like a triangle 
of little squares (Fig. 14.29).
You can set a module to be the top-level module by right clicking on it in the 
Hierarchy View and selecting the option “Set as Top Module.”

924    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You also need an implementation constraints file that associates SW1 on the Elbert 
V2 with CLK and the segments of the LED with the SEG bus.
The pinouts associated with the 7-segment display are shown in Fig. 14.30 and the 
constraints file that you will need to create is listed below.
NET “CLK” CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE;
# Push buttons
NET “CLK” LOC = P80;   # SW1
NET “CLK” PULLUP;
# 7-segments
NET “SEG[7]” LOC = P117;
NET “SEG[6]” LOC = P116;
NET “SEG[5]” LOC = P115;
NET “SEG[4]” LOC = P113;
NET “SEG[3]” LOC = P112;
NET “SEG[2]” LOC = P111;
NET “SEG[1]” LOC = P110;
NET “SEG[0]” LOC = P114;
Build the project and install it on your Elbert and you should see all three digits 
counting as one when you press SW1. All three digits are counting, because we are 
not controlling the common anodes of the display digits. This is something you will 
remedy in the next example.
14.9.2  Multiplexed 7-Segment Counter Example
This example makes the three-digit 7-segment display of the Elbert V2 count upward 
from 0 to 999 incrementing the three digit number displayed once per second.
The three-digit 7-segment LED display on the Elbert V2 is multiplexed. Referring 
back to Fig. 14.30, you can see that three PNP transistors are used to enable the three 
FIGURE 14.29  The Hierarchy View indicating the top-level 
module.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    925
anodes of the display and the cathode connections to the segments for the three 
displays are controlled by eight FPGA output pins (one for the decimal point). See 
the section “Multiplexed LED Displays” in Chap. 12 for background information on 
multiplexing LED displays.
To display a different number on each digit, it is necessary to fool the eye by 
turning one digit on (and the others off), setting the segment pattern to the number 
you want for that digit, then turning that digit off and enabling the next digit, resetting 
the segment pattern and so on.
In this example you will reuse the “segment_decoder” module that you created 
earlier and also create two new modules. The modules used in the project, which is 
called “seconds_counter,” are:
• second_counter.v: The top-level module
• multiplexed_7_seg_display.v: The multiplexed display driver logic
• decoder_7_segment.v: The decimal digit to 7 segment decoder
Starting at the bottom of the modules, the “decoder_7_segment” module is exactly 
as described in Sec. 14.9.1.
The “multiplexed_7_seg_display” module makes use of the decoder_7_segment 
module.
module multiplexed_7_seg_display(
    input CLK,
    input [3:0] units, tens, hundreds,
    output [7:0] SEG,
    output reg [2:0] DIGIT
    );
reg [3:0] digit_data;
reg [2:0] digit_posn;
reg [23:0] prescaler;

end

end

end

begin
  
 
digit_posn<= 0;
  
 
DIGIT <= 3’b111;
  
end 
 end
end
endmodule
The module has a clock input (CLK) that will be used to control the switching 
between one digit and another. CLK will be connected to the 12-MHz clock that the 
Elbert V2 provides on pin P129.
There are also three 4-bit inputs—“units,” “tens,” and “hundreds”—that will con-
tain the three digits to be displayed. Note how these three inputs can just follow the 
initial input declaration without the need to repeat the bus size for each of the inputs.
The two outputs of this module are the segment driver pins (SEG) and the digit 
driver pins (DIGIT).
Three registers are needed for the mechanics of the multiplexing:
• digit_data: Provides the link to the data input to the 7-segment decoder.
• digit_posn: Digit position; this cycles round from 0 to 2 to indicate which of the 
three digits is active during the refresh cycle.
• Prescaler: This counter is used to divide the 12-MHz clock down to a 100-Hz 
refresh clock signal.
An instance of the 7-segment decoder is created with the line:
decoder_7_seg decoder(.SEG (SEG), .D (digit_data));

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    927
This passes through the segment pins SEG from this module to the 7-segment 
decoder and links the digit_data register to the D input of the 7-segment decoder.
The “always” block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and pre-scales the 
12-MHz clock by using the “if” to only actually do something when the prescaler gets 
to 12000 (decimal). When this happens, the prescaler is reset and then the business of 
refreshing the next digit of the display takes place.
This involves first incrementing the digit_posn register and then using a series of 
“if” statements to set the digit_data to either “units,” “tens,” or “hundreds” depend-
ing on the digit position. The DIGIT control pins are also set for the digit currently 
being displayed. Note that the digit control is active low.
The top-level module (seconds_counter) has one input (CLK) that uses the same 
12-MHz clock as the multiplexed_7_seg_display module. The two outputs SEG and 
DIGIT will be linked to the FPGA pins that drive the segments and digits on the 
Elbert V2 multiplexed display.
module second_counter(
    input CLK,
    output [7:0] SEG,
    output [2:0] DIGIT
    );
reg [3:0] units, tens, hundreds;
reg [23:0] prescaler;
multiplexed_7_seg_display display(.CLK (CLK),
  
.units (units), .tens (tens), .hundreds (hundreds),

end
  
if (hundreds == 9)
  
begin
  
 
hundreds<= 0;
  
end
 end
end
endmodule

928    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
This module uses three registers to contain the units, tens and hundreds digits as 
well as a prescaler to divide the 12-MHz clock signal down to 1 Hz.
The “always” block is sensitive to the positive edge of CLK and divides the clock 
by 12,000,000 (decimal) to tick over the units, tens and hundreds registers. Once the 
units register has reached 9, it increments then tens register and then resets to 0.
If you want to try out this example and install it on the Elbert V2, load the project 
“seconds_counter” from the book downloads, build it and deploy it.
14.9.3  Parameterized Modules 
Some modules like the ripple_counter module, that you created earlier, would benefit 
from parameterization. That is instead of always being the same size, it would be able 
to specify their size when instantiating them.
As an example of using parameters you can modify the ripple_counter module 
that you created earlier. The modified code is shown below:
module ripple_counter#(parameter SIZE=4) (
    input CLK,
    input CLR,
    output reg [SIZE-1:0] Q
    );
always @(posedge CLK, posedge CLR)
begin
 if (CLR)
  
Q <= 0;
 else if (CLK)
  
Q <= Q + 1;
end
endmodule
The addition of the size parameter is shown in bold. After the parameter name 
(SIZE) a default value is specified, so that if the parameter is not specified when the 
module is instantiated, then it will still have a size.
The parameter can then be used anywhere within the module, so in this case, the 
MSB of the Q output register is set to be SIZE-1.
When it comes to instantiating a parameterized module, you can specify the 
parameter like this:
ripple_counter#(4) counter(.Q (data), .CLK (CLK), .CLR (clear));
14.10  Simulation
A board like the Elbert 2 allows you to test out your designs using its switches and 
LEDs to exercise the FPGA and see how it is behaving. You could also use the Elbert’s 
GPIO pins and test the design using a logic analyzer. 

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    929
However, ISE includes a simulator that allows you to write a Verilog test fixture 
and then use it to exercise a module and make sure that its doing what it should, 
before going anywhere near real hardware.
As an example you can add a text fixture to the Verilog ripple counter project that 
you created earlier.
To do this, re-open the project ripple_counter_project and then add a new source 
to it. But, this time, when the New Source wizard opens, select the source type of 
Verilog Test Fixture and name it “counter_tester” (Fig. 14.31).
FIGURE 14.31  Creating a new test fixture.
Change the contents of counter_tester.v so that it appears as below:
module counter_tester;
// Inputs
reg CLK;
reg CLR;
// Outputs
wire [3:0] Q;
// Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
ripple_counteruut (
 .CLK(CLK), 
 .CLR(CLR), 
 .Q(Q)
);
initial
begin
 // Initialize Inputs
 CLK = 0;
 CLR = 0;

930    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
 // Wait 100 ns for global reset to finish
 #100;
end
always
begin
 #10 
 CLK =!CLK;
end
always
begin
 #320
 CLR = 1;
 #1
 CLR = 0;
end
endmodule
The new source wizard creates a lot of the code 
for us. This includes some code to create an instance 
of the module to be tested, which is given the name 
“uut” (unit under test).
The new parts are highlighted in bold.
The “initial” block is run just once as the FPGA 
resets and just sets both CLK and CLR low. The line 
#100 instructs the test code to delay for 100 ns, to 
allow everything to stabilize.
There are then two “always” blocks. The first 
drives the CLK pin by first delaying for 10 ns then 
inverting CLK.
The second block drives the CLR pin on a much 
slower clock. It delays for 320 ns then provides a 
1-ns pulse on the CLR pin.
To run the test fixture, click on the Simulation 
radio button in the Hierarchy View (Fig. 14.32). 
Notice that when you select “counter_tester” in 
the Hierarchy View, the process “Simulate Behavioral 
Model” appears in the Processes area of the window. 
Right-click on “Simulate Behavioral Model” and run 
it. This will result in the ISim module opening and 
displaying the results of the simulation (Fig. 14.33).
To see the detail, you need to click on Q[3:0] in 
the name column so that the individual lines of the 
bus are expanded. You will also need to click on the 
zoom-out icon about 10 times to get to the right time 
FIGURE 14.32  Running the test fixture.

Chapter 14: Programmable Logic    931
scale and then use the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of the simulation area to pan 
over to an interesting area of the simulation results.
14.11  VHDL
Verilog is not the only HDL. The FPGA community is almost evenly split between 
Verilog and VHDL. In fact, ISE can use both Verilog and VHDL source code and you 
can even mix them in a project.
VHDL tends to be more popular in some industry sectors such as aerospace and 
defence, as it has what programmers call “strong typing” that makes the code more 
rigorous and allows you to catch more potential problems at the time the project is 
being built rather than during simulation.
Most software programmers will tell you that once you have programmed in one 
language, learning a second is much easier to learn as you can just map things you 
have learnt in the new language to construct in the language you already know. The 
basic concepts are the same in both.
FIGURE 14.33  Simulation results for the counter.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining things to do with electronics is make some 
mechanical device move. Three very popular devices used to “make things move” 
include dc motors, RC servos, and stepper motors.
Motors
CHAPTER 15
15.1  DC Continuous Motors
A dc motor is a simple two- lead, electrically controlled device that comes with a rotary 
shaft on which wheels, gears, propellers, etc., can be mounted. A dc motor generates 
a considerable amount of revolutions per minute (rpm) for its size and can be made 
to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise by reversing the polarity applied to the leads. 
At low speeds, dc motors provide little torque and minimal position control, making 
them impractical for pointlike position- control applications.
Generally, dc motors are available in many different shapes and sizes. Most dc motors 
provide rotational speeds anywhere between 3000 and 8000 rpm at a specific operating 
voltage typically set between 1.5 and 24 V. The operating voltage provided by the manu-
facturer tells you at what voltage the motor runs most efficiently. Now, the actual voltage 
applied to a motor can be made slightly lower to make the motor slower or can be ele-
vated to make the motor faster. However, when the applied voltage drops to below

around 50 percent of the specified operating voltage, the motor usually will cease to 
rotate. Conversely, if the applied voltage exceeds the operating voltage by around 
30 percent, there is a chance that the motor will overheat and become damaged. In 
practice, as you will see in a second, the speed of a dc motor is most efficiently con-
trolled by means of pulse- width modulation, whereby the motor is rapidly turned 
on and off. The width of the applied pulse, as well as the period between pulses, 
controls the speed of the motor. Also, it is worth noting that a freely running motor 
(no load) may draw little current (power). However, if a load is applied, the amount 
of current drawn by the motor’s inner coils goes up immensely (up to 1000 percent or 
more). Manufacturers usually will provide what is called a stall current rating for their 
motors. This rating specifies the amount of current drawn at the moment the motor 
stalls. If your motor’s stall current rating is not listed, it is possible to determine it 
by using an ammeter; slowly apply a force to the motor’s shaft, and note the current 
level at the point when the motor stalls. Another specification given to dc motors is 
a torque rating. This rating represents the amount of force the motor can exert on a 
load. A motor with a high torque rating will exert a larger force on a load placed at a 
tangent to its rotational arm than a motor with a lower torque rating. The torque rat-
ing of a motor is usually given in lb/ft, g/cm, or oz/in.

A seemingly obvious approach to control the speed of a dc motor would be 
simply to limit the current flow by using a potentiometer, as shown in the 
circuit to the left in the figure. According to Ohm’s law, as the resistance 
of the pot increases, the current decreases, and the motor will slow down. 
However, using a pot to control the current flow is inefficient. As the pot’s 
resistance increases, the amount of current energy that must be converted 
into heat increases. Producing heat in order to slow a motor down is not 
good—it consumes supply power and may lead to potentiometer melt-
down. Another seemingly good but inefficient approach to control the 
speed of a motor is to use a transistor amplifier arrangement like the one 
shown to the right in the figure. However, again, there is a problem. As the 
collector- to- emitter resistance increases with varying base voltage/current, 
the transistor must dissipate a considerable amount of heat. This can lead 
to transistor meltdown.

UJT/SCR Control Circuit
In order to conserve energy and prevent component meltdown, an approach 
similar to what was used in switching power supplies is used to control 
the speed of the motor. This approach involves sending the motor short 
pulses of current. By varying the width and frequency of the applied pulses, 
the speed of the motor can be controlled. Controlling a motor’s speed in 
this manner prevents any components from experiencing continuous cur-
rent stress. Figure 13.3 shows three simple circuits used to provide the 
desired motor- control pulses.
In the first circuit, a UJT relaxation oscillator generates a series of pulses 
that drives an SCR on and off. To vary the speed of the motor, the UJT’s 
oscillatory frequency is adjusted by changing the RC time constant.

Chapter 15: Motors    935
15.3  Directional Control of DC Motors
To control the direction of a motor, the polarity applied to the motor’s leads must be 
reversed. A simple manual- control approach is to use a DPDT switch (see leftmost circuit 
in Fig. 15.4). Alternately, a transistor- driven DPDT relay can be used (see middle circuit). 
If you do not like relays, you can use a push- pull transistor circuit (see leftmost circuit). 
This circuit uses a complementary pair of transistors (similar betas and power rating)—
one is an npn power Darlington, and the other is a pnp power Darlington. When a high 
voltage (e.g., +5 V) is applied to the input, the upper transistor (npn) conducts, allowing 
current to pass from the positive supply through the motor and into ground. If a low 
voltage (0 V) is applied to the input, the lower transistor (pnp) conducts, allowing cur-
rent to pass through the motor from ground into the negative supply terminal.
In the second circuit, a pair of NAND gates 
make up the relaxation oscillator section, while 
an enhancement- type power MOSFET is used 
to drive the motor. Like the preceding circuit, 
the speed of the motor is controlled by the  
oscillator’s RC time constant. Notice that if 
one of the input leads of the left NAND gate is 
pulled out, it is possible to create an extra termi-
nal that can be used to provide on/off controls 
that can be interfaced with CMOS logic circuits.
The third circuit is a 555 timer that is used to 
generate pulses that drive a power MOSFET. 
By inserting a diode between pins 7 and 6, as 
shown, the 555 is placed into low- duty cycle 
operation. R1, R2, and C set the frequency and 
on/off duration of the output pulses. The for-
mulas accompanying the diagram provide the 
details.
A microcontroller-based dc control circuit 
with speed control is found in Chap. 13.
In many applications the 555 timer in this  
final circuit can be replaced by a microcontroller 
with a PWM output driving the MOSFET.

555 Timer/MOSFET Control Circuit

936    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Another very popular circuit used to control the direction of a motor (as well as the 
speed) is the H- bridge. Figure 15.5 shows two simple versions of the H- bridge circuit. 
The left H- bridge circuit is constructed with bipolar transistors, whereas the right  
H- bridge circuit is constructed from MOSFETs. To make the motor rotate in the for-
ward direction, a high (+5- V) signal is applied to the forward input, while no signal is 
applied to the reverse input (applying a voltage to both inputs at the same time is not 
allowed). The speed of the motor is controlled by pulse- width modulating the input 
signal. Here is a description of how the bipolar H- bridge works: When a high voltage 
is applied to Q3’s base, Q3 conducts, which in turn allows the pnp transistor Q2 to con-
duct. Current then flows from the positive supply terminal through the motor in the 
right- to- left direction (call it the forward direction if you like). To reverse the motor’s 
direction, the high voltage signal is removed from Q3’s base and placed on Q4’s base. 
This sets Q4 and Q1 into conduction, allowing current to pass through the motor in the 
opposite direction. The MOSFET H- bridge works in a similar manner. 
FIGURE 15.5
Now, it is possible to construct these H- bridge circuits from scratch, but it is 
far easier and usually cheaper to buy a motor- driven IC. For example, National 
Semiconductor’s LMD18200 motor- driver IC is a high- current, easy- to- use H- bridge 
chip that has a rating of 3 A and 12 to 55 V. This chip is TTL and CMOS compat-
ible and includes clamping diodes, shorted load protection, and a thermal warning 
interrupt output lead. The L293D (Unitrode) is another popular motor- driver IC. This 
chip is very easy to use and is cheaper than the LMD18200, but it cannot handle as 
much current and does not provide as many additional features. There are many 
other motor- driver ICs out there, as well as a number of prefab motor- diver boards 
that are capable of driving a number of motors. Check the electronics catalogs and 
Internet to see what is available.

pulse- width- modulated (PWM) signal to control the position of its shaft to within a 
small fraction of its maximum range of rotation. To alter the position of the shaft, the 
pulse width of the modulated signal is varied. The amount of angular rotation of an RC 
servo’s shaft is limited to around 180 or 210° depending on the specific brand of servo. 
These devices can provide a significant amount of low- speed torque (due to an internal 
gearing system) and provide moderate full- swing displacement switching speeds. RC 
servos frequently are used to control steering in model cars, boats, and airplanes. They 
are also used commonly in robotics as well as in many sensor- positioning applications.
The standard RC servo looks like a simple box with a drive shaft and three wires 
coming out of it. The three wires consist of a power supply wire (usually black), a 
ground wire (usually red), and the shaft- positioning control wire (color varies based 
on manufacturer). Within the box there is a dc motor, a feedback device, and a con-
trol circuit. The feedback device usually consists of a potentiometer whose control 
dial is mechanically linked to the motor through a series of gears. When the motor 
is rotated, the potentiometer’s control dial is rotated. The shaft of the motor is usu-
ally limited to a rotation of 180° (or 210°)—a result of the pot not being able to rotate 
indefinitely. The potentiometer acts as a position- monitoring device that tells the con-
trol circuit (by means of its resistance) exactly how far the shaft has been rotated. The 
control circuit uses this resistance, along with a pulse- width- modulated input control 
signal, to drive the motor a specific number of degrees and then hold. (The amount of 
holding torque varies from servo to servo.) The width of the input signal determines 
how far the servo’s shaft will be rotated.
FIGURE 15.6
By convention, when the pulse width is set to 1.5 ms, the servo rotates its shaft to 
neutral position (e.g., 90° if the servo is constrained within a 0 to 180° range). To rotate 
the shaft a certain number of degrees from neutral position, the pulse width of the 
control signal is varied. To make the shaft go counterclockwise from neutral, a pulse 
wider than 1.5 ms is applied to the control input. Conversely, to make the shaft go 
clockwise from neutral, a pulse narrower than 1.5 ms is applied (see Fig. 15.6). Knowing 
exactly how much wider or narrower to make the pulse to achieve exact angular dis-
placements depends largely on what brand of servo you are using. For example, one 
brand of servo may provide maximum counterclockwise rotation at 1 ms and maxi-
mum clockwise rotation at 2 ms, whereas another brand of servo may provide maxi-
mum counterclockwise rotation at 1.25 ms and maximum clockwise rotation at 
1.75 ms. The supply voltage used to power servos is commonly 4.8 V but may be 6.0 V

or so depending on the specific brand of servo. Unlike the supply voltage, the supply 
current drawn by a servo varies greatly, depending on servo’s power output.
A simple 555 timer circuit like the one shown in Fig. 15.6 can be used to gener-
ate the servo control signal. In this circuit, R2 acts as the pulse- width control. Servos 
also can be controlled by a microprocessor or microcontroller. See Chap. 13 for two 
microcontroller-based servo control circuits.
Now, when controlling servos within model airplanes, an initial control signal 
(generated by varying position- control potentiometers) is first sent to a radiowave 
modulator circuit that encodes the control signal within a carrier wave. This carrier 
wave is then radiated off as a radiowave by an antenna. The radiowave, in turn, is 
then transmitted to the model’s receiver circuit. The receiver circuit recovers the initial 
control signal by demodulating the carrier. After that, the control signal is sent to the 
designated servo within the model. If there is more than one servo per model, more 
channels are required. For example, most RC airplanes require a four- channel radio 
set; one channel is used to control the ailerons, another channel controls the elevator, 
another controls the rudder, and another controls the throttle. More complex models 
may use five or six channels to control additional features such as flaps and retractable 
landing gear. The FCC sets aside 50 frequencies in the 72- MHz band (channels 11–60) 
dedicated to aircraft use only. No license is needed to operate these radios. However, 
with an amateur (ham) radio operator’s license, it is possible to use a radio within 
the 50- MHz band. Also, there are frequencies set aside within the 27- MHz band that 
are legal for any kind of model use (surface or air). If you are interested in radio- 
controlled RC servos, a good starting point is to check out an RC model hobby shop. 
These shops carry a number of transmitter and receiver sets, along with the servos.
As a final note, with a bit of rewiring, a servo can be converted into a drive motor 
with unconstrained rotation. A simple way to modify the servo is to break the feed-
back loop. This involves removing the three- lead potentiometer (and unlinking the 
gear system so that it can rotate 360°) and replacing it with a pair of voltage- divider 
resistors (the output of the voltage divider replaces the variable terminal of the 
potentiometer). The voltage divider is used to convince the servo control circuit that 
the servo is in neutral position. The exact values of the resistors needed to set the 
servo in neutral position can be determined by using the old potentiometer and an 
ohmmeter. Now, to turn the motor clockwise, a pulse wider than 1.5 ms is applied to 
the control input. As long as the control signal is in place, the motor will keep turning 
and not stop—you have removed the feedback system. To turn the motor counter-
clockwise, a pulse narrower than 1.5 ms is applied to the control input.
15.5  Stepper Motors
Stepper motors, or steppers, are digitally controlled brushless motors that rotate a 
specific number of degrees (a step) every time a clock pulse is applied to a special 
translator circuit that is used to control the stepper. The number of degrees per step 
(resolution) for a given stepper motor can be as small as 0.72° per step or as large as 
90° per step. Common general- purpose stepper resolutions are 15 and 30° per step. 
Unlike RC servos, steppers can rotate a full 360° and can be made to rotate in a con-
tinuous manner like a dc motor (but with a lower maximum speed) with the help of 
proper digital control circuitry. Unlike dc motors, steppers provide a large amount 

Chapter 15: Motors    939
of torque at low speeds, making them suitable in applications where low- speed and 
high- precision position control is needed. For example, they are used in printers to 
control paper feed and are used to help a telescope track stars. Steppers are also 
found in plotter- and sensor- positioning applications. The list goes on. To give you a 
basic idea of how a stepper works, take a look at Fig. 15.7.
Here is a simple model depicting a 15ç per step variable- reluctance step-
per. The stationary section of the motor, called the stator, has eight poles 
that are spaced 45ç apart. The moving section of the motor, called the 
rotor, is made from a ferromagnetic material (a material that is attracted 
to magnetic fields) that has six teeth spaced 60ç apart. To make the rotor 
turn one step, current is applied, at the same time, through two opposing 
pole pairs, or coil pairs. The applied current causes the opposing pair 
of poles to become magnetized. This in turn causes the rotor’s teeth to 
align with the poles, as shown in the figure. To make the rotor rotate 15° 
clockwise from this position, the current through coil pair 1 is removed 
and sent through coil pair 2. To make the rotor rotate another 15° clock-
wise from this position, the current is removed from coil pair 2 and sent 
through coil pair 3. The process continues in this way. To make the rotor 
spin counterclockwise, the coil- pair firing sequence is reversed.
15.6  Kinds of Stepper Motors
The model used in the last example was based on a variable- reluctance stepper. As it 
turns out, this model is incomplete—it does not show how a real variable- reluctance 
stepper is wired internally. Also, the model does not apply to a class of steppers 
referred to as permanent- magnet steppers. To make things more realistic, let’s take a 
look at some real- life steppers.

940    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Variable- Reluctance Steppers
Figure 15.8 shows a physical model and schematic diagram of a 30° per step variable- 
reluctance stepper. This stepper consists of a six- pole (or three- coil pair) stator and a 
four- toothed ferromagnetic rotor. Variable- reluctance steppers with higher angular 
resolutions are constructed with more coil pairs and/or more rotor teeth. Notice that 
in both the physical model and the schematic, the ends of all the coil pairs are joined 
together at a common point. (This joining of the coil ends occurs internally within the 
motor’s case.) The common and the coil pair free ends are brought out as wires from 
the motor’s case. These wires are referred to as the phase wires. The common wire is 
connected to the supply voltage, whereas the phase wires are grounded in sequence 
according to the table shown in Fig. 15.8.
Permanent- Magnet Steppers (Unipolar, Bipolar, Universal)
UNIPOLAR STEPPERS
These steppers have a similar stator arrangement as the variable- reluctance steppers, 
but they use a permanent- magnet rotor and different internal wiring arrangements. 
Figure 15.8 shows a 30° per step unipolar stepper. It consists of a four- pole (or two- 
coil pair) stator with center taps between coil pairs and a six- toothed permanent- 
magnetic rotor. The center taps may be wired internally and brought out as one wire 
or may be brought out separately as two wires. The center taps typically are wired to 
the positive supply voltage, whereas the two free ends of a coil pair are alternately 
grounded to reverse the direction of the field provided by that winding. As shown 
in the figure, when current flows from the center tap of winding 1 out terminal 1a, 
the top stator pole “goes north,” while the bottom stator pole “goes south.” This 
causes the rotor to snap into position. If the current through winding 1 is removed, 
sent through winding 2, and out terminal 2a, the horizontal poles will become ener-
gized, causing the rotor to turn 30°, or one step. In Fig. 15.8, three firing sequences

are shown. The first sequence provides full stepping action (what we just discussed). 
The second sequence, referred to as the power stepping sequence, provides full step-
ping action with 1.4 times the torque but twice the power consumption. The third 
sequence provides half stepping (e.g., 15° instead of the rated 30°). Half stepping 
is made possible by energizing adjacent poles at the same time. This pulls the rotor 
in- between the poles, thus resulting in one- half the stepping angle. As a final note, 
unipolar steppers with higher angular resolutions are constructed with more rotor 
teeth. Also, unipolars come in either five- or six- wire types. The five- wire type has the 
center taps joined internally, while the six- wire type does not.
BIPOLAR STEPPERS
These steppers resemble unipolar steppers, but their coil pairs do not have center 
taps. This means that instead of simply supplying a fixed supply voltage to a lead, as 
was the case in unipolar steppers (supply voltage was fixed to center taps), the sup-
ply voltage must be alternately applied to different coil ends. At the same time, the 
opposite end of a coil pair must be set to the opposite polarity (ground). For example, 
in Fig. 15.8, a 30° per step bipolar stepper is made to rotate by applying the polarities 
shown in the firing sequence table to the leads of the stepper. Notice that the firing 
sequence uses the same basic drive pattern as the unipolar stepper, but the “0” and “1” 
signals are replaced with “+” and “−” symbols to show that the polarity matters. As 
you will see in the next section, the circuitry used to drive a bipolar stepper requires an  
H- bridge network for every coil pair. Bipolar steppers are more difficult to con-
trol than both unipolar steppers and variable- reluctance steppers, but their unique  
polarity- shifting feature gives them a better size- to- torque ratio. As a final note, 
bi polar steppers with higher angular resolutions are constructed with more rotor 
teeth.
UNIVERSAL STEPPERS
These steppers represent a type of unipolar- bipolar hybrid. A universal stepper comes 
with four independent windings and eight leads. By connecting the coil windings in 
parallel, as shown in Fig. 15.8, the universal stepper can be converted into a unipolar 
stepper. If the coil windings are connected in series, the stepper can be converted into 
a bipolar stepper.
15.7  Driving Stepper Motors
Every stepper motor needs a driver circuit that can control the current flow sent 
through the coils within the stepper’s stator. The driver, in turn, must be controlled 
by a logic circuit referred to as a translator. We will discuss translator circuits after we 
have covered the driver circuits.
Figure 15.9 shows driver networks for a variable- reluctance stepper and for a uni-
polar stepper. Both drivers use transistors to control current flow through the motor’s 
individual windings. In both driver networks, input buffer stages are added to pro-
tect the translator circuit from the motor’s supply voltage in the event of transistor 
collector- to- base breakdown. Diodes are added to both drivers to protect the tran-
sistors and power supply from inductive kickback generated by the motor’s coils. 
(Notice that the unipolar driver uses extra diodes because inductive kickback can 

942    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
leak out on either side of the center tap. As you will see in a moment, a pair of diodes 
within this driver can be replaced with a single diode, keeping the diode count to 
four.) The single driver section shown in Fig. 15.9 provides a general idea of what 
kinds of components can be used within the driver networks. This circuit uses a high- 
power Darlington transistor, a TTL buffer, and a reasonably fast protection diode 
(the extra diode should be included in the unipolar circuit). If you do not want to 
bother with discrete components, transistor- array ICs, such as the ULN200x series by 
Allegro Microsystems or the DS200x series by National Semiconductor, can be used 
to construct the driver section. The ULN2003, shown in Fig. 15.9, is a TTL- compatible 
chip that contains seven Darlington transistors with protection diodes included. The 
7407 buffer IC can be used with the ULN2003 to construct a full- stepper driver. Other 
ICs, such as Motorola’s MC1414 Darlington array IC, can drive multiple motor wind-
ing directly from logic inputs.
FIGURE 15.9
The circuitry used to drive a bipolar stepper requires the use of an H- bridge cir-
cuit. The H- bridge circuit acts to reverse the polarity applied across a given coil pair 
within the stepper. (Refer back to the section on dc direction control for details on how 
H- bridges work.) For each coil pair within a stepper, a separate H- bridge is needed. 
The H- bridge circuit shown in Fig. 15.10 uses four power Darlington transistors that 
are protected from the coil’s inductive kickback by diodes. An XOR logic circuit is

added to the input to prevent two high (1’s) signals from being applied to the inputs 
at the same time. [If two high signals are placed at both inputs (assuming that there 
is no logic circuit present), the supply will short to ground. This is not good for the 
supply.] The table in Fig. 15.10 provides the proper firing sequence needed to create 
the desired polarities.

As mentioned in the dc motor section of this chapter, H- bridges can be pur-
chased in IC form. SGS Thompson’s L293 dual H- bridge IC is a popular choice for 
driving small bipolar steppers drawing up to 1 A per motor winding at up to 36 V. 
The L298 dual H- bridge is similar to the L293 but can handle up to 2 A per winding. 
National Semiconductor’s LMD18200 H- bridge IC can handle up to 3 A, and unlike 
the L293 and L298, it has protection diodes built in. More H- bridge ICs are available, 
so check the catalogs.
15.8  Controlling the Driver with a Translator
A translator is a circuit that enacts the sequencing pulses used to drive a driver. In 
some instances, the translator may simply be a computer or programmable interface 
controller, with software directly generating the outputs needed to control the driver 
leads. In most cases, the translator is a special IC that is designed to provide the 
proper firing sequences from its output leads when a clock signal is applied to one of 
its input leads; another input signal may control the direction of the firing sequence 
(the direction of the motor). There are a number of stepper translator ICs available 
that are easy to use and fairly inexpensive. Let’s take a look at one of these devices 
in a second. First, let’s take a look at some simple translator circuits that can be built 
from simple digital components.
A simple way to generate a four- phase drive pattern is to use a CMOS 4017 
decade counter/divider IC (or a 74194 TTL version). This device sequentially makes 
1 of 10 possible outputs high (others stay low) in response to clock pulses. Tying 
the fifth output (Q4) to ground makes the decade counter into a quad counter. To 
enact the drive sequence, a clock signal is applied to the clock input (see Fig. 15.11). 
Another four- phase translator circuit that provides power stepping control as well 
as direction control can be constructed with a CMOS 4027 dual JK flip- flop IC (or a 
7476 TTL version). The CMOS 4070 XOR logic (or 7486 TTL XOR logic) is used to set 
up directional control.

Figure 15.12 shows a circuit that contains the translator, driver, and stepper all in 
one. The motor, in this case, is a unipolar stepper, while the translator is a TTL 74194 
shift counter. The 555 timer provides clock signals to the 74194, while the DPDT switch 
acts to control the direction of the motor. The speed of the motor is dependent on the fre-
quency of the clock, which in turn is dependent on R1’s resistance. The translator in this 
circuit also can be used to control a variable reluctance stepper. Simply use the variable- 
reluctance driver from Fig. 15.9 and the firing sequence shown in Fig. 15.8 as your guides.
FIGURE 15.11
Perhaps the best translator circuits you can hope for come in integrated packages. 
A number of manufacturers produce stepper motor controller ICs that house both the 
translator and driver sections. These chips are fairly simple to use and inexpensive. 
A classic stepper controller chip is the Philips SAA1027. The SAA1027 is a bipolar IC 
that is designed to drive four- phase steppers. It consists of a bidirectional four- state 
counter and a code converter that are used to drive four outputs in sequence. This

chip has high- noise- immunity inputs, clockwise and counterclockwise capability, a 
reset control input, high output current, and output voltage protection. Its supply 
voltage runs from 9.5 to 18 V, and it accepts input voltages of 7.5 V minimum for 
high (1) and 4.5 V maximum for low (0). It has a maximum output current of 500 mA. 
Figure 15.13 will paint the rest of the picture.
As mentioned, the SAA1027 is a classic chip (old chip). Newer, better stepper 
control ICs are available from a number of manufacturers. If you are interested in 
learning more about these chips, try searching the Internet. You will find some useful 
websites that discuss stepper controller ICs in detail. Also, these websites often will 
provide links to manufacturers and distributors of stepper motors and controller ICs.
Count input C (pin 15)—A low- to- high transition at this pin causes the 
outputs to change states.
Mode input M (pin 3)—Controls the direction of the motor. See table 
to the left.
Reset input R (pin 2)—A low (0) at the R input resets the counter to 
zero. The outputs take on the levels shown in the upper and lower line 
of the table to the left.
External resistor RX (pin 4)—An external resistor connected to the RX 
terminal sets the base current of the transistor drivers. Its value is based 
on the required output current.
Outputs Q1 through Q4 (pins 6, 8, 9, 11)—Output terminals that are 
connected to the stepper motor.
FIGURE 15.13
An alternative to using a hardware translator is to use a microcontroller that gen-
erates the signals for the coil drivers. Microcontrollers and microcontroller boards 
such as the Arduino will have libraries of code that provide all the sequencing neces-
sary to drive a stepper motor.
15.9  A Final Word on Identifying Stepper Motors
When it comes to identifying the characteristics of an unknown stepper, the follow-
ing suggestions should help. The vast majority of the steppers on the market today 
are unipolar, bipolar, or universal types. Based on this, you can guess that if your 
stepper has four leads, it is most likely a bipolar stepper. If the stepper has five leads, 
then the motor is most likely a unipolar with common center taps. If the stepper

has six leads, it is probably a unipolar with separate center taps. A motor with eight 
leads would most likely be a universal stepper. (If you think your motor might be a  
variable- reluctance stepper, try spinning the shaft. If the shaft spins freely, the motor 
is most likely a variable- reluctance stepper. A coglike resistance indicates that the 
stepper is a permanent- magnet type.)
Once you have determined what kind of stepper you have, the next step is to 
determine which leads are which. A simple way to figure this out is to test the resis-
tance between various leads with an ohmmeter.
Decoding the leads of a bipolar stepper is easy. Simply use an ohmmeter to deter-
mine which wire pair yields a low resistance value. A low resistance indicates that 
the two wires are ends of the same winding. If the two wires are not part of the same 
winding, the resistance will be infinite. A universal stepper can be decoded using a 
similar approach. Decoding a six- wire unipolar stepper requires isolating two three- 
wire pairs. From there, you figure out which wire is the common center tap by notic-
ing which measured pair among the isolated three wires gives a unit R worth of 
resistance and which pair gives a unit of 2R worth of resistance (see Fig. 15.14). Now, 
decoding a five- wire unipolar (with common center tap) is a bit more tricky than the 
others because of the common, but hidden, center tap. To help decode this stepper, 
you can use the diagram and table shown in Fig. 15.14. (The dots within the table 
represent where the ohmmeter’s two probes are placed within the diagram.) With 
the table you isolate e (common tap wire) by noting when the ohmmeter gives a resis-
tance of R units. Next, you determine which of the two wires in your hand is actually 
e by testing one of the two with the rest of the wires. If you always get R, then you 
are holding e, but if you get 2R, you are not holding e. Once the e wire is determined, 
any more ohmmeter deducing does not work—at least in theory—because you will 
always get 2R. The best bet now is to connect the motor to the driver circuitry and 
see if the stepper steps. If it does not step, fiddle around with the wires until it does.

Audio electronics, in part, deals with converting sound signals into electrical signals. 
This conversion process typically is accomplished by means of a microphone. Once  
the sound is converted, what is done with the corresponding electrical signal is up to 
you. For example, you can amplify the signal, filter out certain frequencies from the 
signal, combine (mix) the signal with other signals, transform the signal into a digi-
tally encoded signal that can be stored in memory, modulate the signal for the pur-
pose of radiowave transmission, use the signal to trigger a switch (e.g., transistor or 
relay), etc.
Another aspect of audio electronics deals with generating sound signals from 
electrical signals. To convert electrical signals into sound signals, you can use a 
speaker. (If you are not interested in retaining frequency response—say, you are only 
interested in making a warning alarm—you can use an audible sound device such 
as a dc buzzer or compression washer.) The electrical signals used to drive a speaker 
may be sound- generated in origin or may be artificially generated by special oscilla-
tor circuits.
16.1  A Little Lecture on Sound
Before you start dealing with audio- related circuits, it is worthwhile reviewing some 
of the basic concepts of sound. Sound consists of three basic elements: frequency, 
intensity (loudness), and timbre (overtones).
The frequency of a sound corresponds to the vibrating frequency of the object 
that produced the sound. In terms of human physiology, the human ear can perceive 
frequencies from around 20 to 20,000 Hz; however, the ear is most sensitive to 
frequencies between 1000 and 2000 Hz.
The intensity of a sound corresponds to the amount of sound energy transported 
across a unit area per second (or W/m2) and depends on the amplitude of oscilla-
tion of the vibrating object. As you move further away from the vibrating object, the 
intensity drops in proportion to one over the distance squared. The human ear can 
perceive an incredible range of intensities, from 10−12 to 1 W/m2. Because this range 
Audio Electronics
CHAPTER 16

948    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
is so extensive, it is usually more convenient to use a logarithmic scale to describe 
intensity. For this purpose, decibels are used. When using decibels, sound intensity is  
defined as dB = 10 log10 (I/I0), where I is the measured intensity in watts per meter, 
and I0 = 10−12 W/m2 is defined as the smallest intensity that is perceived as sound 
by humans. In terms of decibels, the audio intensity range for humans is between  
0 and 120 dB. Figure 16.1 shows a number of sounds, along with their frequency and 
intensity ranges.
Tonal quality, or timbre, represents the complex wave pattern that is generated 
when the overtones of an instrument, voice, etc., are present along with the funda-
mental frequency. To demonstrate what overtones mean, consider a simple tuning 
fork that has a resonant frequency of 261.6 Hz (middle C). If you treat the fork as 
an ideal vibrator, when it is hit, it will vibrate off soundwaves with a frequency of 
261.6 Hz. In this case, you have no overtones—you only get one frequency. But now, 
if you play middle C on a violin, you get an intensely sounding 261.1 Hz, along 
with a number of other higher, typically less intense frequencies called overtones 
(or harmonics). The most intense frequency sounded is typically referred to as the 
fundamental frequency. The overtones of importance have frequencies that are integer 
multiples of the fundamental frequency (e.g., 2 × 261.1 Hz is the first harmonic, 
3 × 261.1 Hz is the second harmonic, and n × 261.1 Hz is the nth harmonic). It is the 
specific intensity of each overtone within the harmonic spectrum of an instrument, 
voice, etc., that is largely responsible for giving the instrument, voice, etc., its unique 
tonal quality. (The reason for an instrument’s unique set of overtones depends on 
the construction of the instrument.) Figure 16.2a shows a harmonic spectrum (spec-
tral plot) for an oboe that is tuned to middle C—the fundamental frequency.
In theory, you can create the sound from any type of instrument (e.g., violin, tuba, 
banjo, etc.) by examining the harmonic spectrum of that instrument. To illustrate how

this can be done, pretend that you have a number of ideal tuning forks. One fork 
represents the fundamental frequency; the other forks represent the various over-
tone frequencies. Using the harmonic spectrum of an instrument as a guide, you can 
mimic the sound of the instrument by varying the intensity of each “overtone fork.” 
(In reality, to accurately mimic an instrument, you also must consider rise and decay 
times of certain overtones—controlling the intensities of the overtones is not enough.) 
Mathematically, you can express a complex sound as the sum of all its overtones:
 
Signal = a sin ω0t + b cos ω0t + c sin 2ω0t + d cos 2ω0t + e sin 3ω0t + f cos ω0t + …
The coefficients a, b, c, d, etc., are the intensities of the overtones, and the fundamental 
frequency f0 = ω0/2π. This expression is referred to as a Fourier series. The coefficients 
must be calculated from the given waveform or the data from which it is plotted—
although an instrument called a harmonic analyzer can automatically compute the coef-
ficients. Figure 16.2b shows a complex sound made up of seven of its harmonics.
The art of synthesizing sounds via electric circuits is fairly complex business. To 
accurately mimic an instrumental sound, train whistle, bird chirp, etc., you must 
design circuits that can generate complex waveforms that contain all the overtones 
and decay and rise time information. For this purpose, special oscillator and modu-
lator circuits are needed.
16.2  Microphones
A microphone converts variations in sound pressure into corresponding variations 
in electric current. The amplitude of the ac voltage generated by a microphone is 
proportional to the intensity of the sound, while the frequency of the ac voltage cor-
responds to the frequency of the sound. (Note that if overtones are present within 
the sound signal, these overtones also will be present in the electrical signal.) Three 
commonly used microphones are listed next.

16.3  Microphone Specifications
A microphone’s sensitivity represents the ratio of electrical output (voltage) to the 
intensity of sound input. Sensitivity is often expressed in decibels with respect to a 
reference sound pressure of 1 dyn/cm2.
The frequency response of a microphone is a measure of the microphone’s ability 
to convert different acoustical frequencies into ac voltages. For speech, the frequency 
response of a microphone need only cover a range from around 100 to 3000 Hz. However, 
for hi- fi applications, the frequency response of the microphone must cover a wider 
range, from around 20 to 20,000 Hz.
This type of microphone consists of a plastic diaphragm, voice coil, 
and a permanent magnet. The diaphragm is connected to one end of the 
voice coil, while the other end of the coil is loosely supported around 
(or within) the magnet. When an alternating pressure is applied to the 
diaphragm, the voice coil alternates in response. Since the voice coil 
is accelerating through the magnet’s magnetic field, an induced volt-
age is set up across the leads of the voice coil.You can use this voltage 
to power a very small load, or you can use an amplifier to increase 
the strength of the signal so as to drive a larger load. Dynamic micro-
phones are extremely rugged, provide smooth and extended frequency 
response, do not require an external dc source to drive them, perform 
well over a wide range of temperatures, and have a low impedance 
output. Some dynamic microphones house internal transformers 
within their bodies, which give them the ability to have either a high- 
or low-impedance output—a switch is used to select between the two. 
Dynamic microphones are widely used in public address, hi-fi, and 
recording applications.
This type of microphone consists of a pair of charged plates that can be 
forced closer or further apart by variations in air pressure. In effect, the 
plates act like a sound-sensitive capacitor. One plate is made of a rigid 
metal that is fixed in place and grounded.The other plate is made of a 
flexible metal or metal-coiled plastic that is positively charged by means 
of an external voltage source. A very low-noise, high-impedance ampli-
fier is required to operate this type of microphone and to provide low 
output impedance. Condenser microphones offer crisp, low-noise sound 
and are used for high-quality sound recording.
An electret microphone is a variation of the condenser microphone.  
Instead of requiring an external voltage source to charge the diaphragm, 
it uses a permanently charged plastic element (electret) placed in par-
allel with a conductive metal backplate. Most electret microphones 
have a small FET amplifier built into their cases. This amplifier 
requires power to operate—typically a voltage between +1.5 and +10 V  
is needed. This voltage is fed into the microphone through a resistor 
(1–10 K) (see figure). Electret microphones used to suffer from poor 
performance, but modern designs can achieve results comparable to 
those of a condenser microphone.

Chapter 16: Audio Electronics    951
The directivity characteristic of a microphone refers to how well the microphone 
responds to sound coming from different directions. Omnidirectional microphones 
respond equally well in all directions, whereas directional microphones respond well 
only in specific directions.
The impedance of a microphone represents how much the microphone resists the flow 
of an ac signal. Low- impedance microphones are classified as having an impedance of 
less than 600 Ω. Medium- impedance microphones range from 600 to 10,000 Ω, whereas 
high- impedance microphones extend above 10,000 Ω. In modern audio systems, it is 
desirable to connect a lower- impedance microphone to a higher- impedance input device 
(e.g., 50- Ω microphone to 600- Ω mixer), but it is undesirable to connect a high- impedance 
microphone to a low- impedance input. In the first case, not much signal loss will occur, 
whereas in the second case, a significant amount of signal loss may occur. The standard 
rule of thumb is to allow the load impedance to be 10 times the source impedance. We’ll 
take a closer look at impedance matching later on in this chapter.
16.4  Audio Amplifiers
Electrical signals within audio circuits often require amplification to effectively drive 
other circuit elements or devices. Perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to amplify 
a signal is to use an op amp. General- purpose op amps such as the 741 will work fine 
for many noncritical audio applications, but they may cause distortion and other unde-
sirable effects when audio signals get complex. A better choice for audio applications 
is to use an audio op amp especially designed to handle audio signals. Audio ampli-
fiers have high slew rates, high gain- bandwidth products, high input impedances, 
low distortion, high voltage/power operation, and very low input noise. There are 
a number of good op amps produced by a number of different manufacturers. Some 
high- quality op amps worth mentioning include the AD842, AD847, AD845, AD797, 
NE5532, NE5534, NE5535, OP- 27, LT1115, LM833, OPA2604, OP249, HA5112, LM4562, 
OPA134, OPA2134, and LT1057.
16.4.1  Inverting Amplifier
The following two circuits act as inverting amplifiers. The gain for both circuits is 
determined by −R2/R1 (see Chap. 8 for the theory), while the input impedance is 
approximately equal to R1. The first op amp circuit uses a dual power supply, while 
the second op amp circuit uses a single power supply.
In both amplifier circuits, C1 acts as an ac coupling capacitor—it acts 
to pass ac signals while preventing unwanted dc signals from pass-
ing from the previous stage. Without C1, dc levels would be present at 
the op amp’s output, which in turn could lead to amplifier saturation 
and distortion as the ac portion of the input signal is amplified. C1 
also helps prevent low-frequency noise from reaching the amplifier’s 
input.

16.4.2  Noninverting Amplifier
The preceding inverting amplifier works fine for many applications, but its input 
impedance is not incredibly large. To achieve a larger input impedance (useful when 
bridging a high- impedance source to the input of an amplifier), you can use one of 
the following noninverting amplifiers in Fig. 16.7. The left amplifier circuit uses a 
dual power supply, whereas the right amplifier circuit uses a single power supply. 
The gain for both circuits is equal to R2/R1 + 1.
16.4.3  Digital Amplifiers
Digital power amplifiers are also known as class-D amplifiers or PWM amplifiers. 
They are extremely efficient and so run quite cool. This makes them ideal for very 
In the single-power-supply circuit, biasing 
resistors R3 and R4 are needed to prevent 
the amplifier from clipping during negative 
swings in the audio input signals. They act to 
give the op amp’s output a dc level on which 
the ac signal can safely fluctuate. Setting R3 = 
R4 sets the dc level of the op amp’s output to 
1/2 (+V). For reliable results, the biasing resis-
tors should have resistance values between 
10 and 100 k. Now, to prevent passing the 
dc level onto the next stage, C3 (ac coupling 
capacitor) must be included. Its value should  
be equal to 1/(2πfCRL), where RL is the load 
resistance, and fC is the cutoff frequency. RC 
acts as a filtering capacitor used to eliminate 
power-supply noise from reaching the op 
amp’s noninverting input. 
Notably, many audio op amps are especially 
designed for single-supply operation—they do 
not require biasing resistors.

high-power amplifiers of powers in the hundreds of watts or even the kilowatts 
range.
Figure 16.8 shows the block diagram for a class-D amplifier. The input signal is 
converted into a PWM signal by comparing it with a triangle wave. This is a very 
neat trick. As the triangle wave rises, at some point, it will become greater than the 
signal voltage. If the signal voltage is high, this will take longer; if the voltage is low, 
it will happen sooner. In this way, the pulse length produced will be proportional to 
the instantaneous input voltage.
Figure 16.9 shows the result of simulating the comparator with a triangle wave-
form of 10 kHz sampling a sine wave input signal at 1 kHz. The squarewave is the 
PWM output.

We have digitized our audio signal. It is now just on or off. So we can use that to

just the original signal in amplified form.
The quality of digital amplifiers can be very variable, but their efficiency makes 
them an attractive proposition. There are a number of ICs available that either encap-
sulate the whole amplifier in one device or provide outputs suitable for driving a 
complementary pair of MOSFETs. A couple devices to look at are the NCP2704 and 
LX1720.
16.4.4  Reducing Hum in Audio Amplifiers
If your project includes an audio amplifier that you are designing yourself, then 
you need to consider hum. Domestic power lines and devices will easily induce an 
annoying 60-Hz hum in an audio amplifier. Some of this signal can arrive through 
the amplifier’s power supply. Hence, design of power supplies for hi-fi amplifiers is 
almost as important as the designs for the amplifiers themselves. The main thing is to 
add as much smoothing capacitance to the power supply as possible.
Other 60-Hz signals will arrive in your audio amplifier circuit by mutual induc-
tion with wires and tracks on your PCB. You should make sure that you keep all PCB 
tracks and wires as short as possible. Wires should also be screened with the screen-
ing layer grounded.
16.5  Preamplifiers
In most audio applications, the term preamplifier refers to a control amplifier that is 
used to control features such as input selection, level control, gain, and impedance 
levels. Here are a few simple microphone preamplifier circuits to get you started.

is greater than ∼600 Ω.)

16.7  A Note on Impedance Matching
Is matching impedances between audio devices necessary? Not any more, at least 
when it comes to connecting a low- impedance source to a high- impedance load. In 
the era when vacuum- tube amplifiers were the standard, it was important to match 
impedances to achieve maximum power transfer between two devices. Impedance 
matching reduced the number of vacuum- tube amplifiers needed in circuit design 
(e.g., the number of vacuum- tube amplifiers needed along a telephone transmission 
line). However, with the advent of the transistor, more efficient amplifiers were cre-
ated. For these new amplifiers, what was important—and still is important—was 
maximum voltage transfer, not maximum power transfer. (Think of an op amp with 
its extremely high input impedance and low output impedance. To initiate a large- 
output- current response from an op amp, practically no input current is required into 
its input leads.) For maximum voltage transfer to occur, it was found that the destina-
tion device (called the load) should have an impedance of at least 10 times that of the 
sending device (called the source). This condition is referred to as bridging. (Without 
applying the bridging rule, if two audio devices with the same impedances are 
joined, you would see around 6 dB worth of attenuation loss in the transmitted sig-
nal.) Bridging is the most common circuit configuration used when connecting mod-
ern audio devices. It is also applied to most other electronic source- load connections, 
with the exception of certain radiofrequency circuits where matching impedance is 
usually desired and in cases where the signal being transmitted is a current rather 
than a voltage. If the transmitted signal is a current, the source impedance should be 
larger than the load impedance.
Now, if you consider a high- impedance source connected to a low- impedance 
load (e.g., a high- impedance microphone connected to a low- impedance mixer), 

956    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
voltage transfer can result in significant signal loss. The amount of signal loss in this 
case would be equal to

As a rule of thumb, a loss of 6 dB or less is acceptable for most applications.
16.8  Speakers
Speakers convert electrical signals into audible signals. The most popular speaker 
used today is the dynamic speaker. The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic 
principle as a dynamic microphone. When a fluctuating current is applied through a 
moving coil (voice coil) that surrounds a magnet (or that is surrounded by a magnet), 
the coil is forced back and forth. A large paper cone attached to the coil responds to 
the back- and- forth motion by “drumming off” sound waves.

FIGURE 16.12
Every speaker is given a nominal impedance Z that represents the average imped-
ance across its leads. (In reality, a speaker’s impedance varies slightly with fre-
quency, above and below the nominal level.) In terms of applications, you can treat 
the speaker like a simple resistive load of impedance Z. For example, if you attach an  
8- Ω speaker to an amplifier’s output, the amplifier will treat the speaker as an 
8- Ω load. The amount of current drawn from the amplifier will be I = Vout/Zspeaker. 
However, if you replace the 8- Ω speaker with a 4- Ω speaker, the current drawn from 
the amplifier will double.
Driving two 8- Ω speakers in parallel is equivalent to driving a 4- Ω speaker. 
Driving two 4- Ω speakers in parallel is equivalent to driving a 2- Ω speaker. By using 
high- power resistors, it is possible to change the overall impedance sensed by the 
amplifier. For example, by placing a 4- Ω resistor in series with a 4- Ω speaker, you can 
create a load impedance of 8 Ω. However, using a series resistor to increase the imped-
ance may hurt the sound quality. There are speaker- matching transformers that can 
change from 4 to 8 Ω, but a high- quality transformer like this can cost as much as a 
new speaker and can add slight frequency response and dynamic range errors.

Chapter 16: Audio Electronics    957
Another important characteristic of a speaker is its frequency response. The fre-
quency response represents the range over which a speaker can effectively vibrate off 
audio signals. Speakers that are designed to respond to low frequencies (typically 
less than 200 Hz) are referred to as woofers. Midrange speakers are designed to handle 
frequencies typically between 500 and around 3000 Hz. A tweeter is a special type of 
speaker (typically dome or horn type) that can handle frequencies above midrange. 
Some speakers are designed as full- range units that are capable of reproducing fre-
quencies from around 100 to 15,000 Hz. A full- range speaker’s sound quality tends 
to be inferior to a speaker system that incorporates a woofer, midrange, and tweeter 
speaker all together.
16.9  Crossover Networks
To design a decent speaker system, it would be best to incorporate a woofer, mid-
range speaker, and tweeter together so that you get good sound response over the 
entire audio spectrum (20 to 20,000 Hz). However, simply connecting these speakers 
in parallel will not work because each speaker will be receiving frequencies outside 
its natural frequency- response range. What you need is a filter network that can 
divert high- frequency signals to the tweeter, low- frequency signals to the woofer, 
and midrange- frequency signals to the midrange speaker. The filter network that is 
used for this sort of application is called a crossover network.
There are two types of crossovers: passive or active. Passive crossover networks 
consist of passive filter elements (e.g., capacitors, resistors, inductors) that are placed 
between the power amplifier and the speaker—they are placed inside the speaker 
cabinet. Passive crossover networks are cheap to make, easy to make foolproof, and 
can be tailored for a specific speaker. However, they are nonadjustable and always 
use up some amplifier power. Active crossover networks consist of a set of active 
filters (op amp filters) that are placed before the amplifier section. The fact that 
active crossover networks come before the power amplifier section makes it easier 
to manipulate the signal because the signal is still tiny (not amplified). Also, a single 
active crossover network can be used to control a number of different amplifier- 
speaker combinations at the same time. Since active crossover networks use active 
filters, the audio signal will not suffer as much attenuation loss as it would if it were 
applied through a passive crossover network.
Figure 16.13 shows a simple passive crossover network used to drive a three- 
speaker system. The graph shows typical frequency- response curves for each speaker. 
To produce an overall flat response from the system, you use a low- pass, bandpass, 
and high- pass filter. C1 and Rt form the low- pass filter, L1, C1, and Rm form the band-
pass filter, and L2 and Rw form the low- pass filter (Rt, Rm, and Rw are the nominal 
impedances of the tweeter, midrange, and woofer speakers).
To determine the component values needed to get the desired response, use the 
following: C1 = 1/(2πf2Rt), L1 = Rm/(2πf2), C2 = 1/(2πf1Rm), and L2 = Rw/2πf1, where 
f1 and f2 represent the 3- dB points shown in the graph. Usually, passive crossover 
networks are a bit more sophisticated than the one presented here. They often incor-
porate higher- order filters along with additional elements, such as an impedance 
compensation network, attenuation network, series notch filter, etc., all of which are 
used to achieve a flatter overall response.

958    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Here is a more practical passive crossover network (crossover frequency 1.8 kHz) 
used to drive a two- speaker system consisting of an 8- Ω tweeter and an 8- Ω woofer. 
An 18 × 12 × 8 in fiberboard box acts as a good resonant cavity for this system.

The LM386 audio amplifier is designed primarily for low-power applications. 
A +4- to +15-V supply voltage is used to power the IC. Unlike a traditional 
op amp, such as the 741, the 386’s gain is internally fixed to 20. However, it 
is possible to increase the gain to 200 by connecting a resistor-capacitor net-
work between pins 1 and 8. The 386’s inputs are referenced to ground, while 
internal circuitry automatically biases the output signal to one-half the supply 
voltage. This audio amplifier is designed to drive an 8-W speaker.

Electronics has changed over the past few years, and more and more people have an 
invention, but don’t necessarily want to learn degree-level electronics to make it a 
reality. Suppliers such as SparkFun, Seeed Studio, Pololu, and others support this by 
supplying modules and breakout boards that simplify the process of using complex 
devices. In addition, there are ICs for most of what you might want to do in electron-
ics, and these will greatly simplify your project build. Also, there are whole systems, 
such as Arduino (see Chap. 13), .NET Gadgeteer, and Netduino, that provide plug-
together modules for pretty much anything that you might want to build that has a 
microcontroller at its heart.
17.1  There’s an IC for It
Although plenty of useful, general-purpose ICs are available, there are also some 
very specialized devices. Before designing anything complex from discrete devices, 
you should always check that you are not reinventing the wheel. There may be an IC 
that you can use that will reduce the component count and cost of your project.
Table 17.1 lists some of the ICs that you may find useful for your projects. Some 
of them are general purpose; others fill a very narrow niche. This is not intended 
to be any exhaustive list, but rather to provide inspiration. We have not listed part 
URLs. You can find places to buy components using the Octopart parts search engine 
(http://www.octopart.com), where you will also be able to track down data sheets.
17.2  Breakout Boards and Modules
You do not always need to start your design from scratch. Many ready-made mod-
ules and breakout boards are available to inventors to incorporate into their designs.
The difference between a breakout board and a module is often a little blurred. 
The intention of a breakout board is that it simply “breaks out” the difficult-to-access 
pins of a surface-mounted device (SMD) IC into 0.1-in connections that are much 
easier to use. However, breakout boards often add a few extra components like a 
decoupling capacitor, voltage regulator, or level conversion. So the point at which a 
breakout board becomes a module is a bit arbitrary.

964    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
Whatever you chose to call them, breakout boards and modules can be very use-
ful in prototyping when you want to get something working to prove a concept using 
prebuilt modules, and then advance to a final design without the module.
There are many sensor modules (see Table 17.2), and some of these are covered in 
more detail in Chap. 6. Table 17.2 lists some of the more interesting modules that we 
have come across.
17.2.1  Radio Frequency Modules
Radio frequency (RF) electronics is a specialized part of electronics that is a discipline 
in its own right. At high frequencies, PCB layout becomes critical, and design is not as

RF modules
straightforward as with more typical analog and digital design. For this reason, you 
will often find ready-to-use RF modules that can either be soldered onto your own 
PCB as part of a bigger design or plugged into socket headers.
Figure 17.1 shows a variety of RF modules:
• A 433-MHz receiver and transmitter pair (A)
• A TEA5767 FM receiver board (B)
• A Bluetooth modem, which is actually one module on top of another, with the 
larger one providing level conversion (C)
• An XRF wireless serial module that fits a standard XBee socket (D) 
These represent just a small subset of the wide range of RF modules available to 
the inventor (see Table 17.2 for a more complete list). 
433-MHz and 315-MHz Modules
The 433-MHz and 315-MHz modules (Fig. 17.1A) are very low cost. They find their 
way into all sorts of consumer electronics requiring remote control, such as wireless 
door bells, remote car unlocking, smart meters, and remote-control toys.

Chapter 17: Modular Electronics    967
The data rates are generally low (8 kb/s is usually the top end, and 2 kb/s is quite 
common), but power consumption is also low. Their maximum range is normally 
about 100 yards, but can be much less indoors.
These modules are usually separate transmitters and receivers, rather than a com-
bined transceiver, and so they are generally used in situations where data is flowing 
in only one direction.
Bluetooth Modules
Bluetooth modules provide a great means of interfacing your electronics to a mobile 
phone. The module in Fig. 17.1C is actually a basic 3.3-V Bluetooth module designed 
to be surface mounted onto another board. In this case, it is mounted on a level 
changing board that allows the module to operate at 5-V TTL serial levels, but 3.3-V 
modules like this often find themselves incorporated into products. Again, econo-
mies of scale mean that these modules can be bought for just a few dollars if you 
look around.
XBee Modules
XBee is a proprietary standard of Digi International, but the sockets have been 
adopted for a range of radio link modules from many manufacturers. These mod-
ules, such as the XRF module from Ciseco Plc (see Fig. 17.2), act as a transparent serial 
interface between two devices. For example, one of the devices might be an Arduino 
with an XBee socket shield with an XRF module installed communicating with a low-
power remote sensor with an XBee socket and another XRF module, as shown on the 
left in Fig. 17.2. 
GSM/GPRS Modem Modules
The GSM/GPRS modem modules are essentially cellular phone modules that pro-
vide most of the features of a cellular phone, including sending Short Message Service 
(SMS) text messages and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)/General 
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) data. Serial commands are sent to the module from a 
microcontroller to control its operation.
17.2.2  Audio Modules
Although audio electronics is not as difficult as RF electronics, you still need to be 
careful to avoid earth loops and the dreaded 60-Hz hum that all too easily finds its 
way on to the signal path given half a chance.
FIGURE 17.2
XRF radio module and wireless temperature sensor module

968    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
You will find a good selection of audio amplifier modules such as the class D 
amplifier based on the XMA2012, which is a 2 × 3 W power amp IC (see Fig. 17.3).
This kind of module is very convenient, as it comes with screw terminals for 
power and speakers and a socket for audio input. Economies of scale make the cost 
of such modules low.
As well as power amp modules, you will also find audio modules for pre-amps, 
MP3 players, MIDI interfaces, and tone controls.
17.3  Plug-and-Play Prototyping 
When taken to its extreme, the modular approach can result in a system such as 
.NET Gadgeteer that allows complete plug-and-play development of a prototype 
(see Fig. 17.4). This system is based on attaching a wide range of sensors and other 
modules to a microcontroller main board using plug-in cables.
FIGURE 17.4
The .NET Gadgeteer system
FIGURE 17.3
Audio power amp module

Chapter 17: Modular Electronics    969
.NET Gadgeteer is programmed using Microsoft Visual Studio. When used 
with .NET Gadgeteer, this IDE includes a graphical editor that generates much 
of the boilerplate code, simply by connecting modules in the design window (see 
Fig. 17.5).
New modules for the .NET Gadgeteer are being developed all the time. The 
following are most of the modules available at the time of writing:
• Accelerometer
• Barometer
• Bluetooth
• Buttons
• Camera
• CAN (vehicle engine management unit)
• Cellular radio/GSM/GPRS modem
• Compass
• Current measurement (for smart meters and energy monitors)
• Display, touch screen LCD 
• GPS
• Gyroscope
• Joystick
• LED, multicolor
• Light sensor
• Moisture sensor

• Pulse oximeter (heart pulse rate measurement)
• Relay

The module manufacturers also supply main boards of different sizes and specifi-
cations. For up-to-date lists, see the websites of the main suppliers of .NET Gadgeteer 
hardware: GHI Electronics, Seeed Studio, Sytech Designs, and DFRobot. 
If you want to learn more about using .NET Gadgeteer, the book Getting Started 
with .NET Gadgeteer by Simon Monk (Make, 2012) is a good place to start.
17.4  Open Source Hardware
Open source software has been with us for many years now, but open source hard-
ware is a relatively new concept. The term open source really applies to the design 
files for the hardware, and means that the schematic and PCB design are made 
publicly available (usually in EAGLE CAD format). The implications of this are 
that anyone is free to take those design files and produce their own boards using 
the design. Often, the originator of a new piece of open source hardware will also 
manufacture the boards and sell them directly or through distributors. The origi-
nator will generally be known in the community, and these will be considered to 
be the “original” boards and therefore the most valuable. Copies and clones may 
appear if the design is successful, but the original boards are likely to remain the 
most used.
Perhaps the most successful open source hardware design is the Arduino (see 
Chap. 13). All the Arduino boards and most of the shields available for the Arduino 
are released under an open source or creative commons license. Other well-known 
open source hardware projects include the following:
• BeagleBoard A single-board computer
• MIDIbox MIDI music hardware
• Monome A button and LED grid for controlling virtual synthesizers
• Ultimaker, RepRap, and MakerBot 3D printer designs
• Chumby An embedded computer
• Open EEG A medical device
There are also many small modules that are released as open source designs.

Chapter 17: Modular Electronics    971
So, why would anyone want to give away their ideas for free for the world to use? 
Well, for one thing, many creative people make things for the fun of making them 
and not to get rich. There is a world of difference between having a good idea and 
building a business. If you want people to see and use what you have done, then why 
not release it into the wild? As with open source software, there are also opportuni-
ties for businesses to develop with the so called “halo effect,” providing consultation 
and support for the hardware.

A.1  Power Distribution
Figure A.1 shows a typical power-distribution system found in the United States 
(region in California). The voltages listed are sinusoidal and are represented by their 
rms values. Note that the system in your area may look a bit different from the system 
shown here. Contact your local utility to learn about how things are set up in your 
region.
As a note, ac is used in electrical distribution instead of dc because ac can be 
stepped up or down easily by using a transformer. Also, over long distances, it is 
more efficient to send electricity via high-voltage/low-current transmission lines. 
By reducing the current, less power is lost to resistive heating during transmission 
(lowering I within P = I2R lowers P). Once electricity reaches a substation, it must be 
stepped down to a safe level before entering homes and businesses.
Notice that industry typically uses three-phase electricity. The natural sequencing 
of the three phases is particularly useful for devices that perform rhythmic tasks. For 
example, three-phase electric motors (found in grinders, lathes, welders, air condi-
tioners, and other high-power devices) often turn in near synchrony with the ris-
ing and falling voltages of the phases. Also, with three-phase electric power, there is 
never a time when all three phases are at the same voltage. With single-phase power, 
whenever the two phases have the same voltage, there is temporarily no electric 
power available. This is why single-phase electric devices must store energy to carry 
them over these dry spells. In three-phase power, a device can always obtain power 
from at least one pair of phases.

974    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
A.2  A Closer Look at Three-Phase Electricity
The simple generator shown in Fig. A.2 can be used to generate single-phase voltage. 
As the magnet is rotated by a mechanical force, a voltage is induced within the two 
coils (spaced 180° apart) that yields a single sinusoidal voltage. The output voltage is 
usually expressed as an rms voltage (Vrms = 1/ 2 V0).
In the three-phase generator, three separate voltages are generated by using three 
different coils spaced 120° apart. As the magnet rotates, a voltage is induced across 
each of the generator’s coils. All the coil voltages are equal in magnitude but are 120°

grounded at pole
FIGURE A.1

Appendix A: Power Distribution and Home Wiring     975
A Y configuration is made by connecting one 
end of each of the generator’s coils together 
to form what is called the neutral lead. The 
remaining three coil ends are brought out 
separately and are considered the “hot” leads. 
The voltage between the neutral and any one of 
the hot lines is called the phase voltage Vp. The 
total voltage, or line voltage VL, is the voltage 
across any two hot leads. The line voltage is 
the vector sum of the individual phase volt-
ages. In a Y-loaded circuit, each load has two 
phases in series. This means that the current 
and voltage through and across a load must be 
determined by superimposing the phase cur-
rents and phase voltages. One way to do this is 
to make a phasor diagram, as shown in the fig-
ure. For practical purposes, what is important 
to note is the line voltage is about 
3  times 
the phase voltage. Also, the line currents are 30° out of phase with the line voltages. When a neu-
tral is used, the line currents and line voltages are equal to the individual phases from the genera-
tor. No current flows in the neutral when the loads are equal across each phase (balanced load).
A delta connection is made by placing the 
three-phase generator’s coils end to end, as 
shown in the figure. Because the delta configu-
ration has no neutral lead, the phase voltages 
are equal to the line voltages. Again, like the 
Y configuration, all line voltages are 120° out 
of phase with each other. However, unlike the 
Y configuration, the line currents (I1, I2, I3) are 
equal to the vector sum of the phase currents 
(IA, IB, IC). When each of the phases are equally 
loaded, the line currents are all equal but 120° 
apart. The line currents are 30° out of phase 
with the line voltages, and they are 
3  times 
the phase currents.

out of phase with each other. With this generator, you could power three separate 
loads of equal resistance, or you could drive a three-phase motor with a similar coil 
configuration; however, this requires using six separate wires. To reduce the number 
of wires, there are two tricks that can be used. The first trick involves rearranging the 
three-phase coil connections into what is called a delta connection—which yields three 
wires. The second trick involves rearranging the coil connection into what is called a 
Y connection—which yields four wires. Here are the details.

A.3  Home Wiring
In the United States, three wires run from the pole transformer (or “green box” trans-
former) to the main service panel at one’s home. One wire is the A-phase wire (black 
in color), another is the B-phase wire (black in color), and the third is the neutral wire 
(white in color). (Figure A.5 shows where these three wires originate within the pole/
green box transformer.) The voltage between the A-phase and B-phase wires, or the 
“hot to hot” voltage, is 240 V, while the voltage between the neutral wire and either 
A-phase or B-phase wire, or the “neutral to hot” voltage, is 120 V. (These voltages are 
nominal and may vary from region to region.)

FIGURE A.5
At the home, the three wires from the pole/green box transformer are connected 
through a wattmeter and then enter a main service panel that is grounded to a long 
copper rod driven into the ground or to the steel in a home’s foundation. The A-phase 
and B-phase wires that enter the main panel are connected through a main disconnect 
breaker, while the neutral wire is connected to a terminal referred to as the neutral bar 
or neutral bus. A ground bar also may be present within the main service panel. The 
ground bar is connected to the grounding rod or to the foundation’s steel supports. 
Within main service panels, the neutral bar and the ground bar are connected 
together (they act as one). However, within subpanels (service panels that get their 
power from the main service panel but which are located some distance from the 
main service panel), the neutral and ground bars are not joined together. Instead, the 
subpanel’s ground bar receives a ground wire from the main service panel. Often 
the metal conduit that is used to transport the wires from the main service panel to 
the subpanel is used as the “ground wire.” However, for certain critical applications 
(e.g., computer and life-support systems), the ground wire probably will be included 
within the conduit. Also, if a subpanel is not located in the same building as the main 
panel, a new ground rod typically is used to ground the subpanel. Note that different 
regions within the United States may use different wiring protocols. Therefore, do not 

Appendix A: Power Distribution and Home Wiring     977
assume that what we are telling you is standard practice where you live. Contact 
your local electrical inspector.
Within the main service panel, there are typically two bus bars into which circuit 
breaker modules are inserted. One of these bus bars is connected to the A-phase wire; 
the other bus bar is connected to the B-phase wire. To power a group of 120-V loads 
(e.g., upstairs lights and 120-V outlets), you throw the main breaker to the off position 
and then insert a single-pole breaker into one of the bus bars. (You can choose either 
the A-phase bus bar or the B-phase bus bar. The choice of which bus bar you use only 
becomes important when it comes to balancing the overall load—more on that in a 
second.) Next, you take a 120-V three-wire cable and connect the cable’s black (hot) 
wire to the breaker, connect the cable’s white (neutral) wire to the neutral bar, and 
connect the cable’s ground wire (green or bare) to the ground bar. You then run the 
cable to where the 120-V loads are located, connect the hot and neutral wires across 
the load, and fasten the ground wire to the case of the load (typically a ground screw 
is supplied on an outlet mounting or light figure for this purpose). To power other 
120-V loads that use their own breakers, you basically do the same thing you did in 
the last setup. However, to maximize the capacity of the main panel (or subpanel) to 
supply as much current as possible without overloading the main circuit breaker in 
the process, it is important to balance the number of loads connected to the A-phase 
breakers with the number of loads connected to the B-phase breakers. This is referred 
to as balancing the load.
Now, if you want to supply power to 240-V appliances (e.g., ovens, washers, etc.), 
you insert a double-pole breaker between the A-phase and B-phase bus bars in the 
main panel (or subpanel). Next, you take a 240-V three-wire cable and attach one of 
its hot wires to the A-phase terminal of the breaker and attach its other hot wire to 
the B-phase terminal of the breaker. The ground wire (green or bare) is connected 
to the ground bar. You then run the cable to where the 240-V loads are located and 
attach the wires to the corresponding terminals of the load (typically within a 240-V 
outlet). Also, 120-V/240-V appliances are wired in a similar manner, except you use a  
fourwire cable that contains an additional neutral (white) wire that is joined at the  
neutral bar within the main panel (or subpanel). (As a practical note, you could use a  
fourwire 120-V/240-V cable instead of a 240-V three-wire cable for 240-V applications—
you would just leave the neutral wire alone in this case.)
As a note of caution, do not attempt home wiring unless you are sure of your 
abilities. If you feel that you are capable, just make sure to flip the main breaker off 
before you start work within the main service panel. When working on light fixtures, 
switches, and outlets that are connected to an individual breaker, tag that breaker 
with tape so that you do not mistakenly flip the wrong breaker when you go back to 
test your connections.
A.4  Electricity in Other Countries
In the United States, homes receive a 60-Hz, 120-V single-phase voltage, whereas 
industry typically receives a 60-Hz, 208-V/120-V three-phase voltage. Most other 
countries, on the other hand, work with a 50-Hz, 230-V single-phase voltage and a 
415-V three-phase voltage. Now, if you were to take a U.S.-built 120-V, 60-Hz device 
over to Norway—where 230 V is used—and plug that device directly into the outlet 

978    PRACTICAL ELECTRONICS FOR INVENTORS
(you would need an adapter to do this—their outlets look different), you run a risk of 
damaging the device. Some devices may not “care” about the voltage and frequency 
differences, but others will. You could use a converter (transformer plug-in device) 
to step down the voltage from the outlet, but you would still be stuck with 50 Hz. 
The 10-Hz difference will not affect most devices, but other devices, such as TVs and 
VCRs, may not function properly.
Here’s a listing of single-phase voltages found in some countries. Note the 
plug types.

Reliability estimates of measurements greatly enhance their value. For example, say-
ing the resistance of a resistor is 1000 Ω ± 50 Ω tells you much more than simply stat-
ing the resistance is 1000 Ω.
The term error is basically interchangeable with uncertainty, but does not have the 
same meaning as mistake. Mistakes, such as errors in calculations, should be corrected 
before estimating the experimental error. In estimating the reliability of a single quan-
tity (such as resistance), you should recognize three different kinds of sources of error:
1. Actual variations of the quantity being measured, for example, resistance changes 
due to temperature variations. In electronics, for accurate measurements, you 
should consider the temperature ratings and the corresponding errors specified in 
the data sheets.
2. Test equipment in error. The errors introduced by test equipment. Make sure that 
all equipment is calibrated, and be certain to take into account input impedance 
characteristics, such as the input impedance of a multimeter and oscilloscope.
3. Human error. With digital equipment displays this is less of a problem. A scope 
with a graphical display will not give you high accuracy (only around 5 percent).
B.1  Absolute Error, Relative Error, and Percent Error
If ∆x is the absolute error (or uncertainty with a ± in front) in a measurement whose 
value is x, then ∆x/x is called the relative error (or fractional uncertainty). If we multiply 
the relative error by 100 percent, we get the percent error, or 100% ⋅ (∆x/x). The term 
tolerance is interchangeable with both absolute error and percent error. For example, 
Error Analysis
APPENDIX B

tolerances in length measurements are typically given in terms of absolute error val-
ues, while tolerances in resistances are typically given in percent error.
Example 1: What’s the relative error and percent error of 0.125 A ± 0.01 A?

The absolute error or uncertainty is:
 
∆x = x (relative error) = (3300 Ω)(0.05) = ±165 Ω
The resistor is guaranteed for 3300 Ω ± 165 Ω or guaranteed to be between 3135 Ω 
and 3465 Ω.
B.2  Uncertainty Estimates
When dealing with equations with many independent variables, like the following 
RC charge response equation
 
/
I
V
R e
C
t RC
=
−
the uncertainty or error in the final result (e.g., current) will depend on the individual 
uncertainties (e.g., uncertainties in resistance, capacitance, voltage, and time). The 
propagation of errors can be explained by first analyzing simple arithmetic cases:
1. If the desired result is the sum or difference of two measurements, the absolute 
uncertainties add:
 
Let ∆x and ∆y be the errors in x and y, respectively. For the sum, we have:
 
z = x + ∆x + y + ∆y
 
and a relative error of
 
(∆x + ∆y)/(x + y)

Appendix B: Error Analysis    981
 
 Since the signs of ∆x and ∆y can be opposite, adding the absolute values gives a pes-
simistic estimate of the uncertainty. If errors have a Gaussian distribution and are 
independent, they combine in quadrature (square root of the sum of the squares):
 
2
2
z
x
y
∆=
∆
+ ∆
 
For the difference of two measurements, we obtain a relative error of:
 
(∆x + ∆y)/(x − y)
 
 which becomes very large if x is nearly equal to y. This is an important point to 
note; you must avoid designing experiments where two large quantities are mea-
sured and their difference obtained.
2. If the desired result involves multiplying or dividing measured quantities, then the 
relative uncertainty of the result is the sum of the relative errors in each of the mea-
sured quantities. The most pessimistic case corresponds to adding the absolute 
value of each term, since the ∆xi and ∆xi can be of either sign:

3. If the desired result is a power of the measured quantity, the relative error in the 
result is the relative error in the measured quantity multiplied by the power. For 
example, the uncertainty in
 
z = xn
 
is:
 
∆

4. For anything more complex, the following equation gives the general method for 
finding uncertainty in measurements. For example, if R = f(x, y, z) is the functional 
relationship between three measurements x, y, z, then
 
= ∂

∂

Usually, you don’t have to go to this extreme—you can usually get by with the 
rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and rising to the power. To make 
life easy on you, a cheat sheet is provided here.

Example 1: The voltages across two series resistors are measured using two differ-
ent voltmeters. One digital meter reads 6.24 V ± 0.01 V across the first resistor; a less 
precise analog meter measures 14.3 V ± 0.2 V. What is the total voltage across the pair, 
including uncertainty in the result?
Answer: We simply add voltages and use Eq. 1 to determine the resultant uncertainty:

C.7  Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are covered in detail in Chap. 2.
C.8  Differential Calculus
Say you have a function f(x). This function may represent a line, parabola, exponential 
curve, trigonometric curve, etc. Now pretend that you take a point and move it along 
the curve of f(x). At the same time, you envision a tangent line touching the curve at 
the point. As the point moves along the curve, the slope of the tangent line changes 
(“teeter- totters”)—provided the curve is not a line. Now, the slope of the tangent line 
has great significance in real- life situations. For example, if you graph a curve of the 
position of an object versus time, the slope at a particular time along the curve repre-
sents the instantaneous velocity of the object. Likewise, if you have an electrical charge 
versus time graph, the slope at time t represents the instantaneous current- flow. Now, 
the trick to finding the slope of a tangent line for any point along a curve involves 
using differential calculus. What differential calculus does is this: If you have a func-
tion, say, y = x2—through the tricks of differential calculus—you can find another func-
tion, which is called the derivative of y (usually expressed as y′ or dy/dx), that tells you 
the slope at every point along the curve of y. For y = x2, the derivative is dy/dx = 2x. 
If you are interested in the slope of y at x = 2, you plug 2 into dy/dx to give you a slope 
of 4. But how do you find the derivative of y = x2? Better yet, how do you find the 
derivative of any given function? The following provides the basic theory.

Now, in practice, if you need to find the derivative of a function, you do not 
bother using the preceding equation. To do so would be very time- consuming and 
might require a number of nasty mathematical tricks, especially if you are trying to 
find the derivative of a complex function such as 2ex sin (3x + 2). Instead, what you 
do is memorize a few simple rules and memorize a few simple derivatives. The table 
below shows some of the rules and simple derivatives that will come in handy for 
many applications. In the table, a and n are constants, while u and v are functions.
To find the derivative of a function y = f(x), you let P(x,y) be a point 
of the graph of y = f(x) and let Q(x + Dx, y + Dy) be another point of the 
graph. The slope of the line between P and Q is then simply
f x

( )
+ ∆

Now you substitute the function into the preceding equation. For exam-
ple, if f(x) = x2, then f(x + Dx) = (x + Dx)2, and the whole expression equals 
[(x + Dx)2 - x2]/Dx. Next, you hold x fixed and let Dx approach zero. If the 
slope approaches a value that depends only on x, you call this the slope 
of the curve at point P. The slope of the curve at P is itself a function of x, 
defined at every value of x at which the limit exists.You denote the slope 
by f (x) (“f prime”), or dy/dx (“dydx”), or df/dx (“dfdx”), and call any one 
of these terms (your choice) the derivative of f(x):

Appendix C: Useful Facts and Formulas    987
If we’re given an equation dy/dx = f(x) and wish to find y, we must inte-
grate (antidifferentiate). In this case, we first rearrange the equation into 
the form dy = f(x) dx. Next, we integrate both sides:

Again, Œ is an integral sign, the function f(x) is the integrand, and C is the 
constant of integration. We guessed that Œ dy = y é C, since if we were to 
take the derivative of any function of the form y é C (y + 2, y - 54, etc.) we’d 
get y as the answer—we worked backward. Since C could be positive or negative, it’s arbitrary to give it a sign. This way, 
we simply add C to the left. In this form, we call the integral an indefinite integral.
Example: Given dy/dx = 2, find y.

In real- life situations, it’s typically undesirable to have a constant in our answers, since we’re looking for a definite result. To get 
rid of the constant, we apply boundary conditions. For example, if we take our last example dy/dx = 2, we say we’re only interested 
in values of dy/dx from, say, 1 to 5—whatever range is appropriate for the situation. In that case, we take the definite integral

Without getting too technical, F represents the definite integral without the constant sign, while the (a) and (b) terms mean to 
place the boundary points into the x term of F. If we consider our example dy/dx = 2 with boundary condition 1 to 5, we’d get:
y

We call this a definite integral. At this point, it’s worth introducing a graphical approach to visualizing integration. If we 
consider dy/dx = 2, and graph dy/dx versus x, we get a straight horizontal line at dy/dx = 2 for all values of x. By summing 
up the area under the curve, we get the integral. So incorporating the boundary conditions the area is (5 - 1) ë 2 = 8.
Now, if we attempt to integrate more complex functions, we’ll have a hard time guessing what the functions of the deriva-
tive are. Instead, we must apply some special tricks along the way. These tricks stem from a basic idea called the fun-
damental theorem of calculus, and they get fairly involved. Presenting the theory in such a short space isn’t going to do. 
However, in practice, you typically never use the fundamental theorem of calculus to find integrals of functions. Instead, 
you memorize a few fundamental integrals and learn a few tricks. The following list highlights some of the most common 
integrals and solutions. A mathematical handbook will provide a more extensive list. In the list, a u represents a function 
of x, while v represents another function of x.
C.9  Integral Calculus
In differential calculus, our goal was to find the derivative of a function. In integral cal-
culus, our goal is to find the functions of a derivative. In reality, calling one thing a deriva-
tive and another thing a function is somewhat confusing because a derivative is usually 
a function in itself. To avoid possible complications, we simply call anything that’s 
written as y = f(x) a function, call anything that’s written as dy/dx = df(x)/dx a deriva-
tive, and call anything that’s written as ∫ dy = ∫ f(x)dx an antiderivative or integral. In 
the last case, the “∫” is called the integral sign, the function f(x) is called the integrand, 
and dx is called the variable of integration. To integrate a function is to find all the func-
tions that have it as a derivative—to find all of the given function’s antiderivatives. But,  
the term integration has a second, less technical meaning—to give the sum total of.  
In this meaning, integration represents a mathematical process that enables us to calcu-
late the area of a region that has curved boundaries (see graph in Fig. C.7).
