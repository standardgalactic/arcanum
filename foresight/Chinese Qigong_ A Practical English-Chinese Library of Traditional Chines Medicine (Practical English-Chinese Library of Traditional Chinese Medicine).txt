Preface

jlj;J)ll.E.~*
The books in series, entitled "A Pra<tical English-Chine..
library of Traditional Chinese Medicine",
are edited with a
view to disseminating the theory and knowledge of traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) across the world, promoting acade-
mic exchanges on medical science between China and other
C<luntries, and meeting with the ever-increasing international
interest in TCM, so as to make it serve the interests of all na-
tions and benefit entire mankind.
This library is the first of
its kind in China.
The library is composed of 12 books: Basic Theory of TCM
(in two volumes),
Diagnostics of TCM,
The Chinese Materia
Medica, Prescriptions of TCM, Clinic <if TCM (in two volumes),
Health
Pre6ervati'on and Rehabilitation,
Chinese
Acupuncture
and Moxihustion, Ch,.ese Massage, Chinese Medicated Diet and
Chinese Qigong.
The two other English-Chinese books __
Rare Chinese Materia Medica and
Highly
Efficacious
Chinese
Patent Medicines -~ chiefly edited by me are also published
simultaneously along with this library.
The authors and editors of the
serie~ strive to abide by
the following principles:
maintaining
the systematism,
in-
tegrity,
practicability and
adaptability in
terms of TCM
theory; paying full attention to the organic connection between
basic theory and clinical treatment, taking in the available
results of scientific researches carried out at home and abroad
1

in thc field of 1'C;"1; and bcil'g concise, prrcise, and casy to
understand in the Chinese version, and correct and flucnt in
the
English one.
Some of the books mentioned above contain
figurcs and coloured photos. It is our sinccre hopc that the books
will turn out to be good teachcrs and reliable friends of those
abroad who havc begun to learn and practise TCM and
Chincsc, and provide help for those at home who wish to study
TCM documents in English.
The component books of this library are written, trans-
latc<l, and editcd throngh joint efforts of professors, associate
professors, lecturers and medical research workers from Shan·
dong TC;"[ Collegc and its affiliated hospital, Shandong Medi-
cal University and its
affiliated
hospital, Shandong Uni.
versity, Shandong Teachers Training University, Shandong
Mcdical Acadcmy, Shandong Provincial Anti-epidemic Station,
China Academy of TCM, Nanjing TCM College, Shanghai
TCM College, Beijing TCM College, etc.
In order to ensure that the present library is of good quali-
ty, we have sent its
Chinese version for reVIsion to Professor
Zhou Fengwu, Professor Li Keshao who was once my tutor
when I was a postgraduate student, Professor Xu Guoqian
and Professor Zhang Zhenyu at Shandoilg TCM
College,
Professor Qiu Maoliang at Nanjing TCM College, and Pro-
fessor
Lu Tongjie,
director of the Affiliated
Hospital
of
Shandong TCM College; and the English version for proof-
reading to ProfeS3or Huang Xiaokai of Beijing Medical Uni-
versity, Professor Lu Chengzhi, head of the Foreign Latlguages
Department
of
Shandong
Medical
University,
Professor
Huang Jiade of Shandong University, Mr. Huang Wcnxing,
2
professor of pharmacology,
Mme. Zou
Ling,
professor
of
gynecology and obstetrics, both working in Shandong Medical
University, and our foreign friends, Ms. Beth Hocks, Austra-
lian teacher of English, Mr. Howard G. Adams, American tea-
cher of English, and some others working in ]inan.
I am deeply indebted to Mr. Li Dichen, Editor-in-Chief of
Publishing House of Shanghai TCM College, and his colleagues,
Mme. Xu Ping, director of the Editorial Department, and Mr.
Yao Yong, responsible editor, for thcir advice about drawing up
an outline for compiling the library to ensure a succeSs of it;
to Mr. Chcn Keji, professor of China Acadcmy of TCM and
advisor on traditional medicine to WHO, Profcssor Zhang
Zhiyuan and Associate Professor Shao Gnanyong of Shandong
TCM College, Mr. Lin Chonggang, deputy head of the Yellow
River Publishing House, for their valuable, instructive sug.
gestions; and to responsible members at various levels, such as
Mr. Hu Ximing, Chairman of
the World Acupuncture and
Moxibustion Association, vice-minister of the Ministry of Pnb-
lic Health and chief of the Administrative Bureau of TCM
and Pharmacy of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Zou
Jilong, president of Shandong TCM College, Mr. Yan Shiyun,
vice-president of Shanghai TCM College, Mr. Gao Heting,
president of Beijing TCM
Collegc,
Mr. Xiang Ping, vice-
president of Nanjing TC11 College, and Mr. Shang Zhichang,
president of Henan TCM College for their warm encourage-
ment and indispensable support as well as their personal parti-
cipation in compiling and checking the books.
TCM, which dates back to ancient times, has a unique and
profound theoretical system.
Thc great"r part of its termino-
3

logy has particular denotations,
and
is matter-of-factly dif-
ficult to understand and translate. Inaccuracies in the library,
therefore, are unavoidable.
I hope that my friends in the TCM
circle will oblige me with timely corrections.
May TCM spread all over the world and everyone under
the heaven enjoy a long happy life.

Outline of Qigong
Being an art of self-training both body and mind as well
as sending forth externaf qi (waiqi), qigong, created by the
Chinese people in the long process onife, labour and fight against
diseases and senium, has the functions of preventing and cur-
ing diseases, protecting and strengthening health and prolong-
ing life.
It is one of the gems in the treasure-house of China's
cultural heritage as well as a component part of traditional
Chinese medicine.
Qjgong has a long history and diverse schools. In ancient
times it got various names such as "Xingqi (Promoting and
Conducting Qj)",
"Fuqi
(Taking
Qj)",
"Tuna (Expiration
and
Inspiration)",
"Do'!)'in
(Inducing
and
Conducting
0)", "Anqiao (Massage)", "Shushu (Breath-counting)", "Zuo-
chan (Silting
~leditation)", "Shiqi (Living on Qj)", "Jingzuo
(Sitting Still)" and "Wogong (Lying Exercises)".
As the "in-
ternal qi
(Tlfi~i)" of qigong and the "external qi (woiqi)" emitted
by qigong
llLsters
are invisible and inaudible
to ordinary
people, qigong i.s commonly considered to be mysterious and
profuuud.

1.
The Concept of Qjgong
Qjgong is an art and skill to train qi(J).
To be exact, it is
a method by which the practitioner gets physical and mental
self:exercise through bringing into play his subjective initiative.
To achieve this aim, the practitioner nlust associate his mind,
postures and breathing and act on the whole organism.
On
one hand, it actively self-regulates the functional activities of
the organism and maintains a dynamic equilibrium.
0'; the
other hand, it enables the body to produce an "energy-storing"
reaction, reduce energy consumption and increase energy ac-
cumulation, producing the effects of regulating yin and yang,
dredging the channels and collaterals and emitting external qi.
2.
A Brief History of the Developtnent of
Qjgong
Qjgong, as a medical keep-fit
activity, has
a
history of
several thousand years in China. As tradition has it, in the times
of "Yao" people had already realized that dancing could streng-
then health.
For instance, the chapter "On Ancient Music"
of Lii's Spring and Autumn Annals recorded: "From as early
as the origin of the previous Tao and Tang families, yin tends
to stagnate and ineubate latently and accumnlate in the depth
uf the body, the water passages are thus blocked up and water
no longer flows in its original right passages; qi smoulders and
stagnates within the body; the mnsc1es and bones cower and
shorten and can not extend properly, then dancing is created
accordingly to remove the stagnancy and
obstruction."
La-
tcr on, some dances gradually developed into physical and
breathing therapies,
In the process of fight against nature,
ancient
people
gradually
realized
that
certain
actions,
hrcathing and pronunciations can regulate certain functions of
the human body, such as extendi,'g the limbs being able to
dissipate heat, huddling up the body to keep out cold, the sound

Uha" to dissipate heat and remove stagnancy, the sound "hei"
to subdue and discharge physical strength, the sound "xu" to
alleviate pain, etc.
The ancient theory that "the bear will
contract itself when climbing a tree and the bird will stretch its
legs when flying in the air" was formed in this way in practice.
In the Zhou Dynasty (11th century B.C. -
771 B.C.)
there had already been records on qigong in the inscriptions on
ancient bronze objects.
Lao Zi
(6th cent,,!)' KC.) recorded
the methods of "blowing (chui)" and "puffing (xu)".
Zhuang
Zi further
recorded:
"blowing and
puffing,
exhaling and
inhaling, getting rid of the stale and taking in the fresh, con-
tracting Eke the bear and stretching like the bird, all help
prolong life."
"Jade Pendant Inscription on Qjgong", a historical relic
of the early Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods
(770 B.C. -
221
B.C.), recorded the training method and
theory of qigon.~.
The inscription was engraved on a 12-sided
cylinder, containing altogether forty-five Chinese characters:
"In promoting and conducting qi, depth promises storage, stor-
age promises l'xtention, extention promises descent,
descent
promises stolbility, stability promises solidity, solidity promises
germination, germination promises growth, growth promises
retreat, retreat leads to heaven.
Heavenly qi functions from
above, earthly qi functions from below.
Conformity to this
leads to life while adverseness to this leads to death."
Here
not only the training process of the small heavenly circuit is
clearly explained, but the health-preserving principles of qi-
gong are also expounded.
Among the hi,torieal relics unearthed from the Han Tomb
No. 3 at l\Iaw<lngdui, Changsha, Hunan Province, there was
a silk

displays 44 coloured "dauyin illustrations" in which illustrations
of training exercises arc painted.
This shows that
China
already used the form of illustrations to teaeh qigong no later
than the early \Vestern Han Dynasty period.
In the Han Dynasty, the earliest extant general medical
collection in China -
The
Yellow
Emperor's
Canon rif In-
ternal
Medicins systematically expounded qigong's principles,
training methods and the effects of qigong dirigation.
For ins-
tance, "Remain nonchalant and void, then genuine qi will
follow; keep a sound mind, ho",,' can diseases come on"; "Ex-
hale and inhale essence qi, concentrate the spirit to keep a sound
milld, the Illuscles and flesh unite as one"; "Those who suffer
from a lingering kidney disease can face the south from 3 a.m.
to 5 a.m., clear the mind of all stray thoughts, hold Ixeath
withal!t respiration for seven times,
swallow the breath by
slightly craning the neck to send it down smoothly, just as
swallowing very hard objects. Having done this for seven times,
gulp down the plenty of sublingual saliva", and the like.
Viewed from the development of the history of tradition-
al Chinese medicine,
doctors through the ages all paid great
attention to qigong and had great attainments in qigong as well.
In Treaties on Febrile and
Miscellaneous
Diseases
(about
3rd century A.D.) written by Zhang Zhongjing, an outstanding
physician of the Han Dynasty,
there are reeords of employ-
ing qigong to treat diseases.
For instanee, "As soon as the limbs
feel heavy and sluggish, resort to such treatments as daoyin,
tuna (expiration and inspiration), acupuncture and massage
by rubbing with ointment so as not to allow the nine orifiees
to close up."
His contemporary, renowned physician Hua-
tUG,
all the foundation of inheriting the ancient qigong and
daoyin, created a set of fitness exercises called
"The Five-
Animal Play (Wuqinxi)" mimicking the movements and gestures
of the tiger, the deer, the bear, the ape and the bird (crane).
It is exercised to attain the goal of "free circulation of blood and

prevention of disease occurrence ".
Ge Hong, a renowned physician in the Eastern Jin Dy-
nasty, held that the methods of daoyill shoul,j be diversified.
He pointed out in his book Bao P'!Zi's Inner Treatles:
"Flex-
ing or stretching, bendillg or up-lacing, walking or lying, lean-
ing or standiug, pacing or strolling, chanting or breathing are
all methods of d(ll)yin."
He believed that the function of qigong
is "to cure diseases not yet contracted and dredge discordant
qi.
Once it gets working, qi will flow unimpededly
every-
where."
He also commented on applying exhalation and in-
halation, expiration and inspiration to "conducting qi", which
can "keep in good health internally and eliminate pathogenic
factors externally".
Records on qigong are also f(Jl.!'1d in General Treatise on tM
Etiology and
Symptomatology
of Diseases (GIO) written by
Chao Yuanfang during the Sui Dynasty, Prescriptions Worth
a Thousand Gold for Emergencies by the renowlled physician
Sun Simiao (58j·-G82) and The Medical Secrets of an
Official
by Wang Tao (702-772) during the Tang Dynasty, the well-
known medical formulary General Collection for
Holy Relief
of the Northern Song Dynasty and medical books written by
the four eminent physicicns in the .lin and Yuan Dynasties,
namely, Liu W'cnsu's
On Keeping Fit,
Zhang Zihe's Confu-
datls Duties to Their Parents,
Li Dongyuan's
Secret
Rc&ora
of the
Chamber of
Orchids and Zhu Danxi's
On

the Properties of Things.
In the Ming Dynasty, the renowned physician and phar-
macologist Li Shi"hen (1518·-1593) recorded in his A
Study
on the Eight Extra Channels:
"The inner scene and channels
can be perceived clean and clear only by those who can see
inwards."
He aLso pointed out in his Guitleboo/e to
A,;uplllU-
lure and Moxibustlon that those who learn acupuncture and
nloxibustiun should practise still sitting exercises first, thus "in

and the opening and closing of the functional activities of q;
can have a reliable foundation".
Collection of Prescriptions
",ith
Notes (1682) compiled
by the well-known physician Wang Aug of the early Qing
Dynasty and Shen's Work on the Importance of Life Preserva.
tiOlI (1773) written by Shen Jin-ao both have special records
of the training methods of q;gong.
Mter the Revolution of
1911,some intel1eetuals advocated stil1 sitting exercises. Their re-
presentative works include: Jiang Weiqiao's Yinshi Zi Stm Sit.
ting Exercz'ses, Ding Fubao's Essence of Still Sitting Exercises and
Chen Qianming's The Health Preserving Method of Tranquility.
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, on
the foundation of inheriting the traditional q;gong, quite a num-
ber of men of insight fllrther tapped, systematized and formu-
lated
a
multitude of
new
training maneuvers.
In
1955
China f()llnded a qigong sanatorium in the city of Tangshan,
Hebei Province, observed and summed up the clinical curative
effects of qigong therapy.
In 1956, training courses in q;gong
were fllrther set up sllccessively in Tangshan and Beidaihe,
Hebei Province, fostering a large number of qigong specialists
for many places of the country.
InJuly, 1957, Shanghai Muni.
cipal
Qjgong Sanitorillm was founded.
In Octobor,
1959,
thc l\Iinistry of Public Health of the People's Republic of China
held the First National Meeting to Exchange Experience in
Qjgong in Beidaihe,
Hebei Province.
The representatives of
64 units from 17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions of the country attended the meeting.
Since 1978,
the personnel conducting scientific research in Beijing and
Shanghai have constantly adopted modern scientific instruments
to carry out mnlti-discipline comprehensive research into qi-
gong.
It has been proved that qigong has a substantial founda.
tion and is scientific.
Qjgollg thence stepped into the ranks
of sciellce and has evoked a new task of exploring the science

widely used to treat many chronic diseases such as chronic hepa-
titis, hypertension, pyknocardia, bronchial asthma and neuras-
thenia. Qigong also has certain curative effect on certain acute
diseases like acute appendicitis.
Qjgong can also serve as an
anesthetic means in certain surgical operations.
At
present,
the application and research of qigong have gone far beyond
tbe scope of medical hygienics.
It has been found to have
relatively high application value in agriculture, military affairs,
physical culture, cducation and many other aspects.
It is
estimated that the application and research of qigong may bring
even larger profits to human beings and play an important
role in probing the secrets of the human body and life and
founding a new science of human body and life.
The age-
old Chinese qigollg will make contributions to the health and
longevity of people of the world.
Section Two
The Theoretical Basis of Qigong
The basic theory of qigong is closely related with the yin-
yang theory, :r.allg-:fu (viscera) theory and the theory of channels
and collaterals (jingluo) of traditional Chinese medicine and is
actually used to guide the training practice. The following is
a brief account:
1.
Qjgong and Yin-Yang
The yin':;l'Ollg theory® is a philosophical thought in ancient
China as well as an important constituent of the basic theories
of traditional Chinese medicine.
The theory of qigong is also
based on it.

MIrror
of
Oriental
Medici". pointed out:
"Exhalation sends qi out, being the
opening ofyang; inhalation brings qi in, being the closing of
.,.vin."
These
th~crics 3.re of grcut guiding sig-uiiicance in qigong
dirigation.
For instance, those with hyperactive yang and excess
of fire should lay stress on exhalation during the training prac-
tice so as to send out the excessive fire; while those with defi-
ciency ofyang and qi collapse should enhance inhalation since
yang is already too insufficient to be sent out any longer.
For
another instance, in the fOUf seasons of a year, there are dif-
ferent
climatic
variations of spring warm,
summer
heat,
autumn cool and winter cold, so the training practice should
also be administrated properly in accordance.
The chapter
"On the Regulation of Mental Activities in Accordance with
the Four Qj's" of Plaln Questions says: "Spring and summer
nourish yang, autumn and winter nourish yin."
This is also
a principle to be abided by in
qigon~ dirigation.
2.
Qjgong and the Channels and Collaterals
Qjgong is developed on the basis of the theory of channels
and coll?terals (jingluo)® of traditional Chinese medicine, and
the constant development of qigong in turn provides an object-
ive evidence for the existence of
channels and collaterals,
making even clearer
the trends, conjunctions and interrela...
tions of the various channels.
The qigong maneuvers of "Circulation of Qj in Heavenly
Circuit" and "Ascending, Descending, Opening and Closing
of Qj" are just very important
maneuvers
to enable qi to
!low and circulate normally, among which the exercise of the
small heavenly circuit of qi can result in conducting the channel
and collateral qi to circulate unimpeded through the &n and
Du Channels (the Front Midline and Back Midline Channels);
tbe exereise of the large heavenly circuit of
qi can result in

•

•

directing the channel and collateral qi to circulate freely through
the twelve main channels and the eight extra channels.
The
maneuver of "Ascending, Descending, Opening and Closing
of Qj" enables the channel and collateral qi to ascend, descend,
open and close according to the reqirements of the practitioner
and to circulate freely through the Ren and Du Channels, the
twelve main channels, the eight extra channels and the col-
laterals.
3.
Qjgong and the Viscera
The heart governs mental activities.
The "mental activ-
ities" in traditional Chinese medicine is a general summation
of spirit, consciousness and thinking (the higher central nervous
activities).
They actually refer to the function of the brain.
To exercise qigong is to conccntrate the mind and
bring the
brain into a
tranquil
state
so
as
to
achieve
the
purpose
of regulating and recuperating the "mental activities".
The
heart also governs blood circulation and has its outward mani-
festation in the face.
Qjgong exercise may effect the exuberance
of the heart-qi manifested by even, gentle and forceful pulse,
ruddy and lustrous complexion.
The lung governs qi and is in charge of respiration.
The
breathing exercise in
the
training practice can inhale the
essence qi of the heaven and earth and exhale the turbid qi in
the viscera.
The inhaled essence qi of the heaven and earth
not only enriches the genuine qi, but can also directly promote
the circulation of qi and blood so that the qi and blood through-
out the body can flow freely; the five zang-organs and six fu-
organs and all the limbs and bones can function normally.
The lung is in charge ofsending down the inspired air and
the kidney governs the reception of air.
When the
practi-
tioner sinks the respired air to Dantian (Elixir Field)(j) through
deep long abdominal respiration, he can further strengthen the
lowering function of the lung and the receptive function of the
•
18
•
•
19
•

kidney, thus achieving a state of deep, long, gentle respiration
and almost unperceptible RasaI breath, a so-called state in
which "no movement can be expected even if a feather falls
on the noseo,.
At this time, the inhaled essence qi of the heaven
and earth sinks to meet and oombine with the
conge:tital
essence qi ofthe kidney to transform into the genuine qi of the
human body, thus enabling the internal qi and strength of the
body to condense and strengthen rapidly.
The kidneys are located in the lumbar regions, with one
on the left and right respectively, containing the gate of life
inside. Xu Lingtai
believed that (l:c gate of life is just "Dan-
tian (Elixir Field)".
Zhang ]ingyue pointed out: "The gate
of lile is the root of primordial qi, the residence of water and
fire.
The yin-qi of the five -1;ang-organs can not be nourished
without it; theyang-qi of the five -1;ang-organs can not be lifted
without it." It is right tltrough respiration exercise and mind
concentration on Dantian (Elixir
Field) that qigong dirigation
makes the gate of life fire sufficient, the spleen earth warmed,
the \'iscera nourished, food and air transported, yang-qi lifted
and the constitution strengthened.
The liver stores blood and is in charge of thinking.
It
prefers chcerfulness and magnanimity and is averse to gloomi-
ness
and
depression.
Gloomy
mood,
stagnation of
the
liver-qi or rage impairing the liver may cause the abnormal
dispersing and dredging function of the liver, while through
relaxation and tranquilization qigong dirigation can stabalize
the moods and recover the normal dispersing and dredging
function of the liver, thus leading the hyperactive liver:)lang
to lie low and the up-flaming liver-lire to descend spontaneously.
With the resulting ease of mind all diseases will disappear spon-
taneously.
The spleen has the function to transport and transform
nutrients.
Saliva is the excretion of the spleen.
On one hand,
qigvng dirigatioll can directly strengthen the spleen's function
•
20
•
• :al •

to transport and transform nutrients, the most obvious effect
being an increase in saliva and appetite; Oil the other hand,
qigong lays stress on abdominal respiration which strengthens
the superio-inferior movement of the diaphragm, thus produc-
ing
a massaging effect on the stomach and
promoting the
pcristaltic and digestive functions of the stomach.
Section Three
Modern Researches on Qigong
1.
The Influence of Qjgong on the NeuroDlus_
cular SysteDl
When the training practice reaches the qigong state, the
e!cctroenct'phalograph
dynamic
process
research
finds: the
peak frequency under qigong state diminishes in accordance with
the variations of time, the dynamic variance falls and the fluctua...
tion of the peak amplitude diminishes.
It can be seen that the
EEG stability is enhanced and the ordering degree is improved.
Meanwhile, the rhythm of the frontal region is strengthened, in-
dicating that the control ofthe brain over the activities of the in-
ternal organs and thc incretory glands is somewhat strengthened.
Under qigong tranquilization, various components of the
body-sensory evoked potential in the
experimentee
display
various degrees of restraint, the late components being the
most obvious in particular, manifested by descent of wave amp..
litudc or distortiun of undulate form. Some components have
disppeared.
The researchers hold that this is because in the
process of qigang, through auto~regulation the reticular structure
is made to produce
an
ascending restraint
OVl'r lhe sensory
transmission.
In addition, in the process of qigong tranquili-

zatlon thc scnse perception of electrical stimulation reduces or
disappears, denoting that the response to sensational stimula-
tion is reduced.
The determination of the skin electrical potential of the
acupoints Feishu (Lung Shu, UB 13) and Mingmen (Gate of life,
D. 4) finds that the skin electrical potential is reduced in the
process of the training practice.
During the training practice,
the Dan/ian (Elixir Field) and other regions' body surface tem-
perature rises.
Meanwhile, it can also be observed that when
the training practice reaches the tranquilization state the heart
rate slows down, while the volume of the ear lobe blood vessels
increases, the two presenting a negative correlation.
These
discoveries show that qigong dirigatioll can reduce the excitabi-
lity of the sympathetic nervous system
in
the
vcgetative
nerves and raise the excitability of the parasympathetic system.
When the training practice has reached the tranquiliza-
tion state) the relaxation degree of the skeletal nluscles is in-
creased and
the
e1cctrmuyogram
presents
single
electrical
potential pattern or electrical quiescence. Meanwhile, the mus-
cular chronaxy is obviously elongated.
2.
The Influence of Qjgong on the Respiratory
System
During the training practice, the frequency of respiration
obviuusly decreases, the depth of respir"tiun deepens, the pul-
munary ventilation volume reduces,
tidal volume increases,
the carbon diuxide component in the expiratory air and alveolar
air increases while the oxygen component reduces.
These
')how that in the ;1focess ur the training practice respiration is
in a spantancous \vcakcning state.

the stomach and intestines, strengthen their contraction and
cause the hyperfunction of the intestinal gurgling sound, pro-
moting the secretion of gastric juice. These effects also indicate
that the training practice lays the cerebral cortex in a specific
qigong state and regulates the functional condition of the vegeta-
tive nerves, manifested as the rise of the excitability of the vagus
nerve and the fall of the excitability of the sympathetic nerve,
thus regulating the movement and secretory function of the
stomach and intestines.
:t\.1caIl\\'hilc, the respiration exercise
of qigong is dominated by diaphragmatic movement.
The
deep
and profound abdominal respiration can increase the
amplitude of the diaphragmatic movement by 3-4 times,
changing the intra-abdominal pressure and
promoting the
peristalsis cf the stomach and intestines.
4.
The Influence of Qjgong on the Sanguim.o-
tory SystelD
Clinical research verifies that qigong dirigation can lower
the blood pressure of hypt"rtension sufferers as well as raise the
lliood pressure of hypotension sufferers.
This is because qi-
gong can regulate the excitability of the bulbar cardiovascular
motor center, thus changing the excitatory state of the vege-
tative nerve that dominates the heart and the blood vessels,
especially the excitatory state of the sympathetic nerve that
dominates the peripheral blood vessels. For hypertension suf-
fCrers, it reduces the exeitability of the sympathetic nerve that
dominates the peripheral blood ves"ls, diastolizes the blood
vessels,
reduces
the
peripheral
resistance
and
meanwhile
reduces the heart rate. So the blood pressure can be lowered or
recovered to the normal level.
For hypotention sulferer' it
will produce contrary drects.

5.
The Influence of Qjgong OD Metabolis111 and
the Endocrine SysteJD
During the training practice, especially that
of static
qigong, the metabolic rate is even lower than basal metabolic
rate.
Research shows that qigong can accumulate the synthesis
and reduce the decomposition of hepatic glycogen, and is thcre-
fore an energy-storing process. It
can
be held that this is
the result of the increase of thc function of the vago-insulin
system and the comparative descent of the function of the
sympathetic-adrenaline
system
and the pituitary-adrenocor-
tical system.
6.
The Influence of Extcrnal OJ on Bacteria
and Ani.nals
I) Experiments on bacteria show
that
the emitted ex.
ternal qi (waiqi) can, following the mindwill, kill or multiply
gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria.
Its lethal
rate can reach 90%.
2) Experiments on animals show that external qi (waiqi)
has notable regulating effects on animals.
External qi (waiqi)
can obviously reduce the tensity of the
Oddi's spLineh'r of
domestic rabbits; external qi (waiqi) can obviously brighten the
vcntricular systolic wave and slow down the heart rate of the
/fog' hearts.
These show clearly that external qi (waiqi) has
regulating crfects on both the smooth muscles and carditlC mus-
cles of anitnals.

Section Four
Acupoints and Orifices Commonly
Used in Qigong
1.
Dantian (Elixir Field) and Three Passes in
Qjgong
1) Dantian (Elixir Field)
Dantian (Elixir Field) is an area where genuine qi is amass-
ed and stored.
Qjgong masters through the ages have dif-
ferent opinions as to the locality of Dantian (Elixir Field).
In summarization, it Can be classified into Upper Dantian,
1\1iddle Dantian and Lower Dan/ian.
Most qigong masters refer to Upper Dantian as "Niwan
(Mud Ball)", believing it to be located inside the acupoint
Baihui (Hundred Convergences, Du 20) on the top of the head;
while Canon tif tlu
Yello",
Yard calls Upper-Dan/ian "::'uqiao
(Progenitor Orifice) ", refering to a site 3 cun® inside the acupoint
Yintang (Glabella, Extra 1) in the middle between the two eye-
brows
(the glabellum).
The locality of Middle Dan/ian is
inside the acupoint Shanzhong (Middle
Chest, Ren 17) in the
middle between the two nipples, called "]ianggong (Scarlet
Palace)"; but it is also believed by some to be located in the
navel.
Lower Dan/ian is located in the lower abdomen below
the navel of the human hody, usually the area in the upper 2/3
of the line joining the umbilicus and symphesis pubis.
It does
not refer to a certain point,but the area of the lower abdomen;
Lut some also believe it to be located at the acupoint Huiyin
(Converging lin, Ren 1) or Yongquan (Pouring Spring, K 1).
~o •
•
31
•

"Mind concentration on Dantian (Elixir Field)" in qigong
dirigation usually refers to the concentration on Lower Dan-
lian, sincc this area is most closely related to the life activities
of the human body.
Traditinal Chinese medical theory and
the Daoists botli believe that Lower Danlian is the starting point
of the circulation of the channel qi of the Ren Channel (the
Front Midline Channel), the Du Channel (the Back Midline
Channel) and the Chong Channel (the Vital Channel), to be
the pivot of the ascending, descending,
opening and closing
of the genuine qi, "the progenitor of life", "the foundation of
the five ~ang-organs and the six fu-organs", "the root of the
twelve channels", "the confluence ofyin andyang", "the gate of
respiration", "the country of the convergence ofwater and fire",
as well as the location where the male store the reproductive
essence and the female nourish the fetus.
So constant concen-
tration on Dantian (Elixir Field) can achieve the effects of
building up health, preventing and curing diseases.
Uppcr Dalltian is located in the head.
Those suffering
from sinking of qi of middk-jiao due to qi deficiency and head
aversion to wind and cold as well as cerebral anemia and
hypotension are advised to concentrate on Upper Dantian,
while those suffering from flaring-up of the heat-fire and hyper-
activity of the liver:yang as well as hypertension ought not
concentrate on Upper Dantian.
Those suffering from sinking
of the middle-jiao qi and women with hypermenorrhea are
advised to concentrate on Middle Danlian.
As mind concen-
tration on Middle Dantian is easy to cause chest distress, it
should be practised with care.
2) Three Passes.
The three passes are three places diffi-
cult for genuine qi to pass along the circulating route of the
Du Cllannd
(Back Midline Channel) in qigong dirigation.
Essentials of Great Achievements
says:
"On the back of the
human body there are three passes, namely, WeilH (Coccyx),
jiaji
(Clipping Spine) and Yu:chen
(Jade
Occiput)."

(Coccyx) Pass is just at the location of the acupoint Changqiang
(Long Strong, Du I), located at the lowest segment of the spine,
connecting the sacral bone on the above with the lower cnd
free on the posterosuperior of the anus.
]iaji (Clipping Spine)
Pass is at the bilateral sides of !'dingmen (Gate of Life, Du
4) on the back of the body.
Yuzhen (Jade Occiput) Pass is on
the back of the head below the acupoint Fcngfu (Windy Man-
sion, Du 16) and the occipital bone where the brain starts.

The Three Key Elements of Q(r;ong
m:lil1
9:~I'I''1=~~
QjgO/lg masters through the ages have built up from their
training practice rich experiences which are summarized as
the three key elements of "regulation of body", "regulation of
breathing" and "regulation of mind".
"Regulation of body"
rders to the adjustment of body pustures and relaxation exer-
cise; "regulation of breathing" refers to the exercise of respi-
ration and conducting qi; and "regulation of mind" refers to the
regul<ttion of mental activities: the exercise of mentl1 tran-
quiliz;:,tion and mind concentration.

tion and coordination of the three key elements in qigong
diri~
gation can guarantee a fruitful exercise of qigong.
1.
The Regulation of Body in Qjgong (Postures)
It is essential to assume suitable postures in qigong diri.
gatiUll.
Correct postures are the preconditions to guarantee
smocth respiration and induce mental relaxation
and
tran-
quilization. The tlH:Ory that "if the pGstures are not correct,
the flow of qi can not be smooth; if the flow of qi is not smooth,
the mind can not be concentrated; if the 11lind is not concentrat~
ed,
qi will be in disorder" shows the importance of the regu-
lation of body.
The postures commonly assumed are as 101-
lows:
I) Plain Sitting Posture.
Sit up straight on a sqare stool,
with the trunk and thighs, thighs and shanks in an angle or
90
0
respectively at the suitable height, the knees separated
shoulclcr·width apart, the feet firmly placeu on the floor, the
hands natur<'11y placed on the knees or thighs, the lower jaw
slightly drawn i;l, the shoulders relaxed and the chest slightly
drawn in, the mouth and eyes slightly closed, the tip of the
tongue raised against the hard palate and a smile on the face
(Sec Fig. I).
2) Free
Knee-Crossing
Posture.
Sit up
straight on a
wood bed with the legs crossed in the shape of the Chinese word
"J\."
(eight), ,itting naturally with the legs crossed, the hands
placed on the knees or with the fingers interlocked before the
lower abdomen, palms facing upward.
The postures of the
upper part of tl:e body, head and upper limbs are the same as
in Plain Sitting Posture (See Fig. 2).
3) Single Knee-Crossing Posture.
The posture is similar
to that in Free Knee-Cro"ing Posture.
The sale difference is
that the left (or right) shank is placed on the right (or left)
shank (Sec Fig. 3).
4) Supinl.: Lyit}g P0st~re. Lie on the back on a

senting a sloping position,
with the legs straightly strctened,
tile hands placed against the sides of both legs or on the If)''fcr
,tUdollll:n with one palm over the other (palms facing down-
ward).
The rcquir\_~menlsof the head are the same as in Plain
Sitting Posture (See Fig. 4).
5) LatcricUIllbcnl Lying Posture.
Lie
UIl
Lile side on a
wood beu with the head leveily pillowed, the upper part of the
body straight, the neek slightly bent lurward; the upper leg
bent on the lower leg which is n:twLllly stretched straight;
the upper hand placed on the but lock (palm facing downward),
the lower hand placed on the pillow (palm facing upward),
about 2 cun apart from the head.
The other requirements arc
the same as in the above [onu.
The right lateral recumbent
POSiliull is commonly adopted (See Fig. 5).
6) Standing 1\):;tu1'c.
Take the Tri-round-style Standing
Stump\!i.i for an example. Stand with the feet parallel to each
other and 3-4 foo(-widths apart (the space can be n:"gulatcd
in a("cordancc with the hei6"ht of the stance), head and neck
right straight, the lower jaw slightly drawn in, the chest slightly
drawn in and back erect, the hip rcldxcd and knees bent, the
eyes looking straight ahead or Sli~(ltly closed; the arms present-

7) Walking Posture.
Stand still for 2-3 minutes, then
left foot takes a step forward first, with the heel touching the
ground first, the upper part of the body and the hands swinging
to the right, inhale through the nose and exhale through the
mouth; when the left foot fully touches the ground, take the
right foot one step forward with the heel touching the ground
first, the upper part of he body and the arms swinging to the
left, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
Walk forward step by step as described above and end the exer-
cise after walking for about half an hour.
2.
The
Regulation of Breathing
in
Qjgong
(Respiration)
The regulation of breathing is the regulation and exercise
of re~piration.
It is a very important link in training gi, an
essential method to caUSe
genuine qi in the human body to
accumulate, initiate and circulate. The regulation of breathing
not only can achieve the effects of regulating the qi and blood
and massaging the internal organs of the organism but
is
also helpful to mental tranquilization and physical relaxation.
The breathing regulation methods commonly adopted are as
follows:
I) Natural
Respiration
Method.
Without
exertion
of
mindwil!, breathe natural!y.
2) Orthodromic Abdominl
Respiration
Method.
This
refers to the method of respiration in which the diaphragm
descends with the abdomen bulging out in inhalation and the
diaphragm rises with the abdomen drawn in in exhalation.
3) Counter-abdominal
Respiration
Method.
Contrary
to the above method, this refers to the method of respiration
in which the abdomen is drawn in in inhalation and bulges out
in c;;..halation.
4) Pausing-Closing ReSpiration Method.
This refers to
the respiration method which requires to pause and close qi

for a little while after each inhalation (exhalation) and then
exhale (inhale).
5) Nose-inhaling and Mouth-exhaling Method.
This re-
fers to the respiration method to inhale through the nose and
exhale through the mouth.
6) Reading-word
Respiration
Method.
This
refers
to
the method of respiration exercise to read silently word sounds
in coordination with exhalation.
7) Sole Breathing Method.
This refers to deep breathing.
In coordination with "mind concentration", conduct qi through
deep breathing to the acupoint Yongquan
(Pouring Spring,
K I) in the center of the sole while respiring.
8) Small
Heavenly
Circuit
Respiration
Method.
In
inhalation, the mindwill conducts qi to circulate from Baihui
(Hundred Convergences, Du 20) to Shanzhong (Middle Chest,
Rm 17)~Qidantian (Navel Elixir Field) ~ Huiyin (Converg-
ing Yin, Ren I); in exhalation, the mindwill conducts qi to
circulate from Huiyin (Converging Yin, Ren I) to Weigu (Co-
ccyx)~ Jiaji (Bilateral Sides of the Spine)
(Vertebrae)
~
Yuzhen
(Jade Occiput)
~ Baihui (Hundred
Convergences,
Du 20).
This respiration method to respire through the nose
and conduct qi to circulate through the Ren and Du Channels
in a circuit is also referred to as the"Method of Qj Circulation
Through Ren and Du Channels".
9) Genuine Breathing Method.
This refers to very gentle
abdominal breathing.
Viewed outwardly, respiration seems
to have stopped, but actually respiration is still going on through
the navel; it is revolving and pulsating inside the abdomen, so
it is also referred w as "Fetal Breathing Method".
This shows
that the exercise has reached a relatively higher level.
10) Latent Respiration Method.
A single
breath
takes
a relatively long time, the breathing being slow, gentle
ami
even, without obvious sensation. This is a highly advanced res-
piration lnethod.

II) Opening-closing Respiration
~Iethod.
Also referred
to as "Bodily Respiration Method", this is an exercise method
based on the foundation of "Fetal Breathing Method".
For
instance, as respiration goes on, fancy in the mind that the
sweat pores all over the body are opening and closing, as if all
the pores have the sensation of filling, permeating,.opening
and closing of "qi and breath".
So this is also referred to as
"Sweat Pore Respiration Method".
3.
The Regulation of Mind in Qjgong (Mind-
will)
The key link in the regulation of mind is to, through exer-
tion of mindwill, concentrate the mind,
get rid of all stray
thoughts, replace
myriads
of thonghts
with
one
thought,
thns
gradually
induce into
tranquilization
and
enter
a
state
of void.
This
is,
namely,
the
so-called
"training
the Iniml to return to
void".
This
is
the
most
essential
exercise in qigong dirigation.
The effect of the training prac-
tice is mainly determined by the degree of
tranquilization.
It is comparatively difficult for beginners to tranquilize.
The
tranquilizing methods commonly adopted are as follows:
I) Mind
Concentration
Method.
The mind is
highly
concentrated on certain part of the body, certain acupoint or
certain object outside the body, usually concentrated on Dan-
tian (Elixir Field). The concentration should be obscure, with-
out any
forceful
exertion,
relaxed and
natural,
being just
right.
2) Breath-following Method.
The mind
is highly con-
centrated on respiration, concentrated only on the rise and fall
of the abdominal respiration without the conduct of mindwill
so as to form a unification of mindwill and qi and reach a
tranqnil state of mind.
3) Breath-counting Method.
During the trailling p-ac-
tice, count silently the times of breath till the ear fails to hear,

the eyes rail to see and the mind fails to think thus naturally
reaching a tranquil state of mind.
4) Silent Reading Method.
Read silently certain single
word or phrasf", for instance, the two \\'ords "song (relax)"
allel "jing (tranquilize)",
one word for exhalation and inhala-
tion respcctively.
Its purpose is to replace. the myriads of
thoughts with one thought, replace all stray thoughts with the
orthodox thought, gradually aehie\'ing a state free from stray
thoughts and full of relaxation and joyousness, and comfortably
reaching a tranquil slate of mind.
S) Breath-listening i\.lethod.
Listen with the ear to one's
o\vn hreathing sound made by the passing current of respired
air.
It will be better to hear nothing.
III case nothing is
heard, it is advisable to fancy in the mind to listen so as to
help tranquilize.
6
"\lmtal Looking Method.
During the training prac-
tice, fancy in the mind to conduct one's eyes to look inwardly
at certain part inside one's own body or certain object outside
one's body so as to
induce into a tranquil state of mind.
Section Six
PrinCIples of Qigong Dirigation
Though
maneuvers of
qigong are many
and
diverse,
qigong dirigation shonld abide
by the following principles.
1.
Natural Relaxation an<1 Tranquilization
By "relaxation", it means during the trailling practice
there should bt' no mental tension, the limbs and body should
ue ltilly reldxcd and m;,intain c(Ttain qigong dii'igation state

zadOH and for qi to circlllate.
By "tranquilization", it means during the training practice,
it is necessary tu keep a peaceful and stable mood, get rid of
stray thoughts and tranquilize the mind so as to be suitable to
train "mind\vill".
Tranquilization is a specific tranquil state
under an awakening state.
Such a tranquil state is referred
to as "qigong state",
"'Relaxation"
and
"'tranquilization" arc interpromotive
and intcrinfluential. If "relaxation" is \vell realized, it will be
easy to tral1quilize; and haYing- tranquilized, it will be even more
easier to relax.
2.
Association of Activity and Tranquility
QjgOllg
is
divided
into
two
large
categuries: dynamic
qigong aud static qigollg.
Generally speaking, dynamic qigong
tends to resort to the nlOvcments of the limbs and body to con-
duct internal qi (neiqi) to flow and circulate; while static qigong
tends to resort to the function of rnind\vill to caus~ qi to gather
at Dantiall
(Elixir Field).
However,
when qigong dirigation
reaches certain degree, it i.s reg uircd
to
manage to achieve
"activity in tranquility" and "tranquility in activity", namely,
ill the practice or static qigong there should be activity of internal
qi \neiqi) as well as tranquility of the body; while in the practice
of dynamic qigong there should be relative tranquility of inter-
nal 'I' (nciqi).
'fhe practitioner should choose the dirigation methods
according to his own conditions.
As to the exercise of one
single maneuver, stress should be laid on the dynamic and
static assuciation of the body with internal qi (neiqi) so as to
achieve better training eRects.

qi in the upper part "I' liw body especially in the chest and head
should be void ,llJd :-;.harply sensitive, free and smooth, all qi
and
breathing should
head for
the root: sinking down to
Dan/ian (Elixir Field).
Lower repletion means
in the process
of qigong dirigatioll, qi in Lower Dantian should be replete and
substantial, with qi stored up in the lower part of the body.
Upper void and lower repletion are interrelated.
Only
by sending qi and breathing to their root with qi void and
sharply sensitive in the upper part of the body can qi in Lower
Dantian (Elixir Field) be replete and 3ubstantia!.
Upper void
and lower repletion are realized by following the transfer of
mindwil!.
Qj
reaches
wherever
mindwill
reaches.
There-
fore, during qigong dirigation mindwill can
not linger in the
upper part of the body hut should he emphatically stabalized
in the lower part.
Even in the exercise in qigong maneuvers
to conduct qi and breathing to circulate, qi should
not be
allowed to leave its root (Lower Elixir Field).
4.
InterfolIow of Mindwill and Qj
WMindwill(yi)" refers to the mental activities of the prac~
titioncr; "qi" refers to the genuine qi of the body, including the
tespired air and "internal qi (neiqi)" referred to by qigong prac-
titioners.
The interfollow of mindwill and qi means the prac-
titioner employs his mindwill to influence and train his
own
respiration and the movemcnt of internal qi (neiqi), combining
the actidtics of minclwill with the movements of qi and breathw
iIlg.
So it is also referred to as "unification of mindwill and
qi". During respiration exercise, respiration "should follow the
activities of minuwill to be slow and gentle, in a natural state
gradually training breathing to be gentle, thready, even and
decp.
When the internal qi (neigi) energy of the practitioner
has reached certain degree and internal qi (neiqi) can circulate
in the body, mindwill should naturally follow interIml gi (neigi)
to circulate through the channels, Lut not led by qi with any

5.
Moderate Training Durations and Degrees
Moderate training durations and degrees (huohou, literally
"fire control") refers to the training durations and degrees of
the practitioner's
qigollg dirigation.
Certain thcory formed
through qigong dil'igatiUll experience states that "fire" will be-
come "air-vapour" when scattered, become "fire" when con-
centrated and become "water" when dissolved; its function lies
in "condensing the one single qi so that genuine qi \vill not dis-
perse".
The application of "fire control" is classified into
"gentle fire tempering", "strong fire smelting'), starting, phy-
sical rest, priority or posterity, respite or urgency.
Each step
has its own duration and degree which vary in
accordance
\vith the changing conditions.
So nlOderate training dura-
tions and degrees of qigong dirigation actually refer to the
training limitations and lurning points in the different stages
and different levels of tIle training practice.
Generally the fol.
lowing aspects should be guaranteed: mindwill should be free
from
forcible
exertion)
neither [orgeting nor aiding; breath-
ing should be
natnwl,
slow,
steady and even,
allowing
qi and respiration to be lormcd in a natural state without being
conducted by mindwill with forcible exertion; postures should
be natural and relaxed, gentle and light, suitable and Corn-
furtable.
The training practice should be appropriate and ne-
ver be overdone so as to guar,dltce the accomplishments to grow
day by day.
6.
Concurr"nce of Training and Nourishing
"Trainillg" refers to the
manifesting
forms
of qi and
strength in Il1uliull under the guidance of consciousness in the
proccss of q(!;ong dirigation; while "nourishing" refers to the
replenishment of vigur and rncrgy after the training practice.

gUlll.· breathing is nourishingll clearly show: qigong dirigation
is Jlot practised through to the end with one form of conscious..
ness but \vith the concurrence of
training and nourishing.
For instance, if one feels tired during the training practice, he
can lay stress on the area of Dantian (Elixir
Field), station
mindwill at Dantian and regulate respiration to nourish quietly.
Only with alternation of training and nourishing, with nourish-
ing
in
training
and
training in nourishing to complement
each other, can the training quality be enhanced.
7.
Proceed in Order and Advance
Step by
Step
The practitioner should practise in the light of the prin-
ciples of qigong dirigation and the requirements of the maneu-
vers with no undue haste.
Haste will spoil relaxation and
tranquilizaion.
Qjgong is an exercise method with self-intro-
spection ano. perception to give play to one's initiative.
It can
not be expected to take eilect in one day or overnight.
Only
Wh(,il the training is practised according to certain procedures
can sure SUccess be yielded through const<.tIlt effort.
Section Seven
Time and Direction of Qigong DirigatlOn
Choosing a suitable time and directiun to conduct qigong
dirigation can enhance the training quality.
The time and
direction of qigong dirigation may not be vcry importar:t to
beginners, but practitioners who have reached certain degrec,

or

direction of qic~ong dirigation is neglected, it will be very easy
to cause the functional disturbance of the
activities of
qi,
iIubalancc ofyt'lz and yan,s or slow progress in qigong dirigation.
1.
TiIt1" of Qjgong Dirigation
I) Qj"ulIg Dirigation at Six Yang-Times: The six two-
hour p(riod~,J) in a day of zi, chou, yin, mao, chen and si (from 11
p.nL to 11 a,m.) arc the time when yang increases and yin de-
creases and when 'yan~ft-qi rises and expands.
It is benificial
tu jtl/lg-qi to train at this period of time. It is the most suitable
tr'linilig time for
those \vho exercise
maneuvers aiming at
emitting extrrnal qi (waiqi) and patients suffering [rom insuf~
ficicncy of]ang.
2) Qjgong Diri;:;ation at Six Yin-Times: The six two-hour
periods in a day or Wit, wei, shen, you, xu and hai (from 11 a.m.
to 11 p.m.) are referred to as yin·time when yin increases and
yang dccrcuscs and when yin-qi gradually exuberates.
It is
especially suitable for patients suffering from insufficiency of
ym.
3) Qjgong Dirigation at ,(i, Wu, Mao and You
Periods:
According to the law of the 12 informational clivinatory sym-
buls in Tile ZIIOU
Book of Changes,
qigong practitioners in
ancient timcs believed tLat the t\vo-hour periods of zl, WU, mao
andJou are IllOst suitable J:jr ql~5fOilg dirigation and are especially
imp(;rtant for the training of dan (elixir pellet, a metaphorical
term 1;)l' genuine qi) ami ,..[cumulation of qi.
This is because
<'i Period (11 p.m. tu 1 a.m.) is of one J{Ylg ZlllU five )'ins, lVu
Periuu. is of nne ]in and five .yangs, Mao Period is of four yangs
and two yins,
~~L.d You Period is of fouryins and two )!angs.
The
amount or number and advance or retreat of yin and yang
at these four periods present a geometrical symetrical balance,
\vhich
CJIl keep up the phy.':>iolociical Jin balance over yang
ill the u(jdy durhg qigong dirig~ltion and is favourable to
the
trailljj]g uf qi. So these foul' PlTicus arc regarded as ideal times
•

•

for qigong uirigatiu21.
4) Choice of
(JjgOfl,; Dlng-ation Time J"\cconling to Ha.
bits and Customs: Qjgong didgatiull can be conducted after
getting up, before sleep or after lunch.
It is mosi convenient for
some patients and beginners to adopt this method.
2.
Direction of Qjgong Dirigation
I) Directional Qjgong Dirigation According to the Four
Dirctions: The four directions refer to the east, the south, the
west and the north.
The cast is jia-yi® wood®, the south is
binp,ding fire, the west is geng-xin metal, and the north is ren-gai
water. The east and south are .J'ang directions while the
west
and north are )'in directions. Therefore, those with .J'ang insuf-
ficiency call face the cast or south to conduct qigong dirigation,
and those with yin insufficiency can face the north or west;
those with liver-deficiency can face the cast, those with lung-
deficiency can face the west, those with kidney.deficiency caIl
face the north and those with heart-deficiency can face the
sOllth.
2) Directional QjgOllg Dirigation According to the Sun,
Moon
and
Stars: Generally,
beginners can
conlluCl
q(e,ong
dirigation facing the direction of the moon or the Big Dipper
at night and
j~lcillg the direction of the sun in daytime.
The
ancients bdieved that the moon is of yin nature and shines
by reflecting the light of the sun; while the sun is ofyang nature
and can send forth enormous amount of thermal
energy.
It
is conducive to genuincyrang and genllinc)'in qi and is favourable
to good health or curing diseases to face the sun and the moon
to conduct ,Jigong dirigation.
3) Directional
Qjgong Dirigation According to Self Qj
Sensation: Owing to the influence c.fthe qi field of the universe:
on the qi field of the human budl', a well-trained qigong prac-
titioner can
pI'oduc~ strong qi effect in
certain directions.

Section Eight
The Effects of Qi
YVhat is generally called "the effects of qi" refers to the
sensational effects that emerged from the qi sensation felt by
q£gong practitioners, those who emit external qi (waiqi) to treat
otlIers, and patients respectively.
1.
The Practitioner's Effects of Qj
\V' hCIl qigv/I,g dirigation reaches certain stage, there will
appcar thc effects of qi which are described respectively as
follo" s:
I) Touching and
Moving Sensation.
When a
practi-
ttOIler conducts qigong dirigation, his body tends to have various
sensations, such as the phenomena of "eight touches" stated in
Acme of Children Enlightenment: "pain, itching, cold, warm,
lightncs:i, heaviness, astringency and slip", Of, "largeness, small-
ness, lightrlcss, heaviness, cold, heat, itching and tingling".
Of C'Jurse, there may appear still more qi effect phenomena
in the process of actual qigong training practice, such as spon-
taneous exercises and light sensation.
These phenomena are
all manifcstations of the well-trained skill and qigong accom-
plishments thereof,
free circulation of qi in the channels and
collaterals and the different forms of genuine qi to move inside
the body.
For example, when tranquilization is
achieved in
ql~£follg t:irigation, genuine qi is circulating freely, the capillaries
art' expanding and various parts of the body have filling and
expanding sensations, the practitioner will feel the body to be

the sensation of a vcry very small body; when genuine qi sir:ks

tioll of pleasant conJ; wlH'lTas when gl'w'i::e qi is vigorous
and thnlllaJ
~ncrgy is amassed, the parts of the body where
qi passes will han~ a hot sensation.
Itching of the skin and
scalp is aLa an iIlevitable process.
This is because the channels,
collakrals and nlinute cullaterais arc obstructed at ordinary
t iIll CS , once genuine qi circulates vigorously and passes through
them, there will appear the above·mentioned sensation. 1Jean-
while,
,"vhen genuillc qi passes through the
channels

The

which arc active auel conducive.
There should be no alarm
and panic if th'y occur and llO curiosity and pursuit for thenl
either.
As long as qig(;-,Ig dirigation is carried on peacefully
and calmly, they will disappear spontaneously in a period of
tinle.
2) Hot Sensation All over th" Body and Slight Perspira-

The practitioner
Call feel warm and hot all over his

accelerates while appetite
is \vhcttcd.
5) Itching of the Skin, Stir of the Muscles and Sounding
of the Joints.
This manifests that the functional activities of
qi in the uody arc ,-igorLJus and brisk.
Such phenomena tend
to be found at the terminals of the four limbs, lumbosacral
portioIlJ nuchal region or back of the body.
A~ a general rule
they can disappear naturally.
In case they tend to increase,
the practitioner can slightly distract his attention and tht·y will
he alle"iated aecordingly.
6) Light Sensation. When sitting qigong dirigation reaehes
certain degree,
there
may appear
flashing light hefore the
eyes, just like lightning, sometimes swaying to and fro like a
neon
light,
sometinlCS
piercing into
the
brain
glitteringly
through the spinal column, and sometimes there may appear
a light ball rotating at high speed through the Ren and Du
Channels, u.sually for three circuits.
The above phenomena
all disappear instantaneously.
If a pratitioner has achieved
a great deal of accomplislnncnts in qigong, a light ball or light
ucaIll may exist constantly at the acupoint Baihui (Hundred
Convergences, Du 20).
The degrees of light sensation
and
tile colours of the light vary in accordance with the degrees of
the practitioner's qigong accomplishments.
2.
The Qjgong Therapist's Effects of Qj Sensa.
tion
.
While emitting qi, the qigong therapist Can sense genuine
fjl and pathogenic qi insiue the body or at the region emitting
(-''-tcrnal qi (waiqi), and diagnose and treai diseases in accordance
hidl this effect of qi sensation.
I) The OJ Sensation of Genuine Qj; The tllerapi.Cl has
.<.jight hot, cuol, tingling, oppressing and tugging sensations
;([ thL reg-ien emitting external qi (waiqi) and can also sense
l:~C circuLHloIJ, density, direction and amount of his own
ql.

2) The Qj Sensation of Pathogenic Qj: Thi, is a qi sensa.
tiun perceived Ly the therapi:;t \",hen he receives the pathogenic
qi of the patient.
It Can be summarized to the following kinds:
(I) Cold and Chilly Sensation: This kind of pathogenic
qi is specifically cold and chilly so that the fingertips of the hand
emitting qi rapidly fed chilly and the chilly sen,ation is further
transmitted upwards;
shudder and contraction of
the
sweat
pores may even appear.
(2) Dry and Hot Sensation: The reflection of this kind of
pathogenic qi on the hands and body of the therapist is a dry
and hot sensation accompanied by irritation,
as if scorched
by fire.
(3) Aching and Tingling Sensation: When the therapist
receives this kind of pathogenic qi, certain parts of his body
may have an uncomfortable aching and tingling sensation.
(01) Filthy Sensation: When the therapist stands or sits
opposite to or emits qi towards the patient, the former can usual-
ly perceive this kind of pathogenic qi which gives a specifical-
ly filthy sensation beyond description.
(5) Others: In ancient times there were theories of dis-
eaSes due to five qi and six pathogenic factors. If the therapist
can sense the pathogenic qi of joy, anger and others, he can
also respond to them.
This requires the therapist to perceive
carefully.
3.
The Patient's Effects of Qj Sensa'i:ion
When the therapist emits qi towards the patient to treat
diseases, most patients can produce some effects of qi.
I) The Effects of Qj Sensation: When the therapist emits
qi to treat diseases, Some patients can instantly or gradually
produce in local parts radioactive sensation or touching sens-
ation of qi as felt in qigong dirigation, such as cold, hot, oppress-
ing, tugging, creeping, tingling, heavy, light, floating, sinking
and other sensations.

resulting from channd-qi's circulating and acting on the foci,
among which cold, hot, tingling, oppressing and tugging sen·
sations are the commonest.
2) Dynamic Effects: When the therapist emits qi to treat
diseases, involuntary dynamic phenomena can appear on the
patient instantly or gradually in local parts of the limbs or the
whole body.
In some cases the muscles slightly stir, while
in other cases the limbs or the body perform drastic movements.
This is a phenomenon of "external qi (waiqi)" inducing spon-
taneous movements.
3) Photoelectric Effcct: \Vhen some patients have received
"external qi (waiqi)", there may appear photodectricpheno-
mena.
In some cases they are manifested as electric sensation
in the limbs and body, and in other cases light patterns can be
seen in different forms, most of which present round,
sheet
light or lightning patterns.
4) Sound Effect: When some patients receive external qi
(waiqi) treatment, they can hear some sounds or noises, such
as the sounds of "lala (rustling sound)", "longlong (rumbling
sound)" and "zizi (squeaking sound)".
5) Smell Effect: When some patients receive external qi
(waiqi) treatment, they can scent a specific kind of smell and
give various responses, for example, presenting the sweet scent
of sandalwood or fragrances of various flowers.
6) Syncope due to Qj: When receiving external qi (waiqi)
treatment, a few patients may suffer from perspiration and heart
rate acceleration, followed by syncope like fainting during acu-
puncture.
When
such
phenomenon
occurs,
the
therapist
can slightly percuss the patient's acupoints Baihui (Hundred
Convergences, Du 20), Mingmen (Gate of Lite, Du +), Jian-
jing (Shoulder Well, GB, 21) and Yintang (Glabella, Extra I),
grasp ]iangjing (Shoulder Well, GB 21), then emit qi alnng
the Ren and Du Channels to conduct the patient's qi and induce
it to return to its root, and the patient will gradually recover.

The iliness of son1C patients can even obviously mend after a
syncope.
Among the above-mentioned phenomena of effects, the
phenOlncnon of qi sensation is the commonest; dynamic phe-
nomenon is relatively seldom seen, and the others are even more
seldom seen.
Some patients have no effects of qi sensation
when receiving external qi (waiqi) treatment, but they can also
achieve good therapeutic effects.

Points for Attention in Qigonj!, Dirigation
1.
Points for Attention Before the Training
Practice
I) Concentrate the mind, stabalize the mood, kecp ease
uf mind and be carefree.
2) Choose as far as possible a quiet and peaeefnl place,
\vithout noises or strongly irritant abnormal odors in the sur-
roundings, with proper light, fresh air and attractive scenery.
3) Relieve nature before the training practice.
4) The clothes should be loose and fit, with soft colours
and lustrous and
SpOlI!~"Jr rnaterial.
5) If one feels indisposed or tired after a journey, he can
sell~rnassage the indisposed places. If the hair fcels nncomfort-
able, one should have frcquent haircuts, have baths and change
clothes frequently, and form a good hygienic habit.
6) The training facilities and appliances should
be suit-
able. The height and hardness of the bed, chairs, beddinl'( and

Points for Attention During the Training
Practice
I) Determine
the
Training
Direction.
Standing
and
sitting forms normally face the south with thc back to the north;
in lying forms, normally the head lies in the south with the
feet in the north.
2) Take senTal deep breaths,
relax the body and relieve
the mind, get rid of stray thoughts and concentrate on Dantian
(Elixir Field).
3) Breathing should be natural, free and smooth, slow and
gentle.
Respiration exercises should be conducted on the fonn-
dation of tranquilization.
One can adopt abdominal respi-
ration,
deep
abdominal respiration,
mixed respiration and
others according to the training requirements.
4) As for the hallucinations emerging in tranquilization,
there should be no nervousness, no pursuit, no association and
no alarm or panic.
Regard them with equanimity.
5) Regulate uncomfortable postures whenever necessary.
Local cold, hot, toughing and itching sensations, if not caused
by insect bites or stings or unbearably painful, should be left
alone to alleviate naturally.
6) If saliva increases during the training practice, swallow
the saliva in three times.
Never spit it.
7) If the body feels tired during the training practice, one
can concentrate the mind on Dan/ian (Elixir Field) to rest for
a short while or respire freely and relaxedly.
8) There should be no alarm or panic in case of sudden
and drastic provokations during the traiuing practice.
One
can first regulate respiration and employ mindwill to conduct
qi tu return (u Dal/fi,m (Elixir Field).
If it is ascertained that
there is no direct danger to the body, one can go on ,ddl
lht~

training or close the training practice according to the closIng
requirements.
3.
Points for Attention when the Training
Practice Closes
1) Conduct qi to Dantian (Elixir Field) when the training
practice is to be closed.
If there is too much saliva in the
mouth, one can first rinse the mouth for several times and swal-
low the saliva, then take several fresh breaths, slowly open
the eyes, and finally stand up and limber up the limbs and
body.
2) In the case of static qigong, one can do several sections
of massage or limber up; in the case of dynamic qigong, one can
go out and take a walk, then take several deep breaths, stretch
the back and limbs and remain quiet for a while before engag-
ing ill other activities.
4.
Points for Attention for Those EJDitting
External Qi
I) As emitting external qi (waiqi) to treat diseases can
consume the therapist's energy, the emitting time ought not
to be too long and the number of patients treated ought not
to be too large.
One should control the emission by oneself
in accordance with one's own qigong accomplishments and health
conditions and take good care to replenish nutritions as well.
2) If the therapist catches cold or sufIers [[om other dis-
eases or feels tired and indispused, it is inadvisable to emit exter M
nal qi (waiqi) to treat diseases.
3) It is inadvisable to emit external qi (waiqi) to treat
diseases when starved, overfed, drunk or in circumstances of
1l1lSlalJle wouds sudl as violellt joy, overwhdllling sorrow or
towering rage.

Section One
Static Qigong
Relaxation Qjgong
Relaxation Qjgong aims at regulating the whole body into
a relaxed, comfortable and natural state through a step-by_
step and rhythmical relaxation of all parts of the body cOor-
dinated by silently reading the "song (relax)"-character for-
mula.
This maneuver has the functions of activating qi and
blood, coordinating the internal organs, dredging the chan-
nels and collaterals, strengthening health, preventing and cur-
ing diseases.
I. Preparations: Assume the standing, sitting or lying
posture, with the tongue-tip raised against the hard palate,
the eyes slightly drooping, the chest slightly drawn in and the
back erect.
Regulate breathing and
concentrate
the mind
on Dantian (Elixir Field).
2. Tn-route relaxation
Method:
Tri-route
Relaxation
Method can be conducted on the foundation of ready prepara-
tions.
(I) The Routes of Relaxation
The first route: From the bilateral sides of the head, the
bilateral sides of the neck, shoulders, upper arms,
elbows,
fore-arms, wrists and two hands to the ten fingers.
The second route: From the face, neck, chest, abdomen,

two thighs, knees, shanks and two feet to the ten toes.
The third route: From the back of the head, posterior nape,
back, waist, posterior parts of both thighs, two popliteal fossae,
two shanks and two feet to the soles of both feet.
(2) Method of Relaxation
First relax from the first route, going on from above to
below.
Having finished
the first
route,
go on
to the Se-
cond and third routes.
Generally, first focus on one location
of one route and silently read the word "song (relax)" (without
any sound), then focus on the next location.
Relax in this
way link by link, route by route, for 3-5 cycles altogether.
3. Method of Local Relaxation: On the foundation of
the relaxation of the three route" the relaxation of certain part
of the body can be carried out individually, such as the relaxa-
tion of the tension points and the locations of diseases and
pains.
Concentrate the mind on these locations and silently
read the word "song (relax)" for 20--30 times.
4. Method of Whole-Body Relaxation
Regard the whole body as a point to relax.
One can read
silently to effect a general one-shot relaxation from the head
to the feet; or silently meditate to fly and fall from a high place
to relax or silently meditate to relax downwards continuously
like water flowing along the routes of the Tri-route Relaxa-
tion Method.
Inner-Nourishiug Qjgong
Inner-Nourishing Qjgong is a maneuver featured by the
coordination of silent reading of words Or phrases with respi-
ration exercise.
It has fairly good regulating effects on the
functional activities of the nervous, circulatory and digestive
systems.
I. Preparations: The lying and plain sitting postures
are the most suitable.
Just before the training practice, drink
a small amount of boiled water, loosen the clothes and belt,

get rid of all stray thoughts and relax the mind.
2. Coordinate silent reading of \vords, phrases or sentences
with
,respiration
exercise.
The
phrases
or
sentences
for
silent reading generally
b~gi.n fron1 three Chinese characters,
to be increased gradually as 1ime goes on, but ought not ex-
ceed ten characters at
most. The content of the phrases or
sentences are usually relateu to qigollg dirigation, such as ";d
ji jing (tranquilize by myself)", "neng gou song jing (I can relax
and tranquilize)", "jing zuo shen ti ke yi jion kang (Sitting still
leads to good health)" and the like.
The method of respira-
tion is: inhale when silently reading the first word; hold one's
breath when silently reading the middle word or words, the
more the middle words are, the longer the time of holding
breath is; exhale when silently reading the final word.
3. Adopt abdominal respiration method: When inhaling,
raise the tongue against the hard palate, naturally conduct
qi to the lower abdomen and imagine in the mind "Qj sinks to
Dantian (Elixir Field)". When exhaling, detach the tongue
from the hard palate so as to allow air to go out naturally.
During the practice of the above method, attention should be
paid to inhalation rather than exhalation.
Roborant Qjgong
Roborant Qjgong is a maneuver to train by regulating
respiration and concentrating the mind on Dantian (Elixir
Field).
It can strengthen and invigorate internal qi (neiqi)
and achieve the goals of keeping good health, preventing
and curing diseases.
1. Postures: It is allowable to assume the standing, the
single crossing, the double crossing or the natural crossing pos-
ture, among which the standing one is the most suitable.
2. Preparations: Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart,
the chest slightly drawn in and the back erect, the head raised
np with the ueck upright, the mouth and lips slightly closed,

the tongue raised against the hard palate, the shoulders relax-
ed
and
elbows dropped, both hands placed in front of the
chest (15-20 ern apart) as if holding a ball, the wrists slightly
hent and the fingers
extended,
breathing regulated to be
even, mind concentrated on Danlian (Elixir Field) or on cer-
tain object outside the body.
Be self-confident that one's
physical strength is mighty and powerful, and exercise with a
strength which can "pull up a mountain".
3. During the training practice, thought should be focus-
ed
with the mind concentrating on Dantian (Elixir Field);
but the concentration itself should be obscure.
Relax spirit-
ually and be free from tension.
As to the aspect of respiration, transit gradually from na-
tural respiration and deep respiration to abdominal respira-
tion. Breathing should be trained to be deep, gentle, even and
long;
then on
this
foundation
conduct counter-abdominal
respiration to muster and replenish the qi of Dantian
(Elixir
Field).

Heavenly Circuit Qjgong
Heavenly Circuit Qjgong, also referred to as Large and
Small
Heavenly
Circuits
Qjgong
or
Inner
Elixir
Pellet
Prowess, is an important maneuver to rehabilitate and protect
health as well as prolong life.
It can also be used to treat some
chronic diseases. Here the training method of Small Heavenly
Circuit Qjgong is introduced.
I. Preparations: Assume the leg-crossed sitting or the plain
sitting posture, with the chest slightly drawn in and the spine
erect, the head raised and the shoulders relaxed, both eyes
slightly closed and the tongue tip raised against the hard
palate.
Regulate respiration and get rid of stray thoughts.
2. First adopt orthodromic abdominal respiration; when
gradually
well-trained,
further
practise
counter-abdominal
respiration, concentrate the mind on Dantlall (Elixir Field).

Breathing should be regulated to bc thready, soft, continuous,
deep and long; the mind is conccntrated on Dantian (Elixir
FicId), but not rigidly concentrated. The rise and fall, ascent
and
descent of the
abdominal muscles coordinate closely
with respiration, with being active and comfortable as the
governing principle.
3. Through a period of training, a Current of warm qi
will be gradually amassed and increased.
When qi has accu-
mu lated to a remarkable extent, there will naturally appear
a sensation of the flow of warm qi.
At this timc, mindwill
follows the flowing qi current, starting from Dantian (Elixir
Field), through Huiyin (Converging Yin, Ren I), along the
Du Channel, via the coccygeal end, right up to the vertex of
the head, then down to the face, descend to the chest and ab-
domen along the Ren Channel, and return to Dantian (Elixir
Field): forming one cycle of small heavenly circuit.
4. vVhen the training practice is finished, concentrate
thc mind on Dantian (Elixir Field) for a while, allow qi to re-
turn to its root, then rub the hands and face for sevcral times,
and closc the training.
Heavenly Circuit Self-Rotation Qjgong
Hcavcnly Circuit Self-Rotation Qjgong, also referred to
as Magic Whcel Self-Rotation
or
Yard
Circulation,
is
a
lllancuver which takes the navel as the centef, coordinates
silent reading of words or sentences with mindwill and rl'spi-
ration to conduct qi to circulate and circuit.
It can be used
to rehabilitate and protect health as well as treat chronic dis-
eases.
I. Preparations: Assume the sitting or the supine lying
posture, relax the whole body, breathe naturally, raise the
tongue tip against the hard palate, and concentrate the mind
on the area of the navel.
2. Take the navel as the ccntef, when inlJ<diflg, z:tr!;':-r: '

gers grasping the thumb.
When inhaling, draw up the anus,
press the coccyx, bend the toes, make a fist of the right hand,
raise the tongue against the hard palate, conduct qi with mind-
will to flow from the balanus along the Du Channel to Baihui
(Hundred Convergences, Du 20); when exhaling, relax the
whole body and relax the hands, toes, anus and tongue at the
same time, conduct qi with mindwill to descend along the Ren
Channel from Baihui (Hundred Convergences, Du 20)
to
Dantian (Elixir Field).
Conduct qi in this way for 6 or 18
breaths (See Fig. II).
3. Supine lying posture.
Both upper limbs are placcd
naturally
against the sides of the body,
the thumbs nip-
ping the ring finger bases and the hands making fists, with the
legs straight stretched.
When inhaling, the toes of both feet
make efforts to bent; draw up the anus, draw in the abdomen,
raise the tongue against the hard palate, make fists, conduct
qi with mindwill to flow by might from the balanus to the Du
Channel along which to the back of the head and right up to
the headtop; when exhaling, relax the waist, legs, hands and
feet unhurriedly, relax the abdomen and anus, conduct qi
with mindwill to descend along the Ren Channel down to the
energy sea, turn the palms over to conduct qi until yang wanes.
Relax the whole body, concentrate the mind on Dantian (Eli-
xir Field) and close the training.

important maneuver by which the ancients absorbed the essenee
and cream of the sun and the moon to tonify yang and re-
plenish yin, in which gathering Sun eSSence can replenish yang-
qi while taking moon cream can tonifYyin-essence.
I. Gathering Sun Essence Method
(I) Preparations: Assume the standing posture with the
feet shoulder-width apart, stand in a relaxed and tranquil
state, regulate breathing to be even, get rid of stray thoughts
while facing the sun.
(2) When the sun rises from the horizon, slightly droop
the eyelids, but still able to see the soft gentle reddish sunlight,
inhale through the nose, inhaling the qi of the sunlight essence,
and breathe in one mouthful of it (imagine this in the mind),
hold breath and concentrate the mind, swallow it slowly with
exhalation and send it to Dantian (Elixir Field): this process
forms one time of the training.
Swallow in this way for ten
times.
(3) Then naturally relax and tranquilize, concentrate the
mind peacefully for a short while and then naturally limber up
for a moment.
After that, close the training.
2. Gathering Moon Cream Qjgong
(I) Preparations: At night, find an open place with fresh
air, stand in a relaxed and tranquilized state, regulate breath-
ing to be
even,
get rid of stray thoughts while facing the
moon.
(2) Then droop the eyelids to the extent of faintly seeing
the moonlight, inha~e through the mouth and nose, softly in-
haling the moon cream and breathing in one mouthful of it
(imagine this in the mind), slightly hold breath and concen-
trate the mind, swallow it slowly and send it to Dantian (Elixir
Field): this process forms one time of the training.
Do this
6 times ahogether.
(3) Finally, concentrate peacefully for a short while, then
naturally limber up for a moment and close the training.

Six-Character Formula
Six-CharilctcrFurl11ula is a maneuver to coordinate with
silently reading six words cooperated by the limbs and body to
conduct qi
dudn,~ the process of respiration exercise.
This
maneuver can
al~TJ lw used as a static qigong maneuver aimed
mainly at exhalatiun exercise solely.
The six words are: xu,
ke, hu, si, chui and xi.
I. Preparatory
position:
Assume the natural standing
posture (the detailed requirements of which
are
omitted).
Begin from the preparatory form for every change to a new
word.
2. Respiration method: Adopt nose-inhaling and mouth-
exhaling orthodromic abdominal respiration.
When exhaling,
read the word, at the same time draw in the abdomen, draw up
the anus, shrink the shoulders, with the feet slightly purChasing
the ground, the body weight shifted backward to both heels;
when inhaling, close the mouth, raise the tongue against the
hard palate and shift the body weight to the anterior sales of
the feet.
3. Breathing regulation: Inhale and exhale through the
nose.
\\Then inhaling, slowly raise both arms forward and up-
ward from the body sides with the palms facing downward to
shoulder level, turn the palms up, bend the elbows to make a
curve respectively toward before the chest and exhale at the Same
time; the hands press downward before the face along the
body to the abdomen, then separate apart to the sides of the legs
and return to the preparatory posture (See Fig. 12). Regulate
breathing for three times in the preparatory form and after
the exercise of the six words.
One time of breathing regula-
tion is required after the exercise of each word and before the
exercise of the next word.

The two hands overlap with the inner acupoint Laogong
(Labored Palace, P 8) of one hand over the outer acupoint
Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8) of another (with left hand in-
side for males and right hand inside for females), the acupoint
Yuji (Thenar Prominence, Lu 10) pressing against the navel
and the acupoint Lao~ong (Labored Palace, P 8) pointing at
the umbilical Dautiar; (Elixir Field)
(See Fig.
13).
When
exhaling, read the word "xu" (the two lips are slightly brought
together, the tongue tip strelehes forward with the lateral
sides slightly curling toward the middle), at the same time wide
open the eyes and look inwardly at the hepatic region.
Ex-
hale completely and then inhale.
Do 6 times altogether.
When exhaling, conduct qi with mindwill.
The channel
qi of the Liver Channel flows upward from the acupoint Da-
dun (Great Mound, Liv I) on the lateral portions of the big
toes of the feet, through the lower abdomen, linking the gall-
bladder and into the lung, upward to the throat, eyes, forehead,
to the acupoint Baihui (Hundred Convergences, Du 20); links
the Lung Channel and flows downward to the acupoint Shao-
shang (Young Shang, Lu II) on the medial portions of the
thumbs of the hands.
(2) The Word "Ke" Replenishes the Heart
The movements are the Same as those in the regulation of
breathing (See Fig. 12).
While coordinating with respiration,
raise both hands to shoulder level, inhale when turning the
palms up; the two hands make a curve respectively in front
of the chest and read the word "ke" (the mouth is half closed
with the tongue placed against the mandible).
Exhale com-
pletely and then assume the preparatory position.
Do 6 times
altogether.
When exhaling, conduct qi with mindwill.
The channel
qi of the Spleen Channel flows from the acupoint Yinbai (Hid-
den White, Sp I) on the medial portions of the big toes of the

men and meets with the Chong Channel (Vital Channel), Into
the heart, past the lung, gets out from the armpits, along the
inner portions of the arms down to the acupoint Shaochong
(Little Rush, H 9) on the medial portions of the little fingers
of the hands.
(3) The 'Nunl "Hu" Strengthens the Spleen
Following the preparatory position and accompanying
inhalation, raise both hands upwards before the abdomen up
to in front of the chest; the right arm revolves inward, the palm
turns over and pushes up to form the posture of propping the
sky with one single arm (the palm facing up, the fingertips
pointing to the left), at the same time exhale and read the word
"hu" (the lips are brought together in a tubular form,
the
tongue is levelled and stretched forward as much as possible
to allow the ascending qi of the Chong Channel to gush out),
meanwhile the left palm turns downward, pressing naturally
down to the side of the left hip of the body (See Fig. 14) and
exhale
completely.
Then,
accompanying
inhalation,
the
right arm revolves outward, the palm turns over, facing back-
ward, and descends slowly along before the body; meanwhile
the left arm revolves outward with the fingers pointing upward
and shuttles along the body up to before the chest where the
two arms cross with each other (with the up-shuttling arm in-
side and the descending arm outside); then the two arms se-
parate; the left hand pushes up, the right hand presses down
(the requirements are the same as the above ones), at the same
time exhale and read the word "hu".

Iron Crotch Qjgong is an important maneuver used in
ancient China to train the lower parts of the body. It has the
functions of nourishing the kidney and strengtheningyang, sup_
plementing qi and enriching the essence as well as strengthening
health. In modern times the maneuver is applied to the health
protection of the middle-aged and
aged people as well
as
the prevention and treatment of diseases and syndromes such as
impotence, premature ejaculation, seminal emission and male
infertility, and has proved to have marked effects.
I. Push the abdomen:
Lie on the back, relax the whole
body, breathe evenly, get rid of stray thoughts (the same here-
inafter), overlap the two hands (with the right hand over the
left one), push and rub from the region of the xiphoid process
to the junction of the pubic bon.,. (See Fig. 56) 36 times.
When
Irou Crotch Qjgong
Follow the ahove movement, relax the whole body, breathe
naturally,
take the waist as an axis and swing the shoulders
in a route resembling the figure .. co". Males turn leftward
first and females turn rightward first.
Do 8 times to the left
and right respectively (See Fig. 54) or the multiplcs of 8.
In-
crease according to one's own actual conditions.
4. Shake stumps with the
round-crotch posture:
Stand
with the feet slightly wider apart than in the above form, draw
both legs in, draw in the muscles with slight force, bring the
knees slightly close to each other, presenting a round-crotch form
(See Fig. 55).
Breathe naturally, slightly close the eyes and re-
lax the masseter, with the lower abdomen drwan in, which is
similar to the position of restraining motions. Slightly bend and
stretch the knees to bring along the body to shake up and down;
the upper and lower teeth knock each other lightly with clicking
sounds; allow the private parts to vibrate, swing, open and close
on their own.
Practise 5-10 minutes each time, or increase
the time according to one's own physical conditions.

the hands push downward, inhale slowly and, along with the
pushing of the hands, mindwill pays attention to perceive the
induction underneath the hands. It has the functions ofstreng-
thening the spleen and stomach and directing genuine qi to
flow to Dantian (Elixir Field).
2. Part the abdomen:
Lie on the back, push with both
hands from the region of the xiphoid process asunder to both
sides of the abdomen 36 times (See Fig. 57).
When pushing
asunder downward, inhale slowly and pay attention to perceive
the induction underneath the palms.
It has the functions
of regulating the stomach and promoting digestion as well as
regulating the flow of qi and strengthening the spleen.
3. Press and knead the navel:
Lie on the back, overlap
the two hands (with the right hand over the left one), knead the
navel in circular motion left and right 36 times respectively
(See Fig.
58).
Breathe naturally and pay attention to the
induction nnderneath the palms. It has the functions ofstreng-
thening the spleen, reinforcing thestomach and warming yang
to dispel cold. In case of touching any gelosis in the abdomen
(usually nnder thc navel), one will know that it may be due to
stagnancy of qi and blood stasis which accumulate and fail to
disperse.
It is advised to press against the gelosis with the in-
dex, middle and ring fingers and knead it for a long time and for
countless times, and employ mindwill to exhale qi to the gelosis
so as to dredge the channels and collaterals, remove the stag-
nancy of qi and disperse the accumulation of pathogens.
4. Twist the spermatic cord with the fingers:
Assume the
sitting posture.
Symmetrize the forefingers,
middle fingers
and thumbs of the two hands respectively, hold up the spermatic
cords at both sides of the root of the penis with the fingers and
twist left and right 50 times respectively. Relax the whole body,
breathe naturally and pay attention to the induction produced
by twisting the spermatic cords with the two hands until there
is a slight aching and distending sensation and a comfortable

feeling. It has the functions ofsoothing the liver and regulating
qi as well as invigorating the functional activities of qi.
As the
hand manipulation can directly stimulate the spermatic ducts,
the blood vessels, the ncrves, the lymphatic vessels and other
tissues in the spermatic cords, it can improve their functions.
5. Knead the testicles: Assume the sitting posture. Use
the right hand to clasp the scrotum and penis together with the
part of Ihe hand between the thumb and forefinger facing for-
ward, leaving the scrotum and testicles outside the part between
the thumb and forefinger, and grasp the root portions of the
scrotum and testicles tightly. First press the hollow of the Lft
palm on the testicle at the left side and knead it 50 times, then
change hands and knead the testicle at the right side in the
same way 50 times.
Breathe naturally and focus the mind at
the hollow of the palm kneading the testicle.
6. Twist the testicles between the fingers: Assume the sit-
ting posture.
Usc the palmar sides of the forefinger and middle
finger of each hand to prop up the inferior part of the testicle
on the identical side respectively, then press the thumbs on the
testicles respectively and rub them between the fingers left and
right 50 times.
7. Jack the testicles:
Assume the sitting posture.
Use
the palmar sides of the forefinger and middle fmger ofeach hand
to prop up the testicle on the identical side respectively, then use
Ihe ends of the fingers to jack up the testicles toward the direc-
tions of the groins and then drop down.
Do 3 times altogether.
Inhale slowly when jacking up and exhale slowly when dropping
down.
It will be enough when the location of the groins has
a slight expanding and distending sensation.
Do not exert
too much pressure. The above three sections of kneading, twist.
ing and jacking the testicles have the functions of promoting
the formation of sperms and the secretion of male sex hormone.
It is an important maneuver to strenjithen the fire ofHfe gate
and thus reinforce the kidneY:J'ang and replenish essence qi.

8. Weigh down the crotch:
Stand with the feet shoulder-
width apart.
Put the prepared sand bag and gauze
band
on a bed or stool, and make a slipknot on the gauze band to
prepare it for use.
Then use one hand to clasp the penis and
scrotum together, put the slipknot of the gauze band round the
root parts of the scrotum and penis and tie it up with a proper
degree of tightness, leaving the pubes out, and make the two
strands of the gauze band under the tied knot equally long. Fi-
nally, slowly let down the sand bag (See Fig. 59), swing forward
and backward 50 times, breathe naturally (it is forbidden to apply
abdominal respiration), with the penis and testicles congest-
ed, slightly aching and distending, the bilateral groins and
even the renal regions having a slight aching, distending and
tugging sensation but without pain as suitaLle.
This section
exerts a comprehensive stimulation on the testicles, epididymi-
des, penis, scrotum, spermatic ducts, prostate glands as well as
the pudendal nerves, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and other
tissues of the male genital organs. It can make)he whole puden-
dal region exuberant with qi and blood, improve its nourishment
and promote its functions.
It has the effects of nourishing the
urogenital region, replenishing essence qi and strengthening the
fire of life.

ofthe fist and the other hand pounds the back under the scapulae
with the dorsum of the fist, 50 times for the left and right sides
respectively (See Fig. 61). This section has the fuction of dredg-
ing the channels
and collaterals of the whole body and distri-
buting qi and blood all over the body.
12. Turn round iDe knees: Stand with the feet together and
knees slightly bent.
Press the palms on the knees and circle
the knees leftward and rightward 25 times respectively (See Fig.
62). It has the functions of promoting the flow of the channel qi

functions of conducting qi to descend and directing fire to return
to its Source.
14. Close the training: Place both hands naturally on the
thighs, stand still for a while, then rub the face and hands,
stand up and do some limbering-up activities, then it will be
suitable to close the training.
The purpose of closing the train-
ing is to return qi and blood to their root and prevent the dis-
order of the mental activities.

tbighs, down to the
feet.
Then gradually straighten the waist, hoth hands look like
clasping heavy weights; meanwhile conduct the qi of the Three
Yang Channels of the Foot to the soles and into the acupoints
Yongauan (Pouring Spring, K I), then along the Three rin
Channels of the Foot through the lower limbs to the abdomen
and to the chest.
3. Follow the above movement.
Both hands change from
fists into palms, stretch out forward and upward till both arms
are straight stretched.
Meanwhile conduct with mindwill the
qi of the Three rin Channels of the Foot to flow up to the
chest, then along the Three Yin Channels of the Hand to the
upper limbs and into the inner acupoints Laogong (Labored
Palace, P 8).
Then draw both hands back to before the chest, mean-
while conduct with mindwill the qi of the Three rin Channels
of the Hand to transfer from the inner acupoints Laogong
(Labored Palace, P 8) to the outer acupoints Laogong (La-
bored Palace, P 8) and flow along the Three Yang Channels
of the Hand up to the shoulders and the head.
Then clench
both hands into fists and conduct the qi ofthe Three Yang Chan-
nels of the Foot to descend.
Cycle in this way for 36 circles.
To coordinate with respiration in the exercise, exhale when

rijinjing (Changing Tendons Qjgong)
rijirU'illg (Changing Tendons Qjngong) is a form of fitne&
exercise handed down from ancient China.
Legend has it
that this maneuver aims at strengthening the muscles and ten-
dons.
In Chinese, ')iiI' means change,
"jilt" means tendons
and
sinews,
while "jing"
means method.
By ''yijinjing'' it
means the exercise of this maneuver can turn flaccid and frail
tendons amI sinews into strong and sturdy ones.
Yijinjing
(Changing Tendons Qjgong) pays great attention to the co-
ordinated exercise of the movements, respiration and mindwill So
as to guarantee that qi circulates and flows appropriately with-
out such abnornlal phenomena as tardiness, haste, obstruction
and stagnancy.
It is an advanced maneuver to protect and
strengthen health as well as one of the elementary meneuvers
to effect the emission of external qi (waiqi).
I. Skanda Presents the Pestle
(I) The left foot takes one step to the left to make the feet
shoulder-width apart, both hands naturally hanging down, the
head upright and both eyes half closed.
Look straight ahead,
raise the tonguetip against the hard palate, relax the shoulders
and drop the elbows, draw in the chest and keep the back erect,
draw in the abdomen and relax the hips with the knees relaxed
and slightly bent and the soles firmly placed on the ground.
Relax the whole body, breathe naturally, rid the mind of all
distractions and hold in the spirit.
(2) Both hands turn into palms facing downward and rise
slowly sideways to shoulder level, then the palms turn over to
face forward anq move slowly towards each other to gather in
front of the chest with the hollows of both palms pointing at
each other; the elbows bend slowly, the acupoints Shaoshang
(Young Shang, Lu II) of both thumbs slightly touch each other,
the palms lightly press each other in front of the chest, with the

fingers turned upward and the tips of the thumbs pointing at the
chest.
Relax the shoulders and drop the elbows, apply ab-
dominal respiration and sink qi to Dantian (Elixir Field).
When
the flow of qi is felt, let mindwill accompany respiration.
When
inhaling, conduct qi to come out from the fingertips,
enter
the nose and sink to Dantian (Elixir Field).
When exhaling,
conduct qi to ascend from Dantian (Elixir Field) to the chest,
along the Three rin Channels of the Hand to the palms and into
the fingers (See Fig. 75).
2. Hold the Subduing-Demon Pestle Horizontally
(I) Follow the posture of the above movement (2).
(2) Slowly turn both palms over to face downward, draw
the palms asunder to the left and right respectively, forming a
horizontal line at shoulder level, meanwhile slightly lift the
heels and stand on the tiptoes (stand on the tips of the great toes
alone when one has reached an advanced level), look forward
with rapt attention, draw in the chest and erect the back, draw
in the abdom en and relax the hips, and raise the tonguetip
against the hard palate (See Fig. 76). Breathe naturally, con-
centrate the mind on the acupoints Laogong (Labored Palace,
P 8) of both hands and on the toes of the feet.
When well-
trained, change to abdominal respiration.
When inhaling,
concentrate the mind on Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8); when
exhaling, concentrate the mind on the great toes of the feet.
3. The Palms Prop up the Heavenly Gate
(1) Follow the posture of the above movement (2).

as if propping up the sky.
Meanwhile lift the heels which are
slightly drawn apart outwards, stand on tiptoes, close the acu-
point Hlliyin (Converging rin, Ren I) and open the acupoint

Channel.
Grit the teeth tightly together, raise the
tongu~tip
a gainst the hard palate. In the mind the eyes stare inwardly
through Tianmen (Celestial Gate) at the space between the
palms (See Fig. 77).
(3) Clench both hands into fists, lower the arms along
the original route slowly to the posture "Hold the Subduing-
Demon Pestle Horizontally".
First inhale through the nose
and exhale through the mouth, then change to inhale and exhale
both through the nose.
Sink qi to Dantian (Elixir Field).
The breathing should be thready, even, long, slow and cW;tin::'
uous.
When inhaling, concentrate the mind on Dantian (Eli-
xir Field); when exhaling, gradually transfer the mind to be-
tween the two palms.
When qi circulates and flows, let mind-
will accompany qi.
4. Pick the Stars and Replace the Dipper
(I) Follow the posture of the above movement (3).
(2) Raise the right hand slowly forward and upward and
hold it high, about a fist's distance away from the forehead,
meanwhile drop the left hand, turn the palm over and place
the dorsum of the hand on the location of the acupoint Yaoyan
(Lumbar Eye, Extra) on the left back side of the waist witl,
the palm facing outward.
Both eyes stare at the inner acupoint
Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8) of the right hand (See Fig. 78).
(3) Hold the left hand high, drop the right hand, place.
the dorsum of the right hand on the location of the acupoint
Yaoyan (Lumbar Eye, Extra) on the right back side of the
waist with the palm facing outward; both eyes stare at the
acupoint Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8) of the left hand.
Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth and regulate
the breathing to be even.
Concentrate the mind on the acu-
point
Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8) of the raised
hand,
link the inner acupoint Lagong (Labored Palace, P 8) of the
raised hand, both eyes and the outer acupoint Laogong (Labor-

tion of Yaoyan (Lumbar Eye, Extra) on the back side of the
waist into a straight line, while the location of Yaoyan (Lum-
bar Eye, Extra) bulges and sinks along with the inspiration
and expiration of respiration.
"Vhen exhaling, focus the mind
on the inner Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8); when inhaling,
focus the mind on the outer Laogong (Labored Palece, P 8)
below. Imagine in the mind that the inner Laogong (Labored
Palace, P 8) ,the eyes and Yaoyan (Lumbar Eye, Extra) also
move slightly along with such movements of bulging, sinking,
opening and closing.
5. Pull Back the Tails of Nine Bulls
(I) Follow the posture of the above movement (3).
(2) The right hand gets away from Yaoyan (Lumbar Eye,
Extra), gently hangs down, follows the movement to turn
to a down-facing palm, stretches forward from the right up-
ward to shouldcr level; the five fingers cluster close together
to form a shape of "capturing hand" with the wrist slightly
bent and the fingers pointing upward and outward.
The
strcngth is stored
under the cuff. Meanwhile, the right foot
moves a step forward and bcnds at the knce with the lcft Icg
fully strctched, forming a "bow stcp"; the left hand falh down
at the same time and stretches backward from the left; the tingers
cluster close together to form a "capturing hand" with the elbow
and wrist bent and the fingers pointing upward. The right hand
is at the height of the forehead while the left hand forms an
angle of 15' with the stretched left leg (See Fig. 79).
(3) Change to a left "bow step" with the left leg bent
at the knee and the right leg fully stretched.
The left hand
turns back and stretches forward and' upward from the left,
while the right hand draws back and stretches backward from
the right.
The requirements of the movement are the same
as in the above (2).
Inhale through the nose and exhale
tiIrough the mouth.
Imagine in the mind that the two hands
pull into a line,
like pulling the tail of a bull.

palms pressed on the ears, the middle fingers slightly touching
each other and the figners placed on the location of "ruzhtn
Pass (Jade Occiput Pass)". The elbows are parallel to the shoul_
ders when bent.
Rap "ru.een Pass (Jade Occiput Pass)"
with
the readily-posed forefingers.
Rap
rapidly and
a kind of
"rub-a-dub" sounds will be
heard. This is referred to as
"beat the heavenly drum" (See Fig. 87).
(3) Having finished beating the heavenly drum, clasp the
head with both hands, slowly bend forward from the waist and
send the head down toward the middle of the space between the
two knees until it is impossible to bend any longer, with both
legs straight stretched, the waist and hip relaxed, the tongue
raised against the hard palate and the teeth tightly gritted.
(4) Immediately straighten up slowly and return to the
posture of standing as straight as a ramrod.
Once again "beat
the heavenly drum" and bend down.
Repeat this 3-5 times,

then stand upright and get ready for the next movement.
In-
hale and exha-le through the nose. In the process ofbending and
straightening up, inhale and exhale slowly with the nose as if
slightly closed (after a long time of practice hold the breath
when straightening up); when bending forward, concenrate the
mind on Dantian (Elixir Field); when straightening up, concen-
trate the mind on both palms.
12. Turn the Tail and Swing the Head
(I) Follow the posture of the above movement (4).
(2) Push out both hands forward from behind the head
till both arms are straight stretched and level with the shoulders.
(3) Interlock the ten fingers of both palms with the palm
hollows facing the ground, slowly draw them to the chest; when
the palms are two fists' distance from the chest, immediately
push them slowly down to the ground.
Straighten both legs
and immediately push to the front, left and right once respec-
tively with the head swinging to and fro in correspondence
(See Fig. 88).
(4) Then slowly stretch the waist, raise both palms upward,
set the palms asunder and swing left and right 7times respectively.
Meanwhile stamp each foot 7 times.
Apply natural respira-
tion throughout the whole movcment.
When pushing the
palms to the ground, concentrate the mind on the hollows ofboth
palms; when straightening up, concentrate the mind on the
apex of the nose.

Eight-Section Brocade
Eight-Section Brocade is a maneuver widely circulating
among the people to dispel diseases and prolong life.
It has
two training methods: the sitting training one is called "Sitting-
Style Eight-Section Broacde", referred to as "Gentle Eight-
Section Brocade"; the other one is "Standing-Style Eight-Section
Brocade", referred to as "Martial Eight-Section Brocade".
Sitting-Style Eight-Section Brocade
I. Sit with Eyes Closed Frce of Stray Thoughts, Concen-
trate the Mind in Tranquil Meditation with Hands Clenched.
Adopt leg-crossing sitting posture
(sit upright on bent
legs, right shank crossing over left shank and both sales facing
obliquely upward).
Slightly clench both hands and place
them in front of the lower abdomen, relax the whole body,
concentrate the mind on Dan/ian (Elixir Field), look straight
ahead, and gradually train to use deep abdominal respira-
tion, naturally relaxed
and
tranquilized,
and sit for 3-5
minutes (See Fig. 96).
2. Knock Teeth Thirty-Six Times, Hold Kunlunilll with
both Hands.
Knock the upper tcell! lightly with the lower oncs 36 times,
with the tonguetip raised against the hard palate, and then
pause for a little while; swallow the saliva in the mouth in three
parts.
Then, interlock the two hands and raise
them up
slowly, over the top of the head, backward, downward and
fall at the location of the occipital bone; place both palms

closely. on the occipital bone and press forwards with great
strength, meanwhile the occipital region exert strength to re-
sist backwards, then relax, and then exert strength to repeat the
muvement ten and more times.
Coordinate with respiration
to do the exercise: inhale when holding forcibly and exhale when
relaxing (See Fig. 97).
3. Beat the Heavenly Drum Left and Right, Twenty-Four
Times Respectively.
Follow the above posture, both palms move forward to
COVl:'r the ears, the fingers spread out like a fan (with the ulnar
side facing forward); the two forefingers pointing at each
other and are placed at the acupoints ru;:hen (Jade Occiput) on
the bilateral sides of the back of the head. Immediately place the
forefinger on the middle finger, then the forefinger slips down
swiftly and forcibly to tap the acupoint ru;:hen (Jade Occiput),
making rub-a-dub sounds in the ears.
Knock 24 times left
and right resepctively.
Then relax both palms covering the
ears.
Inhale and exhale gently and evenly (See Fig. 98).
4. Shake the Heavenly Pillar Lightly, Stir up Saliva with
the Tongue; Bulge and Rinse 36 Times, With Saliva the Mouth
is Filled; Swallow the Saliva in Three Parts, Send It to Navel
Dantian with Mindwill.
Follow the above posture, move both hands down along
before the chest and place them at the roots of the thighs in
front of the lower abdomen.
Interlock the fingers with both
palms facing upward.
The head muscles are relatively tense.
The strength of the left and right "head corner" leads the
head to turn to the left and right 24 times (See Fig. 99).
Then
close the mouth and stir up the tongue, bulge the cheeks and
rinse the mouth 36 timcs; whcn the saliva increases, swallow
it in three parts, send it to the navel Dantian (Elixir Field) with
mindwill and concentrate the mind on Dantian (Elixir Field) for
a little while (Imagine that the heart is kindled by a torch
and the flame spreads gradually to the whole body).

5. Close Qj and Rnb vVarm the Palms, Rub the Essence
Gate on the Lower Back; Treasure Nothing but This Unique
Qj, Imagine Flames Burning in Navel Dantian (Elixir Field).
Follow the above posture.
Sit upright on bent legs, inhale
deeply through the nose, sink qi down to Dantian (Elixir Field),
pause and close for a little while (determine the time of the
pause and closure according to the training conditions; it is
prohibited to hold back the breath in such a way as to feel
suffocated); when feeling the lower abdomen has a warm sen-
sation, rub both palms against each other till they are warm,
then rapidly push and rub the acupoint Shenshn (Kidney
Shu, UB 23) on both sides of the waist with the palms 20 and
more times. Lead qi with mindwill, mindwill and qi accom-
pany each other, so as to accelerate the warm sensation at the
lumbar region.
Then exhale slowly.
If feeling too hot, relax
the mind a little or coordinate with respiration to alleviate
it (See Fig. 100).
6. Windlasses are Turned on Left and Right,
Both Legs
are Straight Outstretched.
Follow the above posture.
Sit with
both legs levelly
stretched out, both hands move from the lumbar region to before
the chest with the fingers naturally bent and both hands half
clenched.
Like turning the handle of a windlass, both arms
do forward circular movement 36 times, then rotate reversely
for 36 circles.
Bear in mind that the knees can not be bent;
when the upper torso bends forward and leans baCkward in
coordination with the turning and rotating of the arms, the
range of motion is not to be too large (See Fig. 101).
7. Prop Up thc Sky with Fingers Interlocked, Lower the
Head and Pull the Toes Repeatedly with Both Hands.
Follow the above posture.
When both hands rotate to
before the abdomen, interlock the fingers, turn over the palms
to face dowliward, raise the hands along the chest upward in an
arch, prop up to above the head vertex (palms facing up), and

exert strength to prop upward 3 or 9 times.
Pause for a little
while, then separate the hands, bend forward the torso, stretch
out the hands along with the bending to hold the ball and toes
of the feet and pull them back while pushing to feet forward
(don't bend the knees).
Do 12 times altogether (See Fig. 102).
After that, retreat, bend and cross the outstretched legs and
sit upright.
8. Await the Saliva to Come up, Rinse and Swallow it
Again; Swallow it in Three Parts, Nine Times the Miraculous
Water is Taken; A Gurgling Sound is Heard, Hundred Chan-
nels Arc Cleared; When Water Wheel Finishes Its Transporta-
tion@ , Flames Are Kindled to Burn the Whole Body.
Follow the above posture.
Sit upright with the eycs closed
(Sce Fig. 103), wait for saliva to come up in the mouth (if no
saliva comes up, apply the above-mentioned method to stir
up the tonguc quickly to produce saliva), then bulge the cheeks,
rinse the mouth and swallow the saliva, swallow each mouth-
ful of saliva in three parts.
Swallow nine times altogether.
Then, swing the shoulders and torso 20 times and rotate the
arms sceming to turn windlasses 24 times. When the move-
meuts
arc finished,
concentrate the mind on Dantian (Elixir
Ficld), lead qi with mindwill to flow from Dantian (Elixir Field)
along the Ren Channel down to the acupoint Huiyin (Converg-
ing Yin, Ren I)
to conncct with the Du Channel, along the
spinal column to the final end of the Du Channel, then cir-
culate through the Ren and Du Channels in cycles.
Notice
not to lead qi with mindwill with any exertion.
It will be
passable to concentrate thc mind on Dantian (Elixir Field) and
apply abdominal respiration at first.
Constant effort yields
Sure success, hasty and improper pursuit is therefore prohibited.

a Vulture
(I) Follow the above posture.
Take a side step to the left
with the left foot and bend both legs to form a "horse-ride
step". Cross the forearms in front of the chest, the left arm on
the inside and the right arm on the outside with both hands
changed to fists; the left forefinger points up, the thumb and the
forefinger spread out to form a V-shape; the left arm pushes to
the left and stretches straight out, the eyes looking at the left
fingers; meanwhile,
the right hand pulls horizontally to the
right, seemingly drawing a bow to shoot an arrow (See Fig.
105).
(2) Change both fists into palms and d.>:aw them back
through the body sides in arches, draw back the left foot at
the same time and return to the naturally standing posture.

(I) Follow the above posture.
Both hands rise in a hold-
ing form along before the abdomen to before the chest, the
left palm turns up and props upward over the head, seemingly
propping up the sky with the single arm (fingertips pointing
to the right); the right palm turns over and presses down to
beside the right hip (the palm facing downward and fingertips
pointing forward)
(See Fig. 106).
(2) The left arm rotates outward, the left palm turns to face
backw.,rd and drops along the body; the right hand thrusts up
along before the body, the arms being crossed in front of the
chest (the tight arm on the inside), the right arm props upward
over the head, as if propping up the sky; the left hand presses
down along the body to beside the left hip (the requirements
of the movement are the same as those in the above one).
Repeat the movement 6 times altogether.
In coordina-
tion with respiration, inhale when the arm rises up through
before the chest and exhale when the up-propping arm drops
to before the chest.
When finishing, cross the hands in fron t of the chest, drop
them simultaneously to both sides of the body, and return to
the naturally standing posture.
4. Look Back to Treat Five Strains and Seven Impair-
ments
(1) Follow the above posture.
Turn the
head slowly
rightward and backward to the maximal limit and meanwhile
look back as much as possible; inhale at the same time (See Fig.

(4) Return to the starting posture and exhale at the same
time.
Repeat the above movements 6 times altogether. If there
is any difficulty in coordinating with respiration, it is passable
to exercise first with natural respiration and then gradually
transfer in transition to the requirements of respiration in this
section.
7. Clench Fists and Look with Eyes Wide Open to Build
up Strength and Stamina
Starting posture: Take a ride-horse posture. the hands
tightly clenched beside the waist (the knuckles turned down).
(1) Slowly rotate the right arm and thrust the fist slowly
forward until the arm is fully stretched (knuckles up), at the
same time wide open the eyes and look straight ahead, and
exhale (See Fig. 110).
(2) Rotate the arm and draw the fist back to beside the
waist (knuckles down) and inhale at the same time.
(3) The same as movement (I), only with left and right
reversed.
(4) The same as movement (2), only with left and right
reversed.
Repeat the above movements 6 times
altogether.
In
the end, return to the posture of standing at attention.
8. Rise and Fall on Tiptoes to Dispel All Diseases
(1) Follow the above posture.
Lift both heels. drawing
head up like propping up a weight on its top and inhale at the
same time (See Fig. 111).
(2) Both heels fall to the ground and return to the start-
ing position; exhale at the same time.
Repeat the above movements 6 times.
When finishing the exercise of the Standing-Style Eight-
Section Brocade, it is required to concentrate the mind on
Dan/ian (Elixir Field) for a while, breathe naturally 10 and
more tim..., and then close the training.

Chapter
Three
The Emission of External Qi
(Waiqi) in Qigong
Training q'
IS a fundamental element in the emission of
external qi (waiqi).
The therapist should, first of all, through
long-term arduous exercise of static and dynamic qigong, en-
sure that the ascending, descending, opening and closing of the
qi within the body are well regulated, and gradually accumulate
internal qi (neiqi), cause internal qi (neiqi) to fill the body in
repletion and sink to Dalltian (Elixir Field), enable qi to circulate
all over the body, and achieve the goal that once mindwill
arrives qi arrives and once qi arrives strength arrives, thus laying
a foundation for the emission of external qi (waiqi). There are
three main methods for training qi: static qigong, dynamic qigong,
massage and conduct.
• 214 •
Section One
Training Qi
t.
Train Qi by Static QJltong
I) Postures: Sitting, standing and lying postures can all
be applied as training postures for training qi.
One should
choose a posture which is suitable to oneself.
For example,
the standing-stump, plain sitting or the crossing-leg sitting ones
can be adopted as the main training postures, while others
such as sitting, lying and standing one, can be used as supple-
mentary
postures.
Seize
whatever
oppotunity
to exercise
in convenient postures.
The relatcd requirements are the
same as those in Chapter One.

,
!•i,
>,I;
\
2) Respiration:Training qi adopts chiefly counter-abdominal
respiration. At the beginning it is permitted to start the training
from natural respiration and orthodromic abdominal respira-
tion; when respiration is well-trained, it can be transferred in
transition to counter-abdominal respiration. Respiration should
be trained to be deep, long, thready and even, from con-
scious training to "neither forgotten nor aided".
Of course,
deep, long, thready and even breathing is the result of abiding
respiration exercise and should not be pursued with improper
hasty efforts.
3) Mindwill: Mindwill training in the training of qi in static
qigong adopts chiefly the method of mind concentration on Low-
er Dantian (Elixir Field), that is, "concentrate the mind to send
qi into its lair (Dantian)", enabling Dantian (Elixir Field) to
be replete with qi and the heavenly circuits be opened through.
4) Training Methods
(1) Pose a proper posture, relax the whole body and get
rid of stray thoughts.
First imagine that the morbid qi in-
side the body is spitted out through the 'weat pores all over
the body, the mouth and nose along with respiration, for three
monthfuls altogether; after that, knock the teeth 36 times, stir
up the tongue and swallow the saliva in three mouthfuls; then
imagine the pure qi of heaven and earth sinks into Dantian
(Elixir Field) along with the swallowing of the saliva and fills
the whole body in repletion.
(2) Regulate the respiration to be even and concentrate the
mind on lower Dantian (Elixir Field).
It is required to be
natural and lively but not to close breath or concentrate rigidly.
The respiration and concentration should be neither forgotten
nor aided.
(3) Training and nourishing in coordination.
Ifconditions
permit, it is advised to form the habit of training static qigong
at the times of <;i (11 p.m. to 1 a.m.) and wu (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.)
and nourishing qi at other times.
It is also required, of course,

to coordinate trammg with nourishing during each training
practice. By training, it means to concentrate attention, get rid
of stray thoughts and make the mo,t of active respiration
and mindwill to train; by nourishing, it means to make use
of the non-active respiration and mindwill to reach a peaceful
nourishing state with mind concentration achieved through
relaxed, comfortable, natural, gentle and soft breathing.
For
example, during the training practice, when through training
by
counter-abdominal
respiration
and
mind concentration
on Lower Dantian (Elixir Field), one has reached the tranquili-
zation state and feels the body to be relaxed, respiration to
be gentle, soft, even and thready, one can get into nourishing;
if one can not reach the above state and will be tired and tense
if continuing to train, one can also get into nourishing. Only
through such coordination of training and nourishing all the
time can one receive satisfactory effects.
(4) Qj grows in Dantian (Elixir Field) and circulates in
heavenly circuits.
Through a period of training, when Dan-
tian (Elixir Field) is replete with qi, pressing, warm or otber
unusual
but comfortable sensations such as the moving of
qiballs may appear in the region of Dantian (Elixir Field).
The qi sensation at Dantian (Elixir Field) will get increasingly
strong in course of time.
During the time of tranquilization
in the training practice, Dantian (Eli.."ir Field)
will feel hot,
and a warm current will be felt to lash at the location of coccyx
from Dantian (Elixir Field); sometimes the acupoint Huiyin
(Converging Yin, Ren I) pulsates first,
and a soft and comfort-
able sensation will be fel t all over the body. At this time, it is
required to lead qi with genuine mindwill to circulate along the
Du Channel to ]iaji Pass (Clipping the Spine Pass) and Yu:;mn
Pass (Jade Occiput Pass), then to Baihui (Hundred Conver-
gences, Du 20), then along the Ren Channel down to Dantian
(Elixir Field), with the principle that ifqi does not move mindwill
is concentrated on it and if qi is about to move mindwill moves

j
j
ahc•.d of it.
At this time, coordinate mindwill with respiration
to let genuine qi circulate through the Ren and Du Channels.
Inhale to let qi flow up into Upper Dantian (Elixir Field) along
the Du Channel and exhale to let qi flow down to return to
Dantian (Elixir Field).
This process froms one heavenly circuit.
In the course of practice, when tranquilization and the still
state of the mind is reached, qi grows in Dantian (Elixir Field),
and will not leak astray but circulate in heavenly circuits along
the lien and Du Channels naturally.
At this time it is unne-
cessary to conduct qi with respiration, qi can circulate naturally
in heavenly circuits under the operation of mindwill without
any exertion of effort.
(5) Close the training seriously when each practice is
finished. Remove mindwill slowly from the region on which it
is concentrated, conduct qi to return to Lower Dantian (Elixir
Field), relax the whole body, slowly open the eyes and practise
the exercise of self-massage and conduct.
(6) Self massage and conduct: Rub the hands, bathe the
face and comb the hair, conducting qi to circulate through the
twelve channels.
For the two rin Channels on the upper limbs,
rub from the chest to the hands; for the three rang Channels,
rub from the hands to the shoulders, the sides of the head and
down to the chest and abdomen; for the two rang Channels
on the lower limbs, rub from the waist and buttocks to the
foot; for the Three rin Channels, rub from the feet to the abdo-
men.
Rub and massage to conduct qi for IO times respectively.
Then do some relaxing movements and close the training.
2. Train Qj by Dynamic Qjgong
Training qi by dynamic qigong is a fundamental exercise
for the maneuvers to conduct qi in the emission of external qi
(waiqi).
Static qigong accumulates and strengthens qi inter-
nally, whereas dynamic qigong trains the channels and collat-

erals, muscles and bones externally, enabling qi to flow unim-
pededly and freely, thereby laying a foundation for the exercise
of the maneuvers to conduct qi.
Double-Nine Tang Qjgo.g
Double-Nine rang Qjgo.g, on the foundation of the exercise
of riJinJing (Changing Tendons Qjgong), adopts the posture of
oscillating stump to vibrate the qi of Dan/ian (Elixir Field) and
cause qi to circulate through the whole body in accordance with
particular postures, respiration and rnilldwiIl, So as to build up
health and strengthen the vitality of qi. It is a fundamental exer-
cise for the method of burst-style emission of qi.
I) Preparations
(I) Basic Crotch Posture
The basic crotch posture is the middle-crotch oseillating_
stmup one.
Stand relaxedly and tranquilizedly with the feet shoulder-
width apart, the toes purchasing the ground, both hands natural-
Iy hanging
down,
the
head
as if propping up a weight,
the eyes looking straight ahead, the tonguetip
raised
against
the hard palate, the shoulders sunk and the elbows dropped,
the chest slightly thrown out, the buttocks slightly drawn in,
the knees relaxed and slightly bent; concentrate attention and
breathe naturally.
Having stood properly, first vent morbid qi
for three
mouthfuls as practised in the exercise of static qigong. Then ini-
tiate Dantian (Elixir Field) and further the whole body to vib.
rate with the slight movements of the bending and straighening
of the knee joints. In the beginning, the amplitude of vibration
will be both great and unnatural; through a period of exercise,
the vibration will come to be natural and drawn to Dan/ian (Eli-
xir Field).
Then vibrate with Dan/ian (Elixir Field) as the

center, tht four limbs either remaining ,till or VlDrating slightf}'.
Th.e vibration ought to be natural and its amplitude small.
The following movements should all be carried out under this
oscillating stump.
(2) Pliable Belt Channel
Follow the previous middle-crotch oscillating-stump pos-
ture and do the following exercises.
Place both hands at
the location of the Belt Channel on the right side, the hollows
of the palms facing the Belt Channel, coordinate with counter-
abdominal respiration and move the hands.
When inhaling,
push the qi of the Belt Channel to rotate leftward with the left
palm at the front and the right palm behind the left one. Mind-
will accompanies
the hands.
Mind to perceive the qi sensa-
tion, slightly close the eyes and look inwardly at the Belt Chan-
nel.
When exhaling, push the qi of the Belt Channel to rotate
rightward with the right hand at the front and the left palm be-
hind the right one.
The inward look and mindwill are the same
as above.
Do 9 breaths altogether (See Fig. 112). Then apply
the same movements to leading the qi of the Belt Channel to
circulate, rightward when inhaling and leftward when exhaling.
Do 9 breaths altogether.
During the training practice, it is required to coordinate
respiration, postures and mindwill very well.
Relax the lum-
bar region fully and bring along the waist with the qi movement
of the hands to rotate naturally with small amplitude. During
the training practice onc can feel one's waist to be as soft as a silk
ribbon, the Belt Channel to be warm, qi circulating round the
waist and the flow of the qi of channels and collaterals all over
the body to be vigorous and unobstructed.
(3) Open and
Close the Three Fields (Dantians:
Elixir
Fields)
Assume the middle-crotch oscillating-stump posture. When
inhaling, point the acupoints Laogong (Labored Palace, P 8)

on the dorsa of the hands at each other (See Fig. 113), draw them
slowly asunder toward both sides till they are about shoulder-
width apart, at the same time draw in the abdomen and draw
up the anus, imagine that Dan/ian (Elixir Ficld) is open and noble
qi enters through Dan/ian (Elixir Field). When exhaling, turn the
palms over with the inner acupoints Laogong (Labored Palace,
P8) pointing at Lower Dan/ian (Elixir Field) and draw the hands
slowly inward (See Fig. 114), to a location about a fist's distance
from the abdomen. At the same time bulge the abdomen and
relax the anus; mindwill, both hands and Dan/ian (Elixir Field)
form an integral entity, the inducted qi is gathered into Dan/ian
(Elixir Field) and the noble qi breathed in through the mouth
and nose also sinks into Dan/ian (Elixir Field). Do 9 breaths
altogether.
Then move both hands to the location of Middle Dantian
(Elixir Field)
(namely Shanzhong: Middle Chest,
Ren
17),
open and close at Middle Dantian (Elxir Ficld) in the same way
for 9 breaths.
Raise qi to Middle Dantian (Elixir Field) when
inhaling and sink genuine qito Lower Dantian (Elixir Field) when
exhaling.
Finally, move both hands to the location of Upper Dantian
(Elixir Field) (namely Yintang: Glabella, Extra I), open and
close at Upper Dantian (Elixir Field) in the same way for 9
breaths.
Beginners are required to raise qi to Middle Dantian
(Elixir Field) only when inhaling, gradually raise qi to Upper
Dantian (Elixir Field) as time goes on; sink qi into Lower Dantian
(Elixir Field) when exhaling, and finally turn both palm sover to
face downward (See Fig. 115), push them to Lower Dantian
(Elixir Field), then turn both palms to face upward (See Fig.
116) and lift them up to Upper Dantian (Elixir Field). Do 10
times altogether.

Rubbing Abdomen to Strengthen Qj Qjgong
Rubbing Abdomen to Strengthen Qj Qjgong is an auxiliary
maneuver to coordinate with the exercise of static and dynamic
qigong.
The practice of this complementary maneuver can
soliditY the five organs, strengthen and invigorate the internal qi
(neiqi), accumulate qi and prevent qi from leaking out, multiply
strength and stamina, effect highly sensitive opening and clos-
ing of the acupoints and avoid deviations.
It is particularly
important to those who emit external qi (waiqi) to treat diseases.
(I) The method of rubbing abdomen: Lie on one's back
on a bed,
both legs straight stretched naturally, both hands
placed at the body sides. Relax the whole body and internal
organs, get rid of stray thoughts, breathe naturally and raise th~
tonguetip against the hard palate.
(2) Place the right palm (left palm for females) on the epi-
gastric region under the xiphoid process, rub in circular motion
from right to left (female from left to right). When rubbing,
avoid exerting excessive strength so as not to cause the hands to
be stiff and rigid.
The rubbing should be natural, gentle and
continuous; if there is a soft sensation inside the stomach under
the palms, it is just correct.
Get rid of stray thoughts, lookin-
wardly in tranquilization, concentrate the mind on the middle-
jiao (middle heater), do not distract the attention, neither for-
get nor aid, breathe naturally and calmly, mind to perceive the
soft, gentle, warm and comfortable sensation of acquisition of
qi underneath the palms, 15-30minutes each time and gradual-
ly increasing to one hour.
Never overstrain the hands and
arms.

line between the pit of stomach and the navel is soft and dented,
which is a manifestation of deficiency of qi in theRenChannel.
Knead the median line with the bases of the palms and knock it
with empty fists from above to below.
Mter a long period of
exercise, the Ren Channel wiII be replete and exuberant with qi
without any dent.
(4) First rub the right side of the abdomen with the right
palm, rn bbing and kneading in circular motion and travelling
from the snbcostal region to the groin, for 12 times; then place
the right palm on Dantian (Elixir Field) on the lower abdomen
and run around in circular rubbing movement for about 15-
30 minutes.
About one hundred days or so later, the qi of
Dantian (Elixir Field) and the whole region of abdomen wiII be
full, exuberant, solid arid energetic.
(5) For the exercise inlaterdays, first pound the median line
of the chest and the bilateral sides of the line with empty fists,
then rub and knead Dantian (ElL"ir Field) in the above way. A
long-time exercise will make the qi of both the chest and ab-
domen solid and exuberant, which manifests that the Ren and
Chong Channels are fully filled with qi.

Conducting qi, also called directing qi, is based on the
foundation of training qi to further direct qi to the emitting
locations (hand forms, acupoints, etc.) through the exercise of
maneuvers of conducting qi, achieve the accomplishment that
qi arrives simultaneously with the arrival of mindwill and enable
one to control and sense the location, direction, pattern and qua-
lity of the flow of internal qi (neiqi) as well as the quantity of
qi, thereby laying a solid foundation for the exercise of the
manipulations to emit qi.
palms after the pounding so as to make qi distribute evenly and
flow smoothly.
The qi ofthe Du Channel will be full and solid
in about one hundred days.
(7) When the Ren and Du Channels are replete with qi, it is
permittable to pat the upper and lower limbs by oneself, from
above to below, laying stress on pounding the muscular regions.
After one year's exercise, the whole body will besolid and
energetic, the defensive functions will be fortified and the open-
ing and closing of the acupoints will be highly sensitive, making
the body insusceptible to the disturbance of filthy qi. Later on,
it is passable to spend only certain amountof time eachday rub-
bing the abdomen and pounding the four lwnbs to continue the
exercise.

reach the palms through the Three rang Channels of the Hand
and get to the terminals of the fingers; when exhaling, mindwill
accompanies qi to return to Dantian (Elixir Field) along the
Three Tin Channels of the Hand.
When the circulation of
internal qi (miqi) is smooth and unobstrueted, concentrate the
mind on the palms and the terminals ofthe fingers, breathe gen-
tally and naturally and one will feel that the palms are warm,
the terminals of the fingers are thickening, distending, tingling
and slightly vibrating, as if something is being emitted.

repeatedly bulging and vibrating, but qi has its stronghold at
the inner Laogong (Labored Palace,
P 8), amassed without
dispersion there. Merge qi movement and hand
movement
into one entity.
This maneuver mostly adopts the sitting or standing form.
It is suitable to adopt hand forms such as the standing-alone
form, the sword-fingers form, the dragon-graping form and
others in the practice.
When this maneuver is well exercised,
it is advisable to train qi patterns with different frequencies and
wave crests.

each day.
Generally, it can be mastered preliminarily within
three months.

The
exercise of cold-style and hot-style
conducting-qi
abides by the treatment principle of "heating the cold and chill-
ing the hot",
Hot-style conducting-qi is to, after having posed a certain
posture, regulate breathing to be even, concentrate the mind
on Dantian (Elixir Field), imagine that the qi of Dantian (Eli-
xir Field) is like a scorching sun and sets the whole body aflame,
then shift the mind to the palms and imagine that qi burns and
sends forth heat at the palms or at the fingertips.
Cold-style conducting-qi is to regulate breathing, Concen-
trate the mind on Dantian (Elixir Field) and then send the mind
down to Yongquan (Pouring Spring, K 1).
Inhale the earthly
qi from under the heels to flow 11r (0 the chest and the palms,

upper limbs and up to the palms, enabling qi to rotate at Dan-
tian (Elixir Field) and the palms synchronistically, with the
navel as the center at Dantian (Elixir Field) and the inner Lao-
gong (Labored Palace, P 8) as the center at the palm..
The
speed ought to be slow at the beginning and gradually acce-
lerate naturally without any exertion.
This
maneuver can
be exercised in the same way with the forefinger or the middle
finger stretched out.
The different methods of rotating from
large circles to small ones or from small circles to large ones
can be adopted in the training practice.
(3) Training time: This maneuver can be mastered only
through regular practice with various postures
of
standing,

Emitting.Qi Hand Forms
In this maneuver it is forbidden to imagine the whole body to
be as cold as ice or lead the cold to other parts of the body \cst
it should affect the coordination of the functional activities of qi.
This maneuver can be exercised in combination with
other conducting-qi maneuvers after such conducting-qi maneu-
vers as oscillating stump are well exercised.
From among the above nine sections of maneuvers, 2-3
can be chosen for exercise each time.
When the training prac-
tice is finished, stand still for a little while, conduct qi to return
to Dantian (Elixir Field); then rub the hands and face, move
about lightly for a moment and close the training.
Emitting qi, also called "emitting gong", "emitting ex..
ternal qi (waiqi)" and referred to as "spreading qi" in ancient
times, is a method to conduct, through the exercise of maneuvers
of training qi and conducting qi, the internal qi (neiqi) with-
in the emitter's own body to the fingers and palms or other emit-
ting-qi hand forms, then utilize emitting-qi manipulations to
emit qi to the channels, collaterals and acupoints of the receiver
of qi.

Qj Patterns in the Emission of Qj
According to clinical emitting-qi experiences, in the pro-
Cess of emitting qi to treat diseases, the close coordination with
different qi patterns to emit qi is one of the keys to have a good
command of emitting qi to treat diseases.
In the emission of
qi the basic qi patterns are the three types ofline, dot and spiral.
With the basical mastery of the three types of qi patterns, one
can accommodate to the diseases and
qi
clinically,
either
choosing one pattern, or combining two patterns or generating
some specific qi patterns in the emission.
In applying the
three basic patterns to emit qi, it is also allowable to coordi-
nate temperament, cold-type, hot-type and other conducting-
qi maneuvers to emit qi, forming combined patterns.
(I) Line pattern: The "pulling two or three points into
one line" and other similar conducting-qi maneuvers serve as
the training methods for the fundamental accomplishments of
this pattern.
It generally emploies the pushing, pulling, fixing,
leading and other manipulations to emit qi.
Its initiation is
relatively mild and it has pressing and tugging sensations as
well as a warm sensation which is comparatively ohvious.
It
is a fundamental qi pattern to conduct channel qi, im'i~orate the
deficient qi and remove the excessive qi.
The emitting-qi manipulations for this pattern are required
to be steady and slow with doep and natural respiration or to

rmit qi with the aid of deep and unhurried respiration.
(2) Dot pattern: This is a commonly-used qi pattern in
the emission of qi, with the oscillating-stump or burst-style con-
ducting-qi method as its basic training.
It can be used in any
emitting-qi manipulation.
The emission of qi with this qi pat-
tern has particularly obvious stimulations on the functional
activities of the qi of the channels, collaterals and acupoints as
well as the qi of Dantian (Elixir Field). It is a major qi pattern
to mobilize and stimulate the functional activities of qi.
The emission of qi with this qi pattern mostly adopts the
plain
sitting or
middIc-croutched
standing form.
Breathe
naturally and slowly, take the waist as an axis and the abdo-
men as an pump, vibrate the qi within the body, conduct qi
to the emitting-qi hand form and emit qi onto the treated region.
OJ falls like rolling beads, being sent forth one grain after ano-
ther; mindwill vibrates along with qi and induces it to certain
directions and regions.
When emitting qi with this qi pattern, never combine qi
or use the strenuous muscular vibration to urge the muscular
strength to vibrate, otherwise it will result in qi stagnancy, caus-
ing chest distress, costalgia, fracture-like torment of the arms
and laceration-like torment of the flesh.
So special attention
must be paid to it.
To have a good command of this qi pattern for the emis-
sion of qi, it is necessary to train the vibrating manipulation
well, with qi capable of being emitted naturally.
Generally,
train perseveringly in the order of training-qi (Double-Nine
rang Ojgong) and conducting-qi (Oscillating Stump, etc.) ma-
neuvers.
It can possibly be mastered basically in three months,
but not yet be applied skillfully in clinical practice -
this is
evident that it is very hard to be mastered.
(3) Spiral pattern: This qi pattern is suitable for spiral-
style conducting-qi manipulation to conduct and emit internal
qi (neiqi) in the form of spirals.
The emission of qi with this

qi pattern characterizes in the deep and penetrating inclination
of qi and has a specific regulating effect on the functional acti-
vities of qi.
The emission of this qi pattern is coordinated with natural
respiration.
Spiral mindwill induces the spiral waves to start
from Dantian (Elixir Field) and flow with one hoop after another
to the emitting-qi hand form where the rotating qi current can
be sensed by oneself.
For this qi pattern, apart from the exercise of the above
maneuvers, it is advisable to practise frequently the maneuvers
of Dantian (Elixir Field) rotation as well as the synchronical
rotation of Dantian (Elixir Field) and the hand forms so as to
form a firm spiral qi route.
As soon as Dantian (Elixir Field)
qi rotates, at the hand form qi rotates in accordance and the
rotation of qi can be transferred at will with high proficiency:
only then can this qi pattern be applied to clinical practice.

TYPES OF SYNDROMES
Qjgong deviations refer to the abnormal phenomena occur-
ring in the process of qigong dirigation, whose formative causes
mainly include the following four aspects:
I. Forced Qjgong Dirigation
Qjgong deviations may occur with forced qigong dirigation
when the patient's constitution or state of illness does not allow
him to practise the maneuvers aiming at the circulation of in-
ternal qi (neiqi).
2. Improper Qjgong Dirigation
No guidance flOm teachers, resulting in failure to train in
the correct ways; or study certain maneuver by oneself and
force oneself to train hastily and blindly; or failure in the cor-
rect application of the three regulating principles and methods
of regulating the body, regulating the breathing and regulating
the mind in the training practice; or create new maneuvers and
train recklessly before rriastering the maneuver one is learning;
or change maneuvers at random.
3. Weak-mindedness as well as Suspiciousness which In-
curs Illnesses
Inability to adopt a correct attitude towards the qigong
effects, regarding some normal phenomena occurring in the
process of qigong dirigat:on as deviations; or be terribly suspi-
cious to produce mental burdens which become deviations in
course of time.

G) OJ, in Chinese a homonym of "air" or ''breath'', re-
fers to a kind of nutritive substance within the body. It is close-
ly related to but entirely different from the respired air and
is sometimes written specifically as "~" in Chinese.
In tradi-
tional Chinese
medicine it
also
denotes the
physiological
functions'of the intcrnal organs and tissues, e.g. qi of the five
zang-orga~s
and
qi
of
the six fu-organs.
Some
common
concepts of "qi" arc explained as follows:
a. Primordial qi: the qi derived from the congenital es-
sence, acting as the primary motive force for the life activities.
b. Essence qi (vital essence): the extract obtained from
food to maintain the activities of life, the visceral functioning
and metabolism.
c. Genuine qi (vitality qi): the dynamic force of all ,·i·
tal functions,
or~ginating from the combination of the
ori~
ginal qi inherited and the acquired qi derived from food and
air.
d. Internal qi (neiqi): genuine qi within the body as the
material ba<;is of energy transmission.
e.
External qi (waiqi): outgoing genuine qi emitted or
radiated from the body to the outside.
® Yin:rang theory is originated from the combination of
ancient philosophical theory and medical practice.
Yang a.nd
)'in are in nature two opposing concepts, the forn:er rnascuh~c
and the latter feminine.

along which the acupuncture
points are d'stributed.
The
channels
(jing)
are
the
main conduits,
serving
as
the
vertical paths for the flow of qi and blood,
as the intercon-
nection
between
the
visceral
organs
and
the
extremities.
The collaterals (Iuo) are the branches of the channels, being
the superficial network interconnecting the channels as well
as all portions of the body.
The theory of channel. and colla-
terals includes the physiology and pathology of the channel.
and collaterals and their relationship with the zang- and fu-
organs, and can serve as a guidance of qigong dirigation and
acupuncture in clinical practice.
@ Dantian (Elixir Field) is divided into Upper Dantian,
Middle Dantian and Lower Dantian.
If not specifically stated,
Dantian refers to Lower Dantian, the area located in the upper
2/3 of the line joining the umbilicus and symphesis pubis.
® Gun: a length measure corresponding to the length of
the middle segment of an individual's own middle finger.
@ Standing stump (Zhanzhuang): here "zhan" in Chinese
means "stand" while "zhuang" means "stump"
or
"pile".
'Zhangzhuang" is a metaphorical term indicating that the "stand-
ing"
should be as fixed, firm and strong as a "stump" rooting
deep in the ground.
Standing stump actually refers to a kind
of fixed stance usually widl the feet apart, and the knees bent,
slightly or with the thighs in almost an angle of 90' with the
shanks in accordance with the height of the stance, coordinated
by varied postures of the arms and hands.
It is commonly
adopted to train qi as well as physical strength.
(fJ Two-hour Periods
(Shichen):
the 12 two-hour periods
into which the day was traditionally divided in ancient China,
each being given the name of the 12 Earthly Branches respec-
tively, namely, the periods of zi-from 11 p.m. to 1a.m., chou-
1 to 3 a.m.,yin-3 to 5 a.m., mao-5 to 7 a.m., chen-7 t09a.m.,

® The Ten Heavenly Stems:jia,yi, bing, ding, wu,ji,gen&.
xin, Ten and gui are elements of the ten Heavenly Stems from
the first to the tenth respectively, created in ancient China
to be used as serial numbers and al.'o in combination with the
twelve Earthly Branches to designate years, months, days and
hours.
® Five Elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water are
five elements in ancient Chinese theories of philosophy and
medicine.
The five elements are believed to promote as well
as restrict each other, namely, wood promotes fire, fire promotes
earth, earth promotes metal, metal promotes water and wa-
ter in turn promotes wood; wood acts on earth, earth acts on
water, water acts on fire, fire acts on metal and metal in turn
acts on wood.
The five elements are held by the ancients to
compose the physical universe and used in TCM to expound
the unity of the human body and matters and the physio-patho-
logical relationship between the five zang-organs.
@ Fen: a unit oflength, equal to 1/10 of one cun.
@ Tianmen (Celestial Gate): an acupoint in qigong, 2 cun

circulation through the Ren and Du channels in qigong.
@ Eight Methods of Intelligent Turtle: one of the ancient
theories for sciecting acupoints.
Eight acupoints of the Eight
Extra Channels are related to the day and the hour in terms
of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. Appropriate acupoints
are selected according co the date and time of treatment.
