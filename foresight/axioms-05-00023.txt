Abstract: Stanisław Le´sniewski’s mereology was originally conceived as a theory of foundations of
mathematics and it is also for this reason that it has philosophical connotations. The ‘philosophical
signiﬁcance’ of mereology was upheld by Bolesław Soboci´nski who expressed the view in his
correspondence with J.M. Boche´nski. As he wrote to Boche´nski in 1948: “[...] it is interesting that,
being such a simple deductive theory, mereology may prove a number of very general theses
reminiscent of metaphysical ontology”. The theses which Soboci´nski had in mind were related to the
mereological notion of “the Universe”. Soboci´nski listed them in the letter adding his philosophical
commentary but he did not give proofs for them and did not specify precisely the theory lying
behind them. This is what we want to supply in the ﬁrst part of our paper. We indicate some
connections between the notion of the universe and other speciﬁc mereological notions. Motivated by
Soboci´nski’s informal suggestions showing his preference for mereology over the axiomatic set theory
in application to philosophy we propose to consider Soboci´nski’s formalism in a new frame which is
the ZFM theory—an extension of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by mereological axioms, developed by
A. Pietruszczak. In this systematic part we investigate reasons of ’philosophical hopes’ mentioned by
Soboci´nski, pinned on the mereological concept of “the Universe”.

1. Introduction
There is deﬁnitely some scepticism as to whether it is possible to establish the so-called intended
interpretation of a formalized theory. This does not mean, however, that any studies into such an
interpretation must be considered aimless. We would rather say that, in this case, our expectations
should not be too high: a reconstruction of intended meanings of the terms belonging to a given system
might not expose the intended model, but it still increases the pragmatic value of the examined text.
Stanisław Le´sniewski’s mereology was originally conceived as a theory of foundations of
mathematics and it is also for this reason that it has philosophical connotations. We may look for its
new philosophical interpretation and ask whether and to what extent (from the perspective of a given
purpose) mereology is really an interesting theory of part-whole. The ‘philosophical signiﬁcance’ of
mereology was upheld by Bolesław Soboci´nski who expressed the view in his correspondence with
J.M. Boche´nski [1] (Soboci´nski and Boche´nski together with J. Drewnowski and J. Salamucha formed
the so-called Cracow Circle, which was a branch of the Lvov-Warsaw School, interested in modern
analytical tools used in Christian philosophy. For the richer historical context we refer the reader
to [2]). As he wrote to Boche´nski in 1948:
[...] it is interesting that, being such a simple deductive theory, mereology may prove a
number of very general theses reminiscent of metaphysical ontology. [1]

The theses which Soboci´nski had in mind were related to the mereological notion of “the Universe”.
Soboci´nski listed them in the letter adding his philosophical commentary. However, he did not give
proofs for them and did not deﬁne precisely the theory lying behind them. This is what we want
to supply in the ﬁrst part of our paper. We focus on the deductive minimum for the mereological
theses listed by Soboci´nski and indicate some connections between the notion of the universe and
other speciﬁc mereological notions. In the considered letter Soboci´nski expressed his preference for
mereology over the axiomatic set theory in application to philosophy, This motivates us to look for a
frame in which both mereological and set theoretical notions may be expressed. We choose for this
aim the ZFM system, which is an extension of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by mereological axioms,
developed by A. Pietruszczak [3]. In this systematic part we reconsider reasons of ’philosophical hopes’
mentioned by Soboci´nski, pinned on the mereological concept of “the Universe”.
2. The Universe in Mereology with Ontology
The concept of the universe which Soboci´nski explained in a letter to Boche´nski was already
introduced by Le´sniewski in his early mereology, where he put forward the following deﬁnition
Deﬁnition VII. I use the expression ’universe’ to denote the class of objects.
and proved theorems on the existence and uniqueness of the universe:
Theorem XLIII. Some object is the class of non-contradictory objects. [...]
Theorem XLIV. The class of non-contradictory objects is the universe. [...]
Theorem XLV. If P is the universe, and P1 is the universe, then P is P1.
[4] (159–160), [5] (L2: 31–32)
The question of the provability of theorems XLIII and XLIV requires a commentary on the
ontological commitment of mereology: if it requires that the domain of “objects” should be nonempty.
In the proofs of XLIII and XLIV the existential assumption is used that there is at least one “object”
(or “non-contradictory object”(there is no explicit deﬁnition of a non-contradictory object but certainly
it is dependent on the notion of an object)) (comments on provability of XLIII and XLIV are to be found
in [6] (128–129). However, we would not agree with the opinion that including XLIII and XLIV as
theses shows that ”Le´sniewski was not clear as to the logical foundations of his system”. We would
rather say that he simply changed the opinion about the ontological commitment of his theory).
Indeed, Le´sniewski in his early studies believed that the sentence “no object contains contradictions”
is true and may be proved ([4] (46) ([5] (L1: 226))). If he could use a strong interpretation of universal
negative sentences (as he declared in [4] (231), [5] (L3: 264)), it follows that there exists at least one
object (non-contradictory object) (theorem I “No object is a part of itself.” [4] (131) ([5] (L2: 9)) of early
mereology already implies the existence of an object). In his later works, however, Le´sniewski changed
his opinion on the matter and decided not to assert conclusively whether any objects exist at all [4]
(232) ([5] (L3: 265)). Ontology with mereology in their later version have models with an empty domain
of individuals where formulas XLIII and XLIV are not true (in this sense Le´sniewski’s system is not
ontologically committed to any object (we follow Urbaniak referring to [7])).
Soboci´nski essentially took over the notion of the universe from Le´sniewski, but did not formulate
any existential theses about it. Perhaps he assumed the later version of ontology with mereology. In his
correspondence with Boche´nski, he included many more theses about the universe than Le´sniewski
did, considering them interesting for philosophical reasons.
We will reconstruct Soboci´nski’s exposition in Le´sniewski’s assumed system.
We expound Soboci´nski’s approach in mereology based on ontology using the same method as
the one employed by Soboci´nski himself in [8].
The assumed theory is expressed in the ﬁrst-order language, whose vocabulary comprises:
individual variables: x, y, z, . . . ; name-forming functor pt (part of); inherence two-place predicate
ε (is); logical connectives: ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔; quantiﬁers ∀, ∃and parentheses (, ). The terms of our language

Axioms 2016, 5, 23

are individual variables and expressions pt(τ), where τ is a term. Atomic formulas are of the shape
τ ε τ′, where τ and τ′ are terms. Other formulas are built in a standard way. (In the original manuscript
Soboci´nski used the style of notation from Principia Mathematica. Like Le´sniewski, he applied two types
of variables A, B, a (which are of the same sort). The same notation is used in [8], with one exception:
in the manuscript there is cz instead of pt (from the Polish ”cz˛e´s´c” meaning ”part”). Cf. also [9]. )
Mereology with ontology OML is characterized by:
-
theorems of ﬁrst-order logic (QL)
-
axiom of ontology
AO.
∀x, y (xεy ↔∃z(zεx) ∧∀z, u (zεx ∧uεx →zεu) ∧∀z (zεx →zεy))

(We delete the redundant part of the conjunction occurring on the right side of the deﬁnition of
Kl from [8] (219): ∃z(zεy).)
We use also the following deﬁnitions:

(∆)
∀x, y (x∆y ↔∃z(zεx ∧zεy))

∀x (xε W ↔xεx)

(V)
∀x (xε V ↔xεx ∧¬(xεx))

The deﬁnitions listed above are special cases of three deﬁnitional schemata, which enable us to
introduce predicates (symbolized by F), function constants (f) and individual constants (n):
def-p
F(x1 . . . xn) ↔φF
def-f
∀u(uε f (x1 . . . xn) ↔uεxi ∧φf )
xi ∈{u, x1, . . . , xn}
def-n
∀u(uεn ↔uεu ∧φn)
(Formulas φF, φf , φn contain the same free variables as the left sides of the equivalences.) (cf. [10])
Primitive rules of OML are MP: ⊢φ →ψ, φ =⇒⊢ψ and Gen: ⊢φ =⇒⊢∀xφ.
Let us now in our notation retype formulas listed by Soboci´nski with his original comments
(we also change notation of symbols in the quoted commentaries).

∀x(xεW ↔xεKl(W))
(x is the Universe ↔xεKl(objects).)

(AM2, AM3)
T13
∀x, y(xεpt(y) →∃z(zεextr(x)))
(T12)
(T12 expresses the Weak Supplementation Principle accepted by Simons in [11] (p. 28) as
a mereological axiom. For possible connections between this principle and other mereological
assumptions cf. [3] (pp. 71–72).)
Now we are immediately able to notice that the deﬁnition of the universe (W) is equivalent to
def-n for W because of (Kl).
Actually, formula S1 brings problems because:
Fact 1. S1 added to OML +W causes a contradiction.

Axioms 2016, 5, 23
5 of 13
From S1 we have V εW ↔¬ V εpt(V). Because the OML thesis is ¬ V εpt(V), we get V εW and
with AO: ∃z(zε V). But the OML thesis is ¬∃z(zε V).
Perhaps Soboci´nski’s original comment to S1: “The Universe is not a part of anything” should be
understood as weaker than S1 but only as the implication
S1→. ∀x(xεW →¬∃y(xεpt(y))).
Formula S1→is derivable in OML+W and the same is to be said about other formulas listed
by Soboci´nski:
Fact 2. S1→and S2–S11 are theses of OML extended by W.
We formulate the above fact giving the following proofs:

As we have said, Le´sniewski’s ontology has interpretations in an empty set of individuals and
this is not changed in the case of OML. This is why the counterparts of Le´sniewski’s theorems XLIII
and XLIV are not theses of OML+W but only their weaker versions:
Fact 3. It is derivable in OML+W that
xliii.
∃x(xε W) →W ∆Kl(W)
(AM4, W)
xliv.
∃x(xε W) →Kl(W)εW
(AM4, T8, W)
Let us sketch the following model. We take a set of individuals D. The power set of D is a domain
of a valuation of individual variables, ε∗is a semantical counterpart of the inherence predicate - it is a
certain set of order pairs, where the ﬁrst element of every pair is a singleton made of an inividual and
the second element is any of its supersets; pt∗is an operation which for every singleton assigns a set
of all parts of the element of this singleton. We can sketch the following model for OML + W which
falsiﬁes formula ∃x(xεW): < D, ε∗, pt∗, v >, such that D = ε∗= pt∗= ∅. In such a model all axioms
of OML are true and v(W)=v(V)=v(W)=v(Kl(W))=∅.
However, we may easily obtain the counterpart of Theorem XLV on the uniqueness of the universe:
Fact 4. In OML+W the following formula is derivable
xlv.
∀x, y(xεW ∧yεW →x = y)
(AM3, W)
Soboci´nski himself formulated theses about the universe also in [8,12]. He noted that everything
which is exterior to W is a contradictory object (in the sense of V) and that universe W by itself
corresponds to a Boolean-algebraic unit element.
Let us add further theses expressed by Soboci´nski:
Fact 5. In OML+W the following formulas are derivable
S12.
∀x(xεW ↔xεx ∧∀y(y ⊂extr(x) →y ⊂V))
(cf. [8] (221))
S13.
∀x(xεx →xεing(W))
S14.
∀x(xεx →W = ((W −x) + x))
([12] (93, A18, A19))
The universe may possess more interesting properties in atomistic mereology which we obtain
from OML by adding the following axiom:
AM5.
∀x(xεx →∃z(xεKl(z) ∧∀y∀u(yεz ∧uεing(y) →u = y)))
and the deﬁnition of an atom:

Axioms 2016, 5, 23
9 of 13
(At)
∀x(xεAt ↔xεx ∧∀z(zεing(x) →z = x))
(x is an atom if every of its ingredient is identical with x)
(We can use also more intuitive deﬁnition: xεAt ↔xεx ∧¬∃z(zεpt(x)) (x is an atom if x is an
object which does not have parts).)
We note
Fact 6. OML+{AM5, At} theses are
S15at.
∃x(xε W) →∃z(Kl(z) = Kl(W) ∧∀y(yεz →yεAt)) (T11, T8, AM5, At)
S16at.
∃x(xε W) →W = Kl(At)
(cf. [12] (V2, 96))
In other words, if there is at least one object in the atomic universe, everything which is the
universe (or, should we say, ’universal’) is a compound of atoms. Moreover, the universe is identical
with the mereological class of all atoms.
Regardless of how the universal set of individuals is structured — moving still within OML —
we may identify yet another feature of the mereological class of all objects. As it can be demonstrated,
in OML, the following formula is the thesis:
(***) Kl(z)εz →∀x(xεz →(xεKl(z) ↔∀y(yεz →(xε ∼pt(y)))))
To prove (***) we use AO, AM2, Kl and ing; the part of predecessor Kl(z)εz is essential in a proof
of ←(from Kl(z)εz and tεKl(z) we get: tεz and from ∀y(yεz →xε ∼pt(y)) we have xε ∼pt(t)).
Finally we note:
Fact 7. Formula S5 follows from (***) in OML+(W).
The formula (***) says that for every z which fulﬁlls Kl(z)εz we can consider a ’local’
(restricted to z) universe which is a mereological class of all z with the same property as is expressed
for W in S5.
3. Universes in ZFM
Soboci´nski was convinced about the advantage of mereology over Zermelo’s set theory in
application to philosophical issues. He expressed this conviction in his letter to Boche´nski giving
a theological example:
If somebody takes a position of Zermelo’s set theory, he can draw conclusions that are
grossly in relation to theological opinions, eg. we assume that God exists, and so the object
{God} exists [...] and this object {God} ̸= God, ect. {{God}}, {{{God}}}, . . . and they
are all different, concretely existent objects! [...] In mereology it is not the case, because
Kl{God} = God, and so it is only a different way of speaking and this is always permitted
[...] Pay attention to the consequences of Zermelo’s system: before the creation of anything,
there have been existent already an inﬁnite amount of other objects ̸= God !!! [1].
The question which we want to put now is: how does this preference occur when the philosophical
notion of the universe is considered? In other words: in which sense does the notion called by
Soboci´nski ”the Universe” (we would say: the world, totum) identiﬁed with W in OML have more
signiﬁcant philosophical content than its set theoretical counterpart? We will analyze this issue
in the frame of a richer system than OML, which gives the possibility of speaking about both
types of multitudes: mereological collections and distributive sets—in the ZFM theory proposed
by A. Pietruszczak ([3] (pp. 172–181)).
ZFM is expressed in a ﬁrst order-language with the following primitive symbols: Z (set), ∈(for
being an element), = (ﬁrst-order identity) and ⊏— symbol for a part relation. ZFM is built on ﬁrst-order
predicate logic with identity with proper axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel and the following axioms for ⊏:

(⊑)
x ⊑y ↔x ⊏y ∨x = y
The idea of the interpretation of elementary mereology in the set theoretical frame is obviously
realizable because of Tarski’s well-known observation concerning close connection between the
so-called mereological structures (which are models of elementary mereology) and complete Boolean
algebras (an extensive description of this topic is given e.g., in [3] (especially Chapter 3 (pp. 91–107))).
Our aim will be now to interpret the formalism of Soboci´nski in ZFM and to reconsider his
deﬁnition of the universe.
We take mereology expressed in a slightly different language than OML. We use a ﬁrst-order
language with two primitive predicates ε and ⊏⋆. The second one may be understood in OML as a
part relation by:
(⊏⋆) x ⊏⋆y ↔xεpt(y).
We call this version of mereology OML⊏⋆and characterize it by all theorems of ﬁrst-order logic
(QL), speciﬁc axiom of ontology AO and the following counterparts of AM1–AM4:
AM1⊏⋆
∀x∀y∀z(x ⊏⋆y ∧y ⊏⋆z →x ⊏⋆z)
AM2⊏⋆
∀x∀y(x ⊏⋆y →¬(y ⊏⋆x))
AM3⊏⋆
∀x∀y∀z(xSum⋆z ∧ySum⋆z →x =⋆y)
AM4⊏⋆
∀z∀y(yεz →∃x(xSum⋆z))
where:
(=⋆)
∀x∀y(x =⋆y ↔xεy ∧yεx)
(Sum⋆)
xSum⋆z ↔xεx ∧∀y(yεz →y ⊑⋆x) ∧∀y(y ⊑⋆x →∃u∃v(uεz ∧v ⊑⋆u ∧v ⊑⋆y))
(⊑⋆)
x ⊑⋆y ↔x ⊏⋆y ∨x =⋆y
We accept all ⊏⋆counterparts of the OML deﬁnitions mentioned above.
Primitive rules are as of OML.
Actually, we want to deﬁne in ZFM predicates ε , ⊏⋆and the notion of the universe that depends
on them.
We start with the extension of ZFM by the following equivalence introducing predicate M:
(M)
∀z(Mz ↔Zz ∧∀x∀y(ySumx ∧x ⊆z →y ∈z) ∧∀x∀y(y ∈z ∧x ⊏y →x ∈z))
Predicate M is applied to every object z which is also a set, every mereological sum of each its
subset is an element of z, every part of every element of z is an element of z.
We note:
Fact 8. In ZFM+M it is derivable that ∃xMx.
From axioms of ZF we get: ∃!u(Zu ∧∀y(¬y ∈u)). We name this set ∅.
∅fulﬁlls M because ¬∃z(zSum∅) and ¬∃y(y ∈∅).
Let us ﬁx any element z fulﬁlling M.
Depending on this choice we deﬁne predicate Uz:
(Uz)
∀x(Uzx ↔Mz ∧x ⊆z)

Axioms 2016, 5, 23
11 of 13
We also know that ∃y Uzy, because ∀x(Zx →∃y y ⊆x).
We take two axioms more:
(ε)
∀x∀y(xεy ↔Uzx ∧Uzy ∧x ⊆y ∧∃!v(v ∈x))
(⊏⋆)
∀x∀y(x ⊏⋆y ↔Uzx ∧Uzy ∧∃!u∃!v(v ∈x ∧u ∈y ∧v ⊏u)).
We consider an interpretation function of the OML⊏⋆language in a fragment of the
ZFM+{M, z, ε, ⊏⋆} language which we name Iz (we follow [13] (pp. 61–65)). For every formula
A of the OML⊏⋆language we deﬁne formula Iz(A) belonging to the ZFM+{M, z, ε, ⊏⋆} language in
the following way: (i) every subformula of A of the shape ∀xB or ∃xB we retype with a modiﬁcation,
respectively: ∀x(Uzx →B), ∃x(Uzx ∧B) and (ii) every subformula B of A with {x1, ..., xn} = FV(B)
we retype with preﬁx: Uzx1 →(Uzx2 →(· · · →(Uzxn →B) . . . )).
Let us take the name ZFMMz for the considered extension of ZFM.
Now we can observe that
Fact 9. For every axiom A of OML⊏⋆: ZFMMz ⊢Iz(A).
To prove Iz(AO) we need only (ε). Iz(AM1⊏⋆) and Iz(AM2⊏⋆) are derivable using (⊏⋆), AM1⊏and
AM2⊏. To prove Iz(AM3⊏⋆) and Iz(AM4⊏⋆) we use the following: ∀x∀y∀v(Uzx ∧Uzy ∧v ∈x ∧∀u(u ∈
x →u = v) →(xSum⋆y ↔vSumy)) (here we use essentially the second and third part of the conjunction
occurring on the right side of equivalence M).
Because of the interpretation theorem [13] (pp. 62–63), for any chosen z fulﬁlling M we can speak
about theory Iz(OML⊏⋆) which consists of all Iz interpretations of theorems of OML⊏⋆. Of course:
Iz(OML⊏⋆) ⊊ZFMMz.
Let us now come back to our notion of the universe considered by Soboci´nski.
We introduce constant Wz dependent on z:
(Wz)
∀x(xε Wz ↔Uzx ∧xεx)
and constant Wz representing the universe dependent on z:
(Wz)
∀x(xεWz ↔Uzx ∧xSum⋆Wz)
We take the symbol F: F(x) = y ↔ySumx. The abstract operator is a metatheoretical symbol
used just as in [3] (p. 175).
Now we can speak about different ‘Universes’, depending on the chosen z. Remember that in
OML we have already considered ’local’ universes which fulﬁlled condition Kl(z)εz (cf. (***), Fact 7)).
Now every universe z is ’global’ and we could speak about ’local’ universes which are certain subsets
of z.
Let us give selected examples of chosen z.
Example 1. At ﬁrst we consider an extension of ZFM : the Unitary Theory of Individuals and Sets (UTIS)
described in [3] (pp. 172–181).
In UTIS ur-elements called individuals are considered in the following sense:
(Ind)
Indx ↔∀y(y ⊑x →¬Zy)
To get UTIS from ZFM we add two axioms concerning the existence of individuals which form
a set:
(i1)
∃xIndx
(i2)
∃y∀x(x ∈y ↔Indx)
From the extensionality axiom we know that ∃!y∀x(x ∈y ↔Indx) and we name the set of all
individuals i. The set i fulﬁlls M. We can prove in UTIS both ∀x∀y(ySumx ∧x ⊆i →y ∈i) ([3] (FT’, 181))
and ∀x∀y(y ∈i ∧x ⊏y →x ∈i) (directly from Ind).

Axioms 2016, 5, 23

Now we choose z = i and from (Wi) and (Wi) we obtain Wi = i and xεWi ↔xSum⋆Wi.
Just because i ̸= ∅and AM4⊏⋆, we also know that ∃x(xεWi). By the way, although Wi is composed
of individuals, they do not need to be atoms.
Example 2. Let us stay in ZFMMz and take z = ∅. We know that M∅. Now W∅= ∅and ¬∃x(xεW∅)
Example 3. In ZFM we can prove the existence of the set {∅, {∅}, F(∅, {∅})} which fulﬁlls M. Now we
choose z = {∅, {∅}, F(∅, {∅})}.
In this case: xεWz ↔∃!y(y ∈x ∧y = F(∅, {∅})).
As we wrote at the beginning of our article, Soboci´nski claimed that the mereological tools are
more suitable for philosophical investigations than set theoretical ones. Actually, the connotations
linked with the term ”the Universe” and expressed in quoted theses are not dependent on some speciﬁc
properties of individuals or their mereological whole. As it can be seen their proofs may be presented
using only two steps. In the ﬁrst step we use the fact that the mereological class of all objects is an
object (if there is at least one object). Then we take (∗∗∗) and get implications with consequents of
the same structure as the appropriate theorems of Soboci´nski, with a restricted quantiﬁcation to z and
with antecedent Kl(z)εz. Now we obtain S1→— S11 via dictum de omni and taking (W).
ZFM gave us the possibility of looking at Soboci´nski’s approach from a wider perspective, but also
showed that the questioned philosophical expectations linked with (W) would be too high. Although
we could ﬁnd the intended interpretation of the notion of W described in Example 1, we found also
some undesirable cases: in Example 2 the universe is empty and in Example 3 the universe consists
of distributive sets. After all, Example 1 also is far insufﬁcient to realize the idea of ’the Universe
created’ by God expressed in Soboci´nski’s quoted reﬂection. In this case, God would need to be singled
out from the set of all individuals and to stay in some causal relation to other individuals. The given
characteristics of W of course does not depend on any such a construction and can be treated at most
as the starting point of next philosophical investigation.
