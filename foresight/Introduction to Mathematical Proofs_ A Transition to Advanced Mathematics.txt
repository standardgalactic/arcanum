Preface to the Second Edition
First, I wish to thank my students, colleagues, and readers for indicating
where they thought additional examples would be beneﬁcial and for suggesting
more topics to include in the text. Those suggestions have led to the inclusion
of several new examples and topics in the second edition. Additional examples
were included in the text to help students better understand concepts which
are being introduced to them for the ﬁrst time. For instance, an example
was included in the text of a proof of the triangle inequality by cases which
requires four cases.
In order to help students know exactly where proofs to lemmas and proofs
to theorems end and where examples end, I have placed at the end of proofs
and examples the black square symbol ■.
Certainly, the most noticeable change between the second edition and the
ﬁrst edition, is the inclusion of more than 125 new exercises in sections titled
More Challenging Exercises. These sections appear in the review exercises
at the end of each of the ﬁrst seven chapters. Students who like to be chal-
lenged should beneﬁt greatly from these exercises. For instance, in the More
Challenging Exercises at the end of Chapter 1 new topics such as the binary
operators nand, nor, and the Sheﬀer stroke are introduced and explored. In
Chapter 2 in the section More Challenging Exercises the Fano plane is exam-
ined and problems of the type “Statement. Theorem? Proof?” are introduced
for the ﬁrst time. Problems of this kind also appear in Chapters 3 through
6. In these problems, a statement is given, and the student is to decide if the
statement is true or false. If the statement is true, it is a theorem, and the
student must then determine if the given proof is valid or invalid. If the proof
is valid, the student is done. If the proof is invalid, the student is asked to
produce a valid proof. If the statement is false, then, of course, the proof is
invalid.
I thank my editor, Robert Ross, for his able assistance, guidance, and en-
couragement throughout the revision process. I thank Ken Rosen for his very
insightful comments and suggestions. And ﬁnally, I thank the production staﬀ
at Taylor & Francis/CRC Press for their eﬀorts in developing this second edi-
tion.

Preface
This text is written for undergraduate mathematics majors and minors who
have previously taken only computationally oriented, problem solving math-
ematics courses. Usually these students are freshmen and sophomores. The
primary objectives of the text are to teach the reader (1) to reason logically,
(2) to read the proofs of others critically, and (3) to write valid mathematical
proofs. We intend to help students develop the skills necessary to write cor-
rect, clear, and concise proofs. Ultimately, we endeavor to prepare students
to succeed in more advanced mathematics courses such as abstract algebra,
analysis, and geometry where they are expected to write proofs and construct
counterexamples instead of performing computations and solving problems.
The aim of the text is to facilitate a smooth transition from courses designed
to develop computational skills and problem solving abilities to courses which
emphasize theorem proving.
Logic is presented in Chapter 1, because logic is the underlying language of
mathematics, because logic is the basis of all reasoned argument, and because
logic developed earliest historically. This text may well be the only place in
the undergraduate mathematics curriculum where a student is introduced to
the study of logic. Knowing logic should beneﬁt students not only in future
mathematics courses but in other facets of their lives as well. Formal proofs
are included, because each step in a formal proof requires a justiﬁcation.
And students need to understand that when they write an informal proof,
each statement should be justiﬁed unless the justiﬁcation is apparent to the
reader.
In Chapter 2, deductive mathematical systems are deﬁned and discussed.
Various proof techniques are presented, and each proof technique is illustrated
with several examples. Some theorems are proved using more than one proof
technique, so that the reader may compare and contrast the techniques. The
role of conjectures in mathematics is introduced, and proof and disproof of
conjectures are explored. Interesting conjectures which recently have been
proved true or disproved, and conjectures which still remain open are stated
and discussed. The integers and their properties are developed from the ax-
ioms and properties of the natural numbers; the rational numbers and their
properties are derived from the integers; and, ﬁnally, the method for develop-
ing the system of real numbers from the rational numbers is described.
Elementary topics in set theory are presented in Chapter 3. A thorough
understanding of basic set theory is necessary for success in advanced mathe-
matics courses. In addition, using set notation promotes precision and clarity
xiii

when communicating mathematical ideas.
Relations and functions play a major role in many branches of mathematics
and the sciences. Therefore, in Chapters 4 and 5, relations and functions are
deﬁned and their various properties are examined in detail.
In Chapter 6, proof by mathematical induction, in its various forms, is
introduced and several theorems are proved using induction.
The last three chapters, which are optional, introduce the reader to the
concept of cardinalities of sets (Chapter 7), and to the concepts and proofs in
real analysis (Chapter 8) and in group theory (Chapter 9).
The appendix discusses reading and writing proofs and includes some basic
guidelines to follow when writing proofs. We encourage students to read the
appendix more than once during the semester and to use it as a reference
when writing proofs.
Several diﬀerent syllabi can be designed for this text depending upon the
previous preparation and mathematical maturity of the students and the
goals, objectives, and preferences of the instructor.
Chapters 1 through 6
constitute the core of the course we teach during one semester. When time
permits, we present some additional topics from Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
Features of the Text. This text is written in a friendly, conversational
style, yet it maintains the proper level of mathematical rigor. Most sections
are of appropriate length for presentation in one lecture session. Several bio-
graphical sketches and historical comments have been included to enrich and
enliven the text. Generally, mathematics is presented as a continually evolving
discipline, and the material presented should fulﬁll the needs of students with
a wide range of backgrounds. Numerous technical terms which the student
will encounter in more advanced courses are deﬁned and illustrated. Many
theorems from diﬀerent disciplines in mathematics and of varying degrees of
complexity are stated and proved.
Numerous examples illustrate in detail
how to write proofs and show how to solve problems. These examples serve
as models for students to emulate when solving exercises. Exercises of varying
diﬃculty appear at the end of each section.
Acknowledgments. This text evolved from lecture notes for a course
which I have taught at Indiana State University for a number of years. I would
like to thank my students and my colleagues for their support, encouragement,
and constructive criticisms. Also, I would like to thank my editor Robert Stern
and my project coordinator Stephanie Morkert of Taylor & Francis/CRC Press
for their assistance in bringing this text to fruition.

Chapter 1
Logic
There are many deﬁnitions of logic; however, we will consider logic to be
the study of the methods and principles used to distinguish valid reasoning
from invalid reasoning. Logic is a part of mathematics; moreover, in a broad
sense, it is the language of mathematics.
In this chapter, we will study elementary symbolic logic. Logic is the basis of
all reasoned argument, and therefore logic is the basis for valid mathematical
proofs. The study of logic as a body of knowledge in Western Civilization
originated with Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), one of the greatest philosophers of
ancient Greece.
He was a student of Plato for twenty years (from 367 to
347 B.C., when Plato died). Later, Aristotle tutored Alexander the Great,
and in 334 B.C. he founded his own school of philosophy in the Lyceum. After
his death, Aristotle’s writings on reasoning were collected together in a body
of work called the Organon. The contents of the Organon is the basis for the
subject of logic, although the word “logic” did not acquire its current meaning
until the second century A.D. The word “logic” is a derivative of the Greek
word logos, which translates into English as “word,”“speech,” or “reason.”
Aristotle was the ﬁrst to develop rules for correct reasoning. However, he
expressed logic in ordinary language, and, consequently, it was subject to the
ambiguities of natural language. At an early age, the German philosopher,
mathematician, and logician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was not
satisﬁed with Aristotelian logic and began to develop his own ideas. He had
a lifelong goal of developing a universal language and a calculus of reasoning.
His idea was that the principles of reasoning could be reduced to a formal
symbolic system in which controversies (not just mathematical ones) could
be settled by calculations. Thus, Leibniz envisioned an algebra or calculus
of thought. He made some strides toward his goal, but his work was largely
forgotten.
The English mathematician and logician August De Morgan (1806–1871)
presented ideas for improving classical logic in the 1840s. The key ideas he
contributed in his text Formal Logic (1847) include the introduction of the
concept of a universe of discourse; names for contraries; disjunction, con-
junction, and negation of propositions; abbreviated notation for propositions;
compound names; and notation for syllogisms. De Morgan intended to im-
prove the syllogism and use it as the main device in reasoning. In order to
ensure there were names for the contraries of compound names, he stated the
1

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
famous De Morgan Laws. By creating some of the most basic concepts of
modern logic, De Morgan contributed substantially to the change that was
taking place in logic in the mid-1800s. However, his notational system was
viewed as too complex, so he received little credit for the development of
modern logic.
The English mathematician George Boole (1815–1864) is generally credited
with founding the modern algebra of logic and hence symbolic logic. At the
age of sixteen, Boole was an assistant teacher. In 1835, he opened his own
school and began to study mathematics on his own. He never attended an
institution of higher learning. He taught himself all of the higher mathematics
he knew. In 1840, he began to publish papers on analysis in the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal. In 1847, Boole published the text The Mathematical
Analysis of Logic. Initially, Boole wanted to express all the statements of
classical logic as equations and then apply algebraic transformations to derive
the known valid arguments of logic. Near the end of writing the text, Boole
realized that his algebra of logic applied to any ﬁnite collection of premises
with any number of symbols. Boole’s logic was limited to what is presently
called the propositional calculus. It is the propositional calculus we will
study in this chapter.
1.1
Statements, Negation, and Compound Statements
In the English language, sentences are classiﬁed according to their usage.
A declarative sentence makes a statement.
An imperative sentence
gives a command or makes a request. An interrogative sentence asks a
question. And an exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling. Consider
the following sentences:
1. Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana.
2. Tell Tom I will be home later.
3. What time is it?
4. I wish you were here!
The ﬁrst sentence is declarative, the second sentence is imperative, the third
sentence is interrogative, and the fourth sentence is exclamatory. However, the
same sentence can be written to be declarative, interrogative, or exclamatory.
For instance,
We won the game. [declarative]
We won the game? [interrogative]
We won the game! [exclamatory]
The declarative sentence “Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana” is “true”
while the sentence “Minneapolis is the capital of Indiana” is “false.”

Logic
3
Symbolic logic applies only to special declarative sentences which are called
statements or propositions.
A statement or proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true
or false, but not both true and false.
The terms true and false are left undeﬁned, but it is assumed that their
meaning is intuitively understood. Some declarative sentences might be true
or false depending on the context or circumstance. Such sentences are not
considered to be statements.
For example, the sentences “She is hungry,”
“He is handsome,” and “Chicago is far away” depend upon one’s deﬁnition of
“hungry,” “handsome,” and “far away.” Consequently, such sentences are not
statements, because they do not have a “truth value”—that is, because it is
not possible to determine whether they are true or false. There are statements
for which we do not know the truth value. For example, we do not know the
truth value of Goldbach’s conjecture, which states:
“Every even integer greater than two can be written as the sum
of two prime numbers.”
Observe that 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, and 10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5.
To date, mathematicians have not been able to prove or disprove Goldbach’s
conjecture; however, it is a declarative sentence that is either true or false
and not both true and false. Thus, Goldbach’s conjecture is a statement or
proposition in symbolic logic. Christian Goldbach made his famous conjecture
in a letter written to Leonhard Euler on June 7, 1742. By October 2003,
T. Oliveira e Salva had shown Goldbach’s conjecture to be true for all even
natural numbers less than 6 × 1016.
In order to understand the statement of Goldbach’s conjecture completely,
you need to know the following deﬁnitions. The set of natural numbers is
the set N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}. The natural numbers are also called the counting
numbers and the positive integers. The basic theorems for the natural
numbers appear in Section 2.1 and may be used in proofs which involve natural
numbers. Let a and b be natural numbers. The number a divides b if there
exists a natural number c such that ac = b. A prime number is a natural
number greater than one which is divisible only by itself and one.
Example 1.1.1 Determine which of the following sentences is a statement.
a. How old are you?
b. x + 3 = 5
c. 2300 is a large number.
d. Help!
e. The author of this text was born in Washington, DC.
f. This sentence is false.

4
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Solution
a. The sentence is a question (an interrogative sentence), and therefore it
is not a statement.
b. The declarative sentence “x + 3 = 5” is true for x = 2 and false for all
other values of x, so it is not a statement.
c. The declarative sentence “2300 is a large number” is not a statement,
because the deﬁnition of “a large number” is not well-deﬁned.
d. The sentence “Help!” is exclamatory, and hence it is not a statement.
e. The declarative sentence “The author of this text was born in Washing-
ton, DC” is true or false, but not both true and false, so it is a statement,
even though few people would know whether the statement is true or false.
f. The declarative sentence “This sentence is false” is an interesting sen-
tence. If we assign the truth value “true” or the truth value “false” to this
sentence, we have a contradiction. Hence the sentence is not a statement.
Because the sentence “This sentence is false” is neither “true” nor “false,” it
is called a paradox.
■
All statements can be divided into two types—simple and compound. A
simple statement (simple proposition) is a statement which does not con-
tain any other statement as a component part. Every compound statement
(compound proposition) is a statement that does contain another state-
ment as a component part. Every statement we have examined thus far is a
simple statement. Compound statements are formed from simple statements
using the logical connectives “and,” “or,” and “not.”
Let P denote a statement. The negation of P, denoted by ¬ P, is the state-
ment “not P.” The negation of P is false when P is true, and the negation of
P is true when P is false. For example, the negation of the statement “Five
is a prime” is the statement “Five is not a prime.” And the negation of the
statement “Six is an odd number” is the statement “Six is not an odd
number.” In English, it is also possible to indicate the negation of a statement
by preﬁxing the statement with the phrase “it is not the case that,” “it is false
that,” or “it is not true that.” For instance, the statement “It is not true that
gold is heavier than lead” is true.
The conjunction of two statements P, Q, denoted by P ∧Q, is the state-
ment “P and Q.” The conjunction of P and Q is true if and only if both P and
Q are true. Let M be the statement “It is Monday” and let R be the statement
“It is raining.” The statement M ∧R is “It is Monday, and it is raining.” In
English, several other words such as “but,” “yet,” “also,” “still,” “although,”
“however,” “moreover,” “nonetheless,” and others, as well as the comma and
semicolon, can mean “and” in their conjunctive sense. For instance, the state-
ment “It is Monday; moreover, it is raining” should be translated to symbolic
logic as M ∧R.

Logic
5
The disjunction of two statements P, Q, denoted by P ∨Q, is the state-
ment “P or Q.” The disjunction of P and Q is true if P is true, if Q is true, or
if both P and Q are true. In English, the word “or” has two related but distin-
guishable meanings. The “or” appearing in the deﬁnition of disjunction is the
inclusive or. The inclusive or means “one or the other or both.” In legal
documents, the meaning of the inclusive “or” is often made more explicit by
using the phrase “and/or.” For example, the statement “This contract may
be signed by John and/or Mary” means the contract is legally binding when
signed by John, by Mary, or by both. On the other hand, the exclusive or
means “one or the other but not both.” For example, the statement “Ann will
marry Ben or Ann will marry Ted” means either Ann will marry Ben or Ann
will marry Ted but not both. In Latin there are two diﬀerent words for the
word “or.” The word vel denotes the inclusive or, while the word aut denotes
the exclusive or.
In the following two examples, we show how to write English statements in
symbolic form and how to write symbolic statements in English.
Example 1.1.2 Write the following statements in symbolic form using ¬, ∧,
and ∨.
a. Madrid is the capital of Spain and Paris is the capital of France.
b. Rome is the capital of Italy or London is the capital of England.
c. Rome is the capital of Italy, but London is not the capital of England.
d. Madrid is not the capital of Spain or Paris is not the capital of France.
e. Paris is the capital of France, but London is not the capital of England
or Madrid is the capital of Spain.
Solution
Let M stand for the statement “Madrid is the capital of Spain.”
Let P stand for the statement “Paris is the capital of France.”
Let R stand for the statement “Rome is the capital of Italy.”
Let L stand for the statement “London is the capital of England.”
a. The statement may be written in symbolic form as M ∧P.
b. The statement written in symbolic form is R ∨L.
c. In symbolic form, the statement may be written as R ∧(¬ L).
d. The statement in symbolic form is (¬ M) ∨(¬ P).
e. In symbolic form, the statement is P ∧( (¬ L) ∨M).
■
Example 1.1.3 Let C be the statement “Today the sky is clear.”
Let R be the statement “It did rain.”
Let S be the statement “It did snow.”
Let Y be the statement “Yesterday it was cloudy.”

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Write the following symbolic statements in English.
a. ¬ Y
b. R ∨S
c. Y ∧S
d. C ∧(¬ R) ∧(¬ S)
e. Y ∧(C ∨R)
Solution
a. The symbolic statement may be written as “Yesterday it was not cloudy.”
b. The statement may be written as “It did rain or it did snow.”
c. The symbolic statement may be written as “Yesterday it was cloudy and
it did snow.”
d. The statement may be written as “Today the sky is clear and it did not
rain and it did not snow.”
e. The statement may be written as “Yesterday it was cloudy, and today
the sky is clear or it did rain.”

Truth Tables and Logical Equivalences
Recall from Section 1.1 that a statement or proposition is a declarative
sentence that is either true or false, but not both true and false.

8
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The truth value of a statement is true (denoted by T) if the statement is
true and is false (denoted by F) if the statement is false.
A truth table is a table which shows the truth values of a statement for
all possible combinations of truth values of its simple statement components.
The German mathematician and philosopher Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob
Frege (1848–1925) is considered to be one of the founders of modern symbolic
logic. Frege believed that mathematics was reducible to logic. In 1879, he
published his ﬁrst major work Begriﬀsschrift, eine der arithmetischen nachge-
bildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens (Conceptual notation, a formal lan-
guage modeled on that of arithmetic, for pure thought). In this work, Frege
introduced a logical system with negation, implication, universal quantiﬁers,
and the idea of a truth table, although it was not presented in our current
notational form. Later, in 1893, Frege published Die Grundgesetze der Arith-
metik, I. (The Basic Laws of Arithmetic, I.). Here, he introduced the terms
“True” and “False” and described the truth value of the statement “P implies
Q” for each of the four possible combinations of truth values of P, Q. That is,
he verbally described the truth table for P implies Q (which we will study in
the next section), but he did not display an actual truth table.
Let P represent a statement. P may have the truth value T or the truth
value F. By deﬁnition, the negation of P, ¬ P, is false when P is true and true
when P is false. Consequently, the truth table for ¬ P is as follows:
Negation
P
¬ P
T
F
F
T
Since this truth table explains completely the result of negating the statement
P, it may be taken as the deﬁnition of ¬ P, the negation of P. The negation
symbol “¬” is a unary logical operator. The term “unary” means the
operator acts on a single statement.
Let S be a compound statement which contains only the one simple state-
ment P. In order to list all of the possible combinations of truth values for P,
the truth table for S must have exactly two rows. In this case, the standard
truth table form for the statement S is
P
· · ·
S
T
· · ·
·
F
· · ·
·
The ﬁrst entry in the column labeled P must be T and the second entry in the
column must be F. The dots, · · ·, indicate the possible presence of columns
of truth values with appropriate headings needed to “build up” the statement
S.

Logic
9
Next, let P and Q represent two simple statements.
In order to list all
of the possible combinations of truth values of P, Q, the truth table for any
compound statement S containing exactly the two simple statements P and
Q will have exactly four rows. In this case, the standard truth table form
for the statement S is
P
Q
· · ·
S
T
T
· · ·
·
T
F
· · ·
·
F
T
· · ·
·
F
F
· · ·
·
To be in standard form, the truth value entries must be exactly as shown in
the ﬁrst two columns.
Since the conjunction of P, Q, the statement P ∧Q, is true if and only if
both P and Q are true, the truth table for P ∧Q is as follows:
Conjunction
P
Q
P ∧Q
T
T
T
T
F
F
F
T
F
F
F
F
Since this truth table explains completely the result of conjuncting the state-
ment P with the statement Q, it may be taken as the deﬁnition of P ∧Q. The
conjunction symbol “∧” is a binary logical operator. The term “binary”
means the operator acts on two statements.
The disjunction symbol “∨” is also a binary logical operator and its deﬁning
truth table is
Disjunction
P
Q
P ∨Q

Example 1.2.1
Given that A and B are true statements and that C and
D are false statements, use the deﬁnitions of ¬ , ∧, and ∨to determine the
truth value of each of the statements:
a. (¬ A) ∧B
b. ¬ (A ∧B)
c. (¬ A) ∨B
d. ¬ (A ∨C)
e. (A ∨C) ∧(B ∧(¬ D))

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Solution
a.
Since A is true, ¬ A is false. Since the conjunction of a false state-
ment, ¬ A, and a true statement, B, is a false statement, the statement
(¬ A) ∧B is false.
b.
Since A is true and B is true, their conjunction A ∧B is true. Because
the negation of a true statement is a false statement,¬ (A ∧B) is false.
c.
Since A is true, ¬ A is false. Because the disjunction of a false state-
ment, ¬ A, and a true statement, B, is a true statement, the statement
(¬ A) ∨B is true.
d.
Since A is true and C is false, their disjunction A ∨C is true. Since
the negation of a true statement is a false statement, the statement
¬ (A ∨C) is false.
e.
Since A is true and C is false, (A ∨C) is true. Since D is false, ¬ D is
true. Since B is true and ¬ D is true, their conjunction (B ∧( ¬ D)) is
true. Because (A ∨C) is true and (B ∧(¬ D)) is true, their conjunction
(A ∨C) ∧(B ∧(¬ D)) is true.
■
Now let us consider the following question: “How many diﬀerent truth tables
are possible for statements which contain exactly one simple statement P?”
The truth table for the statement P is
P
P
T

F

And the truth table for the statement ¬ P is

and
(2b)

We know that the second column of truth values in (1) is the negation of the
ﬁrst column, since these columns came from the truth table for the negation
of P. Taking the negation of the ﬁrst column of truth values in (2a), we get
the second column of truth values in (2b). So, if we could write a statement
containing P which is true when P is true and also true when P is false, then
we would have a statement that was always true regardless of the truth value
of P. By negating that statement we could obtain a statement which is always
false regardless of the truth value of P. Let us construct a truth table for the
statement P ∨(¬ P). As shown in (3), we start with the truth table for ¬ P
and add a new column on the right of the table labeled P ∨(¬ P) .
(3)
P
¬ P
P ∨(¬ P)
T
F
F
T
In the ﬁrst row of the truth table (3), the statement P has truth value T and
the statement ¬ P has the truth value F, so the disjunction P ∨(¬ P) has the
truth value T. In the second row of the truth table (3), the statement P has
truth value F and the statement ¬ P has the truth value T, so the disjunc-
tion P∨(¬P) has the truth value T. Thus, the truth table for the statement
P∨(¬ P) is as shown in (4).
(4)

Notice that regardless of the truth value of the statement P, the truth value
of the statement P ∨(¬ P) is true and the truth value of the statement
¬ (P ∨(¬ P)) is false.
A tautology is a statement that is true for every assignment of truth values
of its component statements. A contradiction is a statement that is false
for every assignment of truth values of its component statements. Thus, a
contradiction is the negation of a tautology. The statement P ∨(¬ P) is the
simplest example of a tautology, and its negation, ¬ ( P ∨(¬ P)), is an example
of a contradiction, but it is not written in the simplest possible form. We will
show how to simplify this expression later in this section. Two statements are
truth value equivalent or logically equivalent if and only if they have
the same truth values for all assignments of truth values to their component
statements. It follows from the deﬁnition above that two statements which
appear in the same truth table are logically equivalent if and only if their
truth value columns are identical. Two statements which appear in diﬀerent
truth tables are logically equivalent if and only if both tables are in standard
form, both tables are for statements with the same components, and their
truth value columns are identical.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
We need to develop an algebra for symbolic logic, so we can make calcu-
lations similar to the way in which we make algebraic calculations for real
numbers. One algebraic property of real numbers is that −(−x) = x. So
let us produce a truth value table for the statement ¬ (¬ P). We start our
truth table with a row of column headings labeled P, ¬ P, and ¬ (¬ P). In
the column labeled P, we enter as the ﬁrst entry T and as the second entry
F. (See 5a.) Then using the negation truth table, we compute the entries for
the second column labeled ¬ P. Since negation changes the truth value T to
F and the truth value F to T, the ﬁrst entry in the second column is F and
the second entry is T. (See 5b.) Applying negation to the second column, the
column labeled ¬ P, we obtain T for the ﬁrst entry in the third column and
F for the second entry. (See 5c.)

Observe that the truth value entries in the ﬁrst column of (5c) are identical
to the truth value entries in the third column. Hence, we have shown that
the statements P and ¬ (¬ P) are truth value equivalent. In order to denote
that P and ¬ (¬ P) are truth value equivalent or logically equivalent, we write
P ≡¬ (¬ P), which is read “P is truth value equivalent to ¬ (¬ P)” or “P is
logically equivalent to ¬ (¬ P).” Thus, we have used a truth table to prove
the Double Negation Law: ¬(¬ P) ≡P.
Let t represent a statement which is a tautology, let f represent a statement
which is a contradiction, and let P represent any statement. We state the
following useful laws involving tautologies and contradictions. The following
eight laws can easily be proved by using truth tables.
Tautology Laws:
¬ t ≡f
P ∧t ≡P
P ∨t ≡t
Contradiction Laws:
¬ f ≡t
P ∧f ≡f
P ∨f ≡P
Idempotent Law for Conjunction:
P ∧P ≡P
Idempotent Law for Disjunction:
P ∨P ≡P
Commutative Law for Conjunction:
P ∧Q ≡Q ∧P
Commutative Law for Disjunction:
P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P
Absorption Laws:
P ∧(P ∨Q) ≡P
P ∨(P ∧Q) ≡P

Logic
13
Earlier, we proved that ¬ (¬ P) was logically equivalent to P—that is,
we proved that ¬ (¬ P)≡P. We noted that this property was analogous to
the algebraic property −(−x) = x for real numbers.
We would now like
to determine what statement is logically equivalent to the negation of the
conjunction of P and Q. Thus, we would like to be able to complete the
statement ¬ (P ∧Q) ≡
. A possible analogy from algebra for the real
numbers might be −(x+y) = (−x)+(−y). That is, we might anticipate that
the statement ¬ (P ∧Q) is logically equivalent to the statement (¬ P) ∧(¬ Q).
To determine if this is true or not, we construct two standard form truth
tables—one for ¬ (P ∧Q) and one for (¬ P) ∧(¬ Q)—and then see if the
truth value column for ¬ (P ∧Q) is identical to the truth value column for
(¬ P) ∧(¬ Q) or not.
The standard form truth table for ¬ (P ∧Q), which appears in (6a), was
constructed by adjoining a new fourth column labeled ¬ (P ∧Q) on the right
hand side of the conjunction truth table for P ∧Q and then negating the
truth values appearing in the third column—the column labeled P ∧Q.
The truth table for (¬ P) ∧(¬ Q), which appears in (6b), was constructed by
making column headings P, Q, ¬ P, ¬ Q, and (¬ P) ∧(¬ Q). The truth values
for the columns labeled P and Q were ﬁlled in as usual. Then the truth values
for the third column were calculated by negating the truth values appearing
in the ﬁrst column. The truth values for the fourth column were calculated
by negating the truth values appearing in the second column. Finally, the
truth values for the ﬁfth column were calculated from the conjunction of the
truth values appearing in the third and fourth columns.

Because the right most columns of the two tables in (6a) and (6b) are not
identical, ¬ (P ∧Q) is not logically equivalent to (¬ P) ∧(¬ Q) as we had
anticipated it might be.
Assuming a statement which is logically equivalent to ¬ (P ∧Q) ought to
include the statement (¬ P) and the statement (¬ Q), we decided to com-
pute the truth table for (¬ P) ∨(¬ Q). To produce this truth table, we
simply change the column heading appearing in the ﬁfth column of (6b) from

14
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
(¬ P) ∧(¬ Q) to (¬ P) ∨(¬ Q) and compute the truth values for the
new ﬁfth column from the disjunction of the truth values appearing in the
third and fourth columns.
The required truth table appears in (7).
Ob-
serve that the column of truth values labeled ¬ (P ∧Q) in (6a) is iden-
tical to the column of truth values labeled (¬ P) ∨(¬ Q) in (7). Hence,
¬ (P ∧Q) ≡(¬ P) ∨(¬ Q)—that is, ¬ (P ∧Q) is logically equivalent to
(¬ P) ∨(¬ Q). We have just proved the ﬁrst of the two De Morgan laws
stated below.

De Morgan Laws:
¬ (P ∧Q) ≡(¬ P) ∨(¬ Q)
¬ (P ∨Q) ≡(¬ P) ∧(¬ Q)
Example 1.2.2 Negate the statement “I will get up and I will go to school.”
Solution
It is correct to say: “It is not the case that I will get up and I will go to
school.” However, using the De Morgan ¬ (P ∧Q) ≡(¬ P)∨(¬ Q), we can
express the negation better as “I will not get up or I will not go to school.”
■
In order to prove logical equivalences algebraically, we need the following
Rule of Substitution:
Let P and Q be statements. Let C(P) be a compound statement containing
the statement P. And let C(Q) be the same compound statement in which
each occurrence of P is replaced by Q. If P and Q are logically equivalent,
then C(P) and C(Q) are logically equivalent. That is,
If P ≡Q, then C(P) ≡C(Q).
Example 1.2.3 Using stated laws and the rule of substitution, prove alge-
braically that P ∧Q ≡¬ ((¬ P) ∨(¬ Q)).
Solution
1.
P ∧Q ≡¬(¬(P ∧Q))
By the double negation law
2.
¬(P ∧Q) ≡(¬P) ∨(¬Q)
By a De Morgan law
3.
P ∧Q ≡¬((¬P) ∨(¬Q))
By the rule of substitution
(Substituting 2 into 1)
■

Logic
15
Example 1.2.3 proves that it is logically possible to eliminate the conjunc-
tion operator, ∧, because the operator can be expressed in terms of the nega-
tion operator, ¬, and the disjunction operator, ∨. Hence, all statements could
be written using ¬ and ∨only. If we were to write the statement “I will get
up and I will go to school” using only “not” and “or” as indicated in 3, we
would have to write “It is not the case that I will not get up or I will not go to
school.” Clearly, you can see why we prefer to use all three logical operators
“not,” “and,” and “or.” A proof similar to the one presented in Example
1.2.3 can be constructed to show that P∨Q ≡¬((¬P)∧(¬Q)). Consequently,
every statement could be written in terms of ¬ and ∧only.
Example 1.2.4
Earlier, we showed that the statement ¬ (P ∨(¬ P)) is a
contradiction. Simplify this contradiction using stated laws and the rule of
substitution.
Solution
1.
¬(P ∨(¬P)) ≡(¬P) ∧(¬(¬P))
By a De Morgan law
2.
¬(¬P) ≡P
By the double negation law
3.
¬(P ∨(¬P)) ≡(¬P) ∧P
By the rule of substitution
(Substituting 2 into 1)
■
Since ¬(P ∨(¬P)) is a contradiction, its logical equivalent (¬P) ∧P is a
contradiction also.
The contradiction (¬P) ∧P is called the law of the
excluded middle.
The fact that the statement (¬P) ∧P is always false
simply means that “not P” and “P” cannot both be true simultaneously.
One algebraic property of the real numbers is the distributive law. The
distributive law for real numbers says “For all real numbers x, y, and z,
x · (y + z) = (x · y) + (x · z).” Thus, “multiplication distributes over ad-
dition.” Analogously in logic, if disjunction is to distribute over conjunction,
we must be able to prove P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R). We have seen that
a truth table for a compound statement which contains exactly one simple
statement P has two rows and that a truth table for a compound statement
which contains exactly two simple statements P and Q has four rows. Thus,
a truth table for a compound statement which contains exactly three simple
statements P, Q, and R has eight rows, since P can assume two values (T or
F), Q can assume two values, R can assume two values, and 2×2×2 = 8. We
construct two truth tables in standard form—one for P ∨(Q ∧R) and one for
(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R). Hence, we construct one truth table with column headings
P, Q, R, Q ∧R, and P∨(Q ∧R). And we construct a second truth table with
column headings P, Q, R, (P ∨Q), (P ∨R), and (P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R). In each
table, we ﬁll in the columns for P, Q, and R as shown and then successively
calculate the columns of the table.

Since the truth values appearing in the column P ∨(Q ∧R) are identical to
the truth values appearing in the column (P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R), we have proven
the distributive law for disjunction: P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R). The
distributive law for conjunction and the associative laws for disjunction and
conjunction stated below can easily be proved using truth tables.
Distributive Law for Disjunction:
P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R)
Distributive Law for Conjunction: P ∧(Q ∨R) ≡(P ∧Q) ∨(P ∧R)
Associative Law for Disjunction:

distinguishable meanings. The “inclusive or,” ∨, is the “or” used
most generally in mathematics and it means “one or the other or
both.” The “exclusive or” means “one or the other but not both.”
We will let ▽denote the “exclusive or,” which is deﬁned by the
truth table

Conditional and Biconditional Statements
Statements of the form “If P, then Q” occur often and are very impor-
tant in mathematics. The statement “If P, then Q” is called a conditional
statement, the statement P is called the hypothesis or antecedent of
the conditional statement, and the statement Q is called the conclusion or
consequent of the conditional statement. For example, in the conditional
statement “If n is a prime number greater than two, then n is odd,” the hy-
pothesis is “n is a prime number greater than two” and the conclusion is “n
is odd.” Of course, conditional statements occur in everyday life as well. For
instance, you might recall conditional statements such as “If you clean your
room, then you may go to a movie” or “If you mow the grass, I will pay you
twenty-ﬁve dollars.”
A conditional statement asserts that its hypothesis implies its conclusion.
The conditional statement itself does not assert that its hypothesis is true, but
only that if its hypothesis is true, then its conclusion is true. Furthermore, the
conditional statement does not assert that its conclusion is true, but only that
its conclusion is true if its hypothesis is true. Thus, when the hypothesis and
conclusion of a conditional statement are both true, we want the conditional
statement to be true. And when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is
false, we want the conditional statement to be false. We denote the statement
“If P, then Q” symbolically by P ⇒Q, which is read “P implies Q” or “If P,
then Q.” Just as with negation, conjunction, and disjunction, the conditional
statement is deﬁned by its truth table. From the discussion above, the ﬁrst
two rows of the standard truth table for P ⇒Q should be as follows.

The essential meaning of the conditional statement appears in the partial
truth table above. Earlier, we indicated that in English the word “or” has
two meanings—the meaning of the “inclusive or” and the meaning of the
“exclusive or.” Since we have two missing truth values in the truth table
for the conditional statement, there are four possible ways to complete the
truth table.
The question is: “For use in mathematical discussions, what
truth value assignments should we make in the last two rows of the truth
table?” Observe that when the hypothesis, P, is true, the truth value of the
conditional statement P ⇒Q is identical to the truth value of the conclu-
sion, Q. Also observe that when P is true, the truth value of the statement

20
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
(¬ P) ∨Q is identical to the truth value of Q. Hence, we deﬁne P ⇒Q
to be logically equivalent to (¬ P) ∨Q. That is, we take P ⇒Q to be an
abbreviation for (¬ P) ∨Q. Below, we have constructed the standard truth
table for (¬ P) ∨Q and we have attached at the right a column labeled
P ⇒Q. Since we have deﬁned the conditional statement P ⇒Q to be logi-
cally equivalent to the statement (¬ P) ∨Q, the column of truth values for
P ⇒Q is identical to the column of truth values for (¬ P) ∨Q.

Let P stand for the statement “3 = 4,” which is false, and let Q stand for
the statement “
√
2 is rational,” which is false. It is easier to see that the
conditional statement P ⇒Q, “If 3 = 4, then
√
2 is rational,” is true when
it is written in the logically equivalent form (¬ P) ∨Q, “Not 3 = 4 or
√
2
is rational.” In the form “Not 3 = 4 or
√
2 is rational” it is clear that “Not
3 = 4” is true and therefore the disjunction “Not 3 = 4 or
√
2 is rational” is
true.
We have deﬁned P ⇒Q to be logically equivalent to (¬ P) ∨Q, and we can
see from the truth table for the conditional statement that it may be deﬁned
as follows also.
Given two statements P and Q, the conditional statement P ⇒Q (read
“P implies Q”) is the statement “If P, then Q.” The conditional statement
P ⇒Q is true unless P is true and Q is false, in which case it is false.
Later, in constructing some proofs and counterexamples, we will need the
negation of the conditional statement. Since the columns of truth values for
P ⇒Q and (¬ P) ∨Q are identical, the columns of truth values for their
negations will be identical also. Hence,
1. ¬(P ⇒Q) ≡¬((¬P) ∨Q)
A logical equivalence
2. ¬((¬P) ∨Q) ≡(¬(¬P)) ∧(¬Q)
By a De Morgan law
3. ¬(P ⇒Q) ≡(¬(¬P)) ∧(¬Q)
By the rule of substitution
(Substituting 2 into 1)
4. ¬(¬P) ≡P
By the double negation law
5. ¬(P ⇒Q) ≡P ∧(¬Q)
By the rule of substitution
(Substituting 4 into 3)
Thus, we have proven the following logical equivalence for the negation of the
conditional statement.

There are many diﬀerent ways to express the conditional statement,
P ⇒Q, in words. The following is a nonexhaustive list.

Example 1.3.1 For each of the following conditional statements:
1. Identify the hypothesis and conclusion.
2. Determine the truth values of the hypothesis, the conclusion, and the
conditional statement.
3. Write the negation of the conditional statement.
a. If 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 3.
b. If 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 4.
c. The number
√
2 is rational, if 2 + 2 = 5.
d. The number
√
2 is irrational, if 2 + 2 = 5.
e. The moon is made of green cheese is necessary for the Golden Gate
Bridge to be in California.
f. The moon is made of green cheese is suﬃcient for the Golden Gate Bridge
to be in California.
Solution
a. The hypothesis is “1 + 1 = 2,” which is true, and the conclusion is
“1+2 = 3,” which is true. Since the hypothesis is true and the conclusion
is true, the conditional statement “If 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 3” is
true. The negation of a conditional statement is the conjunction of the
hypothesis and the negation of the conclusion. Thus, the negation of “If
1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 3” is “1 + 1 = 2 and not 1 + 2 = 3.”
b. The hypothesis is “1 + 1 = 2,” which is true, and the conclusion is
“1 + 2 = 4,” which is false. Since the hypothesis is true and the conclu-
sion is false, the conditional statement “If 1 + 1 = 2, then 1 + 2 = 4”
is false. The negation of the conditional statement “If 1 + 1 = 2, then
1 + 2 = 4” is “1 + 1 = 2 and not 1 + 2 = 4.”
c. The hypothesis is “2 + 2 = 5,” which is false, and the conclusion is “the
number
√
2 is rational,” which is false. Since the hypothesis is false, the
conditional statement “The number
√
2 is rational, if 2 + 2 = 5” is true.
The negation of this conditional statement is “2+2 = 5 and the number
√
2 is not rational.”
d. The hypothesis is “2 + 2 = 5,” which is false, and the conclusion is “the
number
√
2 is irrational,” which is true. Since the hypothesis is false,

22
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
the conditional statement “The number
√
2 is irrational, if 2 + 2 = 5” is
true. The negation of this conditional statement is “2 + 2 = 5 and the
number
√
2 is not irrational.”
e. The hypothesis is “The Golden Gate Bridge is in California,” which is
true, and the conclusion is “The moon is made of green cheese,” which
is false. Since the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the
conditional statement “The moon is made of green cheese is necessary
for the Golden Gate Bridge to be in California” is false. The negation of
this conditional statement is “The Golden Gate Bridge is in California
and the moon is not made of green cheese.”
f. The hypothesis is “The moon is made of green cheese,” which is false,
and the conclusion is “The Golden Gate Bridge is in California,” which
is true. Since the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement “The
moon is made of green cheese is suﬃcient for the Golden Gate Bridge
to be in California” is true. The negation of this conditional statement
is “The moon is made of green cheese and the Golden Gate Bridge is
not in California.”
■
Every conditional statement has associated with it three other statements:
the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive.
The converse of P ⇒Q is Q ⇒P.
The inverse of P ⇒Q is (¬ P) ⇒(¬ Q).
The contrapositive of P ⇒Q is (¬ Q) ⇒(¬ P).
Example 1.3.2
Write the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive of
the conditional statement “If we win the game, we will celebrate.”
Solution
The converse is “If we celebrate, we will win the game.”
The inverse is “If we do not win the game, we will not celebrate.”
The contrapositive is “If we do not celebrate, we will not win the game.”
■
We constructed the following truth table for the conditional statement,
P ⇒Q ; its converse, Q ⇒P ; its inverse, (¬ P) ⇒(¬ Q) ; and its contrapos-
itive, (¬ Q) ⇒(¬ P) .

Examining the columns of truth values, we ﬁnd that P ⇒Q is logically equiv-
alent to (¬ Q) ⇒(¬ P), since their columns of truth values are identical and
that Q ⇒P is logically equivalent to (¬ P) ⇒(¬ Q), since their columns
of truth values are identical. Comparing columns of truth values, we observe
that the converse of P ⇒Q, Q ⇒P, is not logically equivalent to the origi-
nal implication P ⇒Q. Furthermore, we observe that the inverse of P ⇒Q,
(¬ P) ⇒(¬ Q), is not logically equivalent to the original implication P ⇒Q.
Given two statements P and Q, the biconditional statement P ⇔Q is
the statement “P if and only if Q.” The biconditional statement P ⇔Q is
true when P and Q have the same truth values and false when P and Q have
diﬀerent truth values.
In mathematics, the phrase “if and only if” is often abbreviated by “iﬀ”
and sometimes “if and only if” is expressed in the alternate form “is necessary
and suﬃcient for.” The truth table for the biconditional statement appears
below.

at the right.
What can you conclude about (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) and
P ⇔Q?
Solution
We make column headings P, Q, P ⇒Q, Q ⇒P, (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P), and
(P ⇔Q). We ﬁll in the appropriate truth value columns for P and Q, and
then we determine and enter the remaining truth values by column from left
to right. Thus, we obtain the following standard truth table.

Since the truth value columns for (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) and P ⇔Q are
identical, (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) is logically equivalent to P ⇔Q—that is,
(P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) ≡P ⇔Q .

In algebra, we have an established hierarchy for operations. For an algebraic
expression with no parentheses, the operation of exponentiation is performed

24
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
ﬁrst and from left to right; next, the operations of multiplication and division
are performed from left to right; and ﬁnally, the operations of addition and
subtraction are performed from left to right.
Thus, it is understood that
x + y ∗z written without any additional parentheses means x + (y ∗z) and
not (x+y)∗z. The hierarchy for connectives in symbolic logic for expressions
with no parentheses is negation ¬ is performed ﬁrst, next conjunction ∧and
disjunction ∨are performed, and last the conditional ⇒and biconditional
⇔connectives are performed. Hence, by this convention ¬ P ⇒Q ∧R means
(¬ P) ⇒(Q ∧R). However, without parentheses the meaning of the expression
P ∧Q ∨R is ambiguous. Does it mean (P ∧Q) ∨R or P ∧(Q ∨R)? So
in this case, a set of parentheses is necessary to indicate which expression is
intended.

Logical Arguments
Proofs play a major role in mathematics, and deductive reasoning is the
foundation on which proofs rest. In mathematics, as in law, a logical argu-
ment is a claim that from certain premises (statements that are assumed to
be true) one can infer a certain conclusion (statement) is true. Logic is con-
cerned with the connections between statements and with what deductions
can be made, assuming that the premises are true. Let the symbol .·. stand
for the word “therefore.” The symbolic form of a logical argument written in
horizontal form is
P1 , . . ., Pn .·. C
and written in vertical form
P1
...
Pn
——
.·. C

26
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
where P1 , . . ., Pn are premises and C is the conclusion. In logic, we study
the methods and principles used in distinguishing valid (“correct”) arguments
from invalid (“incorrect”) arguments. Notice that statements are said to be
true or false, while arguments are said to be valid or invalid. We make the
following deﬁnitions regarding arguments.
An argument P1 , . . ., Pn .·. C with premises P1 , . . ., Pn and conclusion
C is valid if and only if P1 ∧P2 ∧. . . ∧Pn ⇒C is a tautology.
If an argument is not valid, it is called invalid.
Thus, an argument is valid if and only if, when the premises are all true, the
conclusion must be true. Stated another way, an argument is valid if and only
if it is not possible for the conclusion to be false unless at least one of the
premises is false. Validity concerns the relationship between the premises and
the conclusion, and not the truth values of the premises and conclusions.
Let us consider the argument
The sun is shining.
———————————————————–
Therefore, the sun is shining or it is raining.
Let P denote the premise “The sun is shining.” And let Q denote the state-
ment “It is raining.” Then this argument can be written symbolically as

is a valid argument. Thus, we have just proven the rule of disjunction.
Rule of Disjunction
The argument P
.·. P ∨Q is a valid argument
known as the rule of disjunction.

Now, let us consider the symbolic argument

is an invalid argument. In order to show that an argument is invalid, it is not
necessary to construct an entire truth table. It is suﬃcient to show how to
choose the truth values of the component statements in such a way that the
premises are true and the conclusion is false. Thus, to show that the argument
P .·. P ∧Q is invalid, we need to show only the ﬁrst three columns of row two
of the preceding truth table. That is,

known as the rule of conjunction.
Rule of Conjunctive Simpliﬁcation The argument P ∧Q .·. P is a valid
argument called the rule of conjunctive simpliﬁcation.
Rule of Disjunctive Syllogism The argument P ∨Q, ¬P .·. Q is a valid
argument called the rule of disjunctive syllogism.

When an argument contains three or more diﬀerent simple statements, it
becomes tedious to determine the validity of the argument by making a truth
table. A more convenient way to prove an argument is valid is to deduce its
conclusion from its premises by a sequence of elementary arguments which are
known to be valid. Hence, a formal proof of a given argument is a sequence
of statements such that each statement is either (1) a premise of the argument,
or (2) a statement which follows from preceding statements by an elementary
valid argument, or (3) a statement which is logically equivalent to a preceding
statement in the sequence, or (4) the last statement in the sequence—the
conclusion of the argument. The proper way to write a formal proof is to list
the premises and the sequence of statements deduced from them along with a
justiﬁcation for each statement. The justiﬁcation of each deduced statement
speciﬁes the preceding statement or statements from which it was deduced
and the rule of inference which was used. Thus far, we have proved by the use
of truth tables that four elementary arguments are valid—namely, the rule
of disjunction, the rule of conjunction, the rule of conjunctive simpliﬁcation,
and the rule of disjunctive syllogism.

The solution of Example 1.4.2 is a formal proof of the rule of contrapositive
inference, which is stated below.
Rule of Contrapositive Inference The argument P ⇒Q,
¬Q .·. ¬P is
a valid argument, which is known as the rule of contrapositive inference.
The rule of detachment and the rule of contrapositive inference are both
valid arguments which contain exactly two simple statements, one of which
is the conditional statement P ⇒Q. Two commonly used invalid arguments
which contain exactly two simple statements, one of which is the conditional
statement P ⇒Q, are the Fallacy of the Converse and the Fallacy of the
Inverse.
The argument P ⇒Q,
Q .·. P is an invalid argument called the fallacy
of the converse.
The argument P ⇒Q, ¬P .·. ¬Q is an invalid argument called the fallacy
of the inverse.
Recall that an argument is valid if and only if, when the premises are all
true, the conclusion must be true. Thus, in order to prove that the fallacy
of the converse is an invalid argument, all we need to do is determine truth
values for P and Q such that both premises P ⇒Q and Q have the truth value
T and the conclusion P has the truth value F. Assigning P the truth value F

30
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
and Q the truth value T achieves the required result. Likewise, to prove that
the fallacy of the inverse is an invalid argument, we need to determine truth
values for P and Q such that both premises P ⇒Q and ¬ P have the truth
value T and the conclusion ¬ Q has the truth value F. Again, assigning P the
truth value F and Q the truth value T achieves the required result.
In the following two examples, we determine the validity of two arguments.
Example 1.4.3 Write the following argument in symbolic form. Determine
if the argument is valid or invalid and state the name of the argument form.
I took a nap, or I watched television.
I did not watch television.
————————————————
Therefore, I took a nap.
Solution
Let N denote the statement “I took a nap.” And let T denote the statement
“I watched television.” Then the symbolic form of the argument is
N ∨T
¬ T

This argument has the form of the disjunctive syllogism and it is a valid
argument. ■
Example 1.4.4 Write the following argument in symbolic form. Determine
if the argument is valid or invalid and state the name of the argument form.
If I went out to eat dinner, then I ate dessert.
I ate dessert.

Therefore, I went out to eat dinner.
Solution
Let D denote the statement “I went out to eat dinner.” And let P denote
the statement “I ate dessert.” Then the symbolic form of the given argument
is

This argument has the form of the fallacy of the converse and it is an invalid

In the following example we show in more detail how to analyze an argument
and how to construct a formal proof.
Example 1.4.5 Write the following argument in symbolic form and construct
a formal proof of its validity.
If I study, I make good grades.
If I do not study, I have fun.
———————————————————–
Therefore, I make good grades or I have fun.
Solution
Let S denote the statement “I study.”
Let G denote the statement “I
make good grades.” And let F denote the statement “I have fun.” Then the
symbolic form of the given argument is
S ⇒G
(1)
(¬ S) ⇒F
————–
.·. G ∨F
Both premises are conditional statements. One contains S as a hypothesis
and the other contains ¬ S as a hypothesis.
Because a conditional state-
ment and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we could replace the ﬁrst
or second premise by its contrapositive. Since the conclusion contains the
statement F and since the second premise contains the statement F as a con-
clusion, we decided to replace the ﬁrst premise S ⇒G by its contrapositive

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
(¬ G) ⇒(¬S). From the true statements (¬ G) ⇒(¬ S) and (¬ S) ⇒F
we deduce by the rule of transitive inference (¬ G) ⇒F. From the deﬁnition
of the conditional statement, (¬ G) ⇒F is logically equivalent to the state-
ment (¬ (¬ G)) ∨F. Since (¬ (¬ G)) ≡G, we obtain the desired conclusion
G ∨F. Hence, we have developed the following formal proof that (1) is a valid
argument.

In addition to using symbolic logic to prove that an argument is valid,
symbolic logic may be used to deduce a valid consequence or consequences
from a collection of premises. When possible, one tries to use all of the given
premises to deduce a valid conclusion.
When it is not possible to use all
the premises to deduce a valid conclusion, then one generally uses as large a
subcollection of premises as possible to deduce a valid conclusion.
Example 1.4.6 Deduce a valid conclusion for the following argument.
Ursula went to the conference by train or by airplane.
If Ursula went to the conference by train or drove her own car,
then she arrived late and she missed the opening ceremony.
Ursula did not arrive late.
———————————————————————————–
Therefore,
Solution
Let T denote the statement “Ursula went to the conference by train.” Let
A denote the statement “Ursula went to the conference by airplane.” Let C
denote the statement “Ursula drove her own car.” Let L denote the statement
“Ursula arrived late.” And let M denote the statement “Ursula missed the
opening ceremony.” Then the symbolic form of the given argument is
T ∨A
(T ∨C) ⇒(L ∧M)
¬ L
————————–
.·.

Logic
33
The third premise ¬ L is true by assumption.
Hence, L is false and
L ∧M is false. Consequently, ¬ (L ∧M) is true.
From ¬ (L ∧M) and
the second premise, (T ∨C) ⇒(L ∧M), it follows using the rule of con-
trapositive inference that ¬ (T ∨C). Then by a De Morgan law, we have
(¬ T) ∧(¬ C) and by the rule of conjunctive simpliﬁcation, we get (¬ T).
From (¬ T) and the ﬁrst premise, T ∨A, we conclude A using the rule of
disjunctive syllogism. Hence, “Ursula went to the conference by airplane” is
a valid conclusion, which we deduced using all of the given premises.
■
Example 1.4.7 Deduce a valid conclusion for the following argument.
If Rob studies medicine, Rob prepares to earn a good living.
If Rob studies humanities, Rob prepares to live the good life.
If Rob prepares to earn a good living or Rob prepares to live a
good life, then Rob’s years at the university are well spent.
Rob’s years at the university are not well spent.
————————————————————————————-
Therefore,
Solution
Let M denote the statement “Rob studies medicine.” Let E denote the
statement “Rob prepares to earn a good living.” Let H denote the statement
“Rob studies humanities.” Let L denote the statement “Rob prepares to live
a good life.” And let U denote the statement “Rob’s years at the university
are well spent.” Then the symbolic form of the given argument is
M ⇒E
H ⇒L
(E ∨L) ⇒U
¬ U
————————–
.·.
Applying the rule of contrapositive inference to the third and fourth premises,
we infer ¬ (E ∨L), which is logically equivalent to (¬ E) ∧(¬ L). Using the
rule of conjunctive simpliﬁcation twice yields ¬ E and ¬ L. From the ﬁrst
premise, M ⇒E and ¬ E, we conclude by the rule of contrapositive inference
that ¬ M. Likewise, from ¬ L and the second premise H ⇒L we conclude
¬ H by the rule of contrapositive inference. Hence, two valid conclusions we
can deduce are ¬ M (“Rob does not study medicine”) and ¬ H (“Rob does
not study humanities”).

34
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
It should be noted that we can deduce three valid conclusions from the ﬁrst
two premises alone—namely, (M ∨H) ⇒(E ∨L), (M ∧H) ⇒(E ∧L), and
(M ∧H) ⇒(E ∨L). However, in doing so, we have not made use of the
remaining two premises.

1.5
Open Statements and Quantiﬁers
Chapter 3 is devoted to the study of sets; however, at this point we need to
introduce some very basic concepts related to sets and some notation used in
conjunction with sets. The German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845–1918)
initiated the theory of sets in the 1870s and 1880s. According to Cantor,
“A set is any collection of deﬁnite, distinguishable objects of our
intuition or our intellect to be conceived as a whole.”
The objects of a set are called the elements or members of the set. Every
day we use words which convey the meaning of a set. For example, when
we say “The committee recommended a course in logic be required for grad-
uation,” we are considering the committee to be a set and the members of

Logic
39
the committee are the members (elements) of the set. When we mention a
“ﬂock” of geese, we are considering a particular set of geese as a single entity,
and any individual goose in that ﬂock is a member of that set. Thus, the
essential point of Cantor’s concept of a set is that the collection of objects is
to be regarded as a single entity. The word “deﬁnite” in Cantor’s concept of
a set means given a set and an object, it is possible to determine whether the
object belongs to the set or not. And the word “distinguishable” means given
any two pair of objects qualiﬁed to appear as elements of a set, one must be
able to determine whether the objects are the same or diﬀerent. As a result,
a set is completely determined by its members.
Generally, we will denote sets by capital letters and will use the conventional
notation “x ∈A” to denote that “x is an element of the set A” or “x is a
member of the set A.” Also, we will use the notation “x, y ∈A” to indicate
“x and y are elements of the set A.” The Italian mathematician Giuseppe
Peano (1858–1932) introduced the symbol ∈for “is an element of” in 1889.
The symbol comes from the ﬁrst letter of the Greek word for “is.” In order to
indicate that “x is not an element of the set A”, we will write “x /∈A.” For
example, let A denote the set of letters in the English alphabet. Then b ∈A;
e, f ∈A; a, e, i, o, u ∈A; but 5 /∈A.
Sets are usually described by one of two notations—roster notation (also
called enumeration notation) or set-builder notation. In roster nota-
tion, the elements of the set are enclosed in braces, { }, and separated by
commas. The order in which the elements are listed within the braces is im-
material. For example, the set of one digit prime numbers may be written
using roster notation as {2, 3, 5, 7}, or {5, 7, 2, 3}, or {7, 3, 5, 2}, etc. These are
just diﬀerent representations of the same set. Of course, roster notation is ap-
propriate for ﬁnite sets. However, this notation can also be used to represent
inﬁnite sets. For instance, we may represent the set of positive integers, P, by
P = {1, 2, 3, . ..}. When representing sets in this manner the dots . . . (called
ellipsis) indicate that the pattern used to obtain the elements listed previously
is to be followed to obtain the remaining elements of the set. This convention
may be used to represent ﬁnite sets which have a relatively large number of
elements as well. For example, F = {2, 4, 6, . .., 100} is a representation of
the set of all positive even integers less than or equal to 100.
Throughout the text, we will let N denote the set of natural numbers,
which are also sometimes called the counting numbers or the positive
integers. Thus, N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}. The set of integers will be represented
by Z, so Z = {. . ., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,. ..}. The symbol Z comes from the German
word for number, Z¨ahlen. The basic theorems for the natural numbers and
integers appear in Section 2.1 and may be used in proofs which involve natural
numbers or integers. We will use Q to denote the set of rational numbers.
Recall that a rational number is any number of the form p/q where p and q
are integers and q ̸= 0. The set of real numbers will be denoted by R.

40
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Using set-builder notation, the set F of all even integers less than or equal
to 100 would be written as
F = {x | x is an even integer less than or equal to 100}.
The vertical bar, | , in the deﬁnition above is read “such that.” Hence, the
set-builder deﬁnition of the set F given above is read “F equals the set of all
x such that x is an even integer less than or equal to 100.” Another example
of a set speciﬁed using set-builder notation is
O = {x | x is an odd integer}
Observe that set-builder notation is very appropriate for representing both
inﬁnite sets and ﬁnite sets with a relatively large number of elements.
The set with no elements is called the empty set or null set. The empty set
is symbolized by ∅. The symbol ∅is the last letter of the Danish–Norwegian
alphabet. The empty set is not denoted by { }. The empty set is
not the set {0}. The set {0} is a set with one element, namely, 0. Hence,
0 ∈{0}. And the empty set is not the set {∅}. The set {∅} is a set with
one element, namely, ∅. That is, ∅∈{∅}.
Many sentences in mathematics involve one or more variables, and therefore
are not statements.
A variable is a symbol, say x, which represents an
unspeciﬁed object from a given set U.
The set of values, U, that can be
assigned to the variable x is called the universe, universal set, or universe
of discourse.
An open statement in one variable is a sentence that involves one
variable and that becomes a statement (a declarative sentence that is true or
false) when values from the universal set are substituted for the variable. An
open statement in the variable x is denoted by P(x).
It should be noted that an open statement in one variable is not a statement,
because the sentence is not true or false until a speciﬁc value from the universal
set is substituted into the sentence, making it a statement—that is, making
it true or false. Thus, the truth value of an open statement remains “open”
until a speciﬁc value for the variable is substituted into the statement. Let
P(x) denote the open statement “The natural number x is a prime number.”
Observe that P(x) is neither true nor false; the statement P(5) is true, while
the statement P(4) is false.
The truth set of an open statement is the set of all values from the
universal set that make the open statement a true statement.
Let P(x) be an open statement with the speciﬁed nonempty universal set
U. Then in set-builder notation, the truth set of P(x) is the set
TP = {x ∈U | P(x)}.
The following example illustrates that the truth set of an open statement
depends on the choice of the universal set. Let P(x) be the open statement
“x2 ≤9.”
Then
{x ∈N | x2 ≤9} = {1, 2, 3}, {x ∈Z | x2 ≤9} =
{−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,3}, and {x ∈R | x2 ≤9} = {x ∈R | −3 ≤x ≤3}.

Logic
41
Example 1.5.1 Find the following truth sets.
a. {x ∈N | 2x2 −x = 0}
b. {x ∈Z | 2x2 −x = 0}
c. {x ∈Q | 2x2 −x = 0}
Solution
Factoring the equation 2x2 −x = 0 which appears in a, b, and c, we ﬁnd
x(2x −1) = 0. Recall from algebra that in the set of real numbers, if ab = 0,
then either a = 0 or b = 0. Since x(2x −1) = 0, it follows that x = 0 or
2x −1 = 0. Solving the last equation, we ﬁnd x = 1/2. Thus, the two real
roots of the equation 2x2 −x = 0 are x = 0 and x = 1/2. Therefore, the
required truth sets are as follows:
a. {x ∈N | 2x2 −x = 0} = ∅
b. {x ∈Z | 2x2 −x = 0} = {0}
c. {x ∈Q | 2x2 −x = 0} = {0, 1
2}
■
Often we want to indicate how many values of the variable x make the open
statement P(x) true. Speciﬁcally, we would like to know if P(x) is true for
every x in the universe U or if P(x) is true for at least one x ∈U. Thus, we
introduce two quantiﬁers.
The symbol ∀is called the universal quantiﬁer and represents the phrase
“for all,” “for each,” or “for every.” The statement (∀x ∈U)(P(x)) is read
“for all x ∈U, P(x)” and is true precisely when the truth set
TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} = U.
The symbol ∃is called the existential quantiﬁer and represents the phrase
“there exists,” “there is,” or “for some.” The statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is
read “there exists an x ∈U such that P(x)” and is true precisely when the
truth set
TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} ̸= ∅.
Several comments are in order. First of all, to prove that the statement
(∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is true, it is necessary to ﬁnd only a single value of x ∈U
for which P(x) is true.
On the other hand, to prove that the statement
(∀x ∈U)(P(x)) is true, it is necessary to prove that P(x) is true for all
x ∈U. Second, the conditional statement
(∀x ∈U)(P(x)) ⇒(∃x ∈U)(P(x))
is true, since an open statement which is true for all values of x in a universe
U is true for some (any) value of x ∈U. On the contrary, the conditional
statement
(∃x ∈U)(P(x)) ⇒(∀x ∈U)(P(x))
is false, since an open statement can be true for some x in a universe and
false for other x in the universe. And ﬁnally, the truth value of a quantiﬁed
statement depends on the universe, as the following examples show. Let P(x)
denote the statement “x2 > 0.” The quantiﬁed statement (∀x ∈N)(P(x))

42
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
is true, while the quantiﬁed statement (∀x ∈Z)(P(x)) is false, because
P(0) is false. Now let Q(x) represent the statement “x ≤0.” The quan-
tiﬁed statement (∃x ∈N)(Q(x)) is false, while the quantiﬁed statement
(∃x ∈Z)(Q(x)) is true, because Q(0) is true.
Example 1.5.2
Translate the following English sentences into symbolic
statements containing one quantiﬁer. Indicate the truth value of each state-
ment.
a. For every natural number x, 2x + 1 > 0.
b. For every integer x, 2x + 1 > 0.
c. There exists an integer x such that 2x + 1 < 0.
d. There exists a natural number x such that x2+x+41 is a prime number.
e. For every natural number x, x2 + x + 41 is a prime number.
Solution
The corresponding symbolic statements are as follows.
a. (∀x ∈N)(2x + 1 > 0). This statement is true, since for x ∈N, x > 0;
therefore, 2x > 0 and 2x + 1 > 1 > 0.
b. (∀x ∈Z)(2x + 1 > 0). This statement is false, since −1 ∈Z and
2(−1) + 1 = −2 + 1 = −1 < 0.
c. (∃x ∈Z)(2x+1 < 0). This statement is true, since it is true for x = −1.
See the computation in part b. In fact, this statement is true for all
integers x ≤−1.
d. (∃x ∈N)(x2 + x + 41 is a prime number) This statement is true, since
for x = 1, 12 + 1 + 41 = 43, which is a prime number.
e. (∀x ∈N)(x2 + x + 41 is a prime number) This statement is false. Can
you ﬁnd one speciﬁc natural number x such that x2 + x + 41 is not a
prime number?
■
The symbolic statement (∀x ∈A)(P(x)), which is read “For all x ∈A, P(x)”
can also be stated as “For all x, if x ∈A, then P(x)” and symbolized by
(∀x)((x ∈A) ⇒P(x)). Likewise, the symbolic statement (∃x ∈A)(P(x)) can
be written as (∃x)((x ∈A) ⇒P(x)), which is read “There exists an x such
that if x ∈A, then P(x).” The following example illustrates these usages.
Example 1.5.3 In this example, let the universe of discourse be the set of
integers, Z. Translate the following symbolic statements which involve one
quantiﬁer into English and indicate the truth value of each statement.
a. (∀x)((x ∈N) ⇒(x ∈Z))
b. (∀x)((x ∈Z) ⇒(x ∈N))
c. (∃x)((x ∈Z) ∧(x ∈N))
d. (∃x)((x ∈Z) ∧(x /∈N))

Logic
43
e. (∃x)((x ∈N) ∧(x /∈Z))
f.
(∀x)((x is a prime) ⇒(x is not a composite))
Solution
a. (∀x)((x ∈N) ⇒(x ∈Z)) translates into English as “For all x, if x is a
natural number, then x is an integer.” This translation can be shortened
to “Every natural number is an integer.” The symbolic statement and
the equivalent English translations are true.
b. (∀x)((x ∈Z) ⇒(x ∈N)) translates as “For all x, if x is an integer, then
x is a natural number.” This translation can be shortened to “Every
integer is a natural number.” This statement is false, because x = −1
makes the statement x ∈Z true and the statement x ∈N false. Hence,
for x = −1, the conditional statement (x ∈Z) ⇒(x ∈N) is false.
c. (∃x)((x ∈Z)∧(x ∈N)) means “There is a number x which is an integer
and a natural number.” This symbolic statement and its translation are
true, since 1 is both an integer and a natural number.
d. (∃x)((x ∈Z) ∧(x /∈N)) translates into English as “For some x, x is
an integer and x is not a natural number.” A condensed translation is
“Some integer is not a natural number.” This symbolic statement and
its translations are all true, since x = −1 is an integer which is not a
natural number.
e. (∃x)((x ∈N)) ∧(x /∈Z)) translates as “For some x, x is a natural
number and x is not an integer.”
A shortened translation is “Some
natural number is not an integer.”
This symbolic statement and its
translations are all false.
f.
(∀x)((x is a prime) ⇒(x is not a composite)) translates as “For all x, if
x is a prime, then x is not a composite.” A shortened translation is “No
prime is a composite.” This symbolic statement and its translations are
all true.

Traditional logic emphasized four basic types of statements involving a sin-
gle quantiﬁer: the universal aﬃrmative, the universal denial, the particular
aﬃrmative, and the particular denial. Examples of these four types of state-
ments appear in Example 1.5.3. We now provide a general summary for these
types of statements. Let a universe for the variable x be speciﬁed and let
P(x) and Q(x) be appropriate statements. Then the symbolic statement and
English translation of the four statements of traditional logic are as follows.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Statement Type
Symbolic Statement
English Sentence
1. Universal Aﬃrmative
(∀x)(P(x) ⇒Q(x))
All P(x) are Q(x).
2. Universal Denial
(∀x)(P(x) ⇒(¬Q(x)))
No P(x) are Q(x).
3. Particular Aﬃrmative
(∃x)(P(x) ∧Q(x))
Some P(x) are Q(x).
4. Particular Denial
(∃x)(P(x) ∧(¬Q(x)))
Some P(x) are not Q(x).
If the statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is true, then we know that there is at
least one x in the universe U such that P(x) is true. However, in mathemat-
ics, it is often the case that there exists exactly one x in the universe for
which P(x) is true. For example, for the set of integers there exists exactly
one additive identity—namely, the number 0. (That is, the number 0 is the
unique number in Z such that x + 0 = 0 + x = x for all x ∈Z.) For the set of
natural numbers there exists exactly one multiplicative identity—namely, the
number 1. (The number 1 is the unique number in N such that x·1 = 1·x = x
for all x ∈N.)
To indicate that there exists a unique element in a universe with a spe-
ciﬁc property, we deﬁne the unique existential quantiﬁer, ∃!, as follows. The
symbol ∃! is called the unique existential quantiﬁer and represents the
phrase “there exists a unique,” or “there exists exactly one.” The statement
(∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) is read “there exists a unique x ∈U such that P(x)” or “there
exists exactly one x ∈U such that P(x).” The statement (∃!x ∈U)(P(x))
is true precisely when the truth set TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} has exactly one
element.
It follows directly from the deﬁnitions of the quantiﬁers ∃and ∃! that the
conditional statement (∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) ⇒(∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is true, while the
conditional statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)) ⇒(∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) is false.
Example 1.5.4
Find the truth value of the following statements which
contain the unique existential quantiﬁer.
a. (∃!x ∈N)(|x + 4| = 1)
b. (∃!x ∈N)(|x −4| = 5)
c. (∃!x ∈N)(|x −4| = 3)
Solution
Notice that an equation of the form |y| = a where a is positive appears in
a, b, and c. Recall from algebra that in the set of real numbers, if |y| = a
where a is positive, then either y = a or y = −a.
a. It follows from the discussion above, that if |x + 4| = 1, then either
x + 4 = 1 or x + 4 = −1. Adding −4 to both of the last two equations,
we ﬁnd if |x + 4| = 1, then either x = −3 or x = −5. Since −3 /∈N
and −5 /∈N, the statement (∃!x ∈N)(|x + 4| = 1) is false, because the
truth set of {x ∈N | |x + 4| = 1} is the empty set, which contains no
element.

Logic
45
b. If |x −4| = 5, then either x −4 = 5 or x −4 = −5. Adding 4 to both
of the last two equations, we ﬁnd if |x −4| = 5, then either x = 9 or
x = −1. Since 9 ∈N and −1 /∈N, the statement (∃!x ∈N)(|x+4| = 1)
is true, because the truth set of {x ∈N | |x −4| = 5} = {9}, which
contains exactly one element.
c.
If |x −4| = 3, then either x −4 = 3 or x −4 = −3. Adding 4 to both of
the last two equations, we ﬁnd if |x−4| = 3, then either x = 7 or x = 1.
Since 7 ∈N and 1 ∈N, the statement (∃!x ∈N)(|x + 4| = 1) is false,
because the truth set of {x ∈N | |x −4| = 3} = {7, 1}, which contains
two elements.
Observe that if the universal set in a, b, and c were changed from the set of
natural numbers, N, to the set of integers, Z, the set of rational numbers, Q,
or the set of real numbers, R, then all three statements a, b, and c containing
the unique existential quantiﬁer would be false, since each corresponding truth
set would contain exactly two elements.
■
Example 1.5.4 illustrates that the statement (∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) can be proven
to be false by showing that the truth set of {x ∈U | P(x)} is either the
empty set or a set with two or more elements. In order to prove that the
statement (∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) is true, it is necessary to show that the truth set
of {x ∈U | P(x)} contains exactly one element.
In mathematics, it is very important to be able to negate quantiﬁed state-
ments such as deﬁnitions and theorems. However, before we can negate quan-
tiﬁed statements it is necessary to deﬁne equivalence for two quantiﬁed state-
ments.
Let P(x) and Q(x) be two quantiﬁed statements with nonempty universe
U.
Two statements P(x) and Q(x) are equivalent in the universe U
if and only if P(x) and Q(x) have the same truth value for all x ∈U.
That is, P(x) and Q(x) are equivalent in the universe U if and only if
(∀x ∈U)(P(x) ⇔Q(x)). The two quantiﬁed statements P(x) and Q(x) are
equivalent if and only if they are equivalent in every universe U.
Let A(x) denote the statement “x2 = x” and let B(x) denote the statement
“x = 1.” The quantiﬁed statement (∀x)(A(x)) is equivalent to the quantiﬁed
statement (∀x)(B(x)) in the universe of natural numbers, N, since in N
{x | x2 = x} = {1} = {x | x = 1}.
However, the quantiﬁed statement (∀x)(A(x)) is not equivalent to the quan-
tiﬁed statement (∀x)(B(x)) in the universe of integers, Z, since in Z
{x | x2 = x} = {0, 1} ̸= {1} = {x | x = 1}.
Consequently, the quantiﬁed statements (∀x)(A(x)) and (∀x)(B(x)) are not
equivalent.

46
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Let P(x) and Q(x) be open sentences in x with nonempty universe U. Since
the conditional statement P ⇒Q is logically equivalent to ¬ P ∨Q for any
nonempty universe U
(∀x ∈U)((P(x) ⇒Q(x)) ⇔(¬P(x) ∨Q(x))).
Hence, the quantiﬁed statements (∀x)((P(x) ⇒Q(x)) and (∀x)(¬P(x)∨Q(x))
are equivalent. Other important equivalent statements are
1. (∀x)((P(x) ∧Q(x)) and (∀x)(Q(x) ∧P(x))
2. (∀x)((P(x) ∨Q(x)) and (∀x)(Q(x) ∨P(x))
3. (∀x)((P(x) ⇒Q(x)) and (∀x)(¬Q(x) ⇒¬P(x))
4. (∀x)(¬(P(x) ∨Q(x))) and (∀x)((¬P(x)) ∧(¬Q(x)))
5. (∀x)(¬(P(x) ∧Q(x))) and (∀x)((¬P(x)) ∨(¬Q(x)))
Additional equivalent pairs of quantiﬁed statements may be obtained by re-
placing each occurrence of ∀in the above statements by ∃.
Now we consider the negation of the quantiﬁed statement (∀x)(P(x)). Let
a nonempty universe U be given. The negation of (∀x)(P(x)) is
¬(∀x)(P(x)) is true ⇔(∀x)(P(x)) is false
⇔{x ∈U | P(x)} ̸= U
⇔{x ∈U | ¬P(x)} ̸= ∅
⇔(∃x)(¬P(x))
Thus, ¬(∀x)(P(x)) is equivalent to (∃x)(¬P(x)). In a like manner, it can be
shown that ¬(∃x)(P(x)) is equivalent to (∀x)(¬P(x)). Consequently, we have
the following theorem regarding the negation of quantiﬁed statements.
Theorem Let P(x) be an open statement in the variable x. Then ¬(∀x)(P(x))
is equivalent to (∃x)(¬P(x)) and ¬(∃x)(P(x)) is equivalent to (∀x)(¬P(x)).
Henceforth, we will use the symbol ≡to denote the phrase “is equivalent
to.” Thus, the conclusion of the last theorem may be written as
¬(∀x)(P(x)) ≡(∃x)(¬P(x))
and
¬(∃x)(P(x)) ≡(∀x)(¬P(x)).

Logic
47
Example 1.5.5 Negate the universal aﬃrmative statement
(∀x)(P(x) ⇒Q(x))
and translate the negation into English.
Solution
The negation of the universal aﬃrmative statement is
¬(∀x)(P(x) ⇒Q(x)) ≡¬(∀x)((¬P(x)) ∨Q(x))
Deﬁnition of Conditional Statement
≡(∃x)¬((¬P(x)) ∨Q(x))
Negation of Quantiﬁed Statement Theorem
≡(∃x)(¬(¬P(x)) ∧(¬Q(x)))
De Morgan’s Law
≡(∃x)(P(x) ∧(¬Q(x)))
Double Negation
The statement (∃x)(P(x) ∧(¬Q(x))) is the particular denial statement and
its English translation is “Some P(x) are not Q(x).”
Thus, the negation
of the universal aﬃrmative statement is the particular denial statement and
by double negation, the negation of the particular denial statement is the
universal aﬃrmative statement.
As one might anticipate, the negation of
the universal denial statement is the particular aﬃrmative statement and
the negation of the particular aﬃrmative statement is the universal denial
statement.
■
Thus far, we have discussed only quantiﬁed statements in one variable.
Sentences in mathematics often contain quantiﬁed statements in two or more
variables. Moreover, the variables may not appear explicitly in the sentence,
and, initially, it may not be apparent exactly how many variables the sentence
actually contains. To make matters even more challenging, phrases such as
“for all,” “for each,” “for every,” “there exists,” “there is,” or “for some”
may not appear in the sentence either. Thus, it is often diﬃcult to translate
English sentences regarding mathematics into symbolic statements. On the
other hand, it is usually fairly easy to translate quantiﬁed symbolic statements
from mathematics into English.
First, let us consider the sentence, “For every real number there is a natural
number greater than the real number.” This sentence contains the quantiﬁers
“for every” and “there is” and the key words “real number” and “natural
number.”
Thus, we are reasonably certain there are two variables in this
sentence.
Let us use r for the variable denoting a real number and n for
the variable denoting a natural number. Then the translation of the given
sentence into a symbolic statement in mathematics is
(∀r ∈R)(∃n ∈N)(n > r).

48
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The negation of the previous statement is
¬((∀r ∈R)(∃n ∈N)(n > r)) ≡(∃r ∈R)(¬((∃n ∈N)(n > r)))
≡(∃r ∈R)(∀n ∈N)(¬(n > r))
≡(∃r ∈R)(∀n ∈N)(n ≤r)
Translating the last quantiﬁed statement into English, we ﬁnd that the nega-
tion of the sentence “For every real number there is a natural number greater
than the real number” is the sentence “There exists a real number such that
all natural numbers are less than or equal to the real number.” Clearly, the
negation of the original sentence is false, since it says that the natural num-
bers are bounded above by some real number.
Consequently, the original
statement is true.
The following examples illustrate that the order of the quantiﬁers in a state-
ment is very important. Let us consider the following ﬁve symbolic statements
with the universe of discourse being the integers, Z.
1. (∀x)(∀y)(x + y = 0)
2. (∀y)(∀x)(x + y = 0)
3. (∀x)(∃y)(x + y = 0)
4. (∃y)(∀x)(x + y = 0)
5. (∃x)(∃y)(x + y = 0)
The ﬁrst statement (∀x)(∀y)(x + y = 0) says “For all integers x and for all
integers y, x + y = 0. This statement is false, since x = 2 ∈Z and y = 3 ∈Z,
but x + y = 2 + 3 = 5 ̸= 0. The second statement has the same meaning as
the ﬁrst. It says “For all integers y and for all integers x, x + y = 0,” and it
is false. Thus, we note that (∀x)(∀y)(x + y = 0) ≡(∀y)(∀x)(x + y = 0). The
third statement (∀x)(∃y)(x + y = 0) says “For every integer x there exists
an integer y such that x + y = 0” or “Every integer has an additive inverse.”
Given an integer x, the integer y = −x satisﬁes the equation x + y = 0.
Thus, the third statement is true. Notice that in the fourth statement the
order of the quantiﬁers is reversed from the order in which they appear in the
third statement. The fourth statement says “There exists an integer y such
that for all integers x, x + y = 0.” This statement is false, since for x = 2,
y must be −2 in order to satisfy x + y = 0, while for x = 3, y must be −3 in
order to satisfy x + y = 0 and, of course, −2 ̸= −3. Since the third statement
is true and the fourth statement is false, we see that (∀x)(∃y)(x + y = 0)
is not equivalent to (∃y)(∀x)(x + y = 0). The ﬁfth statement says “There
exists an integer x and there exists an integer y such that x + y = 0.” We
can easily verify that this statement is true by choosing x = 2 and y = −2.
If we reverse the quantiﬁers appearing in the ﬁfth statement, we obtain the
statement (∃y)(∃x)(x + y = 0), which is equivalent to the ﬁfth statement.

Logic
49
The examples presented above illustrate the following facts, which we state
without proof. Let x and y be distinct variables and let P(x, y) be an open
statement in x and y. Then
(∀x)(∀y)P(x, y) ≡(∀y)(∀x)P(x, y)
(∃x)(∃y)P(x, y) ≡(∃y)(∃x)P(x, y)
and
(∃x)(∀y)P(x, y) ⇒(∀y)(∃x)P(x, y)
Example 1.5.6
Translate the sentence “Any nonzero real number has a
multiplicative inverse” into a quantiﬁed symbolic statement.
Solution
An initial translation is (∀x ∈R)((x ̸= 0) ⇒(x has a multiplicative in-
verse)). At ﬁrst glance, it appears that the quantiﬁed statement contains only
one variable, namely, x. However, by deﬁnition, a real number y is a mul-
tiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number x if and only if xy = 1. Using
this deﬁnition, our translation into a quantiﬁed symbolic statement in two
variables becomes
(∀x ∈R)((x ̸= 0) ⇒((∃y ∈R)(xy = 1))). ■

Deﬁnitions
A statement or proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true
or false, but not both true and false.
A simple statement (simple proposition) is a statement which does
not contain any other statement as a component part.
Every compound statement (compound proposition) is a statement
that does contain another statement as a component part.
Let P denote a statement.
The negation of P, denoted by ¬ P, is the
statement “not P.” The negation of P is false when P is true, and the negation
of P is true when P is false.
The conjunction of two statements P, Q, denoted by P ∧Q, is the state-
ment “P and Q.” The conjunction of P and Q is true if and only if both P
and Q are true.

52
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The disjunction of two statements P, Q, denoted by P ∨Q, is the state-
ment “P or Q.” The disjunction of P and Q is true if P is true, if Q is true,
or if both P and Q are true.
The truth value of a statement is true (denoted by T) if the statement is
true and false (denoted by F) if the statement is false.
A truth table is a table which shows the truth values of a statement for
all possible combinations of truth values of its simple statement components.
A tautology is a statement that is true for every assignment of truth values
of its component statements.
A contradiction is a statement that is false for every assignment of truth
values of its component statements. Thus, a contradiction is the negation of
a tautology.
Two statements are truth value equivalent or logically equivalent if
and only if they have the same truth values for all assignments of truth values
to their component statements.
The statement “If P, then Q” is called a conditional statement, the state-
ment P is called the hypothesis or antecedent of the conditional statement,
and the statement Q is called the conclusion or consequent of the condi-
tional statement.
Given two statements P and Q, the conditional statement P ⇒Q (read
“P implies Q”) is the statement “If P, then Q.” The conditional statement
P ⇒Q is true unless P is true and Q is false, in which case it is false.
Alternative expressions for the conditional statement P ⇒Q are
If P, then Q
Q, if P
P implies Q
Q is implied by P
P only if Q
Q provided P
P is suﬃcient for Q
Q is necessary for P
The converse of P ⇒Q is Q ⇒P.
The inverse of P ⇒Q is (¬ P) ⇒(¬ Q).
The contrapositive of P ⇒Q is (¬ Q) ⇒(¬ P).
Given two statements P and Q, the biconditional statement P ⇔Q is
the statement “P if and only if Q.” The biconditional statement P ⇔Q is
true when P and Q have the same truth values and false when P and Q have
diﬀerent truth values.
An argument P1 , . . ., Pn .·. C with premises P1 , . . ., Pn and conclusion
C is valid if and only if P1 ∧P2 ∧. . . ∧Pn ⇒C is a tautology.
If an argument is not valid, it is called invalid.
Sets are usually described by one of two notations—roster notation (also
called enumeration notation) or set-builder notation. In roster notation,
the elements of the set are enclosed in braces, { }, and separated by commas.

Logic
53
The set with no elements is called the empty set or null set.
A variable is a symbol, say x, which represents an unspeciﬁed object from
a given set U.
The set of values, U, that can be assigned to the variable x is called the
universe, universal set, or universe of discourse.
An open statement in one variable is a sentence that involves one
variable and that becomes a statement (a declarative sentence that is true or
false) when values from the universal set are substituted for the variable. An
open statement in the variable x is denoted by P(x).
The truth set of an open statement is the set of all values from the
universal set that make the open statement a true statement.
The symbol ∀is called the universal quantiﬁer and represents the phrase
“for all,” “for each,” or “for every.” The statement (∀x ∈U)(P(x)) is read “for
all x ∈U, P(x)” and is true when the truth set TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} = U.
The symbol ∃is called the existential quantiﬁer and represents the phrase
“there exists,” “there is,” or “for some.” The statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is
read “there exists an x ∈U such that P(x)” and is true when the truth set
TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} ̸= ∅.
The symbol ∃! is called the unique existential quantiﬁer and repre-
sents the phrase “there exists a unique” or “there exists exactly one.” The
statement (∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) is read “there exists a unique x ∈U such that
P(x)” or “there exists exactly one x ∈U such that P(x).” The statement
(∃!x ∈U)(P(x)) is true precisely when the truth set TP = {x ∈U | P(x)} has
exactly one element.
Two statements P(x) and Q(x) are equivalent in the universe U if P(x)
and Q(x) have the same truth value for all x ∈U. That is, P(x) and Q(x)
are equivalent in the universe U if (∀x ∈U)(P(x) ⇔Q(x)).
The two quantiﬁed statements P(x) and Q(x) are equivalent if they are
equivalent in every universe U.

In the previous exercise, you were asked to write the binary operator ∨in
terms of the unary operator ¬ and the binary operator ∧. In 1880, Charles
Peirce (1839–1914) proved that Boolean algebra can be deﬁned using a single
binary operator called nor. The operator nor is symbolized by P ↓Q and
means “neither P nor Q.” However, Peirce’s results were not published until
1933, nineteen years after his death.
In 1913, Henry Sheﬀer (1882–1964)
independently discovered and published results similar to the results of Peirce.

Chapter 2
Deductive Mathematical Systems
and Proofs
This chapter is devoted to the study of deductive mathematical systems
and elementary proof techniques. In Section 2.1, we deﬁne deductive mathe-
matical systems and discuss the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, the
system of natural numbers, and the system of integers. In Section 2.2, basic
techniques for proving conditional statements such as direct proof, proof by
contraposition, proof by contradiction, and proof by cases are presented. We
also discuss proving biconditional statements, proving a statement by contra-
diction, and proving statements which contain quantiﬁers. Next, we present
some well-known mathematical conjectures and show how to prove and dis-
prove conjectures. And ﬁnally, we deﬁne and examine the system of rational
numbers and the system of real numbers.
2.1
Deductive Mathematical Systems
A deductive mathematical system (an axiomatic theory) consists of the
following six elements:
1. An underlying language—English, in our case.
2. A deductive logic system—which we introduced in Chapter 1.
3. A list of undeﬁned terms.
4. A list of formally deﬁned technical terms, called deﬁnitions.
5. A list of statements which are assumed to be true, called postulates or
axioms.
6. A list of deduced statements, called theorems.
If, on one of the ﬁrst days of class, we were to ask beginning geometry stu-
dents the deﬁnition of a “point,” we would receive several responses. Among
those responses we would most likely ﬁnd: “A point is the intersection of
two lines.” If a little later in the class, we ask the same students to deﬁne
a “line,” we would probably receive one or both of these responses: “A line
is the shortest distance between two points.” “A line is determined by two
61

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
points.” That is, beginning geometry students would want to deﬁne a “point”
in terms of “lines” and to deﬁne a “line” in terms of “points.” The students
would be guilty of providing circular deﬁnitions. However, they have no choice
but to do so, if they believe all terms should be deﬁned. Suppose we have an
English dictionary which includes every word in the English language. And
suppose we start by looking up a single word. It will be deﬁned in terms of
other English words, all of which are found in the dictionary. Included with
the deﬁnition of the word is a list of synonyms—words having the same or
almost the same meaning. Next, if we look up one of the synonyms, we will
ﬁnd a new list of synonyms for the second word. If we continue the process in
this manner, then eventually, because there are only a ﬁnite number of words
in the dictionary, we will look up a word that we have looked up before—it
may not be the word with which we started the process, but it will be a word
we have looked up before. Consequently, because there are only a ﬁnite num-
ber of words, it is impossible to deﬁne every word and also avoid circularity
of deﬁnitions. Thus, by necessity, an abstract mathematical system requires
some undeﬁned terms. In geometry, those undeﬁned terms may be words such
as, “point,” “line,” “distance,” “on,” etc.
A deﬁnition is an agreement to use a symbol, a word, or a short phrase to
substitute for something else, usually for some expression that is too long to
write easily or conveniently. Hence, in mathematics, a deﬁnition is simply an
agreed upon shorthand. For example, we agreed earlier that a prime number
is a natural number greater than one which is divisible only by itself and one.
Of course, this deﬁnition requires us to know the deﬁnitions of a “natural
number,” of “greater than,” and of “divisible.” Usually, a deﬁnition is made
to introduce a new concept in terms the undeﬁned terms and previously given
deﬁnitions. Consequently, by substitution every deﬁnition could be written
in terms of undeﬁned terms only; however, such expressions would be lengthy
and tedious to read.
An axiom or postulate is a statement that is assumed to be true. The
axioms of a deductive mathematical system are the statements from which
all other statements of the system can be derived.
The Greeks were the
ﬁrst to develop the concept of a logical discourse based on a set of assumed
axioms. According to Aristotle, “every demonstrative science must start from
indemonstrative principles; otherwise, the steps of demonstration would be
endless.” A mathematical system is consistent if and only if contradictory
statements are not implied by the axioms of the system. A set of axioms is
inconsistent if it is possible to deduce from the axioms that some statement
is both true and false. An inconsistent mathematical system is worthless,
because the negation of any statement which can be deduced can be deduced
also. Hence, the one requirement that is made of a set of axioms is that it be
consistent. For aesthetical purposes, mathematicians attempt to keep both
the number of undeﬁned terms and the number of axioms of a system to a
minimum.

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
63
A theorem is a true statement that has been proved by a valid argument.
A proof is a logically valid deduction of a theorem from the premises of
the theorem, the axioms, or previously proven theorems. A formal proof
of a theorem is a ﬁnite sequence of statements S1, S2, . . ., Sk such that each
statement S is a premise of the theorem to be established, an axiom of the
system, follows from one or more of the preceding S’s by a logical rule of infer-
ence, or follows from one or more of the preceding S’s by a previously proven
theorem. Hence, a theorem or provable statement is the last statement
of some proof. Later in this chapter, we will present several techniques for
proving theorems.
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry Systems
Thales of Miletus (c. 640–546 B.C.) is considered to be the father of Greek
mathematics. Early in his life, he traveled to Egypt and learned the practical
geometry that the Egyptians knew. Thales is the ﬁrst person to conceive of
the idea of geometry as a deductive science, with a succession of propositions,
each resting upon the axioms and postulates and upon the propositions which
had been proven previously. A noted pupil of Thales was Pythagoras (c. 572–
501 B.C.), who was born on the island of Samos, not far from Miletus. To
acquaint himself with all learning of the time, he traveled to Greece, Egypt,
Babylonia, and India. Pythagoras and his disciples proved many theorems in
geometry, the most famous of which bears his name. He devoted much atten-
tion to the study of areas, volumes, proportions, and regular solids. During
the next three centuries, hundreds of Greek mathematicians pursued Thales’
vision of geometry by verifying geometric relationships, proving theorems,
and discovering constructions. According to the French mathematician and
philosopher Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912): “Science is built up with facts, as
a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than
a heap of stones is a home.” Prior to the time of Thales and Pythagoras,
geometry consisted of a collection of disorganized facts. The Egyptians knew
geometrical truths thousands of years earlier and the Babylonians even earlier.
However, their knowledge consisted mainly of a collection of empirical results
for surveying and constructing. The Greeks introduced order into geometry
and converted it from a collection of isolated facts into an organized science.
The organization and systematization of geometry was begun by Thales and
Pythagoras, continued by their successors, and culminated with the publi-
cation in about 300 B.C. of the treatise, Elements, by Euclid of Alexandria
(c. 325 B.C. to c. 265 B.C.). Euclid’s book has been the basis for the study
of geometry ever since.
It has even been said that next to the Bible, the
Elements may be the most translated, published, and studied book in the
Western world.
The Elements is based on twenty-three deﬁnitions, ﬁve postulates, and ﬁve
axioms. Euclid divided the statements he assumed to be true into two sets—
postulates and axioms. It is not clear why he did this, but perhaps he thought

64
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
some statements were more general or more “self-evident” than others. Cur-
rently, we call statements that are assumed to be true axioms or postulates,
interchangeably. The postulates of Euclid were
1. A straight line may be drawn between any two points.
2. Any terminated straight line may be produced indeﬁnitely.
3. About any point as center a circle with any radius may be described.
4. All right angles are equal.
5. If two straight lines lying in a plane are met by another line, making
the sum of the internal angles on one side less than two right angles,
then those straight lines will meet, if suﬃciently produced, on the side
on which the sum of the angles is less than two right angles.
The ﬁrst three postulates are postulates regarding construction and the fourth
postulate says that space is homogeneous. The ﬁfth postulate is called the
“parallel postulate.” In the Elements, Euclid proves twenty-eight propositions
(theorems) using only the ﬁrst four postulates. He needed the parallel pos-
tulate to prove the twenty-ninth proposition. The collection of statements of
geometry that can be proven using only the ﬁrst four postulates is known as
absolute geometry or neutral geometry. The ﬁfth century commentator
Proclus (410–485) wrote of the parallel postulate: “This ought even to be
struck out of the Postulates altogether; for it is a theorem involving many
diﬃculties . . . .” Although Proclus did not deny the truth of the ﬁfth pos-
tulate, he denied that it was “self-evident.” He even presented a false proof
of his own that the ﬁfth postulate could be deduced from the ﬁrst four pos-
tulates. The history of mathematics is ﬁlled with attempts to prove that the
parallel postulate is not a postulate but a theorem. For centuries mathemati-
cians tried to show the ﬁfth postulate was a theorem by either (1) deducing
it from the ﬁrst four postulates or (2) deducing it from the ﬁrst four postu-
lates and an additional “self-evident” postulate. Attempts of the ﬁrst kind
failed, because it is not possible to deduce the ﬁfth postulate from the ﬁrst
four. However, this fact was not proven until the mid-nineteenth century. At-
tempts of the second kind failed because every proposed alternate postulate
which was strong enough to permit the deduction of the parallel postulate
was no more “self-evident” than the original ﬁfth postulate.
In 1685, Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (1667–1733) entered the Jesuit Order.
He was ordained a priest in 1694 and taught at Jesuit colleges throughout
Italy. From 1699 until his death, he held the chair of mathematics at Pavia.
In 1697, Saccheri replaced the parallel postulate with a contrary assump-
tion. He intended to derive a contradiction from Euclid’s ﬁrst four postulates
and his assumed postulate, thereby deducing the ﬁfth postulate. Instead, he
succeeded in proving many theorems. Consequently, Saccheri was the ﬁrst
to postulate and develop a system of non-Euclidean geometry. However, he
did not realize this fact! He considered the results to be absurd, since they
violated ordinary geometrical intuition. In the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth cen-

tury, Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann developed the non-Euclidean
geometries.
The System of Natural Numbers
Mathematicians produce new objects to study in a variety of ways. One
way to produce new objects is through the speciﬁcation of a set of axioms—
which in essence provide “implicit deﬁnitions” of the objects. All other facts
about the new objects are derived through logical deduction. A second way to
produce new objects is to construct the objects from already existing objects.
During the nineteenth century, mathematicians carried out the “arithmeti-
zation of analysis.” In 1888, the German mathematician Richard Dedekind
(1831–1916) developed the set of natural numbers axiomatically. In 1889, the
Italian mathematician and logician Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) presented an
alternate axiomatic development of the set of natural numbers. Other math-
ematicians showed how to construct the integers from the natural numbers,
the rational numbers from the integers, the real numbers from the rational
numbers, and the complex numbers from the real numbers.
Peano’s axiomatic system for the natural numbers has three undeﬁned
terms: “1,”“number,” and “successor.” Peano’s ﬁve axioms are
P1. 1 is a number.
P2. Every number n has a unique successor, n′, which is a number.
P3. If m and n are numbers and if m′ = n′, then m = n.
P4. 1 is not the successor of any number.
P5. Let P be a property. If
(i) P(1) is true
and
(ii) for every n ∈N, P(n) is true ⇒P(n′) is true,
then for all n ∈N, P(n) is true.
Axioms P1 and P4 together say that 1 is the “ﬁrst” or “initial” element in
the set of natural numbers. Axiom P2 says that 1 has exactly one successor.
What Peano intends by axiom P2 is that the successor of n will be obtained
from n by adding 1—that is, Peano intends for n′ = n + 1. So the unique
successor of 1 is 1 + 1 = 2, and the unique successor of 2 is 3, and so forth.
The elements of the set of natural numbers essentially form a chain. The ﬁrst
link in the chain in the number 1, the second link in the chain is the number
2, and so on. The second axiom, P2, does not allow the chain to “branch”
or “divide” as more links are added, since only one unique link can be added
at an existing link. The third axiom, P3, prohibits the chain from “looping
back onto itself,” because P3 says that every natural number except 1 has a
unique “predecessor.” Axiom P5 is known as the principle of mathematical
induction. (See Chapter 6.) Mathematical induction permits one to establish
properties for an inﬁnite number of cases without having to provide an inﬁnite
number of proofs.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Peano knew that there were an inﬁnite number of sets in addition to the
set of natural numbers that satisﬁed the axioms P1 through P5. But he also
knew that all of these sets were “equivalent to” the set of natural numbers.
For example, if we deﬁne the successor of n to be n′ = n/2, then we obtain
the sequence of numbers 1, 1
2, 1
4, 1
8 . . ., which satisﬁes axioms P1 through P5.
From axioms P1 through P5 the following well-known theorems (properties)
for natural numbers can be proved.

The System of Integers
One of the ﬁrst things of a mathematical nature a young child learns to do
is count: “one, two, three, . . ..” That is, the child learns the names of the
elements of the set of natural numbers. Then a child learns to add single digit
natural numbers such as 2+3 by “counting on their ﬁngers.” Some time later
a child learns how to subtract 3 from 5 by asking and answering the question:
“What number do I add to 3 to get 5?” Hence, at an early age we learn that
subtraction is deﬁned in terms of addition. The following is the deﬁnition of
subtraction for sets of numbers.
Let S be a set of numbers and let m and n be elements of S. The number
x = m −n, read “m minus n” or “n subtracted from m,” is the number x
which makes the statement m = n + x true, if there is such a number x.
Thus, x = 3−1 is the number which makes 3 = 1+x a true statement. (Recall
that you learned how to add ﬁrst and then how to subtract. Furthermore,
you learned to “check” your subtraction result by addition.)
Theorem N1 for the natural numbers states that the natural numbers are
closed under addition. That is, if we add two natural numbers, we get another
natural number. Is the set of natural numbers closed under the operation of

subtraction? The answer is no. Ask a child: “If you have two apples and you
give both of them away, how many apples do you have left?” The child will
most likely answer “none.” Consequently, if we want a set of numbers which
contains the elements of the set of natural numbers and which is closed under
the operation of subtraction, we must enlarge the set of natural numbers by
including a number which represents the concept of “none.” The number we
need to include is called “zero” and it is represented by the symbol “0.” Let
W = {0, 1, 2, 3,. ..}. W contains the elements of the set of natural numbers
and the element 0. We “invented” the number 0 to have the property that for
all m ∈W, m−m = 0, or stated in terms of addition, 0 has the property that
for all m ∈W, m = m + 0. Therefore, the number 0 is called the additive
identity for the set W, because when one adds 0 to any number m ∈W
the result is m.
If we replace the set N by the set W in Theorems N1 through N9 and name
the new Theorems W1 through W9, respectively, we can prove that the set
W satisﬁes Theorems W1 through W9 and the additional following theorem:
Existence of an Additive Identity Property
W10
(∃0 ∈W)(∀m ∈W), m + 0 = m
Is the set W closed under the operation of subtraction?
That is, for all
m, n ∈W, is the number x = (m −n) ∈W? The answer is no, because
the number (2 −3) ̸∈W since there is no number x ∈W which makes the
statement 2 = 3+x true. The question we need to answer next is “What new
numbers do we need to combine with the elements of W in order to obtain a
new set which is closed under the operation of subtraction and, in addition,
satisﬁes Theorems W1 through W10 when the set W is replaced by the new
set? Let S be a set which contains the elements of W and all of the other
new numbers we need to “invent” so that S is closed under subtraction. That
is, we want S to have the property that if m, n ∈S, then (m −n) ∈S. Since
0 ∈W, 0 ∈S. And for every m ∈N, m ∈S. Thus, for every m ∈N we
need a new number x ∈S such that 0 −m = x ∈S. Because subtraction is
deﬁned in terms of addition, for every m ∈N we need a new number x ∈S
such that 0 = m + x is a true statement. We deﬁne that number x to be −m,
which is read “minus m” or “negative m.” Hence, for subtraction to be closed
in S, the set of numbers we need to include in S in addition to the numbers
in W is {. . ., −3, −2, −1}. Therefore, the “smallest set” which includes the
elements of the natural numbers and which is closed under subtraction is the
set of integers
Z = {. . ., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,3,. ..}.
Notice that the set of integers includes the set of natural numbers (which
is also called the positive integers), zero, and the set of negative integers
(the set {. . ., −3, −2, −1}). If we replace the set N by the set Z in Theorems
N1 through N9 and call the new theorems Z1 through Z9, and if we replace
the set W by the set Z in Theorem W10 and call the new Theorem Z10, we can

In summary, the natural numbers are closed under the operations of ad-
dition and multiplication (Theorems N1 and N2) and satisfy Theorems N3
through N9. We enlarged the set of natural numbers by including the num-
bers 0, −1, −2, . . . , and obtained the set of integers. The integers satisfy the
extended Theorems Z1 through Z11. Thus, the integers are closed under the
operations of addition, multiplication, and subtraction. However, subtraction
is not commutative nor associative as are addition and multiplication.

Mathematical Proofs
In mathematics, a proof is a logically valid deduction of a theorem from
the premises of the theorem, the axioms, or previously proven theorems. The
truth of any statement which appears in a proof must be traceable back to
the original axioms. In Section 2.2.1, we present the basic proof techniques
for proving conditional statements which include a direct proof, a proof by
contraposition, and a proof by contradiction.
In Section 2.2.2, we discuss
proof by cases and we show how to prove a biconditional statement by proving
two conditional statements by any of the techniques cited above. Next, we
consider proof by contradiction for any general statement—which includes
statements that are not conditional statements. Then, we indicate how to
prove statements which contain quantiﬁers. In Section 2.2.3, we present some
well-known mathematical conjectures and illustrate how to prove and disprove
conjectures. Finally, we examine properties of the system of rational numbers
and the system of real numbers.
2.2.1
Techniques for Proving the Conditional Statement
P⇒Q
Most mathematical theorems are of the form “If P, then Q”—that is, in
the form of the conditional statement P ⇒Q. Additional theorems which are
stated in the biconditional form “P if and only if Q” are proven by proving
both of the conditional statements P ⇒Q and Q ⇒P. At this point, we
present three basic types of proofs and simple examples of proofs which involve
the natural numbers and integers. First, we need the following deﬁnitions.
An integer n is even, if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k.
An integer n is odd, if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.
By deﬁnition, the set of even integers is
E = {2k | k ∈Z} = {. . ., −4, −2, 0, 2, 4,.. .}

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
73
and the set of odd integers is
O = {2k + 1 | k ∈Z} = {. . ., −3, −1, 1, 3, . ..}.
From the deﬁnitions of the set of integers, even integers, and odd integers,
we see that every integer is either even or odd and no integer is both even and
odd. Also we note that the negation of the statement “n is an even integer”
is “n is not an even integer,” which is logically equivalent to “n is an odd
integer.” Likewise, the negation of “n is an odd integer” is “n is an even
integer.”
Direct Proof
In a direct proof of the conditional statement P ⇒Q, we assume P and
then use axioms, deﬁnitions, rules of logical inference, previously proven the-
orems, and computations to infer Q. Hence, a direct proof has the following
form.
Direct Proof of P⇒Q
Proof: Assume P. . . . Therefore, Q. Hence, P ⇒Q.
Example 2.2.1.1 Give a formal direct proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 2.8
If n is an even integer, then n2 is an even integer.
Solution
Remarks: Our plan for this proof is to start by assuming the hypothesis—
namely, that n is an even integer.
Then we use the deﬁnition of an even
integer to assert that we can write n = 2k for some integer k.
Next, we
calculate n2 and perform the necessary computations to show that n2 = 2m
for some integer m. Hence, we prove n2 is an even integer by deﬁnition. A
formal proof consists of a list of true statements and associated justiﬁcations.
Proofs of all kinds vary from writer to writer. Here is our formal direct proof
of Theorem 2.8.
Proof:
1. n is an even integer
1. Premise
2. There exists a k ∈Z such that n = 2k
2. Deﬁnition of an even integer
3. n2 = (n)(n)

The advantage of a formal proof is that it makes you think about each step
in the proof and a justiﬁcation for the step. The disadvantage of a formal
proof is that it is tedious and lengthy. An informal proof, on the other hand,
is written in paragraph form and some justiﬁcations are omitted intentionally.
The justiﬁcations which are omitted depend upon the reading audience. The
following example presents an informal proof of Theorem 2.8.
Example 2.2.1.2 Give an informal direct proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 2.8
If n is an even integer, then n2 is an even integer.
Solution
Remark: In Example 2.2.1.1, we presented a formal proof of this theorem,
so our task is simply to rewrite that proof in paragraph form.
Proof: Let n be an even integer. By deﬁnition of even, there exists a k ∈Z
such that n = 2k. Squaring and using the associative property of multiplica-
tion, we ﬁnd
n2 = (2k)(2k) = 2(k(2k)) = 2m,
where
m = k(2k).
Since 2 and k are integers and since the integers are closed under multiplica-
tion, m = k(2k) is an integer. Consequently, since n2 = 2m where m is an
integer, it follows from the deﬁnition of an even integer that n2 is an even
integer.
■
Proof by Contraposition
One of the more useful logical equivalences is the that the conditional
statement P ⇒Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive ¬ Q ⇒¬ P.
When you cannot easily provide a direct proof of the statement P ⇒Q, it
is often a good idea to try to ﬁnd a proof of the contrapositive statement
¬ Q ⇒¬ P—either a direct proof or some other type of proof.
Since a
statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, by proving the con-
trapositive you have proven the statement also. Consequently, a proof by
contraposition has the form
Contrapositive Proof of P⇒Q
Proof: Assume ¬ Q.
. . .
Therefore, ¬ P.
Hence, ¬ Q ⇒¬ P. And
consequently, P ⇒Q.

Example 2.2.1.3 Prove the following theorem by the method of contrapo-
sition.
Theorem 2.9
Let n be an integer. If n2 is an even integer, then n is an
even integer.
Solution
Remarks: We will prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive—namely,
the statement “If n is not an even integer, then n2 is not an even integer.”
More precisely, since the phrase “m is not an even integer” is logically equiv-
alent to “m is an odd integer,” we will provide a direct proof of the contra-
positive statement “If n is an odd integer, then n2 is an odd integer.”
Proof: We will prove this theorem by contraposition. Let n be an odd integer.
By deﬁnition of odd, there exists a k ∈Z such that n = 2k + 1. Squaring and
using the distributive properties, the associative property of multiplication,
and the multiplicative identity property, we ﬁnd
n2 = (2k + 1)(2k + 1) = (2k + 1)(2k) + (2k + 1)(1)
= (2k)(2k) + 2k + 2k + 1 = 2(k(2k) + 2k) + 1 = 2p + 1,
where p = k(2k) + 2k. Since 2 and k are integers and since the integers are
closed under multiplication and addition, p is an integer. Consequently, since
n2 = 2p + 1 where p is an integer, it follows from the deﬁnition of an odd
integer that n2 is an odd integer. Hence, we have proven “If n is an odd
integer, then n2 is an odd integer,” and therefore, by contraposition, we have
proven “If n2 is an even integer, then n is an even integer.” ■
Try to develop a direct proof of Theorem 2.9.
Given two integers, exactly one of the following statements is true and the
other two are false:
(1) Both integers are odd.
(2) Both integers are even.
(3) One integer is odd and the other integer is even.
Therefore, we can conclude that the negation of the statement “both integers
are odd” is the statement “both integers are even, or one integer is odd and the
other integer is even” and vice versa. Likewise, the negation of the statement
“both integers are even or both integers are odd” is the statement “one integer
is odd and the other integer is even.” We will use this fact in the next example.
Example 2.2.1.4 Prove the following theorem by the method of contrapo-
sition.
Theorem 2.10
Let m and n be integers. If m + n is an even integer, then
either m and n are both even integers or m and n are both odd integers.

76
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Solution
Proof: We will prove this theorem by contraposition. Assume it is not the
case that “m and n are both even integers or m and n are both odd integers.”
By our discussion above it follows that one integer is odd and the other is
even.
We assume that m is odd and n is even.
Thus, we assume there
exists an integer k such that m = 2k + 1 and there exists an integer ℓsuch
that n = 2ℓ. Substituting, using the associative property of addition, the
commutative property of addition, and a distributive property, we ﬁnd
m + n = (2k + 1) + 2ℓ= 2k + (1 + 2ℓ) = 2k + (2ℓ+ 1)
= (2k + 2ℓ) + 1 = 2(k + ℓ) + 1 = 2p + 1
where p = k + ℓ. Since k and ℓare integers and since the integers are closed
under addition, p is an integer. Consequently, since m+n = 2p+1 where p is
an integer, it follows from the deﬁnition of an odd integer that m+n is an odd
integer. Hence, we have proven “If one integer is odd and the other integer
is even, then m + n is an odd integer,” and therefore, by contraposition, we
have proven “If m + n is an even integer, then either m and n are both even
integers or m and n are both odd integers.” ■
Remark: Instead of assuming m is odd and n is even, we could have assumed
that m is even and n is odd and obtained the same result.
Proof of P⇒Q by Contradiction
In a proof by contradiction, we prove that a statement is true by showing
that it cannot possibly be false. That is, we assume a statement is false and
then produce some contradiction. We conclude that the statement cannot be
false, and therefore, it must be true. Recall that the statement P ⇒Q is
logically equivalent to the statement (¬ P) ∨Q. To prove by contradiction
that the statement P ⇒Q is true, we assume P ⇒Q is false, which is
equivalent to assuming ¬ (P ⇒Q) is true.
Since P ⇒Q ≡(¬ P) ∨Q,
¬ (P ⇒Q) ≡¬ ((¬ P) ∨Q). By a De Morgan law and double negation, we
obtain
¬(P ⇒Q) ≡¬((¬P) ∨Q) ≡¬(¬P) ∧(¬Q) ≡P ∧(¬Q).
Consequently, a proof of P ⇒Q by contradiction has the form
Proof of P⇒Q by Contradiction
Proof: Assume P ∧(¬ Q). . . . Therefore, C, where C is a contradiction.
Hence, P ⇒Q.
Most often the contradiction C which is reached has the form R ∧(¬ R)
where R is any statement.
The advantage of a proof by contradiction is
that the statement R may be any statement whatsoever.
However, when
actually developing the proof, the disadvantage is not knowing in advance
what statement R to select to produce the desired contradiction. The following
example illustrates proving a theorem by the technique of contradiction.

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
77
Example 2.2.1.5 Prove the following theorem by the method of contradic-
tion.
Theorem 2.11
Let n be an integer. If n2 is an odd integer, then n is an
odd integer.
Solution
Proof: Let P denote the statement “n2 is an odd integer” and let Q de-
note the statement “n is an odd integer.”
We will prove this theorem by
contradiction. Therefore, we assume P and ¬ Q. The negation of the state-
ment Q is “n is an even integer.”
Thus, there is an integer k such that
n = 2k. Squaring and using the associative property of multiplication, we
ﬁnd n2 = (2k)(2k) = 2(k(2k)) = 2p where p = k(2k). Since the integers
are closed under multiplication, p is an integer, and, consequently, n2 is an
even integer. The statement “n2 is an even integer” is the statement ¬ P.
Thus, we assumed the statements P and ¬ Q are true and we deduced that
the statement ¬ P is true. Hence, we reached the contradiction P ∧(¬ P).
Consequently, we have proven Theorem 2.11 by contradiction.
■
Remark: Observe in this case that the statement R in the contradiction
R ∧(¬ R) is the hypothesis P.
Although a direct proof, a proof by contraposition, and a proof by con-
tradiction are all acceptable forms of proof, most mathematicians, order of
preference for a proof is a direct proof, followed by a proof by contraposition,
followed by a proof by contradiction.
In the following example, the same
statement is proven using each type of proof.
Example 2.2.1.6
Prove the following theorem by (a) a direct proof,
(b) a proof by contraposition, and (c) a proof by contradiction.
Theorem 2.12
If n is an odd integer, then 5n −3 is an even integer.
Solution
(a) A Direct Proof
Let n be an odd integer. By deﬁnition of odd, there exists an integer k such
that n = 2k + 1. Substituting for n, we ﬁnd
5n −3 = 5(2k + 1) −3 = 10k + 5 −3 = 10k + 2 = 2(5k + 1) = 2p
where p = 5k + 1. Since p = 5k + 1 is an integer, 5n −3 is an even integer.
(b) A Proof by Contraposition
Assume 5n −3 is not an even integer—that is, assume 5n −3 is an odd
integer. Thus, there exists an integer k such that 5n −3 = 2k + 1. Since
n = 5n −4n = 5n −3 −4n + 3 = (5n −3) −4n + 3
= 2k + 1 −4n + 3 = 2k −4n + 4 = 2(k −2n + 2)

78
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
and since k −2n + 2 is an integer, n is even. Hence, if 5n −3 is not an even
integer, n is not an odd integer. By contraposition, if n is odd, then 5n −3 is
even.
(c) A Proof by Contradiction
Assume n is an odd integer and 5n −3 is an odd integer. Because n is odd,
there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1. Substituting, we ﬁnd
5n −3 = 5(2k + 1) −3 = 10k + 5 −3 = 10k + 2 = 2(5k + 1).
Since 5k + 1 is an integer, 5n −3 is an even integer, which contradicts our
assumption that 5n −3 is an odd integer.
Remark: Observe in this case that the statement R in the contradiction
R ∧(¬ R) is the conclusion Q.

Additional Proof Techniques
In this section, we present a few more elementary techniques for proving
theorems. First, we discuss a proof by cases which can be used when the hy-
pothesis can be subdivided into a number of distinct cases and the conclusion
proven separately for each case. Next, we show how to prove a biconditional
statement. Then, we consider a proof by contradiction for any general state-
ment. Finally, we show how to prove statements which contain quantiﬁers.
Proof by Cases or Proof by Exhaustion
The following is a proof of the logical equivalence
((P ∨Q) ⇒R) ≡(P ⇒R) ∧(Q ⇒R).
Proof:
((P ∨Q) ⇒R) ≡¬(P ∨Q) ∨R
Deﬁnition of implication
≡((¬P) ∧(¬Q)) ∨R
A De Morgan law
≡((¬P) ∨R) ∧((¬Q)) ∨R)
A distributive law
≡(P ⇒R) ∧(Q ⇒R)
Deﬁnition of implication
(twice)
In a proof by cases, which is also called a proof by exhaustion, one
proves (P ∨Q) ⇒R by proving P ⇒R by any technique and proving
Q ⇒R by any technique. Thus, a proof by cases or a proof by exhaustion
has the following basic form.
A Proof of (P ∨Q) ⇒R by Cases or Exhaustion
Proof: Prove P ⇒R by any technique. Prove Q ⇒R by any technique.
Therefore, (P ∨Q) ⇒R, since ((P ∨Q) ⇒R) ≡(P ⇒R) ∧(Q ⇒R).
For example, to prove a theorem regarding the set of integers, we might
subdivide the proof into two cases—one in which we prove the conclusion for
the set of even integers and another in which we prove the conclusion for the
set of odd integers. To prove a theorem for the set of real numbers, we might
divide the proof into two or three cases. In the two case proof, we could divide
the set of real numbers into the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational
numbers and then prove the desired conclusion for the set of rational numbers
and also prove the conclusion for the set of irrational numbers. In a three case
proof regarding the real numbers, we might divide the real numbers into three
sets: (1) the set of positive real numbers, (2) the set {0}, and (3) the set of

80
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
negative real numbers, and then prove the conclusion for cases (1), (2), and
(3). In a proof by exhaustion, extreme care must be taken to be certain that
every possible case has been considered. Of course, a proof by exhaustion is
most appealing when the total number of possibilities is relatively small. In
general, if the hypotheses can be divided into n distinct and exhaustive cases
P1, P2, . . . , Pn, then to prove (P1∨P2 ∨. . .∨Pn) ⇒R one proves P1 ⇒R,
and P2 ⇒R, . . . , and Pn ⇒R.
Example 2.2.2.1 Prove the following theorem by cases.
Theorem 2.13
If n is an integer, then n2 + n is an even integer.
Proof: We prove this theorem by considering the following two cases.
Case 1. Assume n is an even integer. Hence, there exists an integer k such
that n = 2k. Computing, we ﬁnd
n2 + n = (2k)2 + 2k = 4k2 + 2k = 2(2k2 + k) = 2p,
where p = 2k2+k. Since 2 and k are integers and since the integers are closed
under multiplication and addition, p is an integer, and consequently n2 + n is
an even integer.
Case 2. Assume n is an odd integer. Then there exists an integer m such
that n = 2m + 1. Computing, we ﬁnd
n2 + n = (2m + 1)2 + 2m + 1 = 4m2 + 4m + 1 + 2m + 1
= 4m2 + 6m + 2 = 2(2m2 + 3m + 1) = 2q,
where q = 2m2+3m+1. Since 1, 2, 3, and m are integers and since the integers
are closed under multiplication and addition, q is an integer, and consequently
n2 + n is an even integer. ■
The previous theorem was proved by dividing the proof into two cases. The
Four Color Problem (see Section 2.2.3 for more details) asks if every planar
map can be colored with four or fewer colors in such a way that no two
adjacent regions are the same color. This question was ﬁrst posed in 1852. In
1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved the Four Color Theorem
by considering 1879 cases! The original proof required more than three and
one-half years and more than ten billion computer calculations. Later, the
number of cases required was reduced to 1476.
The next theorem we prove requires only four cases. It is called the triangle
inequality and has its origin in geometry, where it is stated as follows:
“The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater
than the length of the third side.”

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs

Recall that for a real number x the absolute value of x, denoted by |x|,
is deﬁned as
|x| =



x, if x ≥0
−x, if x ≤0
We now state and prove the triangle inequality for the set of real numbers.
It is very useful in solving many applications and is especially useful in proving
theorems in real analysis.
Triangle Inequality Theorem For every two real numbers x and y,
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y|.
Proof: We prove this theorem by considering four exhaustive cases.
Case 1. Suppose x ≥0 and y ≥0. Then |x| = x and |y| = y. Since
x ≥0 and y ≥0, x + y ≥0 (a theorem which you might want to prove)
and consequently |x + y| = x + y. Hence, |x + y| = x + y = |x| + |y|. Thus,
when x ≥0 and y ≥0, the triangular inequality reduces to the equality
|x + y| = |x| + |y|.
Case 2. Suppose x < 0 and y < 0. Then |x| = −x and |y| = −y. Since
x < 0 and y < 0, x+y < 0 (another theorem which you might want to prove)
and so |x + y| = −(x + y). Hence,
|x + y| = −(x + y) = −x −y = −x + (−y) = |x| + |y|.
That is, when x < 0 and y < 0 the triangular inequality again reduces to the
equality |x + y| = |x| + |y|.
Case 3. In this case, we assume x > 0 and y < 0 or we assume x < 0
and y > 0. Remark: However, we do not need to assume and prove both
cases, because they are equivalent since the triangle inequality is symmetric
with respect to the variables x and y. That is, if all occurrences of x are
replaced by y and all occurrences of y are replaced by x, then the expression
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y| remains the same. Assuming x > 0 and y < 0, |x| = x and
|y| = −y. However, the sum x+y can be nonnegative or negative, so we must
consider both subcases Case 3.1 and Case 3.2.
Case 3.1 Assume x > 0, y < 0, and x + y ≥0. Then |x| = x, |y| = −y,
and |x + y| = x + y. Since y < 0, 0 < −y and y < −y. Adding x to the last
inequality, we get x + y < x −y. Hence,
|x + y| = x + y < x −y = x + (−y) = |x| + |y|.
Case 3.2 Assume x > 0, y < 0, and x + y < 0. Then |x| = x, |y| = −y,
and |x+y| = −(x+y). Since x > 0, we have −x < 0 < x and −x−y < x−y.
Therefore,
|x + y| = −(x + y) = −x −y < x −y = x + (−y) = |x| + |y|.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Proof of the Biconditional Statement P ⇔Q
In Section 1.3, we showed that the biconditional statement P ⇔Q is logi-
cally equivalent to (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P). Hence, the proof of a biconditional
statement has the following form.
A Proof of the Biconditional Statement P ⇔Q
Proof: Prove P ⇒Q by any technique. Prove Q ⇒P by any technique.
Therefore, P ⇔Q, since P ⇔Q ≡(P ⇒Q ) ∧(Q ⇒P).
Example 2.2.2.2 Prove the following theorem.
Theorem 2.14
An integer n is even if and only if n2 is an even integer.
Proof: In Example 2.2.1.2, we presented a direct proof of Theorem 2.8: If n
is an even integer, then n2 is an even integer.
Remark: If we had not proven Theorem 2.8 previously, we would write its
proof here.
In Example 2.2.1.3, we gave a proof by contraposition of Theorem 2.9: If
n2 is an even integer, then n is an even integer.
Remark: If we had not proven Theorem 2.9 earlier, we would present its
proof here.
Let P be the statement “n is an even integer” and let Q be the statement
“n2 is an even integer.” Since we have proven both P ⇒Q and Q ⇒P, we
have proven the biconditional statement P ⇔Q, which is Theorem 2.14. ■
Example 2.2.2.3
Prove the following theorem.
Theorem 2.15
Let m and n be integers. The integer mn is even if and
only if m is even or n is even.
Proof: First, we prove if mn is even, then m is even or n is even. Suppose
mn is even. Then there exists an integer k such that (1) mn = 2k. If m is
even, we are done. So suppose, to the contrary, m is odd. Then (2) m = 2j+1
for some integer j. Substituting (2) into (1), we ﬁnd (2j + 1)n = 2k, and so
(3) 2jn + n = 2k. Subtracting 2jn from both sides of equation (3), we get
(4) n = 2k −2jn = 2(k −jn). Since j, k, and n are integers and the integers
are closed under multiplication and subtraction, it follows from equation (4)
that n is an even integer. Thus, if mn is even, then m is even or n is even.
Next, we prove if m is even or n is even, then mn is even. Since by hy-
pothesis m or n is even, we may assume for deﬁniteness that m is even.
Thus, there exists an integer k such that m = 2k.
Calculating, we ﬁnd
mn = (2k)n = 2(kn). Consequently, mn is even. Hence, if m is even or n is
even, mn is even. ■
Remark: Since we have proven “If mn is even, then m is even or n is even”
and since we have also proven “If m is even or n is even, mn is even” we have
proven Theorem 2.15.

Proof by Contradiction
In Section 2.2.1 we showed how to prove the statement P ⇒Q by con-
tradiction.
A proof by contradiction of the statement P (which may or
may not be a conditional statement) is based on the logical equivalence
P ≡((¬ P) ⇒C) where C is a contradiction. To prove this equivalence,
we recall the conditional statement (A ⇒B) ≡((¬ A) ∨B), so ((¬ P) ⇒C)
≡(¬ (¬ P) ∨C) ≡(P ∨C) by double negation. Since C is a contradiction,
C is a false statement and therefore (P∨C) ≡P. Hence, P ≡((¬ P) ⇒C)
where C is a contradiction, and the proof of the statement P by contradiction
has the form:
A Proof of the Statement P by Contradiction
Proof: Assume ¬ P. . . . Therefore, C a contradiction. Hence, P.
Often the contradiction C will be of the form R ∨(¬ R) where R is any
statement.
A proof by contradiction of the statement P is also called an
indirect proof or a reductio ad absurdum proof.
Example 2.2.2.4
Prove the following statement by contradiction.
The integer 512 cannot be written as the sum of one odd integer and two
even integers.
Proof: Assume to the contrary that (1) 512 = x + y + z where x is an odd
integer and y and z are both even integers. Since x is odd, (2) x = 2k + 1 for
some integer k. And since y and z are both even, there exist integers ℓand
m such that (3) y = 2ℓand (4) z = 2m. Substituting (2), (3), and (4) into
(1) and rearranging algebraically, we ﬁnd
(5)
512 = x + y + z = (2k + 1) + 2ℓ+ 2m = 2(k + ℓ+ m) + 1.
Since k + ℓ+ m is an integer, it follows from equation (5) that 512 is an odd
integer, which is a contradiction. Thus, by contradiction we have proved the
statement “The integer 512 cannot be written as the sum of one odd integer
and two even integers.”
■
At this point, we need the following deﬁnitions. Let a and b be natural
numbers.
The number a divides b if and only if there exists a natural number c such
that ac = b. If a divides b, then we also say a is a factor of b and b is
divisible by a.
A prime number (or simply a prime) is a natural number greater than
one which is divisible only by itself and one.
A composite number (or simply a composite) is a natural number
greater than one which is not a prime number.

84
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The natural number 1 has special status among the natural numbers; it
is not a prime number and it is not a composite number. All other natural
numbers are either prime or composite but not both. Observe that 1 divides
all natural numbers a, since 1a = a and that the only natural number which is
a factor of 1 is 1 itself. It follows from the deﬁnition of composite number that
the natural number n is composite if and only if there exist natural numbers
a and b such that n = ab where 1 < a < n and 1 < b < n.
We state the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which is also known
as the Unique Factorization Theorem without proof. We prove this theorem
later in Section 6.2.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every natural number greater
than one is a prime or can be written uniquely as a product of primes except
for the order in which the prime factors are written.
Observe that 11 is a prime and the composite 12 = 2 · 2 · 3 = 2 · 3 · 2. Thus,
the prime 2 is a factor of 12 exactly twice and the prime 3 is a factor of 12
exactly once and 12 can be written uniquely as 12 = 2·2·3 except for the fact
that the order of the prime factors on the right-hand side of the last equation
may be changed.
About 350 B.C., Euclid proved “The number of prime numbers is inﬁnite.”
He published this result in his treatise, the Elements. His proof is by con-
tradiction and goes as follows. Suppose on the contrary that the number of
prime numbers is ﬁnite and let the list of primes be p1, p2, . . ., pk. Consider
(1) q = p1 · p2 · . . . · pk + 1. Since p1, p2, . . ., pk are natural numbers, all of
which are greater than one, q is a natural number greater than one. There-
fore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, either q is a prime or q can
be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. In either case, q has a
prime factor. Since p1, p2, . . ., pk is the complete list of prime numbers, some
pj where 1 ≤j ≤k is a factor of q and it is also a factor of the product
p1 · p2 · . . . · pk. We can rewrite equation (1) as (2) q −(p1 · p2 · . . . · pk) = 1.
Since for some j where 1 ≤j ≤k, pj is a factor of both q and p1 · p2 · . . . · pk,
pj is a factor of the left-hand side of equation (2); consequently, the prime pj
is a factor of 1, which is a contradiction. Hence, the assumption that there
is only a ﬁnite number of prime numbers is false. Therefore, the number of
prime numbers is inﬁnite.
As of October 2013, the largest known prime was the Mersenne prime
257,885,161 −1. Written in standard decimal form, this number is 17,425,170
digits long.
Proofs of Statements Containing Quantiﬁers
Although quantiﬁers may not be stated explicitly, most mathematical the-
orems are actually quantiﬁed statements. Furthermore, most of the time the
universe of discourse is not stated explicitly but is usually understood from
the context. In what follows, we will let U denote the universe of discourse.

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
85
The quantiﬁed statement (∀x ∈U)(P(x)) is true if and only if the truth set of
the statement P(x) is the entire universe, U. Hence, to prove (∀x ∈U)(P(x)),
we let x be an arbitrary element of U and deduce that P(x) is true. Conse-
quently, a proof of the universal statement (∀x ∈U)(P(x)) has the following
form.
A Proof of the Universal Statement (∀x ∈U)(P(x))
Proof: Let x ∈U. . . . P(x) is true. Hence, (∀x ∈U)(P(x)) is true.
The following example illustrates this method of proof.
Example 2.2.2.5 Prove “For all odd integers n, the integer n2 is odd.”
Proof: Let n be an arbitrary odd integer. Since n is odd, there exists an
integer k such that n = 2k + 1. Squaring this equation and rearranging, we
ﬁnd
n2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1.
Since 2 and k are integers and since the set of integers is closed under addition
and multiplication, 2k2 + 2k is an integer and, by deﬁnition, n2 is an odd
integer.
■
Notice that the statement “For all odd integers n, the integer n2 is odd”
is logically equivalent to the conditional statement “If n is an odd integer,
then n2 is an odd integer.” Consequently, to prove (∀x ∈U)(P(x) ⇒Q(x)),
we let x be an arbitrary element of the universal set U, we assume P(x)
is true, and we deduce that Q(x) is true.
That is, we show for arbitrary
x ∈U, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is a true statement.
The quantiﬁed statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)) is true provided the truth set
of P(x) is not the empty set. There are two ways we can prove the exis-
tence statement (∃x ∈U)(P(x)). We can present a constructive proof
by exhibiting or explaining how to construct an element x in U having the
property P(x). Or, we can present a nonconstructive proof by making a
valid argument that some element x in U makes the statement P(x) true. In
a nonconstructive proof, we do not exhibit a speciﬁc element in the universal
set which makes the statement P(x) true.
For example, to prove the theorem “There exists an even prime” all we
need do is to note that the natural number 2 is even and it is divisible by
only 1 and itself only. Thus, by exhibiting the even, prime, natural number
2, we have given a constructive proof of the statement: “There exists an even
prime.”
Nonconstructive proofs often depend upon other theorems. For instance, to
prove the theorem “There is a real solution of the equation x3−2x+5 = 0” we
make use of both the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the Conjugate
Root Theorem. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states “If p(x) is a
polynomial of degree n ≥1 with complex coeﬃcients, then there exist n
solutions of the equation p(x) = 0.” The Conjugate Root Theorem states “If

86
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
p(x) is a polynomial of degree n ≥2 with real coeﬃcients, then if a+bi where
b ̸= 0 is a solution of the equation p(x) = 0, then a −bi is a solution also.”
Thus, the Conjugate Root Theorem states that complex roots of polynomials
with real coeﬃcients of degree greater than or equal to two, occur in pairs
(complex conjugate pairs). We will assume the truth of these theorems. Their
proofs can be found in books on mathematical analysis. A nonconstructive
proof of the statement “There is a real solution of the equation x3−2x+5 = 0”
proceeds as follows: Let p(x) = x3 −2x + 5. Observe that the polynomial
p(x) is of degree 3 and has real coeﬃcients. By the Fundamental Theorem
of Algebra the equation p(x) = x3 −2x + 5 = 0 has exactly three solutions.
By the Conjugate Root Theorem p(x) = 0 has an even number of complex
roots—either 2 or 0. Hence, the equation p(x) = 0 must have 1 or 3 real roots.
Sometimes there is one and only one element x ∈U which makes a state-
ment P(x) true. That is, sometimes there is a unique element x ∈U such that
P(x) is true. A theorem which states that there is one and only one element in
a speciﬁc set which satisﬁes a certain statement is called a uniqueness the-
orem. A uniqueness theorem is most often proven by contradiction. Thus,
one assumes that there are two elements x and y in the universe U such that
P(x) and P(y) are true and x ̸= y. Then by a valid argument one arrives at
the contradiction x = y—that is, x and y are the same element of U. In the
following example, we prove the uniqueness of the additive identity 0 of the
set of integers Z.
Example 2.2.2.6
The existence of an additive identity theorem for the set
of integers stated symbolically in Section 2.1 was
Z10
(∃0 ∈Z)(∀m ∈Z), m + 0 = m
Prove that “The additive identity 0 for the set of integers Z is unique.”
Proof: Assume, on the contrary, there exist two distinct additive identities
0, 0′ ∈Z which satisfy (1) m + 0 = m ∀m ∈Z and (2) m + 0′ = m ∀m ∈Z.
Since equation (1) is true for every m ∈Z, in (1) let m = 0′, then (1) becomes
(3) 0′ + 0 = 0′. Since equation (2) is true for every m ∈Z, in (2) let m = 0,
then (2) becomes (4) 0+0′ = 0. By Z3, the commutative theorem of addition
for the integers, (5) 0′ + 0 = 0 + 0′. Hence, from (3), (4), and (5)
0′ = 0′ + 0 = 0 + 0′ = 0. ■
In the exercises you will be asked to prove that the additive inverse of
an integer is unique and the multiplicative identity for the set of integers is
unique. These proofs should be similar in form to the proof of Example 2.2.2.6.
Sometimes a uniqueness proof can be presented in such a way that it does
not appear to be a proof by contradiction. For example, one proof of the
uniqueness theorem, “The natural number 2 is the only even prime,” is as
follows. The natural number 2 is the only even prime, because all other even
natural numbers are divisible by 2 and therefore are not prime numbers.

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
87
Earlier, we proved there is an inﬁnite number of primes. Therefore, for
any natural number M, no matter how large, there is an inﬁnite number of
primes larger than M. Nonetheless, in the next theorem, we show that we can
ﬁnd arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive natural numbers where there are
no primes. Two natural numbers are consecutive if their diﬀerence is one.
Thus, 3 and 4 are consecutive natural numbers. Unknown consecutive natural
numbers may be written as x and x+1, or x−1 and x. Likewise, a sequence of
n consecutive natural numbers may be represented by x, x+1, . .., x+(n−1).
We wish to prove that for every natural number n, there exists a sequence of
n consecutive natural numbers such that none of the numbers is a prime. The
ﬁrst several sequences of consecutive composite (nonprime) natural numbers
with length two or more are < 8, 9, 10 >, < 14, 15, 16 >, < 20, 21, 22 >,
< 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 >, < 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 >, < 38, 39, 40 > . . . ..
Thus, a
few sequences of two consecutive composite natural numbers are < 8, 9 >,
< 9, 10 >, < 14, 15 >, < 15, 16 >, < 20, 21 > . . .. And a few sequences
of three consecutive composite numbers are < 8, 9, 10 >, < 14, 15, 16 >,
< 20, 21, 22 >, < 24, 25, 26 >, < 25, 26, 27 >, < 26, 27, 28 >, . . ..
Notice
in the following sequences of two consecutive composite numbers the ﬁrst
number is divisible by 2 and the second number is divisible by 3: < 8, 9 >,
< 14, 15 >, < 20, 21 > . . .. Also notice in the following sequences of three
consecutive composite numbers the ﬁrst number is divisible by 2, the second
number is divisible by 3, and the third number is divisible by 4: < 14, 15, 16 >,
< 26, 27, 28 >, < 34, 35, 36 >, < 38, 39, 40 >, . . ..
Consequently, for each
natural number n, we would like to ﬁnd, if possible, a number x such that the
n consecutive natural numbers x, x+1, . . ., x+(n−1) are all composite, and,
furthermore, x is divisible by 2, x+1 is divisible by 3, . . ., x+i is divisible by
i+2, . . ., and x+(n−1) is divisible by n+1. Since 2, 3, . . ., (n+1) all divide
(n + 1)!, our ﬁrst guess for x is ˆx = (n + 1)! Clearly, 2 divides ˆx. Checking
ˆx+1 = (n+1)!+1, we ﬁnd it is not divisible by 3. We make our second guess
for x by adding 2 to ˆx, so that x = (n+1)!+2 will be divisible by 2. Rewriting
x + 1 = [(n + 1)! + 2] + 1 as x + 1 = (n + 1)! + 3 = 3{[2 · 4 · 5 · · ·(n + 1)] + 1},
we see that x + 1 is divisible by 3. And rewriting x + 2 = [(n + 1)! + 2] + 2 as
x + 2 = (n + 1)! + 4 = 4{[2· 3 · 5 · · ·(n + 1)] + 1}, we see that x + 2 is divisible
by 4. In general, for 0 ≤i ≤n −1, we ﬁnd
x + i = [(n + 1)! + 2] + i = (n + 1)! + (2 + i)
= (2 + i){[2 · · ·(1 + i)(3 + i) · · ·(n + 1)] + 1}.
So, x + i is divisible by 2 + i for 0 ≤i ≤n −1.
The previous paragraph indicates the trial-and-error process and the
“scratch work” which one must perform before writing the informal proof
which appears in the following example. Notice that very little of the original
scratch work appears in the proof itself.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Example 2.2.2.7
Prove the following theorem regarding the existence of n
consecutive nonprimes.
Theorem 2.16
For every natural number n, there exists a sequence of n
consecutive natural numbers which contain no primes.
Proof: Let n be an arbitrary natural number and let x = (n + 1)! + 2.
Consider the n consecutive natural numbers x + i where 0 ≤i ≤n −1. The
number x + i is divisible by 2 + i, as the following computation shows. For
0 ≤i ≤n −1,
x + i = [(n + 1)! + 2] + i = (2 · 3 · · ·(n + 1)) + (2 + i)
= (2 + i){[2 · · ·(1 + i)(3 + i) · · ·(n + 1)] + 1}. ■
A corollary is a theorem which follows so obviously from the proof of
another theorem that no proof, or almost no proof, is necessary. Since for all
natural numbers n and for all natural numbers k, the n consecutive natural
numbers xk + i = k(n + 1)! + 2 where 0 ≤i ≤n −1 are divisible by 2 + i, we
obtain the following corollary to Theorem 2.16.
Corollary 2.16.1
For every natural number n, there exists an inﬁnite num-
ber of sequences of n consecutive natural numbers which contain no primes.
It follows from this corollary that if one searches sequentially through the
natural numbers for prime numbers, one will often encounter arbitrarily long
sequences of consecutive natural numbers which contain no prime.

2.2.3
Conjectures, Proofs, and Disproofs
Recall that a theorem is a statement that has been proved true by a valid
argument, while, in mathematics, a conjecture is a statement that has been
proposed to be a true. If, and when, a conjecture is proved true, it becomes
a theorem. However, a conjecture may be disproved by producing a single
counterexample—an example which proves that the conjecture is a false
statement.
Since 22 −1 = 4−1 = 3 is a prime, since 23 −1 = 8−1 = 7 is a prime, since
25−1 = 32−1 = 31 is a prime, and since 27−1 = 128−1 = 127 is a prime, we
might make the conjecture that “For p a prime, 2p−1 is a prime.” To disprove
this statement, we must present a single counterexample. In this case, we note
that p = 11 is a prime and compute 211 −1 = 2048 −1 = 2047 = (23)(89),
which shows that 211 −1 is a composite. Thus, we have disproved the stated
conjecture. However, by disproving the conjecture, we have also proven the
theorem “There is a prime p such that 2p −1 is not a prime.”
We now present several well-known conjectures. Some have been proved to
be true and are now theorems, some have been disproved by counterexamples,
and still others remain “open” conjectures—conjectures for which the truth
value remains unknown.
Fermat’s Last Theorem In the USA, the word “arithmetic” refers to the
computational algorithms and procedures associated with natural numbers,
integers, and real numbers. Arithmetic is also commonly viewed as includ-
ing solving problems which involve ratios, proportions, decimal fractions, and
percents. To the ancient Greeks arithmetica was the study of the mathemati-
cal properties of natural numbers. In the USA, the arithmetica of the ancient
Greeks is known as number theory.
Pythagoras (c. 540 B.C.) was born on the island of Samos, a Greek island
in the Aegean Sea. One of his teachers was Thales. In order to acquaint
himself with the knowledge of his time, Pythagoras traveled widely in Greece,

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
91
Egypt, Babylonia, and India early in his life. Later, he founded a secret or-
der at Crotona in southern Italy. Members of the Pythagorean Brotherhood
devoted themselves to the study of mathematics and philosophy. Pythagoras
associated magic and mysticism with the study of arithmetic and geometry.
Pythagoras also stated and gave one or more proofs of the Pythagorean The-
orem:
Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle with c being
the length of the longest side. The triangle is a right triangle if
and only if a2 + b2 = c2.
Although this theorem bears Pythagoras’s name, it was known centuries prior
to his time. The Chinese stated the theorem in their text, Arithmetic in Nine
Sections, which was written before 1000 B.C., and the Egyptians mention the
use of the principle by their surveyors in 2000 B.C. A triple of natural numbers
(a, b, c) is called a Pythagorean triple if a2 + b2 = c2. The Pythagoreans
found a procedure for ﬁnding all such triples and there is an inﬁnite num-
ber of them. A clay tablet dating from between 1900 B.C. and 1600 B.C.
indicates that the Babylonians had studied such triples much earlier. The
tablet contains ﬁfteen Pythagorean triples. Based on the size of the numbers
in the triples, it is reasonable to assume the Babylonians had a procedure for
generating the triples. However, the procedure itself does not appear on the
tablet. In the Elements (c. 350 B.C.), Euclid provides a general procedure
for constructing all Pythagorean triples. The technique is as follows. If m
and n are natural numbers with m > n, and if a = m2 −n2, b = 2mn, and
c = m2 + n2, then a2 + b2 = c2. When m = 2 and n = 1, we obtain the
familiar, and smallest Pythagorean triple, (3, 4, 5).
Once a theorem has been proved, mathematicians often try to modify or
generalize the theorem in some manner. The “trick” is in knowing how to do
so. Fermat’s Last Theorem is one modiﬁcation of the Pythagorean Theorem.
Pierre Fermat (1601–1665) was the son of a wealthy French leather merchant.
Fermat received his law degree from the university at Orl´eans and in 1631, he
became a lawyer and government oﬃcial at Toulouse. He lived in Toulouse for
the rest of his life. Because he held public oﬃce, he was permitted to change
his name to Pierre de Fermat. Fermat’s vocation was the law, but his avid
avocation was mathematics. Fermat is best known as the father of Number
Theory and one of the founders of Analytic Geometry, Calculus, and Proba-
bility. However, he did not publish his results. Instead, he corresponded with
famous mathematicians throughout Europe including Etienne Pascal and his
son Blaise, Ren´e Descartes, Marin Mersenne, Gilles Persone de Roberval, and
John Wallis. After Fermat’s death in 1665, his friends became concerned
that his life’s work would be lost, since he never published. Therefore, they
convinced his son, Samuel, to undertake the task of collecting, organizing,
and publishing Pierre’s correspondence, mathematical notes, and comments
he had written in books. It is in this manner that Fermat’s Last Theorem came

92
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
to be known and published. In a translation of the Greek mathematician
Diophantus’s Arithmetica, Samuel found a marginal note stating what has
come to be known as Fermat’s Last Theorem:
For n a natural number greater than 2, the equation an + bn = cn
has no natural number solutions a, b, c.
Also in the margin Fermat had written, “I have discovered a truly remarkable
proof which this margin is too small to contain.” This note was probably writ-
ten about 1630 when Fermat ﬁrst studied Diophantus’s Arithmetica. At some
point, Fermat may have discovered his remarkable proof was wrong, since he
never sent the problem to any other mathematicians as a challenge problem.
Fermat did know how to prove the theorem for the cases n = 3 and n = 4,
and he did send those problems to others as a challenge. A very large number
of false proofs of Fermat’s Last Theorem have been published—between 1908
and 1912 alone, over 1000 such proofs appeared in print. In 1955, Yutaka
Taniyama (1927–1958) posed some questions regarding elliptic curves. Ad-
ditional investigations by Andr´e Weil (1906–1998) and G. Shimura resulted
in the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil Conjecture. In 1986, a connection between
this conjecture and Fermat’s Last Theorem was discovered. In June 1993,
the British mathematician Andrew Wiles (1953–
) “proved” the Shimura–
Taniyama–Weil Conjecture for a particular class of examples which included
Fermat’s Last Theorem as a corollary. During the reviewing process some
diﬃculties with Wiles’ proof emerged, but in October 1994, Wiles, with the
help of Richard Taylor, completed a simpler revised proof. Thus, after more
than 300 years, Fermat’s Last Theorem, which until 1994 should have been
called a conjecture, is indeed a theorem.
Euler’s Sum of Powers Conjecture In 1769, the renowned Swiss math-
ematician L´eonard Euler (1707–1783) generalized Fermat’s Last Theorem by
conjecturing
“For every natural number n > 2, a sum of at least n, nth powers
of natural numbers is necessary for the sum to be the nth power
of a natural number.”
In other words, Euler conjectured:
“For n > 2 for there to be natural numbers a1, a2, . . ., am, and b
which satisfy the equation an
1 + an
2 + · · · + an
m = bn, the natural
number m must be greater than or equal to n.”
Approximately 200 years later in 1967, L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin used a
systematic computer search to disprove this conjecture by ﬁnding the following
counterexample for n = 5:
275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445.
In 1988,
Noam Elkies constructed the following counterexample for n = 4: 26824404+
153656394 + 18796704 = 206156734. To date, no counterexamples to Euler’s
Sum of Powers Conjecture for n > 5 have been discovered.

Goldbach’s Conjecture In 1725, the Prussian mathematician and histo-
rian Christian Goldbach (1690–1764) became a professor of the newly opened
St. Petersburg Academy. In 1728, he went to Moscow to tutor Peter II (1715–
1730), Tsar of Russia (1727–1730). In a letter written to Euler on June 7,
1742, Goldbach proposed what is called the “weak” Goldbach conjecture:
“Every odd natural number greater than ﬁve can be written as a
sum of three primes.”
In his letter of reply, Euler stated the following “stronger” conjecture which
is now known as Goldbach’s Conjecture:
“Every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two
primes.”
Euler further stated in his letter “that every even number is the sum of two
primes, I consider an entirely certain theorem in spite of that I am not able
to demonstrate it.” The strong version of the conjecture implies the weak
version, since if n is an odd natural number greater than ﬁve, then n −3 is
even and if the stronger version is assumed to be true, then n−3 = p+q where
p and q are primes. And consequently, the odd natural number n = p+q+3 is
the sum of three primes. To date, no one has proved or disproved Goldbach’s
conjecture. However, by October 2003, T. Oliveira e Salva had shown the
conjecture to be true for all even natural numbers less than 6 × 1016.
It is understood that the two primes mentioned in Goldbach’s conjecture
need not be distinct. Moreover, two primes (p, q) such that p + q = 2k for
some natural number k greater than or equal to two are called Goldbach
pairs. The ﬁrst few Goldbach pairs are (2, 2) since 2 + 2 = 4, (3, 3) since
3 + 3 = 6, (3, 5) since 3 + 5 = 8, (3, 7) and (5, 5) since 3 + 7 = 5 + 5 = 10,
(5, 7) since 5 + 7 = 12, and (3, 11) and (7, 7) since 3 + 11 = 7 + 7 = 14.
Most mathematicians believe Goldbach’s conjecture is true, since the number
of Goldbach pairs increases rapidly as the size of the even natural number, n,
increases. For example, for n = 10 the number of pairs is 2, for n = 104 the
number of pairs is 127, and for n = 108 the number of pairs is 291, 400.
Twin Prime Conjecture
In 1849, the French mathematician Alphonse
de Polignac made the general conjecture:
“For every natural number k, there are inﬁnitely many prime pairs
which are a distance 2k apart.”
In the special case k = 1, we obtain the Twin Prime Conjecture:
“There are an inﬁnite number of primes p such that p + 2 is a
prime also.”
Thus, twin primes are pairs of primes of the form (p, p + 2). The ﬁrst few
twin primes are (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31) . . .. Except for the twin
prime pair (3, 5), all other twin prime pairs are of the form (6n −1, 6n + 1).
Although there is “overwhelming evidence” that the twin prime conjecture is
true, there is no valid proof yet.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The Four Color Problem
The four color problem asks if every planar
map can be colored with four or fewer colors in such a way that no two
adjacent regions are the same color. Two regions are adjacent if they share a
common border, not just a point. Figure 2.1 shows a map with four regions
which can be colored using just two colors, while Figure 2.2 shows a map with
four regions which cannot be colored with fewer than four colors.

Figure 2.2:
A four region map which requires four colors.
While coloring a map of the counties of England in 1852, Francis Guthrie
observed that four colors appeared to be suﬃcient to color any map, but he
was unable to prove it. Guthrie posed the problem to his former professor
August De Morgan. De Morgan posed the problem to other mathematicians
frequently, and in 1860 he published anonymously the ﬁrst known discussion
of the problem.
In the July 17, 1879, issue of Nature, the British lawyer
Alfred Kempe announced he had proved the four color problem. His proof
was published later in 1879 in the American Journal of Mathematics. Eleven
years later in 1890, Percy Heawood showed there was an error in Kempe’s
proof by giving an example of a map for which Kempe’s proof technique did
not work. However, Heawood was able to use Kempe’s proof technique to
prove that every planar map can be colored with ﬁve or fewer colors. The
four color problem was ﬁnally proven by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken
in 1977. Their proof was by cases and reduced the totality of all possible maps
to 1936 conﬁgurations (which was later reduced to 1476 conﬁgurations). Since
coloring veriﬁcation could not be performed by hand, each conﬁguration had

to be veriﬁed by computer. Thus, the four color problem was the ﬁrst major
theorem proved in mathematics for which the use of a computer was absolutely
essential.
Example 2.2.3.1 Prove or disprove each of the following statements. That
is, for a statement which is true, provide a proof, and for a statement which
is false, provide a counterexample.
1.
For a, b, and c natural numbers, if a divides b + c, then a divides b or a
divides c.
2.
For a, b, and c natural numbers, if a divides b and a divides c, then a
divides b + c.
Solution
1.
Let P(a, b, c) be the statement “a divides b+c,” let Q(a, b) be the state-
ment “a divides b,” and let R(a, c) be the statement “a divides c.” Writ-
ten symbolically, the given statement is P(a, b, c) ⇒(Q(a, b) ∨R(a, c)).
It appears this statement may be false.
To disprove the statement,
we must ﬁnd natural numbers a, b, and c such that P(a, b, c) and
¬(Q(a, b) ∨R(a, c)) ≡(¬Q(a, b) ∧¬R(a, c)) are true. Thus, to disprove
P ⇒(Q ∨R), we must ﬁnd natural numbers a, b, and c such that a
divides b + c, a does not divide b, and a does not divide c. Since the
sum of two odd numbers is even, and since 2 does not divide an odd
number, we select a = 2, b = 3, and c = 5. This selection for a, b, and c
disproves the given statement, because a = 2 divides 8 = 3 + 5 = b + c,
a = 2 does not divide 3 = b, and a = 2 does not divide 5 = c.
2.
Let statements P, Q, and R be as stated above. Written symbolically,
the given statement is (Q(a, b) ∧R(a, c)) ⇒P(a, b, c). If Q(a, b) is true,
then by deﬁnition, there exists a natural number k such that ak = b.
And, if R(a, c) is true, then there exists a natural number ℓsuch that
aℓ= c. By substitution and the distributive property
b + c = ak + aℓ= a(k + ℓ)
where k+ℓis a natural number. Hence, a divides b+c—that is, P(a, b, c)
is true.
Remark: In this instance, we have presented only the “scratch work” from
which we can construct a well written informal proof. What appears above
is not an informal proof! You should write your own well written proof to
complete this exercise. ■

The System of Rational Numbers and the System of
Real Numbers
In 1937, while excavating in central Czechoslovakia, Karl Absolom discov-
ered a prehistoric wolf bone dating from about 30,000 B.C. Fifty-ﬁve notches,
grouped into sets of ﬁve, are cut into the bone. The ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve notches
are separated from the second twenty-ﬁve by a double length notch. It is
reasonable to assume that the notches were made by some prehistoric man
who was counting something such as the number of animals he had killed or
the number of days since an important event. So at least 30,000 years ago,
man had the concept of a one-to-one correspondence between elements in two
diﬀerent sets and the idea of a base for a system of numbers.
Spoken language existed long before written language. And the advent of
writing appears to coincide with the transition from hunter-gatherer societies
to agrarian societies. Most probably, writing was invented at diﬀerent times
in many diﬀerent places—Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Central America
to name a few.

By 3000 B.C. the Egyptians had developed their hieroglyphic writing. Hi-
eroglyphs are pictures of objects which stand for a word, a concept, or a
sound. There are over 700 known Egyptian hieroglyphic symbols. As long as
hieroglyphics were only being carved into stone, there was no need for sym-
bols which could be written quickly. Later, the Egyptians made a paper-like
material from the papyrus reed—a plant which grows along the Nile river. By
peeling away the outer stem of the papyrus, cutting the soft pith inside into
strips, laying the strips side by side, pounding them with a mallet, and drying
them, the Egyptians were able to make a renewable, inexpensive material on
which to write. The tip of the papyrus reed was used as a pen to write on the
papyrus.
Most of our knowledge of Egyptian mathematics comes to us from writ-
ings on papyrus. At present, the best source we have for information about
Egyptian arithmetic is the Rhind papyrus. A. Henry Rhind was a Scottish
egyptologist who purchased the text in Luxor, Egypt, in 1858 and sold it to
the British Museum, where it is on display. The scroll is about 18 feet long and
1 foot wide. This papyrus is also known as the Ahmes papyrus in honor of the
scribe who wrote it. The Ahmes papyrus was written about 1650 B.C., but,
according to Ahmes, it was copied from an older document written between
2000 and 1800 B.C. The solution of eighty-one of the eighty-seven problems
on the Ahmes papyrus requires the use of fractions.
The Egyptians took a practical approach to mathematics. Their trade re-
quired that they could multiply, divide, and deal with fractions. However,
the Egyptian number system was not well suited for performing arithmetic
calculations. Therefore, by necessity, they devised methods for multiplication
and division which involved addition only.
In our system of fractions, any integer may appear in the numerator. How-
ever, in the Egyptian system of fractions, with the exception of the fractions 2
3
and 3
4, the only number which may appear in the numerator for computational
purposes is 1. A fraction of the form 1
n where n is a natural number is called
an Egyptian fraction or a unit fraction. Egyptians were able to solve
problems which would require calculations with a fraction such as 2
5 by ex-
pressing the fraction as the sum of two or more Egyptian fractions. Thus, they
would decompose 2
5 into Egyptian fractions by writing 2
5 = 1
3 + 1
15. Strangely
enough, they would never repeat the same fraction in a decomposition—that
is, they would not write 2
5 = 1
5 + 1
5. Since any fraction can be written as
a ﬁnite sum of Egyptian fractions, the Egyptians were able to solve many
problems which required the use of fractions.
Prior to 2776 B.C. at the latest, the Egyptians had invented a calendar
in which a year was 365 days long. They needed a calendar to aid in the
prediction of the ﬂooding of the Nile. Since the Nile ﬂooded shortly after the
star Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, ﬁrst appeared in the heavens after
the period when it was too close to the sun to be seen, the ﬁrst day of the
new year in the Egyptian calendar coincided with the rising of Sirius out of
the sun, which occurs in our month of July. Eventually, the year was divided

98
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
into 12 months of 30 days each with a 5 day period at the end of the year.
The Egyptian calendar is the basis for the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
Mesopotamia is a fertile plain located between the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers. Between 4500 and 4000 B.C. it was settled by the Ubaidians. About
3300 B.C. the Sumerians came to Mesopotamia. Initially, they used a sty-
lus to carve symbols on soft clay tablets which they had fashioned from the
clay in the region. Later, they developed an abstract form of writing on hand
sized clay tablets using cuneiform (wedge-shaped) symbols. The symbols were
wedge-shaped due to the instrument they used for writing. The clay tablets
were dried in the hot sun and thousands of them still exist to this day. The
counting system of the Sumerians was sexagesimal—that is, the base they used
for counting was base 60. It is not known why they chose this base; however,
60 is divisible by the ten numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 while our
base 10 system has only two divisors—2 and 5. About 2000 B.C. the Baby-
lonians invaded Mesopotamia and defeated the Sumerians. By 1900 B.C. the
Babylonians had established their new capital at Babylon. Babylonian math-
ematics was somewhat more advanced than Egyptian mathematics. Egyptian
mathematics was of a more practical nature, while Babylonian mathematics
was, in some aspects, more abstract. Babylonian fractions were more general;
however, not all fractions were permitted.
The Babylonians had no divi-
sion algorithm; instead they based their work with fractions on the identity
a
b = a × ( 1
b). That is, they calculated a divided by b by multiplying a by the
reciprocal of b, 1
b. Extensive Babylonian tables of reciprocals of numbers up
to several billion are still existent.
The Babylonian year was 360 days long, which gave rise to dividing the circle
into 360 degrees, which we still do today. Their zodiac had twelve equal sectors
of 30 degrees each. The Babylonian day was 12 hours long and each hour was
60 minutes in length. Hence, the Babylonian hour and minute were twice as
long as ours. For practical applications, the Babylonians approximated π by
3, but from tablets unearthed in 1936 it is evident they knew 3 1
8 was a better
approximation of π.
The System of Rational Numbers
Given a mathematical system S
which satisﬁes properties P but which does not satisfy a particular property
P ∗, mathematicians often try to construct a larger system S∗which contains
S, which still satisﬁes properties P, and which also satisﬁes property P ∗.
Since the set of natural numbers, N, is closed under the operations of addition
and multiplication for every pair of natural numbers m and n, the equation
x = m + n always has a solution x in the set of natural numbers and the
equation y = mn always has a solution y in the set of natural numbers.
However, the set of natural numbers is not closed under the operation of
subtraction—that is, for m and n natural numbers the equation w = m −n
does not always have a solution w in the set of natural numbers. Earlier, we
enlarged the set of natural numbers to the set of integers, Z, by adding to
the set of natural numbers the number 0 and for every m ∈N the number

(−m). In this manner, we obtained the set of integers which includes the
set of natural numbers and which is closed under the operations of addition,
multiplication, and subtraction.
The set of integers is not closed under the operation of division, since for
all integers m and n the equation mx = n does not always have an integer
solution x. Clearly, the equation 3x = 4 does not have an integer solution.
We wish to enlarge the set of integers to obtain a new set of numbers in such
a way that if m and n are in the new set, then the solution x of the equation
mx = n is always in the new set and the new set is closed under addition,
multiplication, and subtraction as well.
The operation of division is deﬁned in terms of multiplication. If m and
n are integers, then m divides n if there is a number x such that m · x = n.
Observe that division by the integer 0 is not deﬁned, since for n ̸= 0 there is
no integer x such that 0 · x = n, and since for n = 0 every integer x satisﬁes
0 · x = 0. Thus, we deﬁne a rational number and the set of rational numbers
as follows.
If m and n are integers and if m ̸= 0, then by a rational number we mean
the number x which satisﬁes the equation m · x = n. We write the rational
number x as n
m.
The set of rational numbers is the set
Q = { n
m | n, m ∈Z and m ̸= 0}.
The rational numbers 1
2, 2
4, 3
6 . . . are all diﬀerent representations for the
same rational number—the rational number x which satisﬁes the equation
2 · x = 1. Thus, we encounter for the ﬁrst time in the system of rational
numbers a system in which equality is not taken for granted. We give the
following deﬁnition of equality for two rational numbers.
The rational numbers n
m and p
q are equal, written n
m = p
q , if and only if
n · q = m · p.
By this deﬁnition 2
4 = 3
6, since 2 · 6 = 4 · 3 = 12. Observe that equality for
two rational numbers is a consequence of the properties for integers. Let n be
an integer. By associating the integer n with the rational number n
1 , we see
that every integer can be represented as a rational number. That is, the set
of integers is contained in the set of rational numbers.
Our deﬁnition of equality for rational numbers allows us to derive the fol-
lowing cancellation law for rational numbers.
If m, n, and p are integers and m ̸= 0 and p ̸= 0, then
n · p
m · p = n
m.

100
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The cancellation law follows easily from the commutative and associative
properties of multiplication for integers and from the deﬁnition of equality
for rational numbers, since
(n · p) · m = m · (n · p) = m · (p · n) = (m · p) · n.
In practice, we write
n · /p
m · /p = n
m.
A rational number n
m is in reduced form or simplest form if n and m have
no factors in common except for the number one.
We deﬁne multiplication and addition of rational numbers in terms of mul-
tiplication and addition of integers. In this section only, we will denote mul-
tiplication of rational numbers by ⊙and addition of rational numbers by ⊕
to emphasize these operations are deﬁned in terms of multiplication of inte-
gers denoted by · and addition of integers denoted by +. Thus, we deﬁne
multiplication and addition for rational numbers as follows.
If m
n and p
q are rational numbers, then multiplication, ⊙, is deﬁned by
the equation
m
n ⊙p
q = m · p
n · q .
If m
n and p
q are rational numbers, then addition, ⊕, is deﬁned by the
equation
m
n ⊕p
q = m · q + n · p
n · q
.
Using these deﬁnitions the following basic theorems for rational numbers
can be proven.

Any set Q with operations ⊕and ⊙deﬁned on it which satisﬁes properties
Q1 through Q12 is called a ﬁeld. Thus, the set of rational numbers is our
ﬁrst example of a ﬁeld.
The closure property for addition, Q1, holds in the rational numbers, be-
cause of the deﬁnition of addition ⊕for the rational numbers; because the
closure property for addition in the integers, Z1, holds; and because the clo-
sure property for multiplication in the integers, Z2, holds. In general, for
I = 1, 2, . . .11, property QI holds for the rational numbers, because the cor-
responding property ZI holds for the integers and because of the deﬁnitions
of addition and multiplication for the rational numbers. Hence, the set of
rational numbers with addition and multiplication deﬁned as above satisﬁes
all the properties which the integers satisfy—properties Z1 through Z11. The
rational numbers also satisfy the new property Q12. That is, every nonzero
rational number has a multiplicative inverse. Hence, the rational numbers are
closed under the operation of division with the exception of division by 0.
Let m
n be any rational number. By the deﬁnition of multiplication and the
cancellation law, for any nonzero integer p,
p
p ⊙m
n = p · m
p · n = m
n .
Thus, p
p = 1
1 in reduced form is the multiplicative identity for the rational
numbers. Of course, 1
1 is the rational number representation of the multi-
plicative identity 1 of the integers. Also, by the deﬁnition of addition, since
n · 0 = 0 for any integer n, by the existence of an additive identity property
for the integers, Z10, and by the cancellation law for rational numbers, we
have for any nonzero integer p,
m
n ⊕0
p = m · p + n · 0
n · p
= m · p + 0
n · p
= m · p
n · p = m
n .
Hence, 0
p = 0
1 in reduced form is the additive identity for the rational numbers.

Clearly, 0
1 is the rational number representation of the additive identity 0 of
the integers. The rational number (−m)

The commutative property of addition, Q3, the commutative property of mul-
tiplication, Q4, and the associative property of multiplication, Q6, follow eas-
ily from the deﬁnitions of ⊕and ⊙, the commutative properties of addition
and multiplication for the integers, and the associative property of multiplica-
tion for the integers. In the following two examples, we prove the associative
property of addition for the rational numbers, Q5, and the existence of a
multiplicative inverse property for the rational numbers, Q12.
Example 2.2.4.1 Prove the Associative Property of Addition for the Ratio-
nal Numbers. That is,
“Prove for every r, s, t ∈Q, r ⊕(s ⊕t) = (r ⊕s) ⊕t.”
Solution
Let r = m
n , s = p
q, and t = u
v where m, n, p, q, u, and v are integers and
n ̸= 0, p ̸= 0, and v ̸= 0. By the deﬁnition of addition for the rational numbers
and the distributive properties for integers,
r ⊕(s ⊕t) = m
n ⊕(p
q ⊕u
v ) = m
n ⊕(p · v + q · u
q · v
)
(1)
= m · (q · v) + n · (p · v + q · u)
n · (q · v)
= m · q · v + n · p · v + n · q · u
n · q · v
and
(r ⊕s) ⊕t = (m
n ⊕p
q ) ⊕u
v = m · q + n · p
n · q
⊕u
v
(2)
= (m · q + n · p) · v + (n · q) · u
(n · q) · v
= m · q · v + n · p · v + n · q · u
n · q · v
.
Because the right-hand sides of equations (1) and (2) are identical, for all
r, s, t ∈Q, r ⊕(s ⊕t) = (r ⊕s) ⊕t.

Example 2.2.4.2
Prove the existence of a Multiplicative Inverse Property
for the Set of Rational Numbers. That is,
“Prove for every nonzero rational number r there exists a rational number
r−1 such that r ⊙r−1 = 1
1.”
Solution
Let r = m
n be any nonzero rational number. Since r is a rational number,
n ̸= 0, and since r is nonzero, m ̸= 0. Consider the product
m
n ⊙n
m = m · n
n · m = n · m
n · m = 1
1.
Since r ⊙n
m = 1
1, r−1 = n
m is a multiplicative inverse of r.
■
Remarks: Just as each rational number does not have a unique representa-
tion, the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero rational number does not have a
unique representation, because for any nonzero integer p,
r−1 = n
m = n · p
m · p.
That is, for any nonzero integer p,
n · p
m · p is a multiplicative inverse of r = m
n .
If we require a multiplicative inverse of a nonzero rational number to be
represented in reduced form, then the multiplicative inverse has a unique
representation.
From their study of geometry, the ancient Greeks realized there were num-
bers which were not rational numbers.
Virtually nothing is known about
the date of the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers (numbers
which cannot be written as the ratio of two integers) or the identity of the in-
dividual who made the discovery. Nonetheless, sometime between the time of
Pythagoras (about 550 B.C.) and the time of Theodorus (about 400 B.C.) it
was determined that nonrational numbers existed. The proof of the following
theorem dates from between 550 B.C. and 400 B.C.
Theorem 2.17
There exist numbers which are not rational numbers.
Proof: Let c be the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with sides a =
b = 1. Since the triangle is a right triangle, by the Pythagorean theorem
(1)
c2 = a2 + b2 = 12 + 12 = 2.
Suppose c is a rational number which is written in reduced form. Speciﬁcally,
assume c = p/q where p and q ̸= 0 are integers and p and q have no common
factors. Squaring c and substituting into (1), we see p and q must satisfy the
equation
(2)
c2 =
p
q
2
= p2
q2 = 2.

104
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Multiplying the last equation by q2 ̸= 0 yields (3) p2 = 2q2. Hence, p2 is an
even integer, and it follows from Theorem 2.9 that p is an even integer. Thus,
p = 2r for some integer r. Substituting p = 2r into equation (3) and squaring,
we obtain
p2 = (2r)2 = 4r2 = 2q2.
Dividing the last equation by 2, we ﬁnd 2r2 = q2. Therefore, q2 is an even
integer which implies by Theorem 2.9 that q is an even integer. Thus, we have
shown p is an even integer and q is an even integer. Hence, 2 is a common
factor of p and q. Consequently, by contradiction, the number c which satisﬁes
the equation (1) c2 = 2 is not a rational number.

The irrational number which satisﬁes the equation c2 = 2 is denoted by

An axiomatic development of the set of real numbers from the set of ra-
tional numbers did not occur until the latter part of the nineteenth century.
In 1869, the French mathematician Hugues Charles Robert M´eray (1835–
1911) published the ﬁrst rigorous development of the set of real numbers. He
considered sequences of rational numbers and deﬁned convergence for such se-
quences. Some convergent sequences of rational numbers converged to rational
numbers, while others converged to “ﬁctitious” numbers (irrational numbers).
M´eray published his results in an obscure journal; consequently, his work went
unnoticed for several years. Two years after M´eray’s publication, two similar
developments of the real numbers from sequences of rational numbers were
published in two diﬀerent journals by two colleagues at the University of Halle
in Germany. In October 1871, Eduard Heinrich Heine (1821–1881) published
his article “The Elements of Function Theory” in the prestigious Journal of
Pure and Applied Mathematics. One month later, Georg Ferdinand Ludwig
Philipp Cantor (1845–1918) published his article “Extensions of Theorems
Regarding Trigonometric Series,” which included his development of the real
numbers, in the well-respected journal Annals of Mathematics.
Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind (1831–1916) was born in Braunschweig,
Germany, and lived there most of his life. He was the last doctoral student
of Gauss. To develop the set of real numbers, Dedekind began with the set of
rational numbers and their properties. Dedekind observed that each rational
number r divided the set of rational numbers into two nonempty sets—A1,
the set of all rational numbers less than r, and A2, the set of all rational
numbers greater than r.
The rational number r could be in either A1 or
A2 but not both. To indicate the relationship between the rational number
r and the division of the set of rational numbers into the sets A1 and A2,
Dedekind wrote r = cut(A1, A2).
On October 24, 1858, Dedekind noted
that every point on a line divides the line into two sets and that every such
division into two sets is produced by a unique point. To extend the set of
rational numbers to the set of real numbers, and to extend the properties of
the rational numbers to the set of real numbers, Dedekind divided the set

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
105
of rational numbers into two sets such that every element of A1 is less than
every element of A2 and he wrote cut(A1, A2) to represent this division. To
honor Dedekind, such cuts are now called Dedekind cuts. Some Dedekind
cuts are produced by rational numbers, while other cuts are produced by
numbers which are not rational. The latter cuts produced new numbers called
irrational numbers. For example, the cut in which the set A1 consists of all
rational numbers x less than a where a > 0 and a2 = 2 and in which the set
A2 consists of all rational numbers x greater that a where a > 0 and a2 = 2
deﬁnes the unique irrational number,
√
2. Later, in 1872, after Heine and
Cantor had published their developments of the real numbers from the rational
numbers, Dedekind published his results in an article titled “Continuity and
the Irrational Numbers.”
The numbers π and e are two other irrational numbers with which you may
be familiar already. The Welsh mathematician William Jones was the ﬁrst
to use the symbol π to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle
to its diameter in 1706. In 1737, Euler began using the symbol π for this
purpose and it soon became the standard notation. John Heinrich Lambert
(1728–1777) proved in 1761 that π is irrational. The symbol e represents the
value of the base of “natural logarithms.” Euler ﬁrst used this symbolism in a
letter he wrote to Goldbach in 1731. Also, credit is given to Euler for showing
that e is irrational.
The set of real numbers consists of the set of rational numbers together
with the set of irrational numbers. The real numbers satisfy properties Q1
through Q12. So the real numbers is our second example of a ﬁeld.
Earlier, we proved that
√
2 is irrational. Since
√
2 = 2
1
2 , there are rational
numbers x and y such that xy is an irrational number—namely, the numbers
x = 2 and y =

2.
Out of curiosity, we might want to know if there are
irrational numbers x and y such that xy is an rational number. The following
example answers this question in the aﬃrmative.

An axiom or postulate is a statement that is assumed to be true. The
axioms of a deductive mathematical system are the statements from which all
other statements of the system can be derived.
A theorem is a true statement that has been proven by a valid argument.
A proof is a logically valid deduction of a theorem from the premises of

A theorem which states that there is one and only one element in a speciﬁc
set which satisﬁes a certain statement is called a uniqueness theorem.
A corollary is a theorem which follows so obviously from the proof of

Subtraction Let S be a set of numbers and let m and n be elements of
S. The number x = m −n, read “m minus n” or “n subtracted from m,” is
the number x which makes the statement m = n + x true, if there is such a
number x.
An integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k.
An integer n is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.
Let a and b be natural numbers. The number a divides b if and only if
there exists a natural number c such that ac = b. If a divides b, then we also

A prime number (or simply a prime) is a natural number greater than

12. The Fano Plane The Fano plane is named in honor of the Italian
mathematician Gino Fano (1871–1952). He is considered to be the “Fa-
ther of Finite Geometry.” In 1892, Fano constructed a ﬁnite 3-dimension-
al geometry consisting of 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes. Each of the
15 planes is a Fano plane, which he described by an axiomatic system.
The undeﬁned terms in the axiomatic system are point, line, and on.
The ﬁve axioms of the system are
Axiom 1. There exists at least one line.
Axiom 2. There are exactly three points on every line.
Axiom 3. Not all points are on the same line.
Axiom 4. There is exactly one line on any two distinct points.
Axiom 5. There is at least one point on any two distinct lines.
Let us see what we can deduce from Fano’s Axioms. From Axioms 1,
2, and 3, we deduce that there are at least four points—three of which
we will name A, B, and C, and they lie on line ℓ1 and a fourth point D
which is not on line ℓ1. To aid in our discussion, we draw the sketch
shown in Figure 2.3a. By Axiom 4, the point D and each point A, B,
and C on line ℓ1 must determine a distinct line. By Axiom 2, each of

these three lines must contain exactly three points. However, none of
these points can be one of the four points A, B, C, or D, since this would
violate Axiom 4. Therefore, the Fano plane has at least seven points.
Hence, we have proven the following theorem about a Fano plane.
T1. The Fano plane has at least seven points. (See Figure 2.3b below.)

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
13. Statement. Theorem? Proof? Problems of this type will appear
throughout this text. A statement will be given. First, you should decide
if the statement is true or false. If the statement is true, it is a theorem
and you should then determine if the given proof is valid or invalid. If
the proof is valid, you are done.
If the proof is invalid, you should
produce a valid proof. If the statement is false, then, of course, the proof
must be invalid. However, we want to know what is wrong with the
proof, because this might allow us to modify the original false statement
and to create a new true statement (theorem). Then, perhaps, we can
modify the invalid proof to obtain a valid proof of the theorem.
a. Consider the statement: (1) For all x ∈R,
√
x2 = x.
Proof? Let x be any real number. Then
√
x2 = √x · x = √x·√x = x
by the deﬁnition of square root.
Is statement (1) true or false? Substitute some real numbers into
the equation
√
x2 = x. For x = 3, x2 = 9, and
√
9 = 3 = x. So
the equation
√
x2 = x is true for x = 3. For x = −3, x2 = (−3)(−3) =
9, and
√
9 = 3 ̸= −3. So when x = −3 statement (1) is false. That
is, statement (1) is false.
It appears that the equation
√
x2 = x is true only when x ≥0.
Hence, we should modify (1) by requiring x ≥0. Thus, we obtain the
true statement (and theorem)
(2) For all real numbers x ≥0,
√
x2 = x.
The proof? given above is invalid for statement (1), because when
x < 0, √x · x ̸= √x·√x. However, the proof? given above is valid for
statement (2), because √x · x = √x · √x when x ≥0.
Notice for x = −3 that
p
(−3) · (−3) =
√
9 = 3 while √−3·√−3 =
(
√
3)i · (
√
3)i = 3i2 = −3 = −x. What can we prove about
√
x2 for
x < 0? Our theorem should look like:
(3) For all real numbers x < 0,
√
x2 =
.
What goes in the blank in (3)?
b. Prove the completed theorem (3).
c. Combining the results of theorems (2) and (3), we obtain the following
theorem.
(4) For all real numbers,
√
x2 =
.
In Exercises 14 through 16 a statement and a proof? are given.
For each exercise do the following.
a. Determine if the given statement is true or false.
b. If the statement is a theorem, determine if the proof? is valid. If not,
correct the proof or construct a new, valid proof.

Deductive Mathematical Systems and Proofs
115
c. If the given statement is false, modify the statement to create a new
statement which is true and also give a valid proof of the new statement.
14. Statement. Theorem? Proof?
Statement: For all real numbers x, y, and z, if x < y, then x2 < y2.
Proof? Let x, y, and z be any real numbers and assume (1) x < y.
Multiplying (1) by x, we ﬁnd (2) x2 < xy. And multiplying (1) by y, we
get (3) xy < y2. It follows from (2) and (3) that x2 < xy < y2.
15. Statement. Theorem? Proof?
Statement: Let x be a positive real number.
The sum of x and its
reciprocal is greater than or equal to two.
Proof? Let x be any positive real number. The statement says:
(1) x + 1
x ≥2.
Multiplying (1) by x > 0, we obtain x2+1 ≥2x. Subtracting 2x, we ﬁnd
x2−2x+1 = (x−1)2 ≥0. Since the square of any real number is greater
than or equal to zero, equation (1) is true.
16. Statement. Theorem? Proof?
Statement: Let m be an integer. Then m is even ⇔m2 is even.
Proof? (⇒) Suppose m is an even integer. Then m = 2k for some integer
k. Therefore, m2 = (2k)2 = 4k2 = 2(2k2). Since 2k2 is an integer, m2 is
even. That is, if m is even, then m2 is even.
(⇐) Suppose m is an odd integer. Then m = 2ℓ+ 1 for some integer ℓ.
Hence, m2 = (2ℓ+ 1)2 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 = 2(2ℓ2 + 2ℓ) + 1. Since (2ℓ2 + 2ℓ)
is an integer, m2 is odd. Thus, if m is odd, then m2 is odd. And the
contrapositive is if m2 is even, then m is even.

Set Theory
In mathematics, it is often the case that there is a long period in which ideas
are conceived and developed by several diﬀerent individuals and then at a later
time a signiﬁcant breakthrough is made by more than one individual. Such
was the case with the development of calculus and non-Euclidean geometry.
However, on the contrary, set theory is primarily the creation of one individual,
Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (1845–1918). Cantor was born in
St. Petersburg, Russia.
His father, Georg Waldemar Cantor, was born in
Copenhagen, but moved to St. Petersburg as a young man. Cantor’s mother,
Maria Anna B¨ohm, was Russian. In 1856, when young Georg was eleven years
old, the family, consisting of Georg, a brother, a sister, and his parents, moved
to Wiesbaden, Germany, and later to Frankfurt due to the poor health of his
father. Georg’s father wanted him to become an engineer, so he could make
a good living. After receiving the proper technical training in high school
at Darmstadt from 1860 to 1862, Georg entered the Polytechnic of Zurich
in the fall of 1862. Later in 1862, Georg requested his father’s permission
to study mathematics instead of engineering and his father consented. After
his father’s death in June 1863, Georg transfered to the University of Berlin,
where he completed his doctorate in December 1867. In the spring of 1869,
Cantor joined the faculty at the University of Halle as a lecturer. In 1872,
he was promoted to assistant professor and in 1879 to professor.
Cantor
spent the remainder of his life in Halle.
Cantor’s early publications were
in the area of number theory.
However, Heinrich Eduard Heine, a senior
colleague of Cantor at Halle, challenged Cantor to prove that a function can
be represented uniquely as a trigonometric series. Cantor succeeded in doing
so in 1870.
In 1872, Cantor published a paper on trigonometric series in
which he deﬁned the irrational numbers in terms of convergent sequences of
rational numbers. Then Cantor began his lifelong work on set theory and
the concept of transﬁnite numbers. In 1873, he proved the rational numbers
are countable—that is, that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
rational numbers and the natural numbers. In 1874, Cantor showed that the
real numbers are not countable. After Cantor initiated research in the area of
set theory, others made signiﬁcant contributions. Conjectures which Cantor
made opened fertile areas of research for others and the paradoxes which
arose later because of his work resulted in important study with respect to
the foundations of mathematics.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
3.1
Sets and Subsets
The concept of a set is fundamental to the study of mathematics. Using
set notation in mathematics promotes precision and clarity in communicating
mathematical ideas. The theory of sets also provides a means of simplifying
and unifying a large number of subdisciplines of mathematics.
In the late nineteenth century, Cantor deﬁned the term “set.” This deﬁni-
tion led to a paradox known as Russell’s paradox. Giving a formal deﬁnition
of a set ultimately leads to circularity of deﬁnition, since a set probably would
be deﬁned as a “collection,” a collection would be deﬁned as an “aggregate,”
and so forth until we eventually circle back to the word “collection” or “ag-
gregate.” The modern method of developing mathematical theories such as
the theory of sets is the axiomatic approach. In this approach to set theory,
the terms “set” and “is an element of” are undeﬁned terms—just as “lines,”
“points,” and “intersects” are undeﬁned terms in geometry.
Intuitively, a
set consists of objects called elements or members. Furthermore, a set is
well-deﬁned—that is, given a speciﬁc object, it is possible to determine if the
object belongs to a given set or not. We will use the notation “x ∈A” to
denote that “x is an element of the set A,” “x is a member of A,” or, sim-
ply, “x is in A.” To indicate “x is not an element of the set A,” we write
symbolically “x /∈A.” Usually sets are described in roster notation, in
which the elements of the set are enclosed in curly braces, { }, and separated
by commas, or in set-builder notation, in which the set is speciﬁed in the
form {x | P(x)}, which is read “the set of all x such that P(x) is true.” For
example, “the set of all natural numbers less than 6” is speciﬁed in roster
notation as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and in set-builder notation as {x | x ∈N and x < 6}.
There is one and only one set which has no elements. It is called the empty
set or null set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol ∅. The following is
a formal deﬁnition of the empty set.
The empty set is the set ∅= {x | x ̸= x}.
Let P(x) denote the statement “x ̸= x.” Since for all possible objects x, the
statement P(x) is false, the set denoted by the symbol ∅contains no elements.
Consider the sets X = {a, 1, $} and Y = {1, 2, a, b, $}. Notice that all of
the elements of X—namely, a, 1, and $—are all elements of Y . To indicate
that all elements of X are elements of Y , we say “X is a subset of Y ” and
symbolically we write X ⊆Y . We could also write Y ⊇X which is read “Y
is a superset of X.” The symbolism Y ⊇X has the same meaning as the
symbolism X ⊆Y . The formal deﬁnition of a subset follows.
Let A and B be sets. A is a subset of B, written A ⊆B, if and only if
every element of A is an element of B. Symbolically,
A ⊆B ⇔(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈B)].

Set Theory
119
To indicate “A is not a subset of B” we write A ̸⊆B or B ̸⊇A. We now
prove that every set is a subset of itself.
Theorem 3.1
For any set A, A ⊆A.
Proof: Let x ∈A. Since (x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈A) is a true statement, we have
(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈A)] is true, and therefore, by the deﬁnition of subset,
A ⊆A.
■
Also, we can prove that the empty set is a subset of all sets.
Theorem 3.2
For any set A, ∅⊆A.
Proof: Let A be any set and let x be any object. We consider the conditional
statement (∀x)[(x ∈∅) ⇒(x ∈A)]. Since for all objects x the hypothesis of
the conditional statement, x ∈∅, is false, the implication (x ∈∅) ⇒(x ∈A)
is true. Therefore, by the deﬁnition of subset, ∅⊆A.
■
Subsets satisfy the following transitivity property.
Theorem 3.3
Let A, B, and C be sets. If A ⊆B and B ⊆C, then A ⊆C.
Proof: Let x ∈A. By hypothesis A ⊆B, so
(1)
(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈B).
Also by hypothesis B ⊆C, so
(2)
(x ∈B) ⇒(x ∈C).
From (1) and (2) by the rule of transitive inference,
(3)
(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈C)].
Hence, A ⊆C.
■
Intuitively, we want two sets A and B to be equal, written “A = B,” if
and only if they are identical sets—that is, if and only if they have exactly
the same elements. Thus, we could deﬁne equality as follows:
A = B ⇔(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇔(x ∈B)].
However, since (∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇔(x ∈B)] is logically equivalent to
(∀x)[[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈B)] ∧[(x ∈B) ⇒(x ∈A)]]
which is logically equivalent to
[(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈B)]] ∧[(∀x)[(x ∈B) ⇒(x ∈A)]]
which is A ⊆B and B ⊆A, we deﬁne equality of sets as follows.
Let A and B be sets. Then A = B ⇔[(A ⊆B) ∧(B ⊆A)].
This deﬁnition of equality permits us to prove two sets A and B are equal
(identical) by showing (i) A is a subset of B and (ii) B is a subset of A. As an
example, let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 1, 2, 2, 1}. First, consider the elements
of A. The element 1 ∈A and we see 1 ∈B also. The elements 2, 3 ∈A and
they are members of the set B also. Since every element in the set A is in the
set B, A ⊆B. Now consider the elements in the set B. The element 3 ∈B,
and we ﬁnd 3 ∈A as well. The elements 1, 2 ∈B and they are elements of A
too. Hence, B ⊆A. Since A ⊆B and B ⊆A, A = B.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Example 3.1.1
Prove A = B given that A = {n | n ∈Z and |n| < 2} and
B = {x | x ∈R and x3 −x = 0}.
Solution
(i) Let n ∈A. Since n is an integer and |n| < 2, n is −1, 0, or 1. Substitut-
ing x = −1 into the expression x3 −x, we ﬁnd (−1)3 −(−1) = −1 + 1 = 0,
so −1 ∈B. Substituting, x = 0 into x3 −x, we see (0)3 −(0) = 0 −0 = 0, so
0 ∈B. And substituting x = 1 into x3 −x, yields (1)3 −(1) = 1 −1 = 0, so
1 ∈B. Hence, A ⊆B.
(ii) Let x ∈B. Factoring yields
x3 −x = x(x2 −1) = x(x −1)(x + 1) = 0.
Consequently, the elements of the set B are the integers 0, 1, and −1. Since
|0| = 0 < 2,
0 ∈A; since |1| = 1 < 2,
1 ∈A; and since | −1| = 1 < 2,
−1 ∈A. Hence, B ⊆A.
By (i) A ⊆B and by (ii) B ⊆A; therefore, A = B.
■
The set A is a proper subset of the set B, written A ⊂B, if and only if
A is a subset of B and A ̸= B. Symbolically,
A ⊂B ⇔[(A ⊆B) ∧(A ̸= B)].
Clearly, A is a proper subset of B provided every element of A is an element
of B and there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of
A. Since the natural numbers, N, are a proper subset of the integers, Z, are
a proper subset of the rational numbers, Q, are a proper subset of the real
numbers, R, we can write N ⊂Z ⊂Q ⊂R.
In 1880, the British logician John Venn (1834–1923) published an article
titled “On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions
and Reasonings.” In this paper, Venn introduced his diagrams for illustrating
syllogistic logic.
Venn did not conceive of the idea of representing logical
arguments by diagrams—Gottfried Leibniz, to name one person, had used
diagrams for this purpose approximately 200 years earlier. Nonetheless, Venn
was dissatisﬁed with the diagrams being used by his contemporary logicians
George Boole and Augustus De Morgan, so he devised his own diagrams,
which are now called Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram for A = B is shown
in Figure 3.1 and a Venn diagram for A ⊂B is shown in Figure 3.2. If A ⊆B,
it is necessary to consider both possibilities displayed in Figures 3.1 and 3.2.

Example 3.1.2 List all subsets of the following sets.
a.
∅
b.
{1}
c.
{a, b}
d.
{x, y, z}
Solution
a. The only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself—that is, ∅⊆∅.
b. The two subsets of the set {1} are ∅and {1}.
c. The four subsets of the set {a, b} are ∅, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}.
d. The eight subsets of the set {x, y, z} are the sets ∅, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y},
{x, z}, {y, z}, and {x, y, z}.
■
In Example 3.1.2, observe that the number of subsets of the set with no
elements—the empty set, ∅—is 20 = 1; the number of subsets of a set with
one element is 21 = 2; the number of subsets of a set with two elements is
22 = 4; and the number of subsets of a set with three elements is 23 = 8. Let
A = {a1, a2, . . ., an} be a set with n ≥1 elements. In creating a subset X
of A there are n decisions to be made—namely, whether ai ∈X or ai /∈X
for i = 1, 2, . . ., n. Since there are n decisions to be made and two possible
choices for each decision, there is a total of 2n possible subsets X of A.
The set of all subsets of a ﬁnite set A is denoted by P(A) and is called the
power set of A. The name power set comes from the fact that if the set A has
n elements, then its power set P(A) has 2n elements. From Example 3.1.2, it
is clear that P(∅) = {∅}, P({1}) = {∅, {1}}, P({a, b}) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a,b}},

Set Operations
Usually, at the beginning of a particular discussion a set called the universe
is speciﬁed. The universe is selected in such a way that it contains all elements
of all sets to be discussed. We will denote the universe by U. The universe
need not be the same set for all discussions. For instance, in one discussion
the universe might be the set of integers, in another discussion the universe
might be the set of all triangles, or the set of points in the plane, etc. There
are several elementary operations which may be performed on sets. In this
section, we will examine two binary operations (operations involving two sets)
and one unary operation (an operation involving a single set).
Let A and B be two subsets of the universe U. The set A union B is the
subset of U which contains all elements that belong either to A or to B or to
both A and B. The set A union B is denoted by A ∪B, which is read “A
union B.” Symbolically,
A ∪B = {x | x ∈A or x ∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B)}.
For example, if the universe is the set of natural numbers, A = {1, 3, 5, 7},
and B = {2, 4, 6}, then A∪B = {1, 2, 3, 4,5,6, 7}. Notice that A ⊂N, B ⊂N,
and A ∪B ⊂N = U. The British logician Charles Dodgson (1832–1898)

124
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
improved upon Venn diagrams by employing a circumscribed rectangle to
represent the universal set. Dodgson was a distinguished mathematician and
wrote three mathematical texts; however, he is probably best known under his
pen name, Lewis Carroll. Under that name he published two popular books,
Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The shaded
areas shown in Figure 3.3 represent the set A ∪B for the three diﬀerent Venn
diagrams.

Three Venn diagrams for A ∪B.
Let A and B be two subsets of the universe U. The set A intersect B
is the subset of U which contains all elements that belong to both A and B.
The set A intersect B is denoted by A ∩B, which is read “A intersect B.”
Symbolically,
A ∩B = {x | x ∈A and x ∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B)}.
For example, if the universe is the set of integers, A = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2},
and B = {−4, −2, 0, 2}, then A ∩B = {−2, 0, 2}. The shaded areas shown in
Figure 3.4 depict the set A ∩B for the three diﬀerent Venn diagrams. When
A∩B = ∅, the sets A and B are said to be disjoint. Notice in the center Venn
diagram of Figure 3.4 that A ∩B = ∅. This diagram is the typical diagram
for two disjoint sets.

It follows from the deﬁnition of union that x /∈(A ∪B) is equivalent to
(1)
¬[x ∈(A∪B)] ≡¬[(x ∈A)∨(x ∈b)] ≡[¬(x ∈A)]∧[¬(x ∈B)]
by a De Morgan law. Since ¬(x ∈A) ≡x /∈A and since ¬(x ∈B) ≡x /∈B, it
follows from (1) that x /∈(A ∪B) is logically equivalent to (x /∈A) ∧(x /∈B).
Likewise, x /∈(A ∩B) is logically equivalent to (x /∈A) ∨(x /∈B).

Set Theory
125
The complement of the set A, written A′, is the set of all elements in the
universe, U, which are not in the set A. Hence,
A′ = {x | x ∈U and x /∈A} = {x | (x ∈U) ∧(x /∈A)}.
For example, if the universe U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {2, 4}, then A′ =
{1, 3, 5}. A Venn diagram for a set A and its complement A′ is shown in
Figure 3.5.

Example 3.2.1
Let U = {1, a, 2, b, #, @}, A = {a, b, #}, B = {1, a, 2, #},
and C = {2, #, @}. Find the following sets.
a. A′
b. (A′)′
c. A ∪A′
d. A ∩A′
e. A ∪B
f. B ∪A
g. (A ∩B) ∩C
h. A ∩(B ∩C)
i. A ∪(B ∩C)
j. (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C)
k. (A ∪B)′
l. A′ ∩B′
What do you notice about the answers for the pairs e and f, g and h, i and j,
and k and l?
Solution
a. By deﬁnition A′ is the set of elements in the universe U which are not in
the set A. Deleting the elements of the set A from the set U, we ﬁnd
A′ = {1, 2, @}.
b. By deﬁnition (A′)′ is the set of elements in U which are not in the set A′.
Deleting from U the elements of the set A′, which we found in part a, we
see
(A′)′ = {a, b, #} = A.
In this example, we observe that the complement of the complement of the
set A is the set A.
c. From the deﬁnition of A and the computation of the set A′ performed in
part a, we obtain
A ∪A′ = {a, b, #, 1,2, @} = U.
In this instance, we notice A ∪A′ = U.
d. From the deﬁnition of A and the result of part a,
A ∩A′ = {a, b, #} ∩{1, 2, @} = ∅.
Thus, A and A′ are disjoint.
e. A ∪B = {a, b, #} ∪{1, a, 2, #} = {a, b, #, 1,2}.
f. B ∪A = {1, a, 2, #}∪{a, b, #} = {1, a, 2, #,b}.

126
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
g. To calculate (A∩B)∩C, we calculate A∩B ﬁrst (because of the placement
of the parentheses) and then we calculate the intersection of the sets
A ∩B and C.
A ∩B = {a, b, #} ∩{1, a, 2, #} = {a, #}
and
(A ∩B) ∩C = {a, #} ∩{2, #, @} = {#}.
h. To calculate A ∩(B ∩C), we calculate B ∩C ﬁrst (because of the
placement of the parentheses) and then we calculate the intersection of the
sets A and B ∩C.
B ∩C = {1, a, 2, #} ∩{2, #, @} = {2, #}
and
A ∩(B ∩C) = {a, b, #} ∩{2, #} = {#}.
i. From part h, B ∩C = {2, #}, so
A ∪(B ∩C) = {a, b, #} ∪{2, #} = {a, b, #, 2}.
j. From part e, A ∪B = {a, b, #, 1,2} and from the deﬁnitions of sets A and
C,
A ∪C = {a, b, #} ∪{2, #, @} = {a, b, #, 2, @}.
The intersection of the sets (A ∪B) and (A ∪C) is
(A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C) = {a, b, #, 1, 2}∩{a, b, #, 2,@} = {a, b, #, 2}.
k. From part e, A ∪B = {a, b, #, 1, 2}. Deleting the elements of A ∪B from
U, we ﬁnd (A ∪B)′ = {@}.
l. From part a, A′ = {1, 2, @} and calculating the complement of B, we ﬁnd
B′ = {b, @}. So
A′ ∩B′ = {1, 2, @} ∩{b, @} = {@}.
The answers for the pairs e and f, g and h, i and j, and k and l are equal.
That is, for this example, A ∪B = B ∪A, (A ∩B) ∩C = A ∩(B ∩C),
A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C), and (A ∪B)′ = A′ ∩B′.
■
From Example 3.2.1, it appears the operator ∪may be a commutative
operator—that is, for all subsets A and B of a universe U, it may be true that
A ∪B = B ∪A. Hence, we formulate the following theorem and then prove
it.
Theorem 3.4
Let A and B be subsets of the universal set U.
Then
A ∪B = B ∪A.
Proof: Let x ∈U.
x ∈A ∪B ⇔(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B)
Deﬁnition of A ∪B
⇔(x ∈B) ∨(x ∈A)
Commutative law of disjunction
⇔x ∈B ∪A
Deﬁnition of B ∪A
Thus, (∀x ∈U)[(x ∈(A ∪B)) ⇔(x ∈(B ∪A))]. Hence, A ∪B = B ∪A. ■

Set Theory
127
An equation, expression, or statement in set theory which is obtained by
interchanging ∪and ∩and interchanging the sets ∅and U is called the dual
of the equation, expression, or statement accordingly. Hence, the dual of the
statement A ∪B = B ∪A is the statement A ∩B = B ∩A. Likewise, the
dual of the statement A ∪∅= A is the statement A ∩U = A. The principle
of duality for set theory says “If T is a theorem which is written in terms
of ∪, ∩, and ′, then the dual statement T D is also a theorem.” Since we have
proven A ∪B = B ∪A is a theorem of set theory, by the principle of duality,
A ∩B = B ∩A is a theorem of set theory also. Using the principle of duality,
by proving one theorem, we have proven two theorems.
The algebra of sets consists of a collection A of subsets ∅, U, A, B, C, . . .
of some universe U. (Notice that ∅and U must both be members of the
collection A.) On the collection A there is deﬁned two relations, ⊆and =;
two binary operations, ∪and ∩; and one unary operation ′. The collection A
also has the properties that if A and B are arbitrary sets of A, then A∪B ∈A,
A ∩B ∈A, and A′ ∈A. For A an algebra of sets, the following statements
and their duals are theorems.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The algebra of sets is another example of a mathematical system. Notice
the similarity between the theorems (laws) of the algebra of sets and the
theorems of mathematical logic when ∪is associated with ∨, ∩is associated
with ∧, and ′ is associated with ¬. We now prove a few of the theorems stated
above and leave the remainder to be proven as exercises.
Example 3.2.2 Prove the idempotent law: A ∪A = A.
Proof: Let A be a subset in the algebra of sets A with universe U and let
x ∈U.
x ∈A ∪A ⇔(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈A)
Deﬁnition of A ∪A
⇔(x ∈A)
Idempotent law of disjunction
Hence, A∪A = A and by the principle of duality the dual statement A∩A = A
is a theorem also.
■
Example 3.2.3 Prove the identity law: A ∩∅= ∅.
Proof: Let A be any subset in the algebra of sets A and let x ∈U, the
universal set.
x ∈A ∩∅⇔(x ∈A) ∧(x ∈∅)
Deﬁnition of A ∩∅
⇔(x ∈A) ∧f
x ∈∅is a contradiction
⇔f
Contradiction law of logic
This sequence of statements shows that the set A∩∅has no elements. Hence,
A ∩∅= ∅and by the principle of duality the dual statement A ∪U = U is a
theorem as well.
■
Example 3.2.4 Prove the complement law: A ∪A′ = U.
Proof: Let A be a subset in the algebra of sets A and let x ∈U, the universal
set.
x ∈A ∪A′
⇔(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈A′)
Deﬁnition of A ∪A′
⇔(x ∈A) ∨[(x ∈U) ∧(x /∈A)]
Deﬁnition of complement
⇔[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈U)] ∧[(x ∈A) ∨(x /∈A)]
A De Morgan law of logic
⇔[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈U)] ∧[(x ∈A) ∨(¬(x ∈A))]
Deﬁnition of /∈
⇔[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈U)] ∧t
P ∨(¬P) is a tautology
⇔[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈U)]
A tautology law
⇔x ∈A ∪U
Deﬁnition of A ∪U
Thus, A ∪A′ = A ∪U. Moreover, by the identity law 3, A ∪U = U, so
A ∪A′ = A ∪U = U.
In addition, by the principle of duality the dual
statement A′ ∩A = ∅is a theorem.

Example 3.2.5 Prove the distributive law: A∪(B ∩C) = (A∪B)∩(A∪C).
Proof: Let A, B, C ⊆U and let x ∈U.
x ∈A ∪(B ∩C)
⇔(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈(B ∩C))
Deﬁnition of union
⇔(x ∈A) ∨[(x ∈B) ∧(x ∈C)]
Deﬁnition of intersection
⇔[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B)] ∧[(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈C)]
A distributive law of logic
⇔[x ∈(A ∪B)] ∧[x ∈(A ∪C)]
Deﬁnition of union
⇔x ∈(A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C)
Deﬁnition of intersection
Hence, A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C) and by duality A ∩(B ∪C) =
(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C)
■
Example 3.2.6 Prove the De Morgan law
(A ∩B)′ = A′ ∪B′.
Proof: Let A, B ⊆U and let x ∈U.
x ∈(A ∩B)′
⇔(x ∈U) ∧(x /∈(A ∩B))
Deﬁnition of complement
⇔(x ∈U) ∧[¬(x ∈(A ∩B))]
Deﬁnition of /∈
⇔(x ∈U) ∧[¬((x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B))]
Deﬁnition of intersection
⇔(x ∈U) ∧[(¬(x ∈A)) ∨(¬(x ∈B))]
A De Morgan law of logic
⇔(x ∈U) ∧[(x /∈A)) ∨(x /∈B)]
Deﬁnition of /∈
⇔[(x ∈U) ∧(x /∈A)] ∨[(x ∈U) ∧(x /∈B)]
A distributive law of logic
⇔(x ∈A′) ∨(x ∈B′)
Deﬁnition of A′ and B′
⇔x ∈A′ ∪B′
Deﬁnition of A′ ∪B′
Hence, (A ∩B)′ = A′ ∪B′ and by duality (A ∪B)′ = A′ ∩B′.

3.3
Additional Set Operations
In this section, we discuss two more binary operations—the diﬀerence of
two sets and the Cartesian product of two sets.
Let A and B be two subsets of the universe U. The set diﬀerence of A
and B, written A−B and read “A minus B,” is the set of all elements in the
set A that are not in the set B. Symbolically,
A −B = {x | x ∈A and x /∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∧(x /∈B)}.
For example, if the universe is the set of natural numbers, A = {3, 5, 7, 8},
and B = {1, 3, 7, 9}, then A −B = {5, 8} and B −A = {1, 9}. Observe that
in this example, A −B ̸= B −A. Hence, the operator −is not commutative.
In addition, let C = {5, 9}. Then (A −B) −C = {5, 8} −{5, 9} = {8}.
Furthermore, since B −C = {1, 3, 7}, A −(B −C) = {3, 5, 7, 8}−{1, 3, 7} =
{5, 8}. Thus, for this example, (A−B)−C ̸= A−(B−C). Thus, the operator
−is not an associative operator.
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the complement of the set A,
A′ = {x | x ∈U and x /∈A}, and the deﬁnition of U minus A,

Example 3.3.1
Let U = {3, 5, π, e, i, µ}, A = {3, π, i}, B = {5, π, e}, and
C = {i, µ}. Write the following sets using roster notation.
a. A −B
b. A ∩B′
c. (A −B) −C
d. A −(B ∪C)
e. A −C
f. A −(A ∩C)
g. (A ∩B) −C
h. A ∩(B −C)
What do you notice about the answers for pairs a and b, c and d, e and f,
and g and h?
Solution
a. A −B = {3, π, i} −{5, π, e} = {3, i}.
b. Since B′ = U −B = {3, 5, π, e, i, µ} −{5, π, e} = {3, i, µ}
and A ∩B′ = {3, π, i} ∩{3, i, µ} = {3, i}.
Thus, from parts a and b it follows that for the given sets U, A, and B
that A −B = A ∩B′.
c. From part a A −B = {3, i}, so (A −B) −C = {3, i} −{i, µ} = {3}.
d. B ∪C = {5, π, e} ∪{i, µ} = {5, π, e, i, µ}.
So A −(B ∪C) = {3, π, i} −{5, π, e, i, µ} = {3}.
Hence, from parts c and d for the given sets A, B, and C, we have that
(A −B) −C = A −(B ∪C).
e. A −C = {3, π, i} −{i, µ} = {3, π}.
f. A ∩C = {3, π, i}∩{i, µ} = {i}, so A −(A ∩C) = {3, π, i}−{i} = {3, π}.
Thus, from e and f for the given sets A and C, it follows that
A −C = A −(A ∩C).
g. Since A∩B = {3, π, i}∩{5, π, e} = {π}, (A∩B)−C = {π}−{i, µ} = {π}.
h. Because B −C = {5, π, e} −{i, µ} = {5, π, e},
A ∩(B −C) = {3, π, i} ∩{5, π, e} = {π}.
Therefore, it follows from parts g and h that for the speciﬁed sets A,
B, and C, (A ∩B) −C = A ∩(B −C).
■
From Example 3.3.1, parts a and b, we conjecture that for A and B subsets
of some universe U, it is true that A−B = A∩B′. This leads us to state and
prove the following theorem.

Set Theory
133
Theorem 3.5
Let A and B be subsets of the universal set U.
Then
A −B = A ∩B′.
Proof: Let x ∈U.
x ∈A ∩B′ ⇔(x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B′)
Deﬁnition of A ∩B′
⇔(x ∈A) ∧[(x ∈U) ∧(x /∈B)] Deﬁnition of B′
⇔[(x ∈A) ∧(x ∈U)] ∧(x /∈B) Associative law of conjunction
⇔[x ∈(A ∩U)] ∧(x /∈B)
Deﬁnition of A ∩U
⇔(x ∈A) ∧(x /∈B)
Substitution A ∩U = A
⇔x ∈A −B
Deﬁnition of A −B
Thus, (∀x ∈U)[(x ∈(A ∩B′)) ⇔(x ∈(A −B))]. Hence, A −B = A ∩B′.
■
Theorem 3.5 shows how to write the set A −B in terms of set intersection
and set complementation. Thus, to prove theorems which involve the diﬀer-
ence of two sets, we may write the diﬀerence of sets in terms of set intersection
and complementation and then use the algebra of sets to prove the desired
result. The proof of Theorem 3.6 illustrates this technique of proof.
Theorem 3.6
Let A and B be subsets of the universal set U.
Then
A −B = A −(A ∩B).
Proof:
A −(A ∩B) = A ∩(A ∩B)′
By Theorem 3.5
= A ∩(A′ ∪B′)
De Morgan law 10D
= (A ∩A′) ∪(A ∩B′)

As we noted earlier, the set {a, b} is equal to the set {b, a}, and it is im-
material which way we choose to write the set. However, the order in which
elements appear and events occur is sometimes very important. Therefore,
entities must be deﬁned for which the order of occurrence of the elements is
signiﬁcant.
By an ordered pair we mean an entity consisting of two elements in a
speciﬁc order. We denote the ordered pair with a as ﬁrst element and b as
second element by (a, b).
In 1921, the Polish mathematician Kazimieri Kuratowski (1896–1980) gave
the following set theoretic deﬁnition of the ordered pair (a, b):
(a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}}.
Using this deﬁnition, the following basic theorem regarding the equality of
ordered pairs can be proved. (See Exercise 21 of this section.)
Theorem 3.7
The ordered pair (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and
b = d.

134
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
By Theorem 3.7, the ordered pair (2, −3) ̸= (2, 4) because −3 ̸= 4, the
ordered pair (1, 5) ̸= (−2, 5) because 1 ̸= −2, and the ordered pair (3, 6) ̸=
(6, 3) because 3 ̸= 6.
Generalizing the concept of an ordered pair, we deﬁne an ordered triple to
be an entity consisting of three elements in a speciﬁc order such as (a, b, c) in
which a is the ﬁrst element, b is the second element, and c is the third element.
Two ordered triples (a, b, c) and (x, y, z) are equal if and only if a = x and
b = y and c = z. For a natural number n ≥2, an ordered n-tuple is denoted
by (a1, a2, . . ., an) and (a1, a2, . . ., an) = (b1, b2, . . ., bn) if and only if ai = bi
for i = 1, 2, . . ., n.
Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, written as
A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈A and b ∈B. That
is,
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈A and b ∈B}.
The symbolism A × B is read “the Cartesian product of A and B” or often
simply as “A cross B.”
The Cartesian product is named in honor of the
French philosopher and mathematician Ren´e Descartes (1596–1650). In the
process of developing analytic geometry, the synthesis of algebra and geom-
etry, Descartes invented the Cartesian product and the Cartesian coordinate
system. If (a, b) ∈A×B, then it must be true that a ∈A and b ∈B, whereas,
if (a, b) /∈A × B, then either a /∈A or b /∈B.
As an example, let A = {1, a, #} and B = {$, @}; then
A × B = {(1, $), (1, @), (a, $), (a,@), (#,$),(#, @)}
and
B × A = {($, 1), ($, a), ($, #), (@, 1),(@, a), (@, #)}.
As this example illustrates, in general, A×B ̸= B ×A. That is, the Cartesian
product is not commutative.
Let A be a ﬁnite set with m elements and let B be a ﬁnite set with n
elements; then the Cartesian products A×B and B×A both have mn elements
which are ordered pairs. To visualize the Cartesian product A × B we draw a
graph. First, we draw a horizontal line, choose m arbitrary points on the line,
and label the points with the elements in set A. Next, we draw a vertical line,
choose n arbitrary points on this line, and label these points with the elements
in set B. Through each point on the horizontal line chosen to represent an
element of A, we draw a vertical line, and through each point on the vertical
line chosen to represent an element of B, we draw a horizontal line. The
m vertical lines intersect the n horizontal lines in mn points. These points
represent the mn ordered pairs of the set A × B.
A graph of A × B for
A = {1, a, #} and B = {$, @} is displayed in Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.7:

Now let A = {a}, B = {b}, and C = {c}. Then
A × (B × C) = {a} × ({b} × {c}) = {a} × {(b, c)} = {(a, (b, c))}
and
(A × B) × C = ({a} × {b}) × {c} = {(a, b)} × {c} = {((a, b), c)}.
Consequently, in general, A × (B × C) ̸= (A × B) × C. That is, the Cartesian
product is not associative. The Cartesian product of three nonempty sets A,
B, and C is deﬁned as
A × B × C = {(a, b, c) | a ∈A and b ∈B and c ∈C}.
Thus, the Cartesian product of three nonempty sets A, B, and C is a set of
ordered triples.
The following theorem states a relationship between the Cartesian product
and the empty set.
Theorem 3.8
A × B = ∅if and only if A = ∅or B = ∅.
Proof: We will prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive: A ̸= ∅and
B ̸= ∅if and only if A × B ̸= ∅.
First, we assume A ̸= ∅and B ̸= ∅. Thus, there exists an a ∈A and there
exists a b ∈B. Hence, (a, b) ∈A × B and, consequently, A × B ̸= ∅.
Next, we assume A × B ̸= ∅. Thus, there exists an (a, b) ∈A × B, which
implies there exists an a ∈A and there exists a b ∈B. Therefore, A ̸= ∅and
B ̸= ∅.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The following example illustrates combining the Cartesian product opera-
tion with the operations of union and complementation.
Example 3.3.2 Let A = {1}, B = {2, 3}, C = {1, 2}, and D = {3}. Write
the following sets using roster notation.
a. A × (B ∪C)
b. (A × B) ∪(A × C)
c. A × (B −C)
d. (A × B) −(A × C)
e. (A × B) ∪(C × D)
f. (A ∪C) × (B ∪D)
What do you observe about the answers for pairs a and b, c and d, and e and
f?
Solution
a. A×(B∪C) = {1}×({2, 3}∪{1, 2}) = {1}×{2, 3, 1} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1,1)}
b. (A × B) ∪(A × C) = ({1} × {2, 3}) ∪({1} × {1, 2})
= {(1, 2), (1, 3)}∪{(1, 1), (1, 2)}
= {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1,1)}
From parts a and b we see that A × (B ∪C) = (A × B) ∪(A × C) for
the given sets A, B, and C.
c. A × (B −C) = {1} × {3} = {(1, 3)}
d. (A × B) −(A × C) = ({1} × {2, 3}) −({1} × {1, 2})
= {(1, 2), (1, 3)}−{(1, 1), (1, 2)} = {(1, 3)}
It follows from parts c and d that A × (B −C) = (A × B) −(A × C)
for the given sets A, B, and C.
e. (A × B) ∪(C × D) = ({1} × {2, 3}) ∪({1, 2} × {3})
= {(1, 2), (1, 3)}∪{(1, 3), (2, 3)}
= {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2,3)}
f. (A ∪C) × (B ∪D) = ({1} ∪{1, 2}) × ({2, 3} ∪{3})
= {1, 2} × {2, 3} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2,2),(2, 3)}
From parts e and f it follows that for the speciﬁed sets A, B, C, and
D, (A × B) ∪(A × C) ⊂(A ∪C) × (B ∪D).
■
From parts a and b of Example 3.3.2, we conjecture that for any sets A, B,
and C it is true that A × (B ∪C) = (A × B) ∪(A × C). Hence, we formally
state and prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.9
For sets A, B, and C, A × (B ∪C) = (A × B) ∪(A × C).
Proof:
(a, d) ∈[A × (B ∪C)]
⇔[(a ∈A) ∧(d ∈(B ∪C))]
Def. of Cartesian product
⇔[(a ∈A) ∧[(d ∈B) ∨(d ∈C)]]
Deﬁnition of union
⇔[(a ∈A) ∧(d ∈B)] ∨[(a ∈A) ∧(d ∈C)]
Distributive law of conjunction
⇔[(a, d) ∈(A × B)] ∨[(a, d) ∈(A × C)]
Def. of Cartesian product
⇔(a, d) ∈[(A × B) ∪(A × C)]
Deﬁnition of union ■
Theorem 3.9 states that the Cartesian product distributes over union.

You are undoubtedly familiar with the geometric representation of the set
of real numbers by the “real number line.” The real number line is usually
drawn as a horizontal straight line. A point is selected to represent 0 and a
second, distinct point to the right of 0 is selected to represent 1. The choice
of the locations of 0 and 1 determine the scale on the number line. It follows
from the axioms of Euclidean geometry that to each point on the line there
corresponds one and only one real number and, conversely, to each real number
there corresponds one and only one point on the line. For x, y ∈R, if x < y,
then the point corresponding to x lies to the left of the point corresponding to
y. Positive real numbers correspond to points to the right of 0 and negative
real numbers correspond to points to the left of 0. If a, b, x ∈R and a < b,
then x satisﬁes the inequality a < x < b if and only if x corresponds to a point
“between” the points corresponding to a and b. A graph of the real number
line is displayed in Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.8:
The set of real numbers represented geometrically on a line.
We can deﬁne subsets of the real numbers which are intervals using inequal-
ities as follows: Let a, b ∈R and let a < b.
The open interval (a, b) is the subset of the real numbers
(a, b) = {x ∈R | a < x < b}.
The closed interval [a, b] is the subset of the real numbers
[a, b] = {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b}.
The half-open (half-closed) intervals are
[a, b) = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b}
and
(a, b] = {x ∈R | a < x ≤b}.
Let a, b ∈R and let a < b. The inﬁnite intervals are
[a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a ≤x}
(a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a < x}
(−∞, b] = {x ∈R | x ≤b}
(−∞, b) = {x ∈R | x < b}
(−∞, ∞) = R.
A graph of some intervals is shown in Figure 3.9. The notation ◦means the
real number corresponding to the point is not in the interval; the notation •
means the real number corresponding to the point is in the interval.

Example 3.3.3 Let A = [−5, 2) and B = [1, ∞). Graph each of the following

a. A ∪B
b. A ∩B
c. A′
d. B′
e. A −B
f. B −A
g. A × B
h. B × A
Solution
In set notation, A = [−5, 2) = {x ∈R | −5 ≤x < 2} and B = [1, ∞) =
{x ∈R | 1 ≤x}.
a. We graph A and B on the same number line as shown in Figure 3.10.
Since A ∪B is the set of all elements in the set A or in the set B, the
graph of A ∪B is the set which appears at the bottom of Figure 3.10.
By the deﬁnition of union, A ∪B = {x ∈R | (−5 ≤x < 2) or (1 ≤x)}.
From this expression and from the graph of the set A∪B in Figure 3.10,
we see that the set notation for A ∪B is A ∪B = {x ∈R | −5 ≤x}.
Hence, in interval notation A ∪B = [−5, ∞).

all elements in the set A and in the set B, A ∩B in Figure 3.11 is the
region where the sets A and B “overlap.” Hence, the graph of A ∩B is
the set which appears at the bottom of Figure 3.11. By the deﬁnition

Set Theory
139
of intersection, A ∩B = {x ∈R | (−5 ≤x < 2) and (1 ≤x)}. From
this deﬁnition and Figure 3.11, we ﬁnd that the set notation for A ∩B
is A ∩B = {x ∈R | 1 ≤x < 2} and that the interval notation is
A ∩B = [1, 2).

is clear that B −A = {x ∈R | 2 ≤x} = [2, ∞).
g. First, we draw the Cartesian plane R × R.
Then, we graph the set
A along the horizontal axis and the set B along the vertical axis. The
graph of A × B is the “inﬁnite strip” shaded in Figure 3.16. In the
graph the right boundary of A × B (a ray of the line x = 2) appears as
a dashed line, because it does not belong to the set A × B. The point

Generalized Set Union and Intersection
The set operations of union and intersection are binary operations. That
is, at present ∪and ∩are deﬁned only for two sets.
However, by using
parentheses, we have been able to calculate more complex expressions such as
(A∪B)∪C, (A∩B)∪(C ∩D), and so forth. Also, until now, we have denoted
individual sets by diﬀerent capital letters. In this section we will extend the
deﬁnitions of union and intersection to arbitrary collections of sets.
Let A1, A2, and A3 (instead of the usual A, B, and C) be subsets of the
universe U. The associative law for set union is (A1∪A2)∪A3 = A1∪(A2∪A3).
Essentially, the associative law says we may omit the parentheses and simply
write A1 ∪A2 ∪A3, since it is immaterial if we calculate A1 ∪A2 ﬁrst and
then calculate the union of the sets A1 ∪A2 and A3 or if we calculate A2 ∪A3
ﬁrst and then calculate the union of the sets A1 and A2 ∪A3. The result of
either calculation is the same. Likewise, the set ((A1 ∪A2) ∪A3) ∪A4 may
be written as A1 ∪A2 ∪A3 ∪A4 and, in general, for n ∈N we may write
A1 ∪A2 ∪· · ·∪An without parentheses and without ambiguity. Note that for
n ∈N, x ∈A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An if and only if x ∈Ai for some i = 1, 2, . . .n.
Thus, we deﬁne the union of a ﬁnite number of sets A1, A2, . . ., An as follows.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Let n ∈N and let A1, A2, . . ., An be subsets of the universe U; then the
ﬁnite union of the sets A1, A2, . . ., An is
A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An = {x ∈U | x ∈Ai for some i = 1, 2, . . ., n}
= {x ∈U | (∃i ∈{1, 2, . . ., n})(x ∈Ai)}.
It is convenient to condense the notation for the ﬁnite union by writing
n
[
i=1
Ai = A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An.
We extend the deﬁnition of the union of a ﬁnite number of sets to the
inﬁnite number of sets A1, A2, . . . in the following manner.
For each n ∈N, let A1, A2, . . . be subsets of the universe U; then the
inﬁnite union of the sets A1, A2, . . . is

In an analogous manner, we deﬁne the intersection of a ﬁnite number of

A set of sets is often called a family of sets, or simply a family. We
will denote a family of sets by a script capital letter. For instance, the family
A = {{a}, {a, b},{a, b, c},{a,b,c, d}} is a family with four sets and the family
B = {(−a, a) | a ∈(0, ∞)} is an inﬁnite family of open intervals. The union
and intersection of a family of sets is deﬁned as follows.
Let F be a family of sets which are all subsets of a universe U. The union
over F
is
[
A∈F
A = {x ∈U | (∃A ∈F)(x ∈A)}.
The intersection over F
is
\
A∈F
A = {x ∈U | (∀A ∈F)(x ∈A)}.

146

Theorem 3.10
Let F be a family of sets and let B be any member of the
family F. Then
\
A∈F
A ⊆B
and
B ⊆
[
A∈F
A.
Proof: Let F be a family of sets and let B ∈F. Suppose x ∈T
A∈F A. Then
by the deﬁnition of intersection, x ∈A for every A ∈F. Since B ∈F, x ∈B.
Therefore, T
A∈F A ⊆B.
Let F be a family of sets, let B ∈F, and let x ∈B. By the deﬁnition
of union, x ∈B implies x ∈S
A∈F A, since B is a set in the family F.
Hence, every element of B is an element of the union S
A∈F A. Consequently,
B ⊆S
A∈F A.
■
It is tempting to conjecture that if F is a family of sets, then
\
A∈F
A ⊆
[
A∈F
A.
The next example shows this statement is false when the family of sets F is
the empty set. However, the statement T
A∈F A ⊆S
A∈F A is true whenever
the family of sets F is not the empty set.
Example 3.4.3 Let F be the empty family of subsets of the natural numbers,
N. Show that
a.
\
A∈F
A = N
b.
[
A∈F
A = ∅,
and
c.
\
A∈F
A ̸⊆
[
A∈F
A
Solution
a.
The statement (∀A ∈F)(x ∈A) is equivalent to (∀A)[(A ∈F) ⇒
(x ∈A)].
Since F is assumed to be the empty set, the hypothesis
of the last statement, A ∈F, is false. Consequently, the implication
[(A ∈F) ⇒(x ∈A)] is true for all x ∈N. Hence, T
A∈F A = N.
b.
The statement (∃A ∈F)(x ∈A) is logically equivalent to the statement
(∃A)[(A ∈F) ∧(x ∈A)]. The negation of the last statement is
(∀A)[¬(A ∈F) ∨(¬(x ∈A))] ≡(∀A)[(A ∈F) ⇒(x /∈A)].
Since F = ∅, A ∈F is false, and the implication (A ∈F) ⇒(x /∈A)
is true. Thus, it follows from the deﬁnition of union for a family of sets
that for F = ∅, S
A∈F A = ∅.

Set Theory
147
c.
Let F be the empty family of subsets of N. Since by part a, T
A∈F A =
N; since by part b, S
A∈F A = ∅; and since ∅⊂N, S
A∈F A ⊂T
A∈F A.
That is, for F = ∅, T
A∈F A ̸⊆S
A∈F A.
■
It is always possible to identify each set in a nonempty family of sets with
an identiﬁcation tag called an index. The following deﬁnition and examples
should help clarify this concept.
Let F be a nonempty family of sets and let I be a nonempty set with the
property that for each i ∈I there corresponds a set Ai ∈F. Then the family
of sets F = {Ai | i ∈I} is called an indexed family of sets. The set I is
called the indexing set and each i ∈I is called an index.
In Example 3.4.1, Ai = [i, i + 1) are the members of the family of sets F,
the natural numbers N is the indexing set I, and each natural number i is
an index. The family A = {{a}, {a, b},{a, b, c},{a,b,c, d}} contains four sets
and may be indexed by the indexing set I = {1, 2, 3, 4} where 1 is associated
with the set {a}, 2 is associated with the set {a, b}, 3 is associated with the
set {a, b, c}, and 4 is associated with the set {a, b, c, d}. Of course, associating
1 with {a, b}, 2 with {a, b, c, d}, 3 with {a}, and 4 with {a, b, c} is another
indexing of the family A by the indexing set I. In addition, the family A
may be indexed by the set J = {a, b, c, d} where a is associated with the set
{a}, b is associated with the set {a, b}, c is associated with the set {a, b, c},
and d is associated with the set {a, b, c, d}. These observations illustrate that
the indexing set for a family of sets is not unique and neither is the indexing
itself. The family B = {(−a, a) | a ∈(0, ∞)} may be indexed by the set
I = (0, ∞) by associating with each a ∈(0, ∞) the interval (−a, a) in the
family B. Notice that B can be indexed by the set (0, ∞) by associating with
each a ∈(0, ∞) the interval (−a/2, a/2). Using this technique, we can clearly
index B in an inﬁnite number of ways.
Every nonempty family of sets F may be indexed. Simply choose the in-
dexing set to be F itself and associate with each set A in the indexing set
the set A in the family of sets. When F is a nonempty family of sets indexed
by the set I, the following alternate deﬁnitions may be used for S
A∈F A and
T
A∈F A, respectively.[
i∈I
Ai = {x ∈U | (∃i ∈I)(x ∈Ai)}
and
\
i∈I
Ai = {x ∈U | (∀i ∈I)(x ∈Ai)}.
Many theorems regarding set operations for ﬁnitely many sets can be
generalized to theorems regarding set operations for arbitrary families.
For example, the distributive laws A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C) and
A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) and the De Morgan laws (A ∪B)′ = A′ ∩B′
and (A ∩B)′ = A′ ∪B′ may be generalized as stated in Theorems 3.11 and
3.12.

Deﬁnitions
A set consists of objects called elements or members.
Sets are described in roster notation, in which the elements of the set are
enclosed in curly braces, { }, and separated by commas, or in set-builder
notation, in which the set is speciﬁed in the form {x | P(x)}.
There is one and only one set which has no elements. It is called the empty
set or null set. The empty set is the set ∅= {x | x ̸= x}.
The set A is a subset of the set B, written A ⊆B, if and only if every
element of A is an element of B. That is, A ⊆B ⇔(∀x)[(x ∈A) ⇒(x ∈B)].

Set Theory
151
Two sets A and B are equal if and only if [(A ⊆B) ∧(B ⊆A)].
The set A is a proper subset of the set B, written A ⊂B, if and only if
A is a subset of B and A ̸= B. That is, A ⊂B ⇔[(A ⊆B) ∧(A ̸= B)].
The set of all subsets of a ﬁnite set A is denoted by P(A) and is called the
power set of A.
Let A and B be two subsets of the universe U. The set A union B is the
subset of U which contains all elements that belong either to A or to B or to
both A and B. Thus,
A ∪B = {x | x ∈A or x ∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B)}.
The set A intersect B is the subset of U which contains all elements that
belong both A and B. That is,
A ∩B = {x | x ∈A and x ∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B)}.
When A ∩B = ∅, the sets A and B are said to be disjoint.
The complement of the set A, written A′, is the set of all elements in the
universe, U, which are not in the set A. Hence, A′ = {x | x ∈U and x /∈A} =
{x | (x ∈U) ∧(x /∈A)}.
An equation, expression, or statement in set theory which is obtained by
interchanging ∪and ∩and interchanging the sets ∅and U is called the dual
of the equation, expression, or statement accordingly.
Let A and B be two subsets of the universe U. The set diﬀerence of A
and B, written A −B, is the set of all elements in the set A that are not in
the set B. That is, A −B = {x | x ∈A and x /∈B} = {x | (x ∈A) ∧(x /∈B)}.
An ordered pair with a as ﬁrst element and b as second element is
denoted by (a, b).
The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, written as A × B, is the
set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈A and b ∈B. That is, A × B =
{(a, b) | a ∈A and b ∈B}.
Let a, b ∈R and let a < b.
The open interval (a, b) is the subset of the real numbers
(a, b) = {x ∈R | a < x < b}.
The closed interval [a, b] is the subset of the real numbers
[a, b] = {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b}.
The half-open (half-closed) intervals are
[a, b) = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b} and (a, b] = {x ∈R | a < x ≤b}.
The inﬁnite intervals are
[a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a ≤x}
(a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a < x}
(−∞, b] = {x ∈R | x ≤b}

of sets F = {Ai | i ∈I} is called an indexed family of sets. The set I is
called the indexing set and each i ∈I is called an index.
Useful Laws
The principle of duality for set theory says “If T is a theorem which is
written in terms of ∪, ∩, and ′, then the dual statement T D is also a theorem.”
The algebra of sets consists of a collection A of subsets ∅, U, A, B, C, . . .
of some universe U. On the collection A there is deﬁned two relations, ⊆

and =; two binary operations, ∪and ∩; and one unary operation ′. The
collection A also has the properties that if A and B are arbitrary sets of A,

Proof? Suppose x ̸∈C. Since x ∈A and A ⊆B, x ∈B. Since x ̸∈C

then A ∩B ̸= ∅.
Proof? Since A ̸⊆C, there exists an x ∈A such that x ̸∈C. Since x ̸∈C
and A −B ⊆C, x ̸∈A −B. Since x ∈A and x ̸∈A −B, x ∈B. Hence,
x ∈A ∩B. That is, A ∩B ̸= ∅.

Proof? Let a be any element of A and let b be any element of B. Then
(a, b) ∈A × B. Since A × B ⊆C × D, (a, b) ∈C × D. Hence, a ∈C and
b ∈D. Therefore, A ⊆C and B ⊆D.

Chapter 4
Relations
Relations and functions play a major role in many branches of mathematics
and sciences. Historically, the concept of a function was introduced prior to
the concept of a relation. However, a relation is more general entity than a
function. Therefore, in this chapter we will consider relations and in the next
chapter we will consider functions.
4.1
Relations
In everyday conversations, we often hear statements such as “Richard is
the husband of Sue,” “Kimberly is the sister of Jerry,” “Alaska is larger than
Arizona,” and so forth. Each of these sentences includes a predicate (“is the
husband of,” “is the sister of,” or “is larger than”) which expresses a “relation”
between two objects. The word “relation” implies an association between two
objects—people, states, numbers, concepts, etc.—based on some property
of the objects. In elementary mathematics, you previously encountered the
relations “is equal to,” “is less than,” “is congruent to,” “is parallel to,” and
many more.
Let P(x, y) denote the open sentence in two variables: “x is
the husband of y.”
If we specify that the variable x is an element of the
set of all living male people, M, and y is an element of the set of all living
female people, F, then given a particular ordered pair (m, f) ∈M ×F we can
substitute x = m and y = f into the open sentence P(x, y) and obtain the
statement P(m, f). This statement will be true or false but not both. Let H
denote the predicate “is the husband of.” When P(m, f) is true, we will write
(m, f) ∈H, which is read “m is H-related to f.” In this instance, we would
say “m is the husband of f.” On the other hand, when P(m, f) is false, we
will write (m, f) /∈H, which is read “m is not H-related to f.” In general, two
sets of ordered pairs are determined by each relation R—the set of ordered
pairs which satisﬁes the relation, R, and the set of ordered pairs which does
not satisfy the relation, R′.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
We now state the mathematical deﬁnition of a relation formally. Let A and
B be sets.
A relation from A to B is any subset of A × B. In particular, when
B = A, a relation R from A to A is called a relation on A.
The domain of a relation R from A to B is the set
Dom(R) = {x ∈A | (∃y ∈B)((x, y) ∈R)}.
The range of a relation R from A to B is the set
Rng(R) = {y ∈B | (∃x ∈A)((x, y) ∈R)}.
The domain of a relation R from A to B is the set of all ﬁrst coordinates of
the ordered pairs in the set R and, by deﬁnition, the domain of R is a subset
of A—that is, Dom(R) ⊆A. The range of a relation R from A to B is the set
of all second coordinates of the ordered pairs in the set R and, by deﬁnition,
Rng(R) ⊆B.
Let R be any set of ordered pairs, let A be any set such that Dom(R) ⊆A,
and let B be any set such that Rng(R) ⊆B.
Then by deﬁnition R is a
relation from A to B.
Consequently, every set of ordered pairs is a
relation. For example, let R = {(1, a), (b, 2), (1, 2)}. Then Dom(R) = {1, b},
Rng(R) = {a, 2}, and R is a relation from A = Dom(R) to B = Rng(R).
Example 4.1.1 Let A = {1, 2, 3}, and B = {2, 3, 4}. Let S be the relation
from A to B deﬁned by
S = {(x, y) ∈A × B | x is less than y}.
And let T be the relation from B to A deﬁned by
T = {(x, y) ∈B × A | x is less than y}.
a. Use the roster method to specify S, Dom(S), and Rng(S).
b. Use the roster method to specify T, Dom(T), and Rng(T).
Solution
a. Since 1 ∈A and 1 < 2 ∈B, 1 < 3 ∈B, and 1 < 4 ∈B, the ordered
pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) are elements of S. Likewise, since 2 ∈A but
2 ̸< 2 ∈B, (2, 2) /∈S. However, since 2 < 3 ∈B and 2 < 4 ∈B, (2, 3) and
(2, 4) are elements of S. Since 3 ∈A, 3 ̸< 2 ∈B and 3 ̸< 3 ∈B, (3, 2) /∈S
and (3, 3) /∈S. But since 3 < 4 ∈B, (3, 4) ∈S. Hence,
S = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1,4), (2, 3),(2, 4), (3,4)}.
Because the ﬁrst coordinates of the ordered pairs of S are 1, 2, 3, Dom(S) =
{1, 2, 3} = A. Because the second coordinates of the ordered pairs of S are 2,
3, 4, Rng(S) = {2, 3, 4} = B.
b. Since 2 ∈B and 2 < 3 ∈A but b < a is false for all other b ∈B and
a ∈A, T = {(2, 3)}, Dom(T) = {2} ⊂B, and Rng(T) = {3} ⊂A.

A graph of the relation S = {(x, y) ∈A × B | x < y} where A = {1, 2, 3}

of S, S′ = {(x, y) ∈A×B | ¬(x < y)} = {(x, y) ∈A×B | x ≥y} is displayed

If we interchange the components of the ordered pairs in the relation S
of Example 4.1.1, we obtain the set {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (3,2), (4,2),(4, 3)}.
This relation is designated by S−1 and is called the inverse relation of S.
Observe that Dom(S−1) = {2, 3, 4} = Rng(S) and Rng(S−1) = {1, 2, 3} =
Dom(S). Now let U = Dom(S) ∪Rng(S) = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Graphing the ordered
pairs in S using open dots, ◦, and graphing the ordered pairs in S−1 using
closed dots, •, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2:
A graph of the relations S and S−1.
Notice that corresponding to each point (a, b) ∈S there corresponds exactly
one point (b, a) ∈S−1. For example, (1, 2) in S corresponds to (2, 1) in S−1,
(2, 3) in S corresponds to (3, 2) in S−1, and so forth. If the “diagonal line
y = x” is considered to be a mirror, then corresponding to each point (a, b) ∈S
is the “mirror image” (b, a) ∈S−1 and vice versa. Hence, the relation S−1
is the “mirror image” of the relation S with respect to the “line y = x” and,
likewise, S is the “mirror image” of S−1. Also observe from Figure 4.1(b) and
Figure 4.2 that S−1 ̸= S′—that is, the inverse of a relation is not equal to its
complement.
In set-builder notation, S = {(x, y) ∈A × B | x < y} and, as indicted by
Figure 4.2, the inverse relation S−1 = {(x, y) ∈B×A | y < x}. The condition

162
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
y < x used to deﬁne S−1 is obtained from the condition x < y used to deﬁne
S by interchanging the variables x and y. Thus, if a relation is deﬁned by
some condition on the variables x and y, then the condition which deﬁnes the
inverse relation is obtained from the original condition by interchanging the
variables x and y. In general, we deﬁne an inverse relation in the following
manner. If R is a relation from A to B, then the inverse relation from B
to A is the relation
R−1 = {(x, y) ∈B × A | (y, x) ∈R}.
An important family of relations is the family of identity relations—one
relation for each nonempty set A. This family is deﬁned as follows. Let A be
a nonempty set. The identity relation on A is the set
IA = {(x, x) ∈A × A | x ∈A}.
From the deﬁnition of the identity relation, it is clear that Dom(IA) =
Rng(IA) = A. If C = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then IC = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4,4)}. A
graph of IC is shown in Figure 4.3. The points on IC are points on the “line”
about which a relation S on C is reﬂected in order to obtain the inverse rela-
tion S−1 on C. (Locate the points of the relation IC in Figure 4.2 and notice
that the point (1, 3) is the reﬂection of (3, 1) about the point (2, 2) ∈IC and
that the point (2, 4) is the reﬂection of (4, 2) about the point (3, 3) ∈IC.)

Figure 4.3:
A graph of the relation IC.
Let R be a relation from A to B and let S be a relation from C to D.
The relation R equals S, which is denoted by R = S, if and only if A = C,
B = D, and [(x, y) ∈R ⇔(x, y) ∈S].
The next two examples should help clarify this deﬁnition. The identity
relation on the natural numbers is
IN = {(x, x) ∈N × N | x = x}
and the identity relation on the integers is
IZ = {(x, x) ∈Z × Z | x = x}.
The identity relation IN ̸= IZ, because Dom(IN) = N ̸= Z = Dom(IZ).
Let A = {1, 2} = C, B = {a, b} = D, R = {(1, a), (2, b)}, and S = {(1, b),
(2, a)}. Then Dom(R) = {1, 2} = Dom(S) and Rng(R) = {a, b} = Rng(S);
however, R ̸= S because (1, a) ∈R but (1, a) /∈S.

Relations
163
Since relations are sets, we can perform the usual unary set operation of
complementation and the binary set operations of union, intersection, and set
diﬀerence on relations. Moreover, because relations are sets of ordered pairs,
we can perform additional binary operations such as composition. Let R be a
relation from A to B and let S be a relation from B to C. The composition
of S and R is the relation
S ◦R = {(a, c) ∈A × C | (∃b ∈B)[((a, b) ∈R) ∧((b, c) ∈S)]}.
Example 4.1.2
Let A = {a, b, c, d}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4,5}, C = {w, x, y, z},
R = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c,3)}, and S = {(1, x), (2, y), (4, w)}. Determine
a. S ◦R
b. Dom(S ◦R)
c. Rng(S ◦R)
Solution
Perhaps the best way to visualize the composition of S and R is through
the arrow diagram shown in Figure 4.4. First, we draw regions to represent
the sets A, B, and C and select points in the regions to represent the elements
of the sets. Since the ordered pair (a, 1) is in the relation R, we draw an arrow
from the point a in set A to the point 1 in the set B. Since (a, 2) is in the
relation R, we draw an arrow from the point a to 2, and so forth. Once we
have completed drawing all of the arrows from A to B which represent the
relation R, we draw the arrows from points in the set B to points in the set C
which represent the relation S. To determine the set of ordered pairs in the
composition S ◦R, we select, in turn, elements in set A and ﬁnd all paths,
if any, which lead from that element to some element in C. The set of all
ordered pairs found in this manner constitutes the elements of S ◦R. For
instance, a ∈A and there is a path from a through 1 ∈B to x ∈C. Hence,
(a, x) ∈S ◦R. There is another path from a ∈A through 2 ∈B to y ∈C.
Thus, (a, y) ∈S ◦R. Using Figure 4.4 and proceeding in this fashion, we ﬁnd
S ◦R = {(a, x), (a, y), (b, y)}.
Hence, Dom(S ◦R) = {a, b} ⊂A and Rng(S ◦R) = {x, y} ⊂C.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Observe that for relations R and S as deﬁned in Example 4.1.2 the com-
position R ◦S is not deﬁned, since S is a relation from B to C and R is a
relation from A to B. Hence, the binary operation of composition, ◦, is not
commutative—that is, S ◦R ̸= R ◦S. Even if S and R are both relations on
the same set A and S ◦R and R ◦S are both deﬁned, S ◦R may not equal
R ◦S. For example, let A = {1, b}, R = {(1, b)}, and S = {(b, 1)}. Then
S ◦R = {(1, 1)}, R ◦S = {(b, b)}, and S ◦R ̸= R ◦S.
Theorem 4.1 Let R be a relation from A to B; then
a. IB ◦R = R
and
b. R ◦IA = R
Proof:
a. Assume (x, y) ∈R. Then y ∈B and (y, y) ∈IB. By the deﬁnition
of composition, since (x, y) ∈R and (y, y) ∈IB, it follows that (x, y) ∈IB ◦R.
Hence, R ⊆IB ◦R.
Now assume (x, y) ∈IB ◦R. By deﬁnition of IB ◦R there exists a b ∈B
such that (x, b) ∈R and (b, y) ∈IB. Since (b, y) ∈IB, b = y and since
(x, b) ∈R, (x, y) ∈R. Thus, IB ◦R ⊆R. Consequently, IB ◦R = R.
■
b. Proving that R ◦IA = R is an exercise.
Theorem 4.1 states that a relation R from A to B has a “left” identity—
the identity relation IB such that IB ◦R = R—and a “right” identity—the
identity relation IA such that R ◦IA = R. But unless A = B, the relation R
does not have an identity I such that I ◦R = R ◦I = R. When A = B, the
identity for the relation R on A is the relation IA.
In elementary algebra, for all real numbers x ̸= 0, there exists a real number
called the multiplicative inverse of x and denoted by x−1 with the property
that x · x−1 = x−1 · x = 1, the multiplicative identity for the set of real
numbers. Example 4.1.3 provides an example of a relation R for which neither
the composition R ◦R−1 nor the composition R−1 ◦R is an identity relation.
Example 4.1.3 Let R = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3,2)}. Calculate R◦R−1 and R−1◦R.
Solution
The inverse relation is R−1 = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 3)}.
Since (2, 1) ∈R−1
and (1, 2), (1, 3) ∈R,
(2, 2), (2, 3) ∈R ◦R−1.
Since (3, 1) ∈R−1 and
(1, 2), (1, 3) ∈R,
(3, 2), (3, 3) ∈R ◦R−1.
And since (2, 3) ∈R−1 and
(3, 2) ∈R, (2, 2) ∈R ◦R−1. Hence, R ◦R−1 = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3,2),(3, 3)},
which is not an identity relation because (2, 3) ∈R ◦R−1.
In a like manner, we ﬁnd R−1 ◦R = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3,3)}, which is
not an identity relation because (1, 3) ∈R−1 ◦R.

Example 4.1.4 Let T = {(x, y) ∈R × R | x2 + y2 = 4} and let
V = {(x, y) ∈R × R | x2 + (y −2)2 = 9}. Find
a. Dom(T)
b. Rng(T)
c. Dom(V )
d. Rng(V )
e. V ◦T
f. Dom(V ◦T)
g. Rng(V ◦T)
Solution
a.–d.
The graph of the relation T is a circle with center at the origin and
radius 2. Hence, Dom(T) = [−2, 2] = Rng(T). The graph of the relation V is
a circle with center at (0, 2) and radius 3. Therefore, Dom(V ) = [−3, 3] and
Rng(V ) = [−1, 5].

= {(x,y) ∈[−2,2] × [−1, 5] | (y −2)2 −x2 = 5}
f.–g. The graph of (y −2)2 −x2 = 5 is a hyperbola with center at (0, 2) and
transverse axis the y-axis. See Figure 4.5. Since by deﬁnition of composition,
Dom(V ◦T) ⊆Dom(T) = [−2, 2] and since (y −2)2 −x2 = 5 is deﬁned for all
x ∈[−2, 2], Dom(V ◦T) = [−2, 2]. From Figure 4.5, we see that

Theorem 4.2 states that the inverse of the composition of two relations,
(S ◦R)−1, is the composition of the inverse of the second relation with the
inverse of the ﬁrst relation, R−1 ◦S−1.
We proved earlier by example that the operation of composition on relations
is not commutative. That is, we showed that, in general, for relations R and
S, R ◦S ̸= S ◦R. However, the operation of composition on relations is
associative, as we state and prove in the next theorem.
Theorem 4.3 Let R be a relation from A to B, let S be a relation from B
to C, and let T be a relation from C to D. Then T ◦(S ◦R) = (T ◦S) ◦R.

The Order Relations
<,
≤,
>,
≥
In addition to the operations of addition, +, and multiplication, ·, the sets of
natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers have an order
relation < (read “less than”) which satisﬁes certain axioms. These axioms
can be expressed in terms of the undeﬁned concept of positiveness. A set
of numbers S is ordered if there exists a subset of positive numbers Sp
which satisfy the axioms:
O1. (Trichotomy Law)
For all x ∈S exactly one of the following three
statements is true:
x = 0,
x ∈Sp,
−x ∈Sp.
O2. For all x, y ∈Sp,
x + y ∈Sp.
O3. For all x, y ∈Sp,
x · y ∈Sp.

Relations
169
We deﬁne negative, <, ≤, >, ≥
as follows:
The number x is negative if and only if −x is positive.
The order relation < (read “is less than”) is deﬁned by x < y ⇔y −x is
positive.
The order relation > (read “is greater than”) is deﬁned by x > y ⇔x−y
is positive.
The order relation ≤(read “is less than or equal to”) is deﬁned by
x ≤y ⇔x < y or x = y.
The order relation ≥(read “is greater than or equal to”) is deﬁned by
x ≥y ⇔x > y or x = y.
Observe that x < y and y > x are equivalent statements as are x ≤y
and y ≥x.
Likewise, the conjunction x ≤y and y ≤z can be abbre-
viated by the single statement x ≤y ≤z.
Similarly, x > y > z ⇔
x > y and y > z, and x ≥y ≥z ⇔x ≥y and y ≥z. The natural numbers,
the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers with the usual op-
erations of addition, +, and multiplication, ·, and the order relation, <, are
all ordered sets. The integers are an example of an integral domain and the
rational numbers and the real numbers are examples of ordered ﬁelds.
Using the axioms and deﬁnitions stated above, for w, x, y, z ∈R the follow-
ing theorems can be proved.
T1. 0 < x ⇔x is positive.
T2. The transitive law holds for <: If x < y and y < z, then x < z.
T3. The trichotomy law holds for <: If x, y ∈R exactly one of the follow-
ing statements is true: x = y,
x < y,
y < x.
T4. x < y ⇒x + z < y + z.
T5. x < 0 ⇔x is negative.
T6. If x < 0 and y < 0, then x+y < 0. (The sum of two negative numbers
is a negative number.)
T7. If x < 0 and y < 0, then x · y > 0. (The product of two negative
numbers is a positive number.)
T8. If x ̸= 0, then 0 < x2.
T9. 1 > 0.
T10. If 0 < x < y, then 0 < 1
y < 1
x.
T11. If x < y and 0 < z, then xz < yz.
T12. If x < y and z < 0, then yz < xz.
T13. If x < y, then −y < −x.
T14. If x < y and z < w, then x + z < y + w.
T15. If 0 < x < y and 0 < z < w, then
xz < yw
and
x
w < y
z .
T16. If x ≤y and y ≤z, then x ≤z.
T17. If x ≤y and y ≤x, then x = y.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
T18. If x ≤y and 0 < z, then xz ≤yz.
T19. If x ≤y and z < 0, then yz ≤xz.
Let A be a nonempty set of real numbers. The number m ∈A is the least
element of A (smallest element of A or minimum of A) if and only if
for every x ∈A, m ≤x. The number M ∈A is the greatest element of A
(largest element of A or maximum of A) if and only if for every x ∈A,
M ≥x.
Some nonempty subsets of R have least elements; others do not. For ex-
ample, the set of natural numbers N has a least element which is 1. The set
of integers Z does not have a least element. The open interval (−2, 3) does
not have a least element. Although for all x ∈(−2, 3), −2 ≤x, −2 is not
a least element of (−2, 3), because −2 /∈(−2, 3). On the other hand, −2 is
the least element of the interval [−2, 3), because −2 ≤x for all x ∈[−2, 3)
and −2 ∈[−2, 3). The following theorem proves if a set of real numbers has
a least element, it is unique.
Theorem 4.4 The least element of a set A of real numbers is unique.
Proof:
Suppose x and y are distinct least elements of A. Since x is a least
element of A and y ∈A,
x ≤y. Also, since y is a least element of A and
x ∈A, y ≤x. By Theorem T17, x = y, and the least element of A is unique.

The Archimedean Property of Euclidean geometry states that any length
no matter how large can be exceeded by repeatedly “marking oﬀ” a given
length no matter how small. The following is the algebraic formulation of the
Archimedean Property for the set of natural numbers.
Theorem 4.5 The Archimedean Property for the Natural Numbers
For all m, n ∈N there exists a k ∈N such that m < kn.
Proof:
By T9, 0 < 1. Adding m and using T4, we ﬁnd that
m = 0 + m < 1 + m = m + 1.
That is, (1) m < m + 1. Since 1 is the least element of N and since 0 < 1,
(2) 0 < 1 ≤m and (3) 1 ≤n. From (1) and (2), we have (4) 0 < m < m+1.
Multiplying (3) by m + 1 > 0 yields (5) 1 · (m + 1) ≤n · (m + 1) by T18. It
follows from (4) and (5) that m < m + 1 ≤(m + 1) · n. That is, the value
k = m + 1 ∈N makes the conclusion of the Archimedean Property true.
■
A nonempty set A of real numbers is well-ordered if and only if every
nonempty subset of A has a least element. For example, the nonempty set
A = {−1, π, e} is well-ordered, because each of the nonempty subsets {−1},
{π}, {e}, {−1, π}, {−1, e}, {π, e}, and A all have a least element. It is fairly
evident from this example that any nonempty, ﬁnite subset of real numbers
is well-ordered. The open interval (−2, 3) is not well-ordered, since it has
no least element. Although the interval [−2, 3) has a least element, it is not
well-ordered since the subset (−2, 3) has no least element. The sets Z, Q, and

Relations
171
R are not well-ordered, because none of these sets has a least element. Even
though it appears obvious that the set of natural numbers N is well-ordered,
a proof of this fact requires the use of the Axiom of Induction, which we will
not study until Chapter 6. Thus, for now, we state the well-ordering principle
without proof.
The Well-Ordering Principle:
The set of natural numbers is well-
ordered by the relation <.
It follows easily from the well-ordering principle that the set of whole num-
bers W = N ∪{0} is well-ordered by <, since any nonempty set of W which
contains the element 0 has 0 as its least element and since any nonempty set
of W which does not contain 0 is a nonempty subset of N and therefore has
a least element by the well-ordering principle.
In elementary school, you learned how to use a process called “long division”
to divide one natural number b, called the dividend, by a natural number a,
called the divisor, to obtain two whole numbers q, called the quotient, and
r, called the remainder. The whole numbers q and r are unique and satisfy
the equation b = aq + r where 0 ≤r < a. We now state and prove a theorem
called the division algorithm for natural numbers.
Theorem 4.6 The Division Algorithm for the Natural Numbers
For all a, b ∈N there exists unique q, r ∈W such that b = aq + r and
0 ≤r < a.
Proof:
Let a, b ∈N. Consider the set S = {b−ax | x ∈W and b−ax ≥0}.
Since x = 0 ∈W and b ∈N, b −a · 0 = b ≥0. Thus, by deﬁnition of S,
b ∈S and S is a nonempty subset of the whole numbers. As a consequence
of the well-ordering principle, S has a smallest element r and by deﬁnition of
S, r ≥0. Since r ∈S, there exists a q ∈W such that r = b −aq. That is,
there exist whole numbers q and r such that b = aq + r and r ≥0.
We now show that r < a by contradiction. Assume to the contrary a ≤r
and let d = r −a ≥0. Since a ∈N, a > 0 and d < r. Furthermore,
d = r −a = (b −aq) −a = b −a(q + 1) ≥0.
Consequently, d ∈S and d < r, which contradicts r being the smallest element
of S. Thus, we have 0 ≤r < a.
In order to show that the whole numbers q and r which satisfy b = aq + r
and 0 ≤r < a are unique, assume there exists a second pair of whole numbers
q2 ̸= q and r2 ̸= r such that b = aq2 + r2 and 0 ≤r2 < a. Since b = aq + r =
aq2+r2, (1) a(q−q2) = r2−r. By deﬁnition a divides r2−r, because a, q−q2,
and r2 −r are integers. Since 0 ≤r < a, −a < −r ≤0. Adding 0 ≤r2 < a
to this last inequality, we obtain −a < r2 −r < a. Assume r2 ≥r then
(2) 0 ≤r2 −r < a. Remark: Instead of assuming r2 ≥r, we could assume
r ≥r2 and reach the same conclusions throughout the remainder of the proof
by interchanging r and r2. Since a divides the nonnegative integer r2 −r and
since from (2) 0·a ≤r2−r < 1·a, either there is an integer between 0 and 1 or

172
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
r2 = r. Because there is no integer between 0 and 1, (3) r2 = r. Substituting
(3) into (1), we ﬁnd a(q −q2) = 0, which implies a = 0 or q −q2 = 0. Since
a ∈N, a ̸= 0 and therefore q = q2.
■
The concept of the greatest lower bound of a set is similar to, but not the
same as, the concept of the least element, and the concept of a least upper
bound of a set is similar to the concept of a greatest element. We deﬁne these
new concepts below.
Let A be a subset of the real numbers R. The number m ∈R is a lower
bound for A if m ≤x for all x ∈A.
The number m ∈R is the greatest lower bound for A (inﬁmum of A)
(i) if m is a lower bound for A and (ii) if ℓis a lower bound for A, then m ≥ℓ.
The number u ∈R is an upper bound for A if u ≥x for all x ∈A.
The number u ∈R is the least upper bound for A (supremum of A)
(i) if u is an upper bound for A and (ii) if t is an upper bound for A, then
u ≤t.
The set A is bounded if it has a lower bound and an upper bound.
The set A1 = {−3, −1, 3, 7} has lower bounds of −20, −8, −5 and −3. A1
has a greatest lower bound of −3, and the least element of A1 is −3. A1 has
upper bounds of 7, 11, 15, and 24. A1 has a least upper bound of 7, and the
greatest element of A1 is 7. The set A1 is bounded. The set A2 = (5, 11] has
lower bounds of −2, 0, and 5. The greatest lower bound of A2 is 5, but A2
has no least element since 5 /∈A2. A2 has upper bounds of 13, 17, and 24.
The least upper bound of A2 is 11, and the greatest element of A2 is 11. A2
is bounded. The set A3 = (−∞, 4) is not bounded below and therefore has
no least element. A3 is bounded above, has a least upper bound of 4, but has
no greatest element.
A ﬁeld F with addition + and multiplication · which is ordered by the
relation < is a complete ordered ﬁeld if and only if every nonempty subset
of F which has an upper bound has a least upper bound in F.
Both the rational number system and the real number system are ordered
ﬁelds. The real number system is a complete ordered ﬁeld, but the rational
number system is not a complete ordered ﬁeld. This is one distinction between
the ﬁeld of rational numbers and the ﬁeld of real numbers. We will not prove
the ordered ﬁeld of real numbers is complete; however, after we prove the
Archimedean Property of the real numbers we will prove the ordered ﬁeld of
rational numbers is not complete.
Theorem 4.7 The Archimedean Property for the Real Numbers
If x, y ∈R,
x > 0, and
y > 0, then there exists an n ∈N such that
nx > y.
Proof: If this theorem were false, the inequality nx ≤y would hold for all
n ∈N. That is, the set A = {nx | n ∈N, x ∈R and x > 0} would be
bounded above by y. The set A is nonempty, since x ∈A. Since the ﬁeld

Relations
173
of real numbers is complete, there exists a u ∈R which is the least upper
bound for A. Thus, nx ≤u for all n ∈N. Hence, (n + 1)x ≤u for all n ∈N.
Consequently, u−x is an upper bound for A. But u−x < u, which contradicts
u being the least upper bound for A.
■
Corollary 4.7.1 If y ∈R, there exists an n ∈N such that n > y.
Proof: If y ≤0, let n = 1. If y > 0, let x = 1 in Theorem 4.7.
■
Corollary 4.7.2 If p ∈R and p > 0, there exists an n ∈N such that 1
n < p.
Proof: Let x = 1 and y = 1
p > 0. Then by Theorem 4.7 there exists an
n ∈N such that n · 1 > 1
p or equivalently 1
n < p.
■
Theorem 4.8 The ordered ﬁeld of rational numbers, Q, is not complete.
Proof: Consider the set of rational numbers A = {x ∈Q | x <
√
2}. The set
A is bounded above in Q by 2. Suppose u ∈Q is the least upper bound of A.
Case 1. If u <
√
2, then
√
2 −u > 0 and by Corollary 4.7.2 there exists
an n ∈N such that 1
n <
√
2 −u. The number u + 1
n is rational, is less than
√
2, and is an element of A by deﬁnition. Since u + 1
n ∈A and u < u + 1
n,
u is not an upper bound for A, which is a contradiction.
Case 2. If u >
√
2, then u −
√
2 > 0 and by Corollary 4.7.2 there exists
an m ∈N such that 1
m < u −
√
2. The number u −1
m is rational, is greater
than
√
2, and is an upper bound for A. But u −1
m < u, which contradicts u
being the least upper bound for A.
Since u <
√
2 is false and u >
√
2 is false, we conclude from the trichotomy
law that u =
√
2 /∈Q. So A is a nonempty subset of the ﬁeld of rational num-
bers which has a least upper bound which is not an element of Q. Therefore,
by deﬁnition, the ordered ﬁeld of rational numbers is not complete.
■
The following theorem states that for all real numbers x there is a unique
integer n such that x ∈[n, n + 1).
Theorem 4.9 If x ∈R, there exists a unique n ∈Z such that n ≤x < n+1.
Proof: Case 1. If x is an integer, let n = x and the conclusion is true.
Case 2. If x is not an integer, by Corollary 4.7.1 there exists a natural
number k such that k > x.
Also by Corollary 4.7.1 there exists a natu-
ral number ℓsuch that ℓ> −x, which implies −ℓ< x.
That is, there
are two integers k and m = −ℓsuch that m < x < k.
Since x is not
an integer, x must lie between two consecutive integers in the ﬁnite set
S = {m, m + 1, m + 2, . . ., k}.
Suppose n1 and n2 are two distinct inte-
gers in S such that n1 < x < n1 + 1 and n2 < x < n2 + 1. Assume n1 < n2.

174
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Then n1 < n2 < x < n1 +1. That is, there is an integer (namely, n2) between
n1 and n1 + 1. Contradiction.
■
An important property of both the set of rational numbers and the set of
irrational numbers is that they are both dense in the set of real numbers.
That is, between any two distinct real numbers there is a rational number
and an irrational number.
As a matter of fact, between any two distinct
real numbers there are an inﬁnite number of rational numbers and an inﬁnite
number of irrational numbers. In the following theorem, we prove the set of
rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers.
Theorem 4.10 If a, b ∈R and a < b, then there exists a rational number r
such that a < r < b.
Proof: Since a < b, b −a > 0 and by Corollary 4.7.2 there exists a natural
number n such that 1
n < b −a. Solving for b, we ﬁnd (1) a + 1
n < b. By
Theorem 4.9 there exists a unique integer m such that (2) m ≤an+1 < m+1.
Multiplying the left-hand inequality of (2) by 1
n > 0 yields (3) m
n ≤a + 1
n.
Solving the right-hand inequality of (2) for a yields (4) a < m
n . Combining
(1), (3), and (4), we have a < m
n ≤a + 1
n < b. Observe that r1 = m
n is a
rational number such that a < r1 < b.
■
In the proof of Theorem 4.10 the rational number r1 satisﬁes r1 < b. So by
Theorem 4.10 there exists a second rational number r2 which satisﬁes a < r1 <
r2 < b, and a third rational number r3 which satisﬁes a < r1 < r2 < r3 < b,
etc. Thus, there are an inﬁnite number of rational numbers between a and b.
We now show that between every two distinct rational numbers there is an
irrational number.
Theorem 4.11 If r, s ∈Q and r < s, then there exists an irrational number
t such that r < t < s.
Proof: Claim: The number t = r+(
√
2−1)(s−r) is irrational and r < t < s.
The number
√
2 −1 is irrational, since it is the sum of the irrational number
√
2 and the rational number −1. The number s−r is rational, because s and r
are both rational. Since (
√
2−1)(s−r) is the product of an irrational number
and a rational number, it is irrational. Therefore, t, which is the sum of the
rational number r and the irrational number (
√
2 −1)(s −r), is irrational.
Since
√
2 −1 > 0 and s −r > 0 by O3, (
√
2 −1)(s −r) > 0 and t −r =
(
√
2 −1)(s −r) > 0. Hence, r < t. Multiplying and rearranging, we ﬁnd
t = r + (
√
2−1)(s −r) = (2 −
√
2)r + (
√
2 −1)s. Since r < s and 2 −
√
2 > 0,
(2 −
√
2)r < (2 −
√
2)s. Consequently,
t = (2 −
√
2)r + (
√
2 −1)s < (2 −
√
2)s + (
√
2 −1)s = s.
Therefore, r < t < s.

Finally, we show that between any two distinct real numbers there is an
irrational number.
Theorem 4.12 If a, b ∈R and a < b, then there exists an irrational number
t such that a < t < b.
Proof:
By Theorem 4.10 there exists a rational number r such that
a < r < b. Also by Theorem 4.10 there exists a rational number s such
that a < r < s < b. By Theorem 4.11 there exists an irrational number t such
that a < r < t < s < b.

Reﬂexive, Symmetric, Transitive, and Equivalence
Relations
Often relations are classiﬁed based upon one or more properties they satisfy.
Usually, relations with the same classiﬁcations have additional like properties
as well. Three important properties used to classify relations are the proper-
ties of being reﬂexive, symmetric, or transitive.
Let R be a relation on a set A. R is a reﬂexive relation on A if and only
if (∀x ∈A)[(x, x) ∈R].
R is a symmetric relation on A if and only if
(∀x, y ∈A)[((x, y) ∈R) ⇒((y, x) ∈R)].
R is a transitive relation on A if and only if
(∀x, y, z ∈A)[(((x, y) ∈R) ∧((y, z) ∈R)) ⇒((x, z) ∈R)].
A relation R is an equivalence relation on A if and only if R is reﬂexive,
symmetric, and transitive on A.
For a nonempty set A, the reﬂexive property is the only property which re-
quires some ordered pair to be in the relation R. The symmetric and transitive
properties merely specify conditions which the ordered pairs in the relation
must satisfy to be symmetric or transitive. Since the identity relation on A is
IA = {(x, x) | x ∈A}, a relation R is reﬂexive on A if and only if IA ⊆R.
Negating the above deﬁnitions, we ﬁnd
A relation R on a set A is not reﬂexive ⇔(∃x ∈A)((x, x) /∈R).
A relation R on a set A is not symmetric ⇔
(∃x, y ∈A)[((x, y) ∈R) ∧((y, x) /∈R)].
A relation R on a set A is not transitive ⇔
(∃x, y, z ∈A)[((x, y) ∈R) ∧((y, z) ∈R) ∧((x, z) /∈R)].
Thus, to show a relation R is not reﬂexive, we must ﬁnd a single x ∈A such
that (x, x) /∈R. To show that R is not symmetric, we must ﬁnd an x and y in
A such that (x, y) ∈R and (y, x) /∈R. To show R is not transitive, we must
ﬁnd some x, y, and z (not necessarily distinct) in A such that (x, y) ∈R,
(y, z) ∈R, and (x, z) /∈R.

Relations
177
Example 4.3.1 Consider the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3),(1, 2), (2,3)}
on the set A = {1, 2, 3}.
Reﬂexive:
S is reﬂexive on A, since IA = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3,3)} ⊂S.
Symmetric: S is not symmetric on A, since 1, 2 ∈A, (1, 2) ∈S, but (2, 1) /∈S.
Transitive: S is not transitive on A, since 1, 2, 3 ∈A, (1, 2) ∈S and (2, 3) ∈S,
but (1, 3) /∈S.
The relation S is reﬂexive, is not symmetric, and is not transitive on set A.
■
Example 4.3.2 The set T = {(1, 2), (2, 1)} is a relation on the set B = {1, 2}.
Reﬂexive:
T is not reﬂexive on B, since 1 ∈B but (1, 1) /∈T.
Symmetric: T is symmetric on B, because (1, 2) ∈T and (2, 1) ∈T and
because there are no other ordered pairs in T.
Transitive: T is not transitive on B, since 1, 2 ∈B, (1, 2) ∈T and (2, 1) ∈T,
but (1, 1) /∈T.
The relation T is not reﬂexive, is symmetric, and is not transitive on set B.
■
Example 4.3.3 Let A = {1, 2, 3} and V = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2,3)}.
Reﬂexive:
V is not reﬂexive on A, since 1 ∈A but (1, 1) /∈V .
Symmetric: V is not symmetric on A, since 1, 2 ∈A and (1, 2) ∈V , but
(2, 1) /∈V .
Transitive: V is transitive on A, since (1, 2) ∈V , (2, 3) ∈V and (1, 3) ∈V ,
and there are no two other ordered pairs in V of the form (a, b), (b, c).
The relation V is not reﬂexive, is not symmetric, but is transitive on set A.
■
Example 4.3.4
Let W be the relation W = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} on the set B =
{1, 2}.
Reﬂexive:
W is reﬂexive on B, since IB = W.
Symmetric: W is symmetric since (1, 1) ∈W implies (1, 1) ∈W and
(2, 2) ∈W implies (2, 2) ∈W.
Transitive: The hypothesis of the implication [((x, y) ∈W)∧((y, z) ∈W)] ⇒
((x, z) ∈W) is false for the relation W. Hence, the implication is true, and
W is transitive vacuously.
Since the relation W is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive on set B, W is an
equivalence relation on set B.
■
The empty relation ∅, which has no ordered pairs, is another example of an
equivalence relation. That is, the empty relation is reﬂexive, symmetric, and
transitive.

178
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Of course, relations do not need to be speciﬁed as a set of ordered pairs.
When a relation is speciﬁed in another manner, logical arguments must be
used in determining whether the relation is reﬂexive, symmetric, or transitive.
Example 4.3.5 Let L be the set of all lines in the Euclidean plane and let
̸⊥be the relation “is not perpendicular to.”
Reﬂexive:
Let ℓ∈L. The statement “ℓ̸⊥ℓ” is true, so the relation ̸⊥is
reﬂexive.
Symmetric: Let ℓ, m ∈L. The statement “If ℓ̸⊥m, then m ̸⊥ℓ” is true, so
̸⊥is symmetric.
Transitive: Let ℓ, m, n ∈L. The statement “If ℓ̸⊥m and m ̸⊥n, then ℓ̸⊥n”
is false, since ℓcould be perpendicular to n and the line m could be any line
other than ℓor n which passes through the point of intersection of the lines ℓ
and n. Thus, ̸⊥is not transitive.
Consequently, the relation ̸⊥is reﬂexive and symmetric, but not transitive on
set L.
■
Example 4.3.6 Consider the relation “is a multiple of” on the set of natural
numbers.
Reﬂexive:
For all n ∈N, n = 1 · n, so the statement “n is a multiple of n”
is true. Thus, “is a multiple of” is a reﬂexive relation on N.
Symmetric: Let m, n ∈N. The statement “If m is a multiple of n, then n
is a multiple of m” is false. A counterexample is m = 6 and n = 2, because
m = 3·n, but there is no natural number k such that n = k·m—that is, there
is no natural number k such that 2 = k · 6. Hence, the relation “is a multiple
of” is not symmetric on N.
Transitive:
Let m, n, p ∈N. “If m is a multiple of n and n is a multiple of
p, then m is a multiple of p” is a true statement. This is a theorem which we
proved earlier.
The relation “is a multiple of” is reﬂexive and transitive, but not symmetric
on N.
■
Example 4.3.7 The set Y = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3,2),(3, 3)} is a relation on the
set C = {1, 2, 3}.
Reﬂexive:
Y is not reﬂexive on C, since 1 ∈C but (1, 1) /∈Y .
Symmetric: Y is symmetric on C, because (2, 2) ∈Y and (2, 2) ∈Y , because
(2, 3) ∈Y and (3, 2) ∈Y , and because (3, 3) ∈Y and (3, 3) ∈Y .
Transitive: Y is transitive on C, since for all combinations of ordered pairs
of the form (a, b) ∈Y and (b, c) ∈Y the ordered pair (a, c) ∈Y . There
are eight combinations to verify. For instance, (2, 2) ∈Y , (2, 2) ∈Y , and
(2, 2) ∈Y . Also, (2, 2) ∈Y , (2, 3) ∈Y , and (2, 3) ∈Y . Verify the remaining
six combinations.
The relation Y is not reﬂexive, but is symmetric and transitive on set C.
■

Relations
179
Example 4.3.8 Let P be the set of all living people and consider the relation
“is the mother of.”
Reﬂexive:
For a ∈P, “a is the mother of a” is a false statement. Hence, the
relation “is the mother of” is not reﬂexive on set P.
Symmetric: Let a, b ∈P. The statement “If a is the mother of b, then b is the
mother of a” is false. Thus, the relation “is the mother of” is not symmetric
on set P.
Transitive: Let a, b, c ∈P. The statement “If a is the mother of b and b is the
mother of c, then a is the mother of c” is false, since a is the maternal grand-
mother of c. Consequently, the relation “is the mother of” is not transitive
on set P.
The relation “is the mother of” is not reﬂexive, is not symmetric, and is not
transitive on set P.
■
We have deﬁned three properties for relations—the reﬂexive property, the
symmetric property, and the transitive property. Given a relation, it is reﬂex-
ive or not, it is symmetric or not, and it is transitive or not. Consequently, a
relation may have any one of eight diﬀerent combinations of these properties.
So far, we have presented eight relations—one which has each of the possible
combinations of properties. Displayed in Table 4.1 is each type of relation
and an example which corresponds to that type. In the table, the symbol T
indicates the relation has the speciﬁed property, while the symbol F indicates
it does not.

Example 4.3.9 Let R be the relation deﬁned on the set of integers, Z, by
(a, b) ∈R ⇔|a| = |b|. Prove R is an equivalence relation on Z.
Proof: Let a ∈Z. Since |a| = |a|, (a, a) ∈R and R is reﬂexive on Z.
Suppose (a, b) ∈R. Then by deﬁnition of R, |a| = |b|. Since equality is a
reﬂexive relation, |b| = |a|. Hence, (b, a) ∈R and R is symmetric on Z.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Suppose (a, b) ∈R and (b, c) ∈R. Then by deﬁnition |a| = |b| and |b| = |c|.
Since equality is a transitive relation, |a| = |c|, (a, c) ∈R, and R is transitive
on Z.
Since R is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, R is an equivalence relation
on Z.
■
In previous examples, the elements of the set A were usually numbers, lines,
or people. That is, the elements of A were singular entities. In the following
example, the elements of A are ordered pairs. In general, the elements of A
may be almost anything.
Example 4.3.10 Let A = Z×Z, the Cartesian product of the set of integers.
Deﬁne the relation P on Z × Z by ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈P ⇔ab = cd. Prove P is
an equivalence relation on A.
Proof: For all a, b ∈Z, ab = ab. Consequently, for a, b ∈Z, ((a, b), (a, b)) ∈P
and P is reﬂexive.
Suppose ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈P. Then by deﬁnition of P, ab = cd. Since equality
is a reﬂexive relation, cd = ab. Hence, ((c, d), (a, b)) ∈P and P is symmetric.
Suppose ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈P and ((c, d), (e, f)) ∈P. Then by deﬁnition of
P, ab = cd and cd = ef. Since equality is a transitive relation, ab = ef, and
((a, b), (e, f)) ∈P. Consequently, P is transitive.
Since P is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, P is an equivalence relation
on Z × Z.
■
We now prove that the inverse relation of an equivalence relation is also an
equivalence relation.
Theorem 4.13 If E is an equivalence relation on the set A, then E−1 is an
equivalence relation on A.
Proof: Let a ∈A. Since E is an equivalence relation on A, (a, a) ∈E.
By deﬁnition of the inverse relation of E, (a, a) ∈E−1 also. Hence, E−1 is
reﬂexive on A.
Suppose (a, b) ∈E−1. Then (b, a) ∈E. Since E is an equivalence relation
on A, E is symmetric and (a, b) ∈E. Therefore, (b, a) ∈E−1 and E−1 is
symmetric on A.
Finally, suppose (a, b) ∈E−1 and (b, c) ∈E−1.
From the deﬁnition of
inverse relation it follows that (b, a) ∈E and (c, b) ∈E.
Since E is an
equivalence relation, E is transitive and (c, a) ∈E. Consequently, (a, c) ∈E−1
and E−1 is transitive on A.
Since E−1 is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, E−1 is an equivalence
relation on A.

Equivalence Relations, Equivalence Classes, and Par-
titions
It is easy to verify that the relation R = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2,1),(2, 2),(3,3),
(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4),(4, 6), (6,4), (5,5),(5, 6), (6,5), (6,6)} is an equivalence re-
lation on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6}. Observe that the element 1 ∈A is
R-related to the elements 1 and 2, since (1, 1) ∈R, (1, 2) ∈R, and (2, 1) ∈R.
Likewise, the element 2 is R-related to 1 and 2. The element 3 is R-related to
3, since (3, 3) ∈R. Because (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 4) ∈R, the element
4 is R-related to 4, 5, and 6. We also ﬁnd 5 is R-related to 4, 5, and 6 and 6
is R-related to 4, 5, and 6. Thus, associated with each element x ∈A there

is a set Sx which consists of all elements of A that are R-related to x. The
following table summarizes our ﬁndings for the given relation R on the given
set A.

Observe that S1 = S2, S4 = S5 = S6 and that A = S1 ∪S3 ∪S4. Assuming
A ̸= ∅, for any x ∈A the set Sx of elements which are R-related to x is
nonempty, because R is reﬂexive on A and therefore (x, x) ∈R. That is, if
A ̸= ∅and x ∈A, then x ∈Sx. Also notice that the equivalence relation R
subdivides the set A into subsets of R-equivalent elements. We formalize our
ﬁndings with the following two deﬁnitions.
Let R be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set A. For x ∈A, the
equivalence class of x determined by the relation R is the set
[x]R = {y ∈A | (x, y) ∈R}.
The set of all equivalence classes is called A modulo R (or A mod R) and
is denoted by
A/R = {[x]R | x ∈A}.
The mathematical expression [x]R = {y ∈A | (x, y) ∈R} which deﬁnes the
equivalence class of x modulo R is read “the equivalence class of x modulo
R is the set of all y in A such that (x, y) is in R.”
Any element y ∈A
which appears with x in any ordered pair of R is in the set [x]R.
When
it is obvious what relation R we are discussing, we will omit the subscript
R from the equivalence class notation—that is, we will abbreviate [x]R as
[x].
In the example above, the equivalence classes are [1] = [2] = {1, 2},
[3] = {3}, and [4] = [5] = [6] = {4, 5, 6}; and the set of all equivalence classes
is A/R = {{1, 2}, {3},{4,5,6}}.
Let A be a nonempty set and let A be a collection of subsets of A. The
collection of sets A is a partition of A if and only if
(1) X ∈A ⇒X ̸= ∅
(2) X ∈A and Y ∈A ⇒either X = Y or X ∩Y = ∅

States is partitioned geographically in several diﬀerent ways. It is partitioned
into states, into time zones, into zip code areas by the postal service, and into
area codes by the telephone companies.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
In the example we have been studying, the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6} is parti-
tioned by the relation R into the collection of sets
A = A/R = {{1, 2}, {3}, {4,5, 6}}.
In this section, we will study properties of equivalence relations on a set A,
properties of partitions of a set A, and the connection between equivalence
relations and partitions.
First, we prove the following theorem regarding
equivalence classes.
Theorem 4.14 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and
let a, b ∈A. If b ∈[a]R, then [b]R = [a]R.
Proof:
Assume b ∈[a]R. By the deﬁnition of an equivalence class (a, b) ∈R.
To show that [b]R = [a]R, we show [b]R ⊆[a]R and [a]R ⊆[b]R. Let x ∈[b]R.
By deﬁnition (b, x) ∈R. Since (a, b) ∈R and R is transitive on A, (a, x) ∈R
and, therefore, x ∈[a]R. Thus, [b]R ⊆[a]R. Now let y ∈[a]R. By deﬁnition
(a, y) ∈R. Since (a, b) ∈R and R is symmetric on A, (b, a) ∈R. Because
(b, a) ∈R, (a, y) ∈R, and R is transitive, (b, y) ∈R. Consequently, y ∈[b]R.
Hence, [a]R ⊆[b]R. Since [a]R ⊆[b]R and [b]R ⊆[a]R, [b]R = [a]R.

We state the following theorems for equivalence classes and leave them for
you to prove as exercises.
Theorem 4.15 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and
let a, b ∈A. Then [a]R = [b]R ⇔(a, b) ∈R.
Theorem 4.16 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and
let a, b ∈A. If [a]R ∩[b]R ̸= ∅, then [a]R = [b]R.
Theorem 4.17 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and
let a, b ∈A. If [a]R ∩[b]R = ∅⇔(a, b) /∈R.
Theorem 4.18 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and
let a, b, c, d ∈A. If c ∈[a]R, if d ∈[b]R, and if [a]R ̸= [b]R, then (c, d) /∈R.
The following theorem states that an equivalence relation R on a nonempty
set A produces a partition of A.
Theorem 4.19 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A. Then
A/R is a partition of A.
Proof:
To show that the collection of all equivalence classes
A/R = {[x]R | x ∈A}
is a partition of A, we must show three things:
(1) [x]R ∈A/R ⇒[x]R ̸= ∅
(2) [x]R ∈A/R and [y]R ∈A/R ⇒either [x]R = [y]R or [x]R ∩[y]R = ∅
(3) S
x∈A[x]R = A
(1) For each x ∈A, x ∈[x]R by deﬁnition. Hence, each equivalence class
[x]R in A/R is nonempty.

Relations
185
(2) For [x]R ∈A/R and [y]R ∈A/R either (i) [x]R ∩[y]R ̸= ∅or
(ii) [x]R ∩[y]R = ∅. In case (i) [x]R ∩[y]R ̸= ∅⇔(x, y) ∈R by the con-
trapositive of Theorem 4.17. By Theorem 4.15, (x, y) ∈R ⇔[x]R = [y]R.
Hence, [x]R ∩[y]R ̸= ∅⇔[x]R = [y]R.
(3) Consider S
x∈A[x]R. Since [x]R is a subset of A, S
x∈A[x]R ⊆A. Let y
be any element of A. Since y ∈[y]R, y ∈S
x∈A[x]R. Thus, A ⊆S
x∈A[x]R
and therefore A = S
x∈A[x]R.
Consequently, the collection of equivalence classes A/R (A modulo R) is a
partition of the set A.

Example 4.4.1
Let d be a positive integer and let ≡d be the relation
deﬁned on the set of integers, Z, by
m ≡d n ⇔there exists a k ∈Z such that m −n = kd.
The expression m ≡d n is read “m is congruent to n modulo d” or simply
“m is congruent to n mod d.” Sometimes this relation is written in the form
m ≡n(mod d) which is also read as stated above. An equivalent way to deﬁne
this relation is
m ≡d n ⇔m −n is divisible by d.
a. Prove congruence modulo d is an equivalence relation on Z.
b. Write the distinct equivalence classes of the equivalence relation m ≡4 n.
c. Write the partition Z/ ≡4.
Solution
a. Let d be a positive integer. Let m ∈Z. Since m −m = 0 = 0 · d, the
relation ≡d is reﬂexive.
Let m, n ∈Z and suppose m ≡d n. Then there exists a k ∈Z such that
m −n = k · d. Hence, n −m = (−k) · d. Since −k ∈Z, n ≡d m and the
relation ≡d is symmetric.
Let m, n, p ∈Z and suppose m ≡d n and n ≡d p. Then there exist
integers k1 and k2 such that m −n = k1 · d and n −p = k2 · d. Adding
these two equations, we ﬁnd m −p = k1 · d + k2 · d = (k1 + k2) · d. Since
Z is closed under addition, m ≡d p. That is, ≡d is transitive.
Since the relation ≡d is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive on Z, ≡d is
an equivalence relation on Z.
b. For d = 4, the distinct equivalence classes for the equivalence relation
≡4 are
[0] = {. . ., −12, −8, −4, 0, 4,8,12,. ..}
[1] = {. . ., −11, −7, −3, 1, 5,9,13,. ..}
[2] = {. . ., −10, −6, −2, 2, 6,10,14,. ..}
[3] = {. . ., −9, −5, −1, 3, 7,11,15,. ..}
c. The partition of Z corresponding to the equivalence relation ≡4 is
Z/ ≡4 = {[0], [1], [2],[3]}. ■

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The collection A = {{a, c}, {b, d},{e}} is a partition of the set A = {a, b, c,
d, e} because (1) each set in A is nonempty, (2) if X, Y ∈A, then either
X = Y or X ∩Y = ∅, and (3)
S
X∈A X = A.
How do we obtain the
relation R on the set A which corresponds to the partition A? Consider the
set {a, c} ∈A. For {a, c} to be an equivalence class of R, a must be R-related
to a, a must be R-related to c, c must be R-related to a, and c must be R-
related to c. That is, it must be the case that (a, a) ∈R, (a, c) ∈R, (c, a) ∈R,
and (c, c) ∈R. If we let A1 = {a, c}, we see we must have A1 × A1 ⊆R.
Likewise, we must have {b, d} × {b, d} ⊆R, and {e} × {e} ⊆R. Hence,
R = {(a, a), (a, c), (c, a), (c, c), (b,b),(b, d), (d,b), (d, d), (e, e)}.
Consequently, for a partition A which is a ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite sets, we
have a relatively simple technique for constructing an equivalence relation R
corresponding to the partition A. For every set A ∈A we form the Cartesian
product A × A.
The union of these sets of ordered pairs is the required
equivalence relation R.
Let A = R × R, the Cartesian plane, and for r ∈[0, ∞) deﬁne Cr =
{(x, y) | x2 + y2 = r2}. The collection C = {Cr | r ∈[0, ∞)} is a partition of
the plane. For r = 0, C0 = {(0, 0)}. That is, C0 contains only the origin of
the plane. For r > 0, Cr is the circle with center at the origin and radius r.
The collection C is a partition of the plane, because
(1) no Cr is empty (for any r ∈[0, ∞), (0, r) ∈Cr),
(2) Cr, Cs ∈C ⇒either Cr = Cs (which occurs when r = s) or Cr ∩Cs = ∅
(which occurs when r ̸= s),
(3) S
r∈[0,∞) Cr = R × R (for any (a, b) ∈R × R,
(a, b) ∈Cr where
r =
√
a2 + b2).
In this instance, the partition C contains an inﬁnite number of sets and each
set Cr, except for C0, contains an inﬁnite number of elements. The equivalence
relation R on R × R corresponding to the partition C is deﬁned as follows:
Let (x, y) and (u, v) be points in the plane. Deﬁne
((x, y), (u, v)) ∈R ⇔x2 + y2 = u2 + v2.
That is, (x, y) is R-equivalent to (u, v) if and only if (x, y) and (u, v) both lie
on the same circle whose center is at the origin.
By Theorem 4.19 an equivalence relation R on a set A yields a partition of
the set A. The next theorem, which is the converse of Theorem 4.19, states
that a partition of a set yields an equivalence relation on the set.
Theorem 4.20
Let P be a partition of a nonempty set A. For x, y ∈A
deﬁne the set R as follows:
(x, y) ∈R ⇔there exists an S ∈P such that x ∈S and y ∈S.
Then R is an equivalence relation on A.

Relations
187
Proof: Let a ∈A. Since A = S
S∈P S, there exists an S ∈P such that a ∈S.
Consequently, (a, a) ∈R and R is reﬂexive.
Suppose (a, b) ∈R. By deﬁnition a, b ∈S for some S ∈P. Obviously,
b, a ∈S and therefore (b, a) ∈R. Thus, R is symmetric.
Assume (a, b) ∈R and (b, c) ∈R. By deﬁnition there exists an S ∈P such
that a, b ∈S and there exists a T ∈P such that b, c ∈T. Since b ∈S ∩T,
S ∩T ̸= ∅, which by (2) in the deﬁnition of a partition implies S = T. Thus,
a, b, c ∈S and therefore (a, c) ∈R. That is, R is transitive.
■
From Theorems 4.19 and 4.20 it follows that a partition of a nonempty set
A is equivalent to an equivalence relation on the set A. Consequently, in any
given situation we may select and use the concept which most readily suits
our needs.

24. Statement. Theorem? Proof?
Statement: If A × B = A × C and A ̸= ∅, then B = C.
Proof? This theorem is analogous to the cancellation law of multiplica-
tion for the real numbers, which states “If a, b, and c are real numbers,
if a ̸= 0, and if a · b = a · c, then b = c.” Suppose A × B = A × C and
A ̸= ∅. Dividing by A ̸= ∅, we ﬁnd
A × B
A
= A × C

.
Consequently, B = C.
25. Statement. Theorem? Proof?
Statement: If A × B = A × C and A ̸= ∅, then B = C.
Proof? Suppose b ∈B and let a be any element in A. Then (a, b) ∈A×B.
Since A × B = A × C, the ordered pair (a, b) ∈A × C. Hence, b ∈C.
Therefore, B ⊆C.
In a like manner, we can show that C ⊆B.
Consequently, B = C.
26. Statement. Theorem? Proof?

If x ∈y/R and z ̸∈x/R, then z ̸∈y/R.
Proof?
We prove this theorem by contradiction.
Suppose x ∈y/R,
z ̸∈x/R, and z ∈y/R. Since x ∈y/R, yRx, and since R is symmetric,
xRy also. Since z ∈y/R, yRz, and since R is transitive, xRz. That is,
z ∈x/R. This contradicts the hypothesis z ̸∈x/R.

and z ∈x/R, then z ∈y/R. Consequently, if x ∈y/R and z ̸∈x/R,
then z ̸∈y/R.

Functions
Historically, the concept of a function evolved over time. The word “func-
tion” (or more precisely, its Latin equivalent) was used in mathematics for
the ﬁrst time in 1694 by Gottfried Leibniz. Initially, a function denoted any
quantity associated with a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the
curve, the slope of the curve, etc. By 1718 at the latest, Johann Bernoulli
(1667–1748) viewed a function as an expression which involves a variable and
some constants. Later, Euler thought of a function as an equation or for-
mula consisting of variables and constants.
In 1734, Euler introduced the
now familiar notation f(x) to denote a function in one variable. The present
set theoretic deﬁnition of a function is due mainly to Gustav Peter Lejeune
Dirichlet (1805–1859).
5.1
Functions
One of the more basic concepts which appears in virtually every branch of
mathematics is the concept of a function. Functions are a very special kind of
relation—that is, functions are very special kinds of sets of ordered pairs. Let
A and B be nonempty sets. Recall that a relation R from A to B is any subset
of the Cartesian product A × B. Given an element a ∈A there may be no
ordered pair in R which has a as ﬁrst coordinate, or there may be exactly one
ordered pair in R which has a as ﬁrst coordinate, or there may be any number
(up to the number of elements in B) of ordered pairs in R which have a as ﬁrst
coordinate. A function f from A to B is a relation from A to B such that every
a ∈A has a unique b ∈B such that the ordered pair (a, b) ∈f. That is, for
each element a ∈A there is a uniquely determined ordered pair (a, b) ∈f. We
state the following deﬁnitions of a function, domain of a function, codomain
of a function, and range of a function.
Let A and B be sets. A function f from A to B, denoted by f : A →B,
is a relation from A to B such that
(1) Dom(f) = A.
(2) If (a, b) ∈f and (a, c) ∈f, then b = c.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The domain of a function f from A to B is the set
Dom(f) = {x ∈A | (∃y ∈B)((x, y) ∈f)}.
The codomain of the function f from A to B is the set B.
The range of a function f from A to B is the set
Rng(f) = {y ∈B | (∃x ∈A)((x, y) ∈f)}.
From the deﬁnitions above, for a set of ordered pairs f to be a function
from A to B it is necessary that Dom(f) = A and Rng(f) ⊆B. Furthermore,
any set B which contains the Rng(f) may serve as the codomain of f. To
prove a set of ordered pairs f is not a function from A to B, we must show
either (i) Dom(f) ̸= A or (ii) there are two ordered pairs (a, b) and (a, c) in
f for which b ̸= c.
Let us consider the following four relations from the set A = {a, b, c} to
B = {1, 2, 3}.
R1 = {(a, 1), (b, 1)}
R2 = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 2)}
R3 = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c,3)}
R4 = {(a, 1), (a, 1), (b, 2), (c,3)}
R1 is a relation from A to B, but R1 is not a function from A to B, because
Dom(R1) = {a, b} ̸= A.
R2 is a relation from A to B and Dom(R2) = A. Only one ordered pair in
R2 has ﬁrst coordinate a—the ordered pair (a, 1). Likewise, there is only one
ordered pair in R2 with ﬁrst coordinate b and there is only one ordered pair
with ﬁrst coordinate c. Thus, by properties (1) and (2) in the deﬁnition of a
function, R2 is a function from A to B. The range of the function R2 is the
set {1, 2}, which is a subset of the codomain B.
R3 is a relation from A to B, but R3 is not a function. Although Dom(R3) =
A, there exist two distinct ordered pairs in R3 with the same ﬁrst coordinate
and diﬀerent second coordinates—namely, the pairs (a, 1) and (a, 2). So R3
is not a function.
R4 is a relation from A to B and Dom(R4) = A. There are exactly two
ordered pairs in R4 with the same ﬁrst coordinate—namely, the coordinate a.
However, they are not distinct ordered pairs. They are identical pairs. Thus,
R4 is a function. In this case, the codomain of R4 is B = Rng(R4). That is,
for this function the codomain and range are the same set.
Arrow diagrams for the relations R1, R2, R3, and R4 are displayed in
Figures 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, respectively. Notice in Figure 5.1 there is no
arrow which has its tail at c ∈A, so the relation R1 is not a function from
A to B, because Dom(R1) ̸= A. In Figure 5.2, for each element of A there is
an arrow which has its tail at that element, so Dom(R2) = A. Since there is
only one arrow with its tail at each element in A, there are no two ordered
pairs in R2 with the same ﬁrst coordinate and diﬀerent second coordinate.

That is, R2 is a function from A to B. We also see from Figure 5.2 that
Rng(R2) = {1, 2} ⊂B.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
In Figure 5.3, we observe that each element of A has at least one arrow
with its tail at that element. Thus, Dom(R3) = A. However, the element a
has two arrows with their tails at a. One of those arrows has its head at 1
and the other has its head at 2. Since 1 ̸= 2, the relation R3 is not a function.
Looking at Figure 5.4, we see Dom(R4) = A, since for each element in A there
is at least one arrow with its tail at the element. In this case, there are two
arrows with their tails at a, but the heads of both of those arrows are at 1.
So R4 is a function from A to B.
Let f be a function which has ordered pairs (x, y). Since f is a function, it
assigns to each x in its domain a unique y in its range. Therefore, we denote
y by f(x), read “f of x,” and we write y = f(x). Hence, a function is a
relation (a set of ordered pairs) which assigns to each element x in its domain
the unique value f(x) in its range. For this reason, we can write the function
f : A →B symbolically as follows:
f = {(x, f(x)) | x ∈A}.
It is important to understand the diﬀerence between the function f and its
value at x, f(x). The symbol f represents a set of ordered pairs, while f(x)
represents the value in the range of f assigned to the element x in the domain
of f. The following deﬁnitions should clarify this even more.
Let f be a function from A to B, f : A →B, and let (x, y) denote the
elements of f. The image of x under f is f(x). The image of x under f is
also called the value of f at x. The pre-image of y under f is x. Notice
that the image of x under f is a single element in the range of f, while the
pre-image of y under f is one or more elements in the domain of f. Consider,
for example, the function f = {(1, c), (2, a), (3, a)}. The image of 1 under f is
f(1) = c, the image of 2 under f is f(2) = a, and the image of 3 under f is
f(3) = a. The pre-image of c under f is 1, while the pre-images of a under f
are 2 and 3.
Let A be any subset of the universe U. The characteristic function of
the set A, denoted by χA, is the function χA : U →[0, 1] deﬁned by
χA(x) =
1, if x ∈A
0, if x /∈A
The image of any element in the set A is 1 and the image of any element in
the complement of A, the set A′, is 0. The pre-image of 1 is the set A and
the pre-image of 0 is the set A′. The symbol χ is the lower case Greek letter
“chi.”
Two functions f and g are equal, written f = g, if and only if Dom(f) =
Dom(g) and for all x ∈Dom(f), f(x) = g(x).
Recall from Chapter 4 that the identity relation on any nonempty set A is
IA = {(x, x) ∈A × A | x ∈A}.
Since the unique element associated with each element x ∈A is x itself—that
is, since IA(x) = x, the identity relation is a function from A to A. The

Functions
199
identity function on the natural numbers is IN = {(x, x) ∈N × N | x = x}
and the identity function on the integers is IZ = {(x, x) ∈Z × Z | x = x}.
The identity function IN ̸= IZ, because Dom(IN) = N ̸= Z = Dom(IZ).
Let f be a function with ordered pairs (x, y). The variable x is called the
independent variable and x may assume any value in the domain of f.
The variable x is also called the argument of f. The variable y is called the
dependent variable. The dependent variable y represents some value in the
range of f and “depends” on the value chosen for the independent variable.
A real-valued function is a function whose codomain is a subset of the
real numbers, R. When the domain of a real-valued function is also a subset
of the real numbers, the function is said to be “a real-valued function of a
real variable.” In calculus, many functions are real-valued functions of a real
variable.
Let A = {−1, 0, 1} and B = {0, 1}.
Deﬁne the real-valued function
f : A →B by f(x) = |x| and deﬁne the real-valued function g : A →B
by g(x) = x2. The domain of both functions f and g is the set A and for any
x ∈A, f(x) = g(x), so f = g on the domain A. Next, let C be the interval
[−1, 1] and D be the interval [0, 1]. Deﬁne h : C →D to be the function
h(x) = |x| and deﬁne k : C →D to be the function k(x) = x2. The domain
of both functions h and k is the set C and for 1
2 ∈A, h( 1
2) = 1
2 ̸= 1
4 = k( 1
2),
so the function h ̸= k on the domain C. Consequently, whether one function
equals another function or not depends on the domains of the functions.
When a function is a real-valued function of a real variable, we can graph
it on a Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system. Let f : R →R be deﬁned
by f(x) = x2. That is, let
f = {(x, y) ∈R × R | y = x2} = {(x, x2) | x ∈R}.
A graph of the function f is displayed in Figure 5.5. Observe that Dom(f) =
R, Rng(f) = [0, ∞], the image of 2 is 4, and the pre-image of 4 is −2 and 2.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Often a real-valued function of a real variable is deﬁned by a formula and
no information regarding the domain, range, or codomain is speciﬁed. In this
case, the usual convention is to assume that the domain of the function is the
set of all real numbers x for which the deﬁning expression f(x) is a real value.
For example, the function deﬁned by
f(x) = x + 2
x −3
is deﬁned for all real numbers x ̸= 3, so the domain of this function is R−{3}
or (−∞, 3) ∪(3, ∞). To determine the range, we solve the expression
y = x + 2
x −3
for x and ﬁnd
x = 3y + 2
y −1 .
Since the last equation is undeﬁned for y = 1, there is no pre-image of 1 and
the range of the function is R−{1} = (−∞, 1)∪(1, ∞). Likewise, the function
deﬁned by g(x) = √3x −6 has domain [2, ∞) and range [0, ∞). The function
deﬁned by h(x) = ln(9 −3x) has domain (−∞, 3) and range R. A graph of
the relation k = {(x, y) ∈R × R | y2 = x} is shown in Figure 5.6. Observe
that Dom (k) = [0, ∞). Also notice that the vertical line x = 4 intersects
the graph of k at the points (4, −2) and (4, 2), since (−2)2 = 4 and (2)2 = 4.
Consequently, k is a relation but not a function.

The following vertical line test is often useful in helping determine if a
relation on R is a function or not. However, the vertical line test does not
constitute a proof that a relation is or is not a function.
Vertical Line Test Let f be a relation on R.
If any vertical line intersects the graph of f in two or more points, then the
relation f is not a function.
If no vertical line intersects the graph of f in more than one point, then the
relation f is a function.

The next theorem states that the composition of two functions is a function.
Theorem 5.1 Let f be a function from A to B and let g be a function from
B to C; then g ◦f is a function from A to C.
Proof: Since f and g are functions, they are relations.
By deﬁnition of
composition for relations, g ◦f is a relation from A to C. From the deﬁnition
of a function, it follows that Dom(f) = A, Rng(f) ⊆B, Dom(g) = B, and
Rng(g) ⊆C. Assume x ∈A. Since Rng(f) ⊆B, there exists a y ∈B such
that (x, y) ∈f. Since Dom(g) = B and since Rng(g) ⊆C, there exists a z ∈C
such that (y, z) ∈g. Thus, by the deﬁnition of composition for relations, the
ordered pair (x, z) ∈g ◦f. Therefore, Dom(g ◦f) = A = Dom(f). Now
suppose (x, y), (x, z) ∈g ◦f. Hence, there exists a u ∈B such that (x, u) ∈f
and (u, y) ∈g and there exists a v ∈B such that (x, v) ∈f and (v, z) ∈g.
Since f is a function, (x, u) ∈f, and (x, v) ∈f, it follows that u = v. Since
g is a function, (u, y) ∈g, and (v, z) = (u, z) ∈g, it follows that y = z.
Therefore, g ◦f is a function from A to C, because (1) Dom(g ◦f) = A and
(2) (x, y), (x, z) ∈g ◦f implies y = z.
■
Let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. Then g ◦f is the function
g ◦f = {(a, c) ∈A × C | (∃b ∈B)[(a, b) ∈f) ∧((b, c) ∈g)]}.
Let (a, c) ∈g ◦f. Since f and g are functions, we may rewrite (a, b) ∈f as
b = f(a) and (b, c) ∈g as c = g(b). Then by substitution, (a, c) ∈g ◦f if
and only if c = g(f(a)). Thus, if f and g are functions, for all a ∈Dom(f),
(g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)). For instance, if f : R →R is deﬁned by f(x) = x2 and
g : R →R is deﬁned by g(x) = x + 1, then (g ◦f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x2) =
x2+1 for all x ∈R and (f ◦g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x+1) = (x+1)2 = x2+2x+1
for all x ∈R. Observe that g ◦f ̸= f ◦g on the domain R. As a matter
of fact, in this example, (g ◦f)(x) = (f ◦g)(x) only for x = 0. Verify this.
Earlier, we had seen that the composition of two relations is not commutative.
This example shows that the composition of two functions in not commutative
either.
The following theorem states that the composition of functions is associa-
tive.
Theorem 5.2 Let f be a function from A to B, let g be a function from B
to C, and let h be a function from C to D; then h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f.
Proof: In the proof of Theorem 5.1, we demonstrated that the domain of the
composition of two functions, g ◦f, is the domain of the function which is on
the right. Thus, Dom(g ◦f) = Dom(f) and Dom(h ◦(g ◦f)) = Dom(g ◦f) =
Dom(f). Likewise, Dom((h ◦g) ◦f) = Dom(f). Hence, both h ◦(g ◦f) and
(h ◦g) ◦f have the same domain—namely, Dom(f). Theorem 5.1 states that
the composition of two functions is a function. Hence, by two applications
of Theorem 5.1, g ◦f is a function and so is h ◦(g ◦f). Likewise, h ◦g is a
function and so is (h◦g)◦f. Thus far, we have shown h◦(g ◦f) and (h◦g)◦f
are both functions with the same domain. To show h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f we
choose an arbitrary x ∈A and perform the following computation.

202
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
(h ◦(g ◦f))(x) = h((g ◦f)(x)) = h(g(f(x))) = (h ◦g)(f(x)) = ((h ◦g) ◦f)(x).
Thus, for all x ∈A, (h ◦(g ◦f))(x) = ((h ◦g) ◦f)(x) and, consequently,
h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f. That is, composition of functions is associative.

Onto Functions, One-to-One Functions, and One-to-
One Correspondences
In this section we consider special classes of functions and general results
which hold for these classes. First, we deﬁne an onto function.
Let A and B be sets. A function f from A to B is onto (or surjective)
if and only if for every y ∈B there exists an x ∈A such that f(x) = y. We
denote that a function f from A to B is onto by writing f : A onto
−→B.
By deﬁnition, a function f : A →B is onto if and only if Rng(f) = B.
Also by deﬁnition, a function f is onto if and only if every element in the
codomain has an inverse image. Hence, whether or not a function is onto
depends upon the choice of the codomain, B. When Rng(f) = B, f is onto;
but, when Rng(f) ⊂B, f is not onto. It is always possible to make a function
onto by selecting its codomain to be its range. However, it may be diﬃcult
to actually specify the codomain explicitly. For example, it is not easy to
specify the range of the function f deﬁned on the natural numbers, N, by
f(n) = (n!)2/n. It is more convenient to just write f : N →R and not try to
specify the set Rng(f).
It follows from the deﬁnition that in order to prove a function f : A →B
is onto, we must show for arbitrary y ∈B how to select an x ∈A such that
f(x) = y. It also follows from the negation of the deﬁnition of onto that to
show a function f is not onto, we must show that there exists a y ∈b such
that for all x ∈A, f(x) ̸= y. The following examples illustrate how to prove
a function is onto or not onto.
The function f : Z →Z deﬁned by f(n) = 2n −1 is not onto, since there
is no integer in the domain Z such that f(n) = 2n −1 = 2. Notice that the
solution of the equation 2n−1 = 2 is n = 3
2 /∈Z. That is, 2 is in the codomain
Z, but there is no n in the domain Z such that f(n) = 2. Let O be the set
of odd integers and let g : Z →O deﬁned by g(n) = 2n −1. The function g
is onto. Let arbitrary m ∈O. Since m is odd, there exists a k ∈Z such that
m = 2k + 1. Solving 2n −1 = m = 2k + 1 for n, we ﬁnd n = k + 1. Since
k is an integer, n = k + 1 is an integer. In fact, it is the integer such that
g(n) = m. Verify this.

Example 5.2.1 Prove the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 2x −3 is
onto.
Solution
Let y be in the codomain R. Remark: We must ﬁnd an x in the domain
R such that f(x) = 2x −3 = y. Solving for x, we ﬁnd x = y + 3
2
. Since
y, 3, 2 ∈R and the real numbers are closed under addition and nonzero divi-
sion, x = y + 3
2
∈R. Computing, we see
f(x) = f(y + 3
2
) −3 = 2(y + 3
2
) −3 = (y + 3) −3 = y.
Hence, f is onto.
■
Remark:
Observe we have shown that given any y in the range R,
x = y + 3
2
∈R is the element in the domain which satisﬁes f(x) = y.
Example 5.2.2 Prove the function g : R →R deﬁned by g(x) = x2 −3
is not onto.
Solution
Since for all x ∈R, x2 ≥0, it follows x2 −3 ≥−3. Let y = −4 ∈R, the
codomain of g. Since for all x ∈R, x2 −3 ≥−3, there is no x in the domain
R such that g(x) = −4. Therefore, g is not onto.
■
The following Horizontal Line Test, which is similar in nature to the Vertical
Line Test, can be used to indicate if a function is onto a particular set or not.
The test itself does not constitute a proof that the function is onto or not. It
only gives an indication that the function may be onto or may not be onto.
Horizontal Line Test Let f be a function from A to B where A and B
are subsets of R .
If for every b ∈B the horizontal line {(a, b) ∈f | a ∈A} intersects the
graph of f in one or more points, then the function f is onto.
If for some b ∈B there is a horizontal line {(a, b) ∈f | a ∈A} which does
not intersect the graph of f in any point, then the function f is not onto.
Figure 5.7 is a graph of the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 2x −3.
Since every horizontal line through Figure 5.7 intersects the graph of f exactly
once, the function f appears to be onto.
Figure 5.8 is a graph of the function g : R →R deﬁned by g(x) = x2 −3.
Since the horizontal line through the point (0, −4) of Figure 5.8 does not
intersect the graph of g, the function g can be proven not to be onto R. From
the graph in Figure 5.8, it appears that if the range of g were changed from R
to [−3, ∞), then the newly deﬁned function would be onto the new codomain.

The next theorem states that the composition of two functions which are
onto is a function which is onto.
Theorem 5.3 If f : A onto
−→B and g : B onto
−→C, then g ◦f : A onto
−→C.
Proof: Let c ∈C. Since g is onto, there exists a b ∈B such that g(b) = c.
Also since f is onto, there exists an a ∈A such that f(a) = b. By substitution,
g(f(a)) = (g ◦f)(a) = c. Therefore, for every c ∈C, there exists an a ∈A
such that (g ◦f)(a) = c. Hence, the function g ◦f is onto.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
We state the following theorem and leave it for you to prove in the exercises.
Theorem 5.4 If f : A →B, g : B →C, and g ◦f : A onto
−→C, then g is onto.
Example 5.2.3
Prove the statement “If f : A →B, g : B →C, and
g ◦f : A onto
−→C, then f : A onto
−→B” is false.
Solution
Recall that to prove the statement P ⇒Q is false, we need to produce
an example in which P is true and Q is false. In this instance, we need to
exhibit three sets A, B, and C; a function f from A to B which is not onto;
and a function g from B to C such that g ◦f from A to C is onto. The best
counterexamples are those which are as simple as possible. So we will choose
A, B, and C to be small ﬁnite sets; f to be a subset of A×B which is not onto
B; and g to be a subset of B × C such that g ◦f is onto C. First, we select
A = {a}. Then so that f from A to B cannot be onto, we select B = {x, y}
and deﬁne f = {(a, x)}. So now we have a function f from set A to set B
which is not onto, because the element y ∈B has no pre-image. Since we want
g ◦f to be onto C, we can have only one element in C. So we let C = {c} and
deﬁne g = {(x, c), (y, c)} so that g ◦f = {(a, c)} is onto. Our counterexample
is complete. We have three sets A = {a}, B = {x, y}, C = {c}; a function
f = {(a, x)} from A to B which is not onto; and a function g = {(x, c), (y, c)}
from B to C such that g ◦f = {(a, c)} is onto.
■
For a relation f from A to B to be a function it is necessary that every
element of A appear exactly once as a ﬁrst coordinate in the ordered pairs of
f. For a function g from A to B to be onto, it is necessary that every element
of B appear at least once as a second coordinate in the ordered pairs of g. A
function h from A to B in which every element of B appears at most once as
a second coordinate in the ordered pairs of h is called a one-to-one function.
Thus, we have the following formal deﬁnition of a one-to-one function.
Let A and B be sets. A function f : A →B is one-to-one (or injective) if
and only if (x, y) ∈f and (z, y) ∈f implies x = z. We denote that a function
f from A to B is one-to-one by writing f : A 1-1
−→B. Using functional notation
instead of ordered pair notation, a function f : A →B is one-to-one if and
only if f(x) = f(z) implies x = z. We can give a direct proof that f is one-to-
one by assuming f(x) = f(z) and showing x = z. Or, we can give an indirect
proof by assuming x ̸= z and showing f(x) ̸= f(z).
Example 5.2.4 Prove the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 2x −3
is one-to-one.
Solution
Assume f(x) = f(z). That is, assume 2x −3 = 2z −3. Hence, 2x = 2z and
x = z, so the function f(x) = 2x −3 is one-to-one.
■

Functions
209
Example 5.2.5 Prove the function g : R →R deﬁned by g(x) = x2 −3 is
not one-to-one.
Solution
Let us see what happens if we attempt to prove g is one-to-one. We assume
g(x) = g(z). That is, we assume x2 −3 = z2 −3. Hence, (1) x2 = z2. Of
course, it is wrong to conclude from equation (1) that x = z and g is one-to-
one. Observe that one solution of equation (1) is x = 3 and z = −3. Hence,
we have the following counterexample to g being one-to-one: Let x = 3 and
z = −3. Then g(x) = g(3) = (3)2 −3 = 6 and g(z) = g(−3) = (−3)2 −3 = 6
but x ̸= z.
■
The following Horizontal Line Test for One-to-Oneness can be used to
indicate if a function is one-to-one or not. The test itself does not constitute
a proof that the function is one-to-one or not. It only gives an indication that
the function may be one-to-one or may not be one-to-one.
Let f be a function from A to B where A and B are subsets of R.
If for every b ∈B the horizontal line {(a, b) ∈f | a ∈A} intersects the
graph of f in at most one point, then the function f is one-to-one.
If for some b ∈B there is a horizontal line {(a, b) ∈f | a ∈A} which
intersects the graph of f in two or more points, then the function f is not
one-to-one.
Figure 5.7 is a graph of the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 2x−3 and
Figure 5.8 is a graph of the function g : R →R deﬁned by g(x) = x2−3. Since
every horizontal line through Figure 5.7 intersects the graph of f exactly once,
the function f appears to be one-to-one. Since the horizontal line through the
point (0, 6) of Figure 5.8 intersects the graph of g in two points, the function
g can be proven not to be one-to-one, as we have done already.
The next theorem states that the composition of two functions which are
one-to-one is a function which is one-to-one. We leave this theorem for you
to prove in the exercises.
Theorem 5.5 If f : A 1-1
−→B and g : B 1-1
−→C, then g ◦f : A 1-1
−→C.
The following theorem says if the composition of two functions is one-to-one,
then the right function of the composition must also be one-to-one.
Theorem 5.6
If f : A →B, g : B →C, and g ◦f : A 1-1
−→C, then f is
one-to-one.
Proof: Assume x, y ∈A and f(x) = f(z). Since f is a function from A to B,
Rng(f) ⊆B. Since g is a function from B to C, g(f(x)) = g(f(z)). That
is, (g ◦f)(x) = (g ◦f)(z). By hypothesis, the function g ◦f is one-to-one, so
x = z, and therefore the function f is one-to-one.
■
Some functions are neither onto nor one-to-one. For example, f : R →R
deﬁned by f(x) = x2 is not onto R and not one-to-one. Some functions are
onto but not one-to-one. For instance, g : R →[0, ∞) deﬁned by g(x) = x2 is

210
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
onto [0, ∞) but not one-to-one. Some functions are one-to-one but not onto.
As an example, h : [0, ∞) →R deﬁned by h(x) = √x is one-to-one but not
onto R. And some functions are onto and one-to-one. An example is the
function k : R →R deﬁned by k(x) = x is onto R and is one-to-one.
Let A and B be sets. A function f : A →B which is onto its codomain
B and is one-to-one is called a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection).
We denote that a function f from A to B is a one-to-one correspondence by
writing f : A 1-1
−→
onto B.
The following theorem is a direct consequence of Theorems 5.3 and 5.5.
Theorem 5.7 If f : A 1-1
−→
onto B and g : B 1-1
−→
onto C, then g ◦f : A 1-1

Theorem 5.8 follows directly from Theorems 5.4 and 5.6.
Theorem 5.8 If f : A →B, g : B →C, and g ◦f : A 1-1

onto C, then g : B onto
−→C
and f : A 1-1

Inverse of a Function
Recall that a relation R from A to B is any set of ordered pairs in A × B
and that the inverse relation R−1 from B to A is the relation deﬁned by
R−1 = {(b, a) | (a, b) ∈R}. Since every function f : A →B is a relation, f−1
is a relation from B to A. However, f−1 may not be a function, as the following
two examples illustrate. First, consider the function F : A →B where A =
{a}, B = {x, y}, and F = {(a, x)}. The inverse relation F −1 = {(x, a)} is a
relation from B to A; however, it is not a function since Dom (F −1) ̸= B—
there is no ordered pair in F −1 with ﬁrst element y. Consequently, for the
inverse of a function to be a function it is necessary that the codomain of the
function be the range of the function. That is, for the inverse of a function
to be a function it is necessary that the function be onto. Next, consider the
function G : C →D where C = {a, b}, D = {x}, and G = {(a, x), (b, x)}. The
inverse relation G−1 = {(x, a), (x, b)} is a relation from D to C; however, it
is not a function since (x, a), (x, b) ∈G−1 but a ̸= b. That is, for the inverse
of a function to be a function it is necessary that the function be one-to-one.
From these two examples, it is clear that for the inverse relation f−1 of a
function f to be a function it is necessary that f be onto and one-to-one. The
following theorem proves that these conditions are suﬃcient also.
Theorem 5.9 Let f : A →B be a function. Then the inverse relation f−1
from B to A is a function if and only if f is onto and one-to-one.
Proof: Assume f−1 is a function from B to A. First, we show f is onto
B. Let b ∈B. Since f−1 is assumed to be a function, there exists a unique
element a ∈A such that f−1(b) = a—that is, (b, a) ∈f−1. By deﬁnition of
the inverse relation, (a, b) ∈f. Hence, for every b ∈B there exists an a ∈A
such that f(a) = b and f is onto B. Next, we show f is one-to-one. Assume
(a1, b) ∈f and (a2, b) ∈f. This implies (b, a1) ∈f−1 and (b, a2) ∈f−1. Since
f−1 is assumed to be a function, a1 = a2 and, therefore, f is one-to-one.
Hence, f−1 is a function from B to A implies f is onto B and one-to-one.
Consequently, if f−1 is a function, f is a one-to-one correspondence from A
onto B.
To prove the converse, we assume the function f : A →B is a one-to-one
correspondence. To show that f−1 is a function from B to A, we must show
(1) Dom(f−1) = B and (2) if (b, a1) ∈f−1 and (b, a2) ∈f−1, then a1 = a2.
To prove (1), we assume b ∈B. Since f is onto B, there exists an a ∈A
such that f(a) = b. Hence, (a, b) ∈f, which implies (b, a) ∈f−1 for some
a ∈A—that is, b ∈Dom(f−1). To prove (2), we assume (b, a1) ∈f−1 and

Functions
213
(b, a2) ∈f−1, which implies (a1, b) ∈f and (a2, b) ∈f. Since f is one-to-one,
a1 = a2. Since (1) and (2) are true, f−1 is a function from B to A.
■
Example 5.3.1 Find an expression for the inverse of the function f : R →R
deﬁned by f(x) = x3 −2.
Solution
First, we prove f is a one-to-one correspondence by showing f is onto and
one-to-one.
Let y ∈R.
Solving the equation y = x3 −2 for x, we ﬁnd
x =
3√y + 2. Calculation then yields
f(
3p
y + 2) = (
3p
y + 2)3 −2 = (y + 2) −2 = y.
Since for all y ∈R, x =
3√y + 2 is such that f(x) = y, f is onto. Next, let
x, z ∈R and assume f(x) = f(z). Thus, x3 −2 = z3 −2. Adding 2, we get
x3 = z3, which implies x = z. Hence, f is one-to-one. By Theorem 5.9, f−1
is the inverse function of f. Since f is a relation, f−1 = {(y, x) | (x, y) ∈f}.
That is, f−1(y) = x
if and only if
y = f(x) = x3 −2. We solved this last
equation for x above when we showed f is onto. The solution is x =
3√y + 2
so f−1(y) =
3√y + 2.
■
The next theorem says “If f is a one-to-one correspondence from A onto
B, then f−1 is a one-to-one correspondence from B onto A.”
Theorem 5.10 If f : A 1-1
−→
onto B, then f−1 : B 1-1
−→
onto A.
Proof: To show f−1 is one-to-one, we assume f−1(b1) = f−1(b2) = a. Hence,
(b1, a) ∈f−1 and (b2, a) ∈f−1. From the deﬁnition of an inverse relation,
(a, b1) ∈f and (a, b2) ∈f. Since f is a function, b1 = b2, and therefore f−1
is one-to-one. To show f−1 is onto, we let a ∈A. Since f is a function from
A to B, there exists a b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈f, which implies (b, a) ∈f−1
for some b ∈B. Hence, f−1 is onto A.
■
The following theorem states that “If f is a one-to-one correspondence from
A to B and if g is a one-to-one correspondence from B to C, then the inverse
function of the composition g ◦f is the function (g ◦f)−1 = f−1 ◦g−1.”
Theorem 5.11 If f : A 1-1
−→
onto B and g : B 1-1
−→
onto C, then the function (g ◦f)−1 =
f−1 ◦g−1.
Proof: By Theorem 5.7 since f and g are one-to-one correspondences, g ◦f
is a one-to-one correspondence from A to C. By Theorem 5.10, (g ◦f)−1 is a
one-to-one correspondence from C to A. And since f and g are relations, by
Theorem 4.2, (g ◦f)−1 = f−1 ◦g−1.
■
Suppose f : A →B is a one-to-one correspondence. By Theorem 5.9, f−1
is a function from B to A and by Theorem 5.10, f−1 : B →A is a one-to-one
correspondence. By Theorem 5.7, if f : A →B is a one-to-one correspondence
and f−1 : B →A is a one-to-one correspondence, then f−1 ◦f is a one-to-one
correspondence from A to A and f ◦f−1 is a one-to-one correspondence from
B to B. In fact, as the following theorem states, f−1◦f = IA and f ◦f−1 = IB
where IA and IB are the identity functions on the sets A and B, respectively.

214
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Theorem 5.12 If f is a one-to-one correspondence from A to B, then
(1) f−1 ◦f = IA
and
(2) f ◦f−1 = IB.
Proof:
Remark: We prove (1) only. Since f is a one-to-one correspondence
from A to B, by Theorem 5.10, f−1 is a one-to-one correspondence from B to
A. Therefore, by Theorem 5.7, f−1 ◦f is a one-to-one correspondence from
A to A. Let a ∈A and suppose f(a) = b. Then a = f−1(b). Computing, we
ﬁnd
(f−1 ◦f)(a) = f−1(f(a)) = f−1(b) = a = IA(a).
Hence, (f−1 ◦f) = IA. Similarly, we can show f ◦f−1 = IB.
■
Given two functions f : A →B and g : B →A, we would like a test which
will tell us if they are inverse functions of one another or not. The last of the
following three theorems, Theorem 5.15, provides this test.
Theorem 5.13
If f : A →B,
g : B →A, and g ◦f = IA, then f is
one-to-one.
Proof: Let x, z ∈A and assume that f(x) = f(z). Applying g to both sides
of this equation, we obtain g(f(x)) = g(f(z))—that is, (g ◦f)(x) = (g ◦f)(z).
Since g ◦f = IA, x = z and f is one-to-one.
■
Theorem 5.14 If f : A →B, g : B →A, and f ◦g = IB, then f is onto B.
Proof: Let b ∈B and let x = g(b) ∈A. Computing, we ﬁnd f(x) = f(g(b)) =
(f ◦g)(b) = IB(b) = b. Hence, the function f is onto B, since for every b ∈B
there is an x = g(b) ∈A such that f(x) = b.
■
Theorem 5.15 If f : A →B, g : B →A, f ◦g = IB, and g ◦f = IA, then
f and g are one-to-one correspondences and f−1 = g.
Proof: It follows from Theorems 5.13 and 5.14 that f and g are one-to-one
correspondences. Remark: The result for g follows by interchanging f and
g and interchanging A and B in the statements of Theorems 5.13 and 5.14.
The following computation proves f−1 = g.
f−1 = f−1 ◦IB = f−1 ◦(f ◦g) = (f−1 ◦f) ◦g = IA ◦g = g. ■

Solution
By Theorem 5.15, the function g = f−1 if (1) for all x ∈R −{2}, g ◦f =
IR−{2} and (2) for all y ∈R −{3}, f ◦g = IR−{3}.
Let x ∈R −{2}; then

the computations above and Theorem 5.15 that f and g are both one-to-one
correspondences.

Often a function is not a one-to-one correspondence from its domain to
its codomain and therefore the inverse of the function is a relation and not a
function. In many such cases, we would like to modify the function and obtain
a new function which is similar to the original function and whose inverse is
a function. We can always modify a function and make it onto by changing
its codomain to its range, although, as we noted earlier, it may be diﬃcult to
actually specify the range explicitly. In order to modify a function and obtain
a new function which is one-to-one, it is often necessary to limit the domain
of the original function. The following deﬁnition provides the means for doing
this.
Let function be a f from A to B and let C ⊆A. The restriction of f to
C, denoted by f|C, is
f|C = {(x, y) | (x, y) ∈f and x ∈C}.
Clearly, the restriction of f to C is a function whose domain is the set C.
When g is a restriction of a function h, we may also say h is an extension
of g.
For example, let A = {a, b, c, d}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and deﬁne the function f
from A to B by f = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 3), (d,4)}. The function f is not onto
B because Rng(f) = {1, 3, 4} ̸= B. If we let g : A →C where C = {1, 3, 4}
is deﬁned by g = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 3), (d, 4)}, then g is onto C; however, g is
not one-to-one because (a, 1), (b, 1) ∈g. Observe that the restriction of g to
D = {a, c, d},
g|D = {(a, 1), (c, 3), (d, 4)} = h,
is a one-to-one correspondence from D onto C and h−1 = {(1, a), (3, c), (4, d)}.
Also observe that the restriction of g to E = {b, c, d},
g|E = {(b, 1), (c, 3), (d,4)} = k,
is a one-to-one correspondence from E onto C and k−1 = {(1, b), (3, c), (4, d)}.
Thus, it is possible for a function which is not one-to-one to have more than
one restriction which is one-to-one.
Recall from calculus that a real-valued function of a real variable f that is
deﬁned on an interval I is increasing on I if and only if for all x1, x2 ∈I

216
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
if x1 < x2, then f(x1) < f(x2). Also the function f is decreasing on I if
and only if for all x1, x2 ∈I if x1 < x2, then f(x1) > f(x2). We leave the
following fact as an exercise for you to prove: “If f is increasing or decreasing
on an interval I, then f is one-to-one on the domain I.” Consider the function
f deﬁned by f(x) = |x + 2| + 3. For x ≥−2, |x + 2| = x + 2 and for x < −2,
|x + 2| = −(x + 2) = −x −2. So
f(x) = |x + 2| + 3 =

x + 5,
if x ≥−2
−x + 1, if x < −2
Notice that f|[−2,∞) is an increasing function from the domain [−2, ∞) onto
the range [3, ∞), and therefore a one-to-one correspondence whose inverse
function is deﬁned by (f|[−2,∞))−1(y) = y −5. Also notice that f|(−∞,−2) is a
decreasing function from (−∞, −2] onto the range [3, ∞) and therefore a one-
to-one correspondence whose inverse function is deﬁned by (f|(−∞,−2))−1(y) =
1 −y.

Images and Inverse Images of Sets
Earlier, we noted that if f : A →B is a function and y = f(x), then y is
the image of x under f and x is the pre-image of y under f. These concepts
extend naturally from elements to sets as follows.
Let f be a function from A to B, f : A →B. If X ⊆A; then the image
of X or image of the set X, denoted by f(X), is
f(X) = {y ∈B | y = f(x) for some x ∈X}.
If Y ⊆B, then the inverse image of Y , denoted by f−1(Y ), is
f−1(Y ) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈Y }.
By deﬁnition, the image of the set X under the function f, f(X), is the set
of all images of the elements of X. The set f(X) is a subset of Rng(f) ⊆B.
The inverse image of the set Y under the function f, f−1(Y ), is the set of all
pre-images of the elements of Y . The set f−1(Y ) ⊆A. Figure 5.12 graphically
illustrates this situation.

The next theorem follows easily from the deﬁnitions of image and inverse
image of sets.
Theorem 5.16 Let f : A →B,
C ⊆A,
D ⊆B, and x ∈A. Then
a. f(∅) = ∅
b. f−1(∅) = ∅
c. f({x}) = {f(x)}
d. x ∈C ⇒f(x) ∈f(C)
e. x ∈f−1(D) ⇒f(x) ∈D
f. f(x) ∈D ⇒x ∈f−1(D)
Example 5.4.1
Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, let B = {a, b, c, d}, and let f : A →B be deﬁned by
f = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b), (4, b), (5, c)}. Find a. f(C) for C = {2, 4}, b. f(A),
c. f−1(D) for D = {b, c}, d. f−1({d}), and e. f−1(B).

Solution

{a, b, c} = Rng(f)
c. f−1(D) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈D} = {x ∈A | f(x) = b or f(x) = c} = {3, 4, 5}
d. f−1({d}) = {x ∈A | f(x) = d} = ∅
e. f−1(B) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈B} = {x ∈A | f(x) = a or f(x) = b or f(x) =

Example 5.4.2 Let f : R →R be deﬁned by y = f(x) = |x| −1. Find
a. f((3, 5])
and
b. f−1((2, 4]).
Solution
a.
A graph of y = f(x) = |x| −1 is displayed in Figure 5.13. First, we
marked the interval (3, 5] on the x-axis. Since 3 /∈(3, 5], we drew a dashed
vertical line from the point (3, 0) to the graph of y = f(x). The vertical line
x = 3 intersected the graph at the point (3, 2). We projected the point (3, 2)
onto the y-axis by drawing the dashed horizontal line y = 2. Next, since
5 ∈(3, 5], we drew the solid vertical line from the point (5, 0) to the graph of
y = f(x). The line x = 5 intersected the graph at the point (5, 4). We then
projected the point (5, 4) onto the y-axis by drawing the line y = 4. From
Figure 5.13, it appears that f((3, 5]) = (2, 4]. To prove this we must show
that (1) f((3, 5]) ⊆(2, 4] and (2) (2, 4] ⊆f((3, 5]).
(1) Let y ∈f((3, 5]). By deﬁnition, there exists an x ∈(3, 5] such that
f(x) = y or |x|−1 = y. For x ∈(3, 5], |x| = x, so there exists an x ∈(3, 5] such

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
that x−1 = y. Since x ∈(3, 5], 3 < x ≤5 and therefore 3−1 < x−1 ≤5−1
or 2 < y ≤4—that is, y ∈(2, 4].
(2) Let y ∈(2, 4]. We must ﬁnd an x ∈(3, 5] such that f(x) = y = |x| −1.
Since for x ∈(3, 5], |x| = x, we must ﬁnd an x ∈(3, 5] such that y = x −1.
Solving for x, we see x = y + 1. Since y ∈(2, 4], 2 < y ≤4, and therefore
2+1 < y+1 ≤4+1 or 3 < x ≤5. That is, if y ∈(2, 4], then x = y+1 ∈(3, 5].
Since by (1) f((3, 5]) ⊆(2, 4] and by (2) (2, 4] ⊆f((3, 5]), it follows that
f((3, 5]) = (2, 4]
b. A second graph of y = f(x) = |x| −1 is shown in Figure 5.14. We marked
the interval (2, 4] on the y-axis and drew horizontal lines through the points
(0, 2) and (0, 4) to the graph of y = f(x). These lines intersected the graph
at the points (−5, 4), (−3, 2), (3, 2), and (5, 4). Projecting these points onto
the x-axis, it appears from Figure 5.14 that f−1((2, 4]) = [−5, −3) ∪(3, 5].
The proof that f−1((2, 4]) = [−5, −3) ∪(3, 5] is as follows:
x ∈f−1((2, 4]) ⇔f(x) ∈(2, 4] ⇔2 < |x| −1 ≤4
⇔3 < |x| ≤5 ⇔3 < x ≤5 or 3 < −x ≤5
⇔3 < x ≤5 or −5 ≤x < −3 ⇔x ∈(3, 5] or x ∈[−5, −3)
⇔x ∈[−5, −3) ∪(3, 5].

This example proves that the following statement is false: (*) “If f : A →B,
if C ⊆A, and if D ⊆B, then f(C) = D ⇒C = f−1(D).” That is, this
example is a counterexample to the statement (*).
■
The next example examines the relationship between the images and inverse
images of unions and intersections of sets and the unions and intersections of
sets of images and inverse images.

Functions
223
Example 5.4.3
Let A = {a, b, c, d, e}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, C = {a, b}, D =
{b, c},
E = {1, 2},
F = {2, 4}, and let f : A →B be deﬁned by f =
{(a, 2), (b, 1), (c, 2),(d, 3), (e, 2)}.
a. Find f(C ∪D) and f(C) ∪f(D). How are they related?
b. Find f(C ∩D) and f(C) ∩f(D). How are they related?
c. Find f−1(E ∪F) and f−1(E) ∪f−1(F). How are they related?
d. Find f−1(E ∩F) and f−1(E) ∩f−1(F). How are they related?
Solution
a. C ∪D = {a, b} ∪{b, c} = {a, b, c}.
So f(C ∪D) = f({a, b, c}) =
{f(a), f(b), f(c)} = {2, 1}.
f(C) = f({a, b}) = {f(a), f(b)} = {2, 1} and
f(D) = f({b, c}) = {f(b), f(c)} = {1, 2}.
So f(C) ∪f(D) = {1, 2}. Thus, in this instance, f(C ∪D) = f(C) ∪f(D).
b. C ∩D = {a, b} ∩{b, c} = {b}. So f(C ∩D) = f({b}) = {f(b)} = {1}.
From part a, f(C) = {2, 1} and f(D) = {1, 2}, so f(C) ∩f(D) = {1, 2}.
In this example, f(C ∩D) = {1} ⊂{1, 2} = f(C) ∩f(D).
c. E ∪F = {1, 2} ∪{2, 4} = {1, 2, 4}. And f −1(E ∪F) = f−1({1, 2, 4}) =
{x ∈A | f(x) = 1 or f(x) = 2, or f(x) = 4} = {b, a, c, e}.
f−1(E) = f−1({1, 2}) = {x ∈A | f(x) = 1 or f(x) = 2} = {b, a, c, e}.
f−1(F) = f−1({2, 4}) = {x ∈A | f(x) = 2 or f(x) = 4} = {a, c, e}.
So f−1(E) ∪f−1(F) = {b, a, c, e}.
In this case, f−1(E ∪F) = f−1(E) ∪f−1(F).
d. E ∩F
= {1, 2} ∩{2, 4} =
{2} and f−1(E ∩F) = f−1({2}) =
{x ∈A | f(x) = 2} = {a, c, e}.
From part c, f−1(E) = {b, a, c, e} and f−1(F) = {a, c, e}, so f−1(E∩F) =
{a, c, e}.
For this example, f−1(E ∩F) = f−1(E) ∩f−1(F).
■
The following theorem, which applies to the previous example, indicates
how to calculate the image and inverse image of the unions and intersections
of sets.
Theorem 5.17 Let f : A →B, let C, D ⊆A, and let E, F ⊆B. Then
a. f(C ∪D) = f(C) ∪f(D)
b. f(C ∩D) ⊆f(C) ∩f(D)
c. f−1(E ∪F) = f−1(E) ∪f−1(F)
d. f−1(E ∩F) = f−1(E) ∩f−1(F)
Proof:
Remark:
We will prove parts b and d.
b. Let y ∈f(C ∩D). By deﬁnition, y = f(x) for some x ∈C ∩D. Thus,
y = f(x) for some x ∈C and x ∈D. Since x ∈C, f(x) ∈f(C) and since
x ∈D, f(x) ∈f(D). Consequently, y = f(x) ∈f(C) ∩f(D).

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
d. For every x ∈A,
x ∈f−1(E ∩F) ⇔f(x) ∈E ∩F ⇔f(x) ∈E and f(x) ∈F
⇔x ∈f(E) and x ∈f(F) ⇔x ∈f(E) ∩f(F).

The next theorem states the relationship between the inverse image of the
diﬀerence of two sets and the diﬀerence of their inverse images.
Theorem 5.18 Let f : A →B and let E, F ⊆B. Then
f−1(E −F) = f−1(E) −f−1(F).
Proof:
x ∈f−1(E −F) ⇔f(x) ∈E −F ⇔f(x) ∈E and f(x) /∈F
⇔x ∈f−1(E) and x /∈f−1(F)
⇔x ∈f−1(E) −f−1(F).

Proof? Suppose (x, y) ∈R × R. Then x ∈R and y ∈R. Since 4 ∈R
and 5 ∈R, 4x ∈R, 5y ∈R, and 4x + 5y ∈R. Consequently, the
function f is onto.

f is one-to-one.

Chapter 6
Mathematical Induction
In this chapter, we examine Peano’s ﬁfth axiom, also known as the Axiom
of Induction, and explore the consequences of this axiom. Among the con-
sequences are four versions of the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the
Well-Ordering Principle for the set of the natural numbers, and the Funda-
mental Theorem of Arithmetic. It is diﬃcult, if not impossible, to determine
when the very ﬁrst proof by induction was employed.
In 1202, Leonardo
Pisano Bigollo (1180–1250), also known as Leonardo of Pisa and after his
death called Fibonacci, used induction in his Book of the Abacus to prove
6(12 + 22 + 32 + · · · + n2) = n(n + 1)(n + n + 1). In 1321, Levi Ben Gershon
(1288–1344) completed The Art of the Calculator in which several proposi-
tions were proven using mathematical induction. In 1654, the French mathe-
matician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) gave the ﬁrst deﬁnitive explanation of the
method of mathematical induction. However, the name “mathematical induc-
tion” was not associated with this method of proof until August De Morgan
(1806–1871) published his article on “Induction (Mathematics)” in the Penny
Cyclopaedia of 1838.
6.1
Mathematical Induction
In Chapter 2, we stated the axioms P1–P5, which the Italian mathematician
and logician Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) used in his axiomatic development
of the set of natural numbers.
The following axiom, called the Axiom of
Induction, is a rewording of Peano’s ﬁfth axiom, P5.
Axiom of Induction If S ⊆N satisfying the two properties
(1) 1 ∈S
(2) for all n ∈N, n ∈S ⇒n + 1 ∈S,
then S = N.
The Fundamental Theorem of Mathematical Induction, stated be-
low, follows immediately from the Axiom of Induction.
For each n ∈N, let P(n) be a statement which is either true or false but
not both.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Let S = {n ∈N | P(n) is true}.
If (i) 1 ∈S and
if (ii) for all n ∈N, n ∈S ⇒n + 1 ∈S,
then S = N. (That is, for all n ∈N the statement P(n) is true.)
Example 6.1.1 illustrates how to use the Fundamental Theorem of Math-
ematical Induction to prove for all n ∈N that the statement P(n) is true.
Notice in this example, we ﬁrst prove that (i) 1 ∈S and then we prove that
(ii) for any n ∈N, if n ∈S, then n + 1 ∈S.
Example 6.1.1 Prove for all n ∈N that 1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
.
Proof: Let P(n) be the statement 1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
and let
S = {n ∈N | P(n) is true}.
(i) Remark: First we prove that 1 ∈S.
For n = 1, the left-hand side
of the statement P(1) is 1 and the right-hand side is 1(1 + 1)
2
= 2
2 = 1.
Consequently, P(1) is true and 1 ∈S.
(ii) Remark: Next, we prove that for n ∈N,
n ∈S ⇒n + 1 ∈S. Let
n ∈N and assume that n ∈S. Hence, P(n), which is
(1)
1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
is assumed to be true. The statement P(n + 1), which we must prove to be
true using (1), is
(2)
1 + 2 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = (n + 1)((n + 1) + 1)
2
= (n + 1)(n + 2)
2
.
Grouping the summands on the left-hand side of (2) as shown below and then
substituting from (1), we ﬁnd
(1 + 2 + · · · + n) + (n + 1) = n(n + 1)
2
+ (n + 1)
= (n + 1)
n
2 + 1

= (n + 1)(n + 2)
2
.
That is, if (1) is true, it follows that (2) is true and therefore n + 1 ∈S.
Since the hypotheses (i) and (ii) of the Fundamental Theorem of Mathe-
matical Induction are true, the conclusion S = N is true. Consequently, the
statement P(n) is true for all n ∈N—that is, 1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
for
all n ∈N.
■
Instead of deﬁning S to be the set of all natural numbers n such that
the statement P(n) is true, proofs by mathematical induction are usually
presented in the following logically equivalent, but less formal, form.

Mathematical Induction
233
The Principle of Mathematical Induction For each n ∈N, let P(n)
be a statement which is either true or false but not both.
If (i) P(1) is true and
if (ii) for all n ∈N, P(n) is true ⇒P(n + 1) is true,
then the statement P(n) is true for all n ∈N.
Step (i) above is called the basis step or initial step and step (ii) is called
the inductive step. The hypothesis of the inductive step, “P(n) is true,” is
known as the inductive hypothesis.
Imagine that each statement P(n) is a domino in a chain of dominoes. In
the induction step, step (ii) of mathematical induction, we are proving that
if one domino in the chain, P(n), is knocked over, it will knock over the next
domino in the chain, P(n + 1). When dominoes are set up so that when
one domino falls, the next domino in the chain will fall, none will fall unless
the ﬁrst domino, P(1), falls. This is why we need the basis step in a proof
by mathematical induction. The basis step, step (i), ensures that the ﬁrst
domino will fall, while the inductive step, step (ii), ensures that all dominoes
after the ﬁrst domino will fall.
The next example shows how to use the Principle of Mathematical Induction
to prove for all n ∈N that the statement P(n) is true.
Example 6.1.2 Prove for all n ∈N that 12+32+· · ·+(2n−1)2 = n(4n2 −1)
3
.
Proof: Let P(n) be the statement
(1)
12 + 32 + · · · + (2n −1)2 = n(4n2 −1)
3
.
(i) For n = 1, the left-hand side of the statement P(1) is 1 and the right-
hand side is
1(4(1)2 −1)
3
= 1 · 3
3
= 1.
So, P(1) is true.
(ii) Let n ∈N and assume that the statement P(n) is true. That is, for
n ∈N assume that (1) is true. The statement P(n + 1) is the statement
12 + 32 + · · · + (2n −1)2 + (2(n + 1) −1)2 = (n + 1)(4(n + 1)2 −1)
3
.
Substituting (1) into the left-hand side of P(n + 1), we obtain
(2)
12 + 32 + · · · + (2n −1)2 + (2(n + 1) −1)2 =
[12 + 32 + · · ·+ (2n −1)2] + (2n + 1)2 = n(4n2 −1)
3
+ 3(2n + 1)2
3
=
4n3 −n + 12n2 + 12n + 3
3
= 4n3 + 12n2 + 11n + 3
3
.

234
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Expanding the right-hand side of P(n + 1), we ﬁnd
(n + 1)(4(n + 1)2 −1)
3
= (n + 1)(4n2 + 8n + 3)
3
(3)
= 4n3 + 12n2 + 11n + 3
3
.
Because the right-hand sides of (2) and (3) are equal, it follows from the
Principle of Mathematical Induction that for all n ∈N,
12 + 32 + · · · + (2n −1)2 = n(4n2 −1)
3
. ■
Some statements Q(n) are false for some or all n = 1, 2, . . ., n0 −1 but
are true for all n = n0, n0 + 1, . . .. The generalized principle of mathematical
induction stated below can be used to prove statements of the form “For all
n ∈N with n ≥n0, the statement Q(n) is true.”
The Generalized Principle of Mathematical Induction
For each
n ∈N, let Q(n) be a statement which is either true or false but not both.
If (i) Q(n0) is true and
if (ii) for all n ∈N with n ≥n0, Q(n) is true ⇒Q(n + 1) is true,
then for all natural numbers n ≥n0, the statement Q(n) is true.
It is easy to see that the principle of mathematical induction and the gener-
alized principle of mathematical induction are logically equivalent by setting
P(n) = Q(n + n0 −1) for all n ∈N. In the next example, we demonstrate
how to use the generalized principle of mathematical induction.
Example 6.1.3 Prove for all n ∈N with n ≥5 that 2n > n2.
Proof: Let Q(n) be the statement 2n > n2.
(i) For n = 5, we have 25 = 32 > 25 = 52, so the statement Q(5) is true.
(ii) Assume for n a natural number greater than or equal to 5 that the
statement Q(n) is true—that is, for n ∈N and n ≥5 assume that (1) 2n > n2.
We must now prove the statement Q(n + 1) is true. Thus, given (1) is true,
we must prove that (2) 2n+1 > (n + 1)2. Multiplying equation (1) by 2, we
ﬁnd
(3)
2 · 2n = 2n+1 > 2n2.
If we can show for n ≥5 that 2n2 ≥(n + 1)2, we are done. Assume that
(4) n ≥5. Multiplying (4) by n, we ﬁnd n2 ≥5n. And multiplying (4) by 3,
we ﬁnd 3n ≥15. Consequently, for n ≥5 we have
2n2 = n2+n2 ≥n2+5n = n2+2n+3n ≥n2+2n+15 > n2+2n+1 = (n+1)2.

The Well-Ordering Principle and the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic
Three consequences of the Axiom of Induction are the Fundamental The-
orem of Mathematical Induction, The Principle of Mathematical Induction,
and the Generalized Principle of Mathematical Induction. Another important
consequence is the Well-Ordering Principle for the natural numbers, which we
now prove by contradiction using mathematical induction.
The Well-Ordering Principle Every nonempty subset of natural numbers
has a least element.
Proof: Let T ̸= ∅be a subset of N. Suppose T does not have a least element
and let S = N −T.
(i) Since 1 is the least element of N and since T is a subset of N with no
least element, 1 /∈T. Consequently, 1 ∈S.
(ii) Suppose n ∈S. It follows from the deﬁnition of S that n /∈T. Also, no
natural number k less than n is in T. For if any natural number or numbers
less than n were in T, then T would have a least element. Since n /∈T and no
k less than n is in T, n + 1 /∈T; otherwise, n + 1 would be the least element
in T. Hence, n + 1 ∈S. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, S = N
and consequently T = ∅. Contradiction. ■
We devote the remainder of this section to proving the Fundamental The-
orem of Arithmetic. First, we restate the deﬁnitions of a divides b, prime
number, and composite number. Then, we state and prove some facts we
need in order to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Let a and b be integers. The number a divides b if and only if there exists
an integer c such that ac = b. If a divides b, then we also say a is a factor
of b and b is divisible by a.
A prime number (or simply a prime) is a natural number greater than
one which is divisible only by itself and one.
A composite number (or simply a composite) is a natural number
greater than one which is not a prime number.
The natural number 1 has special status among the natural numbers. It
is not a prime number and it is not a composite number. All other natural
numbers are either prime or composite but not both. Observe that 1 and a
divide the natural number a, since 1a = a and that the only natural number

Mathematical Induction
237
which is a factor of 1 is 1 itself. Notice that if the natural number a ̸= b divides
the natural number b, then 1 < a < b. For if ac = b and a ̸= b, then the
natural number c > 1. Multiplying this inequality by a, we have b = ac > a.
It follows directly from the deﬁnition of composite that the natural number
n is composite if and only if there exist natural numbers a and b such that
n = ab where 1 < a < n and 1 < b < n.
We use the Well-Ordering Principle in the following example.
Example 6.2.1 Prove for all n ∈N that 3 divides n3 −n.
Proof: Suppose there is an m ∈N such that 3 does not divide m3 −m. By
the Well-Ordering Principle there is a least element, call it s, such that 3 does
not divide s3 −s. Since 3 divides 13 −1 = 0, s > 1. The natural number
s −1 is less than s, so 3 divides [(s −1)3 −(s −1)]. Also, 3 divides 3(s2 −s).
Hence, 3 divides the sum
[(s −1)3 −(s −1)] + 3(s2 −s) = s3 −3s2 + 3s −1 −s + 1 + 3s2 −3s = s3 −s.
That is, 3 divides s3 −s. Contradiction. ■
The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers is deﬁned as follows.
Let a and b be two nonzero integers. The natural number d is the greatest
common divisor of a and b, denoted by gcd(a, b), if
(i) d divides both a and b and
(ii) every divisor of both a and b is a divisor of d.
In Theorem 6.1 we prove that two nonzero integers a and b always have a
greatest common divisor. It is easy to prove that the greatest common divisor,
if it exists, is unique. Suppose, to the contrary, there exist two distinct natural
numbers d and d′ satisfying the deﬁnition of the greatest common divisor. By
part (ii) of the deﬁnition, d divides d′ and also d′ divides d. Therefore, since
d and d′ are natural numbers, d = d′.
In order to prove the existence of the gcd(a, b), we need the concept of a
linear combination of a and b.
Let a and b be two integers; then any integer of the form ax + by where x
and y are integers is a linear combination of a and b.
The following theorem establishes the existence of the gcd(a, b) and provides
a representation for it.
Theorem 6.1 If a and b are nonzero integers, then the least natural number d
which can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b is the gcd(a, b). That
is, if d = gcd(a, b), then there exist integers x1 and y1 such that d = ax1 +by1
and d is the least natural number which is expressible in this form.
Proof: Let S = {ax + by | x, y ∈Z and ax + by > 0}. Since a and b are
nonzero integers, a2 + b2 > 0 and S ̸= ∅.
By the Well-Ordering Princi-
ple, S has a least element, say, d = as + bt. We claim d = gcd(a, b). By
the division algorithm, there exist integers q and r such that (1) a = dq + r

238
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
where 0 ≤r < d. Assume that 0 < r < d. Then from (1),
r = a −dq = a −(as + bt)q = a −asq −btq = a(1 −sq) + b(−tq) ∈S.
This contradicts d is the least element of S. Consequently, r = 0 and from
equation (1), a = dq—that is, d divides a. A similar argument shows d divides
b also. By deﬁnition and our previous uniqueness proof, d is the gcd(a, b).
■
The next lemma appeared in Euclid’s Elements and is known as Euclid’s
Lemma.
Euclid’s Lemma: If a and b are two nonzero integers and if p is a prime
which divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b.
Proof: Suppose p does not divide a. Since the only factors of p are 1 and p
and since p does not divide a, the greatest common divisor of p and a is 1. By
Theorem 6.1 there exist integers x and y such that 1 = ax + by. Multiplying
this equation by b, we obtain b = abx + bpy. Since p divides ab, p divides the
right-hand side of this equation. Hence, p divides b.
■
The following lemma is a generalization of Euclid’s Lemma.
Lemma 6.1 For a natural number m ≥2, if p is a prime, if a1, a2, . . . ,
am are all nonzero integers, and if p divides the product a1a2 · · ·am, then p
divides ai for some i ∈{1, 2, . . ., m}.
Proof: Remark: We prove this lemma using the generalized principle of
mathematical induction on m.
(i) For m = 2, this lemma is true, since it is Euclid’s Lemma.
(ii) Suppose this lemma is true for some k ≥2. That is, assume if p is a
prime which divides a1a2 · · ·ak, then p divides ai for some i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k}.
Let a1, a2, . . ., ak+1 be nonzero integers and let p divide the product
a1a2 · · ·ak+1. Deﬁne b = a1a2 · · ·ak. By Euclid’s Lemma p divides b or p
divides ak+1. If p divides b, then by the induction hypothesis p divides ai
for some i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k}. Hence, p divides ai for some i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k + 1}.
Consequently, the lemma is true for k + 1.
Hence, by the generalized principle of mathematical induction, Lemma 6.1
is true for all natural numbers m ≥2.
■
In many cases, the assumption that a statement P(n) is true for a natural
number n does not easily lead to a proof that the statement P(n+1) is true. In
this instance, it is prudent to use one of the following two forms of induction.
The Second Principle of Mathematical Induction For each n ∈N let
P(n) be a statement which is either true or false but not both.
If (i) P(1) is true and
if (ii) for all n ∈N, P(1), P(2), . .., P(n) are true ⇒P(n + 1) is true,
then the statement P(n) is true for all n ∈N.
Notice in the second principle of mathematical induction the induction hy-
pothesis of the principle of mathematical induction “P(n) is true” has been
replaced by the “stronger” hypothesis “P(1), P(2), . .., P(n) are true.” For
that reason, the second principle of mathematical induction is often called

Mathematical Induction
239
The Principle of Strong Induction. We obtain the following generalized
second principle of mathematical induction from the generalized principle of
mathematical induction by making a similar change in the induction hypoth-
esis.
The Generalized Second Principle of Mathematical Induction For
each n ∈N let Q(n) be a statement which is either true or false but not both.
If (i) Q(n0) is true and
if (ii) for all n ∈N with n ≥n0,
Q(n0), Q(n0 + 1), . . ., Q(n) are true ⇒Q(n + 1) is true,
then for all natural numbers n ≥n0, the statement Q(n) is true.
Example 6.2.2
Use a, the Well-Ordering Principle, and b, the Principle
of Strong Induction, to prove that every natural number n ≥2 has a prime
factor.
a. Proof: Let n ∈N and let n ≥2. If n is a prime, then n is a prime factor of
n. If n is a composite number, then n has factors in addition to 1 and n. By
the Well-Ordering Principle, there is a smallest factor q. Either q is a prime
or q is a composite. Suppose q is a composite; then q has a divisor d and
1 < d < q. Since d divides q and q divides n, d divides n. This contradicts
the deﬁnition of q, because d < q. Hence, q is a prime.
b. Proof: Let n ∈N and let n ≥2. Let P(n) be the statement “n has a
prime factor.”
(i) P(2) is true, because 2 is a prime factor of 2.
(ii) Assume for all n ∈N with n ≥2 that the statements P(2), P(3), .. .,
P(n) are true. Remark: We must show that the statement P(n + 1) is true.
The number n + 1 is a prime or a composite number. If n + 1 is a prime,
then P(n + 1) is true, because n + 1 is a prime and a factor of n + 1. If n + 1
is a composite number, then n + 1 has a factor d in addition to 1 and n + 1
and 1 < d < n + 1 and by assumption P(d) is true. Therefore, d has a prime
factor and since d divides n + 1, n + 1 has a prime factor. That is, P(n + 1)
is true.
■
We will use the generalized second principle of mathematical induction in
proving the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which is also known as the
Unique Factorization Theorem.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every natural number greater
than one is a prime or can be written uniquely as a product of primes except
for the order in which the prime factors are written.
Proof: Let Q(n) be the statement “For n ∈N and n ≥2, n is a prime or a
product of primes.”
(i) For n = 2, the statement Q(2) is true, because 2 is a prime.
(ii) Assume that for n ∈N and n ≥2, Q(2), Q(3), . . . , Q(n) are true. If
n + 1 is a prime, then the statement Q(n + 1) is true. On the other hand,

240
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
if n + 1 is a composite, then there exist natural numbers a and b such that
n + 1 = ab where 1 < a < n + 1 and 1 < b < n + 1—that is, n + 1 = ab where
2 ≤a ≤n and 2 ≤b ≤n. By the induction hypothesis, Q(a) and Q(b) are
true. Therefore, n + 1 is a product of primes and Q(n + 1) is true.
Consequently, by the generalized second principle of mathematical induc-
tion, every natural number greater than one is a prime or can be written as a
product of primes.
Remark: We prove the uniqueness part of this theorem using the generalized
second principle of mathematical induction as well. For each n ∈N and n ≥2,
let S(n) be the statement “If n = p1p2 · · ·pr = q1q2 · · ·qs where p1, p2, . . ., pr
and q1, q2, . . ., qs are primes with p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤pr and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qs,
then r = s and pi = qi for i = 1, 2, . . ., r.”
(i) Since 2 is a prime, its only factorization is 2 = 2. Hence, S(2) is true.
(ii) For n ∈N and n ≥2 we assume the statements S(2), S(3), . . . , S(n) are
true and we assume n + 1 has two diﬀerent factorizations into a product of
primes. Thus, we assume n + 1 = p1p2 · · ·pr = q1q2 · · ·qs where p1, p2, . . ., pr
and q1, q2, . . ., qs are primes with p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤pr and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qs.
By the trichotomy law either p1 ≤q1 or p1 ≥q1. We assume p1 ≤q1. (The
proof for the case p1 ≥q1 is the same as the proof which follows if p and q are
interchanged and r and s are interchanged throughout.) By Lemma 6.1, since
p1 is a prime and n+1 = p1(p2 · · ·pr) = q1q2 · · ·qs, the prime p1 divides qj for
some j ∈{1, 2, . . ., s}. Because p1 and qj are both primes, we have p1 = qj.
Since q1 ≤qj for all j ∈{1, 2, . . ., s}, the prime q1 ≤p1. Since we assumed
that p1 ≤q1, we conclude that p1 = q1 and n + 1 = p1p2 · · ·pr = q1q2 · · ·qs =
p1q2 · · ·qs. Cancelling p1, we have m = p2 · · ·pr = q2 · · ·qs < n + 1. The
statement S(m) is assumed to be true by the induction hypothesis; therefore,
r = s and pi = qi for i ∈{2, 3, . . ., r}.
By the second general principle of mathematical induction, S(n) is true for
all n ∈N with n ≥2.
■
Next, we consider a few ﬁnite sets of prime numbers. First, we let F1 =
{2, 3} and compute N1 = 2 · 3 + 1 = 7, which is a prime.
Then, we let
F2 = {2, 3, 7} and calculate N2 = 2 · 3 · 7 + 1 = 43, which is a prime. Finally,
we let F3 = {2, 3, 7, 43} and ﬁnd that N3 = 2 · 3 · 7 · 43 + 1 = 1807 = 13 · 139.
From these calculations, we see that if F = {p1, p2, . . ., pk} is a ﬁnite set
of prime numbers, then the natural number N = p1 · p2 · · ·pk + 1 > 1 and
N may be a prime number or a composite number. Notice that the unique
factorization of N3 has prime factors 13 and 139 and that neither of these two
primes appears in the set F3. Euclid (c. 300 B.C.) may have been the ﬁrst
person to prove that there are an inﬁnite number of prime numbers. The proof
of this theorem is by contradiction and employs the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic (the Unique Factorization Theorem).

Mathematical Induction
241
Theorem There are an inﬁnite number of prime numbers.
Proof: Suppose, to the contrary, that there are a ﬁnite number of prime
numbers and let F = {p1, p2, . . ., pk} be the set of all prime numbers. Let
N = p1 · p2 · · ·pk + 1 > 1.
By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
either N is a prime number or N is a composite number. Suppose N is a
prime. From the deﬁnition of N, it follows that N > pi for all i = 1, 2, . . ., k.
Consequently, N is not in the set F, which is a contradiction. Next, suppose
that N is a composite number. Then N has a prime divisor pi ∈F, since F
contains all of the prime numbers. Because the prime pi divides N, pi divides
N −(p1 · p2 · · ·pk) = 1, which is a contradiction.
■
Now, we examine a class of problems for which the generalized second
principal of mathematical induction is an appropriate method of proof. A
sequence of real numbers is a function from N into R. For each n ∈N,
let xn = f(n). The value xn is called the nth term of the sequence f. We
will denote the sequence by < xn >∞
n=1, or simply < xn >. Often a formula
is given for the nth term—for instance,
xn = 2n + 3,
xn = (−1)n
n
,
or
xn = sin n
n
.
Sometimes a sequence is deﬁned recursively. For example, x1 = 1, x2 = 2,
and xn = 3xn−1 −2xn−2 for n ≥3. In this case, the ﬁrst two terms are given
explicitly and the remaining terms are deﬁned in terms of the two immediately
preceeding terms. The following example illustrates how to prove a result
when a sequence is deﬁned recursively.
Example 6.2.3 Let < xn > be the sequence deﬁned by x1 = 1; x2 = 2; and
for n ≥3, deﬁned recursively by xn = 3xn−1 −2xn−2. Find a formula for the
nth term, xn, and prove that the formula is correct.
Solution
The ﬁrst few terms of the sequence are x1 = 1, x2 = 2,
x3 = 3x2 −2x1 = 3(2) −2(1) = 6 −2 = 4
x4 = 3x3 −2x2 = 3(4) −2(2) = 12 −4 = 8
x5 = 3x4 −2x3 = 3(8) −2(4) = 24 −8 = 16
From the ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the sequence, it appears the formula for the nth
term may be xn = 2n−1.
(i) Using this formula, for n = 1 we ﬁnd x1 = 21−1 = 20 = 1 and for n = 2
we obtain x2 = 22−1 = 2. So the formula is correct for n = 1 and n = 2.
(ii) For k = 1, 2, . . ., n, we assume that xk = 2k−1. We must now show that
xn+1 = 2(n+1)−1 = 2n. From the recursive deﬁnition for xn and the inductive
hypothesis, we ﬁnd
xn+1 = 3xn−2xn−1 = 3·2n−1−2·2(n−1)−1 = 3·2n−1−2n−1 = 2n−1(3−1) = 2n.
Hence, by induction, xn = 2n−1 for all natural numbers.

Statement: For all n ∈N, 7 divides 9n −2n.
Proof? Let P(n) be the statement “7 divides 9n −2n.”
(i) For n = 1, the statement P(1) is “7 divides 91 −21,” which is true.
(ii) Let n ∈N and suppose that P(n) is true. Because P(n) is true, 7
divides 9n −2n. The statement P(n + 1) is “7 divides 9n+1 −2n+1.”
Calculating, we ﬁnd 9n+1 −2n+1 = (9 −2)(9n −2n) = 7(9n −2n).

for s = 1, 9s −2s = 91 −21 = 9 −2 = 7, which is divisible by 7. The
natural number s −1 < s and therefore 7 divides 9s−1 −2s−1. Since

245
9(9s−1 −2s−1) is divisible by 7 and 7(2s−1) is divisible by 7, the sum
9(9s−1−2s−1)+7(2s−1) = 9s −9·2s−1+7·2s−1 = 9s −2·2s−1 = 9s −2s
is divisible by 7. Contradiction.
25. The statement “All cats are the same color” is false. What is the easiest
way to prove that the statement is false? Below is an invalid proof of the
statement “All cats are the same color.” Where is the error in the proof?
Invalid Proof: Obviously, in every set which contains exactly one cat, all
cats are the same color. Suppose in every set of n cats that all cats are
the same color. Consider any set of n + 1 cats. If we remove one cat,
we have a set with n cats and all the cats are the same color. Now,
consider a set of n cats obtained by removing a diﬀerent cat from the
set of n + 1 cats.
In this set of n cats, all cats are the same color.
Consequently, in the set of n + 1 cats, all cats are the same color. So, by
the Principle of Mathematical Induction all cats are the same color.

Cardinalities of Sets
Study of the concept of inﬁnity dates back to the Greek philosopher Zeno
of Elea (c. 450 B.C.). However, the modern era of the study of inﬁnity was
begun by the Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).
In 1638, Galileo published a Dialog Concerning Two New Sciences. His pri-
mary goal in Dialog was to establish the Copernican heliocentric theory of the
solar system over the accepted and church supported Ptolemaic geocentric
theory. For this, Galileo was charged with heresy by the Inquisition, forced
to recant, and spent the last eight years of his life under house arrest. In
Dialog, Galileo also discussed the concepts of inﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal. He
observed that the set of natural numbers, N, properly contains the set of
perfect squares, S = {1, 4, 9, 16,. ..}, and that there are an inﬁnite number of
elements in both N and S. He concluded that there were as many elements
in S as in N. However, Galileo believed this conclusion was absurd, since this
would mean it was possible to apply the terms “equal to,” “greater than,”
and “less than” to inﬁnite quantities. In 1691, the English mathematician
Edmond Halley (1656–1742) published an article in the Philosophical Trans-
actions of the Royal Society titled “On the Several Species of Inﬁnite Quantity
and the Proportions They Bear to One Another” in which he suggested that
the phrases “twice as inﬁnite” and “one-fourth as inﬁnite” might be meaning-
ful. In other words, Halley was suggesting that inﬁnite quantities might have
diﬀerent “sizes” and be “comparable.”
In 1873, Cantor wrote a letter to Dedekind in which he stated he had proved
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers and
the set of rational numbers and in which he speculated on whether there
was a one-to-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers and the
set of real numbers.
A few days later, Cantor wrote to Dedekind stating
there was no one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and
the real numbers. In 1874, Cantor published these results in Crelle’s Journal
in the article “On a Property of the Real Algebraic Numbers.” Prior to this
publication, all inﬁnite collections were thought to be “the same size.” That
is, prior to Cantor’s work, orders of inﬁnity did not exist. Crelle’s Journal is
the common name for the Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics. It is
one of the most famous mathematics journals in the world and was founded
by August Crelle in 1826.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
7.1
Finite Sets
What property do the sets A = {e, π, i,
√
2} and B = {#, ∗, $, @} have in
common? Clearly, they are not equal, and neither is a subset of the other.
However, they do have the same number of elements. To verify this fact, you
would probably count the number of elements in A by associating e with the
number “1,” associating π with the number “2,” i with “3,” and
√
2 with “4,”
and conclude “A has four elements.” In the same manner, you would count
the elements in B and conclude “B has four elements.” Then since A and
B both have four elements, you conclude A and B have the same number of
elements. When two sets are ﬁnite and the number of elements in both sets is
“small,” counting the number of elements in each set and deciding if the two
numbers are the same or not is an appropriate technique for determining if the
two sets have the same number of elements or not. However, when the number
of elements is “large” (and you are apt to lose count) or the sets are inﬁnite,
a diﬀerent technique is needed to decide if the two sets have the same number
of elements or not. Let f be the one-to-one correspondence from the set A
onto the set B deﬁned by f = {(e, #), (π, ∗), (i, $), (
√
2, @)}. This one-to-one
correspondence pairs each element of the set A with exactly one element of the
set B. Thus, to determine if sets A and B have the same number of elements
or not, we do not need to know the number of elements in the sets. All we
need do is determine if there is or is not a one-to-correspondence from A onto
B. (Observe that there are 24 distinct one-to-one correspondences from A
onto B, so a one-to-one correspondence which shows two sets have the same
number of elements is not unique.) The formal deﬁnition of set equivalence
follows.
Two sets A and B are equivalent, denoted by A ∼B if and only if there
is a one-to-one correspondence from A onto B. When set A is not equivalent
to set B, we write A ̸∼B.
Instead of saying A is equivalent to B, we may say (i) A and B have the
same cardinality, (ii) A and B are numerically equivalent, (iii) A and B
are equinumerous, or (iv) A and B are equipotent.
Theorems 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 are general theorems about set equivalence and
apply to both ﬁnite and inﬁnite sets. As you might easily anticipate, the next
theorem states that set equivalence is an equivalence relation.
Theorem 7.1 Set equivalence is an equivalence relation.
Proof: Reﬂexive: For any set A, the identity function IA is a one-to-one
correspondence from A onto A, so A ∼A.
Symmetry: Suppose A ∼B. By deﬁnition, there exists a one-to-one corre-
spondence from A onto B; call it f. By Theorem 5.10, the function f−1 is a
one-to-one correspondence from B onto A, so B ∼A.

Cardinalities of Sets
249
Transitivity: Let A, B, and C be sets such that A ∼B and B ∼C. By
the deﬁnition of set equivalence, there exists a function f : A 1-1
−→
onto B and there
exists a function g : B 1-1
−→
onto C. By Theorem 5.7, the function g ◦f : A 1-1
−→
onto C, so
A ∼C.
Since ∼is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, ∼is an equivalence relation.
■
The next theorem states if sets A and C are equivalent and sets B and D
are equivalent, then the Cartesian products A × B and C × D are equivalent.
Theorem 7.2
Let A, B, C, and D be sets such that A ∼C and B ∼D,
then A × B ∼C × D.
Proof: Since A ∼C, there exists a function f : A 1-1
−→
onto C, and since B ∼D
there exists a function g : B 1-1
−→
onto D. Deﬁne (f × g) : A × B →C × D by
(f×g)(a, b) = (f(a), g(b)). We claim f×g is a one-to-one correspondence from
A×B onto C×D. To prove the function f×g is one-to-one, we assume (a1, b1),
(a2, b2) ∈A × B, and (f × g)(a1, b1) = (f × g)(a2, b2). Thus, by deﬁnition
of f × g, we have (f(a1), g(b1)) = (f(a2), g(b2)). Hence, f(a1) = f(a2) and
g(b1) = g(b2). Since f and g are both one-to-one functions, a1 = a2 and
b1 = b2. Consequently, (a1, b1) = (a2, b2) and the function f × g is one-to-
one. To prove the function f × g is onto, suppose (c, d) ∈C × D. Since the
functions f and g are both onto, there exists an a ∈A such that f(a) = c and
there exists a b ∈B such that g(b) = d. The ordered pair (a, b) is an element
of A × B and by deﬁnition, (f × g)(a, b) = (f(a), g(b)) = (c, d). Thus, the
function f × g is onto and f × g is a one-to-one correspondence from A × B
onto C × D.
■
The following theorem states “If A and B are equivalent sets, if C and D
are equivalent sets, if A and C are disjoint sets, and if B and D are disjoint
sets, then the sets A ∪C and B ∪D are equivalent sets.”
Theorem 7.3 If A, B, C, and D are sets with A ∼B, C ∼D, A ∩C = ∅,
and B ∩D = ∅, then A ∪C ∼B ∪D.
Proof: Since A ∼B there exists a one-to-one correspondence f from A onto
B. And since C ∼D there exists a one-to-one correspondence g from C onto
D. Deﬁne f ∪g : A ∪C →B ∪D by
(f ∪g)(x) =
f(x), if x ∈A
g(x), if x ∈C
Remark: To prove f ∪g is a one-to-one correspondence from A ∪C onto
B ∪D, we must prove f ∪g is a function with domain A∪C and range B ∪D.
Then we must prove f ∪g is one-to-one.
Since f and g are functions, f, g, and f ∪g are relations. To prove f ∪g is
a function, suppose (x, y) ∈f ∪g and (x, z) ∈f ∪g. Since A ∩C = ∅, either
(i) x ∈A and x /∈C or (ii) x /∈A and x ∈C. If x ∈A and x /∈C, then
y = (f ∪g)(x) = f(x) = z, because f is a function. If x /∈A and x ∈C, then

250
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
y = (f ∪g)(x) = g(x) = z, because g is a function. In both cases, y = z and
therefore f ∪g is a function.
Suppose x ∈A ∪C. Since A ∩C = ∅, either (i) x ∈A and x /∈C, and
consequently (f ∪g)(x) = f(x) or (ii) x /∈A and x ∈C, and consequently
(f ∪g)(x) = g(x). In both cases, x ∈A ∪C implies x ∈Dom(f ∪g)—that is,
(1) A∪C ⊆Dom(f ∪g). Now suppose x ∈Dom(f ∪g). By deﬁnition of f ∪g,
we have x ∈Dom(f) = A or x ∈Dom(g) = C. Hence, x ∈A ∪C. Therefore,
(2) Dom(f ∪g) ⊆A∪C. It follows from (1) and (2) that Dom(f ∪g) = A∪C.
Next suppose y ∈B ∪D. Since B ∩D = ∅, either (i) y ∈B and y /∈D or
(ii) y /∈B and y ∈D. In case (i), since y ∈B and since f is a function from
A onto B, there exists an x ∈A such that y = f(x) = (f ∪g)(x). In case (ii),
since y ∈D and since g is a function from C onto D, there exists an x ∈C
such that y = g(x) = (f ∪g)(x). Hence, for every y ∈B ∪D there exists an
x ∈A ∪C such that (f ∪g)(x) = y. Therefore, the function f ∪g is onto.
To prove the function f ∪g is one-to-one, we assume x, y ∈A ∪C and
(f ∪g)(x) = (f ∪g)(y). There are four cases to consider. (1) If x, y ∈A,
then (f ∪g)(x) = f(x) = (f ∪g)(y) = f(y), and because f is a one-to-one
function, x = y. (2) If x, y ∈C, then (f ∪g)(x) = g(x) = (f ∪g)(y) = g(y),
and because g is a one-to-one function, x = y. (3) If x ∈A and y ∈C, then
(f ∪g)(x) = f(x) = (f ∪g)(y) = g(y). But f(x) ∈B and g(y) ∈D, which
contradicts the hypothesis B ∩D = ∅. (4) As in case (3), the case y ∈A and
x ∈C contradicts the hypothesis B∩D = ∅. It follows from cases (1)–(4) that
x, y ∈A ∪C and (f ∪g)(x) = (f ∪g)(y) implies x = y. Hence, the function
f ∪g is one-to-one, and therefore f ∪g is a one-to-one correspondence from
A ∪C onto B ∪D.
■
For each k ∈N, we deﬁne Nk = {1, 2, 3, . .., k}. The elements of the set
Nk are the numbers we would normally use to count the elements of any set
with exactly k elements. Consequently, the collection of sets {Nk | k ∈N}
serves as our standard of measure for ﬁnite sets, as indicated by the following
deﬁnitions.
A set A is ﬁnite if and only if A = ∅or A ∼Nk for some k ∈N.
A set is inﬁnite if it is not ﬁnite.
The cardinality of a ﬁnite set A is denoted by |A|. By deﬁnition, the
empty set is ﬁnite, and the cardinality of the empty set is |∅| = 0. If A ∼Nk
for some k ∈N, then the cardinality of A is |A| = k. Since the identity
function INk is a one-to-one function from Nk onto Nk, the cardinality of the
set Nk is k—that is, |Nk| = k.
Theorems 7.4 through 7.11, which concern ﬁnite sets, may appear to be
obvious; however, we want to state and prove these theorems from the deﬁni-
tions given above to convince ourselves that the concept of cardinality for a
ﬁnite set coincides with our idea of the number of elements in the set. Also,
this will allow us to compare and contrast the results we obtain for ﬁnite sets
with the results we obtain for inﬁnite sets in the next two sections. Usually,

Cardinalities of Sets
251
those results are very diﬀerent.
Theorem 7.4 Any set B which is equivalent to a ﬁnite set A is a ﬁnite set
and |B| = |A|.
Proof: Let A be a ﬁnite set and let B ∼A.
Case 1. If A = ∅, then |A| = 0 and there exists a one-to-one correspondence
f : B →∅. Since the codomain of f is the empty set, Dom(f) = ∅= B.
Hence, B is ﬁnite and |B| = 0 = |A|.
Case 2.
If A ̸= ∅, then A ∼Nk for some k ∈N and |A| = k.
Since
B ∼A, A ∼Nk, and ∼is transitive, B ∼Nk. Therefore, B is ﬁnite and
|B| = k = |A|.
■
Theorem 7.5 The cardinality of a ﬁnite set A is unique.
Proof: If A = ∅, then by deﬁnition |∅| = 0. By way of contradiction, suppose
there exists a nonempty, ﬁnite set A such that |A| = m, |A| = n, and m ̸= n.
Since |A| = m, we have A ∼Nm and since |A| = n, we have A ∼Nn. Since
∼is an equivalence relation, Nm ∼Nn, which implies by Theorem 7.4 that
|Nm| = |Nn|. Hence, m = n, which is a contradiction.
■
Theorem 7.6 If A is a ﬁnite set and x /∈A, then A ∪{x} is a ﬁnite set and
|A ∪{x}| = |A| + 1.
Proof: Case 1. If A = ∅, then |A| = 0 and A ∪{x} = {x}. Since {x} ∼N1,
|{x}| = 1 and |A ∪{x}| = |{x}| = 1 = 0 + 1 = |A| + 1.
Case 2. If A ̸= ∅, then A ∼Nk for some k ∈N and therefore |A| = k. Since
A ∼Nk there exists a one-to-one correspondence f : A →Nk. Let g be the
function from A ∪{x} to Nk+1 deﬁned by
g(t) =
 f(t),
if t ∈A
k + 1, if t = x
Remark: We now prove g is a one-to-one correspondence. First, we prove
g is a one-to-one function. Let t1, t2 ∈A ∪{x} and assume t1 ̸= t2. There are
two cases to consider.
Case (i) If t1 and t2 are both elements of A, then since f is a one-to-one
function f(t1) ̸= f(t2), which implies g(t1) ̸= g(t2).
Case (ii) If t2 = x, then g(t2) = k + 1. Since t1 ̸= t2 = x, we conclude
t1 ∈A. Hence, g(t1) = f(t1) ∈Nk. Since g(t1) ∈Nk and g(t2) = k + 1,
g(t1) ̸= g(t2).
In cases (i) and (ii), t1 ̸= t2 implies g(t1) ̸= g(t2). Consequently, g is a
one-to-one function.
Remark: Next, we prove g is onto. Suppose m ∈Nk+1. Either m ∈Nk or
m = k + 1. If m ∈Nk, then since f : A →Nk is onto, there exists a t ∈A
such that f(t) = m = g(t). If m = k + 1, then t = x and g(x) = k + 1 = m.
Thus, g is onto.
Consequently, g is a one-to-one correspondence from A ∪{x} onto Nk+1,
A ∪{x} ∼Nk+1, and |A ∪{x}| = |Nk+1| = k + 1 = |A| + 1.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Theorem 7.6 says adjoining one “new” element to a ﬁnite set increases the
cardinality by one. The following theorem says any subset of Nn is a ﬁnite
set and has cardinality less than or equal to n.
Theorem 7.7 If A ⊆Nn, then A is a ﬁnite set and |A| ≤n.
Proof: Remark: We prove this theorem by induction.
Let P(n) be the
statement “If A ⊆Nn, then A is a ﬁnite set and |A| ≤n.”
(1) If A ⊆N1, then either A = ∅or A = N1. If A = ∅, then A is ﬁnite and
|A| = 0 < 1. If A = N1, then A is ﬁnite and |A| = 1. Consequently, P(1) is
true.
(2) Let k ∈N and assume P(k) is true. Suppose A ⊆Nk+1. Then A −
{k + 1} ⊆Nk and by the induction hypothesis, (*) A −{k + 1} is ﬁnite
and |A −{k + 1}| ≤k. There are two cases to consider: (i) k + 1 /∈A and
(ii) k + 1 ∈A. (i) If k + 1 /∈A, then A −{k + 1} = A and from (*) A is ﬁnite
and |A| ≤k < k + 1. (ii) If k + 1 ∈A, then A = (A −{k + 1}) ∪{k + 1}. By
Theorem 7.6, since A−{k+1} is a ﬁnite set and since {k+1} /∈(A−{k+1}),
(A −{k + 1}) ∪{k+ 1} = A is a ﬁnite set and |A| = |A −{k+ 1}| + 1 ≤k + 1.
In both cases, P(n + 1) is true. Hence, by mathematical induction, for all
n ∈N, if A ⊆Nn, then A is a ﬁnite set and |A| ≤n.
■
Theorem 7.8
If A ⊆B where B is a ﬁnite set, then A is a ﬁnite set and
|A| ≤|B|.
Proof: Let B be a ﬁnite set and let A ⊆B.
Case 1. If A = ∅, then A is a ﬁnite set and |A| = 0 ≤|B|.
Case 2. Suppose A ̸= ∅. Since A ⊆B, the set B ̸= ∅and there exists a k ∈N
such that B ∼Nk. That is, there exists a k ∈N and there exists a one-to-one
correspondence f : B →Nk. The restriction of f to the set A, f|A, is a one-to-
one function from A onto f(A). Therefore, A ∼f(A). By Theorem 7.7, since
f(A) is a subset of Nk, f(A) is a ﬁnite set and |f(A)| ≤k. By Theorem 7.4,
because A ∼f(A), which is ﬁnite, A is ﬁnite and |A| = |f(A)| ≤k.
■
Theorem 7.8 says if A is a subset of a ﬁnite set B, then A is ﬁnite and the
cardinality of A is less than or equal to the cardinality of B. The following
theorem says if A and B are ﬁnite sets which are disjoint, then A ∪B is a
ﬁnite set whose cardinality is equal to the sum of the cardinality of A and the
cardinality of B.
Theorem 7.9 If A and B are ﬁnite sets and if A ∩B = ∅, then A ∪B is a
ﬁnite set and |A ∪B| = |A| + |B|.
Proof: Suppose A and B are ﬁnite sets and A ∩B = ∅. If A = ∅, then
A ∪B = B is ﬁnite and |A ∪B| = |B| = 0 + |B| = |A| + |B|. If B = ∅, then
A ∪B = A is ﬁnite and |A ∪B| = |A| = |A| + 0 = |A| + |B|. So if A or B
is the empty set, A ∪B is a ﬁnite set and |A ∪B| = |A| + |B|. Now suppose
A ̸= ∅and B ̸= ∅. Since A and B are ﬁnite sets, there exist m, n ∈N such
that A ∼Nm and B ∼Nn. Let M = {m + 1, m + 2, . . ., m + n}. Deﬁne
h : Nn →M by h(x) = m+x. The function h is a one-to-one correspondence.

Cardinalities of Sets
253
(Verify this.) Hence, Nn ∼M and by transitivity of set equivalence B ∼M.
By Theorem 7.3, since A ∼Nm, B ∼M, A ∩B = ∅, and Nm ∩M = ∅,
the set A ∪B ∼Nm ∪M = Nm+n.
Furthermore, since A ∼Nm, since
B ∼Nn, since A ∪B ∼Nm+n, since |A| = m, and since |B| = n, it follows
that |A ∪B| = m + n = |A| + |B|.
■
Theorem 7.6 says adjoining one “new” element to a ﬁnite set increases the
cardinality by one. The following theorem says removing one element from a
nonempty, ﬁnite set decreases the cardinality by one.
Theorem 7.10 If B is a ﬁnite set and if x ∈B, then B −{x} is a ﬁnite set
and |B −{x}| = |B| −1.
Proof: Because x ∈B, the set B −{x} is a proper subset of B. By The-
orem 7.8, since B is ﬁnite, the set B −{x} is ﬁnite. Let A = B −{x}. By
Theorem 7.6, since x /∈(B −{x}), the set A ∪{x} = (B −{x}) ∪{x} = B
has cardinality |A ∪{x}| = |A| + 1—that is, |B| = |B −{x}| + 1. Hence,
|B −{x}| = |B| −1.
■
The following theorem characterizes ﬁnite sets.
Theorem 7.11 A ﬁnite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
Proof: Let B be a ﬁnite set and assume A is a proper subset of B. Since
A ⊂B, there exists an element x ∈B−A. Hence, x ∈B and by Theorem 7.10,
the set B −{x} is ﬁnite and |B −{x}| = |B| −1. Since x ∈B −A, the set
A ⊆B −{x} and by Theorem 7.8, A is ﬁnite and |A| ≤|B −{x}| = |B| −1.
Consequently, |A| < |B|. By the contrapositive of Theorem 7.4, we see that
A ̸∼B.
■
The contrapositive of Theorem 7.11 is “If a set is equivalent to one of its
proper subsets, then it is an inﬁnite set.” This statement is a characterization
of inﬁnite sets.
EXERCISES 7.1
1. Which of the following sets are ﬁnite?

7.2
Denumerable and Countable Sets
Theorem 7.11 states “A ﬁnite set is not equivalent to any of its proper
subsets.” The contrapositive of this statement is a theorem as well and pro-
vides us with a method for proving a set is inﬁnite. Theorem 7.12 is the
contrapositive of Theorem 7.11.
Theorem 7.12 If a set is equivalent to one of its proper subsets, then it is
an inﬁnite set.
The ﬁrst inﬁnite set we will discuss is the set of natural numbers. Let E
denote the set of even natural numbers. That is, let E = {2, 4, 6, . ..}. Clearly,
E is a proper subset of the natural numbers and the function f : N →E
deﬁned by f(n) = 2n is a one-to-one correspondence from N onto E. (Verify

Cardinalities of Sets
255
this fact.) That is, N ∼E. By Theorem 7.12, since E ⊂N and since N ∼E,
the set N is an inﬁnite set.
To “count” the number of elements in a nonempty, ﬁnite set, we ﬁnd an
equivalence with Nk for some k ∈N. We call the cardinality of a ﬁnite set a
ﬁnite cardinal number. Because ∅⊂N1 ⊂N2 ⊂· · · ⊂Nn ⊂Nn+1 ⊂· · ·.
The ﬁnite cardinal numbers have the same order relation as the natural
numbers—namely, |∅| < |N1| < |N2| < · · · < |Nn| < |Nn+1| < · · · or
0 < 1 < 2 < · · · < n < n + 1 < · · ·. Inﬁnite sets which are equivalent to the
set of natural numbers, and thereby “counted” by the natural numbers, Can-
tor called countable or denumerably inﬁnite. Because ﬁnite sets are countable
and can be assigned a number, it is appropriate to assign a number to the set
of natural numbers (and to all sets equivalent to the set of natural numbers).
No natural number can be used for the this purpose, because each natural
number is a ﬁnite cardinal and is assigned to ﬁnite sets. To represent the car-
dinality of inﬁnite sets it was necessary to create a new collection of cardinal
numbers called transﬁnite cardinal numbers. Because Cantor realized ad-
ditional transﬁnite numbers other than the one for the set of natural numbers
would be required and because he suspected an inﬁnite number of transﬁnite
cardinal numbers would be required, Cantor designated the number ℵ0 (read
“aleph-null,” “aleph-naught,” or “aleph-zero”) to be the cardinality of the
natural numbers. That is, by deﬁnition |N| = ℵ0. Thus, the order of the
transﬁnite cardinals anticipated by Cantor was ℵ0, ℵ1, ℵ2, . . .. The letter ℵis
the ﬁrst letter of the Hebrew alphabet. We now present the following formal
deﬁnitions.
The cardinality of the set of natural numbers, N, is |N| = ℵ0.
A set A is denumerable or countably inﬁnite if and only if A ∼N.
A set is countable provided it is ﬁnite or denumerable.
A set which is not countable is uncountable.
Theorem 7.13 The set of integers, Z, is denumerable and |Z| = ℵ0.
Proof: Let f : Z →N be the function deﬁned by
f(n) =



2n,
if n > 0
1 −2n, if n ≤0
In Exercise 1, you are asked to prove f is a one-to-one correspondence from
Z onto N. Once proved, Z ∼N and |Z| = ℵ0. That is, the set of integers is
denumerable and has cardinality ℵ0.
■
Recall that Theorem 7.6 says “If A is a ﬁnite set and x /∈A, then A ∪{x}
is a ﬁnite set and |A ∪{x}| = |A| + 1.” That is, if an element which does not
belong to a ﬁnite set is adjoined to the set, then the cardinality of the new set
is equal to the cardinality of the original set plus one. Contrast Theorem 7.6
for ﬁnite sets with the following theorem for denumerable sets. This theorem
says if an element is adjoined to a denumerable set, the cardinality of the new
set is the same as the cardinality of the original set—namely, ℵ0.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Theorem 7.14
If A is a denumerable set, then A ∪{x} is a denumerable
set.
Proof: Let A be a denumerable set. Then there exists a one-to-one corre-
spondence f : N →A. There are two cases to consider. (1) If x ∈A, then
A ∪{x} = A, which is denumerable. (2) If x /∈A, deﬁne g : N →A ∪{x} by
g(n) =

x,
if n = 1
f(n −1), if n ̸= 1
The function g is a one-to-one correspondence from N onto A ∪{x}. (You
are asked to prove this in Exercise 2.) Since N ∼A ∪{x}, the set A ∪{x} is
denumerable.
■
The previous theorem shows that one property of cardinal arithmetic is
ℵ0 + 1 = ℵ0. The next theorem states that for any n ∈N, ℵ0 + n = ℵ0.
Theorem 7.15 If A is a denumerable set and B is a ﬁnite set, then A ∪B
is a denumerable set.
Proof: The proof of this theorem is by mathematical induction and you are
asked to provide the proof in Exercise 3.
■
The following theorem states that the union of two disjoint denumerable
sets is a denumerable set. The associated cardinal arithmetic is ℵ0 +ℵ0 = ℵ0.
Theorem 7.16 If A and B are denumerable sets and A∩B = ∅, then A∪B
is a denumerable set.
Proof: Let A and B be disjoint denumerable sets and let f : N →A and
g : N →B be one-to-one correspondences. Deﬁne h : N →A ∪B by
h(n) =

In Exercise 4, you are asked to prove h is a one-to-one correspondence from
N onto A ∪B, which proves that A ∪B is a denumerable set.
■
Compare Theorem 7.16 and Theorem 7.9 and observe the diﬀerence in the
result obtained for ﬁnite sets (Theorem 7.9) versus the result obtained for
denumerable sets (Theorem 7.16).
Theorems 7.14, 7.15, and 7.16 tell us how to add some cardinal numbers.
Theorem 7.14 essentially says ℵ0 + 1 = ℵ0. Theorem 7.15 says for all n ∈N
ℵ0 + n = ℵ0. And Theorem 7.16 says provided sets A and B are disjoint,
denumerable sets then ℵ0+ℵ0 = ℵ0. The well-known German mathematician
David Hilbert (1862–1943) invented “Hotel Inﬁnity” to illustrate these three
theorems.
Hotel Inﬁnity has an inﬁnite number of rooms numbered 1, 2,
3, 4, . . . , . (Theorem 7.16) One day all the rooms were occupied and one
more guest arrived. Although there was no vacancy, the manager found a
room for the new guest by moving each occupant of each room to the room
whose number was one higher than before. That left room 1 available for

Cardinalities of Sets
257
the new guest. (Theorem 7.17) The following day, a ﬁnite number, n, of new
guests arrived. In order to make room for the new occupants, the manager
moved each occupant of each room to the room whose number was n more
than before. Then the new guests moved into rooms numbered 1, 2, . . . , n.
(Theorem 7.18) On another day, all of the residents of another inﬁnite hotel
decided they wanted to move to Hilbert’s Hotel Inﬁnity. The manager made
room for the new guests by moving the current guest in room n to room 2n.
That is, the manager moved the current guests into the even numbered rooms
in Hotel Inﬁnity. Then he moved the inﬁnite number of new guests into the
odd numbered rooms of Hotel Inﬁnity.
Theorem 7.17 The Cartesian product N × N is denumerable.
Proof: Claim: The function f : N × N →N deﬁned by f((m, n)) =
2m−1(2n −1) is a one-to-one correspondence from N × N onto N. To prove
f is one-to-one, we assume f((m, n)) = f((r, s)). Hence, 2m−1(2n −1) =
2r−1(2s −1). The natural numbers 2n −1 and 2s −1 are both odd and it
follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that 2m−1 = 2r−1 and
2n −1 = 2s −1. Therefore, m = r and n = s. Consequently, (m, n) = (r, s)
and f is one-to-one. To prove f is onto, we assume x ∈N. It follows from
the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that x = 2m−1q where m ∈N and
q is an odd natural number.
Since q is odd, there exists an n ∈N such
that q = 2n −1. If x is odd, then x = 20(2n −1) = f((1, n)), whereas, if x
is even, x = 2m−1(2n −1) = f((m, n)). Hence, f is onto and a one-to-one
correspondence from N × N onto N. That is, N × N ∼N and so N × N is
denumerable.
■
The previous theorem illustrates that in cardinal arithmetic ℵ0 · ℵ0 = ℵ0.
Theorem 7.18 If A and B are denumerable sets, then A×B is a denumerable
set.
Proof: By Theorem 7.2, since A ∼N and B ∼N, the set A × B ∼N × N.
From Theorem 7.17, we have N×N ∼N, so by transitivity of set equivalence
A × B ∼N and A × B is denumerable.
■
Theorem 7.19 Every inﬁnite subset of a denumerable set is denumerable.
Proof: Let B be an inﬁnite subset of a denumerable set A. Since A ∼N,
there exists a function f : A →N which is a one-to-one correspondence
from A onto N.
The restriction of f to the set B, f|B, is a one-to-one
correspondence from B onto f(B).
Thus, B ∼f(B).
We now deﬁne a
function g : N →f(B) inductively. The set f(B) is a subset of the natural
numbers. Since B is an inﬁnite set and f(B) ∼B, the set f(B) is inﬁnite
and therefore nonempty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, f(B) has a least
element; call it g(1). For each n ∈N, the set f(B) −{g(1), g(2), . . ., g(n)} is
nonempty, because f(B) is inﬁnite. Let g(n + 1) be the least element of the
set f(B)−{g(1), g(2), . . . , g(n)}. To prove g is one-to-one, we assume p, q ∈N
and p < q. Then g(p) ∈{g(1), g(2), . . ., g(q −1)}, but g(p) is not. Hence,
g(p) ̸= g(q) and g is one-to-one. To prove g is onto, we assume r ∈f(B)

258
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
and there are m natural numbers less than r in f(B). By deﬁnition of g,
r = g(m + 1). Therefore, g is onto and a one-to-one correspondence from N
onto f(B). By transitivity, N ∼f(B) ∼B and B is denumerable.
■
Our immediate goal is to prove the set of rational numbers is denumer-
able. First, however, we prove that the set of positive rational numbers is
denumerable.
Theorem 7.20
The set of positive rational numbers, denoted by Q+, is
denumerable.
Proof: We deﬁne the set of positive rational numbers by
Q+ = {p
q | p, q ∈N and gcd(p, q) = 1}.
Consider the function f : Q+ →N×N deﬁned by f(p
q ) = (p, q). The function
f is one-to-one but not onto, since (2, 2) ∈N × N but 2
2 /∈Q+. However, the
restriction of f to Q+ is a one-to-one function from Q+ onto f(Q+). That
is, Q+ ∼f(Q+). Since N ⊂Q+, the set Q+ is an inﬁnite set and by set
equivalence so is f(Q+). By Theorem 7.19 because f(Q+) is an inﬁnite subset
of N × N, a denumerable set, f(Q+) is denumerable and by set equivalence
Q+ is denumerable also.
■
Theorem 7.21 The set of rational numbers is denumerable.
Proof: Let the negative rational numbers be deﬁned by
Q−= {−p
q | p
q ∈Q+}.
By deﬁnition, Q−∼Q+ and, therefore, Q−is denumerable.
By Theo-
rem 7.14, the set Q−∪{0} is denumerable.
By Theorem 7.16, since Q−
is denumerable and (Q−∪{0}) ∩Q+ = ∅, the set Q = Q−∪{0} ∪Q+ is
denumerable.

7.3
Uncountable Sets
Every real number can be written as a decimal expansion with an inﬁnite
number of digits to the right of the decimal point. Every irrational number
has a unique decimal expansion which is nonrepeating. Every rational number
has a repeating expansion. However, some rational numbers have two diﬀerent
decimal expansions. For example, 1/4 = 0.250000 · · · and 1/4 = 0.249999 · · ·.
If a rational number has two diﬀerent decimal expansions, one ends with an
inﬁnite string of zeros and the other ends with an inﬁnite string of nines. We
will say a real number is in normalized decimal form if it does not end

260
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
with an inﬁnite string of nines. Therefore, 1/4 = 0.250000 · ·· in normalized
decimal form. By making this choice for the decimal representation of real
numbers, we have guaranteed the following statement is true: “Every real
number can be written uniquely in normalized decimal form.” Hence, two
real numbers written in normalized decimal form are equal if and
only if in each position of their decimal expansion their digits are
identical.
Thus far, we have seen examples of ﬁnite sets, denumerable sets, countable
sets, and inﬁnite sets, but we have not exhibited an uncountable set. In the
following theorem, we prove the open unit interval (0, 1) is an uncountable
set. The method of proof employed in this theorem is due to Georg Cantor
and is called Cantor’s diagonal argument.
Theorem 7.22 The open unit interval (0, 1) is an uncountable set.
Proof: The set S = { 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, . . .} is an inﬁnite subset of (0, 1); therefore,
(0, 1) is an inﬁnite set. (See Exercise 8 of Section 7.2.) Consequently, (0, 1)
is denumerable or uncountable. We will show by contradiction that (0, 1) is
uncountable. Assume (0, 1) is denumerable. Then there exists a one-to-one
correspondence f : N →(0, 1). We list all of the real numbers in (0, 1) in
normalized decimal form as follows:
f(1) = 0.a11a12a13a14a15 · · ·
f(2) = 0.a21a22a23a24a25 · · ·
f(3) = 0.a31a32a33a34a35 · · ·
f(4) = 0.a41a42a43a44a45 · · ·
...
f(n) = 0.an1an2an3an4an5 · · ·
...
Observe that the jth decimal digit of the ith real number f(i) is aij. We will
now show how to construct a real number b = 0.b1b2b3b4b5 · · · in (0, 1) which
does not appear in the list f(1), f(2), f(3), . . .. We want to choose the digits
bk so that bk ̸= akk and bk ̸= 9. We choose bk ̸= akk to ensure b diﬀers from
f(k) in the kth decimal digit. We choose bk ̸= 9 to ensure we do not create a
decimal number which ends with an inﬁnite string of nines. For each k ∈N,
deﬁne
bk =
2, if akk ̸= 2
4, if akk = 2
By our choice of the digits bk, the number b = 0.b1b2b3b4b5 · · · is a real number
expressed in normalized decimal form which is in the interval (0, 1) but which
does not appear in the list f(1), f(2), f(3), . . .. Therefore, the function f is
not onto, which contradicts f being a one-to-one correspondence from N onto
(0, 1). Remark: The choice of the digits 2 and 4 in the deﬁnition of bk is

261
arbitrary. Any other two distinct digits neither of which is 9 would suﬃce.
■
The open unit interval (0, 1) is our ﬁrst example of an uncountable set. We
will deﬁne the cardinality of (0, 1) to be c. Just as the sets Nk for k ∈N are
our standards for measuring ﬁnite sets and N is our standard for measuring
denumerable sets, the interval (0, 1) is our standard for measuring uncountable
sets.
The cardinality of the set (0, 1) is |(0, 1)| = c.
A set A is uncountable and has cardinality c if and only if A ∼(0, 1).
The next theorem states that every ﬁnite interval is uncountable and has
cardinality c.
Theorem 7.23 For a, b ∈R with a < b, the open interval (a, b) ∼(0, 1) and
|(a, b)| = c.
Proof: The function f : (a, b) →(0, 1) deﬁned by f(x) = x −a
b −a is a linear
function from R onto R restricted to the domain (a, b); therefore, f is a
one-to-one correspondence from (a, b) onto (0, 1).
■
Since ∼is an equivalence relation, it follows that for a, b, c, d ∈R with
a < b and c < d the open intervals (a, b) and (c, d) are equivalent and have
cardinality c. The following theorem states that the set of real numbers is an
uncountable set and has cardinality c.
Theorem 7.24 The set of real numbers R is uncountable and |R| = c.
Proof: The function g : (−π
2, π
2) →R deﬁned by g(x) = tan x is a one-to-one
correspondence from the interval (−π
2 , π
2) onto R. Since (0, 1) ∼(−π
2, π
2) by
the transitivity of ∼, we have (0, 1) ∼R. Consequently, R is countable and
by deﬁnition |R| = c.
■
The set of real numbers is referred to as the continuum. For this reason,
the cardinal number c is called the cardinality of the continuum.
By Theorem 7.21 the set of rational numbers is denumerable and by Theo-
rem 7.24 the set of real numbers is uncountable. The following theorem proves
that the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
Theorem 7.25 The set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
Proof: By deﬁnition, the set of irrational numbers is the set H = R −Q.
The set {n +
√
2 | n ∈N} is an inﬁnite subset of H. Hence, H is an inﬁnite
set, and consequently H is either denumerable or uncountable. Suppose H is
denumerable. By Theorem 7.21, Q is denumerable. Since Q is denumerable,
since H = R −Q is assumed to be denumerable, and since Q ∩(R −Q) = ∅,
Q ∪(R −Q) = R is denumerable by Theorem 7.16. But this contradicts
Theorem 7.24. Hence, the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
■
The relationships between countable sets, ﬁnite sets, denumerable sets, inﬁ-
nite sets, and uncountable sets and several speciﬁc sets are shown in the Venn
diagram of Figure 7.2.

262
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
FIGURE 7.2: Finite, denumerable, countable, inﬁnite, and uncountable
sets.
We may compare cardinal numbers using the following deﬁnitions. Let A
and B be sets.
|A| = |B| if and only if A ∼B.
|A| ̸= |B| if and only if A ̸∼B.
|A| ≤|B| if and only if there exists a one-to-one function f from A to B.
|A| < |B| if and only if |A| ≤|B| and |A| ̸= |B|.
By deﬁnition, |A| < |B| if there exists a one-to-one function from A to B
but no one-to-one function which is onto B.
For example, for all k ∈N,
|Nk| < |N|, since the function f : Nk →N deﬁned by f(x) = x is one-
to-one from Nk to N but there is no one-to-one function from Nk onto N.
Furthermore, |N| < |R| or ℵ0 < c, because the function g : N →R deﬁned
by g(x) = x is one-to-one from N to R but there is no one-to-one function
from N onto R.
So far, we have seen only two diﬀerent transﬁnite cardinal numbers, ℵ0 and
c. Some questions which arise quite naturally are “Are there more transﬁnite
cardinal numbers?”, “If so, what are they?”, and “How many are there?” The
next theorem, which Georg Cantor proved, is known as Cantor’s Theorem and
answers all of these questions. Recall that the power set P(A) of a set A is
the set of all subsets of A.
Cantor’s Theorem If A is a set, then |A| < |P(A)|.
Proof: Let A be a set. If A = ∅, then P(A) = {∅}, and |A| = 0 < 1 = |P(A)|.
For A ̸= ∅, we must show (i) |A| ≤|P(A)| and (ii) |A| ̸= |P(A)|. To prove
(i) we must show there exists a function f : A →P(A) which is one-to-one.
We deﬁne f : A →P(A) by f(x) = {x}. Suppose f(x1) = f(x2). Then
{x1} = {x2}, which implies x1 = x2. Consequently f is one-to-one. We prove

Cardinalities of Sets
263
(ii) by contradiction. Suppose there exists a function g from A onto P(A).
Let S = {x ∈A | x /∈g(x)}. Since S ⊆A, we have S ∈P(A) and since g is
onto P(A) there exists some y ∈A such that S = g(y). Either (1) y ∈S or
(2) y /∈S.
(1) If y ∈S = {x ∈A | x /∈g(x)}, then y /∈g(y) = S. Contradiction.
(2) If y /∈S = {x ∈A | x /∈g(x)}, then y ∈g(y) = S. Contradiction.
In either case, there does not exist a y ∈A such that g(y) = S. Therefore,
there is no function g from A to P(A) which is onto. Consequently, there
is no one-to-one correspondence from A onto P(A) and A ̸∼P(A). Hence,
|A| ̸= |P(A)| and |A| < |P(A)|.
One consequence of Cantor’s Theorem is |N| < |P(N)|. Since P(N) con-
tains the inﬁnite subset {{1}, {2}, {3},.. .}, the set P(N) is an inﬁnite set.
And since |N| < |P(N)|, the set P(N) is uncountable. Because P(N) is a set,
P(P(N)) is a set. A second consequence of Cantor’s Theorem is |P(N)| <
|P(P(N))|.
In this manner, we can generate a denumerable collection of
cardinal numbers with the properties ℵ0 = |N| < |P(N)| < |P(P(N))| <
|P(P(P(N)))| < · · ·.
Thus, there are inﬁnitely many transﬁnite cardinal
numbers and their is no largest cardinal number.
About 1880, Georg Cantor asked the question “Is there a cardinal number
which lies strictly between ℵ0 and c?” Stated in terms of the set of real num-
bers, this question is “Does there exist an inﬁnite set of real numbers which is
not equivalent to the set of natural numbers and which is not equivalent to the
set of real numbers?” Cantor conjectured the answer to both of these ques-
tions is no. This conjecture became known as the continuum hypothesis,
which can be stated as follows.
Continuum Hypothesis There is no set X such that ℵ0 < |X| < c.
Cantor and other leading mathematicians tried to prove or disprove this con-
jecture with no success. A generalization of this conjecture is called the gen-
eralized continuum hypothesis. This conjecture states that there is no
cardinal number which lies strictly between a transﬁnite cardinal number a
and 2a. Stated more formally, the conjecture is
Generalized Continuum Hypothesis For any transﬁnite cardinal num-
ber a there is no cardinal number x such that a < x < 2a.
At the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris in 1900,
the famous German mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943) presented a
list of twenty-three important unsolved problems. At the top of the list was
the continuum hypothesis. In 1931, the Austrian mathematician Kurt G¨odel
(1906–1978) proved that any consistent axiom system includes true, unprov-
able statements. In 1940, G¨odel proved if a contradiction were to arise by
assuming the axioms of set theory and the continuum hypothesis, then the
contradiction could be deduced from the axioms of set theory alone. Thus,
G¨odel showed the continuum hypothesis was independent from the axioms
of set theory and assuming either the continuum hypothesis or its negation

264
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
would result in a consistent axiom system provided the axioms of set theory
themselves are consistent. In this sense, the continuum hypothesis is an un-
decidable statement. In 1963, the American mathematician Paul J. Cohen
(1934-
) proved that neither the continuum hypothesis nor the axiom of
choice can be proved from the axioms of set theory.
In 1895 and 1897, Cantor published his last two works on set theory. In
1895, he used the axiom of choice to prove if A and B are sets such that
|A| ≤|B| and |B| ≤|A|, then |A| = |B|. At that time, the axiom of choice was
somewhat controversial. So in 1896, Ernst Schr¨oder (1841–1902) proved the
same result without using the axiom of choice. Independently, while attending
Cantor’s seminar at Halle in 1897, Felix Bernstein (1878–1956) also proved
this result without employing the axiom of choice. The following theorem,
which we ask you to prove in Exercise 13, is called the Schr¨oder–Bernstein
Theorem or the Cantor–Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem.
Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem Let A and B be sets. If |A| ≤|B| and
|B| ≤|A|, then |A| = |B|.
The Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem can be used to prove two sets are equiv-
alent when it is diﬃcult to produce a one-to-one correspondence between the
two sets, for example, to prove |(0, 1)| = |[0, 1)| and, therefore, (0, 1) ∼[0, 1).
We ﬁrst note that the function f : (0, 1) →[0, 1) deﬁned by f(x) = x is
a one-to-one function, so (1) |(0, 1)| ≤|[0, 1)|. Then, we observe that the
function g : [0, 1) →(−1, 2) deﬁned by g(x) = x is one-to-one.
Hence,
|[0, 1)| ≤|(−1, 2)|. But since (−1, 2) ∼(0, 1), we have |(−1, 2)| = |(0, 1)|.
Thus, (2) |[0, 1)| ≤|(−1, 2)| = |(0, 1)|. Consequently, from (1) and (2) by the
Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem |(0, 1)| = |[0, 1)| and therefore (0, 1) ∼[0, 1).
Recall for a ﬁnite set A with |A| = n elements, the number of elements
in the power set of A is |P(A)| = 2n. For any inﬁnite set A with cardinal
number |A|, we deﬁne the number of elements in the power set of A to be
|P(A)| = 2|A|. Since |N| = ℵ0, by deﬁnition the cardinality of the power set
of N is |P(N)| = 2ℵ0. We now use the Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem to prove
|P(N)| = 2ℵ0 = c = |R|.
Theorem 7.26 c = 2ℵ0.
Proof: Let I = [0, 1). We have just shown that |I| = c. First, we deﬁne a one-
to-one function f from P(N) to I. For each set A ∈P(N), let x = f(A) ∈I
be the real number whose decimal expansion x = 0.d1d2d3 . . . is deﬁned by
dk =
0, if n /∈A
1, if n ∈A
(You should verify f is one-to-one.)
Since f : P(N) →I is one-to-one,
(1) |P(N)| ≤|I|. Next, we deﬁne a one-to-one function g from I to P(N).
If x ∈I and x has binary expansion x = 0.b1b2b3 . . ., then g(x) ∈P(N) is
deﬁned to be the set g(x) = {n ∈N | bn = 1}. (You should verify g is one-to-
one.) Since g : I →P(N) is one-to-one, (2) |I| ≤|P(N)|. It follows from (1)
and (2) by the Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem that |I| = |P(N)| or c = 2ℵ0.

13. Complete the following proof of the Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem:
Let A and B be sets. If |A| ≤|B| and |B| ≤|A|, then |A| = |B|.
Proof: We assume that A and B are disjoint sets. If they are not disjoint,
then the sets A∗= A × {0} and B∗= B × {1} are equivalent sets that
are disjoint. Since |A| ≤|B| there is a function f : A 1-1
−→B and since
|B| ≤|A| there is a function g : B 1-1
−→A. To prove that |A| = |B|, we
need to ﬁnd a function h : A 1-1
−→
onto B. Notice, if f is onto, then we can let
h = f, whereas, if g is onto, then we can let h = g−1. So, assume that
neither f nor g is onto. Let S = Rng(g) ⊂A. The function g : B →S
is a one-to-one correspondence as is the function g−1 : S →B.
We recursively deﬁne a sequence of sets A1, A2, A3, . . . which are all
subsets of A as follows:
A1 = A −S.
For all n ∈N, An+1 = g(f(An)) = {g(f(a)) | a ∈An}.
Then we let X = ∪n∈NAn and W = A −X. By deﬁnition A = X ∪W
and X ∩W = ∅. Next, we deﬁne the function h : A →B as follows.
h(a) =

f(a), if a ∈X
g−1(a), if a ∈W
Observe that the function h is well-deﬁned. For every a ∈A, if a ̸∈S,
then a ∈A1 ⊆X, whereas, if a ∈W, then a ∈S and g−1(a) is deﬁned.

Chapter 8
Proofs from Real Analysis
Real analysis is the study of real numbers, sets of real numbers, and func-
tions on sets of real numbers. In this chapter, we study sequences of real
numbers and their properties.
8.1
Sequences
Sequences play an important role in mathematics.
In calculus, you un-
doubtedly discussed sequences of real numbers prior to studying series. In the
broadest sense, a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural
numbers. For example, a sequence can be a sequence of sets, a sequence of
intervals, a sequence of functions, and so forth. In this chapter, we devote our
attention to sequences of real numbers.
A sequence of real numbers is a function from the set of natural numbers
to the set of real numbers.
Thus, a sequence of real numbers a : N →R is a function which assigns to
each natural number, n, a unique real number a(n). It is customary to denote
the general term or nth term of the sequence by an instead of a(n).
We will represent a sequence by a1, a2, · · · , an, · · · or < an >∞
n=1 or simply
< an > . Sequences are usually deﬁned (i) by listing the ﬁrst few terms and
assuming the pattern continues indeﬁnitely, (ii) by giving an explicit formula
for the general term, or (iii) by recursion. The following is an example of
deﬁning the same sequence by these three diﬀerent methods.
(i) 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,1, ···
(ii) an = 1 + (−1)n
2
(iii) a1 = 0 and an = an−1 + (−1)n for n ≥2
It is important to understand the notational diﬀerence between the sequence
< an >∞
n=1 and the range of the sequence {an}∞
n=1.
For example, if
an = cos(nπ/2), then < an >∞
n=1= 0, −1, 0, 1, 0, −1,0,1, ·· · while {an}∞
n=1 =
{0, −1, 1}.
In this instance, the sequence < an > is a countably inﬁnite
ordered set, while the range {an} is a ﬁnite set with three elements.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Consider the sequence

 1
n

= 1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, 1
5, 1
6, · · ·. It appears that as n gets
very large, the general term an = 1
n approaches the value 0, although no term
in the sequence is ever 0. On the other hand, the sequence
D
1+(−1)n
2
E
=
0, 1, 0, 1, 0,1,· ·· does not approach any value as n gets very large, because
successive terms continue to alternate between 0 and 1. The terms in the
sequence

 1
n

get smaller with each successive term. That is, for all n ∈N,
we have an+1 < an, because 0 < 1 and n ∈N implies 0 < n < n + 1, which
implies 0 <
1
n+1 < 1
n. If we choose a positive value, say ϵ = .05, how far out
in the sequence

 1
n

must we go before 1
n < .05? Solving the last inequality
for n, we see for n > 20 we have 1
n < .05. Since 0 < an+1 < an for all n ∈N
and since 1
n < .05 for n ≥21, we have 0 < 1
n < .05 for all n ≥21. Notice that
for n ≥21, the set  1
n
	∞
n=21 is a subset of the interval (0, .05)—that is, all of
the elements of the set  1
n
	∞
n=21 are within .05 of 0.
As we have seen, as n gets large some sequences approach a real value while
others do not. We now give a formal deﬁnition of convergence for a sequence
of real numbers.
A sequence < an > of real numbers converges to a real number A if
and only if for every ϵ > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that for every n ∈N
if n > N, then |an −A| < ϵ.
The number A is called the limit of the sequence and usually we write
limn→∞an = A or an →A to denote that the sequence < an > converges to
the limit A.
If a sequence < an > does not converge, we say the sequence is divergent
or “the sequence diverges.”
In the deﬁnition of convergence of a sequence, the real number ϵ > 0 is
the error tolerance and the natural number N, which usually depends on
the choice of ϵ, tells us how far out in the sequence we must go in order to
guarantee that for all n > N the distance between an and A is less than ϵ.
Let c be a real constant. The constant sequence c, c, c, · · · converges to the
limit c. To prove this, let ϵ > 0 be given. Choose N = 1. Then for all natural
numbers n > N, we have |c −c| = 0 < ϵ. It follows from the deﬁnition of
convergence that limn→∞c = c.
Now let us use the deﬁnition of convergence to prove that the sequence

 1
n
 converges to 0.
Our reasoning and “scratch work” for the required
proof proceeds as follows.
Given any real number ϵ > 0, we must deter-
mine how to choose a natural number N such that if n > N, then
 1
n −0
 < ϵ.
First, we notice that if n > N > 0, then

n > 0. Consequently, if n > N,

such an N. Thus, our theorem and proof that limn→∞1
n = 0 reads as follows.

a100 = 30001
20005 ≈1.499675
a1000 = 3000001
2000005 ≈1.499997.
(The symbol ≈is read “is approximately.”) Based on these calculations, our
estimate for the limit of the sequence is 1.5 = 3/2.

How do we prove a sequence diverges? First, we write the deﬁnition of con-
vergence more symbolically, so it will be easier to negate and write correctly
in English. The symbolic deﬁnition of convergence is
(2)
lim
n→∞an = A ⇔(∀ϵ > 0)(∃N ∈N)(∀n ∈N)[(n > N) ⇒(|an −A| < ϵ)].
Recalling that the negation of the statement P ⇒Q is ¬(¬P ∨Q) ≡P ∧(¬Q),
we negate (2) and obtain the following deﬁnition:
(3)
lim
n→∞an ̸= A ⇔(∃ϵ > 0)(∀N ∈N)(∃n ∈N)[(n > N) ∧(|an −A| ≥ϵ)].
Statement (3) says “The sequence < an > does not converge to the limit A if
and only if there exists a positive real number, ϵ, such that for every natural
number, N, there exists a natural number n > N and |an −A| ≥ϵ.” In
the next example, we use this statement to prove that a particular sequence
diverges.
Example 8.1.2 Prove that the sequence whose general term is
an = 1 + (−1)n
2
diverges.
Solution
Scratch Work: Let A be any real number and suppose limn→∞an = A.
The terms of the sequence are 0, 1, 0, 1,· ··. Since the distance between the two
values 0 and 1 is 1, we choose ϵ = 1/2. (Any value of ϵ less than 1/2 will work
as well.) We must show for any A and any N ∈N there is an n > N for which
|an −A| ≥1/2. We will break the proof into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we
will assume A ≥1/2, while in the second part, we will assume A < 1/2. When
A ≥1/2 and N is any natural number, we choose n to be any odd natural
number greater than N. Then an = 0 and |an−A| = |0−A| = |A| = A ≥1/2.
When A < 1/2 and N is any natural number, we choose n to be any even
natural number greater than N. Then an = 1. Since A < 1/2, we have
0 < 1
2 −A and, therefore, 1
2 < 1 −A. Hence, |1 −A| > 1
2.
The following is a proof that the sequence
D
1+(−1)n
2
E
diverges.
Proof: Let A be any real number and let an = 1 + (−1)n
2
. Choose ϵ = 1/2
and let N be any natural number. Suppose that limn→∞an = A. We divide
the proof into two cases.

Proofs from Real Analysis
273
Case 1. If A ≥1/2, we choose n to be any odd natural number greater than
N. Then an = 0 and |an−A| = A ≥1/2. Hence, limn→∞an ̸= A, if A ≥1/2.
Case 2. If A < 1/2, we choose n to be any even natural number greater
than N. Then an = 1. Since A < 1/2, we have 0 < 1
2 −A and therefore
1
2 < 1 −A. Hence, |1 −A| > 1/2. Thus, limn→∞an ̸= A if A < 1/2.
Therefore, the sequence
1 + (−1)n
2

diverges.
■
The following theorem states that the limit of a convergent sequence is
unique.
Theorem 8.2 If a sequence converges, its limit is unique.
Proof: Remark: As with most uniqueness theorems, we assume there are
two distinct objects which satisfy the speciﬁed condition and then reach a
contradiction. We prove this theorem by contradiction. Assume there is a
sequence < an > and two real numbers A and B such that A ̸= B, an →A,
and an →B. Since A ̸= B, we have |A −B| > 0. Let ϵ = |A −B|/3. Since
an →A, there exists an N1 ∈N such that n > N1 implies |an −A| < ϵ. And
since an →B, there exists an N2 ∈N such that n > N2 implies |an −B| < ϵ.
Let N = max{N1, N2}. Then by the triangle inequality, for n > N we have
|A −B| = |A −an + an −B| ≤|A −an| + |an −B| < ϵ + ϵ = 2|A −B|/3.
Since |A −B| > 0, we have proven 1 < 2/3. Contradiction. Consequently, if
a sequence converses, its limit is unique.
■
For obvious reasons, the next theorem is called the “squeeze” or “sandwich”
theorem for sequences. This theorem permits us to determine and prove the
limit of some sequences without appealing to the deﬁnition.
Theorem 8.3 If < an >, < bn >, and < cn > are sequences such that
an ≤bn ≤cn for all n ∈N and if limn→∞an = limn→∞cn = L, then
limn→∞bn = L.
Proof: Let ϵ > 0 be given. By the deﬁnition of convergent sequence, there
exists an N ∈N such that for all n > N, we have |an−L| < ϵ and |cn−L| < ϵ
or
(4)
L −ϵ < an < L + ϵ
and
(5)
L −ϵ < cn < L + ϵ.
From the left inequality of (4), the hypothesis an ≤bn ≤cn for all n ∈N,
and the right inequality in (5), we have for all n > N
L −ϵ < an ≤bn ≤cn < L + ϵ.
Thus, n > N implies |bn −L| < ϵ and by deﬁnition limn→∞bn = L.
■
We can use Theorem 8.3 to determine the limit of the sequence
cos(n2 + 2n)
n

without having to use the deﬁnition of convergence to prove the result. Since
the range of the cosine function is [−1, 1], we have −1 ≤cos(n2 + 2n) ≤1.
Dividing by n > 0, we ﬁnd

n.
By the “squeeze” theorem with an = −1
n →0, with bn = cos(n2 + 2n)
n
, and
with cn = 1
n →0, we conclude
bn = cos(n2 + 2n)
n
→0.
We need the following boundedness deﬁnitions for sequences. Notice the
similarities in these deﬁnitions and the deﬁnitions for bounded sets.
Let < an > be a sequence of real numbers.
The sequence < an > is bounded above if and only if there exists a real
number U such that an ≤U for all n ∈N.
The sequence < an > is bounded below if and only if there exists a real
number L such that L ≤an for all n ∈N.
A sequence < an > is bounded if and only if there exists a positive real
number M such that |an| ≤M for all n ∈N.
For instance, the sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, ·· · is bounded above by 1 (and any
larger real number), it is bounded below by 0 (and any other smaller real
number), and it is bounded by 1 (and any larger real number). The sequence
2, 1, 4, 1
2, 8, 1
4, 16, 1
8, · · · is not bounded above and therefore it is not bounded;
however, it is bounded below by 0. The sequence 1
2, −1, 2
3, −2, 3
4, −3, 4
5, · · · is
bounded above by 1; it is not bounded below; and, hence, it is not bounded.
And the sequence 1, −1, 2, −2, 3,−3, ·· · is not bounded above or below.
The next theorem states that every convergent sequence is bounded. The
number 1 used for ϵ in the proof is arbitrary—we could use any other positive
real number.
Theorem 8.4 Every convergent sequence is bounded.
Proof: Let < an > be a convergent sequence with limit A. Letting ϵ = 1
in the deﬁnition of convergence, there exists a natural number N such that
|an −A| < 1 for all n > N. Because ||an| −|A|| < |an −A|, for all n > N we
have ||an|−|A|| < 1, which implies for all n > N that |an|−|A| < 1 and hence
|an| < 1 + |A|. Let B = max{|a1|, |a2|, . . ., |aN|, 1 + |A|}. Then |an| ≤B for
all n ∈N. That is, the sequence < an > is bounded.
■
Stated in the more usual “if . . ., then . . .” form, Theorem 8.4 says “If a
sequence converges, then it is bounded.” The contrapositive of Theorem 8.4
is the theorem which says “If a sequence is not bounded, then the sequence
is not convergent.” Consequently, we have a valuable method which does not
involve the deﬁnition of convergence for showing that a sequence does not
converge. For example, we know from the contrapositive of Theorem 8.4 that
the sequences < logn >, < n >, < n2 >, and < 2n > do not converge,
because they are not bounded.

Limit Theorems for Sequences
As the expression for the general term of a sequence becomes more com-
plicated, it becomes more diﬃcult to prove what the limit of the sequence is
from the deﬁnition. Consequently, it is important for us to prove some theo-
rems about limits which will allow us to calculate limits more easily. The next
four theorems contain some basic results regarding the relationship between
limits and algebraic combinations of sequences. Each proof of a theorem will
require using the triangle inequality, as do many proofs in real analysis. Re-
call the triangle inequality says “For real numbers x and y, the inequality
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y| is valid.”
The ﬁrst theorem we prove states “The sum of two convergent sequences is
a convergent sequence, and the limit of the sum of the sequences is the sum
of the limits of the sequences.”
Theorem 8.5
If the sequence < an > converges to A and the sequence
< bn > converges to B, then the sequence < an + bn > converges to A + B.
Scratch Work:
To prove an + bn →A + B, we must prove that for
every ϵ > 0 there exists a natural number N such that if n > N, then
|(an + bn) −(A + B)| < ϵ. From the hypotheses of the theorem, we know
(i) for every ϵ1 > 0 there exists a natural number N1 such that n > N1
implies |an −A| < ϵ1
and
(ii) for every ϵ2 > 0 there exists a natural number N2 such that n > N2
implies |bn −B| < ϵ2.
It follows from (i) and (ii) that by making N1 suﬃciently large, we can make
|an −A| as small as we like and by making N2 suﬃciently large, we can
make |bn −B| as small as we like. We must use this information to make
the quantity |(an + bn) −(A + B)| < ϵ. Thus, we need to be able to rewrite
|(an + bn) −(A + B)| in terms of |an −A| and |bn −B|. Rearranging terms
and using the triangle inequality, we ﬁnd
|(an + bn) −(A + B)| = |(an −A) + (bn −B)| ≤|(an −A)| + |(bn −B)|.
Given ϵ > 0, if we choose ϵ1 = ϵ/2 and ϵ2 = ϵ/2, then there exists an N1 such
that n > N1 implies |an −A| < ϵ/2 and there exists an N2 such that n > N2
implies |bn −B| < ϵ/2. Choosing N = max{N1, N2}, we have for n > N both
|an −A| < ϵ/2 and |bn −B| < ϵ/2; therefore, |(an + bn) −(A + B)| < ϵ.
Remark: We could have selected ϵ1 < ϵ/4 and ϵ2 < 3ϵ/4 or any other
combination for which ϵ1 + ϵ2 ≤ϵ and proved the result. The following is our
proof of Theorem 8.5.
Proof: Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since an →A there exists a natural number N1
such that n > N1 implies |an −A| < ϵ/2. Since bn →B there exists a natural
number N2 such that n > N2 implies |bn −B| < ϵ/2. Let N = max{N1, N2}.
For n > N, we have

■
By mathematical induction, Theorem 8.5 can be extended to the sum of
any ﬁnite number of sequences.
The proof of the next theorem is very similar to the proof of Theorem 8.5.
You are asked to prove this theorem in Exercise 1. The theorem says “The
diﬀerence of two convergent sequences is a convergent sequence, and the limit
of the diﬀerence is the diﬀerence of the limits.”
Theorem 8.6
If the sequence < an > converges to A and the sequence
< bn > converges to B, then the sequence < an −bn > converges to A −B.
As we might anticipate, the product of two convergent sequences is a con-
vergent sequence, and the limit of the product is the product of the limits.
We now state and prove this theorem.
Theorem 8.7
If the sequence < an > converges to A and the sequence
< bn > converges to B, then the sequence < anbn > converges to AB.
Scratch Work: As in the proof of Theorem 8.5, by choosing N suﬃciently
large we can make both |an −A| and |bn −B| as small as we want. Given any
ϵ
>
0, we must determine how to choose N
large enough so that
|anbn −AB| < ϵ. Thus, we need to discover how to rewrite |anbn −AB|
in terms of |an −A| and |bn −B|. A technique that is sometimes used in
analysis is to subtract and then add the same quantity to an expression. In
this case, we can subtract and add either Abn or anB to anbn −AB. We
subtract and add Abn and use the triangle inequality to obtain
|anbn −AB| = |anbn −Abn + Abn −AB| = |(an −A)bn + A(bn −B)|
(1)
≤|an −A||bn| + |A||bn −B|.
Since bn →B, the sequence < bn > is bounded by Theorem 8.4. Thus, there
exists a positive real number M such that |bn| ≤M for all n ∈N. Given
ϵ > 0, we choose N1 suﬃciently large so that |an −A| <
ϵ
2M for n > N1.
Then the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (1) satisﬁes
|an −A||bn| <
ϵ
2M M = ϵ/2.
Given ϵ > 0 we would like to choose N2 large enough so that |bn −B| <
ϵ
2|A|;
however, A could be zero and we are not allowed to divide by zero. So, instead,
we choose N2 suﬃciently large so that |bn−B| <
ϵ
2(|A| + 1) for n > N2. This
choice will ensure that the denominator is nonzero and that the second term
on the right-hand side of (1) satisﬁes
|A||bn −B| < |A|
ϵ
2(|A| + 1) < ϵ/2.
For N suﬃciently large, both terms on the right-hand side of (1) are less than
ϵ/2 and |anbn −AB| < ϵ. Hence, our proof of Theorem 8.7 reads:

Proofs from Real Analysis
279
Proof:
Let ϵ > 0 be given.
Since bn →B, the sequence < bn > is
bounded by Theorem 8.4. Thus, there exists a positive integer M such that
|bn| ≤M for all n ∈N. Since an →A, there exists an N1 ∈N such that
|an −A| <
ϵ
2M for n > N1. Since bn →B, there exists an N2 ∈N, such that
|bn −B| <
ϵ
2(|A| + 1) for n > N2. Choose N = max{N1, N2}. For n > N,
|anbn −AB| = |anbn −Abn + Abn −AB| = |(an −A)bn + A(bn −B)|

By mathematical induction, Theorem 8.7 can be extended to the product
of any ﬁnite number of sequences.
We would like to prove a theorem about the quotient of two convergent
sequence which essentially says “If the sequence < an > converges to A and
the sequence < bn > converges to B, then the sequence
an
bn

converges to
A
B .” However, this statement is false, because the sequence
an
bn

is not
deﬁned unless bn ̸= 0 for all natural numbers and because A
B is not deﬁned
unless B ̸= 0. So we must include the conditions bn ̸= 0 for all n ∈N and
B ̸= 0 in the hypotheses of our theorem. Because an
bn
= an
 1
bn

, we can
use Theorem 8.7 about the product of two sequences to prove our quotient
theorem, provided we can prove the following lemma.
Lemma 8.1 If bn ̸= 0 for all n ∈N and if the sequence < bn > converges to
B ̸= 0, then the sequence
 1

converges to 1
B .

Since bn →B, by choosing N suﬃciently large, we can make the quantity
|bn−B| as small as we like. The quantity |B| which appears in the denominator
is not zero, but we must be certain the quantity |bn| which also appears in the
denominator is bounded away from zero. That is, we must show there is some
M > 0 and some N1 ∈N such that |bn| ≥M > 0 for all n > N1. Since B ̸= 0
and bn →B, there exists a natural number N1 such that |bn −B| < |B|/2 for
n > N1. Since by the triangle inequality
|B| = |B −bn + bn| = |(B −bn) + bn| ≤|(B −bn)| + |bn| < |B|
2 + |bn|,

we have for n > N1 that 0 < |B|
2
< |bn|. Given any ϵ > 0, since bn →B, we
can also choose a natural number N2 such that for n > N2,
|bn −B| < ϵ|B|2

The proof of Lemma 8.1 reads as follows.
Proof: Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since B ̸= 0 and since the sequence < bn >
converges to B, there exists an N1 ∈N such that |bn −B| < |B|/2 for
n > N1. Because
|B| = |B −bn + bn| ≤|(B −bn)| + |bn| < |B|
2 + |bn|,
we have for all n > N1 that 0 < |B|
2
< |bn|. Also since < bn > converges to
B, there exists an N2 ∈N such that for n > N2
|bn −B| < ϵ|B|2

Monotone Sequences and Subsequences
In this section, we deﬁne monotone sequences and subsequences. We prove
that every bounded monotone sequence converges—our ﬁrst theorem which
allows us to prove a sequence converges without knowing the limit in advance.
We prove that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to
the limit of the sequence. And we prove that if two subsequences converge to
diﬀerent limits, then the sequence diverges. Next, we show that every sequence
of real numbers has a monotone subsequence. Finally, we state and prove a
classical and fundamental theorem of real analysis—the Bolzano–Weierstrass
Theorem.
A sequence < an >∞
n=1 of real numbers is monotone increasing if and
only if an ≤an+1 for all n ∈N.
A sequence < an >∞
n=1 of real numbers is monotone decreasing if and
only if an ≥an+1 for all n ∈N.

Proofs from Real Analysis
283
A sequence < an > is monotone if it is either monotone increasing or
monotone decreasing.
The sequences < n >, < 1, 2, 2, 3, 3,3, 4, 4, 4,4,· ·· >, < 4, 4, 4, · · · >, and
< 10−1
n > are all monotone increasing sequences, and the sequences < −n >,
< −1, −1, −2, −2, −3, −3, ··· >, < 4, 4, 4, · · · >, and < 10 + 1
n > are all
monotone decreasing sequences. The sequences < n >, < 1, 2, 2, 3,3, 3, ·· · >,
< −n >, and < −1, −1, −2, −2, −3, −3, · ·· > are unbounded and diverge,
while the sequences < 4, 4, 4, · ·· >, < 10 −1
n >, and < 10 + 1
n > are all
bounded and converge. These results are not coincidental, as we shall see
when we prove the Monotone Convergence Theorem.
Earlier, we mentioned that one property which distinguishes the ordered
ﬁeld of rational numbers from the ordered ﬁeld of real numbers is the prop-
erty of completeness. This property is used to prove many fundamental
theorems of real analysis. Sometimes the property of completeness is called
the Axiom of Completeness or the Completeness Axiom, although it is actu-
ally a theorem which was proved independently in 1872 by both Dedekind and
Cantor. Dedekind used cuts to prove the theorem, while Cantor used Cauchy
sequences.
Completeness Property of the Real Numbers
Every nonempty sub-
set of real numbers which is bounded above has a least upper bound.
The completeness property is an existence theorem which says that given
a nonempty set S of real numbers which is bounded above there exists a real
number which is the least upper bound for S. Geometrically, the complete-
ness property says there are no “holes” in the real number line. Furthermore,
the completeness property could be stated in terms of sets which are bounded
below as follows: “Every nonempty subset of real numbers which is bounded
below has a greatest lower bound.” These two statements are equivalent be-
cause if S is the nonempty set which is bounded below, then −S is a nonempty
set which is bounded above and by the completeness property has least upper
bound m. Hence, −m is the greatest lower bound for S. So either statement
may serve as the completeness property for real numbers. We will need the
completeness property in order to prove the monotone convergence theorem.
Theorem 8.9
The Monotone Convergence Theorem
A monotone
sequence is convergent if and only if it is bounded.
Proof: Suppose that < an > is a convergent monotone sequence. Since the
sequence is convergent, it is bounded by Theorem 8.4.
Now suppose that < an > is a monotone increasing sequence which is
bounded. Let S = {an | n ∈N}. Since S is a nonempty set, by the complete-
ness property there exists a greatest lower bound; call it A. We will prove the
sequence < an > converges to A. Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since A −ϵ is not an
upper bound for S, there exists an N ∈N such that A −ϵ < aN. Because
the sequence < an > is monotone increasing and A is an upper bound for S,
we have for all n > N

284
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
A −ϵ < aN ≤an ≤A < A + ϵ.
Hence, |an −A| < ϵ for all n > N and, therefore, limn→∞an = A.
■
The proof for the case in which the sequence < an > is monotone decreasing
and bounded is similar.
In order to use the deﬁnition of convergence to prove that a sequence con-
verges, it is necessary to know the value of the limit in advance. However, it is
often diﬃcult or impossible to determine the value of the limit of a sequence.
The monotone convergence theorem allows us to prove that a sequence con-
verges without ﬁnding its limit, but we must be able to prove that the sequence
is monotone and bounded.
Example 8.3.1
Deﬁne the sequence < an > recursively by a1 = 1 and
an+1 = √2 + an for n ≥1.
a. Show that the sequence < an > is bounded.
b. Show that the sequence < an > is monotone.
c. Find limn→∞an.
Solution
a. Calculating the ﬁrst few terms of the sequence, we ﬁnd
a2 = √2 + 1 =

a3 =

√
3 ≈1.99571785
Based on our calculations, it appears the sequence is monotone increasing
and is bounded above by 2.
We prove by induction that an < 2 for all n ∈N. Let P(n) be the
statement “an < 2.” The statement P(1) is 1 < 2, which is true. Now,
we assume that P(n) is true for some natural number n. That is, we assume
that an < 2.
Then from the recursive deﬁnition an+1 = √2 + an <
√2 + 2 =
√
4 = 2. Hence, P(n + 1) is true and by induction an < 2 for all
n ∈N.
b. Next, we prove by induction that an ≤an+1 for all n ∈N. Let Q(n)
be the statement “an ≤an+1.” The statement Q(1) is a1 ≤a2 or 1 ≤
√
3,
which is true. Now, we assume that Q(n) is true for some natural number
n. Thus, we assume that an ≤an+1. Adding 2 to this inequality, we get
0 < 2 + an ≤2 + an+1, because an ≥0. Taking square roots and using the
recursive deﬁnition, we ﬁnd
an+1 =
√
2 + an ≤
p
2 + an+1 = an+2.
Thus, the statement Q(n + 1) is true and by induction an ≤an+1 for all
n ∈N. That is, the sequence < an > is monotone increasing.

Proofs from Real Analysis
285
c. By the monotone convergence theorem, limn→∞an = A.
Squaring the
recursive formula yields a2
n+1 = 2 + an. Taking the limit as n approaches
inﬁnity, we ﬁnd that A must satisfy the equation A2 = 2 + A. Solving the
quadratic equation A2 −A −2 = 0 yields A = −1 or A = 2. Since < an >
is an increasing sequence and a1 = 1, the limit of the given sequence is
A = 2.
■
Let < an > be a sequence of real numbers. By deleting a ﬁnite number of
terms from < an > and leaving the remaining terms in the same relative order
as the original sequence, we obtain a new sequence which is called a subse-
quence of < an >. Notice we could delete no terms, in which case we would
have the original sequence. That is, the sequence < an > is a subsequence of
itself. By deleting an inﬁnite number of terms from the sequence < an > so
long as an inﬁnite number of terms still remain, we also obtain a subsequence
of < an >. The following is a formal deﬁnition of a subsequence.
Let < an >∞
n=1 be a sequence of real numbers and let < nk >∞
k=1 be any
sequence of natural numbers such that n1 < n2 < n3 < · · ·. The sequence
< ank >∞
k=1 is a subsequence of the sequence < an >∞
n=1.
By induction on k, it follows from the deﬁnition of a subsequence that
nk ≥k for all k ∈N. When nk = k for all k ∈N, we obtain the original
sequence.

In Example 8.3.2, the original sequence converged to 0 as did all three
subsequences we examined. In Example 8.3.3, the sequence diverged, but we
found two convergent subsequences—one converged to the limit 0 while the
other converged to the value 1. The next theorem pertains to these results.
Theorem 8.10 Let < an > be a sequence of real numbers.
(i) If the sequence < an > converges to A, then every subsequence converges
to A.
(ii) If the sequence < an > has two subsequences which converge to diﬀerent
limits, then the sequence < an > diverges.
Proof: (i) Suppose < an > converges to A and let < ank > be any subse-
quence of < an >. Since an →A, given any ϵ > 0 there exists an N ∈N
such that n > N implies |an −A| < ϵ. Since for all k ∈N, we have nk ≥k.
Therefore, |ank −A| < ϵ for k > N. Hence, by deﬁnition of convergence, the
subsequence < ank > converges to A.
(ii) Our proof is by contradiction. Let < ank > and < anℓ> be subse-
quences of the sequence < an > and suppose that ank →L and anℓ→M
where L ̸= M. Assume the sequence < an > converges to A. Either L or M
is not A because L ̸= M. Therefore, < an > has a subsequence that does not
converge to A, which contradicts (i).

The following theorem is a constructive theorem. The proof of this theorem
contains an algorithm for constructing a monotone subsequence for any given
sequence of real numbers.
Theorem 8.11 Every sequence of real numbers has a monotone subsequence.
Proof: Let < an > be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Deﬁne S to be
the set of natural numbers
S = {n ∈N | an is a lower bound for the set {an+1, an+2, an+3, · · ·}}.
Either S is an inﬁnite set or S is a ﬁnite set.
Case 1.
Suppose S is an inﬁnite set. Testing each natural number n in order,
we generate the sequence of indices contained in S and the associated terms of
the sequence such that n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · and an1 < an2 < an3 < · · ·. The
subsequence < ank >∞
k=1 constructed in this manner is a monotone increasing
subsequence of < an >.
Case 2.
Suppose S is a ﬁnite set. Let N be any natural number that is an
upper bound for the set S. For any n1 ∈N such that n1 > N, we have n1 /∈S,
so an1 is not a lower bound for the set {an1+1, an1+2, an1+3, · · ·}. Hence, there
is a natural number n2 > n1 such that an2 < an1. Continuing in this manner,
we generate a sequence of indices and associated terms of the sequence such
that n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · and an1 > an2 > an3 > · · ·.
Therefore, the
subsequence < ank >∞
k=1 is a monotone decreasing subsequence of < an >.
■
We now state and prove the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem. This theorem
was ﬁrst stated and proved by Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848) in 1817. How-
ever, his proof of the theorem was lost. This theorem also seems to have been
known by Cauchy. About ﬁfty years after Bolzano proved the theorem, it
was re-proved by Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897), who is known as the father of
modern analysis. The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem is a fundamental result
in real analysis.
Theorem 8.12
The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem
Every bounded
sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
Proof: Let < an > be a bounded sequence of real numbers. By Theorem 8.11
there exists a monotone subsequence < ank >. The sequence < ank > is
bounded, because it is a subsequence of the bounded sequence < an >. By
the Monotone Convergence Theorem (Theorem 8.9) the subsequence < ank >
converges.

Cauchy Sequences
In order to use the deﬁnition of convergence of a sequence to prove that
a particular sequence converges, we must know the limit of the sequence.
However, we can prove that a monotone sequence converges without knowing
its limit by simply proving the sequence is bounded.
A large number of
sequences converge which are not monotone. Consequently, we would like a
condition for convergence which does not require the sequence to be monotone
and which does not require knowing the limit of the sequence in advance.
Such a condition does exist. It is called the Cauchy criterion in honor of
the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857). Cauchy is
the second most proliﬁc mathematician in history—second only to Euler.
By deﬁnition of convergence, a sequence < an > converges to the limit A,
provided for all n suﬃciently large (n > N) all of the terms an are close to A
(that is, |an −A| is small). If for n suﬃciently large all of the terms an are
near A, then for n, m > N all of the terms an and am are near one another
(that is, |an −am| is small). Hence, we have the following deﬁnition of a
Cauchy sequence.
A sequence < an >∞
n=1 of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence if and only
if for every ϵ > 0 there exists a natural number N such that for all n, m > N,
if n, m > N, then |an −am| < ϵ.
Our ﬁrst theorem states that all convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences.
Theorem 8.13 Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof: Let < an > be a sequence of real numbers that converges to the limit
A. Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since an →A, there exists an N ∈N such that if
n > N, then |an −A| < ϵ/2. For n, m > N, we have by subtracting and
adding A and then using the triangle inequality

290
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
|an −am| = |an −A + A −am| = |(an −A) + (A −am)|
≤|an −A| + |am −A| < ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ.
Hence, the convergent sequence < an > is a Cauchy sequence. ■
The next theorem states that Cauchy sequences are bounded—as are con-
vergent sequences.
Theorem 8.14 Every Cauchy sequence is bounded.
Proof: Let < an > be a Cauchy sequence. Choose ϵ = 1. Since the sequence
< an > is Cauchy, there exists an N ∈N such that for n, m > N we have
|an−am| < 1. Since N +1 > N, it follows that |an−aN+1| < 1 for all n > N.
Because ||an|−|aN+1|| ≤|an−aN+1|, for all n > N we have ||an|−|aN+1|| < 1,
which implies that |an| −|aN+1| < 1 and hence |an| < 1 + |aN+1|.
Let
B = max{|a1|, |a2|, . . ., |aN|, 1 + |aN+1|}. Then |an| ≤B for all n ∈N and
the Cauchy sequence < an > is bounded. ■
The following theorem says if a Cauchy sequence has a convergent subse-
quence, then the Cauchy sequence converges to the limit of the subsequence.
Theorem 8.15 If < an > is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers and if the
subsequence < ank > converges to A, then the sequence < an > converges
to A.
Proof: Suppose that < ank > is a convergent subsequence of the Cauchy
sequence < an > and suppose ank →A. Since < an > is a Cauchy sequence,
there exists a natural number N such that |an −am| < ϵ/2 for all n, m > N.
Since ank →A, there exists a natural number K such that |ank −A| < ϵ/2 for
k > K. Let M = max{N, K}. Choose nk such that k > M. Then nk > N.
Hence, if n > M, then by the triangle inequality
|an −A| = |an −ank + ank −A| ≤|an −ank| + |ank −A| < ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ.
Consequently, the Cauchy sequence < an > converges to A. ■
In the next theorem, we use the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem and Theo-
rems 8.14 and 8.15 to prove that every Cauchy sequence converges.
Theorem 8.16
Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is a convergent
sequence.
Proof: Let < an > be a Cauchy sequence of real numbers.
By Theo-
rem 8.14, the sequence is bounded.
By the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem
(Theorem 8.12), the Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
By
Theorem 8.15, the Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence. ■
Theorems 8.13 and 8.16 can be combined into the following single theorem.
Theorem 8.17 A sequence of real numbers converges if and only if it is a
Cauchy sequence.

Provided we can prove a sequence is a Cauchy, we can prove the sequence
converges without knowing the limit of the sequence. In Example 8.4.1, we
prove a sequence converges by proving the sequence is Cauchy.
Example 8.4.1 Prove the sequence < an > =
3n + 4

is a Cauchy
sequence and therefore it is convergent.
Solution
Scratch Work: Let ϵ > 0 be given. We must show how to choose a natural
number N such that |an −am| < ϵ for all n, m > N. Assume for deﬁniteness
that n ≤m. We want to select N so that for m ≥n > N,

nm = 2
n < 2
N < ϵ.
Hence, we choose N to be any natural number greater than 2/ϵ.
So our proof that the sequence

is a Cauchy sequence is as follows.
Proof: Let ϵ > 0 be given. Choose N to be any natural number such that
N > 2/ϵ. Then for all m ≥n > N,
|an −am| =

Chapter 9
Proofs from Group Theory
The branch of mathematics which examines, compares, and contrasts
algebraic structures is called abstract algebra. Topics from abstract algebra
appear in many other branches of mathematics, because much of contempo-
rary mathematics is algebraic in nature. In this chapter, we will introduce and
brieﬂy study one of the more fundamental algebraic structures—the group.
9.1
Binary Operations and Algebraic Structures
When we add two real numbers a and b, we perform the operation of
addition and denote the resulting real number by a + b. Likewise, when we
multiply two real numbers, we perform the operation of multiplication and
denote the resulting real number by a · b, or simply, ab. The operations of ad-
dition and multiplication both assign to an ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers
a unique real number—namely, a + b and a · b, respectively. These operations
are examples of binary operations, which we now deﬁne formally.
Let S be a nonempty set. A binary operation on S is a function from
S × S to S.
We usually denote a binary operation on the set S by ◦, +, ·, or ∗and call
the operation multiplication or addition even when the operation has nothing
whatsoever to do with multiplication or addition. If the image of the ordered
pair (a, b) ∈S × S under the operation ◦is c, instead of writing ◦((a, b)) = c
we write a ◦b = c. Also, we often omit the operation symbol ◦and just write
ab = c when it is clearly understood what operation we are using.
An algebraic structure is a nonempty set S, a nonempty collection of
operations on S, and a collection (which may be empty) of relations on S.
For example, the set of integers Z under the usual operation of addition is an
algebraic structure which we denote by (Z, +). The set of real numbers, R,
under the operations of addition, +, and multiplication, ·, and the relation
less than, <, is an algebraic structure called an ordered ﬁeld and is denoted by
(R, +, ·, <). The set of complex numbers, C, under + and · is an unordered
ﬁeld and denoted by (C, +, ·). Let A be a nonempty set and let P(A) be
293

294
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
the power set of A. The power set P(A) under the operation of union, ∪,
under the operation of intersection, ∩, and under the operation of diﬀerence,
−, are all algebraic structures. That is, (P(A), ∪), (P(A), ∩), and (P(A), −)
are all algebraic structures.
However, (N, −) is not an algebraic structure
since subtraction, −, is not a binary operation on the set of natural numbers
(because, for example, 4, 7 ∈N but 4 −7 = −3 /∈N). Let ÷ represent the
operation of division. The structure (R, ÷) is not an algebraic structure, but
(R −{0}, ÷) is. Why?
An algebraic structure (S, ∗) may satisfy all, some, or none of the following
special properties.
Let (S, ∗) be an algebraic system. Then
G1. Associativity: (S, ∗) is associative if and only if (x ∗y) ∗z = x ∗(y ∗z)
for all x, y, z ∈S.
G2. Existence of an Identity: (S, ∗) has an identity element (or simply
an identity) if and only if there exists an e ∈S such that x∗e = e∗x = x
for all x ∈S.
G3. Existence of Inverses: (S, ∗) has inverses if and only if S has an
identity element e and for each element x ∈S there is an element y ∈S,
called the inverse of x, such that x ∗y = y ∗x = e.
G4. Commutativity: (S, ∗) is commutative if and only if x∗y = y∗x for all
x, y ∈S.
Several comments are in order. When (S, ∗) satisﬁes the associativity prop-
erty, G1, we may write x ∗y ∗z without any parentheses because (x ∗y) ∗z =
x ∗(y ∗z) = x ∗y ∗z. That is, as long as the factors x, y, z appear in the same
order and (S, ∗) is associative, we may write (x ∗y) ∗z, x ∗(y ∗z), or x ∗y ∗z
interchangeably. When (S, ∗) is not associative, there exist some elements
x, y, z ∈S for which (x∗y)∗z ̸= x∗(y ∗z). Two elements x, y ∈S are said to
commute if x∗y = y∗x. Property G2 says if (S, ∗) has an identity element e,
then e commutes with every element x ∈S and furthermore x ∗e = e ∗x = x.
A structure (S, ∗) cannot satisfy property G3 unless it satisﬁes property G2.
When (S, ∗) satisﬁes properties G2 and G3, then every element x ∈S has an
inverse y with which it commutes and x ∗y = y ∗x = e. Observe if y is an
inverse of x, then x is an inverse of y—that is, inverses occur in pairs. When
(S, ∗) satisﬁes property G4, every element in S commutes with all elements
in S.
Example 9.1.1 The set of integers with the usual operation of addition,
(Z, +), satisﬁes properties G1 through G4. Property G1 is the associative
law of addition for the integers—namely, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
The
identity element is 0, since a + 0 = 0 + a = a for all a ∈Z. For a ∈Z, the
additive inverse is −a ∈Z and a + (−a) = (−a) + a = 0. Property G4 is the
commutative law of addition for the integers—that is, a + b = b + a for all
a, b ∈Z.

Proofs from Group Theory
295
Example 9.1.2 The structure (N, +) where + is addition for the natural
numbers satisﬁes properties G1 and G4, but it does not satisfy properties G2
and G3. Property G2 is not satisﬁed because 0 /∈N. And property G3 is not
satisﬁed, because (N, +) has no identity element—that is, property G2 is not
satisﬁed.
Example 9.1.3 The set of integers under the usual operation of subtrac-
tion, (Z, −), does not satisfy any of the properties G1 through G4.
Example 9.1.4 The set of rational numbers with the usual operation of
multiplication, (Q, ·), satisﬁes properties G1, G2, and G4. However, (Q, ·)
does not satisfy property G3, because 0 ∈Q has no inverse. That is, there is
no element b ∈Q such that 0 · b = b · 0 = 1.
Example 9.1.5 The structure (Q−{0}, ·) satisﬁes properties G1 through
G4. The identity is the element 1, and for every a ∈Q −{0} the inverse is
the rational number 1/a.
Example 9.1.6 Let S = {p, q, r} and let ∗be the binary operation deﬁned
on S by x∗y = y for all x, y ∈S. For arbitrary x, y, z ∈S, (x∗y) ∗z = z and
x ∗(y ∗z) = y ∗z = z. Hence, (S, ∗) is associative. In order for an element
e ∈S to be the identity of (S, ∗), we must have x ∗e = e ∗x = x for all x ∈S.
However, by deﬁnition of ∗, for every element e ∈S and arbitrary x ∈S
such that x ̸= e, we have x ∗e = e ̸= x. Hence, (S, ∗) has no identity, and
consequently no element of S has an inverse. Also (S, ∗) is not commutative,
since for x ̸= y, we have x ∗y = y and y ∗x = x—that is, x ∗y ̸= y ∗x for
x ̸= y.
Example 9.1.7 Let S = N∪{0} and let ◦be the binary operation deﬁned
on S by a ◦b = |a −b| for all a, b ∈S. The structure (S, ◦) is not associative,
because
(2 ◦3) ◦4 = |2 −3| ◦4 = | −1| ◦4 = 1 ◦4 = |1 −4| = | −3| = 3
but
2 ◦(3 ◦4) = 2 ◦|3 −4| = 2 ◦| −1| = 2 ◦1 = |2 −1| = |1| = 1.
The element 0 ∈S is the identity, because a ◦0 = |a −0| = |a| = a and
0 ◦a = |0 −a| = | −a| = a for all a ∈S. Each element in S is its own inverse
since a◦a = |a−a| = |0| = 0 for all a ∈S. Let a, b ∈S; since |a−b| = |b−a|,
we have a ◦b = |a −b| = |b −a| = b ◦a. Hence, (S, ◦) is commutative.
If S is a ﬁnite set, then the order of the algebraic structure (S, ◦) is the
number of elements in S, which is denoted by |S|. When S is inﬁnite, we
say (S, ◦) has inﬁnite order. For structures with small ﬁnite order, it is often
convenient to represent the binary operation with a table called a Cayley
table or operation table.
The table is named in honor of the English
mathematician Arthur Cayley (1821–1895). In 1849, Cayley published two
important articles on abstract groups in which he deﬁned an abstract group
and used a table to display group multiplication. In 1854, Cayley proved
every group can be represented as a group of permutations. A Cayley table

296
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
for the structure (S, ∗) of order n is an n × n array of products such that the
product x ∗y appears in row x and column y. For example, let S = {a, b, c}
and let ∗be the operation deﬁned by Table 9.1. We see from this table that
a ∗a = c, a ∗b = a, a ∗c = b, and so forth. Notice that the row labels in
the left-hand column and the column labels across the top of the table are
arranged in the same order—namely, a, b, c. By constructing Cayley tables in
this manner, we can check easily for commutativity. When the Cayley table of
a structure is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, which extends
from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the body of the table,
the structure is commutative. That is, when the entry in the (x, y) position is
identical to the entry in the (y, x) position for all x, y ∈S, then the structure
is commutative. Due to the symmetry of Table 9.1, (S, ∗) is commutative.

To ﬁnd the identity element of a Cayley table, if there is one, we look for a
row label in which the entries of the row match the column labels. Then, we
check the column with the same label as the row label to see if the column
entries match the row labels, or not. From Table 9.1, we see that the element
b is the identity, because the entries of row b are a, b, c and the entries of
column b are a, b, c also. The left-inverse of an element y, if there is one,
is the element x which satisﬁes x ∗y = e where e is the identity. To ﬁnd
the left-inverse of the element a in Table 9.1, we search through the column
labeled a for the entry b—the identity. From Table 9.1, we see c∗a = b, so c is
the left-inverse of a. The right-inverse of an element y, if there is one, is
the element z which satisﬁes y∗z = e. To ﬁnd the right-inverse of the element
a in Table 9.1, we search through the row labeled a for the entry b. Since b
appears in the column labeled c, we have a∗c = b, and therefore c is the right-
inverse of a. Because the left- and right-inverse of a are both c, the element
c is the inverse of a. We see from Table 9.1 that the element b has inverse b
and the element c has inverse a. Thus, (S, ∗) satisﬁes property G3. To prove
(S, ∗) deﬁned by Table 9.1 is associative, we must verify for all possible 27
triples (x, y, z) that (x ∗y) ∗z = x ∗(y ∗z). This is tedious to do by hand, but
easy to do by computer. In order to show some structure is not associative,
it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd a single triple (x, y, z) for which (x ∗y) ∗z ̸= x ∗(y ∗z).
The operation ◦of Table 9.2 is not associative, because (a◦a)◦b = b◦b = c
but a ◦(a ◦b) = a ◦b = b. The identity is the element c. The element b is the
left-inverse of a and b, the element c is the left-inverse of c, the element a is
the right-inverse of b, the element b is the right-inverse of b, and the element
c is the right-inverse of c. Consequently, a has no inverse, b is the inverse of

Proofs from Group Theory
297
b, and c is the inverse of c. Thus, (S, ◦) does not satisfy property G3. The
operation ◦is not commutative, because a ◦b = b but b ◦a = c.

The operation + of Table 9.3 is not associative since (a + b) + c = c + c = c
but a + (b + c) = a + a = a. There is no identity element, and consequently
there are no inverses. However, the operation + is commutative, because the
Cayley Table 9.3 is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal.
The following theorem states that an algebraic structure can have at most
one identity.
Theorem 9.1 Let (S, ∗) be an algebraic structure. If (S, ∗) has an identity,
it is unique.
Proof: Assume to the contrary that (S, ∗) has two distinct identity elements
e and e′. By the deﬁnition of an identity, for every a ∈S, (1) a ∗e = e ∗a = a
and (2) a ∗e′ = e′ ∗a = a. In equation (1), we let a = e′. The right-hand
side of the resulting equation is (3) e ∗e′ = e′. Letting a = e in equation (2),
we obtain (4) e ∗e′ = e. It follows from (3) and(4) that e′ = e, which is
a contradiction. Thus, if an identity of an algebraic structure exists, it is
unique.
■
An algebraic structure which is associative and has an identity is called a
monoid. The following theorem states that if an element of a monoid has an
inverse, then the inverse is unique.
Theorem 9.2 Let (S, ∗) be an associative structure with identity e. If a ∈S
has an inverse, then the inverse is unique.
Proof: Suppose that (S, ∗) is associative with identity e and suppose that
there exists an a ∈S and elements x, y ∈S such that x and y are inverses of
a and x ̸= y. Since x and y are inverses of a, (5) a ∗x = e and (6) y ∗a = e.
Multiplying equation (5) on the left by y yields (7) y ∗(a ∗x) = y ∗e = y. By
associativity of ∗and equation (6), we have (8) y∗(a∗x) = (y∗a)∗x = e∗x = x.
It follows from (7) and (8) that y = x, which is a contradiction.

where a and b are both positive could be solved algebraically and geometri-
cally by civilizations which existed prior to recorded history. Approximately
2000 B.C. the ancient Babylonians knew how to solve the quadratic equa-
tion ax2 + bx + c = 0 algebraically by both the method of completing the
square and by substitution into the quadratic formula. They could solve cer-
tain special cubic equations as well. About 1515, the Italian Scipio del Ferro
(ca. 1465–1526) discovered the algebraic solution of the cubic equation of the
form x3 + bx = c. He did not publish his result, but revealed its solution to
his pupil Antonio Maria Fior. In 1535, Niccolo Fontana (1499–1557) claimed
to have solved algebraically the cubic equation of the form x3 + ax2 = c.
(Fontana was also known as Tartaglia (the stammerer), because of a saber
wound he received when he was only thirteen years old at the hands of the
French in the 1512 massacre at Brescia.)
Fior believed Fontana was sim-
ply bragging and challenged Fontana to a public contest. Fontana accepted
the challenge, and a few days before the contest he discovered how to solve
cubic equations of the type Fior could solve.
Knowing how to solve both
kinds of cubic equations, Fontana triumphed completely. However, Fontana
did not publish his methods of solution. In 1539, Girolamo Cardano (Cardan)
(1501–1576), an unscrupulous man who practiced medicine in Milan, met with
Fontana, who revealed his methods of solution to Cardan under a pledge of
secrecy. In 1540, Zuanne de Tonini da Coi proposed a problem to Cardan
which required the solution of a quartic equation. Cardan was unable to solve
the equation, but gave it to his student Ludovico Ferrari (1522–1565). Fer-
rari solved the problem and in the process showed how to reduce the solution
of all quartic equations of the form x4 + px2 + qx + r = 0 to the solution
of a cubic equation.
In eﬀect, Ferrari solved the general quartic equation
x4 +ax3 +bx2+cx+d = 0, since it reduces to x4 +px2 +qx+r = 0 by means
of a simple linear transformation.
Prior to 1545, mathematicians accepted only positive real numbers as roots
of polynomial equations. In his Ars Magna, which was published in 1545,
Cardan accepted negative real numbers as roots of polynomials and used the
square root of negative numbers in computations. He demonstrated that both
x = 5−√−15 and x = 5+√−15 were solutions of the equation x2+40x = 10x.
Cardan included Fontana’s solution of the general cubic equation and Ferrari’s
solution of the general quartic equation in Ars Magna.
Thus, Ars Magna
contains the ﬁrst published solution of both the general cubic equation and
the general quartic equation, although neither was the work of the author.
In his Arithmetica Philosophica of 1608, Peter Roth (1580–1617) appears
to be the ﬁrst writer to explicitly state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
which says that an nth degree polynomial has n roots. The ﬁrst rigorous
proof was given by Gauss in 1799. Later, in 1849, a simpler proof was given.
The Italian physician and mathematician Paola Ruﬃni (1765–1822) was
the ﬁrst person to claim that a polynomial of ﬁfth degree could not be solved
algebraically. In 1799, he published unaccepted proofs that the roots of ﬁfth

300
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
and higher degree polynomials cannot be written in terms of their coeﬃcients
using radicals and the standard operations of arithmetic. Furthermore, in
this article Ruﬃni introduced groups of permutations. Disappointed by the
reaction to his proofs, Ruﬃni published additional proofs in 1803, 1805, and
again in 1813.
In 1824, the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel
successfully proved the result. In 1832, the French mathematician ´Evariste
Galois (1811–1832) gave the ﬁrst deﬁnition of a group; however, it did not
appear in print until Joseph Liouville published Galois’ papers fourteen years
later in 1846. The ﬁrst abstract deﬁnition of a group was given by Cayley in
1854. The term “group” became the accepted standard terminology in 1863
when Camille Jordan wrote a commentary on Galois’ work.
A group is a nonempty set G with a binary operation ◦that satisﬁes the
following three properties:
G1. Associativity: (G, ◦) is associative. That is, (x ◦y) ◦z = x ◦(y ◦z)
for all x, y, z ∈G.
G2. Existence of an Identity: There exists an identity element e ∈G.
That is, there exists an e ∈G such that x ◦e = e ◦x = x for all x ∈G.
G3. Existence of Inverses: Every element x ∈G has an inverse x−1 ∈G.
That is, for all x ∈G there exists an x−1 ∈G such that x ◦x−1 =
x−1 ◦x = e.
To prove that a structure (G, ◦) is a group, we must verify (i) the set G is
nonempty, (ii) the operation ◦is a binary operation from G × G to G, and
(iii) properties G1, G2, and G3 are all satisﬁed. When it is clearly understood
what operation is associated with the group, we usually denote the group
(G, ◦) by just G.
If a group G has property G4—that is, if ab = ba for all a, b ∈G, then
we say the group is an abelian group in honor of Niels Abel. A group is
nonabelian if there is some pair a, b ∈G such that ab ̸= ba. The structures
(Z, +), (Q, +), (R, +), and (C, +) are all abelian groups. In each group, 0 is
the identity and the inverse of a is −a. The structure (N, +) is not a group,
because there is no identity element. The structure (Z, −) is not a group,
because the operation −is not associative. The structures (Q, ·) and (R, ·)
are not groups, because the element 0 has no inverse. However, (Q −{0}, ·),
(Q+, ·), (R −{0}, ·), and (R+, ·) are abelian groups.
Let Zn = {0, 1, . . ., n −1}. For n ≥1, (Zn, +) where + denotes addition
modulo n is an abelian group. The identity element is 0, and for m ∈Zn
and m ̸= 0 the inverse of m is n −m. The group Zn is called the group of
integers modulo n. The structure (Zn, ·) where · is multiplication modulo
n is not a group for any n, because the element 0 has no inverse.
It follows from Theorems 9.1 and 9.2 that a group has a unique identity
and each element of the group has a unique inverse. The following theorem
says the left and right cancellation laws hold in any group.

Proofs from Group Theory
301
Theorem 9.3 Let G be a group. Then the left and right cancellation laws
hold in G. That is,
(1) Left Cancellation Law: For every a, b ∈G, if ab = ac, then b = c.
and
(2) Right Cancellation Law: For every a, b ∈G, if ba = ca, then b = c.
Proof: Remark: We will prove (1) and leave (2) for you to prove as an
exercise. Suppose that G is a group; that a, b, c ∈G; and that (3) ab = ac.
Since a−1 ∈G, we multiply both the left side and right side of equation (3)
on the left by a−1 and use the properties of associativity, inverse, and the
identity e, to obtain
(4) a−1(ab) = (a−1a)b = eb = b
and
(5) a−1(ac) = (a−1a)c = ec = c.
It follows from equations (3), (4), and (5) that b = a−1(ab) = a−1(ac) = c.
■
For a ﬁnite group G, it follows from the left cancellation law that no element
can occur more than once in any row a of the Cayley table for the group. Also,
since a(a−1b) = b for every a, b ∈G, every element b occurs exactly once in
every row a. In a like manner, it follows from the right cancellation law that
every element occurs exactly once in every column a of the Cayley table.
Hence, we have the theorem: If G is a ﬁnite group, then every row and every
column of the Cayley table for the group is a permutation of the elements of
the group. The converse of this theorem is false. In the exercises, we will ask
you to provide an example to prove that the converse is false.
The next theorem says the inverse of the inverse of an element in a group
is the element itself and the inverse of the product of two elements of a group
is the product of the inverses of the elements written in reverse order.
Theorem 9.4
If G is a group and a, b ∈G, then (6) (a−1)−1 = a and
(7) (ab)−1 = b−1a−1.
Proof: Let G be a group and let a ∈G. Since a−1 ∈G is the inverse of
a, we have (8) aa−1 = a−1a = e where e is the identity of G. Because a
satisﬁes equation (8), the property of the unique inverse of a−1, it follows
that (a−1)−1 = a.
Let G be a group and let a, b ∈G. Since a, b ∈G, we have ab ∈G and
(ab)−1 ∈G.
The element (ab)−1 is the unique element x ∈G such that
(9) (ab)x = x(ab) = e. We claim x = b−1a−1. Substituting x = b−1a−1 in
the left-hand side of equation (9), we ﬁnd by associativity, deﬁnition of the
inverse, and deﬁnition of the identity that
(ab)x = (ab)(b−1a−1) = ((ab)b−1)a−1 = (a(bb−1))a−1 = (ae)a−1 = aa−1 = e.
Likewise, substituting for x = b−1a−1 in the center expression of equation (9),
we see
x(ab) = (b−1a−1)(ab) = ((b−1a−1)a)b = (b−1(a−1a))b = (b−1e)b = b−1b = e.
Hence, x = b−1a−1 satisﬁes equation (9) and, by deﬁnition, b−1a−1 is the
inverse of ab.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The following theorem states that linear equations in one variable with
coeﬃcients from a group G have a unique solution which is an element of the
group.
Theorem 9.5 Let G be a group. If a, b ∈G, then there is a unique x ∈G
such that (10) ax = b and there exists a unique y ∈G such that (11) ya = b.
Proof: Remark: We will prove equation (10) has a unique solution and let
you prove equation (11) has a unique solution in the exercises. Let e be the
identity of the group and let a−1 be the inverse of a. Consider x = a−1b ∈G.
We have (12) ax = a(a−1b) = (aa−1)b = eb = b. From equation (12), we see
that x = a−1b is one solution of the equation ax = b.
Suppose x1 and x2 ̸= x1 are both solutions of (10) ax = b. Thus, ax1 = b
and ax2 = b.
Consequently, ax1 = ax2 and by the left cancellation law
x1 = x2, which contradicts x2 ̸= x1. So, x = a−1b is the unique solution of
(10) ax = b.

Subgroups and Cyclic Groups
An algebraic structure (S, ∗) often has embedded within it one or more
algebraic substructures (T, ∗) with the same operations and relations as the
original structure. These substructures can be useful in describing the original
structure. For (T, ∗) to be a substructure, it is necessary that the operation ∗
be a function from T ∗T to T. That is, the restriction of the binary operation
∗to the set T must also be a binary operation. This property is called closure
and is deﬁned as follows.
Let (S, ∗) be an algebraic structure with binary operation ∗and let T be
a subset of S. The set T is closed under the operation ∗if and only if
x ∗y ∈T for all x, y ∈T.
The two statements “T is closed under ∗” and “∗is an operation on T” will
be used interchangeably. For example, the algebraic structure (R, +), the set
of real numbers under the operation of addition, is closed under the operation
+ as are all of the substructures (Q, +), (Z, +), (N, +), and (A, +) where
A = {−1, 0, 1}.
Many times a group has embedded within it one or more groups. These
groups are called subgroups.
Let (G, ◦) be a group and let H be a nonempty subset of G. The structure
(H, ◦) is a subgroup of G if and only if (H, ◦) is a group.
To verify a nonempty subset H of a group (G, ◦) is a subgroup of G, we must
prove (H, ◦) is closed under the operation ◦and (H, ◦) satisﬁes properties G1
through G3.
Let (G, ◦) be a group with identity e. By deﬁnition, the group (G, ◦) is a
subgroup of itself and it is easy to verify that ({e}, ◦) is a subgroup of G. The
subgroup ({e}, ◦) is called the identity subgroup or trivial subgroup of
G.
We can prove a subset H of the group (G, ◦) is not a subgroup of G by
showing that one of the following three things is true.
1. Show that H is not closed under the operation ◦. That is, we ﬁnd two
elements x, y ∈H such that x ◦y /∈H.
2. Show that H has no identity element.
3. Show that some element in H does not have an inverse which is in H. That
is, we ﬁnd an element x ∈H such that x−1 /∈H.
Consider the group (Z, +). The set of odd integers, O, is not a subgroup
of (Z, +), because (i) the sum of any two odd integers is an even integer,
because (ii) (O, +) has no identity element, and because (iii) no element of O
has an inverse since O has no identity. That is, (O, +) fails to be a subgroup
of (Z, +) not for just one of the reasons listed above, but for all three reasons.

306
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
The following theorem states two basic results common to all subgroups—
namely, the identity of a subgroup is the identity of the group and the inverse
of an element in a subgroup is the inverse of the element in the group.
Theorem 9.6
Let (G, ◦) be a group with identity e and let (H, ◦) be a
subgroup of G. Then (i) e ∈H and (ii) if x ∈H, then the inverse of x in H
is the inverse of x in G.
Proof: Suppose that the identity of the subgroup H is the element i. Then
(1) i ◦i = i. Since e is the identity of G, (2) e ◦i = i. From (1) and (2), it
follows that i ◦i = i = e ◦i and by the right cancellation law i = e.
Let x ∈H and suppose that the inverse of x in H is z. That is, suppose
that (3) x ◦z = z ◦x = e. Since x ∈H, the element x ∈G and its inverse in
G is x−1, which has the property (4) x ◦x−1 = x−1 ◦x = e. It follows from
(3) and (4) that x ◦z = x ◦x−1 and by the left cancellation law that z = x−1.
■
The next theorem is an excellent example of the purpose of some theorems—
to reduce the eﬀort necessary to verify a fact. Theorem 9.7 greatly reduces the
amount of work required to prove that a particular set is a subgroup of a given
group. Using the deﬁnition of a subgroup to prove that a set is a subgroup
is often very tedious and laborious. Theorem 9.7 states two necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for proving that a subset H of the group (G, ◦) with
identity e is a subgroup of G. The ﬁrst condition is that H is nonempty. This
condition is usually easy to prove and is often veriﬁed by proving e ∈H. The
second condition is that if a, b ∈H, then a ◦b−1 ∈H. It is normally easier
to prove that a ◦b−1 ∈H than it is to prove both that H is closed under the
operation ◦and that if x ∈H, then x−1 ∈H.
Theorem 9.7 Let (G, ◦) be a group with identity e and let H be a subset of
G. The algebraic structure (H, ◦) is a group if and only if (i) H is nonempty
and (ii) if a, b ∈H, then a ◦b−1 ∈H.
Proof: First, suppose that H is a subgroup of G. Because H is a group,
e ∈H and H ̸= ∅. Let a, b ∈H.
By the existence of inverses property
b−1 ∈H and by the closure property for H, we have a ◦b−1 ∈H.
Now suppose that H ̸= ∅and that (5) a, b ∈H ⇒a ◦b−1 ∈H. We must
prove that the properties G1 through G3 are true for H and that H is closed
under the operation ◦.
G1: Let x, y, z ∈H. Since H ⊆G, x, y, z ∈G and since G is associative,
(x ◦y) ◦z = x ◦(y ◦z). Thus, (H, ◦) is associative.
G2: Since H ̸= ∅, there exists some x ∈H. Letting a = x and b = x in
equation (5), we see that x ◦x−1 = e ∈H.
G3: Suppose that y ∈H. Choosing a = e and b = y in equation (5), we ﬁnd
that e ◦y−1 = y−1 ∈H.
Closure: Let x, y ∈H. We just showed that y−1 ∈H. Letting a = x and
b = y−1 in equation (5), we see that x ◦(y−1)−1 = x ◦y ∈H. Therefore, H
is closed under the operation ◦.

Proofs from Group Theory

Since H is a subset of G; since H is closed under ◦; and since (H, ◦) satisﬁes
properties G1, G2, and G3; (H, ◦) is a subgroup of G.

Example 9.3.1 Let (G, ∗) be an abelian group with identity e. Prove that
the set H = {x ∈G | x ∗x = e} is a subgroup of G.
Solution
Remark: We will use Theorem 9.7 to establish H is a subgroup of G.
First, we observe that H is nonempty, because e ∗e = e. Therefore, e ∈H.
Next, we suppose that a, b ∈H. From the deﬁnition of H, (6) a ∗a = e and
(7) b ∗b = e. To prove a ∗b−1 ∈H, we must prove (a ∗b−1) ∗(a ∗b−1) = e.
Since G is associative,
(8)
(a ∗b−1) ∗(a ∗b−1) = ((a ∗b−1) ∗a) ∗b−1 = (a ∗(b−1 ∗a)) ∗b−1.
Since G is abelian, b−1 ∗a = a ∗b−1. Substituting for b−1 ∗a in equation (8),
we see by associativity and equations (6) and (7) that
(a ∗b−1) ∗(a ∗b−1) = (a ∗(a ∗b−1)) ∗b−1 = ((a ∗a) ∗b−1) ∗b−1
= (e ∗b−1) ∗b−1 = b−1 ∗b−1 = (b ∗b)−1 = e−1 = e.
Hence, by Theorem 9.7, H is a subgroup of G.
■
The next theorem is also very useful in proving a subset of a group is a
subgroup.
Theorem 9.8 Let G be a group with identity e and let H be a nonempty
subset of G. The set H is a subgroup of G if and only if H satisﬁes the two
properties:
(i) Closure: If a, b ∈H, then ab ∈H.
(ii) Existence of Inverses: If a ∈H, then a−1 ∈H.
Proof: Suppose that H is a subgroup of G. By deﬁnition of a group, H is
closed under the operation on the group. Thus, property (i) is satisﬁed. Also
by Theorem 9.6 part (ii) since H is a group, every element in H has an inverse
which is an element of H. Therefore, property (ii) is satisﬁed.
Now, let H be a nonempty subset of the group G which satisﬁes properties
(i) and (ii). By property (i), the set H is closed under the operation on the
group. The associativity property, G1, is proved as in the proof of Theo-
rem 9.7. Since H ̸= ∅, there exists some x ∈H. By property (ii), x−1 ∈H
and by property (i), xx−1 = e ∈H. Thus, H contains the identity element of
G and xe = ex = x for all x ∈H. Consequently, property G2, the existence of
an identity property, is satisﬁed. Property (ii) is property G3, the existence
of inverses, which by hypothesis is assumed to be true. Therefore, H is a
subgroup of G.
■
Example 9.3.2 Let (G, ∗) be an abelian group with identity e. Prove that
the set H = {x ∗x | x ∈G} is a subgroup of G.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
To prove property (i) of Theorem 9.8, we assume that a∗a, b∗b ∈H. Then
by deﬁnition of H, we have a ∈G and b ∈G. Since G is a group, a ∗b ∈G.
Since the operation ∗is associative and commutative (because G is abelian),
(a ∗a) ∗(b ∗b) = ((a ∗a) ∗b) ∗b = (a ∗(a ∗b)) ∗b
= (a ∗(b ∗a)) ∗b = ((a ∗b) ∗a) ∗b = (a ∗b) ∗(a ∗b).
Hence, by deﬁnition of H, we have (a∗b)∗(a∗b) ∈H. Therefore, property (i)
of Theorem 9.8 is satisﬁed.
To prove property (ii) of Theorem 9.8 is true, we assume that a ∗a ∈H.
By deﬁnition of H, we have a ∈G. Since G is a group, the element a−1 ∈G
and by closure a−1 ∗a−1 ∈G.
By Theorem 9.4, the inverse of a ∗a is
(a ∗a)−1 = a−1 ∗a−1, which is an element of H since a−1 ∈G.
Because H under the operation ∗satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) of Theo-
rem 9.8, the algebraic structure (H, ∗) is a subgroup of G.
■
We now introduce exponential notation for elements in a group. Let G be
a group with identity e. For a ∈G deﬁne a0 = e, a1 = a, and for n ∈N
recursively deﬁne an+1 = ana. Since a ∈G, we have a−1 ∈G and for n ∈Z
and n < 0, we deﬁne an = (a−1)−n. Then for m, n ∈Z, we have the familiar
rules of exponents:
aman = am+n
and
(am)n = amn.
We can prove the inverse of an is (an)−1 = a−n. Furthermore, it is true that
(ab)n = anbn if and only if G is abelian.
The following theorem is useful in proving that a nonempty, ﬁnite subset
H of a group G is a subgroup. Using Theorem 9.9 to prove that a nonempty,
ﬁnite subset is a subgroup is usually much easier than using either Theorem 9.7
or Theorem 9.8 to prove that a nonempty, ﬁnite subset is a subgroup.
Theorem 9.9
Let H be a nonempty, ﬁnite subset of a group G. If H is
closed under the operation on G, then H is a subgroup of G.
Proof: The hypothesis of this theorem is property (i) of Theorem 9.8. Thus,
in order to prove this theorem, we need to prove only property (ii) of Theo-
rem 9.8—namely, if a ∈H, then a−1 ∈H. So let a ∈H. If a = e, the identity
of G, then a−1 = e = a ∈H. Now, suppose a ∈H and a ̸= e. Consider the set
P = {a, a2, a3, . . .} of positive powers of a. Since H is assumed to be closed,
each element of P is in H. The set P is ﬁnite because the set H is ﬁnite.
Therefore, there are positive integers i and j such that i > j and ai = aj.
Multiplying the last equation on the right by a−j, we see that ai−j = e. Be-
cause a ̸= e, we have i −j > 1 and i −j −1 > 0. Therefore, ai−j−1 ∈P.
Furthermore, ai−j−1a = aai−j−1 = ai−j = e. Hence, ai−j−1 = a−1 ∈P.
■
For example, the nonempty, ﬁnite subset H = {−1, 1} of the inﬁnite
abelian group (Z −{0}, ·), where · is the usual operation of multiplication,
is a subgroup of Z −{0} by Theorem 9.9 because (−1) · (−1) = 1 ∈H,
(−1) · 1 = −1 ∈H, and (1) · (1) = 1 ∈H.

Proofs from Group Theory
309
The proof of Theorem 9.9 provides us with a method for producing sub-
groups of a group by generating subsets which consist of powers of the elements
of the group. We formalize this result in Theorem 9.10.
Theorem 9.10 Let G be a group and let a ∈G. Then ⟨a⟩= {an | n ∈Z}
is a subgroup of G.
Proof: Remark: We use Theorem 9.7 to prove that ⟨a⟩is a subgroup of G.
(i) The set ⟨a⟩is nonempty, because a ∈⟨a⟩.
(ii) Let am, an ∈⟨a⟩. Then am(an)−1 = ama−n = am−n ∈⟨a⟩.
So by Theorem 9.7, ⟨a⟩is a subgroup of G.
■
We now deﬁne a cyclic subgroup generated by an element a, a cyclic group,
and a generator of a group. Let a be an element of a group G. The cyclic
subgroup generated by a is ⟨a⟩= {an | n ∈Z}. A group G is called a
cyclic group and a is called a generator for G if there exists an a ∈G such
that ⟨a⟩= G.
The next theorem states that “Every cyclic group is abelian.” The con-
trapositive, which is logically equivalent, says that “If a group is not abelian,
then the group is not cyclic.” The contrapositive of Theorem 9.11 is often
used to show that a particular group is not cyclic.
Theorem 9.11 If G is a cyclic group, then G is abelian.
Proof: Let a be a generator for the cyclic group G. If x, y ∈G = ⟨a⟩, then
there exist integers m and n such that x = am and y = an. Multiplying and
using the properties of exponents, we ﬁnd
xy = aman = am+n = an+m = anam = yx.
Hence, the group G is abelian.
■
Let a be an element of a group G. The order of a, denoted by |a|, is the
order of the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩generated by a. That is, |a| = | ⟨a⟩|.
Let us examine the group (U, ∗) where U = {1, 3, 7, 9} and ∗is multipli-
cation modulo 10. The order of the group is |U| = 4. The element 1 is the
identity of the group. The subgroup generated by the identity is always the
set containing only the identity. In this example, ⟨1⟩= {1} and |1| = 1. Since
30 = 1, 31 = 3, 32 = 3 ∗3 = 9, and 33 = 32 ∗3 = 9 ∗3 ≡7 (mod 10),
the cyclic subgroup generated by 3 is ⟨3⟩= {1, 3, 9, 7} = U. Therefore, U is
a cyclic group and 3 is a generator for the group. The element 7 is also a
generator for the group, because 70 = 1, 71 = 7, 72 = 7 ∗7 ≡9 (mod 10), and
73 = 72 ∗7 = 9 ∗7 ≡3 (mod 10). Calculating powers of 9, we ﬁnd 90 = 1,
91 = 9, 92 = 9 ∗9 ≡1 (mod 10), and 93 = 92 ∗9 = 1 ∗9 = 9. So the cyclic
subgroup generated by 9 is ⟨9⟩= {1, 9} and the order of 9 is |9| = 2. Summa-
rizing, we have |1| = 1, |3| = 4, |7| = 4, |9| = 2, and |U| = 4. This example
illustrates that the generator of a group is not unique. What relationship, if
any, do you notice between the order of the elements of the group and the
order of the group?

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Now consider the group (Z4, +) where + is addition modulo 4. The Cayley
table for (Z4, +) is displayed in Table 9.10. The identity for this group is
the element 0, so the subgroup generated by 0 is ⟨0⟩= {0} and the order of
the element 0 is |0| = 1. Because the Cayley Table 9.10 is symmetric, the
group (Z4, +) is abelian. Next, we calculate the subgroups generated by the
nonidentity elements using Table 9.10.
For the element 1, we have 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, (1 + 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, and
((1 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 0. So ⟨1⟩= {1, 2, 3, 0} = Z4 and |1| = 4. Hence,
(Z4, +) is a cyclic group with generator 1.
For 2, we have 2 = 2, 2+2 = 0, (2+2)+2 = 0+2 = 2, and ((2+2)+2)+2 =
2 + 2 = 0. Therefore, ⟨2⟩= {2, 0} and |2| = 2.
For 3, we have 3 = 3, 3+3 = 2, (3+3)+3 = 2+3 = 1, and ((3+3)+3)+3 =
1 + 3 = 0. Thus, ⟨3⟩= {3, 2, 1, 0} = Z4 and |3| = 4.
Summarizing, (Z4, +) is a cyclic, abelian group of order 4 with generators 1
and 3 and |2| = 2. What relationship, if any, do you notice between the order
of the elements of the group and the order of the group?

The Cayley table for the Klein 4-group is shown in Table 9.11. The group
is abelian, because the table is symmetric. The identity is the element 0,
⟨0⟩= {0}, and |0| = 1. Calculating, from Table 9.11:
For 1, we have 1 ⊕1 = 0, (1 ⊕1) ⊕1 = 0 ⊕1 = 1. Hence, ⟨1⟩= {0, 1} and
|1| = 2.
For 2, we have 2 ⊕2 = 0, (2 ⊕2) ⊕2 = 0 ⊕2 = 2. Therefore, ⟨2⟩= {0, 2}
and |2| = 2.
For 3, we have 3 ⊕3 = 0, (3 ⊕3) ⊕3 = 0 ⊕3 = 3. Thus, ⟨3⟩= {0, 3} and
|3| = 2.
Since no element of the group is of order 4, the Klein 4-group is not cyclic.
Consequently, the Klein 4-group is an example of an abelian group which is
not cyclic.
Theorem 9.12 tells us how to calculate the ﬁnite order of an element of a
group and how to write the cyclic subgroup generated by the element.
Theorem 9.12 Let G be a group with identity e and let a be an element of
G of order n. Then n is the smallest positive integer such that an = e and
⟨a⟩= {e, a, a2, . . ., an−1}.
Proof: Because the element a has ﬁnite order n, the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩is
ﬁnite. Therefore, the powers of a cannot all be distinct. Hence, there exist
some integers i and j such that i > j and ai = aj. Multiplying on the right

Proofs from Group Theory
311
by a−j, we have aia−j = aja−j or ai−j = e for i−j > 0. Thus, ap = e for the
positive integer p = i −j. Let P = {q ∈N | aq = e}. Since P is nonempty
(because p ∈P), by the Well-Ordering Principle there exists a least positive
integer m ∈P.
The elements e, a, a2, . . . , am−1 are all distinct.
For if ar = as and
0 ≤s < r < m, then ar−s = e and 0 < r −s < m, which contradicts m is the
least element of P.
By deﬁnition ⟨a⟩= {at | t ∈Z}. Let t ∈Z. By the division algorithm,
there exist integers k and ℓsuch that t = km + l where 0 ≤l < m. Hence,
at = akm+l = (am)kal = ekal = eal = al where 0 ≤l < m. That is, every
element in ⟨a⟩has the form a0 = e, a1, a2, . . . , am−1. Since we have already
proven these elements are distinct, ⟨a⟩= {e, a, a2, . . ., am−1} and n = m by
deﬁnition of the order of a.
■
Example 9.3.3 Let M = {1, 3, 5, 9,11,13} and let ∗denote multiplication
modulo 14. Given that (M, ∗) is a group, ﬁnd the order of the element 9 and
the cyclic subgroup ⟨9⟩.
Solution
The identity of the group is 1. Computing successive powers of 9, we ﬁnd
90 = 1, 91 = 9, 92 ≡11 (mod 14), 93 ≡1 (mod 14). Hence, by Theorem 9.12
the order of 9 is |9| = 3 and the cyclic subgroup generated by 9 is < 9 > =
{90, 91, 92} = {1, 9, 11}.

Appendix
Reading and Writing Mathematical
Proofs
During semesters I teach a course that includes mathematical proofs, several
students usually ask the following questions:
1. “How do I learn to read mathematical proofs?”
and
2. “How do I learn to write mathematical proofs?”
The short answer to ﬁrst question is “You learn to read proofs by reading many
well-written proofs by several diﬀerent authors.” And, the short answer to the
second question is “You learn to write proofs by reading well-written proofs,
by emulating them when you write your own proofs, and by having other
people read your proofs and criticize them constructively.” The remainder of
this appendix is devoted to the long answers to these two questions.
Reading Mathematical Proofs
When you begin to read a proof, you need to have paper and pencil available
in order to make notes and verify computations. First, you need to identify
the hypotheses and conclusions of the theorem. Then, you may wish to make
a quick ﬁrst reading of the entire proof to see what methods the author em-
ployed in proving the theorem and to determine what deﬁnitions and theorems
are used in the proof. You should write down complete statements for the
deﬁnitions and theorems that appear in the proof. During the ﬁrst reading
of the proof, you should not attempt to verify the logic used and you should
not carefully check the computations made. After you have looked up and
learned the deﬁnitions and theorems of the proof, you should read and verify
the proof line-by-line. You must provide justiﬁcations and perform compu-
tations that the author has omitted either on purpose or by mistake. Even
when a mathematical proof is well-written, reading the proof may still be a
slow process. Furthermore, reading a proof that is poorly written is usually
very diﬃcult and exceedingly frustrating. Reading a proof may be diﬃcult
(1) because the order in which the steps of the written proof are presented
does not correspond to the order in which the original proof was developed,
313

314
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
(2) because the author does not tell you explicitly what proof techniques he
is using, (3) because all justiﬁcations are not provided, or (4) because what
should have been presented in several diﬀerent steps in the proof has been
combined into one single step.
Writing Mathematical Proofs
A mathematical proof is a convincing argument which combines elements of
the English language, logic, and mathematics. It is not possible to give a recipe
or prescription for writing a clear, informative, and interesting proof. Every
written proof is a communication between the author and the reader, and
therefore its eﬀectiveness depends upon the skills, temperament, taste, and
knowledge of both the author and reader. Since most mathematical writing is
factual, the simple declarative sentence is the best means of communication
in a proof.
English Usage. Writing is more diﬃcult than speaking, because the tone
of your voice helps you make your meaning clear when you speak.
When
writing a proof use correct diction, grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Write
correctly, carefully, and clearly. Write simple prose. Start every sentence with
a capital letter and end it with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.
When possible, write two short sentences instead of one long, convoluted
sentence. Use the active voice instead of the passive voice. That is, write
“We have observed that . . .” instead of “It has been observed that . . . .” The
word “we” is often used in order to avoid using the passive voice. Also, when
writing mathematical proofs, articles, books, and so forth, use the word “we”
instead of the word “I.” The word “we” refers to the author(s) and the reader
working together as a team to prove a theorem or learn a fact.
Mathematical Usage. Mathematics is symbol-oriented and has a lan-
guage of its own. Therefore, mathematical writing is a combination of English
words and mathematical symbols. Always strive to use the words of logic and
mathematics correctly. The purpose of using good mathematical language is
to make it easy for the reader to understand a mathematical document. The
author’s aim should be to anticipate diﬃculties the reader may encounter and
to alleviate them. A good approach when preparing a written mathematical
document is to pretend that the document is to be read aloud. The basic aim
in writing a mathematical proof is to communicate a newly discovered fact.
Symbol usage. Starting a sentence with a mathematical symbol is discour-
aged. For instance, writing: “(S, ◦) is a cyclic group”is discouraged. Instead,
write “The group (S, ◦) is cyclic.” Rewrite the sentence “x2 −3x + 2 = 0 has
two distinct real roots” as “The equation x2 −3x+2 = 0 has two distinct real

Reading and Writing Mathematical Proofs
315
roots.”
A mathematical symbol represents a word or phrase.
For example, it
is possible for “=” to mean (1) equals, (2) is equal to, (3) be equal to, or
(4) which is equal to. Thus, we could write
“Hence, x = 0.” which may be read “Hence, x equals zero” or “Hence, x is
equal to zero.”
“Let x = 0,” which may be read “Let x be equal to zero.”
“Then x2 + y2 = y2 = 1,” which may be read “Then x squared plus y
squared equals y squared which is equal to one.”
Do not combine English words and mathematical symbols improperly. In-
stead of writing “Every even natural number > 2 may be written as a sum
of two prime numbers” you should write “Every even natural number greater
than 2 may be written as the sum of two prime numbers.” The sentence “The
equation (x −1)(x −2) = 0 implies x = 1 or 2” is not written correctly. It
should be written as “The equation (x−1)(x−2) = 0 implies x = 1 or x = 2.”
When possible, symbols that are not a part of a list should be separated by
words. For example, instead of writing “The sequence an, n < m is . . .” write
“The sequence an where n < m is . . ..” And, instead of writing “In addition
to 1, 2 is a root of the polynomial x2 −3x + 2 = 0” write “In addition to 1,
the number 2 is a root of the polynomial x2 −3x + 2 = 0.”
Display important mathematical expressions, long expressions, and multi-
level expressions on a line by themselves. The following two expressions are
displayed.
(2x −3)3 = (2x)3 −3(2x)2(3) + 3(2x)(32) −33 = 8x3 −36x2 + 54x −27

When a displayed expression will be referred to later, give a reference number
to the expression. The reference number may appear at the left margin or
right margin of the line on which the expression appears. For example,
(1) (2x −3)3 = (2x)3 −3(2x)2(3) + 3(2x)(32) −33 = 8x3 −36x2 + 54x −27
When mathematical expressions are joined by equal signs or inequalities, it
is good idea to display them on more than one line and align the equal signs
and inequality symbols as illustrated below:
(2x −3)3 = (2x)3 −3(2x)2(3) + 3(2x)(32) −33
(2)
= 8x3 −36x2 + 54x −27
When a long inequality or equation such as (2) is written within the text and
not displayed and when it is necessary to break the expression at the end of a
line, the expression should be broken after one of the relation symbols =, ≤,

316
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
<, >, or ≥or after one of the operation symbols + or −. That is, equation (2)
should be written in line as (2x −3)3 = (2x)3 −3(2x)2(3) + 3(2x)(32) −33 =
8x3−36x2+54x−27 or it should be written as (2x−3)3 = (2x)3−3(2x)2(3)+

Developing a Proof and Writing It. The goal of mathematics is to
seek truth. Usually, this is done by formulating a conjecture or having one
presented to you. Your task is to decide if the conjecture is true or false. If
the conjecture is false, then your task becomes one of constructing a coun-
terexample. If you are successful in constructing a counterexample, then you
may want to return to the original conjecture to determine if you can modify
it and make it a true statement. You can often do this by adding one or
more hypotheses or by making the conclusion weaker. Once you have con-
structed a statement that you believe to be true, your task is to prove it is
true. In Chapter 2, several methods for proving theorems were presented and
discussed. Suppose you want to prove the theorem “If A, then B.” First,
look up and then understand all of the deﬁnitions which appear in A and B.
Locate and copy any theorems that have A as hypothesis and any theorems
that have B as conclusion. It is possible, but not too likely, that you will ﬁnd
two theorems: “If A, then C” and “If C, then B.” In this case, your proof
is simply: A implies C and C implies B; therefore, A implies B by transi-
tive inference. If this does not happen, your time is not wasted, because you
will have seen proofs of A implies X for diﬀerent statements X and proofs
of Y implies B for diﬀerent statements Y . Thus, you will have seen some
techniques that may help you start your proof and some techniques that may
help you end your proof. To begin the development of your proof, write the
hypotheses on separate lines at the top of a piece of paper. Then write the
deﬁnitions of the terms that appear in the hypotheses. After each hypothe-
sis and deﬁnition write formulas and equations that are associated with the
hypothesis and deﬁnition. These formulas and deﬁnitions will give you some
idea of how to start your proof. The theorems and proofs you looked up ear-
lier may give you some diﬀerent ideas of how to start your proof also. At the
bottom of the page, write the conclusion of the theorem. Immediately above,
write the deﬁnitions that appear in the conclusion. Above that, write the
formulas or equations that are associated with the conclusion and deﬁnitions.
Next, you try to develop the logical thread of the proof by moving forward
from the hypotheses as much as possible and backwards from the conclusion
as much as possible. The object is to alternate moving forward and backward
logically until you arrive at the same statement located somewhere in the
middle of the proof. If you do not succeed, it may be necessary for you to
apply this proof-development technique to a diﬀerent kind of proof—a proof
by contraposition, a proof by contradiction, a proof by cases, etc. Once you
have developed a sequence of statements, each of which is deducible from its
predecessor or from some known theorem, that extends from the hypotheses
to the conclusion, you have a ﬁrst, rough draft of your proof. You should put

Reading and Writing Mathematical Proofs

your proof away for awhile. Then later reread the proof very carefully and
make changes that will improve it.
Now that you have a proof, you must write it for others to read. When
writing a proof, you must keep in mind the knowledge and mathematical ma-
turity of your readers. You cannot communicate eﬀectively with your readers
until you know who they are. In your case, your proofs should be written for
your instructor, but they should be written at a level that your classmates
can understand. The ﬁrst proofs you write should contain more detail and
justiﬁcation than the ones you write later. It requires practice and experience
to know what you may omit and what you should not omit. Your rough draft
is an outline of your proof and is probably arranged in the order in which you
want to present the proof. However, you should never be satisﬁed with your
ﬁrst draft as your ﬁnal proof. The next step is to add more English to the
proof, being sure to follow the rules cited above. Next, type your proof and
reread it. As you read, be sure to challenge every word, phrase, sentence, and
paragraph. Did you choose the best possible words? Is there some verbiage
that can be removed? Are the sentences presented in the best order? Are the
paragraphs organized properly? Be certain that the statements of the proof
follow logically from one another. Read your proof aloud to yourself. Does
it sound right? Continue to rewrite the proof again and again until you are
totally satisﬁed with the result. Then have someone else read the proof and
constructively criticize it. Then rewrite the proof one ﬁnal time.
The following is an example of developing a proof and then writing it. The
theorem and proof are relatively simple, but they should provide you with
an idea of how the proof writing process goes. Suppose that a homework
assignment is to prove the theorem “The product of an even integer and an
odd integer is an even integer.” First, we rewrite the theorem as a logically
equivalent conditional statement, so that we may more easily identify the
hypotheses and conclusion. A logically equivalent form of the theorem is “If
m is an even integer and n is an odd integer, then the product mn is an even
integer.” We write the hypotheses at the top of a piece of paper and the
conclusion at the bottom. Then we add deﬁnitions under the hypotheses and
above the conclusion as shown below.
Hypothesis: m is an even integer.
Remark: In a proof, you should not start a sentence with a symbol; however,
this is “scratch work,” so no one will see it except you.
Deﬁnition: An integer is a member of the set Z = {. . ., −2, −1, 0, 1,2, ...}.
Deﬁnition: m is an even integer if and only if there exists an integer j such
that m = 2j.
Hypothesis: n is an odd integer.
Deﬁnition: n is an odd integer if and only if there exists an integer k such
that n = 2k + 1.

318
Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Remark: It is very important that the symbol k used in deﬁning n is diﬀerent
from the symbol j used in deﬁning m. When the original deﬁnitions of even
and odd integers were given, it was permissible to use the same symbol in
both deﬁnitions. However, the simultaneous deﬁnition m = 2j and n = 2j −1
implies n = m −1. That is, n is one less than m instead of an arbitrary odd
integer.
Remark: An alternate deﬁnition someone might use for an odd integer is
n = 2k −1. When you are reading a proof, be sure you know and understand
the author’s deﬁnition of an entity.
*
Deﬁnition: The product mn is an even integer provided mn is an integer and
mn can be written as mn = 2ℓwhere ℓis an integer.
Conclusion: The product mn is an even integer.
Next, at location * we compute the product mn and use the associative law
of multiplication for integers to obtain
mn = (2j)(2k + 1) = 2[j(2k + 1)].
Letting ℓ= j(2k + 1), we see that mn = 2ℓ.
We note that mn is an integer, because by hypothesis m and n are integers
and because the integers are closed under multiplication.
Also, we observe that ℓ= j(2k + 1) is an integer because j and 2k + 1 = n
are integers and the integers are closed under multiplication.
We now have a rough draft of our proof, and we need to write it for others
to read. We start by typing the word “Theorem” at the left margin followed
by the original statement of the theorem. Then, we skip a line and type the
word “Proof:” followed by our proof. Here is our completed theorem and
proof.
Theorem
The product of an even integer and an odd integer is an even
integer.
Proof: We prove this statement by proving the logically equivalent statement:
If m is an even integer and n is an odd integer, then the product mn is an
even integer. Assume that m is an even integer. Then by deﬁnition, there
exists an integer j such that m = 2j. Assume that n is an odd integer. Then
by deﬁnition, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1. Computing mn
and using the associative law of multiplication for integers, we obtain
mn = (2j)(2k + 1) = 2[j(2k + 1)] = 2ℓ
where ℓ= j(2k + 1).
Because m and n are integers and because the integers are closed under multi-
plication, mn is an integer. Because j and 2k+1 = n are integers and because
the integers are closed under multiplication, ℓ= j(2k +1) is an integer. Since
mn = 2ℓand ℓis an integer, the integer mn is even by deﬁnition.

As you write a proof, you need to keep your reader informed.
At the
beginning of a proof, you should tell the reader what proof technique you
will use unless the proof is a direct proof. If the proof is a direct proof, you
may just assume the hypothesis. For various types of proofs of the conditional
statement “If A, then B” here are some examples of a few sentences you might
use to start a proof.
Direct Proof
Proof: We assume A.
Proof by Contraposition
Proof: We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive. That is, we
prove that if ¬B, then ¬A. Assume ¬B.
Proof by Contradiction
Proof: We prove this statement by contradiction. Assume A and ¬B.
or
Proof: We assume, to the contrary, that A and ¬B.
Proof by Cases
Proof: We prove this theorem by considering three cases.
Proof by Induction
Proof: We prove this result by mathematical induction. Let P(n) be the
statement . . ..

Exercises 2.2.1
1. Assume m is an even integer. By deﬁnition of even, there exists an integer
k such that m = 2k. Adding 1, we ﬁnd m + 1 = 2k + 1. Hence, by
deﬁnition m + 1 is odd.
3. Assume m is an odd integer. By the contrapositive of Theorem 2.9, m2
is an odd integer. By Exercise 2, m2 + 1 is an even integer.
5. Let m and n be even integers. Then there exist integers r and s such that
m = 2r and n = 2s. The integer m + n = 2r + 2s = 2(r + s). Since r + s
is an integer, m + n is even.
7. Assume m is an even integer and n is an odd integer. Then there exist
integers k and ℓsuch that m = 2k and n = 2ℓ+ 1. Hence, m + n =
2k + 2ℓ+ 1 = 2(k + ℓ) + 1.
Since k + ℓis an integer, m + n is an
odd integer.
9. We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive—namely, if m + 1
is an odd integer, then m is an even integer. Since m+1 is assumed to be
odd, there exists an integer k such that m+1 = 2k +1. By a cancellation
property of addition (Theorem 2.6), m = 2k and m is even.
11. We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive—namely, if neither
m nor n is even (that is, if m and n are both odd), then mn is odd. Since
m and n are both odd, there exist integers r and s such that m = 2r + 1
and n = 2s + 1. Computing, we ﬁnd
mn = (2r + 1)(2s + 1) = 4rs + 2r + 2s + 1 = 2(2rs + r + s) + 1.
Since the integers are closed under the operations of addition and multi-
plication, 2rs + r + s is an integer, and therefore mn is odd.
13. We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive—namely, if it is not
the case that either m and n are both odd integers or m and n are both
even integers, then m + n is an odd integer. Assume m is odd and n is
even. Then there exist integers k and ℓsuch that m = 2k + 1 and n = 2ℓ.
Hence, m+n = 2k +1+2ℓ= 2(k +ℓ)+1. Since k +ℓis an integer, m+n
is an odd integer.
15. We prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose mn is an odd integer
and not both m and n are odd.
Since m and n are not both odd,
at least one is even. For deﬁniteness, suppose m is even. Then there exists
some integer k such that m = 2k. Multiplying, we ﬁnd mn = (2k)n =
2(kn). Hence, mn is even, which contradicts the assumption that mn is
odd.
17. We prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose m −n is an odd integer
and m+n is an even integer. Since m−n is assumed to be odd, there exists
an integer k such that (1) m −n = 2k + 1. And since m + n is assumed
to be even, there exists an integer ℓsuch that (2) m + n = 2ℓ. Adding
equations (1) and (2) yields (m −n) + (m + n) = (2k + 1) + 2ℓ. Hence,
2m = 2k + 1 + 2ℓ= 2(k + ℓ) + 1, which is a contradiction, since 2m is an
even integer but 2(k + ℓ) + 1 is an odd integer.

1.
Proof: We prove this theorem by considering two cases.
Case 1. Assume n is an even integer. Thus, there exists an integer k
such that n = 2k. Consequently, n(n + 1) = 2k(2k + 1) = 2(k(2k + 1)).
Since k(2k + 1) is an integer, n(n + 1) is even.
Case 2. Assume n is an odd integer. Hence, there exists an integer ℓ
such that n = 2ℓ+ 1. Consequently, n(n + 1) = (2ℓ+ 1)((2ℓ+ 1) + 1) =
(2ℓ+ 1)(2ℓ+ 1) + 2ℓ+ 1 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 + 2ℓ+ 1 = 2(2ℓ2 + 3ℓ+ 1). Since
2ℓ2 + 3ℓ+ 1 is an integer, n(n + 1) is even.
3.
Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1. Assume m is an even integer. Thus, there exists an integer k
such that m = 2k. Hence, m3+m = (2k)3+2k = 8k3+2k = 2(4k3+k).
Since 4k3 + k is an integer, m3 + m is even.
Case 2. Assume m is an odd integer. Then there exists an integer
ℓsuch that m = 2ℓ+ 1. Therefore, m3 + m = (2ℓ+ 1)3 + 2ℓ+ 1 =
8ℓ3+12ℓ2+6ℓ+1+2ℓ+1 = 2(4ℓ3+6ℓ2 +4ℓ+1). Since 4ℓ3+6ℓ2+4ℓ+1
is an integer, n(n + 1) is even.
5.
Proof: Let m be an odd integer. By deﬁnition of odd, there exists an
integer r such that m = 2r + 1. We prove this theorem by cases. First,
we assume r is an even integer, and then we assume r is an odd integer.
Case 1. If r is an even integer, then there exists an integer j such that
r = 2j. Thus, for r even, m = 2r + 1 = 2(2j) + 1 = 4j + 1 for some
integer j.
Case 2. If r is an odd integer, then there exists an integer s such that
r = 2s + 1. Hence, for r odd, m = 2r + 1 = 2(2s + 1) + 1 = 4s + 2 + 1 =
4(s + 1) −1. Since s is an integer, j = s + 1 is an integer, and for r odd,
m = 4j −1.
7.
Proof: First, we prove if m3 is an odd integer, then m is an odd integer.
We prove this statement by proving its contrapositive—namely, if m is
even, then m3 even. Thus, we assume m is even. Hence, there is an
integer k such that m = 2k. Consequently, m3 = (2k)3 = 2(4k3) and m3
is even. Next, we prove if m is odd, then m3 is odd. Suppose m = 2ℓ+1
where ℓis an integer. Then m3 = (2ℓ+ 1)3 = 8ℓ3 + 12ℓ2 + 6ℓ+ 1 =
2(4ℓ3 + 6ℓ2 + 3ℓ) + 1. Since 4ℓ3 + 6ℓ2 + 3ℓis an integer, m3 is odd.
9.
Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1. Suppose m is an odd integer. Then there exists an integer k
such that m = 2k + 1. Computing, we ﬁnd 7m −4 = 7(2k + 1) −4 =
2(7k + 1) + 1. Since 7k + 1 is an integer, 7m −4 is odd. We also ﬁnd
5m + 3 = 5(2k + 1) + 3 = 2(5k + 4). Since 5k + 4 is an integer, 5m + 3

is even. Hence, if m is an odd integer, then 7m −4 is odd if and only if
5m + 3 is an even integer.
Case 2. Suppose m is an even integer. Then there exists an integer ℓ
such that m = 2ℓ. Computing, we ﬁnd 7m −4 = 7(2ℓ) = 2(7ℓ). Hence,
7k −4 is an even integer. Also, 5m + 3 = 5(2ℓ) + 3 = 2(5ℓ+ 2) + 1.
Thus, 5m+3 is odd. Consequently, if m is an even integer, then 7m−4
is odd if and only if 5m + 3 is an even integer.
11. Proof: Suppose to the contrary that (1) 111 = p + q + r, where p,
q, and r are even integers. Then there exist integers j, k, and ℓsuch
that p = 2j, q = 2k and r = 2ℓ.
Substituting into (1), we ﬁnd
111 = 2j + 2k + 2ℓ= 2(j + k + ℓ). Since j + k + ℓis an integer, 111
is an even integer. This contradicts the fact that 111 is odd, because
111 = 2(55) + 1.
13.
Proof: Suppose to the contrary that there exist integers m and n such
that 4m + 6n = 9. Using the distributive property of multiplication,
we see that 9 = 2(2m + 3n). Since 2m + 3n is an integer, 9 is even.
However, this contradicts the fact that 9 is odd, because 9 = 2(4) + 1.

17. m = −3,
n = 1
19. x = 0 or x = 1
21. Proof:
Suppose there exist two distinct multiplicative identities 1
and 1∗for the set of integers.
Thus, for all integers m, (1) 1m =
m and (2) 1∗m = m.
Letting m = 1∗in equation (1), we obtain
(3) 1(1∗) = 1∗, and letting m = 1 in equation (2) yields (4) (1∗)1 = 1.
By the commutative property of multiplication 1(1∗) = (1∗)1. Hence,
from (3) and (4), 1∗= 1(1∗) = (1∗)1 = 1. Consequently, the multiplica-
tive identity for the set of integers is unique.
23. Proof: Let x be any real number.
Adding y to both sides of the
equation x2y = x−y, we obtain (1) x2y +y = x or (x2 +1)y = x. Since
x2 + 1 ̸= 0, a solution of (1) is y = x/(x2 + 1). Suppose there exists a
distinct second solution y∗. That is, suppose (2) x2y∗+ y∗= x. From
(1) and (2) it follows that x2y∗+y∗= x2y +y or (x2 +1)y∗= (x2 +1)y.
Since x2 +1 ̸= 0 by the left-hand cancellation property of multiplication
for real numbers, y∗= y.
25.
Proof: Our proof is by cases.
Case 1. Let n be any even integer. Then there exists an integer k such
that n = 2k. The integers k −1 and k + 1 are unequal and (k −1) +
(k + 1) = 2k = n.
Case 2. Let n be any odd integer. Then there exists an integer ℓsuch
that n = 2ℓ+ 1. The integers ℓand ℓ+ 1 are unequal and ℓ+ (ℓ+ 1) =
2ℓ+ 1 = n.

27. Proof: Let n and m be any integers.
Since the integers are closed
under the operation of subtraction, k = n−m is an integer and m+k =
m + (n −m) = n.
29. Proof: We prove this theorem by contradiction. Let m be any odd
integer and suppose (1) m = p + q + r where p, q, and r are even
integers. Thus, there exist integers i, j, and k such that p = 2i, q = 2j,
and r = 2k. Substituting into equation (1), we ﬁnd m = 2i + 2j + 2k =
2(i+j +k). Consequently, m is even, which contradicts our assumption
that m is odd.
31.
Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1. Let m be any even integer. Then there exists an integer k such
that m = 2k. Hence, m2 = 4k2 and 4 divides m2. That is, for m even,
m2 divided by 4 has remainder 0.
Case 2. Let m be any odd integer. Then there exists an integer ℓsuch
that m = 2ℓ+ 1. Hence,
m2 = (2ℓ+ 1)2 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 = 4(ℓ2 + ℓ) + 1.
Thus, when m2 is divided by 4, the remainder is 1.
Consequently, when m is any integer and m2 is divided by 4, the
remainder is 0 or 1.

Then a is odd,
a + b = c, and b is odd or c is even.
3. Counterexample: Let a = 2 and b = −2. Then in the set of integers
a divides b, since a(−1) = b; b divides a, since b(−1) = a; and a ̸= b.

bc = 12, but 6 does not divide b = 3, and 6 does not divide c = 4.
7.
Proof: Suppose a divides b −c and a divides c −d. Then there exist
natural numbers k and ℓsuch that ak = b −c and aℓ= c −d. Adding
these two equations, we ﬁnd ak+aℓ= (b−c)+(c−d) or a(k+ℓ) = b−d.
Since k + ℓis a natural number a divides b −d.

7. Proof: Assume to the contrary that there exists a rational number
p = a/b such that a and b have no common factors and p2 = (a/b)2 =
a2/b2 = 3. Multiplying the last equation by b2, we have (1) a2 = 3b2.
Hence, 3 divides a2. Either 3 divides a or 3 does not divide a. Assume 3
does not divide a; then by the unique factorization theorem (The Funda-
mental Theorem of Arithmetic) a = ±2n2305n5 · · · where n2, n5, · · · are
whole numbers. Hence a2 = 22n23052n5 · · ·—that is, 3 does not divide
a2. Consequently, 3 divides a. Therefore, there exists an integer k such
that a = 3k. Squaring, we have (2) a2 = 9k2. Substituting (2) into (1),
yields 9k2 = 3b2. Dividing this equation by 3, we ﬁnd 3k2 = b2. Hence,
3 divides b2 and by the argument above 3 divides b. Consequently, a
and b have the factor 3 in common, which is a contradiction.

every nonzero real number x has a multiplicative inverse x−1 with the
property that x−1x = 1, multiplication of the equation xy = 0 by x−1
results in x−1(xy) = (x−1x)y = 1y = y = x−10 = 0. That is, y = 0,
which contradicts the hypothesis y ̸= 0.

a. Proof: We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive. Let m
be an even integer. Then there exists an integer k such that m = 2k.
Squaring, we obtain m2 = (2k)2 = 2(2k2). Thus, m2 is an even integer.
Consequently, we have proven the theorem “If m is an even integer, then
m2 is an even integer.” Therefore, its contrapositive is a theorem also.
b. Proof: We prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive—namely,
“If either m is even and n is even or m is odd and n is odd, then m −n

Case 1. Assume m and n are both even integers. Then there exist
integers k and ℓsuch that m = 2k and n = 2ℓ. Subtraction results in
m −n = 2k −2ℓ= 2(k −ℓ). Since k −ℓis an integer, m −n is an even
integer.

results in m −n = (2k + 1) −(2ℓ+ 1) = 2(k −ℓ). Since k −ℓis an
integer, m −n is an even integer.

a. Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1. Assume m is an even integer. Then there exists an integer k
such that m = 2k. Computing, we ﬁnd m(m + 3) = (2k)(2k + 3) =
4k2 + 6k = 2(2k2 + 3k). Because 2k2 + 3k is an integer, m(m + 3) is an
even integer.
Case 2. Assume m is an odd integer. Then there exists an integer ℓsuch
that m = 2ℓ+1. Computing, we ﬁnd m(m+3) = (2ℓ+1)((2ℓ+1)+3) =
(2ℓ+ 1)(2ℓ+ 1) + 3(2ℓ+ 1) = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 + 6ℓ+ 3 = 4ℓ2 + 10ℓ+ +4 =
2(2ℓ2 + 5ℓ+ 2). Because 2ℓ2 + 5ℓ+ 2 is an integer, m(m + 3) is an even
integer.

d. For x > 2, the real number y = −x/(x −2) is negative, because the
numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. The following
computation proves y satisﬁes the equation (1) x + xy −2y = 0:
x + xy −2y = x + (x −2)y = x + (x −2)[−x/(x −2)] = x −x = 0
To prove y is the unique solution of x + xy −2y = 0, suppose y∗̸= y
satisﬁes (2) x + xy∗−2y∗= 0. It follows from (1) and (2) that x + xy −
2y = x + xy∗−2y∗. Subtracting x and factoring, we obtain (x −2)y =
(x −2)y∗. Because, x −2 ̸= 0, y = y∗and the solution of (1) is unique.

11. a. Proof: Using the triangle inequality, we ﬁnd
|x| = |x + y −y| = |(x + y) + (−y)| ≤|x + y| + | −y| = |x + y| + |y|.
Hence, |x| −|y| ≤|x + y|.
b. Proof: From 11a we have (1) |x| −|y| ≤|x −y|. Interchanging x and
y, we get (2) |y| −|x| ≤|y −x| = |x −y|. Multiplying (2) by −1
yields (3) |x| −|y| ≥−|x −y|.
Combining (1) and (3), we ﬁnd
−|x −y| ≤|x| −|y| ≤|x −y|. Therefore, ||x| −|y|| ≤|x −y|.
c. For all real numbers x, y, z, by the triangle inequality
|x −z| = |(x −y) + (y −z)| ≤|x −y| + |y −z|.

15. The statement is true. The proof is invalid.
Proof: Since the square of any real number is greater than or equal to
zero, (x −1)2 ≥0. Squaring, we ﬁnd x2 −2x + 1 ≥0. And adding 2x, we
obtain x2 + 1 ≥2x. Dividing by x > 0, we see that
x2 + 1
x
= x + 1

5. Proof: (i) Let x ∈C. Factoring, we ﬁnd x2 −1 = (x −1)(x + 1) = 0.
Hence, the elements of C are the integers −1 and 1. Since | −1| = 1,
1 ∈D and since |1| = 1, 1 ∈D. Therefore, C ⊆D.
(ii) Let n ∈D. Since n is an integer and |n| = 1, n = −1 or n = 1.
Substituting the real number x = −1 into the expression x2 −1, we see
(−1)2 −1 = 1 −1 = 0, so −1 ∈C. Likewise, substituting x = 1 into
x2 −1 yields 12 −1 = 1 −1 = 0, so 1 ∈C. Hence, D ⊆C.
Since C ⊆D and D ⊆C, C = D.

Proof: Let A be any set and let x ∈A ∩U. By deﬁnition, x ∈A and
x ∈U. Therefore, (1) A ∩U ⊆A.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Let x ∈A. Since U is the universe, x ∈U. Hence, x ∈A ∩U and
therefore (2) A ⊆A ∩U. It follows from (1) and (2) that A ∩U = A.
7. Proof: Let A be any set of the universe U.
By the deﬁnition of
complement,
A′ = {x ∈U | x /∈A} = {x ∈U | ¬(x ∈A)}
and by double negation
(A′)′ = {x ∈U | ¬(¬(x ∈A))} = {x ∈U | x ∈A)} = A.
9.
Proof: Let x ∈A. Then x ∈A or x ∈B. That is, x ∈A ∪B. Hence,
A ⊆A ∪B.
11.
Proof: First, assume A ⊆B and suppose x ∈A ∪B. Hence, x ∈A or
x ∈B. If x ∈A, then x ∈B, since A ⊆B. In either case, x ∈B and
(1) A ∪B ⊆B.
By Exercise 9, (2) B ⊆A ∪B.
Consequently from (1) and (2), if A ⊆B, then A ∪B = B.
Next, assume A ∪B = B. By Exercise 9, A ⊆A ∪B = B. Hence, if
A ∪B = B, then A ⊆B.
13.
Proof: Assume A ⊆B. Let x ∈B′. Then x /∈B. By Exercise 8b
of Exercises 3.1, x /∈A and, therefore, x ∈A′. Consequently, if A ⊆B,
then B′ ⊆A′.
Now assume B′ ⊆A′. By the ﬁrst part of this proof, (A′)′ ⊆(B′)′.
And by Exercise 7, (A′)′ = A and (B′)′ = B. Hence, if B′ ⊆A′, then
A ⊆B.
Consequently, A ⊆B ⇔B′ ⊆A′.
15.
Proof: Assume A = B. Then A ∪B = B ∪B = B and A ∩B =
B ∩B = B. Therefore, if A = B, then A ∪B = A ∩B.
Next, assume A∪B = A∩B. First, suppose x ∈A. Then by deﬁnition,
x ∈A∪B and since A∪B = A∩B, x ∈B. Hence, (1) A ⊆B. Likewise,
x ∈B implies x ∈A; therefore, (2) B ⊆A. From (1) and (2) it follows
that A = B.
17. a. Proof: Let A be any set and assume B ⊆C. Suppose x ∈A ∪B.
Then x ∈A or x ∈B.
(1) If x ∈A, then x ∈A ∪C.
(2) If x ∈B, then x ∈C since B ⊆C. Hence, x ∈A ∪C.
Consequently, if A is any set and B ⊆C, then A ∪B ⊆A ∪C.
b. Proof: Let A be any set and assume B ⊆C. Suppose x ∈A ∩B.
Then x ∈A and x ∈B. Because x ∈B and B ⊆C, x ∈C. Hence,
x ∈A ∩C. Consequently, A ∩B ⊆A ∩C.

Proof: Assume A ⊆C and B ⊆D and let x ∈A∪B. Either (1) x ∈A
or (2) x ∈B.
Case 1. If x ∈A, then since A ⊆C, x ∈C and x ∈C ∪D.
Case 2. If x ∈B, then since B ⊆D, x ∈D and x ∈C ∪D.
In either case, A ∪B ⊆C ∪D.
21. Proof: Let x ∈B. Since A ∩B = ∅,
x /∈A. Thus, x ∈A′. Since
C ⊆A and x ∈A′ by Exercise 8b of Exercises 3.1, x /∈C. Because
x ∈B, x ∈A ∪B and because A ∪B ⊆C ∪D, x ∈C ∪D. Since
x ∈C ∪D and x /∈C, x ∈D. Thus, B ⊆D.

Proof: By Theorem 3.5, X −Y = X ∩Y ′. Thus,
(A ∩B) −C = (A ∩B) ∩C′ = A ∩(B ∩C′) = A ∩(B −C).
3.
Proof: Taking the intersection of A −B and A ∩B, we ﬁnd
(A −B) ∪(A ∩B) = (A ∩B′) ∩(A ∩B) = A ∩(B′ ∩B) = A ∩∅= ∅.
Hence, the sets A −B and A ∩B are disjoint.
5. Proof: Assume A ∩B = ∅. By Exercise 2, A = (A −B) ∪(A ∩B).
Since A ∩B = ∅, A = A −B. Likewise, B = (B −A) ∪(B ∩A) and
since B ∩A = A ∩B = ∅, B = B −A.
7.
Proof: By Theorem 3.5, X −Y = X ∩Y ′. Thus,
(A −C) −(B −C) = (A ∩C′) −(B ∩C′) = (A ∩C′) ∩(B ∩C′)′
= (A ∩C′) ∩(B′ ∪C)
= [(A ∩C′) ∩B′] ∪[(A ∩C′) ∩C]
= [A ∩(C′ ∩B′)] ∪[A ∩(C′ ∩C)]
= [A ∩(B′ ∩C′)] ∪[A ∩∅]
= [(A ∩B′) ∩C′)] ∪∅

Then x ∈A and x /∈B.
Since
x ∈A and x /∈B and x /∈C, x /∈B △C but x ∈[(A −(B △C)], and

therefore x ∈A △(B △C) = [A −(B △C)] ∪[(B △C) −A]. Thus, in
case 1a, (A △B) △C ⊆A △(B △C).
Case 1. b. Suppose x ∈B −A. Then x ∈B and x /∈A. Since x ∈B
and x /∈C, x ∈B−C and x ∈B△C = (B−C)∪(C−B). Furthermore,
since x /∈A, x ∈(B △C) −A and x ∈A △(B △C) = [A −(B △C)] ∪
[(B △C) −A]. Hence, in case 2b, (A △B) △C ⊆A △(B △C).
Case 2. Suppose x ∈C −(A △B). Then x ∈C and x /∈A △B =
(A −B) ∪(B −A).
There are two subcases to consider.
Either
a. x ∈A ∩B or b. x ∈(A ∪B)′ = A′ ∩B′.
Case 2. a. Suppose x ∈A ∩B. Then x ∈A and x ∈B. Since x ∈B
and x ∈C, x /∈B △C = (B −C) ∪(C −B). In addition, since x ∈A,
x ∈[A−(B △C)] and x ∈[A−(B △C)]∪[(B△C)−A] = A△(B △C).
Thus, in case 2a, (A △B) △C ⊆A △(B △C).
Case 2. b. Suppose x ∈A′ ∩B′. Then x ∈A′ and x ∈B′. Thus,
x /∈A and x /∈B.
Since x ∈C and x /∈B, x ∈(C −B) and
x ∈(B −C) ∪(C −B) = B △C. Since x /∈A, x ∈(B △C) −A
and x ∈[A −(B △C)] ∪[(B △C) −A] = A △(B △C). Hence, in
case 2b, (A △B) △C ⊆A △(B △C).
Consequently, by cases (A △B) △C ⊆A △(B △C).
To complete the proof of this theorem, one proves by cases that
A △(B △C) ⊆(A △B) △C.
c. Proof: Let A be any set. By deﬁnition,
A △∅= (A −∅) ∪(∅−A) = A ∪∅= A.
d. Proof: Let x ∈A ∩(B △C). Then x ∈A and x ∈B △C =
(B −C) ∪(C −B). Thus, x ∈A and (1) x ∈B −C = B ∩C′ or
(2) x ∈C −B = C ∩B′. We consider these two cases separately.
Case 1.
Suppose x ∈A, x ∈B, and x /∈C.
Then x ∈A ∩B
and x /∈A ∩C.
Hence, x ∈[(A ∩B) −(A ∩C)], and therefore
x ∈[(A ∩B) −(A ∩C)] ∪[(A ∩C) −(A ∩B)] = (A ∩B) △(A ∩C).
Case 2.
Suppose x ∈A, x ∈C, and x /∈B′.
Then x ∈A ∩C
and x /∈A ∩B.
Hence, x ∈[(A ∩C) −(A ∩B)], and therefore
x ∈[(A ∩B) −(A ∩C)] ∪[(A ∩C) −(A ∩B)] = (A ∩B) △(A ∩C).
Consequently, A ∩(B △C) ⊆(A ∩B) △(A ∩C).
Next, let x ∈(A∩B)△(A∩C)) = [(A∩B)−(A∩C)]∪[(A∩C)−(A∩B)].
There are two cases to consider.
Case 1.
Suppose x ∈[(A ∩B) −(A ∩C)].
Then x ∈A ∩B but
x /∈A ∩C. Since x ∈A ∩B, x ∈A and x ∈B. Since x /∈A ∩C
and x ∈A, x /∈C. Since x ∈B and x /∈C, x ∈B −C, and therefore
x ∈B △C = (B −C) ∪(C −B).
Furthermore, since x ∈A,
x ∈A∩(B △C). Hence, in this case, (A∩B)△(A∩C) ⊆A∩(B △C).

Case 2.
Suppose x ∈[(A ∩C) −(A ∩B)].
Then x ∈A ∩C and
x /∈A ∩B. Since x ∈A ∩C, x ∈A and x ∈C. Since x ∈A and
x /∈A ∩B, x /∈B. Since x ∈C and x /∈B, x ∈C −B, and therefore
x ∈B △C = (B −C)∪(C −B). Thus, in this case, (A∩B)△(A∩C) ⊆
A ∩(B △C).
Consequently, (A ∩B) △(A ∩C) ⊆A ∩(B △C).
In conclusion, since both A ∩(B △C) ⊆(A ∩B) △(A ∩C) and
(A ∩B) △(A ∩C) ⊆A ∩(B △C), A ∩(B △C) = (A ∩B) △(A ∩C).
e. From the deﬁnition of symmetric diﬀerence, we ﬁnd
(1)
A △A = (A −A) ∪(A −A) = ∅∪∅= ∅.
Then it follows from parts b, (1), a, and c that
A △(A △B) = (A △A) △B = ∅△B = B △∅= B.
Hence, X = A △B is the solution of the equation A △X = B.

Proof: Assume A and B are nonempty sets and assume A×B = B×A.
Let a ∈A and let b ∈B. Then (a, b) ∈A × B = B × A. Hence, a ∈B
and b ∈A. Thus A ⊆B and B ⊆A. Consequently, A = B.
Next, assume A = B. Then by substitution of B for A and A for B,
A × B = B × A.
15. a. The given statement is false. Let A = {a}, B = {b}, and C = ∅.
Then A × C = B × C = ∅but A ̸= B.
b. Proof: Let A and B be any sets and let C ̸= ∅.
Case 1. If A = ∅, then A×C = ∅×C = ∅. By hypothesis A×B = B×C.
So, B × C = ∅. Since C ̸= ∅, B = ∅and A = B.
Case 2. If B = ∅, then A × C = B × C = ∅× C = ∅. Since C ̸= ∅,
A = ∅and A = B.
Case 3. Suppose A and B are nonempty sets. Let a ∈A and c ∈C.
Then (a, c) ∈A × C = B × C. Hence, a ∈B and A ⊆B. Next, let
b ∈B and d ∈C. Then (b, d) ∈B × C = A × C. Hence, b ∈A and
B ⊆A. Because A ⊆B and B ⊆A, A = B.
17.
Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1.
Suppose A = ∅. Then A × (B ∩C) = ∅× (B ∩C) = ∅,
(A × B) ∩(A × C) = (∅× B) ∩(∅× C) = ∅∩∅= ∅, and consequently
A × (B ∩C) = (A × B) ∩(A × C).
Case 2. Suppose B = ∅. Then A × (B ∩C) = A × (∅∩C) = A × ∅= ∅,
(A×B)∩(A×C) = (A×∅)∩(A×C) = ∅∩(A×C) = ∅, and consequently
A × (B ∩C) = (A × B) ∩(A × C).
Case 3. Suppose C = ∅. Then A × (B ∩C) = A × (B ∩∅) = A × ∅= ∅,
(A×B)∩(A×C) = (A×B)∩(A×∅) = (A×B)∩∅= ∅, and consequently
A × (B ∩C) = (A × B) ∩(A × C).

⇔(a ∈A) ∧[(b ∈B) ∧(b ∈C)]

⇔[(a, b) ∈(A × B)] ∧[(a, b) ∈(A × C)]
⇔(a, b) ∈[(A × B) ∩(A × C)]
Therefore, A × (B ∩C) = (A × B) ∩(A × C).
19.
Proof: We prove this theorem by cases.
Case 1. Suppose A = ∅; then (A×B)∩(C ×D) = (∅×B)∩(C ×D) =
∅∩(C×D) = ∅and (A∩C)×(B∩D) = (∅∩C)×(B∩D) = ∅×(B∩D) = ∅.
Hence, (A × B) ∩(C × D) = (A ∩C) × (B ∩D).
Case 2. Suppose B = ∅; then (A×B)∩(C ×D) = (A×∅)∩(C ×D) =
∅∩(C×D) = ∅and (A∩C)×(B∩D) = (A∩C)×(∅∩D) = (A∩C)×∅= ∅.
Hence, (A × B) ∩(C × D) = (A ∩C) × (B ∪D).
Case 3. Suppose C = ∅; then (A×B)∩(C ×D) = (A×B)∩(∅×D) =
(A×B)∩∅= ∅and (A∩C)×(B∩D) = (A∩∅)×(B∩D) = ∅×(B∪D) = ∅.
Hence, (A × B) ∩(C × D) = (A ∩C) × (B ∩D).
Case 4. Suppose D = ∅; then (A×B)∩(C ×D) = (A×B)∩(C ×∅) =
(A×B)∩∅= ∅and (A∩C)×(B∩D) = (A∩C)×(B∩∅) = (A∩C)×∅= ∅.
Hence, (A × B) ∩(C × D) = (A ∩C) × (B ∩D).
Case 5. Assume A ̸= ∅, B ̸= ∅, C ̸= ∅, and D ̸= ∅. Then
(x, y) ∈(A × B) ∩(C × D) ⇔[(x, y) ∈A × B] ∧[(x, y) ∈C × D]
⇔(x ∈A) ∧(y ∈B) ∧(x ∈C) ∧(y ∈D)
⇔[(x ∈A) ∧(x ∈C)] ∧[(y ∈B) ∧(y ∈D)]
⇔(x ∈A ∩C) ∧(y ∈B ∩D)
⇔(x, y) ∈(A ∩B) × (B × D)
In all cases, (A × B) ∩(C × D) = (A ∩C) × (B ∩D).

That is, (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d.

Assume C ⊂A ∩B and let x be an arbitrary element of C. Since
C ⊂A ∩B, x ∈A and x ∈B. Therefore, C ⊂A and C ⊂B.
Assume C ⊂A and C ⊂A and let x be an arbitrary element of C.
Since C ⊂A, x ∈A and since C ⊂B, x ∈B. Hence, x ∈A ∩B and
C ⊂A ∩B.

⇔(x, y) ∈A × C and (x, y) ∈B × C
⇔(x, y) ∈(A × B) ∩(B × C)

⇔(x, y) ∈A × C or (x, y) ∈B × C
⇔(x, y) ∈(A × C) ∪(B × C)
c. Proof: Let (x, y) ∈((A × C) −(B × C)). Then (x, y) ∈A × C,
which implies that x ∈A and y ∈C. Also, (x, y) ̸∈B × C. Since
y ∈C, it follows that x ̸∈B.
Because x ∈A and x ̸∈B,
x ∈(A −B). Furthermore, since y ∈C, (x, y) ∈(A −B) × C.
Hence, ((A × C) −(B × C)) ⊆(A −B) × C.

T1. Proof: x < 0 ⇔x −0 is positive. ⇔x is positive.
T3. Proof: Let x, y ∈R. Then y −x ∈R and by axiom O1, exactly
one of the following statements is true:
(1) y −x = 0, in which case x = y.

(2) y −x is positive. Thus, by T1, 0 < y −x and x < y.
(3) −(y −x) is positive. Hence, by T1, 0 < x −y and y < x.
T5. Proof:
By deﬁnition, x < 0 ⇔0 −x = −x is positive.
⇔
x is negative.
T7. Proof: By T5, since x < 0 and y < 0, x and y are negative, and
therefore −x and −y are positive. By axiom O3, (−x)(−y) = xy is
positive. Consequently, by T1, xy > 0.
T9. Proof: By T3 with x = 0 and y = 1, exactly one of the following
statements is true: (1) 0 = 1, (2) 0 < 1, or (3) 1 < 0. Clearly, (1) is
false. Suppose (3) is true. By T7 with x = y = 1, 1 · 1 = 1 > 0, which
contradicts Theorem T3, because 1 < 0 and 1 > 0 are both true.
T10. First, we prove two lemmas.
Lemma 1. Let x and y be real numbers. If x > 0 and y < 0, then
xy < 0.
Proof: Since y < 0, by T5, y is negative and by deﬁnition −y is positive.
Since x > 0, by T1, x is positive. By axiom O3, x(−y) = −(xy) is
positive. Thus, by deﬁnition, xy is negative and by T5, xy < 0.
Lemma 2. Let z be a real number. If z > 0, then 1
z > 0.
Proof:
By T3, exactly one of the following is true:
(1) 1
z
= 0,
(2) 1
z < 0, or (3) 0 < 1
z . Because z ·
1
z

= 1 ̸= 0, statement (1)
is false. Suppose 1
z < 0. Then, by Lemma 1,
1
z

· z = 1 < 0, which is
false by T9. Hence, 0 < 1
z .
Proof of T10: Assume 0 < x < y. Because 0 < x and 0 < y, x and
y are positive and by axiom O3, xy is positive. Hence, by T1, xy > 0
and by Lemma 2, 1
xy > 0. Since y > 0, by Lemma 2, (4) 0 < 1
y . Since
x < y, we have y−x > 0. Because 1
xy > 0 and y−x > 0, 1
xy (y−x) > 0.
That is, 1
x −1
y > 0 and (5) 1
x > 1
y . It follows from (4) and (5) that
0 < 1
y < 1
x.
T11.
Proof: Since x < y, y −x is positive.
By T1, z is positive
because 0 < z. By axiom O3, (y −x)z = yz −xz is positive, and by T1,
yz −xy > 0. Hence, yz > xz and xz < yz.
T13. Proof: Assume x < y. Then y −x > 0. Since −(−y) = y, by
substitution −(−y) −x = (−x) −(−y) > 0. Hence, −y < −x.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
T15. Proof: Since z < w, w −z > 0. And since x > 0, x(w −z) =
xw −xz > 0. Therefore, (1) xz < xw. Since x < y, y −x > 0, and since
w > 0, (y −x)w = yw −xw > 0. Hence, (2) xw < yw. It follows from
(1) and (2) by T2 that xz < yw.
Because zw < yw,
yw −xz > 0. Since z > 0 and w > 0, zw > 0
and by Lemma 2 in the proof of T10,
1
zw > 0.
Multiplication and
cancellation yields
1
zw(yw −xz) = y
z −x
w > 0. Therefore, x
w < y
z .
T17. Proof: Assume x ≤y and y ≤x. Since x ≤y, either x < y or
x = y. And since y ≤x, either y < x or y = x. There are four cases to
consider.
Case 1. Suppose x < y and y < x. By T2, x < x. This is a contradic-
tion.
Case 2. Suppose x < y and y = x. By substitution x < x. This is a
contradiction.
Case 3. Suppose x = y and y < x. By substitution x < x. This is a
contradiction.
Case 4. Suppose x = y and y = x. Then x = y.
Consequently, if x ≤y and y ≤x, then x = y.
T19. Proof: Assume x ≤y and z < 0. Since x ≤y, either x < y or
x = y.
Case 1. Suppose x < y. Then y −x > 0 and since z < 0, (y −x)z =
yz −xz < 0. Therefore, yz < xz.
Case 2. Suppose x = y. Then xz = yz.
From cases 1 and 2, it follows that if x ≤y and z < 0, then yz ≤xz.

Proof: We prove this theorem by contradiction. Assume S is a non-
empty set of real numbers with greatest lower bound m and suppose
there exists an ϵ1 > 0 such that for every x ∈S, x > m + ϵ1. Hence,
m + ϵ1 is a lower bound for S and since ϵ1 > 0, m + ϵ1 > m. Therefore,
m is not the greatest lower bound for S. Contradiction.

Proof: Assume a ∈A. Since a2 > 0, (a, a) ∈P and P is reﬂexive on A.
Assume (a, b) ∈P. Then ab > 0. Since multiplication is commutative
in the set of real numbers, ba > 0 and (b, a) ∈P. Hence, P is symmetric
on A. Assume (a, b), (b, c) ∈P. Then ab > 0 and bc > 0. By axiom O3,
ab2c > 0. By T8, b2 > 0 and by Lemma 2 in the proof of T10, 1/b2 > 0.
By T11, (ab2c)/b2 = ac > 0. Hence, (a, c) ∈P and P is transitive on A.
Since P is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive on A, P is an equivalence
relation on A.

Proof: Suppose x ∈Z.
Since the sum of two odd integers is an
even integer and since the sum of two even integers is an even integer,
(x, x) ∈R. Assume (x, y) ∈R. Then by deﬁnition of R, x + y = y + x
is even. Hence, (y, x) ∈R. Assume (x, y), (y, z) ∈R. Then x + y and
y + z are even integers. Adding, we ﬁnd x + 2y + z is an even integer.
Since 2y is an even integer, and since the diﬀerence of two even integers
is even, (x + 2y + z) −2y = x + z is even and (x, z) ∈R. Consequently,
R is an equivalence relation on Z.
9.
Proof: Let x ∈Z. Then x −x = 0 = 3 · 0. Hence, (x, x) ∈T and T is
reﬂexive. Suppose (x, y) ∈T. By deﬁnition of T, there exists a k ∈Z
such that x−y = 3k. Multiplying this equation by −1 and rearranging,
we ﬁnd y −x = 3(−k). Since −k ∈Z, (y, x) ∈T and T is symmetric.
Suppose (x, y), (y, z) ∈T. Then there exist integers k and ℓsuch that
x −y = 3k and y −z = 3ℓ. Addition yields (x −y) + (y −z) = 3k + 3ℓ
or x −z = 3(k + ℓ). Since k and ℓare integers, k + ℓis an integer,
(x, z) ∈T, and T is transitive. Therefore, T is an equivalence relation
on Z.
11. Proof: Let x ∈N. Since x2 = x2, (x, x) ∈V . Suppose (x, y) ∈V .
Then x2 = y2. Since equality is a symmetric relation, y2 = x2 and
(y, x) ∈V . Suppose (x, y), (y, z) ∈V . Then x2 = y2 and y2 = z2. Since
equality is a transitive relation, x2 = z2 and (x, z) ∈V . Therefore, V is
an equivalence relation on N.
13. Proof: Let (a, b) ∈A. Since multiplication is commutative on the set
of integers, ab = ba and ((a, b), (a, b)) ∈X. Therefore, X is reﬂexive
on A. Suppose ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈X. Then ad = bc. Since equality is a
symmetric relation, bc = ad and since multiplication is commutative,
cb = da. Therefore, ((c, d), (a, b)) ∈X and X is symmetric. Assume
((a, b), (c, d)) ∈X and ((c, d), (e, f)) ∈X. Then ad = bc and cf = de.
Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by f and multiplying the second equation
by b, we ﬁnd adf = bcf and bcf = bde. Hence, adf = bde. Dividing by
d ̸= 0, we obtain af = be. Hence, ((a, b), (e, f)) ∈X and X is transitive.
Consequently, X is an equivalence relation on A.
15.
Proof: Let (a, b) be an element of the equivalence relation E−1. Then
(b, a) ∈E. Since E is an equivalence relation, by symmetry, (a, b) ∈E.
Hence, E−1 ⊆E. Next, let (a, b) ∈E. Then (b, a) ∈E−1. Since E−1
is an equivalence relation, by symmetry, (a, b) ∈E. Hence, E ⊆E−1.
Since E−1 ⊆E and E ⊆E−1, E−1 = E.

a. Proof: Assume R and S are reﬂexive relations on the set A and let
x ∈A. Since R is a reﬂexive relation on A, (x, x) ∈R and since S is a
reﬂexive relation on A, (x, x) ∈S. Therefore, (x, x) ∈R ∩S and R ∩S
is a reﬂexive relation on A.

b. Proof: Assume R and S are symmetric relations on the set A
and let (x, y) ∈R ∩S.
Hence, (x, y) ∈R and (x, y) ∈S.
Since
R is a symmetric relation, (x, y) ∈R implies (y, x) ∈R and since
S is a symmetric relation, (x, y) ∈S implies (y, x) ∈S.
Therefore,
(y, x) ∈R ∩S and R ∩S is symmetric.
c. Proof: Assume R and S are transitive relations on the set A and
let (x, y), (y, z) ∈R ∩S. Hence, (x, y), (y, z) ∈R and (x, y), (y, z) ∈S.
Since R is a transitive relation, (x, y), (y, z) ∈R implies (x, z) ∈R
and since S is a transitive relation, (x, y), (y, z) ∈S implies (x, z) ∈S.
Therefore, (x, z) ∈R ∩S and R ∩S is transitive.
d. Proof: Assume R and S are equivalence relations on the set A.
Then R and S are reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive relations on A.
By parts a, b, and c above R∩S is a reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive

(2) If In, Im ∈P, then either In = Im or In ∩Im = ∅.
(3) S
n∈Z In = R.
(1) By deﬁnition, n ∈In and therefore In ̸= ∅.
(2) Assume In, Im ∈P. Then either n = m or n ̸= m. If n = m, then
In = Im. So, suppose n ̸= m and assume that In ∩Im ̸= ∅. Without
loss of generality, we may assume that n < m and that x ∈In ∩Im.
Since x ∈In, n ≤x < n + 1 and since x ∈Im, m ≤x < m + 1. Since
n < m, n < m ≤x < n + 1, and consequently there exists an integer m
between the consecutive integers n and n + 1, which is a contradiction.
(3) Let x ∈R. By Theorem 4.9, there exists a unique integer n ∈Z
such that n ≤x < n + 1. Hence, x ∈In and S
n∈Z In = R.
13. Proof: Let Sn = {(x, y) ∈R × R | n −1 ≤
p
x2 + y2 < n}. To prove
P = {Sn | n ∈N } is a partition of R × R, we must prove

(2) Assume Sn, Sm ∈P. Then either n = m or n ̸= m. If n = m, then
Sn = Sm. So, suppose n ̸= m and assume that Sn ∩Sm ̸= ∅. Without
loss of generality, we may assume that n < m and that (x, y) ∈Sn ∩Sm.
Then n −1 ≤

x2 + y2 < n and m −1 ≤

x2 + y2 < m. Since n < m,
n −1 < m −1 <

x2 + y2 < n. That is, there exists an integer, m −1,
between the consecutive integers n −1 and n, which is a contradiction.
15. Proof: First, suppose [a]R = [b]R and let x ∈[a]R. Then (a, x) ∈R.
Since [a]R = [b]R, x ∈[b]R and (b, x) ∈R. Because R is symmetric,
(x, b) ∈R, and because R is transitive, (a, b) ∈R.
Next, suppose (a, b) ∈R. By deﬁnition b ∈[a]R and by Theorem 4.14,
[b]R = [a]R.
17. Proof: We prove [a]R ∩[b]R = ∅⇒(a, b) ̸= R by proving its contra-
positive: (a, b) ∈R ⇒[a]R ∩[b]R ̸= ∅. By Theorem 4.15, (a, b) ∈R ⇒
[a]R = [b]R. Since a ∈[a]R and [a]R = [b]R, a ∈[b]R and [a]R ∩[b]R ̸= ∅.
And we prove (a, b) /∈R ⇒[a]R ∩[b]R = ∅by proving its contrapositive:
[a]R∩[b]R ̸= ∅⇒(a, b) ∈R. By Theorem 4.16, [a]R∩[b]R ̸= ∅⇒[a]R =
[b]R. It follows from Theorem 4.15 that [a]R = [b]R ⇒(a, b) ∈R.

13. Proof: Assume R is a symmetric and transitive relation on A and
assume Dom(R) = A.
Since Dom(R) = A, for every x ∈A there
exists some y ∈A such that the ordered pair (x, y) ∈R. Because R is
symmetric, (y, x) ∈R. Since R is transitive and because (x, y) ∈R and
(y, x) ∈R, we have (x, x) ∈R. Therefore, R is reﬂexive on A.
15. Proof: To prove R is an equivalence relation on Z, we prove R is
reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive on Z.
Suppose n ∈Z. Then because n = n + 5 · 0 and 0 ∈Z, the ordered pair
(n, n) ∈R and R is reﬂexive on Z.
Suppose m, n ∈Z and (m, n) ∈R. Then there exists a k ∈Z such that
n = m + 5k. Hence, m = n + 5(−k). Since −k ∈Z, the ordered pair
(n, m) ∈R and R is symmetric on Z.
Suppose ℓ, m, n ∈Z, (ℓ, m) ∈R, and (m, n) ∈R. Since (ℓ, m) ∈R,
there exists a k ∈Z such that (1) m = ℓ+ 5k. Also, since (m, n) ∈R,
there exists a j ∈Z such that (2) n = m + 5j. Substituting for m in
equation (2) from equation (1), we ﬁnd n = (ℓ+5k)+5j = ℓ+5(k +j).
Since k + j is an integer, (ℓ, n) ∈R and R is transitive on Z.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
17. Proof: First, we prove that if A × B = B × A, then A = ∅, B = ∅,
or A = B. If A = ∅or B = ∅, we are done. So, suppose A ̸= ∅and
B ̸= ∅. Let x be an arbitrary element in A and choose any element
y ∈B. The ordered pair (x, y) ∈A × B = B × A. Hence, x ∈B and
A ⊆B. Likewise, B ⊆A and therefore A = B.
Next, we prove by cases that if A = ∅, B = ∅, or A = B, then A × B =
B × A.
Case 1. If A = ∅, then A × B = ∅× B = ∅= B × ∅= B × A.
Case 2. If B = ∅, then A × B = A × ∅= ∅= B × ∅= B × A.
Case 3. If A = B, then A × B = A × A = B × A.
19. Proof: Let x ∈A. Since R is reﬂexive, R(x) = x, and since S is reﬂex-
ive, S(x) = x. Calculating, we ﬁnd (R ◦S)(x) = R(S(x)) = R(x) = x.
Hence, R ◦S is reﬂexive.

a, b ∈A such that (g ◦f)(a) = (g ◦f)(b). Thus, g(f(a)) = g(f(b)).
Since g is one-to-one, f(a) = f(b). And since f is one-to-one, a = b.
Therefore, g ◦f is one-to-one.

a. The solution of the equation m + 2 = 1 is m = −1 /∈N. Therefore,
there is no natural number m which satisﬁes the equation f(m) = m +

R there exists an a in the domain R such that f(a) = b and f is onto.
Since f is one-to-one and onto, f is a one-to-one correspondence.

(2) a = −b. For a = −b and a, b ∈(−∞, 0], the only solution of a2 = b2
is a = b = 0.
Therefore, a = b and f is one-to-one.
Thus, f is a

9. Deﬁne f by f(x) = x and g by g(x) = −x. Then the function (f+g)(x) =
f(x) + g(x) = 0 is not one-to-one and not onto and therefore not a one-
to-one correspondence. Furthermore, (fg)(x) = f(x)g(x) = −x2 is not
one-to-one and not onto.
11. Assume g ◦f = IA. By Theorem 5.12 since f is a one-to-one corre-
spondence from A to B, f−1 ◦f = IA. Thus f−1 ◦f = g ◦f, which
implies (f−1 ◦f) ◦f−1 = (f ◦f) ◦f−1. By associativity of composition
f−1 ◦(f ◦f−1) = f ◦(f ◦f−1). Hence f−1 ◦IB = g ◦IB and f−1 = g.
When we assume f ◦g = IB, the proof is similar.

Suppose y ∈f(∅). Then there exists some x ∈∅such that y = f(x).
Since there are no x in the empty set, we have a contradiction. Hence,
there are no y ∈f(∅) and therefore f(∅) = ∅.

b. Proof: By deﬁnition, f−1(∅) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈∅}. Since there are
no f(x) ∈∅, there are no x ∈f−1(∅)—that is, f−1(∅) = ∅.
c. Proof: The set f({x}) = {y ∈B | y = f(x) for some x ∈{x}}.
Since x is the only element in the set {x} and since f is a function, the
only element in the set f({x}) is f(x). Thus, f({x}) = {f(x)}.
d. Proof: Let x ∈C. Since f(C) = {y ∈B | y = f(x) for some x ∈C}
and since x ∈C, it follows that f(x) ∈f(C). That is, x ∈C ⇒f(x) ∈
f(C).
e. Proof: The set f−1(D) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈D}.
Consequently,
x ∈f−1(D) implies that f(x) ∈D.
f. Proof: The set f−1(D) = {x ∈A | f(x) ∈D}. Suppose f(x) ∈D.
Then, by deﬁnition of f−1(D), we have x ∈f−1(D).
7.
Proof: Assume that C ⊆D and suppose y ∈f(C). It follows from
the deﬁnition of f(C) that there exists an x ∈C such that y = f(x).
By Theorem 5.16.d, x ∈C implies f(x) ∈f(C). Since C ⊆D, we
have x ∈D and by Theorem 5.15.d, y = f(x) ∈f(D).
Therefore,
f(C) ⊆f(D).
9.
Proof: Suppose x ∈C. Then by Theorem 5.16.d, f(x) ∈f(C). In ad-
dition, by Theorem 5.16.f, x ∈f−1(f(C)). Therefore, C ⊆f−1(f(C)).
11. Proof: Suppose y ∈f(f−1(E)). Then there exists an x ∈f−1(E) ⊆
A such that y = f(x).
Therefore, y ∈f(A) = Rng(A).
Since x ∈
f−1(E), by Theorem 5.16.e, f(x) = y ∈E. Hence, y ∈f(A) ∩E and
f(f−1(E)) ⊆f(A) ∩E.
Now suppose y ∈f(A) ∩E.
Hence, y ∈f(A), which implies there
exists an x ∈A such that y = f(x). It follows from the deﬁnition of
f−1(E) that x ∈f−1(E) and then by Theorem 5.16.e that y = f(x) ∈
f(f−1(E)). Hence, f(A) ∩E ⊆f(f−1(E)).
Consequently, f(f−1(E)) = f(A) ∩E, because f(f−1(E)) ⊆f(A) ∩E
and f(A) ∩E ⊆f(f−1(E)).
13. Proof: Because f−1(B) = A by Theorem 5.15 and substitution,
f−1(B −E) = f−1(B) −f−1(E) = A −f−1(E).
15. Proof: Assume that f(f−1(E)) = E for all E ⊆B. Let y ∈B. For
E = {y}, we have f(f−1({y})) = {y}. By Theorem 5.16.c, f−1({y}) =
{f−1(y)} and f({f−1(y)}) = {f(f−1(y))}. Hence, f(f−1({y})) = {y} =
{f(f−1(y))}. That is, for all y ∈B, we have f(f−1(y)) = y. Hence,
f ◦f−1 = IB and by Theorem 5.14 the function f is onto.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
17. Proof: By problem 9, C ⊆f−1(f(C)). Thus, to prove this theorem,
we must prove that if f is one-to-one, then f−1(f(C)) ⊆C. Let x ∈
f−1(f(C)). Then by Theorem 5.16.e, f(x) ∈f(C). Consequently, for
some x′ ∈C, f(x) = f(x′). Since f is one-to-one, x′ = x and x ∈C.
Hence, f−1(f(C)) ⊆C and therefore f−1(f(C)) = C.
19. Proof: By Theorem 5.17, f(C ∩D) ⊆f(C)∩f(D). Therefore, we must
prove that if f is one-to-one, then f(C) ∩f(D) ⊆f(C ∩D). Suppose
y ∈f(C) ∩f(D). Then y ∈f(C) and y ∈f(D). Hence, there exists
an x1 ∈C such that f(x1) = y and there exists an x2 ∈D such that
f(x2) = y. Thus, f(x1) = f(x2) and since f is one-to-one, x1 = x2.
Therefore, x1 ∈C ∩D and y = f(x1) ∈f(C ∩D).
Consequently,
f(C) ∩f(D) ⊆f(C ∩D).
21.
Proof: By Theorem 5.16.d, x ∈C ⇒f(x) ∈f(C).
So, assume f is one-to-one and suppose f(x) ∈f(C). By Theorem 5.16.f
there exists a z ∈f−1(f(C)) such that f(z) = f(x). Since f is one-to-
one, z = x. Also, since f one-to-one, f−1(f(C)) = C by problem 17.
Consequently, x ∈f−1(f(C)) = C.
23.
Proof: Since f is one-to-one, f(A −C) = f(A) −f(C) by problem 20.
And since f is onto, f(A) = B. Therefore, f(A −C) = B −f(C).
25.
Let A = {a, b}, B = {1}, C = {a, b}, D = {a}, and f = {(a, 1), (b, 1)}.
Then C −D = {b}, f(C −D) = {1}, and f(C) = {1} = f(D), so
f(C) −f(D) = ∅. Consequently, f(C −D) = {1} ̸= ∅= f(C) −f(D).

Let f : R →R be deﬁned by f(x) = x2.

17. Proof: Since h ◦h is a one-to-one correspondence, h ◦h is onto. From
Theorem 5.4, if f and g are functions on S and if g ◦f is onto, then g is
onto. Therefore, h is onto. Since h ◦h is a one-to-one correspondence,
h◦h is one-to-one. From Theorem 5.6, if f and g are functions on S and
if g ◦f is one-to-one, then f is one-to-one. Therefore, h is one-to-one,
and consequently h is a one-to-one correspondence.
19. a. Proof: Since g : B →C is not one-to-one, there exists a b1 ∈B
and a b2 ∈B such that b1 ̸= b2 and g(b1) = g(b2). Since f : A →B
is onto, there exists an a1 ∈A such that f(a1) = b1 and there exists
an a2 ∈A such that f(a2) = b2. Because b1 ̸= b2 and f is a function,
a1 ̸= a2. Hence, g◦f is not one-to-one, because a1 ̸= a2 but (g◦f)(a1) =
(g ◦f)(a2).
b. Proof: Since the function f is not onto B, there exists a b1 ∈B such
that f(x) ̸= b1 for all x ∈A. Let a be any element in A and let b2 = f(a).
Clearly, b1 ̸= b2 and since g is one-to-one, g(b1) ̸= g(b2) = (g ◦f)(a).
The function g ◦f is not onto, because there is no x ∈A such that
(g ◦f)(x) = g(b1).
21.
Proof: Let b be an arbitrary element of B. Since f is onto, there exists
an a ∈A such that f(a) = b. Hence, g(b) = (g◦f)(a) = (h◦f)(a) = h(b)

Let P(n) be the statement 3n > n2.
(i) For n = 1, the left-hand side of the statement P(1) is 31 = 3, the
right-hand side is 12 = 1, and 3 > 1. So, P(1) is true.
For n = 2, the left-hand side of the statement P(2) is 32 = 9, the
right-hand side is 22 = 4, and 9 > 4. So, P(2) is true.
(ii) Now, assume for n ∈N where n ≥2 that the statement P(n) is
true. That is, for n ∈N and n ≥2 assume that (1) 3n > n2 is true.
The statement P(n + 1) is 3n+1 > (n + 1)2. Since n ≥2, we have
n −1 ≥1 > 0 and 2n(n −1) ≥2n ≥4 > 1. Hence, 2n2 −2n > 1 or
(2) 2n2 > 2n + 1. Multiplying (1) by 3 and using both (1) and (2), we
obtain
3n+1 = 3 · 3n > 3n2 = n2 + 2n2 > n2 + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)2.
That is, for all natural numbers n ≥2 the statement P(n + 1) is true.
Hence, by the Generalized Principle of Mathematical Induction, 3n > n2

Let P(n) be the statement (1) n! > 2n.
(i) For n = 4, we have 4! = 24 > 16 = 24. Therefore, P(4) is true.
(ii) Assume for n ∈N and n ≥4 that the statement (1) is true. The
statement P(n + 1) is (n + 1)! > 2n+1. Since (n + 1)! = (n + 1)n!, it
follows from (1) that (n+1)! > (n+1)2n. Since n ≥4, we have n+1 > 2
and (n + 1)! > 2 · 2n = 2n+1. Hence, the statement P(n + 1) is true.
Hence, by the Generalized Principle of Mathematical Induction, n! > 2n

(ii) The statement P(n + 1) is (n + 2)! > 2n+4. Assume for n ∈N and
n ≥5 that (1) (n + 1)! > 2n+3 is true. From the deﬁnition of factorial
and the inequality (1), we obtain
(n + 2)! = (n + 2)(n + 1)! > (n + 2)2n+3 = n2n+3 + 2n+4 > 2n+4.
Consequently, by the Generalized Principle of Mathematical Induction,
(n + 1)! > 2n+3 for n ≥5.

Let P(n) be the statement 2n > n3.

(ii) The statement P(n + 1) is 2n+1 > (n + 1)3. Assume for n ∈N and
n ≥10 that (1) 2n > n3 is true. For n ≥10, we have 9 > n, which
implies 9n2 < n3, which implies n3 + 9n2 < 2n3. So for n ≥10, it
follows that
(n + 1)3 = n3 + 3n2 + 3n + 1 < n3 + 3n2 + 3n + 3
< n3 + 3n2 + 3n + 3n = n3 + 3n2 + 6n
< n3 + 3n2 + 6n2 = n3 + 9n2
< 2n3 < 2 · 2n = 2n+1.
Hence, the statement P(n + 1) is true and by mathematical induction,
2n > n3 for n ≥10.

3. a. Proof: Since D = gcd(a, b), by Theorem 6.1 there exist integers x
and y such that (1) D = ax + by. Substituting for a and b in (1), we
obtain D = drx + dsy = d(rx + sy). Hence, d divides D.
b. Proof: Since d = gcd(a, b), by Theorem 6.1 there exist integers
x and y such that (1) d = ax + by. Substitution for a and b yields
da′x + db′y = d.
Cancelling, we ﬁnd a′x + b′y = 1 and therefore
gcd(a′, b′) = 1.
c. Proof: Let D = gcd(na, nb) and let d = gcd(a, b). By the deﬁnition of
the greatest common divisor, d divides a and d divides b. That is, there
exist integers a′ and b′ such that a = da′ and b = db′. It follows from
part b that gcd(a′, b′) = 1. Substituting, we have D = gcd(nda′, ndb′).
By part a the natural number n divides D and d divides D. Since a′
and b′ are relatively prime, they have no common factor other than 1.
Hence, D = nd. That is, gcd(na, nb) = n gcd(a, b).

Proof: For all n ∈N, let P(n) be the statement 9 divides 4n + 6n −1.
(i) For n = 1, 41 + 6 · 1 −1 = 9, which is divisible by 9. So, P(1) is true.
(ii) Let n ∈N and assume that P(n) is true. That is, assume that 9
divides 4n + 6n −1. Hence, there exists an integer m such that 4n +
6n −1 = 9m. Solving for 4n, we ﬁnd 4n = 9m −6n + 1. The statement
P(n + 1) is 9 divides 4n+1 + 6(n + 1) −1. Calculating, we ﬁnd
4n+1 + 6(n + 1) −1 = 4 · 4n + 6n + 6 −1 = 4(9m −6n + 1) + 6n + 5
= 36m −24n + 4 + 6n + 5 = 36m −18n + 9
= 9(4m −2n + 1).
Since m and n are integers, 4m −2n + 1 is an integer and 9 divides
P(n + 1). It follows by mathematical induction that P(n) is true for all
n ∈N.

that for n = 2, the statement P(2) is |x1 + x2| ≤|x1| + |x2|, which is
the triangle inequality.)
(ii) Let n ∈N and assume that P(n) is true. That is, assume that
|x1 + x2 + · · · + xn| ≤|x1| + |x2| + · · · + |xn|
is true. The statement P(n + 1) is
|x1 + x2 + · · · + xn + xn+1| ≤|x1| + |x2| + · · · + |xn| + |xn+1|.
Grouping the ﬁrst n terms in the absolute value on the left-hand side of
the inequality above and using the triangle inequality, we ﬁnd
|x1 + x2 + · · · + xn + xn+1| ≤|(x1 + x2 + · · ·xn) + xn+1|
≤|x1 + x2 + · · · + xn| + |xn+1|
≤|x1| + |x2| + · · · + |xn| + |xn+1|.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
By mathematical induction the statement P(n) is true for all natural
numbers n.
11. Proof: (i) For n = 2, we calculate x2 = √5 + 1. Obviously, 4 < 6 < 9.
Taking square roots of this inequality, we obtain 2 < x2 =
√
6 < 3.
(ii) Let n be any natural number greater than 2 and assume 2 < xn < 3.
Adding 5 to this inequality yields 7 < 5 + xn < 8.
Taking square
roots, we obtain 2 <
√
7 < √5 + xn <
√
8 < 3. Since xn+1 is deﬁned
recursively by xn+1 = √5 + xn, we have 2 < xn+1 < 3.
Thus, by
induction, 2 < xn < 3 for all natural numbers n ≥2.
13. Proof: Suppose there is an m ∈N such that 8 does not divide 52m −1.
By the Well-Ordering Principle there is a smallest natural number s
such that 8 does not divide 52s −1. Since 8 divides 52 −1 = 24 and 8
divides 54−1 = 624, s > 2. Let k = s−1. Then 8 divides 52k−1. Thus,
there is a natural ℓsuch that 52k −1 = 8ℓ. Therefore, 52k = 8ℓ+ 1.
Calculating, we ﬁnd
52s−1 = 52(k+1)−1 = 52·52k−1 = 25(8ℓ+1)−1 = 200ℓ−24 = 8(25ℓ−3).
Since 25ℓ−3 is an integer, 8 divides 52s −1, which is a contradiction.

a. Proof: For all n ∈N, let P(n) be the statement Fn < 2n.
(i) Since F1 = 1 < 2 = 21 and F2 = 1 < 4 = 22, the statement P(n) is
true for n = 1 and n = 2.
(ii) Assume for some natural number n ≥2 that Fk < 2k for k =
1, 2, . . ., n. Because Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1, Fn < 2n, and Fn−1 < 2n−1, we
have Fn+1 < 2n + 2n−1 < 2n + 2n = 2 · 2n = 2n+1.
Therefore, by induction Fn < 2n for all n ∈N.
b. Proof: For all n ∈N, let P(n) be the statement F3n is even and
both F3n+1 and F3n+2 are odd.
(i) For n = 1, F3 = 2, which is even, F4 = 3, which is odd, and F5 = 5,
which is odd. So, the statement P(1) is true.
(ii) Suppose for some n ≥1, the statement P(n) is true. The statement
P(n + 1) is F3(n+1) = F3n+3 is even and both F3(n+1)+1 = F3n+4 and
F3(n+1)+2 = F3n+5 are odd. By the recursive deﬁnition of the Fibonacci
numbers:
(1) Because both F3n+2 and F3n+1 are odd by the induction hypothesis,
F3n+3 = F3n+2 + F3n+1 is even.
(2) Because F3n+3 is even by (1) and because F3n+2 is odd by the
induction hypothesis, F3n+4 = F3n+3 + F3n+2 is odd.
(3) Because F3n+4 is odd by (2) and because F3n+3 is even by (1),
F3n+5 = F3n+4 + F3n+3 is odd.
Hence, by induction, the statement P(n) is true for all n ∈N.

(i) The statement P(1) is F7 = 4F4+F1. Since F7 = 13, F4 = 3, F1 = 1,
and 13 = 4(3) + 1, the statement P(1) is true. The statement P(2) is
F8 = 4F5 + F2. Since F8 = 21, F5 = 5, F2 = 1, and 21 = 4(5) + 1, the
statement P(2) is true.
(ii) Suppose for some natural number n ≥2 the statements P(k) are true
for all k = 1, 2, . . ., n. By the recursive deﬁnition for F(n+1)+6 = Fn+7,
by substitution from the true statements P(n) and P(n−1), and by the
recursive formulas for Fn+4 and Fn+1, we have
Fn+7 = Fn+6 + Fn+5 = 4Fn+3 + Fn + 4Fn+2 + Fn−1
= 4(Fn+3 + Fn+2) + (Fn + Fn−1)
= 4Fn+4 + Fn+1.

and 12 = 1 · 1, the statement P(1) is true.
(ii) Assume for some natural number n that the statement P(n) is true—
that is, assume that the statement (1) is true. Grouping the ﬁrst n terms

(a, b) ∈A × B deﬁne f : A × B →B × A by f((a, b)) = (b, a). Suppose
(a, b), (c, d) ∈A × B and that f((a, b)) = f((c, d)). By deﬁnition of f,
(b, a) = (d, c), which implies b = d and a = c. Therefore, (a, b) = (c, d)
and f is one-to-one. Suppose (b, a) ∈B × A. Then b ∈B, a ∈A, and
(a, b) ∈A × B. By deﬁnition, f((a, b)) = (b, a). Hence, f is onto and a
one-to-one correspondence from A × B onto B × A.
13.
a. Proof: We deﬁne the function f : Nm × Nn →Nmn by
f((i, j)) = n(i −1) + j.
First, we prove f is one-to-one by contradiction. Therefore, we assume
there exist (i, j), (k, ℓ) ∈Nm × Nn such that (i, j) ̸= (k, ℓ) and
(1)
n(i −1) + j = n(k −1) + ℓ.
Since (i, j) ̸= (k, ℓ), either i ̸= k or j ̸= ℓ. We consider these two cases
separately.
Case 1 Suppose i ̸= k.
Without loss of generality, we may assume
i < k. Subtracting the quantity ℓ+ n(i −1) from (1), we obtain
(2)
j −ℓ= n(k −1) −n(i −1) = n(k −i) ≥n(1) = n
because i and k are both integers and i < k. Equation (2) says the
diﬀerence between j and ℓis greater than n. However j, ℓ∈Nn and
consequently their maximum diﬀerence is n −1. Thus, we have a con-
tradiction, and therefore, i = k.
Case 2 Suppose j ̸= ℓ. It follows from (1) that n(i −1) ̸= n(k −1),
which implies i ̸= k. This again leads to the contradiction of case 1.
From case 1 and case 2, we see that the function f is one-to-one.
Next, we show that f is onto. Let k ∈Nmn. By the Division Algorithm
for Integers, there exist unique integers q and r such that (3) k −1 =
nq + r where 0 ≤r < n. Choose (4) i = q + 1 and (5) j = r + 1. Then
i ∈Nm and j ∈Nn. From (4), (5), and (3),
f((i, j)) = n(i −1) + j = nq + r + 1 = k −1 + 1 = k.
That is, f is onto.
Therefore, f is a one-to-one correspondence from Nm × Nn onto Nmn.
Hence, Nm × Nn ∼Nmn. Consequently, |Nm × Nn| = |Nmn| = mn
and the set Nm × Nn is ﬁnite.
b. Proof: If A = ∅or B = ∅, then A × B = ∅and A × B is a ﬁnite
set.
Suppose for some m, n ∈N that A ∼Nm and B ∼Nn.
By
Theorem 7.2, A × B ∼Nm × Nn. By part a, we have Nm × Nn ∼Nmn
and by transitivity of ∼, we have A × B ∼Nmn.

Exercises 7.2
1.
Proof: We prove that f is a one-to-one function by cases. Suppose n1
and n2 are integers and for deﬁniteness that n1 ≤n2.
Case 1 If n1 ≤n2 ≤0 and f(n1) = f(n2), then 1 −2n1 = 1 −2n2,
which implies n1 = n2.
Case 2 If n1 ≤0 < n2 and f(n1) = f(n2), then 1 −2n1 = 2n2, which
implies n1 + n2 = 1/2. This is a contradiction, because the sum of two
integers is an integer.
Case 3 If 0 < n1 ≤n2 and f(n1) = f(n2), then 2n1 = 2n2, which
implies n1 = n2.
Consequently, the function f is one-to-one.
Suppose m ∈N. If m is even, then m = 2n for some n ∈N ⊂Z. If
m is odd, then m −1 is even and m −1 = 2k for some k ∈N ∪{0}.
Therefore, m = 1−2(−k) where −k is a negative integer or zero. Hence,
f is onto, and therefore f is a one-to-one correspondence from Z onto
N.
3.
Proof: Let P(n) be the statement “If A is a denumerable set and if B
is a ﬁnite set with |B| = n, then A ∪B is a denumerable set.”
(i) For n = 1, the statement P(n) is “If A is a denumerable set and if
B = {x}, then A ∪B is a denumerable set.” By Theorem 7.14, this
statement is true.
(ii) Suppose for some natural number n the statement P(n) is true. Let
A be a denumerable set and let B be a ﬁnite set with |B| = n+1. Since B
has n+1 elements, B is nonempty and there exists some x ∈B. The set
A∪B = [A∪(B−{x})]∪{x}. By Theorem 7.10, the set B−{x} is ﬁnite
and |B −{x}| = |B|−1 = n+1−1 = n. Hence, the set A∪(B −{x}) is
the union of the denumerable set A and the ﬁnite set B−{x}, which has
n elements. By the induction hypothesis, A ∪(B −{x}) is denumerable
and by Theorem 7.14, the set A∪(B −{x})]∪{x} is a denumerable set.
That is, the statement P(n + 1) is true and by induction the statement
P(n) is true for all natural numbers.
5.
a. Proof: The set F + is denumerable, because the function f : N →F +
deﬁned by f(n) = 4n is a one-to-one correspondence. You should verify
this fact.
b. Proof: Let F −= {. . ., −12, −8, −4}. The function g : N →F −
deﬁned by g(n) = −4n is a one-to-one correspondence.
By Theo-
rem 7.16, the set F + ∪F −is denumerable, since F + and F −are
denumerable and F + ∩F −= ∅.
Hence, by Theorem 7.14, the set
F = (F + ∪F −) ∪{0} is denumerable.

Proof: Suppose to the contrary that the set A −B is not denumerable.
Thus, A −B is a ﬁnite set and by problem 8 of Exercises 7.1, since B
is a ﬁnite set, the set (A −B) ∪B = A is a ﬁnite set. This contradicts
the hypothesis that A is denumerable.
9.
Proof: Let P(n) be the statement “If A1, A2, . . ., An are denumerable
sets, then Sn
i=1 Ai is a denumerable set.”
(i) For n = 1, the statement P(n) is “If A is a denumerable set, then
S1
i=1 Ai = A1 is a denumerable set.” Obviously, this statement is true.
(ii) Suppose for some natural number n the statement P(n) is true. Let
A1, A2, . . ., An+1 be denumerable sets. The set

Ai = (

By the induction hypothesis, the set Sn
i=1 Ai is a denumerable set and by

P(n + 1) is true.
Hence, by induction the statement P(n) is true for all natural numbers.

Proof: We prove this theorem by contradiction. Let A be an uncount-
able set and let A ⊆B. Assume that the set B is a countable set. Since
B is countable, either (1) B is ﬁnite or (2) B is denumerable.
Case 1 By Theorem 7.8, since A ⊆B and B is a ﬁnite set, the set A
is a ﬁnite set, which contradicts the hypothesis that A is uncountable.
Case 2 Since A is an uncountable set, the set A is an inﬁnite set. By
Theorem 7.19, since A is an inﬁnite subset of the denumerable set B,
the set A is denumerable, which contradicts the hypothesis that A is
uncountable.

a. Proof: By deﬁnition, |A| = |B| implies A ∼B and |B| = |C| implies
B ∼C. By transitivity, A ∼C, which implies |A| = |C|.
b. Proof: Since the identity function IA : A →A is one-to-one, we
have |A| ≤|A|.
c. Proof: Because |A| ≤|B|, there exists a function f : A 1-1
−→B and
because |B| ≤|C|, there exists a function g : B 1-1
−→C. The composition
g ◦f : A →C is one-to-one; therefore, |A| ≤|C|.
d. Proof: Let A ⊆B. The function f : A →B deﬁned by f(a) = a
is one-to-one. Hence, |A| ≤|B|.
e. Proof: Since A ∩B ⊆B, we have |A ∩B| ≤|B| by Exercise 5d.
f. Proof: Since B ̸= ∅, there exists some b ∈B.
Let the function
f : A →A × B be deﬁned by f(a) = (a, b). This function is one-to-one.
Therefore, |A| ≤|A × B|.
g. Proof: By Exercise 5d, since A ⊆B, we have |A| ≤|B|. Also since
B ⊆C, we have |B| ≤|C| = |A| by hypothesis. Consequently, by the
Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem |A| = |B|.
7.
a. Proof: By hypothesis |A| ≤|B| and |B| ≤|C|. So by Exercise 5c,
we have |A| ≤|C|.
Also by hypothesis |C| ≤|A|.
Hence, by the
Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem, |A| = |C| and A ∼C. By hypothesis
|B| ≤|C| and |C| ≤|A|. So by Exercise 5c, we have |B| ≤|A|. Also, by
hypothesis, |A| ≤|B| and by the Schr¨oder–Bernstein Theorem, |A| =
|B| and A ∼B. Hence, A ∼B ∼C.
b. The function f : R →R × R deﬁned by f(x) = (x, 0) is one-to-
one. Hence, |R| ≤|R × R|. The set R and the interval (0, 1) both
have cardinality c. To prove that |R × R| ≤|R|, we prove that there
exists a one-to-one function from (0, 1) × (0, 1) into (0, 1).
For each
x ∈(0, 1), let x be written in normalized decimal form. The function
g : (0, 1) × (0, 1) →(0, 1) deﬁned by
g((x, y)) = g((0.x1x2x3 . . ., 0.y1y2y3 . . .)) = 0.x1y1x2y2x3y3 . . .
is one-to-one. Hence, |R × R| ≤|R| and by the Schr¨oder–Bernstein
Theorem |R × R| ≤|R| and R × R ∼R.

Proof: Our proof is by contradiction. Suppose that an < bn for all
n ∈N, an →A, bn →B, and A > B. Let ϵ = (A −B)/2 > 0. Since
an →A, there exists a natural number N1 such that |an−A| < (A−B)/2

there exists a natural number N such that if n > N; then |an −0| < ϵ.

then ||an| −0| < ϵ. Therefore, limn→∞|an| →0.
Now, suppose that |an| →0 and let ϵ > 0 be given. Since |an| →0,
there exists a natural number N such that if n > N, then ||an| −0| < ϵ.

Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
7.
Proof: We prove by induction that an < 5/3 for all n ∈N. Let P(n) be
the statement “an < 5/3.” The statement P(1) is 1 < 5/3, which is true.
Now, assume that P(n) is true for some natural number n. That is, we
assume that an < 5/3 for some n ∈N. From the recursive deﬁnition,
we have an+1 = (an + 5)/4 < (5/3 + 5)/4 = 5/3. Hence, the statement
P(n + 1) is true and an < 5/3 for all n ∈N. That is, the sequence
< an > is bounded above by 5/3.
Next, we prove by induction that the sequence < an > is monotone
increasing. Let Q(n) be the statement “an ≤an+1.” The statement
Q(1) is 1 ≤3/2, which is true.
Now, we assume that Q(n) is true
for some natural number n. That is, we assume that an ≤an+1 for
some n ∈N. Adding 5 to the last inequality and then dividing by 4,
we obtain (an + 5)/4 ≤(an+1 + 5)/4. From the recursive deﬁnition, it
follows that an+1 ≤an+2. Therefore, the statement Q(n+1) is true, and
by mathematical induction the sequence < an > is monotone increasing.
Hence, the sequence is bounded below by a1 = 1.
By Theorem 8.9 (the monotone convergence theorem), the sequence
< an > converges to some real number A.
Taking the limit of the
recursive deﬁnition of an+1 as n approaches inﬁnity, we ﬁnd A = (A +
5)/4. Solving for A, we obtain A = 5/3.
9. Proof: We prove by induction that an > 1/2 for all n ∈N.
Let
P(n) be the statement “an > 1/2.” The statement P(1) is 2 > 1/2,
which is true. Assume that the statement P(n) is true for some natural
number n. That is, assume that an > 1/2 for some n ∈N. Therefore,
1 > 1/(2an) and −1/(2an) > −1. From the recursive deﬁnition, we see
that an+1 = 2−1/(2an) > 2−1 = 1 > 1/2. Hence, the sequence < an >
is bounded below by 1/2.
Now, we prove by induction that the sequence < an > is monotone
decreasing. Let Q(n) be the statement “an+1 ≤an.” The statement
Q(1) is a2 ≤a1, which is true, since a1 = 2 and a2 = 2 −1/4 = 7/4.
Assume for some natural number n that an+1 ≤an.
Then 1/an ≤
1/an+1. Because an+1 > 1/2 > 0, we have −1/(2an+1) ≤−1/(2an),
which implies 2 −1/(2an+1) ≤2 −1/(2an). Thus, from the recursive
deﬁnition an+2 ≤an+1 and the statement Q(n+1) is true. By induction,
the sequence < an > is monotone decreasing and bounded above by
a1 = 2.
By Theorem 8.9, the sequence < an > converges to some real number A.
Taking the limit of the recursive deﬁnition for an+1 as n tends to inﬁnity,
we ﬁnd A satisﬁes the equation A = 2 −1/(2A) or 2A2 −4A + 1 = 0.
Hence, A = 1 ±
√
2/2. Since 1/2 < an < 2 for all n ∈N, we conclude
A = 1 +
√
2/2.
11. Proof: First, we prove that an > 3 for all n ∈N. Let P(n) be the
statement “an > 3.” The statement P(1) is true, because a1 = 4 > 3.

Suppose for some natural number n that an > 3. Adding 6 to this
inequality, we obtain 6 + an > 9, which implies an+1 = √6 + an > 3.
Thus, the statement P(n + 1) is true. Hence, by induction, an > 3 for
all n ∈N and the sequence < an > is bounded below by 3.
Next, we prove that an > an+1 for all n ∈N. Since an > 3, we have
an−3 > 0 and an+2 > 0. Therefore, 0 < (an−3)(an +2) = a2
n−an−6.
Solving for a2
n, we ﬁnd a2
n > 6+an, which implies an > √6 + an = an+1
by the recursive deﬁnition. Therefore, the sequence < an > is monotone
decreasing and bounded above by a1 = 4.
By Theorem 8.9, the sequence < an > converges to a real number
A. From the recursive deﬁnition, we see that A satisﬁes the equation
A = √6 + A. Squaring this equation, we ﬁnd A2 = 6 + A.
Hence,
A2 −A −6 = (A −3)(A + 2) = 0 and A = 3 or A = −2.
Since
3 < an < 4 for all n ∈N, we conclude an →3.

Proof: Let P(n) be the statement “an < an+1 < bn+1 < bn.”
(i) The statement P(1) is a1 < a2 < b2 < a1. Since a1 < b1 and a1 > 0,
we have a2
1 < a1b1 and therefore, from the recursive deﬁnition,
(1) a1 < √a1b1 = a2.
Because a1 < b1, we have
0 < (a1 −b1)2 = a2
1 −2a1b1 + b2
1.
Adding 4a1b1, we obtain
4a1b1 < a2
1 + 2a1b1 + b2
1 = (a1 + b1)2.
Taking the square root of both sides of this inequality and then dividing
by 2, we ﬁnd √a1b1 < (a1 + b1)/2. That is,
(2) a2 < b2.
Since a1 < b1, we have a1 + b1 < 2b1, which implies
(3) b2 = (a1 + b1)/2 < b1.
It follows from inequalities (1), (2), and (3) that a1 < a2 < b2 < b1.
Therefore, the statement P(1) is true.
(ii) Assume that the statement an < an+1 < bn+1 < bn is true for
some natural number n. Since an+1 < bn+1 and an+1 > 0 (because
0 < a1 < an+1), we have a2
n+1 < an+1bn+1 and therefore, from the
recursive deﬁnition,
(4) an+1 <
p
an+1bn+1 = an+2.
Because an+1 < bn+1, we have
0 < (an+1 −bn+1)2 = a2
n+1 −2an+1bn+1 + b2
n+1.
Adding 4an+1bn+1, we obtain
4an+1bn+1 < a2
n+1 + 2an+1bn+1 + b2
n+1 = (an+1 + bn+1)2.

Taking the square root of both sides of this inequality and then dividing
by 2, we ﬁnd
p
an+1bn+1 < (an+1 + bn+1)/2. That is,
(5) an+2 < bn+2.
Since an+1 < bn+1, we have an+1 + bn+1 < 2bn+1, which implies
(6) bn+2 = (an+1 + bn+1)/2 < bn+1.
It follows from (4), (5), and (6) that an+1 < an+2 < bn+2 < bn+1.
Therefore, the statement P(n + 1) is true and, by induction, the state-
ment P(n) is true for all n ∈N.
Consequently, the sequences < an > and < bn > are both bounded be-
low by a1 and bounded above by b1. The sequence < an > is monotone
increasing and the sequence < bn > is monotone decreasing. By Theo-
rem 8.9, we have an →A and bn →B. Taking the limit of the recursive
equation bn+1 = (an + bn)/2 as n approaches inﬁnity, we obtain the
equation 2B = A + B, which implies A = B.

11. Proof: Let e be the identity of the group G and let a−1 be the inverse
of a. Consider y = ba−1 ∈G. By associativity, we have ya = (ba−1)a =
b(aa−1) = be = b. Hence, y is one solution of ya = b. Suppose that y1
and y2 ̸= y1 are both solutions of the equation ya = b. Then y1a = y2a
and by the right cancellation law y1 = y2, which contradicts y2 ̸= y1.
Therefore, y = ba−1 is the unique solution of ya = b.
13. Proof: First, we assume that G is an abelian group. Let a, b ∈G.
By Theorem 9.4, we have (1) (ab)−1 = b−1a−1. Since G is abelian,
(2) b−1a−1 = a−1b−1. From (1) and (2), we see that (ab)−1 = a−1b−1.
Next, suppose that (ab)−1 = a−1b−1 for all a, b ∈G.
Let e be the
identity element of G. Since a, b ∈G, the elements a−1, b−1, a−1b−1,
(ab)−1 are elements of G. By deﬁnition of inverse (1) (ab)(ab)−1 = e.
By hypothesis (2) (ab)−1 = a−1b−1. Substituting (2) into (1), we obtain
(3) (ab)a−1b−1 = e. Multiplying (3) on the right by b yields aba−1b−1b =
eb or (4) aba−1 = b. Then, multiplying (4) on the right by a, we obtain
ab = ba. Therefore, G is abelian.

Proof: Let G be a group with identity e and let H and K be subgroups
of G. By Theorem 9.6, e ∈H and e ∈K. Therefore, e ∈H ∩K and
H ∩K is a nonempty set. Suppose that a, b ∈H ∩K. Then a, b ∈H
and a, b ∈K. Since H and K are subgroups of G, the element b−1 ∈H
and b−1 ∈K by Theorem 9.6. Since H and K are groups, ab−1 ∈H
and ab−1 ∈K. Thus, ab−1 ∈H ∩K and, by Theorem 9.7, the set H ∩K
is a subgroup of G.

Proof: By deﬁnition, H is a subgroup of the group (K, ◦) if and only if
H is a subset of K and (H, ◦) is a group. Likewise, K is a subgroup of
the group (G, ◦) if and only if K is a subset of G and (K, ◦) is a group.
Since H ⊆K and K ⊆G implies H ⊆G and since (H, ◦) is a group,
(H, ◦) is subgroup of (G, ◦) by deﬁnition.

g−1(ga) = (g−1g)a = ea = a = g−1ag.
Multiplying a = g−1ag on the right by g−1, we ﬁnd
ag−1 = (g−1ag)g−1 = (g−1a)(gg−1) = (g−1a)e = g−1a.
Therefore g−1 ∈C(a). Now, suppose that g, h ∈C(a). Then ga = ag
and ha = ah. Computing, we ﬁnd
(gh)a = g(ha) = g(ah) = (ga)h = (ag)h = a(gh).
Hence, gh ∈C(a) and, by Theorem 9.8, the set C(a) is a subgroup of
G.
13.
Proof: Let G be a group with identity e and let a be a ﬁxed element of
G. Let H be a subgroup of G and let K = {a−1ha | h ∈H}. Since H is
a subgroup of G, the identity e is an element of H and a−1ea = e ∈K.
That is, K is a nonempty set. Suppose that b, c ∈K. Then there is
an h1 ∈H such that b = a−1h1a and there is an h2 ∈H such that
c = a−1h2a. Computing, we ﬁnd
bc−1 = (a−1h1a)(a−1h2a)−1 = (a−1h1a)(a−1h−1
2 a)
= a−1h1(aa−1)h−1
2 a = a−1(h1h−1
2 )a.
Since h1, h2 ∈H and since H is a group, h1h−1

bc−1 ∈H. Hence, by Theorem 9.7, the set K is a subgroup of G.
