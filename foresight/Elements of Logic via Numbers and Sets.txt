Introduction 
This book is based on a module given to first-year undergraduates at the Uni-
versity of Nottingham with the aim of bridging the gap between school and 
university in mathematics. This is not so much a gap in the substance or ma-
terial content of the subject but more a change in attitude and approach. In 
pure mathematics for example, rather than memorize a formula and be able to 
apply it, we want to understand that formula and be able to prove it. Physical 
intuition does not constitute a proof and neither does accumulated statistical 
evidence; what is required is a formal logical process. Since logic can sometimes 
appear rather a dry subject, we take as an underlying theme the concept of 
"number" , which not only provides a rich source of illustrations but also helps 
to lay the foundations for many areas of more advanced mathematical study. 
We begin in Chapter 1 with a survey of useful facts about numbers that 
are more or less familiar, such as the binomial theorem and Euclid's algorithm, 
respectively, giving formal proofs of different kinds, notably proof by induction. 
It will become increasingly evident that to gain a better understanding of what 
happens in the course of a proof we need a systematic language or framework 
within which to develop the ideas involved. Fortunately, one exists, and forms 
the subject of the next chapter. 
The first half of Chapter 2 looks at propositional calculus, which treats 
propositions (statements that are either true of false) and the relations between 
them (such as implication) as mathematical objects. Ways of combining these 
and of operating on them, familiar from our knowledge of language, are put 
into formal shape governed by precise rules. The second half of Chapter 2 
studies syllogisms, which are logical arguments, or processes of deduction, of 
the simplest kind. They thus form an ideal model or pattern for all forms of 
logical inference, and also serve to introduce the deceptively simple but crucially 
important idea of quantification.

I ntrod uction 
The core of the book is Chapter 3, where the development of set theory 
closely parallels that of logic in the previous chapter. It also lays the foundations 
for important results in the later chapters and introduces the terminology and 
notation that comprise the language of modern mathematics. 
Two important types of relation are studied in Chapter 4: the notion of 
ordering forms a familiar and fundamental element of structure in most number 
systems, and the seemingly artificial concept of equivalence relation. The latter 
finds application in many areas of advanced mathematics, especially in the 
construction of number systems and in abstract algebra, where the key result 
Theorem 4.1 plays a decisive role. 
The elementary concept of function is generalized to the more abstract idea 
of map in Chapter 5, where many more or less familiar examples are given. A 
study of the basic properties of maps leads, among other things, to our second 
key result of ubiquitous application, Theorem 5.6. 
The revolutionary ideas of Cantor described in Chapter 6 bring us very 
nearly into the present century. In addition to proving our third key result, 
Theorem 6.6, we make good the claim that the concept of set is more funda-
mental than that of number, and the axiomatic development of number systems 
reaches its crowning glory in the construction of the real numbers. The diligent 
reader will be rewarded with at least a glimpse of the meaning of the infinite. 
It is a pleasure to acknowledge my gratitude to Springer-Verlag, and espe-
cially to Susan Hezlet, for their courteous and efficient handling of all matters 
connected with the production of the book.

Numbers 
"1 + 1 = 2." 
A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell, 
Principia Mathematica, Vol. II, p. 83. 
Historically, mathematics came into being to serve two purposes, counting and 
measuring. Both of these required the use of numbers, the positive integers N 
and the real numbers JR, respectively. The need to solve equations such as 
2x = 3, 
x + 4 = 0, 
subsequently led to the appearance of more sophisticated number systems like 
the rational numbers Q, the integers Z, and the complex numbers <C. We are 
chiefly concerned here with properties of the positive integers and, at the same 
time, the means by which such properties are established. This revolves around 
the concept of a mathematical proof, of which we give examples of four kinds, 
finishing up with the most important for N, proof by induction. 
1.1 Arithmetic Progressions 
Definition 1.1 
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers 
whose consecutive terms differ by a constant called the common difference 
d = al - ao = a2 - al = ... = ak - ak-l = .... 
(1.1 ) 
D. L. Johnson, Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Thus, if the first term ao = a say, then 
al = a + d, 
a2 = a + 2d; 
ak = a + kd 
(1.2) 
in general. We seek a formula for the sum of the first n terms of this sequence, 
(1.3) 
which is usually arrived at in the following way. Compare (1.3) with the same 
sum "written backwards", 
Sn = an-l + an-2 + ... + ao 
(1.4) 
and observe that the n pairs of terms aligned vertically all have the same sum, 
ak-l + an-k = a + (k - l)d + a + (n - k)d = 2a + (n - l)d, 
(1.5) 
k = 1, ... , n, so that n times this number is equal to twice the desired sum, 
that is, 
2sn = n(2a + (n - l)d). 
(1.6) 
Theorem 1.1 
The sum Sn of the first n terms of the arithmetic progression with first term a 
and common difference d is given by the formula 
Sn = na + ~n(n - l)d. 
(1.7) 
o 
While this process of derivation has a number of points in its favour, namely, 
it 
(a) contains the key idea-reversing the sum, 
(b) is fairly convincing-you believe the result, 
( c) leads to the right answer-formula (1. 7) is correct, 
there are nevertheless some shortcomings, such as: 
(i) the dotsÂ·Â·Â· in (1.1), (1.3), (1.4) are not defined precisely, 
(ii) the formula ak = a + kd in (1.2) has not been proved, although it is almost 
"obvious" , 
(iii) tacit assumptions are made in the manipulations leading successively 
to (1.5), (1.6), (1.7). 

1. Numbers 
3 
We attempt to remedy each of these failings in turn. 
First of all, the dots ... in (1.1) will be eliminated if we replace all these 
equations by the single assertion 
for every positive integer k, ak - ak-l = d. 
Next, the dotsÂ· .. in (1.3) and (1.4) can be eliminated by passing to so-called 
E-notation, pronounced "sigma-notation", when they become 
(1.8) 
In each of these equations, the right-hand side is evaluated by substituting the 
indicated values of k in the given expression and adding the resulting numbers. 
The fact that these two apparently different expressions for Sn are formally 
equal is a consequence of various rules of manipulation in E-notation like those 
in the exercises below. These rules are in turn the consequences of fundamental 
laws of arithmetic referred to after the next paragraph. 
Turning to (ii), the general formula in (1.2) can be proved either by induc-
tion or by using the E-rules just mentioned. Since the latter are also proved by 
induction, the remedy for this failing must be deferred until Section 1.4. 
Finally, the tacit assumptions referred to in (iii) are all of the type intro-
duced as axioms (see below) in elementary algebra and more properly called 
fundamental laws of arithmetic. Perhaps the most prominent of these are 
the commutative laws: 
a + b = b + a and ab = ba, 
(1.9) 
of addition and multiplication, respectively. The term "law" means that these 
equations hold for all a, b, e in N. They generalize to sums and products of any 
number n of terms, and thus prove that the right-hand sides of (1.3) and (1.4) 
are equal. 
Next, rather more subtly, notice that the right-hand side of (1.3) contains 
not only n terms but also n - 1 operations (of addition), and, just as the former 
can be written in any order, the latter can be performed in any order. This is 
a consequence of the associative laws: 
(a + b) + e = a + (b + e) 
and (ab)c = a(be), 
(1.10) 
for all a, b, c in N, of addition and multiplication, respectively. 
Finally, in (1.5) and (1.7), we have made use of the distributive laws: 
a(b+e)=ab+ae, 
(a + b)e = ac + be, 
(1.11) 

4 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
valid for all a, b, c in No These two laws relate addition to multiplication and, 
like the commutative and associative laws, are commonly assumed and used 
without explicit reference. Note that when multiplication is commutative, each 
of the two distributive laws is a consequence of the other. 
We have now assembled most of the axioms for a particularly important 
type of number system. To get the others, observe that the integers Z have an 
additive identity 0 and a multiplicative identity 1: 
a + 0 = a, 
a1 = a, 
(1.12) 
for all integers a, and that every integer a has an additive inverse -a: 
a + (-a) = O. 
(1.13) 
A system closed under addition and multiplication for which (1.9)-(1.13) hold 
is called a commutative ring-with-identity. Removing the second equations 
in (1.9) and (1.12), we simply get a ring. Adjoining to (1.9)-(1.13) the extra 
axiom that there are no divisors of zero: 
if a =1= 0 and b =1= 0, 
then 
ab =1= 0, 
(1.14) 
gives an integral domain. The existence of multiplicative inverses: 
if 
a =1= 0, 
there is an a-l with aa- l = 1, 
(1.15) 
gives a field. 
Thus, the integers Z form an integral domain but not a field. The rational 
numbers Q, the real numbers ~, and the complex numbers C are all fields.

1.11 Use these results to put together a more formal proof of for-
mula (1.7). 
1.12 The number of ways of ordering the n terms in the sum 
is, almost by definition, equal to n!, pronounced "n factorial". On 
the other hand, curiously, the number Cn of ways of ordering the 
n - 1 operations in Sn, that is, the number of different bracketings, 
is not equal to (n - I)! for n ::::: 4. Calculate the value of Cn for some 
small values of n, and see what you can deduce about these numbers 
(called the Catalan numbers). 
1.13 Prove that every field is an integral domain. 
1.14 Prove that every finite integral domain is a field. 
1.2 Proof by Contradiction 
Suppose you wish to prove that a certain (mathematical) statement P is true. 
One way of doing this is to prove that P is not false, and this may be done as 
follows. Let", P stand for the statement "P is false"; '" P is called the negation 
of P and pronounced "not P". Suppose you can deduce from rvP that a certain 
statement Q is both true and false; such a situation flies in the face of reason 
and a fundamental law of logic, and is called a contradiction. You can then 
conclude that your assumption ",P is wrong, that is, ",P is false, which is the 
same as saying that P is true. This method of proof is called "reductio an 
absurdum" in Euclidean geometry. It is more commonly known as proof by 
contradiction, and we shall give a more formal justification for its validity in 
Chapter 2. The example of this type of proof given below concerns numbers 
and requires a familiar definition. 
Definition 1.2 
A real number r is called rational if some non-zero integral multiple of r is 
an integer: br = a for some integers a and b with b i= 0, and then we write 

6 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
r = alb, pronounced "a over b". The expression alb is called a fraction with 
numerator a and denominator b. 
Examples of fractions are 
1/2, 
0/5, 
-2/3, 
6/1, 
3/6, 
2/ - 3. 
(1.16) 
These fractions all represent rational numbers, and the main reason why the 
treatment of fractions in elementary school is so difficult is that this represen-
tation is not unique, that is, different fractions can represent the same rational 
number. This is inherent in the definition, for the equation br = a can be mul-
tiplied by any non-zero integer m to give the equivalent equation mbr = ma, 
so that the fractions ma/mb all represent the same rational number r. The way 
round this is to choose the "simplest" one, namely the one where 
the denominator is the smallest positive integer multiple 
of r to be an integer. 
(1.17) 
In this case a and b can have no common factor (other than Â±1) and alb is 
said to be in lowest terms. 
The Ancient Greeks believed at first that all real numbers are rational. 
Imagine their horror when, as a consequence of Pythagoras' celebrated theorem, 
an irrational number appeared on the scene: the hypotenuse h of a right triangle 
with shorter sides both of length 1 satisfies the equation h2 = 2; write h = y'2, 
pronounced "root-two". 
Theorem 1.2 (Euclid) 
The number h = y'2 is irrational. 
Proof 
Assume (for a contradiction) that the statement of Theorem 1.2 is false, that 
is, that h is rational. Then we can write h = alb in lowest terms, where a and b 
are integers. Then 
h2 = a2/b2 = 2, 
whence a2 = 2b2 . So a2 is even and thus so is a : a = 2c, say. But then 
4c2 = a2 = 2b2 , 
whence b2 = 2c2 . So b2 is even and thus so is b : b = 2d, say. But then 
h = alb = 2c/2d = c/d, 

1. Numbers 
7 
which contradicts the fact that alb is in lowest terms. We conclude that our 
original assumption, that h is rational, is false. Therefore, h = V2 is irrational, 
u~~.

In this proof, we used the statements 
P 
v'2 is irrational, 
"" P 
v'2 is rational, 
Q 
alb is in lowest terms, 
""Q 
alb is not in lowest terms. 
We already know that Q is true, by (1.17). We then deduced ""Q from ""P. 
The contradiction Q and rvQ enables us to conclude P. 
EXERCISES 
1.15 Write the fractions given in (1.16) in lowest terms. 
1.16 Convince yourself that the representation of a rational number sat-
isfying (1.17) is unique. 
1.17 Let n be an integer. Prove that the remainder on division of n 2 by 4 
is 0 or 1 according as n is even or odd. What remainders are possible 
when n 2 is divided by 8? 
1.18 Let c be a real number satisfying c3 = 5; write c = ..yg, the "cube-
root of five" . Prove that c is irrational. 
1.19 Convince yourself that statements P and rv ""P are the same. Sup-
pose that P is a statement from which you can deduce ""P. Which, 
if any, of the following conclusions can you draw: 
(a) P is true, 
(b) P is false, 
(c) rvp is true, 
(d) ",P is false. 
1.20 Give a proof by contradiction of the statement: 
P: the sum of the squares of three consecutive integers cannot leave 
remainder -Ion division by 12. 
1.21 Prove by contradiction that the cube of the largest of three consecu-
tive integers cannot be equal to the sum of the cubes of the other two. 
1.22 Prove that the polynomial f(x) = x4 + 2x2 + 2x + 1998 cannot be 
written as the product of two quadratic polynomials with integer 
coefficients. 

8 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
1.23 Prove that if m and n are odd integers, then the equation x 2 + 2mx + 
2n = 0 has no rational root by deducing that 
(a) such a root must be an integer, and 
(b) that integer can be neither odd nor even. 
1.24 Prove that at a party of at least two people, there are at least two 
who have the same number of friends at the party. 
1.3 Proof by Contraposition 
This method may be applied when you wish to prove a compound statement 
of the form "if P, then Q", where P and Q are themselves statements about 
the same thing or things. Such a statement is called an implication, with 
premise P and conclusion Q, and it can be put in many different ways: 
â¢ Q holds whenever P holds, 
â¢ given P, Q is true, 
â¢ Q is a consequence of P, 
â¢ P is a sufficient condition for Q, 
â¢ Q is a necessary condition for P, 
â¢ P implies Q, written P =} Q. 
We prefer the last of these and will study it in more detail in the next chapter. 
For the moment, note first that the roles of P and Q in such a statement 
are completely different. To prove that P =} Q, we would normally start off by 
assuming that P is true, go through a process of logical deduction, and finish 
up with the conclusion that Q is true. Now it may be that, having assumed P, 
the best way to establish Q is by getting a particular contradiction, namely, by 
assuming "-'Q and deducing ,,-,p' The contradiction "P and ,,-,P" then allows 
us to conclude that our assumption "-'Q was false, that is, Q is true. 
So this proof boils down to showing that "-'Q =} ,,-,Pi this statement is called 
the contrapositive of P =} Q. In the next chapter, we shall give a formal proof 
that the statements P =} Q and "-'Q =} ",P are logically equivalent. On the 
other hand, the implication Q =} P is called the converse of P =} Q and is 
NOT logically equivalent to it. We sometimes write P {= Q instead of Q =} P, 
and P <=} Q pronounced "P if and only if Q" instead of "P =} Q and P {= Q". 
This prompts a word of warning. When proving an implication P =? Q, 
you can NEVER assume that Q is true. It is, after all, what you are trying to 

1. Numbers 
9 
prove: if you want to climb a mountain, you don't start at the top. It would 
save time of course but wouldn't really achieve anything much. 
To set up a good example of proof by contraposition, we shall need some 
useful notation and a familiar definition. Let a and b be integers and consider 
the condition "b is a multiple of a": b = ma for some integer m. In elementary 
number theory, it is both convenient and customary to change the emphasis 
and state this in the form "a divides b", written a I b. Thus, 1 has only one 
positive divisor (itself), and every n > 1 has at least two (n and 1). Note that 
a I b is not a number (like the fraction a/b), but a statement about a pair of 
numbers. Thus, 2 I 4, 2 I 2, 2 I 0 are true, and 2 11, 2 I 5, 0 I 2 are false. 
Definition 1.3 
A positive integer is called prime if it has exactly two divisors. 
These are, of course, nand 1 (note that 1 is not prime). It is clear that if n 
is prime, then n is not divisible by any integer a in the range 2 :::; a :::; Vii. 
We shall prove by contraposition that this necessary condition for primeness is 
also sufficient. 
Theorem 1.3 
If n 2': 2 is a positive integer divisible by no integer d in the range 2 :::; d :::; Vii, 
then n is prime. 
Proof 
We have two statements about positive integers n 2': 2: 
P 
n is divisible by no integer d in the range 2 :::; d :::; Vii, 
Q 
n is prime. 
Proceeding by contraposition, we assume "'Q, that is, n has a divisor a with 
1 1= a 1= n. Write n = ab with n 1= b 1= 1 and consider two cases: 
(i) 
a :::; b : then a2 :::; ab = n and a :::; Vii, 
(ii) 
a> b : then b2 < ab = nand b :::; Vii. 
Taking d = a in case (i) and d = b in case (ii), we have a divisor d of n in the 
range 2:::; d :::; Vii. This is the negation of P, and we have proved "'Q =} ",P. 
Hence, P =} Q by contraposition.

1.4 Proof by Induction 
The methods of proof described in the previous two sections are in common 
use throughout mathematics. In contrast, the method presented in this section 
is special: it applies only to statements about positive integers, more precisely, 
statements of the form "P( n) is true for all positive integers n" , where P(n) is 
a statement involving n. The fact that the method "works" is a consequence 
of a fundamental property of N that is best treated as an axiom, although we 
shall give a "proof" later. 

1. Numbers 
Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) 
Let pen) be a statement about positive integers n. Suppose that 
(a) P(I) is true, and 
(b) pen - 1) =} pen) for all n > 1. 
Then pen) is true for all n. 
Here, n is called the inductive variable, 
P(I) 
pen - 1) 
pen - 1) =} pen) 
the inductive base, 
the inductive hypothesis IH, and 
the inductive step. 
In many books, the inductive step (b) is written 
pen) =} pen + 1) 
for all n ~ 1, 
11 
(1.18) 
which is the same as (b): merely replace n in (b) by n + 1 throughout (cf. 
changing the variable of summation in Exercise 1.5). You are free to use either 
form, whichever best suits the context. 
Our first example comprises something we already know, the important 
special case a = d = 1 of Theorem 1.1. It is interesting to compare the proofs 
in Section 1.1, Exercise 1.11, and the following. 
Theorem 1.4 
For every positive integer n, 
pen) : 
n 
1 
L k = '2n(n+l). 
k=l 
Proof 
We need to (a) establish the base, (b) carry out the inductive step. 
(a) P(I) is true by inspection: both sides are equal to 1 when n = 1. 
(b) Now suppose that n > 1 and assume pen - 1): 
IH 
n-l 
1 
L k = '2(n-l)n. 
k=l

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Then

I>+n, 
k=l 
1 2"(n-l)n+n, 
1 2"(n-l+2)n,

2"n(n + 1). 
by Exercise 1. 7, 
byIH, 
by the distributive laws, 
We have thus deduced pen) from pen - 1). By the PMI, pen) is true for all 
positive integers n. 
o 
In the next example, it is not easy to see how to proceed without the PMI. 
Theorem 1.5 
For every positive integer n, 
pen) : 
Proof 
n 
1 
L k2 = "6n (n+1)(2n+1). 
k=l 
(a) is true by inspection: both sides are equal to 1 when n = 1. 
For (b), suppose that n > 1 and assume pen -- 1): 
IH 
Then 
k=l

L k2 = 6(n-l)n(2n-1).

1 
"6n(2n2 + 3n + 1) 
1 
"6n(n + 1)(2n + 1). 
By the PMI, this completes the proof.

1. Numbers 
13 
The inductive method admits a number of useful variants, all based on the 
PM!. Here are four of them. 
Variant 1: Changing the Base 
It may be that we wish to prove a statement P(n) for all values of n :::: no, 
where no is an integer other than 1. In this case, it is sufficient to prove 
(a) P(no), 
and 
(b) P(n - 1) =} P(n) for all n > no. 
This is no more than the PMI applied to the new statement Q(n) = P(n + 
no - 1), since 
(a) Q(l) = P(no), 
(b) n > no {o} n - no + 1 > 1. 
Theorem 1.6 
Proof 
Let P(n) be the statement 2n > n2. P(5) : 32 > 25. 
Now let n > 5 and assume P(n - 1). 
IH 
Then 
2n 
2.2n-l 
> 2(n-1)2 
2n2 - 4n + 2 
n 2 + n(n - 4) + 2 
> n2 as n > 5. 
0 
Variant 2: Cumulative Induction 
In carrying out the inductive step, it is sometimes convenient (even necessary) 
to assume all the statements P( k) for 1 :::::: k :::::: n - 1 in order to conclude P( n). 
This is allowed. Given that 

14 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
(a) P(l) is true, and 
(b) P(l) and P(2) and ... and P(n - 1) together =} P(n) for all n > 1, 
you can conclude that P(n) is true for all n 2: 1. To see this, merely apply the 
PMI to the new statement Q(n) = P(l) and P(2) and ... and P(n). 
Theorem 1.7 
Every integer n 2: 2 is a product of primes. 
Proof 
The inductive base P(2) is clear: 2 is a prime. Now let n > 2 and assume P(k) 
for all k in the range 2 :::: k :::: n - 1. 
We need to distinguish two (mutually exclusive and exhaustive) cases: n is 
prime, n is not prime. In the first case there is nothing to prove, so assume 
that n is not prime. Then n = lm with 1 < l, m < n. By P(l), l is a product of 
primes, and by P(m), so is m. Thus, so also is their product lm = n. 
0 
P.S. You may be worried about the use of the expression "product of primes" 
being allowed to include the case of a single prime. This is a convention: 
a product tlt2 ... tn of n terms is just tl when n = 1. It is also convenient 
to attach a meaning when n = 0: the empty product is taken to be 1. 
Using the notation 
n 
tlt2 ... tn = II tk = 71'n, 
k=l 
we take 71'0 = 1, just as in the case of sums, 
we take (Jo = O. 
n 
tl + t2 + ... + tn = L tk = (In, 
k=l 
Variant 3: Double Induction 
Suppose you want to prove a statement of the form P( m, n) for all positive 
integers m and n. Induction on n would involve: 
(a) establishing the inductive base: P(m,l) for all values of m, and 
(b) carrying out the inductive step: for all n > 1, 
P(m, n - 1) ==} P(m, n) for all values of m. 

1. Numbers 
15 
Now either or both of these statements are candidates for proof by induction 
on m. Then again, the roles of m and n in the aforesaid can be reversed. There 
are thus a number of subvariants of proof by double induction, depending on 
the omerin which the pairs (m, n) are taken (this idea will be developed further 
in Section 4.4). We consider three of these now, spelling out in each case the 
strategy for proving P( m, n) for all positive integers m, n. 
Strategy 1 
(a) Prove P(l, 1), 
(b) assume P(m, 1) 
(c) deduce P(m + 1, 1), 
(d) assume P(m, n) for all values of m, 
(e) deduce P( m, n + 1) for all values of m. 
A little thought shows that this is really two separate single inductions: (a) 
plus (b) and (c) establish (by induction on m) the base for an induction on n 
(with (b) and (c) forming the inductive step). For an example ofthis subvariant, 
see Exercise 1.43. 
Strategy 2 
(a) Prove P(l, n), for all values of n, 
(b) prove P( m, 1) for all values of m, 
(c) for m, n > 1, assume P(m - 1, n) and P(m, n - 1), 
(d) deduce P(m, n). 
Here, (a) and/or (b) can be proved by (single) induction, and (c) and (d) may 
be thought of as a single induction on m + n. This method is illustrated in 
Exercises 1.47-1.49 below. 
Strategy 3 
(a) Prove P(m, 1), for all values of m, 
(b) for n > 1, assume P(m, n - 1), 

16 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
(c) prove P(I, n), 
(d) for m > 1, assume P(m -1,n), 
(e) prove P{m,n). 
This method differs only slightly from Strategy 2, but highlights the fact that 
the inductive step (in the induction on n) is being carried out by induction 
(on m). An example ofthis kind, but with m starting at 0, follows at once. 
Theorem 1.8 
For every positive integer n, the product of any n consecutive integers is divis-
ible by n!. 
Proof 
Let us write 
n 
7r(m, n) = II (m + k), n:::: 1, m :::: 0 
k=l 
for the product of the n consecutive integers starting from m + 1. 
Notice that if n :::: 2, the first n - 1 terms comprise 7r{m, n - 1), so that we 
have 
7r(m, n) = (m + n) 7r(m, n - 1). 
(1.19) 
If also m :::: 1, the last n - 1 terms of 7r(m - 1, n), also comprise 7r(m, n - 1), 
so that 
7r(m - 1, n) = m7r(m, n - 1). 
(1.20) 
Subtracting (1.20) from (1.19), we get the formula 
7r(m,n) -7r(m -1,n) = n7r(m,n -1), 
m:::: 1, n:::: 2, 
(1.21) 
which will come in handy later. We are now ready to embark on the proof. 
We want to prove the statement 
P(m,n) : 
n! I 7r(m, n) for all n :::: 1, m :::: O. 
(1.22) 
We induct first on n :::: 1. The inductive base, 
1 
P(m,l) : I! I II (m + k) for all m :::: 0, 
k=l 
merely asserts that 1 is a divisor of m + 1. 

1. Numbers 
17 
Now let n > 1 and assume the inductive hypothesis 
(n - I)! 17r(m, n - 1) for all m ~ o. 
(1.23) 
We have to prove that 
n! 17r(m,n) for all m ~ 0, 
(1.24) 
and to do this, we now induct on m ~ 0, keeping n ~ 1 fixed. The inductive 
base at m = 0 is again trivial: n! I n!, as 7r(0, n) = n! 
Now let m > 0 and assume the (second) inductive hypothesis 
n! 17r(m - 1, n). 
(1.25) 
Our goal is to prove 
n! 17r(m,n) 
(1.26) 
assuming two inductive hypotheses (1.23) and (1.25). The first of these implies 
that n! divides the right-hand side of (1.21), and so also the left-hand side: 
n! I (7r(m,n) -7r(m -1,n)). 
Since n! divides the second term by (1.25), it also divides the first, and we have 
proved (1.26). This completes the induction on m, and we have proved (1.24). 
This in turn completes the induction on n, as we have proved (1.22), as required. 
o 
Variant 4: Simultaneous Induction 
This final variant applies when pen) is a compound statement of the form Q(n) 
and R(n), that is, when we are trying to prove two statements simultaneously. 
The inductive base simply requires two proofs, of P(l) and of Q(l). For the 
inductive step, 
pen - 1) and Q(n - 1) ~ pen) and Q(n) for all n > 1, 
a number of approaches are possible, depending on the relation between pen) 
and Q(n). For example, it is enough to prove 
P(n - 1) ~ Q(n) and Q(n - 1) ~ pen), 
both for all n > 1, 
or, as in our star example in the next section, 
pen - 1) and Q(n - 1) 
~ pen), 
and 
Q(n - 1) and pen) 
~ Q(n), 
both for all n > 1. 

18 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Extreme examples of the use of induction are provided by recent important 
research by the Russian group theorists S. 1. Adian and A. Yu. Ol'shanskii 
and their colleagues on the long-standing Burnside problem. In one case, the 
inductive base is 667 and there are as many as 92 inductive variables. This is 
"improved" in the other to around eight inductive variables, but at the expense 
of up to six simultaneous inductions in many places and an inductive base of 
around 1010.

Observe that for each m = 1,2,3, 
sm(x) = m ! Sm-l(X) dx + cx, 
where c is chosen to make sm(l) = 1. Apply this formula with m = 4 
to get S4(X), and prove by induction on n that 2:~=1 k4 = s4(n). 
1.36 What is wrong with the following "proof" that all horses are the 
same colour? Let P(n) be the statement: in any group of n horses, 
all are the same colour. This is clearly true when n = 1 as any horse 
is the same colour as itself. Next, take any group of n horses and 
exclude one. The remaining n-l are the same colour by the IH. Now 
exclude a different horse, so that the remaining n - 1 (including the 
one originally excluded) are the same colour, by the IH again. So 
all n are the same colour.

1.5 Inductive Definition 
Suppose you wish to define a quantity q(n) that depends on the positive in-
teger n: such an object is called, in the terms of Chapter 5, a map with 
domain N, or a sequence. Suppose further that 
(a) q(l) is known, and 
(b) q(n) can be expressed in terms of q(n - 1) for all n > 1. 
Then a simple induction on n proves the statement P(n) : q(n) is defined for 
every positive integer n. 
For example, the rules, 
(a) q(l) = 1, 
(b) q(n) = n. q(n - 1) for n ~ 2 
provide the definition of n!. 
As with inductive proofs, the base need not always be 1. For example, the 
formulae for so(x) and sm(x) in Exercise 1.35 above comprise an inductive 
definition of the polynomial sm(x) for all integers m ~ O. A simpler and more 
basic example of this kind is as follows. 

20 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Definition 1.4 
The powers of a variable x are defined by 
(a) 
xO = 1, 
It is an inevitable fact that statements about inductively-defined quanti-
ties are proved by induction. The so-called rules of indices furnish a simple 
illustration. 
Theorem 1.9 
For all integers m, n ::=: 0, 
Proof 
(i) Induct on n: both sides are equal to xm when n = O. Let n ::=: 1 and assume 
the IH: 
Then 
xm . xn= xm . x n- 1 . X 
= xn +n - 1 â¢ X 
= xm+n - 1+1 
=xm+n 
by definition 
by the IH 
by definition 
for all m::=: O. 
(ii) Induct on n: both sides are equal to 1 when n = O. Let n ::=: 1 and assume 
the IH: 
Then 
(xm)n= (xm)n-lxm 
= xm(n-l)xm 
= xm(n-l)+m 
by definition 
by the IH 
by part (i) 
for all m. 
o 
As with inductive proofs, more than one inductive variable may be involved 
in an inductive definition. In this case, a number of strategies are available, 
perhaps the cleanest being Strategy 2 on page 15. Thus, to define a quantity 
q(m,n) for all m,n::=: 0, it is sufficient to 

l. Numbers 
(a) specify q(m,O) for all m 2: Â° 
and q(O,n) for all n 2: 0, and 
(b) express q(m, n) in terms of q(m - 1, n) and q(m, n - 1) for all m, n 2: 1. 
The following example is very natural, important and (I hope) familiar. 
Definition 1.5 
Let us define 
(a) b(m, 0) = 1 for all m 2: Â° and b(O,n) = 1 for all n 2: 0, and 
(b) b( m, n) = b( m - 1, n) + b( m, n - 1) for all m, n 2: 1. 
21 
Then the b(m, n) are called binomial coefficients; it is customary to write 
b( m, n) = (m~n), pronounced "m + n choose m" . 
A little thought will convince you that this is nothing but a formal definition 
of Pascal's triangle. 
The following properties of the binomial coefficients are all easy exercises. 
For all m,n ~ 0, 
(i) cn~n) = (m:n) , 
(ii) (m+n) _ (m+n)! 
\ m 
-
mIn! ' 
(iii) (m~n) is the number of ways of choosing m things from m + n. 
Property (i) expresses the symmetry of b(m, n), (ii) provides a closed formula, 
and (iii) indicates an alternative approach in terms of combinations. Arguably 
the most important manifestation of these numbers is in the famous theorem 
from which they get their name. 
Theorem 1.10 (The Binomial Theorem) 
For all n 2: 0, 
(1.27) 
Proof 
The proof is (necessarily) by induction on n. To get the base, let n = 0. Then 
the left-hand side is equal to 1 (Definition 1.4(a)), and so is the right-hand side: 

22 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
by Definitions 1.5(a) and 1.4(a). 
For the inductive step, let n ~ 1 and assume the IH: 
Then 
(1 + x)n-l(l + x) by Definition 1.4(b) 
(~ (n ~ 1) xk) (1 + x) by the IH 
~ (n ~ l)xk + ~ (n ~ l)xk+1 
k=O 
k=O 
~ (n ~ 1) xk + t (~ = 
~) xk 
k=O 
k=l 
(n -1) 0 ~ ((n -1) (n -1)) k (n -1) n 
o 
x +L..,.. 
k 
+ k-1 
x + n-1 x. 
k=l 
In the second-last step, we replaced k by k -1 throughout the second sum, and 
in the last step we isolated the first term of the first sum and the last term of 
the second sum, then combined what was left into a single sum. 
Comparing this expression with the right-hand side of (1.27) we have to 
prove that 
(i) (n~l)xO = (~)xO, 
(ii) (nkl) + (~=i) = (~) for 1 ~ k ~ n - 1, and 
(iii) (~=Dxn = (~)xn. 
Well, both sides of (i) are equal to 1 by Definitions 1.5(a) and 1.4(a), and (iii) 
also follows from Definition 1.5(a): e~) = 1 for all m ~ O. To see (ii), write the 
formula in Definition 1.5(b) in the form 
Replacing m by k and n by n - k does the trick. 
o 
Finally, and again in analogy with inductive proofs, inductive definitions 
can be cumulative, that is to say, having got the base, q(l) say, q( n) for n > 1 
can be defined in terms of any or all of the previous values q( k), 1 ~ k ~ n - 1. 
We round off this section by giving two classical examples.

23 
Definition 1.6 
Define a sequence of numbers by setting 
Uo = 0, 
U1 = 1, 
Un = Un -2 + Un -1 for n ;:::: 2. 
The Un, n ;:::: 0, are called the Fibonacci numbers. Note that two equations 
are required for the base because of the form of the inductive part of this 
definition. 
As their name suggests, the Fibonacci numbers were first studied by 
Leonardo of Pisa at the time of the Renaissance. Since that time, these numbers 
have been a constant source of recreational mathematics, as well as providing 
insight into natural phenomena such as phyllotaxis. At the present time, the Fi-
bonacci Society produces its journal, the Fibonacci Quarterly, once every three 
months. The Un have an almost limitless number of interesting properties, of 
which we shall prove just one. 
Theorem 1.11 
The Fibonacci numbers Un have the property 
Un -1 Un+! = u; + (_l)n for all n;:::: 1. 
Proof 
When n = 1, 
lhs = Uo U2 = 0(0 + 1) = 0 = 12 + (_1)1 = rhs 
and we have the inductive base. Let n ;:::: 2 and assume the IH

lowing. 
Definition 1. 7 
Define a sequence of numbers by setting

CI = 1, 
Cn = L Ck Cn-k for n :::: 2.

The Cn, n :::: 1, are called the Catalan numbers. As mentioned in Exer-
cise 1.12, Cn is just the number of ways of bracketing a sum or product of n

a proof of the otherwise non-obvious fact that (n + 1) I e:) for all n:::: 0 (cf.

The first equation is obvious, and provides the base for an induction on n :::: 1. 
The case n = 1 is also obvious: d2 = 2. The next case is more typical, and we 
spell it out now. 
The new term X3 can be introduced inside each of the products Xl X2, X2 Xl 
in four different ways. In Xl x2 for example, it can precede or follow xl, or 
precede or follow X2, resulting in (X3 XI)X2, (Xl X3)X2, XI(X3 X2), XI(X2 X3) re-
spectively. Further, it can occur outside Xl X2 in two ways: X3(XI X2), (Xl X2)X3, 
giving six new products altogether from Xl x2' From x2 Xl we get another 6, so 
that d3 = 12, as required. 
The general case is similar. In any particular bracketed product of Xl, X2, 
... ,Xn there are n -
1 multiplications. Inside each of these we can intro-
duce X n +! in four ways as above to give 4( n - 1) new products, and there

are two ways of putting it outside. Thus, for each of the dn products of n 
terms, we get 4n - 2 with n + 1 terms. This establishes (1.29). 
Next, to forge a link with the Cn, observe that for each bracketing, the terms 
can be written in any of n! orders: dn = n! Cn, n:::: 1. Hence, by (1.29), 
dn +! 
(4n-2)dn 
(4n-2)n!cn 
(4n-2) 
Cn+! = (n + 1)! = 
(n + 1)! = 
(n + 1)! 
= n + 1 
CnÂ· 
(1.30) 
This provides the key to the inductive step in proving (1.28), to which we now 
finally turn. 
To get the base, observe that both sides of (1.28) are equal to 1 when n = o. 
So assume the equation in (1.28) as it stands and compute as follows: 
4n+2 
Cn +2 
n + 2 Cn+ll 
by (1.30), 
4n + 2 . _1_ (2n)

2n + 1 . _2_ . n + 1 (2n) 
n+2 n+1 n+1 n

which completes the inductive step.

1.6 The Well-ordering Principle 
In this section we attempt to justify the PMI by appealing to an assertion that 
may be intuitively more reasonable. Recall your acceptance, at the age of six, 
and again about 21 pages ago Â«1.17) in Section 1.2), of the idea of a fraction 
in lowest terms. This is an application of the following fact. 
Well-ordering principle (WOP). If A is a property of the positive integers 
possessed by at least one of them, then there is a least positive integer, I 
say, with A, that is: 
(i) 
I has A, 
and (ii) 
no k with 1 ~ k < l has A. 
Given a rational number r, let A stand for the property of "being a possible 
denominator of r", that is, a positive integer b has property A if br is an integer. 
By definition of rational number, there is at least one such b. The WOP then 
guarantees that there is a least such, and this is the denominator of r in lowest 
terms. 
Theorem 1.13 
The PMI is a consequence of the WOP. 
Proof 
We shall prove the contrapositive of the implication WOP =} PM!. So assume 
the PMI to be invalid. This means that there is a statement P(n) about positive 
integers n such that 
(a) P(l) is true, 
(b) P(n - 1) =} P(n) for all n > 1, but 
(c) for some positive integer m, P(m) is false. 
Let A be the property that P( n) is false, so that m has property A because 
of (c). By the WOP, there is a least l with A, so that P(l) is false. So l =J. 1 
because of (a), whence l ~ 2 and I-I is a positive integer. By the minimality 
of I, P(l - 1) is true, and because of (b), P(l) is true. Contradiction. 
0 
It turns out (Exercise 1.56 below) that the converse of this theorem is also 
true. Thus the PMI and WOP are logically equivalent, and in some areas of 
application the WOP is easier to use. Some examples follow, of which the first 

28 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
is the very reasonable assertion that, in the normal process of division, the 
remainder is less than what you divide by. 
Theorem 1.14 (Euclid) 
Given positive integers a and b, we can find integers q and r such that 
a = bq + rand 0:::; r < b. 
(1.31) 
Proof 
If b I a, then we can take q = alb and r = o. If b t a, let A be the property: 
being of the form a - bn with n an integer. By taking n = 0, we see that a has 
property A, and by the WOP there is a least positive integer l with A. Put 
l = a - bm with m an integer. We prove by contradiction that l < b. If this is 
false, we can write l = b+x with x ~ o. Then x = l-b = a-bm-b = a-b(m+l). 
Since b t a, x =1= 0 and the last equation then asserts that x has property A. By 
the minimality of l, x ~ I = b + x > x, a contradiction. Thus, I = a - bm and 
I < b. Taking q to be m and r to be I, we get (1.31).

This theorem forms the basic method for calculating the following important 
quantity associated with two positive integers. 
Definition 1.8 
The highest common factor of two positive integers a and b is the largest 
positive integer h such that h I a and h I b; we often write h = (a, b). a and b 
are called relatively prime (or coprime) if (a, b) = 1. 
Some discussion is in order here. Note first that (a, b) always exists, since 
the number of common divisors of a and b is non-zero and finite: 1 divides a 
and b, and if c divides a and b, then 1 :::; c :::; min(a, b). Next, the definition 
applies equally well if a or b (or both) is negative. One of them can even be 
zero: since every integer divides zero, (a, 0) = lal. The highest common factor 
is thus defined for any integers a, b except the pair 0,0. 
The key to the problem of calculating (a, b) for a given a and b is provided 
by (1.31). Since (a, b) = (b, a), we can assume that a ~ b. If c divides both b 
and r, then clearly cia. On the other hand, as r = a - bq, if d divides both a 
and b, then d I r. The common divisors of a and b are thus the same as the 
common divisors of band r: 
c I a and c I b {:? c I band c I r. 

1. Numbers 
29 
It follows that (a, b) = (b, r). The point is that r < b, and the problem has been 
reduced. 
If r = 0, we are finished, for 
(a,b) = (b,r) = (b,O) = b. 
If not, repeat the process with b, r in place of a, b respectively to get 
and (b, r) = (r, rl). If rl = 0, then (a, b) = r and we are finished. If not, repeat 
with (r,rl) in place of (b,r) to get a remainder r2 < r!, and so on. Proceeding 
in this way we get a strictly decreasing sequence b, r, rl, r2, ... of non-negative 
integers which, after a finite number of steps (at most b), must reach zero: 
r n = 0 say. Then, from what has been said, (a, b) = r n-l. This process for 
calculating (a, b) is called Euclid's algorithm. 
An important but rather unexpected property of the hcf is described in the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 1.15 
Given positive integers a and b with (a, b) = h, we can find integers sand t 
such that 
h = sa + tb. 
(1.32) 
Proof 
Note first that in general, one of s, t will be positive and the other negative. 
Let A be the property of positive integers that they can be written in the form 
of the right-hand side of (1.32): a positive integer c has A if c = ma + nb for 
some integers m and n. Since at least one positive integer, a + b for example, 
has A, there is a least such, call it l : l = ma + nb. We make the claim that l I a 
and prove it by contradiction. 
Assume that l fa. Then by Theorem 1.14 we can write 
a = ql + r, 
0< r < l. 
Then 
r = a - ql = a - q(ma + nb) = (1 - qm)a + (-qn)b, 
so that r has A. The fact that 0 < r < l contradicts the minimality of l, and 
our claim that l I a is established. The fact that lib is proved in the same way. 
We have shown that l is a common factor of a and b, whence l :S h. But h 
divides the right-hand side of the equation l = ma + nb. Thus h I l, so that 
h :S l. Therefore h = l = ma + nb, and we can take s = m, t = n to get (1.32).

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
This proof illustrates a weakness in the WOP: it is not constructive. We 
have shown that 8 and t satisfying (1.32) exist, but no indication is given of 
how to calculate them. Fortunately, Euclid's algorithm comes to the rescue: 
8 and t can be found by substituting back through the equations that led to 
Tn-l = (a, b). 
Example 1.1 
Calculate the hcf h of the numbers 89 and 55, and find integers 8 and t such 
that 
h = 898 + 55t. 
The first steps in the algorithm are as follows: 
89 
55.1 + 34, 
55 
34.1 + 21, 
34 
21.1 + 13, 
21 
13.1 + 8, 
13 
8.1 + 5, 
8 
5.1 + 3, 
5 
3.1 + 2, 
3 
2.1 + 1, 
2 
1.2 + 0, 
and so h = 1. Working backwards, 
1=3-2 
3 - (5 - 3) = 2 . 3 - 5 
2(8 - 5) - 5 = 2 . 8 - 3 . 5 
2 . 8 - 3(13 - 8) = 5 . 8 - 3 . 13 
5(21 - 13) - 3 . 13 = 5 .21 - 8 . 13 
5.21 - 8(34 - 21) = 13.21 - 8.34 
13(55 - 34) - 8 . 34 = 13.55 - 21 . 34 
13.55 - 21(89 - 55) = 34.55 - 21 . 89, 
so that 8 = -21 and t = 34. 
So the Fibonacci numbers turn up as the canonical worst case of Euclid's 
algorithm. This is atypical: the algorithm is in general very efficient. 
As a consequence of Theorem 1.15 we shall now obtain an important prop-
erty of prime numbers, which is a necessary preliminary for the last theorem 
in this chapter.

Theorem 1.16 
If n is a prime dividing a product ab of positive integers, then n I a or nib. 
Proof 
The proof is by contradiction. So assume that n is a prime with n I ab, but 
that n divides nether a nor b. Since n is prime, (n, a) can only be nor 1. Our 
hypotheses rule out the first possibility, and so n and a are coprime: (n, a) = 1. 
Similarly (n, b) = 1. By Theorem 1.15, we can find integers s, t, u, v such that 
1 = sn + ta, 
1 = un + vb. 
Then 
1 = (sn + ta)(un + vb) = sun2 + (uta + vbs)n + tv abo 
Since n lab, n divides the right-hand side, whence also n 11. Contradiction.

We are now in the happy position of being able to supply a proof of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. 
Theorem 1.17 
Every positive integer n can be expressed as a product of primes. Writing 
(1.33) 
with Pl,P2,'" ,PI all primes subject to the conditions 
(i) 
PI <P2 < ... <PI, 
(1.34) 
this expression is unique. 
Proof 
First the existence of such a decomposition is just the assertion of Theorem 1. 7 
(in the trivial case n = 1, the product is empty). 
To prove the uniqueness (and this is typical of such proofs) assume that 
(1.35) 
is another such decomposition, that is, ql, q2, ... ,qm are all prime and 
(ii) 
(1.36) 

32 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Then we have to prove that the decompositions (1.33) and (1.35) are identical, 
that is, 
for all k, 
1:::; k :::; l. 
(1.37) 
Proceed by (cumulative) induction on n. When n = 1, both products must 
be empty, so that l = m = 0 and (1.37) holds. Now let n ~ 2 and assume 
uniqueness for all k with 1 :::; k < n as the IH. 
Let P be the smallest prime dividing n. Then an easy induction (Exer-
cise 1.63 below) based on Theorem 1.16 shows that P divides one of the Pk, 
1 :::; k :::; I, and condition (i) of (1.34) forces P = Pl. Similarly, P = ql, so 
PI = qlÂ· 
It follows that 
(1.38) 
Since nip < n, we can apply the IH, provided that the analogues of condi-
tions (1.34) and (1.36) hold for (1.38), that is, with rl, 81 replaced by rl - 1, 
81 - 1 respectively. 
This is so when rl, 81 are both at least 2 (the case P I nip), and we can 
deduce (1.37) from the fact that the products in (1.38) are identical, as rl -1 = 
81 - 1 '* rl = 81' In the other case, P f nip, we have rl = 81 = 1, and the 
analogous conditions are those obtained from (1.34) and (1.36) by removing 
the terms PI, rl, ql, 81. The fact that the products in (1.38) are identical again 
guarantees (1.37), as 1- 1 = m - 1 '* I = m. Thus, (1.37) holds in both cases 
and the induction is complete.

Logic 
"If you want to play the game, you'd better know the rules." 
c. Eastwood, 
The Dead Pool 
The word logic derives from the Greek AOfO(J': reasoning, and is defined in the 
OED as the: 
(a) branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning and thinking, especially 
inference and scientific method; 
(b) systematic use of symbolic techniques and mathematical methods to de-
termine the forms of valid deductive argument. 
These definitions nicely illustrate the two-way traffic between logic and mathe-
matics. Thus, according to (a), logic underpins mathematics, which is the main 
reason why this book was written. On the other hand, (b) declares that math-
ematical ideas, notation and methods can be used to describe and develop the 
study of logic, and this forms the content of this chapter. The terms "chain of 
reasoning", "inference", and "valid deductive argument" are all more or less 
synonymous with proof. 
2.1 Propositions 
The fundamental objects of study in logic are propositions. What is a propo-
sition? First and foremost it is a sentence: logic is bound up with language. 
But 
What's the time? 
Do not lean out of the window!

This is close, but the statements

The function f (x) = cos x is commutative. 
There are two top-class football teams in Nottingham: Notts County 
and Notts County Reserves. 
are unacceptable for various reasons. The point is that we want our propositions 
to have a definite truth-value: a proposition is a statement that is either true 
or false, but not both. 
The (mathematical) statements, denoted by P, Q, IH, etc., in the previous 
chapter are all of this type. The letters P, Q, IH are being used to represent 
propositions in much the same way as letters x, a, b are used to represent 
numbers in ordinary algebra. In both cases, symbols (upper or lower case let-
ters) are taken to stand for actual objects (propositions or numbers). Again in 
both cases, formulae can be put together using these symbols and evaluated by 
substituting for the symbols objects that they represent. For this reason, the 
subject we are about to describe and develop is more precisely called symbolic 
logic or formal logic. This study is commonly referred to as propositional cal-
culus. I'm not too keen on this term: "algebra of propositions" would be more 
accurate. The word "formal" here emphasizes the fact that we are concentrating 
on the form of symbolic expressions rather than their content. In other words, 
we are concerned with syntax (grammar) rather than semantics (meaning). 
In ordinary algebra, symbols can be combined to form more complicated 
expressions using certain well-defined operations. Thus, when a, b, c represent 
numbers, we can attach a meaning to the expression a(b + c), where the opera-
tions involved are arithmetical: addition (+) and multiplication (the invisible. 
between a and (b+c)). In just the same way, the symbols in logic that stand for 
propositions can be combined to form more complicated expressions using logi-
cal operations. Thus, when P, Q represent propositions, we can attach a mean-
ing to the expression rvP =? Q, where the operations involved are negation (rv) 
and implication (=? ). In such expressions, P and Q are sometimes called logical 
variables, and the symbols rv and =? logical constants. Being mathematicians, 
however, we prefer the terms proposition and (logical) operation, respectively. 
Another two important logical operations are the connectives of 
conjuction: P 1\ Q, "P and Q", 
disjunction: P V Q, "P or Q". 
They are defined by their truth-values as follows. P I\Q is true when both P, 
Q are true and is false otherwise. P V Q is true when at least one of P, Q is true 
and is false otherwise. Thus, V stands for the "inclusive or": either or both. 

2. Logic 
37 
Our fifth and final operation is the analogue of equality in algebra, logical 
equivalence: P == Q, which is true when P and Q have the same truth-value 
and false otherwise. 
Of the five operation just described, all but rv are binary operations, that 
is, they combine two propositions to form a third. In contrast, rv is sometimes 
referred to as a unary operation: it is applied to a single proposition. 
To conclude this section, we should say a word about the rather special 
operation =? While P 1\ Q and P V Q are propositions of much the same kind 
as P and Q, the expression P =? Q carries intuitive overtones of something 
more: that "Q can be deduced from P" . Thus, if P and Q are propositions about 
numbers, so are P 1\ Q and P V Q; but whatever the nature of P and Q, P =? Q 
is always a proposition about propositions. In the terminology of Chapter 4, =? 
is actually a relation between propositions. 
There is also some ambiguity here, and there are several different kinds 
of implication (for example, syntactic implication and semantic implication in 
Model Theory), and real logicians use different symbols for them. We cheerfully 
ignore all this and write P =? Q in all cases. For our crude purposes, however, 
it is sufficient to distinguish two kinds, and these differ only in context or 
emphasis. In the general context of a theorem of the form "if H, then C", 
the emphasis is on deducing the conclusion C from the hypothesis H, that 
is, on the proof. In the algebra of propositions dealt with in this chapter, the 
proposition P =? Q is thought of as being defined by its truth-values (see the 
discussion in the proof of Theorem 1.3 above, Exercise 2.6 below, and the next 
secti~n).

sition P and think of suitable names for them. How many binary

For how many values of m is P(m,n) true when n = 16? For which

proposition into English:

integers. What do you make of the following proposition?

2.2 Truth Tables 
Both the definitions of logical operations and the proofs of laws that hold for 
them can be performed in a very satisfactory way using truth tables. This 
method of handling propositions enjoys (at least) three important advantages: 
- it is absolutely rigorous and logically correct; 
- it presents all the information in a simple visual manner; and 
- it can be adapted to the study of sets, as in the next chapter. 
Suppose first that we want to define a binary operation, call it 0, on propo-
sitions. This is done by assigning a truth-value to the proposition C = Po Q for 
all possible combinations of truth-values of P and Q. Now any given proposi-
tion can take only two possible truth-values, which we denote by 1 (true) and 0 
(false). There result four possible input truth-combinations for P and Q, and 
these correspond to the rows of the truth table. The columns are headed by 
the propositions involved, three in this case: P, Q, P 0 Q. 
The entry, 0 or 1, in each place is the truth-value of the proposition cor-
responding to that column for the input truth-combination for that row. The 
result is a 4 x 3 "matrix" of zeros and ones. We usually take the P-column to 
be 1100 and the Q-column to be 1010, whereupon the Po Q-column contains 
the definition of the operation o' Time for some examples.

In Table 2.1 the outer columns give the input truth-values for P and Q, so 
that the rows correspond to the combinations: 
1 P and Q both true, 
2 P true and Q false, 
3 P false and Q true, 

40 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
4 P and Q both false. 
The middle six columns then define: 
P 1\ Q as true when P and Q are both true and false otherwise, 
P V Q as false precisely when P and Q are both false, 
P =} Q as false only when P is true and Q is false, 
P == Q as true only when P and Q have the same truth-value, 
P Â£:, Q as true only when exactly one of P and Q is true, 
P * Q as false only when P and Q are both true. 
The first four of these are just the definitions of the basic operations 1\, V, =}, == 
given in the previous section. /:, is the usual notation for the "exclusive or", 
and * is another operation that turns out to have an interesting property (see 
Exercise 2.23); P * Q means that at least one of P, Q is false. 
So much for definitions. Truth tables can also be used to establish laws, 
which assert the logical equivalence of various compound propositions. Exam-
ples are the de Morgan laws, 
commutative laws for V and 1\, 
associative laws for V and 1\, 
distributive laws for 1\ over V and for V over 1\. 
Such a law is derived from the definitions in Table 2.1 by constructing a 
truth table as in the following example, where the columns are numbered only 
for the purpose of describing the construction.

The entries in Table 2.2 are made one column at a time in the following 
way. 

2. Logic 
41 
First step. Enter the input truth-values of P in columns 1, 7, 11, consistently. 
Do the same for Q in columns 3 and 9, and for R in columns 5 and 13 .. 
Second step Fill in column 4 using the first definition in Table 2.1 with input 
truth-values from columns 3 and 5. Do the same for columns 8 and 12 using 
the second definition in Table 2.1 with input truth-values from the adjacent 
columns. 
Third step Get column 2 from columns 1 and 4 using V, then column 10 from 
columns 8 and 12 using 1\. 
Fourth step Get column 6 from columns 2 and 10 using the definition of :=. 
The process uses the definitions to work cumulatively from within brackets 
outwards, starting with the prescribed truth-values of P, Q, R and finishing 
with the truth-value of the whole expression recorded under := in column 6. 
Since these eight values are all 1, we conclude that the assertion always holds, 
and we have proved one of the distributive laws. 
In contrast to laws, which assert the equivalence of various compound propo-
sitions, we also have several rules of inference. The key operation in these is, of 
course, implication, and they are actually used by mathematicians to construct 
proofs. Some important examples are 
modus ponens: 
modus tollens: 
proof by contradiction: 
proof by contraposition:

2.3 Syllogisms 
The propositional calculus studied the previous two sections is conceptually 
simpler, though historically later, than another fundamental branch of formal 
logic, the predicate calculus, which is also known as the logic of quantifiers and 
forms the foundation for much of the material in this book. This subject had 
its real beginning in the syllogistic of Aristotle around 350 Be, and this section 
is devoted to an essay on that ancient topic. 
In predicate calculus, the basic objects are terms, which occur as parts, the 
subject and predicate, of a proposition. Terms are "things", like parrots or 
numbers, or (in the case of predicates) "attributes", like mortal or prime. (The 
distinction between a thing and an attribute is little more than a linguistic 
convention: an attribute becomes a thing if we put the word "thing" after 
it. ) 
A syllogism is an inference of the form P 1\ Q :=} R, where the premises 
P, Q and the conclusion R are all categorical propositions, that is, each is 
one of the following four types: 
A: every s is (a) p, 
E: no s is (a) p, 
I: some s is (a) p, 
0: some s is not (a) p, 
In each case, the subject s and predicate p are terms, "some" means "at 
least one" , and three different terms appear twice each in different propositions. 
This is illustrated by the following classical example. 
P no god is mortal, 
Q every man is mortal, 
R no man is a god, 
where Q is of type A, and P, R are of type E. 
In order to enumerate the possible syllogistic forms, we need some nomen-
clature. First, of the three terms involved, the predicate of the conclusion is 
called the major term, the subject of the conclusion is the minor term, and 
the third term is the middle term. Then the premise containing the major 
term is the major premise and that containing the minor term is the minor 
premise. In the above example, the major, minor and middle terms are thus 
god, man, mortal respectively. It is customary, as in this example, to write the 
major premise first. 

44 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
With this in mind, one more ingredient is needed to complete the description 
of a given syllogistic form: the distribution of the middle term between the two 
premises. This can be done in four ways, corresponding to the four figures of 
the syllogism. Letting c denote the major term and a the minor, these figures 
are as in Table 2.4, where b denotes the middle term.

The subject is written first in each case, and so (obviously) is the major 
premise. In the above example the middle term (mortal) appears as the predi-
cate in both premises, so this is an example of the second figure. 
For a more mathematical example, consider the syllogism: 
no square is prime 
some squares are odd 
major premise 
minor premise 
conclusion 
some odd numbers are not prime 
(type E) 
(type I) 
(type 0). 
The middle term b = "square" appears as the subject in both premises, so this 
is an example of figure 3. 
Our enumeration of syllogistic forms is now complete: there are four types 
(A, E, I, 0) possible for each of the three propositions involved and four fig-
ures (1, 2, 3, 4) for each such combination .. So there are just 256 altogether. 
Of these, it was shown by Aristotle and his pupil Theophrastus that exactly 15 
represent valid deductions. Those of a given figure can be represented by words 
containing three vowels corresponding in order to the types of the three propo-
sitions. This was actually done in medireval times, and the resulting mnemonics 
appear in Table 2.5. A quick check shows that our two examples above are of 
the form CESARE and FERISON respectively, and so both are valid.

We turn attention to the problem of establishing the validity or otherwise of 
a given syllogistic form. The method described below, while of some historical 

2. Logic 
45 
interest, is not entirely satisfactory. A better method will emerge in the course 
of the next chapter. 
The method involves the use of a Lewis Carroll diagram. This takes 
the form of a square U as shown in Fig. 2.1, with the upper half, left half 
middle square representing the major, minor, middle terms respectively, and 
the complementary parts representing their negations in each case. The square 
is thus divided up into eight sections. Taking CESARE in as in our first example 
above, the major premise asserts that "no e is b" , that is, the upper half of the 
middle square is empty, and we record this by putting zeros (0) in the two 
corresponding sections of U. The minor premise asserts that "every a is b", or 
"no a is not b", and two more sections can be marked with zero for empty. 
The conclusion "no a is a e" will hold if the upper left quadrant of U is empty, 
and indeed it is. So the conclusion holds and CESARE is valid in the second 
figure.

Fig. 2.1. Lewis Carroll diagram for CESARE. 
Propositions of type A and E correspond to the assertion that two sections 
of the diagram are empty. Types I and 0 correspond to the assertion that at 
least one of two sections is non-empty, but we cannot say which. To indicate 
this, we put a one (I or possibly -) on the common boundary of the sections 
concerned. To illustrate this, consider the following example: 
P some parrots can talk, 
Q all talkers are human beings, 
R some human beings are not parrots, 
which is of the type TIRANO in the fourth figure. We annotate Fig. 2.2 with p 
for the major term, h for the minor term and t for the middle term. The -
between left and right halves of the upper half of the middle square indicates 

46 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
that one of these two regions is not empty. The minor premise gives rise to the 
two zeros. 
",t

Fig. 2.2. Invalidity of TIRANO in the fourth figure. 
We want to deduce that the lower left quadrant of the diagram is non-empty. 
But the markings corresponding to the premises do not touch this part of the 
diagram. Hence, we cannot make the conclusion and TIRANO in the fourth 
figure is invalid. 
Incidentally, we can deduce from the diagram that the top left quarter of 
the middle square is non-empty, that is, "some hare p", which is of type I. 
Hence, DIMARIS is valid in the fourth figure. 
While the previous proof (of validity) is quite convincing, this proof (of 
invalidity) seems somehow less satisfactory. While it can be justified, you might 
prefer an alternative method, such as giving a counter-example. To show that a 
universal statement, like "1 and A always imply 0 in the fourth figure", is false, 
it is sufficient to find one example where it fails. Here is a case of TIRANO in 
the fourth figure where P and Q are true and R is false: 
P some integers are multiples of 4 
Q all integer multiples of 4 are even 
R some even numbers are not integers.

syllogistic forms.

2.29 The fourth. 
2.30 It can be contended that, as A =} I and E =} 0, nine more valid forms 
can be added to the list in Table 2.5: BARBARI and CELARONT in 
the first figure, CESARO and CAMESTROS in the second, DARA-
PTI and FELAPTON in the third, and BRAMANTIP, CAMENOS 
and FESAPO in the fourth. By experimenting with these, try to put 
your finger on the root of this contention and so resolve it. 
2.31 Lewis Carroll diagrams can be used as an alternative to truth ta-
bles for proving laws and rules of inference of the type discussed 
in Section 2 above. Thus, if a, b, c are replaced by A, B, a respec-
tively in Fig. 2.1, the eight sections ofthe diagram correspond in the 
obvious way to the eight input combinations of truth-values for any 
expression X involving propositions A, B, a. Placing x in just those 
sections for which X is true then gives a complete description of the 
truth-values of X. Apply this in the case 
P = B b. a, 
X = A b. P, 
Q = A b. B, 
Y = Q b. a 
to prove the associative law for b. (the exclusive or). 
2.32 Using the fact that (P =} Q) == (",P V Q), use a Lewis Carroll 
diagram to prove the law of syllogism 
(A =} B) =} Â«B =} a) =} (A =} aÂ». 
2.33 Here is a four-term syllogism of type IMPERATOR: 
Is it valid or not? 
some beasts are cats 
no dogs are cats 
all beasts are animals 
... some animals are not dogs.

2.4 Quantifiers 
Recall Exercise 2.8(c), in which the PMI was put into the notation of proposi-
tional calculus as follows: 
(P(l) 1\ (P(n) =} Pen + 1Â») =} Pen), 
where n is a positive integer. The propositions Pen) =} P(n+ 1) on the left 
and Pen) on the right need to be made more precise by specifying the range of 
values of n we have in mind. In both cases, that range is the whole of N, as in 
the statement of the PMI in Section 1.4. This is expressed succinctly using the 
universal quantifier V, pronounced "for every" (for all, for each, for any): 
(P(l) 1\ ('In Pen) =} Pen + 1Â») =} 'In Pen). 
Similarly, the statement of Theorem 1.4 is just 
n 
1 
'In 2:>= '2n (n+1), 
(2.1) 
k=l 
and that of Exercise 2.12 takes the form 
P(l, 1) 1\ ('1m 'In P(m, n) =} (P(m, +1, n) 1\ P(m, n + 1Â») =} '1m 'In P(m, n). 
(2.2) 
The double quantifier '1m 'In is sometimes further abbreviated to '1m, n: "for 
all m and n" (ranging independently over N). The assumption that m and n 
are integers is implicit; we will see in the next section how to incorporate this 
information explicitly into the formula. 
Most decent theorems are of a general nature, that is, they begin with a 
universal quantifier: 'Ix P(x), so that P(x) is true for all values of the variable x 
in a specified range. To prove such a theorem, we must show that P(x) is true 
for every value of x. On the other hand, if just one value of x can be found 
for which P(x) is false, the proposition 'Ix P(x) will be false, and we will have 
proved its negation. Thus, 
(there is an x with P(x) false) =} rv(Vx P(xÂ». 
The left-hand part is expressed succinctly using the existential quantifier ::I, 
pronounced "there is" (there exists, for some, for at least one): 
::Ix rvP(x) =} rv(Vx P(xÂ». 
(2.3) 
When proving universal propositions false in this way, the x for which P(x) 
is false is often called a counter-example. We now have a complete list of 
quantifiers: 'land ::I. 

2. Logic 
49 
To continue with the theme of negating quantified propositions, first observe 
that the implication (2.3) is actually an equivalence: 
::Ix ",P(x) == ",('ix P(x)), 
(2.4) 
for if P(x) is not true for all x, it must be false for some x. Next, consider the 
following two laws of propositional calculus: 
"'( ",P) == P, 
(P == Q) =} (",P == "'Q). 
(2.5) 
Starting with (2.4), proceed in four steps: apply the second law, apply the first 
law, replace P(x) by ",P(x), apply the first law again. We get the following 
sequence of equivalences: 
",(::Ix ",P(x)) 
",(",'ix P(x)), 
",(::Ix ",P(x)) 
-
'ix P(x), 
",,(::Ix ""( ""P(x))) 
'ix ",P(x), 
",(::Ix P(x)) 
'ix ""P(x). 
Quantified propositions are thus negated according to the following rules. 
Theorem 2.1 
",('ix P(x)) 
::Ix ""P(x) 
",(::Ix P(x)) 
_ 
'ix ""P(x). 
(2.6) 
o 
So much for singly quantified propositions and their negations. Passing to 
doubly quantified propositions, we have already had an example: 'im, n P(m, n) 
in formula (2.2). Reading this as "for every pair (m, n) of positive integers 
P(m, n) is true", we can regard it as singly quantified. The same applies to its 
negative, 3m, n ",P(m, n): there is a pair (m, n) of positive integers for which 
P(m, n) is false. 
But when two different quantifiers appear, the situation is more compli-
cated. For example, consider the proposition 
P 
'in::lm 
m>n, 
(2.7) 
where m and n are positive integers, which asserts that there is no biggest 
positive integer. Since for any n we can take m = n + 1 and get a true statement 

50 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
(n + 1 > n), P is true. Another example is obtained by changing the order of 
quantification: 
Q 
3mVn 
m>n. 
(2.8) 
This asserts something quite different, that there is a positive integer bigger 
than every positive integer, so Q is false: taking n = m gives a counter-example 
to the proposition Vn m > n. Thus, ",(P == Q), and we have proved (by counter-
example) that quantifiers do not satisfy the commutative law. 
Our final result in this chapter concerns the negation of multiply quantified 
propositions. To negate the proposition in (2.7), proceed as follows: 
",P 
",(Vn 3m m > n) 
3n ",(3m m > n) 
3n Vm '" (m > n) 
3n \:1m m ::; n. 
This clearly asserts the existence of a biggest positive integer, and is of course 
false. Similarly, from (2.8) we get the true statement 
",Q = Vm 3n m ::; n. 
These formulae suggest the general rule for negating multiply quantified propo-
sitions. Its proof, which is by induction on n, is left as an exercise. 
Theorem 2.2 
Let P(Xl' ... ,xn ) be a proposition depending on n variables Xk, 1 ::; k ::; n, and 
let Qk, 1 ::; k ::; n, be n quantifiers. Denoting a succession of quantifications by

n

'" II Qk Xk P(Xl,"" xn) == II Qk Xk ",P(Xl,"" xn). 
(2.9)

o 
One last piece of nomenclature. It may be that in a proposition depending on 
several variables, not all the variables are quantified. Such variables are called 
free, as opposed to the quantified ones, which are called bound. The resulting 
proposition then depends on the free variables. For example, the proposition 
Vx 3y P(x, y, z) has two bound variables, x and y, and one free variable, z; it 
is thus the form of Q(z).

Sets 
"Of all the words in the English Language 
the one with the greatest number of meanings 
according to the OED is the word 'set'." 
D. L. Johnson 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
And that's not counting proper nouns, such as the name of an evil ancient 
Egyptian deity, or foreign words, like the Korean word for the number three. 
By way of contrast, the number of definitions of the word "set" in this book is 
none. The reason for this is that in modern mathematics the notion of set is 
fundamental. For example, numbers can be defined in terms of sets, and this 
will occupy us towards the end of the book, with the object of gaining some 
kind of comprehension of the infinite. 
It is easy to find synonyms for the word "set": family, collection, ensemble, 
aggregate and sometimes system or class, but never group. It is also easy to 
give examples where any number of identifiable objects may be thought of as 
compromising a set. Thus, a number of: 
people, pieces of cutlery, golden daffodils, ideas, letters, ravens, theories 
may collectively be referred to as a(n): 
congregation, canteen, host, theory, alphabet, unkindness, philosophy 
respectively. In every case, a number of things are put together and regarded 
as a single entity.

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
3.1 Introduction 
The individual objects that make up a set are called its elements, mem-
bers or (sometimes) points. We usually denote sets by capital letters and 
their members by lower-case letters. Membership is expressed by the symbol E: 
a E A, pronounced "a is an element of A" or "a belongs to A", and non-
membership by Â¢.. The most obvious way to describe a particular set is to list 
its members, separated by commas and enclosed in braces. For example, the 
equation 
A={1,2,3,4} 
(3.1) 
asserts that the set A consists of the first four positive integers. Then 3 E A 
and 5 Â¢. A. 
If S is any set all of whose elements belong to another set T, we say that S is 
a subset of T, or S is contained in T, and write S ~ T. Put into mathematical 
notation, this definition takes the form 
\/x E S 
x E T, 
or alternatively 
xES =} x E T. 
It is by checking this implication that we normally verify the assertion that 
S ~ T. Two sets are equal when they consist of the same elements, and this 
happens if and only if each is contained in the other: 
S = T == S ~ T 1\ T ~ S. 
Some related symbols are defined as follows: 
T~S, 
S ~ T 1\ S :f. T, 
rv(S ~ T). 
The brace notation can be extended to describe subsets. If S is a set and P 
is some property that the elements of S mayor may not have, the expression 
T = {x E S I x has P} 
defines T to be the "set of all elements S that have property P". Thus, if A is 
as above (3.1) and N, as usual, denotes the set of positive integers, then 
A = {n E N In:::; 4}, 
and 
{a E A I a is even} = {2,4}. 

3. Sets 
55 
This notation can be used to make an important definition. For any subset A 
of a given set S, we define the complement A' of A in S to be the set of those x 
in S that do not belong to A: 
A' = {x E 81 x ~ A}, 
pronounced "A dashed" . 
Example 3.1 
As an illustration of the power of set theory, we will now show how even the 
rudimentary ideas and notation described so far are sufficient for a complete 
treatment of the syllogistic. 
We begin by translating the four types of categorical proposition into re-
lations between sets. This is done in two stages,of which the first is merely 
to abbreviate them using quantifiers and the symbol E. Thus, replacing terms 
(like parrot) by the corresponding sets (like {parrots}, the set of all parrots), 
type A takes the form Vx E S x E P, where S is the subject-set and P the 
predicate-set. Types E, I, 0 are similarly abbreviated, and the first stage of the 
translation is complete: 
A 
Vx E Sx E P, 
E 
Vx E Sx ~ P, 
I 
3XESXEP, 
o 
3x E S x ~ P. 
For the second stage, notice first that A is just an abbreviation of our 
definition of the notion of containment: S <; P. Next, by our rules for negating 
quantified propositions (Theorem 2.1), 0 = rvA 
== 
rv(S <; P) = S et P. 
Turning to E, our definition of the complement of a set can be restated in the 
form: x E pi {:} X ~ P. Finally, I = rvE 
== 
rv(S <; Pi) = S et P'. We 
summarize this into a theorem. 
Theorem 3.1 
The four types of categorical proposition are expressed in the notation of set 
theory as follows: 
A 
Vx E S x E P -
St:;;.P, 
E 
Vx E S x ~ P 
S <; pi

3x E S x E P

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Now a typical syllogism takes the form P 1\ Q =} R, where each of the 
propositions P, Q, R is one of these four types, and the three terms involved 
(which are now sets) are distributed in one of four ways (the four figures). Then 
the translation of BARBARA (Fig. 1) looks like this: 
B ~ C 1\ A ~ B =} A ~ C, 
(3.2) 
which is almost obvious (see Exercise 3.7). 
Validity of syllogistic forms is thus easily established using set theory. Show-
ing invalidity in this way is also a simple matter. To illustrate the method, take 
the form PORSENA in the third figure: 
B i C 1\ B ~ A' =} A ~ C? 
To invalidate this, just one counter-example will suffice, that is, three sets 
A, B, C for which 
B i C 1\ B ~ A' 1\ A i C. 
In other words, we seek three sets A, B, C such that A and B have no 
element in common and each has an element not in C. Such sets can be found 
in the set S = {I, 2, 3}, namely, A = {I}, B = {2}, C = {3}, and form the 
required counter-example. 
The derivation of the 15 valid syllogistic forms (and the invalidation of 
the other 241) would make a nice project, and the set-theoretic method just 
described recommends itself as the best way to set about it. 
We conclude this section by forging the first links between the notions of set 
and number. The number of elements in a set S is called its cardinality (or 
order or power) and denoted by lSI (or #S). A set is finite if its cardinality is 
finite and infinite otherwise. A set with just one element is called a singleton. 
It is convenient to operate with a set of cardinality 0, called the empty set 
and written 0 (Scandinavian letter, not Greek "phi"). It makes sense to say 
that 0 ~ S for any set S. 
Letting Il, as usual, denote the set of all integers, define 
Il( n) = {x E Il 11 ~ x ~ n}, 
(3.3) 
so that A in (3.1) is just another name for 1l(4). Now for any nEil, n ~ 0, 
IIl(n)1 = n. Thus, the cardinalities possible for finite sets are precisely the 
non-negative integers. In Chapter 6 we shall develop a theory of infinite sets, 
like N, Il, Ql (the rational numbers) and R (the real numbers). In this theory, 
sets with the same cardinality as INI will be called countably infinite (or 
denumerable); the common value of their cardinality is written No, pronounced 
"aleph-null". While N (of course), Il and Q are all count ably infinite, it turns 
out that R is not. Writing IRI = c, the cardinal of the continuum, we will 
prove that No < c. So some infinities are bigger than others.

EXERCISES 
3.1 Set-theoretic notation can be used to further improve propositions 
depending on quantified variables by making precise the range of 
these variables. Thus, the formula in (2.1) of Section 2.4 achieves 
the definitive form:

Write formulae (2.2), (2.7), (2.8) of Section 2.4 in this form.

3.12 Suggest a scheme whereby the integers Z can be counted, that is, 
number the elements of Z with positive integers n E N in such a way 
that 
(i) every z E Z is given a number, 
(ii) no two different Zl, Z2 E Z get the same number, 
(iii) every number n E N is used. 
3.13 Suggest a partial numbering for the positive rationals IQ+, that is, a 
numbering satisfying (i) and (ii) of the previous exercise. 
3.14 Let S be a set with n elements, where n is a non-negative integer. 
Use the binomial theorem with x = 1 to find a formula for the total 
number of subsets of S. 
3.2 Operations 
We saw in Section 2.2 how new propositions can be obtained from given ones 
using logical operations: P I\Q, PVQ, ",P, and so on. In a very similar way, set-
theoretical operations are rules for getting "new sets from old". This analogy 
works to advantage in two directions. First, most of the ideas developed in this 
section and the next will look natural and familiar in the light of their logical 
counterparts in the previous chapter. Second, the translation into set theory 
both reinforces and even clarifies our understanding of formal logic. 
We begin with four important binary operations. Each of these can be 
applied to any pair A, B of subsets of a previously specified set S to produce a 
third subset. 

3. Sets 
59 
The intersection of A and B is the set of elements of S that belong to A 
and B: 
An B = {x E S I x E A!\ x E B}, 
pronounced "A intersect B". 
The union of A and B is the set of elements of S that belong to A or B: 
Au B = {x E S I x E A V x E B}, 
pronounced "A union B" . 
The difference of A and B is the set of elements of S that belong to A but 
not B: 
A \ B = {x E S I x E A /\ x Â¢ B}, 
pronounced "A minus B" . 
The symmetric difference of A and B is the set of elements of S that 
belong to exactly one of A, B: 
A L, B = {x E S I x E Au B /\ x Â¢ An B}, 
pronounced "A delta B" .

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
In some contexts, the terms "meet" and "join" are used in place of inter-
section and union, respectively, and A \ B is sometimes written A - B. Sets 
with no element in common (A n B = 0) are called disjoint. In this case, it is 
sometimes convenient to write their union as A U B, the "disjoint union of A 
and B". 
Operations of this kind can be described in a visual way by means of Venn 
diagrams, in which the prescribed set S is represented by a square in the 
plane, and subsets of S by circles within this square. Then the elements of S 
are thought of as points within this square, and the elements of a subset A ~ S 
are thought of as points in the interior of the circle labelled A. Then the five 
operations defined above are described by hatching the region corresponding 
to the subset each defines, as in Fig. 3.1. In our analogy between set theory 
and formal logic, Venn diagrams correspond pretty closely to Lewis Carroll dia-
grams, and can be used to prove propositions about sets, although an arguably 
better method will be given in the next section. 
To conclude this section, we describe one more construction whereby two 
given sets may be combined to produce a third. This operation is inherently 
different from the four binary operations described above, where in each case 
the two sets to be combined, and also the resulting combinations are subsets 
of some given set (called S above). The two input sets for this last operation 
are arbitrary. 
Let us start with a familiar example. In coordinate geometry, a point P in 
the plane is specified by its two coordinates x and y, and we write P = (x, y). 
The order (x first, y second) is important here: (1,2) and (2,1) are different 
points. So we speak of (x, y) as an ordered pair. This is in marked contrast to 
the braces used to describe sets, where {I, 2} = {2, I}. Again, we may have an 
ordered pair (x,y) with x = y : (0,0) is just the origin, for example, whereas 
to write {x, y} when x = y is to abuse notation and is not allowed. 
With this in mind, let A and B be arbitrary sets. Then their Cartesian 
product is given by 
A x B = {(a, b) I a E A, bE B}, 
pronounced "A cross B". 
When A = B, we get the special case of the Cartesian square A x A, 
sometimes written A X2 or just A2. In the very special case when A = B = JR., 
we get the Cartesian plane JR.2. We can similarly define real 3-space JR.3 as the 
set of all ordered triples (x, y, z), x, y, z E JR., which forms the setting for the 
Newtonian model of the cosmos. The inductive definition 
]Rl = ]R, 
gives real n-space, n E N, whose elements are all n-tuples (Xl, x2, ... ,xn ) of 
real numbers. ]Rn is the basic object of study in linear algebra.

62 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
3.3 Laws 
The operations of complementation, union, intersection, difference and sym-
metric difference apply to subsets of a given set S to yield new subsets of S. 
More complicated operations are obtained by combining them in various ways. 
When two such combinations result in the same new subset for all possible 
input sets, we have a set-theoretical law. Such laws, like those of arithmetic 
and logic, are statements about sets that are always true. There are nine ex-
amples to be found in Exercises 3.15-3.19 in the previous section, such as the 
distributive law (Exercise 3.19.): 
An (B U C) = (A n B) U (A n C), 
(3.4) 
VA,B,C ~ S. 
In every case, the definitions of the set-theoretical operations can be used 
to convert such a law into a logical law. Thus (3.4) becomes 
(x E A) 1\ (x E B V x E C) == (x E A 1\ x E B) V (x E A 1\ x E C), 
(3.5) 
which can be established using a truth table. Truth tables can therefore be 
used to prove laws, and also to define operations, in set theory in the same way 
as in logic. When doing this, we suppress the repetitive "x E" (which occurs 
seven times in (3.5)), and interpret a 1 or 0 under the symbol for a subset as 
meaning x E or x ~ that subset in the row in question. Similarly, a 1 or 0 
under a set-theoretical operation means that x E or x ~ the subset resulting 
from the application of that operation. The rows correspond to the different 
basic regions of the Venn diagram, eight in the case of a three-variable law 
like (3.5), and the corresponding input-tuples of zeros and ones are entered 
consistently at the outset. 
All this will become a lot clearer with the aid of an example. We shall prove 
the other distributive law, which, though it resembles (3.4), is strangely less 
intuitive: 
Au (B n C) = (A u B) n (A u C). 
(3.6) 
In Table 3.1 we define U and n in this formulation.

As the final example in this section, we verify that the subsets of a given 
set S form a group under the operation of symmetric difference. 
Theorem 3.2 
Under the binary operation 6, the subsets of S form (i) an associative system 
that (ii) has an identity, with respect to which (iii) every element has an inverse. 
Proof 
Referring to Table 3.3, the first table gives the definition of 6, and the other 
two prove that 0 is the identity and A is its own inverse, respectively, which 
verifies (ii) and (iii). 
The truth of (i) follows from Table 3.4.

EXERCISES 
3.26 The four unary operations of propositional calculus (see Exercise 2.13) 
correspond to four unary operations on subsets A of a given set S. 
What are the four subsets so obtained? 
3.27 Use a truth table to prove the law 
(A \ B) U (B \ A) = (A u B) \ (A n B). 
3.28 Use a truth table to prove the distributive law (3.4). 
3.29 Use Exercise 3.21 in conjunction with the previous exercise to prove 
that for any subsets AI, A 2 , A3 <::: S, 
IAI U A2 U A31 = 
IAII + IA21 + IA31 -IAI n A21-IA2 n A31 
-IAI n A31 + IAI n A2 n A31. 
3.30 Use the analogy between set theory and propositional calculus to

between subsets A, B <::: S. 
3.31 Use the previous exercise to prove that 
(A = B) == (A <::: B) 1\ (B <::: A). 

3. Sets 
65 
3.32 The (almost obvious) laws 
AuA=A, 
AnA=A 
are called idempotent laws for u, n. Of the 16 binary operations 
on subsets of a set S (cf. Exercise 2.22), how many satisfy the idem-
potent law? 
3.33 Under how many of the 16 binary operations on the subsets of a 
set S do the latter form a group (cf. Theorem 3.2)? 
3.4 The Power Set 
It is sometimes necessary to work with sets whose members are themselves sets. 
Indeed, such a set appeared implicitly in Theorem 3.2 at the end of the previous 
section, where we proved that the subsets of a given set S form a group under 
the binary operation 6. This group is thus a set whose elements are sets. Let 
us make the following definition. 
Definition 3.1 
Given any set S, the set of all its subsets is called the power set of S, written 
P(S). 
Following the educational principle that it's easier to understand something 
once you know how big it is, we elevate Exercise 3.14 to the status of a theorem 
and, for the sale of variety, give an alternative proof. 
Theorem 3.3 
If S is a finite set with lSI = n, then IP(S)I = 2n. 
Proof 
Let the elements of S be Xl, X2, â¢â¢. , X n . Then any subset A <;;:; S has a kind of 
"signature" s(A) constructed as follows: s(A) is the binary number of n digits 
whose kth digit is 1 if Xk E A and 0 if Xk ~ A. So, for example, s(0) is a string 
of zeros, s(S) is a string of ones, and in general there are exactly IAI ones in 
s(A). Since 
( a) different subsets have different signatures and 

66 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
(b) every n-digit binary number is the signature of some subset, 
it follows that the total number IP(S)I of subsets is equal to the total number 
of n-digit binary numbers, namely 2n. 
0 
A subset A of S can thus be thought of in two different ways, as a subset 
of S or as an element of P(S): 
A ~ S {=} A E P(S). 
There is scope for confusion here, which increases when we consider, as we 
sometimes must, subsets of P(S): 
a ~ P(S) {=} a E P(P(S)). 
In an attempt to keep things clear, we shall consistently use lower-case Greek 
letters for subsets of P(S), and refer to such a subset as a family of subsets 
of S. The rest of this section is given over to the description of two important 
examples of such families. 
A family 11" of non-empty subsets of a given set S is called a partition of S 
if each element XES belongs to exactly one subset P E 11". This condition can 
be stated more precisely in terms of symbols: 
't/X E S 31 P E 11" 
X E P, 
(3.7) 
where the symbol 31 is pronounced "there is exactly one" . 
Examples of partitions have already appeared in this chapter. Thus, when 
o cAe S, the family {A, A'} partitions S into two subsets. Again, when 
A, B ~ S, the family {A n B, A \ B, B \ A, (A U B)'} partitions S into four 
subsets, provided they are all non-empty (0 is precluded to avoid triviality). 
A more concrete example is provided by the set Z of all integers. Fix a 
positive integer n ::::': 2 and consider the set of all its integer multiples, 
nZ = {nk 1 k E Z}. 
By adding 1 to each element of this set, we get another, 
1 + nZ = {l + nk 1 k E Z}. 
Continuing in this way, we get some more, 
r + nZ = {r + nk 1 k E Z}, 
where r = 2,3, ... ,n - 1. We stop here as n + nZ = Z again. A little thought 
should convince you that, for any given integer m, mEr + nZ, where r is 
the (smallest, non-negative) remainder on division of m by n : m = qn + r, 

3. Sets 
67 
0::; r ::; n-1 (see Theorem 1.14). Since r is uniquely determined by m and n, it 
follows that every integer belongs to exactly one of the sets r+nZ, 0 ::; r ::; n-1, 
which therefore partition Z. This r is called the residue of m modulo n, and 
the sets r + nZ, 0 ::; r ::; n - 1, are called residue classes modulo m. We 
shall return to this important partition in the next chapter. 
To get an example of a partition into infinitely many subsets, take S = R, 
the real line, and 
Jr = {[n, n + 1) 1 n E Z}, 
(3.8) 
where the half-open interval [a, b), with a, bE R and a < b, is given by 
[a,b) = {x E Ria::; x < b}. 
Returning to the general theory, it is often convenient to formulate con-
dition (3.7) in terms of members of Jr alone, without reference to elements x 
of S. Thus, the fact that every xES belongs to some member P of Jr can be 
expressed in the form 
U P=S. 
(3.9) 
PE7r 
The fact that there is only one such P for each x is expressed by the statement 
(P, Q E Jr) /\ (P -j. Q) * P n Q = 0 
(3.10) 
Conditions (3.9) and (3.10) say respectively that the members of Jr "cover" S 
and "do not overlap" . The Venn diagram depicting a partition 11' of S thus looks 
like a patchwork quilt, as illustrated in Fig. 3.2 with IJrI = 7. We have shown 
that if Jr is a partition of S, then (3.9) and (3.10) hold. The converse of this 
statement (Exercise 3.34) is almost obvious. 
Fig. 3.2. Partitions look like patchwork quilts. 
One final important point is as follows. When working with a partition Jr of 
a set S, it is often convenient to have at hand a set T of representatives of the 

68 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
members of 1r. Such a subset T ~ S forms a transversal for 1r and is defined 
by the property that in T there is exactly one element of each member of 1r: 
VP E 1r 
IPnTI = 1. 
The single element of P n T thus "represents" P in T. The following proposi-
tion, although it is a bone of contention among logicians, is accepted almost 
unanimously by members of the mathematical community. 
Definition 3.2 
The Axiom of Choice. Every partition of every set has a transversal. 
This famous axiom manifests itself in many branches of pure mathematics. 
It appears in many guises, and at least one of these will occur later in this 
book. 
Our second important example of a family of subsets of a given set S is of an 
entirely different kind. Though not as ubiquitous as the notion of partition, it is 
of fundamental importance in that branch of mathematics known as analysis. 
We introduce it by giving a concrete example. 
Given real numbers a, b with a < b, define the open interval 
( a, b) = {x E JR I a < x < b}. 
Thus, (a, b) is a subset of the real line JR, and so is any union of such intervals. 
Call a union of open intervals an open subset of R Finally, put 
T = {U ~ JR I U is open}. 
We collect some properties of T into a theorem. 
Theorem 3.4 
The family T of open subsets of JR has the following properties: 
(i) 0 E T, 
(ii) JR E T, 
(iii) any union of members of T is a member of T, 
(iv) U, VET =} Un VET. 

3. Sets 
69 
Proof 
(i) 0 is the "empty union" (cf. empty sum 0 and empty product 1). 
(ii) IR = U (-n, n). 
nEN 
(iii) A union of unions is a union. 
(iv) This one is a bit tricky so we'll busk it. The intersection of two unions is a 
double union of individual intersections (generalized distributive law), and 
the intersection of two ,open intervals is again an open interval (possibly 
empty). 
0 
Properties (i)-(iv), apart from being a source of exercises on unions and 
intersections, actually form a system of axioms. For any set S, a subset T E 
P(S) that satisfies (i)-(iv) (with S in place of IR in (ii)) is called a topology 
on S. A set S equipped with a topology T is called a topological space. The 
study of topological spaces forms a large and increasingly important area of 
modern mathematics. We confine ourselves here to a few simple examples in 
the exercises.

Relations 
"Lexicographer. A writer of dictionaries, 
a harmless drudge." 
S. Johnson 
Dictionary of the English Language 
Various relations exist between things of the same kind. Thus, if a, b E P = {all 
living human beings}, the relation a of sisterhood may be expressed by writing 
a a b if a is a sister of b. Again, the relation I of divisibility exists on the set Z 
of all integers: a I b if a divides b. In general, a given relation p on a set S may 
or may not hold between two elements a, bE S. Listing or otherwise describing 
the ordered pairs (a, b) for which it does hold defines the relation. This leads 
to the following definition, which is a nice example of how to attach a precise 
mathematical meaning to an everyday word. 
Definition 4.1 
A (binary) relation p on a set S is a subset of S x S : p ~ S x S. We often 
write a p b instead of ( a, b) E p. 
This very general definition encompasses two particularly important but 
very different special types of relation, equivalence relations and orderings, 
which we will study in turn in this chapter.

4.1 Equivalence Relations 
We shall start by defining three properties that a particular relation p on a 
given set S mayor may not have. Such a relation is called 
reflexive 
(R) 
symmetric 
(S) 
transitive 
(T) 
if 
Va E S apa, 
if 
a p b =} b p a, 
if 
a p b 1\ b p e =} ape, 
where a, band e denote elements of S. 
To illustrate these general properties, we extend the meagre list of examples 
given above, 
1 sisterhood on P, 
2 divisibility on Z, 
by adding a few more. 
3 Equality on any set S is defined by the diagonal subset 
Ll = {(s, s) Is E S} <;;; S x S; 
s = t {=} (s, t) E Ll. 
4 For a, b E lR., write a ::; b if b - a is non-negative. 
5 For a,b E Z, write a == b if a - b is a multiple of 5. 
6 For any set S and A, BE peS), write A % B if A is not contained in B. 
7 Let S be any set and 1r any partition of S. Then write a == b for a, bE S 
if b belongs to the same member P of 1r as a. 
8 Given (a, b), (e, d) EN x N, write (a, b) rv (e, d) if a + d = e + b. 
9 Given (a, b), (e, d) E Z x N, write (a, b) rv (e, d) if ad = eb. 
10 Let lR.[x] denote the set of all polynomials in an indeterminate x with real 
coefficients. Then for f(x),g(x) E lR.[x], write f(x) rv g(x) if f(x) - g(x) = 
(x 2 + l)h(x) for some hex) E lR.[x]. 
Table 4.1 shows which of these ten relations have which of these three 
properties. The first seven rows are more or less obvious, and the last three are 
exercises to which we shall return in Section 3 below. We shall also refer again 
to row 5 in the next section and to row 7 in a moment, but first, we will look 
at the main definition.

A relation p on a set S that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called an 
equivalence relation on S. 
It is pretty clear that any partition 1f of a set S determines an equivalence 
relation on S (in accordance with row 7 of Table 4.1, where it is written =). 
Less obvious but more important is the converse of this statement, and we now 
begin to work towards the derivation of this fact. 
So let rv denote a fixed equivalence relation on a given set S. Then for any 
a E S the set 
[aJ = {b E Sib rv a} 
is called the equivalence class of a. Of course [aJ depends on '" as well as a, 
and [aJ ~ S. We will prove two facts about equivalence classes. First, every 
element a E S belongs to at least one equivalence class: a = a E [aJ because '" 
is reflexive. Second, no element a E S can belong to two different equivalence 
classes, that is, for a, b, e E S, 
b E [aJ !\ b E [e] =} [a] = [eJ. 
This is proved using the symmetry and transitivity of '" as follows. First, 
bE [a] 
=} b rv a, by definition, and 
b E [e] 
=} 
b", e =} e '" b by (8), 
so that b", a and e rv b, and e'" a by (T). Then, using (T) again, 
dE [e] =} d rv e =} d rv a =} d E [a], 
( 4.1) 
and we have shown that every element d of [e] belongs to [aj, that is, [e] ~ [a]. 
Finally, by reversing the roles of a and e in the above argument, we obtain 
[a] ~ [ej, so that [aJ = [eJ as claimed. 

74 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
The two facts we have just established respectively assert that every element 
of S belongs to at least one equivalence class and to at most one equivalence 
class, that is, to exactly one, and we have proved the following theorem. 
Theorem 4.1 
If '" is an equivalence relation on a set S, then the distinct equivalence classes 
[a] = {b E Sib", a}, 
a E S, 
form a partition of S. 
o 
It turns out that if our equivalence relation", comes from a partition 1f of S, 
then the resulting equivalence classes are just the members of 1f. Conversely, 
starting from an equivalence relation "', if 1f is the resulting partition into 
equivalence classes, then the equivalence relation determined by 1f is just rv. We 
thus have a one-to-one correspondence between partitions of S and equivalence 
relations on S. (The notion of one-to-one correspondence, or bijection, will be 
made precise in the next chapter.) The point is that equivalence relations are 
easy to set up, whereas partitions are useful, so that Theorem 4.1 is important 
for practical reasons. Two such applications will be described in the next two 
sections. 
EXERCISES 
4.1 Given a set S, which of the properties (R), (8), (T) hold for the 
relation a of- b of inequality? 
4.2 Which of the properties (R), (8), (T) hold for the relation C of 
containment on P(S)? 
4.3 Prove that the relation", on N x N given in Example 8 is an equiv-
alence relation. 
4.4 Do the same for the relation", on Z x N in Example 9. 
4.5 The same again for the relation", on ~[x] in Example 10. 
4.6 What is wrong with following "proof" that property (R) of a rela-
tion p is a consequence of properties (8) and (T)? 
First, apb =} bpa by (8) . Then apb and bpa =} a '" a by (T). 
Hence p is reflexive.

tation here, which unfortunately is traditional. For the purposes of 
this question, use (x) for the equivalence class of x in JR.)

on a finite set with n elements. 
4.11 Prove that the condition

Find a transversal T for the equivalence classes. 
4.2 Congruences 
We focus attention on the relation == in Example 5 of the previous section. 
Since it depends crucially on the positive integer 5, we incorporate this into 
our notation and write it more precisely as follows: for a, b E Z, 
a == b (mod 5) {=} 5 I (a - b), 
where the left-hand part is pronounced "a is congruent to b modulo 5" and 
referred to as a congruence (modulo 5). 
Let us illustrate Theorem 4.1 in the previous section by working out what 
the equivalence classes are (as in the solution of Exercise 4.8). For a given 
a E Z, divide a by 5 in accordance with Theorem 1.14 to get 
a = 5q +r, 
o ::; r ::; 4. 

76 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Thus, a == r (mod 5) and so 
a E [r], 
o ~ r ~ 4, 
and there are exactly five equivalence classes: 
[0] = 52, [1] = 1 + 52, [2] = 2 + 52, [3] = 3 + 52, [4] = 4 + 52, 
which is just the partition into residue classes modulo 5 (see Section 3.4). The 
fact that these five classes are pairwise disjoint is expressed mathematically as 
follows: 
k, l E 2 
0 ~ k, l ~ 4, 
k == l(mod 5) =} k = l. 
It turns out to be possible to add and multiply these classes very much as 
if they were ordinary individual numbers: 
[k] + [l] = [k + lJ, 
[k] [l] = [kl]. 
( 4.2) 
But notice that there is something (rather subtle) here that requires proof. 
Take the first equation in (4.2). To define [k] + [lJ, we choose elements k, l from 
each class, add them up, and take the residue class of their sum. But if we 
made different choices, say k' E [k] and [' E [lJ, how do we know that the result 
[k' + l'] is the same as [k + l]? What has to be checked is that the operations 
in (4.2) are well-defined, that is, independent of the choice of representatives 
from [k] and [I]. 
That this is indeed the case is expressed mathematically as follows: 
k' E [k]/\ l' E [l] =} [k' + l'] = [k + l]/\ [k'l'] = [k, lJ, 
or, more conveniently in terms of congruences, 
k' == k(mod 5) /\ l' == l(mod 5) =} k' + l' == k + l(mod 5) /\ k' l' == kl(mod 5), 
(4.3) 
and we shall prove this now. 
Since our hypothesis assert that k' - k and l' - l are both divisible by 5, we 
can write 
k' = k + 5a, 
[' = l + 5b, 
a,b E 2. 
Then 
k' + l' = (k + l) + 5(a + b), k' l' = kl + 5(kb + la + 5ab). 
Since these numbers differ by a multiple of 5 from k + l, kl respectively, the 
conclusion of (4.3) follows. 
There is an obvious transversal T = {O, 1,2,3,4} for these classes. To avoid 
the tiresome square brackets, we sometimes replace each class by its repre-
sentative in T. When this is done, the addition and multiplication tables in

arithmetic modulo 5 are as shown in Table 4.2. Thus, the entries in the (2,4) 
places respectively assert that 
2 + 4 == 1 (mod 5), 
2.4 == 3 (mod 5). 
All that we have said so far generalizes nicely from the case n = 5 to that 
of an arbitrary positive integer n (assumed greater than 1 to avoid triviality). 
In particular, the formulae in (4.2) can be taken as the definition of the sum 
and product of the residue classes [kJ, [l] modulo n, 0 ::=::; k, l ::=::; n - 1. Thus, we 
can take T = {k E 2 I 0 ::=::; k ::=::; n - I} as a transversal and then the definitions 
of addition and multiplication modulo n take the form 
k + l = T, 
kl = s, 
where T, S are the remainders 0 ::=::; T, s ::=::; n - 1 on dividing k + l, kl respectively 
by n. Independence of choice of representatives is checked in the same way as 
for n = 5 above (see Exercise 4.1) and the resulting set of n residue classes is 
denoted by 2jn2, the "integers modulo n": 
2jn2 = {[k] I O::=::; k ::=::; n -I}. 
Here [k] denotes the residue class of k modulo n, often abbreviated to k for 
convenience. We can now state the following theorem, whose proof is left to 
the exercises (Exercises 4.12-4.16). 
Theorem 4.2 
(i) The operations of addition and multiplication modulo n are well defined. 
(ii) The set 2jn2 forms a commutative ring-with-l under these operations. 
(iii) 2jn2 is a field if and only if n is prime. 
o 
What this theorem means in practical terms is that residue classes modulo n 
can be treated in much the same way as individual numbers in arithmetic. 
Congruences play the role of equations and are manipulated in a similar way. 

78 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
The resulting theory of congruences forms an important part of elementary 
number theory. 
To conclude this section, we observe that the type of partition just described 
can be generalized from Z to any group G, where the role of nZ is played by 
an arbitrary subgroup H of G. The members of the corresponding partition 
are called cosets in this context, and they play a fundamental role in group 
theory. A word of caution, however, is appropriate in this general case. While 
the cosets always partition the group, they do not always inherit the group 
operation. If G is abelian, the natural multiplication of cosets is well defined, 
but if it isn't the subgroup H needs to be of a special kind, namely, a normal 
subgroup.

4.3 Number Systems 
In the previous section, an equivalence relation was used to construct a new 
number system from an old one: the relation on Z of congruence modulo n led to 
the construction of ZjnZ. We continue this theme now, but with the difference 
that the new systems we construct will be bigger than the old ones. In each 
case, the new system will contain the old one and will enjoy the advantage 
of containing the solutions to more equations than did the old one. We shall 
construct three number systems using Examples 8, 9, 10 from Section 1 in turn. 
Recall Example 8, where the equivalence relation rv is defined on N x N by 
(a, b) rv (c,d) {o}a+d=c+b. 
(4.4) 
The old number system here is N, and the new one consists of the equivalence 
classes [(a, b)] of this relation, which we will abbreviate to [a, b] for the sake of 
convenience. 
First notice that we can subtract any kEN from both a and b to get an 
equivalent pair, provided k < min(a, b): 
(a, b) rv (a - k,b - k). 
It follows that every class [a, b] contains a special pair, that is, one in which at 
least one of the components is equal to 1. Moreover, there is only one such pair 
in each class: 
(l,b) = (I,d):::} b = d, (a, 1) = (b, I):::} a = b, (a, 1) = (l,b):::} a = b = 1. 
The special pairs thus form a transversal, 
T={(1,n+1)lnEN}U{(1,1)}U{(n+1,1)lnEN}. 
(4.5) 
Next, attempt to define the addition of classes in a natural way: 
[a, b] + [c, d] = [a + c, b + d]. 
(4.6) 
As in the previous section, we need to check for independence of representatives 
(Exercise 4.20) in order that this operation be well defined. The effect of this 
operation on the members of T works out as follows. 
V(a,b)ENxN, [a,b]+[1,1]=[a+1,b+1]=[a,b] 
(4.7) 
so that [1,1] is an identity for this +. Next, 
[m + 1,1] + [n + 1, 1] 
[1,m+1]+[1,n+1] 
[m+n+2,2] = [(m+n)+l,l], 
[2, m + n + 2] = [1, (m + n) + 1]. 
(4.8) 

80 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
so that the first and last sets on the right-hand side of (4.5) both look like 
copies on N. Finally, 
[n + 1,1] + [l,n + 1] = [n + 2,n + 2] = [1,1], 
(4.9) 
so that [1, n + 1] is the additive inverse of [n + 1,1]. 
The set of equivalence classes forms a number system you may already 
recognize. It has the following properties: 
(a) its elements can be added (4.6), 
(b) it contains a copy of N (4.8), 
(c) it also contains an additive identity [1, 1] (4.7), 
(d) the remaining elements are the additive inverses of those in (b) (4.9). 
So the classes form the set Z of all integers, where we usually write 
[n+1,1]=n, 
[1,1] = 0, 
[1,n+1]=-n. 
This may seem like a lot of trouble to take just to construct familiar objects 
like negative integers. But bear in mind that the Ancient Romans had no zero, 
and negative numbers were beyond the scope of human intellect in medireval 
times. Their existence was in those days the cause of controversy, and belief 
in them required an act of faith. Thanks to set theory, that act of faith can 
now be replaced by an act of reason, as described above. There may be quicker 
ways of constructing Z, but the one we have just described is the cleanest. 
Z is a richer number system than N in the following sense. The equation 
x+b=a 
( 4.10) 
with a, bEN can be solved for x E N only when b < a. Allowing x E Z, it can 
be solved for all a, bEN: 
x = [a, b] = [a + 2, b + 2] = [a + 1,1] + [1, b + 1] = a-b. 
Moreover, since a - b has a meaning for all a, bE Z (by Exercise 4.21, -(-b) = 
b), (4.10) has a solution in Z for all a,b E Z. 
The set Z has more structure, namely, multiplication: 
[a, b] [c, d] = lac + bd, ad + be], 
(4.11) 
which, like addition, can be shown to be well defined. Under these two opera-
tions, Z forms a commutative ring-with-I. It is a routine calculation to check the 
eight axioms; some of these appear in the exercises. Finally, Z has no divisors 
of zero (Exercise 4.24), and so is an integral domain. 

4. Relations 
81 
We now turn to Example 9 in Section 1, which we treat in much the same 
way, but more briefly. The relation rv is defined on Z x N by 
(a, b) rv (e, d) {:? ad = eb. 
(4.12) 
First notice that if k is a common divisor of a and b (k E Z, k ~ 2), say 
a = ka' and b = kb', then 
(a, b) rv (a', b'). 
It follows that every class [a, b] contains a pair with coprime components. More-
over, there is only one such pair in each class: suppose that 
(a, b) f"V (e,d), that is, ad =cb, 
with a, b coprime and e, d coprime. Then it follows from the fundamental the-
orem of arithmetic (Theorem 1.17) that a = e and b = d. 
Next, attempt to define multiplication of classes in the natural way: 
[a,b] [e,d] = [ae,bd]. 
(4.13) 
As in the case of (4.6) above, this is independent of choice of representatives 
(Exercise 4.25). The following facts are then a matter for routine checking: 
(a) {[a, 1]1 a E Z} is a copy of the integers Z, 
(b) [1,1] is an identity for the multiplication (4.13), 
(c) if a> 0, [a, b] has a multiplicative inverse [b, a], and if a < 0, the inverse of 
[a, b] is [-b, -a], 
(d) the addition of classes is well defined by the rule 
[a, b] + [e, d] = [ad + eb, bd], 
(e) [0,1] = {(O, b) I bEN} is the additive identity, 
(f) [-a, b] is the additive inverse of [a, bj, 
(4.14) 
(g) the classes [a, b] have all the familiar properties of the rational numbers 
alb, a E Z, bEN, a and b coprime. 
The above process thus extends the integers Z to the rational numbers Q. 
Q is a field, and any equation ax = b with a, b E Q and a "# Â° has a solution 
XEQ. 
Finally, we turn to Example 10 in Section 1, where the analysis has points 
in common with that in Section 2 above. The relation f"V on lR[x] is defined by 
f(x) f"V g(x) {:? (x2 + 1) I (J(x) - g(x)). 
( 4.15) 

82 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
By the analogue for R[xJ of Euclid's theorem (Theorem 1.14), dividing any 
polynomial f(x) by x2 + 1 leaves a remainder r(x) of degree < 2: 
f(x) = (x2 + 1) q(x) + r(x). 
Thet). f(x) rv r(x) and every equivalence class contains a linear polynomial 
r (x) = a + bx, a, b E R Moreover, since the only multiple of x2 + 1 of degree 
less than 2 is the zero polynomial, no class can contain more than one such 
polynomial. It follows that the linear polynomials form a transversal for the 
classes, 
T = {a + bx I a, b E JR}. 
Classes can be added and multiplied in a natural way: 
[f(x)J + [g(x)J = [J(x) + g(x)], 
[J(x)J [g(x)] = [f(x) g(x)], 
(4.16) 
by means of the usual addition and multiplication of polynomials. The following 
facts can then be established: 
(a) the classes form a field under these operations, 
(b) the classes [aJ of constant polynomials a E JR form a copy of the real 
numbers JR, 
(c) the class [x] satisfies the equation 
[X]2 + [1] = [x2 + 1] = [0]' 
where [1], [0] are the multiplicative, additive identities respectively, 
(d) the classes [a + bx] have all the familiar properties of the complex numbers 
a + ib, a, bE R 
This process thus extends the reals JR to the field C of complex numbers. 
We saw earlier that any non-constant linear polynomial ax - b E Q[x], a =f- 0, 
has a zero x = b/a E Q. C has the vastly stronger property of algebraic 
closure: any non-constant polynomial f(x) E C[x] has a zero in C. This is the 
fundamental theorem of algebra; its proof is beyond our scope. 
Theorem 4.3 
The field C of complex numbers is algebraically closed. 
o 
Of all number systems, the richest are JR and <C. While <C has the advantage 
of algebraic closure, JR is superior in having a natural ordering: given a, b E JR, 
either a < b or a = b or a > b (more on this in the next section). This 

4. Relations 
83 
ordering is lost in the passage to C, and two further examples of such a loss 
are as follows. The complex numbers C can in turn be extended to a bigger 
system 1HI, the quaternions of Hamilton, but in the process the commutative 
law of multiplication is lost. Again, 1HI can be extended to the Cayley numbers 
A, but at the expense of the associative law of multiplication. As far as I know, 
the story ends here, and we have a nice chain of number systems, 
So far, we have said nothing about: 
(a) the extension of Q to lR, 
(b) the existence of N. 
( 4.17) 
Of course, you can't create something out of nothing, but in the case of (b) 
we can get away with remarkably little: the existence of N, its three elements 
of structure (+",:S;) and all their properties can be deduced from the three 
axioms of Peano, and this will be discussed in the next chapter. 
On the other hand, the construction of the reals lR from the rationals C is a 
non-trivial business, and was not convincingly managed until the last century. 
And then, surprisingly, it was achieved independently by two very different 
methods. The common feature of these methods is that they both employ 
partitions, and we describe the key to each of them now. 
First, the method of Dedekind sections constructs real numbers as par-
titions {A, B} of the rational numbers Q with the property that 
'iaEA,bEB 
a < b. 
( 4.18) 
Since this condition endows the pair A, B with an order, we shall denote this 
partition by (A, B). For example, for any e E Q the sets 
A = {q E Q I q :s; e}, 
B = {q E Q I q > c} 
form a partition of Q. SO do the sets 
C = {q E Q I q < e}, 
D = {q E Q I q?:. e}, 
and both of these partitions correspond to the rational number q. But if A 
has no largest element and B has no smallest element, the partition (A, B) 
corresponds to an irrational real number. It is clear that, for two partitions 
(A, B) and (C, D), A ~ C {=? B "2 D, and in this case we write (A, B) :s; (C, D). 
Addition and multiplication admit natural definitions in a similar way, and all 
the familiar properties of lR can be developed in a logical manner. Especially 
important in this context is the Dedekind property: every bounded set of 
real numbers has a least upper bound. 

84 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
The second method constructs real numbers as equivalence classes of 
Cauchy sequences. These are sequences ai, a2, ... , an, ... of rational num-
bers whose terms "eventually become arbitrarily close". More precisely, this 
means that 
'v'k E N:JN E N 
(4.19) 
or in English: no matter how small a positive rational number 11k you choose, 
there is some point (the Nth term) of the sequence beyond which any two terms 
differ by less than 11k. Such a sequence is said to be convergent to a limit 
I E Q if the terms get arbitrarily close to I in the same sense. A null sequence 
is a convergent sequence whose limit I = O. Finally, two Cauchy sequences are 
equivalent if they differ by a null sequence. The resulting equivalence classes 
then turn out to have all the structure and properties of the field lR of real num-
bers. Especially important in this context is the property of completeness: 
every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is convergent. 
As you might guess, the study of the real numbers belongs properly in 
analysis.

[an] of the sequence (an). 
4.4 Orderings 
Whereas equivalence relations may be the most useful type of relation, orderings 
are arguably the most fundamental. Orderings come in different strengths, and 
we define these now. 
Definition 4.3 
A partial ordering on a set S is a relation p on S with the following three 
properties: 
(R) p is reflexive, Va E Sap a, 
(0) fora,bES,apb/\bpa=>a=b, 
(T) p is transitive, for a, b, C E S, a p b /\ a p b => a p c. 
A partial ordering which satisfies the extra condition 
(L) Va,bESapbVbpa 
is called a total ordering (or a linear ordering). 
A partial ordering which satisfies the extra condition 
(W) every non-empty subset of S has a least element with respect to p, that 
is, 
01- A s::; S => 3l E A Va E Alp a, 
is called a well-ordering. 
Of the ten examples of relations given in Section 1, just three are partial 
orderings, namely, relations 2, 3, 4 of divisibility on Z, equality on S, ::; on lR re-
spectively. None of these (with the trivial exception of the second when lSI::; 1) 

86 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
satisfies either (L) or (W). More examples will be given shortly, but we first 
make some comments on these three definitions in a series of remarks. 
1 The superficial resemblance between the definitions of equivalence relation 
and partial ordering is misleading. These two types of relation have almost 
nothing in common (cf. Exercise 4.31). 
2 A relation p on a set S satisfying (R) and (T) is sometimes called a quasi-
ordering. 
3 Conspicuous in its failure to comply with our definition of partial order-
ing in the relation < on R This is merely a matter of convention (see 
Exercise 4.32): the relation 
a~b{=}a<bVa=b 
is a partial ordering on R 
4 The relation ~ is even a total ordering on JR (but not a well ordering). 
In terms of the relation <, this is equivalent to the law of trichotomy, 
which states that Va, b E JR, exactly one of the following three conditions 
holds: 
a < b, 
a = b, 
b < a. 
5 Condition (W) on a partial ordering p is genuinely stronger than condition 
(L): 
(W) =} (L) 
but not conversely in general (Exercise 4.33). 
6 The well-ordering principle mentioned in Chapter 1 merely asserts that the 
relation ~ is a well-ordering on N. 
7 The Axiom of Choice holds for well-ordered sets (see Exercise 4.35). Con-
versely, it follows from the Axiom of Choice that every set has a well-
ordering, but the proof of this fact is beyond our scope. 
8 Certainly, every finite set A can be well ordered. Simply list the elements 
of A in some order: al, a2,"" an, where n = IAI, and define ai ~ aj {=} i ~ 
j. 
We conclude this section with a brief discussion of some especially important 
examples of orderings of numbers and words. 
Prompted by Remark 3 above, define a partial ordering ~ on N in two 
stages as follows: 
a < b 
{=} 
3x E N a + x = b, 
a ~ b 
{=} 
a < b V a = b. 
(4.20) 

4. Relations 
87 
This can be extended in a natural way to partial orderings on Z and Q (Exer-
cise 4.36) and even lR (Exercise 4.38) in terms of the constructions described in 
the previous section. Neither Z nor the set of positive rationals is well ordered 
by this relation (Exercise 4.37). 
Given a finite set A, IAI = n E N say, a word in A is a string of symbols 
W = X1X2 .â¢. Xl with each Xi E A, 1 ~ i ~ l, that is, an element of Al with the 
brackets and commas omitted. l is called the length l (w) of w, and we allow the 
empty word e of length O. In this context, A is often referred to as an alphabet. 
Thus, the number of words of length l in A is nl for all l ;:::: O. As in Remark 8, 
listing the elements of A as al, a2, ... , an defines a well-ordering on A. 
The set W of all words in A can be well ordered in two different ways, of 
which the first is as follows. Given u, v E W, say 
u = Xl"'Xm , 
v = Yl'" Yn, 
(4.21 ) 
write u < v if either 
(a) at the first place from the left (say the ith) where u and v differ, Xi < Yi, 
or 
(b) there is no such place and m < n. 
Then u ::; v {::} u < v V u = v is called the lexicographic ordering on W. 
Another well-ordering on W is obtained by tampering with the previous 
definition as follows given u, v E W as in (4.21) write u < v if either 
(a) m < n, or 
(b) m = n and, at the first place (say the ith) where u and v differ, Xi < Yi, 
and again put u ~ v {::} u < v V u = v. This is called the shortlex ordering 
of W. This ordering plays a fundamental role in such areas as computer science 
and combinatorial group theory. 
EXERCISES 
4.31 What can you say about a relation p on a set S that is both a partial 
ordering and an equivalence relation?

a partial ordering on S. 
4.33 Let p be a partial ordering on S. Prove that: p satisfies (W) => P

natural orderings of the previous exercise. 
4.38 How might you extend the natural ordering from Q to lR using 
Cauchy sequences? 
4.39 Let W be the set of words in the alphabet A = {0,1}. Then the 
subset 
S = {Xl ... Xm E W 1m?: 1,Xl = 1} 
is just the set N of positive integers in binary notation. Compare the 
natural, lexicographic and short lex oderings on S. 
4.40 With A and W as in the previous exercise, and 
T = {Xl .. . Xm E W 1m?: 1,xm = 1}, 
the set .T = {.w I WET} is just the set of dyadic rationals in (0,1) 
in binary form. Compare the natural, lexicographic and shortlex 
orderings on .T.

Maps 
"He considered that the most important and necessary part 
of the study of geography was the drawing of maps ... " 
A. Chekhov 
The Teacher of Literature 
The third fundamental notion of set theory, after set itself and relation, is that 
of a map. Whereas a relation involves only one set and we speak of a relation 
on a set A, a map involves two and we speak of a map between sets A and B. 
The sets A and B here play different roles, and to emphasize this we often 
speak of maps from A to B. 
The word map has many synonyms including mapping, function, opera-
tion, transformation, operator and morphism, depending on the context. The 
French word for map is "application" and the German word is "Abbildung", 
and "mapping" is an accurate translation of the latter. 
5.1 Terminology and Notation 
Although the notion of map can, like that of relation, be defined in terms of 
more basic concepts (like subset and Cartesian product as below), both the 
traditional use and our intuitive perception of the word involve the idea of an 
action on the elements of one set to produce elements of another. 
Given set A and B, a map e from A to B is a rule that assigns to each 
element a E A an element of B, called the image of a under e and written 
e(a). It is customary to express this by writing 
e:A~B, 
D. L. Johnson, Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets

90 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
and to visualize 8 as an agent that acts on each element a E A to produce an 
element 8(a) E B. 
The set A is called the domain of e, and B the codomain. Given an 
equation e(a) = b with a E A and b E B, we sometimes refer to b as the value 
of e on a, and to a as an argument of e. The set of values of e on all a E A is 
a subset of B called the image of e, 
Ime = {b E B I 3a E A e(a) = b}. 
Two maps are said to be equal if they 
(a) have the same domain, 
(b) have the same codomain, and 
(c) take the same value on every element of the domain. 
Thus, if e : A ----+ Band Â¢ : C ----+ D are two maps, then 
e = Â¢ {=> (A = C) 1\ (B = D) 1\ (Va E A e(a) = Â¢(a)). 
(5.1) 
Given sets A' and B, a particular map 8 : A ----+ B is determined by its values 
8(a) Va E A. It is sometimes possible to specify 8 by writing 
8: A 
----+ 
B 
a 
f---4 
b, 
(5.2) 
where b E B is some expression depending on a that defines the value of e 
on a. Alternatively, e may be specified by listing the pairs (a, b) with e( a) = b 
Va E A, that is, by specifying the subset 
S = ((a, b) I b = e(a)} c:;; A x B. 
(5.3) 
Thus, a map from A to B can be thought of (and even defined) as a subset 
S c:;; A x B with the property that 
Va E A 31 b E B (a, b) E S, 
(5.4) 
whereupon the unique b is written 8(a) and called the value of eon a. 
While a subset of Ax B satisfying (5.4) can be used as the definition of the 
term "map from A to B", it is customary to take the definition given above, 
and to refer to the set S in (5.3) as the graph of e. 
Given two sets A and B, it is possible to consider all maps from A to B to-
gether as the elements of a third set, written Map( A, B). The old notation BA, 
now seldom used, for the set Map(A, B) is justified by the following fact. 

5. Maps 
91 
Theorem 5.1 
Let A and B be finite sets, so that IAI = a and IBI = b are non-negative 
integers. Then the cardinality of Map(A, B) is given by 
I Map(A,B)1 = ba . 
Proof 
A map 8 : A -+ B determines and is determined by its value on each element 
x E A. For each such x there are b possibilities for 8(x) and there are a such x's. 
So 8 is specified by making a choice of one out of b things (in b ways) a times 
independently. So the total number of maps is just ba . 
0 
Two maps 8 and Â¢ such that the domain of Â¢ coincides with the codomain 
of 8 can be combined to produce a third map Â¢8 (Â¢ 08 in some books) called 
the composite of 8 and Â¢ and defined as follows. If 8: A -+ Band Â¢ : B -+ C, 
then 
Â¢8:A-+C 
a 
~ Â¢(8(a)). 
This composition of maps is itself a map 
Map(A, B) x Map(B, C) -+ Map(A, C). 
Note that, because we are writing maps on the left of their arguments, Â¢8 is the 
result of applying 8 first, then Â¢. In many areas of algebra, maps are written 
on the right (so 8(x) is written x8) to avoid this difficulty. 
A very useful, but almost obvious, fact is as follows. 
Theorem 5.2 
Composition of maps is associative. 
Proof 
Let 8: A -+ B, Â¢: B -+ C, 'IjJ: C -+ D. 
Given a E A, put 
e(a) = b, 
Â¢(b) = c, 
'IjJ(c) = d. 
Then 
(Â¢8)(a) = c =} ('IjJ(Â¢8))(a) = 'IjJ(c) = d, 
and 
('IjJÂ¢)(b) = d =} Â«'IjJÂ¢)8)(a) = ('IjJÂ¢)(b) = d.

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
Since 'If;(Â¢0) and ('If;Â¢)0 have the same domain (A), the same codomain (D) 
and take the same value (d) on a for all a E A, these maps are equal.

For any set X, define the identity map on X by setting 
Ix: X

the map that fixes every element. Then it is clear that, for any map 0 : A -> B, 
Since we have identity maps in Map(A, B), it is natural to ask about the exis-
tence of inverses. Although this question cannot be answered fully until Section 
3 below, we can at least say something. 
Given a map 0 : A -> B, we can associate with any element b E B the 
set of those elements of A that take the value b under O. This set is called the 
pre-image of b under 0 and written 0-1(b), pronounced "O-inverse of b". Thus, 
Vb E B 
0-1(b) = {a E A I O(a) = b}. 
(5.5) 
The notatio~ 0-1(b) suggests that 0-1 is a map with domain B. But unless 
we are very lucky (see Section 3 below), the codomain of 0- 1 is not A. Equa-
tion (5.5) shows that the values of 0- 1 are actually subsets of A, whence the 
codomain of 0- 1 is the power set peA), 
0- 1 : B -> peA). 
(5.6) 
More generally, we can make the following definition: 
VY ~ B 0-1(y) = {a E A I O(a) E Y}, 
(5.7) 
of the pre-image of any subset Y ~ B. This delivers a map 
0- 1 : PCB) -> peA), 
(5.8) 
of which the map (5.6) is an important special case. The map in (5.8) will prove 
useful later on (Section 6.2 below). 
EXERCISES 
5.1 Give two reasons why "taking square-roots" is not a map from lR 
to lR. 
5.2 Why did we not define the image of 0 
A -> B more simply as 
{O(a) I a E A}? 

5. Maps

5.3 Let A = {a, b} and B = {I, 2, 3}. By describing their graphs, list the 
elements of Map(A, B). 
5.4 With A, B as in the previous exercise, list the elements of Map( B, A). 
5.5 For given sets A and B, our definition of "graph" shows that this is 
itself a map, call it ,. What are the domain, codomain and image 
of l'? 
5.6 Given non-empty sets A and B, describe Map(A, 0) and Map(0, B). 
What about Map(0,0)? 
5.7 Let 0: A --+ B, Â¢ : B --+ C be maps with graphs G, H respectively. 
Describe the graph K of Â¢O in terms of G and H. 
5.8 Given a map 0 : A --+ B, prove that the family 0-1(b), b ElmO, 
forms a partition of A. 
5.9 Let 0 : A --+ B be a map. Bearing in mind your solution to Exer-
cise 5.2 above, make a natural definition of a map 0: P(A) --+ P(B). 
To avoid awkwardness, a harmless abuse of notation is being com-
mitted here, as in formula (5.8) in the text. What is this abuse and 
what makes it harmless? 
5.10 Let 0 : A --+ B be a map and regard 0 and 0-1 as maps between 
power sets as in the previous exercise and formula (5.8) in the text, 
respectively. Of the four proposed laws 
\iX,Y~A 
\iX,Y ~ B 
O(X U Y) = O(X) U O(Y), 
O(X n Y) = O(X) n O(Y), 
0-1(X U Y) = 0-1(X) U 0-1(y), 
0-1(X n Y) = 0-1(X) n 0-1(y), 
exactly three are true. Find a counter-example in your solution to 
Exercise 5.3 that invalidates the false one.

5.2 Examples 
It is high time we had some concrete examples of maps. Since maps are very 
numerous (Theorem 5.1 above), we shall need to be selective, and so will choose 
examples to illustrate a number of important special types of map. We treat 
six of these in turn, and leave others as exercises. 
5.2.1 Inclusions 
These maps form a convenient way of expressing the containment of one set in 
another. If B is any set and A is any subset of B, then the map 
/.,(A,B): 
A 
-t B 
a 
f-; 
a 
(5.9) 
is called the inclusion of A in B. It is usual to write simply /., (or inc) for this 
map when the domain and codomain are clear from the context. 
For any A and B with A ~ B, there is just one inclusion /., : A -t B, even 
in the case when A = Â¢. At the other extreme, when A = B, the inclusion is 
just the identity map IE defined in the previous section. 
Suppose we have, in addition to the inclusion /., : A -t B, an arbitrary map 
e : B -t C. Since the codomain of /., and the domain of e are equal (to B), 
/., and e can be composed in accordance with the definition in the previous 
section. The resulting map e/., : A -t C is called the restriction of e to A, 
often written eiA. Changing the emphasis, let /., : A -t B be inclusion and 
Â¢ : A -> C a map. Then any map e : B -t C satisfying 8/" = Â¢ is called an 
extension of Â¢ to B. 
Now let A be any set and A x A its Cartesian square. While A x A cannot 
have A as a subset, it has a subset that looks very like A, namely the diagonal 
subset 
Ll = {(a, b) E A x A I a = b} = {(a, a) I a E A}. 
We can then define the diagonal map 
OA: 
A 
-t A x A 
a 
f-; 
(a, a), 
(5.10) 
which looks very like an inclusion. It shares with any inclusion /., the important 
property that distinct elements of the domain have distinct images under the 
map: 
for a, a' E A, 
a =1= a' =? /.,(a) =1= /.,(a'). 
(5.11) 

5. Maps 
95 
5.2.2 Natural Maps 
Like inclusions, these maps are of a very general kind. Let A be any set and rv 
any equivalence relation on A. Then (by Theorem 4.1) the equivalence classes 
are members of a partition of A, which is usually written Alrv, pronounced "A 
modulo tilde". AI rv is sometimes called the quotient set of A with respect 
to rv. Since every a E A belongs to exactly one equivalence class [a] E Alrv, 
there is a natural map 
v(A,rv): A 
--* 
Alrv 
a 
1-+ 
[a]. 
(5.12) 
The dependence on A and rv is often suppressed, and we merely write v (or 
nat) for this map. 
For example, take A to be Z and rv to be congruence modulo 6, so that 
Alrv is Z/6Z. Then the natural map 
v: Z --* Z/6Z 
assigns to each n E Z its residue class modulo 6. 
We conclude this subsection by giving an example of a map that looks very 
like a natural map. Given non-empty sets X and Y, there are obvious maps 
1f1: X x Y 
--* 
X, 
1f2: X x Y 
--* 
Y 
(x, y) 
1-+ 
x, 
(x, y) 
1-+ 
y, 
called projections onto the first and second components respectively. These 
maps share with any natural map v : A --* B the important property that their 
codomain and image coincide: 
Vb E B 3a E A 
v( a) = b. 
(5.13) 
5.2.3 Binary Operations 
We have seen examples of binary operations already, such as the addition of 
positive integers 
and the union of subsets 
NxN 
--* 
N 
( a, b) 
1-+ 
a + b 
P(S) x P(S) 
--* P(S) 
(A,B) 
1-+ 
AuB. 

96 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
In general, a binary operation on a set A is just a map 
(3 : A x A ---. A. 
The image of such a map is usually written in the form a * b, a, b E A, rather 
than (3(a, b), where * is the operation concerned, such as + (addition) and. 
(multiplication) when A is a number system, and U and n when A is a power set. 
5.2.4 Polynomial Maps 
The polynomials of elementary algebra are complicated objects. They are gen-
erally written in the form 
n 
f(x) = 'E Ckxk, 
(5.14) 
k=O 
where x is a "variable" or "indeterminate", the coefficients Ck are "constants", 
and n is a non-negative integer called the degree of f(x) provided Cn =I O. In 
the case when the coefficients Ck are allowed to range over the real numbers lR, 
the set of polynomials of the form (5.14), including 0, is usually written lR[x]. 
A polynomial f(x) E lR[x] and a real number a E lR together determine 
another real number, usually written f(a), obtained by substituting a for x in 
the right-hand side of (5.14): 
n 
f(a) = 'E ckak. 
k=O 
From this there arise two maps: 
(a) for a fixed a E lR, the substitution map 
ra: 
lR[x] 
---. 
lR 
f(x) 
~ f(a), 
which is important in number theory, and 
(b) for a fixed f(x) E lR[x], the polynomial map 
f: 
lR 
---. 
lR 
a 
~ f(a), 
. (5.15) 
which is important in analysis. 

5. Maps 
5.2.5 Pointwise Sum and Product 
Let A and B be sets, where B has a binary operation 
{3: BxB 
(b, b') 
97 
defined on it. Then given two maps e, Â¢ E Map(A, B), we get another map 
e * Â¢ E Map(A, B) by setting 
e*Â¢: A 
~ 
B 
a 
~ e(a) * Â¢(a). 
(5.16) 
We thus have a binary operation on Map(A, B) induced pointwise by the binary 
operation * on B, 
Map(A, B) x Map(A, B)~ Map(A, B) 
(e,Â¢) 
~ e*Â¢. 
Of particular importance here is the case A = B = JR, and it is usual to refer 
to maps e, Â¢ E Map(JR, JR) as functions. Then the addition and multiplication 
on JR induce pointwise addition and multiplication on Map(JR, JR): 
e+Â¢:JR 
~ lR 
e.Â¢: JR 
~ lR 
a 
~ e(a) + Â¢(a), 
a 
~ e(a)Â¢(a). 
Note that the notation e . Â¢ is used for the pointwise product to distinguish it 
from the composite eÂ¢ defined in the previous section. 
These concepts provide an alternative definition of polynomial maps, as 
follows. First, define a constant map on lR to be one of the form 
a 
~ c, 
where c is some fixed real number. (When c = Co, this is just the polynomial 
map f of (5.15) arising from f(x) in (5.14) when n = 0.) Next consider the 
"power maps" 
where n E N, obtained from the identity map 1n~ by iterated pointwise multi-
plication with itself (defined by induction on n). Then take pointwise products 
of these with constant maps and, finally, use iterated pointwise summation of 
the resulting maps to get the general polynomial map (5.15). In this sense, the 
polynomial maps are just the maps generated by 1]R and the constant maps 
under pointwise addition and multiplication. 

98 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
5.2.6 Elementary Functions 
These are the basic objects of study in calculus, and comprise: 
(a) the polynomial maps, 
(b) the trigonometric functions, 
(c) the exponential function, and 
(d) all maps generated under composition and pointwise addition, multiplica-
tion and division (where possible) by these and their inverses. 
It remains to say what the inverse of a map is. For example, the inverses 
of the maps (functions) x 2 , eX, sinx are Vx, logx, sin- 1 x, respectively. So 
"inverse" here means "inverse under composition of maps" , as described at the 
end of the last section. But calculus is concerned with maps: from JR to JR, not 
from JR to P(JR), and none of Vx, logx, sin- 1 x qualify as maps in this sense. 
The fundamental reason why this is so will be explained in the next section. 
EXERCISES 
5.11 Let A and B be sets with 0 =I A ~ B and ~ : A -4 B the corre-
sponding inclusion. Prove that there is a map 0- : B -4 A such that 
O-~ = lAo 
5.12 Let A be any set, '" any equivalence relation on A, Q = AI'" the 
corresponding quotient set, and v : A -4 Q the natural map. Assum-
ing the Axiom of Choice, prove that there is a map T : Q -4 A such 
that VT = 1Q. 
5.13 Let A, "', Q, v be as in the previous exercise, and A', "", Q', v' be 
defined similarly, and let 8 : A -4 A' be a map such that a '" b =} 
8(a) rv ' e(b) for a, bE A. Prove that there is a map 8' : Q -4 Q' such 
that e'v = v'8. 
5.14 Again let A, "', Q, v be as in Exercise 5.12, and let * be a binary 
operation on A. How might * be used to define a binary operation 
on Q? Find a condition on rv and * under which this is possible. 
5.15 In addition to ordinary addition and multiplication, at least six bi-
nary operations on N appear in Chapter 1. See how many you can 
remember (or find). 
5.16 Let I be the map (5.15) arising from (5.14). What can you say about 
1/- 1(0)1? 

5. Maps

5.17 Given two maps 0 : A -+ B, Â¢ : C -+ D, define their product by 
setting 
OxÂ¢: AxC -+ BxD

(O(a), Â¢(b)). 
In the case when A = C, B = D and there is a binary operation * 
on the latter set, write 0 * Â¢ as the composite of 0 x Â¢ with two other 
maps. 
5.18 Let A be a set with a binary operation *, so that the set Map(A, A) 
has two binary operations, * and composition defined on it. Write 
down four candidates for a distributive law and say which of them 
is true in general. 
5.19 What would be a good general name for a member of Map(N, JR)?

Express XAnB and XAL> B in terms of XA and XBÂ· 
5.3 Injections, Surjections and Bijections 
Two kinds of map are of special importance. They are the maps that share the 
property (5.11) of inclusions and the property (5.13) of natural maps, respec-
tively. We shall discuss each of these properties in turn, and then look at maps 
which enjoy them both. 
Definition 5.1 
Injections. A map 0 : A -+ B is said to be injective (or one-to-one, or an 
injection), if it takes distinct values on distinct elements of its domain: for 
a,a' E A, 
a i a' :=} O(a) i O(a'). 
(5.17) 
When checking for injectivity, it is often more convenient to verify the contra-
positive: for a, a' E A, 
O(a) = O(a') :=} a = a'. 
(5.18) 

100 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
It turns out that injections can be characterized in two useful ways: in 
terms of the subsets B-l(b) ~ A, and in terms of maps: B -; A. Since the 
single element of Map(0, B) is vacuously injective, we may assume that A f= 0. 
Theorem 5.3 
For B E Map(A, B), A f= 0, the following conditions are equivalent 
(a) B is an injection, 
(b) \:fb E B IB-1(b)1 ::; 1, 
(c) -::JÂ¢ E Map(B, A)Â¢B = 1A. 
Proof 
There are six assertions here, but in view of the transitivity of the relation =} 
it is sufficient to prove three of them. 
(a) =} (b). We shall prove the contrapositive. So suppose -::Jb E B IB-1(b)1 ?:: 2, 
say a,a' E B-l(b) with a f= a'. Then B(a) = B(a') = b, and so B is not an 
injection. 
(b) =} (c). By definition, 1m e = {b E B I e-1(b) f= 0}. Then \:fb E 1mB, e-1(b) 
is a singleton, {b'} say, b' E A. Since A f= 0, -::Jx E A. Then define 
Â¢: B -; A 
b 
f---t 
{ b' 
if b E 1m e, 
x 
ifbÂ¢Ime. 
Then \:fa E A, the single element B(a)' of B-l(e(a)) is obviously equal to a. 
Thus, 
\:fa E A, 
Â¢(B(a)) = B(a)' = a = 1A(a). 
(c) =} (a). Let Â¢ E Map(B, A) be such that Â¢e = 1A. Then \:fa, a' E A, 
B(a) = e(a') =} Â¢(e(a)) = Â¢(B(a')) =} a = a', 
and B is injective by (5.18). 
Definition 5.2 
o 
Surjections. A map B : A -; B is said to be surjective (or onto, or a surjec-
tion) if every element of B is the image under B of some element of A: 
\:fb E B -::Ja E A B(a) = b. 
(5.19) 

5. Maps 
101 
This might look very different from the condition (5.17) for an injection, but 
there is a parallel to be drawn between injections and surjections. This is il-
lustrated by the following characterizations of surjective maps, which closely 
parallel those in Theorem 5.3. 
Theorem 5.4 
For 0 E Map(A, B), the following conditions are equivalent: 
(a) 0 is a surjection, 
(b) Vb E B IO-l(b)1 21, 
(c) 3'lj; E Map(B, A) O'lj; = lB. 
Proof 
(a) =} (b). Let 0 be a surjection. Then it follows from (5.19) that Vb E B 
O-l(b) 1- 0, that is, 10-1(b)1 2 1. 
(b) =} (c). Assuming (b), there is an element of A, call it b', in 0-1(b) 
Vb E B. Then O(b') = b, and the map 'lj; : B --> A, b f-> b', has the property 
that 
O('lj;(b)) = O(b') = b = 1B(b), 
whence O'lj; = lB. (Did you spot our appeal to the Axiom of Choice here?) 
(c) =} (a). Assume (c) and let bE B. Since 
b = 1B(b) = O('lj;(b)) ElmO, 
o is surjective. 
o 
We end this subsection with a look at the important special cases when A 
or B (or both) is a finite set. 
Let A and B be sets and 0 E Map(A, B). When A is finite, say A = 
{all ... ,an}, the image of 0 consists of the distinct elements of the form O(ai), 
1 ~ i ~ n. But if 0 is injective, all these are different and 11m 01 = n. But if 0 
is not injective, at least two of them are equal and I 1m 01 < n. Thus, when A 
is finite, 
o is injective <=> I ImOI = IAI. 
(5.20) 
Now let B be finite. If 0 is surjective, then 1m 0 = B and so 11m 01 = IBI. 
But if 0 is not surjective, 1m 0 c B and 11m 01 < IBI. Thus, when B is finite, 
o is surjective <=> 11m 01 = IBI. 
(5.21) 

102 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
When A and B are both finite, it follows from (5.20) and (5.21) that any 
two of the assertions 
8 is injective, 8 is surjective, IAI = IBI 
imply the third. There is a special case of this that is particularly useful; the 
proof is obvious. 
Theorem 5.5 (pigeonhole principle) 
If A and B are finite sets with IAI = IBI and 8 E Map(A, B), then 
8 is injective {::? 8 is surjective. 
Definition 5.3 
Bijections. A map 8 : A -+ B is called a bijection if it is both injective and 
surjective. 
Such maps are particularly important, as we hope to demonstrate now. 
Given a bijection 8 : A -+ B, let Â¢, 'IjJ E Map(B, A) be as guaranteed by 
Theorems 5.3(c), 5.4(c). Then, using associativity of map composition 
'IjJ = IA'IjJ = (Â¢8)'IjJ = Â¢(8'IjJ) = Â¢IB = Â¢, 
and we have 
(5.22) 
In this situation, it makes sense to call Â¢ the inverse of 8 and to write Â¢ = 8- 1. 
Note that it follows from the symmetry of equations (5.22) that the inverse Â¢ 
of 8 is also a bijection. 
The relation of this 8- 1 to the 8- 1 : B -+ peA) at the end of Section 1 
needs some explaining. There is ambiguity here, but not much. For a given 
bijection e : A -+ B, we deduce from Theorems 5.3(b) and 5.4(b) that Vb E B 
le- 1(b)1 = 1, that is, e- 1(b) is a singleton. The new e- 1(b) is thus equal to the 
single element in the old e- 1(b). Note that we have reserved use of the word 
"inverse" for the new e- 1 only. 
The argument leading to (5.22) proves half of the following theorem. The 
other half follows from the assertions (c) =} (a) in Theorems 5.3 and 5.4. 
Theorem 5.6 
A map e : A -+ B has an inverse if and only if it is a bijection. 
o 

5. Maps 
103 
Bijections from a set to itself have a special name: they are called permu-
tations. Given a set A, we write 
Sym(A) = {O E Map(A, A) lOis bijective} 
for the set of all permutations of A. The origin of the notation "Sym" will be 
explained in a moment. 
Theorem 5.7 
For any set A, Sym(A) forms a group under composition of maps. 
Proof 
We check the axioms for a group in turn. 
First, composition really is a binary operation; that is, the composite f)</J of 
bijections 0, </J E Sym(A) is indeed a bijection: 
(O</J)(</J-lf)-l) = f)(</J</J-l)B-l = f)O-l = lA, 
by the associativity of map composition. Thus, f)</J has an inverse, </J-lf)-l E 
Sym(A, A), and so is a bijection by Theorem 5.6. 
Next, the associative law (which has already been used) is guaranteed by 
Theorem 5.2. 
Finally, the identity is obviously lA, and inverses exist by Theorem 5.6 
again. 
o 
In virtue of this theorem, we can refer to Sym(A) as the symmetric group 
on Aj this is traditional terminology among group theorists. When A is finite, 
say IAI = n E N, Sym(A) is called the symmetric group of degree n, and 
often written Sn, especially when A = {k E Z 11 ~ k ~ n}. 
EXERCISES 
5.21 Let A = {a, b}, B = {I, 2, 3} as in Exercise 5.3. How many elements 
of Map(A, B) are injections? How many are surjections?

Map(B, A) are surjections? How many are injections?

(iii) a bijection?

5.4 Peano's Axioms 
We briefly postpone further study of bijections in order to describe the wonder-
fully economical axioms of Peano for the fundamental number system N. Given 
only three simple elements of structure satisfying only three simple axioms, it is 
possible to deduce all the familiar properties of N, that is, all the laws satisfied 
by the two binary operations (+ andÂ·) and the ordering (~). The problem 
of getting the Principle of Mathematical Induction is solved by default: it is 
included among the axioms. 
Postulate 1 
There exists a set N, an element 1 E N and a map (J" : N --) N, (J"(a) = a*, 
such that the following three conditions hold: 
PI. (J" is an injection, 
P2. 1 Â¢ 1m(J", 
P3. if a subset X of N contains 1, and a* E X whenever a E X, then X = N. 
A few comments are appropriate. First note that, since (J" is injective but 
not surjective, it follows from the pigeon-hole principle (Exercise 5.36) that N 
is not a finite set: once +, " and ~ have been defined on it, N will later become 
the familiar set N of positive integers. Next, the distinguished element 1 will 
later turn out to be the identity with respect to . and also the smallest element 
of N with respect to ~. Finally, axiom P3 is recognizable as the PM1; it will be 
used to make definitions and prove theorems in what follows. As an example of 
how it is applied, we begin with the following useful little lemma. (A lemma is 
a proposition that is of little interest in itself but useful in proving subsequent 
theorems.) 
Lemma 5.1 
1 is the only element of N that is not in 1m (J". 
Proof 
The subset X = {I} U Im(J" ~ N contains both 1 and the image a* = (J"(a) 
of every a E N, whence of every a E X. It follows from P3 that X = N, as 
required.

Armed with this tool, we now embark on the development of the structure 
of N.

Addition. We define a binary operation + on N by the rules 
Theorem 5.8 
AI. 
Va E N 
A2. 
'ia,b EN, 
a + 1 = a*, 
a+b* = (a+b)*. 
The operation + is well defined throughout N. 
Proof 
There are two things to be proved here: 
(a) Va, bEN at least one meaning can be attached to a + b, 
(b) Va, bEN at most one meaning can be attached to a + b, 
and we treat these in turn. 
(a) establishes the "throughout" and is proved as follows. Let 
x = {b EN I a + b has a meaning Va EN}. 
Then 1 E X by AI. Also, b E X '* b* E X by A2. It follows from P3 that 
X = N, as required. 
(b) asserts that + is unique, that is, it is the only binary operation on N 
satisfying Al and A2. This is proved by contradiction as follows. Let 0 be 
another binary operation on N that satisfies Al and A2, and put 
X = {b E N I aD b = a + b Va EN}. 
Then by AI, aD 1 = a* = a + 1, so 1 EX. Next, it follows from A2 that 
b E X '* a + b = aD b Va E N 
'* (a+b)*=(aob)*VaEN 
'* a + b* = aD b* Va E N '* b* E X. 
It now follows from P3 that X = N, whence a + b = aD b Va, bEN. This 
contradiction proves the uniqueness of +.

All assertions are proved in the same fashion: define a suitable set X, prove 
that 1 EX, prove that b EX:::} b* EX, and deduce from P 3 that X = N. The 
assertion then follows, either by contradiction or otherwise. The proof of the 
associative law (Exercise 5.37) is typical, while the commutative law requires 
two steps (Exercises 5.38 and 5.39) and is a kind of double induction; the 
cancellation law (Exercise 5.40) is an extension of axiom PI. 
Theorem 5.9 
The binary operation + on N obeys the following laws: 
(a) (a+b)+c=a+(b+c), 
(b) a + b = b + a, 
(c) a+c=b+c:::}a=b. 
Proof 
(a) Take X = {c EN I (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) Va, bEN}. 
(b) First take X = {a E N I a + 1 = 1 + a}, then Y = {b E N I a + b = 
b + a Va EN}. 
(c) Take X = {c EN I the map a t--; a + c on N is an injection}.

is another recursive definition, and an analogue (Exercise 5.41) of Theorem 5.8 
is required. The proofs of the distributive law forÂ· over +, and ofthe associative, 
commutative and cancellation laws for . are consigned to the exercises. 
Theorem 5.10 
The following laws hold in N: 
(a) a(b+c) = ab+ac, 
(b) a(bc) = (ab)c,

(c) ab = ba, 
(d) ac = bc =} a = b.

Definition 5.6 
Ordering. We define a relation < on N by setting 
a < b {:? ::I x E N 
a + x = b. 
It is then natural to write, for a, bEN, 
a :s: b {:? a < b V a = b. 
The latter relation turns out to be a partial ordering on N and (just for a 
change) we give a proof of this fact. 
Theorem 5.11 
The relation :s: is a partial ordering on N. 
Proof 
According to the definition in Section 4.4, we must prove that 
(a) Va E N a :s: a, 
(b) a:S: b 1\ b :s: a =} a = b, 
( c ) a:S: b 1\ b :s: c =} a :s: c. 
First, (a) is obvious: Va E N a = a =} a < a V a = a =} a :s: a. For (c) 
observe that if either a = b or b = c or both, the conclusion coincides with one 
or both of the two premises, and the implication is trivial. There remains the 
case when a < band b < c. Then ::Ix, yEN a + x = b 1\ b + y = c, and we have 
c = b + y = (a + x) + y = a + (x + y) 
by the associative law, whence a < c, which implies a :s: c, as required. 
Turning to (b), assume that a :s: b 1\ b :s: a 1\ a =f. b and look for a 
contradiction. Since a =f. b, we have 
a < b 1\ b < a 
=} 
::Ix, yEN a + x = b 1\ b + y = a

which contradicts axiom P2.

Just as + andÂ· are related to each other by a law (the distributive law), they 
are each related to :::;. These relations take the form of implications resembling 
cancellation laws and their proof is left to the exercises. 
Theorem 5.12 
For a, bEN, the following are equivalent: 
(a) a < b, 
(b) 'Ve EN a + e < b + e, 
(c) 3e E N a + e < b + e. 
Theorem 5.13 
For a, bEN, the following are equivalent: 
(a) a < b, 
(b) 'Ve EN ae < be, 
(c) 3e E N ae < be. 
Finally it turns out that :::; is in fact a well-ordering on N, and we end this 
chapter with a proof. This will require three preliminary facts, which we collect 
into a theorem. Further properties of :::; are to be found in the exercises. 
Theorem 5.14 
(a) 'Va EN 1 :::; a. 
(b) 'Va, bEN a < b or a = b or b < a. 
(c) 'Vb E N ~a E N b < a < b*. 
Proof 
(a) It follows from the lemma that 'Va E N either a = lor a = O'(b) = b* = b+1 
for some bEN, and then 1 < a. 
(b) Put A = {b E N I 'Va E N a < b or a = b or b < a}. Then 1 E A by 
part ( a). Let b E A and a EN, so that a < b or a = b or b < a. In the first 
case, a < b < b* and in the second a = b < b*. In the third case, a = b + x 
and we distinguish two subcases. Either x = 1, when a = b*, or x =J 1. In 
the second subcase, it follows from part (a) that x = y+ 1 for some YEN. 
Then, using results already proved, 
a = b + x = b + y + 1 = b + 1 + y = b* + y > b*. 
It follows in every case that b* E A, whence A = N, as required. 

110 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
(c) Suppose, for a contradiction that b < a < b*. Then b* = a+x and a = b+y, 
whence 
b + 1 = b* = a + x = b + y + x => 1 = y + x, 
by Theorem 5.9(c). Then x < 1, which contradicts part (a). 
Theorem 5.15 
The relation :S is a well-ordering on N. 
Proof 
Let A ~ N with A =J 0 and define 
B = {b EN I b:S a Va E A}. 
o 
We claim that B n A contains just one element, and this is the required least 
element of A. Since B n A cannot contain more than one element (Theorem 
5.11(b)), we only need to prove that An B =J 0 
Since A =J 0, :Ja E A. Then a < a*, so that a* ~ B. Thus B =J N. By 
contra posing axiom P3 we must have either 
1 ~ B or :Jb E B b* ~ B. 
But 1 E B by Theorem 5.14(a). Thus we have abE B with b* ~ B. Then 
3a E A with rv(b* :S a), that is, a < b*, by Theorem 5.14(b). Since b E B, we 
then have b:S a < b*. It follows from Theorem 5.14(c) that a = b E AnB, and 
this element is the required least element of A.

"The controversial topic of M engenlehre (theory of sets, or classes, 
particularly of infinite sets) created in 1874-95 by Georg Cantor 
(1845-1915) may well be taken, out of its chronological order, 
as the conclusion of the whole story." 
E. T. Bell 
Men of Mathematics 
Anyone who can count has some idea of the meaning of the word "number", at 
least in relation to the elements of a finite set. Thus, we have a clear conception 
of what is meant by saying that the number of deadly sins, days of Christmas, 
steps is 7, 12, 39 respectively. We have already capitalized on this intuition to 
gain understanding of operations on sets. For example, Exercises 3.20. 3.23, 
3.24 and Theorems 3.3, 5.1 respectively assert that if A, B are finite sets with 
IAI = a, IBI = b, then

It is the aim of this chapter to extend the idea of cardinality to infinite sets. 
The result is an attractive theory that accords well with intuition, although 
there are some surprises, pleasant and otherwise, along the way.

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
6.1 Cardinal Arithmetic 
Let A and B be two arbitrary sets. Then we say that A and B are equivalent 
(or similar, or equipotent) if there is a bijection 8 : A -; B, and then we write 
A '" B. It is easy to check that the formal properties of an equivalence relation 
hold for "', as follows. 
(R) A rv A via the bijection lA. 
(8) If 8 : A -; B is a bijection, it has an inverse 8- 1 : B -; A by Theorem 5.6. 
It is clear from the definition of inverse that (8- 1) -1 = B, so B-1 is also a 
bijection, again by Theorem 5.6. 
(T) If B : A -; B, Â¢ : B -; C are bijections, then so is the composite Â¢8 : A -; 
C, as it has inverse: (Â¢B)-l = B-1Â¢-1. 
It would be nice to be able to say at this point that '" is therefore an 
equivalence relation. Then we could define IAI as the rv-class of the set A, 
and cardinality as the natural map assigning IAI to A, and we would have a 
definition of the concept of number in terms of the concept of set. It would then 
be possible to deduce properties of numbers, even infinite ones, from properties 
of sets, and so gain some understanding of the infinite. Well, this is more or 
less what happens. There is, however, a potentially dangerous obstacle in our 
path. We shall describe it now, and indicate how to get around it. 
80 why can't we say that equivalence of sets is an equivalence relation? It 
has the required properties (R), (8), (T) all right, and for any two sets A, B 
the set Map(A, B) either contains a bijection or it does not. The problem is 
that a relation has to be defined on a set, which in this case would appear to 
be the "set S of all sets". Now the "set" S would not only be truly enormous, 
but would also have the rather disturbing property of being a member of itself: 
S E S. This is not only suspicious but altogether out of court. All right then, 
what about the "set n of all sets that are not members of themselves"? First 
check whether n is a member of itself or not: 
n En=} n is not a member of itself: n rJ. n. 
This contradiction proves that n rJ. n, but then 
n rJ. n =} n is a member of itself: n E n, 
which is another contradiction. This rotten state of affairs is known as Rus-
sell's paradox. The consequence is that objects such as nand S, if they exist 
at all, cannot reasonably be thought of as sets. 
To get around this we shall have to make an assumption (or hypothesis or 
postulate). Such an hypothesis was framed by Cantor as follows. 

6. Cardinal Numbers 
115 
Postulate 2 
For every set A there exists an object IAI, called the cardinal number (or 
cardinality) of A, with the property that for any two sets A, B 
IAI = IBI {::} there is a bijection: A ---t B. 
This assertion can be justified by letting IAI be the smallest set, in some 
sense, that is equivalent to A. The idea of ordering thus enters the picture, 
and there is a coherent theory of ordinal types and ordinal numbers whereby 
the word "smallest" can be given a precise meaning in this context. Since that 
theory is beyond our scope, we shall simply accept Cantor's postulate as a true 
statement and get back to work. 
Thinking of cardinals as numbers, we would like to operate on them in 
a manner consistent with familiar usage in the finite case. Thus the addi-
tion, multiplication and exponentiation of cardinals are defined by formu-
lae (6.1), (6.2) and (6.5) above. For example, to define the product of cardinals a 
and b, take sets A, with IAI = a, IBI = b and put ab = IA x BI. Similarly for 
the sum of a and b, where the condition of disjointness is easily assured (Exer-
cise 6.1). Note that (6.3) and (6.4) are both special cases of (6.5). Finally, it has 
to be checked that these operations are well defined. This is a straightforward 
business and is consigned to the exercises. 
Thrning to the question of universal laws for cardinal arithmetic, some of 
these, such as the associative and commutative laws, are almost obvious. Others 
are consequences of bijections established in previous chapters. For example, 
Exercises 3.25 and 5.33-5.35 result in the following facts: 
e x (Au B) 
P(AU B) 
Map(A U B, e) 
Map(A x B, e) 
(exA)U(exB), 
peA) x PCB), 
Map(A, e) x Map(B, e), 
Map(A, Map(B, e)). 
(6.6) 
(6.7) 
(6.8) 
(6.9) 
Letting IAI = a, IBI = b, lei = c, we get the familiar distributive law and laws 
of indices: 
c(a + b) 
ca + cb, 
(6.10) 
2a+b 
2a2b, 
(6.11) 
ca+b 
cacb, 
(6.12) 
cab 
(cb)a, 
(6.13) 
where (6.11) is a special case of (6.12). All these laws are extensions of the 
corresponding ones for finite sets, and the latter can be accepted intuitively or

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
deduced as in Section 5.4 from the Peano axioms. To complete this picture, it 
would be nice to extend the usual ordering :::; from finite to infinite cardinals, 
and this is done as follows. 
Given cardinal numbers a = IAI, b = IBI, we shall write a :::; b if there is an 
injection 0: : A -t B. To show that this coincides with the usual definition on 
finite cardinals is an easy exercise. To establish the formal conditions (R), (0), 
(T) for a partial ordering is, however, not quite so simple. 
(R) Given a = IAI, the injection lA guarantees that a :::; a. 
(0) The deduction of a = b from a :::; band b :::; a is not trivial and forms the 
subject of the next section. 
(T) Given a = IAI, b = IBI, c = 101 and injections 
0:: A -t B, 
/3:B-tC 
the composite /30: : A -t C is an injection, whence 
a :::; b :::; c =} a :::; c. 
We conclude this section with an important and useful theorem. The proof, 
though somewhat redolent of Russell's paradox, is both elegant and valid. The 
idea is to compare, for any set A, the cardinals IAI and IP(A)I. First, it is clear 
that the mapping 
a: A 
-t P(A) 
a 
t---+ 
{a} 
is an injection, so IAI :::; P(A), that is, a :::; 2a for any cardinal a. A potentially 
infinite sequence of infinite cardinals would then be guaranteed if we could 
prove that this equality is strict, and this is done as follows. 
Theorem 6.1 
For any set A, IAI < IP(A)I. 
Proof 
Assume that IAI = IP(A)I and look for a contradiction. We thus have a bijection 
"/ : A -t P(A) 
assigning to any a E A a subset ,,/(a) <;;; A. Now any a E A either belongs to its 
image ,,/(a) or does not. So define the subset 
B = {a E A I a ~ ,,/(a)} <;;; A.

Since B E P(A) and {is a surjection, there is an element b E A with {(b) = B.

b~B, and

by the defining property of B in each case. This contradiction proves that no 
such bijection can exist.

6.2 The Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem 
This section is devoted to the deferred proof of property (0) for cardinal num-
bers. The statement is simple and the proof is elegant. The result is historically 
important and useful in practice. It thus has all the hallmarks of a top-class 
named theorem. 
Theorem 6.2 (Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein) 
Let A, B be sets and 
8:A->B, 
Â¢:B->A 
injections. Then A rv B. 
Proof 
By regarding 8 and Â¢ as maps between P(A) and P(B), we shall construct a 
subset U of A such that Â¢ maps 8(U)' surjectively onto U'. It will then follow 
from Exercise 6.4 that A rv B. 
First, extend the domain of 8 to P(A) by setting, for X ~ A, 
8(X) = {8(x) I x E X} ~ B. 
Similarly, for X ~ B let 
Â¢(X) = {Â¢(x) I x E X} ~ A. 
For the body of the proof we shall regard 8 and Â¢ in this way as maps between 
P(A) and P(B). Note that these maps preserve inclusions in an obvious sense. 
By contrast, the complementation maps 
a: 
P(A) 
X 
-> 
P(A) 
f--+ 
A\X, 
j3: 
P(B) 
X 
-> 
P(B) 
f--+

6. Cardinal Numbers 
119 
clearly reverse inclusions. 
Next, and this is the crucial construction, form the composite map w 
P(A) --4 P(A) by: 
(a) passing from P(A) to P(B) using 0, 
(b) taking the complement in B, 
(c) returning to P(A) via cp, and 
(d) taking the complement in A. 
Thus, w is the map: P(A) --4 P(A) given by 
w = acp(30, 
which, by earlier remarks, preserves inclusions. 
Now consider the family 
F = {X E P(A) I X ~ w(X)}. 
For example, 0 E F always, but A E F only when 0 is surjective. All the 
members of F are subsets of A, and therefore so is their union: 
u= U X~A. 
XEF 
N ow watch carefully. For every X E F we have 
X ~ w(X) and X ~ u. 
Since w preserves inclusions, it follows that 
X ~ w(X) ~ w(U), 
that is, every member of F is contained in w(U) and so, therefore, is their 
union, 
U ~ w(u). 
Since w preserves inclusions, we have 
w(U) ~ w(w(U)), 
that is, w(U) E F, and so w(U) ~ U, by definition of U. Thus, U = w(U) and 
we have 
a(U) = a(w(U)) = (cp(30)(U), 

120 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
The final step in the proof is the interpretation of this formula. It says that 
U' <:;;; A is the image under Â¢ of (}(U)' <:;;; B. So we have found partitions 
A = UUU', 
B = (}(U) U (}(U)' 
such that U is mapped bijectively to (}(U) by () and (}(U)' is mapped bijectively 
to U' by Â¢. Then the map assigning to x E U its image under () and to x fj. U 
its pre-image under Â¢ is the desired bijection from A to B.

6.3 Countable Sets 
We now know that any set S of cardinals is partially ordered by the relation :S. 
A natural question to ask is whether this is a total ordering on S: given a, bE S, 
can we assert that either a :S b or b :S a? The answer is provided by the famous 
theorem of Zermelo, which asserts even more: any such S is well ordered by :S. 
While the proof of this is beyond both our scope and needs, we shall derive the 
important special case (Theorem 6.3 below) that any cardinal is comparable 
with the cardinal No of the set N of positive integers. But first, a definition. 
Definition 6.1 
A set A is called countable if IAI :S No, that is, there is an injection a: A ---> N. 
In the special case when Ima contains (a) the element 1, (b) no gaps, and (c) 
a maximal element, this corresponds precisely with our intuitive understanding 
of what it means to count the elements of A. Given any injection a : A ---> N, 
properties (a) and (b) can be easily assumed by a process of "compression", so 
we assume them and concentrate on (c), which mayor may not hold for our 
given a. These two cases are treated separately, as follows. 
In the former case, when (c) holds, let a be maximal in Ima. Then Ima = 
{I, 2, ... ,a} and it makes sense to say that IAI = a. Then there can be no 
injection from N to A (see Section 5.3), and we can write IAI < No. In this case, 
which includes the trivial case when A = 0 (a = 0), we say that the set A and 
its cardinal a are finite. 
Now suppose that (c) fails, so that 1m a has no maximal element Then 1m a 
satisfies the requirements of Peano's axiom P3 and we deduce that Ima = N. 
Then a is a bijection and IAI = No. In this case, we say that the set A and its 
cardinallAI = a are countably infinite. (In some books, the term "countable" 
refers only to this case.) 
Finally, let A be an uncountable set, that is, a set for which there is no 
injection into N. Then A :f. 0 and ::Ix E A. Now consider the proposition:

IAnl = n. 
Then P(I) is true: take Al = {xI} where Xl = X. Now let n > 1 and assume 
P(n -1): 
Since there is no injection from A into N, it follows that An- l :f. A, that is, 
A \ An- l :f. 0. Then pick Xn E A \ An- 1 and put An = An- l U {xn}. Then 
IAnl = nand P(n) is established. By the PMI, P(n) is true \In E N. We have

thus shown that n :s; IAI 
Vn E N. But the above construction actually proves 
something more. Since the sets An form a chain, An ~ An+! Vn E N, their 
union U = U An is a set {xn I n E N} of cardinality No. It follows that 
nEN 
No < IAI in this case, which completes the proof of the following theorem. 
Theorem 6.3 
Any cardinal a satisfies exactly one of the following three conditions: 
a < No, 
a = No, 
a> No, 
that is, a is finite, countably infinite, or uncountable. 
o 
We know from the definition that among the cardinalities of countable 
sets No is the largest. From this theorem it follows that among the cardinalities 
of infinite sets, No is the smallest. We will come across some bigger ones in the 
next section. 
In the rest of this section, we shall discuss properties of countable cardi-
nals and, in particular, what happens when we start adding and multiplying 
them together. The main emphasis will be on countably infinite sets, and cases 
involving finite sets will largely be left to the exercises. We shall prove three 
major theorems. The first of these has the consequence that 
IZI = NoÂ· 
Theorem 6.4 
The union of two disjoint countable sets is countable. In particular,

Since () is an injection, so is "pIA, for 
2()(x) = 2()(y) :::} ()(x) = ()(y) :::} x = y. 
Similarly, "pIB is an injection. Moreover, the values of "pIA are all even and the 
values of "pIB are all odd, so that 1m "pIA n 1m "pIB = 0. Thus, "p is an injection. 
In the special case when A and B are disjoint count ably infinite sets, we 
deduce that IA U BI :$ ~o. Since Au B is obviously not finite, it follows from 
Theorem 6.3 that IA U B\ = No, which proves (6.15).

We now focus attention on the Cartesian product of two countably infinite 
sets. Since the multiplication of cardinals is well defined (Exercise 6.5), it is 
sufficient to consider the set N x N = N2 . The next theorem has the consequence 
that 
IQI =No. 
(6.16) 
Theorem 6.5 
The Cartesian product of two countably infinite sets is countably infinite, that 
is, 
No' No = No. 
(6.17) 
Proof 
We have to count pairs (k, l) of positive integers, and we do this in accordance 
with the lexicographic ordering of the corresponding pairs (k + l, l). This is 
illustrated in Fig. 6.5, where the integer assigned to (k, l) occupies the usual 
position of (k, l) in the positive quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

To be more specific, let 
An = {(k,l) I k+l = n}, 

124 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
n = 2,3,4, ... , so that IAnl = n - 1. Next put 
n 
so that IUnl = ~(n - l)n = Un, say, n 2 2. The integer thus assigned to the 
pair (k, l), where k + 1= n, is then given by 
a(k,l) = Un-l + I. 
(6.18) 
This defines a map a : N2 ~ N, which we claim is an injection. 
To prove this, let (k, I), (kf, If) E N2 and assume that a(k, I) = a(k', I'), 
that is, 
Un-l + [ = Um-l + If, 
(6.19) 
where n = k + I and m = kf + [f. There are two cases to consider. If m = n, 
then I = If by (6.19), and so k = n - I = m - If = k', whence (k, I) = (kf, If) 
as required. If m =I- n, we may assume by symmetry that m < n. Then, since 
If < m, 
Un-l + I = Um-l + I' < Um-l + m = 
U m + 1 :::; Un-l + 1 :::; Un-l + l. 
This contradiction shows that the case m =I- n cannot arise. The assump-
tion (6.19) thus forces (k, I) = (kf, If), and a is an injection, as claimed. 
We have shown that ~5 :::; ~o. Since N2 is obviously not a finite set, it follows 
from Theorem 6.3 that ~5 = ~o.

The final theorem in this section is used often and widely in pure mathe-
matics. We prove it now as a consequence of Theorem 6.5. 
Theorem 6.6 
A countable union of countable sets is countable. 
Proof 
Let the sets be Ai, i E I, where each Ai is countable and so is I. Thus there 
are injections 
Bi : Ai ~ N, i E I, and Â¢ : I ~ N. 
We obtain pairwise disjoint copies of the Ai by putting 
for each i E I. These are copies (in the sense that Ai '" Ai \Ii E I) since every Bi 
is an injection, and pairwise disjoint because Â¢ is an injection. 

6. Cardinal Numbers 
125 
We will now define a map 
0' : A = U Ai ---4 A = U Ai. 
iEI 
A typical element a E A has the form a = (Bi(a), Â¢(i)) for some i E I, a E Ai. 
Then put O'(a) = a E Ai ~ A. Since every a E A belongs to Ai for some i E I, 
we have a = O'((Bi(a), Â¢(i))), and 0' is a surjection. By the Axiom of Choice, the 
partition {a-l(a) I a E A} of A has a transversal T. Then the map 7: A --> A 
with 7(a) = li, where Tn O'-l(a) = {a}, has the property 0'7 = lA, and 7 is 
thus an injection from A to a subset A of N2. It follows from the transitivity 
of::; that IAI ::; N6 , and then by the previous theorem that A is countable, as 
required.

6.4 Uncountable Sets 
The existence of uncountable sets has already been foreshadowed in Theo-
rem 6.1: the power set peN) is uncountable. Most of this section will be devoted 
to the study of this enormous set. 
We begin by recalling (Exercise 5.20) one method of calculating the cardi-
nality ofP(B) when B is a finite set. Let B = {k E N 11::; k::; n}, n E N, and 
suppose A ~ B. Then we define the characteristic function of A as follows: 
XA: B ~ 
X 
I--t 
71./271. = {O, I} 
{ I 
if x E A, 
o if x ~ A. 
(6.20) 
Since the map X : P (B) -+ Map( B, 71./271.), A 1-+ XA, is a bijection (easy exer-
cise), we deduce that I(P(BÂ»I = 2n. In exactly the same way, we get a bijection 
X: 
peN) ~ Map(N,71./271.) 
A 
I--t XA, 
(6.21) 
with XA(X) defined as in (6.20). 
The map XA is traditionally thought of as a sequence, or "infinite string" , 
of zeros and ones, namely an expression of the form 
(6.22) 
where an = XA(n), n E N, and the "." at the start is called the binary point. 
For example, if A = E = 2N, the set of even numbers, then 
PE = .0101. .. anÂ· .. , 
(6.23) 
where an is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd. Similarly, if A = 0 = 1 + 2N, the 
set of odd numbers, then 
Po = .1010 ... an ... , 
(6.24) 
where an is 0 if n is even and 1 if n is odd. The alternating strings (6.23), (6.24) 
are often abbreviated to .Oi, .i6 respectively, and are examples of recurring 
strings. 
Similar examples of recurring strings are as follows. Suppose that, beyond 
some point, n 2: m say, all the an are equal, to a E {O, I} say. Then, depending 
on the value of a, we get a recurring string 
(6.25) 
These strings clearly correspond to the cases where the set A is finite or cofinite 
(has finite complement) respectively. 

6. Cardinal Numbers 
127 
Returning to the general case, we now associate to the string (6.22) a se-
quence of rational numbers, that is, a map (JA : N -t Q, as follows: 
n 
for n E N, 
(JA(n) = EakTk. 
k=l 
Next, observe that when m :::: n :::: N, for some fixed N EN, 
m 
m 
E akTk::; E Tk 
k=n+l 
k=n+l 
Tn _ T m < Tn::; 2- N . 
(6.26) 
This shows that the terms of the sequence (6.26) are arbitrarily close eventually, 
in precisely the sense of our definition of Cauchy sequence in Chapter 4. Viewed 
in this light, formula (6.22) is nothing but the binary expansion of the real 
number PA. 
We are now very close to a bijection between subsets A of N and real 
numbers PA in the interval [0,1]. There is one problem remaining, caused by 
the expansions .al ... ani corresponding to the co finite sets. For example, take 
the number PA = .oi corresponding to the subset A = N \ {I}. According 
to (6.26), the terms of the corresponding Cauchy sequence are 
which differ from the constant sequence ~ by the null sequence (~)n. The con-
stant sequence ~ corresponds to the binary expansion .10 of the singleton {l}, 
and so the distinct subsets {I} and N \ {I} have equivalent Cauchy sequences, 
that is, they correspond to the same real number. The same argument shows 
that the distinct strings 
(6.27) 
correspond to the same real number. 
It turns out, however, that the only violations of injectivity are those of the 
form (6.27), and we shall prove this now. The claim is that two distinct strings 
a = .al'" anÂ·Â·Â·, 
b = .bl ... bn ... 
correspond to distinct real numbers provided that neither terminates with an 
infinite string i of ones. Assume this proviso, and let the first place where a 
and b differ be the nth: 

128 
Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
say. By hypothesis, there is at least one Â° to the right of bn in bj let the first of 
these be bm : 
m > n, 
bm = 0, 
bk = 1 for 
n < k < m. 
Then the terms of the Cauchy sequence for a are eventually greater than or 
equal to those of the constant sequence for 
, 
. 
a = .al ... an-110, 
and those of the Cauchy sequence for b are eventually less than or equal to 
those of the constant sequence for 
b' = .al ... an- l01 ... 10, 
where the final one is in the mth place. Since b' < a', it follows that the Cauchy 
sequences for a and b cannot differ by a null sequence, as their terms eventually 
differ by at least a' - b' = 2-m . 
We summarize what we have proved so far in the form of a theorem. 
Theorem 6.7 
There is a bijection between the non-cofinite members of P(N) and the real 
numbers in the interval [0,1). 
0 
The interval here is half-open as we are allowing Â° = .0, which corresponds 
to 0, but not 1 = j, which corresponds to the cofinite set No 
Our next job is to count the cofinite subsets of N, or, equivalently, the 
number of finite subsets (complementation is a bijection between these fami-
lies). So how many subsets of N are there with n elements? Certainly no more 
than I Map(A,N)I, where IAI = n, that is, at most N8 = No \In E N (by Ex-
ercise 6.26). Thus, the number of n-element subsets of N is countable \In ~ 0. 
Since the set of n ~ Â° is countable, our next result follows from Theorem 6.6. 
Theorem 6.8 
The number of cofinite subsets of N is No. 
o 
There is one more link in the chain connecting the power set P(N) and the 
set lR. of all real numbers. Before forging it, here is an important definition. 
Definition 6.2 
The cardinality of the set lR. of all real numbers is called the cardinal of the 
continuum and denoted by c. 

6. Cardinal Numbers 
129 
For our last step, put 
1R+ = {r E IR I r > a} 
and consider the map 
a: (0,1) 
----+ 
1R+ 
x 
~ x 
l-x' 
(6.28) 
Since a has an inverse, 
(3: 
1R+ 
----+ 
(0,1) 
r 
~ r 
l+r' 
a is a bijection. By composing a with the obvious bijections from 1R+ to 1R- = 
{r E IR 1 r < O} and from (-1,0) to (1,0), we get a bijection from (-1,0) 
to 1R-. Combining this map with a (and 0 ~ 
0), we get a bijection from 
( -1, 1) to R Since all intervals with endpoints a and b, a < b, have the same 
cardinality as (-1,1), we have proved the following result. 
Theorem 6.9 
The cardinality of any interval with endpoints a and b, a < b, is c. 
We are now in a position to prove our last theorem. 
Theorem 6.10 
peN) has the cardinal c of the continuum. 
Proof 
By Theorems 6.7 and 6.8, 
IP(N)I = 1[0,1)1 + NoÂ· 
Since No :::; c (Theorem 6.3), it follows from Theorem 6.9 that 
IP(N)I :::; 1[0,1)1 + 1[1,2]1 = 1[0,2]1Â· 
So Theorems 6.7 and 6.9 together yield 
c:::; IP(N)I :::; c, 
and the proof is completed by an application of the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein 
theorem.

We thus have a fairly well-understood cardinal c greater than No. There are 
even bigger ones of course, such as IP(lR)l. An obvious question is: are there 
any that lie strictly between No and c? That the answer to this question is 
in the negative forms the famous continuum hypothesis of Cantor, which 
occupied logicians for many decades of this century. It was finally proved to be 
independent of the usual axioms of set theory by P. J. Cohen in 1963.

1.14 If an integral domain is finite, we can list its elements ai, 1 ::; i ::; n. If a 
is one of these and a i= 0, we claim that the products aai, 1 ::; i ::; n, 
are all different. For if aai = aaj, then a(ai - aj) = 0, and (1.15) 
implies that ai = aj, whence i = j. Thus (pigeon-hole principle, see 
Chapter 5), some aak = 1. Then ak = a-I, whence (1.15) holds and 
we have a field.

Then a3 = 5b3 , whence a3 and also a is divisible by 5, a = 5e say.

1.19 The negation of "P is false" is "P is not false", which is the same as 
"P is true". 
Assume P and deduce ",P. We now have P and ",P, which is a con-

clude (c) as it is the same as (b). (a) and (d) are also the same, and 
cannot be concluded. 
1.20 Assume for a contradiction that P is false, and let n - 1, n, n + 1 be 
integers for which it fails. Thus, there is an integer m such that 
that is, 
12m = 3(n2 + 1). 
Thus, n 2 + 1 = 4m, so that n2 leaves remainder -Ion division by 4, 
which contradicts the first part of Exercise 1.17. So P is true. 
1.22 Assume that f(x) = g(x) h(x), where g(x) and h(x) are quadratics 
over Z. Comparing coefficients of x4, the leading coefficients of g(x) 
and h(x) are both equal to 1 or -1. In the latter case, replace g(x) and 
h(x) by their negatives. Then we can write 
g(x)=x2+ax+b, 
h(x)=x2 +cx+d, 
where a, b, e, d are integers. Multiplying out and comparing coefficients, 
we get 
a + e = 0, 
ac + b + d = 2, 
ad + be = 2, 
bd = 1998. 
Use the first two equations to eliminate c = -a, d = a2 - b + 2 from 
the third: a( a2 - 2b + 2) = 2. Thus, a is even and 2 is the product of 
two even numbers, which is impossible. 
1.24 Let the people be 1,2, ... , n, with ft, 12, ... , fn friends present, respec-

they must be equal to 0,1, ... , n - 1 in some order. So we can find i 
and j such that fi = 0 and Ii = n - 1. So j is everyone's friend, in 
particular, i and j are friends, and i is no-one's friend, in particular, i 
and j are not friends. Contradiction.

Pi,P2, ... ,PnÂ· By Theorem 1.7, the number N = PiP2Â·Â·Â·Pn + 1 is 
a product of primes. In particular N is divisible by some prime, P say. 
Then P is equal to some Pi, 1 ~ i ~ n. Since piN and P I Pi ... Pn, we 
deduce that P I (N - PlÂ·Â·Â· Pn) = 1. Contradiction. 
1.42 There are several possible answers here, one of which is as follows: 
prove P(l, 1), assume P(l, n -1), n > 1, prove P(l, n), assume P(m-
1,1), m > 1, prove P(n, 1), assume both P(m -1, n), and P(m, n -1), 
m, n > 1, prove P(m, n).

1.43 Follow the strategy of the previous exercise or that described in the 
text. Take the latter case and P(m, n) : m + n = n + m. P(l,l) is 
obvious. 
Let m ::::: 1 and assume P( m, 1) : m + 1 = 1 + m. 
Prove P(m + 1,1): 
(m+1)+1 
(1 + m) + 1 by the IH 
1 + (m + 1) by the associative law. 
Let n ~ 1 and assume P(m, n), m + n = n + m for all m. 
Prove P(m, n + 1) for all m: 
m+(n+1) 
(m+n)+l by the associative law 
(n+m)+l by the IH 
n+(m+1) by the associative law 
n+(l+m) by P(m, 1) 
(n+1)+m by the associative law, 
as required. 
1.44 7l"(m, n)/n! is just another way of writing the binomial coefficient 
(m;n) , which is an integer. 
1.45 al = aI, an = an-l + an for all n ~ 2. 7l"1 = aI, 7l"n = 7l"n-1 . an for all 
n ~ 2. 
1.46 When m = 0, both sides of the equation (x-l)m = (Xm)-l are equal 
to 1. When m is positive 
whence 
Now let m be negative, say m = -n with n ::::: 1. Then (x-l)m 
(x-l)-n = ((x-l)-l)n = ((x-l)n)-l = (x-n)-l = (xm)-l, where the 
positive case is used at the third step. Thus 
as required.

To get the rules of indices in the general case, first observe that the 
proof of Theorem 1.9 works for all integer values of m (check) provided 
n ~ O. Replacing x by X-I in the first rule, with m arbitrary and n ~ 0, 
(x-I)m . (x-I)n = (x-I)m+n, 
that is, 
for all m and n ~ 0, whence (replacing m by -m) 
which proves the first rule. For the second, let n > 0 and observe that, 
using (*), 
1.47 Proceed by double induction on m and n. If either m or n is zero, both 
sides are equal to 1 and we have the base. Now let m and n be positive 
and assume the IH 
Then 
b(m -l,n) = b(n,m -1) and b(m,n -1) = b(n -I,m). 
b(m, n) = b(m - 1, n) + b(m, n - 1) 
b(n,m -1) + b(n -I,m) 
= 
b(n -I,m) +b(n,m -1) 
b(n,m). 
1.49 Double induction again. Choosing m things from m can only be done 
by taking them all, that is, in just one way. The 0 things that remain 
can thus be chosen in only one way too. Since (m~n) is equal to 1 
when either m or n is zero, this establishes the base. So let m and n be 
positive and distinguish one object, call it *, of the m + n things. Then 
the m things chosen either include * or they do not. In the first case, 
include * and choose m - 1 from the remaining m + n - 1 : (m~~~l) 
choices by the IH. In the second, simply choose m from the remaining 
m + n -1 : (m+';:-l) choices by the IH again. Thus, the number of ways 
of choosing m things from m + n is equal to 
( mm+ _n -1 1) + (m +mn - 1) 
= 
b(m -l,n) + (m,n -1) 
= 
b(m, n) by definition 
= 
(m;n), 
as required.

1.50 Divide the 2n things into two equal halves. The n things to be chosen 
will have k in the first half and n - k in the second half, 0 ::; k ::; n, 
giving G) and (n~k) possibilities respectively. Thus, 
by symmetry.

The base n = 1 of the induction is easy: 
1 = 0.1 + 1 . 1,

1.55 Note that the sum defining en for n ::::: 2 is symmetric: the kth term 
from the left is equal to the kth term from the right. When n is odd, so 
that the number of terms is even, their sum must be even, whence Cn 
is even for all odd n ::::: 3. Further, when n = 2m is even, the parity 
of en is the same as that of the middle term c~, which is the same as 
the parity of Cm. By putting n = 2r.s with s odd, and repeating this 
argument, we see that n is odd precisely when s = 1, that is, n is in 
power of 2. 
1.56 Assume the PMI and suppose that the WOP is false, that is, there is a 
property A that holds for some positive integer, b say, but for no least 
one. Let pen) be the proposition: 
A fails for every k with 1 ::; k ::; n. 
Then P(l) is true, for otherwise 1 would be the least positive integer 
with A. Now let n > 1 and assume pen - 1) : A fails for every k with 
1 ::; k ::; n - 1. Then A must fail for n, otherwise n would be the least 
positive integer with A. Hence, A fails for all k with 1 ::; k ::; n. Thus 
Pen) is true, which completes the inductive step. By the PMI, Pen) is 
true for all n ::::: 1, including b. Thus A fails for b. Contradiction. 
1.57 We have to show that 
bs is an integer {:} I I b. 
Suppose first that I I b. Then b = ml, and bs = (ml)s = m(ls), and 
this is an integer since Is is. For the converse, proceed by contraposition 
and assume that It b. Then b = ql + r, 0 < r < I, by Theorem 1.14. 
Thus Is is an integer and rs is not. It follows that bs = q(ls) + rs is 
not an integer, as required. 
1.58 Let a = -c with c> 0 and write 
c = bq + r, 
o ::; r < b. 
Then 
{ b( -q) + 0 
a = -c = b( -q) - r = 
b( _q _ 1) + (b _ r) 
if r = 0, 
if r > 0, 
and 0 ::; s < b with remainder s = 0, b - r in the two cases respectively. 
1.60 Put h = (a, b) = sa + tb. Since abjh is a common multiple of a and b, 
abjh::::: [a, b]. Now let [a, b] = ma = nb. Then 
snb = sma = m(h - tb) = mh - mtb, 
and b I mho Then b ::; mh and ab ::; amh = [a, b]h, that is, abjh ::; [a, b]. 
Hence, ab = h[a,b] = (a,b)[a,b].

(Yes, the algorithm always works for polynomials with rational coeffi-
cients, essentially because the degrees of the remainders form a strictly 
decreasing sequence. It is customary to write hcf's of polynomials in 
monic form, that is, with leading coefficient 1, namely, x + 1 in this 
example.) 
1.63 Use induction on n 2': 2, the inductive base being the content of The-
orem 1.16. Now let n 2': 3 and assume the result for n - 1. Putting 
b = b1b2 Â·â¢Â· bn - 1, we have p I bbn , so that p I b or p I bn by Theo-
rem 1.16. Thus, by the IH, p divides bk for some k with 1 $ k $ n - 1 
or p I bn , as required. 
1.64 Since tk $ Tk and tk $ Sk for all values of k, 1 $ k $ l, it is clear 
that him and h I n. On the other hand, the highest powers of Pk 
that divide mlh, nih are Tk - tk, Sk - tk, and one of these is zero 
by definition of "min". It follows that no prime divides both mlh and 
nih, whence mlh and nih are coprime. By Theorem 1.15, we can find 
integers sand t such that smlh + tnlh = 1. Hence, sm + tn = h, and 
any common divisor of m and n is a divisor of h. Thus h = (m, n).

2.1 Pt:.Q == (P v Q) /\ rv(P /\ Q). 
2.2 Yes. Further justification appears in Section 2.2. 
2.3 Each side of the first equivalence is false precisely when A and Bare 
both false. Each side of the second equivalence is true precisely when A 
and B are both true. Hence, both equivalences are true statements. 
2.5 C is true if and only if all the Pk are true, 1 ::; k ::; n. D is false if and 
only if all the Pk are false, 1 ::; k ::; n. 
2.6 For P => Q to be false, we must have P true and Q false. It is true in 
the other three cases: P and Q both true, P and Q both false, P false 
and Q true. 
2.8 (a) (rvP => (Q /\ rvQ)) => P. 
(b) (rvQ => rvP) => (P => Q). 
(c) P(I) /\ (P(n) => P(n + 1)) => P(n). 
In (c), the range of values of n in the parentheses on the left and in 
the P(n) on the right is the whole of N (see Section 2.4). 
2.9 Let * be a unary operation. Then *P can take two truth-values for 
each truth-value of P, so there are four such operations: 
P 
rvp 
T = PVrvP 
F = P /\rvP 
same truth-value as P, the identity, 
opposite truth-value to P, negation, 
always true, tautology, 
always false, contradiction. 
For a binary operation 0, P oQ can take two truth-values for each choice 
of truth-values for P and Q independently. Since there are 2 . 2 = 4 
such choices, the number of possibilities for 0 is 24 = 16. 
Pursuing similar reasoning, the total number of n-any operations is 22n â¢ 
2.11 The left-hand side is the property, call it P, of n in Theorem 1.16, and 
the right-hand side the definition of prime or 1. Thus, "if n has prop-
erty P, then n is prime or n = 1". This is the converse of Theorem 1.16. 
2.12 It is a form of variant 3 of the PMI (double induction). As in Exercise 2.8, 
the ranges of values of parameters are missing (see Section 2.4).

2.22 The tautology T = P V rvp is defined by four ones. Each of P V Q, 
Pv rvQ, rvPV Q has exactly three ones. Each of P, Q, (P /\Q) V (rvP /\

Since these eight operations are all different, they comprise half of 
the 16. Since they are all true when P and Q are both true, their 
negations comprise the other half.

3.42 Check conditions (i)-(iv) in turn. 
(i) Since every topology T has 0 as a member, ITI ~ 1. Hence, 0 is not 
a topology as 101 = o. So 0 '" T, (i) fails, and T is not a topology. 
We continue for the sake of completemers (and curiosity). 
(ii) T = P(S) is a topology (obviously), called the discrete topology 
on S, so (ii) holds. 
(iii) Consider (J" U T, where (J" and T are topologies on S. (i) and (ii) 
hold, but (iii) and (iv) fail in general: take S = {I, 2, 3}, (J" = 
{<p, {I}, {I, 2}, S}, T = {<p, {3}, {3, 2}, S} and observe that neither 
{I} U {3} = {I, 3} nor {I, 2} n {3, 2} = {2} is in (J" U T. SO (iii) fails. 
(iv) Let (J", T E T and consider (J" n T. It is easily checked that (i)-(iv) 
hold for (J" n T, so that (iv) holds for T.

4.1 (S) holds, but (R) and (T) fail. 
4.3 (R) is obvious, and (S) follows from the symmetry of =. 
For (T), assume (a,b) rv (e,d) and (e,d) rv (e,f) : a + d = e + b, 
e+ f = e + d. 
Adding these together and subtracting e + d from both sides, we get 
a + f = e + b, making free use of the fundamental laws of arithmetic. 
So (a, b) rv (e, f), as required. 
4.5 For (R), take hex) = O. 
For (8), replace hex) by -hex). 
For (T), add the multiples together. 
4.6 The statements are not quantified properly: this "proof" starts by ap-
parently assuming that apb for some b, and it may be that there is no 
such b, for example when p is the "empty relation" 0. 
4.7 This is the relation = of equality. 
4.9 (R), (8), (T) follow from the corresponding properties of =. The classes 
are the half-open intervals tn, n + 1), nEZ, in formula (3.8) of the 
previous chapter. Z is a transversal. 
4.10 By the one-to-one correspondence, we can take the bound of Exer-
cise 3.36 for the number of partitions, namely 22" . 
4.13 In each of these five laws, the right- and left-hand sides are equal for 
all integer values of the variables. Hence, in each case, their remainders 
on division by n are equal. 
4.15 Suppose that n is not a prime, n = a.b say, where a, bEN, 1 < a, b < n. 
Suppose further, for a contradiction, that ZjnZ is a field. So \I[a] :f=. [0], 
raj has a multiplicative inverse, call it [e], in ZjnZ. Then 
[eaJ = [e][aJ = [IJ 
=} ea == 1 (mod n) 
=} nl(ea-l) 
=} nl(ea-l)b=en-b 
=} nib, 
which is impossible as 1 < b < n. So ZjnZ is not a field. 
4.16 Recall from Chapter 1 that a field is just a commutative ring-with-1 
in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Suppose

that n is a prime. Then we must prove that 
[0] ~ [a] E ZjnZ =? 3c [cal = [c][a] = [1]. 
Since [0] ~ [a], we can assume that 1 5 a 5 n - 1. Then a and n 
are coprime, (a, n) = 1, as n is a prime. By Theorem 1.15, 3s, t E Z 
1 = sa + tn. Then [sa] = [1] and we can take c = s. 
4.17 If (a, n) = 1, the multiplicative inverse [c] is found exactly as in the 
previous solution. For the converse, suppose that [a, n] = h ~ 1 so 
that h divides every multiple of a. Assume for a contradiction that [a] 
has a multiplicative inverse [e] : [cal = [c][a] = 1. Then ca - 1 = kn for 
some k E Z. Since h I a and h I n, we deduce h 11, which is impossible 
as h> 1. So no multiplicative inverse exists when (a, n) ~ 1. 
4.20 Suppose that (a', b') rv (a, b), (c', d') rv (c, d), that is, a' + b = a + b', 
c' + d = c + d'. Adding these equations, (a' + c') + (b + d) = (a + c) + 
(b' + d'), that is, (a' + c', b' + d') rv (a + c, b + d), as required. 
4.21 Multiplying -1 = [1,2] by -b = [1, b + 1] using (4.11),

[b+1,1], 
subtracting b + 2 from each component, and [b + 1,1] = b. 
4.23 Using (4.11), 
[2, 1 ][a, b] 
[2a + b, 2b + a] 
= 
[a, b], 
subtracting a + b from both components. 
4.24 We have to show that none of the products 
[m+1, l][n+1, 1], [m+l, 1][1, n+l], [1, m+l][n+1, 1], [1, m+1][1, n+1] 
is equal to the zero class [1,1] = {(k, k) IkE N}. Using (4.11) and 
subtracting m + n + 1 from each component, these products are [mn + 
1,1], [1, mn + 1], [1, mn + 1], [mn + 1, 1] respectively. Since mn + 1 ~ 1, 
none of them is equal to [1,1]. 
4.25 Suppose that (a', b') rv (a, b), (c', d') rv (e, d), that is,

5.1 (a) For negative values of the argument there is no real square-root, 
and 
(b) for positive values there are two. 
By definition, every element of the domain must pass to exactly one 
value under a map. 
5.2 There may be distinct elements al, a2 E A such that 8(al) = 8(a2), 
whereupon {8(a) 1 a E A} is not a set in accordance with the definition. 
5.3 Their graphs consist of the following pairs of elements of Ax B:

5.6 Since A =I- 0, 3a E A. Since there is no value we can assign to a, 
Map(A,0) is the empty set. 
Since 0 ~ B for any set B, there is an inclusion ~ E Map(0, B), which is 
thus a singleton. The same argument holds when B = 0, so Map(0, 0) 
is a singleton.

(a,b) E G/\ (b,c) E H}. 
5.9 \fX ~ A, put 8(X) = {b E B 1 3x E X 8(x) = b}. Since A =I- peA), the

provided any use of the symbol 8 (as in Exercise 5.10) is accompanied 
by a qualification explaining which of the two meanings is intended.

it follows that ()' is well defined. Then Va E A,

5.14 Another hairy one. Denoting the ,,-,-class of a by [aJ, we might try 
[a]*[b] = [a*bJ, a, bE A. This is well defined as long as for a, a', b, b' E A, 
a "-' a', b "-' b' '* a * b "-' a' * b'. 
5.16 As rl(O) is the set of roots of the equation f(x) = 0, If- 1(0)1 ~ n. 
5.17 If f3: B x B ~ 
B is the binary operation and 8: A ~ 
A x A is the 
diagonal map, then B * Â¢ is the composite f3(8 x Â¢)8. 
5.18 Given (), Â¢, 1/J E Map(A, A), we may have 
8(Â¢ * 1/J) = (8Â¢) * (8'IjJ), 
(Â¢ * 'IjJ)O = (Â¢8) * ('ljJ8), 
0* (Â¢'IjJ) = Â«() * Â¢)(8 * 1/J), 
(Â¢1/J) * 0 = (Â¢ * ())(1/J * ()). 
Only the second one is always true: Va E A

(b,I); (a,3), (b,2). 
None are surjections. 
5.23 For x, y E lR, 
B(x) = B(y) Â¢:> ax + b = ay + b Â¢:> ax = ay Â¢:> a(x - y) = o. 
We can deduce x = y from this if and only if a =I- O. 
For any C E lR, 3x E lR with 
B(x) = c Â¢:> ax + b = c Â¢:> ax = c - b, 
and this can be solved for x Vc if and only if a =I- O. The condition 
for (i), (ii) or (iii) is thus the same in every case: a =I- O. 
5.24 The values of Â¢ on 1, 2, 3, 4 are 0, 1, 2, 2, respectively, so Â¢ is not 
injective: Â¢(3) = Â¢(4). Since Vn E N Â¢(n) ~ 0, Â¢ is not surjective: 
~n E N </>(n) = -1. (It turns out that 1m Â¢ ~ {O, I} U {2n 1 n EN}.)

5.27 If m > n, there are no injections by condition (5.20). So assume m :::; n 
and put A = {ak I 1 :::; k :::; m}. The values of an injection on these 
elements can be chosen in turn: for al in n ways, for a2 in n - 1 ways, 
and when k 2 3, for ak in n-k+l ways, finishing with n-m+l choices 
when k = m. The number of injections is thus equal to n!/(n - m)! 
The number of bijections is equal to n! when m = nand 0 otherwise. 
It is quite difficult (but not impossible) to count the number of surjec-
tions. 
5.28 Let bE ImO, so that O-l(b) 1= 0 and O-l(b) E Q. Then define

it is a bijection. 
5.29 With 0, A, B, Q, 0' as in the previous exercise, we have a natural map 
v : A ~ 
Q and an inclusion ~ : ImO ~

required decomposition. 
5.31 Since (A')' = A VA ~ S, it follows that K,K, = 1pcs). So K, has an inverse

Map(B, C), let 'Y(Â¢) be the map from A x B ~

b = IBI = IDI + 1 = 101 = IAI = a. 
So we have deduced a = b in both cases. 
6.21 When a is finite, a ~ a + 1 ==? 0 ~ 1 > 0, impossible. Let IAI = a be 
infinite. By Theorem 6.3, there is an injection a : N ---t A. Then 
Since 
a 
IImal + IA \Imal 
INI + IA \ImalÂ· 
(3: N 
---t N\{l} 
n 
f----+ 
n + 1 
is a bijection, 1 + INI = INI. Then we have 
a 
INI + IA \Imal 
1 + INI + IA \Imal 
l+a=a+l. 
6.23 If IAI = a is finite and IBI = b is infinite, then Theorem 6.3 implies 
there are injections 
a: A ---t N, 
J3:N---tB, 
whence a :::; No :::; b, so a :::; b by transitivity. Since a = b is impossible 
(by Theorem 6.3 again), a < b. 
6.24 Since 
a: N

k

k + n 
is an injection, 
No = INI = 11m al + IN \ 1m al = No + n. 

Solutions to Exercises 
6.26 This is a straightforward induction on n using Theorem 6.5. 
6.28 Writing Z = NU{O}U - N, we have 
\Z\ = 2No + 1 = No + 1 = No. 
6.29 We have injections 
Z ~ Q 
n 
I----> nil, 
where alb is in lowest terms. Thus, 
Q 
~ ZxZ 
alb 
I----> 
(a,b), 
161 
using Exercise 6.28. Then \Q\ = No by the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein 
theorem. 
6.30 Given (): N ~ 
Z/2Z, define X-l(()) = {n E N \ ()(n) = I}. 
6.32 Given r = .al ... ambl .. . bn, we can write 
r = Tma + T(n+m)b Z)Tnk), 
k?:O 
where a = al ... am, b = bl ... bn are ordinary binary numbers. Since 
the sum over k is just 2n 1(2n - 1), r is rational, and clearly Â° = .0 ::::; 
r ::::; . i = 1. For the converse, let q = alb, where a and b are integers 
and we can assume Â° < a < b to avoid triviality. In the process of 
(binary long) division of a by b, the successive remainders rn, n E N, 
all satisfy Â° ::::; rn ::::; b -1 by Euclid's theorem. So we will find m, n E N 
with m f- n and a ::::; m, n ::::; a + b such that rm = rn. Moreover, for 
n ~ a, rn+! is the remainder on dividing 2rn by b. This implies that 
rm+k = rn+k I::Ik E N, and the binary expansion is recurring. 
6.33 Since every cofinite set has a binary expansion that is recurring, they 
all correspond to rational numbers, and we already know that \Q\ = No. 
6.34 The bijection is the composite 
(-1,0) 
(1,0) 
r 
-r 
lR+ 
-r 
l+r 
6.35 The ordering on [0,1) comes by ordering the sequences 
A ~ peN), 
A non-cofinite, 
lexicographically. With the usual ordering of Z, this extends to lR via 
the obvious bijection f3 : lR ~ 
Z x [0,1).

Elements of Logic via Numbers and Sets 
For the sum and product, take the termwise sum and product of Cauchy 
sequences (as in (6.26)) in [0,1) and extend to the whole of lR via f3 and 
the usual sum and product on Z. [N.B. These are just the definitions: 
it takes quite a lot of work to prove that they are correct.] 
6.37 We have 
c ::; b + c ::; c + c = 2c ::; c, 
by the previous exercise. So b + c = c by the Cantor-Schroeder-
Bernstein theorem. 

Guide to the Literature 
The references for Chapter 1 are [9] and [6]. The former is a more detailed 
and practical study of the structure of proofs and includes a large number of 
examples in its leisurely approach. The latter takes further the illustrations 
from number theory used in this chapter and forms the classic introduction to 
this subject. 
The interface between logic and mathematics, which is hinted at in Chap-
ter 2 and forms the chief motivation for this book, is extended in [10]. A fuller 
treatment of the syllogistic is to be found in [3]. 
The first half of the classic text [7] gives a rather more condensed treatment 
of Chapter 3 and the next two, and goes on to introduce the basic ideas of 
group theory. Elementary set theory occupies the early chapters in [4], and [10] 
contains a full and rigorous introduction. The study of topology is introduced 
and carried to some depth in [1]. 
The basic material of Chapter 4 is covered in [8] as well as in [7], and the 
former also contains an introduction to abstract algebra and the construction 
of the real numbers by Dedekind section. 
The key reference for Chapter 5 is again [7], and Peano's axioms are treated 
in [8]. 
The material in Chapter 6 comes directly from its source [2]. The more 
recent reference [5], which is destined to become a classic, gives an accessible 
and entertaining account of a great diversity of numerical curiosities, including 
the very large and very small surreal numbers in its final chapter. The definitive 
treatment of the continuum hypothesis is to be found in [4]. 
Some of these books may be out of print, although copies of all of them are 
held at the University of Nottingham library. It is hoped that other volumes 
yet to be published in this Springer series will also provide further reading on 
most of the topics introduced in this book.

Dramatis Personae 
(in approximate order of appearance) 
The use of symbols in mathematics is of fundamental importance. Not only 
do they provide convenient abbreviations, but correct choice of notation can 
often playa crucial role in solving a problem. And conversely: if you don't 
believe me, try dividing XCVIII by XLIV. Just as in everyday life a word 
should ideally stand for a single concept, so in mathematics should a symbol 
represent a unique quantity. But in both cases tradition dictates otherwise, and 
it is easy to think of words and symbols that can have two or more meanings; 
there are at least three glaring examples of the latter in the foregoing, namely, 
[7fJ, B- 1 and A'. Again in both cases, the problem of ambiguity is solved by 
taking account of the context, with a brief explanatory note if necessary. Thus, 
when we write "let A, A' be two arbitrary subsets of S", we are not saying 
that A' is the complement of A in S, just as when we say "Jimmy Conners is 
leading by one set to love" we do not mean one set of saucepans.
