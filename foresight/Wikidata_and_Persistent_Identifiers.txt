Wikidata can hold metadata for almost any PID
●
Entity = organization, person, journal, article, …
●
Anybody can do this (with reliable sources)

Relationships between identifiers via Wikidata statements
●
DOI <references same article as> Pubmed ID
○

●

Wikidata SPARQL queries
●
Easy interface at https://query.wikidata.org/
●
Example: find articles with DOI’s where a given ORCID was an author:
SELECT ?personLabel ?article ?doi ?articleLabel WHERE {
    ?person wdt:P496 '0000-0001-6128-3356' .
    ?article wdt:P50 ?person ; wdt:P356 ?doi .
    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }  }

Wikidata items can be grouped by class
Property 31 = “instance of”: membership in a class
●
Human (Q5) - 3.3 million
●
Location (Q17334923 & subclasses) - 4.6 million
●
Organization (Q43229 & subclasses) - 860,000
●
Academic journal article (Q18918145 & subclasses) - 301,000
○
(all creative works Q17537576 - 1.5 million)
●
Gene (subclass of Q7187) - 610,000
Note varying levels of completeness: only limited selection of people (note also 
privacy concerns for living people) and creative works; quite comprehensive on 
concepts, organizations, locations.

? Wikidata QID ?

From “Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward”,
 
 
 
Draft Framing Principles (paraphrased):
●
Open, permanent, and unambiguous identification
●
Not limited by type or geographic or national boundaries.
●
Transparent and non-discriminatory terms of use.
●
Identifier and metadata available under CC-0
●
Sustainable business model … long-term openness, persistence, and 
reliability
●
Open Source Software
●
Transparent and representative governance
●
Living will: continue to operate under these principles if acquired.
Most of these are satisfied by the WMF and WIkidata.

My proposal for the Org Id Project: 
●
PID = Wikidata QID’s
●
Main software interface already in place: Wikidata itself
●
Establish a representative group/project to:
○
support and better standardize organization metadata in wikidata
○
systematically add/update organization information from reliable sources
○
encourage institutions to curate their own wikidata entries
○
regularly extract curated subsets of wikidata’s organization data
○
provide open-source tools for working with organization data in wikidata
●
Every organization involved in scholarly work should be sufficiently notable...

Wikidata is a Community!
Not a place to dump data...

Community processes within wikidata
●
Learn the norms of the community, ask questions, get experience
●
Follow written policies: “Assume good faith.” “Use common sense.” etc.
●
Any major efforts should contact relevant “WikiProject” members for advice 
(eg. WikiProject Physics, WikiProject Source Metadata); also use Project 
Chat, or other appropriate venues such as “talk” pages.
●
Significant automated (“bot”) activities should be presented for review - do 
100 sample edits and ensure they meet community standards
●
“Vandalism” is watched for carefully: vandals are blocked; edits reverted.
●
No “spamming”!
●
Wikidata is still young, norms evolving: your voice can make a difference!

Wikidata Notability
See https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Notability
1. At least one valid sitelink to another WikiMedia 
Foundation site (eg. wikipedia)
2. OR - “an instance of a clearly identifiable conceptual or 
material entity. [...] can be described using serious 
and publicly available references. “
3. OR - “fulfills some structural need” - i.e. makes wikidata 
more useful
reliable source => likely acceptable by criterion 2.

What about errors & conflicts?
●
Wrong claims without a source can be replaced with corrections
●
If two sources are in conflict, both claims can be presented, referencing the two 
distinct sources:
○
“The world is complicated. There is no single truth. Record what various sources say instead.”
●
Outdated information can be “deprecated”, current info “preferred”
●
Duplicate items can be merged: obsolete QID redirects to new one.
●
Community consensus resolves disputes. Administrators adjudicate edit wars.
●
Data imports should include a method for sustainability: how will data quality be 
maintained in future?
●
Vandals seem to be caught quickly.
●
Wikidata information may not be perfect truth, but where it’s been curated it’s 
pretty close.

Sample organizations using Wikidata
●
Finnish Broadcaster Yle - tagged content with Wikidata items since April 2016
●
Flemish art museums imported metadata on artworks, make dataset available 
as Linked Open Data
●
Gene Wiki - imported genes and protein data to wikidata, use in infoboxes
●
Google - Knowledge Graph: moved from Freebase to Wikidata
●
Schema.org - linked wikidata id’s with schema.org “types”
●
TED organization - imported metadata for thousands of TED talks
●
UNESCO - world heritage sites
●
VIAF (OCLC and British Library) - close to 1 million VIAF id’s and metadata 
imported, curation & reuse
●
WikiMedia Foundation - linking language wikipedias and other WMF initiatives 
via wikidata entities
