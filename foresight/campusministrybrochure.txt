We, the Campus Ministers and Campus
Liaisons of UNB Saint John, look different
from each other, and come from different
cultural and religious backgrounds. However,
we all have one thing in common: we are
here for you.
Your faith does matter, and we care.
We want to extend your faith experience
even on the campus. Wherever you stand in
matters of faith, you are always welcome to
visit us during our office hours or get in touch
with us during off-hours.
UNB Saint John Campus Ministry is a
volunteer service, provided by experienced
ministers, for every student,  as well as inter-
ested faculty and staff members here on cam-
pus. We are professionals in this field and you
can trust us. Every matter we discuss will be
kept in strict confidence.  Location of our 
office and other details can be found in this
brochure. We look forward to seeing you.

"The Campus Ministry was a help to me 
last year as a new student trying to settle 
in.  It gave me someone to rant to if 
classes were going badly or someone to 
ask hard questions."

“Through Campus Ministers and the dis-
cussion classes they offer, I find a totally 
different and exciting new world. I have  a 
very comfortable  and optimistic attitude 
to life. If you want to have this experi-
ence, please be quick to join us.”
