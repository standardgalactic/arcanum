Preface
When the ﬁrst edition of this text appeared thirteen
years ago, its writing was guided by several of objectives.
•
The text should be suited for a semester course for
undergraduate students encountering the subject of
plant physiology for the ﬁrst time. It was assumed
that the student would have completed a ﬁrst course
in botany or biology with a strong botanical compo-
nent. The book should provide a broad framework
for those interested in pursuing advanced study in
plant physiology, but it should also provide the gen-
eral understanding of plant function necessary for
students of ecology or agriculture.
•
In keeping with the above objective, the text should
focus on fundamental principles of how plants work
while attempting to balance the demands of bio-
chemistry and molecular biology on the one hand,
and traditional ‘‘whole-plant’’ physiology on the
other.
•
The text should be interesting and readable. It
should include some history so the student appreci-
ates how we arrived at our current understanding. It
should also point to future directions and challenges
in the ﬁeld.
•
The sheer breadth of plant physiology and the
rapidly expanding volume of literature in the ﬁeld
make it impossible to include all of the relevant
material in an entry-level text. Consequently, the
text must be selective and focused on those topics
that form the core of the discipline. At the same
time, the student should be introduced to the sig-
niﬁcance of physiology in the role that plants play
in the larger world outside the laboratory.
While we have made every effort to retain the
readability and overall approach of previous editions;
we have also introduced a number of signiﬁcant changes
in this fourth edition. Those changes include:
•
For this edition the illustration program has been
completely revised. Some ﬁgures have been deleted,
others have been revised, and many new ﬁgures have
been introduced. With the help of the publisher, we
have also introduced color into the illustrations. The
use of color improves the clarity of the ﬁgures, draws
attention to important elements in the ﬁgure, and
helps students visualize the relationships between
the ﬁgure and the concepts described in the text.
At the same time, we are mindful of costs and hope
that this has been done in a way that does not add
signiﬁcant cost to the student.
•
The number of complex chemical structures in
many ﬁgures has been reduced and biosynthetic
pathways have been simpliﬁed in order to provide
greater emphasis on fundamental principles.
•
We have removed the traditional introductory
chapter
on
Cells,
Tissues,
and
Organs
and
distributed some of this information in chapters to
which it pertains directly.
•
The list of references at the end of each chapter has
been updated throughout the new edition.
•
All life depends on energy and water. Unlike previ-
ous editions, the fourth edition begins with four
chapters that focus on the properties of water,
osmosis, water potential, and plant–water relations,
followed by a series of eight chapters dealing with
bioenergetics, primary plant metabolism, and plant
productivity.
•
A major change in this edition is the presence of
three new chapters (13, 14, and 15). Using the basic
information and concepts developed in chapters 1
to 12, these chapters focus on the inherent plastic-
ity of plants to respond to environmental change
on various time scales. This includes a discussion
of abiotic and biotic stress, plant acclimation to
stress, and ﬁnally, long-term, heritable adaptations
to environmental stress.
•
We have revised the treatment of hormones because
many instructors have told us that the separate
treatment of each hormone ﬁts their syllabus better.
The coverage of each hormone concludes with a
general description of the current status of receptors
and signal transduction pathways.
•
A new chapter focuses on the molecular genetics of
ﬂower and fruit development.
•
A Glossary has been created for the new edition.

Preface
To the Student
This is a book about how plants work. It is about the
questions that plant physiologists ask and how they go
about seeking answers to those questions. Most of all,
this book is about how plants do the things they do in
their everyday life.
The well-known conservationist John Muir once
wrote: When we try to pick out anything by itself, we ﬁnd
it hitched to everything in the universe. Muir might well
have been referring to the writing of a plant physiology
textbook. The scope of plant physiology as a science
is very broad, ranging from biophysics and molecular
genetics to environmental physiology and agronomy.
Photosynthetic metabolism not only provides carbon
and energy for the growing plant, but also determines
the capacity of the plant to withstand environmental
stress. The growth and development of roots, stems,
leaves, and ﬂowers are regulated by a host of interacting
factors such as light, temperature, hormones, nutrition,
and carbon metabolism. As a matter of practical necessity
more than scientiﬁc reality, we have treated many of
these topics in separate chapters. To get the most out of
this book, we suggest you be aware of these limitations
as you read and think about how various mechanisms
are integrated to form a functional plant.
Plant physiology is also a very active ﬁeld of study
and new revelations about how plants work are reported
in the literature almost daily. Many models and expla-
nations contained in this book may have been revised by
the time the book appears on the market. If you ﬁnd a
particular topic interesting and wish to learn more about
it, the listed publications at the end of each chapter are
your gateway into the relevant research literature. You
can learn what has happened since this book was written
by seeking out reviews and opinions published in the
more recent editions of those same journals.
In
spite
of
its
presumed
objectivity,
science
ultimately relies on the interpretation of experimental
results by scientists—interpretations that are often
found to be inadequate and ﬁlled with uncertainty.
However, as results and observations accumulate,
interpretations are reﬁned and the degree of uncertainty
diminishes. This is the nature of scientiﬁc discovery
and the source of the real excitement of doing science.
In this book, we have attempted to convey some sense
of this scientiﬁc process.
We hope that, through this book, we are able to
share with you some of our own fascination with the
excitement, mystery, and challenge of learning about
plant physiology.

Plant Cells and Water
Without water, life as we know it could not exist. Water
is the most abundant constituent of most organisms.
The actual water content will vary according to tissue
and cell type and it is dependent to some extent
on environmental and physiological conditions, but
water typically accounts for more than 70 percent by
weight of non-woody plant parts. The water content
of plants is in a continual state of ﬂux, depending
on the level of metabolic activity, the water status
of the surrounding air and soil, and a host of other
factors. Although certain desiccation-tolerant plants
may experience water contents of only 20 percent and
dry seeds may contain as little as 5 percent water,
both are metabolically inactive, and resumption of
signiﬁcant metabolic activity is possible only after the
water content has been restored to normal levels.
Water ﬁlls a number of important roles in the
physiology of plants; roles for which it is uniquely suited
because of its physical and chemical properties. The
thermal properties of water ensure that it is in the liq-
uid state over the range of temperatures at which most
biological reactions occur. This is important because
most of these reactions can occur only in an aqueous
medium. The thermal properties of water also con-
tribute to temperature regulation, helping to ensure that
plants do not cool down or heat up too rapidly. Water
also has excellent solvent properties, making it a suit-
able medium for the uptake and distribution of mineral
nutrients and other solutes required for growth. Many
of the biochemical reactions that characterize life,
such as oxidation, reduction, condensation, and hydrol-
ysis, occur in water and water is itself either a reactant
or a product in a large number of those reactions. The
transparency of water to visible light enables sunlight
to penetrate the aqueous medium of cells where it can be
used to power photosynthesis or control development.
Water in land plants is part of a very dynamic sys-
tem. Plants that are actively carrying out photosynthesis
experience substantial water loss, largely through evap-
oration from the leaf surfaces. Equally large quantities
of water must therefore be taken up from the soil and
moved through the plant in order to satisfy deﬁciencies
that develop in the leaves. For example, it is estimated
that the turnover of water in plants due to photosynthesis
and transpiration is about 1011 tonnes per year.
This constant ﬂow of water through plants is a
matter of considerable signiﬁcance to their growth and
survival. The uptake of water by cells generates a pres-
sure known as turgor; in the absence of any skeletal
system, plants must maintain cell turgor in order to
remain erect. As will be shown in later chapters, the
uptake of water by cells is also the driving force for
cell enlargement. Few plants can survive desiccation.
There is no doubt that the water relations of plants and

plant cells are fundamental to an understanding of their
physiology.
This chapter is concerned with the water relations
of cells. Topics to be addressed include the following:
•
a review of the unique physical and chemical prop-
erties of water that make it particularly suitable as a
medium for life,
•
physical processes that underlie water movement in
plants, including diffusion, osmosis, and bulk ﬂow
as mechanisms for water movement, and
•
the chemical potential of water and the concept of
water potential.
These concepts provide the basis for understanding
water movement within the plant and between the plant
and its environment, to be discussed in Chapter 2.
1.1 WATER HAS UNIQUE
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL
PROPERTIES
The key to understanding many of the unique properties
of water is found in the structure of the water molecule
and the strong intermolecular attractions that result
from that structure. Water consists of an oxygen atom
covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms (Figure 1.1).
The oxygen atom is strongly electronegative, which
means that it has a tendency to attract electrons. One
consequence of this strong electronegativity is that, in
the water molecule, the oxygen tends to draw electrons
away from the hydrogen. The shared electrons that
make up the O—H bond are, on the average, closer to
the oxygen nucleus than to hydrogen. As a consequence,
the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge, and a
corresponding partial positive charge is shared between
the two hydrogen atoms. This asymmetric electron

distribution makes water a polar molecule. Overall,
water remains a neutral molecule, but the separation of
partial negative and positive charges generates a strong
mutual (electrical) attraction between adjacent water

1.2 The Thermal Properties of Water are Biologically Important

molecules or between water and other polar molecules.
This attraction is called hydrogen bonding (Figure 1.1).
The energy of the hydrogen bond is about 20 kJ mol−1.
The hydrogen bond is thus weaker than either covalent
or ionic bonds, which typically measure several hundred
kJ mol−1, but stronger than the short-range, transient
attractions known as Van der Waals forces (about 4 kJ
mol−1). Hydrogen bonding is largely responsible for the
many unique properties of water, compared with other
molecules of similar molecular size (Table 1.1).
In addition to interactions between water molecules,
hydrogen bonding also accounts for attractions between
water and other molecules or surfaces. Hydrogen bond-
ing, for example, is the basis for hydration shells that
form around biologically important macromolecules
such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates.
These layers of tightly bound and highly oriented water
molecules are often referred to as bound water. It
has been estimated that bound water may account for
as much as 30 percent by weight of hydrated protein
molecules. Bound water is important to the stability of
protein molecules. Bound water ‘‘cushions’’ protein,
preventing the molecules from approaching close
enough to form aggregates large enough to precipitate.
Hydrogen
bonding,
although
characteristic
of
water, is not limited to water. It arises wherever
hydrogen is found between electronegative centers.
This includes alcohols, which can form hydrogen bonds
because of the—OH group, and macromolecules such
as proteins and nucleic acids where hydrogen bonds
between amino (−NH2) and carbonyl (
|
C
| = O) groups
help to stabilize structure.
1.2 THE THERMAL PROPERTIES
OF WATER ARE
BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT
Perhaps the single most important property of water is
that it is a liquid over the range of temperatures most
compatible with life. Boiling and melting points are
generally related to molecular size, such that changes
of state for smaller molecules occur at lower temper-
atures than for larger molecules. On the basis of size
alone, water might be expected to exist primarily in
the vapor state at temperatures encountered over most
of the earth. However, both the melting and boiling
points of water are higher than expected when compared
with other molecules of similar size, especially ammonia
(NH3) and methane (CH4) (Table 1.1). Molecules such
as ammonia and the hydrocarbons (methane and ethane)
are associated only through weak Van der Waals forces
and relatively little energy is required to change their
state. Note, however, that the introduction of oxygen
raises the boiling points of both methanol (CH3—OH)
and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) to temperatures much closer
to that of water. This is because the presence of oxy-
gen introduces polarity and the opportunity to form
hydrogen bonds.
1.2.1 WATER EXHIBITS A UNIQUE
THERMAL CAPACITY
The term speciﬁc heat1 is used to describe the thermal
capacity of a substance or the amount of energy that can
be absorbed for a given temperature rise. The speciﬁc
heat of water is 4.184 J g−1 ◦C−1, higher than that of
any other substance except liquid ammonia (Table 1.1).
Because of its highly ordered structure, liquid water also
has a high thermal conductivity. This means that it
rapidly conducts heat away from the point of application.
The combination of high speciﬁc heat and thermal con-
ductivity enables water to absorb and redistribute large
amounts of heat energy without correspondingly large
increases in temperature. For plant tissues that consist
largely of water, this property provides for an excep-
tionally high degree of temperature stability. Localized
overheating in a cell due to the heat of biochemical
reactions is largely prevented because the heat may
be quickly dissipated throughout the cell. In addition,
large amounts of heat can be exchanged between cells
and their environment without extreme variation in the
internal temperature of the cell.
1.2.2 WATER EXHIBITS A HIGH
HEAT OF FUSION AND HEAT
OF VAPORIZATION
Energy is required to cause changes in the state of any
substance, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas,
without a change in temperature. The energy required
to convert a substance from the solid to the liquid state
is known as the heat of fusion. The heat of fusion for
water is 335 J g−1, which means that 335 J of energy are
required to convert 1 gram of ice to 1 gram of liquid
water at 0◦C (Table 1.1). Expressed on a molar basis,
the heat of fusion of water is 6.0 kJ mol−1 (18 g of water
per mole × 335 J g−1). The heat of fusion of water is
one of the highest known, second only to ammonia.
The high heat of fusion of water is attributable to
the large amount of energy necessary to overcome the
1Speciﬁc heat is deﬁned as the amount of energy required to
raise the temperature of one gram of substance by 1◦C
(usually at 20◦C). The speciﬁc heat of water is the basis for
the deﬁnition of a quantity of energy called the calorie. The
speciﬁc heat of water was therefore assigned the value of 1.0
calorie. In accordance with the International System of Units
(Syst`eme Internationale d’Unites, or SI), the preferred unit
for energy is the joule (J). 1 calorie = 4.184 joules.

Chapter 1 / Plant Cells and Water
strong intermolecular forces associated with hydrogen
bonding.
The density of ice is another important property.
At 0◦C, the density of ice is less than that of liquid
water. Thus water, unlike other substances, reaches
its maximum density in the liquid state (near 4◦C),
rather than as a solid. This occurs because molecules
in the liquid state are able to pack more tightly than in
the highly ordered crystalline state of ice. Consequently,
ice ﬂoats on the surface of lakes and ponds rather
than sinking to the bottom where it might remain
year-round. This is extremely important to the survival
of aquatic organisms of all kinds.
Just as hydrogen bonding increases the amount of
energy required to melt ice, it also increases the energy
required to evaporate water. The heat of vaporization
of water, or the energy required to convert one mole of
liquid water to one mole of water vapor, is about 44 kJ
mol−1 at 25◦C. Because this energy must be absorbed
from its surroundings, the heat of vaporization accounts
for the pronounced cooling effect associated with evap-
oration. Evaporation from the moist surface cools the
surface because the most energetic molecules escape the
surface, leaving behind the lower-energy (hence, cooler)
molecules. As a result, plants may undergo substantial
heat loss as water evaporates from the surfaces of leaf
cells. Such heat loss is an important mechanism for tem-
perature regulation in the leaves of terrestrial plants that
are often exposed to intense sunlight.
1.3 WATER IS THE UNIVERSAL
SOLVENT
The excellent solvent properties of water are due to the
highly polar character of the water molecule. Water has
the ability to partially neutralize electrical attractions
between charged solute molecules or ions by surround-
ing the ion or molecule with one or more layers of
oriented water molecules, called a hydration shell.
Hydration shells encourage solvation by reducing the
probability that ions can recombine and form crystal
structures (Figure 1.2).
The polarity of molecules can be measured by
a quantity known as the dielectric constant. Water
has one of the highest known dielectric constants
(Table 1.2). The dielectric constants of alcohols are
somewhat lower, and those of nonpolar organic liquids
such as benzene and hexane are very low. Water is
thus an excellent solvent for charged ions or molecules,
which dissolve very poorly in nonpolar organic liquids.
Many of the solutes of importance to plants are charged.
On the other hand, the low dielectric constants of
nonpolar molecules helps to explain why charged
solutes do not readily cross the predominantly nonpolar,
hydrophobic lipid regions of cellular membranes.
1.4 POLARITY OF WATER
MOLECULES RESULTS IN
COHESION AND ADHESION
The strong mutual attraction between water molecules
resulting from hydrogen bonding is also known as cohe-
sion. One consequence of cohesion is that water has
an exceptionally high surface tension, which is most
evident at interfaces between water and air. Surface ten-
sion arises because the cohesive force between water
molecules is much stronger than interactions between
water and air. The result is that water molecules at the
surface are constantly being pulled into the bulk water
(Figure 1.3). The surface thus tends to contract and
behaves much in the manner of an elastic membrane. A

high surface tension is the reason water drops tend to be
spherical or that a water surface will support the weight
of small insects.
Cohesion is directly responsible for the unusually
high tensile strength of water. Tensile strength is the
maximum tension that an uninterrupted column of any
material can withstand without breaking. High tensile
strength is normally associated with metals but, under
the appropriate conditions, water columns are also capa-
ble of withstanding extraordinarily high tensions—on
the order of 30 megapascals (MPa).2
The same forces that attract water molecules to each
other will also attract water to solid surfaces, a process
known as adhesion. Adhesion is an important factor in
the capillary rise of water in small-diameter conduits.
The combined properties of cohesion, adhesion,
and tensile strength help to explain why water rises
in capillary tubes and are exceptionally important in
maintaining the continuity of water columns in plants.
Cohesion, adhesion, and tensile strength will be dis-
cussed in greater detail in Chapter 2, when evaporative
water loss from plants and water movement in the xylem
are examined.

FIGURE 1.3 Schematic demonstration of surface ten-
sion in a water drop. Intermolecular attractions between
neighboring water molecules (heavy arrows) are greater
than attractions between water and air (light arrows),
thus tending to pull water molecules at the surface into

1.5 WATER MOVEMENT MAY BE
GOVERNED BY DIFFUSION
OR BY BULK FLOW
One objective of plant physiology is to understand the
dynamics of water as it ﬂows into and out of cells or
from the soil, through the plant, into the atmosphere.
Movement of substances from one region to another is
commonly referred to as translocation. Mechanisms for
translocation may be classiﬁed as either active or passive,
depending on whether metabolic energy is expended
in the process. It is sometimes difﬁcult to distinguish
between active and passive transport, but the transloca-
tion of water is clearly a passive process. Although in
the past many scientists argued for an active component,
the evidence indicates that water movement in plants
may be indirectly dependent upon on expenditure of
metabolic energy. Passive movement of most substances
can be accounted for by one of two physical processes:
either bulk ﬂow or diffusion. In the case of water, a
special case of diffusion known as osmosis must also be
taken into account.
1.5.1 BULK FLOW IS DRIVEN BY
HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
Movement of materials by bulk ﬂow (or mass ﬂow) is
pressure-driven. Bulk ﬂow occurs when an external
force, such as gravity or pressure, is applied. As a result,
all of the molecules of the substance move in a mass.
Movement of water by bulk ﬂow is a part of our everyday
experience. Water in a stream ﬂows in response to the
hydrostatic pressure established by gravity. It ﬂows from
the faucet in the home or workplace because of pres-
sure generated by gravity acting on standing columns
of water in the municipal water tower. Bulk ﬂow also
accounts for some water movement in plants, such as
through the conducting cells of xylem tissue or the
movement of water into roots. In Chapter 9, we discuss
how bulk ﬂow is a major component of the most widely
accepted hypothesis for transport of solutes through the
vascular tissue.
1.5.2 FICK’S FIRST LAW DESCRIBES
THE PROCESS OF DIFFUSION
Like bulk ﬂow, diffusion is also a part of our everyday
experience. When a small amount of sugar is placed
in a cup of hot drink, the sweetness soon becomes
dispersed throughout the cup. The scent of perfume
from a bottle opened in the corner of a room will soon
become uniformly distributed throughout the air. If
the drink is not stirred and there are no mass move-
ments of air in the room, the distribution of these
substances occurs by diffusion. Diffusion can be inter-
preted as a directed movement from a region of a high

6
Chapter 1 / Plant Cells and Water
concentration to a region of lower concentration, but
it is accomplished through the random thermal motion
of individual molecules (Figure 1.4). Thus, while bulk
ﬂow is pressure-driven, diffusion is driven principally
by concentration differences. Diffusion is a signiﬁcant
factor in the uptake and distribution of water, gases, and
solutes throughout the plant. In particular, diffusion is an
important factor in the supply of carbon dioxide for pho-
tosynthesis as well as the loss of water vapor from leaves.
The process of diffusion was ﬁrst examined quan-
titatively by A. Fick. Fick’s ﬁrst law, formulated in
1855, forms the basis for the modern-day quantitative
description of the process.
J = −D · A · C · l−1
(1.1)
J is the ﬂux or the amount of material crossing a unit
area per unit time (for example, mol m−2 s−1). D is the
diffusion coefﬁcient, a proportionality constant that is
a function of the diffusing molecule and the medium
through which it travels. A and l are the cross-sectional
area and the length of the diffusion path, respectively.
The term C represents the difference in concentration
between the two regions, also known as the concen-
tration gradient. C is the driving force for simple
diffusion. In the particular case of gaseous diffusion, it
is more convenient to use the difference in density (gm
m−3) or vapor pressure (KPa, kilopascal) in place of
concentration. The negative sign in Fick’s law accounts
for the fact that diffusion is toward the lower concentra-
tion or vapor pressure. In summary, Fick’s law tells us
that the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the
cross-sectional area of the diffusion path and to the con-
centration or vapor pressure gradient, and it is inversely
proportional to the length of the diffusion path.
1.6 OSMOSIS IS THE DIFFUSION
OF WATER ACROSS A
SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE
MEMBRANE
Fick’s law is most readily applicable to the diffusion of
solutes and gases. In the general model illustrated in
Figure 1.4, for example, the diffusing molecules could
be glucose dissolved in water, carbon dioxide dissolved
in water, or carbon dioxide in air. We note that the
diffusion of solute molecules from chamber A to cham-
ber B from the time t0 to t1 does not affect the volume
in either chamber, as indicated by no difference in the
height of the liquid in the columns of chambers A and
B (Figure 1.4). While Fick’s law theoretically applies to
the diffusion of solvent molecules as well, it can at ﬁrst
be difﬁcult to imagine a situation in which diffusion of
solvent molecules could occur. Consider what would
happen if, for example, water were added to one of the
chambers in Figure 1.4. As soon as the water level in the

FIGURE 1.4 Diffusion in solutions is usually associated
with the directed movement of a solute molecule from a
region of high concentration to a region of lower concen-
tration, due to the random thermal motion of the solute
molecules. Initially at time 0 (t0), there is a much higher
probability that a solute molecule in chamber A will pass
through the open window into chamber B. After a certain
time (t1), the number of solute molecules in chamber B
will increase and the number in chamber A will decrease.
This will continue until the molecules are uniformly
distributed between the two chambers. At that point,
the probability of solute molecules passing between the
chambers in either direction will be equal and net diffu-
sion will cease. Note, the dotted line indicates that there
is no change in volume in either chamber A or B, due to
the diffusion of the solute molecule.

over into the second chamber—an example of bulk ﬂow.
Alternatively, suppose that we separated chambers

allowed solvent molecules to pass freely between the
two chambers but not the solute molecules (Figure 1.5).
At time t0, the heights of the liquids in the columns of
chambers A and B are the same, indicating comparable
volumes. However, after time t1, the height of the liquid
in the column of chamber A has increased while the
height of the liquid in the column of chamber B has
decreased, indicating an increased volume in chamber A
and a decreased volume in chamber B. The difference
in the height of the columns (h) is a measure of
the difference in volume between the two chambers
separated by a selectively permeable membrane. The
increased volume in chamber A is due to the diffusion of
solvent (water) from chamber B to chamber A. Diffusion
of water, a process known as osmosis, will occur only
when the two chambers are separated from one another
by a selectively permeable membrane. A selectively
permeable membrane allows virtually free passage of
water and certain small molecules, but restricts the
movement of large solute molecules. Thus, all cellular
membranes are selectively permeable. Osmosis, then, is
simply a special case of diffusion through a selectively
permeable membrane.
1.6.1 PLANT CELLS CONTAIN AN
ARRAY OF SELECTIVELY
PERMEABLE MEMBRANES
Although plants, like all multicellular organisms, exhibit
a wide variation in cellular morphology and function,
these disparate cells are, in fact, remarkably alike. All
cells are built according to a common basic plan and
at least start out with the same fundamental structures.
In its simplest form, a cell is an aqueous solution of
chemicals called protoplasm surrounded by a plasma
membrane. The membrane and the protoplasm it con-
tains are collectively referred to as a protoplast. Of
course, all of the components that make up protoplasm
have important roles to play in the life of a cell, but
the plasma membrane is particularly signiﬁcant because
it represents the boundary between the living and non-
living worlds. The plasma membrane is also selectively
permeable, which means that it allows some materials
to pass through but not others. The plasma membrane
thus not only physically deﬁnes the limits of a cell; it also
controls the exchange of material and serves to maintain
essential differences between the cell and its environ-
ment. The plant protoplast is, in turn, surrounded by a
cell wall. The cell wall deﬁnes the shape of the cell and,
through adhesion to the walls of adjacent cells, provides
support for the plant as a whole.
In an electron micrograph (an image seen through
the electron microscope), membranes are a singularly
prominent feature (Figure 1.6). In addition to the plasma
membrane, other membranes are found throughout the

1.6.2 OSMOSIS IN PLANT CELLS IS
INDIRECTLY ENERGY
DEPENDENT
Water, like any other substance, will only move down an
energy gradient—that is, when there is a difference in
the energy of water in two parts of a system. In the case
of the Figure 1.5, water initially moves from chamber
B to chamber A because the energy of pure water in
chamber B is greater than the energy of the water in the
solution in chamber A. Net movement of water stops
when there is no longer an energy gradient across the
selectively permeable membrane. Why is the energy of
pure water in chamber B of Figure 1.5 greater than the
energy of the water in the solution present in chamber
A? The energy content of water, like any substance, is
most easily described in terms of its chemical potential.
Chemical potential (μ) is deﬁned as the free energy per
mole of that substance and is a measure of the capacity of
a substance to react or move. The rule is that osmosis occurs
only when there is a difference in the chemical potential (μ)
of water on two sides of a selectively permeable membrane. In
other words, osmosis occurs only when the molar free
energy of water, that is, the chemical potential of water
(μw) on one side of a selectively permeable membrane,
exceeds the molar free energy or chemical potential of
water on the other side of the same selectively permeable
membrane.
It appears that the dissolution of a solute in water in
some way affects the chemical potential and hence the
free energy of the solvent water molecules. Why is this
so? This effect is due to the fact that increasing solute
concentration in an aqueous solution decreases the mole
fraction of water in the solution. The mole fraction of
water (Xw) in a solution can be represented as
Xw = w/w + s
(1.2)
where w represents the moles of H2O in a given volume
and s the moles of solute in the same volume of solution.
Thus, as one increases s at a constant value of w, the
mole fraction of water, Xw, decreases. Remember that
the concentration of pure water is 55.5 moles L−1.
The chemical potential of water (μw) is related to the
mole fraction of water (Xw) according to the following
equation
μw = μw∗+ RT ln Xw
(1.3)
where μw* is the chemical potential of pure water under
standard temperature and pressure, R is the universal
gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This
equation tells us that as the mole fraction of water
decreases, the chemical potential and hence the molar
free energy of water decreases. Therefore, the higher
the solute concentration of an aqueous solution, the
lower the chemical potential of the solvent water. Since
energy ﬂows ‘‘downhill’’ spontaneously, water ﬂows or
diffuses spontaneously from chamber B to chamber A
due to the difference in the chemical potential of water
between the two chambers separated by a selectively
permeable membrane (Figure 1.5).
Plant cells control the movement of water in and
out of cells by altering the solute concentration of the
cytosol relative to the solution external to the cell. One
way to accomplish this is to regulate transport of ions
across the cell membrane into or out of the cell. For
example, root cells can take up nitrate ions NO−
3 from
the soil by active transport to create a NO−
3 ion gradient
across the cell membrane (Figure 1.7) such that
(μnitrate)in > (μnitrate)out
(1.4)
where μnitrate is the chemical potential of NO−
3 . There-
fore, it follows that
μnitrate = (μnitrate)in −(μnitrate)out
(1.5)
Since μnitrate > 0, the uptake of NO−
3 is an active
transport process that requires an input of energy. Con-
comitantly, the increase in cytosolic NO−
3 decreases the
mole fraction of water in the cytosol relative to the mole

FIGURE 1.7 Water movement in plant cells requires
solute gradients. For example, soil nitrate (NO−
3 ) is
actively transported across the selectively permeable cell
membrane into plant root cells. Thus, the establish-
ment of a solute gradient such that chemical potential
of nitrate is higher in the cytosol than in the soil water
requires an input of metabolic energy. The higher con-
centration of nitrate in the cytosol than the soil water
also establishes a gradient for the chemical potential of
water such that the chemical potential of the soil water
is greater than the chemical potential of cytosolic water.
As a consequence, water diffuses passively from the soil
across the cell membrane into the cell.
fraction of water in the soil water. Therefore, it follows
that
μw = (μw)in −(μw)out
(1.6)
Since μw < 0, water will diffuse spontaneously into
the cell (Figure 1.7).
The chemical potential of water (μw) is particularly
useful in the study of cellular and plant water relations
because it deﬁnes the amount of work that can be done
by water in one location, for example, a cell or vacuole,
compared with pure water at atmospheric pressure and
the same temperature. More importantly, a difference
in μw between two locations means that water is not in
equilibrium and there will be a tendency for water to
ﬂow toward the location with the lower value. At this
point, then, it can be said that the driving force for water
movement is a gradient in chemical potential. Clearly,
the tendency for water to ﬂow from a location where the
μw is high to a location where the μw is lower will occur
spontaneously and does not require energy because
μw < 0 (Figure 1.7). However, the only way plant
cells can regulate the movement of water is through
the establishment of solute concentration gradients
across the selectively permeable cell membrane; that
is, the movement of water may be coupled to solute
transport (Figure 1.7). Although the ﬂow of water is
passive (μw < 0), the movement of solutes requires
active transport, which is energy dependent (μnitrate
> 0). Thus, osmosis is indirectly dependent on energy
through the requirement of solute concentration gradi-
ents that alter the chemical potential of water. Since the
cell membrane is permeable only to water (Figure 1.7),
only the water diffuses freely across the cell membrane.
The process of regulating the water status of a plant
cell by the accumulation of solutes is known as osmotic
adjustment, which is an energy-requiring process.
1.6.3 THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL OF
WATER HAS AN OSMOTIC AS
WELL AS A PRESSURE
COMPONENT
Osmosis can be easily demonstrated using a device
known as an osmometer, constructed by closing off the
open end of a thistle tube with a selectively permeable
membrane (Figure 1.8). If the tube is then ﬁlled with a
sugar solution and inverted in a volume of pure water,
the volume of solution in the tube will increase over
time. The increase in volume is due to a net diffusion of
water across the membrane into the solution.
The increase in the volume of the solution will
continue until the hydrostatic pressure developed in the

FIGURE 1.8 A demonstration of hydrostatic pressure. A
selectively permeable membrane is stretched across the
end of a thistle tube containing a sucrose solution and
the tube is inverted in a container of pure water. Initially,
water will diffuse across the membrane in response to
a chemical potential gradient. Diffusion will continue
until the force tending to drive water into the tube is
balanced by (A) the force generated by the hydrostatic
head (h) in the tube or (B) the pressure applied by the
piston. When the two forces are balanced, the system has
achieved equilibrium and no further net movement of
water will occur.

10
Chapter 1 / Plant Cells and Water
tube is sufﬁcient to balance the force driving the water
into the solution (Figure 1.8A). Alternatively, the tube
could be ﬁtted with a piston that would allow us to
measure the amount of force required to just prevent
any increase in the volume of solution (Figure 1.8B).
This force, measured in units of pressure (force per
unit area), is known as osmotic pressure (symbol =
π; pi). The magnitude of the osmotic pressure that
develops is a function of solute concentration, at least
in dilute solutions. It is useful to note that an isolated
solution cannot have an osmotic pressure. It has only
the potential to manifest a pressure when placed in an
osmometer. For this reason, we say that the solution
has an osmotic potential (symbol = S). It is conven-
tion to deﬁne osmotic potential as the negative of the
osmotic pressure, since they are equal but opposite forces
(S = −π).
Whereas simple diffusion is driven entirely by dif-
ferences in mole fractions of the solvent, it is apparent
from Figure 1.8 that pressure is also a factor in deter-
mining both the direction and rate of water movement
in an osmometer. Sufﬁcient pressure applied to the pis-
ton (Figure 1.8B) will prevent further net movement
of water into the solution. If additional pressure were
applied, we might expect the net movement of water to
reverse its direction and instead ﬂow out of the solution.
Thus, osmosis is driven not only by the mole fraction of
dissolved solute but by pressure differences as well. Both
of these factors inﬂuence the overall chemical potential
of water, which is the ultimate driving force for water
movement in plants.
The effect of pressure on chemical potential is
represented by the value VP. V is the partial molal
volume, or the volume occupied by one mole of the
chemical species. Since one liter (= 10−3 m3) of water
contains 55.5 moles, Vw = (1000/55.5) or 18 ml per mole
(= 18000 mm3 mol−1) of water. P is the pressure. Mea-
surements in plant physiology are commonly made at
atmospheric pressure but the presence of relatively rigid
cell walls allows plant cells to develop signiﬁcant hydro-
static pressures. Hence it is convention to express P
as the difference between actual pressure and atmo-
spheric pressure. The inﬂuence of pressure on chemical
potential can now be added to equation 1.3:
μw = μw∗+ RT ln Xw + VwP
(1.7)
The chemical potential of water may also be inﬂuenced
by electrical potential and gravitational ﬁeld. In spite
of its strong dipole nature, the net electrical charge for
water is zero and so the electrical term can be ignored.
This is why we talk about the chemical potential of
water rather than its electrochemical potential. While the
gravitational term may be large and must be considered
where water movement in tall trees is concerned, it
is not signiﬁcant at the cellular level. Where water
movement involves heights of 5 to 10 meters or less, the
gravitational term is commonly omitted.
Since μw = μw* under very dilute conditions, it
follows from Equation 1.7 that
PVw = −RT ln Xw
(1.8)
Substituting π for P, we obtain the formal deﬁnition of
osmotic pressure (Equation 1.10):
πVw = −RT ln Xw
(1.9)
or
π = −RT ln XwVw
−1
(1.10)
As a matter of convenience, the value of Xw for pure
water is arbitrarily designated as unity (= 1). Conse-
quently, X w for a solution is always less than 1. Thus,
equation 1.10 tells us that addition of solute decreases
the value of Xw, which in turn increases the osmotic
pressure, π. By substituting equation 1.9 in equation 1.7,
we can now arrive at an expression relating the chemi-
cal potential of water, hydrostatic pressure and osmotic
pressure:
μw = μw∗+ Vw(P −π)
(1.11)
According to equation 1.11, the extent to which the
chemical potential of water in a solution (μw) differs
from that of pure water under conditions of standard
temperature and pressure (μ∗
w) is a function of an osmotic
component (π) and a pressure component (P).
Osmotic pressure or osmotic potential is one of
the four colligative properties of a solution. Since the
magnitude of the osmotic pressure or osmotic potential
exhibited by any solution is dependent on the number of
particles present in solution, osmotic pressure (π) and
therefore osmotic potential (S) is a colligative property.
Thus, a solution of 0.5 M CaCl2 (Equation 1.12) will
exhibit a greater osmotic pressure than a solution of
0.5 M NaCl (Equation 1.13) because the former solution
will exhibit twice as many Cl−ions present as the latter
at the same concentration.
CaCl2 →Ca2+ + 2Cl−
(1.12)
NaCl →Na+ + Cl−
(1.13)
The other three colligative properties of solutions are
freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and
the lowering of the vapor pressure of the solvent.
Because π is directly proportional to the solute
molal concentration (moles of solute in 1 L of solvent),
π can be used to calculate the molecular mass of the
solute molecule. According to the Ideal Gas Law,
PV = nRT
(1.14)
where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the moles
of the gaseous molecule, R is the universal gas constant,
and T is the absolute temperature. Thus, for an ideal,
dilute solution
πV = nRT
(1.15)

1.8 Water Potential is the Sum of its Component Potentials
11
or
π = nRT V−1
(1.16)
where π is the osmotic pressure of the solution, V is
the volume, n is the moles of solute in the solution,
R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. Since n = mass (m)/molecular mass (M),
it follows that
π = m M−1RT V−1
(1.17)
Thus, by knowing the mass of the solute (m) dissolved
in one liter (V−1), one can measure π experimentally for
this solution and subsequently calculate the molecular
mass of the solute. Furthermore, if one knows the
molecular mass of the solute, equation 1.17 allows
one to calculate the osmotic pressure (π) and hence the
osmotic potential of a solution. Note that the solute
must be perfectly soluble in water in order to use this
method to determine either the molecular mass of the
solute or the osmotic pressure of the solution.
1.7 HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
AND OSMOTIC PRESSURE
ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF
WATER POTENTIAL
It is usually more convenient to measure relative values
than it is to measure absolute values. The absolute
chemical potential of water in solutions is one of those
quantities that is not conveniently measured. However,
equation 1.11 canbe rearranged as:
(μw −μw∗)V−1
w = P −π
(1.18)
Although the value of (μw −μ∗
w) is more easily mea-
sured, the task of plant physiologists was simpliﬁed even
further when, in 1960, R. O. Slatyer and S. A. Taylor
introduced the concept of water potential (symbol-
ized by the Greek uppercase psi, ). Water potential is
proportional to (μw −μ∗
w) and can be deﬁned as:
 = (μw −μw∗)V−1
w = P −π
(1.19)
or simply:
 = P −π
(1.20)
where P is the hydrostatic pressure and π is the osmotic
pressure.
The concept of water potential has been widely
accepted by plant physiologists because it avoids the
difﬁculties inherent in measuring chemical potential.
Instead, it enables experimenters to predict the behavior
of water on the basis of two easily measured quantities, P
and π. It also makes it possible to express water potential
in units of pressure (pascals), which is more relevant
to soil-plant-atmosphere systems than units of energy
(joules). This distinction is not trivial. In practice it is far
easier to measure pressure changes than it is to measure
the energy required to affect water movement. Finally,
we can restate the driving force for water movement
as the water potential gradient; that is, water will move
from a region of high water potential to a region of
lower water potential. As we shall see, however, water
potentials are usually negative. This means that water
moves from a region of less negative water potential to
a region where the water potential is more negative.
In the same way that the chemical potential of water
in a solution is measured against that of pure water,
water potentials of solutions are also measured against
a reference. For water potential, the reference state is
arbitrarily taken as pure water at atmospheric pressure.
Under these conditions there is neither hydrostatic pres-
sure nor dissolved solutes; that is, both P and π are zero.
According to equation 1.20, the value of  for pure
water is therefore also zero.
1.8 WATER POTENTIAL IS THE
SUM OF ITS COMPONENT
POTENTIALS
Water potential may be also be deﬁned as the sum of its
component potentials:3
 = P + S
(1.21)
The symbol P represents the pressure potential. It is
identical to P and represents the hydrostatic pressure in
excess of ambient atmospheric pressure. The term S
represents the osmotic potential. Note the change in sign
(π = −S). As pointed out earlier, osmotic potential
is equal to osmotic pressure but carries a negative sign.
Osmotic potential is also called solute potential (hence
the designation S) because it is the contribution due to
dissolved solute. The term osmotic (or solute) potential is
preferred over osmotic pressure because it is more properly
a property of the solution.
We can see from equation 1.21 that hydrostatic
pressure and osmotic potential are the principal factors
contributing to water potential. A third component,
the matric potential (M), is often included in the
equation for water potential. Matric potential is a
result of the adsorption of water to solid surfaces. It
is particularly important in the early stages of water
uptake by dry seeds (called imbibition) and when
considering water held in soils (Chapter 3). There is
also a matric component in cells, but its contribution to
water potential is relatively small compared with solute
component. It is also difﬁcult to distinguish the matric
component from osmotic potential. Consequently,
3Students reading further in the literature will ﬁnd that a
variety of conventions, names, and symbols have been used to
describe the components of water potential. These
differences are for the most part superﬁcial, but careful
reading is required to avoid confusion.

12
Chapter 1 / Plant Cells and Water
matric potential may be excluded for purposes of the
present discussion. We will return to matric potential
when we discuss soil water in Chapter 3.
Returning to equation 1.21, wecan see that an
increase in hydrostatic pressure or osmotic potential
will increase water potential while a decrease in the
pressure or osmotic potential (more negative) lowers it.
We can use these changes to explain what happened
earlier in our example of the osmometer (Figure 1.8).
The dissolved sucrose generated an osmotic potential
in the thistle tube, thereby lowering the water potential
of the solution ( < 0) compared with the pure water
( = 0) on the other side of the membrane. Water
thus diffused across the membrane into the solution.
As the volume of the solution increased, a hydrostatic
pressure developed in the thistle tube. When the pos-
itive hydrostatic pressure was sufﬁcient to offset the
negative osmotic potential, the water potential of the
solution was reduced to zero. At that point  = 0 on
both sides of the membrane and there was no further
net movement of water. It is also interesting to note
that where volume in the osmometer is permitted to
increase, the osmotic potential will decrease. This is
because along with the volume change accompanying
diffusion of water into the solution, the mole fraction of
water would also increase. In effect, the solute concen-
tration decreases due to dilution. At equilibrium, then,
the osmotic potential of the solution would be higher
(i.e., less negative) than at the beginning. In the end the
pressure required to balance osmotic potential is less
than what would have been required had the volume
increase not occurred. Because the contribution of S
to water potential is always negative, water will, at con-
stant pressure, always move from the solution with the
higher (less negative) osmotic potential to the solution
with the lower (more negative) osmotic potential.
We can now ask what contributes to the osmotic
and pressure potentials, and thus water potential, in
plant cells. The osmotic potential of most plant cells
is due primarily to the contents of the large central
vacuole. With the exception of meristematic and cer-
tain other highly specialized cells, cell vacuoles contain
on the order of 50 to 80 percent of the cellular water
and a variety of dissolved solutes. These may include
sugars, inorganic salts, organic acids, and anthocyanin
pigments. Most of the remaining cellular water is located
in the cell wall spaces, while the cytoplasm accounts for
as little as 5 to 10 percent. Methods for determining
the osmotic potential of cells and tissues do not gener-
ally discriminate between the cytoplasmic and vacuolar
contributions—the result is an average of the two. The
osmotic potential of a parenchyma cell is typically in the
range of −0.1 to −0.3 MPa, the largest part of which is
due to dissolved salts in the vacuole.
In a laboratory osmometer, pressure (P) can be
estimated as the difference between atmospheric pres-
sure (0.1 MPa) and the hydrostatic pressure generated
by the height of the water column. In cells, the pressure
component arises from the force exerted outwardly
against the cell walls by the expanding protoplast. This
is known as turgor pressure. An equal but opposite
inward pressure, called wall pressure, is exerted by
the cell wall. A cell experiencing turgor pressure is said
to be turgid. A cell that experiences water loss to the
point where turgor pressure is reduced to zero is said
to be ﬂaccid. Instruments are available for measuring
P directly in large algal cells, but in higher plants
it is usually calculated as the difference between
water potential and osmotic potential. In nonwoody
herbaceous plants, turgor pressure is almost solely
responsible for maintaining an erect habit. Indeed, one
of the ﬁrst outward signs of water deﬁcit in plants is the
wilting of leaves due to loss of turgor in the leaf cells.
1.9 DYNAMIC FLUX OF H2O IS
ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES
IN WATER POTENTIAL
The water status of plant cells is constantly changing as
the cells adjust to ﬂuctuations in the water content of the
environment or to changes in metabolic state. Incipient
plasmolysis is the condition in which the protoplast
just ﬁlls the cell volume. At incipient plasmolysis, the
protoplast exerts no pressure against the wall but neither
is it withdrawn from the wall. Consequently, turgor
pressure (P) is zero and the water potential of the
cell (cell) is equal to its osmotic potential (S). When
the cell is bathed by a hypotonic4 solution such as
pure water ( = 0), water will enter the cell as it
moves down the water potential gradient. This causes
simultaneously a small dilution of the vacuolar contents
(with a corresponding increase in osmotic potential) and
the generation of a turgor pressure. Net movement of
water into the cell will cease when the osmotic potential
of the cell is balanced by its turgor pressure and, by
equation 1.21, the water potential of the cell is therefore
also zero. When the cell is bathed by a hypertonic
solution, which has a more negative osmotic potential
than the cell, the water potential gradient favors loss of
water from the cell. The protoplast then shrinks away
from the cell wall, a condition known as plasmolysis.
Continued removal of water concentrates the vacuolar
contents, further lowering the osmotic potential. Turgor
4A solution with a lower solute content than a cell or another
solution and, hence, less negative osmotic potential, is
referred to as hypotonic. A hypertonic solution has a higher
solute content and more negative osmotic potential. A
solution with an equivalent osmotic potential is known as
isotonic.

1.10 Aquaporins Facilitate the Cellular Movement of Water
13
pressure remains at zero and the water potential of the
cell is determined solely by its osmotic potential. In
either situation described above, the water potential of
the cell is determined as the algebraic sum of the turgor
pressure and osmotic potential (Equation 1.21).
In addition to water movement between cells and
their environment, diffusion down a water potential gra-
dient can also account for water movement between cells
(Figure 1.9). Individual cells in a series may experience
different values for S and P, depending on the spe-
ciﬁc circumstances of each cell. Nonetheless, water will
ﬂow through the series of cells so long as a continuous
gradient in water potential is maintained.
The phenomena of plasmolysis and wilting are
superﬁcially the same, but there are some important
differences. Plasmolysis can be studied in the labora-
tory simply by subjecting tissues to hypertonic solutions
and observing protoplast volume changes under the
microscope. As plasmolysis progresses, protoplast vol-
ume progressively decreases, and the protoplast pulls
away from the cell wall. The void between the outer pro-
toplast surface (the plasma membrane) and the cell wall
will become ﬁlled with external solution, which read-
ily penetrates the cell wall. For this reason, plasmolysis
does not normally give rise to a signiﬁcant negative pres-
sure (or tension) on the protoplast. Plasmolysis remains
essentially a laboratory phenomenon and, with the pos-
sible exception of conditions of extreme water stress or
saline environments, seldom occurs in nature. Wilting,
on the other hand, is the typical response to dehydration
in air under natural conditions. Because of its extreme
surface tension, water in the small pores of the cell wall
resists the entry of air and the collapsing protoplast
maintains contact with the cell wall. This tends to pull
the wall inward and substantial negative pressures may
develop. The water potential of wilted cells becomes
even more negative as it is the sum of the negative
osmotic potential plus the negative pressure potential.
1.10 AQUAPORINS FACILITATE
THE CELLULAR MOVEMENT
OF WATER
Porins are a class of membrane proteins that belong
to a large family of proteins called major intrinsic
proteins (MIPs) that are found in the cell membranes
of all living organisms including plants, microorgan-
isms, and animals. Porin-type channels are nonselective
cation channels which are characterized by a β-pleated
sheet protein structure. In plants, porins are gener-
ally restricted to the outer membranes of mitochondria
and chloroplasts and account for their highly perme-
able properties. In contrast, aquaporins are membrane
protein channels or pores controlling the selective move-
ment of water primarily. This is indicated by the fact
that the presence of aquaporins does not affect the
electrical conductance of a membrane which indicates
that small ions such as H+ are not conducted by these
membrane channels. The results of genome sequencing
indicate that Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits 35 aquaporin
gene homologs and 33 homologues have been detected
in the rice genome. Thus, plants exhibit a multiplicity of
aquaporin isoforms which, in part, reﬂects the multiplic-
ity of internal membrane types in which these channels
are localized within a plant cell (Figure 1.10A). For
example, 13 homologues have been detected in plant
plasma membranes of Arabidopsis and are designated
PIPs for plasma membrane intrinsic proteins whereas
the tonoplast membrane, which surrounds the inner
vacuole of plant cells, exhibits 10 homologues and are
designated TIPs.
The structure of aquaporins is highly conserved
between plants, microbes, and animals. Four subunits
(tetramers) associate to form a single plant aquaporin.
Each subunit has a molecular mass of 23 to 31 kDa
and spans the membrane with six α-helices joined by

FIGURE 1.10 (A) Plant aquaporins are found in the plasma membrane (PIPs) as well
as the tonoplast membrane (TIPs) of the vacuole to regulate cellular water ﬂow.
(B) Each of the four subunits of a plant aquaporin spans the membrane six times. Both
the N-terminus (N) and C-terminus (C) are located in the cytoplasm. (C) Aquaporins
enhance water ﬂow (thick arrow) and because they are gated allow the cell to reg-
ulate cellular ﬂow compared to water ﬂow through pure lipid bilayers (thin arrow).
The interior of the aquaporin channel contains hydrophilic amino acids, which inter-
act with water, whereas the exterior of the protein channel consists of hydrophobic
amino acids, which interact with the lipid fatty acids of the membrane bilayer.

5 intervening loops (Figure 1.10B) in contrast to the
β-pleated sheet structure of porins. These protein sub-
units fold within the membrane such that the hydropho-
bic amino acids are on the outer side of the pore and
interact with the hydrophobic fatty acids of the lipid
bilayer whereas the hydrophilic amino acids are in the
inner side of the pore and interact with water molecules
as they move through the pore from one side of the
membrane to the other. Aquaporins can be open or
closed to regulate the movement of water across the
membrane. Gating is the term used to describe this reg-
ulated opening and closing of these protein channels.
Gating through PIPs can be controlled by cytoplasmic
pH, the concentration of divalent cations such as Ca2+
as well as by aquaporin protein phosphorylation.
As discussed above, lipid bilayers are quite perme-
able to water. Thus, there are two possible pathways
for the movement of water across a membrane—one
pathway through the lipid bilayer itself and the second
pathway through an aquaporin (Figure 1.10C). If this
is so, why does a cell require any aquaporins at all?
The results of recent experiments clearly indicate that
the rate of water movement through a lipid bilayer with
aquaporins is faster than a membrane that contains lipids
only. Thus, the presence of aquaporins provides a low
resistance pathway for the movement of water across
a membrane. Furthermore, since aquaporins are gated,
this provides greater control for the movement of water
intracellularly as well as intercellularly. For example,
the water permeability of the tonoplast is two orders of
magnitude (102 times) greater than that of the plasma
membrane. Thus, this allows the vacuole to replenish or
buffer the cytoplasm with water when the cell is exposed
to hypertonic conditions. Thus, aquaporins are impor-
tant in regulating the osmotic properties of plant cells.
This process is called osmoregulation.
1.11 TWO-COMPONENT
SENSING/SIGNALLING
SYSTEMS ARE INVOLVED
IN OSMOREGULATION
Plants, green algae, fungi, as well as prokaryotic
organisms (bacteria, cyanobacteria) have cell walls and
thus are sensitive to turgor pressure. These organisms
must be initially able to sense and then subsequently
respond accordingly at the physiological, biochemical,
and genetic level in order to ensure daily survival as
well as seasonal changes in their aqueous environment.
These organisms have evolved sophisticated sensing
and signaling strategies to respond to changes in their
abiotic environment. This strategy generally employs,
ﬁrst, a sensing mechanism, which can usually detect
changes in speciﬁc environmental parameters (e.g., tem-
perature, pressure, light quality, irradiance). A change
in an environmental parameter will usually activate a
speciﬁc sensor that will generate a speciﬁc intracellular
signal. Second, the sensor is usually linked to or coupled
to a transducing mechanism, which propagates the
signal generated by the sensor and subsequently elicits
a speciﬁc cellular response.Two-component systems
are examples of such sensory signaling mechanisms and
were ﬁrst discovered in prokaryotes. All two-component
systems consist of a transmembrane sensor protein
located in the cell membrane and a cytoplasmic protein
called the response regulator (Figure 1.11). The
sensor protein detects an environmental signal and
transmits this signal to the response regulator located
in the cytoplasm. The response regulator mediates
the cellular response to the external signal by DNA
binding or other regulatory functions that provide
transcriptional control over one or more target genes.
Thus, response regulators are typically DNA-binding
proteins or transcriptional factors.
An osmosensor is a device that is able either to
detect changes in the chemical potential of extracellu-
lar water (μH2O) directly or to detect the mechanical
perturbations to the cell membrane as a consequence
of changes in turgor pressure due to the differences in
osmotic potential (S) between the external aqueous
environment and the cytosol. In the heterotrophic bac-
terium, Escherichia coli, a two-component system made
up of a sensor, EnvZ, and a response regulator, OmpR,
enable this bacterium to sense changes in external osmo-
larity. EnvZ and OmpR form an osmosensing/signal
transduction pathway that responds to (μH2O) by reg-
ulating the relative transcription of genes encoding two
pore proteins, OmpF and OmpC. Both proteins form
pores in the outer membrane that control cell membrane
permeability. Although the total amount of both OmpF
and OmpC remains relatively constant in response to
μH2O, the relative proportions of OmpF : OmpC
changes with changes in μH2O. Under conditions of
low external osmolarity the expression of the larger
OmpF pores are favored, whereas under high external
osmolarity the expression of the smaller OmpC pores
are favored. As a consequence, the permeability of the
bacterial cell membrane is altered.
Several two-component sensing/signal transduc-
tion pathways have been reported in both plants and
fungi. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histidine
kinase SLN1 acts as a transmembrane osmosensor.
The involvement of a two-component, histidine kinase
osmosensing system (ATHK1) has been described
recently in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transforming yeast
cells, in which the SLN1 gene was inactivated, with the
plant ATHK1 gene restored the ability of the yeast cells
to sense and transduce a signal of changes in external
osmolarity (μH2O). The accumulation of ATHK1
mRNA in Arabidopsis is tissue speciﬁc with highest
levels observed in root tissue. Furthermore, the high

FIGURE 1.11 A general model illustrating two-component sensory signaling. (A)
Two-component systems contain a transmembrane-bound protein sensor that
exhibits an extracellular and intracellular domain. The intracellular domain exhibits
a histidine kinase enzyme activity, which phosphorylates a speciﬁc histidine residue
(HIS) within the intracellular domain of the sensor. The intracellular domain of the
sensor is capable of interacting with a cytoplasmic response regulator protein, which
may be a transcriptional activator and thus has DNA-binding activity. (B) The stimu-
lation of the transmembrane sensor by an extracellular signal causes a conformational
change in the extracellular domain of the membrane sensor, which activates the histi-
dine kinase activity to autophosphorylate the intracellular domain of the sensor using
ATP. (C) Subsequently, the sensory information ﬂows from a membrane-bound sen-
sor to a response regulator located in the cytoplasm. The phosphate group on the
sensor histidine is transferred to an aspartyl group (ASP) on the response regula-
tor. This relaxes the conformational of the transmembrane sensor but activates the
DNA-binding activity of the response regulator. The binding of the phosphorylated
response regulator to DNA leads to an alteration in the expression of a speciﬁc gene
or gene families in response to the extracellular signal. The response regulator also
exhibits protein phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates the ASP group of the
response regulator and inhibits its DNA-binding activity.

external salt concentrations stimulate the expression of
ATHK1 in the roots of Arabidopsis. The high level of
expression of ATHK1 in root tissue combined with its
sensitivity to external salt concentrations suggest that
the histidine kinase ATHK1, is part of a two-component
signal transduction system efﬁcient in osmosensing.
SUMMARY
Water has numerous chemical and physical properties
that make it particularly suitable as a medium in which
life can occur. Most of these properties are the result
of the tendency of water molecules to form hydro-
gen bonds. At the cellular level, water moves primarily
by osmosis, in response to a chemical potential gra-
dient across a selectively permeable membrane. The
movement of water can be predicted on the basis of
water potential. Water potential is a particularly useful
concept because it can be calculated from two readily
measured quantities: pressure and osmotic potential.
Plants derive mechanical support from the turgidity of
cells, due at least in part to the high structural strength
of cell walls. Aquaporins are gated, membrane protein
channels that regulate the permeability of cell mem-
branes to water. Two-component sensing/signalling
mechanisms play an important role in the ability of
plant cells to osmoregulate in reponse to changes in
external water potential.

Whole Plant Water Relations
The dominant process in water relations of the whole
plant is the absorption of large quantities of water from
the soil, its translocation through the plant, and its
eventual loss to the surrounding atmosphere as water
vapor. Of all the water absorbed by plants, less than
5 percent is actually retained for growth and even less
is used biochemically. The balance passes through the
plant to be lost as water vapor, a phenomenon known as
transpiration. Nowhere is transpiration more evident
than in crop plants, where several hundred kilograms of
water may be required to produce each kilogram of dry
matter and excessive transpiration can lead to signiﬁcant
reductions in productivity.
The quantitative importance of transpiration has
been indicated by a variety of studies over the years.
In his classic 1938 physiology textbook, E. C. Miller
reported that a single maize plant might transpire as
much as 200 liters of water over its lifetime— approxi-
mately 100 times its own body weight. Extrapolated to
a ﬁeld of maize plants, this volume of water is sufﬁcient
to cover the ﬁeld to a depth of 38 cm over the course
of a growing season. A single, 14.5 m open-grown sil-
ver maple tree may lose as much as 225 liters of water
per hour. In a deciduous forest, such as that found
in the southern Appalachians of the United States,
one-third of the annual precipitation will be absorbed
by plants, only to be returned to the atmosphere as
vapor.
Whether there is any positive advantage to be gained
by transpiration is a point for discussion, but the poten-
tial for such massive amounts of water loss clearly has
profound implications for the growth, productivity, and
even survival of plants. Were it not for transpiration, for
example, a single rainfall might well provide sufﬁcient
water to grow a crop. As it is, the failure of plants to
grow because of water deﬁcits produced by transpiration
is a principal cause of economic loss and crop failure
across the world. Thus, on both theoretical and practi-
cal grounds, transpiration is without doubt a process of
considerable importance.
This chapter will examine the phenomena of tran-
spiration and water movement through plants. The
principal topics to be addressed include
•
the process of transpiration and the role of vapor
pressure differences in directing the exchange of
water between leaves and the atmosphere,
•
the role of environmental factors, in particular tem-
perature and humidity, in regulating the rate of
transpirational water loss,
•
the anatomy of the water-conducting system in
plants, and how plants are able to maintain standing
columns of water to the height of the tallest trees,
and
•
water in the soil and how water is taken up by roots
to meet the demands of water loss at the other end.

Chapter 2 / Whole Plant Water Relations
2.1 TRANSPIRATION IS DRIVEN
BY DIFFERENCES IN VAPOR
PRESSURE
Transpiration is deﬁned as the loss of water from the
plant in the form of water vapor. Although a small
amount of water vapor may be lost through small open-
ings (called lenticels) in the bark of young twigs and
branches, the largest proportion by far (more than 90%)
escapes from leaves. Indeed, the process of transpira-
tion is strongly tied to leaf anatomy (Figure 2.1). The
outer surfaces of a typical vascular plant leaf are cov-
ered with a multilayered waxy deposit called the cuticle.
The principal component of the cuticle is cutin, a
heterogeneous polymer of long-chain—typically 16 or
18 carbons—hydroxylated fatty acids. Ester formation
between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of neigh-
boring fatty acids forms cross-links, establishing an
extensive polymeric network.
The cutin network is embedded in a matrix of cutic-
ular waxes, which are complex mixtures of long-chain
(up to 37 carbon atoms) saturated hydrocarbons, alco-
hols, aldehydes, and ketones. Because cuticular waxes are
very hydrophobic, they offer extremely high resistance
to diffusion of both liquid water and water vapor from
the underlying cells. The cuticle thus serves to restrict
evaporation of water directly from the outer surfaces
of leaf epidermal cells and protects both the epidermal
and underlying mesophyll cells from potentially lethal
desiccation.
The integrity of the epidermis and the overlying
cuticle is occasionally interrupted by small pores called
stomata (sing. stoma). Each pore is surrounded by
a pair of specialized cells, called guard cells. These
guard cells function as hydraulically operated valves that
control the size of the pore (Chapter 8). The interior
of the leaf is comprised of photosynthetic mesophyll
cells. The somewhat loose arrangement of mesophyll

cells in most leaves creates an interconnected system of
intercellular air spaces. This system of air spaces may
be quite extensive, accounting for up to 70 percent of
the total leaf volume in some cases. Stomata are located
such that, when open, they provide a route for the
exchange of gases (principally carbon dioxide, oxygen,
and water vapor) between the internal air space and the
bulk atmosphere surrounding the leaf. Because of this
relationship, this space is referred to as substomatal
space. The cuticle is generally impermeable to water
and open stomata provide the primary route for escape
of water vapor from the plant.
Transpiration may be considered a two-stage pro-
cess: (1) the evaporation of water from the moist cell
walls into the substomatal air space and (2) the diffu-
sion of water vapor from the substomatal space into the
atmosphere. It is commonly assumed that evaporation
occurs primarily at the surfaces of those mesophyll cells
that border the substomatal air spaces. However, sev-
eral investigators have proposed a more restricted view,
suggesting instead that most of the water evaporates
from the inner surfaces of epidermal cells in the imme-
diate vicinity of the stomata. Known as peristomal
evaporation, this view is based on numerous reports
indicating the presence of cuticle layers on mesophyll cell
walls. In addition, mathematical modeling of diffusion
in substomatal cavities has predicted that as much as
75 percent of all evaporation occurs in the immediate
vicinity of the stomata. The importance of peristomal
evaporation versus evaporation from mesophyll surfaces
generally remains to be established by direct experi-
ment. Whether the evaporation occurs principally at
the mesophyll or epidermal cell surfaces is an interest-
ing problem, reminding us that physiological processes
are often not as straightforward as they may ﬁrst appear.
The diffusion of water vapor from the substomatal
space into the atmosphere is relatively straightforward.
Once the water vapor has left the cell surfaces, it dif-
fuses through the substomatal space and exits the leaf
through the stomatal pore. Diffusion of water vapor
through the stomatal pores, known as stomatal tran-
spiration, accounts for 90 to 95 percent of the water loss
from leaves. The remaining 5 to 10 percent is accounted
for by cuticular transpiration. Although the cuticle is
composed of waxes and other hydrophobic substances
and is generally impermeable to water, small quantities
of water vapor can pass through. The contribution of
cuticular transpiration to leaf water loss varies consider-
ably between species. It is to some extent dependent on
the thickness of the cuticle. Thicker cuticles are charac-
teristic of plants growing in full sun or dry habitats, while
cuticles are generally thinner on the leaves of plants
growing in shaded or moist habitats. Cuticular transpira-
tion may become more signiﬁcant, particularly for leaves
with thin cuticles, under dry conditions when stomatal
transpiration is prevented by closure of the stomata.

2.2 The Driving Force of Transpiration is Differences in Vapor Pressure
21
2.2 THE DRIVING FORCE
OF TRANSPIRATION IS
DIFFERENCES IN VAPOR
PRESSURE
In Chapter 1, it was shown that water movement is
determined by differences in water potential. It then can
be assumed that the driving force for transpiration is the
difference in water potential between the substomatal air
space and the external atmosphere. However, because
the problem is now concerned with the diffusion of
water vapor rather than liquid water, it will be more
convenient to think in terms of vapor systems. Consider
what happens, for example, when a volume of pure water
is introduced into a closed chamber (Figure 2.2). Initially
the more energetic water molecules will escape into the
air space, ﬁlling that space with water vapor. Some of
those water molecules will then begin to condense into
the liquid phase. Eventually water in the chamber will
reach a dynamic equilibrium; the rate of evaporation
will be balanced by the rate of condensation. The air
space will then contain the maximum amount of water
vapor that it can hold at that temperature. In other
words, at equilibrium the gas phase will be saturated with
water vapor. The concentration of water molecules in a
vapor phase may be expressed as the vapor mass per unit
volume (g m−3), called vapor density. Alternatively, the
concentration may be expressed in terms of the pressure
exerted by the water vapor molecules against the ﬂuid
surface and walls of the chamber. This is called vapor
pressure (symbol = e). With an appropriate equation,
vapor density and vapor pressure are interconvertible.
However, because we are now accustomed to dealing
with the components of water potential in pressure units,
it will be more consistent for us to use vapor pressure
(expressed as kilopascals, kPa) in our discussion. We can
then say that when a gas phase has reached equilibrium
and is saturated with water vapor, the system will have
achieved its saturation vapor pressure.
The vapor pressure over a solution at atmospheric
pressure is inﬂuenced by both solute concentration and
temperature. As was previously discussed with respect to
water potential (Chapter 1), the effect of solute concen-
tration on vapor pressure may be expressed in terms of
the mole fraction of water molecules. This relationship
is given by a form of Raoult’s law, which states:
e = Xi eo
(2.1)
where e is vapor pressure of the solution, Xi is the mole
fraction of water ( = number of water molecules/number
of water molecules + number of solute molecules), and
eo is the saturation vapor pressure over pure solvent.
The actual reduction in vapor pressure due to solute
turns out to be quite small. This is because even in
relatively concentrated solutions the mole fraction of
solvent remains large. Consider, for example, a 0.5 molal
solution, which is approximately the concentration of
vacuolar sap in a typical plant cell. A 0.5 molal solution

FIGURE 2.2 Vapor pressure in a closed container. Initially (A), more molecules
escape from the water surface than condense, ﬁlling the air space with water vapor
molecules. The vaporous water molecules exert pressure—vapor pressure—against
the walls of the chamber and the water surface. At equilibrium (B) the rate of conden-
sation equals evaporation and the air is saturated with water vapor. The vapor pres-
sure when the air is saturated is known as the saturation vapor pressure. At higher
temperature (C), a higher proportion of water molecules have sufﬁcient energy to
escape. Both the concentration of water molecules in the vapor phase and the satura-
tion vapor pressure are correspondingly higher.

22
Chapter 2 / Whole Plant Water Relations
contains 1/2 mole of solute dissolved in 1,000 grams
(55.5 mol) of water. The mole fraction of water in a 0.5
molal solution is therefore 55.5/(55.5 + 0.5) = 0.991.
According to equation 2.1, the saturation vapor pressure
of a half-molal solution would be reduced by less than 1
percent compared with pure water.
Temperature, on the other hand, has a signiﬁcant
effect on vapor pressure. This is due to the effect of
temperature on the average kinetic energy of the water
molecules. As the temperature of a volume of water
or an aqueous solution increases, the proportion of
molecules with sufﬁcient energy to escape the ﬂuid
surface also increases. This in turn will increase the
concentration of water molecules in the vapor phase
and, consequently, the equilibrium vapor pressure. An
increase in temperature of about 12◦C will nearly double
the saturation vapor pressure.
According to Fick’s law of diffusion (Chapter 1),
molecules will diffuse from a region of high concen-
tration to a region of low concentration, or, down a
concentration gradient. Because vapor pressure is pro-
portional to vapor concentration, water vapor will also
diffuse down a vapor pressure gradient, that is, from
a region of high vapor pressure to a region of lower
vapor pressure. In principle, we can assume that the
substomatal air space of a leaf is normally saturated or
very nearly saturated with water vapor. This is because
the mesophyll cells that border the air space present a
large, exposed surface area for evaporation of water. On
the other hand, the atmosphere that surrounds the leaf is
usually unsaturated and may often have a very low water
content. These circumstances create a gradient between
the high water vapor pressure in the interior of the leaf
and the lower water vapor pressure of the external atmo-
sphere. This difference in water vapor pressure between
the internal air spaces of the leaf and the surrounding
air is the driving force for transpiration.
2.3 THE RATE OF
TRANSPIRATION IS
INFLUENCED BY
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The rate of transpiration will naturally be inﬂuenced
by factors such as humidity and temperature, and wind
speed, which inﬂuence the rate of water vapor diffusion
between the substomatal air chamber and the ambient
atmosphere. Fick’s law of diffusion tells us that the
rate of diffusion is proportional to the difference in
concentration of the diffusing substance. It therefore
follows that the rate of transpiration will be governed
in large measure by the magnitude of the vapor pressure
difference between the leaf (eleaf) and the surrounding
air (eair). In other words,
T α eleaf −eair
(2.2)
where T is the rate of transpiration. At the same time,
the escape of water vapor from the leaf is controlled to
a considerable extent by resistances encountered by the
diffusing water molecules both within the leaf and in
the surrounding atmosphere (Figure 2.3). Resistance is
encountered by the vapor molecules as they pass through
the intercellular spaces, which are already saturated with
water vapor, and the stomatal pores. Note that the sym-
bol for stomatal resistance indicates that it is variable,
to account for the fact that stomata may at any time be
fully open, partially open, or closed. Additional resis-
tance is encountered by the boundary layer, a layer of
undisturbed air on the surface of the leaf. The boundary
layer and its effect on tranpiration are described more
fully later in this chapter. The transpiration equation
(2.2) now requires additional terms to account for these
resistances.

principal resistances encountered by water vapor
diffusing out of a leaf. Symbols for electrical
resistance are used because resistance to water
diffusion is analogous to resistance in an elec-
trical circuit. Note the symbol for stomatal resis-
tance indicates it is variable—taking into account
the capacity of the stomata to open and close.

where rair and rleaf are resistances due to the air and the
leaf respectively. Equation 2.3 tells us that the rate of
transpiration is proportional to the difference in vapor
pressure between the leaf and the atmosphere divided by
the sum of resistances encountered in the air and the leaf.
2.3.1 WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS
OF HUMIDITY?
Humidity is the actual water content of air, which, as
noted earlier, may be expressed either as vapor density
(g m−3) or vapor pressure (kPa). In practice, however, it
is more useful to express water content as the relative
humidity (RH). Relative humidity is the ratio of the
actual water content of air to the maximum amount
of water that can be held by air at that temperature.
Expressed another way, relative humidity is the ratio
of the actual vapor pressure to the saturation vapor
pressure. Relative humidity is most commonly expressed
as RH × 100, or percent relative humidity. The effects
of humidity and temperature on the vapor pressure of
air are illustrated in Table 2.1. Air at 50 percent RH
by deﬁnition contains one-half the amount of water
possible at saturation. Its vapor pressure is therefore
one-half the saturation vapor pressure. Note also that a
10◦C rise in temperature nearly doubles the saturation
vapor pressure. Relative humidity and temperature also
have a signiﬁcant effect on the water potential of air
(Table 2.2).
As indicated earlier, the vapor pressure of the sub-
stomatal leaf spaces is probably close to saturation most
of the time. Even in a rapidly transpiring leaf the rela-
tive humidity would probably be greater than 95 percent
and the resulting water potential would be close to zero
(Table 2.2). Under these conditions, the vapor pressure
in the substomatal space will be the saturation vapor
pressure at the leaf temperature. The vapor pressure of
atmospheric air, on the other hand, depends on both
the relative humidity of the air and its temperature.
Humidity and temperature thus have the potential to
modify the magnitude of the vapor pressure gradient
(eleaf –eair), which, in turn, will inﬂuence the rate of
transpiration.

2.3.2 WHAT IS THE EFFECTS
OF TEMPERATURE?
Temperature modulates transpiration rate through its
effect on vapor pressure, which in turn affects the vapor
pressure gradient as illustrated by the three examples
in Table 2.3. In the ﬁrst example (A), assuming an
ambient temperature of 10◦C and a relative humidity
of 50 percent, the leaf-to-air vapor pressure gradient
is 0.61 kPa. This might be a typical situation in
the early morning hours. As the sun comes up, the
air temperature will increase. A 10◦C increase in
temperature (Table 2.3B), assuming the water content
of the atmosphere remains constant, will increase the
leaf-to-air vapor pressure gradient and, consequently,
the potential for transpiration, by a factor of almost
3. Note that in this example it is assumed that leaf
temperature is in equilibrium with the atmosphere.
This is not always the case. A leaf exposed to full sun
may actually reach temperatures 5◦C to 10◦C higher
than that of the ambient air. Under these circumstances,
the vapor pressure gradient may increase as much as

sixfold (Table 2.3C). As long as the stomata remain
open and a vapor pressure gradient exists between the
leaf and the atmosphere, water vapor will diffuse out
of the leaf. This means transpiration may occur even
when the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 100
percent. This is often the case in tropical jungles where
leaf temperature and, consequently, saturation vapor
pressure is higher than the surrounding atmosphere.
Because the atmosphere is already saturated, the water
vapor condenses upon exiting the leaf, thereby giving
substance to the popular image of the steaming jungle.
2.3.3 WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF WIND?
Wind speed has a marked effect on transpiration because
it modiﬁes the effective length of the diffusion path for
exiting water molecules. This is due to the existence
of the boundary layer introduced earlier (Figure 2.3).
Before reaching the bulk air, water vapor molecules
exiting the leaf must diffuse not only through the thick-
ness of the epidermal layer (i.e., the guard cells), but
also through the boundary layer. The thickness of the
boundary layer thus adds to the length of the diffusion
path. According to Fick’s law, this added length will
decrease the rate of diffusion and, hence, the rate of
transpiration.
The thickness of the boundary layer is primarily a
function of leaf size and shape, the presence of leaf hairs
(trichomes), and wind speed. The calculated thickness
of the boundary layer as a function of wind speed over
a typical small leaf is illustrated in Figure 2.4. With
increasing wind speed, the thickness of the boundary
layer and, consequently, the length of the diffusion path
decreases. In accordance with Fick’s law, the vapor pres-
sure gradient steepens and, all other factors being equal,
the rate of transpiration increases. This relationship
holds truest at lower wind speeds, however. As wind
speed increases it tends to cool the leaf and may cause
sufﬁcient desiccation to close the stomata. Either one
of these factors tends to lower the rate of transpiration.

High wind speeds will therefore have less of an effect
on transpiration rate than expected on the basis of their
effect on boundary layer thickness alone.
Boundary layer thickness can also be inﬂuenced by a
variety of plant factors. Boundary layers are thicker over
larger leaves and leaf shape may inﬂuence the wind pat-
tern. Leaf pubescence, or surface hairs, helps to maintain
the boundary layer, and thus reduce transpiration, by
breaking up the air movement over the leaf.
Given our discussion of transpiration, it is clear
that plant–water relations reﬂects the acquisition of
water from the soil through the constant loss of water
through the leaves. This apparent conundrum may lead
one to question whether transpiration offers any positive
advantage to plants. This question is addressed in Box 2.1
2.4 WATER CONDUCTION
OCCURS VIA TRACHEARY
ELEMENTS
The distinguishing feature of vascular plants is the
presence of vascular tissues, the xylem and phloem,
which conduct water and nutrients between the vari-
ous organs. Vascular tissues begin differentiating a few
millimeters from the root and shoot apical meristems
and extend as a continuous system into other organs
such as branches, leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits. In organs
such as leaves, the larger veins subdivide into smaller
and smaller veins such that no photosynthetic leaf cell
is more than a few cells removed from a small vein
ending. Xylem tissue is responsible for the transport
of water, dissolved minerals, and, on occasion, small
organic molecules upward through the plant from the
root through the stem to the aerial organs. Phloem,
on the other hand, is responsible primarily for the
translocation of organic materials from sites of synthesis
to storage sites or sites of metabolic demand (Chapter 9).
Xylem consists of ﬁbers, parenchyma cells, and
tracheary elements (Figure 2.5). Fibers are very
elongated cells with thickened secondary walls. Their
principal function is to provide structural support for
the plant. Parenchyma cells provide for storage as well
as the lateral translocation of solutes. The tracheary
elements include both tracheids and vessel elements
(Figure 2.5). Tracheary elements are the most highly
specialized of the xylem cells and are the principal
water-conducting cells. Tracheids and vessels are both
elongated cells with heavy, often sculptured, secondary
cell walls. Their most distinctive feature, however, is
that when mature and functioning, both tracheids and
vessels form an interconnected network of nonliving
cells, devoid of all protoplasm. The hollow, tubular
nature of these cells together with their extensive inter-
connections facilitates the rapid and efﬁcient transport
of large volumes of water throughout the plant.

BOX 2.1
WHY
TRANSPIRATION?
Our discussion of transpiration in this chapter has
focused on the mechanism of water loss and the
role of transpiration in the ascent of sap—a sort of
operational approach to the problem. We cannot fail to
be impressed by the amount of water that must be made
available to a plant in order to support transpiration
and the possible consequences of such water loss to
plant survival. Transpiration often results in water
deﬁcits and desiccation injury, especially when high
temperature and low humidity favor transpiration
but the soil is deﬁcient of water. This raises an
interesting and often controversial question: Is there
any positive advantage in transpiration to be gained
by the plant? It has been argued that transpiration
is required to bring about the ascent of sap, that
it increases nutrient absorption, and that it assists
in the cooling of leaves. It has also been argued
that transpiration is little more than a ‘‘necessary
evil.’’
Transpiration does speed up the movement of xylem
sap, but it seems unlikely that this is an essential require-
ment. The growth of cells alone would cause a slow
ascent of xylem sap, even in the absence of transpi-
ration. Transpiration serves only to increase the rate
and quantity of water moved and there is no evi-
dence that the higher rates are beneﬁcial. Another
argument is that, because mineral nutrients absorbed
by the roots move largely in the xylem sap, tran-
spiration may beneﬁt nutrient distribution. It is true
that minerals in the xylem sap will be carried along
with a rapidly moving transpiration stream, but the
rate-limiting step in nutrient supply is more likely to
be the rate at which the nutrients are absorbed by the
roots and delivered to the xylem. Moreover, experi-
ments with radioactive tracers have shown that minerals
continue to circulate within the plant in the absence of
transpiration.
Because transpiration involves the evaporation of
water, it can assume a signiﬁcant role in the cool-
ing of leaves. This is illustrated by the energy budget
for a typical mesophyte leaf shown in the accompany-
ing table. Because leaves are heavily pigmented, they
absorb large amounts of direct solar radiation. Some
of this absorbed solar radiation will not be utilized in
photochemical reactions, such as photosynthesis, but
will instead account for a signiﬁcant heat gain by the
leaves. Leaves also exchange infrared energy with their
surroundings, both absorbing and radiating infrared.
Overall a leaf will radiate more infrared energy than
it gains, leaving a negative net infrared exchange. This
leaves a net radiation gain in this example of 370 W
m−2, which must be dissipated by other means. One
way of dissipating the heat load is by evaporation of
water from the leaf surface, or transpiration. The latent
heat of vaporization of water is 44 kJ mol−1 and a typi-
cal mesophyte leaf might transpire at the rate of about
4 mmol of water m−2 per second. The heat energy con-
sumed by transpiration may be calculated as: (4 × 10−3
mol m−2 s−1) (44 × 10−3 J mol−1) = 176 J m−2 s−1
= 176 W m−2. In this example, transpiration can thus
account for dissipation of approximately one-half of the
net radiation balance. Dissipation of the remaining heat
is probably accounted for by convection from the leaf to
the surrounding air.

One argument raised against a signiﬁcant role for tran-
spiration is that there is seldom any clear correlation
between transpiration and plant growth. While some
plants may develop more slowly at high humidity, many
are able to complete their life cycle without apparent
harm under conditions such as 100 percent relative
humidity, where transpiration is minimal. Under such
circumstances, the supply of water and nutrients is
clearly adequate. If the leaf were not cooled by evapora-
tive water loss, other processes such as convection might
remove sufﬁcient energy to prevent the leaf reaching
lethal temperatures.
In Chapter 8, it is argued that the evolutionary
function of stomata is to ensure an adequate supply of
carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. It has been suggested
that transpiration is simply an unfortunate consequence
of this function; that is, a structure that is efﬁcient for the
diffusive uptake of carbon dioxide is equally efﬁcient for
the outward diffusion of water vapor. According to this
view, leaf structure represents a compromise between
the need to restrict desiccation of leaf cells while at the
same time maintaining access to atmospheric carbon
dioxide.

6th ed. New York, Wiley, 1982, Figure 7.18. Used by
permission of the authors.)
Tracheids are single cells with diameters in the
range of 10 to 50 μm. They are typically less than
1 cm in length, although in some species they may
reach lengths up to 3 cm. Tracheids also have thickened
secondary walls composed mainly of cellulose, hemicel-
lulose, and lignin. Because of the high lignin content,
secondary walls are less permeable to water than are the
primary walls of growing cells. On the other hand, the
additional strength of secondary walls helps to prevent
the cells from collapsing under the extreme negative
pressure that may develop in the actively transpiring
plants. Although their principal function is to conduct
water, the thickened secondary walls of tracheids also
contribute to the structural support of the plant.
The movement of water between tracheids is facil-
itated by interruptions, known as pit pairs, in the
secondary wall (Figure 2.6). During the development
of tracheids, regions that are to become pit pairs avoid
the deposition of secondary wall material. This leaves
only the middle lamella and primary walls to separate
the hollow core, or lumen, of one cell from that of the
adjacent cell. The combined middle lamella and primary
wall is known as the pit membrane. Pit membranes are
not solid but have openings (about 0.3 μm diameter) that
permit the relatively free passage of water and solutes.
The origin of these openings is not clear, but they are
thought to represent regions where cytoplasmic strands
(plasmodesmata) once penetrated the cell walls when
the cells were still alive. Bordered pit pairs have sec-
ondary wall projections over the pit area and a swollen

central region of the pit membrane called the torus.
When pressure is unequal in adjacent vascular elements,
such as when one contains an air bubble, the torus
is drawn toward the element with the lower pressure.
Pressure of the torus against the borders seals off the pit
as shown in Figure 2.6.
Successive tracheids commonly overlap at their
tapered ends. As a result, tracheids line up in ﬁles
running longitudinally through the plant. Water moves
between adjacent tracheids (either vertically or laterally)
through the pit pairs in those regions where overlap
occurs. The movement of water is no doubt facilitated
by the openings in the pit membranes.
Vessels are very long tracheary elements made up of
individual units, known as vessel members, which are
arranged end-to-end in longitudinal series. At maturity,
the end walls of the vessel members have dissolved away,
leaving openings called perforation plates. As the cell
that is to become a vessel member develops, the future
perforation area becomes thickened due to swelling of
the middle lamella (Figure 2.7). The thickened area
contains little cellulose, consisting almost entirely of
noncellulosic polysaccharides. As the cell matures and
the cytoplasm begins to break down, the unprotected
site of the perforation is attacked by hydrolytic enzymes
and dissolved away. The rest of the wall area has been

covered with ligniﬁed secondary wall materials and is
protected from degradation. In some cases, the resulting
perforation will encompass virtually the entire end wall,
leaving only a ring of secondary wall to mark the junction
between two successive vessel members (Figure 2.7). In
other cases, the plate may be multiperforate. If the per-
forations are elongate and parallel, the pattern is called
scalariform. An irregular, netlike pattern is called retic-
ulate. The perforations generally allow for a relatively
free ﬂow of water between successive vessel members.
There are no perforation plates at the ends of vessels (i.e.,
the last vessel member in a sequence), but water is able
to move laterally from one vessel to the next due to the
presence of pit pairs similar to those found in tracheids.
The size of vessels is highly variable, although they
are generally larger than tracheids. In maples (Acer sps.),
for example, vessels range from 40 μm to 60 μm in diam-
eter, while in some species of oak (Quercus sps.) diameters
may range up to 300 μm to 500 μm. (The large-diameter
vessels account for the ring porus character of spring
wood in woody species.) The length of vessels in maple
is generally 4 cm or less, but some may reach lengths of
30 cm. In oak, on the other hand, vessel lengths up to
10 m have been recorded. However, because of extensive
branching of the vascular system and the large number
of lateral connections between overlapping tracheary
elements, the xylem constitutes a single continuous,
interconnected system of water-conducting conduits
between the extremes of the plant—from the tip of
the longest root to the outermost margins of the highest
leaf.
Vessels
are
considered
evolutionarily
more
advanced than tracheids. For example, xylem tissue
in the gymnosperms, considered evolutionarily more
primitive than the angiosperms, consists entirely of
tracheids. Although tracheids do occur in angiosperms,
the bulk of the water is conducted in vessels. Also
because of their larger size, vessels are considerably
more
efﬁcient
than
tracheids
when
it
comes
to
conducting water. An empirical equation relating
ﬂow rate to the size of conduits was developed in
the nineteenth century by the French scientist Jean
L. M. Poiseuille. Poiseuille showed that when a ﬂuid is
pressure-driven, the volume ﬂow rate ( Jv) is a function
of the viscosity of the liquid (η), the difference in
pressure or pressure drop (P), and the radius of the
conduit:
Jv = P πr4/8η
(2.4)
Equation 2.4 applies to water movement in the xylem
tracheary elements because, as will be shown below, it
is driven by a difference in pressure between the soil
and the leaves. The important point to note, then, is
that the volume ﬂow rate is directly proportional to the
fourth power of the radius. The impact of this relation-
ship can be seen by comparing the relative volume
ﬂow rates for a 40-μm-diameter (r = 20 μm) tracheid
and a 200-μm-diameter (r = 100 μm) vessel. Although
the relative diameter of the vessel is 5 times that of
the tracheid, its relative volume ﬂow rate will be 625
(i.e., 54) times that of the tracheid. The high rate of
ﬂow in the larger vessels occurs because the ﬂow rate of
water is not uniform across the conduit. The ﬂow rate
of molecules near the conduit wall is reduced by fric-
tion, due to adhesive forces between the water and the
conduit wall. As the diameter of the conduit increases,
the proportion of molecules near the wall and conse-
quently subject to these frictional forces will decrease.
Put another way, the faster-moving molecules in the
center of the conduit constitute a larger proportion of
the population and the overall rate of ﬂow increases
accordingly.

The tallest-standing trees are generally found growing in
the rainforests along the Paciﬁc coast of the northwest-

The best known are the redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens)
of northern California, some of which exceed 110 m in
height. Individual specimens of Douglas ﬁr (Pseudotsuga
menziesii) have been reported in excess of 100 m and

a Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) measuring 95 m has been
located in the Carmanah Valley of Vancouver Island.
In Australia, there have been reports of Eucalyptus trees
measuring more than 130 m in height.
The forces required to move water to such heights
are substantial. Were we able to devise a sufﬁciently
long tube closed at one end, ﬁll it with water, and
invert it as shown in Figure 2.8, we would ﬁnd that
atmospheric pressure (ca. 101 kPa at sea level) would
support a column of water approximately 10.3 m in
height. To push the water column any higher would
require a correspondingly greater pressure acting on the
open surface. Clearly, elevating water to the height of
the tallest trees would require a force 10 to 15 times
greater than atmospheric, or 1.0 to 1.5 MPa. This force
would be equivalent to the pressure at the base of a
standing column of water 100 m to 150 m high.
But even a force of this magnitude would not be
sufﬁcient. In addition to the force of gravity, water mov-
ing through the plant will encounter a certain amount
of resistance inherent in the structure of the conducting
tissues—irregular wall surfaces, perforation plates, and
so forth. We can assume that a force at least equal to
that required to support the column would be neces-
sary to overcome these resistances. In that case, a force
on the order of 2.0 to 3.0 MPa would be required to
move water from ground level to the top of the tallest
known trees. How can such a force be generated? This
is a question that has long held the interest of plant
physiologists and over the years a number of theories
have been advanced. The three most prominent are root
pressure, capillarity, and the cohesion theory.
2.5.1 ROOT PRESSURE IS RELATED TO
ROOT STRUCTURE
If the stem of a well-watered herbaceous plant is cut off
above the soil line, xylem sap will exude from the cut
surface. Exudation of sap, which may persist for several
hours, indicates the presence of a positive pressure in the
xylem. The magnitude of this pressure can be measured
by attaching a manometer to the cut surface (Figure 2.9).
This pressure is known as root pressure because the
forces that give rise to the exudation originate in the
root.
Root pressure has its basis in the structure of roots
and the active uptake of mineral salts from the soil. The
xylem vessels are located in the central core of a root,
the region known as the stele. Surrounding the stele
is a layer of cells known as the endodermis. In most
roots, the radial and transverse walls of the endoder-
mal cells develop characteristic thickenings called the
Casparian band (Figure 2.10). The Casparian band is
principally composed of suberin, a complex mixture of
hydrophobic, long-chain fatty acids, and alcohols. These
hydrophobic molecules impregnate the cell wall, ﬁlling
in the spaces between the cellulose microﬁbrils as well
as the intercellular spaces between the cells. Because
it is both space-ﬁlling and hydrophobic, the Casparian
band presents an effective barrier to the movement of
water through the apoplastic space of the endodermis.
The result is that water can move into or out of the
stele only by ﬁrst passing through the membranes of the
endodermal cells and then through the plasmodesmatal
connections.

mis. (From K. Esau, Anatomy of Seed Plants, New York, Wiley, 1977. Reprinted by
permission.)
As roots take up mineral ions from the soil, the ions
are transported into the stele where they are actively
deposited in the xylem vessels. The accumulation of
ions in the xylem lowers the osmotic potential and,
consequently, the water potential of the xylem sap. In
response to the lowered water potential, water follows,
also passing from the cortical cells into the stele through
the membranes of the endodermal cells. Since the Cas-
parian band prevents the free return of water to the
cortex, a positive hydrostatic pressure is established in
the xylem vessels. In a sense, the root may be thought
of as a simple osmometer (refer to Figure 1.8) in which
the endodermis constitutes the differentially permeable
membrane, the ions accumulated in the xylem represent
the dissolved solute, and the xylem vessels are the ver-
tical tube. So long as the root continues to accumulate
ions in the xylem, water will continue to rise in the
vessels or exude from the surface when the xylem vessels
are severed.
The question to be answered at this point is whether
root pressure can account for the rise of sap in a tree.
The answer is probably no, for several reasons. To
begin with, xylem sap is not as a rule very concentrated
and measured root pressures are relatively low. Values
in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 MPa are common, which
are no more than 16 percent of that required to move
water to the top of the tallest trees. In addition, root
pressure has not been detected in all species. Finally,
it has been clearly established that during periods of
active transpiration, when water movement through the
xylem would be expected to be most rapid, the xylem
is under tension (i.e., negative pressure). Root pressure
clearly cannot serve as the mechanism for the ascent
of sap in all cases. However, root pressure could serve
to ﬁll vessels in small, herbaceous plants and in some
woody species in the spring when sap moves up to the
developing buds.
2.5.2 WATER RISE BY CAPILLARITY IS
DUE TO ADHESION AND SURFACE
TENSION
If a glass capillary tube (i.e., a tube of small diameter)
is inserted into a volume of water, water will rise in the
tube to some level above the surface of the surround-
ing bulk water. This phenomenon is called capillary
rise, or simply capillarity. Capillary rise is due to the
interaction of several forces. These include adhesion
between water and polar groups along the capillary
wall, surface tension (due to cohesive forces between
water molecules), and the force of gravity acting on the
water column. Adhesive forces attract water molecules to
polar groups along the surface of the tube. When these
water-to-wall forces are strong, as they are between
water and glass tubes or the inner surfaces of tracheary
elements, the walls are said to be wettable. As water ﬂows
upward along the wall, strong cohesive forces between
the water molecules act to pull the bulk water up the
lumen of the tube. This will continue until these lifting
forces are balanced by the downward force of gravity
acting on the water column.
The following equation can be used to calculate the
rise of water in a capillary tube where h is the
h = 1.49 × 10−5m2/r m
(2.5)
rise in meters and r is the radius of the capillary tube
in meters (m). Clearly, the calculated rise of water in
a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the radius

30
Chapter 2 / Whole Plant Water Relations
of the tube. In a large tracheid or small vessel, with a
diameter of 50 μm (r = 25 μm), water will rise to a
height of about 0.6 m. For a large vessel (r = 200 μm),
capillarity would account for a rise of only 0.08 m. On
the basis of these numbers, capillarity in tracheids and
small vessels might account for the rise of xylem sap in
small plants, say less than 0.75 m in height. However,
to reach the height of a 100 m tree by capillarity, the
diameter of the capillary would have to be about 0.15
μm—much smaller than the smallest tracheids. Clearly
capillarity is inadequate as a general mechanism for the
ascent of xylem sap.
2.5.3 THE COHESION THEORY BEST
EXPLAINS THE ASCENT OF
XYLEM SAP
The most widely accepted theory for movement of water
through plants is known as the cohesion theory. This
theory depends on there being a continuous column
of water from the tips of the roots through the stem
and into the mesophyll cells of the leaf. The theory is
generally credited to H. H. Dixon, who gave the ﬁrst
detailed account of it in 1914.
2.5.3.1 What is the driving force?
According to
the cohesion-tension theory, the driving force for water
movement in the xylem is provided by evaporation
of water from the leaf and the tension or negative
pressure that results. Water covers the surfaces of the
mesophyll cells as a thin ﬁlm, adhering to cellulose and
other hydrophillic surfaces. As water evaporates from
this ﬁlm, the air–liquid interface retreats into the small
spaces between cellulose microﬁbrils and the angular
junctions between adjacent cells. This creates very small
curved surfaces or microscopic menisci (Figure 2.11).
As the radii of these menisci progressively decrease,
surface tension at the air–water interface generates an
increasingly negative pressure, which in turn tends to
draw more liquid water toward the surface. Because the
water column is continuous, this negative pressure, or
tension, is transmitted through the column all the way to
the soil. As a result, water is literally pulled up through
the plant from the roots to the surface of the mesophyll
cells in the leaf.
The cohesion theory raises two very important
questions: (1) Is the xylem sap of a rapidly transpir-
ing plant under tension? (2) How is the integrity of very
tall water columns maintained? In the absence of any
direct evidence, the answers to these questions provide
substantial indirect support for the theory.
Except in certain circumstances, such as when root
pressure is active, pressures in the xylem are rarely
positive. On the other hand, several lines of evidence
support the conclusion that xylem water is instead under
signiﬁcant tension. First, if one listens carefully when

water–air interface (dashed lines) to retreat into the
spaces between and at the junctions of leaf mesophyll
cells. As the water retreats, the resulting surface tension
pulls water from the adjacent cells. Because the water
column is continuous, this tension is transmitted through
the column, ultimately to the roots and soil water.
the xylem of a rapidly transpiring plant is severed, it is
sometimes possible to hear the sound of air being drawn
rapidly into the wound. If severed beneath the surface
of a dye solution, the dye will be very rapidly taken
up into tracheary elements in the immediate vicin-
ity of the wound. A second line of evidence involves
sensitive measuring devices, called dendrographs, which
can be used to measure small changes in the diameter
of woody stems. Diameters decrease signiﬁcantly dur-
ing periods of active transpiration. This will happen
because the stem is slightly elastic and the tension in
the water column pulls the tracheary walls inward. In
the evening, when transpiration declines, the tension
is released and stem diameter recovers. Moreover, the
shrinkage occurs ﬁrst in the upper part of the tree, clos-
est to the transpiring leaves, when transpiration begins
in the morning. Only later does it show up in the lower
part. This observation has been conﬁrmed by experi-
ments in which a localized pulse of heat is generated in
the xylem and the ﬂow of heat away from that point is
monitored. Flow rates indicate that tensions are greater
near the top of the tree. A variety of other experiments
have demonstrated that rapidly transpiring shoots are
able to pull a column of mercury to heights greater
than can be accounted for by atmospheric pressure
alone.

2.5 The Ascent of Xylem Sap is Explained by Combining Transpiration with the Cohesive Forces of Water
31
Direct measurement of tension in xylem vessels
was made possible by the introduction of the pressure
bomb technique by P. F. Scholander. If the xylem
solution is under tension, it will withdraw from the
cut surface but can be forced back to the surface by
increasing the pressure in the chamber. With such a
device, Scholander and others have measured tensions
on the order of −0.5 to −2.5 MPa in rapidly transpiring
temperate-zone trees.
Finally, it has been observed that water potentials
near the bottom of the tree are less negative than water
potentials higher in the crown. Such a pressure drop
between the bottom and the top of the crown is con-
sistent with a tension resulting from forces originating
at the top of the tree. The weight of evidence clearly
supports the hypothesis that the xylem water column is
literally pulled up the tree in response to transpiration.
2.5.3.2 How is the integrity of the water column
maintained?
The ability to resist breakage of the
water column is a function of the tensile strength of
the water column. Tensile strength is a measure of
the maximum tension a material can withstand before
breaking. Tensile strength is expressed as force per unit
area, where the area for the purpose of our discussion
is the cross-sectional area of the water column. Tensile
strength is yet another property of water attributable
to the strong intermolecular cohesive forces, or hydro-
gen bonding, between the water molecules. The tensile
strength of water (or any ﬂuid, for that matter) is not
easily measured—a column of water does not lend
itself to testing in the same way as a steel bar or a
copper wire. The tensile strength of water will also
depend on the diameter of the conduit, the properties
of the conduit wall, and the presence of any dissolved
gases or solute. Still, a number of ingenious approaches
have been developed to measure the tensile strength of
water with fairly consistent results. It is now generally
accepted that pure water, free of dissolved gas, is able
to withstand tensions as low as −25 to −30 MPa at
20◦C. This is approximately 10 percent of the tensile
strength of copper, and 10 times greater than the −2.5
to −3.0 MPa required to pull an uninterrupted water
column to the top of the tallest trees. As noted above,
tensions in the xylem are more typically in the range
of −0.5 to −2.5 MPa for temperate deciduous trees
such as maple (Acer sps.), but may sometimes be as low
as–10 Mpa.
Because xylem water is under tension, it must re-
main in the liquid state well below its vapor pressure—
recall that the vapor pressure of water at 20◦C and
100% RH is 2.3 kPa or 0.0023 MPa (Table 2.1). A water
column under tension is therefore physically unstable.
Physicists call this condition a metastable state, a state in
which change is ready to occur but does not occur in the
absence of an external stimulus. Stability can be achieved
in a water column under tension by introducing a vapor
phase. Water molecules in the vapor phase have very
low cohesion, which allows the vapor to expand rapidly,
thus causing the column to rupture and relieve the ten-
sion. How might a vapor phase be introduced to the
xylem column? Xylem water contains several dissolved
gases, including carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen.
When the water column is under tension, there is a
tendency for these gases to come out of solution. Sub-
microscopic bubbles ﬁrst form at the interface between
the water and the walls of the tracheid or vessel, proba-
bly in small, hydrophobic crevices or pores in the walls.
These small bubbles may redissolve or they may coa-
lesce and expand rapidly to ﬁll the conduit. This process
of rapid formation of bubbles in the xylem is called
cavitation (L. cavus, hollow). The resulting large gas
bubble forms an obstruction, called an embolism (Gr.
embolus, stopper), in the conduit. The implications of
embolisms with respect to the cohesion theory are quite
serious, because a conduit containing an embolism is no
longer available to conduct water. Indeed, the poten-
tial for frequent cavitation in the xylem was raised as a
principal objection to the cohesion theory when it was
initially proposed. In order to satisfy these objections,
it was necessary to determine just how vulnerable the
xylem was to cavitation.
Early attempts to relate cavitation to tensions devel-
oped in the xylem were largely inconclusive. There
were no satisfactory methods for observing cavitation
in the xylem itself and model systems, employing glass
tubes, did not necessarily duplicate the interface con-
ditions present in plant tissues. This all changed in
1966 when J. A. Milburn and R. P. C. Johnson intro-
duced an acoustic method for detecting cavitation in
plants. In laboratory experiments with glass tubes, the
rapid relaxation of tension that follows cavitation pro-
duces a shockwave that can be heard as an audible
click. Milburn and Johnson found that similar clicks
could be ‘‘heard’’ in plant tissue by using sensitive
microphones and ampliﬁers. Each click is believed to
represent formation of an embolism in a single vessel
element.
Milburn

Johnson
studied
cavitation
in
water-stressed leaves of castor bean (Ricinus communis).
Water stress was introduced by detaching the leaf
from the plant and permitting it to wilt. As the leaf
wilted, the number of clicks occurring in the petiole
was recorded. A total of 3,000 clicks were detected,
which is approximately equal to the number of vessels
that might be expected in such a petiole. Cavitation
could be prevented by adding water to the severed
end of the petiole. Various methods that either
increased or decreased transpiration from the leaf
resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in the

32

number of clicks. These results indicate a reasonably
straightforward relationship between cavitation and
tension in the xylem, which appears to support the
cohesion theory. They further suggest that cavitation
is readily induced by water stress, a condition that
herbaceous plants might be expected to encounter on a
daily basis. A long-term study of cavitation in a stand
of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) has been conducted
using a method that measures changes in hydraulic
conductance. In its simplest form, conductance is
the inverse of resistance. Hydraulic conductance is
therefore a measure of the total capacity of the tissue
to conduct water. The acoustic method is limited to
counting the number and frequency of cavitations.
The hydraulic method, on the other hand, assesses the
impact of the resulting embolisms on the capacity of
the tissue to transport water.
During the summer growing season, embolisms
appeared to be conﬁned to the main trunk and reduced
hydraulic conductance by 31 percent. During the winter,
loss of conductance in the main trunk increased to 60
percent, while some twigs suffered a 100 percent loss! A
decline in conductance during the summer months is no
doubt attributable to water stress, as it is in herbaceous
plants. The rise in embolisms during the winter is
probably related to freeze–thaw cycles. The solubility
of gases is very low in ice; when tissue freezes, gas
is forced out of solution. During a thaw, these small
bubbles will expand and nucleate cavitation.
Problems related to cavitation are not limited to
mature trees. Newly planted seedlings often experi-
ence water stress due to poor root–soil contact and
may be vulnerable to cavitation. A recent study found
that seedlings of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)
experienced water stress and declining xylem pressure
potential when planted out. The resulting cavitation and
embolism formation in the tracheids caused a decline in
hydraulic conductance in the seedling. If the decline in
hydraulic conductance is severe enough, it can lead to
defoliation or death of the seedling.
Clearly, the effect of cavitation and embolisms on
long-term survival of plants would be disastrous if there
were not means for their removal or for minimizing
their effects. The principal mechanism for minimiz-
ing the effect of embolisms is a structural one. The
embolism is simply contained within a single tracheid
or vessel member. In those tracheary elements with
bordered pit pairs, the embolism is contained by the
structure of the pit membrane (Figure 2.12A). A differ-
ence in pressure between the vessel member containing
the embolism and the adjacent water-ﬁlled vessel causes
the torus to press against the pit border, thus pre-
venting the bubble from being pulled through. At
the same time, surface tension prevents the bubble
from squeezing through the small openings in the
perforation plates between successive vessel members

FIGURE 2.12 Diagram to illustrate how water ﬂow
bypasses embolisms in tracheids and vessels. In tra-
cheids (A), the pressure differential resulting from an
embolism causes the torus to seal off bordered pits lining
the affected tracheary element. In vessels (B), the bubble
may expand through perforation plates, but will even-
tually be stopped by an imperforate end wall. In both
tracheids and vessels, surface tension prevents the air
bubbles from squeezing through small pits or capillary
pores in the side walls. Water, however, continues to
move around the blockage by ﬂowing laterally into adja-
cent conducting elements.
(Figure 2.12B). Water, however, will continue to ﬂow
laterally through available pits, thus detouring around
the blocked element by moving into adjacent conduits.
In addition to bypassing embolisms, plants may also
avoid long-term damage by repairing the embolism.
This can happen at night, for example, when tran-
spiration is low or absent. Reduced tension in the
xylem water permits the gas to simply redissolve in
the xylem solution. An alternative explanation, partic-
ularly in herbaceous species, is that air may be forced
back into solution on a nightly basis by positive root
pressure.
The repair of embolisms in taller, woody species is
not so easily explained. As noted above, sugar maples do
recover from freezing-induced embolisms in the spring.
Maples and many other tree species also exhibit positive
xylem pressures in the spring. These pressures account
for the springtime sap ﬂow and could also serve to
reestablish the continuity of the water column. Spring-
time recovery has also been documented for grapevines,
although this is apparently due to relatively high root
pressures at this time of the year. It might be possible that
woody plants in general develop higher-than-normal

2.6 Water Loss due to Transpiration must be Replenished
33
root pressures in the spring in order to overcome win-
ter damage. Finally, most woody species produce new
secondary xylem each spring. This new xylem tissue
is laid down before the buds break and may meet the
hydraulic conductance needs of the plant, replacing
older, nonfunctional xylem.
It is clear, even on the basis of the relatively few stud-
ies that have been completed, that xylem is particularly
vulnerable to cavitation and embolism. If herbaceous
plants were unable to recover on a nightly basis or
woody species were unable to recover in the spring, their
growth and ultimate survival would be severely compro-
mised. This might lead one to question why plants
have not evolved mechanisms to lessen their effects.
Interestingly, M. H. Zimmermann turned this question
around, proposing instead that cell walls might actually
be designed to cavitate. This statement may appear to
contradict an earlier observation that surface tension
prevents the passage of embolisms through perforations
in xylem conduits, but it does not. Where a water-ﬁlled
conduit under tension is separated from an air volume
(at atmospheric pressure) by a porous wall, a concave
meniscus (the ‘‘lifting force’’) will form in the pore to
balance the negative pressure. As the pressure differen-
tial increases, the radius of the meniscus will decrease.
At a ‘‘suitable’’ tension in the xylem, the meniscus will
reach a radius less than the diameter of the pore (a frac-
tion of a μm in diameter) and will be pulled through the
pore into the water-ﬁlled conduit. The resulting bub-
ble nucleates a cavitation, which relieves the tension,
reduces the pressure differential, and prevents the fur-
ther entry of air. Results consistent with Zimmermann’s
hypothesis have been obtained through a comparison
of the pressure differences required to embolize sugar
maple stems with diameters of the pores in the pit
membranes.
Accordingly, Zimmermann’s designed leakage
hypothesis represents a kind of safety valve. Plants
appear to be constructed in such a way as to allow
cavitation when water potentials reach critically low
levels, yet still allow the ‘‘damage’’ to be repaired when
conditions improve. Water stress and, consequently,
cavitations would be expected to appear ﬁrst in leaves
and smaller branches. These localized cavitations would
serve the additional advantage of cutting off peripheral
structures while preserving the integrity of the main
stem or trunk during extended dry periods.
Roots are even more vulnerable to cavitation than
shoots, which could beneﬁt the whole plant during
periods of drought. Complete cavitation of the xylem
in the smallest roots, for example, would isolate those
roots from drying soil, reduce hydraulic conductance,
and ultimately reduce transpiration rates. This would
help buffer the water status of the stem until the drought
eased and the cavitated conduits were reﬁlled or new
growth replaced the damaged roots.
2.6 WATER LOSS DUE TO
TRANSPIRATION MUST BE
REPLENISHED
Uptake of water from the soil by the roots replenishes the
water lost as a consequence of leaf transpiration. This
establishes an integrated ﬂow of water from the soil,
through the plant, and into the atmosphere, referred to
as the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The con-
cept of a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum reinforces
the observation that plants do not exist in isolation, but
are very interdependent with their environment.
2.6.1 SOIL IS A COMPLEX MEDIUM
In order to understand interactions between roots and
soil water, a review of the nature of soils would be help-
ful. Soil is a very complex medium, consisting of a solid
phase comprised of inorganic rock particles and organic
material, a soil solution containing dissolved solutes,
and a gas phase generally in equilibrium with the atmo-
sphere. The inorganic solid phase of soils is derived from
parent rock that is degraded by weathering processes to
produce particles of varying size (Table 2.4). In addition
to the solid, liquid, and gas phases, soils also contain
organic material in varying stages of decomposition as
well as algae, bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and various
other organisms.
The clay particles in a soil combine to form com-
plex aggregates that, in combination with sand and
silt, determine the structure of a soil. Soil structure in
turn affects the porosity of a soil and, ultimately, its
water retention and aeration. Porosity, or pore space,
refers to the interconnected channels between irregu-
larly shaped soil particles. Pore space typically occupies
approximately 40 percent to 60 percent of a soil by vol-
ume. Two major categories of pores—large pores and

more than 40 percent clay particles

capillary pores—are recognized. Although there is no
sharp line of demarcation between large pores and cap-
illary pores—the shape of the pore is also a determining
factor—water is not readily held in pores larger than 10
to 60 μm diameter. When a soil is freshly watered, such
as by rain or irrigation, the water will percolate down
through the pore space until it has displaced most, if
not all, of the air. The soil is then saturated with water.
Water will drain freely from the large pore space due
to gravity. The water that remains after free (gravity)
drainage is completed is held in the capillary pores. At
this point, the water in the soil is said to be at ﬁeld
capacity. Under natural conditions, it might require
two to three days for a loam soil to come to ﬁeld capac-
ity following a heavy rainfall. The relative proportions
of large and capillary pore space in a soil can be esti-
mated by determining the water contents of the soil
when freshly watered and at ﬁeld capacity. Water con-
tent, expressed as the weight of water per unit weight
of dry soil, may be determined by drying the soil at
105◦C.
It should not be surprising that a sandy soil, with its
coarse particles, will have a relatively high proportion
of large pores. A sandy soil will therefore drain rapidly,
has a relatively low ﬁeld capacity, and is well-aerated
(Table 2.4). The pore space of a clay soil, on the other
hand, consists largely of capillary pores. Clay soils hold
correspondingly larger quantities of water and are poorly
aerated. A loam soil represents a compromise, balanc-
ing water retention against aeration for optimal plant
growth.
The water held by soil at or below ﬁeld capacity
is found in capillary channels and the interstitial spaces
between contacting soil particles, much as it is in the
cell walls and intercellular spaces of mesophyll cells in
a leaf. Soil water is therefore also subject to the same
forces of surface tension found in the capillary spaces
of mesophyll tissues, as discussed earlier. Consequently,
soil water at or below ﬁeld capacity will be under ten-
sion and its water potential will be negative. As the water
content of the soil decreases, either by evaporation from
the soil surface or because it is taken up by the roots,
the air–water interface will retreat into the capillary
spaces between the soil particles. Because water adheres
strongly to the soil particles, the radius of the meniscus
decreases and pressure becomes increasingly negative.
In principle, water movement in the soil is primarily
pressure-driven in the same manner that capillary ten-
sion in the mesophyll cells of a leaf draws water from
the xylem column. As water is removed from the soil by
a root, tensions in the soil water will draw more bulk
water toward the root. If there is an abundance of water
in the soil, these pressure differences may draw water
from some distance.
Except in highly saline soils, the solute concentra-
tion of soil water is relatively low—on the order of
10−3 M—and soil water potential is determined prin-
cipally by the negative pressure potential. As might be
expected, the uptake of water by roots occurs because of
a water potential gradient between the soil and the root.
Thus as the soil dries and its water potential declines,
plants may experience difﬁculty extracting water from
the soil rapidly enough to balance losses by transpi-
ration. Under such conditions, plants will lose turgor
and wilt. If transpiration is reduced or prevented for
a period of time (such as at night, or by covering the
plant with a plastic bag), water uptake may catch up,
turgor will be restored, and the plants will recover.
Eventually, however, a point can be reached where the
water content of the soil is so low that, even should all
water loss by transpiration be prevented, the plant is
unable to extract sufﬁcient water from the soil and the
loss of turgor is permanent. The soil water content at
this point, measured as a percentage of soil dry weight,
is known as the permanent wilting percentage. The
actual value of the permanent wilting percentage varies
between soil types; it is relatively low (in the range of
1 to 2 percent) for sand and high (20 to 30 percent)
for clay. Loam soils fall between these two extremes,
depending on the relative proportion of sand and clay.
Regardless of soil type, however, the water potential of
the soil at the permanent wilting percentage is relatively
uniform at about −1.5 MPa. Although there are some
exceptions to the rule, most plants are unable to extract
signiﬁcant amounts of water when the soil water poten-
tial falls below −1.5 MPa. In a sense, ﬁeld capacity may
be considered a property of the soil, while the perma-
nent wilting percentage is a property of the plant. The
water content of the soil between ﬁeld capacity and the
permanent wilting percentage is considered available
water, or water that is available for uptake by plants.
The range of available water is relatively high in silty
loam soils, somewhat less in clay, and relatively low in
sand. Not all water in this range is uniformly available,
however. In a drying soil, plants will begin to show
signs of water stress and reduced growth long before
the soil water potential reaches the permanent wilting
percentage.
2.7 ROOTS ABSORB AND
TRANSPORT WATER
Roots have four important functions. Roots (1) anchor
the plant in the soil; (2) provide a place for storage of car-
bohydrates and other organic molecules; (3) are a site of
synthesis for important molecules such as alkaloids and

2.8 The Permeability of Roots to Water Varies
35
some hormones; and (4) absorb and transport upward
to the stem virtually all the water and minerals taken up
by plants.
The effectiveness of roots as absorbing organs is
related to the extent of the root system. Over the years,
a number of efforts have attempted to establish the
true extent of root systems. Such studies involve careful
and often tedious procedures for excavating the plant
and removing the soil without damaging the roots.
More elaborate efforts involved construction of sub-
terranean walkways, called rhizotrons, equipped with
windows through which the growth and development
of roots could be observed. The root systems of several
prairie grasses have been examined in different types of
soils. By carefully excavating the grasses and washing
the roots free of soil, they were able to show massive
networks of roots penetrating to a depth of 1.5 m. Using
a radioactive tracer technique, it was later found the
roots of a single 14-week-old corn plant had penetrated
to a depth of more than 6 m and extended horizon-
tally as much as 5 m in all directions. Furthermore, the
measurements of the roots of a single mature rye plant
grown in a box of soil measuring 30 cm × 30 cm × 56 cm
deep have been reported. The combined length of all
roots was 623 km with an estimated total surface area
of 639 m2. Many species invest substantially more than
50 percent of their body weight in roots. Roots clearly
comprise a large proportion of the plant body, although
their importance to plants is less obvious to the casual
observer than the more visible shoot system.
2.8 THE PERMEABILITY OF
ROOTS TO WATER VARIES
A large number of anatomical and physiological studies
have established that the region of most active water
uptake lies near the root tip. Beyond this generalization,
the permeability of roots to water varies widely with
age, physiological condition, and the water status of
the plant. Studies with young roots have shown that
the region most active with respect to water uptake
starts about 0.5 cm from the tip and may extend down
the root as far as 10 cm (Figure 2.13). Little water is
absorbed in the meristematic zone itself, presumably
because the protoplasm in this zone is dense and there
are no differentiated vascular elements to carry the water
away. The region over which water appears to be taken
up most rapidly corresponds generally with the zone of
cell maturation. This is the region where vascular tissue,
in particular the xylem, has begun to differentiate. Also
in this region the deposition of suberin and lignin in the
walls of endodermal cells is only beginning and has not

yet reached the point of offering signiﬁcant resistance
to water movement.
The region of most rapid water uptake also coin-
cides with the region of active root hair development.
Root hairs are thin-walled outgrowths of epidermal cells
that increase the absorptive surface area and extend
the absorptive capacity into larger volumes of soil
(Figure 2.14). Depending on the species and envi-
ronmental conditions, root hairs may reach lengths of
0.1 mm to 10 mm and an average diameter of 10 μm. In
some species such as peanut, pecan, and certain conifers,
root hairs are rare or absent. More commonly a single
root tip may contain as many as 2,500 hairs cm−2 and
may increase the absorbing surface of the root 1.5 to
twentyfold. For two reasons, root hairs greatly increase
the contact of the root with soil water. First, their small
diameter permits root hairs to penetrate capillary spaces
not accessible to the root itself (Figure 2.14A). Sec-
ond, root hairs extend contact into a cylinder of soil
whose diameter is twice that of the length of the hair
(Figure 2.14B).

2.9 RADIAL MOVEMENT OF
WATER THROUGH THE
ROOT INVOLVES TWO
POSSIBLE PATHWAYS
Once water has been absorbed into the root hairs or
epidermal cells, it must traverse the cortex in order to
reach the xylem elements in the central stele. In princi-
ple, the pathway of water through the cortex is relatively
straightforward. There appear to be two options: water
may ﬂow either past the cells through the apoplast of the
cortex or from cell to cell through the plasmodesmata
of the symplast. In practice, however, the two pathways
are not separate. Apoplastic water is in constant equi-
libration with water in the symplast and cell vacuoles.
This means that water is constantly being exchanged
across both the cell and vacuolar membranes. In effect,
then, water ﬂow through the cortex involves both path-
ways. The cortex consists of loosely packed cells with
numerous intercellular spaces. The apoplast would thus
appear to offer the least resistance and probably accounts
for a larger proportion of the ﬂow.
In the less mature region near the tip of the root,
water will ﬂow directly from the cortex into the develop-
ing xylem elements, meeting relatively little resistance
along the way. Moving away from the tip toward the
more mature regions, water will encounter the endo-
dermis (see section 2.5.1 on root pressure). Suberization
of the endodermal cell walls imposes a permeability
barrier, forcing water taken up in these regions to pass
through the cell membranes. While the endodermis
does increase resistance to water ﬂow, it is far from
being an absolute barrier. Indeed, under conditions of
rapid transpiration the region of most rapid water uptake
will shift toward the basal part of the root (Table 2.5).
The resistance offered by the root to water uptake is
reﬂected in the absorption lag commonly observed when
water loss by transpiration is compared with absorption
by the roots (Figure 2.15). That this lag is due to resis-
tance in the root can be demonstrated experimentally.
If the roots of an actively transpiring plant are cut off
(under water, of course), there is an immediate increase
in the rate of absorption into the xylem. In some species,
absorption lag may cause a water deﬁcit in the leaves
sufﬁcient to stimulate a temporary closure of the stomata
(Figure 2.15). This phenomenon is known as midday
closure. Closure of the stomata reduces transpiration,
allowing absorption of water to catch up and the stomata
to then reopen.
Finally, although the absorption of water by roots
is believed to be a passive, pressure-driven process,
it is nonetheless dependent on respiration in the
TABLE 2.5

zones along a Vicia faba root as a function of
transpiration rate. The measured xylem tension at
the low transpiration rate was–0.13 MPa and–
10.25 MPa at the high transpiration rate. When
transpiration is low, most of the water uptake
occurs near the root tip. When transpiration is
high, the resulting increase in tension shifts the
region of uptake toward more basal regions

root cells. Respiratory inhibitors (such as cyanide or
dinitrophenol), high carbon dioxide levels, and low
oxygen (anaerobiosis) all stimulate a decrease in the
hydraulic conductance of most roots. Anaerobiosis is
most commonly encountered by plants in water-logged
soils and may lead to extreme wilting in species not
speciﬁcally adapted to such situations. The exact role
of respiration is not clear. The requirement is probably
indirect, such as maintaining the cellular integrity
and continued elongation of roots. Active uptake of
nutrient ions (Chapter 3) may also be a factor. On
the other hand, killing roots outright—for example,
by immersion in boiling water—dramatically reduces
resistance and allows water to be absorbed more rapidly
than when the roots were alive.
SUMMARY
Large amounts of water are lost by plants through
evaporation from leaf surfaces, a process known as
transpiration. Transpiration is driven by differences
in water vapor pressure between internal leaf spaces
and the ambient air. A variety of factors inﬂuence tran-
spiration rate, including temperature, humidity, wind,
and leaf structure. Water is conducted upward through
the plant primarily in the xylem, a tube-like system
of tracheary elements including tracheids and vessels.
The principal driving force for water movement in
the xylem is transpiration and the resulting tension in
the water column. The water column is maintained
because of the high tensile strength of water. Water
lost by transpiration is replenished by the absorption of
water from the soil through the root system.
CHAPTER REVIEW
1. Explain why transpiration rate tends to be
greatest under conditions of low humidity,
bright sunlight, and moderate winds.
2. Describe the anatomy of xylem tissue and
explain why it is an efﬁcient system for
the transport of water through the plant.
3. Trace the path of water from the soil, through the
root, stem, and leaf of a plant, and into the atmo-
sphere.
4. Explain how water can be moved to the top of a
100 m tree, but a mechanical pump can lift water
no higher than about 10.3 m. What prevents the
water column in a tree from breaking? Under
what conditions might the water column break,
and, if it does break, how is it reestablished?
5. Many farmers have found that fertilizing
their ﬁelds during excessively dry periods

Roots, Soils, and Nutrient Uptake
With the exception of carbon and oxygen, which are
supplied as carbon dioxide from the air, terrestrial
plants generally take up nutrient elements from the soil
solution through the root system. The root systems
of most plants are surprisingly extensive. Through a
combination of primary roots, secondary and tertiary
branches, and root hairs, root systems penetrate massive
volumes of soil in order to mine the soil for required
nutrients and water. Soil is a complex medium. It con-
sists of a solid phase that includes mineral particles
derived from parent rock plus organic material in vari-
ous stages of decomposition, a liquid phase that includes
water or the soil solution, gases in equilibrium with the
atmosphere, and a variety of microorganisms. The solid
phase, in particular the mineral particles, is the primary
source of nutrient elements. In the process of weather-
ing, various elements are released into the soil solution,
which then becomes the immediate source of nutrients
for uptake by the plant.
The soil solution, however, is very dilute (total
mineral content is on the order of 10−3 M) and would
quickly become depleted by the roots were it not con-
tinually replenished by the release of elements from the
solid phase. In one study of phosphorous uptake, for
example, it was calculated that the phosphate content of
the soil was renewed on the average of 10 times each
day. Availability of nutrient elements is not, however,
limited to the properties of the soil itself. Access to
elements is further enhanced by the continual growth
of the very dynamic root system into new, nutrient-rich
regions of the soil.
In this chapter we will examine the availability of
nutrients in the soil and their uptake by roots. This will
include
•
the soil as a source of nutrient elements, the colloidal
nature of soil, and ion exchange properties that
determine the availability of nutrient elements in a
form that can be taken up by roots,
•
mechanisms of solute transport across membranes,
including simple and facilitated diffusion and active
transport, the function of membrane proteins as ion
channels and carriers, and the role of electrochemi-
cal gradients,
•
ion trafﬁc into and through the root tissues and the
concept of apparent free space, and
•
the beneﬁcial role of microorganisms, especially
fungi, with respect to nutrient uptake by roots.
The unique situation with respect to uptake
and metabolism of nitrogen will be addressed in
Chapter 11.

Chapter 3 / Roots, Soils, and Nutrient Uptake
3.1 THE SOIL AS A NUTRIENT
RESERVOIR
Soils vary widely with respect to composition, struc-
ture, and nutrient supply. Especially important from the
nutritional perspective are inorganic and organic soil
particles called colloids. Soil colloids retain nutrients
for release into the soil solution where they are available
for uptake by roots. Thus, the soil colloids serve to
maintain a reservoir of soluble nutrients in the soil.
3.1.1 COLLOIDS ARE A SIGNIFICANT
COMPONENT OF MOST SOILS
The
physical
structure
of
soils
was
introduced
previously in the discussion of water uptake by roots
(Chapter 2). There it was noted that the mineral
component of soils consists predominantly of sand,
silt, and clay, which are differentiated on the basis
of particle size (see Chapter 2, Table 2.4). The three
components are easily demonstrated by stirring a small
quantity of soil into water. The larger particles of sand
will settle out almost immediately, leaving a turbid
suspension. Over the course of hours or perhaps days,
if left undisturbed, the ﬁner particles of silt will settle
slowly to the bottom as well and the turbidity will in
all likelihood disappear. The very small clay particles,
however, remain in stable suspension and will not
settle out, at least not within a reasonable time frame.
Clay particles in suspension are not normally visible
to the naked eye—they are simply too small. They are,
however, small enough to remain suspended. These sus-
pended clay particles can be detected by directing a beam
of light through the suspension. The suspended clay par-
ticles will scatter the light, causing the path traversed by
the light beam to become visible. Particles that are small
enough to remain in suspension but too large to go into
true solution are called colloids and the light-scattering
phenomenon, known as the Tyndall effect, is a distin-
guishing characteristic of colloidal suspensions. A true
solution, such as sodium chloride or sucrose in water, on
the other hand, will not scatter light. This is because, in a
true solution, the solute and solvent constitute a single
phase. A colloidalsuspension, onthe other hand, isa two-
phase system. It consists of a solid phase, the colloidal
micelle, suspended in a liquid phase. Light scattered by
the solid phase is responsible for the Tyndall effect.
Clay is not the only soil component that forms
colloidal particles. Many soils also contain a colloidal
carbonaceous residue, called humus. Humus is organic
material that has been slowly but incompletely degraded
to a colloidal dimension through the action of weath-
ering and microorganisms. In a good loam soil, the
colloidal humus content may be substantially greater
than the colloidal clay content and make an even greater
contribution to the nutrient reservoir.
3.1.2 COLLOIDS PRESENT A LARGE,
NEGATIVELY CHARGED
SURFACE AREA
The function of the colloidal soil fraction as a nutrient
reservoir depends on two factors: (1) colloids present
a large speciﬁc surface area, and (2) the colloidal
surfaces carry a large number of charges. The charged
surfaces in turn reversibly bind large numbers of ions,
especially positively charged cations from the soil
solution. This ability to retain and exchange cations on
colloidal surfaces is the single most important property
of soils, in so far as plant nutrition is concerned.
Because of their small size, one of the distinguishing
features of colloids is a high surface area per unit mass,
also known as speciﬁc surface area. Consider, for ex-
ample, a cube with a mass of one gram that measures 10
mm on a side. The speciﬁc surface area of this cube is
600 mm2 g−1 (Figure 3.1). If the cube is then subdivided
into particles of colloidal dimensions, say 0.001 mm on
a side, the speciﬁc surface area increases to 6,000,000
mm2g−1, a 10,000-fold increase. On a mass basis,
then, colloids provide an incredibly large surface
area for interaction with mineral elements in the soil
solution.
A second important feature of soil colloids, in addi-
tion to the large speciﬁc surface area, is the large
number of charges on the colloidal surfaces. Colloidal
clays consist primarily of aluminum silicates (the chemi-
cal formula for kaolinite, one of the simplest clays, is
Al2Si2O5(OH)4). The predominantly negative charges
arise by virtue of ionization of alumina and silica at the

edges of the clay particle. Because colloidal carbon is
derived largely from lignin and carbohydrates, it also
carries negative charges arising from exposed carboxyl
and hydroxyl groups.
3.1.3 SOIL COLLOIDS REVERSIBLY
ADSORB CATIONS FROM THE
SOIL SOLUTION
The association of cations (positively charged ions)
with negatively charged colloidal surfaces depends on
electrostatic interactions; hence, binding afﬁnity varies
according to the lyotropic series:
Al3+ > H+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = NH+
4 > Na+
In this series, aluminum ions have the highest binding
afﬁnity and sodium ions the least, reﬂecting the general
rule that trivalent ions (3+) are retained more strongly
than divalent ions (2+) and divalent ions more strongly
than monovalent ions (1+). Ions, however, are also
hydrated, which means that they are surrounded by
shells of water molecules, and electrostatic rules are
modulated by the relative hydrated size of the ion. Since
ions of smaller hydrated size can approach the colloidal
surfaces more closely, they tend to be more tightly
bound. Also, cation adsorption is not an all-or-none
phenomenon. The degree of association and ion con-
centration both decline in a continuous gradient with
increasing distance from the surface of the colloid.
Cation adsorption is also reversible. Consequently,
any ion with a higher afﬁnity (e.g., H+) is capable
of displacing an ion lower in the series (e.g., Ca2+).
Alternatively, an ion with a lower afﬁnity can, if provided
in sufﬁcient quantity, displace an ion with higher afﬁnity
by mass action (Figure 3.2). This process of exchange
between adsorbed ions and ions in solution is known as
ion exchange. The ease of removal, or exchangeability
of an ion, is indicated by the reverse of the lyotropic
series shown above. Thus, sodium ions are the most
readily exchanged in the series and aluminum ions the
least.
Although the immediate source of mineral nutri-
ents for the plant are the ions in the soil solution, the
colloidal fraction with its adsorbed ions represents
the principal nutrient reservoir. It is important to view
the soil as a very dynamic system, with cations in the
soil solution freely exchangeable with cations adsorbed
to colloidal surfaces. As the soluble nutrients are taken
up by the roots from the dilute soil solution, they are
continually replaced by exchangeable ions held in the
colloidal reservoir. The reservoir is then replenished
by ions derived from the weathering of rock parti-
cles. In this way, ion exchange at the colloidal surface
plays a major role in providing a controlled release of
nutrients to the plant. It may not always work to the
advantage of the plant, however. One effect of acid

concentration of hydrogen ions in the soil. The addi-

into the soil solution.
rain, for example, appears to be the displacement of
cations from the colloidal reservoir due to the high con-
centration of hydrogen ions. Those solubilized nutri-
ent ions not immediately assimilated by the roots are
readily leached out of the soil by the rain and percolating
ground water. Both the soil solution and the reservoir
of nutrients are depleted more rapidly than they can be
replenished and the plants are deprived of an adequate
nutrient supply. Under normal circumstances, roots also
secrete hydrogen ions, which assist in the uptake of
nutrients.
3.1.4 THE ANION EXCHANGE
CAPACITY OF SOIL COLLOIDS
IS RELATIVELY LOW
The soil colloids are predominantly negatively charged
and, consequently, they do not tend to attract negatively
charged anions. Although some of the clay minerals do
contain cations such as Mg2+, the anion exchange capa-
city of most soils is generally low. The result is that
anions are not held in the soil but tend to be read-
ily leached out by percolating ground water. This
situation has important consequences for agricultural
practice. Nutrients supplied in the form of anions, in
particular nitrogen (NO−
3 ), must be provided in large
quantity to ensure sufﬁcient uptake by the plants. As a
rule, farmers sometimes ﬁnd they must apply at least
twice—sometimes more—the amount of nitrogen actu-
ally required to produce a crop. Unfortunately, much of
the excess nitrate is leached into the ground water and
eventually ﬁnds its way into wells or into streams and

lakes, where it contributes to problems of eutrophication
by stimulating the growth of algae.
3.2 NUTRIENT UPTAKE
3.2.1 NUTRIENT UPTAKE BY PLANTS
REQUIRES TRANSPORT OF THE
NUTRIENT ACROSS ROOT CELL
MEMBRANES
In order for mineral nutrients to be taken up by a
plant, they must enter the root by crossing the plasma
membranes of root cells. From there they can be trans-
ported through the symplast to the interior of the root
and eventually ﬁnd their way into the rest of the plant.
Nutrient uptake by roots is therefore fundamentally a
cellular problem, governed by the rules of membrane
transport. Membrane transport is inherently an abstract
subject. That is to say, investigators measure the kinetics
of solute movement across various natural and artiﬁcial
membranes under a variety of circumstances. Models are
then constructed that attempt to explain these kinetic
patterns in terms of what is currently understood about
the composition and architecture of membranes. As our
understanding of membrane structure has changed over
the years, so have the models that attempt to interpret
how solutes cross these membranes. There are, how-
ever, three fundamental concepts—simple diffusion,
facilitated
diffusion,
and
active
transport—that
have persevered, largely because they have proven
particularly useful in categorizing and interpreting
experimental
observations.
These
three
concepts
now make up the basic language of transport across
all membranes of all organisms. These three basic
modes
of
transport
are
interpreted
schematically
in Figure 3.3.
3.2.2 SIMPLE DIFFUSION IS A PURELY
PHYSICAL PROCESS
According to Fick’s law (Chapter 1), the rate at which
molecules in solution diffuse from one region to another
is a function of their concentration difference. For a
membrane-bound cell, Fick’s law may be restated as:
J = PA(Co −Ci)
(3.1)
where J is the ﬂux, or amount of solute crossing the
membrane per unit time. A is the cross-sectional area of
the diffusion path, which, in this case, is the area of the
cell membrane (in cm2). P is the permeability coefﬁcient.
It measures the velocity (in cm−1) with which the solute
crosses that membrane and is speciﬁc for a particular
membrane-solute combination. Since the membrane
barrier is primarily lipid in character, nonpolar solute
molecules tend to pass through more rapidly than polar
molecules. Membrane lipid bilayers are particularly
impermeable to most ions. This is because their charge
and high degree of hydration renders ions insoluble in
lipids and thus effectively prevents them from entering
the hydrocarbon phase of membranes. Synthetic lipid
bilayers, or artiﬁcial membranes, for example, are some
nine orders of magnitude less permeable to smaller ions
such as K+ or Na+ than to water. The permeability
coefﬁcient in Fick’s equation thus generally reﬂects
the lipid solubility of diffusing molecules. Few solutes
of biological importance are nonpolar and only three
(O2, CO2, NH3) appear to traverse membranes by
simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer. Water, in
spite of its high polarity, also diffuses rapidly through
lipid bilayers; this is because water passes through

itated diffusion, or active trans-
port.

water-selective channels called aquaporins. Aquaporins
were discussed in Chapter 1.
Transport by diffusion is a passive process, mean-
ing that the transport process does not require a direct
input of metabolic energy. The energy for transport
by diffusion comes from the concentration or electro-
chemical gradient of the solute being transported. As
a consequence, transport by diffusion does not lead to
an accumulation of solute against a concentration or
electrochemical gradient.
3.2.3 THE MOVEMENT OF MOST
SOLUTES ACROSS MEMBRANES
REQUIRES THE PARTICIPATION
OF SPECIFIC TRANSPORT
PROTEINS
In the 1930s, students of membrane transport recog-
nized that certain ions entered cells far more rapidly
than would be expected on the basis of their diffu-
sion through a lipid bilayer. We now know that this
is because natural membranes contain a large number
of proteins, many of which function as transport pro-
teins. Some of these transport proteins facilitate the
diffusion of solutes, especially charged solutes or ions,
into the cell by effectively overcoming the solubility
problem. The term facilitated diffusion was coined to
describe this rapid, assisted diffusion of solutes across
the membrane. In facilitated diffusion, as in simple dif-
fusion, the direction of transport is still determined by
the concentration gradient (for uncharged solute) or
electrochemical gradient (for charged solutes and ions).
Facilitated diffusion is also bidirectional and, like sim-
ple diffusion, net movement ceases when the rate of
movement across the membrane is the same in both
directions. Two major classes of transport proteins
are known. Carrier proteins (also known as carriers,
transporters, or simply, porters) bind the particu-
lar solute to be transported, much along the lines of
an enzyme–substrate interaction. Binding of the solute
normally induces a conformational change in the carrier
protein, which delivers the solute to the other side of the
membrane. Release of the solute at the other surface of
the membrane completes the transport and the protein
then reverts to its original conformation, ready to pick
up another solute.
Channel proteins are commonly visualized as a
charged-lined, water-ﬁlled channel that extends across
the membrane. Channels are normally identiﬁed by the
ion species that is able to permeate the channel, which
is in turn dependent on the size of the hydrated ion and
its charge. Diffusion through a channel is dependent on
the hydrated size of the ion because the associated water
molecules must diffuse along with the ion. The number
of ion channels discovered in the membranes of plant
cells is increasing. Currently there is solid evidence for
K+, Cl−, and Ca2+ channels, while additional channels
for other inorganic and organic ions are strongly sug-
gested. Channel proteins are frequently gated, which
means they may be open or closed (Box 3.1). Solutes
of an appropriate size and charge may diffuse through
only when the channel ‘‘gate’’ is open. Two types of
gates are known. An electrically gated channel opens in
response to membrane potentials of a particular magni-
tude. Other channels may open only in the presence of
the ion that is to be transported and may be modulated
by light, hormones, or other stimuli. The precise mech-
anism of gated channels is not known, although it is
presumed to involve a change in the three-dimensional
shape, or conformation, of the protein.
The importance of carriers lies in the selectivity
they impart with respect to which solutes are permitted
to enter or exit the cell. Channels, on the other hand,
appear to be involved wherever large quantities of solute,
particularly charged solutes or ions, must cross the
membrane rapidly. Whereas a carrier may transport
between 104 and 105 solute molecules per second, a
channel may pass on the order of 108 ions per second. It
should also be stressed that large numbers of channels
are not required to satisfy the needs of most cells. The
rate of efﬂux through guard cell K+ channels during
stomatal closure, for example, has been estimated at
107 K+ ions sec−1—a rate that conceivably could be
accommodated by a single channel. Many carrier and
channel proteins are inducible, which means that they
are synthesized by the cell only when there is solute
available to be taken up.
3.2.4 ACTIVE TRANSPORT REQUIRES
THE EXPENDITURE OF
METABOLIC ENERGY
Many transport processes, in addition to being rapid and
speciﬁc, will lead to an accumulation of solute inside the
cell. In other words, the transport process will establish
signiﬁcant concentration or electrochemical gradients
and will continue to transport solute against those gra-
dients. The transport process involved is known as active
transport. By deﬁnition, active transport is tightly cou-
pled to a metabolic energy source—usually, although
not always, hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
In other words, active transport requires an input of
energy and does not occur spontaneously. Unlike sim-
ple and facilitated diffusion, active transport is also
unidirectional—either into or out of the cell—and is
always mediated by carrier proteins.
Active transport serves to accumulate solutes in the
cell when solute concentration in the environment is
very low. When used to transport solute out of the
cell, active transport serves to maintain a low internal
solute concentration. Because active transport systems
move solutes against a concentration or electrochemical
gradient, they are frequently referred to as pumps.

ELECTROPHYSIO-
LOGY—EXPLORING
ION CHANNELS
The exchange of ions across cellular membranes is
facilitated by the presence of transmembrane proteins
referred to as ion channels. Most ion channels are
highly speciﬁc for one or a limited number of ion
species, which can diffuse through an open channel at
rates as high as 108 s−1.
Channel proteins may exist in two different con-
formations, referred to as open and closed. In the open
conformation, the core of the protein forms a pathway
for diffusion of ions through the membrane (Figure 3.4).
A channel that can open and close is said to be gated—in
the open conformation, the ‘‘gate’’ is open and ions are
free to diffuse through the channel. When the gate is
closed, the channel is not available for ion diffusion. A
number of stimuli, including voltage, light, hormones,
and ions themselves, are known to inﬂuence the fre-
quency or duration of channel opening. The channel
protein is believed to contain a sensor that responds to
the appropriate stimulus by changing the conformation
of the protein and opening the gate.
Because ions are mobile and carry a charge,
their
movement across membranes establishes
an
electrical current. These currents, typically on the

order of picoamperes (pA = 10−12 ampere), can be mea-
sured using microelectrodes constructed from ﬁnely
drawn-out glass tubing. The ﬁrst evidence for gated
channels was based on experiments in which the elec-
trode was inserted directly into the cell (Figure 3.5).
This method has several limitations. It requires rela-
tively large cells and the results reﬂect the activities of
many different channels of various types at the same
time. Moreover, when applied to plant cells, the elec-
trode usually penetrates the vacuolar membrane as well
as the plasma membrane, thus summing the behavior of
channels in both membranes.
These problems were largely circumvented by
development of the patch clamp method that permits
the study of single ion channels in selected membranes.
In this technique, the tip of the microelectrode is placed
in contact with the membrane surrounding an isolated
protoplast (a cell from which the cell wall has been
removed) (Figure 3.6). A tight seal between the electrode
and the membrane is formed by applying a slight suction.
The small region of membrane in contact with the
electrode is referred to as the ‘‘patch.’’ Measurements
may be made in this conﬁguration, with the whole
cell attached, or, alternatively, the electrode can be
pulled away from the cell. In that case the patch

Note that the exterior surface of the membrane is

the ‘‘inside-out’’ conﬁguration). Variations in the
technique permit the orientation of the patch to
be reversed, with the internal surface facing the
electrode solution (the ‘‘outside-out’’ conﬁguration).

be measured by the patch-clamp technique. A small piece
of membrane containing a single channel can be isolated

channel carry the current, which can be measured with
sensitive ampliﬁers.
With a sufﬁciently small electrode tip (ca. 1.0 μm diam-
eter), the patch may contain a single ion channel.
With an appropriate electrical circuit, the experi-
menter can hold, or ‘‘clamp,’’ the potential difference
(voltage) across the patch at some predetermined value.
At the same time, the circuit will monitor any current
that ﬂows through the membrane patch. Typical exper-
imental results are shown in Figure 3.7. Figure 3.7A

isolated from a stomatal guard cell protoplast. For the

appearance of one small, transient current pulse. For
the upper trace, the voltage was stepped up to +90 mV.
The current trace indicates that the channel opened
immediately, in response to the voltage stimulus,
and remained open for about 50 milliseconds (ms).

Chapter 3 / Roots, Soils, and Nutrient Uptake
3.3 SELECTIVE ACCUMULATION
OF IONS BY ROOTS
The selectivity of transport proteins and the ability of
cells to accumulate solutes by active transport together
enables roots to selectively accumulate nutrient ions
from the soil solution. Selective accumulation of ions
by roots is illustrated by a typical set of data shown in
Table 3.1. Accumulation refers to the observation that
the concentrations of some ions inside the cell may reach
levels much higher than their concentration in the sur-
rounding medium. This difference in ion concentration
is expressed quantitatively by the accumulation ratio,
which can be deﬁned as the ratio of the concentration
inside the cell (Ci) to the concentration outside the cell
(Co). Note that in Table 3.1 the internal concentration
of K+ is more than 1,000 times greater than it is in
the bathing medium. In the past, an accumulation ratio
greater than 1 has been considered compelling evidence
in favor of active transport, since that solute has evidently
moved in against a concentration gradient. Conversely,
an accumulation ratio less than 1 implies that the solute
has been actively excluded or extruded from the cell.
As will be shown below, this is not always the case,
especially where charged solutes are involved. When
assessing solute uptake by cells, it is especially impor-
tant to distinguish between uncharged and charged
solutes.
Ion uptake is highly selective. Note there is virtu-
ally no accumulation of Na+ by maize roots (Table 3.1)
and accumulation ratios for K+ and NO−
3 are sub-
stantially higher than for SO2−
4 . The low concentra-
tions of Na+ in plant cells (unlike animal cells) may
result from limited uptake of Na+ in the ﬁrst place,
but also because Na+ is actively expelled from most
plant cells.

uptake is fundamentally dependent on the difference
in concentration on the two sides of the membrane.
In other words, for uncharged solutes it is the con-
centration gradient alone that determines the gradient
in chemical potential (see Chapter 1). The chemical
potential gradient (μ) can be expressed by the follow-
ing equation, where μi is the chemical potential of the
uncharged solute in the cytosol and μo is the chemical
potential of uncharged solute outside of the cell.
μ = μi −μo
(3.2)
Thus, for the uncharged solute, U, its chemical potential
gradient (μu) is represented by
μu = RT ln[Ui]/[Uo]
(3.3)
Equation 3.3 simpliﬁes to
μu = 59 log[Ui]/[Uo]
(3.4)
where Ui is the concentration of U in the cytosol and
Uo is the concentration of U outside of the cell. It is
a relatively simple matter to measure experimentally
internal and external concentrations of the solute and
thus calculate the accumulation ratio from which one
can calculate the chemical potential gradient. From
equations 3.3 and 3.4, it is clear that when Ui > Uo,
μ is a positive value, which indicates that uptake of
U must occur by energy-dependent, active transport.
On the other hand, when Ui < Uo, μ is a negative
value, which indicates that uptake of U will occur by
energy-independent, facilitated diffusion.
With charged solutes, or ions, the situation is more
complex and the accumulation ratio is not always a valid
indication of passive or active transport. Because ions
carry an electrical charge, they will diffuse in response
to a gradient in electrical potential as well as chem-
ical potential. Positively charged potassium ions, for
example, will naturally be attracted to a region with a
preponderance of negative charges. Consequently, the
movement of ions is determined by a gradient that has
two components: one concentration and one electrical.
In other words, ions will move in response to an elec-
trochemical gradient, and the electrical properties of
the cell, or its transmembrane potential, must be taken
into account.

3.4 Electrochemical Gradients and Ion Movement
47
A transmembrane potential (a voltage or potential
difference across a membrane) develops because of an
unequal distribution of anionic and cationic charges
across the membrane. The cytosol, for example, contains
a large number of ﬁxed or nondiffusible charges such
as the carboxyl (—COO−) and amino (—NH+
4 ) groups
of proteins. At the same time, cells use energy to actively
pump cations, in particular H+, Ca2+, and Na+, into
the exterior space. The resulting unequal distribution
of cations establishes a potential difference, or voltage,
across the membrane. The cytosol remains negative
relative to the cell wall space, which accumulates the
positively charged cations.
A simple example illustrates how a transmembrane
potential can inﬂuence ion movement into and out of
cells (Figure 3.8). In this example, it is assumed that
(1) the internal K+ concentration is high relative to
that outside the cell; (2) K+ can move freely across the
membrane, perhaps through K+ channels; and (3) the
internal K+ concentration is balanced by a number of
organic anions restrained within the cell. Under these
conditions, it might be expected that K+ will diffuse out
of the cell, driven by its concentration gradient, until
the concentrations of K+ outside and inside the cell are
equal. However, as K+ diffuses out of the cell it leaves
behind the nondiffusible anionic charges, thus creating
a charge imbalance and thus a voltage (potential)
difference across the membrane. The potential that is

FIGURE 3.8 An electrical potential gradient may drive
an apparent accumulation of cations (e.g., K+) against
a concentration gradient. The combination of concen-
tration differences and charge differences constitutes an
electrochemical gradient. Thus, potassium ions tend to
accumulate in cells in response to the large number of
ﬁxed charges on proteins and other macromolecules.
generated by such a combination of nondiffusible anions
and mobile cations is referred to as a Donnan poten-
tial. The negative charges tend to pull the positively
charged potassium ions back onto the cell. As a result,
equilibrium is achieved not when the concentrations of
K+ are equal on both sides of the membrane, but when
the membrane potential difference reaches a value such
that the force of the concentration gradient pulling K+
out of the cell is balanced by the force of the electrical
gradient pulling K+ back into the cell. Under these
circumstances, the cell will maintain a high internal
K+ concentration and the accumulation ratio will be
greater than unity, yet the movement of potassium
ion is solely by passive diffusion. Because the unequal
distribution of K+ at equilibrium results from a Donnan
potential, it is an example of Donnan equilibrium.
Anion distribution would also be inﬂuenced by
the membrane potential, but in the opposite direction.
Anions would be repelled by the preponderance of inter-
nal negative charges and attracted by the preponderance
of external positive charges, thus leading to an accumula-
tion ratio less than unity. It is clear from these examples
that an accumulation ratio other than unity does not
necessarily mean that active transport is involved.
Transmembrane potentials can be measured with
a microelectrode made from ﬁnely drawn-out glass
tubing. With the aid of a microscope, the electrode is
inserted into the vacuole of a cell. A reference electrode
is placed in the medium surrounding the cell. The
difference in potential between the two electrodes can
be measured with the aid of a sensitive voltmeter. It is
by no means an easy technique, but many experimenters
have
become
quite
proﬁcient
with
it.
Potentials
measured in this way are commonly in the range of
−100 to −130 mV for young roots and stems, although
potentials as high as −200 mV have been recorded for
some algal cells. The cytosol is always negative with
respect to the surrounding medium. Such potentials
do not require a large charge imbalance. As few as one
unbalanced charge in a population of a million ions is
sufﬁcient to generate a potential of 100 mV.
3.4.2 THE NERNST EQUATION HELPS
TO PREDICT WHETHER AN ION
IS EXCHANGED ACTIVELY OR
PASSIVELY
To predict the distribution of a charged ion, C, across a
membrane, we have to take into account the concentra-
tion difference of the ion across the membrane as well as
the contribution of electrical potential difference (Ec)
across the membrane. Thus, equation 3.3 simpliﬁes to
−z Ec = 59 log[Ci]/[Co]

where z is the valency or absolute charge of the ion, C,
and Ci and Co are the concentrations of this ion in the
cytosol and outside the cell respectively. Equation 3.5,
which shows relationship
between transmembrane
potential gradient and ion distribution across the
membrane is called the Nernst equation where Ec
is the electrical potential difference (also known as
the Nernst potential). The value of z for a univalent
cation, for example, would be 1 while for calcium or
magnesium it would be 2. For chloride or nitrate it
would be −1 and for sulphate it would be −2.
The Nernst equation is useful because it allows
us to make certain predictions about the equilibrium
concentrations for ions inside the cell (Ci) when ion
transport is due to facilitated diffusion. In order to apply
the equation, it is necessary to measure the transmem-
brane potential and the concentrations of ions both
inside and outside the cell. If the actual concentrations
deviate signiﬁcantly from those predicted by the Nernst
equation, it may be considered evidence that either
active uptake or active expulsion of the ions is involved.
In other words, the Nernst equation can be used to
determine the probability of whether an ion is actively
or passively distributed across the membrane. If the mea-
sured internal concentrations are approximately equal
to the calculated Nernst value, it can be assumed that
the ion has been distributed passively. If the measured
concentration is greater than predicted, active uptake is
probably involved, and, if lower, it is likely that the ion
is being actively expelled from the cell.
Application of the predictive value of the Nernst
equation is illustrated by the experiment of Higin-
botham and colleagues shown in Table 3.2. At equilib-
rium the measured membrane potentials were −110 mV
for pea roots and −84 mV for oat roots. Co, the concen-
tration of ions in the external solution, was known and
the predicted value of Ci was calculated from the Nernst
equation. The ratio of the predicted value to the actual
value is a measure of how well the Nernst relationship
applies to that particular ion. Note that the accumula-
tion ratios for almost all of the ions are greater than
1.0, indicating some degree of accumulation in the cell.
Only in the case of K+ was the ratio of predicted concen-
tration to actual concentration near 1.0. This indicates
that K+ is near electrochemical equilibrium and was
probably accumulated passively, at least in pea roots.
There appears to be a possibility of some active accu-
mulation of K+ by oat roots. Cellular concentrations
of both Na+ and Ca2+ are lower than predicted. Since
other evidence supports the existence of Na+ and Ca2+
pumps in the membrane, these ions probably entered
passively down their electrochemical gradients but were
then actively expelled. Internal concentrations for all
three anions are much higher than predicted, indicating

3.5 Electrogenic Pumps are Critical for Cellular Active Transport
49
they are actively taken up by the cells. This is under-
standable, since energy would be required to overcome
the normal transmembrane potential and move neg-
atively charged ions into the predominantly negative
environment inside the cell.
Although these results are indicative of active and
passive transport, further tests would help to conﬁrm the
conclusion in each case. Since active transport requires
a direct input of metabolic energy, it is sensitive to
oxygen and respiratory poisons. Thus reduced uptake
of a particular ion in the absence of oxygen or in
the presence of respiratory inhibitors such as cyanide or
2,4-dinitrophenol would be evidence in support of active
transport. Even this evidence is not always compelling,
however, since effects of inhibitors may indirectly inﬂu-
ence nutrient uptake. For example, even transport by
diffusion ultimately requires an expenditure of metabolic
energy, if only to establish and maintain the organization
of membranes and other properties of the cell that make
transport possible. It is not always a simple matter to
distinguish between direct and indirect involvement of
energy. The criteria for active transport usually require
that the solute distribution not be in electrochemical
equilibrium and that there be a quantitative relation-
ship between energy expended and the amount of solute
transported.
Finally, it should be noted that when ion con-
centrations are known, the Nernst equation can also be
used to estimate the transmembrane potential, or Nernst
potential, contributed by that ion. At steady state, however,
calculation of the membrane potential is complicated by
the fact that many different ion species, each with a
different permeability, are simultaneously crossing the
membrane in both directions. The individual contribu-
tions of all ion gradients must consequently be taken
into account and summed in order to arrive at the over-
all potential for the cell. In practice, however, K+, Na+,
and Cl−are the dominant ions. These ions have the
highest permeabilities and concentrations in plant cells
and a reasonable estimation of transmembrane potential
can be based on these three ions alone.
3.5 ELECTROGENIC PUMPS ARE
CRITICAL FOR CELLULAR
ACTIVE TRANSPORT
3.5.1 ACTIVE TRANSPORT IS DRIVEN
BY ATPASE-PROTON PUMPS
Energy to drive active transport comes chieﬂy from
the hydrolysis of ATP. The energy-transducing mem-
branes of chloroplasts and mitochondria contain large,
multiprotein ATPase complexes (Chapters 7, 10). The
chloroplast and mitochondrial ATPases, known as
F-type ATPases, utilize the energy associated with an
electrochemical proton gradient across a membrane to

H+-ATPase. The enzyme is a single chain with 10
hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domains. Only three
are shown here as helical coils, while the remaining seven
are schematically represented as cylinders. Linking adja-
cent membrane-spanning domains are hydrophilic loops
that project into the cytosol (inside) and the cell wall
apoplast (outside). The ATP-binding site is an aspartic
acid residue (D) located on the hydrophilic loop between
the fourth and ﬁfth membrane-spanning domains. The
H+-binding site is located in the hydrophobic domain.
Hydrolysis of ATP at the binding site is thought to
change the conformation of the enzyme, thereby expos-
ing the H+-binding site to the outside of the membrane
where the H+ is released. (Compare with Figure 5.9.)
drive ATP synthesis. ATPase complexes are also found in
the plasma and vacuolar membranes of cells and possibly
other membranes as well. These ATPases are called
ATPase-proton pumps (or, H+-ATPase). Known as
P-type ATPases, the plasma membrane ATPase-proton
pumps are structurally distinct (Figure 3.9) and operate
in reverse of the F-type. Rather than synthesizing
ATP, the plasma membrane ATPases hydrolyze ATP
and use the negative free energy to ‘‘pump’’ protons
from one side of the membrane to the other against
an electrochemical gradient. An ATPase-proton pump
thus serves as a proton-translocating carrier protein
and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is conserved in
the form of a proton gradient across the membrane.
This proton gradient (pH), together with the normal
membrane potential (), contributes to a proton
motive force (pmf) that tends to move protons back
across the membrane (Equation 3.6).
pmf =  −59 pH
(3.6)
It is generally conceded that the proton motive force
established by pumping protons across membranes is the
primary source of energy for a variety of plant activities.
We will revisit this equation and the concept of a proton
motive force in our discussion of ATP synthesis in the
chloroplast and the mitochondrion (Chapter 5).

FIGURE 3.10 Schematic diagram relating the activity of
a membrane ATPase-proton pump to solute exchange.
The proton pump (a) uses the energy of ATP to estab-
lish both a proton gradient and a potential difference
(negative inside) across the membrane. The energy of
the proton gradient may activate an ion channel (b), or
drive the removal of ions from the cell by an antiport car-
rier (c), or drive the uptake of ions or uncharged solute
by a symport carrier (d, e). Similar pumps and carriers
operate across the vacuolar membrane. C+, cation; A−,
anion; S, uncharged solute.
Included are activities such as active transport
of solutes (cations, anions, amino acids, and sugars),
regulation of cytoplasmic pH, stomatal opening and
closure, sucrose transport during phloem loading, and
hormone-mediated cell elongation.
A schematic model relating ATPase-proton pumps
to solute exchange across membranes is shown in
Figure 3.10. The ATP required to drive the pump is
ultimately derived from oxidative phosphorylation in
the mitochondria. The proton-translocating protein is
shown extending across the plasma membrane, with its
ATP binding site on the cytosolic side. Hydrolysis of
the ATP results in the translocation of one or more
protons from the cytosol to the surrounding apoplastic
cell wall space.
There are several particularly interesting conse-
quences of the ATPase-proton pump. First, a single ion
species is translocated in one direction. This form of
transport is consequently known as a uniport system.
Second, because the ion transported carries a charge,
an electrochemical gradient is established across the
membrane. In other words, the ATPase-proton pump
is electrogenic—it contributes directly to the negative
potential difference across the plasma membrane. In
fact, the electrogenic proton pump is a major factor
in the membrane potential of most plant cells. From
equation 3.5, a tenfold difference in proton concentra-
tion (one pH unit) at 25◦C contributes 59 mV to the
potential. Since the proton gradient across the plasma
membrane is normally on the order of 1.5 to 2 pH units,
it can account for approximately 90 to 120 mV of the
total membrane potential. Third, since the ions translo-
cated are protons, the ATPase-proton pump establishes
a proton gradient as well as an electrical gradient across
the membrane. Energy stored in the resulting electro-
chemical proton gradient (or the proton motive force) can
then be coupled to cellular work in accordance with
Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis (see Chapter 5). Indeed,
this is an excellent demonstration of how chemiosmotic
coupling is not restricted to ATP synthesis in chloro-
plasts and mitochondria but can be used to perform
other kinds of work elsewhere in the cell.
Several ways of coupling the electrochemical proton
gradient to solute movement across the membrane are
illustrated in Figure 3.10. In the ﬁrst case, the electro-
genic pump contributes to the charge-dependent uptake
of cations through ion-speciﬁc channels (Figure 3.10)
(b)). Second, the return of protons to the cytosol can be
coupled with the transport of other solute molecules at
the same time, or cotransport. Transport of both ions is
mediated by the same carrier protein and the movement
of the second solute is obligatorily coupled to the inward
ﬂux of protons down their electrochemical gradient.
If the second ion moves in opposite direction from the
proton, the method of cotransport is referred to more
speciﬁcally as antiport. In Figure 3.10 (c), for example,
proton ﬂux into the cell is shown coupled to the efﬂux
of other cations out of the cell. Here the energy of the
proton electrochemical gradient is used to maintain low
internal concentrations of speciﬁc cations. Any cations
that do chance to ‘‘leak’’ into the cell, no doubt passively
through ion channels, are thus pumped out against
their electrochemical gradient. If the two solutes move
in the same direction at the same time, the method of
cotransport is referred to as symport. Two examples are
shown in Figure 3.10 (d, e). In the ﬁrst example, proton
ﬂux into the cell is coupled with the uptake of anions
(A−) against their electrochemical gradient. In the
second example of symport, the proton gradient can be
used to power the uptake of uncharged solutes (S), such
as sugars. All three examples of cotransport are forms
of active transport mediated by speciﬁc carrier proteins.
3.5.2 THE ATPASE-PROTON PUMPS
OF PLASMA MEMBRANES AND
VACUOLAR MEMBRANES ARE
DIFFERENT
Much of the pioneering experimental work on mem-
brane ATPase has been conducted with small, spherical

vesicles obtained from isolated cellular membranes.
When membranes are disrupted, the pieces naturally
seal off to form vesicles because of their strong-
ly hydrophobic nature. While the technique is relatively
straightforward, the preparation of vesicles from a single
membrane source, and thus containing a single type
of ATPase, presents some difﬁculties. Contamination
by chloroplast ATPase can be avoided by isolating
the membranes from dark-grown, etiolated tissue,
while mitochondria can usually be separated from
other membranes by differential centrifugation. It is
more difﬁcult, however, to separate plasma membranes
from other cellular membranes such as the vacuolar
membrane and, consequently, many of the early studies
were characterized by inconsistent results from different
laboratories. These inconsistencies were resolved when
it became clear that the membrane preparations often
contained two types of electrogenic ATPase-proton
pumps: one associated with the plasma membrane and
one with the vacuolar membrane. Improved techniques
have enabled at least partial separation of the two
membranes by density gradient centrifugation and it is
now possible to characterize their respective ATPases.
The plasma membrane–type proton-pumping ATPase
is characteristically inhibited by vanadate ion (VO−
3 ) but
is generally insensitive to other anions such as NO−
3 .
Vanadate competes with phosphate for binding sites,
indicating that ATP transfers a phosphate group to the
ATPase protein (Figure 3.9). The resulting energy-rich
phosphoenzyme then undergoes a conformational
change that exposes the proton-binding site to the
outside. Evidence thus far indicates that a single proton
is translocated for each ATP hydrolyzed.
The
vacuolar-type
ATPase-proton
pump
(or
V-type) differs from the plasma membrane–type in
several ways. It is, for example, insensitive to vanadate
but strongly inhibited by nitrate. In this respect it is
similar to mitochondrial, or F-type, ATPase, which
is also insensitive to vanadate. Should the preparation
be contaminated with any mitochondrial ATPase,
however, its activity can be blocked by including
oligomycin or azide in the assay medium. Both inhibit
mitochondrial ATPase without affecting the activity
of the tonoplast-type. Structurally, the vacuolar-type
ATPase is also more similar to the mitochondrial
F-type ATPase than to the plasma membrane ATPase.
Like the F-type, the V-type can be separated into a
complex of hydrophobic subunits embedded in the
membrane (analogous to F0) and a complex of soluble,
hydrophilic
subunits
(analogous
to
F1).
Although
the soluble complex contains an ATP-binding site,
insensitivity of the V-type ATPase to vanadate suggests
that it does not form a phosphorylated intermediate.
The vacuolar version also appears to differ in that it
transports two protons for each molecule of ATP that
is hydrolyzed. The function of the vacuolar ATPase is
to pump protons from the cytosol into the vacuole, thus
accounting for the fact that the potential of the vacuole
is more positive than the cytosol by some 20 to 30 mV
(Figure 3.10). In extreme cases, large pH gradients can
be maintained across the vacuolar membrane and the
vacuolar sap may become quite acidic. For example, the
pH of lemon juice (which is predominantly vacuolar
sap) is normally about 2.5. Like the plasma membrane
pump the vacuolar pump is also electrogenic, except
that the accumulated protons serve to reduce the
potential of the vacuole relative to the cytosol. The
resulting potential difference serves to drive anions
(e.g., Cl−or malate) into the vacuole, which is less
negative than the cytosol. The electrochemical proton
gradient can also be used to drive cations (e.g., K+ or
Ca2+) into the vacuole by an antiport carrier. Both of
these activities make important contributions to the
turgor changes that drive stomatal guard cell movement
and the specialized motor cells that control nyctinastic
responses (Chapter 23).
In addition to the H+-ATPases, some membranes,
such as the plasma membranes, chloroplast envelope, the
endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuolar membrane, also
contain calcium-pumping ATPases (Ca2 + −ATPases).
Ca2+-ATPases couple the hydrolysis of ATP with the
translocation of Ca2+ across the membrane. In the case
of the plasma membrane, the calcium is pumped out
of the cytosol. This serves to keep the cytosolic Ca2+
concentration low, which is necessary in order to avoid
precipitating phosphates and to keep Ca2+-depen-
dent signaling pathways operating properly (Chapters 16
and 17).
3.5.3 K+ EXCHANGE IS MEDIATED BY
TWO CLASSES OF TRANSPORT
PROTEINS
Since the 1950s, the uptake of K+ into cells—especially
root cells—has been studied more thoroughly than any
other ion species. Much of the early work was carried
out by Emanuel Epstein, who pioneered the use of
86Rb+, a radioactive K+ analog, to follow K+ uptake
in low-salt roots. Epstein was also the ﬁrst to treat ion
transporters as enzymes and to analyze their data using
the methods of classical enzyme kinetics. An analysis
of the initial rate of K+ absorption at different external
concentrations showed that K+ absorption is biphasic.
On the basis of these results, Epstein proposed that
there were two types of K+ transport systems in plant
cells: a high- afﬁnity transport system (HAT) that is
active at low K+ concentrations (≤200 μM), and a
low-afﬁnity transport system (LAT) that is active at high
K+ concentrations. Such transport systems have now
been identiﬁed for myriad macronutrient ions including
Ca2 + , NO−
3 , SO2−
4
and PO2−
4 . A consistent feature of

52
Chapter 3 / Roots, Soils, and Nutrient Uptake
all HATs is they mediate a slow rate of ion uptake when
the external concentrations of the ion are low. This
means that HATs exhibit a low capacity for ion uptake.
However, although their capacity for ion uptake is low,
their efﬁciency for ion uptake is very high because of
their high binding afﬁnity for the speciﬁc ion. Thus, the
uptake kinetics for HATs exhibit nonlinear, saturation
kinetics. In contrast, although LATs exhibit low afﬁnity
for ion uptake in a linear concentration dependence, the
capacity of LATs for uptake is high. The ion concentra-
tion which typically induces a transition from LATs to
HATs is about 1 mM for most macronutrient ions. Bio-
physical and molecular genetic studies have conﬁrmed
the existence of multiple transporters with different
substrate afﬁnities. Mosts physiological, biochemical,
and molecular studies of macronutrient ion transport
have focused on the characterization of HATs. How-
ever, given that agricultural soil concentrations of K+,
NO−
3 , and NH+
4 may exceed 1 mM, LATs may also be
important in maintaining plant productivity under ﬁeld
conditions.
Experiments using microelectrodes that measure
cytoplasmic K+ concentration and membrane poten-
tial simultaneously in single root cells have conﬁrmed
that when the external concentration is low, there
is a strong K+ electrochemical gradient across the
plasma membrane. In order for K+ to move into the
cell under those conditions, the high-afﬁnity uptake
system must be driven by an active transport mech-
anism. This high-afﬁnity uptake system is probably
a H+-ATPase-linked K+-H+ symporter. Patch-clamp
studies, on the other hand, have established that the
low-afﬁnity uptake system involves channels that move
K+ either into (K+
in channels) or out (K+
out channels)
of the cell. While the focus tends to be on K+
in chan-
nels, channels that allow K+ to move out of the cell
are also important in controlling osmotic adjustment,
maintaining stomatal function, and driving nyctinastic
movements of leaves (Chapter 23).
K+ transporters are highly efﬁcient and, conse-
quently, their relative abundance in the cell membranes
is very low. This makes it difﬁcult to isolate and
purify transporters by traditional biochemical tech-
niques. Some genes that encode K+ transporters and
other plant transport proteins have been identiﬁed by
cloning the genes in transport-deﬁcient mutants of yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A yeast mutant deﬁcient of a
high-afﬁnity K+ transporter, for example, will grow
on a medium with a high K+ concentration, but not on
a low-concentration medium. However, transformation
of the yeast with KAT1 (a gene encoding a high-afﬁnity
K+ transporter from the guard cells and vascular tissue
of Arabidopsis), will restore the capacity of the yeast to
grow on low K+. Experiments of this type have led
to the identiﬁcation of at least a dozen putative K+
transporters as well as transporters for sugars, amino
acids, NH+
4 , and SO2−
4 .

Deprivation

macronutrients
nitrogen
(N),
phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) can be
a limiting factor for plant growth and survival under
natural conditions. How do plant root cells sense
changes in soil nutrient macronutrient availability and
how is this signal transduced by the root cell to elicit an
appropriate response at the molecular, biochemical, and
physiological levels to adjust the rate of growth to match
the macronutrient availability? Although the cellular
networks involved in the sensing and signalling of lim-
itations in macronutrient resource availability are not
well deﬁned, it is clear that the deﬁciency in one nutrient
can affect the uptake of another nutrient. For example,
a decrease in SO2−
4
availability can disrupt nitrogen
metabolism resulting in the accumulation of NO−
3 in the
leaves. Similarly, NH+
4 availability is known at affect K+
uptake. Numerous molecular studies indicate that K+
limitation represses the expression of NO−
3 transporters
but stimulates the expression of NH+
4
transporters.
PO2−
4
deprivation is one of the most studied phe-
nomena associated with nutrient uptake. Recent gene
micro-array studies indicate that phosphorus deﬁciency
in plants causes a plethora of transcriptional responses,
including the up-regulation of SO2−
4
transporters as well
as iron transporters. PII proteins (Chapter 11) are key
regulators of cellular NO−
3 supply to ensure a balance
between C- and N-metabolism. Thus, the mechanisms
controlling the uptake of these macronutrients nutrients
do not occur necessarily independently of one another
but rather are interactive. The complex, interactive
effects of macronutrient deprivation on gene transcrip-
tion and cellular physiology indicate that nutrient uptake
is best described as a complex network of pathways.
As a consequence, there must be molecular cross talk
between the different ion uptake mechanisms to coun-
teract potential imbalances caused by deﬁciencies in
nutrients.
3.7 ROOT ARCHITECTURE IS
IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE
ION UPTAKE
Even though the uptake of ions by roots is essentially a
cellular problem, the organization of roots at the tissue
level cannot be totally ignored. The organization and

53
architecture of roots are such that they can absorb some
mineral salts without them ever entering a cell.
3.7.1 A FIRST STEP IN MINERAL
UPTAKE BY ROOTS IS DIFFUSION
INTO THE APPARENT FREE SPACE
Most nutrient uptake studies are carried out with
‘‘intact’’ tissues, such as excised barley roots. A typical
pattern for the uptake of Ca2+ by low-salt barley roots
is illustrated by the kinetic diagram in Figure 3.11.
Note that initially, usually within the ﬁrst few minutes,
uptake of Ca2+ is very rapid. It then settles into a slow
but steady accumulation over time. If at some point
the roots are transferred to a large volume of solution
lacking calcium, Ca2+ will be lost from the root into the
bathing solution as shown by the dashed lines. When the
bathing solution is distilled water, the quantity of ions
lost is usually less than the quantity taken up during the
initial rapid phase. If the roots are then transferred from
distilled water to a bathing solution containing another
cation, say Mg2+, an additional quantity of Ca2+ will be
lost from the tissue. If volumes of the bathing solutions
are sufﬁciently large, the total quantity of Ca2+ lost
from the tissue will approximately equal the quantity
taken up during the initial rapid phase.
The kinetics of calcium uptake and release in this
experiment can be interpreted as follows. Assume that

FIGURE 3.11 Typical kinetics for the uptake of Ca2+ into
roots. When low-salt roots are placed in a solution of
calcium chloride, an initial rapid uptake is followed by
a slower but steady accumulation of calcium ion. If the
roots are then transferred to a large volume of distilled
water, some of the calcium diffuses out of the roots.
Transfer to a strong magnesium solution releases addi-
tional calcium into the medium. The total amount of
calcium released is equivalent to the amount taken up by
free diffusion during the initial rapid phase.
there is a fraction of the root tissue volume, called appar-
ent free space (AFS), that is not separated from the
environment by a membrane or other diffusion barrier.
Because there are no barriers, Ca2+ in the surrounding
medium would have access to the apparent free space
by simple diffusion. When root tissue is immersed in
the calcium solution, Ca2+ will rapidly diffuse into the
AFS until the Ca2+ concentration in the AFS reaches
equilibrium with the bathing solution. This accounts for
the initial, rapid uptake of calcium. Thereafter, calcium
ions are more slowly but steadily transported across the
cell membrane and accumulated by the tissue. When
the roots are transferred to distilled water, some of the
Ca2+ ions present in the free space are free to diffuse
back into the surrounding solution—and they will do so
until equilibrium is again reached. The Ca2+ taken up
by the cells, having already been transported across the
cell membrane, is not free to diffuse back and remains
in the cells.
A further loss of calcium when the roots are trans-
ferred to the solution containing magnesium ions is
taken as evidence that the tissue behaves as a cation
exchange material. That is to say, the AFS matrix, pri-
marily cell wall components, is negatively charged and
holds some cations by electrostatic attraction just as soil
colloids do. These adsorbed ions are not free to diffuse
out of the tissue into distilled water, but can be displaced
by other cations, such as magnesium in the example
given above. Thus, apparent free space describes that
portion of the root tissue that is accessible by free diffu-
sion and includes ions restrained electrostatically due to
charges that line the space.
A variety of techniques have been developed
to measure the root volume given over to AFS. In
principle, the volume of the AFS can be estimated by the
following experiment. A sample of roots weighing 1.0 g
was immersed in a solution containing 20 μmoles ml−1
potassium sulfate (K2SO4). The roots were then
removed from the solution, blotted to remove excess
solution, and placed in a large volume of distilled
water. It was found that 4.5 μmoles of sulphate were
released from the roots into the distilled water. If it is
assumed that sulphate in the AFS was in equilibrium
with the external solution, that is, 20 μmoles ml−1,
then the volume occupied by the sulphate in the tissue
can be calculated: 4.5 μmole/20 μmoles ml−1 = 0.22 ml.
Thus, the volume of root tissue freely accessible by
diffusion is 0.22 ml. By further assuming that 1 g of
root tissue occupies approximately 1 ml of volume, the
proportion of tissue freely accessible by diffusion is
approximately 22 percent by volume. Estimates for the
volume occupied by AFS do vary, depending on the
species, conditions under which the roots were grown,
whether the measurements are corrected for surface
ﬁlms, and so forth. Still, most measured values for AFS
tend to fall in the 10 to 25 percent range.

3.7.2 APPARENT FREE SPACE IS
EQUIVALENT TO THE APOPLAST
OF THE ROOT EPIDERMAL AND
CORTICAL CELLS
Exactly what constitutes AFS in a root? If it is assumed
that AFS is the volume of the root that is accessible
by free diffusion, then it probably consists of the cell
walls and intercellular spaces (equivalent to the apoplas-
tic space) of the epidermis and cortex. These are the
regions of the root that can be entered without crossing
a membrane. In most cases there is a strong correlation
between the calculated volume of AFS and the calcu-
lated volume of cell walls in the cortex of the root.
Furthermore, the cation exchange capacity of the AFS
can be traced to the carboxyl groups (—COO−) associ-
ated with the galacturonic acid residues in the cell wall
pectic compounds.
Almost certainly, the AFS stops at the endodermis
where, in most roots, the radial and transverse walls
develop characteristic thickenings called the Casparian
band (see Chapter 2, Figure 2.10). The Casparian band
is principally composed of a complex mixture of hydro-
phobic, long-chain fatty acids and alcohols called
suberin. These hydrophobic substances impregnate
the cell wall, ﬁlling in the spaces between the cellulose
microﬁbrils. They are, in addition, strongly attached
to the plasma membrane of the endodermal cells. The
hydrophobic, space-ﬁlling nature of the Casparian band
along with its attachment to the membrane greatly
reduces the possibility that ions or small hydrophilic
molecules can pass between the cortex and stele without
ﬁrst entering the symplast. This means, of course, that
they must pass through the plasma membrane of the
cortical or endodermal cells and are, consequently,
subject to all of the control and selectivity normally
associated with membranes.

MOVEMENT THROUGH
ROOTS
3.8.1 IONS ENTERING THE STELE
MUST FIRST BE TRANSPORTED
FROM THE APPARENT FREE
SPACE INTO THE SYMPLAST
Rapid distribution of nutrient ions throughout the plant
is accomplished in the xylem vessels. In order to reach
these conducting tissues, which are located in the cen-
tral core, or stele, of the root, the ions must move in
a radial path through the root. The path these ions
must follow is diagrammed in Figure 3.12. For these
purposes we may consider the root as consisting of
three principal regions. The outermost region consists
of the root epidermis (often referred to as the rhizo-
dermis) and the cortical cells. The innermost region
consists of vascular tissues—the vessel elements and
associated parenchyma cells—which are of particular

3.8 The Radial Path of Ion Movement Through Roots

interest for our discussion. Separating the two is the
endodermis with its suberized Casparian band.
Ion uptake begins with free diffusion into the appar-
ent free space. As noted in the previous section, the
apparent free space is equivalent to the apoplast out-
side the endodermis and the Casparian band effectively
prevents further apoplastic diffusion through the endo-
dermis into the stele. Hence the only possible route for
ions to pass through the endodermis is to enter the sym-
plast by some carrier- or channel-mediated transport at
the cell membrane. This may occur either on the outer
tangential wall of the endodermal cell itself or through
any of the epidermal or cortical cells. Regardless of
which cell takes up the ions, symplastic connections
(i.e., plasmodesmata) facilitate their passive movement
from cell to cell until they arrive at a xylem parenchyma
cell in the stele. At this point the ions may be unloaded
into the xylem vessels for long distance transport to the
leaves and other organs.
3.8.2 IONS ARE ACTIVELY SECRETED
INTO THE XYLEM APOPLAST
With the exception of the very tip of the root where the
young xylem vessel elements are still maturing, func-
tional xylem is part of the apoplast. The interconnected
vessel elements are devoid of cytoplasm and consist
only of nonliving tubes ﬁlled with an aqueous solution.
Release of ions into the xylem thus requires a transfer
from the symplast into the apoplast. At one time, it was
thought that this transfer was simply a passive leakage,
but it is now clear that ions are actively secreted from
xylem parenchyma cells. Although there is some con-
ﬂicting evidence, ion concentration in the apoplast of the
stele is generally much higher than in the surrounding
cortex. This suggests that ions are being accumulated
in the xylem against a concentration gradient, presum-
ably by an energy-dependent, carrier-mediated process.
It is also interesting to speculate, in this regard, that
the Casparian band also functions to prevent loss of
ions from the stele by blocking their diffusion down a
concentration gradient.
In addition to working uphill against a con-
centration gradient, delivery of ions into the xylem
vessels is sensitive to metabolic inhibitors such as
carbonyl-cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP),
which uncouples ATP formation. It is interesting
that ion transport into the xylem is also sensitive to
cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, but
uptake into the root, at least initially, is not affected.
Two plant hormones (abscisic acid and cytokinin) have
a similar effect. Whether inhibitors of protein synthesis
and
hormones
are
affecting
symplastic
transport
through the endodermis or unloading of ions from the
endodermis into the xylem is not certain, but these
results at least raise the possibility that ion release into
the vessels is a different kind of process than ion uptake
by the roots.
3.8.3 EMERGING SECONDARY ROOTS
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE
UPTAKE OF SOME SOLUTES
The possibility remains that a limited portion of
ion uptake may be accomplished entirely through
the apoplast, at least in some roots. More basal
endodermal cells—the distance from the tip is variable,
but measured in centimeters—are characterized by
additional suberin deposits that cover the entire radial
and inner tangential wall surfaces. This would seem
to present an additional barrier to apoplastic ﬂow.
However, in some plants, a small number of endodermal
cells, called passage cells, remain unsuberized. Passage
cells might represent a major point of entry for solutes
into the stele.
Apoplastic continuity between the cortex and stele
may also be established at the point of lateral root forma-
tion. One series of experiments, for example, followed
the path of ﬂuorescent dyes into the vascular tissues and
shoots of corn (Zea mays) and broad bean (Vicia faba)
seedlings. These dyes were chosen because they cannot
be taken up by cells and thus are normally conﬁned
to the apoplast, The point of dye entry was traced to
recently emerged secondary roots. These branch roots
arise in the pericycle, a layer of cells immediately inside
the endodermis. The emergence of the root primor-
dia through the endodermis disrupts the continuity of
the Casparian band and establishes, at least temporar-
ily, the apoplastic continuity required to allow diffusion
of the dye into the vascular tissue. Continuity of the
apoplast through passage cells and secondary roots has
been cited to explain increased calcium uptake in certain
regions of corn roots. It may also help to account for
the fact that a plant appears to contain virtually every
element that is found in its environment, even those
not known to be essential or not accumulated by plant
cells.
The uptake of ions is not uniform along the length
of the root. As shown in Table 3.3, uptake of calcium is
highest in the apical 3 cm of the root while potassium is
taken up in roughly equivalent amounts along the ﬁrst
15 cm. Moreover, most of what is taken up in the tip
(almost two-thirds of the calcium and three-fourths of
the potassium) remains in the root. The proportion of
ions translocated to the shoot increases with increasing
distance from the tip. It is also interesting that when
calcium is taken up further along the root (12 to 15 cm
from the tip), it is translocated to the shoot but not
to the tip. Clearly, although substantial progress has
been made in several laboratories, the transport of ions
through roots and into the xylem remains a complex and
challenging ﬁeld of study.

3.9 ROOT-MICROBE
INTERACTIONS
The inﬂuence of living roots extends well beyond the
immediate root surface into a region of the soil deﬁned as
the rhizosphere. A principal manifestation of this inﬂu-
ence is the numerous associations that develop between
roots and soil microorganisms, especially bacteria and
fungi. Root-microbe associations can at times be quite
complex and may involve invasion of the host root
by the microorganism. Alternatively the microorganism
may remain free-living in the soil. In either case, the
association may prove beneﬁcial to the plant or it may
be pathogenic and cause injury.
3.9.1 BACTERIA OTHER THAN
NITROGEN FIXERS CONTRIBUTE
TO NUTRIENT UPTAKE BY ROOTS
Plant roots generally support large populations of bacte-
ria, principally because of the large supply of energy-rich
nutrients provided by the growing root system. The
immediate environment of the roots is so favorable
to bacterial growth that the bacterial population in
the rhizosphere may exceed that in the surrounding
bulk soil by as much as 50 percent. Nutrients pro-
vided by the roots are comprised largely of amino
acids and soluble amides, reducing sugars, and other
low-molecular-weight compounds. These compounds
may either leak from the cells (a nonmetabolic pro-
cess) or be actively secreted into the apoplastic space
from whence they readily diffuse into the surrounding
rhizosphere.
Dominant among the root secretions are the
mucilages: polysaccharides secreted by Golgi vesicles
in cells near the growing tip. Secretion of mucilage
appears to be restricted to cells such as root cap cells,
young epidermal cells, and root hairs where sec-
ondary walls have yet to form. Secretion of mucilage in
the more basal regions of the root appears to be res-
tricted
by
development
of
secondary
walls.
The
mucilage is rapidly invaded by soil bacteria that
contribute their own metabolic products, including
mucopolysaccharides
of
the
bacterial
capsule.
In
addition, mucilage also attracts colloidal mineral and
organic matter from the soil. The resulting mixture of
root secretions, living and dead bacteria, and colloidal
soil particles is commonly referred to as mucigel.
There is no doubt that bacteria are intimately
involved in the nitrogen nutrition of plants. Both
invasive and free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria, known
since the late nineteenth century, are the primary
source of nitrogen for plants. In addition, other soil
bacteria convert ammonium nitrogen to nitrate. But to
what extent do the bacteria inﬂuence other aspects of
plant nutrition? In the previous chapter we pointed out
that phosphorous is sparingly soluble in most soils and,
in natural ecosystems, is often the limiting nutrient.
There is some evidence that soil bacteria can assist
in making phosphorous available by solubilizing the
water-insoluble forms. It is considered unlikely, how-
ever, that this represents a major source of phosphorous
for plants, especially in light of the extensive fungal
associations described in the next section. Bacteria
can, however, enhance nutrient uptake other than by
simply making nutrients more available. One way is to
inﬂuence the growth and morphology of roots. One of
the more striking examples is the formation of proteoid
roots. This is a phenomenon of localized, intense lateral
root production observed originally in the Proteaceae,
a family of tropical trees and shrubs. (The Proteaceae
includes the genus Macadamea, the source of the
popular macadamia nut.) Proteoid roots have now been
found in several other families. Their induction has
been traced to localized aggregations of bacteria in the
mucigel. The larger number of lateral roots allows a
more intensive mining of the soils for poorly mobile

3.9 Root-Microbe Interactions
57
nutrients, such as phosphorous. In addition, proteoid
roots are generally found near the soil surface where
they can take advantage of nutrients leached out of
the litter. The mechanism for proteoid root induction
has not been determined, but could be related to the
production of a plant hormone (indoleacetic acid) by the
bacteria.
3.9.2 MYCORRHIZAE ARE FUNGI THAT
INCREASE THE VOLUME OF THE
NUTRIENT DEPLETION ZONE
AROUND ROOTS
Perhaps the most widespread—and from the nutritional
perspective, more signiﬁcant—associations between
plants and microorganisms are those formed between
roots and a wide variety of soil fungi. A root infected
with a fungus is called a mycorrhiza (literally, fungus
root). Mycorrhizae are a form of mutualism, an
association in which both partners derive beneﬁt.
The signiﬁcance of mycorrhizae is reﬂected in the
observation that more than 80 percent of plants
studied, including virtually all plant species of economic
importance, form mycorrhizal associations. Two major
forms of mycorrhizae are known: ectotrophic and
endotrophic. The ectotrophic form, also known as
ectomycorrhizae, is restricted to a few families consist-
ing largely of temperate trees and shrubs, such as pines
(Pinaceae) and beech (Fagaceae). Ectomycorrhizae are
typically short, highly branched, and ensheathed by a
tightly interwoven mantle of fungal hyphae. The fungus
also penetrates the intercellular or apoplastic space of
the root cortex, forming an intercellular network called
a Hartig net. Endotrophic mycorrhizae, or endomy-
corrhizae, are found in some species of virtually every
angiosperm family and most gymnosperms as well
(except the Pinaceae). Unlike the ectomycorrhizae, the
hyphae of endomycorrhizae develop extensively within
cortical cells of the host roots.
The
most
common
type
of
endomycorrhiza,
found in the majority of the world’s vegetation, is
the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM). The
hyphae of VAM grow between and into root cortical
cells, where they form highly branched ‘‘treelike’’
structures called arbuscules (meaning dwarf tree). Each
branch of the arbuscule is surrounded by the plasma
membrane of the host cell. Thus, while the hyphae do
penetrate the host cell wall, they do not actually invade
the protoplast. The arbuscule serves to increase contact
surface area between the hypha and the cell by two to
three times. At the same time, it apparently inﬂuences
the host cell, which may increase its cytoplasmic
volume by as much as 20 to 25 percent. Less frequently,
VAMs form large ellipsoid vesicles either between
or within the host cells. The presence of arbuscules
and vesicles provides a large surface for the exchange
of nutrients between the host plant and the invading
fungus. Although VAMs do not form a well-deﬁned
sheath around the root, the hyphae, like those of the
ectomycorrhizae, do effectively extend the rhizosphere
by growing outward into the surrounding soil.
Mycorrhizae were originally discovered by the
nineteenth-century German botanist A. B. Frank, who
concluded, on the basis of experiments conducted
with beech seedlings, that mycorrhizal inoculation
stimulated seedling growth. Although not universally
accepted in the beginning, these results have been
amply conﬁrmed by more modern studies. Numerous
studies with pine and other tree seedlings in the United
States, Australia, and the former Soviet Union have
demonstrated 30 to 150 percent increases in dry weight
of tree seedlings infected with mycorrhizae when com-
pared with noninfected controls. Similar results have
been obtained in studies with agricultural plants such as
maize (Figure 3.13). In one experiment, for example, the
dry weight of VAM-infected Lavendula plants increased
8.5 times over noninfected controls. The primary
cause of mycorrhizal-enhanced growth appears to be
enhanced uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorous.
In a classic experiment, Hatch demonstrated in 1937
that infected pine seedlings absorbed two to three times
more nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous. Coupled

Chapter 3 / Roots, Soils, and Nutrient Uptake
with enhanced nutrient uptake is the observation that
mycorrhiza-induced growth responses are more pro-
nounced in nutrient-deﬁcient soils. VAM infection, for
example, can be effectively eliminated by supplying the
plant with readily available phosphorous. With a surplus
of phosphorous fertilizer, uninoculated plants will grow
as well as those inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi.
The beneﬁcial role of mycorrhizae, particularly with
respect to the uptake of phosphorous, appears to be
related to the nutrient depletion zone that surrounds
the root. This zone deﬁnes the limits of the soil from
which the root is able to readily extract nutrient ele-
ments. Additional nutrients can be made available only
by extension of the root into new regions of the soil
or by diffusion of nutrients from the bulk soil into the
depletion zone. The extent of the depletion zone varies
from one nutrient element to another, depending on
the solubility and mobility of the element in the soil
solution. The depletion zone for nitrogen, for example,
extends some distance from the root because nitrate is
readily soluble and highly mobile. Phosphorous, on the
other hand, is less soluble and relatively immobile in soils
and, consequently, the depletion zone for phosphorous
is correspondingly smaller. Mycorrhizal fungi assist in
the uptake of phosphorous by extending their mycelia
beyond the phosphorous depletion zone (Figure 3.13).
Apparently, mycorrhizal plants ﬁnd it advantageous to
expend their carbon resources supporting mycorrhizal
growth as opposed to more extensive growth of the root
system itself.
As we continue to learn about mycorrhizae, their
nutritional role becomes increasingly evident. Many
mycorrhizae are host species–speciﬁc. Attempts to
establish a plant species in a new environment may
be unsuccessful if the appropriate mycorrhizal fungus
is not present. Inoculation of ﬁelds with mycorrhizal
fungi is now an additional factor taken into account by
the forest and agricultural industries when attempting
to resolve problems of soil infertility.
SUMMARY
The uptake of nutrient salts by plants involves a
complex interaction between plant roots and the
soil. The colloidal component of soil, consisting of
clay particles and humus, presents a highly speciﬁc
surface area carrying numerous, primarily negative,
charges. Ions adsorbed to the charged colloidal surfaces
represent the principal reservoir of nutrients for the
plant. As ions are taken up from the dilute soil solution
by the roots, they are replaced by exchangeable ions
from the colloidal reservoir.
For nutrients to be taken up by a plant, they must
be transported across the cell membrane into the root
cell—thus making nutrient uptake fundamentally a cel-
lular problem. Solutes may cross a membrane by simple
diffusion, facilitated diffusion, or active transport. Facil-
itated diffusion and active transport are mediated by
channel and carrier proteins—proteins that span the
lipid bilayer. Only active transport achieves accumula-
tion of ions against an electrochemical gradient. Active
transport requires a source of metabolic energy, nor-
mally in the form of ATP. The free movement of water
across membranes has long been an enigma, although it
now appears to be a special case of facilitated diffusion
through water-selective channels called aquaporins.
The uptake of nutrients by most plants is enhanced by
association of the roots with soil microorganisms, espe-
cially fungi. Fungal-root associations (mycorrhizae)
beneﬁt the plant by signiﬁcantly increasing the volume
of soil accessible to the roots.
CHAPTER REVIEW
1. Distinguish between simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, and active transport. Which of these
three mechanisms would most probably account
for:
(a) entry of a small lipid-soluble solute;
(b) extrusion of sodium ions leaked into a cell;
(c) rapid entry of a neutral hydrophilic sugar;
(d) accumulation of potassium ions?
2. The Casparian band was encountered earlier with
regard to root pressure and again in this chapter
with regard to ion uptake. What is the Casparian
band and how does it produce these effects?
3. Trace the pathway taken by a potassium ion from
the point where it enters the root to a leaf epider-
mal cell.

role does apparent free space play in the uptake of
nutrient ions?
8. Why is an accumulation ratio greater than 1.0 not
necessarily an indication that active transport is
involved?

Plants and Inorganic Nutrients
Unlike heterotrophic organisms, which depend for
their
existence
on
energy-rich
organic
molecules
previously synthesized by other organisms, plants
must survive in an entirely inorganic environment. As
autotrophic organisms, plants must take in carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere and water and mineral
nutrients from the soil, and from these simple, inorganic
components, make all of the complex molecules of
a living organism. Since plants stand at the bottom
of the food chain, mineral nutrients assimilated by
plants eventually ﬁnd their way into the matter that
makes up all animals, including humans. All organisms
must continually draw material substance from their
environment in order to maintain their metabolism,
growth, and development. The means for making these
materials available to the organism is the subject of
plant nutrition.
Plant nutrition is traditionally treated as two sep-
arate topics: organic nutrition and inorganic nutrition.
Organic nutrition focuses on the production of carbon
compounds, speciﬁcally the incorporation of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen via photosynthesis, while inor-
ganic nutrition is concerned primarily with the acquisi-
tion of mineral elements from the soil. Photosynthesis
and the acquisition of mineral ions from the soil are so
interdependent, however, that this distinction between
organic and inorganic nutrition is more a matter of con-
venience than real. Nevertheless, because the acquisition
and assimilation of carbon are addressed in Chapters 7
and 8, this chapter will focus on the acquisition of min-
eral elements and the role of those elements in plant
metabolism.
This chapter will examine the nutritional require-
ments of plants that are satisﬁed by mineral elements.
This will include
•
methods employed in the study of mineral nutrition,
•
the concept of essential and beneﬁcial elements
and the distinction between macronutrients and
micronutrients,
•
a general discussion of the metabolic roles of the 14
essential mineral elements, the concept of critical
and deﬁcient concentration, and symptoms asso-
ciated with deﬁciencies of the mineral elements,
and
•
a brief discussion of micronutrient toxicity.

4.1 METHODS AND NUTRIENT
SOLUTIONS
4.1.1 INTEREST IN PLANT NUTRITION
IS ROOTED IN THE STUDY OF
AGRICULTURE AND CROP
PRODUCTIVITY
Much of the groundwork for modern nutritional studies
was laid in Europe in the early to mid-nineteenth cen-
tury, in response to a combination of political and social
factors. The Napoleonic wars had devastated Europe
and the industrial revolution was gaining momentum.
Rising populations and massive migration to the cities
created demands that could no longer be met by the
traditional agricultural economy, one that relied heav-
ily on the use of organic manures. Greater efﬁciency
in agriculture was required and this was not possi-
ble without a more thorough understanding of plant
nutrition.
One of the ﬁrst to make signiﬁcant progress in
the study of plant nutrition was N. T. de Saussure
(1767–1845), who studied both photosynthesis and the
absorption of nutrient elements with the same care-
ful, quantitative methods. De Saussure conducted some
of the ﬁrst elemental analyses of plant material and
introduced the concept that some, but not necessarily
all, of the elements found might be indispensable, or
essential, to plant growth. De Saussure’s ideas concern-
ing the importance of elements derived from the soil
generated considerable debate at the time, but received
support from the work of C. S. Sprengel (1787–1859),
working in Germany, and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault in
France. Sprengel introduced the idea that soils might
be unproductive if deﬁcient in but one single element
necessary for plant growth, and Boussingault stressed
quantitative relationships between the effects of fertil-
izer and nutrient uptake on crop yields. Boussingault
is also credited with providing the ﬁrst evidence that
legumes had the unique capacity to assimilate atmo-
spheric nitrogen, a ﬁnding that was later conﬁrmed by
the discovery of the nitrogen-ﬁxing role of bacteria in
root nodules.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, many
pieces of the nutritional puzzle were beginning to fall
into place. In 1860, Julius Sachs, a prominent German
botanist, demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that plants could
be grown to maturity in deﬁned nutrient solutions in the
complete absence of soil. J. B. Lawes and J. H. Gilbert,
working at Rothamsted in England, had successfully
converted insoluble rock phosphate to soluble phos-
phate (called superphosphate), and by the end of the
century the agricultural use of NPK (nitrogen, phospho-
rous, and potassium) fertilizers was well established in
Europe.
4.1.2 THE USE OF HYDROPONIC
CULTURE HELPED TO DEFINE
THE MINERAL REQUIREMENTS
OF PLANTS
In the mid-nineteenth century, J. Sachs was interested
in determining the minimal nutrient requirements of
plants. Recognizing that it would be difﬁcult to pursue
such studies in a medium as complex as soil, Sachs
devised an experimental system such that the roots
grew not in soil but in an aqueous solution of mineral
salts. With this simpliﬁed system, Sachs was able to
demonstrate the growth of plants to maturity on a rela-
tively simple nutrient solution containing six inorganic
salts (Table 4.1). Variations on Sachs’s system, known
as solution or hydroponic culture (growing plants in
a deﬁned nutrient solution), have remained to this day
the principal experimental system for study of plant
nutrient requirements. Hydroponic culture is also now
used extensively in North America for the year-round
commercial production of vegetables such as lettuce,
tomato, sweet peppers, and seedless cucumber.
The nutrient solution devised by Sachs contributed
a total of nine mineral nutrients (K, N, P, Ca, S, Na, Cl,
Fe, Mg). Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen were excluded
from this total because they were provided in the form
of carbon dioxide and water and were not considered
mineral elements. It was at least another half century
before the need for additional mineral nutrients was
demonstrated. There was no magic to the success of
Sachs’s experiments. Many of the mineral nutrients used
by plants are required in very low amounts and Sachs
unknowingly provided these nutrients as impurities in
the salts and water he used to make up his nutri-
ent solution. Analytical techniques have now improved
to the point where it is possible to detect mineral
contents several orders of magnitude lower than was
possible in Sachs’s time. Most mineral elements are
now measured by either atomic absorption spectrome-
try or atomic emission spectrometry. These techniques
involve vaporization of the elements at temperatures

in excess of several thousand degrees. In the vaporous
state, the element will either absorb or emit light at
very narrow wavelength bands. The wavelength of light
absorbed or emitted is characteristic of a particular ele-
ment and the quantity of absorbed or emitted energy
is proportional to the concentration of the element
in the sample. In this way, concentrations as low as
10−8 g ml−1 for some elements can be measured in
samples of plant tissue, soil, or nutrient solutions within
a few minutes.

a

of
plant
physiology and other botanical research is conducted
with plants grown under controlled environments. This
may include relatively simple greenhouses or complex
growth rooms in which temperature and lighting are
carefully regulated. Plant nutrient supply must also be
regulated, and over the years a large number of nutrient
solutions have been formulated for this purpose. Most
modern formulations are based on a solution originally
developed by D. R. Hoagland, a pioneer in the study
of plant mineral nutrition. Individual investigators
may introduce minor modiﬁcations to the composi-
tion of the nutrient solution in order to accommo-
date speciﬁc needs. Such formulations are commonly
referred
to
as
modiﬁed
Hoagland’s
solutions
(Tables 4.2, 4.3).
The concentration of minerals in most nutrient
solutions is many times greater than that normally found
in soils. An excess is necessary in order to maintain a
continual supply of nutrients as they are taken up by the
roots. The nutrient concentration of the soil solution,
on the other hand, is relatively low but is continually
replenished by nutrients adsorbed on the soil particles
(Chapter 3).

4.1.3 MODERN TECHNIQUES
OVERCOME INHERENT
DISADVANTAGES OF SIMPLE
SOLUTION CULTURE
In the simplest form of solution culture, a seedling is
supported in the lid of a container, with its roots free
to grow in the nutrient solution (Figure 4.1). Note that
the solution must be aerated in order to obtain optimal
root growth and nutrient uptake. A solution that is not
aerated becomes depleted of oxygen, a condition known
as anoxia. Anoxia inhibits the respiration of root cells
and, because nutrient uptake requires energy, reduces
nutrient uptake. The container in which the plants
are grown is usually painted black or wrapped with an
opaque material in order to keep out light. The purpose

of excluding light is to reduce the growth of algae that
would compete with the plants for nutrients or possibly
produce toxic byproducts.
There are some disadvantages in the use of a simple
solution culture to study the nutrient requirements of
plants. The major problems are a selective depletion of
ions and associated changes in the pH of the solution
that occur as the roots continue to absorb nutrients.
Plants maintained in pure solution culture will con-
tinue to grow vigorously only if the nutrient solution
is replenished on a regular basis. In order to avoid
such problems, some investigators grow the plants in a
nonnutritive medium such as acid-washed quartz sand,
perlite, or vermiculite.1 Plants can then be watered by
daily application of fresh nutrient solution from the top
of the medium (a technique called slop culture) or
by slowly dripping onto the culture from a reservoir
(drip culture). Alternatively, the nutrient culture can
be subirrigated. In this case, the nutrient solution is

expands on heating to produce a lightweight product that has
high water retention and is commonly used as a mulch in seed
beds. Perlite is a coarsely ground glassy volcanic rock. Both

provide no plant nutrients.
alternately pumped into the culture from below and
then allowed to drain out. This ﬁll-and-empty pro-
cess is repeated on a regular basis and serves both
to replenish the nutrient solution and to aerate the
roots. Most commercial hydroponic operations now
utilize some variation of the nutrient ﬁlm technique
in which the roots are continuously bathed with a
thin ﬁlm of recirculating nutrient solution (Figure 4.2).
The advantage of the nutrient ﬁlm technique is that it
not only provides for good aeration of the roots and
nutrient uptake; it also allows the pH and nutrient con-
tent of the solution to be continuously monitored and
adjusted.
These methods overcome some of the problems
inherent in pure solution culture, but may not be
suitable for many laboratory experiments. This is
because no medium is truly nonnutritive. Any medium,
even the glass, plastic, or ceramic containers used
in solution culture, may provide some nutrients at
very low levels. For example, soft (sodium silicate)
glass

sodium,

4.2 The Essential Nutrient Elements
65
4.2 THE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT
ELEMENTS
4.2.1 SEVENTEEN ELEMENTS ARE
DEEMED TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR
PLANT GROWTH AND
DEVELOPMENT
Most plants require a relatively small number of nutri-
ent elements in order to successfully complete their
life cycle. Those that are required are deemed to be
essential nutrient elements. Essentiality is based pri-
marily on two criteria formulated by E. Epstein in 1972.
According to Epstein, an element is considered essential
if (1) in its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal
life cycle, or (2) that element is part of some essential plant
constituent or metabolite. By the ﬁrst criterion, if a plant
is unable to produce viable seed when deprived of that
element, then that element is deemed essential. By the
second criterion, an element such as magnesium would
be considered essential because it is a constituent of
the chlorophyll molecule and chlorophyll is essential for
photosynthesis. Similarly, chlorine is essential because
it is a necessary factor in the photosynthetic oxidation
of water. Most elements satisfy both criteria, although
either one alone is usually considered sufﬁcient.
Although the criteria for essentiality are quite clear,
it is not always easy to demonstrate that an element is or
is not essential. D. Arnon and P. Stout had earlier sug-
gested a third criterion: they suggested that an essential
element must act directly in the metabolism of the plant
and not simply to correct an unfavorable microbial or
chemical condition in the nutrient medium. The use of
solution cultures, from which the element in question
has been omitted, has largely circumvented the need
to apply this third criterion. On the other hand, some
plants may form viable seeds even though a particular
element has been excluded from the nutrient solution
and other symptoms of deﬁciency are evident. In such
cases there may be present in the seed, or contaminating
the nutrient solution, a quantity of the element sufﬁcient
to moderate the deﬁciency and allow seed formation.
It is assumed that in the complete absence of a nutri-
ent, the deﬁciency symptoms would be severe enough
to kill the plant before viable seed could be formed.
If required, this can be conﬁrmed by careful puriﬁ-
cation of nutrient salts and exclusion of atmospheric
contaminants. Where a sufﬁcient quantity of the ele-
ment may be carried within the seed, essentiality can
be conﬁrmed by growing several successive generations
from seed that was itself produced in the absence of that
element. This is usually sufﬁcient to reduce the con-
centration of that element in the seed to the deﬁcient
range.
It is generally agreed, based on these criteria, that
only 17 elements are essential for the growth of all
higher plants (Table 4.4).
4.2.2 THE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS
ARE GENERALLY CLASSED AS
EITHER MACRONUTRIENTS
OR MICRONUTRIENTS
The essential elements are traditionally segregated into
two categories: (1) the so-called macronutrients and (2)
the trace elements or micronutrients. The distinction
between macro- and micronutrients simply reﬂects the
relative concentrations found in tissue or required in
nutrient solutions (Table 4.4) and does not infer impor-
tance relative to the nutritional needs of the plant. The
ﬁrst nine elements in Table 4.4 are called macronutrients
because they are required in large amounts (in excess
of 10 mmole kg−1 of dry weight). The macronutrients
are largely, but not exclusively, involved in the structure
of molecules, which to some extent accounts for the
need for large quantities. The remaining eight essential
elements are considered micronutrients. Micronutri-
ents are required in relatively small quantities (less
than 10 mmole kg−1 of dry weight) and serve catalytic
and regulatory roles such as enzyme activators. Some
macronutrients, calcium and magnesium for example,
serve as regulators in addition to their structural role.
4.2.3 DETERMINING ESSENTIALITY
OF MICRONUTRIENTS PRESENTS
SPECIAL PROBLEMS
The essentiality of micronutrients is particularly difﬁcult
to establish because they are required in such small
quantities. Most micronutrient requirements are fully
satisﬁed by concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 μg
L−1—amounts that are readily obtained from impurities
in water or macronutrient salts, the containers in which
the plants are grown, and contamination by atmospheric
dust. A micronutrient may be required at concentrations
below detectable limits, so it is far easier to establish that
a micronutrient is essential than that it is not.
As micronutrients go, iron is usually supplied at
relatively high concentrations. This is necessary because
availability of iron is very sensitive to pH and other soil
conditions. At a pH above 7, iron tends to form insol-
uble iron hydroxides and calcium complexes. In acidic
solution, iron reacts with aluminum to form insoluble
complexes. In both cases, iron readily precipitates out
of solution and, consequently, is frequently deﬁcient in
natural situations. For these reasons, the need for iron
as an essential plant nutrient was established early in the
study of plant nutrition. The need for other micronutri-
ents, however, was not recognized until salts of sufﬁcient
purity became available in the early part of the twentieth
century. In some cases, what had been for some time
recognized as a plant disease turned out to be a nutri-
ent deﬁciency. In 1922, for example, J. S. McHargue
demonstrated that the disorder known as gray speck of oats
was actually caused by a manganese deﬁciency, and the

following year Katherine Warington showed that boron
was required for several legume species. By 1939, the
need for zinc, copper, and molybdenum had also been
clearly established. In each case, the nutrient deﬁciency
was found to cause a well-known disorder previously
thought to be a disease. Chlorine was not added to the
list until 1954, although its essential nature was sug-
gested nearly one hundred years earlier. The need for
chlorine became evident in the course of experiments
to determine whether cobalt was required for tomato
(Lycopersicum esculentum). T. C. Broyer and his cowork-
ers had puriﬁed their nutrient salts by methods that
removed not only cobalt but halides (including chlo-
rine) as well. Plants grown in solutions prepared from
these puriﬁed salts developed browning and necrosis
of the leaves. The symptoms could be avoided by sup-
plementing the nutrient solution with cobalt chloride.
Subsequent investigation, however, established that it
was the deﬁciency of chloride rather than cobalt that
gave rise to the symptoms.
There is now mounting evidence that nickel should
be added to the list of essential elements. Nickel is
an essential component of urease, an enzyme widely
distributed in plants, microorganisms, and some marine
invertebrates. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea
into NH3 and CO2 and is thought to play an important
role in mobilization of nitrogenous compound in plants.
In 1987, P. H. Brown and his colleagues showed that
nickel depletion led to the formation of nonviable seed
in barley (Hordeum vulgare). The addition of nickel
would bring to 17 the total number of nutrient elements
essential for higher plants.
4.3 BENEFICIAL ELEMENTS
In addition to the 17 essential elements listed in
Table 4.4, some plants appear to have additional
requirements. However, because these have not been
shown to be requirements of higher plants generally,
they are excluded from the list of essential elements.
They are referred to instead as beneﬁcial elements.
If these elements are essential to all plants, they are
required by most at concentrations well below what can
be reliably detected by present analytical techniques.
The deﬁnition of beneﬁcial currently applies primarily
to sodium, silicon, selenium, and cobalt. With time,
and as experimental methods improve, one or more of
these beneﬁcial elements may be added to the list of
essential elements.
4.3.1 SODIUM IS AN ESSENTIAL
MICRONUTRIENT FOR C4 PLANTS
A sodium requirement was ﬁrst demonstrated for the
bladder salt-bush (Atriplex vesicaria), a perennial pasture
species of arid inland areas of Australia. By carefully

purifying the water, recrystallizing the nutrient salts,
and using sodium-free vessels, P. F. Brownell and C. J.
Wood were able to reduce the sodium content of the
ﬁnal culture medium to less than 1.6 μg L−1. Plants
grown in the depleted solution showed reduced growth,
chlorosis (yellowing due to loss of chlorophyll), and
necrosis (dead tissue) of the leaves. Based on a survey
of 32 species of plants, it was concluded that sodium is
generally essential as a micronutrient for plants utilizing
speciﬁcally the C4 photosynthetic pathway, but not for
most C3 plants (see Chapter 8 and 15).
4.3.2 SILICON MAY BE BENEFICIAL
FOR A VARIETY OF SPECIES
Given the high content of silicon dioxide in normal
soils, it should not be surprising that many plants take
up appreciable quantities of silicon. Silicon may com-
prise 1 to 2 percent of the dry matter of maize (Zea
mays) and other grasses and as much as 16 percent of the
scouring rush (Equisetum arvense), yet experiments have
generally failed to demonstrate that silicon is essential
for most other plants.2 The ubiquitous presence of sili-
con in glass, nutrient salts, and atmospheric dust makes
it especially difﬁcult to exclude silicon from nutrient
experiments. However, there are numerous reports of
beneﬁcial effects of silicon in a variety of species. Silicon
seems to be particularly beneﬁcial to grasses, where it
accumulates in the cell walls, especially of epidermal
cells, and may play a role in fending off fungal infections
or preventing lodging, a condition in which stems are
bent over by heavy winds or rain.
4.3.3 COBALT IS REQUIRED BY
NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA
Cobalt is essential for the growth of legumes, which are
hosts to symbiotic nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria (Chapter 11).
In this case, the requirement can be traced to the needs of
the nitrogen-ﬁxing bacterium rather than the host plant.
A similar cobalt requirement has been demonstrated for
the free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria, including the
cyanobacteria. In addition, when legumes are provided
with ﬁxed nitrogen such as nitrate, a cobalt requirement
cannot be demonstrated.
4.3.4 SOME PLANTS TOLERATE HIGH
CONCENTRATIONS OF SELENIUM
Selenium salts tend to accumulate in poorly drained,
arid regions of the western plains of North America.
Although selenium is generally toxic to most plants, cer-
2Grazing animals appear to have adapted to the high silicon
content of grasses. The teeth of grazing animals (such as cows
and horses) grow continuously, compensating for the wear
caused largely by silicon. On the other hand, the teeth of
browsing animals such as deer, whose diets contain little
grass, do not continue to grow.
tain members of the legume genus Astragalus (milk-vetch
or poison-vetch) are known to tolerate high concentra-
tions of selenium (up to 0.5 percent dry weight) and are
found only on soils containing relatively high concen-
trations of selenium. Such concentrations of selenium
would be toxic to most other plants. At one time it was
thought that selenium might be essential to these ‘‘accu-
mulator species,’’ but there is no deﬁnitive supporting
evidence.
Selenium accumulators are of considerable impor-
tance to ranchers, however, as they are among a diverse
group of plants known as ‘‘loco weeds.’’ The high sele-
nium content in these plants causes a sickness known as
alkali poisoning or ‘‘blind-staggers’’ in grazing animals.
4.4 NUTRIENT FUNCTIONS AND
DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS
The essential elements are essential because they have
speciﬁc metabolic functions in plants. When they are
absent, plants will exhibit characteristic deﬁciency symp-
toms that, in most cases, are related to one or more of
those functions.
Some students of plant mineral nutrition prefer to
classify the macro- and micronutrients along functional
lines. For example, elements such as carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen have a predominantly structural role—they
are the stuff of which molecules are made—while others
appear to be predominantly involved in regulatory roles,
such as maintaining ion balance and activating enzymes.
Other investigators have proposed more complicated
schemes with up to four categories of biochemical
function. Unfortunately, any attempt to categorize the
nutrient elements in this way runs into difﬁculty because
the same element often ﬁlls both structural and non-
structural roles. Magnesium, for example, is an essential
component of the chlorophyll molecule but also serves
as a cofactor for many enzymes, including ATPases and
others involved in critical energy-transfer reactions. Cal-
cium is an important constituent of cell walls where its
role is largely structural, but there are also Ca-ATPases
and calcium is implicated as a second messenger in hor-
mone responses and photomorphogenesis (Chapters 16,
17, 22). Regardless of how they are classiﬁed, it is clear
that these elements are essential because they satisfy spe-
ciﬁc metabolic requirements of the plant. When those
requirements are not met or are only partially met,
the plant will exhibit characteristic deﬁciency symptoms
that, if severe enough, result in death.
4.4.1 A PLANT’S REQUIREMENT
FOR A PARTICULAR ELEMENT
IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF
CRITICAL CONCENTRATION
Typically, when the supply of an essential element
becomes limiting, growth is reduced. The concentration

FIGURE 4.3 Generalized plot of growth as a function of
nutrient concentration in tissue. The critical concentra-
tion is that concentration giving a 10 percent reduction
in growth. At concentrations less than critical, the nutri-
ent is said to be deﬁcient. Greater concentrations are
considered adequate.
of that nutrient, measured in the tissue, just below the
level that gives maximum growth, is deﬁned as the
critical concentration. This concept is illustrated in
Figure 4.3. At concentrations above the critical concen-
tration, additional increments in nutrient content will
have no beneﬁcial effect on growth and the nutrient
content is said to be adequate. At concentrations below
the critical concentration, the nutrient content becomes
deﬁcient and growth falls off sharply. In other words,
at tissue nutrient levels below the critical concentration,
that nutrient becomes limiting to growth.
When nutrient levels exceed the critical concentra-
tion, that nutrient is, with one qualiﬁcation, no longer
limiting. The qualiﬁcation is that at sufﬁciently high
tissue levels, virtually all nutrients become toxic. Toxic
levels are seldom achieved with the macronutrients,
but are common in the case of the micronutrients
(Section 4.5). Normal concentrations of copper, for
example, are in the range of 4 to 15 μg g−1 of tissue
dry weight (dwt). Deﬁciency occurs at concentrations
below 4 μg but most plants are severely damaged by
concentrations in excess of 20 μg g−1 dwt. Boron is toxic
above 75 μg g−1 dwt and zinc above 200 μg g−1 dwt.
Since each element has one or more speciﬁc struc-
tural or functional roles in the plant, in the absence
of that element the plant will be expected to exhibit
certain morphological or biochemical symptoms of that
deﬁciency. In some cases the deﬁciency symptoms will
clearly reﬂect the functional role of that element. One
example is yellowing, or chlorosis, which is charac-
teristic of several nutrient deﬁciencies. In the case of
magnesium deﬁciency, for example, the plant turns yel-
low because it is unable to synthesize the green pigment
chlorophyll. In other cases, the relationship between
deﬁciency symptoms and the functional role of the ele-
ment may not always be so straightforward. Moreover,
deﬁciency symptoms for some elements are not always
consistent between one plant and the next. Nonetheless,
for each element there are certain generalizations that
can be made with respect to deﬁciency symptoms.
Deﬁciency symptoms also depend in part on the
mobility of the element in the plant. Where elements
are mobilized within the plant and exported to young
developing tissues, deﬁciency symptoms tend to appear
ﬁrst in older tissues. Other elements are relatively
immobile—once located in a tissue they are not readily
mobilized for use elsewhere. In this case, the deﬁciency
symptoms tend to appear ﬁrst in the younger tissues.
In this section we will review the functional roles of
the essential elements and, in general terms, morpho-
logical and biochemical abnormalities that result from
their deﬁciencies. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen will
be excluded from this discussion as they are required
for the structural backbone of all organic molecules.
A deﬁciency of carbon, consequently, leads quickly to
starvation of the plant, while a deﬁciency of water leads
to desiccation. Instead, our discussion will be limited to
deﬁciencies of those essential elements taken in from
the soil solution.
4.4.2 NITROGEN IS A CONSTITUENT
OF MANY CRITICAL
MACROMOLECULES
Although the atmosphere is approximately 80 percent
nitrogen, only certain prokaryote species—bacteria
and
cyanobacteria—can
utilize
gaseous
nitrogen
directly. The special problems of nitrogen availability
and metabolism are addressed in Chapter 11. To
summarize, most plants absorb nitrogen from the soil
solution primarily as inorganic nitrate ion (NO−
3 ) and,
in a few cases, as ammonium (NH+
4 ) ion. Once in the
plant, NO−
3 must be reduced to NH+
4 before it can
be incorporated into amino acids, proteins, and other
nitrogenous organic molecules. Nitrogen is most often
limiting in agricultural situations. Many plants, such as
maize (Zea mays), are known as ‘‘heavy feeders’’ and
require heavy applications of nitrogen fertilizer. The
manufacture and distribution of nitrogen fertilizers for
agriculture are, in both energy and ﬁnancial terms, an
extremely costly process.
Nitrogen is a constituent of many important
molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, certain
hormones (e.g., indole-3-acetic acid; cytokinin), and
chlorophyll. It should not be surprising, then, that the

4.4 Nutrient Functions and Deﬁciency Symptoms
69
most overt symptoms of nitrogen deﬁciency are a slow,
stunted growth and a general chlorosis of the leaves.
Nitrogen is very mobile in the plant. As the older leaves
yellow and die, the nitrogen is mobilized, largely in the
form of soluble amines and amides, and exported from
the older leaves to the younger, more rapidly developing
leaves. Thus the symptoms of nitrogen deﬁciency gen-
erally appear ﬁrst in the older leaves and do not occur in
the younger leaves until the deﬁciency becomes severe.
At this point, the older leaves will turn completely
yellow or brown and fall off the plant. Conditions of
nitrogen stress will also lead to an accumulation of
anthocyanin pigments in many species, contributing a
purplish color to the stems, petioles, and the underside
of leaves. The precise cause of anthocyanin accumula-
tion in nitrogen-starved plants is not known. It may be
related to an overproduction of carbon structures that,
in the absence of nitrogen, cannot be utilized to make
amino acids and other nitrogen-containing compounds.
Excess nitrogen
normally
stimulates
abundant
growth of the shoot system, favoring a high shoot/root
ratio, and will often delay the onset of ﬂowering
in agricultural and horticultural crops. Similarly, a
deﬁciency of nitrogen reduces shoot growth and
stimulates early ﬂowering.
4.4.3 PHOSPHOROUS IS PART OF THE
NUCLEIC ACID BACKBONE AND
HAS A CENTRAL FUNCTION IN
INTERMEDIARY METABOLISM
Phosphorous is available in the soil solution primarily
as forms of the polyprotic phosphoric acid (H3PO4).
A polyprotic acid contains more than one proton, each
with a different dissociation constant. Soil pH thus
assumes a major role in the availability of phosphorous.
At a soil pH less than 6.8, the predominant form of
phosphorous and the form most readily taken up by
roots is the monovalent orthophosphate anion (H2PO−
4 ).
Between pH 6.8 and pH 7.2, the predominant form is
HPO2−
4 , which is less readily absorbed by the roots.
In alkaline soils (pH greater than 7.2), the predomi-
nant form is the trivalent PO3−
4 , which is essentially not
available for uptake by plants. The actual concentra-
tion of soluble phosphorous in most soils is relatively
low—on the order of 1 μM—because of several fac-
tors. One factor is the propensity of phosphorous to
form insoluble complexes. At neutral pH, for example,
phosphorous tends to form insoluble complexes with
aluminum and iron, while in basic soils calcium and
magnesium complexes will precipitate the phospho-
rous. Because insoluble phosphates are only very slowly
released into the soil solution, phosphorous is always
limited in highly calcareous soils.
Substantial amounts of phosphorous may also be
bound up in organic forms, which are not available for
uptake by plants. Organic phosphorous must ﬁrst be
converted to an inorganic form by the action of soil
microorganisms, or through the action of phosphatase
enzymes released by the roots, before it is available for
uptake. In addition, plants must compete with the soil
microﬂora for the small amounts of phosphorous that
are available. For these sorts of reasons, phosphorous,
rather than nitrogen, is most commonly the limiting
element in natural ecosystems. One of the more suc-
cessful strategies developed by plants for increasing the
uptake of phosphorous is the formation of intimate asso-
ciations between roots and soil fungi, called mycorrhiza.
Mycorrhizal associations were discussed in Chapter 3.
In the plant, phosphorous is found largely as phos-
phate esters—including the sugar-phosphates, which
play such an important role in photosynthesis and inter-
mediary metabolism. Other important phosphate esters
are the nucleotides that make up DNA and RNA as well
as the phospholipids present in membranes. Phospho-
rous in the form of nucleotides such as ATP and ADP, as
well as inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphorylated sugars,
and phosphorylated organic acids also plays an integral
role in the energy metabolism of cells.
The most characteristic manifestation of phospho-
rous deﬁciency is an intense green coloration of the
leaves. In the extreme, the leaves may become mal-
formed and exhibit necrotic spots. In some cases, the
blue and purple anthocyanin pigments also accumulate,
giving the leaves a dark greenish-purple color. Like
nitrogen, phosphorous is readily mobilized and redis-
tributed in the plant, leading to the rapid senescence
and death of the older leaves. The stems are usually
shortened and slender and the yield of fruits and seeds
is markedly reduced.
An excess of phosphorous has the opposite effect of
nitrogen in that it preferentially stimulates growth of
roots over shoots, thus reducing the shoot/root ratio.
Fertilizers with a high phosphorous content, such as
bone meal, are often applied when transplanting peren-
nial plants in order to encourage establishment of a
strong root system.
4.4.4 POTASSIUM ACTIVATES
ENZYMES AND FUNCTIONS IN
OSMOREGULATION
Potassium (K+) is the most abundant cellular cation
and so is required in large amounts by most plants.
In agricultural practice, potassium is usually provided
as potash (potassium carbonate, K2CO3). Potassium is
frequently deﬁcient in sandy soils because of its high
solubility and the ease with which K+ leaches out of
sandy soils. Potassium is an activator for a number of
enzymes, most notably those involved in photosynthesis
and respiration. Starch and protein synthesis are also
affected by potassium deﬁciency. Potassium serves an

70
Chapter 4 / Plants and Inorganic Nutrients
important function in regulating the osmotic potential
of cells (Chapter 3). As an osmoregulator, potassium
is a principal factor in plant movements, such as the
opening and closure of stomatal guard cells (Chapter 8)
and the sleep movements, or daily changes in the ori-
entation of leaves (Chapter 23). Because it is highly
mobile, potassium also serves to balance the charge of
both diffusible and nondiffusible anions.
Unlike other macronutrients, potassium is not
structurally bound in the plant, but like nitrogen and
phosphorous is highly mobile. Deﬁciency symptoms
ﬁrst appear in older leaves, which characteristically
develop mottling or chlorosis, followed by necrotic
lesions (spots of dead tissue) at the leaf margins. In
monocotyledonous plants, especially maize and other
cereals, the necrotic lesions begin at the older tips of the
leaves and gradually progress along the margins to the
younger cells near the leaf base. Stems are shortened
and weakened and susceptibility to root-rotting fungi is
increased. The result is that potassium-deﬁcient plants
are easily lodged.
4.4.5 SULFUR IS AN IMPORTANT
CONSTITUENT OF PROTEINS,
COENZYMES, AND VITAMINS
Several forms of sulfur are found in most soils, including
iron sulﬁdes and elemental sulfur. Sulfur is taken up by
plants, however, as the divalent sulfate anion (SO2−
4 ).
Sulfur deﬁciency is not a common problem because
there are numerous microorganisms capable of oxidiz-
ing sulﬁdes or decomposing organic sulfur compounds.
In addition, heavy consumption of fossil fuels in indus-
try as well as natural phenomena such as geysers, hot
sulfur springs, and volcanos together contribute large
amounts of sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3) to the atmo-
sphere. Indeed it is often difﬁcult to demonstrate sulfur
deﬁciencies in greenhouses in industrial areas because
of the high concentrations of airborne sulfur.
Sulfur is particularly important in the structure of
proteins where disulphide bonds (—S—S—) between
neighboring cysteine and methionine residues con-
tribute to the tertiary structure, or folding. Sulfur is also
a constituent of the vitamins thiamine and biotin and
of coenzyme A, an important component in respiration
and fatty acid metabolism. In the form of iron-sulfur
proteins, such as ferredoxin, it is important in elec-
tron transfer reactions of photosynthesis and nitrogen
ﬁxation. The sulfur-containing thiocyanates and isoth-
iocyanates (also known as mustard oils) are responsible
for the pungent ﬂavors of mustards, cabbages, turnips,
horseradish, and other plants of the family Brassicaceae.
Because of the presence of mustard oils, many species
of the Brassicaceae prove fatal to livestock that graze
on them. Mustard oils also appear to serve as a defense
against insect herbivory.
Sulfur deﬁciency, like nitrogen, results in a general-
ized chlorosis of the leaf, including the tissues surround-
ing the vascular bundles. This is due to reduced protein
synthesis rather than a direct impairment of chloro-
phyll synthesis. However, chlorophyll is stabilized by
binding to protein in the chloroplast membranes. With
impaired protein synthesis, the ability to form stable
chlorophyll-protein complexes is also impaired. Unlike
nitrogen, however, sulfur is not readily mobilized in
most species and the symptoms tend to occur initially in
the younger leaves.
4.4.6 CALCIUM IS IMPORTANT IN CELL
DIVISION, CELL ADHESION, AND
AS A SECOND MESSENGER
Calcium is taken up as the divalent cation (Ca2+). Cal-
cium is abundant in most soils and is seldom deﬁcient
under natural conditions. Calcium is important to divid-
ing cells for two reasons. It plays a role in the mitotic
spindle during cell division and it forms calcium pec-
tates in the middle lamella of the cell plate that forms
between daughter cells. It is also required for the phys-
ical integrity and normal functioning of membranes
and, more recently, has been implicated as a second
messenger in a variety of hormonal and environmental
responses. As a second messenger involved in protein
phosphorylation, Ca2+ is an important factor in regu-
lating the activities of a number of enzymes.
Because of its role in dividing cells, calcium deﬁ-
ciency symptoms characteristically appear in the meris-
tematic regions where cell division is occurring and new
cell walls are being laid down. Young leaves are typi-
cally deformed and necrotic and, in extreme cases, death
of the meristem ensues. In solution cultures, calcium
deﬁciency results in poor root growth. The roots are
discolored and may feel ‘‘slippery’’ to the touch because
of the deterioration of the middle lamella. Calcium is
relatively immobile and the symptoms typically appear
in the youngest tissues ﬁrst.
4.4.7 MAGNESIUM IS A CONSTITUENT
OF THE CHLOROPHYLL
MOLECULE AND AN IMPORTANT
REGULATOR OF ENZYME
REACTION
Like calcium, magnesium is also taken up as the divalent
cation (Mg2+). Magnesium is generally less abundant
in soils than calcium but is required by plants in rela-
tively large amounts. Magnesium deﬁciencies are most
likely in strongly acid, sandy soils. Magnesium has sev-
eral important functions in the plant. By far the largest
proportion is found in the porphyrin moiety of the
chlorophyll molecule, but it is also required to stabi-
lize ribosome structure and is involved as an activator

4.4 Nutrient Functions and Deﬁciency Symptoms
71
for numerous critical enzymes. It is critical to reac-
tions involving ATP, where it serves to link the ATP
molecule to the active site of the enzyme. Mg2+ is also an
activator for both ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, two critical enzymes
in photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation (Chapters 8 and 15).
The ﬁrst and most pronounced symptom of mag-
nesium deﬁciency is chlorosis due to a breakdown of
chlorophyll in the lamina of the leaf that lie between
the veins. Chloroplasts in the region of the veins are for
some reason less susceptible to magnesium deﬁciency
and retain their chlorophyll much longer. Magnesium
is also quite mobile. It is readily withdrawn from the
older leaves and transported to the younger leaves that
are more actively growing and synthesizing chlorophyll.
Consequently, chlorosis due to Mg2+ deﬁciency is, at
least initially, most pronounced in the older leaves.
4.4.8 IRON IS REQUIRED FOR
CHLOROPHYLL SYNTHESIS
AND ELECTRON TRANSFER
REACTIONS
Of all the micronutrients, iron is required by plants in
the largest amounts (it is considered a macronutrient by
some). Iron may be taken up as either the ferric (Fe3+) or
ferrous (Fe2+) ion, although the latter is more common
due to its greater solubility.3 The importance of iron
is related to two important functions in the plant. It is
part of the catalytic group for many redox enzymes
and it is required for the synthesis of chlorophyll.
Important redox enzymes include the heme-containing
cytochromes and non-heme iron-sulfur proteins (e.g.,
Rieske proteins, ferredoxin, and photosystem I) involved
in photosynthesis (Chapter 7), respiration (Chapter 10)
and nitrogen ﬁxation (Chapter 11). During the course
of electron transfer the iron moiety is reversibly reduced
3In the scientiﬁc literature, particularly that body of literature
dealing with iron uptake by organisms, the ferric form of iron
is also referred to as Fe(III) (iron-three). By the same
convention, ferrous iron is referred to as FE(II) (iron-two).
from the ferric to the ferrous state. Iron is also a con-
stituent of several oxidase enzymes, such as catalase and
peroxidase.
Iron is not a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule
itself and its precise role in chlorophyll synthesis remains
somewhat of a mystery. There is, for example, no
deﬁnitive evidence that any of the enzymes involved
in chlorophyll synthesis are iron-dependent. Instead,
the iron requirement may be related to a more gen-
eral need for iron in the synthesis of the chloroplast
constituents, especially the electron transport proteins.
Iron deﬁciencies invariably lead to a simultaneous loss of
chlorophyll and degeneration of chloroplast structure.
Chlorosis appears ﬁrst in the interveinal regions of the
youngest leaves, because the mobility of iron in the plant
is very low and it is not easily withdrawn from the older
leaves. Chlorosis may progress to the veins and, if the
deﬁciency is severe enough, the very small leaves may
actually turn white.
Iron deﬁciencies are common because of the
propensity of Fe3+ to form insoluble hydrous oxides
(Fe2O3·3H2O) at biological pH. This problem is
particularly severe in neutral or alkaline calcareous
soils. On the other hand, iron is very soluble in
strongly acidic soils and iron toxicity due to excess
iron uptake can result. The problem of iron deﬁciency
can usually be overcome by providing chelated iron,
either directly to the soil or as a foliar spray. A chelate
(from the Greek, chele or claw) is a stable complex
formed between a metal ion and an organic molecule,
called a chelating agent or ligand. The ligand and the
metal ion share electron pairs, forming a coordinate
bond. Because chelating agents have a rather high
afﬁnity for most metal ions, formation of the complex
reduces the possibility for formation of insoluble
precipitates. At the same time, the metal can be easily
withdrawn from the chelate for uptake by the plant.
One of the more common synthetic chelating agents is
the sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) (Figure 4.4), known commercially as versene or
sequestrene. EDTA and similar commercially available
chelating agents, however, are not highly speciﬁc and
will bind a range of cations, including iron, copper,
FIGURE 4.4 Examples of organic acids
that function as chelating agents.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) is a synthetic acid in common
commercial use. Complexed with iron,
it is sold under the trade name Versen-
ate. Caffeic acid is one of several natu-
rally occurring phenolic acids that may
be secreted by roots.

zinc, manganese, and calcium. Natural chelating agents,
including porphyrins (as in hemoglobin, cytochromes,
and chlorophyll) and a variety of organic and phenolic
acids, are far more speciﬁc for iron.
The importance of iron in plant nutrition is high-
lighted by the strategies plants have developed for uptake
under conditions of iron stress. Iron deﬁciency induces
several morphological and biochemical changes in the
roots of dicots and nongraminaceous monocots. These

FIGURE 4.5 Two strategies for the solubilization and
uptake of sparingly soluble inorganic iron by higher
plants. (A) ATPase proton pumps in the root cortical
cells acidify the rhizosphere, which helps to solubilize as
Fe3+ (FeIII). The Fe3+ is then chelated by phenolic acids
(Ch), also secreted into the rhizosphere by the roots. The
chelated iron is carried to the root surface where it is
reduced by an FeIII reductase. The resulting Fe2+ (FeII) is
immediately transported across the plasma membrane by
an FeII transporter. Both the FeIII reductase and the FeII
are induced by iron deﬁciency. (B) Fe3+ is solubilized by
phytosiderophores (PS) secreted into the rhizosphere by
the root. The entire ferrisiderophore (siderophore-iron
complex) is then taken into the root cell where the iron
is subsequently released.
include the formation of specialized transfer cells in the
root epidermis, enhanced proton secretion into the soil
surrounding the roots, and the release of strong ligands,
such as caffeic acid (Figure 4.4), by the roots. Simul-
taneously, there is an induction of reducing enzymes
in the plasma membrane of the root epidermal cells.
Acidiﬁcation of the rhizosphere encourages chelation of
the Fe3+ with caffeic acid, which then moves to the root
surface where the iron is reduced to Fe2+ at the plasma
membrane (Figure 4.5A). Reduction to Fe2+ causes the
ligand to release the iron, which is immediately taken
up by the plant before it has the opportunity to form
insoluble precipitates.
A second strategy for iron uptake by organisms
involves the synthesis and release by the organism of
low-molecular-weight,
iron-binding
ligands
called
siderophores
(Gr.
iron-bearers).
Most
of
our
knowledge of siderophores comes from studies with
aerobic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and algae),
where they were ﬁrst discovered and have been studied
most extensively. More recently, however, it has
been discovered that siderophores are also released
by the roots of higher plants (Figure 4.6). Known as
phytosiderophores, to distinguish them from ligands
of microbial origin, these highly speciﬁc iron-binding
ligands have thus far been found only in members
of the family Gramineae, including the cereal grains.
Phytosiderophores are synthesized and released by the
plant only under conditions of iron stress, have a high
afﬁnity for Fe3+, and very effectively scavenge iron
from the rhizosphere. The distinctive feature of the
siderophore system is that the entire iron-phytosiderophore
complex, or ferrisiderophore, is then reabsorbed into the
roots (Figure 4.5B). Once inside the root, the iron is
presumably reduced to Fe2+ and released for use by
the cell. The fate of the phytosiderophore is unknown.
In microorganisms, siderophores may be chemically
degraded and metabolized or, alternatively, the same

molecule may again be secreted by the cell in order to
pick up more iron.
The study of phytosiderophores is a relatively young
ﬁeld and, although substantial progress has been made
in recent years, there is still much to be learned. It is not
yet known, for example, how widespread the use of phy-
tosiderophores is and the nature of the ferrisiderophore
transport system has not been demonstrated in plants.
One thing is clear: in those plants that use them, phy-
tosiderophores are an important and effective strategy
for supplying iron to the plant under conditions of iron
stress.
4.4.9 BORON APPEARS TO HAVE
A ROLE IN CELL DIVISION
AND ELONGATION AND
CONTRIBUTES TO THE
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY
OF THE CELL WALL
In aqueous solution, boron is present as boric acid, or
H3BO3. At physiological pH (<8), it is found predomi-
nantly in the undissociated form, which is preferred for
uptake by roots. With respect to its biochemical and
physiological role, boron is perhaps the least under-
stood of all the micronutrients. There is, for example,
no solid evidence for involvement of boron with speciﬁc
enzymes, either structurally or as an activator. Indeed,
most of what we know about the role of boron is based
entirely on studies of what happens to plants when boron
is withheld.
A substantial proportion of the total borate content
of cells is found in the cell wall. This is apparently
because borate has a propensity to form stable esters
with cell wall saccharides that have adjacent hydroxyl
groups. This so-called cis-diol conﬁguration is char-
acteristic of some common cell wall polysaccharides,
such as mannose and its derivatives. Glucose, fructose,
and galactose, on the other hand, do not have this
conﬁguration and so do not bind boron. The primary
walls of boron-deﬁcient cells exhibit marked structural
abnormalities, suggesting that boron is required for the
structural integrity of the cell wall.
Other responses to boron deﬁciency point toward
a role in cell division and elongation. One of the most
rapid responses to boron deﬁciency, for example, is
an inhibition of both cell division and elongation in
primary and secondary roots. This gives the roots a
stubby and bushy appearance. Cell division in the shoot
apex and young leaves is also inhibited, followed by
necrosis of the meristem. In addition, boron is known
to stimulate pollen tube germination and elongation. It
is not known how boron is involved in cell growth, but
both hormone and nucleic acid metabolism have been
implicated. Inhibition of cell division and elongation is
accompanied by an increased activity of enzymes that
oxidize the hormone indole-3-acetic acid and a decrease
in RNA content (possibly through impaired synthesis of
uracil, an RNA precursor).
In addition to the effects on shoot meristems noted
above, common symptoms of boron deﬁciency include
shortened internodes, giving the plant a bushy or rosette
appearance, and enlarged stems, leading to the disorder
known as ‘‘stem crack’’ in celery. In storage roots such as
sugar beets, the disorder known as ‘‘heart rot’’ is due to
the death of dividing cells in the growing region because
of boron deﬁciency.
4.4.10 COPPER IS A NECESSARY
COFACTOR FOR OXIDATIVE
ENZYMES
In well-aerated soils, copper is generally available to
the plant as the divalent cupric ion, Cu2+. Cu2+ readily
forms a chelate with humic acids in the organic fraction
of the soil and may be involved in providing copper to
the surface of the root. In wet soils with little oxygen,
Cu2+ is readily reduced to the cuprous form, Cu+, which
is unstable. As a plant nutrient, copper seems to function
primarily as a cofactor for a variety of oxidative enzymes.
These include the photosynthetic electron carrier plas-
tocyanin; cytochrome oxidase, which is the ﬁnal oxidase
enzyme in mitochondrial respiration; and ascorbic acid
oxidase. The browning of freshly cut apple and potato
surfaces is due to the activity of copper-containing
polyphenoloxidases (or phenolase). Superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD), which detoxiﬁes superoxide radicals
(O−
2 ), is another important copper enzyme.
Common disorders due to copper deﬁciency are
generally stunted growth, distortion of young leaves
and, particularly in citrus trees, a loss of young leaves
referred to as ‘‘summer dieback.’’
4.4.11 ZINC IS AN ACTIVATOR
OF NUMEROUS ENZYMES
Zinc is taken up by roots as the divalent cation Zn2+.
Zinc is an activator of a large number of enzymes, includ-
ing alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which catalyzes
the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol; carbonic
anhydrase (CA), which catalyzes the hydration of car-
bon dioxide to bicarbonate; and, copper SOD which
detoxiﬁes O2
−. However, there is general agreement
that disorders associated with zinc deﬁciency reﬂect dis-
turbances in the metabolism of the auxin hormone
indole-3-acetic acid. Typically, zinc-deﬁcient plants
have shortened internodes and smaller leaves (e.g., ‘‘lit-
tle leaf ’’ disorder of fruit trees). The precise role of zinc
in auxin metabolism remains obscure, but auxin lev-
els in zinc-deﬁcient plants are known to decline before
the overt symptoms of zinc deﬁciency appear. Further-
more, restoration of the zinc supply is followed by a

74
Chapter 4 / Plants and Inorganic Nutrients
rapid increase in hormone level and then resumption
of growth. Available evidence supports the view that
zinc is required for synthesis of the hormone precursor
tryptophan.
4.4.12 MANGANESE IS AN ENZYME
COFACTOR AS WELL AS PART
OF THE OXYGEN-EVOLVING
COMPLEX IN THE
CHLOROPLAST
Manganese is absorbed and transported within the plant
mainly as the divalent cation Mn2+. Manganese is
required as a cofactor for a number of enzymes, particu-
larly decarboxylase and dehydrogenase enzymes, which
play a critical role in the respiratory carbon cycle. Inter-
estingly, manganese can often substitute for magnesium
in reactions involving, for example, ATP. However, the
best known and most studied function of manganese is
in photosynthetic oxygen evolution (Chapter 7). In the
form of a manganoprotein, manganese is part of the
oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem
II, where it accumulates charges during the oxidation of
water.
Manganese deﬁciency can be widespread in some
areas, depending on soil conditions, weather, and crop
species. Deﬁciency is aggravated by low soil pH (<6)
and high organic content. Manganese deﬁciency is
responsible for ‘‘gray speck’’ of cereal grains, a dis-
order characterized by the appearance of greenish-gray,
oval-shaped spots on the basal regions of young leaves.
It may cause extreme chlorosis between the leaf veins as
well as discoloration and deformities in legume seeds.
4.4.13 MOLYBDENUM IS A KEY
COMPONENT OF NITROGEN
METABOLISM
Although molybdenum is a metal, its properties more
closely resemble those of the nonmetals. In aqueous
solution it occurs mainly as the molybdate ion MoO2−
4 .
Molybdenum requirements are among the lowest of
all known micronutrients and appear to be primarily
related to its role in nitrogen metabolism. Among the
several enzymes found to require molybdenum are dini-
trogenase and nitrate reductase. The molybdenum
requirement of a plant thus depends to some extent
on the mode of nitrogen supply (Chapter 11). Dini-
trogenase is the enzyme used by prokaryotes, including
those in symbiotic association with higher plants, to
reduce atmospheric nitrogen. Nitrate reductase is found
in roots and leaves where it catalyzes the reduction of
nitrate to nitrite, a necessary ﬁrst step in the incorpora-
tion of nitrogen into amino acids and other metabolites.
In plants such as legumes, which depend on nitrogen
ﬁxation, molybdenum deﬁciency gives rise to symptoms
of nitrogen deﬁciency. When nitrogen supplies are ade-
quate, a deﬁciency of molybdenum shows up as a classic
disorder known as ‘‘whiptail’’ in which the young leaves
are twisted and deformed. The same plants may exhibit
interveinal chlorosis and necrosis along the veins of
older leaves. Like many of the micronutrients, molyb-
denum deﬁciency is highly species dependent—it is
particularly widespread for legumes, members of the
family Brassicaceae, and for maize. Molybdenum deﬁ-
ciency is aggravated in acid soils with a high content of
iron precipitates, which strongly adsorb the molybdate
ion.
4.4.14 CHLORINE HAS A ROLE IN
PHOTOSYNTHETIC OXYGEN
EVOLUTION AND CHARGE
BALANCE ACROSS CELLULAR
MEMBRANES
Chloride ion (Cl−) is ubiquitous in nature and highly
soluble. It is thus rarely, if ever, deﬁcient. Deﬁciencies
normally can be shown only in very carefully controlled
solution culture experiments. Along with manganese,
chloride is required for the oxygen-evolving reactions
of photosynthesis (Chapter 7). Cl−is a highly mobile
anion with two principal functions: it is both a major
counter-ion to diffusible cations, thus maintaining elec-
trical neutrality across membranes, and one of the
principal osmotically active solutes in the vacuole. Chlo-
ride ion also appears to be required for cell division in
both leaves and shoots. Chloride is readily taken up and
most plants accumulate chloride ion far in excess of their
minimal requirements. Plants deprived of chloride tend
to exhibit reduced growth, wilting of the leaf tips, and a
general chlorosis.
4.4.15 THE ROLE OF NICKEL
IS NOT CLEAR
Nickel is a relatively recent addition to the list of essen-
tial nutrient elements. Nickel is an abundant metallic
element and is readily absorbed by roots. It is ubiq-
uitous in plant tissues, usually in the range of 0.05 to
5.0 mg Kg−1 dry weight. One of the principal difﬁculties
encountered in attempting to establish a role for nickel
is its extremely low requirement. It has been estimated
that the quantity of nickel needed by a plant to complete
one life cycle is approximately 200 ng, a requirement
that can be met by the initial nickel content of the seed
in most cases. In order to establish a nickel deﬁciency,
it is necessary to undertake extensive puriﬁcation of the
nutrient salts and then grow several successive genera-
tions to seed in nickel-deﬁcient solutions. The strongest
evidence in favor of essential status for nickel is based
on studies with legumes and cereal grains. In one such
study of barley (Hordeum vulgare), the critical nickel

Summary
75
concentration for seed germination was found to be
90 ng g−1 of seed dry weight. By growing plants for
three generations in the absence of nickel, the nickel
content of the seed could be reduced to 7.0 ng g−1 dry
weight. Germination of these seeds was less than 12 per-
cent. When the plants were grown for the same number
of generations in nutrient solution supplemented with
0.6 μM or 1.0 μM nickel, seed germination was 57 and
95 percent, respectively. In other studies, nickel deﬁ-
ciencies have led to depressed seedling vigor, chlorosis,
and necrotic lesions in leaves.
The basis for a nickel requirement by plants is
not clear, but it may be related to mobilization of
nitrogen during seed germination. Nickel is known to be
a component of two enzymes; urease and hydrogenase.
Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into NH3 and
CO2 and is found widely through the plant kingdom.
Urease from jack bean seeds (Canavalia ensiformis) was
in fact the ﬁrst protein to be crystallized by J. B. Sumner
in 1926. One of the principal effects of nickel deﬁ-
ciency in soybean (Glycine max) is decreased urease
activity in the leaves, although the metabolic signiﬁcance
of urease is not yet clear.
Free urea is rarely, if ever, detected in plant tissue,
but it is formed by the action of the enzyme arginase
on arginine and its structural analog, canavanine
(Chapter 11). Canavanine, a nonprotein amino acid, is
abundant in the seeds of some plant groups, such as jack
bean, but its concentration diminishes rapidly upon
germination. Arginine is also abundant in seeds and
both amino acids could function as stored nitrogen that
is readily mobilized during seed germination. If this
view should be proven valid, then urease, and thus nickel
as well, would play an important role in the mobilization
of nitrogen during germination and early seedling
growth.
A common form of mobile nitrogen in some
legumes is a family of urea-based compounds known as
ureides, such as allantoic acid or citrulline (Chapter 11).
Ureides are formed in root nodules during nitrogen
ﬁxation and transported via the xylem throughout
the host plant. Ureides are also formed in senescing
leaves and transported out to the developing seeds
for storage. The breakdown of ureides produces urea,
which accumulates to toxic levels in Ni-deﬁcient plants.
Furthermore, the metabolism of purine bases (adenine
and guanine) in all plants also produces ureides. It
seems reasonable to assume that most, if not all, plants
have a requirement for urease and nickel.
Hydrogenase is another important enzyme in some
nitrogen-ﬁxing plants. Hydrogenase is responsible for
recovering hydrogen for use in the nitrogen-ﬁxing
process (Chapter 11). A deﬁciency of nickel leads to
depressed levels of hydrogenase activity in the nodules
of soybean, which in turn would be expected to depress
the efﬁciency of nitrogen ﬁxation.
4.5 TOXICITY OF
MICRONUTRIENTS
As a group, the micronutrient elements are an excellent
example of the dangers of excess. Most have a rather nar-
row adequate range and become toxic at relatively low
concentrations. Critical toxicity levels, deﬁned as the
tissue concentration that gives a 10 percent reduction in
dry matter, vary widely between the several micronutri-
ents as well as between plant species. As noted earlier,
critical concentrations for copper, boron, and zinc are
on the order of 20, 75, and 200 μg g−1 dry weight,
respectively. On the other hand, critical toxicity lev-
els for manganese vary from 200 μg g−1 dry weight for
corn, to 600 μg g−1 for soybean, and 5300 μg g−1 for sun-
ﬂower. Toxicity symptoms are often difﬁcult to decipher
because an excess of one nutrient may induce deﬁciencies
of other nutrients. For example, the classic symptom of
manganese toxicity, which often occurs in waterlogged
soils, is the appearance of brown spots due to deposi-
tion of MnO2 surrounded by chlorotic veins. But excess
manganese may also induce deﬁciencies of iron, mag-
nesium, and calcium. Manganese competes with both
iron and magnesium for uptake and with magnesium for
binding to enzymes. Manganese also inhibits calcium
translocation into the shoot apex, causing a disorder
known as ‘‘crinkle leaf.’’ Thus the dominant symptoms
of manganese toxicity may actually be the symptoms of
iron, magnesium, and/or calcium deﬁciency.
Excess micronutrients typically inhibit root growth,
not because the roots are more sensitive than shoots but
because roots are the ﬁrst organ to accumulate the nutri-
ent. This is particularly true of both copper and zinc.
Copper toxicity is of increasing concern in vineyards
and orchards due to long-term use of copper-containing
fungicides as well as urban and industrial pollution. Zinc
toxicity can be a problem in acid soils or when sewage
sludge is used to fertilize crops.
In spite of the apparent toxicity of micronutrients,
many plant species have developed the capacity to tol-
erate extraordinarily high concentrations. For example,
most plants are severely injured by nickel concentrations
in excess of 5 μg g−1 dry weight, but species of the genus
Alyssum can tolerate levels in excess of 10 000 μg g−1 dry
weight.
SUMMARY
Plants are autotrophic organisms, taking their entire
nutritional needs from the inorganic environment.
Plants require carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, plus
14 other naturally occurring elements that are taken
from the soil. These 17 elements are considered
essential because it has been demonstrated that in their

76
Chapter 4 / Plants and Inorganic Nutrients
absence all plants are unable to complete a normal
life cycle. Essential elements may be considered
either macronutrients or micronutrients, depending
on the quantity normally required. Micronutrients
are normally required in concentrations less than
10 mmole/kg of dry weight.
Each essential element has a role to play in the bio-
chemistry and physiology of the plant and its absence
is characterized by one or more deﬁciency symptoms,
commonly related to that role. Additional elements
may be considered beneﬁcial because they satisfy spe-
cial requirements for particular plants. Essential ele-
ments, especially micronutrients, may be toxic when
present in excess amounts.
CHAPTER REVIEW

heterotrophic nutrition.

Bioenergetics and ATP Synthesis
A unique characteristic of planet earth is the presence
of life. On a grand scale, one can consider the entire
earth’s biosphere to be an enormous, exquisite, but com-
plex energy-transforming system consisting of myriad
countless organisms. In addition to water (Chapters
1–4), energy is an absolute requirement for the main-
tenance and replication of life regardless of its form.
Each organism plays a speciﬁc role in this teeming web
of carbon-based life forms. Regardless of whether we
examine the scale of biology at the community, indi-
vidual, cellular, or molecular level, organization is the
very essence of life and yet it is constantly under attack.
At the cellular level, proteins, nucleic acids, and other
molecules that make up the cell are continually subject
to breakdown by hydrolysis. Membranes leak solutes to
the environment. Everything on earth, cells and envi-
ronment alike, is subject to persistent oxidation. Still, all
around us we see biological organisms extracting mate-
rials from their environment and using them to maintain
their organization or to build new, complex structures.
Energy to build and preserve order in the face of a
constantly deteriorating environment is a fundamental
need of all organisms. Two strategies have evolved to
satisfy this need. One is photosynthesis—the pho-
toautotropic lifestyle—which traps energy from the
sun to build complex structures out of simple inor-
ganic substances. By contrast, organisms that live by
the alternative lifestyle, chemoheterotropic, require a
constant intake of organic substances from their envi-
ronment, from which they can extract their necessary
energy through respiration. But even many of these
substances trace their origins back to photosynthesis. In
the end, most life on earth is powered by energy from
the sun through photosynthesis. This chapter is con-
cerned with the basic principles of bioenergetics—the
study of energy transformations in living organisms.
The principal topics to be covered are
•
thermodynamic laws and the concepts of free energy
and entropy,
•
free energy and its relationship with chemical equi-
libria, illustrating how displacement of a reaction
from equilibrium can be used to drive vital reactions,
•
oxidation–reduction reactions, showing how they
also are involved in biological energy transforma-
tions, and
•
the chemiosmotic model for synthesis of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), a key mediator of biological
energy metabolism.

5.1 BIOENERGETICS AND
ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS
IN LIVING ORGANISMS
5.1.1 THE SUN IS A PRIMARY SOURCE
OF ENERGY
Given the complex composition and organization of
our biosphere, it may seem surprising that the basic
ingredients required to sustain most life on earth are
rather simple: water, visible light, and air. Light may
be considered the ultimate form of energy required
to maintain most carbon-based life forms. The source
of this light of course is the sun. How is this light
generated? The thermonuclear fusion reactions in the
heart of this star convert four protons (4H+) to one
helium (He) atom, which has an atomic weight of 4.0026.
However, since each H+ has an atomic weight of 1.0079,
the expected atomic weight of He should be 4.0316.
Clearly, we are missing 0.0290 gm-atoms of mass, which
represents a mere 0.72 percent of the total mass of
4H+! Einstein showed us that there is a very important
relationship between energy and mass:
E = mc2
(5.1)
where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.
Thus, the missing mass (m) of 0.0290 gm-atoms during
the conversion of 4H+ to He is converted into energy
(E) in the form of electromagnetic radiation. A small
portion of this electromagnetic energy is in the form
of visible light (Chapter 6), which reaches the earth’s
surface after a trip of about 160 million km. Since the
speed of light is 300,000 km s−1, each photon of visible
light generated by the sun requires 8.88s to reach the
earth’s surface. This means that any image of the sun
that we detect on earth can never be an original image,
but rather, an image of the sun that is 8.88s old!
Air provides the basic elements for all living organ-
isms: C, N, and O. C in the air is in the form of CO2
(about 0.035%) and the N in air is in the form of N2
(about 80%). However, most living organisms cannot
directly utilize either CO2 or N2 as a source of C and
N, respectively. Water provides the solvent necessary
for enzyme catalysis and formation of biological mem-
branes (Chapters 1 and 2). In Chapters 7 to 11 we will
address the role played by plants in utilizing light energy
to transform C and N into forms required not only to
sustain plant life but all forms of life. However, it is
essential that we establish some understanding of the
basic principles that govern energy transformations in
biological systems, that is, bioenergetics.
5.1.2 WHAT IS BIOENERGETICS?
In 1944,
the
Nobel
Laureate in physics,
Erwin
Schr¨odinger, published an intriguing little monograph
entitled What Is Life? In this book, this famous physicist
attempts to unravel the basis of life on physical and
chemical principles. Schr¨odinger simply asked whether
the laws of physics and chemistry can account for the
complex events that take place within ‘‘the spatial
boundary of a living organism’’ through space and time.
Schr¨odinger used a thermodynamic approach to address
this question. The term thermodynamics and much
of its language and mathematics reﬂect an historical
interest to discover the fundamental laws that govern
heat ﬂow. Although the study of thermodynamics is
now concerned with energy ﬂow in a more general
sense, the science of thermodynamics arose from
nineteenth-century interests in the workings of steam
engines or why heat was evolved when boring cannon
barrels. Energy ﬂow is governed by certain fundamental
thermodynamic rules. A general understanding of
thermodynamic principles is necessary because these
principles provide the quantitative framework for
understanding energy transformations in biology. In
addition to energy transformations, thermodynamics
also helps to describe the capacity of a system to do
work. Work may be deﬁned in several different ways.
The physicist deﬁnes work as displacement against
a force: the sliding of an object against friction or
rolling a boulder uphill, for example. The chemist, on
the other hand, views work in terms of pressure and
volume. For example, work must be done to overcome
the force of atmospheric pressure when the volume of a
gas increases. In biology the concept of work is applied
more broadly, embracing a variety of work functions
against a wide spectrum of forces encountered in cells
and organisms. In addition to mechanical work such as
muscular activity, the biologist is concerned with such
diverse activities as chemical syntheses, the movement
of solute against electrochemical gradients, osmosis,
and ecosystem dynamics. These and a host of other
essential activities of living things can all be described
in thermodynamic terms.
Bioenergetics is the application of thermodynamic
laws to the study of energy transformations in biologi-
cal systems. The energetics of cellular processes can be
related to chemical equilibrium and oxidation–reduction
potentials of chemical reactions. Whether at the level
of molecules, cells, or ecosystems, the ﬂow of energy
is central to the maintenance of life. A basic under-
standing of energy ﬂow is therefore essential to grasping
the true beauty, signiﬁcance, and complexity of biology.
The ﬁeld of study concerned with the ﬂow of energy
through living organisms is called bioenergetics. It is
important to note that although the laws of bioenerget-
ics provide critical insight into the driving forces that
govern cellular processes, bioenergetics does not provide
any insights into the biochemical reaction mechanisms
underlying these processes. For the past several decades,
a central focus of bioenergetics has been to unravel the

5.1 Bioenergetics and Energy Transformations in Living Organisms
79
complexities of energy transformations in photosynthe-
sis and respiration and understand how that energy is
used to drive energy-requiring reactions such as ATP
synthesis and accumulation of ions across membranes.
The purpose of this section is to facilitate an under-
standing of the laws that govern biological energy trans-
formations by assembling, in the simplest form possible,
some basic thermodynamic principles. Thus, a com-
plete understanding of cellular physiology requires an
integration of bioenergetics with biochemical reaction
mechanisms which is a pervading theme of this textbook.
The interested student will ﬁnd a more comprehen-
sive treatment of thermodynamics and bioenergetics in
the excellent monograph by D. G. Nicholls and S. J.
Stuart (2002). This publication provided the basis for
the discussion that follows.
5.1.3 THE FIRST LAW OF
THERMODYNAMICS REFERS
TO ENERGY CONSERVATION
Biological energy transformations are based on two
thermodynamic laws. The ﬁrst law, commonly known
as the law of conservation of energy, states that the
energy of the universe is constant. This is not a difﬁcult
concept to comprehend—it means simply that there is
a ﬁxed amount of energy and, while it may be moved
about or changed in form, it can all be accounted for
somewhere. More to the point, energy is never ‘‘lost’’ in
a reaction—an apparent decrease in one form of energy
will be balanced by an increase in some other form of
energy. In one of the examples mentioned earlier, some
of the energy expended in displacing an object appears
as work while some appears as heat generated due to
friction. In the same way, some of the chemical energy
released in the combustion of glucose will also be found
as heat in the environment, while some will be found as
bond energy in the product molecules, CO2 and water.
5.1.4 THE SECOND LAW OF
THERMODYNAMICS REFERS
TO ENTROPY AND DISORDER
As biologists we are concerned above all with how
much work can be done. But, as suggested earlier, not
all energy is available to do work. This brings us to
the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of
entropy. Because it involves the concept of entropy (S),
the second law is a bit more difﬁcult to comprehend.
What is entropy? Entropy has been variously described
as a measure of randomness, disorder, or chaos.
However, since entropy is a thermodynamic con-
cept, it is useful to describe it in terms of thermal
energy. Temperature is deﬁned as the mean molecular
kinetic energy of matter. Thus, any molecular system
not at absolute zero (−273◦C, or 0◦K) contains a certain
amount of thermal energy—energy in the form of the
vibration and rotation of its constituent molecules as
well as their translation through space. This quantity
of thermal energy and temperature go hand-in-hand:
as the quantity of energy increases or decreases, so
does temperature. Because temperature cannot be held
constant when this energy is given up, it is said to be
‘‘isothermally unavailable’’ (Gr. isos, equal). Quantita-
tively, isothermally unavailable energy is given by the
term TS, where T is the absolute temperature and S is
entropy.
Since isothermally unavailable energy, and conse-
quently, entropy, are related to the energy of molecular
motion, it follows that the more molecules are free to
move about, that is, the more random or less ordered or
chaotic the system, the greater will be their entropy. By
this same argument it also follows that at absolute zero,
a state in which all molecular motion ceases, entropy is
also zero. Consider a familiar example: the combustion
of glucose. The highly ordered structure of a glucose
molecule imposes certain constraints on the movement
of the constituent carbon atoms. In the form of six indi-
vidual carbon dioxide molecules, however, those same
atoms are far less constrained. They are individually
free to rotate and tumble through space. With respect
to carbon, the glucose molecules and carbon dioxide
molecules each have entropy, but the product carbon
dioxide molecules are less ordered, their freedom of
movement is greater, and so is their entropy. It is impor-
tant to note, however, that for any given reaction, the
entropy of all reactants and all products must be taken
into consideration. For a system not at rest, the natural
tendency is for entropy to increase, that is, for systems
to become increasingly chaotic. Equation 5.2 shows the
relationship between entropy, S, and disorder, D, where
k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.3800662 × 10−23 J · ◦K−1).
Thus, as disorder increases so does entropy.
S = k log D
(5.2)
This tendency was summarized by R. J. Clausius: the
entropy of the universe tends toward a maximum. Clausius’s
dictum is one way of stating the second law of thermody-
namics. The primary characteristic of all life is complex
order which appears to contradict the second law of
thermodynamics. However, this is not the case since all
living organisms exhibit a ﬁnite lifetime which can vary
from hours to days to years to centuries depending on
the species. Since order (1/D) is the inverse of disorder
(D), Equation 5.2 becomes
−S = k log(1/D)
(5.3)
Thus, life is negative entropy (−S) !
As physiologists, however, our concern with entropy
is primarily that it represents energy that is not available
to do work. In this context, the second law can then
be restated as: the capacity of an isolated system to do work

80
Chapter 5 / Bioenergetics and ATP Synthesis
continually decreases. In other words, it is never possible
to utilize all of the energy of a system to do work.
5.1.5 THE ABILITY TO DO WORK
IS DEPENDENT ON THE
AVAILABILITY OF FREE ENERGY
From the above discussion, it is apparent that some
energy will be available under isothermal conditions and
is, consequently, available to do work. This energy is
called Gibbs free energy in honor of J. W. Gibbs, the
nineteenth-century physical chemist who introduced
the concept. Free energy (G) is related to TS in the
following way:
H = G + TS
(5.4)
H is the total heat energy (also called enthalpy), includ-
ing any work that might be done. H is comprised of
isothermally unavailable TS plus G. Equation 5.4 thus
identiﬁes two kinds of energy: free energy, which is
available to do work, and entropy, which is not. Except
in a limited number of situations, it is free energy, the
energy available to do work, that is of greatest interest
to the biologist. Equation 5.4 also suggests a corollary of
the second law: the free energy of the universe tends toward
a minimum.
It is neither convenient nor relevant to measure
absolute energies (either G or S), but changes (designated
by the symbol ) in energy during the course of a
reaction can usually be measured with little difﬁculty as,
for example, heat gain or loss, or work. Equation 5.4 can
be restated as follows:
G = H −TS
(5.5)
Changes in free energy can tell us much about a reaction.
It can tell us, for example, the feasibility of a reaction
actually taking place and the quantity of work that might
be done if it does take place. Feasibility is indicated
by the sign of G. If the sign of G is negative (i.e.,
G < 0), the reaction is considered spontaneous, meaning
that it will proceed without an input of energy. Since
the free energy of the products is less than the reactants,
reactions with a negative G are sometimes known as
exergonic, or energy yielding. If, on the other hand,
G is positive, an input of energy is required for the
reaction to occur. The oxidation of glucose is an example
of a reaction with a negative G. Once an activation
barrier (see Chapter 8 for details) is overcome, glucose
will spontaneously oxidize to form CO2 and water.
Despite the existence of large quantities of CO2 and
water in the atmosphere, however, they are not known
to spontaneously recombine to form glucose! This is
because the equilibrium constant favors the formation
of CO2 and H2O and the G for glucose formation
is positive. Reactions with a positive G (i.e., G >
0) are known as endergonic, or energy consuming.
Equation 5.5 also tells us that any change in free energy
is associated with a change in entropy. This means that
there is always a price to pay in any reaction involved
in an energy transformation. The price paid is in the
inevitable increase in entropy. Therefore, no energy
transformation process can be 100 percent efﬁcient with
respect to the retention of free energy.
The magnitude of free energy changes is very much
a function of the particular set of conditions for that
reaction. For that reason it is convenient to compare
the free energy changes of reactions under standard
reaction conditions. In biochemistry the standard free
energy change, G◦′, deﬁnes the free energy change
of a reaction that occurs at physiological pH (pH = 7.0)
under conditions where both reactants and products are
at unit concentration (1 M).
5.1.6 FREE ENERGY IS RELATED
TO CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA
Under appropriate conditions, all chemical reactions
will achieve a state of equilibrium, at which there will be
no further net change in the concentrations of reactants
and products. There is a fairly straightforward rela-
tionship between free energy and chemical equilibria.
This relationship, which is central to an understand-
ing of bioenergetics, is illustrated diagrammatically in
Figure 5.1. In a reaction where the reactant A is con-
verted to product B, K is the equilibrium mass-action
ratio—the ratio of concentration of products to the
concentration of reactants when the reaction has come
to equilibrium. Thus
Keq = [B]eq/[A]eq
(5.6)
In Figure 5.1 the slope of the line represents the change
in free energy (G) when a small amount of the reactant
A is converted to the product B. Several useful points
can be drawn from this diagram.
1.
At equilibrium, the slope of the line is zero. Con-
sequently, when reactions are at equilibrium, G = 0
and no useful work can be accomplished.
2.
The further the mass-action ratio is displaced
from equilibrium (Keq), the greater the free energy
change for conversion of the same small amount of
A to B. The free energy change for a reaction is
a function of its displacement from equilibrium.
Therefore, the further a reaction is poised away from
equilibrium, the more free energy is available as the
reaction proceeds toward equilibrium.
3.
As A approaches equilibrium, G is negative and
free energy is available to do work. However, as the
reaction proceeds past equilibrium toward B, G
is becomes positive and energy must be supplied.
A system can do work as it moves toward equilibrium.
Note that if the reaction were initiated with pure B,
the direction of the arrows would be reversed and
work could be done as B approached equilibrium.

FIGURE 5.1 The free energy of a reaction is a function of its displacement from
equilibrium. K is the mass-action ratio when the reaction is at equilibrium. Verti-
cal arrows indicate the slope of the free energy curve, or change in free energy, as
reactant is converted to product. Note that the free energy change at equilibrium is
zero and that the magnitude of the free energy change, indicated by the length of
the arrow, increases as the reaction moves away from equilibrium toward pure reac-
tant or pure product. A downward arrow indicates a negative free energy change; an
upward arrow indicates a positive free energy change. (Redrawn from D. G. Nicholls
and S. J. Ferguson, Bioenergetics, New York: Academic Press, 2002. Reprinted by
permission.)
The relationship between the free energy change (G)
and the equilibrium constant (Keq) can be expressed
quantitatively as:
G = G◦′ + RT ln Keq
(5.7)
However, at equilibrium, G = 0 and Equation 5.7 can
be rearranged to give
G◦′ = −RT ln Keq = −2.3RT log Keq
(5.8)
Furthermore, the actual free energy change (G) of a
reaction not at equilibrium is given by:
G = G◦′ + 2.3RT log 
(5.9)
where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute
temperature, and  equals the observed (i.e., nonequi-
librium) mass-action ratio. Equation 5.8 can then be
substituted in Equation 5.9 and rearranged to give:
G = −2.3RT log(Keq/ )
(5.10)
Equation 5.10 reinforces the observation that the value
of G is a function of the degree to which a reaction is
displaced from equilibrium. When  = Keq, the reaction
is at equilibrium and G = 0 and no useful work can be
done. When  is less than Keq, G < 0 and the reaction
will occur spontaneously with the release of energy
which can be used to perform useful work. However,
when  is greater than Keq, G > 0 and the reaction
will not occur spontaneously, but rather, requires an
input of energy to proceed.
5.2 ENERGY TRANSFORMATIONS
AND COUPLED REACTIONS
5.2.1 FREE ENERGY OF ATP IS
ASSOCIATED WITH COUPLED
PHOSPHATE TRANSFER
REACTIONS
Biological organisms overcome metabolic restrictions
imposed by thermodynamically unfavorable reactions
that exhibit a positive G by coupling them or linking
them to reactions with a negative G. Thus, the free
energy released by the exergonic reaction provides the
necessary energy to ensure that the endergonic reaction
proceeds. However, in order that this system of coupled
reactions will occur spontaneously, the net free energy
change must always be negative. Thus, the concept of such
coupled reactions was critical to our understanding of
how life, an overall endergonic process, is maintained
without defying the laws of thermodynamics. The
notion of biological coupled reactions was unknown
to Schr¨odinger in 1944 to explain the complex events

82
Chapter 5 / Bioenergetics and ATP Synthesis
that take place within ‘‘the spatial boundary of a living
organism’’ through space and time. For example, in gly-
colysis, the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
(Equation 5.11), which is an exergonic reaction, is cou-
pled to the phosphorylation of glucose (Equation 5.12),
which is an endergonic reaction. The overall net
reaction proceeds because the net reaction is exergonic

When ATP was ﬁrst isolated from extracts of muscle
in 1929, F. Lipmann was one of the ﬁrst to recognize
its signiﬁcant role in the energy metabolism of the cell
(Figure 5.2). He called it a high-energy molecule
and designated the terminal phosphate bonds by a
squiggle symbol (∼). Actually, the designation of ATP
as a high-energy molecule is somewhat misleading
because it implies that ATP is in some way a unique
molecule. It is not. The two terminal phosphate bonds
of the ATP molecule are normal, covalent anhydride
bonds. Hydrolysis of an anhydride is accompanied by a
favorable increase in entropy, largely due to resonance
stabilization of the product molecules: the electrons
have one additional bond through which they can
resonate. In addition, both the ADP and Pi products are
acidic anions and the two negatively charged products,
because of mutual charge repulsion, do not readily
recombine. Consequently, the equilibrium constant
(Keq) for ATP hydrolysis is rather large—on the order
of 105. Thus, for ATP hydrolysis
Keq = [ADP][Pi]/[ATP] ≈105
(5.14)
Such a large equilibrium constant helps to explain
why ATP is so important in cellular metabolism.
Photosynthesis and respiration serve to maintain a
large pool of ATP such that the observed mass-action
ratio () can be maintained as low as 10−4. This
is nine orders of magnitude away from equilibrium
(Equation 5.14). By substituting these values for
Keq and A in Equation 5.10, we can see that a
cell
generates
considerable
free
energy
(G
≈
−56 kJ/mol) simply through its capacity to maintain
high concentrations of ATP. Thus, it is the cell’s
capacity to maintain the mass-action ratio so far from
equilibrium that enables ATP to function as an energy
store.
It is important to emphasize that it is the extent
of displacement of G from equilibrium that deﬁnes
the capacity of a reactant to do work, rather than any
intrinsic property of the molecule itself. In the words of
D. G. Nicholls, if the glucose-6-phosphate reac-
tion (G◦′
= 13.8 kJ/mol) ‘‘were maintained ten
orders of magnitude away from equilibrium, then
glucose-6-phosphate would be just as capable of doing
work in the cell as is ATP. Conversely, the Paciﬁc

Ocean could be ﬁlled with an equilibrium mixture of
ATP, ADP and Pi but the ATP would have no capacity
to do work’’ (Nicholls and Ferguson, 2002). Of course,
it goes without saying that the biochemistry of the cell is
structured so as to use ATP, not glucose-6-phosphate,
in this capacity.
The relationship between free energy and the capac-
ity to do work is not restricted to chemical reactions.
Any system not at equilibrium has a capacity to do work,
such as an unequal distribution of solute molecules
across a membrane (see Chapter 3). The maintenance
of such a steady-state but nonequilibrium condition is
called homeostasis. Indeed, homeostasis that reﬂects
the capacity to avoid equilibrium in spite of changing
environmental conditions is an essential characteristic
of all living organisms. When G = 0, no useful work
can be done and life ceases to exist.
5.2.2 FREE ENERGY CHANGES ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH COUPLED
OXIDATION–REDUCTION
REACTIONS
Photosynthesis and respiration, which we will discuss
in more detail in Chapters 7 and 10, are electro-
chemical phenomena. Each operates as a sequence of
oxidation–reduction reactions in which electrons are
transferred from one component to another. Thus, the
oxidation of one component is linked or coupled to the
reduction of the next component. Such coupled electron
transfer reactions are known as reduction–oxidation or
redox reactions. This can be illustrated in the following
general way. Any compound, A, in its reduced form
(Ared), becomes oxidized (Aox) when it gives up an elec-
tron (e−) (Equation 5.15). Similarly, any compound, B,
in its oxidized form (Box), becomes reduced (Bred) when
it accepts an electron (Equation 5.16). When these
two reactions are coupled, the net effect is the trans-
fer of an electron from compound A to compound B
(Equation 5.17) with Ared being the reductant and Box
being the oxidant.
Ared →Aox + e−
(5.15)
Box + e−→Bred
(5.16)
Ared + Box →Aox + Bred
(5.17)
As a speciﬁc biological example, consider the net
reduction of three-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) to
glyceraldehyde-3-P
(GAP)
by
the
reduced
form
of
nicotinamide
adenine
dinucleotide
phosphate
(NADPH):
PGA + NADPH + H+ ⇌GAP + NADP+
(5.18)
Redox reactions may be conveniently dissected into two
half-reactions involving the donation and acceptance of
electrons. Thus the reduction of PGA to GAP may be
considered as the two half-reactions:
NADPH ⇌NADP+ + H+ + 2e−
(5.19)
PGA + 2e−+ H+ ⇌GAP
(5.20)
Thus, the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ is coupled to
the reduction of PGA to GAP. A reduced/oxidized pair
such as NADPH/NADP+ is known as a redox couple.
Note that oxidation–reduction reactions often involve
the transfer of protons. The positively charged protons
balance the negative charge of the acquired electrons,
which maintains electroneutrality. The involvement of
protons indicates that the redox reaction is pH sensi-
tive! The structures of some principal redox compounds
involved in biological electron transport are shown in
Figure 5.3.
Since each of the half-reactions described above, as
well as the net reaction, is reversible, their free energies
could be described on the basis of chemical equilibria.
However, it is not clear how to treat the electrons,
which have no independent existence. Moreover, our
interest in redox couples is more in their tendency to
accept electrons from or donate electrons to another
couple, a tendency known as redox potential. Redox
potentials allow the feasibility and direction of electron
transfers between components in a complex system to
be predicted. Indeed, in order to understand electron
ﬂow in photosynthesis and respiration it is necessary to
have a working understanding of redox potential and
how it is applied.
The direction of electron transfer between redox
couples can be predicted by comparing their midpoint
potentials (Em). Thermodynamically spontaneous elec-
tron transfer will proceed from couples with the more
negative (less positive) redox potential to those with
the less negative (more positive) redox potential. The
energy-transducing membranes of bacteria, mitochon-
dria, and chloroplasts all contain electron-transport
systems involving a number of electron carriers with
different midpoint redox potentials (Table 5.1).

namide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Note that only the
nicotinamide ring is changed by the reaction. The nicotinamide ring accepts two electrons but only one proton. Arrow
indicates where the electrons are added to the nicotinamide ring. (B) Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) consists of
adenosine (adenine plus ribose) and riboﬂavin (ribitol plus isoalloxazine). Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) consists of
riboﬂavin alone. Reduction occurs on the isoalloxazine moiety, which accepts two electrons and two protons. (C)
Quinones. A quinone ring is attached to a hydrocarbon chain composed of ﬁve-carbon isoprene units. The value of n
is usually 9 for plastoquinone, found in chloroplast thylakoid membranes, and 10 for ubiquinone, found in the inner
membrane of mitochondria. Reduction of the quinone ring is a two-step reaction. The transfer of one electron produces
the partially reduced, negatively charged semiquinone (not shown). Addition of a second electron plus two protons yields
the fully reduced hydroquinone form.

5.3 Energy Transduction and the Chemiosmotic Synthesis of ATP
85
In addition to allowing us to predict the direction of
electron transfer, redox potentials also permit the calcu-
lation of Gibbs free energy changes for electron-transfer
reactions. This can be done using the following rela-
tionship:
G◦′ = −nFEm
(5.21)
where n is the number of electrons transferred and
F is the Faraday constant (96 500 coulombs mol−1).
Biological electron transfers may involve either single
electrons or pairs, but energy calculations are almost
always based on n = 2. Em is the redox interval through
which the electrons are transferred and is determined as
Em = Em(acceptor) −Em(donor)
(5.22)
Thus, for a coupled transfer of electrons from water
(the donor) to NADP+ (the acceptor) as occurs in pho-
tosynthetic electron transport in chloroplasts, Em =
(−320) −(+820) = −1140 mV = −1.14 V. Substitut-
ing this in Equation 5.21, the value of G◦′ for a
two-electron transfer from H2O to NADP+ is +220 kJ
mol−1. Note that the sign of G◦′ is positive, indicating
that this electron transfer will not occur spontaneously.
In photosynthesis, light energy is used to drive this
coupled endergonic reaction. In contrast, mitochondria
transfer electrons from NADH to O2. For this coupled
electron-transfer reaction, the value of  Em is +1.14 V
and consequently G◦′ is −220 kJ mol−1, indicating that
this electron transfer in mitochondria is exergonic and
thus will occur spontaneously. It is important to note
that the molecular mechanisms by which these elec-
trons are transferred through complex processes such
as photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen assimilation
are not in the purview of bioenergetics. The details of
the underlying mechanisms will be addressed later in
Chapters 7, 8, 10, and 11, respectively.
5.3 ENERGY TRANSDUCTION
AND THE CHEMIOSMOTIC
SYNTHESIS OF ATP
It has been known for many years that the three
principal energy-transducing membrane systems (in
bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria) were able to
link electron transport with the synthesis of ATP. The
mechanism, however, was not understood until Peter
Mitchell proposed his chemiosmotic hypothesis in
1961. Although not readily accepted by many bio-
chemists in the beginning, Mitchell’s hypothesis is now
ﬁrmly supported by experimental results. In honor of
his pioneering work, Mitchell was awarded the Nobel
prize for chemistry in 1978.
Mitchell’s hypothesis is based on two fundamental
requirements. First, energy-transducing membranes are
impermeable to H+. Second, electron carriers are orga-
nized asymmetrically in the membrane. The result is
that, in addition to transporting electrons, some carriers
also serve to translocate protons across the membrane
against a proton gradient. The effect of these proton
pumps is to conserve some of the free energy of electron
transport as an unequal or nonequilibrium distribution
of protons, or pH, across the membrane.
5.3.1 CHLOROPLASTS AND
MITOCHONDRIA EXHIBIT
SPECIFIC COMPARTMENTS
In plants, chloroplasts and mitochondria are the main
energy-transducing organelles. The biochemical mech-
anism by which ATP is synthesized is directly related
to the speciﬁc compartments that exist in each of these
organelles. The structure (Figure 5.4) and development
or biogenesis of chloroplasts have been studied exten-
sively (Box 5.1). The number of chloroplasts per cell
varies from species to species. For example, the unicel-
lular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, exhibits a
single chloroplast while a single mesophyll cell in the
leaves of many terrestrial plants can exhibit in excess of
200 chloroplasts.
Within a mature chloroplast, we recognize four
major structural regions or compartments: (1) a pair
of outer limiting membranes, collectively known as the
envelope, (2) an unstructured background matrix or
stroma, (3) a highly structured internal system of mem-
branes, called thylakoids, and (4) the intrathylakoid
space, or lumen (Figure 5.7A). The envelope deﬁnes the
outer limits of the organelle. These membranes are 5.0
to 7.5 nm thick and are separated by a 10 nm intermem-
brane space. Because the inner envelope membrane

PLASTID
BIOGENESIS
Plastids are a family of double membrane-bound, semi-
autonomous organelles common to plant cells. Plastids
arise from small, vesicular organelles called proplastids
(0.2 to 1.0 μm) (Figure 5.5), which are carried from one
generation to the next through the embryo and main-
tained in the undifferentiated state in the dividing cells
of plant meristems. Plastids are prokaryotic in origin
and arose by endosymbiosis. This theory states that
sometime during plant evolution, an ancestral eukary-
ote host cell engulfed a photosynthetic bacterium which
established a stable association within the host. As a
consequence, plastids contain their own DNA in the
form of double-stranded circular molecules very sim-
ilar to prokaryotic DNA, and replicate by division of
existing plastids. Thus, plastids are considered to be
semiautonomous and are inherited maternally in most

FIGURE 5.5 Plastids. A diagram illustrating some of the
interrelationships between various types of plastids.
Colorless plastids, that is, plastids without pigments or
any prominent internal structure, are called leucoplasts.
Leucoplasts in nonphotosynthetic tissues are often the
sites of starch accumulation, in which case they are
called amyloplasts. In photosynthetic tissues, chloro-
plasts may become amyloplasts by accumulating excess
photosynthetic product in the form of starch granules.
When the starch is ultimately degraded, the plastid may
once again resume its photosynthetic function. Chloro-
plasts in maturing fruits and senescing leaves are com-
monly converted to chromoplasts due to the simultane-
ous loss of chlorophyll and accumulation of yellow or
reddish-orange carotenoid pigments. The characteris-
tic colors of tomato fruit and many autumn leaves are
due to such chromoplasts. Chromoplasts may also form
in nonphotosynthetic tissues such as carrot roots. The
pigments in chromoplasts are often so concentrated that
they form a crystalline deposit.
ﬂowering plants but are paternally inherited in gym-
nosperms. Several categories of plastids are found in
plants and are named according to their color. The
most prominent plastids in the leaves of plants are the
green photosynthetic chloroplasts, which synthesize
chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are colorless plastids that syn-
thesize volatile compounds called monoterpenes present
in essential oils. Amyloplasts are unpigmented plastids
specialized for the biosynthesis and storage of starch and
are prominent organelles in plant storage organs. Chro-
moplasts are pigmented plastids that are responsible for
the colors for many fruit (tomatoes, apples, organges)
and ﬂowers (tulips, daffodils, marigolds). Their color is a
consequence of the particular combination of carotenes
and xanthophylls which they accumulate.
During expansion in the dark, leaves are either
white or pale yellow. Such leaves are called etiolated
leaves.
In
the
development
of
etiolated
leaves,
proplastids are converted to etioplasts (Figure 5.6).
The
etioplast
is
not
considered
an
intermediate
stage in the normal development of a chloroplast
but rather a specialized plastid present in etiolated
leaves. Etioplasts lack chlorophyll but accumulate the
colorless chlorophyll precursor, protochlorophyllide.
A prominent structural feature of etioplasts is a
highly ordered, paracrystalline structure called the
prolamellar body (PLB). When exposed to light,
the protochlorophyll is converted to chlorophyll and the
prolamellar body undergoes a reorganization to form
the internal thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.
The assembly of thylakoid membranes during
normal chloroplast biogenesis is extremely complex.
In
angiosperms,
chloroplast
biogenesis
is
strictly
light-dependent but not in gymnosperms and some
green algae.
However,
regardless
of
the
species,
chloroplast biogensis requires coordination between
gene expression in the nucleus as well as in the
plastids. In addition, plastid protein synthesis has to be
coordinated with cytosolic synthesis of nuclear encoded
photosynthetic proteins and their subsequent import
from the cytosol to the chloroplast. For example, the
genes that encode light harvesting polypeptides of
photosystem I and photosystem II (Chapter 7) are
encoded by the nucleus and synthesized in the cytosol
while proteins that form the reaction centers of these
same photosystems are encoded by chloroplast DNA
and synthesized in the stroma. Elucidation of the mech-
anisms and regulation of protein import into cellular
organelles continues to be a major area of research. The
formation of thylakoid membranes during the greening
process occurs via the sequential appearance of PS I,
followed by PS II, intersystem electron transport com-
ponents, and lastly the assembly of the light harvesting
complexes associated with PS I and PS II. Maximum
rates of CO2 assimilation and O2 evolution occur once
the biogenesis of the thylakoid membranes is complete.

FIGURE 5.6 Chloroplast development in

from proplastids, which exist as a simple,
double membrane vesicle with invagina-
tions of the inner membrane (IM). Upon
exposure to light, chlorophyll biosynthesis
is initiated with the concomitant differen-
tiation of the thylakoid membranes into
granal lamellae (GL; stacks) separated
by stromal lamellae (SL; unstacked). If
seedlings are initially grown in the dark,
the proplastid develops into an etioplast.
The etioplast is characterized by the pres-
ence of a prolamellar body (PLB) and pro-
thylakoids (PT) extending out from the
prolamellar bodies. Upon transfer of the
dark grown etiolated seedlings to the light,
the prolamellar body in the etioplast dis-
perses and thylakoid membranes develop,
producing a normal chloroplast.
In addition to the conversion of proplastids to
chloroplasts, light also induces the conversion of etio-
plasts into chloroplasts in etiolated plants. This process
usually takes approximately 12 to 24 hours (Figure 5.5).
Upon exposure to light, carotenoid biosynthesis is stim-
ulated and chlorophyll biosynthesis is initiated by the
conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide a by
the enzyme NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidore-
ductase (POR), the major protein present in the PLB
(Figure 5.6). Thus, exposure of etiolated plants to light
causes their leaves to turn green in a process referred
to as de-etiolation or greening. The photoreduction
of protochlorophyllide is associated with the disorgani-
zation of the PLB, which leads to the production and
assembly of normal, functional thylakoid membranes.

isolate the chloroplast and regulate the exchange of
metabolites between the chloroplast and the cytosol
that surrounds it. Experiments with spinach chloroplasts
have shown that the intermembrane space is freely acces-
sible to metabolites in the cytoplasm. Thus it appears
that the outer envelope membrane offers little by way
of a permeability barrier. It is left to the inner enve-
lope membrane to regulate the ﬂow of molecular trafﬁc
between the chloroplast and cytoplasm.

enzymes responsible for photosynthetic carbon reduc-
tion, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy-
lase/oxygenase, generally referred to by the acronym
rubisco (Chapter 8). Rubisco, which accounts for fully
half of the total chloroplast protein, is no doubt the
world’s single most abundant protein. In addition to
rubisco and other enzymes involved in carbon reduc-
tion, the stroma contains enzymes for a variety of other
metabolic pathways as well as DNA, RNA, and the
necessary machinery for transcription and translation.
Embedded within the stroma is a complex system of
membranes often referred to as lamellae (Figure 5.7A).
This system is composed of individual pairs of par-
allel membranes that appear to be joined at the end,
a conﬁguration that in cross-section gives the mem-
branes the appearance of a ﬂattened sack, or thylakoid
(Gr., sacklike). In some regions adjacent thylakoids
appear to be closely appressed, giving rise to membrane
stacks known as grana. The thylakoids found within
a region of membrane stacking are called grana
thylakoids. Some thylakoids, quite often every second
one, extend beyond the grana stacks into the stroma
as single, nonappressed thylakoids. These stroma
thylakoids most often continue into another grana
stack, thus providing a network of interconnections
between grana. While the organization of thylakoids
into stacked and unstacked regions is typical, it is by no
means universal. One particularly striking example is the
chloroplast in cells that surround the vascular bundles in
C4 photosynthetic plants and that have no grana stacks
(Chapter 15). Here the thylakoids form long, unpaired
arrays extending almost the entire diameter of the

5.3 Energy Transduction and the Chemiosmotic Synthesis of ATP

chloroplast. The thylakoid membranes contain the
chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments and are the site
of the light-dependent, energy-conserving reactions of
photosynthesis.
The interior space of the thylakoid is known as the
lumen. The lumen is the site of water oxidation and,
consequently, the source of oxygen evolved in photo-
synthesis. Otherwise it functions primarily as a reservoir
for protons that are pumped across the thylakoid mem-
brane during electron transport and that are used to
drive ATP synthesis. It is generally assumed that the
thylakoids represent a single, continuous network of
membranes. This means, of course, that the lumen of
each thylakoid seen in cross-section also represents but
a small part of a single, continuous system.
Plant mitochondria are typically spherical or short
rods approximately 0.5 μm in diameter and up to 2 μm in
length. The number of mitochondria per cell is variable
but generally relates to the overall metabolic activity of
the cell. In one study of rapidly growing sycamore cells
in culture, 250 mitochondria per cell was reported. The
mitochondria accounted for about 0.7 percent of total
cell volume and contained 6 to 7 percent of the total cell
protein. In other metabolically more active cells, such as
secretory and transfer cells, the number is even higher
and may exceed a thousand per cell!
Mitochondria, like the other energy-transducing
organelle, the chloroplast, are organized into several
ultrastructural compartments with distinct metabolic
functions: an outer membrane, an inner mem-
brane, the intermembrane space, and the matrix
(Figure 5.7B). The composition and properties of
the two membranes are very different. The outer
membrane, which has few enzymatic functions, is rich
in lipids and contains relatively little protein. The inner
membrane, on the other hand, contains over 70 percent
protein on a dry-weight basis. The outer membrane is
also highly permeable to most metabolites. It contains
large channel-forming proteins, known as porins
(Chapter 1), which allow essentially free passage of
molecules and ions with a molecular mass of 10000 Da
or less. The permeability of the inner membrane, like
that of the chloroplast, is far more selective—it is
freely permeable only to a few small molecules such
as water, O2, and CO2. Like the chloroplast thylakoid
membrane, the permeability of the mitochondrial inner
membrane to protons is particularly low, a signiﬁcant
factor with respect to its role in ATP synthesis.
The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is
extensively infolded. These invaginations form a dense
network of internal membranes called cristae. The typi-
cal biology textbook picture of cristae is based on animal
mitochondria where the infoldings are essentially lamel-
lar and form platelike extensions into the matrix. The
common pattern in plant mitochondria is less regular,
forming a system of tubes and sacs (Figure 5.8). The
unstructured interior of the mitochondrion, or matrix, is
an aqueous phase consisting of 40 to 50 percent protein
by weight. Much of this protein is comprised of enzymes

5.3.2 CHLOROPLASTS AND
MITOCHONDRIA SYNTHESIZE
ATP BY CHEMIOSMOSIS
In chloroplasts the protons are pumped across the thy-
lakoid membrane, from the stroma into the lumen. The
difference in proton concentration (pH) across the
membrane may be quite large—as much as three or
four orders of magnitude. Since protons carry a positive
charge, a pH also contributes to an electrical potential
gradient across the membrane. A trans-thylakoid pH
of 3.5, for example, establishes a potential difference of
207 mV at 25◦C. Together the membrane potential dif-
ference () and the proton gradient (pH) constitute
a proton motive force (pmf).
pmf = −59pH + 
(5.23)
In order to pump protons into the lumen against a
proton motive force of this magnitude, a large amount
of energy is required. This energy is provided by the
negative G generated by photosynthetic intersystem
electron transport.
The direction of the proton motive force also favors
the return of protons to the stroma, but the low pro-
ton conductance of the thylakoid membrane will not
allow the protons to simply diffuse back. In fact, the
return of protons to the stroma is restricted to highly
speciﬁc, protein-lined channels that extend through the
membrane and that are a part of the ATP synthesiz-
ing enzyme, ATP synthase (Figure 5.9). This large
(400 kDa) multisubunit complex, also known as cou-
pling factor or CF0—CF1, consists of two multipeptide
complexes.
A hydrophobic complex called CF0 is largely
embedded in the thylakoid membrane. Attached to the
CF0 on the stroma side is a hydrophilic complex called
CF1. The CF1 complex contains the active site for
ATP synthesis, while the CF0 forms an H+ channel
across the membrane, channeling the energy of the
electrochemical proton gradient toward the active site
of the enzyme. When the electron-transport complexes
and the ATP-synthesizing complex are both operating,
a proton circuit is established in chloroplasts as well
as mitochondria (Figure 5.7C). In chloroplasts, the
photosynthetic electron-transport complex pumps the
protons from the stroma into the lumen and thus
establishes the proton gradient. At the same time, the
ATP synthase allows the protons to return to the
stroma. Some of the free energy of electron transport
is initially conserved in the proton gradient. As the
energy-rich proton gradient collapses through the

CF0 is an integral membrane protein that forms a pro-
ton channel through the thylakoid membrane. CF1 is
attached to the stromal side of CF0 and contains the
active site for ATP synthesis. CF1 consists of ﬁve differ-
ent subunits with a stoichiometry of α3, β3, γ , δ, ε. CF0
consists of four different subunits with a proposed stoi-
chiometry of a, b, b′, c10. The proton channel lies at the
interface between subunit a and the ring of c subunits.
The pmf rotates the ring of c subunits, which causes the
CF1 to rotate and convert ADP and Pi to ATP. Large
arrow indicates the direction of rotation.
CF0-CF1 complex, that conserved energy is available
to drive the synthesis of ATP. The light-dependent
synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis in the chloroplast is
called photophosphorylation. In mitochondria, the
respiratory electron-transport complex pumps protons
from the matrix to the intermembrane space (IMS) to
establish a proton gradient. The potential energy of
this proton gradient is consumed by the mitochondrial
ATP synthase to synthesize ATP (Figure 5.7C). The
chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP by mitochondria is
called oxidative phosphorylation.
An essential element of Mitchell’s chemiosmotic
hypothesis is the reversibility of the ATP synthase reac-
tion. This means that under appropriate conditions the
CF0-CF1 and other similar complexes can use the neg-
ative free energy of ATP hydrolysis to establish a proton
gradient. For example, both the plasma membrane and
tonoplast contain ATPase proton pumps, which pump
protons out of the cell or the vacuole, as the case may
be (Chapter 3). The energy of ATP is thus conserved
in the form of a proton gradient that may then be cou-
pled to various forms of cellular work. ATPase proton
pumps are a principal means of utilizing ATP to provide

energy for the transport of other ions and small solute
molecules across cellular membranes (Chapter 3).
Bioenergetics is a fundamental science. Its study
is challenging, but this discussion has, of necessity,
been restricted to general principles. With this brief
background in mind, however, we can now proceed
to a discussion of energy conservation through the
light-dependent and light-independent reactions of
photosynthesis and subsequently examine how plant

for growth, development, and the maintenance of
homeostasis through the processes of glycolysis and
respiration. In addition, we have seen that bioenergetic
principles were important in our previous discussion
of osmosis and water relations (Chapters 1 and 2) as
well as ion transport associated with nutrient uptake
(Chapter 3).
SUMMARY
The application of thermodynamic laws to the study of
energy ﬂow through living organisms is called bio-
energetics. There are two forms of energy, one that
is available to do work (free energy) and one that is not
(entropy). In a biochemical system such as living orga-
nisms, free energy is related to chemical equilibrium.
The further a reaction is held away from equilibrium,
the more work can be done. Cells utilize this principle
to link or couple energy-yielding reactions with
energy-consuming reactions. In fact, life exists be-
cause cells are able to avoid equilibrium, that is,
avoid maximum entropy. Most energy-exchange
reactions in the cell are mediated by phosphory-
lated intermediates, especially ATP and related
molecules. ATP is useful in this regard because
it has a large equilibrium constant and is highly
mobile within the cell. Because ATP is turned
over rapidly, it is maintained far from equilibrium.
By exploiting speciﬁc compartments in chloroplasts
(stroma vs. lumen) and mitochondria (matrix vs.
intermembrane space), the chemiosmotic synthesis of
ATP is linked or coupled to an energy-rich proton
gradient (a nonequilibrium proton distribution) across
the energy-transducing thylakoid of the chloroplast
or the inner membrane (cristae) of the mitochondria.
The free energy of electron transport is used to
establish the proton gradient and ATP is synthesized
as the protons return through transmembrane ATP
synthesizing complex.

The Dual Role of Sunlight:
Energy and Information
Sunlight satisﬁes two very important needs of biological
organisms: energy and information. On the one hand,
radiant energy from the sun maintains the planet’s sur-
face temperature in a range suitable for life and, through
the process of photosynthesis, is the ultimate source of
energy that sustains most of life in our biosphere. Radia-
tion, primarily in the form of light, also provides critical
information about the environment—information that
is used by plants to regulate movement, trigger devel-
opmental events, and mark the passage of time. The
importance of light in the life of green plants is reﬂected
in the study of photobiology, which encompasses not
only phenomena such as photosynthesis (which reﬂects
the role of sunlight as an energy source) but also
phenomena such as photomorphogenesis and pho-
toperiodism, where sunlight provides the necessary
information for proper plant development and the mea-
surement of daylength, respectively.
In order to fully appreciate the pervasive importance
of light to plants, it is necessary to understand some-
thing of the physical nature of light and the molecules
with which light interacts in plants. In this chapter,
we will
•
explore the physical nature of light and how light
interacts with matter,
•
discuss some of the terminology used in describing
light and methods for measuring it,
•
discuss brieﬂy the characteristics of light in the
natural environment of plants, and
•
review the principal pigments and pigment systems
found in plants.
The various ways in which light is used by plants to
power photosynthesis and regulate development will be
discussed throughout many of the subsequent chapters.

ENERGY, WHICH EXISTS
IN TWO FORMS
What is light? As Johnson recognized more than 200
years ago, ‘‘we all know what light is, but it is not easy
to tell what it is.’’ The simplest answer is that light
is a form of radiant energy, a narrow band of energy
within the continuous electromagnetic spectrum

of radiation emitted by the sun (Figure 6.1). The term
‘‘light’’ describes that portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum that causes the physiological sensation of
vision in humans. In other words, light is deﬁned by the
range of wavelengths—between 400 and approximately
700 nanometers—capable of stimulating the receptors
located in the retina of the human eye. Strictly speaking,
those regions of the spectrum we perceive as red, green,
or blue are called light, whereas the ultraviolet and
infrared regions of the spectrum, which our eyes cannot
detect (although they may have signiﬁcant biological
effects), are referred to as ultraviolet or infrared
radiation, respectively. While the following discussion
will focus on light, it is understood that the principles
involved apply to radiant energy in the broader sense.
Like other forms of energy, light is a bit of an enigma
and is difﬁcult to deﬁne. It is more easily described not by
what it is but by how it interacts with matter. Physicists
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
resolved that light has attributes of both continuous
waves and discrete particles. Both of these attributes are
important in understanding the biological role of light.
6.1.2 LIGHT CAN BE CHARACTERIZED
AS A WAVE PHENOMENON
The propagation of light through space is characterized
by regular and repetitive changes, or waves, in its electri-
cal and magnetic properties. Electromagnetic radiation
actually consists of two waves—one electrical and one
magnetic—that oscillate at 90◦to each other and to the
direction of propagation (Figure 6.2). The wave proper-
ties of light may be characterized by either wavelength
or frequency. The distance in space between wave
crests is known as the wavelength and is represented
by the Greek letter lambda (λ). Biologists commonly
express wavelengths in units of nanometers (nm), where
1 nm = 10−9 m. Frequency, represented by the Greek
letter nu (ν), is the number of wave crests, or cycles,
passing a point in space in one second. Frequency is thus
related to wavelength in the following way:
ν = c/λ
(6.1)
where c is the speed of light (3 × 108 m s−1). Biologists
most commonly use wavelength to describe light and
other forms of radiation, although frequency is useful
in certain situations. Wavelengths of primary inter-
est to photobiologists fall into three distinct ranges:
ultraviolet, visible, and infrared (Table 6.1).
6.1.3 LIGHT CAN BE CHARACTERIZED
AS A STREAM OF DISCRETE
PARTICLES
When light is emitted from a source or interacts with
matter, it behaves as though its energy is divided into
discrete units or particles called photons. The energy
carried by a photon is called a quantum (pl. quanta), to
reﬂect the fact that the energy can be quantized, that is,
it can be divided into multiple units.
The energy carried by a photon (Eq) is related
to wavelength and frequency in accordance with the
following relationship:
Eq = hc/λ = hν

where h is a proportionality constant, called Planck’s
constant. The value of h is 6.62 × 10−34 J s photon−1.
Accordingly, the quantum energy of radiation is inversely
proportional to its wavelength or directly proportional to
its frequency. The symbol hν (pronounced ‘‘h nu’’) is
commonly used to represent a photon in ﬁgures and
diagrams.
Since both h and c are constants, the energy of
a photon is easily calculated for any wavelength of
interest. The following example illustrates a calculation
of the energy content of red light, with a representative
wavelength of 660 nm (6.6 × 10−7 m).
Eq
= (6.62 × 10−34J s photon−1)
(3 × 108m s−1)/6.6 × 10−7m
(6.3)
Solving for Eq:
Eq = 3.01 × 10−19J photon−1
(6.4)
For blue light, with a representative wavelength of
435 nm (4.35 × 10−7 m),
Eq
= (6.62 × 10−34J s photon−1)
(3 × 108m s−1)/4.35 × 10−7m
(6.5)
Again, solving for Eq:
Eq = 4.56 × 10−19J photon−1
(6.6)
As the above numbers indicate, the energy content
of a single photon is a very small number. However, the
Einstein-Stark law of photochemical equivalence states that
one photon can interact with only one electron. Thus,
in any irreversible photochemical reaction, the energy
of one photon may be used to convert one molecule of
reactant A to one molecule of product B.
A + hν →B
(6.7)
Since one mole of any substance contains Avo-
gadro’s number (N) of molecules (N = 6.023 × 1023
molecules mol−1), to convert one mole of reactant A
to one mole of product B would require N number of
photons. Thus, for practical purposes it is convenient
to multiply the energy of a single photon by Avogadro’s
number, which gives the value of energy for a mole of
photons. The energy carried by a mole of photons of red
light, for example, is 181,292 J mol−1, or 181 kJ mol−1
(Table 6.1). The energy carried by a mole of photons of
blue light is correspondingly 274 kJ mol−1. The concept
of a mole of photons is more useful than dealing with
individual photons. For example, as will become appar-
ent in the following section, the law of photochemical
equivalence states that a mole of photons of a partic-
ular wavelength would be required to excite a mole of
pigment molecules.
6.1.4 LIGHT ENERGY CAN INTERACT
WITH MATTER
For light to be used by plants, it must ﬁrst be absorbed.
The absorption of light by any molecule is a photo-
physical event involving internal electronic transitions
(Figure 6.3A). The Gotthaus-Draper principle tells us
that only light that is absorbed can be active in a pho-
tochemical process. In contrast to photophysical events,
photochemistry refers to any chemical reaction which
utilizes absorbed light to convert reactants to products,
that is, any light-dependent reaction (Equation 6.7).
Therefore, any photobiological phenomenon requires
the participation of a molecule that absorbs light. Such
a molecule may be deﬁned as a pigment. Plants contain
a variety of pigments that are prominent visual features
and important physiological components of virtually
all plants. The characteristic green color of leaves, for
example, is due to a family of pigments known as the
chlorophylls. Chlorophyll absorbs the light energy used
in photosynthesis. The pleasing colors of ﬂoral petals

energy level diagram depicting the various possible tran-
sitions when light is absorbed. A nonexcited molecule
is said to be in the ground state (S0). Upon absorption
of light of wavelength of either λ1 or λ2, a molecule can
undergo an electronic transition (solid arrows) to a sin-
glet excited state represented by either S1 or S2, respec-
tively. Within each singlet excited state exist various
internal energy states representing vibrational and rota-
tional states (smaller horizontal lines). Dashed arrows
represent radiationless decay through which energy is
given up primarily as heat. Fluorescence (F) is the emis-
sion of light from the lowest excited singlet state. T1
represents the metastable excited triplet state. Energy
from the triplet excited state may be lost by radiationless
decay or by delayed emission of light known as phospho-
rescence (P). The triplet state is sufﬁciently long-lived
to allow for photochemical reactions to occur. (B) An
absorption spectrum (solid line) is a graph in which
absorbance is plotted as a function of wavelength. Peaks
or absorption bands correspond to the principal excita-
tion levels illustrated in the energy diagram. Also shown
is a ﬂuorescence emission spectrum (dashed line) that
corresponds to the emission of the absorbed energy as
light from the lowest excited singlet state (S1).
are due to the anthocyanin pigments that serve to attract
insects as pollen vectors. Other pigments, such as phy-
tochrome, are present in quantities too small to be visible
but nonetheless serve important roles in plant morpho-
genesis. These and other important plant pigments will
be described later in this chapter.
What actually happens when a pigment molecule
absorbs light? Absorption of light by a pigment molecule
is a rapid, photophysical, electronic event, occurring
within a femtosecond (fs = 10−15 s). In accordance
with the First Law of Thermodynamics (Chapter 5),
the energy of the absorbed photon is transferred to an
electron in the pigment molecule during that extremely
short period of time. The energy of the electron is thus
elevated from a low energy level, the ground state, to a
higher energy level known as the excited, or singlet,
state. This change in energy level is illustrated graphi-
cally in Figure 6.3. Like photons, the energy states
of electrons are also quantized, that is, an electron can
exist in only one of a series of discrete energy levels.
A photon can be absorbed only if its energy content
matches the energy required to raise the energy of the
electron to one of the higher, allowable energy states.
In the same way that quanta cannot be sub-
divided, electrons cannot be partially excited. Although,
according to the Einstein-Stark law of photochemical
equivalence, a single photon can excite only one elec-
tron, complex pigment molecules, such as chlorophyll,
will have many different electrons, each of which
may absorb a photon of a different energy level and,
consequently, different wavelength. Moreover, each
singlet excited state in which an electron may exist may
be subdivided into a variety of smaller but discrete
internal energy levels called vibrational and rotational
levels. This broadens even further the number of
photons that may be absorbed (Figure 6.3). Pigment
molecules such as chlorophyll, when exposed to white
light, will thus exhibit many different excited states at
one time.
An excited molecule has a very short lifetime (on
the order of a nanosecond, or 10−9 s) and, in the absence
of any chemical interaction with other molecules in its
environment, it must rid itself of any excess energy and
return to the ground state. Dissipation of excess energy
may be accomplished in several ways.
1.
Thermal deactivation occurs when a molecule
loses excitation energy as heat (Figure 6.3A). The
electron will very quickly drop or relax to the lowest
excited singlet state. The excess energy is given
off as heat to its environment. If the electron then
returns to the ground state, that energy will also be
dissipated as heat.
2.
Fluorescence is the emission of a photon of light
as an electron relaxes from the ﬁrst singlet excited
to ground state. Since the rate of relaxation through
ﬂuorescence is much slower than the rate of relax-
ation through thermal deactivation, ﬂuorescence
emission occurs only as a consequence of relaxation
from the ﬁrst excited singlet state (Figure 6.3A).
Consequently, the emitted photon has a lower
energy content, and, in accordance with Equation
6.1, a longer wavelength, than the exciting photon.
In the case of the photosynthetic pigment chloro-
phyll, for example, peak ﬂuorescent emission falls to
the long-wavelength side of the red absorption band
(Figure 6.3B). This is true regardless of whether the
pigment was excited with blue light (450 nm, 262 kJ
mol−1) or red light (660 nm, 181 kJ mol−1). For
pigments such as chlorophyll in solution, a return

to the ground state by emission of red light is often
the only available option.
3.
Energy
may
be
transferred
between
pigment
molecules by what is known as inductive reso-
nance or radiationless transfer. Such transfers
will occur with high efﬁciency, but require that
the pigment molecules are very close together
and that the ﬂuorescent emission band of the
donor molecule overlaps the absorption band of
the recipient. Inductive resonance accounts for
much of the transfer of energy between pigment
molecules in the chloroplast (Chapter 7).
4.
The molecule may revert to another type of excited
state, called the triplet state (Figure 6.3A). The dif-
ference between singlet and triplet states, related to
the spin of the valence electrons, is not so important
here. It is sufﬁcient to know that the triplet state
is more stable than the singlet state—it is consid-
ered a metastable state. The longer lifetime of the
metastable triplet state (on the order of 10−3 s) is
sufﬁcient to allow for photochemical reactions to
occur. This could take the form of an oxidation
reaction in which the energetic electron is actually
given up to an acceptor molecule. When this occurs,
the pigment is said to be photooxidized and the
acceptor molecule becomes reduced.
6.1.5 HOW DOES ONE ILLUSTRATE
THE EFFICIENCY OF LIGHT
ABSORPTION AND ITS
PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS?
Figure 6.4B illustrates a graph whereby the absorption
of light by a pigment (in this case, chlorophyll) mea-
sured as relative absorbance is plotted as a function of
wavelength. The resulting graph is known as an absorp-
tion spectrum which emphasizes the correspondence
between possible excitation states of the molecule and
the principal bands in the absorption spectrum. The
energy level diagram in Figure 6.3B represents, in a
broad sense, absorption of light by chlorophyll. In this
case, λ1 would represent red light and λ2 would represent
blue light.
An absorption spectrum is in effect a probability
statement. The height of the absorption curve (or width,
as presented in Figure 6.4B) at any given wavelength
reﬂects the probability by which light of that energy
level will be absorbed. More importantly, an absorp-
tion spectrum is like a ﬁngerprint of the molecule.
Every light-absorbing molecule has a unique absorption
spectrum that is often a key to its identiﬁcation. For
example, there are several different variations of the
green pigment chlorophyll. The pattern of the absorp-
tion spectrum for each variation generally resembles that
shown in Figure 6.4B, yet each variation of chlorophyll

differs with respect to the precise wavelengths at which
maximum absorbance occurs.
Because light must ﬁrst be absorbed in order to
be effective in a physiological process, it follows that
there must be a pigment that absorbs the effective
light. One of the ﬁrst tasks facing a photobiologist
when studying a light-dependent response is to iden-
tify the responsible pigment. One important piece of
information is called an action spectrum. An action
spectrum is a graph that shows the effectiveness of
light in inducing a particular process plotted as a
function of wavelength. The underlying assumption
is that light most efﬁciently absorbed by the responsi-
ble pigment will also be most effective in driving the
response. In other words, the action spectrum for a
light-dependent response should closely resemble the
absorption spectrum of the pigment or pigments that
absorb the effective light. A comparison of an action
spectrum with the absorption spectra of suspected pig-
ments can therefore provide useful clues to the identity
of the pigment responsible for a photosensitive process.
As an example, a typical action spectrum for photo-
synthesis in a green plant is shown in Figure 6.4A. It
is compared with the absorption spectrum for a leaf
extract that contains primarily chlorophyll and some
carotenoid (Figure 6.4B). Note that the action spectrum
has pronounced peaks in the red and blue regions of
the spectrum and that these action maxima correspond
to the absorption maxima for chlorophyll. This is part

of the evidence that identiﬁes a role for chlorophyll in
photosynthesis.
6.1.6 ACCURATE MEASUREMENT
OF LIGHT IS IMPORTANT IN
PHOTOBIOLOGY
Given the manifold ways in which light can inﬂuence
the physiology and development of plants, it should
not be too surprising that proper measurement and
description of light and light sources has become a
signiﬁcant component of many laboratory and ﬁeld
studies. Many experiments are now conducted in con-
trolled environment-rooms or chambers that allow the
researcher to control light, temperature, and humidity.
To permit others to interpret the experiments or repeat
them in their own laboratories, it is essential that light
sources and conditions be fully and accurately described.
The spectral distribution of light emitted from ﬂuores-
cent lamps is very different from that emitted from
tungsten lamps or from natural skylight. Because of
these and many other factors, each light source may
have demonstrably different effects on plant develop-
ment and behavior. Even natural light changes in quality
from dawn through midday to dusk, or between shady
and sunny habitats or cloudy and open skies. Under-
standing photobiology thus requires an understanding
of how light is measured and what those measurements
mean. Also required is a consistent terminology that is
understood by everyone working in the ﬁeld.
There are three parameters of primary concern
when describing light. The ﬁrst is light quantity—how
much light has the plant received? The second is the
composition of light with respect to wavelength, known
as light quality, spectral composition, or spectral
energy distribution (SED). The third factor is timing.
What are the duration and periodicity of the light
treatment?
The measure of light quantity most widely accepted
by plant photobiologists is based on the concept of ﬂu-
ence. Fluence is deﬁned as the quantity of radiant energy
falling on a small sphere, divided by the cross-section
of the sphere. Since light is a form of energy that can
be emitted or absorbed as discrete packets or photons,
ﬂuence can be expressed in terms of either the number
of photons or quanta (in moles, mol) or the amount
of energy (in joules, J). Photon ﬂuence (units = mol
m−2) refers to the total number of photons incident on
the sphere while energy ﬂuence (units = J m−2) refers
to the total amount of energy incident on the sphere.
The corresponding rate terms are photon ﬂuence rate
(units = mol m−2 s−1) and energy ﬂuence rate (units =
J m−2 s−1 or W m−2). The term irradiance is frequently
used interchangeably with energy ﬂuence rate, although
in principle the two are not equivalent. Irradiance refers
to the ﬂux of energy on a ﬂat surface rather than a sphere.
Many instruments for measuring radiation actually
measure total energy, including energy outside the visi-
ble portion of the spectrum, such as infrared, which is
not directly relevant to photobiological processes. In
order to avoid such complications, instruments are now
commercially available that are limited to that portion
of the spectrum between 400 nm and 700 nm. This
range of light is broadly deﬁned as photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR). Thus photon ﬂuence rates,
expressed as mol photons m−2 s−1 PAR, or energy
ﬂuence rates, expressed as Watts (W) m−2 PAR, are
widely accepted for routine laboratory work in plant
photobiology. The only serious limitation to PAR
measurements is that they exclude light in the 700
to 750 nm range—light which, although inactive in
higher plant photosynthesis, plays a signiﬁcant role in
regulating plant development (Chapter 16).
The term ‘‘light quality’’ refers to spectral compo-
sition and is usually deﬁned by an emission or incidence

atmospheric gases (primarily CO2 and H2O). The solar

weather from an observatory in Australia by C. W. Allen.

spectrum. SED is measured with a spectroradiometer,
an instrument capable of measuring ﬂuence rate over
narrow-wavelength bands. Depending on the instru-
ment, either spectral photon ﬂuence rate (units = mol
photons m−2 s−1 nm−1) or spectral energy ﬂuence rate
(units = W m−2 nm−1) is plotted against wavelength.
In practice, spectroradiometers are also equipped with
ﬂat surface detectors that measure spectral irradiance
(W m−2 nm−1).
SED can vary depending on the nature of the light
source and a number of other factors (Figure 6.5).
The SED of natural sunlight, for example, can vary
depending on the quality of the atmosphere, cloud cover,
and the time of day (Figure 6.5A). The SED of artiﬁcial
sources, such as incandescent and ﬂuorescent lamps, are
signiﬁcantly different from natural light (Figure 6.5B).
Fluorescent light has a relatively high emission in the
blue but drops off sharply in the red. Incandescent light,
on the other hand, contains relatively little blue light
but high emissions in the far-red and infrared.
6.2 THE NATURAL RADIATION
ENVIRONMENT
A relatively small proportion of the radiation origi-
nating in the sun reaches the earth’s atmosphere and
even less actually reaches the surface (Figure 6.5A).
However, both the quantity and spectral distribution
of radiant energy that reaches (or fails to reach) earth
may have a signiﬁcant impact on the physiology of the
plant. As well, radiant energy is central to several prob-
lems of more immediate and profound consequences
for man.
Signiﬁcant amounts of infrared radiation are absor-
bed by the water vapor and carbon dioxide and other
gases present in the earth’s atmosphere (Figure 6.5A),
giving rise to a phenomenon known as the green-
house effect (Figure 6.6). Although public awareness of
the greenhouse effect has increased markedly in recent
years, it is not a phenomenon restricted to the late
twentieth century. Indeed, the greenhouse effect has
been with us since the beginnings of life on earth. With-
out it, life as we know it would not be possible. Infrared
radiation is of low frequency (or long wavelength) and
therefore low energy. Its principal effect is to increase
vibrational activity in molecules—that is, heat. Absorp-
tion of infrared by atmospheric water vapor and carbon
dioxide creates a ‘‘thermal blanket’’ that helps to pre-
vent extreme variations in temperature such as occur on
the lunar surface, where these gases are absent. Simi-
lar, although less extreme, temperature variations are
characteristic of dry, desert regions on earth where
high daytime temperatures alternate with very cool
nights.

FIGURE 6.6 Diagram representing the greenhouse effect.
Radiation from the sun warms both the atmosphere
and the earth. (A) The earth then reradiates infrared
(heat) back into the atmosphere. (B) Here the infrared
radiation is either reﬂected back to earth or absorbed
by atmospheric gases, such as CO2, H2O vapor, and
methanol, thus preventing its escape. (C) Some of the
trapped infrared is reradiated back to earth, giving rise to
increased temperatures.
Public concern about the greenhouse effect arises
from evidence that, since the beginnings of the indus-
trial revolution, our prodigious consumption of fossil
fuels has contributed to a steady increase in atmospheric
carbon dioxide and other so-called ‘‘greenhouse gases.’’
Many believe that continued release of carbon dioxide
will lead to greater heat retention in the atmosphere and
global warming. This could result in partial melting of
polar ice caps with extensive ﬂooding of low-lying land
areas and major shifts in plant biodiversity and agri-
cultural productivity. A scenario commonly proposed
is that higher carbon dioxide levels will stimulate pho-
tosynthesis and increase the amount of plant material
on earth. However, this is an overly simplistic view of
the effects of CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis.
Increases in both global temperatures and global CO2
concentrations can have negative effects on photosyn-
thetic rates.
At the other end of the spectrum, ultraviolet radi-
ation is characterized by short wavelength, high fre-
quency, and high energy levels (Table 6.1). Absorption
of ultraviolet radiation creates highly reactive molecules,
often causing the ejection of an electron, or ionization of
the molecule. Such ionizations usually have deleterious
effects on organisms. A principal action of UV-C (about
254 nm), for example, is to induce thiamine dimers
(hence, mutations) in deoxyribonucleic acid. In the nat-
ural environment, UV-induced mutation is not normally
a major problem because little far-ultraviolet radiation
reaches the surface. Virtually all of the UV-C and most

100
Chapter 6 / The Dual Role of Sunlight: Energy and Information
of the UV-B is absorbed by ozone (O3) and aerosols (dis-
persed particles of solids or liquids) in the stratosphere.
If, however, the atmospheric ozone concentration were
to be lowered, there would be an increased potential
for harmful effects to all organisms. In recent years,
just such a depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer,
leading to increases in UV-B radiation reaching the
earth’s surface, has become a matter of some concern.
Data compiled over the past two decades have revealed
that approximately one-half of the plant species stud-
ied are adversely affected by elevated UV-B radiation.
It is perhaps not surprising that plants most sensitive
to UV-B radiation are those native to lower elevations
where UV-B ﬂuxes are normally low.
With respect to both frequency and energy level,
visible light falls between UV and infrared radiation.
Absorption of visible light raises the energy level of
valence electrons of the absorbing molecule and thus has
the potential for initiating useful photochemical reac-
tions. Moreover, the ﬂuence rate and spectral quality of
visible light are constantly changing, often predictably,
throughout the day or season. These variations convey
information about the environment—information that
the plant can use to its advantage.
The two most signiﬁcant changes in visible light on
a daily basis are seen in the ﬂuence rate and in spectral
distribution. Typically at midday under full sun, the
ﬂuence rate approaches 2000 μmol m−2 s−1. At twilight,
just before the sun sets below the horizon, the ﬂuence
rate will have dropped to the order of 10 μmol m−2 s−1
or less. During the period known as dusk, ﬂuence rate
falls rapidly—by as much as one order of magnitude
every 10 minutes.
Falling light levels at end of day are accompanied
by shifts in spectral quality (see Chapter 24). Normal
daylight consists of direct sunlight and diffuse sky-
light. Diffuse skylight is enriched with blue wavelengths
because the shorter wavelengths are preferentially scat-
tered by moisture droplets, dust, and other components
of the atmosphere. Consequently, normal daylight is
enriched with blue (hence, blue skies!). At twilight,
often deﬁned as a solar elevation of 10◦or less from
the horizon, a combination of scattering and refraction
of the sun’s rays as they enter the earth’s atmosphere
at a low angle enriches the light with longer red and
far-red wavelengths. This is because, at twilight, the
path traversed by sunlight through the atmosphere to
an observer on earth may be up to 50 times longer than
it is when the sun is directly overhead. Much of the
violet and blue light is thus scattered out of the line of
sight, leaving predominantly the longer red and orange
to reach the observer.
Atmospheric factors, such as clouds and air pollu-
tion, also inﬂuence the spectral distribution of sun-
light. Cloud cover reduces irradiance and increases
the proportion of scattered (i.e., blue) light. Airborne
pollutants will cause scattering, but will also absorb cer-
tain wavelengths. Plants growing under a canopy must
cope with severe reduction in red and blue light as
it is ﬁltered through the chlorophyll-containing leaves
above, or with sunﬂecks—spots of direct sunlight that
suddenly appear through an opening in the canopy.
These sudden changes in irradiance may have a signif-
icant impact on the photosynthetic capacity of a plant
(Chapter 14).
It is clear that plants are exposed to an ever-changing
light environment. Many of these changes, such as cloud
cover, are unpredictable but others such as daily changes
in ﬂuence rate and spectral energy distribution occur
with great regularity. The more regular changes convey
precise information about the momentary status of the
environment as well as impending changes (see Chapters
13 and 14). It is perhaps not surprising that plants
have evolved sophisticated means for interpreting this
information as a matter of survival.
6.3 PHOTORECEPTORS ABSORB
LIGHT FOR USE IN A
PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS
Photoreceptors are deﬁned as pigment molecules that
process the energy and informational content of light
into a form that can be used by the plant. A pigment
that contains protein as an integral part of the molecule
is known as a chromoprotein. Thus, photorecep-
tors typically are chromoproteins. The chromophore
(Gr. phoros, bearing) is that portion of the chromo-
protein molecule responsible for absorbing light and,
hence, color. The protein portion of a chromopro-
tein molecule is called the apoprotein. The complete
molecule, or holochrome, consists of the chromophore
plus the protein. The principal photoreceptors found in
plants are described here. Their roles in various phys-
iological processes will be discussed in detail in later
chapters.
6.3.1 CHLOROPHYLLS ARE PRIMARILY
RESPONSIBLE FOR HARVESTING
LIGHT ENERGY FOR
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
As noted earlier, chlorophyll is the pigment primar-
ily responsible for harvesting light energy used in
photosynthesis. The chlorophyll molecule consists of
two parts, a porphyrin head and a long hydrocarbon,
or phytol tail (Figure 6.7). A porphyrin is a cyclic
tetrapyrrole, made up of four nitrogen-containing pyr-
role rings arranged in a cyclic fashion. Porphyrins
are ubiquitous in living organisms and include the
heme group found in mammalian hemoglobin and the

photosynthetic and respiratory pigments, cytochromes
(Chapters 7, 10). Esteriﬁed to ring IV of the porphyrin
in chlorophyll is a 20-carbon alcohol, phytol. This long,
lipid-soluble hydrocarbon tail is a derivative of the
5-carbon isoprene. Isoprene is the precursor to a variety
of important molecules, including other pigments (the
carotenes), hormones (the gibberellins), and steroids
(Chapter 19).
Completing the chlorophyll molecule is a magne-
sium ion (Mg2+) chelated to the four nitrogen atoms in
the center of the ring. Loss of the magnesium ion from
chlorophyll results in the formation of a nongreen prod-
uct, pheophytin. Pheophytin is readily formed during
extraction under acidic conditions, but small amounts
are also found naturally in the chloroplast where it serves
as an early electron acceptor (Chapter 7).
Four species of chlorophyll, designated chlorophyll
a, b, c, and d, are known. The chemical structure of
chlorophyll a, the primary photosynthetic pigment in
all higher plants, algae, and the cyanobacteria, is shown
in Figure 6.7. Chlorophyll b is similar except that a
formyl group (—CHO) substitutes for the methyl group
on ring II. Chlorophyll b is found in virtually all higher
plants and green algae, although viable mutants deﬁcient
of chlorophyll b are known. The principal difference
between chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c (found in the
diatoms, dinoﬂagellates, and brown algae) is that chloro-
phyll c lacks the phytol tail. Finally, chlorophyll d, found
only in the red algae, is similar to chlorophyll a except
that a (—O—CHO) group replaces the (—CH
CH2)
group on ring I.
When grown in the dark, angiosperm seedlings
do not accumulate chlorophyll (Chapter 5, Box 1).
Their yellow color is primarily due to the presence of
carotenoids. Dark-grown seedlings do, however, accu-
mulate signiﬁcant amounts of protochlorophyll a, the
immediate precursor to chlorophyll a. The chemical
structure of protochlorophyll differs from chlorophyll
only by the presence of a double bond between carbons 7
and 8 in ring IV (Figure 6.7). The reduction of this bond
is catalyzed by the enzyme NADPH:protochlorophyll
oxidoreductase. In angiosperms this reaction requires
light, but in gymnosperms and most algae chlorophyll
can be synthesized in the dark. There is a general consen-
sus among investigators that chlorophyll b is synthesized
from chlorophyll a.
Note that the respective chlorophylls exhibit gen-
erally a similar shape to their absorption spectra in
organic solvents, but exhibit absorption maxima at dis-
tinctly different wavelengths, in both the blue and the
red regions of the spectrum (Figure 6.8). These shifts
in the absorbance maxima illustrate that subtle chemical
changes in the porphyrin ring of chlorophyll (Figure 6.7)
have signiﬁcant effects on the absorption properties of
this pigment. This is evidence that it is the porphyrin
ring of chlorophyll that actually absorbs the light and
not the phytol tail. Note also that chlorophyll does not
absorb strongly in the green region of the visible light
spectrum (490–550 nm). The strong absorbance in the
blue and red and transmittance in the green is what gives
chlorophyll its characteristic green color.
The presence of the long hydrocarbon phytol
exerts a dominant effect on the solubility of chlorophyll,
rendering it virtually insoluble in water. In the plant,

noncovalent associations with hydrophobic proteins.
Only an extremely small percentage of the chlorophyll
found in vivo is ever free chlorophyll, that is, not
bound to proteins. The absorption spectra of these
chlorophyll-protein complexes are markedly different
from that of free pigment in solution. For example,
chlorophyll a-protein absorbs primarily in the region
of 675 nm as opposed to 663 nm for chlorophyll a in
acetone. Conjugation of chlorophylls with protein in the
membrane is important for three reasons. One is that it
helps to maintain the pigment molecules in the precise
relationship
required
for
efﬁcient
absorption
and
energy transfer. A second reason is that it provides each
pigment with a unique environment that in turn gives
each molecule a slightly different absorption maximum.
These slight absorbance differences are an important
factor in the orderly transfer of energy through
the pigment bed toward the reaction center where
photochemical conversion actually occurs (Chapter 7).

plants,

with O2 to generate to highly dangerous and reactive
oxygen species such as oxygen free radicals, hydroxyl
radicals, and singlet oxygen. These reactive oxygen
species may destroy the chloroplast. Although light
energy is essential for life, clearly it can be a very
dangerous form of energy especially in an aerobic
environment! Later we will examine the mechanisms
that photosynthetic organisms have evolved to protect
themselves against this potential danger (Chapter 14).
6.3.2 PHYCOBILINS SERVE AS
ACCESSORY LIGHT-HARVESTING
PIGMENTS IN RED ALGAE AND
CYANOBACTERIA
Phycobilins are straight-chain or open-chain tetrapyr-
role pigment molecules present in the eukaryotic red
algae and the prokaryotic cyanobacteria (Figure 6.9).
The preﬁx, phyco, designates pigments of algal origin.
Four phycobilins are known. Three of these are involved
in photosynthesis and the fourth, phytochromobilin,
is an important photoreceptor that regulates various
aspects of growth and development (Chapter 22).
The three photosynthetic phycobilins are phycoery-
thrin (also known as phycoerythrobilin), phycocyanin
(phycocyanobilin),
and
allophycocyanin
(allophyco-
cyanobilin). In addition to the open-chain tetrapyrrole,
the
phycobilin
pigments
differ
from
chlorophyll
in that the tetrapyrrole group is covalently linked
with a protein that forms a part of the molecule. In
the cell, phycobiliproteins are organized into large
macromolecular complexes called phycobilisomes.
With the exception of phytochromobilin, phyco-
bilin pigments are not found in higher plants but
occur exclusively in the cyanobacteria and the red algae
(Rhodophyta) where they assume a light-harvesting
function in photosynthesis. Phycobilins, and in par-
ticular phycoerythrin, are useful as light harvesters for
photosynthesis because they absorb light energy in the
green region of the visible spectrum where chloro-
phyll does not absorb (Figure 6.10). The red algae,
for example, appear almost black because the chloro-
phyll and phycoerythrin together absorb almost all of
the visible radiation for use in photosynthesis (compare
Figure 6.10 with Figure 6.8).

Compare with the absorption spectra of chlorophyll
(Figure 6.8). Note that the phycobilins, phycoerythrin
in particular, absorb strongly in the 500–600 nm range
where chlorophyll absorption is minimal.
The fourth phycobiliprotein, of particular signiﬁ-
cance to higher plants, is phytochrome, a receptor that
plays an important role in many photomorphogenic
phenomena. Its chromophore structure and absorption
spectrum are similar to that of allophycocyanin. Phy-
tochrome (literally, plant pigment) is unique because it
exists in two forms that are photoreversible. The form
P660 (or Pr) absorbs maximally at 660 nm. However,
absorption of 660 nm light converts the pigment to a
second, far-red-absorbing form P735 (or Pfr). Absorp-
tion of far-red light by Pfr converts it back to the
red-absorbing form. Pfr is believed to be an active
form of the pigment that is capable of initiating a wide
range of morphogenetic responses. Phytochrome will
be discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.
6.3.3 CAROTENOIDS ACCOUNT
FOR THE AUTUMN COLORS
Carotenoids comprise a family of orange and yellow
pigments present in most photosynthetic organisms.
Found in large quantity in roots of carrot and tomato
fruit, carotenoid pigments are also prominent in green
leaves. In the fall of the year, the chlorophyll pigments
are degraded and the more stable carotenoid pigments
account for the brilliant orange and yellow colors so
characteristic of autumn foliage.
Carotenoid pigments are C40 terpenoids biosyn-
thetically derived from the isoprenoid pathway described
in Chapter 19. Because the carotenoids are predomi-
nantly hydrocarbons, they are lipid soluble and found
either in the chloroplast membranes or in specialized
plastids called chromoplasts. The concentration of pig-
ment in chromoplasts may reach very high levels, to the
extent that the pigment actually forms crystals. The
carotenoid family of pigments includes carotenes and
xanthophylls (Figure 6.11). Carotenes are predomi-
nantly orange or red-orange pigments. β-carotene is
the major carotenoid in algae and higher plants. Note
that in β-carotene and α-carotene (a minor form), both
ends of the molecule are cyclized. Other forms, such as
γ -carotene, found in the green photosynthetic bacteria,
have only one end cyclized. Lycopene, the principal pig-
ment of tomato fruit, has both ends open. The yellow
carotenoids, xanthophylls, are oxygenated carotenes.
Lutein and zeaxanthin, for example, are hydroxylated
forms of α-carotene and β-carotene, respectively.
Like chlorophyll, β-carotene in the chloroplast is
complexed with protein. β-carotene, which absorbs
strongly in the blue region of the visible spectrum
(Figure 6.12), is known to quench both the triplet excited
chlorophyll as well as the highly reactive singlet excited
oxygen, which can be generated by the reaction of triplet
chlorophyll with ground state oxygen. Thus, β-carotene
protects chlorophyll from photooxidation.
6.3.4 CRYPTOCHROME AND
PHOTOTROPIN ARE
PHOTORECEPTORS SENSITIVE
TO BLUE LIGHT AND UV-A
RADIATION
A wide range of plant responses to blue light and UV-A
radiation have been known or suspected for a long
time. Cryptochrome was the name given initially to
the blue light/UV-A photoreceptor because blue light
responses appeared to be prevalent in cryptograms, an
old primary division of plants which do not exhibit true
ﬂowers and seeds and included ferns, mosses, algae and
fungi. In addition, the molecular nature of the blue light
photoreceptor remained unknown, and thus, cryptic
(secret or hidden) for many years. However, recent
research has established that cryptochromes are found
throughout the plant kingdom. The action spectrum
for cryptochrome exhibits two peaks, one in the UVA
region (320-400 nm) and one in the blue region of
the visible spectrum (400-500 nm). The chromophore
for cryptochrome is a ﬂavin. The three most common
ﬂavins are riboﬂavin (Figure 6.13) and its two nucleotide
derivatives, ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN) and ﬂavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The ﬂavins may occur free
or complexed with protein, in which case they are called
ﬂavoprotein. However, those ﬂavins that function as
photoreceptors probably constitute a very small portion
of a much larger pool. Both FMN and FAD, for example,
are important cofactors in cellular oxidation–reduction
reactions (Chapter 5).
Arabidopsis has two genes for cryptochrome (CRY1
and CRY 2) whereas tomato has at least three genes
that encode this photoreceptor. Mosses and ferns exhibit

Interestingly, the sequence of the CRY1 protein is
similar to photolyase, a unique class of ﬂavoproteins
that use blue light to stimulate repair of UV-induced
damage to microbial DNA. Photolyases contain two
chromophores; one a ﬂavin (FAD) and one a pterin
(Figure 6.13). Although the precise nature of the CRY1
chromophores remains to be determined, it appears that
one is FAD and the second is likely to be a pterin. Cryp-
tochromes are cytoplasmic proteins with a mass of about
75 kDa and, together with phytochrome, mediate photo-
morphogenic responses such as photoperiod-dependent

the inhibition of stem elongation.
Phototropins (PHOT) are a second class of blue
light photoreceptor that was ﬁrst discovered in the late
1980s. Arabidopsis exhibits two phototropin genes des-
ignated PHOT1 and PHOT2. Like cryptochrome,
phototropin is also a ﬂavoprotein with two FMN
molecules as chromophores. The molecular mass of this
photoreceptor is about 120 kDa and is localized to
the plasmamembrane. Phototropins are not involved
in photomorphogenic responses. Analyses of mutants
deﬁcient in either PHOT1 or PHOT2 indicate that these
two genes exhibit partial overlapping roles in the regu-
lation of phototropism. Furthermore, phototropins play
important roles in optimizing photosynthetic efﬁciency
of plants such as the regulation of stomatal opening
for CO2 gas exchange as well as chloroplast avoidance
movement to protect the photosynthetic apparatus
from photoinhibition due to exposure to excess light
(Chapter 13). The biochemical nature and physiological
roles of these blue light/UV-A photoreceptors are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.
6.3.5 UV-B RADIATION MAY ACT
AS A DEVELOPMENTAL SIGNAL
More recently, a small number of responses, such as
anthocyanin synthesis in young milo seedlings (Sorghum
vulgare) and suspension cultures of parsley or carrot cells
have been described with an action spectrum peak near
290 nm and no action at wavelengths longer than about
350 nm. These ﬁndings would seem to indicate the
presence of one or more UV-B (280–320 nm) receptors
in plants, although the nature of the photoreceptors has
yet to be identiﬁed with certainty.
The impact of ultraviolet radiation, especially
UV-B, on plants is receiving increasing attention
because
of
concerns
about
the
thinning
of
the
atmospheric ozone layer. A reduction in the ozone layer
results in an increase in UV-B radiation, speciﬁcally
between 290 and 314 nm, which can cause damage
to nucleic acids, proteins, and the photosynthetic
apparatus and lead to shorter plants and reduced
biomass. The UV-B receptor also appears to modulate
responses to phytochrome in some systems. It has yet
to be identiﬁed.
6.3.6 FLAVONOIDS PROVIDE THE
MYRIAD FLOWER COLORS AND
ACT AS A NATURAL SUNSCREEN
Although the plant world is predominantly green, it is
the brilliant colors of ﬂoral petals, fruits, bracts, and
occasionally leaves that most attracts humans and a vari-
ety of other animals to plants. These various shades of
scarlet, pink, purple, and blue are due to the presence of

pigments known as anthocyanins. Anthocyanins belong
to a larger group of compounds known as ﬂavonoids.
Other classes of ﬂavonoids (e.g., chalcones and aurones)
contribute to the yellow colors of some ﬂowers. Yet
others (the ﬂavones) are responsible for the whiteness of
ﬂoral petals that, without them, might appear translu-
cent. The ﬂavonoids are readily isolated and, because
of their brilliant colors, have been known since antiq-
uity as a source of dyes. Consequently, the ﬂavonoids
have been extensively studied since the beginnings of
modern organic chemistry and their chemistry is well
known. The biosynthesis of ﬂavonoids is discussed in
Chapter 28.
Flavonoids are phenylpropane derivatives with a
basic C6—C3—C6 composition (Figure 6.14). The most
strongly colored of the ﬂavonoids are the anthocyani-
dins and anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are the glycoside
derivatives of anthocyanidins. Unlike chlorophyll, the
anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments and are found
predominantly in the vacuolar sap. They are readily
extracted into weakly acidic solution. The color of
anthocyanins is sensitive to pH: both anthocyanidins and
anthocyanins are natural indicator dyes. For example,
the color of cyanidin changes from red (acid) to violet
(neutral) to blue (alkaline). The deep violet extract of
boiled red cabbage will turn a deﬁnitely unappetizing
blue-green if boiled in alkaline water!
Anthocyanins in leaves such as Coleus and red-
leaved cultivars of maple (Acer sps.) are found in the
vacuoles of the epidermal cells, where they appear
to mask the chlorophylls. However, the anthocyanins
absorb strongly between 475 nm and 560 nm while
transmitting both blue and red light. Consequently, the
presence of anthocyanins does not interfere with photo-
synthesis in the chloroplasts of the underlying mesophyll
cells.
Virtually all ﬂavonoids absorb strongly in the UV-B
region of the spectrum (Figure 6.15). Since these com-
pounds also occur in leaves, one possible function of the
ﬂavonoids is thought to be protection of the underlying
leaf tissues from damage due to ultraviolet radiation.
Thus, the accumulation of UV-B absorbing ﬂavonoids
acts as a natural sunscreen for plants, green algae, and
cyanobacteria. As ﬂower pigments, the ﬂavonoids attract
insect pollinators. Many insects can detect ultraviolet
light and thus can perceive patterns contributed by the
colorless ﬂavonoids as well as the colored patterns visible
to humans. The synthesis of anthocyanins is stimulated
by light, both UV and visible, as well as by nutrient stress

low temperature.
At least one group of ﬂavonoids, the isoﬂavonoids,
have become known for their antimicrobial activities.
Isoﬂavonoids are one of several classes of chemicals of
differing chemical structures, known as phytoalexins,
that help to limit the spread of bacterial and fungal
infections in plants. Phytoalexins are generally absent
or present in very low concentrations, but are rapidly
synthesized following invasion by bacterial and fungal
pathogens. The details of phytoalexin metabolism are
not yet clear. Apparently a variety of small polysaccha-
rides, glycoproteins and proteins of fungal or bacterial
origin, serve as elicitors that stimulate the plant to
begin synthesis of phytoalexins. Studies with soybean
cells infected with the fungus Phytophthora indicate that
the fungal elicitors trigger transcription of mRNA for
enzymes involved in the synthesis of isoﬂavonoids. The
production of phytoalexins appears to be a common
defense mechanism. Isoﬂavonoids are the predominant
phytoalexin in the family Leguminoseae, but other
families, such as Solanaceae, appear to use terpene
derivatives.

Betacyanins and the related betaxanthins (yellow)
are distinguished from anthocyanins by the fact that
the molecules contain nitrogen. They appear to be
restricted to a small group of closely related families
in the order Chenopodiales, including the goosefoot,
cactus, and portulaca families, which are not known to

SUMMARY
Sunlight provides plants with energy to drive photo-
synthesis and critical information about the environ-
ment. Light is a form of electromagnetic energy that
has attributes of continuous waves and discrete parti-
cles. The energy of a particle of light (a quantum) is
inversely proportional to its wavelength.
Light is absorbed by pigments, and pigments that
absorb physiologically useful light are called photo-
receptors. All pigments have a characteristic absorption
spectrum that describes the efﬁciency of light absorp-
tion as a function of wavelength. Because only light that
is absorbed by pigments can be effective in a physiolog-
ical or biochemical process, a comparison of absorption
spectra with the action spectrum for a process helps
to identify the responsible pigment. When light is ab-
sorbed, the pigment becomes excited, or unstable. The
excess energy must be dissipated as heat, reemitted as
light, or used in a photochemical reaction, thus allow-
ing the pigment to return to its stable, ground state.
Regular and predictable changes in ﬂuence rate
and spectral energy distribution provide plants with
information about the momentary status of their envi-
ronment as well as impending changes. The biochem-
ical characteristics of the principal plant pigments of
physiological interest are described.

Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis:
Harvesting Sunlight
Photosynthesis is the fundamental basis of competitive
success in green plants and the principal organ of photo-
synthesis in higher plants is the leaf. From the delicate,
pastel hues of early spring through the brilliant reds and
oranges of autumn, foliage leaves are certainly one of the
dominant features of terrestrial plants. The biologist’s
interest in leaves, however, goes far beyond their aes-
thetic quality. Biologists are interested in the structure
of organs and how those structures are adapted to carry
out effectively certain physiological and biochemical
functions. Leaves provide an excellent demonstration of
this structure–function relationship. While some leaves
may be modiﬁed for special purposes (for example,
tendrils, spines, and ﬂoral parts), the primary function
of leaves remains photosynthesis. In order to absorb
light efﬁciently, a typical leaf presents a large surface
area at approximately right angles to the incoming sun-
light. From this perspective, the leaf may be viewed as
a photosynthetic machine—superbly engineered to carry
out photosynthesis efﬁciently in an extremely hostile
environment.
Photosynthesis occurs not only in eukaryotic organ-
isms such as green plants and green algae but also in
prokaryotic organisms such as cyanobacteria and certain
groups of bacteria. In higher plants and green algae
the reactions of photosynthesis occur in the chloroplast,
which is, quite simply, an incredible thermodynamic
machine. The chloroplast traps the radiant energy of
sunlight and conserves some of it in a stable chemi-
cal form. The reactions that accomplish these energy
transformations are identiﬁed as the light-dependent
reactions of photosynthesis. Energy generated by the
light-dependent reactions is subsequently used to reduce
inorganic carbon dioxide to organic carbon in the form
of sugars. Both the carbon and the energy conserved
in those sugars are then used to build the order and
structure that distinguishes living organisms from their
inorganic surroundings.
The focus of this chapter is the organization of
leaves with respect to the exploitation of light as
the primary source of energy and its conversion to
the stable, chemical forms of ATP and NADPH
by the chloroplast. We will discuss
•
the structure of terrestrial plant leaves with respect
to the interception of light,
•
photosynthesis as the reduction of carbon dioxide
to carbohydrate,
•
the photosynthetic electron transport chain, its
organization in the thylakoid membrane, and its

role in generating reducing potential and ATP,
and
•
the use of herbicides that speciﬁcally interact with
photosynthetic electron transport.
7.1 LEAVES ARE
PHOTOSYNTHETIC
MACHINES THAT MAXIMIZE
THE ABSORPTION OF LIGHT
The architecture of a typical higher plant leaf is par-
ticularly well suited to absorb light. Its broad, laminar
surface serves to maximize interception of light. In addi-
tion, the bifacial nature of the leaf allows it to collect
incident light on the upper surface and diffuse (both scat-
tered and reﬂected) light on the lower surface. Gross
morphology is not, however, the only factor enhancing
interception of light—internal cellular arrangements
also play an important role.
The anatomy of a typical dicotyledonous meso-
morphic leaf is shown in Figure 7.1A,C. The leaf is

sheathed with an upper and lower epidermis. The
exposed surfaces of the epidermal cells are coated with a
cuticle. The photosynthetic tissues are located between
the two epidermal layers and are consequently identi-
ﬁed as mesophyll (meso, middle; phyll, leaf) tissues. The
upper photosynthetic tissue generally consists of one to
three layers of palisade mesophyll cells. Palisade cells
are elongated, cylindrical cells with the long axis per-
pendicular to the surface of the leaf. Below is the spongy
mesophyll, so named because of the prominent air spaces
between the cells. The shape of spongy mesophyll cells
is somewhat irregular but tends toward isodiametric.
The plan of a monocotyledonous leaf is similar except
that it lacks the distinction between palisade and spongy
mesophyll (Figure 7.1B,D).
Palisade cells generally have larger numbers of
chloroplasts than spongy mesophyll cells. In leaves of
Camellia, for example, the chlorophyll concentration
of the palisade cells is 1.5 to 2.5 times that of the spongy
mesophyll cells. The higher number of chloroplasts in
the palisade cells no doubt reﬂects an adaptation to
the higher ﬂuence rates for photosynthetically active
light generally incident on the upper surfaces of the
leaf.

7.1 Leaves are Photosynthetic Machines that Maximize the Absorption of Light
111
In spite of the relatively large number of chloroplasts
in the palisade layers of a dicotyledonous leaf, there is a
signiﬁcant proportion of the cell volume that does not
contain chloroplasts. Because the absorbing pigments
are conﬁned to the chloroplast, a substantial amount of
light may thus pass through the ﬁrst cell layer without
being absorbed. This has been called the sieve effect.
Multiple layers of photosynthetic cells is one way of
increasing the probability that photons passing through
the ﬁrst layer of cells will be intercepted by successive
layers (Figure 7.2).
The impact of the sieve effect on the efﬁciency of
light absorption is to some extent balanced by factors
that change the direction of the light path within the
leaf. Light may ﬁrst of all be reﬂected off the many
surfaces associated with leaf cells. Second, light that is
not reﬂected but passes between the aqueous volume of
mesophyll cells and the air spaces that surround them
(especially in the spongy mesophyll) will be bent by
refraction. Third, light may be scattered when it strikes
particles or structures with diameters comparable to its

fect, redirecting incoming light to chloroplasts along the
lateral walls of the palisade cells. (D) The light-guide

wavelengths. In the leaf cell, for example, both mito-
chondria and the grana structures within chloroplasts
have dimensions (500–1000 nm) similar to the wave-
lengths active in photosynthesis. Both organelles will
scatter light. These three factors—reﬂection, refrac-
tion, and scattering—combine to increase the effective
path length as light passes through the leaf. The longer
light path increases the probability that any given pho-
ton will be absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule before it
can escape from the leaf (Figure 7.2).
Careful studies of the optical properties of leaves
have shown that, in spite of their scattering properties,
palisade cells do not appear to absorb as much light as
might be expected. That is to say that the palisade cells
have a lower than expected efﬁciency of light attenua-
tion. This is apparently because they also act to some
extent as a light guide. Some of the incident light is
channeled through the intercellular spaces between the
palisade cells in much the same way that light is trans-
mitted by an optical ﬁber (Figure 7.2). It is probable
that photosynthesis in the uppermost palisade layer is
frequently light saturated. Any excess light would be
wasteful and could, in fact, give rise to photoinhibi-
tion and other harmful effects that we will discuss in
more detail later in this chapter. Thus, the increased
transmission of light to the lower cell layers resulting
from both scattering and the light-guide effect would no
doubt be advantageous by contributing to a more efﬁ-
cient allocation of photosynthetic energy throughout
the leaf.
Not all leaves are designed like the ‘‘typical’’
dicotyledonous mesomorphic leaf described above.
Leaves may be modiﬁed in many ways to ﬁt particular
environmental situations. Pine leaves (or needles), for
example, are more circular in cross-section. Their
capacity for light interception has been compromised
in favor of a reduced surface-to-volume ratio, a
modiﬁcation that helps to combat desiccation when
exposed to dry winter air. In other cases, such as dry
land or desert species, the leaves are much thicker
in order to provide for storage of water. In extreme
cases, such as the cacti, the leaves have been reduced to
thorns and the stem has taken over the dual functions
of water storage and photosynthesis. These and other
modiﬁcations to leaf morphology will be discussed
more fully in Chapter 14 and 15.
Within the leaf mesophyll cells of plants, the chloro-
plast is the organelle that transforms light energy into
ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 to sugars. The struc-
ture of a typical chloroplast was discussed in Chapter 5.
ATP is synthesized by chemiosmosis, whereas NADPH
is the product of coupled electron transfer reactions in
the chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The enzymatic
reactions involved in the conversion of CO2 to sugars
takes place in the chloroplast stroma (Chapter 8).

7.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS AN
OXIDATION–REDUCTION
PROCESS
Although it may not be obvious at ﬁrst glance, photosyn-
thesis is fundamentally an oxidation–reduction reaction.
This can be seen by examining the summary equation
for photosynthesis:
6CO2 + 12H2O →C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O
(7.1)
Here photosynthesis is shown as a reaction between
CO2 and water to produce glucose, a six-carbon car-
bohydrate or hexose. Although glucose is not the ﬁrst
product of photosynthesis, it is a common form of accu-
mulated carbohydrate and provides a convenient basis
for discussion. Note that equal molar quantities of CO2
and O2 are consumed and evolved, respectively. This is
convenient for the experimenter since it means that pho-
tosynthesis can be measured in the laboratory as either
the uptake of CO2 or the evolution of O2. However,
it is important to note that the ratio of CO2 ﬁxed/O2
evolved = 1 only under conditions where photorespira-
tion is suppressed. We will discuss photorespiration and
its impact on photosynthesis in more detail in Chapter 8.
For simplicity, we can reduce equation 7.1 to
CO2 + 2H2O →(CH2O) + O2 + H2O
(7.2)
where the term (CH2O) represents the basic building
block of carbohydrate. Equation 7.2 can be interpreted
as a simple redox reaction, that is, a reduction of CO2
to carbohydrate, where H2O is the reductant and CO2
is the oxidant. But it might also be interpreted as a
hydration of carbon (e.g., carbohydrate), as it was in
early studies of photosynthesis. How do we know that
it is one and not the other? And why is it necessary
to write the equation with two molecules of water as
reactant (and one as product) when one would appear
to sufﬁce? These questions can best be answered by
reviewing some of the early studies on photosynthesis
(see Box 7.1. Historical Perspective—The Discovery of
Photosynthesis).
One of the earliest clues to the redox nature of
photosynthesis was provided by studies of C. B. van
Niel in the 1920s. As a microbiologist, van Niel was
interested in the photosynthetic sulfur bacteria that
use hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) as a reductant in place of
water. Consequently, unlike algae and higher plants,
the photosynthetic sulfur bacteria do not evolve oxygen.
Instead, they deposit elemental sulfur according to the
following equation:
CO2 + 2H2S →(CH2O) + 2S + H2O
(7.3)
The reaction in equation 7.3 can also be written as two
partial reactions:
2H2S →4e−+ 4H+ + 2S
(7.4)
CO2 + 4e−+ 4H+ →(CH2O) + H2O
(7.5)
Equations 7.4 and 7.5 describe photosynthesis in the
purple sulfur bacteria as a straightforward oxidation–
reduction reaction. C. B. van Niel adopted a com-
parative biochemistry approach and argued that the
mechanisms
for
oxygenic
(i.e.,
oxygen-evolving)
photosynthesis in green plants and anoxygenic (i.e.,
non-oxygen-evolving) photosynthesis in the sulfur bac-
teria both followed the general plan:
2H2A + CO2 →2A + (CH2O) + H2O
(7.6)
In this equation, A can represent either oxygen or sulfur,
depending on the type of photosynthetic organism.
According to equation 7.6, the O2 released in oxygenic
photosynthesis would be derived from the reductant,
water. Correct stoichiometry would therefore require
the participation of four electrons and hence two
molecules of water.
A second important clue was provided by R. Hill
who, in 1939, was ﬁrst to demonstrate the partial
reactions of photosynthesis in isolated chloroplasts. In
Hill’s experiments with chloroplasts, artiﬁcial electron
acceptors, such as ferricyanide, were used. Under these
conditions, no CO2 was consumed and no carbohydrate
was produced, but light-driven reduction of the electron
acceptors was accompanied by O2 evolution:
4Fe3+ + 2H2O →4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H+
(7.7)
Hill’s experiments conﬁrmed the redox nature of green
plant photosynthesis and added further support for the
argument that water was the source of evolved oxy-
gen. Direct evidence for the latter point was ﬁnally
provided by S. Ruben and M. Kamen in the early
1940s. Using either CO2 or H2O labeled with 18O, a
heavy isotope of oxygen, they showed that the label
appeared in the evolved oxygen only when supplied
as water (H218O), not when supplied as C18O2. If the
evolved O2 is derived from water, then two molecules of
water must participate in the reduction of each molecule
of CO2.
Based on these results, photosynthesis can be viewed
as a photochemical reduction of CO2. The energy of light
is used to generate strong reducing equivalents from
H2O—strong enough to reduce CO2 to carbohydrate.
These reducing equivalents are in the form of reduced
NADP+ (or, NADPH + H+). Additional energy for
carbon reduction is required in the form of ATP, which
is also generated at the expense of light. The principal
function of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis
is therefore to generate the NADPH and ATP required for
carbon reduction. This is accomplished through a series of
reactions that constitute the photosynthetic electron
transport chain.

BOX 7.1
HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE—THE
DISCOVERY OF
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Photosynthesis assumes a role of such dominant propor-
tions in the organization and development of plants, not
to mention feeding world populations, it is somewhat
surprising that so little was known about the process
before the ﬁnal decades of the eighteenth century. The
practice of agriculture was already several thousand
years old and practical discussions of crop production
had been written at least 2,000 years before. The origins
of plant nutrition as a science can be traced as far back
as Aristotle and other Greek philosophers, who taught
that plants absorbed organic material directly from the
soil. This theory, known as the humus theory, prevailed
in agricultural circles until the late nineteenth century,
long after the principles of photosynthesis had been
established.
The ﬁrst suggestions of photosynthesis appear in
the writings of Stephen Hales, an English clergyman
and naturalist who is considered ‘‘the father of plant
physiology.’’ In 1727, Hales surmised that plants obtain
a portion of their nutrition from the air and wondered,
as well, whether light might also be involved. Hales’s
insights were remarkably prescient, contrary as they
were to the long-established humus theory. However,
chemistry had yet to come of age as a science and Hales’s
ideas were not provable by experiment or by reference
to any well-established chemical laws.
Rabinowitch and Govindjee (1969) date the ‘‘dis-
covery’’ of photosynthesis as 1776, the year Joseph
Priestly published his two-volume work entitled Exper-
iments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. But
as with many other phenomena in science, there was
no one moment of discovery. The story gradually fell
into place through the cumulative efforts of several
clergy, physicians, and chemists over a period of nearly
75 years. J. Priestly (1733–1804) was an English minis-
ter whose nonconformist views on religion and politics
led to his emigration to the United States in 1794. He
was also a scientist engaged in pioneering experiments
with gases and is perhaps best known for his discov-
ery of oxygen. Priestly’s experiments, begun in 1771
and ﬁrst published in 1772, led him to observe that air
‘‘contaminated’’ by burning a candle could not support
the life of a mouse. He then found that the air could
be restored by plants—a sprig of mint was introduced
into the contaminated air and ‘‘after eight or nine days I
found that a mouse lived perfectly in that part of the air
in which the sprig of mint had grown’’ (Priestly, 1772).
Priestly failed to recognize the role of light in his
experiments and it was perhaps serendipitous that his
laboratory was well enough lighted for the experiments
to have succeeded at all. In 1773, Priestly’s experiments
came to the attention of Jan Ingen-Housz (1730–1799),
a physician to the court of Austrian Empress Maria
Theresa. During a visit to London, Ingen-Housz heard
Priestly’s experiments described by the President of the
Royal Society. He was intrigued by these experiments
and six years later returned to England to conduct exper-
iments. In the course of a single summer, Ingen-Housz
performed and had published some 500 experiments on
the puriﬁcation of air! He observed that plants could
purify air within hours, not days as observed by Priestly,
but only when the green parts of plants were exposed
to sunlight. Together, Priestly and Ingen-Housz had
conﬁrmed Hales’s guesses made some 52 years earlier.
Although Priestly continued his experiments—in
1781 he agreed with Ingen-Housz on the value of
light and green plant parts—neither Priestly nor
Ingen-Housz recognized the role of ‘‘ﬁxed air,’’ as CO2
was known at the time. This was left to the Swiss pastor
and librarian Jean Senebier (1742–1809). In 1782,
Senebier published a three-volume treatise in which he
demonstrated that the puriﬁcation of air by green plants
in the light was dependent on the presence of ‘‘ﬁxed’’
air. It is interesting to note that all three scientists
had emphasized the puriﬁcation of air in relation to
its capacity to support animal life—plant nutrition
was not a central theme. At the same time chemists
across Europe, including Priestly in England, Scheele
in Germany, and Lavoisier in France, were actively
investigating the chemical and physical properties of
gases. By 1785 Lavoisier had identiﬁed ‘‘ﬁxed’’ air as
CO2 and by 1796 Ingen-Housz had correctly deduced
that CO2 was the source of carbon for plants.
Another important component in the equation of
photosynthesis was added by the work of a Geneva
chemist, N. T. de Saussure (1767–1845). It was de Saus-
sure who ﬁrst approached photosynthesis in a sound,
quantitative fashion. In his book Recherches Chimiques
sur la V´eg´etation (1804) he showed that the weight of
organic matter plus oxygen formed by photosynthesis
was substantially larger than the weight of CO2 con-
sumed. He thus concluded that the additional weight
was provided by water as a reactant. The equation for
photosynthesis, using the new language of chemistry
founded by Lavoisier, could now be written:
CO2 + H2O →O2 + organic matter
Finally, it remained for a German surgeon, Julius
Mayer (1814–1878), to clarify the energy relationships
of photosynthesis. In 1845, he correctly deduced, for
the ﬁrst time, that the energy used by plants and animals

114

in their metabolism is derived from the energy of the sun
and that it is transformed by photosynthesis from the
radiant to the chemical form. Thus by the middle of the
nineteenth century the general outline of photosynthesis
was complete. Despite the importance of the process,
however, it would be almost another century before
the structural and chemical details of photosynthesis
would yield to modern methods of microscopic and
radiochemical analysis.

7.3 PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ELECTRON TRANSPORT
7.3.1 PHOTOSYSTEMS ARE MAJOR
COMPONENTS OF THE
PHOTOSYNTHETIC ELECTRON
TRANSPORT CHAIN
The key to the photosynthetic electron transport
chain is the presence of two large, multimolecular,
pigment-protein complexes known as photosystem I
(PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) (Figure 7.3) PSI
consists of 18 distinct subunits whereas PSII consists of
31 individual subunits! These two photosystems operate
in series linked by a third multiprotein aggregate called
the cytochrome complex. Overall, the effect of the
chain is to extract low-energy electrons from water
and, using light energy trapped by chlorophyll, raise
the energy level of those electrons to produce a strong
reductant NADPH (see Box 7.2: The Case for Two
Photosystems).
The composition, organization, and function of
the photosynthetic electron transport chain have been
an area of active study and rapid progress in recent
years. This interest has led to the development of a
variety of experimental methods for the study of PSI,
PSII, and other large-membrane protein aggregates.
Most signiﬁcant among these are techniques for the
removal of the complexes from the thylakoid mem-
branes by ﬁrst solubilizing the membrane with a range

of detergents. The different photosystems or classes of
molecular aggregates can then be separated from each
other by centrifugation. If the detergents and the con-
ditions under which the treatments are carried out are
carefully selected, not only can complexes be isolated but
also individual complexes can be further subdivided into
smaller aggregates that retain varying parts of the overall
activity. These puriﬁed complexes or subunits may then
be analyzed for their composition with respect to pig-
ments, protein, or other components or assayed for their
capacity to carry out speciﬁc photochemical or electron
transport reactions. Most recently this approach has led
to the crystallization of PSII and PSI reaction centers.
By exposing these crystals to X-rays and analyzing the
resulting diffraction patterns, scientists have been able
to determine the precise three-dimensional location of
all the pigment molecules and redox components of PSI
and PSII reaction centers. The Nobel Prize in chem-
istry was awarded to Diesenhoffer, Michel, and Huber
in 1987 for the ﬁrst successful crystallization and X-ray
diffraction of bacterial reaction centers. This represents
the second Nobel Prize given for research in photosyn-
thesis. See Chapter 8 for research that led to the ﬁrst
Nobel Prize in photosynthesis.

with speciﬁc proteins forms a number of different
chlorophyll-protein (CP) complexes, which can be
separated by gel electrophoresis and identiﬁed on the
basis of their molecular mass and absorption spectrum
(Figure 7.5). The core antenna for photosystem II, for
example, consists of two chlorophyll-proteins (CP)
known as CP43 and CP47 (Figure 7.6). These two CP
complexes each contain 20 to 25 molecules of chloro-
phyll a. The core antenna chlorophyll a absorb light but
do not participate directly in photochemical reactions.
However, protein-bound antenna chlorophylls lie very
close together such that excitation energy can easily
pass between adjacent pigment molecules by inductive
resonance or radiationless energy transfer (Chapter 6).
The energy of absorbed photons thus migrates through
the antenna complex, passing from one chlorophyll
molecule to another until it eventually arrives at the
reaction center (Figure 7.4).
Each reaction center consists of a unique chloro-
phyll a molecule that is thought to be present as a
dimer. This reaction center chlorophyll plus associ-
ated proteins and redox carriers are directly involved
in light-driven redox reactions. The reaction center
chlorophyll is, in effect, an energy sink—it is the
longest-wavelength, thus the lowest-energy-absorbing
chlorophyll in the complex. Because the reaction center
chlorophyll a is the site of the primary photochemical
redox reaction, it is here that light energy is actu-
ally converted to chemical energy. The reaction center
chlorophyll a of PSI and PSII are designated as P700
and P680, respectively. These designations identify the
reaction center chlorophyll a, or pigment (P), with an
absorbance maximum at either 700 nm (PSI) or 680 nm
(PSII).

FIGURE 7.5 Separation of thylakoid chlorophyll-protein
complexes by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis. (A) In the presence of speciﬁc deter-
gents, chlorophyll-protein complexes are removed
from thylakoid membranes structurally and function-
ally intact. These pigment-protein-detergent complexes
are charged and thus will migrate when an electric
ﬁeld is applied. The porous matrix through which the
electric ﬁeld is applied is a polyacrylamide gel. Thus,
the physical separation of protein complexes through
a polyacrylamide gel matrix by applying an electric
ﬁeld is called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since
these protein complexes still have chlorophyll bound
to them, you can watch the chlorophyll-protein com-
plexes separate through the gel matrix according to
their molecular mass right in front of your eyes! The
largest complexes remain at the top of the gel and the
smallest complexes near the bottom of the gel. The
illustration shows such an electrophoretic separation
of pigment-protein complexes from thylakoid mem-
branes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the arrow indicat-
ing the direction of migration. Typically, seven ‘‘green
bands’’ can be resolved. Bands 1 through 6 are individ-
ual chlorophyll-protein complexes associated with PSI
and PSII. The band exhibiting the greatest migration
(band 7) is free pigment. (B) The relative amount repre-
sented by each green band can be quantiﬁed by scan-
ning the gel in a spectrophotometer. The peak areas
provide an estimate of the relative abundance of each
chlorophyll-protein complex. Clearly, green bands 1,
2, and 3 are the most abundant pigment-protein com-
plexes in this particular thylakoid sample. Biochemical
and spectroscopic analyses of each pigment-protein com-
plex indicates that band 1 contains chlorophyll a and
represents light harvesting complex (LHCI) associated
with the core antenna complex (CP1) of PSI. Band 2
is CP1 without its associated LCHI. Band 3 contains
chlorophyll a as well as chlorophyll b and represents the
trimeric form of the light harvesting complex (LHCII)
associated with PSII. Band 4 and 6 represent the dimeric
and monomeric forms of LHCII. Band 5 is a chlorophyll
a pigment-protein complex designated as CPa and con-
tains the core antenna of PSII (CP47, CP43) associated
with the PSII reaction center, P680.

Tightly associated with the reaction centers, P680
and P700, are core antenna complexes. CP47 and CP43
are the core antenna of PSII whereas CP1 is the core
complex of PSI (Figure 7.6). Also shown in Figure 7.6 are
two additional chlorophyll-protein complexes, depicted
in close association with PSII and PSI—light-harvesting
complex II (LHCII) and light-harvesting complex I
(LHCI), respectively. LHCII is associated with PSII
and LHCI is associated with PSI. As their names imply,
the light-harvesting complexes function as extended
antenna systems for harvesting additional light energy.
LHCI and LHCII together contain as much as 70 per-
cent of the total chloroplast pigment, including virtually
all of the chlorophyll b. LHCI is relatively small, has a
chlorophyll a/b ratio of about 4/1, and appears rather
tightly bound to the core photosystem. LHCII, on the
other hand, contains 50 to 60 percent of the total chloro-
phyll and, with a chlorophyll a/b ratio of about 1.2, most
of the chlorophyll b. LHCII also contains most of the
xanthophyll. The function of the light-harvesting com-
plexes and the core antenna are to absorb light and
transfer this energy to the reaction centers (Figure 7.4).
The principal advantage of associating a single reac-
tion center with a large number of light harvesting and
core antenna chlorophyll molecules is to increase efﬁ-
ciency in the collection and utilization of light energy.
Even in bright sunlight it is unlikely that an individ-
ual chlorophyll molecule would be struck by a photon
more than a few times every second. Since events at
the reaction center occur within a microsecond time
scale, any reaction center that depended on a single
molecule of chlorophyll for its light energy would no
doubt lie idle much of the time. Thus, the advantage
of a photosystem is that while the reaction center is
busy processing one photon, other photons are being
intercepted by the antenna molecules and funneled to
the reaction center. This increases the probability that
as soon as the reaction center is free, more excita-
tion energy is immediately available. The efﬁciency
of energy transfer through the light harvesting com-
plexes and the core antenna complexes to the reaction
is very high—only about 10 percent of the energy is
lost. Thus, it is important to appreciate that LCHI
and LHCII are not necessarily absolute requirements
for photosynthetic electron transport under light satu-
rated conditions, that is, under conditions when light
is not limiting. Rather, the light harvesting complexes
enhance photosynthetic efﬁciency under low light, that
is, under conditions where light limits photosynthesis.
In fact, photosynthetic organisms modulate the struc-
ture and function of the light harvesting complexes in
response to changes irradiance. This will be discussed
in more detail in Chapter 14. In addition, LHCII has
an important role in the dynamic regulation of energy
distribution between the photosystems which will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter 13.
A schematic of the photosynthetic electron trans-
port chain depicting the arrangement of PSI, PSII, and
the cytochrome b6/f complex in the thylakoid mem-
brane is presented in Figure 7.6. A fourth complex—the
CF0-CF1 coupling factor or ATP synthase—is also
shown. All four complexes are membrane-spanning,
integral membrane proteins with a substantial portion
of their structure buried in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer.
Note that the orientation of the complex and their indi-
vidual constituents is not random—speciﬁc polypeptide
regions will be oriented toward the stroma or lumen
respectively. Such a vectorial arrangement of proteins

is characteristic of all energy-transducing membranes, if
not all membrane proteins, and is an essential element of
their capacity to conserve energy through chemiosmosis
(Chapter 5). One particularly signiﬁcant consequence of
this arrangement is the directed movement of protons
between the stroma and the thylakoid lumen as shown in
Figure 7.6. Although PQ reduction and its concomitant
protonation occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoid
membrane, the oxidation of PQH2 by the cytochrome
b6/f complex (Cyt b6/f ) requires the diffusion of PQH2
from the stromal side to the lumen side of the thylakoid
membrane. It is this arrangement that gives rise to
the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis. This
aspect of the electron transport chain will be revisited
later. Another consequence of the vectorial arrangement
is that the oxidation of water and reduction of NADP+
occur on opposite sides of the thylakoid membrane.
Water is oxidized and protons accumulate on the lumen
side of the membrane where they contribute to the
gradient, which drives ATP synthesis. However, both
NADPH and ATP are produced in the stroma where
they are used in the carbon reduction cycle (Chapter 8)
or other chloroplast activities (Chapter 11).
7.3.2 PHOTOSYSTEM II OXIDIZES
WATER TO PRODUCE OXYGEN
Electron transport actually begins with the arrival of
excitation energy at the photosystem II reaction center
chlorophyll, P680, which is located near the lumenal
side of the reaction center. As illustrated in Figure 7.7,
this excitation energy is required to change the redox
potential of P680 from +0.8 eV to about −0.4 eV for
P680*, the excited form of P680. As a consequence of
this initial endergonic excitation process, P680* can
rapidly (within picoseconds, 10−12 s) transfer elec-
trons exergonically to pheophytin (Pheo). Pheophytin,
considered the primary electron acceptor in PSII, is
a form of chlorophyll a in which the magnesium ion
has been replaced by two hydrogens. Since this initial
oxidation of P680 is light dependent, this is called a
photooxidation event, which results in the formation
of P680+ and Pheo−, a charge separation. Note that
the energy of one photon results in the release of one
electron, which is consistent with the Einstein-Stokes
law (Chapter 6). This charge separation effectively stores
light energy as redox potential energy and represents the
actual conversion of light energy to chemical energy. It
is essential that this charge separation be stabilized by
the rapid movement of the electron from P680 at the
lumen side of the PSII reaction center to an electron
acceptor molecule localized at the stromal side of the
PSII reaction center (see discussion below). If the elec-
tron were permitted to recombine with P680+, there
would be no forward movement of electrons, the energy
would be wasted, and ultimately, carbon could not be
reduced.
The role of the reaction proteins, D1 and D2, is
to bind and to orient speciﬁc redox carriers of the PSII
reaction center in such a way as to decrease the prob-
ability of charge recombination between P680+ and
Pheo−. How does this happen? First, within picosec-
onds, pheophytin passes one electron on to a quinone
electron acceptor called QA, resulting in the formation
of [P680+ Pheo Q−
A]. Now the PSII reaction center
is considered to be ‘‘closed,’’ that is, it is unable to
undergo another photo-oxidation event (Figure 7.8).
On a slower time scale of microseconds, the electron
is passed from QA to plastoquinone(PQ), resulting in
the formation of [P680+ Pheo QA]. PQ is a quinone
(see Figure 5.3C) that binds transiently to a binding
site (QB) that is on the stromal side of the D1 reac-
tion center protein (Figure 7.6). The reduction of PQ
to plastoquinol (PQH2) decreases its afﬁnity for the

The downhill transfer of electrons between
P680* and P700 represents a negative free

binding site on the D1 polypeptide. The plastoquinol is
thus released from the reaction center, to be replaced
by another molecule of PQ. PQH2 diffuses from the
QB site and becomes part of the PQ pool present in the
thylakoid membrane. Since PQ requires two electrons
to become fully reduced to PQH2, reduction at the QB
site is considered a two-electron gate (Figure 7.8).
Second, the initial charge separation is further sta-
bilized because P680+ is a very strong oxidant (perhaps
the strongest known in biological systems) and is able to
‘‘extract’’ electrons from water. Thus P680+ is rapidly
reduced, again within picoseconds, to P680, resulting
in the formation of [P680 Pheo QA]. Now the PSII
reaction center is said to be ‘‘open,’’ that is, it is ready
to receive another excitation (Figure 7.8). On a bright,
sunny summer day, the photon ﬂux to which a leaf can
be exposed may reach 2000 μmol photons m−2 s−1. This

The PSII reaction center polypeptides, D1 and D2, bind
the following redox components irreversibly: P680, the
reaction chlorophyll a; pheophytin (Pheo) and QA, the
ﬁrst stable quinone electron acceptor of PSII reaction
centers. The transfer of absorbed light energy to ‘‘open’’
PSII reaction centers causes the photooxidation of P680
and converts it P680+. Subsequently, the electron lost by
P680 is transferred very rapidly ﬁrst to Pheo and then to
convert it to Q−
A. This results in a stable charge separa-
tion [P680+ Pheo Q−
A]. The PSII reaction is now said to
be ‘‘closed,’’ that is, the PSII reaction center cannot be
photooxidized since P680 is already photooxidized. Exci-
tation of a ‘‘closed’’ reaction center results in irreversible
damage. Conversion of a ‘‘closed’’ PSII reaction center
to an ‘‘open’’ PSII reaction center requires the concomi-
tant reduction of P680+ through the oxidation of water
and the transfer of the electron from Q−
A to plastoquinone
(PQ) bound to the QB site on the D1 polypeptide of PSII.
Upon the complete reduction, plastoquinone is proto-
nated to form plastoquinol (PQH2) and released from
the QB site and subsequently reduces the Cyt b6/f com-
plex. The scheme illustrated is balanced for 4 excitations
and for the evolution of one molecule of O2. Note that
the absorption of one photon causes the photooxidation
of one P680.
means that about 1019 charge separations per second
may occur over a leaf surface area of 1 cm2!
The electrons that reduce P680+ are most imme-
diately supplied by a cluster of four manganese ions as-
sociated with a small complex of proteins called the
oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). As the name im-
plies, the OEC is responsible for the splitting (oxidation)
of water and the consequent evolution of molecular
oxygen. The OEC is located on the lumen side of the
thylakoid membrane. The OEC is bound to the D1 and
D2 proteins of the PSII reaction center and functions
to stabilize the manganese cluster. It also binds Cl−
which is necessary for the water-splitting function.
2H2O ⇀O2 + 4H+ + 4e
(7.8)
According to equation 7.8, the oxidation of two
moles of water generates one mole of oxygen, four
moles of protons, and four moles of electrons. It has
been determined that only one PSII reaction center
and OEC is involved in the release of a single oxygen
molecule. Thus, in order to complete the oxidation of
two water molecules, expel four protons, and produce
a single molecule of O2, the PSII reaction center must
be ‘‘closed’’ and then ‘‘opened’’ four times (Figure 7.8).
This means that PSII must utilize the energy of four pho-
tons in order to evolve one molecule of O2. Experiments
in which electron transport was driven by extremely
short ﬂashes of light—short enough to excite essentially
one electron at a time—have demonstrated that the
OEC has the capacity to store charges. Each excitation
of P680 is followed by withdrawal of one electron from
the manganese cluster, which stores the residual positive
charge. When four positive charges have accumulated,
the complex oxidizes two molecules of water and releases
the product oxygen molecule. As a consequence, organ-
isms containing PSII and the OEC exhibit oxygenic
photosynthesis, that is, a photosynthetic process that
generates molecular oxygen (O2).
However, not all photosynthetic organisms are oxy-
genic. Photosynthetic bacteria are anoxygenic, that is,
photosynthesis in these prokaryotes does not generate
molecular O2. Why is this? First, photosynthetic purple
bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Rhodobacter
sphaeroides contain only one reaction center, the special-
ized bacterial reaction center, rather than two reaction
centers found in chloroplasts of plants and green algae.
Second, the bacterial reaction center contains the bac-
teriochlorophyll a, P870, rather than P680. Excitation
of P870 does not generate a sufﬁciently positive redox
potential to oxidize water. Thus, these bacteria can not
use water as a source of electrons to reduce P870+
but rather utilize a variety of other electron donors
(see equations 7.4 and 7.5) such as hydrogen sulﬁde
(H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2). As a consequence
these photosynthetic bacteria are restricted to environ-
ments which speciﬁcally contain either H2S or H2 as

7.3 Photosynthetic Electron Transport
119
a source of reducing power. Since water is generally
very abundant in our biosphere, the evolution of PSII
allowed oxygenic photosynthetic organisms to survive
and reproduce almost anywhere in our biosphere. Thus,
the evolution of PSII and its associated OEC was a major
factor determining the global distribution of oxygenic
photosynthetic organisms that fundamentally changed
the development of all life on Earth.
7.3.3 THE CYTOCHROME COMPLEX
AND PHOTOSYSTEM I OXIDIZE
PLASTOQUINOL
Following its release from PSII, plastoquinol diffuses
laterally through the membrane until it encounters a
cytochrome b6f complex (Figure 7.6). This is another
multiprotein,
membrane-spanning
redox
complex
whose principal constituents are cytochrome b6 (Cyt b6)
and cytochrome f (Cyt f ). The cytochrome complex
also contains an additional redox component called
the Rieske iron-sulfur (FeS) protein—iron-binding
proteins in which the iron complexes with sulfur
residues rather than a heme group as in the case of the
cytochromes. Plastoquinol diffuses within the plane of
the thylakoid membrane and passes its electrons ﬁrst to
the FeS protein and then to Cyt f . Since the oxidation
of plastoquinol is thought to be diffusion limited, this
is the slowest step in photosynthetic electron transport
and occurs on a time scale of milliseconds (ms). The
Rieske FeS protein and the heme of Cyt f are located
on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. From
Cyt f , the electrons are picked up by a copper-binding
protein, plastocyanin (PC). PC is a small peripheral
protein that is able to diffuse freely along the lumenal
surface of the thylakoid membrane.
In the meantime, a light-driven charge separation
similar to that involving P680 has also occurred in
the reaction center of PSI. Excitation energy trans-
ferred to the reaction center chlorophyll of PSI (P700)
is used to change the redox potential of P700 from
about +0.4 eV to about −0.6 eV for P700*, the excited
form of P700 (Figure 7.7). As a consequence of this
initial endergonic excitation, P700* is rapidly photoox-
idized to P700+ by the primary electron acceptor (A)
in PSI, a molecule of chlorophyll a (Figure 7.6); the
electron is then passed through a quinone and addi-
tional FeS centers and ﬁnally, on the stroma side of
the membrane, to ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is another
FeS-protein that is soluble in the stroma. Ferredoxin
in turn is used to reduce NADP+, a reaction mediated
by the enzyme ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase.
Finally, the electron deﬁciency in P700+ is satisﬁed by
withdrawing an electron from reduced PC (Figure 7.6).
The overall effect of the complete electron trans-
port scheme is to establish a continuous ﬂow of electrons
between water and NADP+, passing through the two
separate photosystems and the intervening cytochrome
complex (Figure 7.6). The bioenergetics of this process
are illustrated in Figure 7.7. In the overall process,
electrons are removed from water, a very weak reductant
(Em = 0.82 V ), and elevated to the energy level of
ferredoxin, a very strong reductant (Em = −0.42 V).
Ferredoxin in turn reduces NADP+
to NADPH
(Em = −0.32 V). NADPH, also a strong reductant, is
a water-soluble, mobile electron carrier that diffuses
freely through the stroma where it is used to reduce CO2
in the carbon reduction cycle (Chapter 8). Since two
excitations—at PSII and PSI—are required for each
electron moved through the entire chain, a substantial
amount of energy is put into the system. Based on one
680 nm photon (175 kJ per mol quanta) and one 700 nm
photon (171 kJ per mol quanta), 692 kJ are used to excite
each mole pair of electrons [2 × (175 + 171)]. Only
about 32 percent of that energy is conserved in NADPH
(218 kJ mol−1).
What happens to the other 68 percent of the energy?
An additional portion of the redox free energy of elec-
tron transport energy is conserved as ATP. This occurs
in part because transfer of electrons between PSII and
PSI is energetically downhill—that is, it is accompanied
by a negative G (Figure 7.7). In the process of moving
electrons between plastoquinone and the cytochrome
complex, some of that energy is used to move protons
from the stroma side of the membrane to the lumen
side. These protons contribute to a proton gradient that
can be used to drive ATP synthesis by chemiosmosis
(Chapter 5).
The quantum requirement for oxygen evolution
is deﬁned as the number photons required to evolve
one molecule of O2. As discussed above, two excitations,
one at PSII and one at PSI, are required to move
each electron through noncyclic electron transport from
H2O to NADP+. From equation 7.8, the evolution of
one molecule of O2 by P680+ generates four electrons
that are eventually transferred through PSI to reduce
2NADP+ to 2NADPH. Thus, to transfer four electrons
from H2O to NADP+ requires 8 photons. Therefore
the minimal theoretical quantum requirement for O2
evolution is 8 photons/molecule of O2 evolved.
Conversely, quantum yield of oxygen evolution
is the inverse of quantum requirement, that is, num-
ber of molecules of O2 evolved per photon absorbed.
Since this is also the deﬁnition of photosynthetic efﬁ-
ciency, the terms quantum yield and photosynthetic
efﬁciency are interchangeable. Consequently, the maxi-
mum theoretical quantum yield for oxygen evolution or
photosynthetic efﬁciency of O2 evolution must be 1/8 or
0.125 molecules of O2 evolved/photon absorbed. Pho-
tosynthetic efﬁciency or quantum yield for O2 evolution
will vary depending on the environmental conditions to
which a plant is exposed. This will be discussed in more
detail in Chapters 13 and 14.

Chapter 7 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: Harvesting Sunlight
7.4 PHOTOPHOSPHORYLATION
IS THE LIGHT-DEPENDENT
SYNTHESIS OF ATP
In Chapter 5, we examined the bioenergetics of the light-
dependent synthesis of ATP. However, by deﬁnition,
thermodynamics does not provide speciﬁc information
with respect to kinetics and biochemical mechanism.
Here we discuss the molecular basis underlying the
chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP in chloroplasts.
The ATP required for carbon reduction and other
metabolic activities of the chloroplast is synthesized
by photophosphorylation in accordance with Mitchell’s
chemiosmotic mechanism (Chapter 5). Light-driven
production of ATP by chloroplasts is known as photo
phosphorylation. Photophosphorylation is very impor-
tant because, in addition to using ATP (along with
NADPH) for the reduction of CO2, a continual supply
of ATP is required to support a variety of other meta-
bolic activities in the chloroplast. These activities in-
clude amino acid, fatty acid, and starch biosynthesis,
the synthesis of proteins in the stroma, and the trans-
port of proteins and metabolites across the envelope
membranes.
When electron transport is operating according
to the scheme shown in Figures 7.6 and 7.7, electrons
are continuously supplied from water and withdrawn as
NADPH. This ﬂow-through form of electron transport
is consequently known as either noncyclic or linear
electron transport. Formation of ATP in association
with noncyclic electron transport is known as noncyclic
photophosphorylation. However, as will be shown
later, PSI units and PSII units in the membrane are not
physically linked as implied by the Z scheme, but are
even segregated into different regions of the thylakoid.
One consequence of this heterogeneous distribution in
the membranes is that PSI units may transport electrons
independently of PSII, a process known as cyclic
electron transport. In terrestrial plants, the major
pathway for PSI cyclic electron transport is thought to
occur via P700 to ferredoxin (fd) which transfers the
electrons back to PQ via a recently discovered protein,
PGR5 rather than to NADP+. The electron then
returns to P700+, passing through the cytochrome b6/f
complex and plastocyanin. Using a genetic approach in
Arabidopsis thaliana, the gene, PGR5, was shown to
encode a small thylakoid polypeptide that is essential for
PSI cyclic electron transport (Figure 7.9). However, the
precise role of PGR5 in the electron transfer process
has yet to be elucidated. Since these electrons also pass
through PQ and the cytochrome complex, cyclic elec-
tron transport will also contribute to the establishment
of the pH gradient required to support ATP synthesis,
a process known as cyclic photophosphorylation. It is
thought that cyclic photophosphorylation is a source of
ATP required for chloroplast activities over and above
that required in the carbon-reduction cycle. Since non-
cyclic photophosphorylation results in the production
of both ATP and NADPH whereas cyclic photophos-
phorylation does not generate NADPH, switching
between cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation
also represents a mechanism by which the chloroplast
can regulate the stromal ATP/NADPH ratios, which is
important in the maintenance of chloroplast metabolic
activity.
A key to energy conservation in photosynthetic elec-
tron transport and the accompanying production of ATP
is the light-driven accumulation of protons in the lumen.
There are two principal mechanisms that account for
this accumulation of protons: the oxidation of water, in
which two protons are deposited into the lumen for each
FIGURE 7.9 Cyclic electron trans-
port. PSI units operating indepen-
dently of PSII may return elec-
trons from P700 through ferre-
doxin (fd), and PGR5 to the thy-
lakoid plastoquinone (PQ) pool
and the cytochrome b6/f complex.
In cyclic electron transport, the
oxidation of PQ by the cytochrome
b6/f complex generates a proton
gradient that can be used for ATP
synthesis but no NADPH is pro-
duced.

7.4 Photophosphorylation is the Light-Dependent Synthesis of ATP

water molecule oxidized, and a PQ-cytochrome proton
pump. The energy of the resulting proton gradient is
then used to drive ATP synthesis in accordance with
Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis (Chapter 5).
The precise mechanism by which protons are moved
across the membrane by the cytochrome complex is not
yet understood, although several models have been pro-
posed. The most widely accepted model is known as
the Q-cycle, based on an original proposal by Mitchell.
A simpliﬁed version of the Q-cycle during steady-state
operation is shown in Figure 7.10. When PQ is reduced
by PSII, it binds temporarily to the D1 protein (QB)
as a semiquinone after it accepts the ﬁrst electron from
QA. Subsequently, the QB semiquinone is converted
to the fully reduced plastoquinol (PQH2) after it has
accepted another electron from QA, plus two protons
are picked up from the surrounding stroma. PQH2
dissociates from the PSII complex and diffuses lat-
erally through the membrane until it encounters the
lumenal PQH2 binding site of the cytochrome b6/f
complex. There, two PQH2 bind sequentially and are
reoxidized to PQ through a semiquinone intermedi-
ate (PQHz, not shown) by the combined action of
the Rieske FeS-protein and the low reduction potential
form of cytochrome b6 (LP). Concomitantly, 4 H+ are
transferred to the lumen. One of the PQ molecules
returns to the thylakoid PQ pool to be reduced again by
PSII, while the other PQ molecule is transferred to the

trons that passes through the electron transport chain. Fe, Rieske FeS-center; Cyt f ,

where it becomes reduced by the high reduction poten-
tial form of cytochrome b6 (HP) and is protonated using
2 H+ from the stroma. This PQH2 molecule is then
released from the stromal binding site and recycled into
the thylakoid PQH2 pool.
Thus, for each pair of electrons passing from plasto-
quinone through the Rieske FeS-center and cytochrome
f to plastocyanin, four protons are translocated from the
stroma into the lumen of the thylakoid. If this scheme
is correct, then each pair of electrons passing through
noncyclic electron transport from water to NADP+
contributes six protons to the gradient—four from the
Q-cycle (Equation 7.9) plus two from water oxidation
(Equation 7.10).

For cyclic electron transport, the number of protons
transferred per pair of electrons would be four.
Since it is generally agreed that three protons
must be transported through the CF0-CF1 for each
ATP synthesized (3H+/ATP), a pair of electrons pass-
ing through noncyclic electron transport would be
expected to yield two ATP molecules for every NADPH

produced (2ATP/NADPH). The precise stoichiometry,
however, is difﬁcult to determine, in part because of
uncertainty with regard to the relative proportions of
cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation occurring at
any speciﬁc moment in time.
According to the chemiosmotic theory,
pmf = −59pH + 
(7.11)
As protons accumulate in the lumen relative to the
stroma, divalent magnesium ions (Mg2+) released from
the thylakoid membrane accumulate in the chloro-
plast stroma. This minimizes the difference in electrical
charge between the stroma and the lumen. Thus, in
chloroplasts, the pH (i.e., the H+ concentration gradi-
ent) is the major factor that contributes to chloroplastic
pmf, whereas  contributes minimally.
7.5 LATERAL HETEROGENEITY
IS THE UNEQUAL
DISTRIBUTION OF
THYLAKOID COMPLEXES
In addition to the vectorial arrangement of electron
transport
components
across
the
membrane
that
accounts for the simultaneous electron transfer within
the thylakoid membrane and active transport of protons
from the stroma to the lumen, there is also a distinct
lateral heterogeneity with respect to their distribution
of the major protein complexes within the thylakoids
(Figure 7.11). The result is that PSI and PSII, for
example, are spatially segregated, rather than arranged
as some kind of supercomplex that might be suggested
by the static representation in the previous ﬁgures.
The PSI/LHCI complexes and the CF0-CF1 ATPase
are located exclusively in nonappressed regions of the
thylakoid; that is, those regions where the membranes
are not paired to form grana. These regions include
the stroma thylakoids, the margins of the grana stacks,
and membranes at either end of the grana stacks,
all of which are in direct contact with the stroma
(Figure 7.11A). Virtually all of the PSII complexes and
LHCII, on the other hand, are located in the appressed
regions of the grana membranes (Figure 7.11B). The
cytochrome b6/f complexes are uniformly distributed
throughout both regions.
Spatial segregation also requires that the electron
transport complexes be linked with each other through
one or more mobile carriers that can deliver electrons
between complexes. These carriers are plastoquinone
(PQ), plastocyanin (PC), and ferredoxin. All three are
mobile carriers that are not permanently part of any elec-
tron transport complex. Plastoquinone is a hydrophobic
molecule and is consequently free to diffuse laterally
within the lipid matrix of the thylakoid membrane. Its
estimated diffusion coefﬁcient is 106 cm−2 s−1, which
means that it could travel more than the diameter of
a typical granum in less than one millisecond. The

lateral mobility of PQ allows it to carry electrons
between PSII and the cytochrome complex. Plasto-
cyanin is a small (10.5 kDa) peripheral copper-protein
found on the lumenal side of the membrane. It read-
ily diffuses along the lumenal surface of the membrane
and carries electrons between the cytochrome complex
and PSI. Ferredoxin, a small (9 kDa) iron-sulfur pro-
tein, is found on the stroma side of the membrane. It
receives electrons from PSI and, with the assistance of
the ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase, reduces NADP+
to NADPH.
An unequal number and spatial segregation of
PSI and PSII means that both cyclic and noncyclic
photophosphorylation can occur more or less simulta-
neously. Thus the output of ATP and NADPH can be
adjusted to meet the demands not only of photosynthe-
sis but of other biosynthetic energy requirements within
the chloroplast (see Chapter 8).
Are granal stacks required for oxygenic photosyn-
thesis? The unequivocal answer to this question is no.
Contrary to the illusion created by a transmission elec-
tron micrograph of a chloroplast (see Figure 5.4), the
stacking of thylakoid membranes into grana is not static
but very dynamic. If granal stacks are not required for
oxygenic photosynthesis, what regulates their forma-
tion and why do they occur in most chloroplasts? First,

7.6 Cyanobacteria are Oxygenic
123
in vitro experiments with isolated thylakoids showed
that decreasing the concentration of monovalent cations
such as K+ and Mg2+, respectively, in the surrounding
thylakoid isolation buffer decreases stacking and results
in the homogeneous distribution of the photosynthetic
electron protein complexes within the thylakoid mem-
brane. This is reversible upon the re-addition of these
cations which induces stacking of the thylakoids and
the reestablishment of lateral heterogeneity. Later, it
was established that the N-terminal domain of the
major LHCII polypeptides mediated the stacking pro-
cess. Wild type barley chloroplasts exhibit typical granal
stacks whereas the chloroplasts of the chlorina f2 mutant
of barley, which lacks both chlorophyll b and the major
LHCII polypeptides, does not exhibit granal stacks.
Proteolytic cleavage of this N-terminal domain of the
major LHCII polypeptides also inhibited granal stack-
ing. It was concluded that the presence of cations shields
the negative surface charges created by the exposed
N-terminal domains of the major LHCII polypeptides
present thylakoid membranes. Thus, unstacking of thy-
lakoid membranes is the result of electrostatic repulsion
of the negative surface charges on thylakoid membranes.
The possible functions of this remarkable process are
still not completely understood. We will return to this
subject in Chapter 13 when we discuss the regulation of
energy distribution between PSII and PSI.

vesting pigment-protein complex found in chloroplast
thylakoid membranes of plants and green algae, the
light harvesting complex of cyanobacteria is an extrinsic
pigment-protein
complex
called
a
phycobilisome
which is bound to the outer, cytoplasmic surface of
cyanobacterial thylakoids (Figure 7.12B). Phycobili-
somes (PBSs) are rod-shaped chromoproteins called
phycobiliproteins which may constitute up to 40 percent
of the total cellular protein. The phycobiliproteins
usually associated with PBS include allophycocyanin
(AP), phycocyanin (PC), and phycoerythrin (PE). In
addition to PBS, PSII of cyanobacteria include the Chl
a core antenna CP47 and CP43 similar to that found
in eukaryotic organisms. Cyanobacteria are distinct
from chloroplasts because the redox carriers involved in
respiratory as well as photosynthetic electron transport
are located in the cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes
where they share a common PQ pool and a common
Cyt b6f complex. Because PBSs are large, extrinsic
pigment-protein complexes, this prevents appression of
cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes and the formation
of granal stacks characteristic of eukaryotic chloroplasts.
This is further evidence that granal stacks are not a
prerequisite for oxygenic photosynthesis.
7.7 INHIBITORS OF
PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ELECTRON TRANSPORT ARE
EFFECTIVE HERBICIDES
Since the dawn of agriculture, man has waged war against
weeds. Weeds compete with crop species for water,
nutrients, and light and ultimately reduce crop yields.
Traditional methods of weed control, such as crop rota-
tion, manual hoeing, or tractor-drawn cultivators were
largely replaced in the 1940s by labor-saving chemical
weed control. Modern agriculture is almost completely
dependent upon the intensive use of herbicides.
A wide spectrum of herbicides is now available that
interfere with a variety of cell functions. Many of the
commercially more important herbicides, however, act
by interfering with photosynthetic electron transport.
Two major classes of such herbicides are derivatives
of urea, such as monuron and diuron, and the triazine
herbicides, triazine and simazine (Figure 7.13). Both
the urea and triazine herbicides are taken up by the
roots and transported to the leaves. There they bind
to the QB binding site of the D1 protein in PSII (also
known as the herbicide-binding protein). The herbicide
interferes with the binding of plastoquinone to the
same site and thus blocks the transfer of electrons to
plastoquinone. Because of its action in blocking electron
transport at this point, DCMU is commonly used in
laboratory experiments where the investigator wishes to
block electron transport between PSII and PSI.

FIGURE 7.13 The chemical structures of some common
herbicides that act by interfering with photosynthesis.
The triazine herbicides are used extensively to con-
trol weeds in cornﬁelds, since corn roots contain an
enzyme that degrades the herbicide to an inactive form.
Other plants are also resistant. Some, such as cotton,
sequester the herbicide in special glands while others
avoid taking it up by way of root systems that pene-
trate deep below the application zones. In many cases,
however, weeds have developed triazine-resistant races,
or biotypes. In several cases, the resistance has been
traced to a single amino acid substitution in the D1
protein. The change in amino acid reduces the afﬁnity
of the protein for the herbicide but does not interfere
with plastoquinone binding and, consequently, electron
transport.
The
availability
of
herbicide-resistant
genes
together
with
recombinant
DNA
technology
has
stimulated considerable interest in the prospects for
developing additional herbicide-resistant crop plants.
It is possible, for example, to transfer the gene for
the altered D1 protein into crop species and confer
resistance to triazine herbicides. This approach will
be successful, however, only if weed species do not
continue to acquire resistance to the same herbicides
through natural evolutionary change.

THE CASE
FOR TWO
PHOTOSYSTEMS
The photosynthetic unit of oxygenic photosynthetic
organisms is organized as two separate photosystems
that operate in series. While the two-step series for-
mulation, or ‘‘Z-scheme,’’ for photosynthesis is gen-
eral knowledge today, the idea generated considerable
excitement when it was ﬁrst proposed in the early 1960s.
The two-step idea was based on a series of exper-
iments conducted during the 1950s, which laid the
foundation for signiﬁcant advances in our understand-
ing of photosynthetic electron transport. The ﬁrst of
these experiments was centered around the concept of
quantum efﬁciency. Information about quantum efﬁ-
ciency is very useful when attempting to understand
photochemical processes. Quantum efﬁciency can be
expressed in two ways—either as quantum yield or as
quantum requirement. Quantum yield (φ) expresses
the efﬁciency of a process as a ratio of the yield
of product to the number of photons absorbed. In
photosynthesis, for example, product yield would be
measured as the amount of CO2 taken up or O2
evolved. Alternatively, the quantum requirement (1/φ)
(sometimes referred to as quantum number) tells how
many photons are required for every molecule of CO2
reduced or oxygen evolved. Equation 7.8 identiﬁes that
a minimum of four electrons are required for every
molecule of CO2 reduced. In Chapter 5 it was estab-
lished that one photon is required for each electron
excited.
Therefore,
the
minimum
theoretical
quantum
requirement for photosynthesis is four. However, it has
been well established experimentally that the minimum
quantum requirement for photosynthesis is eight to
ten photons for every CO2 reduced. If eight photons
are required (it is usual to assume the minimum) for
four electrons, then each electron must be excited twice!
A second line of evidence, again from the laboratory
of R. Emerson, was based on attempts to determine
the action spectra for photosynthesis in Chlorella.
Emerson and his colleague C. M. Lewis reported in
1943 that the value of φ was remarkably constant over
most of the spectrum (Emerson and Lewis, 1943).
This would indicate that any photon absorbed by
chlorophyll was more or less equally effective in driving
photosynthesis. However, there was an unexpected
drop in the quantum yield at wavelengths greater than
680 nm, even though chlorophyll still absorbed in that

range (Figure 7.14). This puzzling drop in quantum
efﬁciency in the long red portion of the spectrum was
called the red drop.
In another experiment, Emerson and his colleagues
set up two beams of light—one in the region of
650 to 680 nm and the other in the region of 700
to 720 nm. The ﬂuence rates of both beams were
adjusted to give equal rates of photosynthesis. Emerson
discovered that when the two beams were applied
simultaneously, the rate of photosynthesis was two to
three times greater than the sum of the rates obtained
with each beam separately! This phenomenon has
become known as the Emerson enhancement effect
(Figure 7.15). The enhancement effect suggests that
photosynthesis
involves
two
photochemical
events
or systems, one driven by short-wavelength light
(≤680 nm) and one driven by long-wavelength light
(>680 nm). For optimal photosynthesis to occur, both
systems must be driven simultaneously or in rapid
succession.
In an attempt to explain conﬂicting information
about the role of cytochromes and redox potential values,
R. Hill and Fay Bendall, in 1960, proposed a new
model for electron transport. The Hill and Bendall
model involved two photochemical acts operating in
series—one serving to oxidize the cytochromes and one
serving to reduce them (Figure 7.16). The following
year, L. Duysens conﬁrmed the Hill and Bendall model,
showing that cytochromes were oxidized in the presence
of long-wavelength light. The effect could be reversed
by short-wavelength light.

oxygen evolution. As a consequence, today the Z-scheme
is the prevailing paradigm for photosynthetic electron
transport in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. However,
Daniel Arnon spent part of his illustrious scientiﬁc career
challenging the Z-scheme. Supported with experimental
evidence, he maintained until his death in 1995 that PSI
and PSII could operate independently of one another
and still support CO2 assimilation. He maintained that
PSI can operate in a cyclic mode to generate ATP
and PSII could reduce NADP+ directly. Although the
reduction of NADP+ by PSII can be shown in vitro, the
quantum yield for this process appears to be very low
and this reaction has never been reported in vivo. If PSII
could reduce NADP+ directly, one would expect to see
CO2 ﬁxation in the absence of PSI. However, all exper-
iments with mutants of the green alga, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, that lack PSI indicate that these mutants
are unable to ﬁx CO2. Although the consensus is that
the Z-scheme reﬂects an accurate description of pho-
tosynthetic electron ﬂow in photosynthetic organisms
grown under optimal growth conditions, data continue
to accumulate that indicate that the Z-scheme may
not explain photosynthetic electron ﬂow during growth
under extreme conditions. For recent controversies sur-
rounding the Z-scheme see the papers by Redding and
Peltier (1998) as well as by Ivanov et al. (2000).

Another class of herbicides are the bipyridylium
viologen dyes—paraquat (Figure 7.13)—which act by
intercepting electrons on the reducing side of PSI. The
viologen dyes are auto-oxidizable, immediately reduc-
ing oxygen to superoxide. Not only do the viologen
dyes interfere with photosynthetic electron transport,
but the superoxide they produce causes additional dam-
age by rapidly inactivating chlorophyll and oxidizing
chloroplast membrane lipids. Because viologen herbi-
cides are also highly toxic to animals, their use is banned
or tightly regulated in many jurisdictions.
Chemical herbicides have become an important
management tool for modern agriculture, but their
value as a labor-saving device must be carefully weighed
against potentially harmful ecological effects. Many of
these herbicides are carcinogenic, and thus the potential
accumulation of these hazardous compounds in water
supplies continues to be a major public concern. In
addition, the overuse of herbicides promote herbicide
tolerance in weeds, which exacerbates the weed problem
in the long term.
SUMMARY
The function of the light-dependent reactions of
photosynthesis is to generate the ATP and reducing
potential (as NADPH) required for subsequent
carbon reduction. The electron transport chain in
the thylakoid membranes of oxygenic photoautrophs
is composed of two photosystems (PSI, PSII) and a
cytochrome b6f complex. The three complexes are
linked by plastoquinone and plastocyanin, mobile
carriers that freely diffuse within the plane of the mem-
brane. Each photosystem consists of a reaction center,
core antenna, and associated light-harvesting (LHC)
complexes. Light energy gathered by the antenna and
LHC is passed to the reaction center. In the reaction
center, electron ﬂow is initiated by a charge separation
(photooxidation). As a result, electrons obtained from
the oxidation of water are passed through PSII, the
cytochrome b6f complex, and PSI to NADP+. Protons
pumped across the membrane between PSII and PSI
drive photophosphorylation. The components of
the photosynthetic electron transport chain are not
distributed homogeneously throughout the thylakoid
membranes of eukaryotic chloroplasts but exhibit
lateral heterogeneity. However, lateral heterogeneity
is dynamic and is a consequence electrostatic shielding
of negative surface charges on thylakoid membranes
created by the exposed N-terminal domains of the
major LHCII polypeptides. Granal stacks are not an
absolute requirement for oxygenic photosynthesis.
Although cyanobacteria exhibit PSI, PSII and are
oxygenic, thylakoids of these prokaryotes do not
exhibit granal stacks due to the presence of extrinsic
pigment-protein complexes called phycobilisomes. In
contrast to eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and
cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria contain only
one specialized bacterial reaction center that oxidizes
H2S or H2 and is incapable of oxidizing H2O. Several
classes of economically important herbicides act by
interfering with photosynthetic electron transport.

Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis:
CO2 Assimilation
Chapter 7 showed how chloroplasts conserve light
energy by converting it to reducing potential, in the
form of NADPH and ATP. In this chapter, attention is
focused on how CO2 enters the leaf and subsequently
is reduced through the utilization of the NADPH and
ATP produced by photosynthetic electron transport. Air
is the source of CO2 for photosynthesis. Gas exchange
between the leaf and the surrounding air is depen-
dent upon diffusion and is controlled by the opening
and closing of special pores called stomata. Stomatal
movements are very sensitive to external environmental
factors such as light, CO2, water status, and tempera-
ture. The reactions involved in the reduction of CO2
have been traditionally designated the ‘‘dark reactions’’
of photosynthesis, but this designation is quite mislead-
ing, since it implies they can proceed in the absence of
light. However, several critical enzymes in the carbon
reduction cycle are light activated; in the dark they are
either inactive or exhibit low activity. Consequently, car-
bon reduction cannot occur in the dark, even if energy
could be made available from some source other than
the photochemical reactions.
Only a few decades ago, knowledge of carbon
metabolism was in its infancy and, as is to be expected
when opening up new areas of study, understand-
ing of the process was somewhat unsophisticated.
Photosynthesis and respiration, long recognized as
the two major divisions of carbon metabolism, were
thought to be separate and independent metabolic
processes,
neatly
compartmentalized
in
the
cell.
Photosynthesis was localized in the chloroplast while
respiration appeared restricted to the cytoplasm and
the mitochondrion. The task of photosynthesis was to
reduce carbon and store it as sugars or starch. When
required, these storage products could be mobilized
and exported to the mitochondrion where they were
oxidized to satisfy the energy and carbon needs of
the cell through respiration. Thus, the relationships
between
photosynthesis
and
respiration
appeared
simple and uncomplicated.
Over the past 40 years, however, knowledge and
understanding of carbon metabolism has improved con-
siderably and, with that, so has the apparent complexity.
Photosynthetic carbon metabolism can no longer be
explained by a single, invariable cycle. It is no longer
restricted to just the chloroplast or even to a single cell.
In addition to carbon reduction, photosynthetic energy
is used to drive nitrogen assimilation, sulphate reduc-
tion, and other aspects of intermediary metabolism. The
rate of photosynthesis is inﬂuenced and even controlled
by events occurring outside the chloroplast and else-
where in the plant. These and other complexities of

metabolic integration within the cell and between dif-
ferent parts of the plant are only beginning to become
obvious. One thing is certain: a more holistic approach
to carbon metabolism is called for. The traditional,
compartmentalized vision of independent processes no
longer adequately explains carbon metabolism in plants.
This chapter will describe several interrelated vari-
ations of photosynthetic carbon metabolism in higher
plants, including
•
leaf gas exchange through stomatal pores that pro-
vide an efﬁcient mechanism for the absorption of
CO2 along a shallow concentration gradient,
•
the path of carbon, energetics, and regulation of
the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, or C3
metabolism—the pathway that all organisms ulti-
mately use to assimilate carbon, and
•
photorespiration and how limitations are imposed
on carbon assimilation in C3 plants by the photo-
synthetic carbon oxidation cycle
Later chapters will address carbon partitioning, res-
piratory carbon metabolism, and factors inﬂuencing the
distribution of carbon throughout the plant as well as the
ecological signiﬁcance of C4 and CAM (Crassulacean
Acid Metabolism) photosynthesis.
8.1 STOMATAL COMPLEX
CONTROLS LEAF GAS
EXCHANGE AND WATER
LOSS
The epidermis of leaves contains pores that provide for
the exchange of gases between the internal air spaces
and the ambient environment. The opening, or stoma,
is bordered by a pair of unique cells called guard cells
(Figure 8.1). In most cases the guard cells are in turn
surrounded by specialized, differentiated epidermal cells
called subsidiary cells. The stoma, together with its
bordering guard cells and subsidiary cells, is referred to
as the stomatal complex, or stomatal apparatus.
The distinguishing feature of the stomatal complex
is the pair of guard cells that functions as a hydrauli-
cally operated valve. Guard cells take up water and
swell to open the pore when CO2 is required for pho-
tosynthesis, and lose water to close the pore when
CO2 is not required or when water stress overrides
the photosynthetic needs of the plant. The mechan-
ical, physiological, and biochemical properties of the
guard cells have attracted scholars almost since their
occurrence was ﬁrst reported by M. Malpighi in the
late seventeenth century. A continuing interest in stom-
atal movement is understandable, given the foremost
importance of stomata in regulating gas exchange and
consequent effects on photosynthesis and productivity.
FIGURE 8.1 Stomata. (A) Elliptic type in the lower epi-
dermis of Zebrina. In this picture the stoma is open
(× 250). (B) Graminaceous type from the adaxial sur-
face of maize (Zea mays) leaf. These stomata are closed
(× 250).
More than 90 percent of the CO2 and water vapor
exchanged between a plant and its environment passes
through the stomata. Stomata are therefore involved in
controlling two very important but competing processes:
uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis and, as discussed in
Chapter 2, transpirational water loss. It is important,
therefore, to take into account stomatal function when
considering photosynthetic productivity and crop yields.

8.1 Stomatal Complex Controls Leaf Gas Exchange and Water Loss
131
More recently, additional interest in stomatal function
has been prompted by recognition that airborne pollu-
tants such as ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) also
enter the leaf through open stomata.
Stomata are found in the leaves of virtually all
higher plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms) and most
lower plants (mosses and ferns) with the exception
of submerged aquatic plants and the liverworts. In
angiosperms and gymnosperms they are found on most
aerial parts including nonleafy structures such as ﬂoral
parts and stems, although they may be nonfunctional in
some cases. The frequency and distribution of stomata
is quite variable and depends on a number of factors
including species, leaf position, ploidy level (the num-
ber of chromosome sets), and growth conditions. A
frequency in the range of 20 to 400 stomata mm−2
of leaf surface is representative, although frequencies
of 1000 mm−2 or more have been reported. Although
there are exceptions to every rule, the leaves of herba-
ceous monocots such as grasses usually contain stomata
on both the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) sur-
faces with roughly equal frequencies. Stomata occur on
both the upper and lower surfaces of herbaceous dicots’
leaves, but the frequency is usually lower on the upper
surface. Most woody dicots and tree species have stom-
ata only on the lower leaf surface while ﬂoating leaves of
aquatic plants (e.g., water lily) have stomata only on the
upper surface. In most cases the stomata are randomly
scattered across the leaf surface, although in monocots
with parallel-veined leaves the stomata are arranged in
linear arrays between the veins.
The most striking feature of the stomatal complex
is the pair of guard cells that border the pore. These
specialized epidermal cells have the capacity to undergo
reversible turgor changes that in turn regulate the size
of the aperture between them. When the guard cells
are fully turgid the aperture is open, and when ﬂaccid,
the aperture is closed. While there are many variations
on the theme, anatomically we recognize two basic types
of guard cells: the graminaceous type and the elliptic
type (Figure 8.1).
Elliptic or kidney-shaped guard cells are so called
because of the elliptic shape of the opening. In surface
view, these guard cells resemble a pair of kidney beans
with their concave sides opposed. In cross-section the
cells are roughly circular in shape, with a ventral wall
bordering the pit and a dorsal wall adjacent to the
surrounding epidermal cells (Figure 8.2). The mature
guard cell has characteristic wall thickenings, mainly
along the outer and inner margins of the ventral wall.
These thickenings extend into one or two ledges that
protect the throat of the stoma. In some plants, partic-
ularly the gymnosperms and aquatic species, the inner
ledge may be small or absent. The outer ledge appears
to be an architectural adaptation that helps to prevent
the penetration of liquid water from the outside into
the substomatal air space, which would otherwise have
disastrous consequences for gas exchange.
The graminaceous type of guard cell is largely
restricted to members of the Gramineae and certain
other monocots (e.g., palms). Often described as
dumbbell-shaped, the graminaceous-type guard cells
have thin-walled, bulbous ends that contain most of
the cell organelles (Figure 8.1). The ‘‘handle’’ of the
dumbbell is characterized by walls thickened toward the
lumen. The pore in this case is typically an elongated
slit. The guard cells are ﬂanked by two prominent
subsidiary cells.

Chapter 8 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: CO2 Assimilation
8.2 CO2 ENTERS THE LEAF
BY DIFFUSION
Diffusion of CO2 into the leaf through the stoma is more
efﬁcient than would be predicted on the basis of stomatal
area alone. A fully open stomatal pore typically measures
5 to 15 μm wide and about 20 μm long. The combined
pore area of open stomata thus amounts to no more
than 0.5 to 2 percent of the total area of the leaf. Since
leaves contain no active pumps, all of the CO2 taken
into the leaf for photosynthesis must enter by diffusion
through these extremely small pores. One might think
that diffusion through such a limited area would be
extremely restricted, yet it has been calculated that the
rate of CO2 uptake by an actively photosynthesizing leaf
may approach 70 percent of the rate over an absorbing
surface with an area equivalent to that of the entire leaf!
This extraordinarily high diffusive efﬁciency appears to
be related to the special geometry of gaseous diffusion
through small pores.
The high efﬁciency of gaseous diffusion through
stomata can be demonstrated experimentally by mea-
suring CO2 diffusion into a container of CO2-absorbing
agent such as sodium hydroxide. The container is
covered with a thin membrane perforated with pores
of known dimensions. Diffusion of CO2 through the
membrane can be measured as the amount of carbon-
ate present in the sodium hydroxide solution after, for
example, one hour. It was discovered that the rate of
CO2 diffusion through a perforated membrane varies in
proportion to the diameter of the pores, not the area. How
can these results be reconciled with Fick’s law, which
states that
Rate of diffusion = v = D · A(dc/dx)
(8.1)
where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient, A is the surface
area over which diffusion occurs, and (dc/dx) is the
concentration gradient over which diffusion occurs?
Clearly, the rate of diffusion is directly proportional
to the surface area, A, and the concentration gradient
(dc/dx).
The physical explanation for this paradox lies in
the pattern of diffusive ﬂow as the gases enter and exit
the stomatal pore. This is illustrated schematically for
a stoma in Figure 8.3. Note that in the aperture itself
(i.e., in the throat of the stoma) CO2 molecules can ﬂow
only straight through and diffusion is proportional to
the cross-sectional area of the throat as predicted by
Fick’s law of diffusion. But when the gas molecules pass
through the aperture into the substomatal cavity, they
can ‘‘spill over’’ the edge of the pore. The additional dif-
fusive capacity contributed by spillover is proportional
to the amount of edge, or the perimeter of the pore.
Because the area of a pore decreases by the square of
the radius (r) while perimeter varies directly with the

diameter (2r), the relative contribution of the perime-
ter effect increases as the pore size decreases. Thus in
very small pores (e.g., the size of stomata) the bulk of
gas movement is accounted for by diffusion over the
perimeter. Even this effect is exaggerated with respect
to stomata. Because of their elliptical shape, the ratio of
perimeter to area is greater than for circular pores.
How is a high concentration gradient for CO2
established and maintained? To ensure a constant dif-
fusion of CO2 from the air into the leaf, the CO2
concentration within the substomatal cavity and leaf air
spaces must be less than the CO2 concentration in the
air above the leaf. This CO2 concentration gradient
(dc/dx) is established because, in the light, chloroplasts
continuously ﬁx CO2, that is, chloroplasts within the
leaf mesophyll cells continuously convert gaseous CO2
into a stable, nongaseous molecule 3-phosphoglycerate
(PGA) through the reductive pentose phosphate cycle
(see below). Thus, this biochemical cycle constantly
removes CO2 from intercellular air spaces of a leaf,
thereby ensuring that the internal leaf CO2 concen-
tration is less than the ambient CO2 concentrations in
the light. In the dark, photosynthesis stops but respi-
ration generates CO2 such that the internal leaf CO2
concentrations are greater than the ambient CO2 con-
centrations, and thus CO2 diffuses out of a leaf in the
dark. The rate of CO2 evolution from a leaf in the dark
is a measure of the rate of leaf mitochondrial respiration.
The above arguments, of course, represent an ideal
situation. In reality, the stomatal pore itself is not the
only barrier to gaseous diffusion between the leaf and
its environment. A number of other factors—such as
unstirred air layers on the leaf surface and the aqueous
path between the air space and the chloroplast—offer
resistance to the uptake of CO2 into the leaf and com-
plicate the actual situation. Nonetheless, stomata are
remarkably efﬁcient structures. They permit very high

rates of CO2 absorption, without which photosynthesis
would be severely limited. This creates a paradox. A
system that is efﬁcient for the uptake of CO2 is also
efﬁcient for the loss of water vapor from the internal
surfaces of the leaf (Chapter 2). Thus, the principal
functional advantage offered by the stomatal apparatus
is an ability to conserve water by closing the pore when
CO2 is not required for photosynthesis or when water
stress overrides the leaf’s photosynthetic needs.
8.3 HOW DO STOMATA OPEN
AND CLOSE?
This question may be answered by ﬁrst asking what
mechanical forces are involved in guard cell movement.
The driving force for stomatal opening is known to be
the osmotic uptake of water by the guard cells and the
consequent increase in hydrostatic pressure. The result
is a deformation of the opposing cells that increases the
size of the opening between them. In the case of elliptic
guard cells the thickened walls become concave, while
in the dumbbell-shaped cells the handles separate but
remain parallel. Stomatal closure follows a loss of water,
and the consequent decrease in hydrostatic pressure and
relaxation of the guard cell walls.
Deformation of elliptic guard cells during opening
is due to the unique structural arrangement of the guard
cell walls. In normal cells, bands of cellulose microﬁbrils
encircle the cell at right angles to the long axis of the cell.
Studies with polarized light and electron microscopy
have demonstrated that the microﬁbrils in the guard cell
walls are oriented in radial fashion, fanning out from
the central region of the ventral wall (Figure 8.4). Addi-
tional microﬁbrils are arranged longitudinally within
the ventral wall thickenings, crosslinking with the radial
bands and restricting expansion along the ventral wall.
When the guard cells take up water, expansion follows
the path of least resistance—which is to push the rel-
atively thin dorsal walls outward into the neighboring
epidermal cells. This causes the cells to arch along the
ventral surface and form the stomatal opening. The
dumbbell-shaped guard cells of the grasses also depend
on the osmotic uptake of water, but operate in a slightly
different way. In this case the bulbous ends of the cells
push against each other as they swell, driving the central
handles apart in parallel and widening the pore between
them.
What controls stomatal opening and closure? To
answer this question it is necessary instead to ask what
regulates the osmotic properties of the guard cells. This
question has proven difﬁcult to answer, partly because
so many factors seem to be involved and partly because it
has been difﬁcult to study guard cell metabolism free of
complications introduced by the surrounding epidermal
and mesophyll cells. This problem has been partially
FIGURE 8.4 The role of microﬁbrils in guard cell move-
ment. The orientation of the microﬁbrils (solid arrows)
in elliptic guard cells allows expansion of the cells only in
the direction shown by the dashed arrows. This causes
the cells to buckle and thereby increase the size of the
opening between their adjacent walls.
resolved by studying guard cell behavior in peeled strips
of epidermal cells. More recently, techniques for prepa-
ration of guard cell protoplasts have become available,
making it possible to study guard cell metabolism and
ion movement in isolation.
Over the years a variety of mechanisms have been
offered to explain changing osmotic concentrations
of guard cells. Most have centered on the observa-
tion that guard cells normally contain chloroplasts
and were assumed to be photosynthetically competent.
One way or another it was proposed that an accu-
mulation of photosynthetic product—sugars and other
small molecules—contributed directly to the observed
osmotic changes in the guard cells. While it is true
that most guard cells do have chloroplasts, the number
of chloroplasts varies considerably. As well, the guard
cells of some species (e.g., some orchids and variegated
regions of Pelargonium) have no chloroplasts but remain
fully functional. Furthermore, investigators have been
unable to detect signiﬁcant levels of Rubisco (the princi-
pal carbon-ﬁxing enzyme; see below) in the guard cells
of at least 20 species, leading to the conclusion that
the carbon-ﬁxing portion of photosynthesis does not
operate in guard cells. The conclusion is inescapable:
photosynthetic carbon metabolism cannot be invoked as
a general mechanism to explain guard cell movement.
In the late 1960s it became evident that K+ levels
are very high in open guard cells and very low in closed
guard cells (Table 8.1). A variety of techniques, includ-
ing electron microprobes and histochemical methods
speciﬁc for K+, have conﬁrmed that the K+ content
of closed guard cells is low compared with that of the
surrounding subsidiary and epidermal cells. Upon open-
ing, large amounts of K+ move from the subsidiary and

epidermal cells into the guard cells. Consequently, an
accumulation of K+ in guard cells is now accepted as a
universal process in stomatal opening. This work gave
rise to the current hypothesis that the osmotic poten-
tial of guard cells and, consequently, the size of the
stomatal opening, is determined by the extent of K+
accumulation in the guard cells.
Although we lack a thorough understanding of the
mechanisms involved, available information about guard
cell metabolism and stomatal movements is summarized
in the general model shown in Figure 8.5. It is widely
accepted that accumulation of ions by most plant cells
is driven by an ATP-powered proton pump located
on the plasma membrane (Chapter 3). Two lines of
evidence indicate that K+ uptake by stomatal guard
cells ﬁts this general mechanism. First, the fungal toxin
fusicoccin, which is known to stimulate active proton
extrusion by the pump, stimulates stomatal opening.
Second, vanadate (VO−

pump, also inhibits stomatal opening. This constitutes

reasonably good evidence that proton extrusion is one
of the initial events in stomatal opening. By removing
positively charged ions, proton extrusion would tend
to hyperpolarize the plasma membrane (i.e., lower the
electrical potential inside the cell relative to the outside)
as well as establish a pH gradient. Hyperpolarization is
thought to open K+ channels in the membrane, which
then allows the passive uptake of K+ in response to
the potential difference or charge gradient across the
membrane.
In order to maintain electrical neutrality, excess K+
ion accumulated in the cells must be balanced by a
counterion carrying a negative charge. According to the
model shown in Figure 8.5, charge balance is achieved
partly by balancing K+ uptake against proton extrusion,
partly by an inﬂux of chloride ion (Cl−), and partly
by production within the cell of organic anions such
as malate. In most species, malate production probably
accounts for the bulk of the required counterion while
in others, such as corn (Zea mays), as much as 40 per-
cent of the K+ moving into the cell is accompanied
by Cl−. In those few species whose guard cells lack
chloroplast or starch, Cl−is probably the predominant
counterion.
In addition to its role in maintaining charge bal-
ance, the accumulation of malate also helps to main-
tain cellular pH during solute accumulation. Proton
extrusion would tend to deplete the intracellular pro-
ton concentration and increase cellular pH. However,
because malate is an organic anion, each carboxyl group
(—COO−) accumulated releases one proton into the
cytosol. The synthesis of malate therefore tends to
replenish the supply of protons lost by extrusion and
maintain cellular pH at normal levels.
The evidence for malate as a counterion is quite
strong. To begin with, malate levels in guard cells of
open stomata are ﬁve to six times that of closed stomata.
Second, guard cells contain high levels of the enzyme
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPcase), which cat-
alyzes the formation of malate (Figure 8.5). Third, there
is a decrease in the starch content of open stomata that
correlates with the amount of malate formed. Finally,
factors that inﬂuence stomatal opening and closure also
inﬂuence the activity of PEPcase. For example, fusic-
occin, which induces stomatal opening, also causes an

increase in both malate concentration and the activity of
PEPcase. Conversely, the plant hormone abscisic acid,
which normally induces stomatal closure, antagonizes
the effect of fusicoccin. The effect of fusicoccin is to
stimulate the phosphorylation of PEPcase, a process
well known to activate a variety of enzymes and other
proteins in the cell.
The accumulation of K+, Cl−, and malate in the
vacuoles of the guard cells would lower both the osmotic
potential and the water potential of the guard cells. The
consequent uptake of water would increase the turgor
and cause the stomata to open. At present, this remains
a working model for stomatal opening since many of the
details have yet to be veriﬁed experimentally.
Stomatal closure has not received the same atten-
tion that opening has, but it is generally assumed that
closure is effected by a simple reversal of the events
leading to opening. On the other hand, the rate of clo-
sure is often too rapid to be accounted for simply by
a passive leakage of ions from the guard cells, leading
to the suggestion that other speciﬁc metabolic pumps
are responsible for actively extruding ions upon closure.
One possibility is that signals for stomatal closure stim-
ulate the uptake of Ca2+ into the cytosol. Ca2+ uptake
would depolarize the membrane, thus initiating a chain
of events that includes opening anion channels to allow
the release of Cl−and malate. According to this scenario,
a loss of anions would further depolarize the membrane,
opening K+ channels and allowing the passive diffu-
sion of K+ into the adjacent subsidiary and epidermal
cells.
What is the source of ATP that powers the guard
cell proton pumps? The two most logical sources would
be either photosynthesis in the guard cell chloroplasts
or cellular respiration. Although most guard cells do
contain chloroplasts, they are generally smaller, less
abundant, and with fewer thylakoids than those of
underlying mesophyll cells. As noted above, guard
cell chloroplasts apparently lack the enzymatic machin-
ery for photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation. On the other
hand, although ATP production has not been measured
directly, indirect evidence indicates that they are capa-
ble of using light energy to produce ATP, a process
known as photophosphorylation (see Chapters 5 and
7). Photosynthesis is probably not the only immediate
source of energy, however, since stomatal movement
can occur in the dark. An alternative source of energy
is cellular respiration. Guard cells do have large num-
bers of mitochondria and high levels of respiratory
enzymes. They may well be able to derive sufﬁcient
ATP from the oxidation of carbon through oxida-
tive phosphosphorylation (see Chapters 5 and 10).
It appears that guard cells have more than adequate
capacity to produce, through either respiration or pho-
tosynthesis, all the energy necessary to drive stomatal
opening.
8.4 STOMATAL MOVEMENTS
ARE ALSO CONTROLLED
BY EXTERNAL
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The major role of stomata is to allow entry of CO2
into the leaf for photosynthesis while at the same time
preventing excessive water loss. In this sense, they evi-
dently serve a homeostatic function; they operate to
maintain a constancy of the internal environment of
the leaf. It should come as no surprise, then, to ﬁnd
that stomatal movement is regulated by a variety of
environmental and internal factors such as light, CO2
levels, water status of the plant, and temperature. It
might be expected, for example, that stomata will open
in the light in order to admit CO2 for photosynthesis or
partially close when CO2 levels are high in order to con-
serve water while allowing photosynthesis to continue.
On the other hand, conditions of extreme water stress
should override the plant’s immediate photosynthetic
needs and lead to closure, protecting the leaf against
the potentially more damaging effects of desiccation. In
general, these expectations have been veriﬁed by direct
observation. Each of these factors can theoretically be
studied independently under the controlled conditions
of the laboratory, but the extent to which they interact
under natural conditions makes it far more difﬁcult to
study the effects of one relative to another. Moreover,
it must be kept in mind that stomatal opening is not an
all-or-none phenomenon. At any given time, the extent
of stomatal opening and its impact on both photosyn-
thesis and water loss will be determined by the sum of
all of these factors and not by any one alone.
8.4.1 LIGHT AND CARBON DIOXIDE
REGULATE STOMATAL OPENING
Both light and CO2 appear to make a substantial contri-
bution to the daily cycle of stomatal movements. Their
effects are also tightly coupled, which makes it very
difﬁcult to distinguish their relative contributions. In
general, low CO2 concentrations and light stimulate
opening while high CO2 concentrations cause rapid
closure even in the light. The response of the stomata is
to the intracellular concentration of CO2 in the guard cells.
Recall that the outer surfaces of the epidermis, including
the guard cells, are covered with the CO2-impermeable
cuticle. Once induced to close by high CO2 treatment,
stomata are not easily forced to open by treatment with
CO2-free air. This is because the closed guard cells
remain in equilibrium with the high CO2 content of the
air trapped in the substomatal chamber. Consequently,
it is the CO2 content of the substomatal chamber rather
than the ambient atmosphere that is most important in

136
Chapter 8 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: CO2 Assimilation
regulating stomatal opening. The actual mechanism by
which CO2 regulates stomatal opening is not under-
stood.
Stomata normally open at dawn. As well, stomata
closed by exposure to high CO2 can be induced to open
slowly if placed in the light. Both responses appear to
result from two separate effects of light; one indirect and
one direct. The indirect effect requires relatively high
ﬂuence rates and is usually attributed to a reduction
in intercellular CO2 levels due to photosynthesis in
the mesophyll cells. By the same argument, closure
of the guard cells in the dark can be attributed to
the accumulation of respiratory CO2 inside the leaf.
This interpretation is reinforced by the observation
that the action spectrum for moderate to high ﬂuence
rates resembles that for photosynthesis with peaks in
both the red and blue. Thus it appears that CO2 is
a primary trigger and that, at least in intact leaves, the
indirect effect of light may operate through regulation of
intercellular CO2 levels. A signiﬁcant difﬁculty with this
interpretation, however, is that similar action spectra
have been obtained for isolated epidermal peels. Such
a result in the absence of an intact leaf argues strongly
for an important but yet undeﬁned role of the guard cell
chloroplasts.
Perhaps one of the more signiﬁcant advances to
emerge in recent years is the unequivocal demonstra-
tion of a direct effect of low-ﬂuence blue light on
stomatal opening. If the stomata depended solely on
photosynthetically active light, it would likely suffer
from two limitations. First, the guard cells would be
unable to respond to light levels below the photosyn-
thetic light compensation point (i.e., the minimum
ﬂuence rate at which photosynthesis exceeds respira-
tion). Second, the system would be prone to extreme
oscillations as the rate of photosynthesis ﬂuctuated with
rapid changes in PAR. A direct effect of blue light
on stomatal opening would seem to circumvent these
limitations.
The blue light effect has been demonstrated in a
variety of ways. Although stomatal opening is promoted
by both red and blue light, it is generally more sensitive
to blue light than to red. At low ﬂuence rates, below 15
μmol m−2 s−1, blue light will cause stomatal opening but
red light is ineffective. At higher ﬂuence rates stomatal
opening under blue light (which presumably activates
both systems) is consistently higher than under red at
the same ﬂuence rate. The response of stomata to red
light is probably indirect, mediated by the guard cell
chloroplasts and involving photosynthetic ATP produc-
tion. The action spectrum of the blue light response, on
the other hand, is typical of other blue light responses
and is probably mediated by cryptochrome, a putative
blue light receptor (Chapter 6). The mode of action
of blue light is not certain, but blue light does cause
swelling of isolated guard cell protoplasts. This result
indicates that blue light acts directly on the guard cells.
Several investigators have reported that blue light acti-
vates proton extrusion by the guard cells and stimulates
malate biosynthesis; both are prerequisites to stomatal
opening.
But what function does the blue light response serve
under natural conditions? One interesting and plausible
suggestion is that it may have a role in the early morn-
ing opening of stomata. Opening can often be observed
before sunrise, when ﬂuence rates are much lower than
that required to drive photosynthesis. They may also
remain open after sunset. The high sensitivity of the
blue light response to low ﬂuence rates together with
the relatively high proportion of blue light in sunlight
at dawn and dusk suggests that the blue light response
could function as an effective ‘‘light-on’’ signal. From
an ecophysiological standpoint, the blue light response
anticipates the need for atmospheric CO2 and drives
stomatal opening in preparation for active photosynthe-
sis. Another possible role is to stimulate rapid stomatal
opening in response to sunﬂecks—the sunﬂeck itself
would be analogous to a blue light pulse—in order to
maximize the opportunity for photosynthesis under this
particular condition (Chapter 14).
8.4.2 STOMATAL MOVEMENTS
FOLLOW ENDOGENOUS
RHYTHMS
Many biological processes undergo periodic ﬂuctuations
that persist under constant environmental conditions.
This phenomenon, known as endogenous rhythm,
is discussed further in Chapter 25. It was demon-
strated that stomatal opening and closure in Tradescantia
leaves persisted for at least three days, even though
the plants were maintained under continuous light. A
periodicity of approximately 24 hours was maintained,
although the timing of opening or closure could be
shifted by a six-hour dark period. Results such as these
clearly indicate an involvement of an endogenous circa-
dian rhythm in control of stomatal opening, although
it is not clear how the rhythm interacts with other
stimuli.
8.5 THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
CARBON REDUCTION (PCR)
CYCLE
Now that we understand the processes involved in the
control of CO2 entry into a leaf, we will examine
in some detail the biochemical mechanisms by which
chloroplasts ﬁx this CO2 and convert it to stable phos-
phorylated carbon intermediates.

8.5.1 THE PCR CYCLE REDUCES CO2
TO PRODUCE A THREE-CARBON
SUGAR
The pathway by which all photosynthetic eukaryotic
organisms ultimately incorporate CO2 into carbohy-
drate is known as carbon ﬁxation or the photosynthetic
carbon reduction (PCR) cycle. It is also referred to
as the Calvin cycle, in honor of Melvin Calvin, who
directed the research effort that elucidated the pathway.
Mapping the complex sequence of reactions involving
the formation of organic carbon and its conversion to
complex carbohydrates represented a major advance in
plant biochemistry. For his efforts and those of his asso-
ciates, Calvin was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry
in 1961.
The PCR cycle can be divided into three pri-
mary stages (Figure 8.6): (1) carboxylation which ﬁxes
the CO2 in the presence of the ﬁve-carbon acceptor
molecule, ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), and converts
it into two molecules of a three-carbon acid; (2) reduc-
tion, which consumes the ATP and NADPH produced
by photosynthetic electron transport to convert the
FIGURE 8.7 The carboxylation reaction of
the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle.
three-carbon acid to triose phosphate; and (3) regener-
ation, which consumes additional ATP to convert some
of the triose phosphate back into RuBP to ensure the
capacity for the continuous ﬁxation of CO2.
8.5.2 THE CARBOXYLATION REACTION
FIXES THE CO2
Calvin’s strategy for unraveling the path of carbon
in photosynthesis was conceptually very straightfor-
ward: identify the ﬁrst stable organic product formed
following uptake of radiolabeled CO2. In order to
achieve this, cultures of the photosynthetic green alga
Chlorella were ﬁrst allowed to establish a steady rate of
photosynthesis. 14CO2 was then introduced and photo-
synthesis continued for various periods of times before
the cells were dropped rapidly into boiling methanol.
The hot methanol served two functions: it denatured the
enzymes, thus preventing any further metabolism, while
at the same time extracting the sugars for subsequent
chromatographic analysis. When the time of photosyn-
thesis in the presence of 14CO2 was reduced to as little
as two seconds, most of the radioactivity was found in a
three-carbon acid, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). Thus
3-PGA appeared to be the ﬁrst stable product of photo-
synthesis. Other sugars that accumulated the label later
in time were probably derived from 3-PGA. Because
Calvin’s group determined that the ﬁrst product was
a three-carbon molecule, the PCR cycle is commonly
referred to as the C3 cycle. The next step was to
determine what molecule served as the acceptor—the
molecule to which CO2 was added in order to make
the three-carbon product. Systematic degradation of
3-PGA demonstrated that the 14C label was predomi-
nantly in the carboxyl carbon. A two-carbon acceptor
molecule would be logical, but the search was long and
futile. No two-carbon molecule could be found. Instead,
Calvin recognized that the acceptor was the ﬁve-carbon
keto sugar, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This
turned out to be the key to the entire puzzle. The reac-
tion is a carboxylation in which CO2 is added to RuBP,
forming a six-carbon intermediate (Figure 8.7). The

138
Chapter 8 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: CO2 Assimilation
intermediate, which is transient and unstable, remains
bound to the enzyme and is quickly hydrolyzed to
two molecules of 3-PGA. The carboxylation reaction
is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase-oxygenase, or Rubisco. Rubisco is with-
out doubt the most abundant protein in the world,
accounting for approximately 50 percent of the soluble
protein in most leaves. The enzyme also has a high afﬁn-
ity for CO2 that, together with its high concentration
in the chloroplast stroma, ensures rapid carboxylation at
the normally low atmospheric concentrations of CO2.
Thus, the reaction catalyzed by Rubisco maintains the
CO2 concentration gradient (dc/dx) between the inter-
nal air spaces of a leaf and the ambient air to ensure a
constant supply of this substrate for the PCR cycle.
8.5.3 ATP AND NADPH ARE CONSUMED
IN THE PCR CYCLE
The carboxylation reaction, with a G of −35 kJ mol−1,
is energetically very favorable. This poses an interesting
question. If the equilibrium constant of the reaction
favors carboxylation with such a high negative free
energy change, where is the need for an input of energy
from the light reactions of photosynthesis? Energy is
required at two points: ﬁrst for the reduction of 3-PGA
and second for regeneration of the RuBP acceptor
molecule. Each of these requirements will be discussed
in turn.
8.5.3.1 Reduction of 3-PGA
In order for the chlo-
roplast to continue to take up CO2, two conditions must
be met. First, the product molecules (3-PGA) must be
continually removed and, second, provisions must be
made to maintain an adequate supply of the acceptor
molecule (RuBP). Both require energy in the form of
ATP and NADPH.
The 3-PGA is removed by reduction to the triose
phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. This is a
two-step reaction (Figure 8.8) in which the 3-PGA is
ﬁrst phosphorylated to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which
is then reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
Both the ATP and the NADPH required in these two
steps are products of the light reactions and together
represent one of two sites of energy input. The resulting
triose sugar-phosphate, G3P, is available for export to
the cytoplasm, probably after conversion to dihydroxy-
acetone phosphate (DHAP) (Chapter 9).
8.5.3.2 Regeneration of RuBP
In order to main-
tain the process of CO2 reduction, it is necessary to
ensure a continuing supply of the acceptor molecule,
RuBP. This is accomplished by a series of reactions
involving 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-carbon sugars (Figures 8.9,
8.10). These reactions include the condensation of a
6-carbon fructose-phosphate with a triose-phosphate to
form a 5-carbon sugar and a 4-carbon sugar. Another
triose joins with the 4-carbon sugar to produce a
7-carbon sugar. When the 7-carbon sugar is com-
bined with a third triose-phosphate, the result is two
more 5-carbon sugars. All of the ﬁve-carbon sugar can
be isomerized to form ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P).
Ru5P can, in turn, be phosphorylated to regenerate the
required ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.
The net effect of these reactions is to recycle the
carbon from ﬁve out of every six G3P molecules, thus
regenerating three RuBP molecules to replace those
used in the earlier carboxylation reactions. The summary
reactions shown in Figures 8.9 and 8.10 include three
molecules of RuBP on each side of the equation. This
is to emphasize that the cycle serves to regenerate the
original number of acceptor molecules and maintain a
steady-state carbon reduction. Figures 8.9 and 8.10 show
that for every three turns of the cycle (i.e., the uptake
of three CO2) there is sufﬁcient carbon to regenerate
the required number of acceptor molecules plus one
additional triose phosphate, which is available for export
from the chloroplast. The stoichiometry in Figures 8.9
and 8.10 was chosen to illustrate this point. Six turns
of the cycle would regenerate 6 molecules of RuBP,
leaving the equivalent of one additional hexose sugar as
net product. Twelve turns would generate the equivalent
of a sucrose molecule, and so on.
As a general rule it is necessary to show that the
required enzymes are present and active before a com-
plex metabolic scheme can be accepted as fact. Calvin’s

phosphate (G3P).

phatase; (8, 9) ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase; (10) ribose-5-phosphate isomerase;
(11) ribulose-5-phosphate kinase.
PCR cycle has met this criterion since all of the enzymes
required by the scheme in Figure 8.9 have now been
demonstrated in the stroma. Moreover, all of the reac-
tions have been demonstrated in vitro, at rates that would
support maximal rates of photosynthesis.
8.5.4 WHAT ARE THE ENERGETICS
OF THE PCR CYCLE?
Figure 8.9 shows that for three turns of the cycle,
that is, the uptake of 3 molecules of CO2, a total of
6 molecules of NADPH and 9 molecules of ATP are
required. Therefore, the reduction of each molecule of
CO2 requires 2 molecules of NADPH and 3 molecules
of ATP for a ratio of ATP/NADPH of 3/2 or 1.5.
Since each NADPH stores 2 electrons, we can see that
a total of 4 electrons are required to ﬁx each molecule
of CO2. This total represents an energy input of 529 kJ
mol−1 of CO2. Oxidation of one mole of hexose would
yield about 2817 kJ, or 469 kJ mol−1 of CO2. Thus, the
photosynthetic reduction process represents an energy
storage efﬁciency of about 88 percent. If we include
the energy consumed in the form of the three ATP
per CO2 (3 × 31.4 kJ mol−1 = 282 kJ mol−1) for the
regeneration of RuBP, then energy storage efﬁciency is
about 58 percent. An important assumption underlying
these simple calculations is that all of the CO2 ﬁxed by
the PCR cycle actually remains ﬁxed in the leaf. Later
in this chapter we will see that this assumption does not
necessarily hold under all conditions.
8.6 THE PCR CYCLE IS HIGHLY
REGULATED
It was originally believed that the PCR cycle did not
require a signiﬁcant level of regulation, in part because
early in vitro studies of Rubisco suggested a low, and
probably rate-limiting, reactivity for this critical enzyme.
(Its in vivo reactivity is now known to be much higher,
although it may still be rate limiting.) In addition, plants
were widely believed to be opportunistic and would use
available light, water, and CO2 to conduct photosyn-
thesis at maximum rates. However, it is now recognized
that photosynthesis does not operate in isolation and an

Three turns of the cycle result in the regeneration of
3 molecules of the acceptor ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
(RuBP) plus an additional molecule of glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate (G-3-P). Additional abbreviations are: PGA,

unregulated photosynthetic machinery is incompatible
with an orderly and integrated metabolism. Chang-
ing levels of intermediates between light and dark
periods and competing demands for light energy and
carbon with other cellular needs (nitrate reduction, for
example) demand some degree of regulation. The most
effective control is, of course, at the level of enzyme
activities. Molecular biology combined with classical
enzyme kinetics (see Box 8.1) and structural informa-
tion obtained through protein crystallization has begun
to elucidate the sophisticated nature of photosynthetic
enzyme regulation. A principal factor in the regula-
tion of the PCR cycle is, perhaps not surprisingly,
light.
8.6.1 THE REGENERATION OF RuBP
IS AUTOCATALYTIC
The rate of carbon reduction is partly dependent on the
availability of an adequate pool of acceptor molecules,
CO2 and RuBP. The PCR cycle can utilize newly ﬁxed
carbon to increase the size of this pool, when neces-
sary, through the autocatalytic regeneration of RuBP.
During the night, when photosynthesis is shut down
and carbon is required for other metabolic activities, the
concentrations of intermediates in the cycle (including
RuBP) will fall to low levels. Consequently, when pho-
tosynthesis starts up again, the rate could be severely
limited by the availability of RuBP, the CO2 acceptor
molecule. Normally the extra carbon taken in through

the PCR cycle is accumulated as starch or exported from
the chloroplast. However, the PCR cycle has the poten-
tial to augment supplies of acceptor by retaining that
extra carbon and diverting it toward generating increas-
ing amounts of RuBP instead (Figure 8.11). In this way
the amount of acceptor can be quickly built up within
the chloroplast to the level needed to support rapid
photosynthesis. Only after the level of RuBP has been
built up to adequate levels will carbon be withdrawn for
storage or export. The time required to build up the
necessary levels of PCR cycle intermediates in the tran-
sition from dark to light is called the photosynthetic
induction time. No other sequence of photosynthetic
reactions has this capacity, which may help to explain
why all photosynthetic organisms ultimately rely on
the C3 cycle for carbon reduction. How autocatalysis
is regulated is not altogether clear. However, the most
effective control would be to enhance the activities of
enzymes favoring recycling over those leading to starch
synthesis or export of product.
8.6.2 RUBISCO ACTIVITY IS
REGULATED INDIRECTLY
BY LIGHT
Rubisco activity declines rapidly to zero when the light
is turned off and is regained only slowly when the light is
once again turned on. Light activation is apparently indi-
rect and involves complex interactions between Mg2+
ﬂuxes across the thylakoid, CO2 activation, chloroplast
pH changes, and an activating protein.
As noted in the previous chapter, light-driven elec-
tron transport leads to a net movement of protons into
the lumen of the thylakoids. The movement of protons

8.6 The PCR Cycle is Highly Regulated
141
across the thylakoid membrane generates a proton gra-
dient equivalent to 3.0 pH units and an increase in the
pH of the stroma from around pH 5.0 in the dark to
about pH 8.0 in the light. In vitro, Rubisco is gener-
ally more active at pH 8.0 than at pH 5.0. The Mg2+
requirement for Rubisco activity was noted some years
ago. Light also brings about an increase in the free Mg2+
of the stroma as it moves out of the lumen to compensate
for the proton ﬂux in the opposite direction.
Work in the laboratory of G. H. Lorimer, again
using isolated Rubisco in vitro, has shown that Rubisco
uses CO2 not only as a substrate but also as an activator.
The activating CO2 must bind to an activating site,
called the allosteric site, that is separate and distinct from
the substrate-binding site (see Box 8.1). Based on these
in vitro studies, Lorimer and Miziorko proposed a model
for in vivo activation that takes into account all three
factors: CO2, Mg2+, and pH. According to this model,
the CO2 ﬁrst reacts with an ε-amino group of a lysine
residue in the allosteric site, forming what is known as a
carbamate (Figure 8.12). Carbamate formation requires
the release of two protons and, consequently, would
be favored by increasing pH. The Mg2+ then becomes
coordinated to the carbamate to form a carbamate-Mg2+
complex, which is the active form of the enzyme.
Further experiments, however, indicated that the in
vitro model could not fully account for the activation
of Rubisco in leaves. In particular, measured values for
in vivo Mg2+ and CO2 concentrations and pH differ-
ences were not sufﬁcient to account for more than half
the expected activation level. This paradox was resolved
by the discovery of an Arabidopsis mutant that failed to
activate Rubisco in the light, even though the enzyme
isolated from the mutant was apparently identical to
that isolated from the wildtype. Electrophoretic analysis
revealed that the rca mutant, as it was called, was missing
a soluble chloroplast protein. Subsequent experiments
demonstrated that full activation of Rubisco could be

restored in vitro simply by adding the missing pro-
tein to a reaction mixture containing Rubisco, RuBP,
and physiological levels of CO2. This protein has been
named Rubisco activase to signify its role in promoting
light-dependent activation of Rubisco.
Rubisco activase is known to require energy in the
form of ATP. The protein has been identiﬁed in at
least 10 genera of higher plants as well as the green
alga Chlamydomonas. It is clear that Rubisco activase has
a signiﬁcant and probably ubiquitous role to play in
regulating eukaryotic photosynthesis.
8.6.3 OTHER PCR ENZYMES ARE ALSO
REGULATED BY LIGHT
Rubisco is not the only PCR cycle enzyme requiring
light activation. Studies with algal cells, leaves, and
isolated chloroplasts have shown that the activities of at
least four other PCR cycle enzymes are also stimulated
by light. These include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G-3-PDH) (reaction 2, Figure 8.9),
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
(FBPase)
(reaction
4,
Figure 8.9), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase)
(reaction 7, Figure 8.9), and ribulose-5-phosphate
kinase (R-5P-K) (reaction 11, Figure 8.9).
The mechanism for light activation is different from
that of Rubisco and is best demonstrated in the case of
FBPase. Light activation of FBPase can be blocked by
the electron transport inhibitor DCMU and agents that
selectively modify sulfhydryl groups. On the other hand,
the enzyme can be activated in the dark by the reducing
agent, dithiothreitol (DTT). It gradually emerged that
activation requires the participation of both chloroplast
ferredoxin, a product of the light-dependent reactions,
and thioredoxin (Figure 8.13). Like ferredoxin, thiore-
doxin is a small (12 kDa) iron-sulphur protein, known
to biochemists for its role in the reduction of ribonu-
cleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. It contains two cys-
teine residues in close proximity that undergo reversible

state to the sulfhydryl (—SH HS—) state. In the chloro-
plast, PSI drives the reduction of ferredoxin, which in
turn reduces thioredoxin. The reaction is mediated by
the enzyme ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase. Thiore-
doxin subsequently reduces the appropriate disulphide
bond on the target enzyme, resulting in its activation.
Subsequent deactivation of the enzymes in the dark is
not well understood, but clearly the sulfhydryl groups
are in some way reoxidized and the enzymes rendered
inactive.
The traditional view of the PCR cycle was that it
did not require the direct input of light. These reactions
were consequently referred to as the ‘‘dark reactions’’
of photosynthesis. In view of the fact that at least ﬁve
critical enzymes in the cycle require light activation,
such a designation is clearly not appropriate.
8.7 CHLOROPLASTS OF C3
PLANTS ALSO EXHIBIT
COMPETING CARBON
OXIDATION PROCESSES
The most widely used method for assessing the rate
of photosynthesis in whole cells (e.g., algae) or intact
plants is to measure gas exchange—either CO2 uptake
or O2 evolution. This is, at best, a complicated pro-
cess since there are several different and competing
metabolic reactions that contribute to the gas exchange
of an algal cell or a higher plant leaf. Cellular (or mito-
chondrial) respiration (R) is an example of opposite
gas exchange, since it results in an evolution of CO2
and uptake of O2. Historically, it was assumed that
mitochondrial-based respiration and chloroplast-based
photosynthesis were effectively independent and that
their respective contributions to gas exchange could
also be assessed independently. (One argument held
that photosynthesis could supply the entire energy need
of the leaf directly and the mitochondria would con-
sequently ‘‘shut down’’ in the light!). We now know
that measuring gas exchange is a far less certain pro-
cess, complicated in part by oxidative metabolism and
the consequent evolution of CO2 directly associated
with photosynthetic metabolism (Figure 8.14). Called
photorespiration (PR), this process involves the reox-
idation of products just previously assimilated in pho-
tosynthesis. The photorespiratory pathway involves the
activities of at least three different cellular organelles
(the chloroplast, the peroxisome, and the mitochon-
drion) and, because CO2 is evolved, results in a net loss
of carbon from the cell.
The measured CO2 uptake in the light is termed

Early experiments based on discrimination between
carbon isotopes suggested there were both qualitative
and quantitative differences between the process of res-
piration (i.e., CO2 evolution) as it occurred in the dark
and in the light. On this basis, CO2 evolution in the light
was called photorespiration. Initially, the concept that
light would alter the rate of respiration was, to say the
least, controversial. However, biochemical and molec-
ular evidence has ﬁrmly established photorespiration
as important process contributing to the gas exchange
properties of C3 leaves.
8.7.1 RUBISCO CATALYZES THE
FIXATION OF BOTH CO2 AND O2
While the legitimacy of photorespiration was being
established during the 1960s, the attention of sev-
eral investigators was attracted to the synthesis and
metabolism of a two-carbon compound, glycolate. It
gradually emerged that glycolate metabolism was related
to photorespiration and that the enzymes involved were
located in peroxisomes and mitochondria as well as the
chloroplast. The key to photorespiratory CO2 evolu-
tion and glycolate metabolism is the bifunctional nature
of Rubisco. In addition to the carboxylation reaction,

8.7 Chloroplasts of C3 Plants also Exhibit Competing Carbon Oxidation Processes
143
FIGURE 8.15 The RuBP oxygenase reaction.
Rubisco also catalyzes an oxygenase reaction, hence the
name ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase.
With the addition of a molecule of oxygen, RuBP is con-
verted into one molecule of 3-PGA and one molecule
of phosphoglycolate (Figure 8.15). The phosphoglyco-
late is subsequently metabolized in a series of reactions
in the peroxisome and the mitochondrion that result in
the release of a molecule of CO2 and recovery of the
remaining carbon by the PCR cycle (Figure 8.16).
The C2 glycolate cycle, also known as the pho-
tosynthetic carbon oxidation (PCO) cycle, begins
with the oxidation of RuBP to 3-PGA and P-glycolate.
The 3-PGA is available for further metabolism by the
PCR cycle, but the P-glycolate is rapidly dephospho-
rylated to glycolate in the chloroplast. The glycolate is
exported from the chloroplast and diffuses to a perox-
isome. Taken up by the peroxisome, the glycolate is
oxidized to glyoxylate and hydrogen peroxide. The per-
oxide is broken down by catalase and the glyoxylate
undergoes a transamination reaction to form the amino
acid glycine. Glycine is then transferred to a mitochon-
drion where two molecules of glycine (4 carbons) are
converted to one molecule of serine (3 carbons) plus one
CO2. Glycine is thus the immediate source of photorespired
CO2. The serine then leaves the mitochondrion, return-
ing to a peroxisome where the amino group is given up
in a transamination reaction and the product, hydrox-
ypyruvate, is reduced to glycerate. Finally, glycerate is
returned to the chloroplast where it is phosphorylated
to 3-PGA.
The release of carbon as CO2 during the conver-
sion of glycine to serine is accompanied by the release
of an equivalent amount of nitrogen in the form of
ammonia. During active photorespiration, the rate of
ammonia release may be substantially greater than the
rate of nitrogen assimilation. This nitrogen is not lost,
however, as the ammonia is rapidly reassimilated in the
chloroplast, using the enzymes of the glutamate synthase
cycle (Chapter 11).
The C2 glycolate pathway involves complex inter-
actions between photosynthesis, photorespiration, and
various aspects of nitrogen metabolism in at least three

different cellular organelles. Much of the supporting
evidence comes from labeling studies employing either
14CO2 or speciﬁc intermediates, or 18O2, in which the
fate of the label is followed through the various suspected
chemical transformations. As with the PCR cycle, all of
the enzymes necessary to carry out the C2 glycolate cycle
have been demonstrated. The distribution of interme-
diates between the three organelles, however, is not
conclusively established. It is largely inferred from the
location of the enzymes. All of the subcellular organelles
involved have been isolated and shown to contain the
appropriate enzymes.
8.7.2 WHY PHOTORESPIRATION?
In normal air (21% O2), the rate of photorespiration
in sunﬂower leaves is about 17 percent of gross photo-
synthesis. Every photorespired CO2, however, requires
an input of two molecules of O2 (Figure 8.16). The
true rate of oxygenation is therefore about 34 percent
and the ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation is about
3 to 1 (1.00/0.34). This experimental value agrees with
similar values calculated for several species based on the
known characteristic of puriﬁed Rubisco. The ratio of
carboxylation to oxygenation depends, however, on the
relative levels of O2 and CO2 since both gases compete

144
Chapter 8 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: CO2 Assimilation
for binding at the active site on Rubisco. As the concen-
tration of O2 declines, the relative level of carboxylation
increases until, at zero O2, photorespiration is also zero.
On the other hand, increases in the relative level of
O2 (or decrease in CO2) shifts the balance in favor of
oxygenation. An increase in temperature will also favor
oxygenation, since as the temperature increases the sol-
ubility of gases in water declines, but O2 solubility is
less affected than CO2. Thus O2 will inhibit photosyn-
thesis, measured by net CO2 reduction, in plants that
photorespire. The inhibition of photosynthesis by O2
was ﬁrst recognized by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, but
50 years were to pass before the bifunctional nature of
Rubisco offered the ﬁrst satisfactory explanation for this
phenomenon.
There is also an energy cost associated with pho-
torespiration and the glycolate pathway. Not only is
the amount of ATP and NAD(P)H expended in the
glycolate pathway following oxygenation (5 ATP + 3
NADPH) greater than that expended for the reduction
of one CO2 in the PCR cycle (3 ATP + 2 NADPH),
but there is also a net loss of carbon. On the surface, then,
photorespiration appears to be a costly and inefﬁcient
process with respect to both energy and carbon acquisi-
tion. It is logical to ask, as many have, why should the
plant indulge in such an apparently wasteful process?
This question is not easily answered, although sev-
eral ideas have been put forward. One has it that the
oxygenase function of Rubisco is inescapable. Rubisco
evolved at a time when the atmosphere contained large
amounts of CO2 but little oxygen. Under these condi-
tions, an inability to discriminate between the two gases
would have had little signiﬁcance to the survival of the
organism. Both CO2 and O2 react with the enzyme at the
same active site, and oxygenation requires activation by
CO2 just as carboxylation does. It is believed that oxygen
began to accumulate in the atmosphere primarily due to
photosynthetic activity, but by the time the atmospheric
content of O2 had increased to signiﬁcant proportions,
the bifunctional nature of the enzyme had been estab-
lished without recourse. In a sense, C3 plants were the
architect of their own problem—generating the oxy-
gen that functions as a competitive inhibitor of carbon
reduction. By this view, then, the oxygenase function
is an evolutionary ‘‘hangover’’ that has no useful role.
However, this is an oversimpliﬁed view of photores-
piration since photorespiratory mutants of Arabidopsis
proved to be lethal under certain growth conditions,
indicating the essential nature of the photorespiratory
pathway in C3 plants. Clearly, any inefﬁciencies result-
ing from photorespiration in C3 plants are apparently
not severe. There is no evidence that selection pressures
have caused evolution of a form of Rubisco with lower
afﬁnity for O2.
While most agree that oxygenation is an unavoid-
able consequence of evolution, many have argued that
plants have capitalized on this apparent evolutionary
deﬁciency by turning it into a useful, if not essen-
tial, metabolic sequence. The glycolate pathway, for
example, undoubtedly serves a scavenger function. For
each two turns of the cycle, two molecules of phos-
phoglycolate are formed by oxygenation. Of these four
carbon atoms, one is lost as CO2 and three are returned
to the chloroplast. The glycolate pathway thus recovers
75 percent of the carbon that would otherwise be lost as
glycolate. The salvage role alone may be sufﬁcient jus-
tiﬁcation for the complex glycolate cycle. There is also
the possibility that some of the intermediates, serine
and glycine, for example, are of use in other biosyn-
thetic pathways, although this possibility is still subject
to some debate.
Recently, strong experimental support has been
provided for the thesis that photorespiration could
also function as a sort of safety valve in situations
that require dissipation of excess excitation energy.
For example, a signiﬁcant decline in the photosyn-
thetic capacity of leaves irradiated in the absence of
CO2 and O2 has been reported. Injury is prevented,
however, if sufﬁcient O2 is present to permit pho-
torespiration to occur. Apparently the O2 consumed
by photorespiration is sufﬁcient to protect the plant
from photooxidative damage by permitting continued
operation of the electron transport system. This could
be of considerable ecological value under conditions
of high light and limited CO2 supply, for example,
when the stomata are closed due to moisture stress
(Chapter 14). Indeed, photorespiratory mutants of Ara-
bidopsis are more sensitive to photoinhibition than their
wildtype counterparts.
A claim made frequently in the literature is that
crop productivity might be signiﬁcantly enhanced by
inhibiting or genetically eliminating photorespiration.
As a result, substantial effort has been expended in the
search for chemicals that inhibit the glycolate pathway
or selective breeding for low-photorespiratory strains.
Others have surveyed large numbers of species in an
effort to ﬁnd a Rubisco with a signiﬁcantly lower afﬁnity
for oxygen. All of these efforts have been unsuccessful,
presumably because the basic premise that photorespi-
ration is detrimental to the plant and counterproductive
is incorrect. Clearly, success in increasing photosynthe-
sis and improving productivity lies in other directions.
For example, a mechanism for concentrating CO2 in
the photosynthetic cells could be one way to suppress
photorespiratory loss and improve the overall efﬁciency
of carbon assimilation. That is exactly what has been
achieved by C4 and CAM plants and will be discussed
further in Chapter 15.

8.7.3 IN ADDITION TO PCR,
CHLOROPLASTS EXHIBIT
AN OXIDATIVE PENTOSE
PHOSPHATE CYCLE
Although
the
oxidative
pentose
phosphate
cycle
(OPPC) is restricted to the cytosol in animals, this
pathway is present in both the chloroplast (Figure 8.17)
and the cytosol (Chapter 10) in plants. Furthermore,
the chloroplastic OPPC shares several intermediates
with the PCR pathway and is closely integrated
with it (Figure 8.17). The ﬁrst step in the oxidative
pentose phosphate cycle is the oxidation of glucose-6-P
(G-6-P) to 6-phosphogluconate (6-P-gluconate) by
the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(Figure 8.17, reaction 1). The glucose-6-phosphate
and fructose-6-phosphate are components of the same
stromal hexose phosphate pool that is shared with the
RPPC (Figure 8.9). This reaction is highly exergonic
(G < 0), and thus is not reversible. As a consequence,
this reaction is apparently the rate-determining step
for the stromal OPPC. The second reaction in the
OPPC involves the oxidation of 6-phosphogluconate
to ribulose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) by the enzyme
gluconate-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
with
the
production of one molecule of NADPH and one CO2
(Figure 8.17, reaction 2).
The simultaneous operation of both the PCR
pathway and the OPPC in the stroma would result in
the reduction of one molecule of CO2 to carbohydrate

at the expense of three ATP and two NADPH through
the PCR pathway. Subsequently, the carbohydrate
would be reoxidized to CO2 by the OPPC yielding
two NADPH. Thus, if both metabolic pathways
operate simultaneously in the stroma, three ATP
would be consumed with no net ﬁxation of CO2.
This would represent futile cycling of CO2 with
the net consumption of ATP. This would be terribly
wasteful!
How do plants overcome the apparent conundrum
created by the presence of both a reductive and
an oxidative pentose phosphate cycle in the same
compartment? The potential for the futile cycling
of CO2 is overcome by metabolic regulation, which
ensures that the key enzymes of the PCR cycle are active
only in the light and inactive in the dark. In contrast, the
key regulatory enzymes of the OPPC are active only in
the dark. Figure 8.13 shows that key regulatory enzymes
of the PCR cycle (FBPase, SBPase and Ru-5-P kinase)
are converted by light from their inactive to their active
forms by reduced thioredoxin through the reducing
equivalents
generated
by
photosynthetic
electron
transport. In contrast to stromal FBPase, SBPase, and
Ru-5-P kinase, which are active when their disulﬁde
bonds are reduced by thioredoxin (—S—S— →
— SH HS—), the key regulatory enzyme in the
OPPC
(glucose-6-P
dehydrogenase;
Figure
8.17,
reaction 1) is active when its internal disulﬁde bonds
are oxidized and inactive when they are reduced by
thioredoxin. As a consequence, Rubisco (Figure 8.12),
as well as stromal FBPase, SBPase, and Ru-5-P
kinase (Figure 8.13) are in their active states in the
light but phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is in the
inactive state, whereas in the dark, phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase is in its active state and the key
enzymes of the PRC pathway are inactive. Thus,
this exquisite regulation ensures that photosynthesis
results in the net ﬁxation of CO2 and conversion to
carbohydrate and prevents the wasteful consumption of
ATP.
The OPPC is thought to be a means to gener-
ate NADPH required to drive biosynthetic reactions
such as lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in plant mes-
ophyll cells. The oxidative pentose phosphate cycle
represents an important source of pentose phosphate,
which serves as a precursor for the ribose and deoxyri-
bose required in the synthesis of nucleic acids. Another
intermediate of the oxidative pentose phosphate path-
way with potential signiﬁcance to plants is the 4-carbon
erythrose-4-P, a precursor for the biosynthesis of aro-
matic amino acids, lignin, and ﬂavonoids. In addi-
tion, the Ru-5-P generated by the OPPC in the dark
can be converted to RuBP in the light to provide
the necessary acceptor molecule to get the RPPC
started.

ENZYMES
Living cells must carry out an enormous variety of bio-
chemical reactions, yet cells are able to rapidly construct
very large and complicated molecules, or regulate the
ﬂow of materials through complex metabolic pathways,
with unerring precision and accuracy. All this is made
possible by enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts;
they facilitate the conversion of substrate molecules to
product, but are not themselves permanently altered by
the reaction. Cells contain thousands of enzymes, each
catalyzing a particular reaction.
Enzyme-catalyzed reactions differ from ordinary
chemical reactions in four important ways:
1. High speciﬁcity. Enzymes are capable of recognizing
subtle and highly speciﬁc differences in substrate
and product molecules, to the extent of discriminat-
ing between mirror images of the same molecules
(called stereoisomers or enantiomers) in the same
way you do not ﬁt your right hand into your left
glove.
2. High reaction rates. The rates of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions are typically 106 to 1012 greater than rates
of uncatalyzed reactions. Many enzymes are capa-
ble of converting thousands of substrate molecules
every second.
3. Mild reaction conditions. Enzyme reactions typically
occur at atmospheric pressure, relatively low tem-
perature, and within a narrow range of pH near
neutrality. There are exceptions, such as certain
protein-degrading enzymes that operate in vacuoles
with a pH near 4.0, or enzymes of thermophilic
bacteria that thrive in hot sulfur springs, where
temperatures are close to 100◦C. Most enzymes,
however, enable biological reactions to occur under
conditions far milder than those required for most
chemical reactions.
4. Opportunity for regulation. The presence of a particu-
lar enzyme and its amount is regulated by controlled
gene expression and protein turnover. In addition,
enzyme activity is subject to regulatory control by a
variety of activators and inhibitors.
These opportunities for regulation are instrumental
in keeping complex and often competing metabolic
reactions in balance.
The ﬁrst step in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the
reversible binding of a substrate molecule (S) with the
enzyme (E) to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES):
E + S ⇆ES →E + P
(8.4)
The enzyme-substrate complex then dissociates to
release the product molecule (P). The free enzyme is
regenerated and is then available to react with another
molecule of substrate.
Enzymes are proteins and the site on the protein
where the substrate binds and the reaction occurs is
called the active site. Active sites are usually located in a
cleft or pocket in the folded protein, and contain reactive
amino acid side chains, such as carboxyl (—COO−),
amino (—NH+
3 ), or sulfur (—S−) groups that position
the substrate and participate in the catalysis. The shape
and polarity of the active site is largely responsible for
the speciﬁcity of an enzyme, since the shape and polarity
of the substrate molecule must complement or ‘‘ﬁt’’ the
geometry of the active site in order for the substrate to
gain access and bind to the catalytic groups. Where two
or more substrates participate in a common reaction,
binding of the ﬁrst substrate may induce a change in
the conformation of the protein, which then allows the
second substrate access to the active site.
Enzymes increase the rate of a reaction because they
lower the amount of energy, known as the activation
barrier, required to initiate the reaction. This effect is
illustrated by the ball and hill analogy (Figure 8.18A).
In order for the ball to roll down the hill, it must ﬁrst
be pushed over the lip of the depression in which it
sits. This act increases the potential energy of the ball.
When the ball is poised at the very top of the lip, it is in
a transition state; that is, there is an equal probability
that it will fall back into the depression or roll forward
and down the hill.
Chemical reactions go through a similar transi-
tion state (Figure 8.18B). As reacting molecules come
together, they increasingly repel each other and the
potential energy of the system increases. If the reactants
approach with sufﬁcient kinetic energy, however, they
will achieve a transition state where there is an equal
probability that they will decompose back to reactants or
proceed to products. In the case of an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction, the enzyme-substrate complex takes a differ-
ent reaction pathway—a pathway that has a transition
state energy level substantially lower than that of the
uncatalyzed reaction (Figure 8.18B).
Enzyme-catalyzed reactions exhibit reaction kinet-
ics that exhibit a hyberbolic relationship between the
reaction velocity, v, and the substrate concentration,
[S] (Figure 8.19). Enzymes that exhibit such reaction
kinetics are said to follow Michaelis-Menton kinetics.
Michaelis-Menton kinetics are characterized by sub-
strate saturation, which reﬂects the fact the enzyme
becomes saturated with substrate with increasing sub-
strate concentration at constant enzyme concentration.
The Michaelis-Menton equation describes this relation-
ship mathematically:
v = Vmax [S]/Km + [S]

where v is the initial rate of the reaction, Vmax is the
maximum substrate-saturated rate of the reaction, and
the Km is the substrate concentration that provides the
half-maximal substrate-saturated rate of the reaction.
The Km is used as a measure of the afﬁnity that an
enzyme has for its substrate: a high Km value implies
low afﬁnity of the enzyme for its substrate, whereas a
low Km value implies a high afﬁnity of the enzyme for
its substrate.

which provides 1/2 Vmax.
It is important to note that enzymes do not alter the
course of a reaction. They do not change the equilibrium
between reactants and products, nor do they alter the
free energy change (G) for the reaction. (See Chapter 5
for a discussion of free energy changes.) Enzymes change
only the rate of a reaction.
Most enzymes are identiﬁed by adding the sufﬁx -ase
to the name of the substrate, often with some indication
of the nature of the reaction. For example, α-amylase
digests amylose (starch), malate dehydrogenase oxidizes
(that is, removes hydrogen from) malic acid, and phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxylase adds carbon dioxide (a
carboxyl group) to a molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate.
Many enzymes do not work alone, but require
the presence of nonprotein cofactors. Some cofactors,
called coenzymes, are transiently associated with the
protein and are themselves changed in the reaction.
Many electron carriers, such as NAD+ or FAD, for
example, serve as coenzymes for many dehydrogenase
enzymes (see Chapter 10). They are, in fact, cosubstrates
and are reduced to NADH or FADH2 in the reaction.
Prosthetic groups are nonprotein cofactors more or
less permanently associated with the enzyme protein.
The heme group of hemoglobin is an example of a
tightly bound prosthetic group. Many plant enzymes
utilize ions such as iron or calcium as prosthetic groups.
Enzymes and enzyme reactions are sensitive to both
temperature and pH. Like most chemical reactions,
enzyme reactions have a Q10 of about 2, which means
that the rate of the reaction doubles for each 10◦C
rise in temperature. The rate increases with tempera-
ture until an optimum is reached, beyond which the
rate usually declines sharply. The decline is normally
caused by thermal denaturation, or unfolding of the

148
Chapter 8 / Energy Conservation in Photosynthesis: CO2 Assimilation
enzyme protein. With most enzymes, thermal denatu-
ration occurs in the range of 40 to 45◦C, although many
enzymes exhibit temperatures closer to 25 or 30◦C.
Some enzymes exhibit instability at lower temperatures
as well. One example is pyruvate, pyrophosphate dik-
inase (PPDK) (Chapter 15). PPDK is unstable and
loses activity at temperatures below about 12 to 15◦C.
Enzyme reactions are also sensitive to pH, since pH
inﬂuences the ionization of catalytic groups at the active
site. The conformation of the protein may also be
modiﬁed by pH.
Substrate
molecules
as
well
as
other

metabolites may not only participate in enzyme catalysis
(Equation 8.4) but may also stimulate enzyme activity.
This phenomenon is called enzyme activation and
occurs as a consequence of the binding of the substrate
or metabolite molecule to a site on the enzyme that is
distinct from the active site. This second alternative
binding site on the enzyme is called the allosteric
site. The binding of the substrate to the allosteric site
induces a conformational change in the active site which
enhances the rate at which the substrate (S) is converted
to product (P). Molecules capable of binding to the
allosteric site are called effector molecules. Enzymes
which exhibit such regulation are called allosteric
enzymes. Rubisco (8.6.2) is an example of an allosteric
enzyme. CO2 is not only the substrate for the reaction
catalyzed by this enzyme, but also activates Rubisco
activity by binding to the ε-amino group located in the
allosteric site of Rubisco (Figure 8.12).
Conversely, a variety of ions or molecules may
combine with an enzyme in such a way that it reduces
the catalytic activity of the enzyme. These are known
as inhibitors. Inhibition of an enzyme may be either
irreversible or reversible. Irreversible inhibitors act
by chemically modifying the active site so that the
substrate can no longer bind, or by permanently altering
the protein in some other way. Reversible inhibitors
often have chemical structures that closely resemble
the natural substrate. They bind at the active site, but
either do not react or react very slowly. For example,
the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by the enzyme
succinic dehydrogenase is competitively inhibited by
malonate, an analog of succinate (Figure 8.20).
Because substrate and inhibitor compete with one
another for attachment to the active site, this form of
inhibitor is known as competitive inhibition. Another
form of reversible inhibitor, the noncompetitive
inhibitor, does not compete with the substrate for the
active site, but binds elsewhere on the enzyme and, in
doing so, restricts access of the substrate to the active
site. Alternatively, noncompetitive inhibitors may bind
directly to the enzyme-substrate complex, thereby
rendering the enzyme catalytically inactive.

committed step. In the example shown in Figure 8.21,
reactions A→B, C→D, and C→F all represent com-
mitted steps. In this example, an excess of product G
would reduce the ﬂow of precursor through the reaction
of C →F, thereby diverting more precursor, C, to prod-
uct E. Alternatively, an excess of both E and G would
regulate the conversion of A to B. Feedback regulation
is an effective way of coordinating product formation
within complex pathways. Many of the enzymes of respi-
ratory metabolism, for example, are subject to feedback
regulation, thereby balancing the ﬂow of carbon against
the constantly changing energy demands of the cell.
Enzymes are remarkable biological catalysts that
both enable and control the enormous variety of bio-
chemical reactions that comprise life.

Photosynthetic gas exchange between the leaf and the
air is dependent upon diffusion and is regulated by
the opening and closing of specialized epidermal pores
called stomata. Stomatal movement is regulated by
K+ levels in the guard cells. Opening and closing of
stomata are also sensitive to environmental factors such
as CO2 levels, light, temperature, and the water status
of the plant.
The photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR)
cycle occurs in the chloroplast stroma. It is the
sequence of reactions all plants use to reduce carbon
dioxide to organic carbon. The key enzyme is
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
(Rubisco), which catalyzes the addition of a car-
bon dioxide molecule to an acceptor molecule,
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). The product is two
molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). Energy
from the light-dependent reactions is required at
two stages: ATP and NADPH for the reduction of
3-PGA and ATP for the regeneration of the acceptor
molecule RuBP. The bulk of the cycle involves a series
of sugar rearrangements that (1) regenerate RuBP and
(2) accumulate excess carbon as 3-carbon sugars. This
excess carbon can be stored in the chloroplast in the
form of starch or exported from the chloroplast for
transport to other parts of the plant.
Photosynthesis, like all other complex metabolic
reactions, is subject to regulation. In this case, the pri-
mary activator is light. Several key PCR cycle enzymes,
including Rubisco, are light activated. This is one way
of integrating photosynthesis with other aspects of
metabolism, regulating changing levels of intermedi-
ates between light and dark periods and competing
demands for carbon with other cellular needs.
Plants that utilize the PCR cycle exclusively for
carbon ﬁxation also exhibit a competing process of
light- and oxygen-dependent carbon dioxide evolution,
called photorespiration. The source of carbon dioxide
is the photosynthetic carbon oxidation (PCO) cycle.
The PCO cycle also begins with Rubisco, which, in
the presence of oxygen, catalyzes the oxidation, as well
as carboxylation, of RuBP. The product of RuBP oxi-
dation is one molecule of 3-PGA plus one 2-carbon
molecule, phosphoglycolate. Phosphoglycolate is sub-
sequently metabolized in a series of reactions that
result in the release of carbon dioxide and recovery
of the remaining carbon by the PCR cycle. The role
of the PCO cycle is not yet clear, although it has been
suggested that it helps protect the chloroplast from
photo-oxidative damage during periods of moisture
stress, when the stomata are closed and the carbon
dioxide supply is cut off.
Chloroplasts also exhibit an oxidative pentose
phosphate cycle (OPPC) that potentially would lead
to the futile cycling of CO2. This is prevented by the
differential light regulation of reductive and oxida-
tive pentose phosphate cycles through the action of
thioredoxin.

Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning
of Photoassimilates
The previous two chapters showed how energy was
conserved in the form of carbon compounds, or pho-
toassimilates. The primary function of photosynthesis
is to provide energy and carbon sufﬁcient to support
maintenance and growth not only of the photosynthetic
tissues but of the plant as a whole. During daylight
hours, photoassimilate generated by the PCR cycle is
temporarily accumulated in the leaf as either sucrose
in the mesophyll vacuole or starch in the chloroplast
stroma. The conversion of photoassimilates to either
sucrose or starch is called carbon allocation. Although
a portion of the carbon assimilated on a daily basis is
retained by the leaf to support its continued growth
and metabolism, the majority is exported out of the
leaf to nonphotosynthetic organs and tissues. There, it
is either metabolized directly or placed in storage for
retrieval and metabolism at a later time. The trans-
port of photoassimilates over long distances is known
as translocation. Translocation occurs in the vascu-
lar tissue called phloem. Phloem translocation is a
highly signiﬁcant process that functions to ensure an
efﬁcient distribution of photosynthetic energy and car-
bon between organs throughout the organism. This
is called carbon partitioning. Phloem translocation is
also important from an agricultural perspective because
it plays a signiﬁcant role in determining productivity,
crop yield, and the effectiveness of applied herbicides
and other xenobiotic chemicals.
This chapter is focused on the biosynthesis of
the photosynthetic end-products, starch and sucrose,
and the structure of the phloem and its function in
the translocation and distribution of these important
photoassimilates. The principal topics to be covered
include
•
the biosynthesis of starch and sucrose,
•
the allocation of ﬁxed carbon between the starch
and sucrose biosynthetic pathways,
•
the basis for identifying phloem as the route for
translocation of photoassimilates and the nature of
substances translocated in the phloem,
•
the structure of the phloem tissue, especially the
several unique aspects of sieve tube structure and
composition,
•
the source-sink concept and the signiﬁcance of
sources and sinks to the translocation process,
•
the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis for phloem transloca-
tion and the processes by which photoassimilates
gain entry into the phloem in the leaf and are sub-
sequently removed from the translocation stream at
the target organ,

9.1 STARCH AND SUCROSE
ARE BIOSYNTHESIZED
IN TWO DIFFERENT
COMPARTMENTS
Many plants, such as soybean, spinach, and tobacco,
store excess photoassimilate as starch in the chloroplast,
while others, such as wheat, barley, and oats, accumu-
late little starch but temporarily hold large amounts of
sucrose in the vacuole. The appropriation of carbon
ﬁxed by the PCR cycle into either starch or sucrose
biosynthesis is called carbon allocation. This will be
discussed further in relation to source sink relation-
ships (see below). The starch and sucrose will later be
mobilized to support respiration and other metabolic
needs at night or during periods of limited photosyn-
thetic output. Sucrose exported from the leaf cell to
nonphotosynthetic tissues may be metabolized imme-
diately, stored temporarily as sucrose in the vacuoles,
or converted to starch for longer-term storage in the
chloroplasts.
9.1.1 STARCH IS BIOSYNTHESIZED
IN THE STROMA
The dominant storage carbohydrate in higher plants
is the polysaccharide starch, which exists in two forms
(Figure 9.1). Amylose is a linear polymer of glucose
created by linking adjacent glucose residues between
the ﬁrst and fourth carbons. Amylose is consequently
known as an α-(1,4)-glucan. Amylopectin is similar to
amylose except that occasional α-(1,6) linkages, about
every 24 to 30 glucose residues, create a branched
molecule. Amylopectin is very similar to glycogen, the
principal storage carbohydrate in animals. Glycogen is
more highly branched, with one α-(1,6) linkage for
every 10 glucose residues compared with one in 30 for
amylopectin.
The site of starch synthesis in leaves is the
chloroplast. Large deposits of starch are clearly evi-
dent in electron micrographs of chloroplasts from
C3 plants. In addition, the two principal enzymes in-
volved—ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase and starch
synthase—are found localized in the chloroplast
stroma. Starch synthesis in the chloroplast begins with
the hexose phosphate pool generated by the PCR
cycle (Figure 9.2). Fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), one
component of the stromal hexose phosphate pool, is
converted to glucose-1-phosphate, another component
of the stromal hexose phosphate pool, by the two

ADP-glucose is an activated form of glucose and serves
as the immediate precursor for starch synthesis. Starch
deposits within the chloroplast stroma are evident as
insoluble starch grains. As a consequence, this form of
stored carbon is osmotically inactive (Chapter 1) which
allows plants to store large amounts of ﬁxed carbon
in chloroplasts with minimal inﬂuence on the osmotic
pressure of the stroma. This prevents the chloroplast
membrane from bursting upon the accumulation and
storage of ﬁxed carbon as starch.

Formation of the α-(1,6) branching linkages, giving rise
to amylopectin, is catalyzed by the branching enzyme,
also known as the Q-enzyme.
9.1.2 SUCROSE IS BIOSYNTHESIZED
IN THE CYTOSOL
Sucrose is a soluble disaccharide containing a glucose
and a fructose residue (Figure 9.2B). It is one of the more
abundant natural products that not only plays a vital role
in plant life but is also a leading commercial commodity.
Sucrose may function as a storage product as it does in
sugarbeets or sugarcane, where it is stored in the vacuoles
of specialized storage cells. Alternatively, sucrose may
be translocated to other, nonphotosynthetic tissues in
the plant for direct metabolic use or for conversion to
starch. Sucrose is by far the most common form of sugar
found in the translocation stream.
The site of sucrose synthesis in the cell was the
subject of debate for some time. On the basis of
cell fractionation and enzyme localization studies it
has now been clearly established that sucrose synthe-
sis occurs exclusively in the cytosol of photosynthetic
cells (Figure 9.2). Earlier reports of sucrose synthesis
in isolated chloroplasts appear attributable to contam-
ination of the chloroplast preparation with cytosolic
enzymes. Moreover, the inner membrane of the chloro-
plast envelope is impermeable to sucrose, so that if
sucrose were synthesized inside the chloroplast it would
be unable to exit the chloroplast and enter the translo-
cation stream.
Two routes of sucrose synthesis are possible. The
principal pathway for sucrose synthesis in photosyn-
thetic cells is provided by the enzymes sucrose phos-
phate synthase (Equation 9.6) and sucrose phosphate
phosphatase (Equation 9.7).

Chapter 9 / Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning of Photoassimilates
UDP-glucose + fructose-6-P ↔sucrose-6-P + UDP
(9.6)
sucrose-6-P + H2O ↔sucrose + Pi
(9.7)
Energy provided by the hydrolysis of sucrose-6-
phosphate (about 12.5 kJ mol−1) may play a role in the
accumulation of high sucrose concentrations typical of
sugarcane and other sucrose-storing plants.
Another cytoplasmic enzyme capable of synthesiz-
ing sucrose is sucrose synthase (SS) (Equation 9.8):
UDP-glucose + fructose ↔sucrose + UDP
(9.8)
With a free energy change of approximately +14 kJ
mol−1, this reaction is not spontaneous. Most of the
evidence indicates that under normal conditions SS
operates in the reverse direction to break down sucrose
(see Equation 9.11).
Note that, in contrast with starch biosynthesis,
sucrose biosynthesis by either pathway requires acti-
vation of glucose with the nucleotide uridine triphos-
phate (UTP) rather than ATP:
UTP + glucose-1-P ↔UDP-glucose + PPi
(9.9)
PPi + H2O ↔2Pi
(9.10)
Although sucrose phosphate synthase in some tissues can
use ADP-glucose, UDP-glucose is clearly predominant.
Carbon
for

is exported from the chloroplast through a special
orthophosphate
(Pi)-dependent
transporter
located
in the chloroplast envelope membranes (Figure 9.2).
This
Pi/triose
phosphate
transporter
exchanges
Pi and triose phosphate—probably as dihydroxyace-
tone phosphate (DHAP)—on a one-for-one basis.
Once in the cytoplasm, two molecules of triose
phosphates (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and DHAP)
are
condensed
to
form
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
Subsequently,
the
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
enters
the cytosolic hexose phosphate pool where it is
converted to glucose-1-phosphate as it is in the
chloroplast, employing cytoplasmic counterparts of the
chloroplastic enzymes. Some of the orthophosphate
generated in sucrose synthesis is used to regenerate
UTP while the rest can reenter the chloroplast in
exchange for triose-P.
Sucrose translocated from the leaf to storage organs
such as roots, tuber tissue, and developing seeds is most
commonly stored as starch. The conversion of sucrose
to starch is generally thought to involve a reversal of the
sucrose synthase reaction:
Sucrose + UDP →fructose + UDP −glucose (9.11)
Because ADP-glucose is preferred for starch biosynthe-
sis, UDP-glucose is converted to ADP-glucose as shown
in (Equation 9.12) and (Equation 9.13):
UDP-glucose + PPi ↔UTP + glucose-1-P
(9.12)
ATP + glucose-1-P ↔ADP-glucose + H2O + PPi
(9.13)
The resulting ADP-glucose is then converted to starch
by starch synthase.
9.2 STARCH AND SUCROSE
BIOSYNTHESIS ARE
COMPETITIVE PROCESSES
It
has
traditionally
been
held
that
carbohydrate
metabolism is to a large extent governed by source-sink
relationships. The photosynthetically active leaf, for
example, would be a source, providing assimilated
carbon that is available for transport to the sink,
a storage organ or developing ﬂower or fruit, for
example, which utilizes that assimilate. With respect to
relationships between sucrose and starch, it was often
observed that removal of a sink, thus reducing demand
for photoassimilate, resulted in accumulation of starch
in the leaves. This led to the assumption that starch
represented little more than excess carbon. There is
now good evidence that this assumption is false.
In soybean plants (Glycine max), starch accumulation
is not related to the length of the photosynthetic period.
Plants maintained on a 7-hour light period put a larger
proportion of their daily photoassimilate into starch
than those maintained on a 14-hour light period, even
though the assimilation period is only half as long. Thus
it appears that foliar starch accumulation is more closely
related to the energy needs of the daily dark period than
photosynthetic input. Just how these needs are antici-
pated by the plant is unknown. However, many species
are now known to distribute different proportions of
carbon between starch and sucrose in ways apparently
unrelated to sink capacity or inherent capacities of iso-
lated chloroplasts to form starch. Carbon distribution
thus appears to be a programmed process, implying
some measure of control beyond a simple source-sink
relationship. Moreover, it is essential that sucrose syn-
thesis be controlled in order to maintain an efﬁcient
operation of photosynthesis itself. If the rate of sucrose
synthesis should exceed the rate of carbon assimilation,
demand for triose-P in the cytoplasm could deplete the
pool of PCR cycle intermediates, thereby decreasing
the capacity of Calvin cycle enzymes for regeneration of
RuBP and seriously inhibiting photosynthesis.
While the enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase
(SPS) determines the maximum capacity for sucrose
synthesis, it appears that cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphos-
phate phosphatase (FBPase) plays the more important
role in balancing the allocation of carbon between
sucrose and starch synthesis. The highly exergonic
reaction (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate →fructose-6-phos-

phate + Pi) occupies a strategic site in the sucrose
synthetic pathway—it is the ﬁrst irreversible reaction
in the conversion of triose-P to sucrose. Consequently
the ﬂow of carbon into sucrose can easily be con-
trolled by regulating the activity of FBPase—similar
to regulating the ﬂow of water by opening or closing
a valve.
Unlike the chloroplastic FBPase, which is light
regulated by thioredoxin, the cytosolic FBPase is not
regulated by thioredoxin, but rather is quite sensitive to
inhibition by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP)
(Figure 9.3). F-2,6-BP, an analog of the natural sub-
strate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, is considered a reg-
ulator metabolite because it functions as a regulator
rather than a substrate (Figure 9.4). F-2,6-BP levels
are, in turn, sensitive to a number of interacting factors
including the concentration of F-6-P of the cytosolic
hexose phosphate pool and the cytosolic triose-P/Pi
ratio (Figure 9.4).
Control of sucrose synthesis by F-2,6-BP is essential
to ensure a balance between rates of CO2 assimila-
tion and the allocation of ﬁxed carbon. For example,
sucrose export from the cell slows in the light, lead-
ing to an accumulation of intermediates such as F-6-P
in the cytosolic hexose phosphate pool and triose-P.
This causes a shift in allocation in favor of starch.
When the consumption of sucrose decreases, sucrose
and its precursors (e.g., F-6-P) will accumulate in the
leaf cytosolic hexose pool (Figure 9.2). Since F-6-P is
also the precursor for F-2,6-BP, levels of the inhibitor
will increase as well—leading to an inhibition of FBPase
and an accumulation of triose-P. The accumulation of
phosphorylated intermediates probably also leads to a
decrease in the concentration of Pi. The combined
accumulation of triose-P and decrease of Pi will in turn
decrease the rate at which triose-P can be exported
from the chloroplast through the transporter. The
consequent accumulation of triose-P and decrease of
orthophosphate in the chloroplast in turn stimulate the
synthesis of starch (Figure 9.2). The decrease in stromal
Pi leads to a reduction in ATP synthesis (ADP + Pi →

FIGURE 9.4 The synthesis of sucrose is regulated by
F-6-P triose-P/Pi ratio. The accumulation of F-6-P
in the cytosolic hexose-P pool favors the synthe-
sis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) from
F-6-P. F-6-P in the cytosolic hexose-P pool is phos-
phorylated by the enzyme, F-6-P-2-kinase (reac-
tion 1) and converted to F-2,6-BP. Accumulation
of this regulatory metabolite inhibits the activity of
the enzyme, FBPase, but stimulates the enzyme,
pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase
(PPi-PFK), which catalyzes the reverse reaction. The
net result is a decreased rate of entry of carbon into
the cytosolic hexose-P pool and hence a decreased rate
of sucrose synthesis. Low levels of F-6-P favors the
breakdown of F-2,6-BP to F-6-P by the enzyme
fructose- 2,6-bisphosphatase (reaction 2). This releases
cytosolic FBPase from inhibition, and favors the
synthesis of F-6-P which, in turn, favors sucrose
synthesis.
ATP). This causes a buildup of the transthylakoid pH,
which in turn inhibits the rate of photosynthetic elec-
tron transport through what is called photosynthetic
control. Photosynthetic control is deﬁned as the regu-
lation of the rate of photosynthetic electron transport by
the transthylakoid pH. Hence, this causes a reduction
in the rate of photosynthetic O2 evolution and ultimately
the rate of CO2 assimilation. Plants exhibiting such an
inhibition of photosynthesis are said to be feedback
limited.
Many of the details remain to be worked out, but it
is clear that starch synthesis in the chloroplast, triose-P
export, and sucrose synthesis in the cytosol are in

156
Chapter 9 / Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning of Photoassimilates
delicate balance. The balance is modulated by very
subtle changes in the level of triose-P and Pi as well as
precise regulation of a number of enzymes and requires
intimate communication between the two cellular com-
partments. Thus, the allocation of ﬁxed carbon to either
starch or sucrose biosynthesis in leaf mesophyll cells
illustrates that these metabolic pathways actually have
a dual role: (1) to provide energy and carbon for growth
and the maintenance of homeostasis and (2) to provide
information with respect to the metabolic status in two
different compartments.
9.3 FRUCTAN BIOSYNTHESIS IS
AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY
FOR CARBON ALLOCATION
In addition to carbon allocation to sucrose and starch,
about 10 percent of terrestrial plant species exhibit the
capacity to allocate carbon to water-soluble fructose
polymers called fructans, which are biosynthesized
in the vacuole. Plants capable of forming vacuolar
fructans include agronomically important crops such
as cereals (wheat, barley, rye), in addition to onion,
garlic, leek, Jerusalem artichoke, and chicory. The most
common form of fructan in these plants is based on the
sequential enzymatic addition of fructose from a donor
sucrose molecule to a sucrose acceptor molecule by
the enzyme sucrose:sucrose fructosyl transferase (SST).
This results in the formation of the trisaccharide,
1-kestose (Equation 9.14), which is composed one of
glucosyl unit linked two fructosyl
Sucrose + sucrose →1-kestose + glucose
(9.14)
units. This trisaccharide is extended by the action of an
additional vacuolar enzyme, fructan:fructan fructosyl
transferase (FFT), which results in the formation
of a polymer of fructose in the form of glucosyl-1,
2-fructosyl-1,2-fructrosy-(fructosyl)N
linked
in
the
1,2-β orientation and where N can vary between 1
(kestose) and 40 (Equation 9.15).
1-Kestose + fructan →glucosyl-1,2-fructosyl-1,
2-fructrosyl-(fructosyl)N
(9.15)
Under conditions where the rate of carbon accu-
mulation exceeds the rate of carbon utilization, sucrose
accumulates and the enzymes of vacuolar fructan
metabolism, SST and FFT, are induced. Thus, it is pre-
sumed that increase in cytosolic sucrose concentrations
trigger the biosynthesis of fructans. The sucrose accu-
mulated in the cytosol is transported to the vacuole and
converted to fructans. Since fructan accumulation can
attain levels as high as 40 percent of the dry weight of
cereals, the biosynthesis of vacuolar fructans represents
an important mechanism for carbon allocation.

As discussed above, plant species such as spinach,
in which starch is the major storage carbohydrate,
the regulatory metabolite, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate,
feedback inhibits the export of triose phosphate from
the chloroplast stroma in response to increases in
cytosolic
sucrose
concentrations.
This
stimulates
starch biosynthesis through the activation of the
enzyme, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and results
in an increase in the starch/sucrose ratio (Table 9.1).
However, this type of feedback inhibition does not
appear to occur in plants such as Lolium temulentum that
convert sucrose to fructans in the vacuole (Table 9.1).
It has been proposed that the apparent insensitivity
of
chloroplast
metabolism
to
cytosolic
sucrose
accumulation in fructan-accumulators may represent
a selective advantage for grasses which evolved in
environments where there were rapid changes in the
balance between the supply of and demand for ﬁxed
carbon due either shading, cool temperatures, perennial
growth habit, or perhaps herbivory. This decreased
sensitivity to feedback limited photosynthesis would
allow fructan-accumulators to maintain higher rates of
CO2 assimilation due to the maintenance of a greater
ﬂux of carbon through the sucrose biosynthetic pathway
than starch accumulators.
9.4 PHOTOASSIMILATES ARE
TRANSLOCATED OVER
LONG DISTANCES
Attempts to distinguish between the translocation of
inorganic and organic substances in plants can be traced
back to the seventeenth-century plant anatomist M.
Malpighi. In his experiments, Malpighi removed a ring
of bark (containing phloem) from the wood (containing
xylem) of young stems by separating the two at the vas-
cular cambium, a technique known as girdling. Because
the woody xylem tissue remained intact, water and inor-
ganic nutrients continued to move up to the leaves and

9.4 Photoassimilates Are Translocated Over Long Distances
157
the plant was able to survive for some time. Girdled
plants, however, developed characteristic swellings of
the bark in the region immediately above the girdle
(Figure 9.5).
Over the years, this experiment has been repeated
and reﬁned to include nonsurgical girdling such as by
localized steam-killing or chilling. The characteristic
swelling is attributed, in part, to an accumulation of
photoassimilate ﬂowing downward, which is blocked
from moving further by removal or otherwise inter-
fering with the activity of the phloem. As we now
know, the downward stream also contains nitrogenous
material and probably hormones that help to stimulate
proliferation and enlargement of cells above the block-
age. Eventually, of course, the root system will starve
from the lack of nutrients and the girdled plant will die.
An analysis of phloem exudate provides more direct
evidence in support of the conclusion that photoassim-
ilates are translocated through the phloem. Unfortu-
nately, phloem tissue does not lend itself to analysis
as easily as xylem tissue does (described in Chapter 2).
This is because the translocating elements in the phloem
are, unlike xylem vessels and tracheids, living cells when
functional. These cells contain a dense, metabolically
active cytoplasm and, because of an inherent sealing
action of its cytoplasm, do not exude their contents
as readily as do xylem vessels. Moreover, phloem con-
tains numerous parenchyma cells that, while not directly
involved in the transport process, do provide contami-
nating cytoplasm. Cutting the stems of some herbaceous

plants will produce an exudate of largely phloem ori-
gin, but in some plants, such as some representatives of
the family Cucurbitaceae, the exudate may quickly gel
on contact with oxygen, making collection and subse-
quent analysis difﬁcult. The gelling of phloem exudate
is due to the properties of a particular phloem protein,
which is described more fully later in this chapter. In
spite of these difﬁculties, however, numerous investi-
gators have successfully completed analyses of phloem
exudates obtained by making incisions into the phloem
tissue, assisted in part by the development of modern
analytical techniques applicable to very small samples.
One intriguing solution to the problem of obtaining
the contents of sieve tubes uncontaminated by other cells
was provided by insect physiologists studying the nutri-
tion of aphids. Aphids are one of several groups of small
insects that feed on plants by inserting a long mouthpart
(the stylus) directly into individual sieve tubes. When
feeding aphids are anaesthetized with a stream of car-
bon dioxide and the stylus carefully severed with a razor
blade, phloem sap continues to exude from the cut stylus
for several days. The aphid technique works well for a
number of herbaceous plants and some woody shrubs,
but it is restricted to those plants on which the aphids
naturally feed. The principal advantage of this technique
is that the severed aphid stylet delivers an uncontam-
inated sieve tube sap. Although the volumes delivered
are relatively low, this technique has proven extremely
useful in studies of phloem transport. The continued
exudation, incidentally, demonstrates that phloem sap is
under pressure, an important observation with respect
to the proposed mechanism for phloem transport to be
discussed later.
The third line of evidence involves the use of
radioactive tracers, predominantly 14C and usually fed to
a leaf. A typical example is the translocation of photoas-
similate in petioles of sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris) leaves.
In these experiments, attached leaves were allowed
to photosynthesize in a closed chamber containing a
radioactive carbon source (14CO2). After 10 minutes,
the radiolabeled photoassimilate being transported out
of the leaf was immobilized by freezing the petiole in liq-
uid nitrogen. Cross sections of the frozen petiole were
prepared and placed in contact with X-ray ﬁlm. The
resulting image on the X-ray ﬁlm, or radioautograph,
indicated that the radioactive photoassimilate being
translocated out of the leaf was localized exclusively
in the phloem (Figure 9.6). Similar experiments have
been conducted on a variety of herbaceous and woody
plants and with other radioactive nuclides, such as phos-
phorous and sulphur, with the same conclusion—the
translocation of photoassimilates and other organic compounds
over long distances occurs through the phloem tissue. There
are exceptions to this rule, such as when stored sugars
are mobilized in the spring of the year and translocated
through the xylem to the developing buds (Chapter 2).

9.4.1 WHAT IS THE COMPOSITION
OF THE PHOTOASSIMILATE
TRANSLOCATED BY THE
PHLOEM?
This question may be answered by analyzing the chem-
ical composition of phloem exudate. Phloem sap can
be collected from aphid stylets or, alternatively, from
some plants by simply making an incision into the bark.
If done carefully, to avoid cutting into the underlying
xylem, the incision opens the sieve tubes and a relatively
pure exudate can be collected in very small microcapil-
lary tubes for subsequent analysis. As might be expected,
the chemical composition of phloem exudate is highly
variable. It depends on the species, age, and physiologi-
cal condition of the tissue sampled. Even for a particular
sample under uniform conditions, there may be wide
variations in the concentrations of particular compo-
nents between subsequent samples. For example, an
analysis of phloem exudate from stems of actively grow-
ing castor bean (Ricinus communis) (Table 9.2) shows that
the exudate contains sugars, protein, amino acids, the
organic acid malate, and a variety of inorganic anions
and cations. The predominant amino acids are glutamic
acid and aspartic acid, which are common forms for
the translocation of assimilated nitrogen (Chapter 11).
The inorganic anions include phosphate, sulphate,
and
chloride—nitrate
is
conspicuously
absent—
while the predominant cation is potassium. Although
not shown in Table 9.1, some plant hormones (auxin,
cytokinin, and gibberellin) were also detected, but
at very low concentrations. Of course, many of the
components identiﬁed in phloem exudate—inorganic
ions, for example—are cytoplasmic constituents of the
translocating cells and do not necessarily represent
translocated photoassimilate. Protein found in phloem
exudates includes a wide variety of enzymes as well
as one predominant protein (called P-protein) that is
unique to the translocating cells. We will return to a
discussion of P-protein later in this chapter.

Data from Hall and Baker, 1972.
The principal constituent of phloem exudate in
most species is sugar. In castor bean it is sucrose, which
comprises approximately 80 percent of the dry matter
(Table 9.2). Such a preponderance of sucrose in the
translocation stream strongly suggests that it is the
predominant form of translocatable photoassimilate.
This suggestion has been amply conﬁrmed by labeling
experiments. In the example of translocation in sugar-
beet petioles described earlier, more than 90 percent of
the radioactivity, following 10 minutes of labeling with
14CO2, was recovered as sucrose. There are exceptions
to this rule—one is the squash family (Cucurbitaceae),
where
nitrogenous
compounds
(principally
amino
acids) are quantitatively more important—but overall
sugar, particularly sucrose, accounts for the bulk
of the translocated carbon. A survey of over 500
species representing approximately 100 dicotyledonous
families conﬁrms that sucrose is almost universal as the
dominant sugar in the phloem stream.
A small number of families translocate, in addition
to sucrose, oligosaccharides of the rafﬁnose series (rafﬁ-
nose, stachyose, or verbascose) (Figure 9.7). Stachyose,
for example, accounts for about 46 percent of the sug-
ars in stem internodes of Cucurbita maxima. Yet other
families (Oleaceae, Rosaceae) translocate some of their
photoassimilates as the sugar alcohols mannitol or sor-
bitol.
It is interesting to speculate on why sucrose is
the preferred vehicle for long-distance translocation
of photoassimilate. One possibility is that sucrose, a
disaccharide, and its related oligosaccharides are nonre-
ducing sugars. On the other hand, all monosaccharides,
including glucose and fructose, are reducing sugars.
Reducing sugars have a free aldehyde or ketone group
that is capable of reducing mild oxidizing agents. Some
oligosaccharides, such as sucrose, are nonreducing sugars
because the acetal link between the subunits is stable
and nonreactive in alkaline solution. The exclusive use

of nonreducing sugars in the translocation of photoas-
similate may be related to this greater chemical stability.
Nonreducing sugars are less likely to react with other
substances along the way. Indeed, free glucose and fruc-
tose, both reducing sugars, are rarely found in phloem
exudates. The occasional report of reducing sugars in
phloem exudate probably indicates contamination by
nonconducting phloem cells, where reducing sugars
are readily formed by hydrolysis of sucrose or other
oligosaccharides.
A second possible factor is that the β-fructoside link-
age between glucose and fructose, a feature of sucrose
and other members of the rafﬁnose series, has a rela-
tively high negative free energy of hydrolysis—about
−27 kJ mol−1 compared with about −31 kJ mol−1 for
ATP. Sucrose is thus a small and highly mobile but
relatively stable packet of energy, which may account
for its ‘‘selection’’ as the principal form of assimilate to
be translocated in most plants.
9.5 SIEVE ELEMENTS ARE THE
PRINCIPAL CELLULAR
CONSTITUENTS OF
THE PHLOEM
The distinguishing feature of phloem tissue is the con-
ducting cell called the sieve element. Also known as a
sieve tube, the sieve element is an elongated rank of
individual cells, called sieve-tube members, arranged
end-to-end (Figure 9.8). Unlike xylem tracheary ele-
ments, phloem sieve elements lack rigid walls and
contain living protoplasts when mature and functional.
The protoplasts of contiguous sieve elements are inter-
connected through specialized sieve areas in adjacent
walls. Where the pores of the sieve area are relatively
large and are found grouped in a speciﬁc area, they
are known as sieve plates (Figure 9.8). Sieve plates are
typically found in the end walls of sieve-tube members
and provide a high degree of protoplasmic continuity
between consecutive sieve-tube members. Additional
pores are found in sieve areas located in lateral walls.
These are generally smaller and are not, as a rule,
grouped in distinct areas. These sieve areas nonetheless
provide cytoplasmic continuity through the lateral walls
of adjacent sieve elements.

Chapter 9 / Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning of Photoassimilates
As noted earlier, mature sieve elements contain
active cytoplasm. However, as the sieve element
matures, it undergoes a series of progressive changes
that result in the breakdown and loss of the nucleus, the
vacuolar membrane (or tonoplast), ribosomes, the Golgi
apparatus (or dictyosomes), as well as microtubules and
ﬁlaments. At maturity, the cells retain the plasmalemma,
and endoplasmic reticulum (although it is somewhat
modiﬁed), and mitochondria. Even though there is no
central vacuole as such, the cytoplasmic components
appear to assume a parietal position in the cell, that is,
along the inner wall of the cell.
In addition to sieve elements, phloem tissue also
contains a variety of parenchyma cells. Some of these
cells are intimately associated with the sieve-tube mem-
bers and for this reason are called companion cells.
Companion cells (Figure 9.8) contain a full comple-
ment of cytoplasm and cellular organelles. A companion
cell is derived from the same mother cell as its associ-
ated sieve-tube member and shares numerous cytoplas-
mic connections with it. The interdependence of the
sieve-tube member and companion cell is reﬂected in
their lifetimes—the companion cell remains alive only
so long as the sieve-tube member continues to function.
When the sieve-tube member dies, its associated com-
panion cell also dies. Companion cells are believed to
provide metabolic support for the sieve-tube member
and, perhaps, are involved in the transport of sucrose or
other sugars into the sieve tube.
The rest of the phloem parenchyma cells are not
always readily distinguishable from companion cells,
even at the ultrastructural level. The single exception is
found in the minor leaf veins of some plants, typically of
herbaceous dicotyledonous plants. Here certain phloem
parenchyma cells develop extensive ingrowths of the cell
wall. The result is a signiﬁcant increase in the surface
area of the plasma membrane. These cells are called
transfer cells. The precise role of transfer cells is not
understood but, as the name implies, they are thought to
be involved in collecting and passing on photoassimilates
produced in nearby mesophyll cells. They may also be
involved in recycling solutes that enter the apoplast from
the transpiration stream. These proposed functions are
speculative, based largely on the assumption that the
high protoplasmic surface area would be expected to
facilitate solute exchange between the transfer cell and
the surrounding apoplast.
9.5.1 PHLOEM EXUDATE CONTAINS
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF PROTEIN
In the early stages of sieve element differentiation,
phloem protein (P-protein) appears in the form of dis-
crete protein bodies. As the sieve elements mature, the
P-protein bodies continue to enlarge. At the time the
nucleus, vacuole, and other cellular organelles disappear,
the P-protein bodies disperse in the cytoplasm. In some
species, such as maple (Acer rubrum), the P-protein takes
the form of a loose network of ﬁlaments, ranging from
2 to 20 nm in width. In others, such as tobacco (Nicotiana
sps.), the ﬁlaments appear tubular in cross-section. In
yet others, such as some leguminous plants, P-protein
takes the form of crystalline inclusions.
Biochemical investigations of phloem proteins
began in the early 1970s, principally in exudates of
Cucurbita. Some caution must be exercised when inter-
preting these results, however, since phloem exudates
contain proteins in addition to P-protein. Using the
technique of sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Chapter 7), a variety
of polypeptide subunits with molecular mass values
ranging from 15 to 220 kD have been reported.
Apparently phloem protein varies widely between
species, with respect to both its subunit composition
and its chemical properties. One particularly interesting
property of phloem protein is its capacity to form a gel.
Gelation could be prevented by 2-mercaptoethanol,
a reducing agent that prevents formation of inter-
molecular disulﬁde (—S—S—) bonds. The effect of
reducing agent is fully reversible—removal of the
2-mercaptoethanol allows gelling to proceed. This
effect was traced to a single basic protein in the
phloem exudate. This protein probably accounts for
the propensity of certain phloem exudates, such as from
Cucurbita, to gel rapidly on exposure to air.
P-protein has been the subject of considerable atten-
tion over the years because of its prominence in sieve
elements and its propensity to plug the pores in the sieve
plates. Still, its role and that of other phloem-speciﬁc
proteins is not yet clear. P-protein has been implicated in
various ways in the transport function of sieve elements.
According to some theories, P-protein is considered
an active participant in the transport process. At the
same time, the presence of P-protein in sieve elements
is invoked as an argument against other theories. It is
now generally accepted that, in intact, functioning sieve
elements, P-protein is located principally along the inner
wall of the sieve element and does not plug the sieve
plate.
The formation of plugs in the sieve plates occurs
only when the sieve element is injured. This occurs
because the sieve element is normally under positive
hydrostatic pressure, as evidenced by the continued
ﬂow of exudate from aphid stylets. When the pressure
is released through injury to the sieve element, the
contents, including P-protein, surge toward the site of
injury. This results in the accumulation of P-protein,
possibly assisted by its gelling properties, as ‘‘slime’’
plugs on the side of the sieve plate away from the pressure
release. Thus, it appears that at least one function of
P-protein is protective. By sealing off sieve plates in areas

9.7 Phloem Translocation Occurs by Mass Transfer
161
where the integrity of the phloem has been breached,
P-protein helps to maintain the positive hydrostatic
pressure in the phloem and reduce unnecessary loss of
translocated photoassimilate.
Another prominent and somewhat controversial
feature of sieve elements is the presence of callose.
Callose, a β1→3-glucan, is related to starch and cel-
lulose. Small amounts of callose are deposited on the
surface of the sieve plate or line the pores through which
the interconnecting strands of cytoplasm pass between
contiguous cells (Figure 9.8). Controversy over the role
of callose arises from the frequent observation that cal-
lose appears to accumulate in the pores to the extent that
it would appear to interfere with translocation. How-
ever, it is now known that callose can be synthesized
very rapidly (within a matter of seconds) and, similar to
P-protein, will accumulate in the sieve area in response
to injury. Large amounts of callose also appear to be
deposited on the sieve plates of older, nonfunctional
sieve elements. In both cases, the function of callose
appears to be one of sealing off sieve elements that have
been injured or are no longer functional, thus preserving
the integrity of the translocating system.
9.6 DIRECTION OF
TRANSLOCATION IS
DETERMINED BY
SOURCE-SINK
RELATIONSHIPS
Identiﬁcation of an organ or tissue as a source or sink
depends on the direction of its net assimilate transport.
An organ or tissue that produces more assimilate than it
requires for its own metabolism and growth is a source. A
source is thus a net exporter or producer of photoassim-
ilate; that is, it exports more assimilate than it imports.
Mature leaves and other actively photosynthesizing tis-
sues are the predominant sources in most plants. A sink,
on the other hand, is a net importer or consumer of pho-
toassimilate. Roots, stem tissues, and developing fruits
are examples of organs and tissues that normally function
as sinks. The underlying principle of phloem translocation is
that photoassimilates are translocated from a source to a sink.
Sink organs may respire the photoassimilate, use it to
build cytoplasm and cellular structure, or place it into
storage as starch or other carbohydrate.
Any organ, at one time or another in its devel-
opment, will function as a sink and may undergo a
conversion from sink to source. Leaves are an excel-
lent example. In its early stages of development a leaf
will function as a sink, drawing photoassimilates from
older leaves to support its active metabolism and rapid
enlargement. However, as a leaf approaches maximum
size and its growth rate slows, its own metabolic demands
diminish and it will gradually switch over to a net
exporter. The mature leaf then serves as a source of
photoassimilate for sinks elsewhere in the plant. The
conversion of a leaf from sink to source is a gradual
process, paralleling the progressive maturation of leaf
tissue. In simple leaves, for example, the export of pho-
toassimilate from mature regions of the leaf may begin
while other regions are still developing and functioning
as sinks. In compound leaves, such as ash (Fraxinus
pennsylvanica) and honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos),
the early maturing basal leaﬂets may export photoas-
similate to the still-developing distal leaﬂets as well as
out of the leaf.
9.7 PHLOEM TRANSLOCATION
OCCURS BY MASS TRANSFER
What is the mechanism for assimilate translocation over
long distances through the phloem? Any comprehensive
theory must take into account a number of factors. These
include: (1) the structure of sieve elements, including
the presence of active cytoplasm, P-protein, and resis-
tances imposed by sieve plates; (2) observed rapid rates
of translocation (50 to 250 cm hr−1) over long distances;
(3) translocation in different directions at the same time;
(4) the initial transfer of assimilate from leaf meso-
phyll cells into sieve elements of the leaf minor veins
(called phloem loading); and (5) ﬁnal transfer of assim-
ilate out of the sieve elements into target cells (called
phloem unloading). Phloem loading and unloading will
be discussed in the following section.
At various times assimilate transport has been
explained in terms of simple diffusion, cytoplasmic
streaming, ion pumps operating across the sieve plate,
and contractile elements in the transcellular protoplas-
mic strands. All of these proposals have been largely
rejected on both theoretical and experimental grounds.
The most credible and generally accepted model
for phloem translocation is one of the earliest. Orig-
inally proposed by E. M¨unch in 1930 but modiﬁed
by a series of investigators since, the pressure-ﬂow
hypothesis remains the simplest model and continues to
earn widespread support among plant physiologists. The
pressure-ﬂow mechanism is based on the mass transfer
of solute from source to sink along a hydrostatic (turgor)
pressure gradient (Figure 9.9). Translocation of solute
in the phloem is closely linked to the ﬂow of water in
the transpiration stream and a continuous recirculation
of water in the plant (Chapter 2).
Assimilate translocation begins with the loading
of sugars into sieve elements at the source. Typically,
loading would occur in the minor veins of a leaf, close
to a photosynthetic mesophyll or bundle-sheath cell.
The increased solute concentration in the sieve element
lowers its water potential (Chapter 1) and, consequently,

FIGURE 9.9 A diagram of pressure ﬂow. The loading of
sugar into the sieve element adjacent to a source cell
causes the osmotic uptake of water from nearby xylem
elements. The uptake of water increases the hydrostatic
(turgor) pressure in the sieve element. The pressure is
lowered at the sink end when sugar is unloaded into the
receiver cell and the water returns to the xylem. This
pressure differential causes a ﬂow of water from the
source region to the sink. Sugar is carried passively along.
is accompanied by the osmotic uptake of water from
the nearby xylem. This establishes a higher turgor or
hydrostatic pressure (Chapter 1) in the sieve element at
the source end. At the same time, sugar is unloaded at
the sink end—a root or stem storage cell, for example.
The hydrostatic pressure at the sink end is lowered as
water leaves the sieve elements and returns to the xylem.
So long as assimilates continue to be loaded at the source
and unloaded at the sink, this pressure differential will
be maintained, water will continue to move in at the
source and out at the sink, and assimilate will be carried
passively along.
According to the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis, solute
translocation in the phloem is fundamentally a passive
process; that is, translocation requires no direct input
of metabolic energy to make it function. Yet for years
it has been observed that translocation of assimilates
was sensitive to metabolic inhibitors, temperature, and
other conditions, suggesting that metabolic energy was
required. More recent experiments, however, have been
designed to discriminate between energy requirements
for the actual movement of assimilate within the sieve
elements and the global energy requirements for translo-
cation from source to sink. The results are clear. The
effects of low temperature and metabolic inhibitors are
either transient or cause disruption of the P-protein
and plug the sieve plates. Energy requirements for
translocation within the sieve elements are therefore
minimal and compatible with the passive character of
the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis. The energy requirement
indicated in earlier translocation experiments no doubt
reﬂected the needs for loading and unloading the sieve
elements.
The principle of pressure ﬂow can be easily demon-
strated in the laboratory by connecting two osmometers
(Figure 9.10), but a simple physical demonstration does
not in itself prove the hypothesis. A number of ques-
tions must be answered. First, is the sieve tube under
pressure? The prolonged exudation of phloem sap from
excised aphid stylets clearly demonstrates that it is. The
total volume of exudate may exceed the volume of an
individual sieve tube by several thousand times. It is dif-
ﬁcult to measure the turgor pressure of individual sieve

FIGURE 9.10 A physical model of the pressure-ﬂow
hypothesis for translocation in the phloem. Two
osmometers are constructed from side-arm ﬂasks and
dialysis tubing. Osmometer A (the source) initially
contains a concentrated sucrose solution and a dye.
Osmometer B (the sink) contains only water. The two
osmometers are connected by capillary tubing (the ph-
loem). Water moves into osmometer A by osmosis, gen-
erating a hydrostatic pressure that forces water out of
osmometer B. Water returns via the tubing (the xylem)
that connects the side-arm ﬂasks. As a consequence of
the ﬂow of water between the two ends of the system,
the sucrose-dye solution ﬂows through the capillary from
osmometer A to osmometer B. In the model, the system
will come to equilibrium and ﬂow will cease when the
sucrose concentration is equal in the two osmometers.
In the plant, ﬂow is maintained because sucrose is con-
tinually added to the source (A) and withdrawn at the
sink (B).

9.8 Phloem Loading and Unloading Regulate Translocation and Partitioning

elements, although a number of attempts have been
made over the years. Turgor pressure can be calculated
as the difference between sieve tube water potential ()
and osmotic potential (s) (Chapter 1), or it may be
measured directly by inserting a small pressure-sensing
device, or micromanometer, into the phloem tissue. For
example, the turgor pressure in willow saplings can be
measured by sealing a closed glass capillary over a sev-
ered aphid stylet. Pressure is calculated from the ratio
of the compressed and uncompressed air columns in
the capillary. As might be expected, values reported in
the literature range widely, depending on the method
chosen, plant material, the time of day, and physiolog-
ical status of the subject plant. Whether calculated or
measured directly, values of 0.1 MPa to 2.5 MPa are
typical.
A second question to be addressed is whether dif-
ferences in sugar concentration and the turgor pressure
drop in the sieve tube are sufﬁcient to account for the
measured rates of transport. Sugar concentration is, of
course, highly variable, depending on the rate of photo-
synthesis and the general physiological condition of the
plant. However, most studies have conﬁrmed that the
sugar content of phloem exudate taken near the source is
higher than in exudates taken near sinks. It has been cal-
culated that a pressure drop of about 0.06 MPa m−1
would be required for a 10 percent sucrose solution to
ﬂow at 100 cm hr−1 through a sieve tube with a radius
of 12 μm. In these calculations, the resistance offered
by sieve plates was taken into account by assuming that
(1) the area of the pores in the sieve plate was equal to
one-half the area of the sieve tube, (2) there were 60 sieve
plates per cm of sieve tube, and (3) the sieve plate pores
were not blocked. Assuming that the turgor pressure of
sieve tubes in the source regions is typically in the range
1.0 to 1.5 MPa, and that it is zero in the sink (which may
not be true), a pressure drop of 0.06 MPa m−1 would
be sufﬁcient to push a solution through the sieve tubes
over a distance of 15 to 25 m. Flow over longer distances
could be accomplished if the source sucrose concen-
tration were higher and/or the ﬂow rate were reduced.
For example, assimilates can move from the source to
the sink, at a velocity of 48 cm hr−1. A pressure drop
of 0.2 MPa would be required to achieve this velocity if
the sieve plate pores were completely open. From the
sucrose concentration in the source and sink, it can be
calculated that the actual pressure drop was 0.44 MPa,
twice that required! A pressure drop of 0.44 MPa would
be sufﬁcient to accomplish a velocity of 48 cm hr−1 even
if the pores were only 70 to 75 percent open.
Another question that is frequently raised in dis-
cussions of the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis is that of
bidirectional transport. The translocation of assimi-
lates simultaneously in opposite directions would at ﬁrst
seem incompatible with the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis,
but it does occur. Bidirectional transport is ﬁrst of all
a logical necessity. At any one time, plants will likely
have more than one sink being served by the same
source—roots for metabolism and storage and devel-
oping apical meristems or ﬂowers, for example. It is
also easy to demonstrate experimentally the movement
of radiolabeled carbon and phosphorous in opposite
directions through the same internode or petiole at the
same time. This observation might easily be explained
by movement through two separate vascular bundles or
even through different sieve tubes in the same bundle.
As long as the sieve elements are connected to different
sinks, the pressure-ﬂow hypothesis does not require that
translocation occur in the same direction or even at the
same velocity at any one time.
Finally, it has often been argued that sieve elements,
because of their structure and composition, offer a sub-
stantial resistance to ﬂow and that pressure-ﬂow might
not provide sufﬁcient force to overcome this resistance.
In this regard it is important to note once again that
the sieve plates in functioning sieve tubes are not occluded
by either P-protein or callose. The presence of viscous
cytoplasm and sieve plates undoubtedly imposes some
resistance, but a variety of experiments have indicated
that the capacity of the phloem to translocate assimilates
is not normally a limiting factor in the growth of sinks.
The phloem is a ﬂexible system for translocation. It
is easily capable of bypassing localized regions of high
resistance and the hydrostatic pressure can be adjusted in
response to demand at either the source or sink. There
are even developmental controls, apparently to ensure
that the phloem is adequately ‘‘sized’’ to meet antici-
pated demand. In wheat, for example, both the number
and size of the vascular bundles serving a ﬂoral head cor-
relates with the number of ﬂowers. Thus, although there
is little, if any, direct proof for the pressure-ﬂow hypoth-
esis, on the balance of evidence it is strongly favored.
9.8 PHLOEM LOADING AND
UNLOADING REGULATE
TRANSLOCATION AND
PARTITIONING
A discussion of phloem translocation is not complete
without considering how assimilates are translocated
from the photosynthetic mesophyll cells into the sieve
elements at the source end (phloem loading) or from
the sieve elements into the target cells at the sink end
(phloem unloading).
9.8.1 PHLOEM LOADING CAN
OCCUR SYMPLASTICALLY
OR APOPLASTICALLY
The path traversed by assimilate from the site of pho-
tosynthesis to the sieve element is not long. Most

mesophyll cells are within a few tenths of a mm,
at most three or four cells’ distance from a minor
vein ending where loading of assimilate into the sieve
element-companion cell complex (se-cc) actually
occurs.1 It is generally agreed that sucrose moves from
the mesophyll cells to the phloem, probably phloem
parenchyma cells, principally by diffusion through the
plasmodesmata (i.e., the symplasm). At this point, the
pathway becomes less certain and the subject of some
debate. From the phloem parenchyma there are two
possible routes into the se-cc complex (Figure 9.11).
Sucrose may continue through the symplasm—that is,
through plasmodesmata—directly into the se-cc com-
plex. This route is known as the symplastic pathway.
Alternatively, the sugar may be transported across the
mesophyll cell membrane and released into the cell wall
solution (i.e., the apoplasm). From there it would be
taken up across the membrane of the se-cc complex
where it enters the long-distance transport stream. This
route is known as the apoplastic pathway.
The apoplastic model for phloem loading gained
favor in the mid-1970s, based largely on studies of
translocation in sugarbeet leaves. D. R. Geiger and his
coworkers used leaves that had been abraded with car-
borundum to remove the cuticle, thus improving access
to the leaf apoplast. They found that radioactive sucrose
appeared in the apoplast following a period of photosyn-
thesis in the presence of 14CO2. They also found that
exogenously supplied sugar was readily absorbed into
the se-cc complex when abraded leaves were bathed in a
solution containing 14C-sucrose. These results indicate
that sucrose is normally found in the apoplast and can be
taken into the sieve elements from the apoplast. Phloem
loading in some plants is also inhibited by chemicals
such as p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid (PCMBS)
when applied to abraded leaves or leaf disks. PCMBS
and certain other sulfhydryl-speciﬁc reagents presum-
ably interfere with carrier proteins (Chapter 3) involved
in the transport of sucrose across the plasma mem-
branes. Because these reagents do not penetrate the cell
membrane, any effect they have must be localized on
the apoplastic surface of the membrane.
Sucrose and other sugars are selectively loaded into
the se-cc complex against a concentration gradient,
which usually implies active transport. In addition, there
is an increasingly large body of evidence supporting the
existence, in plant cells generally and phloem loading in
particular, of a sucrose-uptake mechanism that is both
ATP-dependent and linked to the uptake of protons;
that is, a sugar-H+ cotransport (Figure 9.12). This con-
1It is not technically possible to discriminate between the
respective roles of the companion cell and the sieve element
in phloem loading and unloading experiments. For this
reason, the sieve element and companion cells are considered
as a single se-cc complex.

way 1, the symplastic pathway, sugar moves through
plasmodesmata that connect the protoplasts of the
source cell and the sieve element. In pathway 2, the
apoplastic pathway, sugar is released into the cell wall

clusion is supported by the observation that sugar uptake
is accompanied by an increase in pH (i.e., a depletion
of protons) or polarity changes in the apoplast. Con-
versely, if the pH is experimentally increased—that is,
protons are removed from the apoplast by inﬁltrating the
apoplast of abraded leaves with a basic buffer—uptake
into the phloem cells will be inhibited. Finally, in most
cases it can be shown that only sugars taken up into

the se-cc complex and translocated in the sieve elements
will elicit pH responses. Other sugars, which are not
normally taken up by the phloem, elicit no pH changes.
In summary, much of the evidence is consistent with an
apoplastic pathway for phloem loading, by which sugars
ﬁrst pass from mesophyll or phloem parenchyma cells
into the leaf apoplast. The sugar is subsequently taken
up into the se-cc complex by sugar-H+ symport, to be
translocated out of the source region.
Although the exact nature of the sucrose-H+ sym-
port carrier is not yet worked out, genes (SUT1, SUC2)
coding for the carrier have been identiﬁed and cloned
from several species. These include spinach (Spinacea
oleraceae), potato (Solanum tuberosum), Plantago major,
and Arabidopsis thaliana. In several species, expression
of the SUC2 sucrose carrier gene appears limited to
the companion cells, while in potato the SUT1 gene
product was located in the plasma membrane of the
sieve elements but could not be detected within the
companion cells. Such conﬂicting results might suggest
that apoplastic loading occurs differently in different
species or, alternatively, that different carriers are active
in companion cells and sieve elements.
In spite of the strong evidence in support of an
apoplastic pathway for phloem loading, there are other
data that support transport through the symplast. Much
of the data from sucrose feeding experiments, for
example, indicate that a signiﬁcant proportion—up to
60 percent—of the radioactive sucrose can be detected
in leaf mesophyll cells. This leaves the experiments
open to an alternate interpretation: that sucrose-H+
cotransport exists as a mechanism for retrieving sucrose
that has leaked from the photosynthetic cells into
the apoplast. Such a retrieval mechanism would not
discriminate between sugar that leaked from mesophyll,
or possibly the se-cc complex, and sugar that was
supplied exogenously by the experimenter. If such
leakage does occur, a mechanism for retrieval would
serve to prevent unnecessary loss of sugar from the
transport stream. Indeed it has been postulated that a
leakage-retrieval cycle occurs normally along the entire
length of the translocation path.
If the uptake data do reﬂect retrieval by mesophyll
cells rather than phloem loading, one is left with the
conclusion that phloem loading occurs via the symplastic
pathway. Several laboratories have presented evidence
that appears to offer further support for this hypothesis.
When mesophyll cells of Ipomea tricolor are injected with
a ﬂuorescent dye, the dye moves readily into neighbor-
ing mesophyll cells and appears in the minor veins within
25 minutes. Since the dye is water-soluble and unable to
cross membranes, it is assumed that the dye traveled into
the minor veins via the symplastic connection between
cells. It is also of interest that much of the data sup-
porting apoplastic loading have come from experiments
with one species: sugarbeet. In a recent survey, plants
were selected on the basis of whether they had abun-
dant symplastic connections between the se-cc complex
and adjacent cells of the minor veins, or whether these
cells were symplastically isolated, that is, had no symplas-
tic connections. Those plants whose se-cc complexes
were symplastically isolated exhibited characteristics of
apoplastic loading, while those with abundant symplas-
tic connections exhibited characteristics of symplastic
loading.
The concept of symplastic loading does, however,
raise some questions. For example, if sugars diffuse
freely from the mesophyll into the se-cc complex, they
should be equally free to diffuse back into the mesophyll
cells. How, then, is it possible for the se-cc complex
to accumulate sugars by simple diffusion through the
plasmodesmata? Based on studies of phloem loading in
Cucurbita sps., a polymer trap model to account for
symplastic loading has been proposed. Species, such
as the cucurbits, which have abundant plasmodesmata
connections with the se-cc complex and appear to load
symplastically, also translocate oligosaccharides in the
rafﬁnose series. According to the polymer trap model,
sucrose diffuses from the mesophyll or bundle-sheath
cells into the companion cells through the connecting
plasmodesmata. In the companion cell, the sucrose is
converted to an oligosaccharide, such as the tetrasaccha-
ride stachyose, which is too large to diffuse back through
the plasmodesmata. The polymer (i.e., stachyose) thus
remains ‘‘trapped’’ in the se-cc complex, to be carried
away by mass ﬂow.
The symplastic model assumes that the plasmodes-
mata limit the passage of large molecules, but this may
not be the case. Several recent studies of the sucrose
transporter gene have indicated that both the transporter
protein and its mRNA are able to pass through plasmod-
esmata between companion cells and sieve elements. If
macromolecules can pass through plasmodesmata, it is
difﬁcult to imagine why small oligosaccharides cannot.
Perhaps plasmodesmata are more than simple tubes
allowing solute ﬂux between cells. This is an exciting
issue that will no doubt receive considerable attention
in the future.
Why there is more than one pathway for phlo-
em loading is not clear. The symplastic pathway
appears to have an energetic advantage by avoiding
two
carrier-dependent
membrane
transport
steps.
The observed energy dependence of loading and
translocation, however, is more readily explained by
the apoplastic model. In the sympastic model, on the
other hand, energy is required for the synthesis of
oligosaccharides in the companion cells. It has also been
suggested that species employing the symplastic pathway
are more ancestral or that the apoplastic pathway is an
evolutionary adaptation that arose as plants spread from
tropical climates into more temperate regions. The new
molecular approaches now available will no doubt allow

166
Chapter 9 / Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning of Photoassimilates
investigators to discriminate between available options.
It may be that there is no universal pathway but that the
path of phloem loading is family- or species-speciﬁc.
Given the theoretical and potential practical signiﬁcance
of phloem loading in determining yields, we can expect
the investigation and debate to continue.
9.8.2 PHLOEM UNLOADING MAY
OCCUR SYMPLASTICALLY
OR APOPLASTICALLY
Once assimilate has reached its target sink, it must be
unloaded from the se-cc complex into the cells of the
sink tissue. In principle, the problem is similar to load-
ing; only the direction varies. In detail there are some
signiﬁcant differences. As with phloem loading, phloem
unloading may occur via symplastic or apoplastic routes
(see Figure 9.13). The symplastic route (pathway 1)
has been described predominantly in young, developing
leaves and root tips. Sucrose ﬂows, via interconnecting
plasmodesmata, down a concentration gradient from the
se-cc complex to sites of metabolism in the sink. The
gradient and, consequently, ﬂow into the sink cell is
maintained by hydrolyzing the sucrose to glucose and
fructose.
There are two possible apoplastic routes, shown as
pathways 2 and 3 in Figure 9.13. Pathway 2, which has
been studied most extensively in the storage parenchyma
cells of sugarcane, involves the release of sucrose from
the se-cc complex into the apoplast. Release is insensitive
to metabolic inhibitors or PCMBS and therefore does
not involve an energy-dependent carrier. Once in the
apoplast, sucrose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acid
invertase, which is tightly bound to the cell wall and
catalyzes the reaction:
Sucrose + H2O →glucose + fructose
(9.16)
This reaction is essentially irreversible and the hydroly-
sis products, glucose and fructose, are actively taken up
by the sink cell. Once in the cell, they are again combined
as sucrose and actively transported into the vacuole for
storage. Hydrolysis of sucrose in the apoplast, perhaps
combined with the irreversibility of the acid invertase
reaction, serves to maintain the gradient and allows
the unloading to continue. This pathway seems to be
prominent in seeds of maize, sorghum, and pearl millet.
The third pathway for phloem unloading indicates
that, at least in legumes, sucrose is unloaded into the
apoplast by an energy-dependent carrier. The nature
of the carrier has not been conclusively identiﬁed,
but evidence to date suggests it is probably the same
sucrose-H+ cotransporter described earlier. As with
phloem loading, there does not appear to be a uni-
versal path for phloem unloading into the developing
embryo.

9.9 PHOTOASSIMILATE IS
DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN
DIFFERENT METABOLIC
PATHWAYS AND PLANT
ORGANS
Some of the newly ﬁxed carbon or photoassimilate
in a source leaf is retained within the leaf, and the
rest is distributed to various nonphotosynthetic tissues
and organs. This raises several interesting questions.
What, for example, determines how much carbon is
retained and in what form? What determines how much
is exported and to where? What determines how much
assimilate, for example, is exported to the roots of a
wheat or corn plant and how much is translocated to
ﬁll the developing grain? Questions of this sort have
been receiving increasing attention of late, because the
patterns of distribution, or more to the point, regulation
of the distribution patterns is highly signiﬁcant with
respect to productivity and yield (Chapter 12). One
maize farmer may wish to maximize grain yield while
another may require more of the carbon be put into pro-
duction of vegetative (i.e., leafy) material. Each farmer
will assess the harvest index (the ratio of usable plant
material to total biomass) for the crop in a different way.

9.9 Photoassimilate Is Distributed Between Different Metabolic Pathways and Plant Organs
167
The traditional route to improving harvest index
has been through breeding and selection. The uncul-
tivated progenitors of modern-day wheat and maize,
for example, produced sparse heads with small seeds.
Centuries of agricultural selection and, in the last cen-
tury, careful breeding, have been required to produce
the high-yielding wheat and maize varieties in use
today. However, the more we learn about the fac-
tors regulating carbon distribution and utilization, the
greater the prospects for using modern genetic meth-
ods to manipulate the harvest index. The distribution
of photoassimilate occurs at two levels: allocation and
partitioning. Each of these will be discussed in turn.
9.9.1 PHOTOASSIMILATES MAY BE
ALLOCATED TO A VARIETY
OF METABOLIC FUNCTIONS
IN THE SOURCE OR THE SINK
Allocation refers to the metabolic fate of carbon either
newly assimilated in the source leaf or delivered to a
sink. At the source, there are three principal uses for
photoassimilate: leaf metabolism and maintenance of
leaf biomass, short-term storage, or export to other
parts of the plant.
9.9.1.1 Leaf metabolism and biomass
Some of
the carbon will be allocated to the immediate metabolic
needs of the leaf itself. These needs include the main-
tenance of cell structure, synthesis of additional leaf
biomass, and the maintenance of the photosynthetic sys-
tem itself. Most of this carbon is metabolized through
respiration, which provides both the energy and car-
bon skeletons necessary to support ongoing synthetic
activities.
9.9.1.2 Storage
Under normal light–dark regimes,
plants face a dilemma—photosynthesis is restricted to
the daylight hours, but a supply of photoassimilate for
growth must be maintained over the entire 24 hours. A
partial solution to this dilemma is to allocate a portion
of the newly ﬁxed carbon for storage in the leaves. Most
plants, especially dicots, store the bulk of their carbon as
starch, with a smaller amount stored as sucrose. Some,
such as barley (Hordeum vulgare), sugarcane (Saccharum
spontaneum), and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris), accumulate
little if any starch but store carbon primarily as sucrose
in the vacuoles of leaf, stem, or root cells, respectively.
Many grasses accumulate fructose polymers called fruc-
tans. Carbon stored in the leaves serves primarily as
a buffer against ﬂuctuations in metabolite levels and is
available for reallocation to metabolism when required.
Alternatively, most plants appear to be programmed
to maintain a fairly constant rate of translocation and
supply to sink tissues. Leaf reserves are therefore avail-
able for reallocation to export at night or during periods
of stress when photosynthesis is very low. In plants that
store both starch and sucrose, there are generally two
pools of sucrose, one in the cytoplasm and one in the
vacuole. The vacuolar pool, which is larger and turns
over more slowly than the cytoplasmic pool, is the ﬁrst
source of sucrose for export at night. Only when the
vacuolar pool is depleted will the starch, stored in the
chloroplast, be mobilized for export.
9.9.1.3 Export from the leaf
Normally about half
the newly assimilated carbon is allocated for immediate
export from the leaf via the phloem. In many plants, a
portion of this exported carbon may be stored along the
translocation path. As in the leaf, this stored carbohy-
drate helps to buffer the carbon supply at times when
the rate of translocation through the phloem might
otherwise be reduced.
Regulating the allocation of photoassimilate is a
complex process, involving the interactions of a number
of metabolic pathways. Allocation within a source leaf
is to a large extent genetically programmed but there is
a strong developmental component. Young leaves, for
example, retain a large proportion of their newly ﬁxed
carbon for growth, but as leaves mature the proportion
allocated for export increases. In soybean leaves there
are corresponding changes in the activities of enzymes
such as acid invertase (Chapter 10) and sucrose synthase
(Equation 9.11). The activities of these two degradative
enzymes are highest in young, rapidly expanding leaves,
which no doubt reﬂects the need to metabolize sucrose
in the early stages of leaf development when the leaf is
functioning primarily as a sink.
As a leaf matures and becomes photosynthetically
self-sufﬁcient, both its need and capacity to import
assimilate decline and the metabolism of the leaf switches
over to the synthesis of sucrose for export. There is a
corresponding decline in the activities of acid invertase
and sucrose synthase and a steady increase in the activity
of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), a key enzyme in
the synthesis of sucrose (Equation 9.6). Because sucrose
is the predominant form of translocated carbohydrate
and SPS activity is closely correlated with sucrose pro-
duction, the increase in SPS activity may be a critical
factor in determining the transition of the leaf from a
sink to a source.
The allocation of photoassimilate between storage
and export has been extensively described, but there are
few answers to the question of how this allocation is
regulated. In most plants, the level of starch ﬂuctuates
on a daily basis—increasing during the light period and
declining at night. The rate of sucrose export exhibits
similar, but less extreme, diurnal ﬂuctuation. The dis-
tribution of carbon between starch and sucrose depends
primarily on the allocation of triose phosphate between
starch synthesis in the chloroplast and sucrose synthesis
in the cytoplasm.

168
Chapter 9 / Allocation, Translocation, and Partitioning of Photoassimilates
Since metabolic regulation of starch and sucrose
biosynthesis involves the two key enzymes, fructose-
1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and SPS, it is reasonable to
expect that factors that inﬂuence allocation do so at least
in part by inﬂuencing the activities of these two enzymes.
There are some data to bear out these expectations. In
cotton leaves, for example, there is a strong correla-
tion between SPS activity, sucrose content, and export
of carbon. All three increase more or less in concert
during the photoperiod and drop precipitously at the
beginning of the dark period. During the dark period,
sucrose content and SPS activity remain low, but the
drop in export activity is only transient. The pattern of
export recovery during the dark period corresponds very
closely with the pattern of starch mobilization. Although
there is considerable variation in timing and magni-
tude, similar diurnal ﬂuctuations in carbon metabolites
and enzymes have been found in other species. It thus
appears that during periods of active photosynthesis,
carbon allocation is largely determined by the activity
of SPS. At night, the determining factor appears to be
the breakdown of reserve starch.
The single most consistent aspect of source leaf allo-
cation, however, is the generally steady rate of export.
Except for transient increases at ‘‘dawn’’ or ‘‘dusk,’’
diurnal ﬂuctuations in export are small or nonexis-
tent. Apparently plants are programmed to maintain a
steady rate of assimilate translocation over the entire
24-hour period. Whether this program is imposed by
photoperiod or some other factor is not known. An
understanding of how allocation is regulated in source
leaves awaits further investigation.
9.9.2 DISTRIBUTION OF
PHOTOASSIMILATES
BETWEEN COMPETING SINKS
IS DETERMINED BY SINK
STRENGTH
The distribution of assimilate between sinks is referred
to as partitioning. In a vegetative plant, the principal
sinks are the meristem and developing leaves at the shoot
apex, roots, and nonphotosynthetic stem tissues. With
the onset of reproductive growth, the development of
ﬂowers, fruits, and seeds creates additional sinks. In
general, sinks are competitive and the photoassimilate
is partitioned to all active sinks. If the number of sinks
is reduced, a correspondingly higher proportion of the
photoassimilate is directed to each of the remaining
sinks. This is the basis for the common practice of
pruning fruit trees to ensure a smaller number of fruit
per tree. Partitioning the assimilate among a smaller
number of fruit encourages the development of larger,
more marketable fruit.
Partitioning of assimilate between competing sinks
depends primarily on three factors: the nature of vascular
connections between source and sinks, the proximity of
the sink to the source, and sink strength. Translocation is
clearly facilitated by direct vascular connections between
the source leaf and the sink. Each leaf is connected to
the main vascular system of the stem by a vascular trace,
which diverts from the vascular tissue of the stem into the
petiole. Experiments have shown that photoassimilate
will move preferentially toward sink leaves above and in
line (that is, in the same rank) with the source leaf. These
sink leaves are most directly connected with the source
leaf. Sink leaves not in the same rank, such as those on
the opposite side of the stem, are less directly linked; the
assimilate must make its way through extensive radial
connections between sieve elements.
One of the more signiﬁcant factors in determining
the direction of translocation is sink strength. Sink
strength is a measure of the capacity of a sink to accu-
mulate metabolites. It is given as the product of sink size
and sink activity:
Sink strength = sink size × sink activity
(9.17)
Sink size is the total mass of the sink (usually as dry
weight). Sink activity is the rate of uptake, or assim-
ilate intake per unit dry weight of sink per unit time.
Differences in sink strength can be measured experimen-
tally, although it is not known exactly what determines
sink strength or what causes sink strength to change
with time. The rate of phloem unloading is surely a
factor, as well as the rate of assimilate uptake by the
sink and allocation to metabolism and storage within
the sink. Environmental factors (e.g., temperature) and
hormones will also have an impact to the extent that
they inﬂuence the growth and differentiation of the sink
tissue.
Photoassimilate from most source leaves is read-
ily translocated in either vertical direction—upward
toward the apex or downward toward the roots. All else
being equal, however, there is a marked bias in favor of
translocation toward the closest sink. In the vegetative
plant, photoassimilate from young source leaves near the
top of the plant is preferentially translocated toward the
stem apex, while older, nonsenescent leaves near the base
of the plant preferentially supply the roots. Intermediate
leaves may translocate photoassimilate equally in both
directions. The direction of translocation is probably
related to the magnitude of the hydrostatic pressure
gradient in the sieve elements. Given two equivalent
sinks at different distances, the sink closest to the source
will be served by the steeper pressure gradient. The bias
in favor of the shorter translocation distance is sufﬁcient
to overcome even sink size.
Because sink strength is closely related to produc-
tivity and yield, most studies have been conducted with
crop species—in particular the ﬁlling of grain in cere-
als such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea
mays). Developing grain is a particularly active sink and

9.9 Photoassimilate Is Distributed Between Different Metabolic Pathways and Plant Organs
169
has a major impact on translocation patterns. From the
time of anthesis, when the ﬂoral parts open to receive
pollen, the developing grain becomes the dominant sink.
The inﬂuence of developing grain on translocation pat-
terns is illustrated by the results shown in Table 9.3.
In this experiment the supply of photoassimilate was
altered by reducing the supply of carbon dioxide and the
dry-weight increase of various plant parts was monitored
over the grain-ﬁlling period. Reducing photoassimilate
supply had virtually no effect on grain weight, which
means that a higher proportion of the carbon was
translocated to the grain. The difference was made up
by an equivalent decrease in the proportion of carbon
directed to the roots. Roots and the developing grain are
competing sinks. When the supply of photoassimilate is
limited, it is preferentially directed toward the sink with
the greater strength. The dominant role of developing
grain as a sink is also shown by experiments with wheat.
When photosynthesis was limited by lowering the light
level, the proportion of 14C-photoassimilate from the
ﬂag leaf (the leaf directly below the ﬂoral head) increased
from 49 percent to 71 percent. In this case, however,
the difference was made up by an equivalent reduction
in the proportion translocated in the lower stem.
The above discussion indicates that sink strength
is a signiﬁcant factor in determining the pattern of
translocation, but to suggest that sink strength alone is
responsible for the partitioning of assimilate would be
to grossly oversimplify the problem. At the very least,
assimilate partitioning is a highly integrated system,
depending upon interactions between the source leaf,
the actively growing sinks, and the translocation path
itself. We intuitively expect that such an integrated sys-
tem will be subject to regulation at one or more points.
However, beyond the observation that transport rate
generally responds to sink demand—sudden changes in
sink activity will cause corresponding changes in trans-
port rate to that sink—relatively little is known about

regulation of sink strength and interactions between
sink strength and translocation rate.
Two factors that have been implicated in inﬂuenc-
ing sink strength are cell turgor and hormones. While
investigating phloem exudate of castor bean (Ricinus com-
munis), it was noted that the act of collecting exudate by
making bark incisions, which causes a sudden reduction
in the turgor pressure in the sieve elements, gave rise
to a marked increase in sucrose loading at the source.
Subsequently, through a series of experiments involv-
ing artiﬁcial manipulation of turgor, it was concluded
that phloem loading is dependent on turgor pressure in
the sieve elements. Turgor-dependent phloem loading
now forms the basis for a relatively simple hypothe-
sis to explain the regulation of transport rate by sink
demand. When the se-cc complex is rapidly unloaded
at the sink, the reduction in solute concentration causes
a corresponding reduction in the hydrostatic pressure,
or turgor, at the sink end of the sieve elements (refer
to Figure 9.9). This reduced hydrostatic pressure will
be transmitted throughout the interconnected system
of sieve elements, quickly stimulating increased phloem
loading at the source. The resulting increase in solute
concentration at the source end of the system would
serve to counter the drop in hydrostatic pressure, thus
maintaining the pressure gradient and, in accordance
with the pressure-ﬂow mechanism, stimulating the ﬂow
of assimilate toward the sink. A reduction in sink demand
would have the opposite result, leading to a lower rate
of solute withdrawal and a higher turgor in the sieve
elements. Loading at the source and the hydrostatic
pressure gradient would be reduced, thereby lower-
ing the rate of translocation. According to this model,
changes in sieve-element turgor would be an important
message in the long-distance communication between
sinks and sources.
It is not known how the se-cc complex or the
mesophyll cells sense changes in turgor. The mechanism
by which pressure changes can be translated into changes
in sucrose loading is also unknown. However, some
experiments have demonstrated that sucrose transport
across cell membranes of beet root tissue is turgor
regulated, possibly by controlling the activity of an
ATPase proton pump located in the plasma membrane.
Plant hormones (see Chapters 18–21) have been
implicated in directing long-distance translocation, par-
ticularly with regard to redirection of assimilates to
new sinks. Hormone-directed transport, however, may
be simply an indirect consequence of hormone action.
We know that hormones are one of several intrinsic
factors involved in regulating the growth and develop-
ment of organs. Through their inﬂuence on the size
and metabolic activity of sink organs, hormones will
undoubtedly inﬂuence sink strength and, as a result,
translocation rates. The role of hormones is compli-

delivered to new sink organs by the phloem. As well,
new sinks often themselves become sources of hormones
that may act locally or be translocated to other regions
of the plant.
While a role for hormone-directed transport over
long distance may be uncertain, there is an accumulat-
ing body of evidence that seems to indicate a more
direct involvement of hormones in the transfer of
solute over short distances. For example, there are a
number of reported correlations between the concen-
tration of abscisic acid (ABA; see Chapter 21) and the
growth rate of developing fruits. ABA also stimulates
the translocation of sugar into the roots of intact bean
plants, the uptake of sucrose by sugarbeet root tis-
sue, and the unloading of sucrose into the apoplast of
soybean seed-coats and its subsequent uptake into the
embryo. There have been conﬂicting reports on whether
ABA stimulates the translocation of 14C-photoassimilate
into ﬁlling wheat ears. The hormone auxin (IAA; see
Chapter 18), on the other hand, inhibits sucrose uptake
by sugarbeet roots but stimulates loading in bean leaves.
These and other results suggest that loading and unload-
ing may be susceptible to control by hormones.
Although it appears that sink strength is a major
factor in determining assimilate distribution, the pro-
cess of assimilate partitioning remains a complex, highly
integrated, and poorly understood phenomenon. Inves-
tigators have only begun to address the respective roles
of turgor and hormones, while genetic questions and
other potential means of regulation have yet to be
addressed in any serious way. The regulation of load-
ing, unloading, and source-sink communication should
continue to be active and productive areas of research in
the future.
9.10 XENOBIOTIC
AGROCHEMICALS
ARE TRANSLOCATED
IN THE PHLOEM
Phloem mobility is of particular interest to the agro-
chemical industry in producing xenobiotic chemicals.
The term xenobiotic refers to biologically active
molecules that are foreign to an organism. The rate of
absorption and translocation of xenobiotic chemicals
often determines their effectiveness as herbicides,
growth regulators, fungicides, or insecticides. One
excellent example is the broad-spectrum herbicide
N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, or glyphosate. Glypho-
sate acts by preventing the synthesis of aromatic amino
acids, which in turn blocks the synthesis of protein,
auxin hormones, and other important metabolites.
Because it is highly mobile in the phloem, glyphosate
applied to leaves is rapidly translocated to meristematic
areas or to underground rhizomes for effective control
of perennial weeds.
The principal problem with xenobiotics appears to
be in gaining entry into the phloem at the minor vein
endings in the leaf, that is, phloem loading. Although
a few theories have been advanced to explain phloem
mobility of xenobiotics, there are relatively few consis-
tent chemical and physical characteristics that describe
these molecules. Because xenobiotics are not normally
encountered by plants, there are no carriers to mediate
their uptake by the cell. Entry is probably by pas-
sive diffusion. One consistent characteristic of mobile
xenobiotics is their relative level of lipid solubility, or
lipophilicity, a factor that helps to predict their ability
to diffuse through cell membranes.
Efforts to further understand factors controlling
the entry of xenobiotic chemicals into plants and their
systemic mobility may ultimately lead to advances in our
understanding of phloem translocation generally.
SUMMARY
In many plants, the products of photosynthesis may be
stored as starch in the chloroplast or exported from
the chloroplast to the cytosol where they are con-
verted to sucrose. Storage as starch or export to the
cytoplasm are competing processes subject to regula-
tion by subtle changes in the level of triose phosphate
and inorganic phosphate (Pi) as well as the regula-
tor metabolite, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP).
Other plants such as cereals, store carbon primarily
as fructans in the vacuole and exhibit and insensitiv-
ity to feedback inhibition of carbon metabolism under
conditions where sucrose accumulates in the cytosol.
The long-distance translocation of photoassimilate
and other small organic molecules occurs in the phloem
tissue. The distinguishing feature of phloem tissue
is the conducting tissue called the sieve element or
sieve tube. Filled with modiﬁed, but active, protoplasm
at maturity, sieve tubes are interconnected through
perforated end walls called sieve plates.
The direction of long-distance translocation
in the phloem is determined largely by source-sink
relationships. An organ or tissue that produces more
assimilate than it requires for its own metabolism is
a source, while a sink is a net importer of assimilate.
Sinks include meristems and developing leaves at
the apex, nonphotosynthetic stem tissues, roots, and
storage organs. Organs such as leaves are commonly
sinks in their early stages, but become sources as they
mature.
Sugars are translocated in the phloem by mass
transfer along a hydrostatic pressure gradient between
the source and sink. Loading of sugars into the sieve
element–companion cell complex (se-cc) in minor

veins of the source is followed by the osmotic uptake of
water. The resulting hydrostatic pressure is transmitted
throughout the system of sieve elements. Unloading
of sugars from the minor veins in the sink maintains
the pressure differential that causes mass ﬂow. Phloem
loading and unloading may occur through the symplast
(plasmodesmata) directly into the se-cc complex. Alter-
natively, sucrose may be transported across the meso-
phyll cell membrane into the apoplastic space. From
there it would be taken across the membrane of the
se-cc complex and enter the long-distance transport
stream. There is evidence to support both path-
ways, but there are a number of issues yet to be
resolved.
The distribution of photoassimilate between
metabolic pathways and plant organs occurs at two
levels: allocation and partitioning. Allocation refers to
the immediate metabolic fate of assimilate. It may be
allocated to the immediate metabolic needs of the leaf
itself and maintenance of leaf biomass, it may be stored
for use during nonphotosynthetic periods, or it may be
exported from the leaf. Once exported, assimilate will
be partitioned between competing sinks. Partitioning
is determined by sink strength, which is a combination
of sink size and metabolic activity.

Cellular Respiration: Unlocking the Energy
Stored in Photoassimilates
The previous four chapters have been devoted to the
conservation of light energy as compounds of carbon,
or photoassimilates, and factors directing the distribu-
tion of those carbon compounds into different plant
organs and tissues. Sugars and other photoassimilates
represent two important acquisitions by the plant. They
represent, ﬁrst, a highly mobile form of stored photosyn-
thetic energy, and second, a source of carbon skeletons.
Through respiration, the plant is able to retrieve the
energy in a more useful form, and in the process the
sugars are modiﬁed to form the carbon skeletons that
make up the basic building blocks of cell structure.
This chapter is divided into three principal parts.
The ﬁrst part is devoted to the biochemistry and phys-
iology of cellular respiration. After presenting a brief
overview of respiration, the following topics will be
discussed:
•
pathways and enzymes involved in the degradation
of sucrose and starch to hexose sugars,
•
the conversion of hexose to pyruvate via the gly-
colytic pathway and the alternate oxidative pentose
phosphate pathways,
•
the structure and organization of the mitochon-
drion, which is the site of oxidative respiratory
metabolism,
•
the pathway for the complete oxidation of pyruvate
to CO2, known as the citric acid cycle (CAC),
the passage of electrons to molecular oxygen via
the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and the
conservation of energy as reducing potential and
ATP,
•
several alternative pathways for electron transport
that are unique to plants and their possible physio-
logical consequences, and
•
the respiration of oils in seeds by ﬁrst converting
fatty acids to hexose sugars via a process known as
gluconeogenesis.
In the second part of this chapter, respiration in
intact plants and tissues is discussed, showing how envi-
ronmental factors such as light, temperature, and oxygen
availability inﬂuence respiration. Finally, the role of
respiration in the accumulation of biomass and plant
productivity will be brieﬂy examined.
Certain principles introduced earlier (Chapter 5)
apply equally well to the present discussion. These
include bioenergetics, oxidation and reduction reac-
tions, proton gradients, and the synthesis of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). You may ﬁnd it helpful at this time
to review the appropriate sections of Chapter 5.

Chapter 10 / Cellular Respiration: Unlocking the Energy Stored in Photoassimilates
10.1 CELLULAR RESPIRATION
CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF
PATHWAYS BY WHICH
PHOTOASSIMILATES ARE
OXIDIZED
Higher plants are aerobic organisms, which means
they require the presence of molecular oxygen (O2)
for normal metabolism. They obtain both the energy
and carbon required for maintenance and growth by
oxidizing photoassimilates according to the following
overall equation:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O →6CO2 + 12H2O
G◦′ = −2869 kJ mol−1
(10.1)
Note that this equation is written as a reversal of the
equation for photosynthesis (Chapter 7, Equation 7.1).
The photosynthetic equation is written as the reduc-
tion of carbon dioxide to hexose sugar, with water as
the source of electrons. The equation for respiration,
on the other hand, is written as the oxidation of hexose
to carbon dioxide, with water as a product. Respiration
is accompanied by the release of an amount of free
energy equivalent to that consumed in the synthesis of
the same carbon compounds by photosynthesis. Here
the similarity basically ends. Although the two processes
overall share the same reactants and products and their
energetics are similar, the complex of enzymes involved
and the metabolic routes taken are fundamentally dif-
ferent, and they occur in different locations in the cell.
Moreover, respiration is a process shared by all living
cells in the plant, while photosynthesis is restricted to
those cells containing chloroplasts.
Equation 10.1 is written as the direct oxidation of
hexose by molecular oxygen, with the consequent release
of all of the free energy as heat. Cells do not, of course,
oxidize sugars in this way. The release of such a large
quantity of energy all at once would literally consume the
cells. Instead, the overall process of respiration occurs
in three separate but interdependent stages—called
glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (CAC), and the respi-
ratory electron transport chain—comprised of some
50 or more individual reactions in total. The transfer of
electrons to oxygen is but the ﬁnal step in this long and
complex process. From the energetic perspective, the
function of such a complex process is clear: by breaking
the oxidation of hexose down into a series of small, dis-
crete steps, the release of free energy is also controlled
so that it can be conserved in metabolically useful forms.
Equally important to the cell, as we noted earlier, is
the fact that respiration also serves to produce a variety
of carbon skeletons that are then used to build other
molecules required by the cell. We will return to this
point later in the chapter.
The equation for respiration (Equation 10.1) is
commonly written with hexose (in particular, glucose)
as the initial substrate. In practice, a variety of substrates
may serve as the initial substrate. Glucose is itself
derived from storage polymers such as starch (a
polymer of glucose), fructans (a polymer of fructose),
or the disaccharide, sucrose. Other sugars may also
be metabolized, as well as lipids, organic acids, and
to a lesser extent, protein. The actual substrate being
respired will depend on the species or organ, stage of
development, or physiological state.
The type of substrate being respired may on
occasion
be
indicated
by
measuring
the
relative
amounts of O2 consumed and CO2 evolved. From these
measurements the respiratory quotient (RQ) can be
calculated:
RQ = moles CO2 evolved
moles O2 consumed
(10.2)
The value of the respiratory quotient is a function of the
oxidation state of the substrate being respired. Note that
when carbohydrate is being respired (Equation 10.1),
the theoretical value of RQ is 6CO2/6O2 = 1.0. Exper-
imental values actually tend to vary in the range 0.97
to 1.17. Because lipids and proteins are more highly
reduced than carbohydrate, more oxygen is required to
complete their oxidation and the RQ value may be as
low as 0.7. On the other hand, organic acids, such as
citrate or malate, are more highly oxidized than carbo-
hydrate, less oxygen is required for complete oxidation,
and RQ values when organic acids are being respired
are typically about 1.3.
While RQ values may provide some useful infor-
mation, care must be taken when interpreting them.
For example, should more than one type of substrate
be respired at any one time, the measured RQ will be
an average value. Should fermentation be occurring (see
below), little or no oxygen will be consumed and an
abnormally high RQ may result. Or should either CO2
or O2 be trapped in the tissue for any reason, results will
be correspondingly misleading. Still, respiratory quo-
tients less than 1 are typical of plants under starvation
conditions as lipids and possibly proteins replace carbo-
hydrate as the principal respiratory substrate. Another
example of the use of RQ is in germinating seeds. During
germination, seeds that store large quantities of lipids
will initially exhibit RQ values less than 1. Values will
gradually approach 1 as the seedlings consume the lipid
reserves and switch over to carbohydrate as the principal
respiratory substrate.
The dependence of plant respiration on photo-
synthesis is illustrated in Figure 10.1. The reduction
of CO2 in the chloroplast leads to the production of
ﬁxed carbon in the form of triose phosphates (triose-P),
which are represented by the three-carbon phospho-
rylated intermediates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (see Chapter 8). Triose-P

FIGURE 10.1 The metabolic interaction between the chloroplast, cytosol, and mito-
chondrion in a leaf mesophyll cell. Photosynthesis oxidizes water to O2 and reduces
CO2 to triose phosphates (triose-P), which represent the ﬁxed carbon substrate for
metabolic pathways in the cytosol and the mitochondrion. Triose-P is either stored
as starch or exported to the cytosol. In the cytosol, triose-P is either converted to
sucrose, which is exported from the mesophyll cell, or is oxidized to pyruvate by the
glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate is either oxidized to ethanol in the absence of O2 (fer-
mentation) or imported to the mitochondrion and completely oxidized to CO2. Thus,
the light energy initially stored as ﬁxed carbon by photosynthesis is eventually con-
verted in the mitochondrion to ATP and reducing power (NADH, FADH2), which is
used for growth, development, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
is the carbon intermediate that connects anabolic pho-
tosynthetic carbon reduction with respiratory oxidative
carbon catabolism. Triose-P generated either directly
by the reduction of CO2 or by the breakdown of starch
is exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol, where
it is oxidized by the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate.
In the presence of molecular oxygen, pyruvate is com-
pletely oxidized through mitochondrial respiration to
CO2 with the generation of chemical energy in the form
of ATP and NADH used for growth, development, and
the maintenance of homeostasis. The metabolic connec-
tion between photosynthesis, glycolysis, and respiration
not only represents the mechanism by which energy, in
the form of ﬁxed carbon, is transferred between three
different compartments within a single plant cell, but
also represents an ‘‘information pathway’’ connecting
the chloroplast with the mitochondrion. This can be
illustrated by the fact that inhibition of respiratory ATP
synthesis causes PSII reaction centers to become much
more sensitive to photoinhibition (Chapter 13). This
ability of the chloroplast to respond to events in the
mitochondrion is the result of metabolic feedback loops
similar to that discussed in Chapters 8 and 9. Clearly, the
chloroplast ‘‘knows’’ what is going on in the mitochon-
drion! Research is only beginning to unravel the precise
nature of these metabolic feedback loops between the
mitochondrion, the chloroplast, and the cytosol.
10.2 STARCH MOBILIZATION
There are two distinct pathways for the breakdown, that
is, the mobilization of starch. The hydrolytic path-
way results in the production of glucose whereas the
phosphorolytic pathway results in the accumulation
of hexose phosphates. These pathways will now be dis-
cussed separately in more detail.
10.2.1 THE HYDROLYTIC
DEGRADATION OF STARCH
PRODUCES GLUCOSE
Because most plants store their carbohydrate as starch
or sucrose (Chapter 9), the breakdown of these car-
bohydrates is an appropriate point at which to begin
the path of respiratory carbon. Starch normally con-
sists of a mixture of two polysaccharides: amylose and
amylopectin. Amylose, which probably represents no
more than one-third of the starch present in most

higher plants, consists of very long, straight chains of
(1→4)-linked α-D-glucose units. Amylopectin, on the
other hand, is a highly branched molecule in which
relatively short (1→4)-linked α-D-glucose chains are
connected by (1→6) links (Figure 10.2). Starch is nor-
mally deposited in plastids as water-insoluble granules
or grains. The complete breakdown of starch to its
component glucose residues requires the participation
of several hydrolytic enzymes.
10.2.2 α-AMYLASE PRODUCES
MALTOSE AND LIMIT DEXTRINS
α-Amylase randomly cleaves α-(1→4) glucosyl bonds
in
both
amylose
and
amylopectin
(Figure
10.2).
α-Amylase, however, does not readily attack terminal
α-(1→4) bonds. In the case of amylopectin, α-amylase
will not cleave the α-(1→6) glucosyl bonds, nor
those α-(1→4) bonds in the immediate vicinity of
the branch points. Consequently, about 90 percent
of the sugar released on hydrolysis of amylose and
amylopectin by α-amylase consists of the disaccharide
maltose ((1→4)-α-D-glucosylglucose). The balance
consists of a small amount of glucose and, in the
case of amylopectin, limit dextrins. Limit dextrins
are comprised of a small number of glucose residues,
perhaps 4 to 10, and contain the original branch
points. α-Amylase is not restricted to plants but
can be found widely in nature, including bacteria
and mammals (including human saliva). Indeed, this
enzyme can be expected in any tissue that rapidly
metabolizes starch. A unique and important property
of α-amylase is its ability to use starch grains as a
substrate. α-Amylase plays an important role in the
early stages of seed germination, where it is regulated
by the plant hormones gibberellin and abscisic acid
(Chapter 19, 21).
10.2.3 β-AMYLASE PRODUCES
MALTOSE
β-Amylase degrades amylose by selectively hydrolyzing
every second bond, beginning at the nonreducing end of
the chain. β-Amylase thus produces exclusively maltose.
β-Amylase will degrade the short chains in amylopectin
molecules as well. However, because the enzyme can
work only from the nonreducing end and cannot cleave
the (1→6) branch points, β-amylase will degrade only
the short, outer chains and will leave the interior of the
branched molecule intact (Figure 10.2).
10.2.4 LIMIT DEXTRINASE IS A
DEBRANCHING ENZYME
Limit dextrinase acts on limit dextrins and cleaves
the (1→6) branching bond. This allows both α- and
β-amylase to continue degrading the starch to mal-
tose.

10.2 Starch Mobilization
177
10.2.5 α-GLUCOSIDASE HYDROLYZES
MALTOSE
The ﬁnal step is the hydrolysis of maltose to two
molecules of glucose by the enzyme α-glucosidase. All of
the above enzymes mediate the hydrolytic breakdown
of starch to free sugar; that is, the molecule is cleaved
essentially by the addition of water across the bond.
10.2.6 STARCH PHOSPHORYLASE
CATALYZES THE
PHOSPHOROLYTIC
DEGRADATION OF STARCH
When the inorganic phosphate level is high (greater
than 1 mM), the breakdown of starch is accompanied by
an accumulation of phosphorylated sugars. This is due to
the action of the enzyme starch phosphorylase, which
catalyzes the phosphorolytic degradation of starch:
starch + nPi →n(glucose −1 −phosphate)
(10.3)
We will return to this point later, but because the end
product is glucose-1-phosphate rather than free glucose,
the action of phosphorylase offers a slight energetic
advantage. Phosphorylase cannot operate alone—it is
unable to degrade starch grains and, like β-amylase,
its action is conﬁned to the outer chains of amy-
lopectin molecules. Phosphorylase thus can work only
in conjunction with α-amylase, which initiates degrada-
tion of the insoluble grains, and debranching enzymes,
which render the interior glucose chains accessible to
the phosphorylase enzyme. The relative importance
of phosphorylase in vivo is not known, but in lab-
oratory experiments phosphorylase accounts for less
than half of the degradation of potato starch. The
balance is degraded via α- and β-amylase. Starch is
stored and degraded inside plastids (either chloroplasts
or amyloplasts—see Chapter 5, Box 5.1), but the initial
stages of cellular respiration occur in the cytosol. The
products of starch degradation must therefore make
their way across the plastid envelope in order to gain
access to the respiratory machinery. This is accom-
plished by two transporter systems located in the mem-
branes of the plastid envelope (Figure 10.3). The product
of phosphorolytic breakdown, glucose-1-phosphate, is
a component of the hexose phosphate pool and sub-
sequently is converted to triose-P in the chloroplast.
Triose-P exits the plastid via the Pi-triose phosphate
transporter described earlier in Chapter 8. Free glucose
is able to exit the plastid via a separate hexose transporter,
a protein complex present in the inner envelope mem-
brane of the chloroplast, which speciﬁcally moves glu-
cose from the stroma to the cytosol. For a more detailed
discussion of membrane transport review Chapter 3.
Sucrose synthesis has been described in Chapter 9.
Two enzymes are responsible for its breakdown:
sucrose synthase and invertase. Invertase occurs in
two forms, alkaline invertase, with a pH optimum
near 7.5, and acid invertase, with a pH optimum near 5.

cose is transported through the chloroplast
envelope membrane by a speciﬁc glucose
transporter to the cytosol. In the cytosol, the
exported glucose enters the cytosolic hexose
phosphate (hexose-P) pool. The breakdown
of sucrose also feeds hexose phosphates into
the cytosolic hexose-P pool. The degradation
of fructans in the vacuole also feeds hexose
phosphates into the cytosolic hexose-P pool.
Components of the cytosolic hexose-P pool
are converted to cytosolic triose-P. The phos-
phorolytic pathway feeds hexose phosphates
into the stromal hexose-P pool. Hexose-P is
converted to stromal triose-P which is trans-
ported out of the chloroplast to the cytosol
by the speciﬁc Pi-translocator, which imports
one Pi molecule for each triose-P exported to
the cytosol. Cytosolic triose-P is then oxidized
through glycolysis and respiration. Note that
the two hexose-P pools are present in different
compartments that are connected metaboli-
cally.

178
Chapter 10 / Cellular Respiration: Unlocking the Energy Stored in Photoassimilates
Sucrose synthase and alkaline invertase appear to be
localized in the cytosol, while acid invertase is found
associated with cell walls and vacuoles. Clearly the
relative contributions of these three enzymes will
depend to some extent on the cellular location of the
sucrose being metabolized. Acid invertase, for example,
would be important to the mobilization of sucrose in
sugarcane (Saccharum spontaneum), which stores excess
carbohydrate primarily as sucrose in the vacuoles of
stem cells.
10.3 FRUCTAN MOBILIZATION
IS CONSTITUTIVE
Fructans are soluble polymeric forms of fructose biosyn-
thesized in the vacuole as major storage carbohydrates
of certain plants species such as grasses (see Chapter 9).
Although the enzymes involved on the biosynthesis of
fructans are inducible through an increase in cytosolic
sucrose concentrations, it appears that enzymes involved
in the hydrolysis of fructans are consitutively expressed
irrespective of sucrose concentrations. Thus, the net
accumulation of fructans in the vacuole is the result
of the differential, regulated rate of biosynthesis versus
the unregulated rate of hydrolysis. The major enzyme
involved in fructan hydrolysis in the vacuole is fructan
exohydrolase (FEH). This enzyme is an exohydrolase
which hydrolyzes one terminal fructosyl unit at a time
from the fructan polymer (Equation 10.4).
Glucosyl-1,2-fructosyl-1,2-fructosyl-(fructosyl)N →
glucosyl-1,2-fructosyl-1,2-(fructosyl)N−1 + fructose
(10.4)
The hydrolysis of this polymer is completed by the
action of the vacuolar invertase (Equation 10.5) which
breaks down the initial sucrose acceptor molecule used
to synthesize the fructan (Chapter 9) into glucose and
fructose.
Sucrose →glucose + fructose
(10.5)
The free hexoses are then transported from the vacuole
to the cytosol where they are phosphorylated by cytoso-
lic hexokinase and enter the cytosolic hexose phosphate
pool (Figure 10.4).
10.4 GLYCOLYSIS CONVERTS
SUGARS TO PYRUVIC ACID
The ﬁrst stage of respiratory carbon metabolism is a
group of reactions by which hexose sugars undergo
a partial oxidation to the three-carbon acid pyruvic
acid or pyruvate. These reactions, collectively known
as glycolysis, are catalyzed by enzymes located in the
cytosol of the cell. Parallel reactions occur indepen-
dently in plastids, in particular amyloplasts and some
chloroplasts. Thus, unlike animal cells, glycolysis in
plants is not restricted to the cytosol. The reaction of
glycolysis, which literally means the lysis or breakdown
of sugar, was originally worked out by Meyerhof and
others in Germany during the early part of the twenti-
eth century, in order to explain fermentation in yeasts
and the breakdown of glycogen in animal muscle tissue.
Like much of respiratory metabolism, glycolysis is now
known to occur universally in all organisms. It is also
believed to represent the most primitive form of carbon
catabolism since it can lead to fermentation products
such as alcohol and lactic acid in the absence of molec-
ular oxygen. Although the energy yield of glycolysis
is low, it can be used to support growth in anaerobic
organisms or in some aerobic organisms or tissues under
anaerobic conditions. Under normal aerobic conditions,
however, the pyruvate formed by glycolysis will be fur-
ther metabolized by the mitochondria to extract yet
more energy.
Glycolysis is conveniently considered in two parts.
The ﬁrst is a set of reactions by which the several
forms of glucose and fructose derived from storage
carbohydrate are converted to the common intermedi-
ate triose-phosphate (triose-P) via the hexose-phosphate
pool (Figure 10.4). Triose-P is then converted to pyru-
vate, the end product of glycolysis (Figure 10.5).
10.4.1 HEXOSES MUST BE
PHOSPHORYLATED TO
ENTER GLYCOLYSIS
In order for carbon from storage carbohydrate to
enter glycolysis, the glucose and fructose derived from
hydrolysis of starch, sucrose, or fructans must ﬁrst be
converted to hexose phosphates. The cytosolic hex-
ose phosphate pool consists of glucose-1-phosphate,
glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. These
phosphorylated intermediates are subsequently con-
verted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (Figure 10.4).
Note that the conversion of glucose and fructose to FBP
requires an initial expenditure of energy in the form of
ATP. Two molecules of ATP are consumed for each
molecule of sucrose that enters glycolysis (reactions 5
and 6). This is analogous to priming a pump; glucose is
a relatively stable molecule and the initial phosphory-
lations, ﬁrst to glucose-6-P and then to fructose-1,6-P,
are a form of activation energy (see Chapter 8, Box 8.1).
These two ATP molecules will be recovered during
glycolysis.
It is here the phosphorolytic breakdown of starch
in the chloroplast offers a slight energetic advantage
over hydrolytic degradation. Because the product is
glucose-1-P, for each molecule of hexose entering via
the phosphorolytic route the initial expenditure of ATP

chloroplast and the cytosol. In the chloroplast, starch is either broken down hydrolyt-
ically to glucose, which is exported to the cytosol, or broken down phosphorolyti-
cally to intermediates of the stromal hexose-P pool (glucose-1-P, glucose-6-P, and
fructose-6-P). In the cytosol, sucrose is hydrolyzed to glucose plus fructose. The
hydrolysis of fructans in the vacuole also supply glucose and fructose to the cytosol.
Glucose and fructose are converted to intermediates of the cytosolic hexose-P pool
by the enzymes hexokinase (5) and fructokinase (6), respectively. The intermedi-
ates of the stromal and cytosolic hexose-P pools are interconverted by chloroplastic
and cytosolic isoforms of the enzymes phosphoglucomutase (1 and 8, respectively)
and hexosephosphate isomerase (2 and 7, respectively). Carbon exits the stromal and
cytosolic hexose-P pools through the conversion of fructose-6-P to fructose-1,6-BP
(FBP) by the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase present in the stroma (3) and
in the cytosol (9). Fructose-1,6-BP is converted to triose phosphate (triose-P) by
chloroplastic and cytosolic isoforms of the enzyme aldolase (4 and 10, respectively).
Triose-P is exported from the stroma to cytosol by the Pi-transporter.

ways for the breakdown of starch to triose-P in the
stroma with the breakdown of sucrose in the cytosol
(Equation 10.6):
storage carbohydrate →hexose-P pool
→FBP →triose-P
(10.6)
10.4.2 TRIOSE PHOSPHATES ARE
OXIDIZED TO PYRUVATE
The reactions for the further conversion of triose-P
to pyruvate are summarized in Figure 10.5. The
triose phosphates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, are readily interconvert-
ible (reaction 1), which means that all of the carbon
in the original hexose molecule will eventually be
converted to pyruvate. In other words, one molecule of
hexose phosphate will yield two molecules of pyruvate.
Thus, in order to account for the hexose molecule
originally entering the pathway, everything from this
point on must be multiplied by 2.
A principal function of glycolysis is energy conser-
vation, which occurs in two ways. The ﬁrst is through
the production of reducing potential in the form of
NADH. In reaction 2, two molecules of NADH (one
for each triose phosphate) are produced as glyceralde-
hyde is oxidized to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Since this
partial oxidation does not require molecular oxygen and
does not result in the release of any CO2, the glycolytic
oxidation of carbohydrate is an anaerobic process. The
NADH produced may be used as reducing potential by
the cell for synthesis of other molecules or, if oxygen is
present, can be metabolized by plant mitochondria to
produce ATP (see Figure 10.9).
The second way that energy is conserved is
through the production of ATP via reactions 3 and 6
(Figure 10.5). For each molecule of hexose entering
into glycolysis, four ATP are formed (two for each
triose phosphate). Note that formation of ATP at this
point does not involve a proton gradient and cannot
be explained by Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis. It
is instead linked directly to conversion of substrate in
the pathway. This form of ATP production is called a
substrate-level phosphorylation. Depending on whe-
ther the storage carbohydrates were initially degraded
by the hydrolytic or the phosphorolytic pathways, this
represents a net gain of either two or three ATP.
10.5 THE OXIDATIVE PENTOSE
PHOSPHATE PATHWAY IS
AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE
FOR GLUCOSE METABOLISM
Most organisms, including both plants and animals,
contain an alternative route for glucose metabolism
called the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
(Figure 10.6). Although this oxidative pathway is res-
tricted to the cytosol in animals, this pathway is present
in both the chloroplast (Chapter 8) as well as the
cytosol in plants. The oxidative pentose phosphate
pathway shares several intermediates with glycolysis
and is closely integrated with it. The ﬁrst step in the
oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is the oxidation of
glucose-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate (Figure 10.6). This
initial step, which is sensitive to the level of NADP+, is
apparently the rate-determining step for the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway. This is the reaction that
determines the balance between glycolysis and the
oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The second
step is another oxidation accompanied by the removal
of a CO2 group to form ribulose-5-P. The electron
acceptor in both reactions is NADP+, rather than
NAD+. Subsequent reactions in the pathway result in
the formation of glyceraldehyde-3-P and fructose-6-P,
both of which are then further metabolized via
glycolysis.

to generate reducing potential in the form of NADPH
and pentose sugars for nucleic acid biosynthesis. The
origin of glucose-6-P is the cytosolic hexose-P pool
(see Figure 10.4). Glyceraldehyde-3-P and fructose-6-P
may be returned to the glycolytic pathway for further
metabolism. Enzymes are: (1) glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, (2) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase,
(3) phosphoriboisomerase, (4) phosphopentoepimerase,
(5) transketolase, (6) transaldolase.
The role of the oxidative pentose phosphate path-
way and its contribution to carbon metabolism overall
is difﬁcult to assess because the pathway is not easily
studied in green plants. This is largely because many of
the intermediates and enzymes of this respiratory cycle
are shared by the more dominant reductive pentose
phosphate pathway, or PCR cycle, in the chloroplasts
(Chapter 8). From studies of animal metabolism, how-
ever, it can be concluded that the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway has two signiﬁcant functions. The
ﬁrst is to generate reducing potential in the form of
NADPH. NADP+ is distinguished from NAD+ by
an extra phosphoryl group. NADPH serves primarily
as an electron donor when required to drive normally
reductive biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is used
predominantly to generate ATP through oxidative phos-
phorylation (see below). This distinction allows the cell
to maintain separate pools of NADPH and NAD+
in the same compartment: a high NADPH/NADP+
ratio to support reductive biosynthesis and a high
NAD+/NADH ratio to support glycolysis. The oxida-
tive pentose phosphate pathway is therefore thought
to be a means to generate NADPH required to drive
biosynthetic reactions in the cytosol. In animals, for
example, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is
extremely active in fatty tissues where NADPH is
required for active fatty acid synthesis. The second
function for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is
the production of pentose phosphate, which serves as
a precursor for the ribose and deoxyribose required in
the synthesis of nucleic acids. Another intermediate of
the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway with potential
signiﬁcance to plants is the 4-carbon erythrose-4-P, a
precursor for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids,
lignin, and ﬂavonoids.
10.6 THE FATE OF PYRUVATE
DEPENDS ON THE
AVAILABILITY OF
MOLECULAR OXYGEN
The fate of pyruvate produced by glycolysis depends
primarily on whether oxygen is present (Figure 10.7).
Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvate is trans-
ported into the mitochondrion, where it is further
oxidized to CO2 and water, transferring its electrons
ultimately to molecular oxygen. We will address mito-
chondrial respiration further in the following section.
Although higher plants are obligate aerobes and are
able to tolerate anoxia for only short periods, tissues or
organs are occasionally subjected to anaerobic condi-
tions. A typical situation is that of roots when the soil is
saturated with water. When there is no oxygen to serve
as the terminal electron acceptor, mitochondrial respi-
ration will shut down and metabolism will shift over to
fermentation. Fermentation converts pyruvate either
to ethanol through the action of the enzyme alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) or to lactate via lactate dehy-
drogenase (LDH). In most plants, the principal prod-
ucts of fermentation are CO2 and ethanol (Figure 10.7,

reactions 1, 2). Some lactate may be formed, primarily
in the early stages of anoxia. However, lactate low-
ers the pH of the cytosol, which in turn activates
pyruvate decarboxylase and initiates the production of
ethanol. Note that either one of the fermentation reac-
tions (Figure 10.7, reactions 2 and 3) consumes the
NADH produced earlier in glycolysis by the oxida-
tion of glyceraldehyde-3-P (Figure 10.5, reaction 2).
Although this means there is no net gain of reducing
potential in fermentation, this recycling of NADH is
still important to the cell. The pool of NADH plus
NAD+ in the cell is relatively small and if the NADH
is not recycled, there will be no supply of NAD+ to
support the continued oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-P.
If this were the case, glycolysis and the production of
even the small quantities of ATP necessary to maintain
the cells under anaerobic conditions would then grind
to a halt.

10.7 Oxidative Respiration is Carried Out by the Mitochondrion
183
responsible for elucidating this central metabolic pro-
cess. Krebs was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in
1954 for his outstanding contribution.
Schemes for the citric acid cycle such as that shown
in Figure 10.8 invariably begin with pyruvate. Although
pyruvate is technically not a part of the cycle, it does pro-
vide the major link between glycolysis and subsequent
carbon metabolism. Note that pyruvate is produced in
the cytosol while the enzymes of the citric acid cycle
are located in the matrix space of the mitochondrion
(Chapter 5). Thus in order for pyruvate to be metabo-
lized by the citric acid cycle, it must ﬁrst be translocated
through the inner membrane. This is accomplished
by a pyruvate-OH−antiport carrier—that is, pyruvate
is taken up by the mitochondrion in exchange for a
hydroxyl ion carried into the intermembrane space.
Once inside the matrix, pyruvate is oxidized and
decarboxylated by a large multienzyme complex pyru-
vate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes
a series of ﬁve linked reactions, the overall effect of which
is to oxidize one molecule of pyruvate to a two-carbon
acetate group:
pyruvate + NAD+ + CoA →
acetyl-CoA + NADH + H+ + CO2 (10.7)
The resulting two-carbon acetyl group is ﬁnally linked
via a thioester bond to a sulphur-protein coenzyme
A(CoA). In the process, NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
The CO2 given off represents the ﬁrst of three carbon
atoms in the degradation of pyruvate.
The citric acid cycle proper begins with the enzyme
citrate synthase, which condenses the acetyl group
from acetyl-CoA with the four-carbon oxaloacetate to
form the six-carbon, tricarboxylic citric acid (hence the
designation citric acid cycle, CAC). The next step is
an isomerization of citrate to isocitrate (Figure 10.8,
reaction 3), followed by two successive oxidative decar-
boxylations (Figure 10.8, reactions 4, 5). The two CO2
molecules given off effectively completes the oxidation
of pyruvate which adds two more molecules of NADH
to the pool of reductant in the mitochondrial matrix.
The balance of the citric acid cycle serves two
functions. First, additional energy is conserved at three
more locations. One molecule of ATP is formed from
ADP and inorganic phosphate when succinate is formed
from succinyl-CoA (Figure 10.8, reaction 6). Because
the ATP formation is linked directly to conversion of
substrate, this is another example of substrate-level
phosphorylation. Additional energy is conserved with
the oxidation of succinate to fumarate (Figure 10.8,
reaction 7) and the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate
(reaction 9). Second, the cycle serves to regenerate a
molecule of oxaloacetate and so prepare the cycle to
accept another molecule of acetyl-CoA. Regeneration
of oxaloacetate is critical to the catalytic nature of the
cycle in that it allows a single oxalacetate molecule to
mediate the oxidation of an endless number of acetyl
groups.
In summary, the citric acid cycle consists of eight
enzyme-catalyzed steps, beginning with the condensa-
tion of a two-carbon acetyl group with the four-carbon
oxaloacetate to form a molecule of the six-carbon citrate.
The acetyl group is then degraded to two molecules of
CO2. The cycle includes four oxidations, which yield
NADH at three steps and FADH2 at one step. One
molecule of ATP is formed by substrate-level phospho-
rylation. Finally, the oxaloacetate is regenerated, which
allows the cycle to continue.
Before leaving the citric acid cycle for the moment,
it is useful to point out that the cycle must turn twice to
metabolize the equivalent of one hexose sugar.

SUBSTRATE IN THE CITRIC
ACID CYCLE ARE PASSED TO
MOLECULAR OXYGEN
THROUGH THE
MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON
TRANSPORT CHAIN
We noted earlier that one of the principal functions of
the respiration is to retrieve, in useful form, some of
the energy initially stored in assimilates. Our traditional
measure of useful energy in most processes is the number
of ATP molecules gained or consumed. By this mea-
sure alone, the yield from both glycolysis and the citric
acid cycle is quite low. After two complete turns of the
cycle, one molecule of glucose has been completely oxi-
dized to six molecules of CO2, but only four molecules
of ATP have been produced (a net of two ATP from
glycolysis plus one for each turn of the cycle). At this
point, most of the energy associated with the glucose
molecule has been conserved in the form of electron
pairs generated by the oxidation of glycolytic and citric
acid cycle intermediates. For each molecule of glucose,
a total of 12 electron pairs were generated; 10 as NADH
(G◦′ = −222 kJ mol−1) and two as FADH2 (G◦′ =
−180 kJ mol−1). Thus, the total energy that has been
trapped as reducing power through the action of gly-
colysis and CAC is about 2580 kJ mol−1 [(10 × 222 kJ)
+(2 × 180 kJ)]. In addition, the net production of four
ATP by substrate phosphorylation in glycolysis and the
CAC traps a total of about 125 kJ energy. Therefore, the
aerobic oxidation of one glucose molecule traps a total
of about 2705 kJ, which represents an efﬁciency of about
94 percent (2709/2869 × 100%) given that the G◦′
for the oxidation of glucose is about −2869 kJ mol−1.
In this section we will discuss the third stage of cel-
lular respiration—the transfer of electrons from NADH
and FADH2 to oxygen and the accompanying conver-
sion of redox energy to ATP. The transfer of electrons
from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen involves a sequence

184
Chapter 10 / Cellular Respiration: Unlocking the Energy Stored in Photoassimilates
of electron carriers arranged in an electron transport
chain. Membrane fractionation studies have shown that
the enzymes and electron carriers making up the elec-
tron transport chain are organized predominantly into
four large multimolecular complexes (complexes I—IV)
and two mobile carriers located in the inner mitochon-
drial membrane (Figure 10.9). In this sense, there are
a great number of similarities between the mitochon-
drial inner membrane and the thylakoid membranes
of the chloroplast (compare Figure 10.9 with Figure
7.6). This is not unexpected, since the principal func-
tion of each membrane is energy transformation and
many of the same or similar components are involved.
The path of electrons from NADH to oxygen can be
summarized as follows. Electrons from NADH enter
the electron transport chain through Complex I, known
as NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. In addition to
several proteins, this complex also contains a tightly
bound molecule of ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN)
and several nonheme iron-sulphur centers. Complex
I conveys the electrons from NADH to ubiquinone.
Ubiquinone is a benzoquinone—its structure and func-
tion are similar to the plastoquinone found in the
thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts (see Chapter 5).
Like plastoquinone, ubiquinone is highly lipid solu-
ble and diffuses freely in the plane of the membrane.
It is not permanently associated with Complex I, but
forms a pool of mobile electron acceptors that con-
veys electrons between Complex I and Complex III.
Ubiquinol (the fully reduced form of ubiquinone) is
oxidized by Complex III, or cytochrome c reduc-
tase. Complex III contains cytochromes b and c1 and
an iron-sulphur center. Complex III in turn reduces a
molecule of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c is a peripheral
protein, located on the side of the membrane facing the
intermembrane space. Like plastocyanin in chloroplasts,
cytochrome c is a mobile carrier and conveys electrons
between Complex III and the terminal complex in the
chain, Complex IV. Also known as cytochrome c oxi-
dase, Complex IV contains cytochromes a and a3 and
copper. Electrons are passed ﬁrst from cytochrome c
to cytochrome a, then to cytochrome a3, and ﬁnally to
molecular oxygen.
All of the oxidative enzymes of the citric acid cycle,
with one exception, are located in the matrix. The
one exception is succinic dehydrogenase (Figure 10.8,
reaction 7). This enzyme is an integral protein com-
plex (Complex II) that is tightly bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane (Figure 10.9). In fact, succinic
dehydrogenase is the preferred marker enzyme for inner
membranes when doing mitochondrial fractionations.
Complex II, known as succinate-ubiquinone oxidore-
ductase, contains ﬂavin adenine di-nucleotide (FAD),
several nonheme iron proteins, and iron-sulphur cen-
ters. Like Complex I, succinic dehydrogenase transfers
electrons from succinate to a molecule of ubiquinone
from the membrane pool. From there the electrons pass
through Complexes III and IV to molecular oxygen.
It is important to note that Figure 10.9 presents a
static, essentially linear representation of electron ﬂow
in mitochondria. In vivo, the organization is far more
dynamic. In Chapter 7 we showed that the electron
transport complexes of the photosynthetic membranes
were independently distributed, rather than organized in
one supermolecular complex. Similar arguments apply
here. The several complexes are not found in equal sto-
ichiometry and are free to diffuse independently within
the plane of the inner membrane. The large complexes

and cytochrome c, which function as mobile carriers and

on the basis of random collision.
10.8 ENERGY IS CONSERVED IN
THE FORM OF ATP IN
ACCORDANCE WITH
CHEMIOSMOSIS
As electrons are passed from NADH (or FADH2) to
oxygen through the electron transport chain, there is a
substantial drop in free energy. The actual free energy
change is quantitatively the same, but of opposite sign, to
the amount consumed when electrons are moved from
water to NADPH in photosynthesis (Chapter 7). This
energy is conserved ﬁrst in the form of a proton gradient
and ultimately as ATP. The energetics for ATP synthe-
sis is explained by Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis,
described earlier in Chapter 5. Here the focus is on
speciﬁc, biochemical mechanistic details of the proton
gradient and ATP synthesis as it applies to mitochondria.
Studies of P/O ratios (the atoms of phosphorous
esteriﬁed as ATP relative to the atoms of oxygen
reduced) and various inhibitors have established that
there are three transitions in the electron transport
chain that are associated with ATP synthesis. Put
another way, when internal or matrix NADH is
oxidized, the P/O ratio is approximately 3. According to
Mitchell’s hypothesis, then, these transitions represent
locations, generally described as proton pumps, where
contributions are made to a proton gradient across the
mitochondrial inner membrane. The three locations,
associated with Complexes I, III, and IV, respectively,
are identiﬁed in Figure 10.9. The resulting proton
gradient then drives ATP synthesis via a F0-F1-ATP
synthase complex located in the same membrane
(see below). Because mitochondrial ATP synthesis is
closely tied to oxygen consumption, it is referred to as
oxidative phosphorylation.
In the course of mitochondrial electron transport,
protons are extruded from the matrix into the intermem-
brane space. Proton extrusion associated with Complex
I (site 1) can be explained by the vectorial arrangement
of the complex across the membrane. When a pair of
electrons is donated to the complex by NADH, a pair
of protons are picked up from the matrix. When the
electrons are subsequently passed on to ubiquinone,
the protons are released into the intermembrane space.
Proton extrusion associated with Complex III (site 2) is
probably due to the operation of a ‘‘Q-cycle,’’ described
in Chapter 7 (see Chapter 7, Figure 7.10). The contri-
bution of cytochrome c oxidase (site 3) to the proton
gradient has been the subject of some discussion for
many years. Experiments with isolated enzyme incor-
porated into lipid vesicles indicate that cytochrome c
oxidase was capable of transferring protons across mem-
branes. These results are difﬁcult to explain, because
cytochromes exchange only electrons, not protons, when
reduced and oxidized. However, the H+/electron pair
ratio for site 3 is about 2, which can readily be explained
by the two protons consumed from the matrix when
oxygen is reduced to water. This is similar in principle
to the production of protons in the intrathylakoid space,
as water is oxidized early in photosynthetic electron
transport (see Chapter 7, Figure 7.6). The stoichiome-
try of proton ‘‘extrusion’’ (the term is applied whether
or not the protons are physically carried across the
membrane) has been studied extensively. It appears that
approximately nine protons are extruded for each pair
of electrons conveyed from internal (or matrix) NADH
to oxygen.
The link between a proton gradient and ATP
synthesis in the mitochondrion embodies the same prin-
ciples previously described for ATP synthesis in the
chloroplast: (1) the inner membrane is virtually imper-
meable to protons; (2) a proton motive force (pmf)
is established across the membrane by a combination
of membrane potential and proton disequilibrium; and
(3) ATP synthesis is driven by the return of protons
to the matrix through an integral membrane protein
complex known variously as ATP synthase, coupling
factor, or F0-F1-ATPase. According to equation 10.8,
pmf consists of two principal components: a chemical
component, that is, pH, which reﬂects the difference
in H+ concentration, and an electrical component (),
which reﬂects a difference in charge between the matrix
and the intermembrane space.
pmf = −59V△pH + △
(10.8)
Due to the capacity of the cytosol to buffer changes
in pH in the intermembrane space, pH contributes
minimally to the overall pmf in mitochondria. Thus, in
contrast to the chloroplast, the difference in electrical
charge () across the inner membrane is the major
factor contributing to the proton motive force generated
by mitochondria.
Mitochondrial ATP synthase is structurally and
functionally similar to the chloroplast enzyme. It con-
sists of a hydrophobic, channel-forming portion (F0) that
spans the membrane plus a multimeric, matrix-facing
peripheral protein (F1) that couples proton transloca-
tion to ATP synthesis. As in the case of chloroplasts,
the H+/ATP ratio is approximately 3. Because nine
protons are extruded for each pair of electrons mov-
ing through the entire chain, this means that a total
of three ATP molecules could be formed from each
NADH produced in the matrix. For electrons entering
the chain from extramitochondrial NADH, succinate, or
via the rotenone-insensitive dehydrogenase (see below),
all three of which bypass site 1, a maximum of two ATP
could be formed.

Unlike the chloroplast, most of the ATP synthe-
sized in the mitochondrion is utilized elsewhere in the
cell. This requires that the ATP be readily transported
out of the organelle. As well, a supply of ADP and
inorganic phosphate is required in order to maintain
maximum rates of electron transport and ATP synthe-
sis. This is accomplished by two separate translocator
proteins located in the inner membrane. An adenine
nucleotide transporter located in the inner mem-
brane (Figure 10.10) exchanges ATP and ADP on a
one-for-one basis. An inorganic phosphate translocator
exchanges Pi for hydroxyl ions.

plants, animals, and microorganisms. Plant mitochon-
dria contain, in addition, several other redox enzymes,
at least two of which are unique to plants (Figure 10.11).
These enzymes have been discovered largely by virtue of
their insensitivity to certain classic inhibitors of electron
transport.
10.9.1 PLANT MITOCHONDRIA
CONTAIN EXTERNAL
DEHYDROGENASES
Unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria con-
tain ‘‘external’’ dehydrogenases that face the intermem-
brane space and are capable of oxidizing cytosolic
NADH and NADPH respectively (Figure 10.11). As
a consequence, electrons from the oxidation of either
cytosolic NADH or NADPH are donated directly to
the ubiquinone pool. Because the external dehydroge-
nase enzymes do not span the membrane, they will not
translocate protons as Complex I does. Consequently,
only two ATP can be formed from the transfer of each
pair of electrons to oxygen.
10.9.2 PLANTS HAVE A
ROTENONE-INSENSITIVE
NADH DEHYDROGENASE
The reduction of ubiquinone by Complex I is sensitive
to inhibition by rotenone and amytal. Plants, however,
appear to have another NADH dehydrogenase that is
insensitive to both of these electron transport inhibitors.
Called the rotenone-insensitive dehydrogenase, this
enzyme will oxidize only internal, or matrix, NADH
(Figure 10.11). The enzyme must therefore be located
on the inner surface of the membrane, facing the matrix.

10.9 Plants Contain Several Alternative Electron Transport Pathways
187
As with the external NADH and NADPH dehydro-
genase enzymes, electrons entering the chain via the
rotenone-insensitive dehydrogenase can generate only
two ATP per electron pair.
Thus, the inner membrane of plant mitochon-
dria contain four distinct NAD(P)H dehydrogenases
exhibiting different P/O ratios: (1) an internal NADH
dehydrogenase; (2) a rotenone-insensitive NADH dehy-
drogenase; (3) an external NADH dehydrogenase; and
(4) an external NADPH dehydrogenase.
10.9.3 PLANTS EXHIBIT
CYANIDE-RESISTANT
RESPIRATION
Cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) is inhibited by
cyanide (CN−), carbon monoxide (CO), and azide (N−
3 ).
In many animals, all three of these inhibitors completely
inhibit respiratory O2 uptake. By contrast, most plants
or plant tissues show considerable resistance to these
inhibitors. In tissues such as roots and leaves of spinach
(Spinacea oleraceae) or pea (Pisum sativum), for example,
cyanide-resistant respiration may account for as much
as 40 percent of total respiration. Cyanide-resistant res-
piration is, however, sensitive to inhibition by hydrox-
amic acid derivatives such as salicylhydroxamic acid
(SHAM). This cyanide-resistant, SHAM-sensitive res-
piration is attributed to a so-called alternative oxidase
(Figure 10.12). The pathway is commonly referred
to as the alternative respiratory pathway, or, sim-
ply, the alternative pathway. Although the existence
of a cyanide-resistant alternative respiratory pathway
has been widely accepted for more than a decade,
the nature of the oxidase enzyme itself proved difﬁ-
cult to unravel. The enzyme has been difﬁcult to study
by conventional biochemical techniques; the protein
appears to be relatively unstable and loses its acti-
vity rapidly upon isolation from the membrane. How-
ever, through a molecular biological approach, a gene
encoding the oxidase protein has been cloned, ﬁrst from
Sauromatum guttatum, the voodoo lily, and since from
tobacco, soybean, and other plants. This has led to sig-
niﬁcant advances in our understanding of the regulation
of the enzyme.
The alternative oxidase is composed of two identical
subunits (a homodimer) that span the inner mitochon-
drial membrane, with the active site facing the matrix
side of the membrane. It functions as a ubiquinone
O2 oxidoreductase; that is, it accepts electrons from
the ubiquinone pool and transfers them directly to
oxygen. This is an important characteristic of the alter-
native oxidase because it means that electrons processed
by this enzyme bypass at least two sites for proton
extrusion. Consequently, energy that would otherwise
be conserved as ATP is, in the case of the alterna-
tive oxidase, converted to heat instead. Depending on
whether electrons are initially donated to Complex
I, the rotenone-insensitive NADH-dehydrogenase, or
succinic dehydrogenase, electrons passing through the
alternative oxidase will contribute to the synthesis of
one ATP or none (Figure 10.12).
The physiological role of alternative pathway respi-
ration is still uncertain. One possible role is thermoge-
nesis, a hypothesis based largely on events in the ﬂoral
development in certain members of the family Araceae.
Just prior to pollination in species such as skunk cab-
bage (Symplocarpus foetidus), the tissues of the spadix
(the structure that bears both male and female ﬂow-
ers) undergoes a surge in oxygen consumption, called
a respiratory crisis. The respiratory crisis is attributed
almost entirely to an increase in alternative pathway res-
piration and can elevate the temperature of the spadix
by as much as 10◦C above ambient. The high tempera-
ture volatilizes certain odoriferous amines (hence, skunk
cabbage) that attract insect pollinators. Thermogenesis
does not, however, appear to be the function of the
alternative pathway in roots and leaves. In one study
of an arctic herb, for example, the alternative pathway

accounts for up to 75 percent of total respiration but, in
part because the heat is rapidly dissipated, accounts for
no more than a 0.02◦C rise in leaf temperature.
A second hypothesis to explain the alternative path-
way is referred to as the energy overﬂow hypothesis.
This hypothesis is based on two general observations.
First, in most tissues the alternative pathway is inoper-
ative until the normal cytochrome pathway has become
saturated. Second, the rate of the alternative pathway can
be increased by increasing the supply of carbohydrate
to cells. In spinach (Spinacea oleraceae), for example, the
alternative pathway is engaged only after photosynthesis
has been in operation for several hours and has built up
a supply of carbohydrate. In other words, the alternative
pathway is generally engaged when there is an excess
supply of carbohydrate, over and above what is required
for metabolism or processed for storage. The function
of the alternative pathway, according to this hypothesis,
would be to burn off temporary accumulations of excess
carbon that might otherwise interfere with source-sink
relationships and inhibit translocation.
In addition, the induction of the alternative oxidase
represents a mechanism to prevent the overreduction of
the respiratory electron transport chain, which would
diminish the probability of superoxide formation and
oxidative stress under conditions where ATP con-
sumption has been slowed by either low temperature or
other stresses.
10.10 MANY SEEDS STORE
CARBON AS OILS THAT ARE
CONVERTED TO SUGAR
Although lipids are a principal constituent of membranes
and are stored by many tissues, they are not frequently
used as a source of respiratory carbon. A major excep-
tion to this rule is found in germinating seeds, many
of which store large quantities of lipids, principally
triglycerides, as reserve carbon (Table 10.1). Storage
lipids are deposited as oil droplets (also called oil bod-
ies, oleosomes, or spherosomes), which are normally
found in storage cells of cotyledons or endosperm.
Since fats and oils are not water soluble, plants are
unable to translocate fats and oils through the phloem
by pressure ﬂow from seed storage tissues to the elon-
gating roots and shoots where the energy and carbon are
required to support growth. The fatty acids must ﬁrst be
converted to a form that is more readily translocated by
the aqueous phloem. Usually this is sucrose (or some-
times stachyose), which is readily translocated from the
storage cells containing the oil droplets to the embryo
where the sucrose is metabolized. Complete conver-
sion of triglycerides to sucrose is a complex process,
involving the interaction of the oil bodies, glyoxysomes,
mitochondria, and the cytosol (Figure 10.13).
We can summarize the conversion of triglycerides
to sucrose as follows. The ﬁrst step is the hydrolysis
of triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. This
is accomplished through the action of lipase enzymes,
which probably act at the surface of the oil droplet. The
fatty acid then enters the glyoxysome, an organelle
similar in structure to the peroxisome found in leaves
but with many different enzymes. In the glyoxysome,
the fatty acid undergoes β-oxidation; the fatty acid
chain is cleaved at every second carbon, resulting in the
formation of acetyl-CoA.
Some of the acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloac-
etate (originating in the mitochondrion) to form cit-
rate (6 carbons) in what is known as the glyoxylate
cycle. The citrate in turn is converted to isocitrate,
which then breaks down into one molecule of suc-
cinate (4 carbons) and one molecule of glyoxylate
(2 carbons). The succinate returns to the mitochon-
drion where it enters the citric acid cycle, regenerating
oxaloacetate, which is necessary to keep the glyoxy-
late cycle turning. Glyoxylate combines with another
acetyl-CoA to produce malate. The malate then enters
the cytosol where it is ﬁrst oxidized to oxaloacetate and

decarboxylated to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The
glyoxylate cycle thus involves enzymes of both the gly-
oxysome and the mitochondrion. Two enzymes of the
cycle are unique to plants: isocitrate lyase, which con-
verts isocitrate to succinate plus glyoxylate, and malate
synthase, which condenses an acetyl group with gly-
oxylate to form malate. The malate is then translocated
from the glyoxysome into the cytosol where it is quickly
oxidized to oxaloacetate by the enzyme malate dehy-
drogenase. The overall effect of the glyoxylate cycle
is to catalyze the formation of oxaloacetate from two
molecules of acetyl-CoA.
In the cytosol, oxaloacetate derived from the
glyoxylate cycle is decarboxylated via the enzyme
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) to
form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Through a sequence
of reactions that is essentially a reversal of glycolysis,
PEP is converted to glucose. The conversion of PEP
to glucose by a reversal of glycolysis is known as glu-
coneogenesis. Gluconeogenesis utilizes the enzymes
of glycolysis, with signiﬁcant differences. The gly-
colytic phosphofructokinase and hexokinase reactions
(Figure 10.4) are effectively irreversible—their free
energy changes are highly unfavorable in the direction
of glucose synthesis. During gluconeogenesis, these
reactions are replaced by reactions that make glucose
synthesis
more
thermodynamically
favorable.
The
conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-P
is catalyzed by cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
and the conversion of glucose-6-P to glucose is
catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase. These differences
are signiﬁcant because they allow both directions to
be thermodynamically favorable, yet be independently
regulated. One direction can be activated while the
other is inhibited, thus avoiding what might otherwise
end up as a futile cycle. The glycerol resulting from
lipase action in the oil droplet also enters the cytosol,
where it is ﬁrst phosphorylated with ATP to form
α-glycerolphosphate and then oxidized to dihydroxy-
acetone phosphate (DHAP). The DHAP can also be
converted to sucrose by reversal of glycolysis. Some of
the energy stored in triglycerides is conserved in the
sucrose formed by gluconeogenesis, but β-oxidation
of fatty acids in the glyoxysome also produces a large
amount of NADH. The glyoxysome is unable to
reoxidize NADH directly, but it can be used to reduce
oxaloacetate to malate (Figure 10.13). The malate then
moves into the mitochondrion where it is reoxidized by
malate dehydrogenase. Malate thus serves as a shuttle,
carrying reducing equivalents between the glyoxysome
and the mitochondrion. Reoxidation of malate inside
the mitochondrion yields NADH, which can then enter
the electron transport chain and drive ATP synthesis.
10.11 RESPIRATION PROVIDES
CARBON SKELETONS FOR
BIOSYNTHESIS
Before leaving the subject of cellular respiration, it is
important to note that production of reducing poten-
tial and ATP is not the sole purpose of the respiratory
pathways. In addition to energy, the synthesis of nucleic
acids, protein, cellulose, and all other cellular molecules
requires carbon skeletons as well. As noted at the begin-
ning of this chapter, respiration also serves to modify
the carbon skeletons of storage compounds to form
these basic building blocks of cell structure. A few of
the more important building blocks that can be formed
from intermediates in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle
are represented in Figure 10.14.
The withdrawal of glycolytic and citric acid cycle
intermediates for the synthesis of other molecules
means, of course, that not all of the respiratory substrate
will be fully oxidized to CO2 and water. The ﬂow
of carbon through respiration no doubt represents a
balance between the metabolic demands of the cell for
ATP to drive various energy-consuming functions on
the one hand and demands for the reducing equivalents

give some indication of the importance of these two schemes in biosynthesis.
and carbon skeletons required to build cell structure on
the other.
It is also important to note that during periods of
active synthesis, diversion of carbon from the citric acid
cycle for synthetic reactions will lead to a signiﬁcant
reduction in the level of oxaloacetate. These synthetic
reactions require not only carbon, but energy in the
form of reducing potential and ATP as well. Without
some means of compensating for this loss of oxaloac-
etate, the cycle will slow down or, in the extreme case,
come to a complete halt and energy production will be
impaired. This eventuality is precluded by the action
of two cytosolic enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
carboxylase (see Chapter 15) and malate dehydrogenase.
All plants, not just those with C4 photosynthetic activity
(see Chapter 15), have some level of PEP carboxylase
activity that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into
oxaloacetate:
PEP + HCO−
3 →oxaloacetate
(10.9)
In this case the PEP is derived from glycolysis.
Although there is some evidence that oxaloacetate
may be translocated directly into the mitochondrion, it
is more likely that oxaloacetate is quickly reduced to
malate by the action of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase:
oxaloacetate + NADH →malate + NAD+
(10.10)
The malate would then pass into the mitochondrion, via
a malate (or dicarboxylate) translocator, where it is reox-
idized to oxaloacetate by the action of a mitochondrial
malate dehydrogenase:
malate + NAD+ →oxaloacetate + NADH
(10.11)
The replenishment of oxaloacetate in this way is an
example of a ‘‘ﬁlling-up’’ mechanism or anaplerotic
pathway. Thus carbon from glycolysis is delivered to the
citric acid cycle through two separate but equally impor-
tant streams: (1) to citrate via pyruvate and acetyl-CoA
and (2) from PEP via oxaloacetate and malate to com-
pensate for carbon ‘‘lost’’ to synthesis. Anaplerotic
reactions such as the latter help to ensure that diver-
sion of carbon for synthesis does not adversely inﬂuence
the overall carbon balance between energy-generating
catabolic reactions and biosynthetic anabolic reactions.
In addition to the normal enzymes of the citric acid
cycle, plant mitochondria tend to have signiﬁcant levels

191
of NAD+ -malic enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidative
decarboxylation of malate:
malate+NAD+ →pyruvate+CO2+NADH
(10.12)
The pyruvate may be further metabolized by pyruvate
dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA and from there enter the
citric acid cycle. Thus the mitochondrial pool of malate
may replenish the citric acid intermediates through
either oxaloacetate or pyruvate.
In addition to serving an anaplerotic role, the uptake
and oxidation of malate by mitochondria via either malic
enzyme or malate dehydrogenase also provides an alter-
native pathway for metabolizing malate. This alternative
pathway may be particularly signiﬁcant in plants such
as those of the family Crassulaceae (see Chapter 15)
and others that store signiﬁcant levels of malate in their
vacuoles. Finally, it should be noted that diversion of
pyruvate through oxaloacetate and malate bypasses the
pyruvate kinase step in glycolysis (Figure 10.5, reaction
6) and thus reduces the yield of ATP by one. This reduc-
tion is, however, offset by gains achieved by reduction
of malate in the cytosol and its subsequent reoxida-
tion in the mitochondrion. This sequence of reactions
effectively shuttles extramitochondrial NADH (gener-
ated during glycolysis) into the mitochondrion, where
it can be used to generate three molecules of ATP.
This is a gain of one ATP over the two ATP gener-
ated via the NADH-reductase route described earlier
for extramitochondrial NADH.
10.12 RESPIRATORY RATE VARIES
WITH DEVELOPMENT AND
METABOLIC STATE
The study of respiration at the level of individual organs
or the whole plant becomes much more difﬁcult than it
is for the study of individual cells. Whole plant respi-
ration is normally studied by measuring the uptake of
oxygen or the evolution of CO2, but respiration rates
obtained this way are highly variable. The balance of O2
and CO2 exchange is dependent on the substrate being
respired and the balance of fermentation, citric acid
cycle, and alternative pathway activities at any point
in time. In addition, respiration rates differ between
organs, change with age and developmental state, and
are markedly inﬂuenced by temperature, oxygen, salts,
and other environmental factors. Nevertheless, the study
of respiration at the organ and plant level is a ﬁeld of
active study. Understanding respiration at this level
has important implications for the plant physiologist
interested in growth and development, for the physio-
logical ecologist interested in plant biomass production,
and the agricultural scientist because of its impact on
productivity and yield.

FIGURE 10.15 Respiratory rate as a function of age. This
type of curve applies generally to most herbaceous plants,
tissues, and organs. The magnitude of the climacteric
will vary—some organs exhibit little or no climacteric
rise.
As a general rule, respiratory rate is a reﬂection
of metabolic demands. Younger plants, organs, or tis-
sues respire more rapidly than older plants, organs, or
tissues (Figure 10.15). The rapid rate of respiration
during early stages of growth is presumably related to
synthetic requirements of rapidly dividing and enlarg-
ing cells. As the plant or organ ages and approaches
maturity, growth and its associated metabolic demands
decline. Many organs, especially leaves and some fruits,
experience a transient rise in respiration, called a cli-
macteric, that marks the onset of senescence and the
degenerative changes that precede death. Typically the
climacteric rise in O2 consumption is accompanied by
a decline in oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that
ATP production is no longer tightly coupled to elec-
tron transport. The respiration rate of woody stems
and branches, expressed on a weight or mass basis, also
declines as they grow. This is because as the diameter
increases, the relative proportion of nonrespiring woody
tissue also increases.
Carbon lost to the plant due to respiration can
represent a signiﬁcant proportion of the available
carbon. Actual respiration rates for plant tissues range
in the extreme between barely detectable (0.005 μmol

h−1) in dormant seeds to 1000 μmol

respiration, especially of roots and similar tissues, is

percent of daily photoassimilate is lost as respiratory
CO2. In tropical rainforest species, probably because of
accelerated enzymic activities at higher temperatures,
this loss may exceed 70 percent. Of the total daily

10.13 RESPIRATION RATES

ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS
10.13.1 LIGHT
The effects of light on mitochondrial respiration have
been the subject of considerable debate for some time.
Traditionally, photosynthesis investigators and crop
physiologists have tacitly assumed that respiration con-
tinues in the light at a rate comparable to that in
the dark. The true rate of photosynthesis is therefore
taken as equal to the apparent rate (measured as CO2
uptake) plus the rate of respiration (CO2 evolved) in the
dark. However, attempts to study respiration in green
leaves have led to alternative and conﬂicting conclusions.
These range from complete inhibition of mitochondrial
activities, to partial operation of the citric acid cycle, or
to stimulation of respiration by light. The problem lies
in the difﬁculty of measuring respiration during a period
when gas exchange is dominated by the overwhelming
ﬂux of CO2 and O2 due to photosynthesis, the recycling
of CO2 within the leaf, and the exchange of metabolites
by chloroplasts and mitochondria.
Light effects on respiration during a subsequent
dark period have been demonstrated. For example, dark
respiratory rates in leaves adapted to full sun (sun leaves)
are generally higher than those of leaves of the same
species adapted to shade (shade leaves) (Table 10.2). As
well, the rate is consistently higher in mature leaves of
shade-intolerant species than in shade-tolerant species.
Indeed, a reduced respiratory rate appears to be a fairly
consistent response to low irradiance. This is prob-
ably related to lower growth rates also observed in
shade-grown plants, but it is not known which is cause
and which is effect. It is projected that low respiratory
and growth rates may confer a survival advantage under
conditions of deep shade. The basis for light regula-
tion of respiratory rate is unknown, although some have
suggested that low respiratory rates under conditions of
low irradiance may reﬂect availability of substrate. For
example, the respiration rate 1 to 2 hours following a
period of active photosynthesis is higher than after a
long dark period.
Other experiments, however, have shown that dark
respiratory rates do not correlate with CO2 supply
during the previous light period. This seems to sug-
gest a more direct effect on respiration. The pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDH) of the mitochondrion
can exist either in an active, nonphosphorylated form
or an inactive, phosphorylated form (Figure 10.16). It
has been shown that the photorespiratory-generated
NH+
4 (Chapter 8) stimulates the phosphorylation of
the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
thereby inhibiting the rate of respiration in the light
by decreasing the rate at which acetyl-CoA is generated
for the CAC. Light regulation of respiration remains a
controversial issue in plant physiology.
10.13.2 TEMPERATURE
One of the most commonly applied quantitative mea-
sures used to describe the effect of temperature on a
process is the temperature coefﬁcient, or Q10, given
by the expression:
Q10 = rate at(t + 10)◦C
rate at t◦C
(10.13)
At temperatures between 5◦C and about 25◦C or 30◦C,
respiration rises exponentially with temperature and the

Summary
193
Q10 value is approximately 2.0 in many but not all plants
(see Chapter 14). Within this temperature range, a dou-
bling of rate for every 10◦C rise in temperature is typical
of enzymic reactions. At temperatures above 30◦C, the
Q10 in most plants begins to fall off as substrate avail-
ability becomes limiting. In particular, the solubility of
O2 declines as temperatures increase and the diffusion
rate (with a Q10 close to 1) does not increase sufﬁ-
ciently to compensate. As temperatures approach 50◦C
to 60◦C, thermal denaturation of respiratory enzymes
and damage to membranes bring respiration to a halt.
Some investigators have observed differences in
the rate of respiration in tropical, temperate, and arc-
tic species at different temperatures. For example, the
respiration rate of leaves of tropical plants at 30◦C
is about the same as that of arctic species at 10◦C.
The temperature coefﬁcient (Q10) for respiration is
the same in both cases and there is no evidence of
intrinsic differences in the biochemistry of respiration.
It is likely that the differences reﬂect differences in
temperature optima for growth of arctic and tropi-
cal species—optima determined by factors other than
respiration—and the consequent metabolic demand for
ATP. A detailed discussion of the effects of temperature
stress and acclimation on respiration will be focused in
Chapters 13 and 14.
10.13.3 OXYGEN AVAILABILITY
As the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen availability
is obviously an important factor in determining respi-
ration rate. The oxygen content of the atmosphere is
relatively stable at about 21 percent O2. The equilib-
rium concentration of oxygen in air-saturated water,
including the cytosol, is approximately 250 μM. How-
ever, cytochrome c oxidase has a very high afﬁnity for
oxygen with a Km (see Chapter 8, Box 8.1) less than
1 μM. Under normal circumstances, oxygen is rarely a
limiting factor.
There are some situations, however, where oxygen
availability may become a signiﬁcant factor. One is in
bulky tissues with low surface-to-volume ratios, such
as potato tubers and similar storage tissues, where the
diffusion of oxygen may be slow enough to restrict
respiration. This may not be a serious problem, however.
A signiﬁcant volume—as much as 40 percent—of roots
and similar tissues may be occupied by intercellular air
spaces that aid in the rapid distribution of O2 absorbed
from the soil or, in some cases, from the aerial portions
of the plant. Plants are most likely to experience oxygen
deﬁcits during periods of ﬂooding, when air in the large
pore spaces of the soil is displaced by water, thereby
decreasing the oxygen supply to the roots. For similar
reasons, plants grown in hydroponic culture must be
aerated to maintain adequate oxygen levels in the vicinity
of the roots (Chapter 3).
SUMMARY
Cellular respiration consists of a series of interde-
pendent pathways by which carbohydrate and other
molecules are oxidized for the purpose of retrieving
the energy stored in photosynthesis and to obtain the
carbon skeletons that serve as precursors for other
molecules used in the growth and maintenance of
the cell. Plants store excess photosynthate either as
starch, a long linear or branched polymer of glucose,
in the chloroplast stroma or as fructans, a polymer of
fructose, in the vacuole. Storage carbohydrates such
as starch and fructans are enzymatically degraded to
glucose or fructose, which then enter the cytosolic
hexose phosphate pool as either glucose-1-phosphate,
glucose-6-phosphate, or fructose-6-phosphate. Hexose
phosphates exit the hexose-P pool by conversion to
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). FBP is subsequently
converted to triose-P, which is the starting point for
glycolysis, a series of reactions that ultimately produce
pyruvate. In the process, a small amount of ATP and
reducing potential is generated. The intermediates
in glycolysis are three-carbon sugars, many of which
are precursors to triglycerides and amino acids. Pre-
cursors with four and ﬁve carbons are produced by
an alternative route for glucose metabolism called the
oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway also produces NADPH
(as opposed to NADH), which provides reducing
potential when required for biosynthetic reactions in
plants.
The fate of pyruvate depends on the availability
of oxygen. In an anaerobic environment, pyruvate is
reduced (usually to ethanol), while in the presence of
oxygen pyruvate is ﬁrst oxidized to acetyl-CoA and
carbon dioxide. The acetate group is then further
oxidized to carbon dioxide and water through the cit-
ric acid cycle (CAC). The CAC enzymes are located
predominantly in the matrix of the mitochondrion.
Altogether, eight enzyme-catalyzed steps degrade the
acetate group to carbon dioxide and water. The cycle
includes four oxidations that yield NADH at three
steps and FADH2 at another. One molecule of ATP
is generated in a substrate-level phosphorylation and
the original acetate acceptor, oxaloacetate, is regener-
ated, which allows the cycle to continue. The NADH
and FADH2 produced in the CAC are oxidized via an
electron transport chain found in the mitochondrial
inner membrane. The chain consists of four multi-
protein complexes linked by mobile electron carriers.
The ﬁnal complex, cytochrome oxidase, transfers the
electrons to molecular oxygen, forming water. At three
points in the chain, the free energy drop associated
with electron transport is used to establish a proton
gradient across the membrane. As in the chloroplasts,
this proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis.

194
Chapter 10 / Cellular Respiration: Unlocking the Energy Stored in Photoassimilates
The CAC and electron transport chain are virtually
identical in all organisms. Plants, however, have an
alternative oxidase that intercepts electrons early in the
chain, thus bypassing two of the three proton-pumping
sites. When using this route, at least two-thirds less
ATP is formed and much of the electron energy is
converted to heat. The alternative oxidase, at least in
some plants, has been associated with thermogenesis,
particularly in certain members of the Araceae where
the higher temperatures volatilize amines that appear
to attract insect pollinators. The alternative oxidase
may also serve to ‘‘burn off’’ excess carbohydrate as
well as protect against oxidative stress by preventing
the overreduction of the respiratory electron transport
chain.
Many seeds store carbon as fats and oils, which
must ﬁrst be converted to sugar in order to be respired.
After the fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-CoA
units, a complex series of reactions involving enzymes
of the mitochondrion, the glyoxysome, and the cytosol
convert the acetate units to phosphoenolpyruvate. The
pyruvate is then converted to glucose by gluconeogen-
esis, a process that is essentially a reversal of glycolysis.
The respiratory rate of whole plants and organs
varies widely with age, metabolic state, and environ-
mental conditions.

Nitrogen Assimilation
On a dry-weight basis, nitrogen is the fourth most
abundant nutrient element in plants. It is an essen-
tial constituent of proteins, nucleic acids, hormones,
chlorophyll, and a variety of other important primary
and secondary plant constituents. Most plants obtain the
bulk of their nitrogen from the soil in the form of either
nitrate (NO−
3 ) or ammonium (NH+
4 ), but the supply
of nitrogen in the soil pool is limited and plants must
compete with a variety of soil microorganisms for what
nitrogen is available. As a result, nitrogen is often a lim-
iting nutrient for plants, in both natural and agricultural
ecosystems.
The bulk of the atmosphere, 78 percent by volume,
consists of molecular nitrogen (N2, or dinitrogen),
an odorless, colorless gas. In spite of its abundance,
however, higher plants are unable to convert dinitro-
gen into a biologically useful form. The two nitrogen
atoms in dinitrogen are joined by an exceptionally sta-
ble bond (N ≡N) and plants do not have the enzyme
that will reduce this triple covalent bond. Only certain
prokaryote species are able to carry out this impor-
tant reaction. This situation presents plants with a
unique problem with respect to the uptake and assim-
ilation of nitrogen; plants must depend on prokaryote
organisms to convert atmospheric dinitrogen into a
usable form. The nature of this problem and the
solutions that have evolved are the subject of this
chapter.
The principal topics discussed in this chapter
include:
•
a review of the nitrogen cycle: the ﬂow of nitrogen
between three major global nitrogen pools,
•
the
biology
and
biochemistry
of
biological
nitrogen-ﬁxing systems, and
•
pathways for assimilation of ammonium and nitrate
nitrogen by plants.
11.1 THE NITROGEN CYCLE:
A COMPLEX PATTERN
OF EXCHANGE
The global nitrogen supply is generally distributed
between three major pools: the atmospheric pool, the
soil (and associated groundwater) pool, and nitrogen
contained within the biomass. Central to the idea of
a nitrogen cycle (Figure 11.1) is the pool of nitrogen
found in the soil. Nitrogen from the soil pool enters the
biomass principally in the form of nitrate (NO−
3 ) taken
up by plants and microorganisms. Once assimilated,
nitrate nitrogen is converted to organic nitrogen in the
form of amino acids and other nitrogenous building
blocks of proteins and other macromolecules. Nitrogen
moves further up the food chain when animals consume

wastes or the death and subsequent decomposition of all
organisms.
11.1.1 AMMONIFICATION,
NITRIFICATION,
AND DENITRIFICATION ARE
ESSENTIAL PROCESSES
IN THE NITROGEN CYCLE
In the process of decomposition, organic nitrogen is
converted to ammonia by a variety of microorgan-
isms including the fungi. This process is known as
ammoniﬁcation (Figure 11.1). Some of the ammonia
may volatilize and reenter the atmosphere, but most of
it is recycled to nitrate by soil bacteria. The ﬁrst step in
the formation of nitrate is the oxidization of ammonia
to nitrite (NO−
2 ) by bacteria of the genera Nitrosomonas
or Nitrococcus. Nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate by
members of the genus Nitrobacter. These two groups
are known as nitrifying bacteria and the result of their
activities is called nitriﬁcation. Nitrifying bacteria are
chemoautotrophs; that is, the energy obtained by oxi-
dizing inorganic substances such as ammonium or nitrite
is used to convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon.
In taking up nitrate from the soil, plants must
compete with bacteria known as denitriﬁers (e.g.,
Thiobacillus denitriﬁcans). By the process of denitriﬁca-
tion, these bacteria reduce nitrate to dinitrogen, which
is then returned to the atmosphere. Estimates for the
amount of nitrogen lost to the atmosphere by denitriﬁ-
cation range from 93 million to 190 million metric tons
annually.
11.2 BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN
FIXATION IS EXCLUSIVELY
PROKARYOTIC
The loss of nitrogen from the soil pool through denitri-
ﬁcation is largely offset by additions to the pool through
conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen to a combined
or ﬁxed form. The process of reducing dinitrogen to
ammonia is known as nitrogen ﬁxation or dinitrogen
ﬁxation. Just how much dinitrogen is ﬁxed on a global
basis is difﬁcult to determine with any accuracy. Figures
on the order of 200 to 250 million metric tons annually
have been suggested. Approximately 10 percent of the
dinitrogen ﬁxed annually is accounted for by nitrogen
oxides in the atmosphere. Lightning strikes and ultravi-
olet radiation each provide sufﬁcient energy to convert
dinitrogen to atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NO, N2O)
(Figure 11.1). Another 30 percent of the total dinitro-
gen ﬁxed, 80 million metric tons, is accounted for by
industrial nitrogen ﬁxation for the production of agri-
cultural fertilizers through the Haber-Bosch process
(Figure 11.1). However, by far, the bulk of the nitrogen
ﬁxed on a global scale, about 60 percent or 150 to 190
million metric tons annually, is accounted for by the
reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia by living organisms
(Figure 11.1).
Plants are eukaryotic organisms, distinguished by
the presence of a membrane-limited nuclear compart-
ment. Eukaryotic organisms are unable to ﬁx dinitrogen
because they do not have the appropriate biochemical
machinery. Bacteria and cyanobacteria are prokaryotic
organisms; the genetic material is not contained within a
membrane-limited organelle. Nitrogen ﬁxation is a pro-
karyotedomain,becauseonlyprokaryoteorganismshave
the enzyme complex, called dinitrogenase, that cata-
lyzes the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia. Simple
as this may seem, biological nitrogen ﬁxation turns out
to be a complex biochemical and physiological process.
Prokaryotes that ﬁx nitrogen, called nitrogen-
ﬁxers, include both free-living organisms and those
that form symbiotic associations with other organisms.
11.2.1 SOME NITROGEN-FIXING
BACTERIA ARE FREE-LIVING
ORGANISMS
Free-living, nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria are widespread.
Their habitats include marine and freshwater sedi-
ments, soils, leaf, and bark surfaces, and the intestinal
tracts of various animals. Although some species are
aerobic (e.g., Azotobacter, Beijerinckia), most will ﬁx dini-
trogen only under anaerobic conditions or in the pres-
ence of very-low-oxygen partial pressures (a condition
known as microaerobic). These include both nonpho-
tosynthetic genera (Clostridium, Bacillus, Klebsiella) and

11.3 Legumes Exhibit Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
197
photosynthetic genera (Chromatium, Rhodospirillum) of
bacteria. In addition to the bacteria, several genera of
cyanobacteria (principally Anabaena, Nostoc, Lyngbia, and
Calothrix) are represented by nitrogen-ﬁxing species.
Although free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms are
widespread, most grow slowly and, except for the photo-
synthetic species, tend to be conﬁned to habitats rich in
organic carbon. Because a high proportion of their res-
piratory energy is required to ﬁx dinitrogen, less energy
is therefore available for growth.
11.2.2 SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN
FIXATION INVOLVES SPECIFIC
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN
BACTERIA AND PLANTS
Several types of symbiotic nitrogen-ﬁxing associations
are
known,
including
the
well-known
association
between various species of bacteria and leguminous
plants. Some of the more important associations are
listed in Table 11.1. In symbiotic associations the plant is
identiﬁed as the host and the microbial partner is known
as the microsymbiont. The most common form of sym-
biotic association results in the formation of enlarged,
multicellular structures, called nodules, on the root
(or occasionally the stem) of the host plant (Figure 11.2).
In the case of legumes,1 the microsymbiont is a
bacterium of one of three genera: Rhizobium, Bradyrhi-
zobium, or Azorhizobium. Collectively, these organisms

the group into three families: Mimosaceae, Caesalpiniaceae,
and Fabaceae (S. B. Jones, A. E. Luchsinger, Plant Systematics,
New York: McGraw-Hill, 1986). Most of the economically
important, nitrogen-ﬁxing legumes are assigned to the
Fabaceae.
FIGURE 11.2 Nitrogen-ﬁxing nodules on roots of soybean

are referred to as rhizobia. Curiously, only one non-
leguminous genus, Parasponia (of the family Ulmaceae),
is known to form root nodules with a rhizobia symbiont.
The rhizobia are further divided into species and
subgroups called biovars (a biological variety) according
to their host range (Table 11.1). Most rhizobia are
restricted to nodulation with a limited number of host
plants while others are highly speciﬁc, infecting only
one host species.
Nodules are also found in certain nonleguminous
plants such as alder (Alnus), bayberry (Myrica), Australian
pine (Casuarina), some members of the family Rosaceae,
and certain tropical grasses. However, the microsym-
biont in these nonleguminous nodules is a ﬁlamentous
bacterium (Frankia) of the group actinomycetes. Both
Rhizobium and Frankia live freely in the soil but ﬁx
dinitrogen only when in symbiotic association with an
appropriate host plant.
A limited number of non-nodule-forming associa-
tions have been studied, such as that between Azolla and
the cyanobacterium Anabaena. Azolla is a small aquatic
fern that harbors Anabaena in pockets within its leaves.
In southeast Asia, Azolla has proven useful as green
manure in the rice paddy ﬁelds where it is either applied
as a manure or co-cultivated along with the rice plants.
Because more than 75 percent of the rice acreage consists
of ﬂooded ﬁelds, free-living cyanobacteria and anaero-
bic bacteria may also make a signiﬁcant contribution.
These practices have allowed Asian rice farmers to main-
tain high productivity for centuries without resorting to
added chemical fertilizers.
11.3 LEGUMES EXHIBIT
SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN
FIXATION
It is generally agreed that symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxers,
particularly legumes, contribute substantially more
nitrogen to the soil pool than do free-living bacteria.

198
Chapter 11 / Nitrogen Assimilation
Typically a hectare of legume-Rhizobium association
will ﬁx 25 to 60 kg of dinitrogen annually, while
nonsymbiotic organisms ﬁx less than 5 kg ha−1. There
are over 17,000 species of legumes. Even though only
20 percent have been examined for nodulation, 90
percent of those examined do form nodules. Given the
obvious signiﬁcance of the legume symbiosis to the
nitrogen cycle, it is worth examining in some detail.
11.3.1 RHIZOBIA INFECT THE HOST
ROOTS, WHICH INDUCES
NODULE DEVELOPMENT
The sequence of events beginning with bacterial infec-
tion of the root and ending with formation of mature,
nitrogen-ﬁxing nodules has been studied extensively
in the legumes, historically from the morphological
perspective and more recently from the biochemical/
molecular genetic perspective. Overall the process
involves a sequence of multiple interactions between the
bacteria and the host roots. In effect, the rhizobia and
the roots of the prospective host plant establish a dia-
logue in the form of chemical messages passed between
the two partners. Based on studies carried out primarily
with Glycine, Trifolium, and Pisum, as many as nine or ten
separate developmental stages have been recognized.
In order to simplify our discussion, however, we will
consider the events in four principal stages:
1. Multiplication of the rhizobia, colonization of the
rhizosphere, and attachment to epidermal and root
hair cells.
2. Characteristic curling of the root hairs and invasion
of the bacteria to form an infection thread.
3. Nodule initiation and development in the root cor-
tex. This stage is concurrent with stage 1.
4. Release of the bacteria from the infection thread and
their differentiation as specialized nitrogen-ﬁxing
cells.
The four principal stages are illustrated in Figure 11.3.
In this section, we will concentrate on the physiology
and morphology of infection and nodule development.
Genetic aspects will be addressed in a subsequent
section.
11.3.1.1 Early stage involves colonization and
nodule initiation.
Rhizobia are free-living, sapro-
phytic soil bacteria. Their numbers in the soil are highly
variable, from as few as zero or 10 to as many as 107
gram−1 of soil, depending on the structure of the soil,
water content, and a variety of other factors. In the
presence of host roots, the bacteria are encouraged
to multiply and colonize the rhizosphere. The initial
attraction of rhizobia to host roots appears to involve
positive chemotaxis, or movement toward a chemical
stimulant. Chemotaxis is an important adaptive feature
in microorganisms generally. It allows the organism

signals sent out from the host root. The rhizobia in turn stimulate the root hair to
curl while, at the same time, sending mitogenic signals that stimulate cell division
in the root cortex. (B) Rhizobia invade the root by digesting the root hair cell wall
and forming an infection thread. The rhizobia continue to multiply as the infection
thread elongates toward the root cortex. (C) The infection thread branches to pen-
etrate numerous cortical cells as a visibly evident nodule develops on the root. The
ﬁnal stage (not shown) is the release of rhizobia into the host cells and the activation
of the nitrogen-ﬁxing machinery.

to detect nutrients and other chemicals that are either
beneﬁcial or required for their growth and reproduc-
tion. A group of chemicals that have been implicated in
attraction of rhizobia are the ﬂavonoids (Figure 11.4).
Once rhizobia have colonized the rhizosphere, they
begin to synthesize morphogenic signal molecules called
nodulation factors, or nod factors. Nod factors are
derivatives of chitin, a β-(1 →4)-linked polymer of
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine found in the cell walls of fungi
and exoskeletons of insects. Nod factors are similar
polymers except that a fatty acid replaces the acetyl
group at one end of the molecule. Nod factors are con-
sequently considered lipo-chitooligosaccharides. Nod
factors secreted into the soil solution by the rhizobia
induce several signiﬁcant changes in the growth and
metabolism of the host roots as a prelude to rhizobial
invasion of the root hair and subsequent nodule develop-
ment. These changes (Figure 11.3A) include increased
root hair production and the development of shorter,
thicker roots. Stimulated by the nod factors to renew
their growth, the root hairs develop branching and curl
at the tip.
Before actually invading the host, rhizobia also
release mitogenic signals that stimulate localized cell
divisions in the root cortex. These cell divisions form
the primary nodule meristem, deﬁning the region in
which the nodule will eventually develop (Figure 11.3A).
A second center of cell division arises in the pericycle.
Eventually these two masses of dividing cells will fuse to
form the complete nodule.
Rhizobia-host speciﬁcity is probably determined
when the rhizobia attach to the root hairs and must
involve some form of recognition between symbiont and
host. As a general principle, recognition between cells
involves chemical linkages that form between unique
molecules on cell surfaces. In the case of rhizobia-host
interactions, recognition appears to involve two classes
of molecules: lectins and complex polysaccharides.
Lectins are small, nonenzymatic proteins synthesized

by the host and have the particular ability to recognize
and bind to speciﬁc complex carbohydrates.
Individual legume species each produce different
lectins with different sugar-binding speciﬁcities. Lectins
appear to recognize complex polysaccharides found
on the surface of the potential symbiont. Although
bacterial surfaces normally contain an array of com-
plex extracellular polysaccharides, the synthesis of addi-
tional nodulation-speciﬁc extracellular polysaccharides
is directed by bacterial genes that are activated in the
presence of ﬂavonoids in the host root exudate. Host
range speciﬁcity would thus result from attachment of
the rhizobium to the host root hair because of spe-
ciﬁc lectin-surface polysaccharide interactions. Support
for this hypothesis comes from experiments in which
the gene for pea lectin was introduced into roots of
white clover. The result was that clover roots could be
nodulated by strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum, biovar
viciae, which are usually speciﬁc for peas.
11.3.1.2 Second stage involves invasion of the
root hair and the formation of an infection thread.
In the second stage of nodulation, the bacterium must
penetrate the host cell wall in order to enter the space
between the wall and the plasma membrane. In pea, the
preferred attachment site is the tip of the growing root
hair. The root hairs of pea grow by tip growth; that is,
new wall material is laid down only at the tip of the elon-
gating hair cell. Colonies of attached rhizobia become
entrapped by the tip of the root hair as it curls around.
How rhizobia actually breach the cell wall is not known,
but the process almost certainly includes some degree
of wall degradation. There is some evidence that rhi-
zobia release enzymes such as pectinase, hemicellulase,
and cellulase, which degrade cell wall materials. These
enzymes could result in localized interference with the
assembly of the growing wall at the root tip and allow
the bacteria to breach the cell wall and gain access to
the underlying plasma membrane.
Once the rhizobia reach the outer surface of the
plasma membrane, tip growth of the root hair ceases
and the cell membrane begins to invaginate. The result
is a tubular intrusion into the cell called an infec-
tion thread, which contains the invading rhizobia
(Figure 11.3B). The infection thread elongates by adding
new membrane material by fusion with vesicles derived
from the Golgi apparatus. As the thread moves through
the root hair cell, a thin layer of cellulosic material is
deposited on the inner surface of its membrane. Because
this new wall material is continuous with the original
cell wall, the invading bacteria never actually enter the
host cell but remain technically outside the cell.
The infection thread continues to elongate until it
reaches the base of the root hair cell. Here it must again
breach the cell wall in order for the bacteria to gain
access to the next cell in their path. This is apparently

200
Chapter 11 / Nitrogen Assimilation
accomplished by fusing the infection thread membrane
with the plasma membrane. In the process, some bacteria
are released into the apoplastic space. These bacte-
ria apparently degrade the walls of the next cell in
line, thus allowing the infection process to continue
into successive cells in the cortex. As the infection
thread moves through the root hair into the cortex,
the bacteria continue to multiply. When the thread
reaches the developing nodule, it branches so that many
individual cells in the young nodule become infected
(Figure 11.3C).
11.3.1.3 Finally bacteria are released.
The ﬁnal
step in the infection process occurs when the bacteria are
‘‘released’’ into the host cells. Actually the membrane
of the infection thread buds off to form small vesicles,
each containing one or more individual bacteria. Shortly
after release, the bacteria cease dividing, enlarge, and
differentiate into specialized nitrogen-ﬁxing cells called
bacteroids. The bacteroids remain surrounded by a
membrane, now called the peribacteroid membrane.
Differentiation into a bacteroid is marked by a number
of metabolic changes, including the synthesis of the
enzymes and other factors that the organism requires
for the principal task of nitrogen ﬁxation.
The infection process continues throughout the life
of the nodule. As the nodule increases in size due to
the activity of the nodule meristem, bacteria continue
to invade the new cells. Also as the nodule enlarges and
matures, vascular connections are established with the
main vascular system of the root (Figure 11.5). These

vascular connections serve to import photosynthetic
carbon into the nodule and export ﬁxed nitrogen from
the nodule to the plant.
11.4 THE BIOCHEMISTRY
OF NITROGEN FIXATION
Dinitrogen is not easily reduced because the interatomic
nitrogen bond (N ≡N) is very stable. In the industrial
process, reduction of the dinitrogen triple bond with
hydrogen can be achieved only at high temperature and
pressure and at the cost of considerable energy. Biolog-
ical reduction of dinitrogen is equally costly, consuming
a large proportion of the photoassimilate provided by
the host plant.
11.4.1 NITROGEN FIXATION IS
CATALYZED BY THE ENZYME
DINITROGENASE
Only prokaryote cells are able to ﬁx dinitrogen princi-
pally because only they have the gene coding for this
enzyme (see Chapter 8, Box 8.1). The enzyme dini-
trogenase has been puriﬁed from virtually all known
nitrogen-ﬁxing prokaryotes. It is a multimeric protein
complex made up of two proteins of different size
(Figure 11.6). The smaller protein is a dimer consisting
of two identical subunit polypeptides. The molecular
mass of each subunit ranges from 24 to 36 kD, depend-
ing on the bacterial species. It is called the Fe protein
because the dimer contains a single cluster of four iron
atoms bound to four sulphur groups (Fe4S4). The larger
protein in the dinitrogenase complex is called the MoFe
protein. It is a tetramer consisting of two pairs of identi-
cal subunits with a total molecular mass of approximately
220 kD. Each MoFe protein contains two molybdenum
atoms in the form of an iron-molybdenum-sulphur co-
factor. The MoFe protein also contains Fe4S4 clusters,
although the exact number is uncertain. It varies as a
function of the species or its physiological condition.

11.4 The Biochemistry of Nitrogen Fixation
201
The overall reaction for reduction of dinitrogen to
ammonia by dinitrogenase is shown in the following
equation:
8H+ + 8e−+ N2 + 16 ATP →2NH3
+ H2 + 16 ADP + 16Pi
(11.1)
Note that the principal product of biological nitro-
gen ﬁxation is ammonia, but that for every dinitrogen
molecule reduced, one molecule of hydrogen is gen-
erated. We will return to the problem of hydrogen
evolution later. Also note that reduction of dinitrogen
is a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step, the Fe pro-
tein is reduced by a primary electron donor, usually
ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is a small (14 to 24 kD) protein
containing an iron-sulphur group. Electrons are carried
by the iron moiety, which can exist in either the reduced
ferrous (Fe2+) or the oxidized ferric (Fe3+) states. It is
of interest to note that ferredoxin not only participates
in nitrogen ﬁxation, but is an important electron carrier
in photosynthesis as well (see Chapter 7).
In the second step, the reduced Fe protein passes
electrons to the MoFe protein, which catalyzes the
reduction of both dinitrogen gas and hydrogen. The
precise role of ATP in the reaction is not yet clear, but it
is known to react with reduced Fe protein and to cause
a conformational change in this protein that alters its
redox potential. This facilitates the transfer of electrons
between the Fe protein and the MoFe protein.
11.4.2 NITROGEN FIXATION IS
ENERGETICALLY COSTLY
Biological reduction of dinitrogen, as is industrial
nitrogen ﬁxation, is very costly in terms of energy. One
measure of energy cost is the number of ATP required.
At least 16 ATP are required for each molecule of
dinitrogen reduced—two for each electron transferred
(Equation 11.1). By comparison, only 3 ATP are
required to ﬁx a molecule of carbon dioxide in photo-
synthesis (see Chapter 8). The total energy cost of
biological nitrogen ﬁxation, however, must take into
account the requirement for reduced ferredoxin as
well. Were this reducing potential not required for
the reduction of dinitrogen, it could have been made
available for the production of additional ATP or other
uses by the plant. It has been estimated that the reducing
potential used in nitrogen ﬁxation is equivalent to at
least a further 9 ATP, bringing the total investment to
a minimum of 25 ATP for each molecule of dinitro-
gen ﬁxed. A similar calculation for CO2 ﬁxation brings
the total to 9 ATP, about one-third the cost for
nitrogen.
Another and perhaps better way to assess the cost
of nitrogen ﬁxation is by measuring the amount of
carbon utilized in the process. The ultimate source of
energy for symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation is carbohydrate
produced by photosynthesis in the host plant. A por-
tion of that carbohydrate is diverted from the plant
to the bacteroid, where it is metabolized to produce
the required reducing potential and ATP. It has been
calculated that, in soybean, approximately 12 grams of
carbon are required to ﬁx a gram of dinitrogen. It is
clear that nitrogen ﬁxation represents a considerable
drain on the carbon resources of the host plant. A
diagram summarizing the integration of photosynthe-
sis, respiration, and nitrogen ﬁxation is presented in
Figure 11.7.

11.4.3 DINITROGENASE IS SENSITIVE
TO OXYGEN
One of the more critical problems facing nitrogen-ﬁxing
organisms is the sensitivity of dinitrogenase to molecular
oxygen. Both the Fe protein and the MoFe protein are
rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by molecular oxygen.
The half-life, or time to reduce activity by one-half,
of isolated Fe protein in air is 30 to 45 seconds; the
half-life of MoFe protein is 10 minutes. This extreme
sensitivity of dinitrogenase to oxygen raises a problem
for nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms. The large amounts of
energy required (in the form of ATP and reductant) are
produced through a cellular respiratory pathway that
can operate efﬁciently only when molecular oxygen is
present (see Chapter 10). How then does the organism
reconcile the conﬂicting demands of the respiratory
pathway for oxygen and the sensitivity of dinitrogenase
to oxygen?
Several strategies for regulating oxygen level have
developed to resolve this conﬂict. First, many free-living
bacterial nitrogen ﬁxers have retained an anaerobic
lifestyle or, if facultative, ﬁx dinitrogen only under
anaerobic conditions. Production of ATP and reductant
is markedly less efﬁcient under anaerobic conditions,
which may offer a partial explanation for why, in spite
of their numbers, free-living nitrogen ﬁxers contribute
a relatively small proportion of the total nitrogen ﬁxed
biologically.
Second, certain species of nitrogen-ﬁxing cyanobac-
teria have structurally isolated the nitrogen-ﬁxing
apparatus (Figure 11.8). The nitrogen-ﬁxing cells of the
cyanobacteria are specialized cells called heterocysts.
Heterocysts have thickened, multilayered cell walls
that restrict the diffusion of oxygen. They are also
characterized by a high respiratory activity that main-
tains a low intracellular oxygen concentration. Thus,
FIGURE 11.8 Light micrograph of the cyanobacterium
Anabaena showing heterocysts. Nitrogen ﬁxation is car-
ried out in the enlarged cells or heterocysts, whose
structure and metabolism limits the concentration of
free oxygen. (Copyright E. Reschke. Peter Arnold, Inc.
Reprinted by permission.)
respiration has a dual role: it provides the necessary
ATP needed for nitrogen ﬁxation and it ensures
that oxygen concentrations remain low in the cyto-
plasm where dinitrogenase is localized. Furthermore,
although heterocysts are photosynthetic cells, they lack
photosystem II and thus do not evolve oxygen. They
also do not contain Rubisco and therefore cannot ﬁx
CO2. However, heterocysts have retained photosystem I
and thus have retained the capacity to synthesize ATP
through cyclic photophosphorylation (see Chapter 7).
Third, the oxygen supply is regulated to a large
extent by an oxygen-binding protein called leghemo-
globin in legume nodules. Leghemoglobin is synthe-
sized by the host plant and is located within the
bacteroid-infected host cell. Leghemoglobin may com-
prise as much as 30 percent of the host cell protein
and gives the nodule a distinctive pink color when a cut
surface is exposed to air. Leghemoglobin is similar in
structure to the hemoglobin of mammalian blood. Its
function is also similar, since it apparently binds oxy-
gen and controls the release of oxygen in the region of
the bacteroid. The equilibrium concentration of oxy-
gen in the bacteroid zone is thus kept at a level (about
10 nM) sufﬁcient to support bacteroid respiration—and
the production of ATP and reducing potential—while
at the same time preventing excess oxygen from inac-
tivating dinitrogenase. Oxygen levels must be carefully
balanced, because too low an oxygen concentration can
also limit dinitrogenase activity in nodules. This could
be a result of limiting ATP availability.
11.4.4 DINITROGENASE RESULTS
IN THE PRODUCTION
OF HYDROGEN GAS
A ﬁnal problem facing nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms is
the evolution of hydrogen. Although the mechanism
is not well understood, it appears that hydrogen pro-
duction by dinitrogenase is an inescapable byproduct
of the nitrogen-ﬁxation reaction. As noted earlier in
equation 11.1, at least one molecule of hydrogen (H2)
is evolved for every molecule of N2 reduced. This is
actually a minimum value. When dinitrogenase is not
operating optimally, as might be the case when the sup-
ply of reductant to dinitrogenase is suboptimal, even
more electrons may be diverted to the production of
hydrogen. As much as 25 to 30 percent of the ATP and
electrons supplied to dinitrogenase may be consumed
by hydrogen production. In 1980, it was estimated that
more than one million tons of hydrogen were released
to the atmosphere annually from nitrogen-ﬁxing root
nodules.
Needless to say, H2 production along with nitrogen
ﬁxation is wasteful, consuming energy that might other-
wise be used to reduce dinitrogen. However, although all
nitrogen ﬁxers produce hydrogen, not all release hydrogen

11.5 The Genetics of Nitrogen Fixation
203
into the atmosphere. Many nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms
contain an oxygen-dependent enzyme, called uptake
hydrogenase, which recovers some of the energy lost
to hydrogen production. This is accomplished by cou-
pling H2 oxidation to ATP production. The electrons
are returned to the reductant pool for dinitrogenase.
Understandably, considerable interest has focused
on the biochemistry and physiology of hydrogenase
action and the expression of its genes (known as hup
genes). Using biotechnology to increase the number of
rhizobia strains with the capacity to recycle hydrogen
has the potential to increase the overall energy efﬁciency
of biological nitrogen ﬁxation in important agricultural
crops.
11.5 THE GENETICS OF
NITROGEN FIXATION
It should be evident from the discussion up to this
point that nitrogen ﬁxation involves very complex rela-
tionships between organisms and their environment or
between rhizobia and host in the case of symbiotic
ﬁxation. The switch to nitrogen-ﬁxing metabolism in
anaerobic environments or infection and subsequent
nodule development in symbiotic relationships requires
major changes in the genetic programs of the organisms
involved. The genetics of infection, nodulation, and the
nitrogen-ﬁxing machinery is currently one of the more
exciting and rapidly advancing areas in the study of
nitrogen ﬁxation.
11.5.1 NIF GENES CODE
FOR DINITROGENASE
In free-living nitrogen ﬁxers, the principal requirement
is for the synthesis of the enzyme dinitrogenase. Dini-
trogenase synthesis is directed by a set of genes known
as nif genes. Best characterized is Klebsiella pneumonieae,
where at least 17 nif genes have been described. The nif
genes include structural genes that encode for dinitro-
genase protein as well as a number of regulatory genes.
Two genes, the nif D and nif K genes, for example,
encode the two different subunits of the MoFe protein.
The Fe protein and ferredoxin are encoded by nif H
and nif F, respectively. Other nif genes are involved in
insertion of the FeMo cofactor and the activation and
processing of the enzyme complex.
11.5.2 NOD GENES AND NIF GENES
REGULATE NODULATION
At least three different sets of genes, including nif genes,
are involved in the symbiotic process. In the early stages
of nodulation, prior to infection of the root, a set of
rhizobial nod genes is switched on by ﬂavonoids in the
host root exudate. The nod genes are located in a large
circular piece of rhizobial DNA (or plasmid) known
as the Sym (for symbiosis) plasmid. Three nod genes
(nodA, nodB, nodC) are basic nodulation genes common
to most rhizobia. They code for the chitooligosaccha-
ride core of the nod factors. However, recently, gene
sequencing of two photosynthetic strains of Bradyrhizo-
bia, named BTAi1 and ORS278, indicate that neither of
these strains contain the expected nod genes. Although
these unique strains are capable of inducing stem nodules
in their hosts, Aeschynomene sensitiva and Aeschynomene
indica, purine derivatives appear to trigger this nodule
formation.
The role of the nodD gene appears to be pivotal.
Its expression is differentially affected by root exudates
and its product in turn activates transcription of both
the nodABC group and a series of host-speciﬁc genes
(nodEFGH). These host-speciﬁc genes code for modi-
ﬁcations to the nod factors that are important in deter-
mining host speciﬁcity. The pivotal role of nodD has
been demonstrated by transferring the nodD gene from a
strain of Rhizobium that infects Parasponia to a strain that
normally infects only clover. The clover strain was then
able to nodulate Parasponia. One of the ﬁrst responses
of root epidermis cells to the presence of nod-factors is
the rapid efﬂux of Ca2+ which occurs within seconds of
exposure to nod-factors. Recently, it has been reported
that this Ca2+ efﬂux is associated with the activation
of trimeric G-proteins. Thus, the Rhizobium nod-factor
signal transduction pathway appears to be mediated by
plasma membrane G-proteins coupled to the activation
of intracellular Ca2+ second messenger pathways.
During the latter stages of nodule development,
rhizobial nif and ﬁx genes are switched on. The dis-
crimination between nif and ﬁx genes is not always
clear, except that, as in the free-living forms, nif genes
are involved in the synthesis and regulation of dinitro-
genase. The ﬁx genes are restricted to symbiotic nitro-
gen ﬁxers. At least one (ﬁxX) encodes a ferredoxin and
others may be involved in the transport of electrons to
dinitrogenase.
Development of an active nodule requires a number
of nodule-speciﬁc proteins contributed by the host cells.
These proteins, called nodulins, are encoded by nod
genes located in the host cell genome. Early nodulins are
expressed during the infection process and nodule devel-
opment. Although several have been identiﬁed, their role
is not clear. Early nodulins appear to be involved with
the infection thread plasma membrane and in the forma-
tion of the nodule primordia. The expression of late
nodulin genes coincides more or less with the onset of
nitrogen ﬁxation and appears to be involved in nodule
function and maintenance. Leghemoglobin is the most
abundant late nodulin. Other late nodulins include
enzymes such as uricase and glutamine synthetase
involved in the metabolic processing of ﬁxed nitrogen.

Chapter 11 / Nitrogen Assimilation
11.5.3 WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF HEME
FOR LEGHEMOGLOBIN?
Early experiments with a mutant of Rhizobium melilotii
indicated that the heme was supplied by the bacteroid.
The mutant, unable to synthesize the heme precursor
δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), produced white nodules
that were unable to ﬁx dinitrogen. These results suggest
the host plant is unable to provide sufﬁcient heme to
build adequate levels of leghemoglobin. However, in
later experiments with soybean, plants infected with
Bradyrhizobium japonicum carrying the same mutation
produced fully competent nodules. Thus, the source
of the heme component of leghemoglobin is not yet
clear.
Symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation clearly requires the
coordinated expression of many genes of both the host
and microsymbiont. Understanding how these genes are
regulated and how the complex processes of infection
and nodule development are coordinated constitutes one
of the more challenging problems facing plant physi-
ologists today. Armed with sufﬁcient understanding of
the process and the tools of modern molecular genet-
ics, plant scientists may one day be able to extend the
range of biological nitrogen ﬁxation to other important
crop species—thus extending the beneﬁts of nitrogen
ﬁxation to nitrogen-poor soils and reducing the eco-
nomic and environmental costs of chemical nitrogen
fertilizers.
11.6 NH3 PRODUCED BY
NITROGEN FIXATION IS
CONVERTED TO ORGANIC
NITROGEN
The ﬁrst stable product of nitrogen ﬁxation is ammonia
(NH3), although at physiological pH ammonia is almost
certainly protonated to form ammonium ion:
NH3 + H+ ↔NH+
4
(11.2)
Plants that cannot ﬁx dinitrogen meet their nutritional
needs by taking in nitrogen from the soil. While there
are exceptions, most plants are able to assimilate either
NH+
4 or NO−
3 , depending on their relative availability
in the soil. In most soils, ammonia is rapidly converted
to nitrate by the nitrifying bacteria described earlier
in this chapter. Nitrifying bacteria do not grow well
under anaerobic conditions and consequently ammonia
will accumulate in soils that are poorly drained. Nitri-
ﬁcation itself is also inhibited in strongly acidic soils.
Some members of the family Ericaceae, typically found
on acidic soils, have adapted by preferentially utiliz-
ing ammonium as their nitrogen source. One extreme
example is the cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), native
to swamps and bogs of eastern North America, which
cannot exploit NO−
3 as a nitrogen source and must take
up nitrogen in the form of ammonium ion.
Regardless of the route taken, assimilation of min-
eral (inorganic) nitrogen into organic molecules is a
complex process that can be very energy intensive. It has
been estimated, for example, that assimilation of ammo-
nium nitrogen consumes from 2 to 5 percent of the
plant’s total energy production. Nitrate, on the other
hand, must ﬁrst be reduced to ammonium before it can
be assimilated, at a cost of nearly 15 percent of total
energy production. In this section, we will review the
assimilation ﬁrst of ammonium nitrogen and then of
nitrate nitrogen.
11.6.1 AMMONIUM IS ASSIMILATED
BY GS/GOGAT
Although NH+
4 is readily available to many plants, either
as the product of nitrogen ﬁxation or by uptake from
the soil, it is also quite toxic to plants. In nitrogen-ﬁxing
systems, NH+
4 will inhibit the action of dinitrogenase.
Ammonium also interferes with the energy metabolism
of cells, especially ATP production. Even at low con-
centrations, NH+
4 has the potential to uncouple ATP
formation from electron transport in both mitochondria
and chloroplasts (see Chapters 7 and 10). Consequently,
it appears that plants can ill afford to accumulate excess
free NH+
4 . It is assumed that most plants avoid any
toxicity problem by rapidly incorporating the NH+
4 into
amino acids.
The general pathway for NH+
4
assimilation in
nitrogen-ﬁxing symbionts has been worked out largely
by supplying nodules with labeled dinitrogen (13N2
or 15N2). These studies have indicated that the initial
organic product is the amino acid glutamine. Assim-
ilation of NH+
4 into glutamine by legume nodules is
accomplished by the glutamate synthase cycle, a path-
way involving the sequential action of two enzymes:
glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase
(GOGAT)2 (Figure 11.9). Both GS and GOGAT are
nodulin proteins that are expressed at high levels in the
host cytoplasm of infected cells, outside the peribac-
teroid membrane. The NH+
4 formed in the bacteroid
must therefore diffuse across the peribacteroid mem-
brane before it can be assimilated.
In the ﬁrst reaction of the glutamate synthase
cycle, catalyzed by GS, the addition of an NH+
4
group to glutamate forms the corresponding amide,
glutamine:
glutamate + NH+
4 + ATP →glutamine + ADP + Pi
(11.3)
2The acronym GOGAT refers to glutamine-2-oxoglutarate-
amino-transferase. 2-Oxoglutarate is an alternative name for
α-ketoglutarate.

11.6 NH3 Produced by Nitrogen Fixation Is Converted to Organic Nitrogen
205
Energy to drive the amination of glutamate is provided
by ATP, yet an additional cost of nitrogen ﬁxation.
Glutamine is then converted back to glutamate by
the transfer of the amide group to a molecule of
α-ketoglutarate.
glutamine + α-ketoglutarate + NADH →
2glutamate + NAD+
(11.4)
Reaction 11.4 is catalyzed by GOGAT and requires
reducing potential in the form of NADH. The
α-ketoglutarate is probably derived from photosyn-
thetic carbon through respiration in the host cell.
α-Ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the respiratory
pathway for the oxidation of glucose. Note that reaction
equation 11.4 gives rise to two molecules of glutamate.
Since only one molecule of glutamate is required to
keep the cycle going, the other is available for export
to the host plant (Figure 11.9). Overall, then, carbon
skeletons originating with photosynthesis and nitrogen
ﬁxed by the microsymbiont are combined to form
organic nitrogen that is exported out of the nodule for
use by the host.
There is a possible alternative pathway for nitrogen
assimilation, involving the direct reductive amination
of α-ketoglutarate by the enzyme glutamate dehy-
drogenase (GDH). However, although GDH activity
has been detected in nodules, there is no convincing
evidence that it plays a signiﬁcant role in NH+
4 assimi-
lation under normal circumstances. Both the quantities
and activities of GS and GOGAT are much higher than
GDH. GS alone may account for as much as 2 percent of
the total soluble protein outside the bacteroid. In addi-
tion, GDH has a much lower afﬁnity (see Chapter 8,
Box 8.1) for NH+
4 than does GS and could hardly be
expected to compete with GS for available NH+
4 . The
cost of the glutamate synthase cycle is one ATP for
each NH+
4 assimilated, but the beneﬁt is rapid assim-
ilation. The high afﬁnity of GS for NH+
4 , together
with the high concentration of the enzyme, ensures
that the free NH+
4 concentration is kept below toxic
levels.
Before leaving the glutamate synthase cycle, it
is important to note that GS and GOGAT are not
restricted to nodules. These enzymes are located in the
roots and leaves of non-nitrogen-ﬁxing plants where
they also catalyze the assimilation of NH+
4 nitrogen.
11.6.2 PII PROTEINS REGULATE
GS/GOGAT
As illustrated in Figure 11.9, GS/GOGAT represents
a critical metabolic point of coordination between
nitrogen assimilation (NH+
4 ) and carbon metabolism
(α-ketoglutarate).
Cellular
carbon/nitrogen
status
is sensed by the signal sensing protein, PII. PII
proteins are one of the most ubiquitous and highly
conserved regulatory proteins found in nature. They
are present in the ancient archeabacteria, eubacteria as
well as eukaryotes such as plants. This relatively small
chloroplastic protein of about 14 kDa is nuclear encoded
and senses both the ATP status and α-ketoglutarate
levels by allosteric means (see Chapter 8, Box 8.1).
Cellular nitrogen status is sensed through changes in
glutamine availability which results in post-translational
modiﬁcation of PII by uridylylation (Figure 11.10).
Like the light-regulated enzymes of the Calvin Cycle
(see Chapter 8), GS/GOGAT can exist in either an
active or an inactive state. When glutamine levels
in the GS/GOGAT cycle are low, PII proteins are
uridylylated using uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form
PII-UMP (Figure 11.10). This modiﬁed PII protein
interacts with inactive GS/GOGAT to convert the
latter from the inactive to the active form which
stimulates glutamine synthesis and hence the stimulates
assimilation of NH+
4 . Conversely, when glutamine
levels are high, PII-UMP is converted back to PII
which converts the active GS/GOGAT to the inactive
form which slows the rate of NH+
4 assimilation.

11.6.3 FIXED NITROGEN IS EXPORTED
AS ASPARAGINE AND UREIDES
The ﬁnal step in nitrogen ﬁxation is the export of the
ﬁxed nitrogen from the nodule to other regions of the
host plant. Export of the organic nitrogen products
from nodules is primarily through the xylem. Conse-
quently, the form in which the nitrogen is exported
has been identiﬁed primarily by analysis of xylem sap.

there is no guarantee that all of the nitrogen present
in sap represents current nodule production. Some of
the better analyses have been conducted directly on
detached nodules or by monitoring the ﬂow of organic
nitrogen following ﬁxation of 15N2. These studies have
shown that although glutamine is the principal organic
product of nitrogen ﬁxation, it rarely accounts for a
signiﬁcant fraction of the nitrogen exported, at least in
legumes. In some groups of legumes, largely those of
temperate origins, such as pea and clover, the amino
acid asparagine is the predominant form translocated.
Legumes of tropical origins, for example, soybean and
cowpea, appear to export predominantly derivatives of
urea, known as ureides (Figure 11.11).
The biosynthetic pathway for asparagine in nodules
involves two transamination reactions. A transami-
nation reaction is the transfer of an amino group
from an amino acid to the carboxyl group of a keto
acid. Transamination reactions, catalyzed by a class of
enzymes known as aminotranferases, enable nitrogen
initially ﬁxed in glutamate to be incorporated into other
amino acids and, ultimately, into protein. Aminotrans-
ferases are found throughout the plant—in the cytosol,
in chloroplasts, and in microbodies—wherever pro-
tein synthesis activity is high. The enzymes involved
in asparagine biosynthesis in nodules appear to be sim-
ilar to those found elsewhere in the plant. The ﬁrst
step is the transfer of an amino group from glutamate
to oxaloacetate, catalyzed by the enzyme aspartate
aminotransferase.
glutamate + oxaloacetate
→α-ketoglutarate + aspartate
(11.5)

11.7 Plants Generally Take Up Nitrogen in the Form of Nitrate
207
The glutamate used in this reaction is derived from
the GS-GOGAT reactions in the nodule. In order to
continue the synthesis and export of asparagine, the
nodule requires a continued supply of the 4-carbon acid
oxaloacetate. This could be provided through the oxi-
dation of carbon in the nodule; oxaloacetate is another
intermediate in the respiratory oxidation of glucose.
However, nodules from a number of species exhibit
high activities of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate car-
boxylase (PEP carboxylase). PEP carboxylase catalyzes
the addition of a carbon dioxide (a carboxylation reac-
tion) to the 3-carbon phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to
form oxaloacetate (OAA) (Equation 11.6). PEP car-
boxylase is involved in a number of important metabolic
pathways in plants and animals, including respiration
and photosynthesis.
PEP + CO2 →OAA
(11.6)
In the second step of asparagine biosynthesis,
the amide nitrogen is transferred from glutamine to
aspartate.
glutamine + aspartate + ATP
→glutamate + asparagine + ADP + Pi
(11.7)
The enzyme for this reaction is asparagine synthetase
and the reaction is driven by the energy of one molecule
of ATP for each asparagine synthesized.
The synthesis of ureides is more complex, both
biochemically and with respect to the division of labor
between the microsymbiont and tissues of the host
plant. Allantoin and allantoic acid (Figure 11.11)
are formed by the oxidation of purine nucleotides,
which apparently requires an active symbiosis. Urei-
des apparently serve speciﬁcally for the transport of
nitrogen. They are translocated through the xylem
to other regions of the plant, where they are rapidly
metabolized. In the process, NH+
4 is released, which is
then reassimilated via GS and GOGAT in the target
tissue.
Although the synthesis of asparagine, and especially
the ureides, both appear to be complex processes, there
are some advantages relating to the energy costs and
efﬁciencies of nitrogen export. It has been estimated
that the carbon metabolism associated with nitrogen
export may consume as much as 20 percent of the photo-
synthate diverted to nitrogen ﬁxation. One way to judge
efﬁciency is to consider the amount of carbon required
for each nitrogen exported. The ureides, with a carbon
to nitrogen ratio of 1 (C:N
1), are the most economic
in the use of carbon. Both asparagine and citrulline
(C:N
2) require more carbon in their transport and
glutamine (C:N
2.5) would be the least economic.
The energy costs of ureides, asparagine, and citrulline,
in terms of ATP consumed, are about the same, so the
principal advantage to be gained by the ureide-formers
appears to be a favorable carbon economy.
11.7 PLANTS GENERALLY TAKE
UP NITROGEN IN THE
FORM OF NITRATE
Except in extreme situations noted earlier, nitrate
(NO−
3 ) is the more abundant form of nitrogen in
soils and is most available to plants that do not
form nitrogen-ﬁxing associations. However, in spite
of numerous studies describing the physiology of
NO−
3 uptake, there is a great amount of uncertainty
surrounding the mechanism of NO−
3 transport into
roots. It has been shown in various studies that uptake
of NO−
3 is sensitive to (1) low temperature, (2) inhibi-
tors of both respiration and protein synthesis, and
(3) anaerobic conditions. All of these results support
the hypothesis that NO−
3 transport across the root cell
membrane is an energy-dependent process mediated by
a carrier protein (see Chapter 3).
In root cells that have never been exposed to nitrate,
there appears to be a limited capacity for NO−
3 uptake.
This suggests a small amount of carrier is present in the
membrane at all times (that is, a constitutive protein).
On exposure to external nitrate, the rate of uptake
increases from two- to ﬁvefold, but addition of inhibitors
of protein synthesis causes the rate to fall rapidly back
to the constitutive level. This pronounced sensitivity of
NO−
3 uptake to inhibitors of protein synthesis suggests
that the bulk of the carrier protein is inducible, that is,
the presence of NO−
3 in the soil stimulates the synthesis
of new carrier protein. Once inside the root, NO−
3 may
be stored in the vacuole, assimilated in the root cells, or
translocated in the xylem to the leaves for assimilation.
Nitrate cannot be assimilated directly but must ﬁrst
be reduced to NH+
4 in order to be assimilated into
organic compounds. This is a two-step process, the ﬁrst
being the reduction of NO−
3 to nitrite (NO−
2 ) by the
enzyme nitrate reductase (NR).
2H+ + NO−
3 + 2e−→NO−
2 + H2O
(11.8)
NR is generally assumed to be a cytosolic enzyme.
The product NO−
2 then moves into plastids (in roots)
or chloroplasts (in leaves) where it is quickly reduced
to NH+
4 by the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR). In
leaves, the electrons required for the reduction of NO−
2
to NH+
4 are generated
8H+ + NO−
2 + 6e−→NH+
4 + 2H2O
(11.9)
by photosynthetic electron transport. Thus, the assimi-
lation of NO−
3 competes with the assimilation of CO2
(Chapter 8) for photosynthetic electrons. As a con-
sequence, NO−
3
assimilation in leaves can also be
considered a photosynthetic process similar to CO2
assimilation. The interactions between carbon and
nitrogen
metabolism
indicate
the
importance
of
photosynthetic electron transport in overall primary
reductive metabolism.

208
Chapter 11 / Nitrogen Assimilation
Nitrite is toxic and is rarely found at high concen-
trations in plants. This is no doubt because the activity
of NiR (per gram dry weight of tissue) is normally sev-
eral times higher than the activity of NR. The resulting
ammonia is then rapidly assimilated into organic com-
pounds via the GS/GOGAT system already described.
In non-nitrogen-ﬁxing systems, both GS and GOGAT
are commonly found in root and leaf cells. GS is found
in the cytosol of root cells and in both the cytosol and
chloroplasts of leaf cells. GOGAT is a plastid enzyme,
localized in the chloroplasts of leaves and in plastids
in roots. Depending on its location, GOGAT may use
ferredoxin, NADH, or NADPH as electron donors.
Nitrate reductase is a ubiquitous enzyme found in
both prokaryote and eukaryote cells. In prokaryotes,
the principal electron donor is ferredoxin, while in
higher plants electrons are donated by the reduced
forms of one of the pyrimidine nucleotides, nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) (Chapter 7). The en-
zyme isolated from a variety of higher plants is composed
oftwoidenticalsubunitswithamolecularmassofapprox-
imately 115 kD. A key constituentofNR ismolybdenum;
NR is the principal Mo-protein in non-nitrogen-ﬁxing
plants. One of the results of Mo deﬁciency is markedly
reduced levels of nitrate reductase activity and conse-
quent nitrogen starvation (see Chapter 4).
NR is a highly regulated, inducible enzyme. It has
long been recognized that both substrate (NO−
3 ) and
light are required for maximum activity and that induc-
tion involves an increase in the level of NR messenger
RNA followed by de novo synthesis of NR protein.
Treatment of cereal seedlings such as barley (Hordeum
vulgare) or maize (Zea mays) with nitrate in the dark
induces relatively low levels of NR activity, but activ-
ity is strongly promoted if seedlings are also exposed
to light. Induction by light is eliminated by various
treatments that interfere with chloroplast development
or photosynthetic energy transformations, implying a
requirement for photosynthetic energy. NR activity can
also be reversibly regulated by red and far-red light, indi-
cating control by the phytochrome system (Chapter 22).
More recent work has established that NR activity is
also subject to post-translational regulation by a speciﬁc
NR protein kinase. Protein kinases, ﬁrst characterized
by Edwin Krebs and Edmund Fischer in the 1950s, are
a ubiquitous class of enzymes that phosphorylate other
proteins by transferring a phosphate group from adeno-
sine triphosphate (ATP). The phosphate group can then
be removed by a second enzyme called protein phos-
phatase. It is increasingly evident that, by switching
enzymes and other proteins on and off, reversible pro-
tein phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating
metabolism. The fundamental role of protein kinases
was recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize to
Krebs and Fischer in 1992.
In the case of NR, the enzyme appears to be active in
both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated states.
When NR is phosphorylated and the leaf is transferred
from the light to dark, however, the enzyme is rapidly
inactivated by binding with a small inhibitor protein. NR
activity is slowly restored on return to light by a release of
the inhibitor protein and subsequent phosphatase action.
The question of why there exists such a complex system
for regulation of NR activity has yet to be answered.
The overall effect, however, is to coordinate nitrate
reduction with photosynthetic activity. It ensures that
nitrate reduction is engaged only after photosynthesis is
fully active and able to provide both the energy required
and the carbon skeletons necessary for incorporation of
ammonia.
As indicated earlier, nitrate assimilation can be car-
ried out in either the root or shoot tissues in most plants.
Several studies have shown that the proportion of NO−
3
reduced in the root or shoot depends to a large extent
on the external NO−
3 concentration. At low concentra-
tions, most of the NO−
3 can be reduced within the root
tissues and translocated to the shoot as amino acids or
amides. At higher concentrations of NO−
3 , assimilation
in the roots becomes limiting and a higher proportion
of the NO−
3 ﬁnds its way into the translocation stream.
Thus, at higher concentrations, a higher proportion of
the nitrogen is assimilated in the leaves.
Not all plants have the same capacity to metabolize
NO−
3 in their roots. In the extreme, NO−
3 is virtually
the sole nitrogen source in the xylem sap of cocklebur
(Xanthium strumarium). This is because cocklebur has
no detectable NR in its roots. On the other hand,
plants such as barley (Hordeum vulgare) and sunﬂower
(Helianthus annus) translocate roughly equal proportions
of NO−
3 and amino acid/amide nitrogen, and radish
(Raphanus sativus) translocates only about 15 percent of
its nitrogen as NO−
3 .
11.8 NITROGEN CYCLING:
SIMULTANEOUS IMPORT
AND EXPORT
Nitrogen uptake by most plants is highest during its early
rapid-growth phase and declines as reproductive growth
begins and the plant ages. Cereals, for example, take up
as much as 90 percent of their total nitrogen requirement
before the onset of reproductive growth. Most of this
nitrogen is directed toward young, expanding leaves,
which reach their maximum nitrogen content just prior
to full expansion. The leaf then begins to export nitrogen.
Several studies have shown that mature leaves continue
to import nitrogen, even though they have become net
nitrogen exporters and the total nitrogen content of the
leaf is in decline. This simultaneous import and export
of nitrogen is known as nitrogen cycling.

11.9 Agricultural and Ecosystem Productivity Is Dependent on Nitrogen Supply
209
The export of nitrogen from leaves becomes par-
ticularly signiﬁcant as the seed begins to develop. The
nitrogen requirement of developing seeds is sufﬁciently
great that it cannot be met by uptake from the soil (in
the case of cereals, for example) or by nitrogen ﬁxed
in nodules. The additional nitrogen must come from
vegetative parts, principally leaves (Figure 11.12). This
may have signiﬁcant implications for the photosynthetic
capacity of leaves. The major leaf protein is Rubisco,
the enzyme that catalyzes photosynthetic incorporation
of carbon dioxide (see Chapter 8). Rubisco may
comprise from 40 to 80 percent of the total soluble
protein in leaves of soybean and cereal grains. Perhaps
because of its abundance, Rubisco also functions as a
storage protein; it may be degraded when nitrogen
is required elsewhere in the plant, such as developing
seeds. With the loss of Rubisco there is a concomitant
decline in photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation. In the case
of soybean and other symbiotic legumes, this means
less energy available to the nodule to support nitrogen
ﬁxation. This competition between nitrogen and carbon
supply may be a major factor limiting seed development
in legumes. In the case of cereals or plants growing in

nitrogen-poor soils, mobilization of accumulated nitro-
gen from the leaves represents the principal source of
nitrogen for developing fruits and seeds. In perennial
plants, nitrogen from senescing leaves is mobilized and
translocated to the roots for storage over the winter. In
this way, the nitrogen is conserved and made available to
support the ﬁrst ﬂush of renewed growth the following
spring.
11.9 AGRICULTURAL
AND ECOSYSTEM
PRODUCTIVITY IS
DEPENDENT ON
NITROGEN SUPPLY
In terms of quantity, nitrogen is the fourth most abun-
dant element in plants and is the most abundant mineral
element (see Chapter 4). On a dry-weight basis, herba-
ceous plant material typically contains between 1 and 4
percent nitrogen, mostly in the form of protein. At the
same time, the availability of nitrogen in the soil may
be limited by a number of environmental factors, such
as temperature, oxygen, water status, and pH, which
inﬂuence the activity of microorganisms responsible
for nitrogen ﬁxation, nitriﬁcation, and ammoniﬁcation.
Moreover, a substantial quantity of nitrogen is removed
each year with the harvested crop. It is not too sur-
prising, then, that crop growth is most often limited by
nitrogen supply.
In agricultural situations, the application of nitrogen
fertilizers overcomes environmentally imposed nitrogen
limitation. Most crops respond to applied nitrogen with
increases in yield (Figure 11.13). At sufﬁciently high
application rates, factors other than nitrogen become
limiting and there is no further gain. At even higher
application rates, yield may decline slightly, but this is
probably due to excess salt in the soil rather than some
form of nitrogen toxicity. Data such as those shown
in Figure 11.13 are of considerable practical value to
farmers, who want to maximize the ratio of yield to input
costs. Throughout North America, corn is the leading
consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and farmers typically
apply 100 to 150 kg N ha−1 each growing season. During
its early rapid growth phase, a well-irrigated stand of
corn will take up as much as 4 kg of nitrogen ha−1 day−1.
The use of such large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers is
also costly in terms of energy. It has been estimated, for
example, that fully one-third of the energy cost of a corn
crop is accounted for by the production and distribution
of nitrogen fertilizers.
Without continued application of fertilizers, yields
of nonleguminous crops traditionally decline over a
period of years. In a few situations where records have
been kept, yields on plots from which nitrogen fer-
tilizers have been withheld will eventually stabilize at

a lower level that can be sustained indeﬁnitely. Sus-
tained low yields are possible because the extraction of
nitrogen (and other nutrients) from the soil is balanced
against replenishment from all sources, including rain-
fall, irrigation water, dust, and weathering of parent
rock.
The role of nitrogen in natural ecosystems is much
more difﬁcult to deﬁne, in part because the level of inputs
is very low relative to the total nitrogen pool and much of
the nitrogen is recycled. Still, it is generally agreed that
nitrogen is limiting in most natural ecosystems just as
it is in agriculture. In forest ecosystems, approximately
two-thirds of the annual nitrogen input is contributed
by nitrogen ﬁxation, while the other third is believed to
be derived primarily from atmospheric sources: either
through rainfall or dry deposition of nitrogen oxides. A
recent study has shown that, on average, close to half of
the incoming ﬁxed nitrogen is retained in the canopy.
This should not be surprising since the photosynthetic
apparatus present in the leaves of the canopy contains
the bulk of the assimilated organic nitrogen in form
of proteins such as Rubisco (see Chapter 8), the most
abundant protein in nature, the major light harvesting
polypeptides present in thylakoid membranes, and of
course, the pigments, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b,
which are also rich in nitrogen (see Chapter 4). This
implies that foliar absorption of nitrogen could play
a signiﬁcant role in nitrogen uptake by forest species.
This seems particularly true of trees growing at high
elevations, which are frequently bathed in cloud cover,
or trees that grow near urban industrialized areas.
Except in mature, slowly growing forests, most of
the nitrogen is taken up and either retained in the
canopy or held in long-term storage in the litter on
the forest ﬂoor where it is slowly recycled. The nitro-
gen content of the litter is slowly leached into the soil
by rain and surface water or is broken down into simpler
compounds by a variety of soil bacteria, fungi, earth-
worms, and other decomposing organisms. The ﬁnal
step in the breakdown is mineralization, or the for-
mation of inorganic nitrogen from organic nitrogen.
Mineralization is largely due to the process of ammoni-
ﬁcation described earlier. Mineralization is invariably
accompanied by immobilization, or the retention and
use of nitrogen by the decomposing organisms. Avail-
ability of litter nitrogen to plants depends above all on
net mineralization, or the extent to which mineraliza-
tion exceeds immobilization.
The balance between mineralization and immobi-
lization and oxidation of the mineralized NH+
4 -nitrogen
by nitrifying bacteria is regulated by environmental
parameters. Principal among these are temperature, pH,
soil moisture, and oxygen supply. The optimum tem-
perature for nitriﬁcation generally falls between 25◦C
and 35◦C, although climatic adaptations of indigenous
nitrifying bacteria to more extreme temperatures have
been demonstrated. In one study, for example, the opti-
mum temperature for nitriﬁcation in soils of northern
Australia was 35◦C, in Iowa (U.S.) it was 30◦C, and
in Alberta (Canada), 20◦C. As noted earlier, soil pH
is a major limiting factor in the growth of nitrifying
bacteria. The growth of Nitrobacter is probably inhib-
ited by ammonium toxicity at high pH (7.5 and above),
while aluminum toxicity is suspected as the cause of lim-
ited nitriﬁcation in acid soils. Soil moisture and oxygen
supply go hand-in-hand—little nitriﬁcation occurs in
water-saturated soils because of the limited O2 supply.
At the other extreme, the rate of nitriﬁcation declines
with decreasing soil water potential (/soil) below about
−0.03 to −0.04 MPa.
The relative signiﬁcance of nitriﬁcation in the nitro-
gen cycle of natural ecosystems is not altogether clear.
Most studies indicate a relatively minor role, since little
if any surplus NO−
3 is found in the soil or streams of
most undisturbed ecosystems. Experimental deforesta-
tion, however, leads to a rapid rise (as much as 50-fold)
in the levels of NO−
3 in stream water. NO−
3 levels grad-
ually returned to normal only as the vegetation began
to regrow. These results suggest that nitriﬁcation is a
signiﬁcant source of nitrogen, but rapid uptake of NO−
3
by plants is an important factor in maintaining low levels
of NO−
3 in the soil solution.
Trees and other plants also tend to conserve a
large proportion of their nitrogen, withdrawing nitrogen

from the leaves and ﬂowers before they are shed and
placing it in storage in the roots and stem tissues.
Between one-third and two-thirds of a plant’s nitrogen
may be conserved by such internal cycling. In the case of
deciduous trees, for example, this stored nitrogen offers
a degree of nutritional independence from the often
nitrogen-poor soil during the ﬂush of growth in early
spring.
SUMMARY
Nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient for plants,
even though molecular nitrogen is readily available
in the atmosphere. Plants do not have the gene
coding for dinitrogenase but must depend instead on
the nitrogen-ﬁxing activities of certain prokaryote
organisms to produce nitrogen in a combined form.
Nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms may be free-living or
form symbiotic associations with plants. Symbiotic
nitrogen ﬁxation involves complex genetic and bio-
chemical interactions between host plant roots and
bacteria. The invading rhizobia induce the formation
of root nodules, where the protein leghemoglobin
helps to ensure a low-oxygen environment in which
the enzyme dinitrogenase can function. The host plant
provides energy in the form of photosynthate and, in
turn, receives a supply of combined nitrogen for its
own growth and development.
The product of nitrogen ﬁxation is ammonium,
which is rapidly incorporated into amino acids through
GS/GOGAT before it is exported from the nodule.
PII proteins sense cellular carbon/nitrogen balance
and regulate GS/GOGAT activity. Plants that do not
form nitrogen-ﬁxing associations generally take up
nitrogen in the form of nitrate. Nitrate must ﬁrst be
reduced to ammonium before it can be incorporated
into organic molecules. In leaves, this reducing power is
generated by photosynthetic electron transport. Conse-
quently, the reduction of nitrate to NH+
4 in leaves can
be considered photosynthetic since it competes with
the reduction of CO2 for photosynthetically generated
electrons.

Carbon and Nitrogen Assimilation
and Plant Productivity
In an earlier chapter, the theme was introduced that
photosynthesis is the fundamental basis of competitive
success in green plants (Chapters 7 and 8). The sig-
niﬁcance of carbon assimilation, however, extends well
beyond the performance of green plants. Carbon assimi-
lation creates plant biomass, or dry matter, which in turn
supports humans and virtually all other heterotrophic
organisms in the biosphere. Since the beginnings of the
industrial revolution, growth of the human population
and industries has been putting increasing pressures on
the biosphere. These pressures have in turn stimulated
interest in studies of plant productivity, which is directly
related to carbon gain through photosynthesis. Produc-
tivity and its relationship to yield is of obvious concern
to agriculture, but it also has relevance in broader
ecological terms because it provides the energetic
and material basis for other organisms. Knowledge of
plant productivity provides a basis level for ecosystem
research, helping to elucidate problems of energy and
nutrient ﬂow and their relationships to the structures
of communities. Plant productivity also carries implica-
tions for the upper limit of the earth’s sustainable human
population. Knowing how plants function in a natural
environment, their potential for harvest, and how they
might respond to potentially stressful environmental
change is essential to learning how to manage world
resources in a time of burgeoning world population.
The physiology of photosynthesis—light capture,
energy conversion, and partitioning of carbon—are at
the root of productivity. This chapter will address
•
the concepts of carbon gain and productivity,
•
the interactions between respiration, photosynthesis
and nitrogen assimilation and how these relation-
ships determine the overall carbon gain of a plant,
•
environmental factors such as light, available car-
bon dioxide, temperature, availability of soil water
and nutrients, which inﬂuence photosynthesis and
productivity, and various aspects of leaf and canopy
structure and their impact on productivity.
The chapter will ﬁnish with a brief discussion of
primary productivity on a global scale.

AN INCREASE IN BIOMASS

213

Chapter 12 / Carbon and Nitrogen Assimilation and Plant Productivity
consists of carbon. The basic input into the biosphere
is the conversion of solar energy into organic matter
by photosynthetic plants and microorganisms, known as
primary productivity (PP). Total carbon assimilation is
known as gross primary productivity (GPP). Not all
of the GPP is available for increased biomass, however,
since there is a respiratory cost that must be taken
into account. The principal focus of most productivity
studies is therefore net primary productivity (NPP).
NPP is determined by correcting GPP for energy and
carbon loss due to respiration. NPP is a measure of
the net increase in carbon, or carbon gain, and reﬂects
the additional biomass that is available for harvest by
animals.
12.2 CARBON ECONOMY IS
DEPENDENT ON THE
BALANCE BETWEEN
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
AND RESPIRATION
Because photosynthesis occupies such a prominent posi-
tion in the metabolism of higher plants, its rate is often
regarded as the primary factor regulating biomass pro-
duction and crop productivity. Yet it has often been
observed that plants with similar photosynthetic rates
may differ markedly with respect to growth rate and
biomass accumulation. Clearly, other factors such as par-
titioning and allocation of carbon, translocation rates,
and respiration rates must be considered when attempt-
ing to understand the overall carbon budget or carbon
economy of a plant. Carbon economy is the term used to
describe the balance between carbon acquisition and its
utilization. Respiration is the principal counterbalance
to photosynthesis. Respiration consumes assimilated
carbon in order to obtain the energy required to increase
and maintain biomass. Respiratory loss of carbon con-
stitutes one of the most signiﬁcant intrinsic limitations
on plant productivity.
In an effort to better understand the impact of
respiration on the carbon economy of plants, some
physiologists have sought to distinguish experimen-
tally between the carbon and energy costs of growth on
the one hand and maintenance on the other. The term
growth respiration has been coined to account for the
carbon cost of growth. Growth respiration includes the
carbon actually incorporated plus the carbon respired to
produce the energy (in the form of reducing potential
and ATP) required for biosynthesis and growth. Main-
tenance respiration, on the other hand, provides the
energy for processes that do not result in a net increase
in dry matter, such as turnover of organic molecules,
maintenance of membrane structure, turgor, and solute
exchange. These distinctions are not easily made, but

may be estimated by relating respiration rate to the rela-
tive growth rate (Figure 12.1). When respiration rate is
extrapolated back to zero growth, it can be assumed that
the residual respiration represents the carbon and energy
requirements for maintenance of the nongrowing cells.
From Figure 12.1 it can be seen that maintenance
respiration relative to total respiration will vary with
the growth rate. The proportion devoted to maintenance
will be least in a young, rapidly growing plant or organ
while it will account for the bulk of respiration in
a nongrowing organ such as a mature leaf. Indeed,
measuring maintenance respiration by one commonly
used experimental approach assumes that the respiration
of a mature leaf is essentially 100 percent maintenance,
although a small (but unknown) amount must be used
for the translocation of solutes into and out of the
leaf. Maintenance respiration also tends to be higher in
roots than in shoots and other above-ground organs.
This may be related to the expenditure of maintenance
energy by roots for ion uptake to satisfy not only their
own needs but the needs of the shoot as well. It may
also reﬂect the observation that the cyanide-resistant
alternative pathway tends to be higher in roots.
Respiration produces the metabolic energy that
is required for various growth processes that increase
biomass and agricultural yield, but it can also consume
carbon with little or no apparent yield of useful energy.
Since the latter situation represents a loss of carbon to
the plant, it has been assumed that lower respiration
rates would establish a more positive carbon economy
that might, in turn, result in more rapid growth and
increased productivity. Is it possible to manipulate respi-
ration rates in favor of higher productivity? In a series of
studies, genotypes of perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne)
were selected for respiratory rates ranging from ‘‘slow’’
(2.0 mg CO2 g−1 h−1) to ‘‘rapid’’ (3.5 mg CO2 g−1 h−1).

rye grass (Lolium perenne). (From Wilson, D. Annals of
Botany (London) 49:303–312, 1982. With permission of

Selection was based on the speciﬁc respiration rate of
mature leaves at 25◦C (i.e., maintenance respiration).
The results (Figure 12.2) establish a negative correla-
tion between respiration and growth rate; that is, the
highest growth rates were recorded for genotypes hav-
ing the lowest rates of respiration. It was concluded that
the higher growth rates resulted from a more efﬁcient
use of carbon as a consequence of reduced respira-
tory evolution of CO2 from fully grown tissues. In other
words, with less of the carbon consumed in maintenance
respiration, a higher proportion of the carbon was avail-
able for allocation to growth. Other investigators have
found evidence of similar negative correlations between
respiration and growth with wheat, barley, and oats.
Another method for improving respiratory efﬁci-
ency might be to reduce the contribution, if any,
of
cyanide-resistant
alternative
pathway
activity
(Chapter 10). The alternative pathway oxidizes carbon
with most of the energy released as heat. The overall
impact of the alternative pathway remains to be ﬁrmly
established, but there are some promising indications.
Certain cultivars have been identiﬁed that differ with
respect to the engagement of alternative pathway
respiration at two different CO2 levels. The cultivars
were crossed to produce progeny that either strongly
expressed the alternative pathway or showed no expres-
sion. The accumulation of biomass was greater in the
progeny from which the alternative pathway was absent.
Studies such as these suggest that respiration has a
signiﬁcant impact on biomass accumulation and yield.
They also indicate that improving yield by manipulating
respiration might be feasible. Given that approximately
half of the carbon assimilated in photosynthesis is even-
tually lost by respiration, reducing either the level of
maintenance respiration or the engagement of the alter-
native pathway should shift the carbon balance in favor
of growth respiration and increased biomass production.
It is assumed, of course, that maintenance respiration
and/or the alternative pathway can be reduced without
detrimental effects on the plant, but this remains to be
clearly established. Certainly some level of maintenance
respiration is essential to the health of the plant—this
level is yet to be determined.
One approach to improving the efﬁciency of net
primary production is through breeding and selection
programs. It is quite possible that this has already been
achieved to some extent in existing breeding programs,
without consciously evaluating the role of respiration.
Another approach would be to manipulate respiration
through genetic engineering. However, respiration is
a complex process, both biochemically and physio-
logically. It is central to the metabolism of the cell,
and involves many different enzymes and ultimately
the coordinated activities of cellular organelles plus
the cytosol. It is difﬁcult to know which enzymes
or reactions—that is, which genes—might be prof-
itably manipulated or how an altered respiratory balance
will affect other physiological processes. Although the
prospects for improving productivity by manipulating
respiration are encouraging, there is clearly a great deal
of fundamental research yet to be conducted before
signiﬁcant progress can be expected.
12.3 PRODUCTIVITY IS
INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY
OF ENVIRONMENTAL
FACTORS
The rate of photosynthesis may be limited by a host
of variables. Which of these variables have an inﬂu-
ence and the extent to which the inﬂuence is felt
depend on whether one is concerned with a single
leaf, a whole plant, or a population of plants that form
a canopy. Included in these variables are both envi-
ronmental factors and genetic factors. Environmental
factors include light, availability of CO2, temperature,
soil water, nutrient supply, pathological conditions, and
pollutants. Major factors include leaf age, and morphol-
ogy, leaf area index, leaf angle, and leaf orientation.
The inﬂuence of environmental stress, acclimation and
adaptation on plant productivity will be discussed in
Chapters 13, 14 and 15.
12.3.1 FLUENCE RATE
Typical responses of photosynthesis to ﬂuence rate are
illustrated in Figure 12.3. At very low ﬂuence rates the

rate of CO2 evolution due to dark respiration exceeds
the rate of photosynthetic CO2 uptake. This results in
a negative CO2 uptake, or net CO2 evolution. As ﬂu-
ence rate increases, photosynthesis also increases and so
does CO2 uptake until the rate of CO2 exchange equals
zero. This is the ﬂuence rate, known as the light com-
pensation point, at which the competing processes of
photosynthesis and respiration are balanced. The light
compensation point for most plants falls somewhere in
the range of 10 to 40 μmol m−2 s−1, roughly equiv-
alent to the light level found in a well-lighted ofﬁce,
laboratory, or classroom.
At ﬂuence rates above the compensation point, the
rate of photosynthesis continues to increase until, at
least in C3 plants, it reaches light saturation. In most C3
plants at normal atmospheric CO2 levels, photosynthesis
saturates with light levels of about 500 to 1000 μmol
photons m−2 s−1, that is, about one-quarter to one-half
of full sunlight. Light saturation occurs because some
other factor, usually CO2 levels, becomes limiting. In
most cases, both the saturation rate of photosynthesis
and the ﬂuence rate at which saturation occurs can be
increased by increasing the CO2 level above ambient.
A small number of C3 plants, such as peanut (Arachis
hypogea), do not light saturate. It is not clear why this is
the case, but these are exceptions to the rule. Individual
leaves and plants will also acclimate to the light envi-
ronment in which they are grown. The light-saturated
rate of photosynthesis, for example, is lower in leaves
that have acclimated to growth at low irradiance (shade
leaves) than in those that have acclimated to higher irra-
diance (sun leaves). Acclimation and adaptation to light
environments is discussed in more detail in Chapters 14
and 15.
In a natural environment, even C3 plants rarely
light saturate and then only for relatively brief periods.
Between dawn and dusk, the rate of photosynthesis
gradually increases, reaching a maximum near midday,
and then declines. The photosynthetic rate generally
parallels changes in the irradiance that accompanies
the rising and setting of the sun. Even during midday,
measurable decreases in photosynthetic rate have been
observed with passing cloud cover, suggesting that even
then photosynthesis was barely, if at all, light saturated.
In another study, annual productivity of several species
growing in a European hedgerow was limited to less than
half their potential maximum. The failure of carbon gain
to match leaf photosynthetic capacity was attributed to
reduced average irradiance due to effects of dawn and
dusk, short photoperiods in the spring and fall, and cloud
cover. Long-term carbon gain is clearly dependent on
cumulative irradiance over the growing season.
12.3.2 AVAILABLE CO2
The carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere
is relatively low, at least over the short term, at about
0.035 percent by volume or 350 μl l−1. This is below
the CO2 saturation level for most C3 plants at normal
ﬂuence rates (Figure 12.4), which means that availability
of CO2 is often a limiting factor in photosynthesis. In
C3 plants, increased photosynthetic rates with higher
CO2 levels results from two factors: increased substrate
for the carboxylation reaction and, through competition
with oxygen, reduced photorespiration. Note the inter-
action between ambient CO2 levels and light. At higher
ﬂuence rates, both the maximum rate of photosynthe-
sis and the CO2 saturation level increase. Furthermore,
under high light, C3 plants typically exhibit a lower CO2
compensation point. This represents the CO2 concen-
tration where the rate of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis
equals the rate of CO2 evolution due to respiration.
Assessing the impact of CO2 levels on photosyn-
thesis is not quite as straightforward as it might at ﬁrst

appear. The rate of photosynthesis is actually deter-
mined not by the ambient CO2 concentration, as much
as by the intracellular CO2 concentration, that is,
the supply of CO2 at the carboxylation site in the
chloroplast. It is assumed that the intracellular CO2
concentration is in equilibrium with the intercellular
spaces. Since diffusion rates depend in part on con-
centration gradients, the primary effect of increasing
ambient CO2 levels would be to increase the intercellu-
lar CO2 concentration by increasing the rate of diffusion
into the leaf. Here it is assumed that water supply is ade-
quate and, consequently, stomatal CO2 conductance is
not limiting.

At low CO2 concentrations, photosynthesis is limited
by the carboxylation capacity of the enzyme Rubisco.
At high concentrations of CO2, the rate is limited by
the rate of regeneration of the acceptor molecule,
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Stomata probably operate
to keep the intercellular CO2 concentration within the
transition zone where there is neither an excess of car-
boxylating capacity nor an excess of electron transport.

turn dependent on the electron transport reactions, over
that required to support carboxylation would represent
an inefﬁcient use of resources. Conversely, at high CO2
concentrations or in low light, the limiting factor would
be the energy-limited capacity to regenerate the accep-
tor molecule, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. In this case, an
excess of carboxylating capacity—that is, an excess of
Rubisco—would be an inefﬁcient use of resources.
The most efﬁcient use of resources for the plant
would be to maintain intercellular CO2 levels in the
transition zone, where there is neither an excess of elec-
tron transport capacity nor an excess of carboxylating
capacity. Because intercellular CO2 levels are at least
partly determined by stomatal conductance, it appears
that the principal function of the stomata might be to
regulate CO2 uptake in order to keep intercellular CO2
levels as much as possible within the transition range.
Note that this is not the traditional view of stomatal
function, which says that stomata operate principally to
regulate water loss. Note also that CO2 enrichment at
high ﬂuence rates leads to both higher photosynthetic
maxima and higher CO2 saturation levels (Figure 12.4).
These observations suggest that plants are also able
to compensate for higher light levels by increasing
their carboxylating capacity. Such an increase could be
achieved by regulating the amount of catalytic activities
of photosynthetic enzymes, principally Rubisco.
CO2 limitation is a particular problem in green-
houses, especially in winter when the greenhouses are
closed and CO2 levels are reduced due to photosynthe-
sis. Even under more normal conditions, most plants
will grow signiﬁcantly faster and increase yields when
the atmosphere is enriched with CO2. For these rea-
sons, CO2 enrichment has become common practice for
commercial growers of vegetable crops such as lettuce,
tomato, and cucumbers. In practice, the CO2 content
of the greenhouse atmosphere is increased up to twice
present atmospheric levels. Much beyond 700 μl l−1
there is an increasing risk of stomatal closure as well as
the potential to induce feedback-limited photosynthesis
(Chapter 9) that will cause a reduction in the rate of
photosynthesis. Thus, there is an upper limit to which
CO2 concentrations can be increased with an increase in
plant productivity. This limitation may occur when the
photosynthetic capacity of source leaves far exceeds sink
capacity of the plant (see Chapter 9). CO2 enrichment
might be expected to improve growth and productivity
of ﬁeld crops, but there are obvious technical and eco-
nomic problems related to controlling the supply of gas
in an open environment as well as potential physiologi-
cal problems related to possible feedback inhibition of
photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis is reduced
when the rate of CO2 assimilation exceeds the capacity
for carbon utilization and export. The rate of photo-
synthesis is down-regulated through complex metabolic
feedback loops.

12.3.3 TEMPERATURE
Photosynthesis, like most other biological processes,
is sensitive to temperature. The temperature response
for most biological processes reﬂects the temperature
dependence of the enzymic and other chemical reactions
involved. The temperature response curve can be char-
acterized by three cardinal points: the minimum and
maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax, respectively)
at which the reaction can proceed and the optimum
temperature (Topt) (Figure 12.6). Thus there is a range
of temperatures below the optimum over which the rate
of the reaction or process is stimulated with increasing
temperature, and a range beyond the optimum over
which the rate declines. These points are largely deter-
mined by biochemical factors such as the binding of
substrate with active sites (Chapter 8, Box 8.1) and
protein (enzyme) stability.
The temperature response of chemical and biologi-
cal reactions can generally be characterized by compar-
ing the rate of the reaction at two temperatures 10◦C
apart, a value known as the Q10:
Q10 = RT + 10/RT
(12.1)
The value of Q10 for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is usu-
ally about 2, meaning that the rate of the reaction will
approximately double for each 10◦C rise in temperature.
This value for Q10 applies primarily to stimulation of
the reaction by temperatures between Tmin and Topt.
Once the optimum is reached, the reaction rate may
decline sharply due to enzyme inactivation (Figure 12.6).
Because photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen assim-
ilation are complex, multienzyme processes, it is gen-
erally assumed that temperature responses will tend to
reﬂect the average temperature characteristics for all of
the enzymes. As we will see in Chapter 14, plants can
adjust their Q10 for respiration during acclimation to
temperature.

FIGURE 12.6 Temperature dependence and cardinal
points for a typical biological reaction.
A basic characteristic of photochemical reactions
is that they occur largely independent of temperature
in the biologically relevant range of 0◦–50◦C. Thus,
the Q10 for photochemical reactions is close to 1.0.
Consequently, the short-term temperature response
of photosynthesis largely reﬂects the effect of tem-
perature on the reactions of carbon metabolism and
intersystem electron transport but not the photochem-
ical reactions within the reaction centers of photosys-
tem II and photosystem I. However, prolonged exposure
to high temperature can cause the destabilization of
photosystem II, which may lead to a decreased capa-
city for photosynthetic photochemistry and hence an
inhibition in the rates of photosynthetic electron trans-
port. Photosystem I is generally much more stable to
changes in environmental conditions than is photo-
system II.
Measurement of photosynthetic activity in leaves
and whole plants is normally based on net gas exchange;
that is, it is based on apparent rates of photosynthesis
(AP)—the difference between the actual rate of photo-
synthetic CO2 uptake (gross photosynthesis, GP), CO2
evolution due to respiration (R), and photorespiration
(PR) (Figure 12.7; Equation 12.2).
AP = GP −(R + PR)
(12.2)
Because gross photosynthesis (GP), respiration (R),
and photorespiration (PR) respond very differently to
temperature, the optimum temperature for net photo-
synthesis (AP) is not the same as for gross photosynthesis
(Figure 12.8). Note that the rate of respiration contin-
ues to increase with temperature, reaching a maximum
near 50◦C, where it drops off sharply due to inactivation
of enzymes. The temperature response of the rate of
photorespiration is thought to follow a curve similar to
that shown for respiration.

mum, but declines more rapidly at high temperature.
Net photosynthesis (dashed curve) is determined as the
difference between gross photosynthesis and respiration.
The resulting cardinal points for net photosynthesis are
indicated.
12.3.4 SOIL WATER POTENTIAL
The importance of available water in determining pro-
ductivity cannot be underestimated. The rate of photo-
synthesis declines under conditions of water stress, and
in cases of severe water stress may cease completely.
Stomatal closure and the resultant decrease in CO2 sup-
ply due to water stress imposes a major limitation on
photosynthesis. When this occurs in the presence of
light for prolonged periods of time, this lack of CO2
supply may lead to photoinhibition of photosynthesis
(Chapters 13 and 14). Photorespiration may protect the
photosynthetic apparatus from excess light under such
conditions because the energy absorbed can be used to
ﬁx O2 when the CO2 supply is limiting due to stomatal
closure.
Low water potentials reduce turgor pressure in
leaf cells, which in turn reduces leaf expansion (see
Chapter 17). Under prolonged water stress this results
in a reduced photosynthetic surface area. There may
be some compensation as stored reserves are mobilized
to offset the loss of new assimilate, but overall even
mild water stress causes a reduction in net productivity.
C4 plants enjoy some advantage over C3 plants with
respect to photosynthesis and water stress because of
their higher water use efﬁciency (Chapter 15).
12.3.5 NITROGEN SUPPLY LIMITS
PRODUCTIVITY
The maximum possible photosynthetic rate of a leaf,
known as the leaf photosynthetic capacity, is determined
as the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area under
conditions of saturating incident light, normal CO2 and
O2 concentrations, optimum temperature, and high rel-
ative humidity. Although leaf photosynthetic capacity
may vary as much as a hundredfold, it is generally high-
est in plants acclimated to resource-rich environments;
that is, where light, water, and nutrients are abundant.
Reduced photosynthesis is a consequence of deﬁciencies
of virtually all essential elements, but photosynthetic
capacity is particularly sensitive to nitrogen supply. As
a basic constituent of chlorophyll, redox carriers in the
photosynthetic electron transport chain, and all of the
enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, nitrogen plays
a critical role in primary productivity.
In a C3 species, Rubisco alone will account for more
than half of the total leaf nitrogen. In one study, net
photosynthesis increased linearly with nitrogen content
(Figure 12.9). In barley seedlings, a 5-fold increase in
nitrate supply stimulated a 25-fold increase in net photo-
synthesis. One impact of nitrogen deﬁciency is to reduce
the amount and activity of photosynthetic enzymes, but
leaf expansion and other factors no doubt contribute
to reductions in photosynthetic capacity as well. Thus,
to maximize plant biomass requires the integration of
complex metabolic pathways including photosynthesis,
respiration, and nitrogen assimilation (Figure 12.10).
This is due to the fact that photosynthesis provides
energy in the form of ﬁxed carbon as well as basic car-
bon skeletons for all the necessary cellular constituents.
The energy stored as ﬁxed carbon through photosynthe-
sis (Chapters 7 and 8) is retrieved by the cell for all other

processes such as growth and development through
the process of respiration (Chapter 10). Intermediates
of the TCA cycle combine with nitrate assimilation to
provide amino acid biosynthesis (Chapters 10 and 11).
Photosynthetic energy is used directly in nitrate reduc-
tion (Chapter 11) and nitrogen assimilation provides
amino acids for the synthesis of enzymes and proteins
involved in both photosynthesis and respiration. Thus,
all three primary metabolic pathways are intimately
connected to each other through GS/GOGAT and its
regulation by PII proteins (Chapter 11).
12.3.6 LEAF FACTORS
The net carbon gain of an individual leaf depends on
its photosynthetic capacity limited by environmental
parameters and balanced against its construction and
maintenance costs. For example, the net carbon gain of a
leaf varies markedly during leaf development and aging.
During initial development and the rapid growth phase,
the photosynthetic capacity of a leaf also increases. How-
ever, the developing leaf functions as a sink, utilizing
carbon assimilated locally as well as importing carbon to
support its expansion. Leaf photosynthetic capacity then
declines as the aging leaf undergoes senescence, a pro-
gressive deterioration of the leaf characterized in part
by the loss of chlorophyll and photosynthetic enzymes.
Only in the period between full expansion and the onset
of senescence does a leaf produce a proﬁt in terms of
carbon gain.
Different types of leaves may also have differ-
ent photosynthetic capacities. Evergreen leaves, for
example, have a lower photosynthetic capacity than
deciduous leaves and, because they take longer to
develop, their construction costs are also higher. Still,
the evergreen leaf may be favored if the cost of main-
taining the leaf over winter together with the cost of a
lower photosynthetic capacity are less than the cost of
producing a new leaf.
Regardless of leaf photosynthetic capacity, unfavor-
able environmental conditions will cause a reduction
in long-term carbon gain (Chapter13). In any natural
environment, available water, the quantity of light, and
temperature will all vary widely and to some extent inde-
pendently, often keeping the photosynthetic rate well
below full capacity. In addition, a prominent feature in
the environment of any leaf is the presence of other
leaves; that is, leaves are normally part of a canopy. Net
primary productivity of a stand of plants is markedly
inﬂuenced by canopy structure. Canopy structure is in
turn determined by the age, morphology, angle, and
spacing of individual leaves.
A herbaceous C3 annual plant is characterized by
a gradient in leaf age and development along the stem
axis. The young, growing leaves at the top are exposed
to full sunlight while older leaves further down may
be heavily shaded. Irradiance reaching shaded leaves
may be reduced to 10 percent or less, thus producing
a very low net photosynthesis. Very often the ﬂuence
rate reaching leaves lowermost in a canopy may fall
below the light compensation point for a large part of
the day. Those leaves would not only no longer con-
tribute to net photosynthesis, but would incur a negative
carbon gain through respiratory loss. Many herbaceous
annuals avoid the costs of maintaining such nonpro-
ductive leaves by undergoing sequential senescence;
that is, the older leaves lower in the canopy senesce as
new leaves are being formed at the top of the canopy.
Senescing leaves may lose as much as 50 percent of
their dry weight, largely in the form of soluble organic
nitrogen compounds, before dying and falling to the
ground. These compounds are exported to developing
leaves and other sinks where they are reused. In this
way, limited resources are redistributed among leaves of
varying ages in order to maximize whole plant carbon
gain.
Canopy architecture is important when consider-
ing agricultural crops and natural ecosystems because
it determines how efﬁciently light is absorbed. High
productivity is in part dependent on the extent to which
ground area is covered with photosynthetic surface.
Because sunlight striking exposed soil does not con-
tribute to productivity, most agricultural systems are
designed so that the young plants ﬁll in the canopy
rapidly in order to maximize interception of available
light. On the other hand, planting at too high a density
will introduce mutual shading by leaves in the canopy.
Shading reduces the overall efﬁciency of light intercep-
tion and, consequently, reduces long-term carbon gain
(Figure 12.11). The ratio of photosynthetic leaf area to
covered ground area is known as the leaf area index
(LAI). Leaf area is usually taken as the area of a single
surface (or projected area, where leaves are not planar).
Because both leaf surface and the covered ground are
measured as areas (m2), LAI is dimensionless. Values of
LAI in productive agricultural ecosystems typically fall
in the range of 3 to 5.
The optimum LAI for a given stand of plants
depends on the angle between the leaf and the stem.
Horizontal leaves, typical of beans (Phaseolus) and sim-
ilar crops, are efﬁcient light absorbers because of the

broad surface presented to the sun, but they also more
effectively shade leaves lower down in the canopy. Erect
leaves, typical of grasses like wheat (Triticum) and maize
(Zea mays), produce less shading but, because of their
steeper angle, are not as efﬁcient at intercepting light.
Experiments with closely spaced rice plants have shown
that carbon gain dropped by a third when leaves were
weighted in the horizontal position. With maize, tying
upper leaves into a more erect posture increased yield
by as much as 15 percent. In some crop plants, such
as sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris), leaf angle varies from near
vertical at the top of the plant to horizontal at the
base. This arrangement reduces light interception by
the uppermost leaves, but allows light to penetrate more
deeply into the canopy. Overall, the more uniform dis-
tribution of light tends to improve the efﬁciency of light
interception by the canopy and thus the efﬁciency of
carbon gain.
The relationship between LAI, leaf angle, and pho-
tosynthetic rate has been tested by computer models.
The results show that with low values of LAI leaf angle
has little effect, but above a LAI of 3, more layers of
vertical leaves are required to maximize photosynthesis.
Field studies have conﬁrmed that canopies with pre-
dominantly horizontal leaves have LAI values of 2 or
less, while vertical leaf canopies support LAI values of
3 to 7.
In cases where the leaves are more or less ﬁxed in
space, the efﬁciency of light interception will change
with the angle of the sun. Many desert and agricul-
tural species, however, have the capacity to alter the
orientation of their leaves, allowing them to track the
sun as it moves across the sky through the day. Called
heliotropism, or solar tracking, the leaf blades move
in such a way that their surfaces remain perpendicular
to the sun’s direct rays. Solar tracking would help to
maximize daily carbon gain in those plants that must
complete their life cycle in a brief period before the
onset of unfavorable conditions such as drought or high
temperatures.
SUMMARY
Carbon assimilation by plants creates the plant
biomass that supports humans and virtually all other
heterotrophic organisms. The study of carbon gain, or
productivity, at both the organismal and population
level is an important component of agricultural and
ecosystem research. Overall carbon gain depends
on net primary productivity—the balance between
carbon uptake by photosynthesis and carbon loss to
respiration. Carbon loss to respiration can be divided
into the carbon cost of growth, or growth respiration,
and the cost of simply maintaining structure and
processes that do not result in a net increase in
dry matter. Several studies have shown a negative
correlation between respiration and growth rate. The
implication is that respiration has a signiﬁcant impact
on biomass accumulation and yield, and that improving
yield by manipulating respiration might be feasible.
Productivity is also inﬂuenced by a variety of
genetic and environmental factors that inﬂuence photo-
synthesis. These include light, available carbon dioxide,
temperature, soil water, nutrients, and canopy struc-
ture. The rate of photosynthesis increases between
the light compensation point and saturation. Because
irradiance changes constantly throughout the day,
long-term carbon gain depends on the cumulative irra-
diance over the growing season.
Although the carbon dioxide content of the atmo-
sphere is relatively constant in the short term, there
is evidence that plants use the stomata to keep the
internal carbon dioxide concentration in balance with
electron transport capacity. On the other hand, with
adequate light, plants will respond to carbon dioxide
enrichment by increased productivity. However, ulti-
mately productivity is also dependent on source-sink
relationships.
Photosynthesis, respiration, and photorespiration
respond differently to temperature. Thus the optimum
temperature for net photosynthesis is not the same as
the optimum temperature for gross photosynthesis.
Plants also require an adequate water and nitrogen
supply in order to maximize their leaf photosynthetic
capacity. Productivity in a stand depends on the pattern
of leaf senescence and the structure of the canopy.

Responses of Plants to Environmental Stress
The previous chapters have focused on the underlying
processes by which plant roots acquire water and nutri-
ents from the soil (Chapters 1 to 4), leaves harvest light
energy and convert atmospheric CO2 and soil NO−
3 into
stable chemical forms of sucrose, starch, and and amino
acids (Chapters 5, 7, 8, 11) and subsequently unlock
the stored chemical energy through the process of gly-
colysis and mitochondrial respiration for growth and
development (Chapter 10). By necessity, to elucidate
the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which
these processes occur, plants are studied under normal
or ideal environmental conditions for growth and devel-
opment. However, plants often encounter unusual or
extreme conditions: trees and shrubs in the northern
temperate latitudes experience the extreme low temper-
atures of winter; alpine plants experience cold and drying
winds; and agricultural crops may experience periods of
extended drought as well as high and low temperatures.
Extremes in environmental parameters create stress-
ful conditions for plants, which may have a signiﬁcant
impact on their physiology, development, and survival.
The study of plant responses to environmental stress
has long been a central theme for plant environmental
physiologists and physiological ecologists. How plants
respond to stress helps to explain their geographic dis-
tribution and their performance along environmental
gradients. Because stress invariably leads to reduced
productivity, stress responses are also important to
agricultural scientists. Understanding stress responses is
essential in attempts to breed stress-resistant cultivars
that can withstand drought, and other yield-limiting
conditions. Finally, because stressful conditions cause
perturbations in the way a plant functions, they provide
the plant physiologist with another very useful tool for
the study of basic physiology and biochemistry.
This chapter will examine some of the stresses that
plants encounter in their environment. The principal
topics to be addressed include
•
the basic concepts of plant stress, acclimation, and
adaptation,
•
the light-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis
through a process called photoinhibition,
•
the effects of water deﬁcits on stomatal conductance,
•
the effects of high- and low-temperature stress on
plant survival,
•
the challenge of freezing stress on plant survival, and
•
the responses of plants to biotic stress due to infes-
tations by insects and disease.
13.1 WHAT IS PLANT STRESS?
Because life is an endergonic process, that is G > 0
(Chapter 5), energy is an absolute requirement for the
223

224
Chapter 13 / Responses of Plants to Environmental Stress
maintenance of structural organization over the lifetime
of the organism. The maintenance of such complex
order over time requires a constant through put of
energy. This means that individual organisms are not
closed systems but are open systems relative to their
surrounding environment. This results in a constant
ﬂow of energy through all biological organisms, which
provides the dynamic driving force for the performance
of important maintenance processes such as cellular
biosyntheses and transport to maintain its characteristic
structure and organization as well as the capacity to
replicate and grow. Such energy ﬂow ensures that living
biological organisms are never at equilibrium with their
environment, that is, G is never equal to zero, but
remain in a steady-state condition far from equilibrium
(see Chapter 5). The maintenance of such a steady-state
results in a meta-stable condition called homeostasis.
As a consequence, all life forms may be considered
transient energy storage devices with ﬁnite but varying
lifetimes (Figure 13.1).
Any change in the surrounding environment may
disrupt homeostasis. Environmental modulation of
homeostasis may be deﬁned as biological stress. Thus,
it follows that plant stress implies some adverse effect
on the physiology of a plant induced upon a sudden
transition from some optimal environmental condition
where homeostasis is maintained to some suboptimal
condition which disrupts this initial homeostatic state
(Figure 13.2). Thus, plant stress is a relative term since
the experimental design to assess the impact of a stress
always involves the measurement of a physiological
phenomenon in a plant species under a suboptimal,
stress condition compared to the measurement of the
same physiological phenomenon in the same plant
species under optimal conditions. Since the extent of a
stress can be quantiﬁed by assessing the difference in
these measurements under optimal versus suboptimal
conditions, the basis of stress physiology is comparative

Upon the imposition of an external stress, the rate of
this physiological process decreases rapidly. It is fatal
for some plants that are unable to adjust to an imposed
stress and can not establish a new homeostatic state. Such
plants are classiﬁed as susceptible to the stress.
physiology. However, plant species are highly variable
with respect to their optimum environments and their
susceptibility to extremes of, for example, irradiance,
temperature, and water potential. Is stress a function of
the environment or the organism? For example, are the
extreme environments encountered in deserts or arctic
tundra stressful for plants that normally thrive there?
Are these environments stressful only to some species
but not to others?
13.2 PLANTS RESPOND TO
STRESS IN SEVERAL
DIFFERENT WAYS
Plant stress can be divided into two primary categories.
Abiotic stress is a physical (e.g., light, tempera,-
ture) or chemical insult that the environment may
impose on a plant. Biotic stress is a biological insult,
(e.g., insects, disease) to which a plant may be exposed
during its lifetime (Figure 13.3). Some plants may be
injured by a stress, which means that they exhibit
one or more metabolic dysfunctions. If the stress is
moderate and short term, the injury may be temporary
and the plant may recover when the stress is removed.
If the stress is severe enough, it may prevent ﬂowering,
seed formation, and induce senescence that leads to
plant death. Such plants are considered to be suscep-
tible (Figure 13.3). Some plants escape the stress alto-
gether, such as ephemeral, or short-lived, desert plants.

FIGURE 13.3 The effect of environmental stress on plant
survival.
Ephemeral plants germinate, grow, and ﬂower very
quickly following seasonal rains. They thus complete
their life cycle during a period of adequate moisture
and form dormant seeds before the onset of the dry
season. In a similar manner, many arctic annuals rapidly
complete their life cycle during the short arctic summer
and survive over winter in the form of seeds. Because
ephemeral plants never really experience the stress of
drought or low temperature, these plants survive the
environmental stress by stress avoidance (Figure 13.3).
Avoidance mechanisms reduce the impact of a
stress, even though the stress is present in the environ-
ment. Established plants of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), for
example, survive dry habitats as adult plants by sending
down deep root systems that penetrate the water table.
Alfalfa is thereby ensured an adequate water supply
under conditions in which more shallow-rooted plants
would experience drought. Other plants develop ﬂeshy
leaves that store water, thick cuticles or pubescence (leaf
hairs) to help reduce evaporation, or other modiﬁca-
tions that help to either conserve water or reduce water
loss. Cacti, with their ﬂeshy photosynthetic stems and
leaves reduced to simple thorns, are another example of
drought avoiders. Most drought avoiders would be
severely injured should they ever actually experience
desiccation.
Many plants have the capacity to tolerate a particu-
lar stress and hence are considered to be stress resistant
(Figure 13.3). Stress resistance requires that the organ-
ism exhibit the capacity to adjust or to acclimate to the
stress.
Finally, a controversy over terminology is con-
cerned with use of the term strategy. Strategy is often
used to describe the manner in which a plant responds
successfully to a particular stress. Some physiologists
object to use of the term for the reason that strat-
egy implies a conscious plan; that is, it is teleological.1
However, strategy can validly describe a genetically pro-
grammed sequence of responses that enable an organism
to survive in a particular environment.
13.3 TOO MUCH LIGHT
INHIBITS PHOTOSYNTHESIS
In Chapters 7 and 8, we discussed the conversion of
visible light energy into ATP and NADPH through
photosynthetic electron transport. In addition to form-
ing Triose-P that can be converted to sucrose or starch,
the ATP and NADPH are required to regenerate RuBP
by the Calvin Cycle (Figure 13.4A). The continuous
regeneration of RuBP is an absolute requirement for
the continuous assimilation of CO2 by Rubisco. This
requirement which is satisﬁed by the light-dependent
biosynthesis of ATP and NADPH is what makes CO2
assimilation light dependent. However, although light
is required for the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2,
too much light can inhibit photosynthesis.
In all plants, the light response curve for pho-
tosynthesis exhibits saturation kinetics as illustrated
in Figure 13.4B. At low irradiance, the rate of CO2
assimilation increases linearly with an increase in irra-
diance. This is to be expected since more absorbed
light means higher rates of electron transport which, in
turn, means increasing levels of ATP and NADPH for
the regeneration of RuBP (Figure 13.4A). Thus, under
low, light-limiting conditions, the rate at which RuBP
is regenerated through the consumption of ATP and
NADPH by the Calvin Cycle limits the rate of photo-
synthesis measured either as CO2 assimilation or O2
evolution. The maximum initial slope of the photo-
synthetic light response curve under low, light-limiting
conditions provides a measure of photosynthetic efﬁ-
ciency measured either as moles of CO2 assimilated per
photon absorbed, or alternatively, moles of O2 evolved
per photon absorbed if photosynthesis is measured as
the rate of O2 evolution (Figure 13.4B).
Upon further increases in irradiance, the rate of
photosynthesis is no longer a linear function of irra-
diance but rather levels off. At these higher light
intensities, the rate of photosynthesis is said to be
light saturated (Figure 13.4B, red shaded area). This
means that the Calvin Cycle is saturated with ATP and
NADPH which, in turn, means that Rubisco is satu-
rated with one of its substrates, RuBP. The maximum
light saturated rate is a measure of photosynthetic
1Teleology is the doctrine of ﬁnal causes, assigning purpose
to natural processes. Teleological arguments are considered
inappropriate in natural science.

capacity and will have the units of either moles of
CO2 assimilated or moles of O2 evolved per leaf area
per unit time. Thus, under light-saturated conditions,
the rate of regeneration of RuBP no longer limits
the rate of CO2 assimilation but rather it is the rate
at which Rubisco can consume RuBP and CO2 that
limits the rate of photosynthesis. Consequently, under
light-saturated conditions, the rate of photosynthesis
becomes light-independent, that is, the exposure of a
plant to higher irradiance no longer changes the rate of
photosynthesis. Under light-saturated conditions, plants
become exposed to increasing levels of excess light
(Figure 13.4B, yellow shaded area), that is, they become
exposed to more light than the plant can use for photo-
synthesis. If the plant continues to be exposed to higher
and higher levels of excess light, the rate of photosyn-
thesis begins to decrease (Figure 13.4B). This is called
photoinhibition of photosynthesis and is deﬁned as the
light-dependent decrease in photosynthetic rate that
may occur whenever the irradiance is in excess of that
required either for the photosynthetic evolution of O2
or the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2.

13.3 Too Much Light Inhibits Photosynthesis
227
There is a consensus in the literature that in
most plants, PSII is more sensitive to photoinhibition
than PSI. The effects of exposure to photoinhibition
by shifting
plants from low light to high light
can be assessed either by monitoring changes in
photosynthetic efﬁciency and photosynthetic capac-
ity (Figure
13.5A) or by monitoring
chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence (Box 13.1) to assess changes in max-
imum PSII photochemical efﬁciency measured as
Fv/Fm (Figure 13.5B). Photoinhibition that results
in a decrease in photosynthetic efﬁciency as well
as photosynthetic capacity (Figure 13.5A) usually reﬂects

chronic photoinhibition which is the result of photo-
damage to PSII. Speciﬁcally, the site of damage is the
D1 reaction center polypeptide of PSII which causes
a decrease in the efﬁciency of PSII charge separation
(Chapter 7). This decrease in the PSII photochemical
efﬁciency can be measured as Fv/Fm (Figure 13.5B)
(Box 13.1). The decrease in PSII photochemical efﬁ-
ciency is usually paralleled by a decrease in photosyn-
thetic efﬁciency of O2 evolution. A characteristic of
chronic photoinhibition is that it is only very slowly
reversible after plants are shifted from excess light to
low light (Figure 13.5B).
13.3.1 THE D1 REPAIR CYCLE
OVERCOMES PHOTODAMAGE
TO PSII
PSII reaction centers exhibit an inherent lifetime. This
was ﬁrst indicated by the fact that the D1 polypeptide of
PSII reaction centers exhibits the fastest turnover rate
of any plant protein. The D1 polypeptide is degraded
and resynthesized in the time span of approximately
30 minutes. Recently, it has been proposed that PSII
actually exhibits the properties consistent with a pho-
ton counter, that is, its lifetime is dependent upon
the number of photons absorbed and not the absolute
time. It has been calculated that, under normal growth
conditions, each PSII reaction center is irreversibly dam-
aged presumably due to photooxidative damage and
spontaneously degraded after the absorption of 105 to
107 photons. Thus, exposure to excess light simply
shortens the lifetime of PSII because these conditions
would enhance the probability of photooxidative dam-
age and shorten the time to absorb the necessary photons
to cause the degradation of D1.
How do plants ensure a constant supply of func-
tional PSII reaction centers? Plants and green algae
exhibit a single chloroplastic gene that encodes the D1
polypeptide called psbA. These organisms have evolved
a D1 repair cycle which repairs photodamage to PSII
(Figure 13.8). When the D1 polypeptide is damaged, it
is marked for degradation by protein phosphorylation.
After phosphorylation of D1, PSII is partially disassem-
bled and the D1 polypeptide is degraded by proteolysis.
Subsequently, the psbA gene is transcribed and translated
using the chloroplastic transcriptional and translational
machinery with the subsequent accumulation of a new
D1 polypeptide. This new D1 polypeptide is inserted
into the nonappressed, stromal thylakoids and a new,
functional PSII complex is reassembled. Given the lat-
eral heterogeneity present in thylakoid membranes, the
mechanism by which damaged PSII complexes migrate
laterally from granal stacks to nonappressed, stromal
thylakoids for disassembly and reassembly remains to be
elucidated.

FLUORESCENCE
In Chapter 6 we deﬁned ﬂuorescence as the emission
of a photon of light by an excited molecule as it
returns to ground state from its lowest singlet excited
state. Due to the initial thermal deactivation to the
lowest singlet excited state, chlorophyll emits red light
as it ﬂuoresces to ground state. Thus, regardless of
the wavelength used to excite chlorophyll, it always
emits red light. Of the total energy absorbed by a
leaf, less than 3 percent of that energy is lost due to
chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. Due to the differences in the
structure and composition of PSII and PSI, chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence measured at room-temperature emanates
primarily
from
PSII
(Figure
13.6).
Due
to
this
property, room-temperature chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
is exploited as a sensitive, intrinsic probe not only
of PSII function but also of the overall function
of
photosynthesis.

consequence,
chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence is undoubtedly the most widely used spec-
troscopic technique in photosynthesis and plant stress
research.

than 3 percent of the absorbed light energy is ever lost as
chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, this pathway is not considered
a major pathway for the safe dissipation of excess light
energy. However, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence is a sensitive,
intrinsic probe for the function of the photosynthetic
apparatus and overall physiological status of the plant.

pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
(PAM). This method allows one to analyze Chl ﬂuores-
cence quenching by the saturation pulse method. When
a sample is in the dark-adapted state, turning on the
low-intensity modulated measuring beam results in a
minimal ﬂuorescence yield called Fo. The maximal ﬂuo-
resence yield (Fm) can be estimated by the subsequent
application of a high-intensity millisecond saturating
pulse of white light. Since variable ﬂuorescence (Fv) is
deﬁned as Fm −Fo, therefore,

When the sample is illuminated with actinic light suf-
ﬁcient to induce photosynthesis, the ﬂuorescence yield
(FS) undergoes complex transitions until eventually FS
reaches a minimal, steady-state level. This is called the
Kautsky induction curve. PAM ﬂuorescence exploits
the fact that maximal ﬂuorescence yield (F′
m) can be
assessed during active photosynthesis induced by the
actinic light by repetitively applying saturating pulses of
light as indicated by the vertical spikes emanating from
the Kautsky induction curve indicated in Figure 13.7.
To a ﬁrst approximation, Fm −F′m represents nonpho-
tochemical quenching of the ﬂuoresence yield, whereas
F′m −Fs represents photochemical quenching.
Kautsky and Hirsch were the ﬁrst to report the
variable nature of the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence signal.
Subsequent detailed studies of this complex ﬂuorescence
signal (Figure 13.7) showed it to be rich in information
with respect to the properties of the PSII reaction cen-
ter as well as its association with overall photosynthetic
electron transport and CO2 assimilation. When a leaf or
an algal suspension is dark adapted for anywhere from
5 minutes to 60 minutes at room temperature depending
on the species used, all electrons are drained from the
photosynthetic electron transport chain by PSI causing
all PSII reaction centers to be in the open conﬁguration

229
[P680 Pheo QA] (Chapter 7). The minimal ﬂuorescence
yield with all PSII reaction centers in the open con-
ﬁguration is called the background or Fo ﬂuorescence
(Figure 13.7). If the samples are now exposed to a light
intensity sufﬁciently strong to initiate photosynthesis, a
ﬂuorescence signal characterized by complex transients
can be detected (Figure 13.7). This is called the Kaut-
sky effect. The fast rise from Fo to an initial maximum
ﬂuorescence (Fm) (Figure 13.7) is due to the fact that the
light absorbed closes the PSII reaction centers [P680+
Pheo Q−
A] (Chapter 7) much faster through energy trans-
fer and photochemistry than they can be reopened by
PSI, intersystem electron transport and ultimately CO2
assimilation (Figure 13.7). The subsequent decrease in
the ﬂuorescence yield or ﬂuorescence quenching reﬂects
the reopening of PSII reaction centers. This is due to
the induction of the much slower, enzyme-catalyzed
reactions involved in ATP and NADPH biosynthesis,
which are in turn ultimately consumed by biochemical
reactions involved in CO2 assimilation. Thus, chloro-
phyll ﬂuorescence yield is inversely proportional to the
rate of photosynthesis.
It is incumbent upon all photosynthetic organisms
to maintain a balance in energy budget, that is, a balance
between the energy absorbed through photochemistry
versus energy either utilized through metabolism and
growth and/or dissipated nonphotochemically as heat.
There is a consensus that most photosynthetic organ-
isms possess two primary mechanisms to maintain an
energy balance. (1) Photochemical quenching, mea-
sured as qP (Equation 13.1), reﬂects the capacity to
utilize excess absorbed energy through metabolism and
growth.
qP = Fm′ −Fs/Fm′ −Fo
(13.1)
NPQ = Fm −Fm′/Fm′
(13.2)
This involves the upregulation of the expression and
activity of speciﬁc enzymes involved in stromal CO2
assimilation (Rubisco), cytosolic sucrose biosynthesis
(SPS), as well as vacuolar fructan biosynthesis in
certain plant species such as the cereals (Chapter 9).

zeaxanthin. Photochemical-quenching capacity (qP) and
nonphotochemical-quenching capacity (qN, NPQ) can
be estimated in vivo using pulse-amplitude-modulated

photoinhibition induced by any environmental stress

of

before
and after a photoinhibition treatment. Fv/Fm can be
calculated from the following equation (Equation 13.3).
As expected, the decrease in Fv/Fm follows a similar
pattern as the decrease in photosynthetic efﬁciency of
O2 evolution in response to time under conditions of
photoinhibition.
Fv/Fm = (Fm −Fo)/Fm

13.4 WATER STRESS IS A
PERSISTENT THREAT
TO PLANT SURVIVAL
Water stress may arise through either an excess of
water or a water deﬁcit. An example of excess water
is ﬂooding. Flooding stress is most commonly an oxy-
gen stress, due primarily to reduced oxygen supply to
the roots. Reduced oxygen in turn limits respiration,
nutrient uptake, and other critical root functions. Stress
due to water deﬁcit is far more common, so much so
that the correct term water deﬁcit stress is usually
shortened to simply water stress. We will focus on
water deﬁcit stress in this chapter. Because water stress
in natural environments usually arises due to lack of
rainfall, a condition known as drought, this stress is
often referred to as drought stress. In the laboratory,
water stress can be simulated by allowing transpirational
loss from leaves (Chapter 2), a condition commonly
referred to as desiccation stress.

ultimate source of energy for photosynthesis, too much
light can be dangerous because it may result in damage
to the photosystems, especially the D1 reaction cen-

evolved an elaborate mechanism to repair photodam-
age called the D1 repair cycle. Exposure to an irradiance
that exceeds the capacity of the plant either to utilize
that energy in photosynthesis or to dissipate it safely
as heat results in damage to the D1 polypeptide. Func-
tional PSII reaction centers are converted to damaged
PSII reaction centers. When this happens, PSII is dis-
assembled and D1 is degraded by thylakoid proteolytic
enzymes. Subsequently, new D1 is synthesized de novo
by the chloroplast translational machinery and inserted
into the thylakoid membrane to form functional PSII
reaction centers.
13.4.1 WATER STRESS LEADS
TO MEMBRANE DAMAGE
Damage resulting from water stress is related to the
detrimental
effects
of
desiccation
on
protoplasm.
Removal of water, for example, leads to an increase
in solute concentration as the protoplast volume
shrinks, which may itself have serious structural and
metabolic consequences. The integrity of membranes
and proteins is also affected by desiccation, which in
turn leads to metabolic dysfunctions. Stresses may
alter the lipid bilayer and cause the displacement
of membrane proteins, which, together with solute
leakage, contributes to a loss of membrane selectivity, a
general disruption of cellular compartmentation, and a
loss of activity of membrane-based enzymes.
In addition to membrane damage, numerous stud-
ies have shown that cytosolic and organellar proteins
may undergo substantial loss of activity or even com-
plete denaturation when dehydrated. Loss of membrane
integrity and protein stability may both be exacer-
bated by high concentrations of cellular electrolytes
that accompany dehydration of protoplasm. The con-
sequence of all these events is a general disruption of
metabolism in the cell upon rehydration.
13.4.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS
PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE
TO WATER STRESS
Photosynthesis can be affected by water stress in two
ways. First, closure of the stomata normally cuts off
access of the chloroplasts to the atmospheric supply of
carbon dioxide. Second, there are direct effects of low
cellular water potential on the structural integrity of
the photosynthetic machinery. The role of water stress
in stomatal closure will be discussed in the following
section.
Direct effects of low water potential on photo-
synthesis have been studied extensively in chloroplasts
isolated from sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus) leaves sub-
jected to desiccation. Sunﬂower has proven useful for
these studies because stomatal closure has only a minor
effect on photosynthesis. This is because direct effects
on the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts decrease
the demand for CO2 and the CO2 level inside the leaf
remains relatively high. Both electron transport activity
and photophosphorylation are reduced in chloroplasts
isolated from sunﬂower leaves with leaf water potentials
below about -1.0 MPa. These effects reﬂect damage to
the thylakoid membranes and ATP synthase protein
(CF0-CF1) complex (Chapters 5 and 7).
The direct effects of water stress on photosynthesis
are exacerbated by the additional effects of light. Since
water stress inhibits CO2 assimilation, this means that
water stress will expose plants to excess light. The
light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments of the
leaf continue to absorb light but this absorbed light
energy can not be processed because photosynthetic
electron transport is inhibited. Thus, a concomitant
effect of exposure of plants to a water deﬁcit is chronic
photoinhibition.
13.4.3 STOMATA RESPOND TO
WATER DEFICIT
Plants are often subjected to acute water deﬁcits due to a
rapid drop in humidity or increase in temperature when
a warm, dry air mass moves into their environment.
The result can be a dramatic increase in the vapor
pressure gradient between the leaf and the surrounding
air. Consequently, the rate of transpiration increases
(Chapter 2). An increase in the vapor pressure gradient
will also enhance drying of the soil. Because evaporation
occurs at the soil surface, the arrival of a dry air mass
has particular consequences for the uptake of water by
shallow-rooted plants.
Plants generally respond to water stress by closing
their stomata in order to match transpirational water loss
through the leaf surfaces with the rate at which water
can be resupplied by the roots. It has been shown in vir-
tually all plants studied thus far, including plants from

13.4 Water Stress is a Persistent Threat to Plant Survival
231
desert, temperate, and tropical habitats, that stomatal
opening and closure is responsive to ambient humidity.
Unlike the surrounding epidermal cells, the surfaces of
the guard cells are not protected with a heavy cuti-
cle. Consequently, guard cells lose water directly to the
atmosphere. If the rate of evaporative water loss from
the guard cells exceeds the rate of water regain from
underlying mesophyll cells, the guard cells will become
ﬂaccid and the stomatal aperture will close. The guard
cells may thus respond directly to the vapor pressure
gradient between the leaf and the atmosphere. Closure
of the stomata by direct evaporation of water from the
guard cells is sometimes referred to as hydropassive
closure. Hydropassive closure requires no metabolic
involvement on the part of the guard cells; guard
cells respond to loss of water as a simple osmometer
(Chapter 1).
Stomatal closure is also regulated by hydroactive
processes. Hydroactive closure is metabolically depen-
dent and involves essentially a reversal of the ion ﬂuxes
that cause opening (Chapter 1). Hydroactive closure is
triggered by decreasing water potential in the leaf meso-
phyll cells and appears to involve abscisic acid (ABA) and
other hormones. Since the discovery of ABA in the late
1960s, it has been known to have a prominent role in
stomatal closure due to water stress. ABA accumulates
in water-stressed (that is, wilted) leaves and external
application of ABA is a powerful inhibitor of stomatal
opening. Furthermore, two tomato mutants, known as
ﬂacca and sitiens, fail to accumulate normal levels of
ABA and both will wilt very readily. The precise role of
ABA in stomatal closure in water-stressed whole plants
has, however, been difﬁcult to decipher with certainty.
This is because ABA is ubiquitous, often occurring in
high concentrations in nonstressed tissue. Also, some
early studies indicated that stomata would begin to close
before increases in ABA content could be detected.
In most well-watered plants, ABA appears to be
synthesized in the cytoplasm of leaf mesophyll cells but,
because of intracellular pH gradients, ABA accumulates
in the chloroplasts (Figure 13.9). At low pH, ABA exists
in the protonated form ABAH, which freely permeates
most cell membranes. The dissociated form ABA−is
impermeant; because it is a charged molecule it does
not readily cross membranes. Thus, ABAH tends to
diffuse from cellular compartments with a low pH into
compartments with a higher pH. There, some of it
dissociates to ABA−and becomes trapped. It is well
established that in actively photosynthesizing mesophyll
cells the cytosol will be moderately acidic (pH 6.0 to 6.5)
while the chloroplast stroma is alkaline (pH 7.5 to 8.0)
(Chapter 7). It has been calculated that if the stroma pH
is 7.5 and cytosolic pH is 6.5, the concentration of ABA
in the chloroplasts will be about tenfold higher than in
the cytosol.
According to the current model, the initial detec-
tion of water stress in leaves is related to its effects on
photosynthesis, described earlier in this chapter. Inhibi-
tion of electron transport and photophosphorylation in
the chloroplasts would disrupt proton accumulation in
the thylakoid lumen and lower the stroma pH. At the
same time, there is an increase in the pH of the apoplast
surrounding the mesophyll cells. The resulting pH gra-
dient stimulates a release of ABA from the mesophyll
cells into the apoplast, where it can be carried in the
transpiration stream to the guard cells (Figure 13.10).
Just how ABA controls turgor in the guard cells
remains to be determined. Evidence indicates that ABA
does not need to enter the guard cell, but acts instead on
the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Presumably
ABA interacts with the high-afﬁnity binding sites on the
plasma membrane (see Chapter 21), although the exis-
tence of such sites has yet to be conﬁrmed. Nonetheless,
there are strong indications that ABA interferes with
plasma membrane proton pumps and, consequently, the
uptake of K+, or that it stimulates K+ efﬂux from the
guard cells. Either way, the guard cells will lose turgor,
leading to closure of the stomata.

In the light, photosynthesis drives protons
into the interior of the thylakoid, creating
a pH gradient between the stroma and the
cytosol. The pH gradient favors movement
of ABAH into the chloroplast, where it dis-
sociates to ABA−. The membrane is less
permeable to ABA−. In the dark, protons
leak back into the stroma, the pH gradient
collapses, and ABAH moves back into the
cytosol.

ABA equilibrates with the chloroplasts of the photosyn-
thetic mesophyll cells or is carried to the stomatal guard
cells in the apoplast.
As noted above, wilted leaves accumulate large
quantities of ABA. In most cases, however, stomatal
closure begins before there is any signiﬁcant increase in
the ABA concentration. This can be explained by the
release of stored ABA into the apoplast, which occurs
early enough and in sufﬁcient quantity—the apoplast
concentration will at least double—to account for initial
closure. Increased ABA synthesis follows and serves to
prolong the closing effect.
Stomatal closure does not always rely on the per-
ception of water deﬁcits and signals arising within the
leaves. In some cases it appears that the stomata close
in response to soil desiccation before there is any mea-
surable reduction of turgor in the leaf mesophyll cells.
Several studies have indicated a feed-forward control
system that originates in the roots and transmits infor-
mation to the stomata. In these experiments, plants are
grown such that the roots are equally divided between
two containers of soil (Figure 13.11). Water deﬁcits
can then be introduced by withholding water from

Control plants receive regular watering of both con-
tainers. Stomatal opening along with factors such as
ABA levels, water potential, and turgor are compared
between half-watered plants and fully watered controls.
Typically, stomatal conductance, a measure of stom-
atal opening, declines within a few days of withholding
water from the roots (Figure 13.12), yet there is no
measurable change in water potential or loss of turgor
in the leaves. In experiments with day ﬂower (Commelina
communis), there was a signiﬁcant increase in ABA con-
tent of the roots in the dry container and in the leaf
epidermis (Figure 13.13). Furthermore, ABA is readily
translocated from roots to the leaves in the transpiration
stream, even when roots are exposed to dry air. These
results provide reasonably good evidence that ABA is
involved in a kind of early warning system that com-
municates information about soil water potential to the
leaves.

Hormones other than ABA may also be involved
in communication between water-stressed roots and
leaves. In an experiment with half-watered maize (Zea
mays) plants, results similar to those with Commelina
were obtained. One notable exception was that the ABA
content of the leaves did not increase, and the application
of cytokinins to the leaves prevented stomatal closure.
At least in Zea, it appears that closure is brought about
by decreased movement of cytokinins out of the drying
roots.
Both hydropassive and hydroactive closure of stom-
ata represent mechanisms that enable plants to anticipate
potential problems of water availability through either
excessive transpirational loss from the leaves or chronic,
but nonlethal, soil water deﬁcit. Although considerable
progress has been achieved in this ﬁeld over the last
decade, there is clearly much yet to be learned about
stomatal behavior and the response of plants to water
stress.
13.5 PLANTS ARE SENSITIVE
TO FLUCTUATIONS
IN TEMPERATURE
Plants exhibit a wide range of sensitivities to extremes
of temperature. Some are killed or injured by moder-
ate chilling temperatures while others can survive. Each
plant has its unique set of temperature requirements
for growth and development (Chapter 27). There is an
optimum temperature at which each plant grows and
develops most efﬁciently, and upper and lower limits
(Chapter 12). As the temperature approaches these lim-
its, growth diminishes, and beyond those limits there is
no growth at all. Except in the relatively stable climates
of tropical forests, temperatures frequently exceed these
limits on a daily or seasonal basis, depending on the envi-
ronment. Deserts, for example, are characteristically hot
and dry during the day but experience low night tem-
peratures because, in the absence of a moist atmosphere,
much of this heat is reradiated into space. Plants at high
altitudes, where much of the daily heat gain is radiated
into the thin atmosphere every night, experience similar
temperature excursions. Plants native to the northern
temperate and boreal forests must survive temperatures
as low as −70◦C every winter. How plants respond to
temperature extremes has long captivated plant biolo-
gists. In this section, we will consider how chilling stress
and high temperature stress effect the physiology of the
plant.
13.5.1 MANY PLANTS ARE CHILLING
SENSITIVE
Plants native to warm habitats are injured when exposed
to low, nonfreezing temperatures and are considered to
be chilling sensitive. Plants such as maize (Zea mays),
tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cucumber (Cucurbita
sp.), soybean (Glycine max), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum),
and banana (Musa sp.) are particularly susceptible and
will exhibit signs of injury when exposed to tempera-
tures below 10 to 15◦C. Even some temperate plants
such as apple (Malus sp.), potato (Solanum tuberosum),
and asparagus (Asparagus sp.) experience injury at tem-
peratures above freezing (0 to 5◦C).
Outward signs of chilling injury can take a variety
of forms, depending on the species and age of the plant
and the duration of the low-temperature stress. Young
seedlings typically show signs of reduced leaf expan-
sion, wilting, and chlorosis. In extreme cases, browning

234
Chapter 13 / Responses of Plants to Environmental Stress
and the appearance of dead tissue (necrosis) and/or
death of the plant will result. In some plants, repro-
ductive development is especially sensitive to chilling
temperature. Exposure of rice plants, for example, to
chilling temperatures at the time of anthesis (ﬂoral
opening) results in sterile ﬂowers. Symptoms of chilling
injury reﬂect a wide range of metabolic dysfunctions
in chilling-sensitive tissues, including: impaired proto-
plasmic streaming, reduced respiration, reduced rates
of protein synthesis as well as altered patterns of pro-
tein synthesis. One of the immediate plant responses
to a chilling stress is the light-dependent inhibition of
photosynthesis. Because low temperature inhibits the
D1 repair cycle, this leads to chronic photoinhibition
of PSII and PSI in cucumber. Indeed, there appear
to be few aspects of cellular biochemistry that are not
impaired in chilling-sensitive tissues following exposure
to low temperature.
One explanation for this is that low tempera-
ture causes reversible changes in the physical state
of cellular membranes. Membrane lipids consist pri-
marily of diacylglycerides containing two fatty acids of
either 16- or 18-carbon atoms. Some fatty acids are
unsaturated, which means that they have one or more
carbon-carbon double bonds (—CH = CH—), while
others are fully saturated with hydrogen (—CH2—
CH2—). Because saturated fatty acids—and lipids that
contain them—solidify at higher temperatures than
unsaturated fatty acids, the relative proportions of unsat-
urated and saturated fatty acids in membrane lipids have
a strong inﬂuence on the ﬂuidity of membranes. A
change in the membrane from the ﬂuid state to a gel (or
semicrystalline) state is marked by an abrupt transition
that can be monitored by a variety of physical meth-
ods. The temperature at which this transition occurs is
known as the transition temperature.
Chilling-sensitive plants tend to have a higher
proportion of saturated fatty acids (Table 13.1) and
a correspondingly higher transition temperature. For
mitochondrial membranes of the chilling-sensitive plant
mung bean (Vigna radiata), for example, the transition
temperature is 14◦C. Mung bean seedlings grow poorly
below 15◦C. Chilling-resistant species, on the other
hand, tend to have lower proportions of saturated fatty
acids and, therefore, lower transition temperatures. Dur-
ing acclimation to low temperature, the proportion of
unsaturated fatty acids increases and transition temper-
ature decreases.
The net effect of the transition from a liquid
membrane to a semicrystalline state at low temperature
is similar to the effects of water stress described above.
The integrity of membrane channels is disrupted,
resulting in loss of compartmentation and solute
leakage, and the operation of integral proteins that
make up respiratory assemblies, photosystems, and
other membrane-based metabolic processes is impaired.

Membranes of chilling-resistant are able to maintain
membrane ﬂuidity to much lower temperatures and
thereby protect these critical cellular functions against
damage. However, it is important to appreciate that
these differences in membrane lipid unsaturation, by
themselves, cannot fully account for the differences
in chilling sensitivity between chilling resistant and
chilling sensitive plant genotypes.
13.5.2 HIGH-TEMPERATURE
STRESS CAUSES PROTEIN
DENATURATION
The traditional view is that the high-temperature limit
for most C3 plants is determined by irreversible pro-
tein denaturation of enzymes. Reactions in the thylakoid
membranes of higher plant chloroplasts are most sen-
sitive to high-temperature damage, with consequent
effects on the efﬁciency of photosynthesis. Photosys-
tem II and its associated oxygen-evolving complex
(Chapter 7) are particularly susceptible to injury. The
oxygen-evolving complex is directly inactivated by heat,
thereby disrupting electron donation to PSII resulting
in the accumulation of P680+, the strongest oxidiz-
ing agent in nature (Chapter 7). The result is that an
increasing portion of the absorbed energy cannot be
used photochemically by PSII which leads to chronic
photoinhibition. This is easily monitored in intact leaves
using chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (Box 13.1). Other stud-
ies have indicated that the activities of Rubisco, Rubisco
activase, and other carbon-ﬁxation enzymes, may also
be severely compromised at high temperatures.
Exposure of most organisms to supraoptimal tem-
peratures for brief periods also suppresses the synthesis
of most proteins including the PSII reaction cen-
ter polypeptide, D1. This leads to an inhibition of
the D1 repair cycle that is critically important to
overcome the effects of chronic photoinhibition. In

contrast, high-temperature stress also induces the syn-
thesis of a new family of low molecular mass proteins
known as heat shock proteins (HSPs). This interesting
class of proteins was originally discovered in Drosophila
melanogaster (fruit ﬂy) but they have since been discov-
ered in a variety of animals, plants, and microorganisms.
Exposures in the range of 15 minutes to a few hours at
temperatures 5◦C to 15◦C above the normal growing
temperature are usually sufﬁcient to cause full induction
of HSPs. HSPs are either not present or present at very
low levels in nonstressed tissues. Initially, interest in
HSPs centered on their potential for the study of gene
regulation. There are, however, several aspects of HSPs
that are of physiological interest.
There are three distinct classes of HSPs in higher
plants, based on their approximate molecular mass:
HSP90, HSP70, and a heterogeneous group with a
molecular mass in the range of 17 to 28 kDa (Table 13.2).
One in particular, HSP70, has a high degree of struc-
tural similarity—about 70 percent identical—in both
plants and animals. Another protein, ubiquitin, is also
found in all eukaryote organisms subjected to heat stress

and is considered a HSP. Ubiquitin has an important
role in marking proteins for proteolytic degradation.
HSPs are found throughout the cytoplasm as well as in
nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. As well, induc-
tion of HSPs does not require a sudden temperature
shift: they have been detected in ﬁeld-grown plants fol-
lowing more gradual temperature rises of the sort that
might be expected under normal growing conditions.
HSPs are synthesized very rapidly following an
abrupt increase in temperature; new mRNA transcripts
can be detected within 3 to 5 minutes and HSPs form
the bulk of newly synthesized protein within 30 minutes.
Within a few hours of return to normal temperature,
HSPs are no longer produced and the pattern of pro-
tein synthesis returns to normal. The speed of their
appearance suggests that HSPs might have a critical
role in protecting the cell against deleterious effects of
rapid temperature shifts. HSP70, for example, appears
to function as a molecular chaperone, or chaperonin.
Chaperonins are a class of proteins normally present in
the cell that direct the assembly of multimeric protein
aggregates. There is in the chloroplast, for example, a
Rubisco-binding protein (HSP60) that helps to assemble
the large and small subunits of Rubisco into a functional
enzyme. It has been suggested that HSP70 functions
to prevent the disassembly and denaturation of multi-
meric aggregates during heat stress. At the same time,
increased ubiquitin levels reﬂect an increased demand
for removal of proteins damaged by the heat shock.
In nature, high temperature stress is usually associ-
ated with water stress. Since both of these stresses inhibit
photosynthesis, both of these stresses will concomitantly
predispose the plant to photoinhibition. This illustrates
the interactive effects of abiotic stresses to which plants
are constantly exposed in a natural, ﬂuctuating envi-
ronment. Furthermore, exposure of plants to abiotic
stresses such as drought and temperature extremes usu-
ally increases the susceptibility of these plants to attack
by insects and plant diseases.
13.6 INSECT PESTS AND DISEASE
REPRESENT POTENTIAL
BIOTIC STRESSES
Typically, a plant challenged by insects or potentially
pathogenic microorganisms responds with changes in
the composition and physical properties of cell walls,
the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites that serve to
isolate and limit the spread of the invading pathogen.
These responses are collectively known as a hypersen-
sitive reaction.
The hypersensitive reaction is commonly activated
by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and nematodes and occurs
principally in plants outside the pathogen’s normal
speciﬁcity range. Although the hypersensitive reaction

236
Chapter 13 / Responses of Plants to Environmental Stress
is complex and can vary depending on the nature of
the causal agent, there are common features that gen-
erally apply. An early event in this sensing/signaling
pathway is the activation of defense-related genes and
synthesis of their products, pathogenesis-related (PR)
proteins. PR proteins include proteinase inhibitors that
disarm proteolytic enzymes secreted by the pathogen
and lytic enzymes such as β-1,3-glucanase and chiti-
nase that degrade microbial cell walls. Also activated
are genes that encode enzymes for the biosynthesis
of isoﬂavonoids and other phytoalexins that limit the
growth of pathogens. Lignin, callose, and suberin are
accumulated in cell walls along with hydroxyproline-rich
glycoproteins that are believed to provide structural
support to the wall. These deposits strengthen the cell
wall and render it less susceptible to attack by the
invading pathogen. Finally, the invaded cells initiate
programmed cell death, a process that results in the
formation of necrotic lesions at the infection site. Cell
necrosis isolates the pathogen, slowing both its devel-
opment and its spread throughout the plant. It is not
clear at this time to what extent these components of the
hypersensitive reaction are sequential or parallel events.
13.6.1 SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED
RESISTANCE REPRESENTS A
PLANT IMMUNE RESPONSE
Some secondary metabolites associated with the hyper-
sensitive reaction appear to constitute signal transduc-
tion pathways that prepare other cells and tissues to
resist secondary infections. Initially the hypersensitive
reaction is limited to the few cells at the point of inva-
sion, but over a period of time, ranging from hours to
days, the capacity to resist pathogens gradually becomes
distributed throughout the entire plant. In effect, the
plant reacts to the initial infection by slowly developing
a general immune capacity. This phenomenon is known
as systemic acquired resistance (SAR).
The development of SAR is still not completely
understood, but one component of the signaling path-
way appears to be salicylic acid (Figure 13.14). Salicylic

acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) is a naturally occurring
secondary metabolite with analgesic properties. Native
North Americans and Eurasians have long used willow
bark (Salix sps.), a source of the salicylic acid glyco-
side, salicin, to obtain generalized relief from aches and
pains.
The relationship between salicylic acid and resis-
tance to pathogens did not become apparent until the
early 1990s, when it was observed that both salicylic
acid and its acetyl derivative (aspirin), when applied
to tobacco plants, induced PR gene expression and
enhanced resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).
Since then, it has been shown in a variety of plants
that infection is followed by increased levels of sali-
cylic acid both locally and in distal regions of the plant
(Figure 13.15). For example, when tobacco plants are
inoculated with TMV, the salicylic acid level rises as
much as 20-fold in the inoculated leaves and 5-fold in
the noninfected leaves. Furthermore, the appearance of
PR proteins rises in parallel with salicylic acid. The rise
in salicylic acid levels usually precedes the development
of SAR. There are also a number of Arabidopsis mutants
and transgenic plants that are characterized by consti-
tutively high levels of both salicylic acid and SAR and,
consequently, enhanced resistance to pathogens.
On the other side of the coin, plants with artiﬁcially
low levels of salicylic acid generally fail to establish
SAR. For example, bacteria have a gene designated
nahG that encodes the enzyme salicylate hydroxylase.
Arabidopsis plants transformed with the nahG gene thus
contain little or no salicylic acid. Plants transformed
with the nahG gene also fail to establish SAR and
are compromised in their ability to ward off pathogen
attack. Salicylic acid levels can also be reduced by direct
inhibition of the enzyme phenylalanine-ammonia lyase
(PAL), which catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the biosynthesis
of salicylic acid. PAL-limited Arabidopsis plants lose their

salicylic acid may be converted to methylsalicylic acid
(MSA). MSA is moderately volatile and may function as
an airborne signal.

applying salicylic acid. Based on results such as these, it
is clear that salicylic acid has a signiﬁcant role in plant
defense responses. However, the mechanism whereby
salicylic acid establishes and maintains SAR is yet to be
determined.
13.6.2 JASMONATES MEDIATE INSECT
AND DISEASE RESISTANCE
On the basis of recent experiments, it appears that jas-
monates, especially jasmonic acid and its methyl ester
(methyljasmonate) (Figure 13.16), also mediate insect
and disease resistance. Jasmonates have been found to
occur throughout plants, with highest concentrations in
young, actively growing tissues. Methyljasmonate is the
principal constituent of the essential oil of Jasminium
and high concentrations of jasmonic acid have been
isolated from fungal culture ﬁltrates.
There are some similarities in the action of sal-
icylic acid and jasmonates with respect to insect and
disease resistance, but there are also some important
distinctions. In a study of two fungal resistance genes
in Arabidopsis, for example, it was found that expres-
sion of one gene was induced by salicylic acid, but not
jasmonic acid, while the second gene was induced by jas-
monic acid but not salicylic acid. Apparently there are at
least two defensive pathways, one mediated by salicylic
acid and one mediated by jasmonates. Jasmonic acid is
synthesized from the unsaturated fatty acid, linolenic
acid, which has led to the proposal that jasmonic acid
functions as a type of second messenger.
Another very interesting but somewhat complicat-
ing aspect of jasmonates is that their action is not limited
to insect and disease resistance. Through their effect on
gene expression, jasmonates modulate a number of other
physiological processes. These include seed and pollen
germination, vegetative protein storage, root develop-
ment, and tendril coiling. In most of these effects, the
jasmonates appear to work in concert with ethylene.

This breadth of jasmonate effects has led some to sug-
gest that jasmonates should be elevated to the status of
plant hormones.
13.7 THERE ARE FEATURES
COMMON TO ALL STRESSES
The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is the result of
a complex network of genetically regulated biochemi-
cal pathways. Thus, modulation of cellular homeostasis
by abiotic and biotic stresses that we have discussed
in this chapter can be detected at all levels of cellu-
lar organization—from genes to physiological function.
Thus, any stress may induce or repress speciﬁc sets
of genes or gene families through the regulation of
transcription which will reﬂect changes in protein com-
plement within the cell. Many of these proteins will
be enzymes which catalyze speciﬁc reactions and con-
sequently their presence or absence will alter cellular
physiology. Because homeostasis is a complex network
of interacting genes and biochemical pathways, differ-
ent stresses may affect common sets of genes or gene
families which is consistent with the observation that
there appears to be overlap or cross talk between sig-
nal transduction pathways involved in the physiological
response of plants to various stresses.
All stresses discussed in this chapter inhibit pho-
tosynthesis in one way or another, which may lead to
chronic photoinhibition. Since chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
(Box 13.1) can be exploited as an intrinsic probe of
the overall function of photosynthesis, chlorophyll ﬂu-
orescence is the most widely used technique in plant
stress research. Since photosynthesis is extremely sen-
sitive to environmental stress, it should not surprise us
that all abiotic and biotic stresses have a negative effect
on plant productivity and survival (Table 13.3) (also see
Chapter 12). If one assumes that the record yield rep-
resents the maximal yield under near-optimal, natural
growth conditions, then the difference between the
average yields and the record yields may be inter-
preted to indicate the average losses in yield due to
suboptimal growth conditions as consequence of the
combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses. The data
in Table 13.3 illustrate that environmental stresses have
a staggering effect on the crop yields of corn, wheat,
sorghum, and potato. The combined effects of abi-
otic and biotic stress reduces the yield of these crops
by 70 to 87%! This should be cause for concern for
regarding future world food production in the context
of climate change predictions coupled with continued
human population growth. However, plants also exhibit
an astounding capacity to acclimate to myriad environ-
mental conditions. The capacity of plants to sense and
subsequently acclimate on a short-term and long-term
basis to environmental stress is the subject of Chapter 14.

SUMMARY
The maintenance of a cellular steady-state far from
equilibrium results in an apparently stable condition
called homeostasis. Environmental modulation of
homeostasis may be deﬁned as biological stress. Plant
stress usually implies some adverse effect on the physi-
ology of a plant. Plants may respond to stress in several
ways.
Susceptible plants succumb to a stress, other plants
avoid stress by completing their life cycle during peri-
ods of relatively low stress whereas stress resistant
plants are able to tolerate a stress. Although light is
required for the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2,
too much light can inhibit photosynthesis and results
in photodamage from chronic photoinhibition. One
role of the D1 repair cycle is to overcome the effects
of photodamage to PSII reaction centers. Water stress
in natural environments usually arises due to lack of
rainfall, a condition known as drought. Thus, water
deﬁcit stress is often referred to as drought stress.
This leads to desiccation of the protoplasm and cel-
lular dysfunction. An immediate response of most
plants to water stress is stomatal closure due to low
turgor in the guard cells. Stomatal closure is triggered
by decreasing water potential in the leaf mesophyll.
The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) appears to have a
signiﬁcant role in stomatal closure. Chilling stress
refers to exposure of plants to temperatures near but
above the freezing point of water. The membranes
of chilling-sensitive plants tend to have a higher pro-
portion of unsaturated fatty acids and, consequently,
change from a ﬂuid to semicrystalline gel state at higher
temperatures than chilling-resistant plants. The upper
temperature limit for most plants is determined by a
combination of irreversible denaturation of enzymes
and problems with membrane ﬂuidity. Plants subjected
to heat stress respond by synthesizing a new family
of low-molecular-weight heat shock proteins. Plants
respond to insect damage and microbial pathogen
infection with a hypersensitive reaction. The hyper-
sensitive reaction includes changes in the composition
and increased strength of the cell wall and the forma-
tion of necrotic lesions at the site of infection. These
responses serve to isolate the potential pathogen and
prevent its development and spread through the plant.
Salicylic acid or its methyl ester may serve as a mobile
signal, participating in systemic acquired resistance, a
form of generalized immune response. Another pos-
sible signaling agent is jasmonic acid, a derivative of
the fatty acid linolenic acid. A common feature of all
stresses is that they induce or repress speciﬁc genes or
gene families and they affect photosynthesis negatively.
As a consequence, the combination of abiotic and biotic
stresses reduces plant productivity and crop yield.

Acclimation to Environmental Stress
In Chapter 13 we deﬁned stress as a negative effect
on plant homeostasis which can be measured when a
plant is exposed to a sudden change from an opti-
mal condition for growth to some suboptimal abiotic
condition such high light, low temperature, drought,
or some biotic infestation. Many stress-sensitive plants
may succumb to such a stress and die. However, in this
chapter we focus on plants that exhibit the capacity to
tolerate a particular stress over time. Such plants are
called stress resistant or stress tolerant and reﬂects
the ability of these plants to acclimate or adjust to the
stress. The capacity of a plant to acclimate is, of course,
a genetic trait. However, the speciﬁc changes brought
about in response to stress are not themselves passed on
to the next generation and thus are nonheritable. The
capacity of plants to acclimate to changing environmen-
tal conditions reﬂects their remarkable plasticity. As a
consequence, a plant’s physiology and morphology are
not static but are very dynamic and responsive to their
environment. The ability of biennial plants and winter
cultivars of cereal grains to survive over winter is an
example of acclimation to low temperature. The process
of acclimation to a stress is known as hardening and
plants that have the capacity to acclimate are commonly
referred to as hardy species. In contrast, those plants
that exhibit a minimal capacity to acclimate to a spe-
ciﬁc stress are referred to as nonhardy species. Thus,
frost-hardy plants are those that are able to acclimate
to low temperature and are able to survive the freezing
stress of winter, and drought-hardy plants are able to
survive water stress. The physiological bases of acclima-
tion to various environmental stresses will be the focus
of this chapter and will include a discussion of
•
the theoretical basis of plant acclimation and plas-
ticity as a time-nested phenomenon,
•
the role of state transitions in response to changes
in light quality,
•
the xanthophyll cycle and protection against photo-
damage,
•
the mechanisms that allow plants to survive water
limitations,
•
low temperature acclimation and freezing tolerance,
•
excitation pressure as a redox signal for retrograde
regulation of nuclear genes,
•
photosynthetic acclimation to high temperature,
and
•
the protective role of O2 as an alternative photo-
synthetic electron acceptor during acclimation.

Chapter 14 / Acclimation to Environmental Stress
14.1 PLANT ACCLIMATION
IS A TIME-DEPENDENT
PHENOMENON
As discussed in Chapter 13, a plant stress usually
reﬂects some sudden change in environmental condi-
tion. However, in stress-tolerant plant species, exposure
to a particular stress leads to acclimation to that spe-
ciﬁc stress in a time-dependent manner (Figure 14.1).
Thus, plant stress and plant acclimation are intimately
linked with each other. The stress-induced modulation
of homeostasis can be considered as the signal for the
plant to initiate processes required for the establishment
of a new homeostasis associated with the acclimated
state. Plants exhibit stress resistance or stress toler-
ance because of their genetic capacity to adjust or to
acclimate to the stress and establish a new homeostatic
state over time. Furthermore, the acclimation process in
stress-resistant species is usually reversible upon removal
of the external stress (Figure 14.1).
The establishment of homeostasis associated with
the new acclimated state is not the result of a sin-
gle physiological process but rather the result of many
physiological processes that the plant integrates over
time, that is, integrates over the acclimation period.
Plants usually integrate these physiological processes
over a short-term as well as a long-term basis. The
short-term processes involved in acclimation can be
initiated within seconds or minutes upon exposure to
a stress but may be transient in nature. That means
that although these processes can be detected very soon
after the onset of a stress, their activities also disappear
rather rapidly. As a consequence, the lifetime of these
processes is rather short (Figure 14.2, processes a, b
and c). In contrast, long-term processes are less transient
and thus usually exhibit a longer lifetime (Figure 14.2,
processes d, e and f). However, the lifetimes of these
processes overlap in time such that the short-term pro-
cesses usually constitute the initial responses to a stress
while the long-term processes are usually detected later
in the acclimation process. Such a hierarchy of short-
and long-term responses indicates that the attainment
of the acclimated state can be considered a complex,
time-nested response to a stress. Acclimation usually
involves the differential expression of speciﬁc sets of
genes associated with exposure to a particular stress.
The remarkable capacity to regulate gene expression
in response to environmental change in a time-nested
manner is the basis of plant plasticity.
14.2 ACCLIMATION IS INITIATED
BY RAPID, SHORT-TERM
RESPONSES
In this section, we will discuss examples of initial, rapid
responses to changes in light, water availability and
temperature that are part of the acclimation process.
14.2.1 STATE TRANSITIONS REGULATE
ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES
IN SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION
Optimal CO2 reduction requires an efﬁcient supply
of NADPH and ATP that would, in turn, require a
steady, balanced electron ﬂow through PSII and PSI
(Chapter 7). But if light is not saturating and the delivery
of excitation energy to PSII and PSI is not balanced,
then the rate of electron transport and, consequently,
FIGURE 14.1 A schematic relationship between
stress and acclimation. Under some optimal envi-
ronmental condition, a plant is in a homeostatic
state A as indicated by a constant rate of some
physiological process measured over time. Upon
the imposition of an external stress, the rate of
this physiological process in most cases decreases
rapidly which indicates a disruption of the home-
ostatic state A. Plants that are able to adjust to
this stress over time may establish a new physio-
logical rate that is either lower (homeostatic state
B) or higher (homeostatic state C) than the orig-
inal rate (homeostatic state A). Such plants are
capable of acclimation and are considered stress
tolerant. The plant may remain in this new home-
ostatic state B or state C through completion of
its life cycle. Alternatively, the plant may return to
the original homeostatic state A when the stress is
removed (broken lines). The black line indicates
the most probable acclimation response.

Td, Te, Tf, and Tg approximates the lifetime of each pro-
cess. The longer the arrow, the longer the lifetime. Thus,
process a is the most transient but least stable response
whereas process g is least transient but most stable physi-
ological response to the stress. Processes a to g are said to

ﬁrst, followed by the more long-term processes.
photosynthesis will be limited by the photosystem
receiving the least energy. Under natural conditions, the
amount of light driving PSII and PSI is not necessarily
balanced or consistent. For example, less energy is
required to excite P700 (171 kJ) than P680 (175 kJ).
Moreover, because of differences in the number of
antenna molecules, their absorption coefﬁcients, and a
variety of other factors that inﬂuence absorption, the
capacities of PSII and PSI to absorb light, often referred
to as their absorption cross-section (σ), are not equal.
This might be expected to place unique constraints on
the overall efﬁciency of photosynthesis. State transitions
are a short-term mechanism to regulate excitation
energy distribution between the two photosystems that
is required to maintain an efﬁcient ﬂow of electrons to
NADP+.
In addition to the inherent inequities of spectral
distribution, plants often face other situations requir-
ing rapid adjustments in the amount of energy being
fed into PSII and PSI. Plants growing in the shade
of a canopy, for example, are frequently subject to
sudden transient ﬂuctuations in ﬂuence rate, known
as sunﬂecks. A sunﬂeck is a spot of direct sunlight
impinging on the leaf through an open gap in the
canopy. Sunﬂeck lifetimes are variable, from a few sec-
onds’ duration due to wind ﬂutter up to 20 minutes
or longer under woodland canopies. Similar ﬂuctu-
ations occur when the sun suddenly reappears after
having been blocked by extensive cloud cover. In sit-
uations such as these the leaf may be subject to as
much as tenfold increases in energy that, particularly
when directed to PSII, could have severe damaging
effects.
State transitions are one of the best-understood
mechanisms for short-term regulation of energy distri-
bution and is based on reversible phosphorylation of
LHCII protein (Figure 14.3). The phosphorylation of
proteins is a ubiquitous mechanism for regulating many
aspects of gene regulation and response to environmen-
tal stimuli in all eukaryote organisms. The phosphoryla-
tion of proteins is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known
as protein kinases. Chloroplasts contain a thylakoid

FIGURE 14.3 Reversible phosphorylation of LHCII. When PSII is overexcited relative
to PSI, plastoquinol (PQH2) accumulates. A high level of plastoquinol activates a pro-
tein kinase that phosphorylates LHCII. Addition of a phosphate group weakens the
interaction between LHCII and the PSII core antenna, causing LHCII to dissociate
from PSII. The input of light to PSII is diminished and PSII slows down, thus allow-
ing PSI to oxidize excess PQH2 to plastoquinone (PQ), which, in turn, deactivates
the protein kinase. LHCII is dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase, allowing
LCHII to reform in association with PSII.

244
Chapter 14 / Acclimation to Environmental Stress
membrane-bound protein kinase capable of phospho-
rylating LHCII. The activity of this kinase is sensitive
to the redox state of the thylakoid membrane and is
activated when excess energy drives PSII, resulting in a
buildup of reduced plastoquinone (PQH2). Plants that
are exposed to conditions that result in the preferential
excitation of PSII are considered to be in state 2.
The resulting phosphorylation of LHCII increases
the negative charge of the protein, causing LHCII to
dissociate from PSII. The same negative charge also
loosens the appression of the thylakoid membranes in
the grana stacks, freeing a certain portion of LHCII to
migrate into the PSI-rich stroma thylakoids. This shifts
the balance of energy away from the PSII complexes,
which remain behind in the appressed region, in favor
of PSI. The preferential excitation of PSI is referred to
as state 1. As the plastoquinone pool becomes reoxi-
dized, due to increased PSI activity, the protein kinase is
deactivated and a protein phosphatase enzyme dephos-
phorylates the LHCII, causing it to migrate back into the
appressed region and recombine with PSII. Recently, it
has been shown that the PSI-H subunit of Arabidopsis
thaliana is required for reversible transitions between
state 1 and state 2. In Arabidopsis thaliana lacking the
PSI-H subunit due to antisense suppression of the gene
which codes for PSI-H, LHCII is unable to transfer
energy to PSI, thus impairing state transitions. The
net result of these state transitions is a very dynamic,
continuous adjustment of excitation energy distribu-
tion between PSII and PSI. This continual adjustment
of energy input in turn maintains an optimal ﬂow of
electrons through the two photosystems.
14.2.2 CAROTENOIDS SERVE A DUAL
FUNCTION: LIGHT HARVESTING
AND PHOTOPROTECTION
The pigment-protein complexes of thylakoid mem-
branes contain not only the chlorophyll pigments,
but carotenes and xanthopylls as well (Chapter 6).
The principal carotene in most higher plant species is
β-carotene, although smaller amounts of α-carotene
may
be
present
in
some
species.
The
principal
xanthophylls are lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin
(see Figure 6.11). It appears that carotenoids may
serve two principal functions in photosynthesis: light
harvesting and photoprotection. Primarily on the
basis of action spectra, it has long been believed that
the principal function of carotenoids is to transfer
absorbed light energy to chlorophyll. In this sense, the
carotenoids serve a light-harvesting function and the
energy they absorb is eventually transferred from the
light-harvesting complex to reaction centers for use in
photosynthetic electron transport for generation of ATP
and NADPH. In contrast to the light-harvesting role
of carotenoids, there is now substantial evidence that
carotenoids also play an important role in protecting
the
photosynthetic
system
from
chronic
photo-
inhibition. This is called photoprotection. During
periods
of
peak
irradiance,
plants
typically
ab-
sorb more energy than they can utilize in the reduction
of carbon dioxide, that is, they are exposed to excess
light (see Figure 13.4). Rapidly growing crops, for
example, may utilize no more than 50 percent of
absorbed
radiation,
while
other
species,
such
as
evergreens, may utilize as little as 10 percent. Any
excess absorbed energy must be dissipated. If not, the
excess absorbed energy may lead to photoinhibition of
photosynthesis (see Chapter 13). Prolonged exposure
to photoinhibitory conditions may lead subsequently
to photodamage and uncontrolled destruction of the
photosynthetic apparatus due to the accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are toxic forms
of oxygen that may lead to cell damage and ultimately
cell death.
A unique feature of O2 is that, in its ground state,
it is in a triplet state (3O2) rather than the usual singlet
state that characterizes almost all other molecules. This
prevents O2 from chemically reacting with most organic
molecules. Thus, this difference between ground state
O2 and almost all other molecules is a major deterrent to
spontaneous combustion and allows life to persist even
in an oxygen-rich environment! However, whenever
the energy absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus
exceeds the capacity to utilize that energy, there is an
increased probability that singlet excited chlorophyll
(1Chl) will be converted to triplet excited chlorophyll
(3Chl) (Chapter 6). As a consequence of such an inter-
system crossing event, triplet chlorophyll may interact
with ground state O2 and convert ground state oxygen
to singlet excited O2(1O2). This is one example of a
toxic ROS. Clearly light can be a very dangerous form
of energy, especially for oxygenic photosynthetic organ-
isms. Carotenoids present in thylakoid membranes can
compete with ground state oxygen for triplet excited
chlorophyll and prevent the formation of singlet oxy-
gen. Thus, carotenoids such as β-carotene are important
in preventing the formation of toxic reactive oxygen
species.
Formation of singlet excited O2 in chloroplasts
can also be prevented by trapping and dissipating
excess excitation energy before it reaches the reaction
center. Recent studies have established an important
link between the dissipation of excess energy nonpho-
tochemically as heat (Box 13.1) and the presence of
the xanthophyll, zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin is formed from
violaxanthin by a process known as the xanthophyll
cycle (Figure 14.4A). Violaxanthin is a diepoxide;
it contains two epoxy groups, one on each ring.
Under conditions of excess light, violaxanthin (V) is
enzymatically converted to zeaxanthin (Z) through
the removal of those two oxygens (de-epoxidation).

FIGURE 14.4 The xanthophyll cycle and photoprotection. (A) Under high light,
de-epoxidation removes the two oxygen (epoxy) groups from the rings of violax-
anthin. This is a two-step reaction with the intermediate antheraxanthin contain-
ing only one epoxy group. De-epoxidation is induced by high light, low lumenal
pH, and high levels of reduced ascorbate. Note that in zeaxanthin, the number of
carbon–carbon double bonds is increased by two relative to violaxanthin. The xan-
thophyll cycle is reversible since, under low-light conditions, zeaxanthin is converted
back to violaxanthin. (B) Violaxanthin (V) acts as a light-harvesting pigment. Violax-
anthin is able to transfer its absorbed excitation energy, via chlorophyll b (Chl b) and
chlorophyll a (Chl a) to the PSII reaction center to excite P680. (C) Under excess
light, most of the violaxanthin (V) is converted to zeaxanthin (Z), which is unable to
transfer its absorbed excitation energy to the PSII reaction center via chlorophyll b.
Zeaxanthin loses its absorbed energy as heat.

a low pH in the lumen, which is a normal consequence
of electron transport under high light conditions.
The reaction is reversed in the dark as zeaxanthin is
again enzymatically converted back to violaxanthin.
Xanthophyll cycle activity can be assessed by measuring
the de-epoxidation state (DEPS) of the cycle pool
which is a measure of the concentration of zeaxanthin
(Z) and antheraxanthin (A) relative to the total pool
(V + A + Z) (Equation 14.1).

the chloroplast through nonphotochemical quench-
ing (NPQ; Box 13.1), the precise molecular mechanism

246
Chapter 14 / Acclimation to Environmental Stress
is still disputed. Through the generation of an Ara-
bidopsis thaliana mutant named npq4, one model suggests
that the zeaxanthin produced by the xanthophyll cycle
may be bound to a speciﬁc PSII polypeptide encoded
by the PsbS gene. These observations form the basis
for the hypothesis that the xanthophyll cycle acts as a
reversible, molecular switch to regulate the capacity for
NPQ and the safe dissipation of excess absorbed. Under
low light, LHCII has abundant violaxanthin (V) whose
absorbed excitation energy is rapidly transferred to the
reaction center to excite P680 to P680* (Figure 14.4B).
However, exposure to high light rapidly converts to
violaxanthin to zeaxanthin within LHCII. Since Z can
not transfer its excitation energy to chlorophyll, Z in
the excited state decays to its ground state by losing its
excitation energy as heat. The molecular switch model
assumes that zeaxanthin (Z) absorbs light energy directly
and that NPQ is a consequence of the decay of excited
state Z to its ground state with the concomitant loss of
heat. Thus, zeaxanthin decreases the efﬁciency of energy
transfer to PSII reaction centers by acting as a direct
quencher of energy. Support for the molecular switch
model is still equivocal since the presence of PsbS still
has not been detected in the crystal structure of PSII,
and furthermore, NPQ can occur in the absence of Z.
An alternative model for the regulation of NPQ
suggests that the conversion of V to Z by the xantho-
phyll cycle regulates the aggregation state of LCHII.
In the aggregated state, the efﬁciency of energy trans-
fer from LHCII to PSII reaction centers is drastically
decreased. In this model, aggregated LHCII acts as the
energy quencher which protects PSII reaction centers
from excess excitation. This suggests that Z is indirectly
involved in quenching energy by affecting the physical
structure of LHCII. Regardless of which model is cor-
rect, it appears that the xanthophyll cycle is a ubiquitous
process for protecting the chloroplast against poten-
tially damaging effects of excess light. However, it is
interesting to note that the xanthophyll cycle is absent
in cyanobacteria. The regulation of NPQ by the xan-
thophyll cycle continues to be an intensive and exciting
area of photosynthesis research.
What are the functional consequences of a stim-
ulation of NPQ by high light? Irrespective of the
mechanism underlying photoprotection through NPQ,
the functional consequence of NPQ is a decrease in
the efﬁciency of energy transfer to PSII reaction cen-
tres. Because less energy is transferred to PSII reaction
centers per photon absorbed by LCHII under such
conditions, the efﬁciency of PSII photochemistry (P680
+ energy →P680+ + e), will decrease per photon
absorbed. Thus, the light-inducible xanthophyll cycle
protects PSII reaction centers by dissipating excess exci-
tation nonphotochemically as heat.
When

subjected
to
excess
light,
photoinhibition will occur (Chapter 13) which can
be measured as a decrease in Fv/Fm as a function
of time under high light. However, concomitantly,
exposure to light also stimulates the de-epoxidation
of the xanthophyll cycle (DEPS) and NPQ over
time (Figure 14.5A, left panel). However, when the
plants are allowed to recover from the photoinhibition
by removal from the high light condition, Fv/Fm
and DEPS rapidly recover to their original values
prior to the photoinhibition treatment (Figure 14.5A,

and DEPS to photoinhibition and recovery time
appear to be mirror images of one another. The
rapidly reversible inhibition of PSII reaction centers
that is usually a consequence of an increase in thermal
energy dissipation through NPQ is deﬁned as dynamic
photoinhibition. This reﬂects photoprotection. In
contrast, photodamage or chronic photoinhibition
is deﬁned as the slowly reversible inhibition of PSII
reaction centers that is usually a consequence of damage
to the D1 reaction center polypeptide. Thus, the time
required for the recovery of Fv/Fm from chronic
photoinhibition is much longer than that from dynamic
photoinhibition. Photodamage is only slowly reversible
because of its dependence on protein synthesis for the
D1 repair cycle (Chapter 13). The difference between
dynamic and chronic photoinhibition can also be seen
at the level of O2 evolution (Figure 14.5B). Dynamic
photoinhibition usually results in a rapidly reversible
decrease in photosynthetic efﬁciency (Chapter 13)
measured as the maximum slope of the CO2 light
response curve but not a decrease in photosynthetic
capacity measured as the maximum light saturated rate
of photosynthesis. In contrast, chronic photoinhibition
usually results in a decrease in both photosynthetic
efﬁciency and photosynthetic capacity which recover
very slowly (Figure 14.5B). Clearly, both photodamage
and photoprotection may lead to photoinhibition
of
photosynthesis
as
reﬂected
in
a
decrease
in
photosynthetic efﬁciency, albeit for different reasons.
The former causes a reduction in photosynthetic
efﬁciency due to an alteration in the antenna that
reduces the efﬁciency of resonance energy transfer to
the PSII reaction center. The latter is due to damage to
the reaction center that reduces the efﬁciency of charge
separation rather than energy transfer in the antenna.
14.2.3 OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT IS
A RESPONSE TO WATER STRESS
A pronounced response to water stress in many plants
is a decrease in osmotic potential resulting from an
accumulation of solutes (see Chapter 1 and 2). This
process is known as osmotic adjustment. While some
increase in solute concentration is expected as a result
of dehydration and decreasing cell volume, osmotic
adjustment refers speciﬁcally to a net increase in solute
concentration due to metabolic processes triggered by
stress. Osmotic adjustment generates a more negative
leaf water potential, thereby helping to maintain water
movement into the leaf and, consequently, leaf turgor.
Solutes accumulate during osmotic adjustment and
the decreases in osmotic potential due to osmotic
adjustment are relatively small, less than 1.0 MPa. Nev-
ertheless, the role of solutes in maintaining turgor at
relatively low water potentials represents a signiﬁcant
form of acclimation to water stress. Osmotic adjustment
may also play an important role in helping partially
wilted leaves to regain turgor once the water supply
recovers. By helping to maintain leaf turgor, osmotic
adjustment also enables plants to keep their stomata
open and continue taking up CO2 for photosynthe-
sis under conditions of moderate water stress. Solutes
implicated in osmotic adjustment include a range of
inorganic ions (especially K+), sugars, and amino acids
(Figure 14.6). One amino acid that appears to be partic-
ularly sensitive to stress is proline. A large number of
plants synthesize proline from glutamine in the leaves.
The role of proline is demonstrated by experiments
with tomato cells in culture. Cells subjected to water
(osmotic) stress by exposure to hyperosmotic concen-
trations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) responded with an
initial loss of turgor and rapid accumulation of proline.
As proline accumulation continued, however, turgor
gradually recovered. Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, and
betaine (N,N,N-trimethyl glycine) are other common
accumulated solutes. Most chemicals associated with
osmotic adjustment share the property that they do not
signiﬁcantly interfere with normal metabolic processes.
Such chemicals are called compatible solutes.
Although osmotic adjustment appears to be a gen-
eral response to water stress, not all species are capable
of adjusting their solute concentrations. Sugarbeet (Beta
vulgaris), on the one hand, synthesizes large quantities of
betaine and is known as an osmotic adjuster. Osmotic
adjustment in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), on the other
hand, is minimal and cowpea is known as an osmotic
nonadjuster. Cowpea instead has very sensitive stomata
and avoids desiccation by closing the stomata and main-
taining a relatively high water potential. It is interesting

to note that there is no long-term advantage of osmotic
adjustment over stomatal closure, at least with regard
to net carbon gain. While sugarbeet is able to continue
photosynthesis at lower water potentials, the advantage
over cowpea is shortlived. After one or two days, exces-
sive water loss overrides osmotic adjustment and over
the long term carbon assimilation in sugarbeet declines.
14.2.4 LOW TEMPERATURES INDUCE
LIPID UNSATURATION AND
COLD REGULATED GENES
IN COLD TOLERANT PLANTS
The study of cold tolerant, herbaceous plants such as
wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare),
alfalfa (Medicago), spinach (Spinacea oleracea), and the
model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana has enhanced
our understanding of the metabolic and molecular events
before, during, and after acclimation. This has assisted
greatly in the search for metabolic and genetic fac-
tors involved in cold tolerance. One of the immediate
responses of cold tolerant plants to low temperature is
an increase in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids
(Chapter 13) bound to lipids associated with the plasma
membrane, mitochondrial membranes as well as thy-
lakoid membranes. Various biophysical measurements
indicate that this ensures that the membrane can remain
in a more ﬂuid and less gel-like state at lower temper-
ature which enhances membrane stability and function
at these low temperatures. A change in the membrane
from the ﬂuid state to a more solid state is marked by
an abrupt change in the membrane activity. The tem-
perature at which this transition occurs is known as the
transition temperature. This means that at tempera-
tures above the transition temperature, the membrane
remains ﬂuid but becomes more solid or gel-like at
temperatures below the transition temperature. This
allows higher activity of membrane process at lower
temperatures.
Cold acclimation of herbaceous plants induces
changes in gene expression. During acclimation, there
are changes in mRNA transcription, increases in
protein synthesis, and qualitative changes in the pattern
of proteins synthesized. A major class of cold-induced
genes encode homologs of late embryogenesis active
proteins (LEA-proteins) that are synthesized late in
embryogenesis and during dehydration stress. These
polypeptides fall into a number of families based on
amino acid sequence similarities (Table 14.1). However,
these proteins encoded by cold-regulated genes share
common physical properties. (1) They are unusually
hydrophilic. (2) They remain soluble upon boiling
in dilute aqueous buffer. (3) They exhibit relatively
simple amino acid sequences that form amphipathic
α-helices. It appears that cor15a and wsc120 interact

with membranes, which enhances their stability to low
temperature as well as against freezing.
The promoter regions of certain cold-regulated
genes are activated in response to low temperature and
dehydration stress. Analyses of these promoter regions
of cold-regulated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana led to the
identiﬁcation of a DNA regulatory element called the
dehydration responsive element (DRE). The DRE has
a conserved core C-repeat sequence of CCGAC that
imparts responsiveness to low temperature and dehy-
dration. Specﬁc proteins that bind to the DRE are
called C-repeat binding f actors (CBFs). Thus, CBFs
are transcriptional activators that are involved in reg-
ulating the expression of cold-regulated genes. It is
concluded that cold acclimation is regulated by a family
of DRE-containing genes that are, in turn, induced by a
family of CBF transcriptional factors.
There is good reason to believe that ABA might be
involved in cold acclimation of herbaceous tissues. An
increase in endogenous ABA levels has been observed
during cold acclimation in several species and the
amount of increase is greater in cold-tolerant varieties
than in cold-sensitive varieties. In addition, signiﬁcant
levels of cold tolerance can be induced by the application
of ABA to intact plants, callus, and suspension cultures.
In both intact alfalfa seedlings and suspension-cultured
cells of winter rapeseed (Brassica napus), exogenous ABA
can induce up to 50 to 60 percent survival compared
with a normal cold-acclimation treatment. ABA also
induces the synthesis of new proteins. In alfalfa, some
of the induced proteins are unique to ABA treatment,
but some are common to both low-temperature and
ABA treatment. Further research is required to eluci-
date the precise role of ABA in cold acclimation and the
induction of genes associated with cold tolerance.
14.2.5 Q10 FOR PLANT RESPIRATION
VARIES AS A FUNCTION
OF TEMPERATURE
Enzymes and enzyme reactions are sensitive to temper-
ature (Chapter 8, Box 1). Enzyme reactions typically are
considered to have a Q10 of about 2, which means that
the rate of the reaction doubles for each 10◦C rise in
temperature. The rate of reaction increases with tem-
perature until an optimum is reached, beyond which

the rate usually declines sharply. The decline in enzyme
activity is normally caused by thermal denaturation as
a result of protein unfolding. It is usually assumed that
Q10 is independent of the temperature range over which
it is measured. However, this is not true for plant respira-
tion. In fact, the Q10 increases linearly upon short-term
increases in temperature from 40◦to 0◦C (Figure 14.7).
This dynamic temperature response of Q10 for respira-
tion appears to be consistent across diverse plant taxa.
Since Q10 measures the temperature-dependent change
in respiration rate, an increase in ambient temperature
will cause a greater change in rates of respiration in
plants native to cold, Arctic climates than plants native
to hotter climates. Further, other abiotic factors such as
irradiance and water deﬁcit can also inﬂuence the Q10
for plant respiration.
Why does the Q10 for plant respiration vary as a
function of short-term exposure to temperature? This
may be explained on the basis of two primary factors: (1)
the effect of temperature on the Vmax (Chapter 8, Box
1) of enzymes involved in respiratory carbon metabolism
as well as on the maximum rate of respiratory electron
transport (Chapter 10); (2) the effect of temperature on
substrate availability. Short-term exposures to low tem-
perature reduces the ﬂux of carbon through glycolysis
and the TCA cycle because low temperature will reduce
the activities of the various enzymes involved in these
pathways. In addition, low temperature will decrease
the ﬂuidity of the inner membrane, which decrease the
rate of respiratory electron transport. As a consequence,
short-term exposure to low temperature will reduce the
rates of CO2 evolution and O2 consumption. However,
at moderate to high temperatures, it is not enzyme
activity that limits the rate of reaction but rather the
availability of substrates such as ADP and ATP. At high
temperatures, mitochondrial membranes may become
leaky to protons, and therefore, reduce the capacity to
synthesize ATP by chemiosmosis (Chapter 5 and 10).
14.3 LONG-TERM ACCLIMATION
ALTERS PHENOTYPE
In this section, we will discuss speciﬁc examples of
slower, long-term responses to changes in light, water
availability and temperature that are part of the accli-
mation process that result in phenotypic alterations.
14.3.1 LIGHT REGULATES NUCLEAR
GENE EXPRESSION AND
PHOTOACCLIMATION
The process whereby adjustments are made to the struc-
ture and function of the photosynthetic apparatus in
response changes in growth irradiance is called pho-
toacclimation. One consequence of photoacclimation
is a change in pigment composition which results in
an altered visible phenotype. It is important to note
that photoacclimation requires growth and develop-
ment. For example, photoautrophs grown under high
light typically exhibit as decrease in total chlorophyll
per leaf area compared to the same plants grown at
low irradiance. Thus, the leaves of high-light plants are
usually a pale green or yellow-green compared to a dark
green phenotype of the same species grown at low light.
Functionally, high-light plants exhibit a photosynthetic
light response curve for CO2 assimilation that is distinct
from that of plants grown under low light, whether mea-
sured as net photosynthesis (Figure 14.8A) or as gross
photosynthesis (Figure 14.8 B). Typically, plants grown
under high light have a higher photosynthetic capacity,
that is, a higher light saturated rate of photosynthesis
than low-light plants. In contrast, high-light plants may
have a lower photosynthetic efﬁciency, that is, a lower
initial slope, compared to the same plants grown at low
light (Figure 14.8B).
Many green algae may exhibit an even more
dramatic change in phenotype in response to growth
at either high or low light than terrestrial plants
(Figure 14.9A). The high light phenotype illustrates
one mechanism of photoacclimation which involves
the modulation of the size and composition of the
light-harvesting complex (LHCII) of PSII coupled with
a change in Rubisco content (see Chapter 7). There is
now a consensus that the content of LHCII decreases
on a leaf area basis as the growth irradiance increases
(Figure 14.9B), which is coupled with increased xan-
thophyll cycle activity and increased photoprotection
through NPQ. Since the bulk of the chlorophyll a
and chlorophyll b is bound to LHCII (Chapter 7), a
decrease in the amount of LHCII results in a decrease

Alocasia macrorrhiza. This C3 plant was grown under
either high light (25 mol m−2 day−1) or low light (1.7 mol
m−2 day−1). (A) Light response curves for net CO2 gas
exchange. Recall (Chapter 8) that the apparent or net rate
of CO2 uptake by a leaf (AP) = the gross rate or actual
photosynthetic rate (GP)—[rate of respiration (R) + the
rate of photorespiration (PR)]. In the dark, GP = 0 and
PR = 0. In the dark gas exchange is due to respiration
and measured as CO2 evolution. Thus, in (A) the value
for net photosynthetic rate in the dark (irradiance = 0)
is a negative number indicating net CO2 evolution from
the leaf. At higher irradiance, the rate of photosynthetic
CO2 uptake exceeds both respiration and photorespi-
ration such that there is a net uptake of CO2. Rates of
light-dependent CO2 uptake are arbitrarily given positive
values whereas rates of CO2 evolution are given negative
values. Thus, gross photosynthesis (GP) represents pho-
tosynthetic CO2 uptake rates that have been corrected
for rates of respiratory CO2 evolution, that is, GP = AP
+ R +PR. In (B), gross photosynthetic rates were calcu-
lated assuming minimal contributions from photorespi-
ration. (Adapted from Pearcy, R. W. 1996. Photosynthesis:
A Comprehensive Treatise, A. S. Raghavendra (ed.), pp.
250–263. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.)
in total chlorophyll content as well as an increase in the
ratio of chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b. Functionally, this
results in a decrease in light-harvesting efﬁciency under
low, light-limiting irradiance which may be detected
as a decrease in the initial slope of the photosynthetic
light response curve in high-light plants compared to
low-light plants (Figure 14.8B). Under light-saturated
conditions, the activity of the Calvin Cycle limits the
rate of photosynthesis (Chapter 13). Thus, high-light
plants exhibit higher photosynthetic capacity because
they exhibit a higher total Rubisco content per leaf
area than the same plants grown under low light.
Furthemore, the rate of growth of plants is usually
faster under high-light than low-light conditions. This
is reﬂected in higher rates of respiration in high-light
plants than low-light plants. This is indicated by the
fact that when measuring net CO2 assimilation in the
dark (Figure 14.8A, 0 irradiance), the rate of CO2
evolution due to respiration is greater in the high-light
than low-light plants.
Experiments utilizing single cell green algal species
such as Dunaliella tertiolecta and Chlorella vulgaris
indicate that the light-dependent change in the content
of LHCII is modulated in response to the redox state of
the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (see Chapter 7). Photosyn-
thetic electron transport can be inhibited speciﬁcally at
the Cyt b6/f complex with a compound called DBMIB
(2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquin-
one) (Figure 14.9C). In the presence of this compound,
there is a net accumulation of PQH2 because, although
PSII is able to convert PQ to PQH2, PSI can not
oxidize this pool because of the chemical block at the
Cyt b6/f complex (Figure 14.9C). Thus, under these
conditions, the PQ pool remains largely reduced and
transcription of the nuclear Lhcb genes coding for the
major LHCII polypeptides is repressed. This results in
an inhibition of the biosynthesis of LHCII polypeptides,
which decreases the LHCII polypeptide content. As a
consequence, this results in a yellow phenotype typical
of high-light grown algal cells (Figure 14.9A, compare
DBMIB
and
HL).
Alternatively,
photosynthetic
electron transport can also be inhibited speciﬁcally
at PSII (Figure 14.9C) in the presence of DCMU
(3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; see Figure
7.13). Under these conditions, PSII is unable to
reduce PQ to PQH2 and PQ accumulates because
any PQH2 pool is oxidized by PSI. This produces a
green phenotype (Figure 14.9, DCMU) which mimics
low-light-grown cells (Figure 14.9A, LL).
How can we rationalize this phenotypic response to
growth under high light? Exposure to high light poten-
tially exposes plants to an imbalance in energy budget.
This energy imbalance is a consequence of the fact that
more light is absorbed than can be utilized metabolically
either through the reduction of CO2 and NO−
3 or by
the oxidation of carbon by respiration (Chapter 8, 10,
and 11). Under such conditions, the PQ pool tends to be
in a reduced state. Continued exposure to such condi-
tions can lead to chronic photoinhibition (Chapter 13)
which, if it persists over the long-term, may lead to
cell death. Energy balance can be attained under high
light by reducing the efﬁciency of light absorption
under high light. This is accomplished by producing
a smaller LHCII (Figure 14.9B) with high concen-
trations of zeaxanthin which decreases the absorption
cross section (σ) of PSII and decreases the probabil-
ity of light absorption by PSII. One consequence of

changes in LHCII content with little or no change in

CP47 and CP43) or the reaction center complex
(D1 and D2, Chapter 7). (C) A simpliﬁed model of

activity. DBMIB inhibits the Cyt b6/f complex.
this decreased efﬁciency for light absorption and energy
transfer is enhanced photoprotection and increased tol-
erance to growth conditions that typically cause photo-
inhibition.
An energy imbalance due to high light appears to
be sensed through changes in the redox state of the PQ
pool. Such an energy imbalance due to overexcitation
of PSII is called excitation pressure. Thus, the
redox state of the PQ pool appears to induce a signal
transduction pathway which regulates the expression of
the Lhcb genes present in the nucleus. The regulation
of nuclear genes by organelles such as the chloroplast
is called retrograde gene regulation (Figure 14.10).
However, retrograde regulation is not restricted to
chloroplast-nucleus interactions. Like the chloroplast,
the
mitochondrion
also
regulates
nuclear
gene
expression. This illustrates that important molecular
communication pathways exist between the chloroplast,
the mitochondrion, and the nucleus to regulate nuclear
gene expression. The chloroplast-nucleus and the
mitochondrion-nucleus signal transduction pathway(s)
remain elusive but an intensive area of research.
The
maintenance
of
cellular
energy
balance
is
called
photostasis,
which
is
dependent
upon
chloroplast-mitochondrial interactions. For example,
the mitochondrial Moc1 protein is thought to regulate
the transcription of mitochondrial genes involved
in the maintenance of the mitochondrial respiratory
electron transport. However, under high light, the
moc1 mutant, which lacks this mitochondrial protein,
is unable to up-regulate rates of respiration to match
the production of ﬁxed carbon by photosynthesis.
The block in mitochondrial electron transport slows
the rate of respiratory carbon metabolism which,
in turn, causes a feedback inhibition in the rate of
photosynthetic electron transport. This also results in
the reduction of the PQ pool in the chloroplast. This
is an excellent example of the link between chloroplast
and mitochondrial metabolism and its importance in
the regulation of cellular redox balance.

14.3.2 DOES THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
APPARATUS RESPOND TO
CHANGES IN LIGHT QUALITY?
Terrestrial plants growing in extremely shaded habitats
below the canopy of a tropical rainforest ﬂoor receive
about 1 percent or less of the photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR) (Chapter 6) incident at the canopy level.
Furthermore, the light that reaches the forest ﬂoor is
enriched in far-red and green light because the red and
blue light are absorbed by the canopy leaves of the taller
trees. Thus, acclimation to natural shade conditions
would appear to be a complex interaction of responses
to both light intensity and light quality. Acclimation
in response to light quality would involve regulation
by the plant photoreceptor, phytochrome (Chapter 22).
A major problem in past experiments to test the dif-
ferential effects of light quality versus light intensity
on acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus is the
fact that differences in light quality were not applied at
equal photon ﬂuence rates (Chapter 6). Thus, this makes
interpretations of many of these experiments equivocal.
Experiments with pea and corn where equal photon ﬂu-
ence rates of red and far-red light were used, the ratio
of chlorophyll a : chlorophyll b did not change signiﬁ-
cantly. This is consistent with the observations no major
changes in thylakoid membrane structure and compo-
sition were observed in pea and corn plants exposed to
differences in light quality of equal photon ﬂuence rates.
However, the ability to adjust the structure and com-
position of the photosynthetic apparatus in response
to light quality appears to be strongly species depen-
dent. When the shade fern, Asplenium australasicum, was
grown in red light, changes in leaf pigment composition
mimicked acclimation to high light whereas growth of
this species under blue light mimicked acclimation to
low light. These results are consistent with the fact that
shade plants grow in habitats enriched in far-red and
green light but depleted in the blue and red regions of
the visible spectrum. Furthermore, very little is known
regarding the contents of phytochrome and other pho-
toreceptors in shade adapted plants. Thus, it appears
that acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to light
quality is highly species dependent.
A dramatic example of acclimation to light qual-
ity is exhibited by cyanobacteria (Figure 14.11). Recall
that the photosynthetic apparatus of these prokaryotic
photoautrophs exhibit similarities as well as impor-
tant differences from that of their eukaryotic pho-
toautotrophic counterparts (Chapter 7). Like plants
and green algae, cyanobacteria contain both photo-
system I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) and, as a con-
sequence, are oxygenic. However, unlike these eukary-
otes, cyanobacteria use extrinsic, thylakoid membrane,
pigment-protein complexes called phycobilisomes to
harvest light energy for photosynthesis. The major pig-
ments of many cyanobacteria covalently bound to the
phycobilisomes include phycocyanin (PC) and phyco-
erythrin (PE). Cyanobacteria that accumulate PC and
PE such as Fremyella diplosiphon are capable of adjusting
the pigment composition of phycobilisomes in response
to changes in light quality. This ability to adjust to
ambient light color is called complementary chro-
matic adaptation (CCA). CCA is a consequence of a
change in the proportion of PC and PE in response to
light quality (Figure 14.11). When exposed to growth

under red light, Fremyella diplosiphon exhibits the char-
acteristic blue-green phenotype due to the fact that PC
most effectively absorbs red light. In contrast, during
growth under green light, Fremyella diplosiphon exhibits
a distinctive red phenotype because PE most effec-
tively absorbs green light. Since this acclimation process
is photoreversible, it appeared to share features that
were common to the red/far red photoreversible, phy-
tochrome response characteristic of terrestrial plants.
However, recently it has been shown that CCA is regu-
lated by both the redox state of the PQ pool as well as
by multiple, as yet unidentiﬁed, photoreceptors.
Clearly, CCA is due to changes in the expression of
genes present in the genome of a cyanobacterium to pro-
duce the different phenotypes. The reversible changes
in phenotype associated with CCA reﬂect a remarkable
plasticity ofcyanobacteria torespondtochangesinambi-
ent light color to maximize absorption of light energy
for photosynthesis and growth. Thus, this phenomenon
should be called complementary chromatic acclimation
rather than complementary chromatic adaptation.
14.3.3 ACCLIMATION TO DROUGHT
AFFECTS SHOOT–ROOT RATIO
AND LEAF AREA
One of the long-term effects of water deﬁcit is a reduc-
tion in vegetative growth. Shoot growth, and especially
the growth of leaves, is generally more sensitive than
root growth. In a study in which water was withheld
from maize (Zea mays) plants, for example, there was
a signiﬁcant reduction of leaf expansion when tissue
water potentials reached −0.45 MPa and growth was
completely inhibited at −1.00 MPa. At the same time,
normal root growth was maintained until the water
potential of the root tissues reached −0.85 MPa and
was not completely inhibited until the water potential
dropped to −1.4 MPa. Reduced leaf expansion is bene-
ﬁcial to a plant under conditions of water stress because
it leads to a smaller leaf area and reduced transpiration.
Traditionally, the effect of low water potential on cell
enlargement has been attributed to a loss of turgor in
the cells in the growing region. Plant cell enlargement
occurs when water moves in to establish full turgor
following stress relaxation in the cell wall (Chapter 16
and 17). It should not be too surprising, then, that an
early consequence of limited water supply would be
reduced growth. Thus, although the cells are able to
maintain turgor, it does not appear to be sufﬁcient to
maintain a full rate of growth based on cell enlargement.
The preceding discussion applies primarily to
shoots and leaves that are actively growing. Many
mature plants, such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum),
subjected to prolonged water stress will respond by
accelerated senescence and abscission of the older
leaves. In the case of cotton, only the youngest leaves
at the apex of the stem will remain in cases of severe
water stress. This process, sometimes referred to as leaf
area adjustment, is another mechanism for reducing
leaf area and transpiration during times of limited water
availability. So long as the buds remain viable, new
leaves will be produced when the stress is relieved.
As noted above, roots are generally less sensitive
than shoots to water stress. Apparently, osmotic adjust-
ment in roots is sufﬁcient to maintain water uptake
and growth down to much lower water potentials than
is possible in leaves. Relative root growth may actu-
ally be enhanced by low water potentials, such that the

254
Chapter 14 / Acclimation to Environmental Stress
root–shoot ratio will change in favor of the propor-
tion of roots. An increase in the root–shoot ratio as
the water supply becomes depleted is clearly advanta-
geous, as it improves the capacity of the root system to
extract more water by exploring larger volumes of soil. A
changing root–shoot ratio is accompanied by a change
in source–sink relationships with the result that a larger
proportion of photosynthate is partitioned to the roots.
Delivery of carbon to the roots can continue, however,
only to the extent that carbon supply can be maintained
by photosynthesis or mobilization of reserves stored in
the leaves. In addition, to changes in leaf area, some
plants respond to growth under water deﬁcit conditions
by reducing stomatal frequency. By reducing the num-
ber of stomates per leaf area, a plant can reduce potential
water loss due to transpiration when water is limiting
growth.
An early response to water deﬁcits is closure of
stomates to conserve water. In some plants this may
lead to low internal leaf CO2 concentrations which will
limit photosynthetic capacity. A limited photosynthetic
capacity in the presence of light can result in exposure
of plants to excess light and photoinhibition. Since
leaf O2 levels will remain higher than CO2 when leaf
stomates are closed, O2 will be preferentially consumed
through photorespiration and the action of the enzyme
Rubisco (Equation 14.1). Just as for the reduction of
CO2 (Equation 14.1), the continuous consumption of
O2 by Rubisco (Equation 14.2)
RuBP + CO2 →2PGA
(14.1)
RuBP + O2 →PGA + P-Glycolate
(14.2)
requires the continuous regeneration of RuBP by the
Calvin Cycle (Chapter 8). This requires a constant sup-
ply of NADPH and ATP generated by photosynthetic
electron transport (see Figure 13.4). The ﬁxation of one
mole of O2 through photorespiration consumes more
energy (5ATP + 3NADPH) than the ﬁxation of one
mole of CO2 (3ATP + 2NADPH). Consequently, the
photorespiratory pathway may play an important role
in maintaining photostasis when CO2 is limiting. Such
a role for photorespiration is supported by the fact
that photorespiratory mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are
more sensitive to high light under water stress.
14.3.4 COLD ACCLIMATION MIMICS
PHOTOACCLIMATION
For more than a century it has been known that the
growth of winter varieties of cold tolerant herbaceous
plant species such as rye (Secale cereale L. cv Mus-
keteer) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Kharkov)
at low temperatures results in enhanced freezing tol-
erance measured as LT50, the freezing temperature
at which 50 percent of a population of plants are
killed (Figure 14.12A). The enhanced freezing tol-
erance is strongly correlated with the expression of
cor genes. However, in addition to enhanced freezing
tolerance, cold acclimated winter varieties of wheat,
rye, barley, spinach as well as Arabidopsis thaliana also
exhibit a decreased sensitivity to photoinhibition even
though the plants were never exposed to high light
(Figure 14.12B). Thus, the decreased sensitivity to pho-
toinhibition exhibited by these cold acclimated plants
mimics photoacclimation to high light. However, in

plants grown at 5◦C (red line). Thus, cold-acclimated
plants exhibit a decreased sensitivity to photoinhibition

14.4 Freezing Tolerance in Herbaceous Species is a Complex Interaction Between Light and Low Temperature
255
these winter varieties, this is accomplished with minimal
changes in the structure and composition of LHCII.
How is this possible? Growth of cold-tolerant
winter wheat and winter rye at low temperature stim-
ulates photosynthetic capacity with minimal changes
in photosynthetic efﬁciency or in the ratios of chloro-
phyll a/chlorophyll b. This stimulation in photosyn-
thetic capacity is the result of the following. First, cold
acclimation enhances the transcription and translation
of genes encoding major regulatory enzymes of stro-
mal and cytosolic carbon metabolism such as Rubisco,
chloroplastic FBPase, cytosolic FBPase, and sucrose-P
synthase (SPS), as well as increased fructan biosynthesis
in the vacuole (Chapter 9). This results in higher total
enzyme activity and a higher ﬂux of carbon through
the sucrose biosynthetic pathway. Second, this is cou-
pled to higher rates of carbon export from the leaves
in the light due to enhanced sink activity (Chapter 9).
In contrast to short-term exposure to low temperature,
growth at low temperature stimulates rates of respiratory
carbon metabolism. Third, cold acclimation suppresses
photorespiration which also enhances net carbon gain.
Thus, subsequent exposure of these cold-acclimated
plants to increasing irradiance stimulates their photo-
synthetic capacity even further, which is translated into
increased growth rates and biomass production at low
temperature in addition to the stimulation of NPQ
via the xanthophyll cycle. Thus, these cold-acclimated
plants exhibit a resistance to photoinhibition because
of their enhanced capacity to utilize the absorbed light
for carbon metabolism, biomass production and growth
coupled with the dissipation of any excess absorbed
light through NPQ. It is important to appreciate that,
to exhibit these characteristics, cold-tolerant plants must
grow and develop at low temperatures.
Similar to cold-acclimated winter varieties of
wheat, rye, barley, spinach, as well as Arabidopsis
thaliana, cold-acclimated Chlorella vulgaris also exhibits
a decreased sensitivity to photoinhibition. However, in
contrast with these terrestrial plants, cold-acclimated
Chlorella vulgaris exhibits the same yellow-pale-green
phenotype as high-light grown cells (Figure 14.9,
HL) even though these cold-acclimated cells have
not grown under high light. It has been shown
that cold acclimation of Chlorella vulgaris mimics
photoacclimation because growth at low temperature
induces a comparable energy imbalance or excitation
pressure as growth at high light. Why does this occur?
Unlike wheat, rye, and Arabidopsis, Chlorella vulgaris
is
unable
to
up-regulate
photosynthetic
capacity
during cold acclimation when measured on a per-cell
basis. Low growth temperature reduces the rate of
intersystem electron transport as well as enzyme activity
involved in carbon metabolism without affecting light
absorption, and energy transfer from LHCII to P680
and its subsequent photooxidation to P680+. Under
these conditions, PQH2 accumulates because PSII
reduces the PQ pool faster than PSI and ultimately
CO2 assimilation can oxidize this pool. Concomitantly,
this chloroplast redox signal represses Lhcb gene
expression by retrograde regulation (Figure 14.10).
The cyanobacterium, Plectonema boryanum, also shows
a similar phenotypic response to growth at either low
temperature or high light as Chlorella vulgaris. However,
the cyanobacterium responds by decreasing the size of
its phycobilisome associated with PSII (Chapter 7).
The discussion above illustrates the remarkable
plasticity with which photoautrophs respond to energy
imbalances as a consequence of growth at either high
light or low temperature. Although low temperature
and high light cause a similar imbalance in cellular
energy budget, the response of photoautrophs to energy
imbalance or excitation pressure is species dependent.
It appears that many terrestrial cold-tolerant plants can
attain photostasis by combining an up-regulation of pho-
tosynthetic capacity and increased growth rates to utilize
absorbed light energy with photoprotection through
xanthophyll cycle activity. In contrast, many green algae
attain photostasis by reducing light-harvesting efﬁciency
by making a smaller light-harvesting complex through
retrograde regulation due to their inability to utilize
the absorbed energy through carbon metabolism and
growth.
14.4 FREEZING TOLERANCE IN
HERBACEOUS SPECIES IS A
COMPLEX INTERACTION
BETWEEN LIGHT AND LOW
TEMPERATURE
Cold acclimation and the development of maximum
freezing tolerance in overwintering herbaceous plants
such as winter wheat, winter rye, spinach, and Arabidopsis
thaliana requires active growth and development at low
temperature. As a result, leaves of these plant species
developed at low temperature are anatomically, mor-
phologically, physiologically, and biochemically distinct
from the same plants developed at warm temperatures.
For example, these herbaceous species grown at low tem-
perature exhibit a short, compact growth habit, thicker
leaves due to an increase in leaf mesophyll cell size
and/or an increase in the number of palisade cell lay-
ers, and an increase in cell cytoplasm associated with
a decrease in leaf water content. Photosynthesis con-
tinues during the cold acclimation period and provides
the necessary energy required for this low-temperature
growth, which leads to the cold-acclimated state and
maximum freezing tolerance (Equation 14.3).

As indicated in Table 14.2, exposure to low tem-
perature (5◦C) is an absolute requirement for the attain-
ment of maximum freezing tolerance in winter rye
(LT50 = −16◦C). However, low temperature by itself
is not sufﬁcient to induce maximum freezing toler-
ance since growth at low temperature but low light
reduces LT50 by 50% (Table 14.2). Thus, light is also
an absolute requirement for the attainment of maxi-
mum freezing tolerance in winter cereals (Table 14.2).
This light-dependent increase in freezing tolerance at
constant low-growth temperature occurs independently
of either photoperiod or light quality. Thus, the light
dependence of LT50 in herbaceous winter cereals does
not appear to be phytochrome-dependent. Further-
more, increasing the growth irradiance at temperatures
that normally do not induce freezing tolerance (20◦C)
results in a doubling of LT50 from −4 under low light to
−8◦C under high light, which is consistent with the light
dependence of freezing tolerance. However, high light
can not compensate for low temperature for the induc-
tion of maximum freezing tolerance in winter cereals.
Thus, the attainment of maximum freezing tolerance
appears to be the result of an additive effect of both
low-growth temperature and growth irradiance.
14.4.1 COLD ACCLIMATED PLANTS
SECRETE ANTIFREEZE
PROTEINS
Overwintering plants can tolerate freezing because of
their ability to control the freezing event itself. As long
as freezing of water is conﬁned to the apoplast, that
is the cell wall and the extracellular space, the plant
will survive. Alternatively, if freezing occurs intracel-
lularly, the plant will die. Cold acclimation in many
plants is associated with the secretion of antifreeze
proteins (AFPs) from the cytoplasm into the apoplast.
AFPs have been reported in ferns, gymnosperms, as
well as mono- and dicotyledonous angiosperms. AFPs
inhibit ice crystal growth by binding to the surface of
a growing ice crystal via hydrogen bonding between
speciﬁc hydrophilic amino acids present in the AFP and
water within the crystal lattice of ice. The presence
of AFPs in cold-tolerant plants is not constitutive but
requires exposure to low temperature and they accumu-
late in virtually all plant tissue including seeds, stems,
leaves, ﬂowers, and roots. When winter rye plants cold
acclimate, the gaseous plant hormone, ethylene, is pro-
duced. Ethylene induces the transcription of the family
of genes that encode AFPs. Upon translation, the AFPs
are secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bod-
ies, and vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane
and are deposited on the surface of the cell wall where
they inhibit ice crystal formation.
Do AFPs alter LT50? The answer is an unequivocal
no. If this is so, what is the role of AFPs? Although AFPs
have a minimal effect on LT50, AFPs have a signiﬁcant
effect on the rate of ice crystal formation. Thus, AFPs
most likely enhance winter survival by slowing the rate
of extracellular freezing.
14.4.2 NORTH TEMPERATE WOODY
PLANTS SURVIVE FREEZING
STRESS
Boreal deciduous trees, conifers, and shrubs such as
paper birch (Betula papyrifera), trembling aspen (Popu-
lus tremuloides), and willow (Salix sp.)—all found as far
north as the arctic circle—survive because they are able
to acclimate to the below-freezing winter temperatures.
During their normal growing season, these plants will
suffer injury or death if exposed to freezing tempera-
tures. Even a light frost during the spring or summer
may be lethal to plants that are actively growing. Yet,
cold-acclimated stems of these species may survive tem-
peratures as low as −196◦C (liquid nitrogen) without
apparent injury.
Acclimation of woody species to freezing stress
is a common phenomenon in nature, but the precise
mechanism by which acclimation is achieved is not
well understood. It is known that acclimation in woody
tissues occurs in two distinct stages (Figure 14.13). It
begins in the autumn when growth and photosynthesis
ceases and the plant enters dormancy. This ﬁrst stage
of acclimation is induced by short days and is thought
to be under the control of phytochrome. Acclimation at
this stage can be inhibited by long days and early frost.
Thus, in woody species, it is essential that the plant
enter the dormant stage prior to the onset of frost to
prevent freezing damage.
The second stage of acclimation is triggered by
exposure of the overwintering tissue to low tempera-
ture, corresponding to the ﬁrst frost (Figure 14.13). At
this stage, respiratory activity is sufﬁcient to provide the

energy necessary for the numerous metabolic changes
required to attain the maximum cold-acclimated state.
There are increases in the level of organic phosphates
and the conversion of starch to sugars. Glycopro-
teins accumulate and the protoplasm becomes generally
more resistant to dehydration. Fully acclimated cells
can withstand temperatures far below those normally
experienced in nature.
14.5 PLANTS ADJUST
PHOTOSYNTHETIC
CAPACITY IN RESPONSE
TO HIGH TEMPERATURE
Plants that can acclimate to high temperatures are
called thermotolerant plants. Photosynthetic capacity
measured as the maximum light-saturated rate of CO2
assimilation is sensitive to temperature (Figure 14.14).
The C3 and the C4 plant illustrated in Figure 14.14
exhibit temperature optima for photosynthesis that are
dependent upon the growth condition to which these
plants were exposed. Plants exposed to cool tempera-
tures generally exhibit a lower temperature optimum for
photosynthesis than those exposed to high temperatures.
Such a shift in temperature optima reﬂects photosyn-
thetic acclimation to temperature which has been shown

to be reversible and not due to temperature-dependent
stomatal limitations. Rather, such photosynthetic accli-
mation appears to be due to a combination of changes
in the temperature stability of thylakoid membranes as
well as the enzymes of the PCR cycle such as Rubisco.
Although photosynthetic acclimation of C3 overwin-
tering species such as wheat and rye requires growth
and development at cold temperatures, this is not the
case for all plants. For example, reversible photosyn-
thetic acclimation in the C3 species, Nerium oleander,
is observed in fully expanded, mature leaves exposed
to either high or low temperatures. This may be due,
in part, to the different absolute temperature ranges to
which a particular species can acclimate.
The maximum rate of photosynthesis of the C4
plant, T. oblongifolia, appears to be more sensitive to
leaf temperature than that of L. divaricata, a C3 plant
(Figure 14.14). However, such differential responses do
not reﬂect a general difference between C3 and C4
species. Rather, such differences have been shown to
be very species dependent within plants that exhibit
either C3 or C4 photosynthesis. Clearly, plants exhibit
extraordinary plasticity to adjust photosynthetically to
changes in temperature.

14.6 OXYGEN MAY PROTECT
DURING ACCLIMATION TO
VARIOUS STRESSES
Although the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) associ-
ated with PSII results in the light-dependent evolution
of oxygen (Chapter 7), O2 can also act as alternative
electron acceptor for photosynthetic electron transport.
Thus, photosynthetic electron transport may also con-
sume oxygen. Even under normal conditions, up to
5 percent to 10 percent of the photosynthetic electrons
that are generated by PSI may react with molecular
oxygen rather than with NADP+. This has important
functional consequences for active chloroplasts. The
photoreduction of oxygen by PSI is called the Mehler
reaction and results in the production of another toxic,
reactive oxygen species known as a superoxide radical
(O−
2 ) (a radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron).
To counteract the accumulation of this radical, photo-
synthetic organisms have evolved mechanisms to protect
themselves from excess light and the potential ravages
of O2. An effective system for the removal of super-
oxide is the ubiquitous enzyme superoxide dismutase
(SOD). SOD is found in several cellular compartments
FIGURE 14.15 Oxygen as an alternative
electron acceptor in chloroplasts. (A) The
Asada-Halliwell pathway. O2 can be pho-
toreduced by PSI directly to generate
the superoxide free radical, O−
2 (Mehler
reaction). Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
then converts this radical to hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide is
also toxic and is reduced via the chloro-
plastic enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase, to
water and ascorbate is oxidized to mon-
odehydroascorbate (MDHA). Ascorbate
(vitamin C) is regenerated through the
action of the enzyme, dehydroascorbate
reductase, through the consumption of
reduced glutathione (GSH). Oxidized glu-
tathione (GSSH) is, in turn, reduced by the
enzyme glutathione reductase, which uses
NADPH as reductant. (B) Chlororespira-
tory pathway. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase
(Ndh) present in thylakoid membranes
consumes stromal NAD(P)H and passes
the electrons (e) directly to plastoquinone
(PQ). The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX)
present in thlylakoid membranes oxidizes
plastoquinol and reduces O2 to water. The
stromal pool represents any metabolic
pathway present in the stroma that gener-
ates reducing power (see Chapter 8). Ndh
may also participate in cyclic electron trans-
port around PSI.

(14.4)
The H2O2, in turn, is reduced to water in the chloroplast
by sequential reduction with ascorbate (vitamin C), glu-
tathione, and NADPH (Figure 14.15A). It is interesting
to note that plant chloroplasts normally exhibit relatively
high concentrations of ascorbate (0.5 to 1.0 μmol mg−1
Chl in Arabidopsis thaliana), which can vary depending
on the growth conditions. Reduction of H2O2 is neces-
sary in order to prevent its reaction with O−
2 to form the
highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH·), another example
of an ROS that can rapidly damage proteins. This path-
way for the protection against ROS is known as the
Asada-Halliwell Pathway (Figure 14.15A).
In addition to the photoreduction of oxygen by PSI
through the Mehler reaction, chloroplasts, also exhibit
the capacity to reduce O2 in the dark through the chlo-
rorespiratory pathway (Figure 14.15B). Under normal
growth conditions, this chloroplastic respiratory path-
way results in the reduction of the thylakoid PQ pool in
the dark. This pathway involves an NAD(P)H dehydro-
genase (Ndh) that reduces PQ nonphotochemically by

using stromal reductants (stromal pool). However, it has
been proposed that subsequently the thylakoid-bound
plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) couples the oxidation
of plastoquinol with the reduction of O2 to water even
in the light. Recently, the gene for a plastid terminal
oxidase (PTOX) was identiﬁed in Arabidopsis thaliana
as well as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sequence of
PTOX is very similar to the alternative oxidase (AOX)
present in mitochondria (Chapter 10).
Since O2 can act as an alternative electron acceptor
for the photosynthetic electron transport chain either
through the Mehler reaction or through the chlorores-
piratory pathway, both of these processes represent
potential mechanisms to keep the PQ pool oxidized and
decrease the probability of chronic photoinhibition dur-
ing acclimation irrespective of the stress which initiates
the short-term and long-term mechanisms of acclima-
tion. However, the speciﬁc contribution of the Mehler
reaction and chlororespiration to photoprotection dur-
ing acclimation to stress appears to be both species
dependent as well as dependent upon the speciﬁc stress
to which a plant is exposed. Furthermore, irrespective
of whether the short-term or long-term mechanism of
acclimation is in response to high light, water deﬁcits,
or temperature, the maintenance of photostasis, that is
a balance in energy budget, appears to be an important
feature of the newly attained acclimated state.
SUMMARY
Stress-resistant or stress-tolerant plants exhibit the
ability to acclimate or adjust to the environmental
stress. Although speciﬁc changes in physiology brought
about by acclimation to a stress are not heritable, the
capacity of plants to acclimate reﬂects their remark-
able plasticity. Plants exhibit stress tolerance because
of their genetic capacity to acclimate and establish
a new homeostatic state over time. Since acclima-
tion represents an integrated hierarchy of short- and
long-term responses, the attainment of the new accli-
mated state is a complex, time-nested response to a
stress. Short-term mechanisms usually take place very
early in the acclimation response and include: (1) state
transitions in response to rapid changes in light quality
to balance energy distribution between PSII and PSI;
(2) the induction of the xanthophyll cycle and non-
photochemical quenching (NPQ) to photoprotect PSII
against sudden exposures to excess light and the poten-
tial for chronic photoinhibition; (3) the accumulation
of compatible solutes for cellular osmotic adjustment
to prevent water loss upon exposures to water deﬁcits
and the stimulation of photorespiration to consume
excess energy; (4) the modulation of membrane ﬂuidity
and the induction of speciﬁc cold regulated genes in
response to low-temperature acclimation.
A unique characteristic of plant respiration is
that its Q10 is not constant but varies as a function
of short-term changes in temperature. In contrast to
the short-term mechanisms that initiate acclimation
responses, the long-term mechanisms of acclimation
may result in phenotypic changes. Photoacclimation to
high light leads to a reduction in chlorophyll content
with concomitant decreases in the abundance of PSII
light-harvesting complex polypeptides and increases
in Rubisco content relative growth at low light. This
response is a consequence of retrograde regulation of
nuclear genes coding for PSII light-harvesting polypep-
tides by the redox status of the PQ pool. This response
to high light is mimicked by acclimation to low tem-
perature because both excess irradiance and low tem-
perature increase the reduction state of the PQ pool
in a similar way. This can be measured as excita-
tion pressure which is a measure of the proportion of
closed PSII reaction centers. Although photoautrophs
acclimate to light quality, the extent of such accli-
mation appears to be species dependent. The most
dramatic example of acclimation to light quality is
exhibited by many cyanobacteria through a process
called complementary chromatic adaptation. Growth
and development of winter cereals at low tempera-
ture stimulates photosynthetic and respiratory capacity
which results in an increased tolerance to photoin-
hibition. In response to growth under water deﬁcit
conditions, plants reduce shoot–root ratios and total
leaf area to reduce water loss due to transpiration. Cold
acclimation of herbaceous as well as woody plants leads
to increased freezing tolerance which is measured as
LT50. Antifreeze proteins do not affect LT50 but
control the rate of extracellular ice formation. Plants
capable of acclimating to high temperature are con-
sidered thermotolerant and exhibit the ability to shift
the temperature proﬁle for maximum photosynthetic
capacity towards high temperatures. Many plants can
utilize O2 as an alternative electron acceptor in pho-
tosynthetic electron transport during acclimation to
various stresses through either the Mehler reaction or
chlororespiration. Photostasis is the maintenance of a
balance between energy absorbed versus energy uti-
lized through metabolism and growth. The attainment
of photostasis appears to be a common feature of accli-
mation to high light, water deﬁcits, and temperature.

Adaptations to the Environment
Previously, we deﬁned stress as a negative effect on
plant homeostasis which can be measured when a plant
is exposed to a sudden change from some optimal con-
dition for growth to some suboptimal abiotic condition
such high light, high or low temperature, and water
deﬁcit. In Chapter 14, we discussed the capacity of
many C3 plants to acclimate or adjust to such stresses
over time. The myriad mechanisms available for accli-
mation at the whole plant, physiological, biochemical,
and molecular levels in response to a change in their
environment appear to be integrated in a time-nested
fashion. In Chapter 14 we discovered that the ability
of plants to acclimate to speciﬁc stresses varied as a
function of the species examined. The capacity of a
plant to acclimate reﬂects the remarkable plasticity in
the form and function of many plants. However, it is
not the speciﬁc phenotypic and physiological changes
induced during acclimation period that are passed on to
the next generation, but rather, it is the inherent ability
to change in the ﬁrst place that is heritable. Thus, plas-
ticity is the genetic trait that characterizes plants able
to tolerate environmental change during the normal life
cycle of a plant from seed germination, to vegetative
growth, to reproductive development, and ultimately
to sensescence. These latter topics are discussed in
detail in Chapters 16 to 27. In contrast to acclimation,
adaptation refers to heritable modiﬁcations in struc-
ture or function that increase the ﬁtness of the organ-
ism in a stressful environment. This means that plant
adaptation to the environment takes place over a much
longer time scale than acclimation. Since adaptation is
a consequence of natural selection, adaptation occurs
over an evolutionary time scale. Adaptation is a conse-
quence of the complement of genes found in the genome
of a plant species as a result of natural selection over the
course of many, many generations. Thus, it is possible
that some plants adapted to a very special niche may
exhibit limited plasticity to acclimate to sudden changes
in their environment.
In this chapter we will discuss

the physiology of plants adapted to low-light versus
high-light environments,
•
the role of C4 photosynthesis in adaptation of plants
to high temperature,
•
CAM photosynthesis and its relationship to adapta-
tion to desert environments, and

communities, biomes, as well as global weather

15.1 SUN AND SHADE ADAPTED
PLANTS RESPOND
DIFFERENTIALLY TO
IRRADIANCE
Shade plants adapted to growth on the ﬂoor of a tropical
rainforest not only may receive less than 1 percent of
the incident photon ﬂuence rate measured at the top of
the canopy, but are also exposed to light enriched in the
green and far-red wavelengths of the visible spectrum.
Plants are classiﬁed as either sun or shade species,
depending on the ability to acclimate to changes in
irradiance. The ability to acclimate to irradiance is an
inherited trait and is determined by species genotype
which is a consequence of many, many successive gen-
erations of natural selection to the light environment
experienced by the species in its native habitat. Obli-
gate shade plants are adapted to survive extreme shade
conditions and exhibit minimal capacity to acclimate to
high-light conditions. Generally, leaves of shade species
are thinner and exhibit higher chlorophyll contents than
those of sun species (Table 15.1). Chloroplasts of obli-
gate shade species are highly stacked with as many as 100
thylakoids per granum which occupy most of the stromal
volume whereas the number of appressed thylakoids in
a granum of sun species typically varies from 5 to 30 (see
Chapter 5). In addition to their higher chlorophyll con-
tent, shade adapted species typically exhibit lower ratios
of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b (2.0 to 2.5) compared
to sun species (3.2 to 3.6). Since chlorophyll b is associ-
ated with the light-harvesting complexes of PSI (LHCI)
and PSII (LHCII) (Chapter 7), the lower chlorophyll a:
chlorophyll b ratio is indicative of more light harvest-
ing complex present in shade adapted species than in
sun species. This may be reﬂected in a higher photo-
synthetic efﬁciency at low, light-limiting irradiance in
shade adapted species than in sun species (Figure 15.1A).
However, the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis is
generally lower in shade species (Figure 15.1A) due to
a lower Rubisco content in shade species than in sun
species. In contrast to obligate shade species, sun species

exhibit remarkable plasticity in their ability to change
light-saturated rates of photosynthesis in response to
increasing growth irradiance (Figure 15.1B). As a con-
sequence of their limited ability to acclimate to growth
irradiance, clones of Solidago virgaurea native to shaded
habitats were incapable of acclimating to high light
intensity. High light caused a reduction in both photo-
synthetic efﬁciency and photosynthetic capacity. These
results are consistent with the observation that exposure
of leaves of obligate shade plants to high light usu-
ally leads to chronic photoinhibition followed by leaf
chlorosis and ultimately to death (Chapter 13 and 14). In
contrast, sun species are less susceptible to chronic pho-
toinhibition than shade species because of their greater
capacity to convert the absorbed light into ﬁxed carbon
and prevent damage to PSII. On the other hand, obli-
gate sun plants exposed to growth under extremely low
irradiance may cause etiolation (see Chapter 5) which
may be fatal because they are growing below their
light compensation point. This is the irradiance at

which the rate of photosynthesis equals the rate of
respiration. Below the light compensation point, plants
are respiring faster than photosynthesis can assimilate
CO2. Clearly, long-term exposure to such conditions
will be fatal for a plant. Typically, shade adapted plants
exhibit lower light-compensation points than sun species
because the rate of respiration is lower in the former
than the latter.
It appears that the physiological plasticity for accli-
mation to growth irradiance varies considerably between
genotypes. The extent of this plasticity reﬂects an
adaptation to a plant’s natural habitat. Obligate shade
adaptation appears to preclude acclimation to high
light whereas obligate sun adaptation appears to pre-
clude acclimation to extreme low-light conditions. Thus,
adaptation for high photosynthetic efﬁciency under one
extreme regime appears to preclude the maintenance of
high photosynthetic efﬁciency under the other extreme.

15.2.1 THE C4 SYNDROME IS ANOTHER
BIOCHEMICAL MECHANISM TO
ASSIMILATE CO2
Plants that incorporate carbon solely through the PCR
or Calvin cycle are generally known as C3 plants because
the product of the ﬁrst carboxylation reaction cat-
alyzed by the enzyme, Rubisco (Equation 15.1), is the
three-carbon acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA)
RuBP + CO2 →2PGA
(15.1)
(Chapter 8). Certain other groups, known as C4 plants,
are distinguished by the fact that the ﬁrst product is a
four-carbon acid oxaloacetate (OAA). C4 plants also
exhibit a number of speciﬁc anatomical, physiological,
and biochemical characteristics that constitute the C4
syndrome. One particular anatomical feature charac-
teristic of most C4 leaves is the presence of two distinct
photosynthetic tissues (Figure 15.2). In C4 leaves the
vascular bundles are quite close together and each bun-
dle is surrounded by a tightly ﬁtted layer of cells called
the bundle sheath. Between the vascular bundles and
adjacent to the air spaces of the leaf are the more loosely
arranged mesophyll cells. This distinction between
mesophyll and bundle sheath photosynthetic cells, called
Kranz anatomy (see below), plays a major role in the
C4 syndrome.
C4 plants are generally of tropical or subtropical
origin representing nearly 1,500 species spread through
at least 18 different angiosperm families (3 monocots,
15 dicots). Interestingly, no one family has been found
to express the C4 syndrome exclusively—all 18 families
contain both C3 and C4 representatives. This suggests
that the C4 cycle has arisen rather recently in evolu-
tion of angiosperms and in a number of diverse taxa
at different times. Under conditions of high ﬂuence
rates and high temperature (30◦to 40◦C) the photo-
synthetic rate of C4 species may be two to three times
greater than that of C3 species. C4 plants also have a
specialized leaf anatomy comprised of mesophyll cells
and bundle-sheath cells. The anatomical arrangements
and their impact on leaf photosynthesis are explored
further in the next section. Generally, C4 plants appear
to be better equipped to withstand drought and are able
to maintain active photosynthesis under conditions of
water stress that would lead to stomatal closure and
consequent reduction of CO2 uptake by C3 species.
All of these features appear to be a consequence of
the CO2-concentrating capacity of C4 plants and the
resulting suppression of photorespiratory CO2 loss.

Chapter 15 / Adaptations to the Environment
The key to the general C4 cycle is the enzyme
phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPcase), which
catalyzes the carboxylation of phosphoenol pyruvate
(PEP) using the bicarbonate ion HCO−
3 as the sub-
strate rather than CO2 (Figure 15.3). The product of
the PEPcase reaction, the 4-carbon acid, oxaloacetate
(OAA), is moderately unstable. It is quickly reduced
to either malate or transaminated to aspartate—both of
which are more stable—and transported out of the mes-
ophyll cell into an adjacent bundle-sheath cell. Once in
the bundle-sheath cell, the C4 acid undergoes a decar-
boxylation reaction and the resulting CO2 is available
for reduction to triose sugars via the PCR cycle in the
bundle-sheath chloroplast. The C3 acid—either pyru-
vate or alanine—that remains after decarboxylation is
then transported back into the mesophyll cell. Here
the alanine or the pyruvate is converted to pyruvate.
The pyruvate is then phosphorylated by the enzyme,
pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, to regenerate the orig-
inal acceptor molecule, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)
(Figure 15.3).
There are certain similarities between the PCR
cycle and C4 metabolism. Like Rubisco, the PEP-
case carboxylation reaction is virtually irreversible and,
consequently, energetically very favorable. Reducing
potential is required at some point to remove the prod-
uct and ATP is required to regenerate the acceptor
molecule, PEP, and thus keep the reaction going. A
very signiﬁcant difference, however, is that once in the
bundle-sheath cell, the C4 acid is decarboxylated, giving
up the CO2 originally assimilated in the mesophyll cell.
This decarboxylation means that, unlike the C3 cycle,
the C4 cycle does not of itself result in any net carbon
reduction. The plant relies ultimately on the operation
of the PCR cycle in the bundle-sheath chloroplast for
the synthesis of triose phosphates.
The principal effect of the C4 cycle is that it con-
centrates CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells where the
enzymes of the PCR cycle are located. By shuttling the
CO2 in the form of organic acids it is possible to build
much higher CO2 concentrations in the bundle-sheath
cells than would be possible relying on the diffusion
of CO2 alone. Results of studies employing radiola-
beled 14CO2 have indicated the concentration of CO2
in bundle-sheath cells may reach 60 mM; about tenfold
higher than that in C3 plants. Higher CO2 concen-
trations would suppress photorespiration and support
higher rates of photosynthesis. Under optimal condi-
tions, C4 crop species can assimilate CO2 at rates two
to three times that of C3 species. All this productivity
does not, however, come free. There is an energy cost
to building the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath
cells. For every CO2 assimilated, two ATP must be
expended in the regeneration of PEP. This is in addi-
tion to the ATP and NADPH required in the PCR
cycle. Thus the net energy requirement for assimila-
tion of CO2 by the C4 cycle is ﬁve ATP and two
NADPH.

in the mesophyll cell is followed by translocation of a C4 acid to the bundle-sheath
cell where it undergoes a decarboxylation. The resulting C3 acid is returned to the
mesophyll cell to complete the cycle. The CO2 released in the decarboxylation step is
assimilated by the PCR cycle in the bundle-sheath chloroplast. The C4 cycle serves
to concentrate CO2 in the bundle-sheath cell and suppress photorespiration.

15.2.2 THE C4 SYNDROME IS USUALLY
ASSOCIATED WITH KRANZ LEAF
ANATOMY
The anatomy of a typical C4 leaf is shown in Figure 15.2.
Recall that the photosynthetic parenchyma cells in a typ-
ical C3 leaf are organized into two distinct tissues—an
upper region of tightly packed palisade cells and the
more loosely arranged spongy mesophyll cells border-
ing large air spaces (Chapter 8). The C4 leaf, on the
other hand, is generally thinner than the C3 leaf, the vas-
cular bundles are closer together, and the air spaces are
smaller. Moreover, there is only one type of mesophyll
cell, loosely arranged in the fashion of the spongy mes-
ophyll in the C3 leaf. Surrounding each vascular bundle
is a sheath of tightly packed, thick-walled cells contain-
ing large numbers of chloroplasts. Indeed, C4 plants
can often be recognized by the prominent, dark-green
veins. Because of the wreathlike conﬁguration of these
bundle-sheath cells, this arrangement is known as Kranz
anatomy (Kranz, wreath, German).
The characteristic anatomical arrangement of the
C4 leaf ensures a short diffusion path for CO2 to the
initial carboxylation site in the mesophyll cell. A short
diffusion path together with the uniform distribution of
the initial carboxylating enzyme throughout the cytosol
makes for a more efﬁcient CO2 trapping. Moreover, no
mesophyll cell is more than two or three cells distant
from a bundle-sheath cell, which no doubt facilitates the
transfer of the C4 and C3 acids. The high chloroplast
density in the bundle-sheath cell is apparently necessary
to process the high concentrations of CO2 generated
by the C4 system. Finally, the close juxtaposition of the
PCR cycle cells to the vascular tissue means that product
(i.e., sugars) can be quickly exported from the leaf when
required. Overall it is safe to conclude that the effective-
ness of the C4 system is enhanced by these anatomical
adaptations. It should be pointed out, however, that
some C3 dicots do have well-developed bundle sheaths,
although they generally have few or no chloroplasts.
Thus the presence of Kranz anatomy cannot, in itself,
be taken as evidence of the C4 syndrome.
15.2.3 THE C4 SYNDROME HAS
ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
C4 plants exhibit a number of physiological attributes
that appear to be immediate consequences of their
unique carbon metabolism. It is generally perceived that
these physiological attributes may lead to higher photo-
synthetic productivity under certain conditions and have
signiﬁcant ecological consequences. Unlike C3 plants,
photosynthesis of C4 plants is not inhibited by O2, and
they exhibit no postillumination CO2 burst and have a
very low CO2 compensation point (Table 15.2). The
CO2 compensation concentration is the ambient carbon

dioxide concentration at which the rate of CO2 uptake
(for photosynthesis) is balanced by the rate of CO2
evolution (by respiration). In a closed environment, the
CO2 compensation concentration would be the stable
CO2 concentration in the air when CO2 uptake and
evolution have come into equilibrium. For C3 plants,
the CO2 compensation point falls into the range of 20
to 100 μl CO2 per liters whereas the values for C4 plants
are in the range of 0 to 5 μl l−1.
On the basis of the above observations, it is reason-
able to conclude either that photorespiration is absent
from C4 plants or that the process is suppressed. How-
ever, although the activity of the glycolate pathway
(Chapter 8) is very low in some C4 plants (Sorghum
bicolor, for example), most C4 plants appear to have both
peroxisomes and the metabolic machinery to support
photorespiration. The weight of evidence thus favors
the conclusion that C4 plants do photorespire, but at
much reduced rates. The high level of CO2 developed in
the bundle-sheath cells would tend to suppress photores-
piration by outcompeting O2 for binding to Rubisco. In
addition, the anatomical and biochemical adaptations of
C4 leaves ensures that any CO2 that might escape the
bundle-sheath cell is trapped and reassimilated by PEP-
case in the mesophyll cells, before it has the opportunity
to escape from the leaf. Thus C4 leaves are not only
efﬁcient CO2 absorbers, but also effectively trap and
recirculate any CO2 that might be produced in the leaf.

optimum (30–45◦C) than C3 plants (20–25◦C). This
difference is due primarily to the differential stability
of the photorespiration relative to photosynthesis. At
high temperatures between 40◦and 50◦C, the rate of
photosynthesis decreases to a greater extent than the
rate of photorespiration. This is at least in part due
to the higher temperature stability of some of the C4
cycle enzymes compared to C3 enzymes. As a result,
photosynthetic efﬁciency or the quantum yield of pho-
tosynthesis in C3 plants tends to decline with increasing
leaf temperature while it remains fairly constant in C4
plants (Figure 15.4). The decline of quantum yield in C3
plants is due, in part, to decreased carboxylation activ-
ity of Rubisco at the higher temperatures. This trend
is exacerbated by changes in the relative solubility of
CO2 and O2. The solubility of gases generally declines
with increasing temperature, but the solubility of CO2 is
affected more than the solubility of O2. Consequently,
higher temperatures increasingly favor oxygenation by
Rubisco.
Another interesting feature of C4 plants is their
general low-temperature sensitivity. While there are
some cold-tolerant C4 species, most perform poorly, if
at all, at low temperature. Zea mays, for example, will
not grow at temperatures below 12◦to 15◦C. This lower
limit for growth is probably set, in part, by the enzyme
pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (Figure 15.3), which is cold
labile and experiences a substantial loss of activity below
12◦C. This would inhibit the regeneration of PEP, a
necessary substrate for PEP carboxylase (Equation 15.2).
PEP + CO2 →OAA
(15.2)
15.2.5 THE C4 SYNDROME IS
ASSOCIATED WITH WATER
STRESS
Photosynthesis in most situations is limited by avail-
able CO2 and water. In C3 plants, even moderate water
stress will initiate closure of the stomata (Chapter 13)
and reduce the available supply of CO2. The low CO2
compensation point of C4 plants means that they can
maintain higher rates of photosynthesis at lower CO2
levels. Thus C4 plants gain an advantage over C3 plants
when the stomata are partially closed to conserve water
during a period of water stress (Chapter 13). An effective
measure of this advantage is the value of the transpi-
ration ratio (TR). The transpiration ratio relates the
uptake of CO2 to the loss of water by evaporation (tran-
spiration) from the leaf. The inverse of transpiration
ratio, called water use efﬁciency (WUE), is often cited
in ecological literature.
TR = moles H2O transpired/moles CO2 assimilated
(15.3)
WUE = moles of CO2 assimilated/
moles H2O transpired
(15.4)
Transpiration ratios for C4 plants are typically in
the range of 200 to 350, while for C3 plants values
in the range of 500 to 1000 are often cited. The low
transpiration ratio for C4 plants reﬂects their capac-
ity to maintain high rates of photosynthesis while
effectively conserving water. Even under ideal condi-
tions, CO2 supply limits photosynthesis in C3 plants
to the extent that light saturation occurs at ﬂuence
rates about 25 percent of full sunlight. C4 plants,
on the other hand, never really saturate, even at full
sunlight (Figure 15.5). Even so, C4 photosynthesis
is not necessarily more efﬁcient than C3 photosyn-
thesis. At leaf temperatures below 30◦C the quan-
tum yield for C4 plants is actually lower than for
C3 plants—that is, C4 photosynthesis is less efﬁcient
(Figure 15.4). The low quantum efﬁciency of C4 plants
reﬂects an additional light requirement that can be
accounted for by the ATP required by the pyruvate,
phosphate dikinase reaction (Figure 15.3). How can the
lower photosynthetic efﬁciency of C4 plants at lower
temperatures be reconciled with their apparent higher
productivity? Recall that C4 plants are native to trop-
ical or subtropical habitats where there is usually an
abundance of light. C4 plants generally exhibit higher
light-saturated rates of photosynthesis than C3 plants,
which reﬂects a higher photosynthetic capacity (Table 15.1,
Figure 15.5) due to their higher content of compo-
nents of photosynthetic electron transport and certain

photosynthetic enzymes such as Rubisco. Thus, C4
plants can take advantage of some of the excess avail-
able light to generate the ATP needed to run the C4
cycle, concentrate the CO2, and increase net carbon
assimilation.
However, C4 plants are not competitive in all
situations. C3 plants may equal or even exceed C4 plants
in productivity under conditions of lower temperatures
and lower irradiance, and where water availability is
not limiting as generally found in temperate climates.
This differential sensitivity to environmental conditions
between C3 and C4 plants is reﬂected in the observation
that, to the frustration of homeowner and farmer alike,
many of our more aggressive weeds are C4 species.
These include crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), Russian
thistle (Salsola kali), and several species of pigweed
(Amaranthus) that often take over during the hot, dry
months in the middle of summer. Many of the more
highly productive crop species also fall within the C4
group, including sugarcane (Saccharum ofﬁcinarum),
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), and millet.
However, plant productivity is ultimately dependent
upon the growth environment. Consequently, the
adaptations in leaf anatomy coupled to the biochemistry
of CO2 assimilation that distinguish C4 plants from
C3 plants have a dramatic effect on the geographical
distribution of these species.
15.3 CRASSULACEAN ACID
METABOLISM IS AN
ADAPTATION TO DESERT
LIFE
Another CO2 concentrating mechanism biochemically
comparable to that of C4 plants is crassulacean acid
metabolism (CAM)—so named because it was origi-
nally studied most extensively in the family Crassulaceae.
This specialized pattern of photosynthesis has now been
found in some 23 different families of ﬂowering plants
(including the Cactaceae and Euphorbiaceae), one fam-
ily of ferns (the Polypodiaceae), and in the primitive
plant Welwitschia. Like C4 plants, however, most fami-
lies, with the exception of Crassulaceae and Cactaceae,
are not exclusively CAM. Most families will have C3
representatives as well and some are known to con-
tain all three photosynthetic patterns; C3, C4, and
CAM.
The unique features of CAM permit a remarkable
degree of water conservation. Individual species utiliz-
ing this pathway are thus especially adapted to survival
in extremely dry, or xerophytic, habitats. They are also,
without exception, succulent plants—characterized by
thick, ﬂeshy leaves (or, as in the cacti, photosynthetic
stems) whose cells contain large, water-ﬁlled vacuoles.
Other than succulence no particular anatomical mod-
iﬁcations appear to be required for CAM. However,
although succulence appears prerequisite for CAM, not
all succulent plants exhibit CAM.
One of the most striking features of CAM plants
is an inverted stomatal cycle—the stomata open mainly
during the nighttime hours and are usually closed during
the day. This means that CO2 uptake also occurs mainly at
night (Figure 15.6). In addition, CAM plants are char-
acterized by an accumulation of malate at night and its
subsequent depletion during daylight hours and storage
carbohydrate levels that ﬂuctuate inversely with malate
levels. Nocturnal stomatal opening supports a carboxy-
lation reaction producing C4 acids that are stored in
the large, watery vacuole (Figure 15.6). Accumulation of
the organic acids leads to a marked acidiﬁcation of these
cells at night. The acids are subsequently decarboxylated
during daylight hours and the resulting CO2 is ﬁxed by
the PCR cycle.
As in C4 plants, the enzyme PEP carboxylase
is central to CAM operation. During the night,
the immediate product, OAA, is rapidly reduced by
NAD-dependent
malate-dehydrogenase
to
malate,
which is then stored in the vacuole. During the daylight
hours, malate is retrieved from the vacuole, decarboxy-
lated (by NAD-malic enzyme in the Crassulaceae),
and the CO2 diffuses into the chloroplast where it is
converted to triose phosphates by the C3 PCR cycle.
The large amounts of PEP required to support the
carboxylation reaction appear to be derived from the
breakdown of starch and other storage glucans by
the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (Chapter 10).
The fate of C3 acid (pyruvate or PEP) resulting from
decarboxylation is uncertain, but the weight of evidence
is that it is reduced to triose phosphate, which in turn
can be converted back to glucose or starch (Figure 15.6).

15.3.1 IS CAM A VARIATION OF THE C4
SYNDROME?
CAM and C4 plants share certain similarities, but there
are signiﬁcant differences. A comparison between CAM
and the C4 cycle is unavoidable since they both use
cytoplasmic PEPcase to form C4 acids from PEP and
bicarbonate, and in both cases the acids are subse-
quently decarboxylated to provide CO2 for the PCR
cycle. However, there are two signiﬁcant differences.
The ﬁrst is that the C4 cycle requires a specialized
anatomy by which C4 carboxylation is spatially sepa-
rated from the C3 PCR cycle—in CAM both occur in
the same cells but are separated in time. Second, in CAM
there is no closed cycle of carbon intermediates as there
is in C4 plants. Instead, the PEP required as substrate
for the carboxylation reaction is derived from stored
carbohydrate. The C3 product of decarboxylation is
disposed of by a variety of metabolic paths, which no
doubt includes the resynthesis of storage carbohydrate.
Thus CAM is cyclic in time only. Since CAM occurs
in the more primitive ferns and Welwitschia whereas
the C4 cycle is found only in angiosperms, it appears
that CAM preceded C4 photosynthesis in evolutionary
time.

15.4 C4 and CAM Photosynthesis Require Precise Regulation and Temporal Integration
269
15.3.2 CAM PLANTS ARE
PARTICULARLY SUITED
TO DRY HABITATS
As mentioned above, CAM represents a particularly sig-
niﬁcant adaptation to exceptionally dry habitats. Many
CAM plants are true desert plants, growing in shallow,
sandy soils with little available water. Nocturnal open-
ing of the stomata allows for CO2 uptake during periods
when conditions leading to evaporative water loss are at
a minimum. Then, during the daylight hours when the
stomata are closed to reduce water loss, photosynthesis
can proceed by using the reservoir of stored CO2. This
interpretation is supported by the transpiration ratio for
CAM plants, in the range of 50 to 100, which is substan-
tially lower than that for either C3 or C4 plants. There is
a price to be paid, however. Rates for daily carbon assim-
ilation by CAM plants are only about one-half those of
C3 plants and one-third those of C4. CAM plants can
be expected to grow more slowly under conditions of
adequate moisture. On the other hand, CO2 uptake by
CAM plants will continue under conditions of water
stress that would cause complete cessation of photosyn-
thesis in C3 plants and severely restrict carbon uptake
by C4 plants. CAM plants enjoy the further advantage
of being able to retain and reassimilate respired CO2,
thus preventing loss of carbon and helping to maintain a
favorable dry weight through extended periods of severe
drought.
While some species, in particular the cacti, are
obligatory CAM plants, many other succulents exhibit a
facultative approach to CAM. One well-studied example
is the ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, a ﬂeshy
annual of the family Aizoaceae. Under conditions of
abundant water supply, Mesembryanthemum assimilates
carbon as a typical C3 plant—there is no signiﬁcant
uptake of CO2 at night and no diurnal variation in leaf
cell acidity. Under conditions of limited water avail-
ability or high salt concentration in the soil, CAM
metabolism is switched on. Although carbon assimi-
lation by CAM is slower than with conventional C3
photosynthesis, its higher water use efﬁciency permits
photosynthesis to continue in times of water stress and
the plant is better able to complete its reproductive
development.
15.4 C4 AND CAM
PHOTOSYNTHESIS REQUIRE
PRECISE REGULATION AND
TEMPORAL INTEGRATION
In addition to regulation of PCR cycle enzymes dis-
cussed earlier, successful operation of C4 photosynthesis
and CAM also requires regulation of starch-PEP inter-
conversions; storage and retrieval of malate, PEPcase
and Rubisco competition for CO2; and the temporal
operation of PEP carboxylation. PEPcase is a cytoplas-
mic enzyme found in virtually all cells of higher plants
where it serves a variety of important metabolic func-
tions. However, plants with the C4 and CAM modes of
photosynthesis contain speciﬁc isozymes1 with higher
activity levels than associated with C3 or nonphotosyn-
thetic cells. Based on a variety of physiological and
biochemical considerations, it appears that PEPcase
activity in C4 and CAM plants must be regulated by
light–dark transitions. In C4 plants, for example, PEP-
case activity should be high in the light in order to
maximize availability of CO2 for the PCR cycle in
the bundle-sheath cells. Although the substrate PEP
consumed in C4 photosynthesis is derived from the
bundle-sheath chloroplast, PEP is also a critical inter-
mediate in glycolysis. Glycolysis is also a cytoplasmic
metabolic sequence that represents the ﬁrst stage in
respiration.
Continued high PEPcase activity at night could
result in uncontrolled utilization of PEP and seriously
impair respiratory metabolism. In the case of CAM it is
clear that efﬁcient operation requires the carboxylation
and decarboxylation reactions—which occur within the
same cell—not be allowed to compete with each other at
the same time. In CAM, PEP carboxylase activity must
be high at night when atmospheric CO2 is available, but
should be switched off during daylight hours in order
to avoid a futile recycling of CO2 derived from malate.
Competition for CO2 is not a problem at night since
Rubisco and the PCR cycle are inoperative in the dark.
PEPcase regulation was initially studied in CAM
plants but it is now evident that PEPcase activity in C4
plants as well as CAM is subject to reversible activation
by light–dark conditions and inhibition by malate—a
form of feedback inhibition in which accumulated prod-
uct reduces the activity of the enzyme. In C4 plants,
light induces an increase in the catalytic activity of the
enzyme while at the same time reducing its sensitiv-
ity to inhibition by the product molecule, malate. This
results in a ﬁvefold increase in activity in the light when
CO2 assimilation and malate production is required to
boost CO2 levels in the bundle-sheath cells. In the case
of CAM, the situation is reversed. Enzyme extracted
during the night part of a diurnal cycle exhibits a high
afﬁnity for PEP and is relatively insensitive to inhibition
by malate. Enzyme extracted during the day has a low
afﬁnity for PEP and is more sensitive to inhibition by
malate.
1Isozymes are different species of enzyme that catalyze the
same reaction. Isozymes are frequently coded by different
genes and consequently have different protein structures.
Although they act on the same substrate, isozymes may be
tissue- or organ-speciﬁc and subject to regulation by different
chemical or environmental factors.

270
Chapter 15 / Adaptations to the Environment
Recent evidence from studies of Bryophyllum and
Kalanchoe, both CAM plants, and the C4 plants Zea
mays and Sorghum have shown that PEPcase exists in
two states; the biochemically more active form of the
enzyme is phosphorylated but the less active form is not.
From this it can be concluded that PEPcase activity is
regulated by a light-sensitive protein kinase. Evidence
for reversible activation of a protein kinase has been
obtained from both in vivo and in vitro experiments.
The reaction requires ATP and phosphorylation occurs
at a serine residue near the N-terminal end of the
enzyme molecule. Just how light activates the protein
kinase is not known at this stage, although there is some
indication that it is related to photosynthetic electron
transport. It may be that photophosphorylation supplies
the ATP required for phosphorylation of the enzyme.
It is interesting to note that light appears to have the
opposite effect in the two systems—the protein kinase
is activated by light in C4 plants but inactivated during
the day in CAM. The effect of light and darkness in
CAM plants, however, may be indirect. Studies with
Bryophyllum have indicated that CAM physiology and
the sensitivity of PEPcase to inhibition by malate in
CAM plants may be controlled by an endogenous cir-
cadian rhythm. Whatever the mechanism, spatial and
temporal coordination of C4 and C3 metabolism in C4
and CAM plants is an important area where we can
expect to see exciting advances in the future.
15.5 PLANT BIOMES REFLECT
MYRIAD PHYSIOLOGICAL
ADAPTATIONS
Physiology has an impact beyond the individual plant.
The physiology of a plant community or ecosystem
is deﬁned as ecophysiology. At an even larger scale,
biomes represent a collection of ecosystems that are
characterized by distinctive vegetation that is related to a
particular set of physical and environmental conditions.
As examples of plant communities adapted to different
environments, we will discuss two speciﬁc plant biomes:
the tropical rainforest biome and the desert biome.
15.5.1 TROPICAL RAIN FOREST BIOMES
EXHIBIT THE GREATEST PLANT
BIODIVERSITY
A tropical rainforest is a diverse and complex ecosys-
tem with a number of unique geographic and physi-
cal characteristics. All of the principal rainforest sys-
tems of the world are located between the latitudes of
23◦30′ N (Tropic of Cancer) and 23◦30′ S (Tropic of
Capricorn). The equatorial location ensures that rain-
forest vegetation is subject to both high irradiance and
high temperature. Moreover, at these latitudes seasonal
variations in both the quantity of light and photoperiod,
as well as temperature, are very small. Rainfall is very
high, with annual rainfalls of at least 1800 to 2000 mm
per year and as high as 4000 mm per year. In this pre-
vailing ever-wet tropical climate, with neither water nor
temperature limiting, the rainforests rank among the
most highly productive ecosystems in the world. Cover-
ing only about 8 percent of the global land mass, tropical
rainforests contain more than 40 percent of the world’s
biomass.
There are three principal rainforest regions world-
wide. The largest by far is located in the Amazon River
basin of northern South America and extends, in small
patches, through Central America into southern Mex-
ico. The Amazon basin rainforest itself, stretching from
the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Andean moun-
tains in the west, covers more than 4 million km2. The
second region is the African rainforest, located along
the equatorial coast of eastern Africa and extending
inland through the Congo River basin to the mountains
of east-central Africa. Third, the Malaysian rainforest
occurs in patches throughout the Malaysian Archipelago
of southeastern Asia, primarily on the islands of Sumatra,
Borneo, and New Guinea. While there are other areas,
such as along the coast of northwestern United States
and southwestern Canada, that also experience heavy
rainfalls, these are not true rainforests. These coastal
forests represent a southern extension of the northern
coniferous, or boreal, forest, which is characterized by
shorter growing seasons and persistent snow cover in
the winter.
It is generally believed that rainforests are populated
by a larger number of plant species than the rest of the
world’s ecosystems combined. At the same time, no
one species accounts for more than 10–15 percent of
the trees. There may be several hundred species per
hectare and the individuals of each species may be
widely scattered. Rainforest vegetation is dominated by
tall, broad-leaved woody evergreens that form a canopy
so dense that little light reaches the forest ﬂoor. As a
result, available light on the forest ﬂoor is very low,
limiting understory vegetation. The bulk of the canopy
is located about 30 to 50 m above the ground, although
many individuals, called emergents, may stand as high
as 45 to 70 m. Some mature trees may reach diameters
of 3 m, but most rainforest trees are relatively slender
compared with their height.
Also abundant in the rainforests are lianas, large
woody vines that entwine the trees, and epiphytes,
plants that grow on the trunks and branches of other
plants. In one report, it was found that as many as
60 percent of the trees in a Liberian rainforest carried
epiphytes, with as many as 45 to 65 species on a single
tree. Although epiphytes do grow on other plants, they
are not parasites. Epiphytes are photoautotrophs that

15.5 Plant Biomes Reﬂect Myriad Physiological Adaptations
271
grow only in the illuminated portion of the canopy. It
is believed that they obtain water either directly from
rain and/or from the humid atmosphere of the canopy.
Nutrients are obtained from atmospheric dust and the
surfaces of the plants on which they grow. Common
epiphytes include orchids, ferns, and bromeliads.
Soils of tropical rainforests typically retain very little
in the way of plant nutrients and are effectively infer-
tile. But how can a forest that grows on such a poor,
nutrient-free soil achieve such extraordinarily high lev-
els of productivity and biomass? The answer to this
question is found in the rapid and thorough recycling
of nutrients. In the moist, warm climate of the rain-
forest, litter is decomposed much more rapidly than it
is in a comparable temperate forest. Large populations
of termites, ants, fungi, and other detritivores ensure
that the litter is rapidly broken down. The high average
temperature, coupled with the absence of any cold sea-
son, allows decomposers to work with high efﬁciency
year-round. Rainforest trees also have a high capacity for
nutrient uptake. The shallow, spreading root systems of
rainforest trees form extensive mycorrhizal associations
that sweep the passing ground water clean of dissolved
nutrient ions. There is some evidence that the mycor-
rhizal fungi (Chapter 3) may also be in contact with the
decomposing litter, such that the transfer of nutrients
is immediate and direct. This means that, unlike in a
temperate forest where the soil is the principal nutri-
ent reservoir, the trees themselves represent the largest
reserve of nutrients in a rainforest. When vegetation is
shed through storm damage or natural senescence, it
is rapidly decomposed and the nutrients captured for
recycling into new growth before they have much of a
chance to enter the soil.
15.5.2 EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IS A
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
WEATHER
In any heavily vegetated region, there is to be expected
a continual cycling of water between land surfaces
(including vegetation) and the overlying atmosphere.
The overall balance of land–atmosphere water exchange
is known as the hydrologic cycle. Rainwater is returned
to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor. Depend-
ing on the amount of vegetation cover, transpiration
may be the principal source of water vapor (Chapter 2).
In a rainforest, direct evaporation of soil water appears
to be negligible, in part because of the normally heavy
canopy cover and in part because the litter on the for-
est ﬂoor may act as a mulch to reduce evaporation of
soil water. However, another signiﬁcant source of water
vapor is the direct evaporation of water intercepted
by the canopy during a rainfall (Figure 15.7). Evapo-
ration of intercepted rainwater occurs simultaneously
with transpiration and it is not possible to distinguish

between water vapors arising from the two sources. For
this reason, the term evapotranspiration is used to
identify the transfer of water vapor from vegetated land
surfaces to the atmosphere, regardless of the source of
the vapor.
Recycling of water through evapotranspiration is
clearly a signiﬁcant factor in the hydrologic cycle of
rainforests. In the case of the Amazon basin, for example,
water vapor enters the region from the Atlantic Ocean
and is driven inland by the predominantly easterly trade
winds. To this vapor is added at least an equal amount
of vapor produced by evapotranspiration as the winds
sweep across the dense forests. Vapors from these two
sources mix to form the clouds that eventually produce
rain across the basin.
The signiﬁcance of evapotranspiration is not limited
to the water economy of a group of plants or its con-
tribution of water vapor to the atmosphere. The latent
heat ﬂux (LE) that accompanies the evaporation and
condensation of water over tropical forests is an impor-
tant factor in the redistribution of energy throughout
that region of the atmosphere between ground level and
an altitude of 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 km), known as the
troposphere. The troposphere contains most of the

272
Chapter 15 / Adaptations to the Environment
moisture in the atmosphere and is therefore the region
where clouds and convection currents, or winds, are
found. Consequently, evapotranspiration has the poten-
tial to inﬂuence both local climate and weather patterns
throughout the atmosphere. The basis for this inﬂuence
is the high positive heat exchange that occurs when
water evaporates and condenses.
15.5.3 DESERT PERENNIALS ARE
ADAPTED TO REDUCE
TRANSPIRATION AND HEAT
LOAD
The word desert2 often conjures up images of an arid
region with no plants, just a hot sun over barren, shifting
sands. Most deserts do receive some precipitation and
are populated by a diverse and interesting plant life
that is uniquely adapted to extremely dry conditions.
In contrast to our usual image of a hot desert, cold
deserts also exist on Earth. The Taylor Dry Valley
in Antarctica is the coldest, most arid, barren desert
on Earth. Although no terrestrial plant life exists on
this desert, the biodiversity of microorganisms in the
perennially ice covered lakes in this area of Antarctica is
astounding.
Most deserts have one or, at most, two seasons of
predictable rainfall interspersed with extended periods
of drought. Other deserts may receive a signiﬁcant por-
tion of the total annual precipitation as episodic rainfall,
which comes as a single brief period of high-intensity
rainfall. The result is that seasonality of precipitation,
rather than mean annual rainfall values, has greater rel-
evance to the distribution of desert vegetation and their
life cycles. The most distinctive property of deserts is
not so much low precipitation per se, but that poten-
tial evapotranspiration far exceeds rainfall on an annual
basis. Because deserts typically have long periods of
cloudless weather, the solar radiation load is high and
most of what little rainfall is received is rapidly lost
through evaporation. As a result, there is very little
opportunity to store any signiﬁcant amount of moisture
in the soil.
The two principal constraints to plant survival in
a desert environment are the availability of water and
excessive heat load. Availability of nutrients, with the
possible exception of nitrogen, is not normally a problem
in desert soils. In order to cope with extended drought
interspersed with only occasional periods of light rain-
fall and high summer temperatures, desert perennials
2The term desert is an anthropocentric term referring to dry
places that are usually hot for at least a portion of the year.
Arid and semiarid are classiﬁcations based on annual rainfall.
Arid regions receive less than 250 mm of rain annually and
semiarid regions between 250 and 450 mm.
have developed numerous morphological and metabolic
adaptations that are designed either to conserve water
or to increase water-use efﬁciency and reduce heat
load. Encelia farinosa (brittlebrush) is a C3 broadleaf,
drought-deciduous shrub which withstands drought by
exploiting seasonal leaf polymorphism. In response to
winter rains, Encelia produces large, glabrous (smooth
and hairless) leaves. As the dry season approaches and
water supply becomes increasingly tenuous, Encelia pro-
duces progressively smaller, thicker leaves. In addition,
both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the smaller leaves
develop dense mats of dead, air-ﬁlled trichomes (epi-
dermal hairs). This mat of trichomes gives the leaves
a ‘‘white’’ appearance and increases the reﬂectance of
the leaf. The early ‘‘green’’ leaves reﬂect approximately
15 percent of the incident solar radiation, while the
late-season ‘‘white’’ leaves reﬂect up to 70 percent. This
represents a signiﬁcant reduction in the heat load on
the leaf, enough to reduce leaf temperature by as much
as 5 to 10◦C at midday in the summer. A reduced heat
load serves to reduce transpiration and thus improve
water-use efﬁciency. It will also help to maintain leaf
temperature in the optimum range for photosynthesis.
These morphological changes thus enable Encelia and
similar broadleaf desert species to resist drought stress
and maintain a positive net photosynthesis well into the
dry season. Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), like most
cold-desert shrubs, has a relatively high proportion of
its biomass invested in roots and probably occupies a
greater volume of soil than most of its competitors.
The high root–shoot ratio appears to be a means to
ensure efﬁcient extraction of water from the soil when
it is recharged by precipitation during the winter/spring
season.
Desert succulents such as members of the Cac-
taceae (the true cacti) and their relatives in the family
Euphorbiaceae are often viewed as the quintessential
desert plants. However, as succulents the cacti are not
true xerophytes and are actually found more commonly
in semideserts and coastal temperate deserts. The cacti
are stem-succulents: leaves have been reduced to thorns
and photosynthesis is taken over by the stem. The thick,
ﬂeshy stems are composed of very large cells that store
copious amounts of water, and stomates are few and
sunken. Another critical aspect is that they utilize cras-
sulacean acid metabolism (CAM), a carbon-assimilation
pathway that is inextricably tied to morphological suc-
culence. Cacti and other succulents appear to reach their
greatest development in the Sonoran, where they make
use of the bimodal rainfall regime in order to main-
tain their tissue water charge. The Sonoran desert, for

most cacti are oriented vertically rather than horizon-
tally. Such stems are thus designed not only to conserve
water but also to minimize heat load. An elongated, or
columnar, shape presents a minimum surface area to the
sun when it is overhead during midday.
15.5.4 DESERT ANNUALS ARE
EPHEMERAL
Annual plants are well represented in desert and semi-
arid regions. What perennials there are tend to be
deep-rooted but widely spaced, so that they provide
relatively little competition for annual species. Desert
annuals are not xerophytic, but survive arid and semiarid
conditions as dormant seed. Unlike perennials, which
rely on physiological and morphological adaptations
to help them survive periods of drought, desert annu-
als must germinate, establish their entire biomass, and
set seed each season. Their entire life cycle must be
completed during periods of adequate moisture and,
because those wet period may be relatively short, these
annuals are often referred to as ephemerals. Not sur-
prisingly, the life cycle of desert annuals is keyed to
seasonal distribution of precipitation. Where precip-
itation falls predominantly in the winter, the annual
ﬂora is active in the winter and early spring. In regions
experiencing predominantly summer rains, the annual
ﬂora is predominantly summer-active. In those regions
of the Sonoran Desert that experience bimodal precip-
itation, there are distinct winter- and summer-active
annual ﬂora. Desert winter annuals tend to exhibit C3
photosynthesis, reﬂecting the fact that winter/spring
temperatures are lower and moisture is generally avail-
able over a longer period of time. Summer annuals,
on the other hand, tend to be C4 species, reﬂecting
the advantages offered by higher water-use efﬁciency in
view of the short-lived water availability from summer
rains.
The key to survival of desert annuals is a relatively
rapid life cycle. Their seeds, able to survive in the soil
through extended periods of drought, will quickly ger-
minate when adequate water is available during the
normal wet season. Desert annuals characteristically
exhibit high growth rates, which allows them to reach
maturity, ﬂower, and set seed within the relatively brief
period of time that moisture is available. High growth
rates are supported by at least three factors: a high
shoot–root ratio, high stomatal conductance (support-
ing rapid CO2 uptake), and high photosynthesis rates.
An example is Cammisonia claviformis, a Mojave Desert
winter annual with relatively large leaves. Its roots are
shallow, which allows them to absorb more efﬁciently
light rainfall and drippings from nighttime condensa-
tion. Leaves tend to be amphistomatic (i.e., stomata are
found on both surfaces), which, accompanied by a high
stomatal conductance, supports a high rate of carbon
dioxide uptake.
This chapter has indicated that the inherent plas-
ticity of plants is reﬂected in the myriad adaptations
to speciﬁc and, at times, extreme environments to
which plant communities are exposed. The adaptations
discussed not only have a signiﬁcant impact on the bio-
diversity and geographical distribution of plant biomes
but also inﬂuence local weather patterns.
SUMMARY
The physiological plasticity for acclimation to growth
irradiance varies considerably between genotypes.
Obligate shade adaptation appears to preclude accli-
mation to high light whereas obligate sun adaptation
appears to preclude acclimation to extreme low light
conditions. Plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway
are adapted to hot, dry climates. C4 species evolved a
mechanism for avoiding the impact of photorespiratory
carbon dioxide loss by concentrating carbon dioxide
in the carbon-ﬁxing cells. C4 plants exhibit a division
of labor between mesophyll cells, which pick up car-
bon dioxide from the ambient air, and bundle-sheath
cells, which contain the PCR cycle and actually ﬁx
carbon. Mesophyll cells contain the enzyme PEP
carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of phos-
phoenolpyruvate. The product C4 acid is transported
into the bundle-sheath cell. There it is decarboxylated
and the resulting carbon dioxide is ﬁxed via the PCR
cycle. C4 plants have a very low carbon dioxide com-
pensation concentration and low transpiration ratio.
This means C4 plants are able to maintain higher rates
of photosynthesis at lower carbon dioxide levels, even
when the stomata are partially closed to conserve water
during periods of water stress. Plants that exhibit cras-
sulacean acid metabolism (CAM) are adapted to hot,
desert conditions. CAM plants maintain higher rates
of photosynthesis in habitats with minimal access to
water. CAM plants exhibit an inverted stomatal cycle,
opening for carbon dioxide uptake at night (when water
stress is lower) and closing during the day (when water
stress is high). The carbon dioxide is stored as organic
acids, again through the action of PEP carboxylase.
Decarboxylation during the day furnishes the necessary
carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The water use efﬁ-
ciency of CAM is higher than that of C4 plants which,
in turn, is higher than that of C3 plants. The differ-
ence in water use efﬁciency is an important factor that
determines the geographical distribution of C3, C4 and
CAM plants.
Plant biomes reﬂect myriad adaptations of plant
communities to speciﬁc environments. Although
the soils of tropical rainforests are extremely poor
in nutrients, these biomes exhibit the greatest

274
Chapter 15 / Adaptations to the Environment
plant biodiversity. Since water is not limiting in
rainforest biomes, the extent of evapotranspiration
from tropical rainforest biomes is so signiﬁcant
that it affects weather patterns. Desert perennials
are adapted to maximize photosynthesis but at the
same time minimize heat load and water loss under
arid conditions. They exhibit rather slow rates of
vegetative growth. In contrast to desert perennials,
desert annuals are ephemeral. They exploit short,
episodic rainfall to germinate, grow rapidly, sene-
scence, and produce seed to survive the next dry spell.

Development: An Overview
The development of a mature plant from a single fertil-
ized egg follows a precise and highly ordered succession
of events. The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, divides,
grows, and differentiates into increasingly complex tis-
sues and organs. In the end, these events give rise to
the complex organization of a mature plant that ﬂowers,
bears fruit, senesces, and eventually dies. These events,
along with their underlying genetic programs and bio-
chemistry, and the many other factors that contribute to
an orderly progression through the life cycle, constitute
development. Understanding development is one of the
major goals of plant biologists and looking for changes
in the pattern of development is one way to enhance
that understanding
In this chapter we highlight major stages in plant
development, including
•
the meaning of the terms growth, differentiation,
and development,
•
the nature of plant meristems,
•
the development, maturation, and germination of
seeds,
•
the pattern of development from embryo to adult,
and
•
senescence and programmed cell death.
16.1 GROWTH,
DIFFERENTIATION,
AND DEVELOPMENT
Three terms routinely used to describe various changes
that a plant undergoes during its life cycle are growth,
differentiation, and development. The chapters that
follow focus on factors that regulate growth, differenti-
ation, and development, so it is necessary to clarify how
these three terms are used.
16.1.1 DEVELOPMENT IS
THE SUM OF GROWTH
AND DIFFERENTIATION
Development is an umbrella term, referring to the
sum of all of the changes that a cell, tissue, organ,
or organism goes through in its life cycle. Development
is most visibly manifested as changes in the form of an
organ or organism, such as the transition from embryo
to seedling, from a leaf primordium to a fully expanded
leaf, or from the production of vegetative organs to the
production of ﬂoral structures.

Chapter 16 / Development: An Overview
16.1.2 GROWTH IS AN IRREVERSIBLE
INCREASE IN SIZE
Growth is a quantitative term, related only to changes in
size and mass. For cells, growth is simply an irreversible
increase in volume. For tissues and organs, growth
normally reﬂects an increase in both cell number and
cell size.
Growth can be assessed by a variety of quantitative
measures. Growth of cells such as bacteria or algae
in culture, for example, is commonly measured as the
fresh weight or packed cell volume in a centrifuge tube.
For the angiosperms and other so-called higher plants,
however, fresh weight is not always a reliable measure.
Most plant tissues are approximately 80 percent water,
but water content is highly variable and fresh weight will
ﬂuctuate widely with changes in ambient moisture and
the water status of the plant. Dry weight, determined
after drying the material to a constant weight, is a
measure of the amount of protoplasm or dry matter
(i.e., everything but the water). Dry weight is used
more often than fresh weight, but even dry weight
can be misleading as a measure of growth in certain
situations. Consider the example of a pea seed that is
germinated in darkness. In darkness, the embryo in the
seed will begin to grow and produce a shoot axis that may
reach 10 to 12 inches in length. Although we intuitively
sense that considerable growth has occurred, the total
dry weight of the seedling plus the seed will actually
decrease compared with the dry weight of the seed
alone prior to germination. The dry weight decreases
in this case because some of the carbon stored in the
respiring seed is lost as carbon dioxide. In the light,
this lost carbon would be replaced and even augmented
by photosynthesis but photosynthesis doesn’t operate
in darkness. In a situation such as this, either fresh
weight or the length of the seedling axis would be a
better measure of growth. Length, and perhaps width,
would also be suitable measures for an expanding leaf.
Length and width would not only provide a measure
of the amount of growth, but a length-to-width ratio
would also provide information about the pattern of leaf
growth.
It should be obvious that many parameters could be
invoked to measure growth, dependent to some extent
on the needs of the observer. Whatever the measure,
however, all attempts to quantify growth reﬂect a fun-
damental understanding that growth is an irreversible
increase in volume or size.
While cell division and cell enlargement normally
go hand-in-hand, it is important to keep in mind that
they are separate events; growth can occur without cell
division and cell division can occur without growth.
For example, cell division is normally completed very
early in the development of grass coleoptiles and the
substantial elongation of the organ that follows is due
almost entirely to cell enlargement. Years ago, it was
shown that wheat (Triticum sp.) seeds could be made to
germinate even after having been irradiated with gamma
radiation sufﬁcient to block both DNA synthesis and
cell division. The result was a small seedling produced
by cell enlargement alone. Such seedlings generally did
not survive more than two or three weeks but, except
for having abnormally large cells, their morphology was
more or less normal. On the other hand, cell division
can also proceed without cell enlargement. During
the early stages of embryo development in ﬂowers, for
example, a portion of the embryo sac goes through
a stage in which cell division continues to produce a
larger number of increasingly smaller cells, with no
overall increase in the size of the embryo sac.
16.1.3 DIFFERENTIATION REFERS
TO QUALITATIVE CHANGES
THAT NORMALLY ACCOMPANY
GROWTH
Differentiation refers to differences, other than size,
that arise among cells, tissues, and organs. Differen-
tiation occurs when cells assume different anatomical
characteristics and functions, or form patterns. Differen-
tiation begins in the earliest stages of development, such
as, when division of the zygote gives rise to cells that are
destined to become either root or shoot. Later, unspe-
cialized parenchyma cells may differentiate into more
specialized cells such as xylem vessels or phloem sieve
tubes, each with a distinct morphology and unique func-
tion. Differentiation does not lend itself easily to quan-
titative interpretation but may be described as a series
of qualitative, rather than quantitative, changes. Finally,
although growth and differentiation are normally con-
current events, examples abound of growth without
differentiation and differentiation without growth.
Differentiation is a two-way street and is not deter-
mined so much by cell lineage as by cell position with
respect to neighboring cells. Thus, even though some
plant cells may appear to be highly differentiated or
specialized, they may often be stimulated to revert
to a more embryonic form. For example, cells iso-
lated from the center of a tobacco stem or a soybean
cotyledon and cultured on an artiﬁcial medium may be
stimulated to reinitiate cell division, to grow as undif-
ferentiated callus tissue, and eventually to give rise to
a new plant (Figure 16.1). It is as though the cells
have been genetically reprogrammed, allowing them to
reverse the differentiation process and to differentiate
along a new and different path. This ability of dif-
ferentiated cells to revert to the embryonic state and
form new patterns without an intervening reproduc-
tive stage is called totipotency. Most living plant cells
are totipotent—something akin to mammalian stem
cells—and retain a complete genetic program even
though not all of the information is used by the cell

16.2 Meristems are Centers of Plant Growth

of pith tissue from the center of a tobacco stem was
explanted onto a medium containing mineral salts, vita-
mins, sucrose, and hormones. The tissue proliferated as

be eventually planted into soil and will produce a mature
tobacco plant.
at any given time. In this sense, development does not
reﬂect a progressive loss of genetic information, only
the selective use of that information in order to achieve
particular developmental ends.
Not all cells are totipotent. Highly specialized cells
whose development has been locked in, such as by excep-
tionally thick and rigid secondary cell walls or severely
modiﬁed protoplasts, are not capable of renewed differ-
entiation. On the other hand, it is probable that all tissues
contain at least some potentially totipotent cells—cells
that have the morphogenetic potential of a zygote. Plant
development proceeds in an orderly fashion because that
potential is carefully limited. When those limitations are
removed, totipotent cells simply revert to the zygotic
state and begin the developmental program anew.
There is increasing evidence that the genetic pro-
gram being read in a particular cell may also depend
on the position of that cell with respect to other cells
and tissues and the inputs it receives from its neighbors.
The position of a cell determines its interaction with its
neighbors as well as its relationship to nutrient and hor-
mone gradients. The importance of position has recently
been demonstrated in a study of young Arabidopsis roots.
Arabidopsis roots lend themselves well to this kind of
study because of their relatively simple structure. The
root tip is comprised of a single layer each of epidermis,
cortex, endodermis, and pericycle surrounding a vascu-
lar bundle. This simpliﬁed organization makes it easier
to track individual cells than is possible in more complex
roots with multiple cell layers. Root cells were labeled
with marker genes that were expressed differently in
vascular and root cap cells and then a laser microscope
was used to surgically remove cells in a region adjacent
to the root cap called the quiescent center. The dead
cells were displaced toward the root tip and replaced by
daughters of adjacent vascular cells. In their new posi-
tion, the former vascular cells expressed the root cap
marker. This is a strong indication that the reading of
the genetic program in a cell is at least to some extent
determined by positional information rather than cell
lineage.
16.2 MERISTEMS ARE CENTERS
OF PLANT GROWTH
Unlike animals, which are characterized by a general-
ized growth pattern, plant growth is limited to discrete
regions where the cells retain the capacity for contin-
ued cell division. These regions are called meristems
(Gk. merizeim, to divide). Two such regions are the
apical meristems located at the tips of roots and stems.
These regions of active cell division are responsible for
primary growth, or the increase in the length of roots
and stems.
The tip of the root is covered by a root cap, which
provides mechanical protection for the meristem as
the root grows through the abrasive soil medium. The
root cap also secretes polysaccharides, which form a
mucilaginous matrix called mucigel. Mucigel lubricates
the root tip as it moves through the soil. The root
cap along with its coating of mucigel is also involved
in perception of gravity by roots (Chapter 23). The
root apical meristem (RAM) is a cluster of dividing
cells located at the tip of the root just behind the root
cap (Figure 16.2). Each time a cell in the meristem
divides, one of the two daughter cells will be retained
to continue cell division while the second daughter cell
proceeds to elongate, thus increasing the length of the
root and pushing the root tip through the soil. In the
center of the meristem is a region of slowly dividing cells
called the quiescent zone. Cell divisions responsible for
new tissues in the elongation root and regeneration of
the root cap take place around the periphery of the
quiescent zone.
The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is structurally
more complex than the root apical meristem. This is
understandable because in addition to producing new
cells that elongate and extend the length of the axis of
the shoot, the shoot apical meristem must also form
primordia that give rise to lateral organs such as leaves,
branches, and ﬂoral parts. At the same time it must
perpetuate itself by maintaining a small population of
undifferentiated, dividing cells. Similar to the root apical
meristem, each time a cell divides in the SAM, one
daughter cell is left behind to elongate and move the
shoot apex forward while the other daughter cell remains
within the meristem to continue dividing.
The meristem of a typical dicot shoot is a small,
shiny dome that can be seen in detail with the aid of
an electron microscope (Figure 16.3). A microscopic

examination of a typical SAM reveals that the cells of
the meristem are usually organized into two distinct
regions. Cells in the outermost two to four layers,
called the tunica, undergo only anticlinal divisions, or
divisions perpendicular to the surface of the meristem.
The tunica thus contributes only to surface growth and
its products contribute to the peripheral tissues of the
stem. Underlying the tunica is the corpus, a body of
cells that divide in various planes and contribute to the
bulk of the shoot.
One of the ongoing mysteries of plant development
is why and how leaves and branches form where they
do. Part of the reason for this uncertainty is that a lot
of things happen at the apex in rapid succession and
it is difﬁcult to separate these various events. Newer
methods for the study of gene expression in situ,
however, are beginning to provide some insights as to
which genes appear to be turned on and which genes
are turned off when the lateral appendages begin to
develop (see Chapter 20).
Leaves form as small swellings or primordia on the
lateral ﬂanks of the meristem. In some plants a pair
of leaf primordia will arise on opposite sides of the
meristem with successive pairs arising at 90 degrees to
the last. In other plants, the leaf primordia arise in a
spiral pattern. The points at which the leaf primordia
form are referred to as nodes. In its early stages, the leaf
primordium develops as a peg-like extension. As a leaf
primordium elongates, however, marginal meristems
develop on opposite sides of the primordium, leading

to lateral growth that gives rise to the typical ﬂattened
blade. As each leaf primordium forms, a bud primordium
is also formed in the axil where the leaf joins the stem.
These axillary buds will eventually give rise to branches.
While all this has been going on, cells in the regions
between successive leaves, or the internodes, continue
to divide and elongate, thereby increasing the length of
the stem.
Tissues that are derived directly from the root
and shoot apical meristems are called primary tissues.
The stems and roots of woody plants, however, grow
in diameter as well. An increase in diameter results
from the activity of a meristem called the vascular
cambium. Tissues laid down by the vascular cambium
are called secondary tissues, so the vascular cambium is
responsible for secondary growth. The primary tissue
of roots and shoots contains a central core of vascular,
or conducting, elements. Characteristically, the xylem
lies toward the center of the vascular core and the
phloem lies at the outer edge of the core (Figure 16.4).
The vascular cambium develops between the xylem and
phloem and produces new xylem toward the inside and
new phloem toward the outside. Because of its heavy
cell walls and eventual ligniﬁcation, xylem is a rigid and
long-lasting tissue that eventually occupies the bulk of
most woody stems or trunks. Phloem is a more fragile
tissue and with each year’s new growth the previous
year’s cells tend to be pushed outward and crushed. As
a result, the xylem continues to transport water and
minerals for several years, but a large tree seldom has
more than one year’s worth of functioning phloem.

to the inside and new, or secondary, phloem cells to the
outside (arrows). This is repeated annually to add girth
to the stem. The secondary xylem develops heavy, lig-
niﬁed walls and becomes the woody tissue of the stem.
The phloem is a soft tissue and each year’s new growth
crushes the previous year’s phloem. When you peel the
‘‘bark’’ off a young stem, the vascular cambium is where
the tissues separate.
16.3 SEED DEVELOPMENT
AND GERMINATION
The life of an individual plant begins when an egg
nucleus in the maternal organs of a ﬂower is fertilized
by a sperm nucleus to form a zygote. Growth and
differentiation of the zygote produces an embryo con-
tained within a protective structure called a seed. Under
appropriate conditions, the embryo within the seed will
renew its growth and will continue to develop into a
mature plant.
16.3.1 SEEDS ARE FORMED
IN THE FLOWER
Flowers appear to vary enormously in structure, yet all
ﬂowers follow the same basic plan. A generic ﬂower
consists of four whorls or circles. The two outermost
whorls—the sepals and petals—are vegetative struc-
tures; and the two innermost—the stamens and pistil—
are the male and female reproductive structures, respec-
tively. At the base of the pistil, or female structure, is the
ovary, which contains one or more ovules (Figure 16.5).
Within each ovule, a single large diploid cell, called
the megaspore mother cell, undergoes mitosis to pro-
duce four megaspore cells. Only one megaspore cell
survives and that cell undergoes meiotic division to
produce an embryo sac with eight haploid nuclei. Sub-
sequent cell division produces a mature embryo sac in
which the eight nuclei are segregated into seven cells
(Figure 16.6). One of those cells is the egg. Another is
the large central cell containing two polar nuclei.
The male structures, or stamens, surround the pistil
and consist of an anther perched on a stalk, or ﬁlament.

or inconspicuous and the petals are brightly colored.
In some ﬂowers, the sepals and petals may both be col-
ored. Pollen, containing the sperm nucleus, is produced
in the anthers of the stamens. The female egg cells are
produced in the ovary at the base of the pistil. Pollen is
transferred to the stigma or stigmatic surface of the pis-
til, where it sends out a pollen tube that grows down the
style and delivers the sperm nucleus to the egg.

seven-celled embryo sac. The pollen tube delivers the
sperm nuclei through the micropyle, or space between
the integuments. The stalk is in effect a placenta that
anchors the ovule to the ovary wall.
The anther contains a large number of microspore
mother cells, each of which undergoes meiotic division
to form uninucleate, single-celled microspores. The
microspores subsequently become encased in heavy,
resistant outer walls and the nucleus divides mitoti-
cally, forming two cells—a tube cell and a generative
cell—within the original spore wall. This is the mature
pollen grain (Figure 16.7).
Mature pollen grains are shed from the anthers
and carried to the stigmatic surface of the pistil by
insects, wind, or some other vector. Once the pollen
grain lands on the stigmatic surface—an event called
pollination—the pollen grain takes up water and sends
out a pollen tube that grows down the style of the pistil
toward the ovule (Figure 16.7 A, C). The tube nucleus
migrates down the pollen tube and appears to direct its
growth. The cell wall of the generative cell breaks down
and the generative nucleus divides once to form two
sperm nuclei that follow the tube nucleus down the tube
as it elongates. Pollen tube growth toward the embryo
sac requires a calcium gradient, but the precise signaling
mechanism remains uncharacterized.
In the ﬁnal stage, the elongating pollen tube enters
the ovule by growing through the micropyle (the space
between the ends of the surrounding integuments) and
releases the two sperm nuclei into the embryo sac. Ulti-
mately, one of the two sperm nuclei enters the egg cell
and fertilizes the egg cell nucleus to form the zygote.
The second sperm nucleus enters the large central cell
and fuses with the two polar nuclei to form a triploid
endosperm nucleus. The endosperm nucleus will go
on to form the primary nutritive tissue, or endosperm,
for the developing embryo. The involvement of two
sperm nuclei in this way is called double fertiliza-
tion, a characteristic unique to the ﬂowering plants or
angiosperms.
16.3.2 SEED DEVELOPMENT
AND MATURATION
Seeds come in various guises. To the plant ecologist, a
seed is a propagule or device for effecting propagation
of the individual or population. To the morphologist a
seed is more rigorously deﬁned as a mature ovule. The
physiologist, however, views a seed as a mature embryo

surrounded by nutritive tissues and encased in a protec-
tive seed coat. It is fair to say that germinating seeds and
young seedlings have been a favored system for studying
vegetative development since the time of Darwin and
before. Treating seeds with chemical mutagens is now
one of the most convenient systems for inducing muta-
tions that provide clues about developmental processes
(Box 16.1).
The development of a seed begins with the fertilized
ovule, or zygote. The early stage of seed development
is characterized by extensive cell divisions that form the
embryo and, in endospermic seeds, the tissues that store
nutrients that will support the eventual germination of
the seed and seedling development.
The ﬁrst division of the zygote is usually transverse
and immediately establishes polarity of the embryo.
The upper cell is destined to become the embryo itself
while the lower cell produces a stalk-like suspensor that
anchors the embryo at the base of the embryo sac. The
typical dicot seed will then pass through several recog-
nizable stages (Figure 16.8). During the early stages of
embryo development, cell division occurs throughout
the entire cell mass but at the heart-shape stage both
the shoot and root apical meristems begin to organize
as centers of cell division.
Throughout the development of the embryo, there
is a continuous ﬂow of nutrients from the parent plant
into the endosperm or the cotyledons. In some cases,
such as the cereal grains and most other monocots,

the endosperm is retained until maturity and may com-
prise the bulk of the seed (Figure 16.9 A, B). These are
called endospermic seeds. The endosperm of mature
endospermic seeds consists of cells ﬁlled with starch
along with protein and some small amounts of lipid.
In some monocot seeds, most notably the cereal grains
such as Triticum (wheat), Hordeum (barley), and Avena
(oats), the endosperm is surrounded by one or more
distinctive layers of cells, called the aleurone. Aleurone
cells are distinguished by the presence of numerous
protein bodies and are the source of enzymes needed
to mobilize nutrients during germination. Endosper-
mic dicot seeds, such as castor bean (Ricinus communis),
have retained a signiﬁcant amount of endosperm and at
maturity the cotyledons are thin, leaﬂike structures. In
nonendospermic dicot seeds, such as Pisum (pea) and
Phaseolus (bean), the cotyledons enlarge at the expense of
the endosperm and may occupy as much as 90 percent
of the seed volume at maturity (Figure 16.9C). Both
endosperm and cotyledons contain large quantities of
stored carbon (in the form of carbohydrates, lipids, and
protein), mineral elements, and hormones that support
the growth and development of the seedling until it can
establish itself as a photosynthetically competent plant.
The late, or maturation, stage of seed development
is characterized by cessation of embryo growth and the
development of desiccation resistance. Maturation is
terminated by a dramatic desiccation in which the water
content of the seed is reduced from 80 or 90 percent
to approximately 5 percent. Surrounding the mature
seed is a hard coat derived from maternal tissues (the
integuments) which surrounded the seed during its
development in the ovary. Comprised of heavy-walled
cells and covered with a thick, waxy cuticle, the seed
coat often presents a signiﬁcant barrier to the uptake of
both water and oxygen by the seed.
16.3.3 SEED GERMINATION
Because seeds are severely dehydrated, any metabolic
reactions
take
place
so
slowly
they
are
scarcely
detectable. Seeds are thus quiescent, or resting, organs
that represent a normal hiatus in the life cycle of a
plant. The embryo appears to be in a state of suspended
animation, capable in some cases of surviving adverse
conditions for long periods of time. Resumption of
embryo growth, called germination, is dependent
upon a number of factors, but three are especially
important: adequate water to re-hydrate the tissues, the
presence of oxygen to support aerobic respiration, and
a ‘‘physiological’’ temperature. Although many seeds
will germinate over a wide range of temperatures, the
optimum range for most seeds is 25◦C to 45◦C. The
lower limit is highly variable, depending on the species.
The upper limit generally reﬂects the temperature
which denatures proteins.

DEVELOPMENT IN
A MUTANT WEED
Many aspects of plant development have proven dif-
ﬁcult to dissect using exclusively physiological and
biochemical approaches. This is especially true of the
complex metabolic sequences that connect a develop-
mental event with the original signal that initiates that
event. Metabolic events associated with a signal trans-
duction pathway often represent a very small portion of
all the biochemical processes within a plant and may not
be discernible against this background of biochemical
‘‘noise.’’
Because all development can be traced back to the
expression of genes, one way around this dilemma is
to incorporate genetic mutations into a research pro-
gram. The use of mutant genes to study metabolism and
development has been a constructive approach since the
pioneering work of G. Beadle and E. Tatum with Neu-
rospora mutants in the 1940s. Over the years, mutants
in maize, tomato, pea, and a host of other plants have
provided important insights into normal development.
More recently, however, recombinant DNA techniques
have enabled us to ask questions about genes and devel-
opmental events in ways never before possible. The
principal strategy is to identify and genetically map
a mutation that modiﬁes the physiological response of
interest. It is then possible to physically isolate and clone
the wildtype gene and, based on its nucleotide sequence,
deduce the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein
that normally operates in the pathway. This provides
investigators with useful information about the function
of the wildtype gene and a means to further probe the
step that it controls. Furthermore, by studying interac-
tions between mutant genes and multiple input signals,
it is possible to dissect complex interactions between
different pathways.
One organism that has come to dominate this new
approach to the study of plant development is Arabidop-
sis thaliana, a member of the Brassicaceae, or mustard
family. A. thaliana (mouse-ear cress) is a small, herba-
ceous weed that grows in dry ﬁelds and along roadsides
throughout the temperate regions of the northern hemi-
sphere. Most Arabidopsis are winter annuals. Their seeds
germinate in the fall, forming an overwintering vegeta-
tive rosette. In the spring, as the days grow longer, the
stem elongates and ﬂowers.
There are many reasons why Arabidopsis has become
such a popular experimental tool and model system for
molecular genetic experiments on development. Ara-
bidopsis is easily grown in the laboratory and its life cycle
is complete in 5 to 6 weeks. It is also easily crossed
or self-fertilized and produces prodigious numbers of
seeds (up to 10,000 per plant). The Arabidopsis genome,
which has recently been completely sequenced, is one of
the smallest known plant genomes (approximately 108
nucleotides, or 25,498 genes). Finally, mutants are easily
induced by treating the seeds with chemical mutagens.
The surviving seeds are then germinated and mutant
progeny are recovered for analysis. The small size of
the plant together with its rapid growth and fecun-
dity make it easy to screen for mutants with reasonable
frequency.
One must always be cautious with so-called model
systems. What is learned about Arabidopsis, for example,
may well extrapolate to all brassicas, but not necessarily
to all plants. Nonetheless, Arabidopsis is an ideal plant
for doing molecular genetic and developmental experi-
ments. The isolation and study of mutants in Arabidopsis
has already made signiﬁcant contributions to many areas
of plant development. Moreover, what is learned about
physiology and development in Arabidopsis gives inves-
tigators important clues about what to look for in other
plants.
The initial step in germination of seeds is the uptake
of water and rehydration of the seed tissues by the pro-
cess of imbibition. Like osmosis, imbibition involves
the movement of water down a water potential gradient.
Imbibition differs from osmosis, however, in that it does
not require the presence of a differentially permeable
membrane and is driven primarily by surface-acting or
matric forces. In other words, imbibition involves the
chemical and electrostatic attraction of water to cell
walls, proteins, and other hydrophilic cellular materi-
als. Matric potential, like osmotic potential, is always
negative. Hydration causes a swelling of the imbibing
material, which may generate substantial forces (called
imbibition pressure). Imbibition pressure developed
by a germinating seed will cause the seed coat to rupture,
thus permitting the embryo to emerge.
One of the ﬁrst events to follow the rapid inﬂux
of water is the leakage of low molecular weight solutes
from the seed tissues. This apparently reﬂects an unsta-
ble conﬁguration of cell membranes related to the severe
desiccation. The leakage does not persist, however, as
the cells quickly repair themselves and a more sta-
ble membrane conﬁguration returns shortly after rehy-
dration.
Imbibition of water is followed by a general acti-
vation of seed metabolism within minutes of water

entering the cells, initially utilizing a few mitochon-
dria and respiratory enzymes that had been conserved in
the dehydrated state. Renewed protein synthesis is also
an early event, utilizing preexisting RNA transcripts and
ribosomes, as existing organelles are repaired and new
organelles are formed. This is followed closely by (1) the
release of hydrolytic enzymes that digest and mobilize
the stored reserves, and (2) renewed cell division and cell
enlargement in the embryonic axis. Detailed respiratory
pathways have been studied thoroughly in only a few
species of seeds, but it is believed that glycolysis and the
citric acid cycle are active to varying degrees in most, if
not all, seeds. These pathways produce the carbon skele-
tons and ATP that are required to support growth and
development of the embryo. The pentose phosphate
pathway is also important in seeds as it produces the
reducing potential (in the form NADPH) required for
the reductive synthesis of fatty acids and other essential
cellular constituents. The pentose phosphate pathway
also generates intermediates in the synthesis of aro-
matic compounds and perhaps nucleic acids. Seeds that
store carbon reserves principally in the form of fats and
oils will carry out the synthesis of hexose sugars via
gluconeogenesis.
The mobilization of stored carbon in seeds has been
most extensively studied in cereals (see Chapter 19). This
is because the endosperm of cereals has long served as a
principal source of nutrition for man and domesticated
animals, as well as a basic feedstock in the brewing
industries. These needs have provided a strong incentive
for research into the mobilization of starch reserves in
cereal grains. In nonendospermic dicot seed such as
the legumes (peas, beans), the initial stages of radicle
elongation appear to depend on reserves stored in the
tissues of the radicle itself. Later, carbon reserves are
mobilized from the cotyledons and transported to the
elongating axis.
In most species, germination is considered com-
plete when the radicle emerges from the seed coat.
Radicle emergence occurs through a combination of
cell enlargement within the radicle itself and imbibition
pressures developed within the seed. Rupture of the
seed coat and protrusion of the radicle allows it to make
direct contact with water and nutrient salts required to
support further growth of the young seedling.
16.3.4 THE LEVEL AND ACTIVITIES
OF VARIOUS HORMONES
CHANGE DRAMATICALLY
DURING SEED DEVELOPMENT
Seed development is characterized by often dramatic
changes in the levels of the principal plant hormones
(Figure 16.10). In most seeds, cytokinin (CK) levels are
highest during the very early stages of embryo develop-
ment when the rate of cell division is also highest. As the

development and germination. Cytokinins (CK) are
present during the early stages of development, when
cell division is most active. The concentration of
cytokinins then declines while the concentrations of
gibberellin (GA) and auxin (IAA) increase to support
active cell enlargement. Abscisic acid (ABA) concentra-
tion increases in the later stages to prevent precocious
germination. After a quiescent period, the release of gib-
berellins activates nutrient mobilization and IAA levels
increase to stimulate cellular enlargement in the young
seedling.
cytokinin levels decline and the embryo enters a period
of rapid cell enlargement and differentiation, both auxin
and gibberellin (GA) levels increase. In the early stages
of embryogenesis, there is little or no detectable abscisic
acid (ABA). It is during the latter stages of embryo
development, as GA and IAA levels begin to decline,
that ABA levels begin to rise. ABA levels generally peak
during the maturation stage when seed volume and dry
weight also reach a maximum. The signiﬁcance of these
changes will become more apparent as we look at the
speciﬁc effects of individual hormones in later chapters.
Maturation of the embryo is characterized by cessation
of embryo growth, accumulation of nutrient reserves,
and the development of tolerance to desiccation.
16.3.5 MANY SEEDS HAVE ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS FOR
GERMINATION
Many seeds will not germinate even though the minimal
environmental conditions have been met. These seeds
are said to be dormant and will not germinate until
additional conditions have been met.
The most common causes of seed dormancy are
the impermeability of the seed coat to water or oxygen
or physiological immaturity of the embryo at the time
the seed is shed from the mother plant. Immature seeds
must undergo complex biochemical changes, collectively
known as after-ripening, before they will germinate.
After-ripening is usually triggered by low temperature,
a mechanism that appears to ensure that the seed will
not germinate precociously in the fall but will germinate
when favorable weather returns in the spring.
Dormancy imposed by restricting the uptake of
water and exchange of oxygen can be removed by
mechanically disrupting or removing the seed coat, a
process called scariﬁcation. In the laboratory, scariﬁ-
cation may be accomplished with ﬁles or sandpaper. In
nature, abrasion by sand, microbial action, or passage of
the seed through the gut of an animal will accomplish
the same end. Seed coats can be very tough. Uniformity
and rate of germination of morning glory (Pharbitis nil ),
cotton, and some tropical legume seeds, for example,
can be improved by soaking the dry seed in concen-
trated sulphuric acid for up to an hour. Scariﬁcation by
passage through animal gut no doubt occurs as a result
of the acidic conditions in the gut.
There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest
that seed coats also interfere with gas exchange, oxygen
uptake in particular. Removal of the seed coat often leads
to a signiﬁcant increase in respiratory consumption of
oxygen. Measurements of the oxygen permeability of
seed coats have been made and there is general agree-
ment that permeability is very low in those seeds tested.
However, it is not always clear that limited oxygen
permeability is the primary cause of dormancy. The
complexity of the situation and problems of interpreta-
tion are well illustrated by studies of the genus Xanthium,
or cocklebur. A cocklebur contains two seeds: an upper,
dormant seed and a lower, nondormant seed. Dormancy
of the upper seed can be overcome either by removing
the seed coat or by subjecting the intact seed to high
oxygen tension. The inference is that seed coat perme-
ability in the dormant seed limits the supply of oxygen
to the embryo and thus prevents germination. How-
ever, several other observations have cast doubt on this
conclusion. There are, for example, no measurable dif-
ferences between the dormant and nondormant seed
with respect to the permeability of the seed coat to oxy-
gen. Moreover, the rate of oxygen diffusion through the
seed coats is more than sufﬁcient to support measured
rates of oxygen consumption by the embryos inside.
Clearly, dormancy of the upper seed in Xanthium can-
not be due to limited permeability of the seed coat to
oxygen. Why then, do the upper, dormant seeds require
a higher oxygen level to elicit germination? It appears
that the seed coat is a barrier, not to the uptake of oxy-
gen but to the removal of an inhibitor from the embryo.
Aqueous extracts of Xanthium seeds have revealed the
presence of two unidentiﬁed inhibitors, based on tests
of the extracts in a wheat coleoptile elongation assay.
The same two inhibitors are found in diffusate collected
from isolated embryos placed on a moist medium, but
not in diffusates from seeds surrounded by an intact seed
coat. Thus germination in the dormant seed appears
to be prevented by the presence of these inhibitors
and the seed coat serves as a barrier that prevents
those inhibitors from being leached out. The apparent

16.4 From Embryo to Adult
285
oxygen requirement can be explained by the observa-
tion that high oxygen tension reduces the quantity of
an extractable inhibitor, presumably by some oxidative
degradation.
The seed coat may contain inhibitors that pre-
vent growth of the embryo but the role of inhibitors
in seed dormancy is not clear. Along with hormones
such as auxins and gibberellins, a large number of
potential inhibitors have been identiﬁed in seeds, fruits,
and other dispersal units. These include the hormone
abscisic acid, unsaturated lactones (e.g., coumarin), phe-
nolic compounds (e.g., ferulic acid), various amino
acids, and cyanogenic compounds (i.e., compounds that
release cyanide) characteristic of apple and other seeds
in the family Rosaceae. The simple presence of an
inhibitor does not, however, prove a role in dor-
mancy. The inhibitors could be localized in tissues not
directly involved in growth of the embryo or otherwise
sequestered so as to preclude any role in preventing
germination. Evidence in support of a role for inhibitors
is generally limited to leaching experiments such as that
described above for Xanthium. In some cases, dormancy
can then be restored by exposing the leached seed to
the inhibitor. In order to clearly establish whether an
inhibitor has an active role in regulating germination,
it is necessary to establish whether inhibitor levels in
the seed correlate with the onset and termination of
dormancy. In spite of the voluminous literature relating
inhibitors to dormancy, there is very little critical sup-
port for a direct role. For the present, evidence for the
imposition and maintenance of dormancy by inhibitors
remains largely circumstantial.
The dormancy and germination of many seeds are
also inﬂuenced by light and hormones. These factors
will be discussed in later chapters.
16.4 FROM EMBRYO TO ADULT
The ﬁrst structure to emerge when a seed germinates
is the radicle. The radicle, which is the nascent primary
root, anchors the seed in the soil and begins the process
of mining the soil for water and nutrients. As the primary
roots elongates, it gives rise to branch, or lateral, roots.
Unlike the situation in the shoot apical meristem, lateral
roots do not originate in the root apical meristem.
Lateral root primordia originate in the pericycle, a ring
of meristematic cells that surround the central vascular
core, or stele, of the primary root. The growing lateral
root works its way through the surrounding cortex,
either by mechanically forcing its way through or by
secreting enzymes that digest the cortical cell walls.
Lateral root primordia arise in close proximity to the
newly differentiated xylem tissue, which allows vascular
elements developing behind the growing tip of the
lateral root to maintain connections with the xylem and
phloem of the primary root.
Emergence of the radicle is followed by elonga-
tion of the shoot axis. In some dicot seedlings, such as
the bean (Phaseous vulgaris) the hypocotyl (hypo, below
the cotyledons) is the ﬁrst part of the axis to elongate.
The hypocotyl is hooked so that it pulls rather than
pushes the cotyledons and the enclosed ﬁrst foliage
leaves and shoot tip, called the plumule, up through
the soil. This pattern is known as epigeal germina-
tion (Figure 16.11A). In other dicots, such as garden
pea, the hypocotyl remains short and compact and the
cotyledons remain underground. Instead, the epicotyl
(epi, above the cotyledons) is the part of the shoot that
elongates. The epicotyl in this case forms a hook so

Chapter 16 / Development: An Overview
that the clasping leaves of the plumule are pulled rather
than pushed through the soil. This pattern of germina-
tion, where the cotyledons remain in the soil is known
as hypogeal (Figure 16.11B). In either case, once the
seedling axis breaks through the soil surface and emerges
into the light, the hook straightens and the primary
leaves unfold begin to expand. The principal objective of
the hypocotyl or epicotyl hook is to bring the ﬁrst leaves
and meristem (the plumule) safely above the soil line
in order to establish active photosynthesis. Without the
hook, the plumule would no doubt be subject to consid-
erable abrasion and damage as it moves through the soil.
A
third
example
of
seedling
development
is
provided by corn (maize), oats, and other cereal grains
(Figure 16.11C). In the seed, both the plumule, includ-
ing the ﬁrst leaves and meristem, and the radicle are
surrounded by sheath-like structures—the coleoptile
and the coleorhiza, respectively (see Figure 16.9B).
The coleorhiza is the ﬁrst structure to emerge from the
pericarp. (In cereals, each grain is actually a fruit and the
surrounding tissues are the mature ovary walls which
function as a seed coat. In corn this is called the peri-
carp.) Growing rapidly, the radicle quickly penetrates
the coleorhiza and assumes the function of the primary
root. Meanwhile, the coleoptile is pushed upward by
elongation of the mesocotyl or ﬁrst internode. The
coleoptile serves the same purpose as the plumular hook
in dicots. It encases and protects the fragile ﬁrst leaves
until they emerge from the soil. Then the coleoptile
splits open, allowing the leaves to grow into the sunlight.
Elongation of the shoot axis proceeds through
a combination of cell division and enlargement of
the cells laid down by the meristem. The rate and
extent of elongation is subject to a variety of controls,
including nutrition, hormones, and environmental fac-
tors such as light and temperature. The ﬁnal height
of a shoot is determined by the rate and extent to
which internodes—the sections of stem between leaf
nodes—elongate. In some plants, such as pea (Pisum
sativum), elongation occurs primarily near the apical
end of the youngest internode. The older internodes
effectively complete their elongation before the next
internode begins. In other plants, elongation may be
spread through several internodes, which elongate and
mature more or less simultaneously (Figure 16.12). Still
others exhibit changing rates of elongation with suc-
cessive internodes, usually increasing. In some plants,
internodes fail to elongate, thus giving rise to the rosette
habit in which all the leaves appear to originate from
more or less the same point on the stem. This rosette
habit is common in biennial plants (those that ﬂower in
the second year) such as cabbage and root crops such
as carrot (Daucus carota) and radish (Raphanus sativus)
before they reach the ﬂowering stage. Failure of intern-
ode elongation is commonly related to low levels of the
FIGURE 16.12 Internode elongation in broad bean (Vicia
faba) over 48 hours. The initial spacing between marks
was 2 mm. This internode has elongated more or less
uniformly over its entire length.
plant hormone, gibberellin, since application of the hor-
mone usually stimulates internode elongation in rosette
plants.
16.5 SENESCENCE AND
PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH
ARE THE FINAL STAGES
OF DEVELOPMENT
The ﬁnal stage in the development of cells, tissues, and
organs is senescence, an aging process characterized
by increased respiration, declining photosynthesis, and
an orderly disassembly of macromolecules. Senescing
cells and tissues are metabolically very active—a
number of metabolic pathways are turned off and
new pathways, principally catabolic in character, are
activated. Catabolism of proteins, for example, releases
organic nitrogen and sulfur in the form of soluble
amines, while nucleic acids release inorganic phosphate.
Chlorophyll is broken down and lipids are converted to
soluble sugars via gluconeogenesis. The products of
these pathways are all small, soluble molecules that are
readily exported from the senescing tissue. Senescence
thus enables the plant to recover nutrients from cells or
tissue that have reached the end of their useful life and
reallocate them to other parts of the plant that survive
or for storage in the roots.
Many of the new pathways are encoded by senes-
cence associated genes (SAGs), which show increased
transcription during senescence. The more than 50
SAGs that have been identiﬁed to date fall generally
into one of two broad groups. One group includes genes
that encode components of the system, such as the
enzymes of the largely catabolic pathways that are newly
activated during senescence. These include products
such as ubiquitin, a range of proteolytic enzymes, and

Chapter Review
287
metallothioneins—proteins that chelate metal ions.
The second group of genes regulates the initiation of
senescence or its rate of progress. Among this group
are the so-called ‘‘stay-green’’ mutants characterized by
delayed leaf senescence. An interesting consequence of
the ‘‘stay-green’’ phenotype is the potential for higher
crop yields. Because senescence of the leaf is delayed,
the period of active photosynthetic output and, conse-
quently, yield are extended.
Senescence is a normal consequence of the aging
process and will occur even when the supply of water
and minerals is maintained. For example, older leaves
at the base of a plant commonly senesce in favor of
younger leaves near the top. Flower petals senesce once
the ovule has been fertilized and seed development is
underway. The leaves of perennial plants senesce at the
end of the growing season and export the nutrients to
the roots for storage over the winter.
Senescence is one form of programmed cell death
(PCD), broadly deﬁned as a process in which the orga-
nism exerts a measure of genetic control over the death
of cells. PCD requires energy and is normally regulated
by a distinct set of genes.
PCD is essential for normal vegetative and repro-
ductive development. One example is the development
of xylem tracheary elements. In order to function efﬁ-
ciently as a conduit for water transport, the protoplast
of the developing tracheary element must die and be
removed at maturity. PCD also operates in the forma-
tion of aerenchyma, a loose parenchymal tissue with
large air spaces. Aerenchyma normally forms in the
stems and roots of water lilies and other aquatic plants.
These air spaces, created by a cell death program, pro-
vide channels for oxygen transport to the submerged
portions of the plant. Even corn (Zea mays) and other
terrestrial plants can be induced to form aerenchyma
when subject to ﬂooding.
In the development of unisexual ﬂowers, primordia
for both the male and female ﬂowers are present in the
early stages. One or the other then aborts via a cell death
program, leaving only one type of organ to complete
development.
PCD is also an important factor in plant responses
to invading pathogens and abiotic stress. When a plant
recognizes a pathogen, for example, host cells in the
immediate area of the infection undergo PCD. This
deprives the invading pathogen of living tissue and
either slows or prevents it spread.
SUMMARY
Plants, like any other multicellular organism, build
complexity by combining growth with differentiation.
Growth is simply an irreversible increase in size that
reﬂects an increase in cell number as well as the size of
individual cells. Differentiation refers to the qualitative
changes, or specialization in cell structure and function,
that normally a accompany growth. The sum of growth
and differentiation is development.
Growth in plants is limited to discrete regions
called meristems. The principal meristems that give
rise to the primary plant body are located at the apices
of stems and roots. Secondary meristems in stems and
roots are responsible for increases in girth.
The life of an individual plant begins with fertiliza-
tion or the union of a haploid sperm nucleus (supplied
by a pollen grain) with a haploid egg nucleus in the
ovary, located at the base of the pistil. The resulting
zygote goes through a series of stages to produce a
mature embryo consisting of one or more cotyledons, a
plumule consisting of primary leaves and a shoot apical
meristem, and a radicle that is destined to become a
primary root. The embryo develops within a nutritive
tissue called the endosperm.
Seed germination is initiated when the seed
takes up water to re-hydrate the dry tissues. Respi-
ration is one of the ﬁrst metabolic activities to be
detected as nutrient reserves are mobilized from the
endosperm or cotyledons and the embryo renews its
growth.
Genetic control over the death of cells, called
programmed cell death, is a normal component of
development and gives rise to structures as diverse
as mature xylem vessels and unisexual ﬂowers.

Growth and Development of Cells
Cells are the basic unit of life. The development of
a whole plant, as intricate as it may seem, ultimately
depends on the growth and coordinated development
of individual cells and groups of cells. The growth and
development of cells, both individually and collectively,
is in turn directed by a variety of internal and external
signals such as hormones, light, temperature, gravity,
insect predation, disease, and even the position of a
cell with respect to other cells. This chapter provides
a general introduction to selected aspects of cellular
development, including
•
the structure of plant cell walls,
•
the dynamics of cell division and cell growth, and
•
an overview of signal perception and the signal
chains that enable cells to respond to those signal.
17.1 GROWTH OF PLANT CELLS
IS COMPLICATED BY THE
PRESENCE OF A CELL WALL
Plant cells are characterized by a complex mixture of
materials, called the extracellular matrix (ECM), that
lie outside the plasma membrane. The ECM is dom-
inated by the cell wall, which provides protection for
the underlying protoplast and is ultimately responsible
for maintaining cell shape and the structural integrity
of the plant. Two types of cell walls are recognized:
primary walls, which surround young, actively growing
cells, and secondary walls that are laid down as the cells
mature and are no longer growing.
17.1.1 THE PRIMARY CELL WALL IS A
NETWORK OF CELLULOSE
MICROFIBRILS AND
CROSS-LINKING GLYCANS
The primary wall is very thin, measuring only a few
micrometers in thickness. Its principal constituent is
long, threadlike chains of α−1 →4−linked glucose
units,
called
cellulose.
The
individual
cellulose
molecules are bundled in long, parallel arrays called
microﬁbrils (Figure 17.1). Each microﬁbril is approxi-
mately 5 to 12 nm in diameter and contains, in higher
plants, approximately 36 individual cellulose chains
in cross-section. A single cellulose chain may contain
as many as 3,000 or more glucose units but, because
the chains begin and end at different places within the
microﬁbril, an individual microﬁbril may contain several
thousand cellulose chains and reach lengths of several
hundred micrometers. Adjacent cellulose chains within
a microﬁbril are held together by hydrogen bonds
between hydroxyl (—OH) groups on adjacent glucose
units. This bonding arrangement makes a microﬁbril

very strong. In fact, the tensile strength of a microﬁbril,
or its ability to withstand tension without breaking, is
similar to that of a steel wire of the same size.
The orientation of microﬁbrils in the primary wall
is more-or-less random (Figure 17.2), although in elon-
gating cells they tend to orient parallel to the direction
of growth. The cellulose microﬁbrils within the pri-
mary wall are held in position by cross-linking glycans.1
Cross-linking glycans are noncellulosic polysaccharides
that bind to the cellulose microﬁbrils, but are also long
enough to bridge the distance between neighboring
microﬁbrils and link them into a semi-rigid network
(Figure 17.3). In the primary cell wall of all dicotyledo-
nous (dicot) species and about one-half of the monoco-
tyledons (monocot) species, the principal cross-linking
glycans are xyloglycans (XyGs). Xyloglycans are linear
(1→4)β-glucose chains (like cellulose), but with a 5-car-
bon sugar, xylose, linked to the oxygen at the carbon-6
position on many of the glucose units (Figure 17.4). In
some species, some of the xylose units may be replaced

was formerly referred to as ‘‘hemicellulose,’’ a heterogeneous
but generally uncharacterized mixture of cell wall
polysaccharides characterized solely by their extractability
into strong alkali solution.
by other sugars, such as arabinose, fructose, galactose,
or glucuronic acid. Some side chains may be composed
of two or three of these sugars instead of one.
17.1.2 THE CELLULOSE–GLYCAN
LATTICE IS EMBEDDED IN A
MATRIX OF PECTIN
AND PROTEIN
As much as 35 percent of the primary wall consists
of pectins, or pectic substances. Pectin is a complex,
heterogeneous mixture of noncellulosic polysaccharides
especially rich in galacturonic acid—the acid form of
the sugar galactose. When the pectin chain is secreted
into the wall space, most of the free carboxylic acid
groups are esteriﬁed with methyl groups. Once in the
wall, however, the enzyme pectin methylesterase cleaves
some of the methyl groups, leaving the acid groups free
to bind with calcium. The divalent calcium ions form
cross-links between pectin chains and contribute to the
stability of the cell wall. It is signiﬁcant that calcium
concentrations (and, consequently, calcium bridging)
are kept low in the walls of actively growing cells.
Pectins are also the principal constituent of the
middle lamella. The middle lamella lies between the
primary walls of adjacent cells. It is the ‘‘cement’’ that

holds the cells together. The softening of fruit as it
ripens, for example, is due in part to the action of the
enzyme polygalacturonase, which degrades the pectic
substances in the middle lamella and loosens of the
bonds between the cells.
Primary cell walls also contain approximately 10
percent glycoprotein which have an unusually high
content of the amino acid hydroxyproline. These
hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are called extensin.
Although the precise function of extensin is unknown,

it is thought to be one component of a structural
network that adds strength to the wall and locks the wall
into shape once the cell stops growing. Several other
families of cell wall proteins rich in proline, glycine, or
threonine have been described more recently, adding
to the apparent complexity of cell wall structure.
17.1.3 CELLULOSE MICROFIBRILS ARE
ASSEMBLED AT THE PLASMA
MEMBRANE AS THEY ARE
EXTRUDED INTO THE
CELL WALL
Cellulose synthesis is catalyzed by cellulose synthase, a
multimeric enzyme that is localized in the plasma mem-
brane (Figure 17.5). Although active cellulose synthase
has proven difﬁcult to isolate, the enzyme complex can
be visualized in electron micrographs of membranes
prepared by a technique known as freeze-fracturing. At
least in angiosperms, the enzyme appears to be orga-
nized in the form of a rosette composed of six subunits.
The rosette not only synthesizes the cellulose chain, but
assembles the chains into microﬁbrils and extrudes the
microﬁbrils into the cell wall.
The immediate precursor for cellulose synthesis is
uridine diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glu). UDP-Glu can
be formed directly from sucrose by certain forms of
the enzyme sucrose synthase, and also appears to be
associated with the plasma membrane. It thus appears
that sucrose synthase may deliver UDP-Glu directly to
the catalytic site of the cellulose synthase rosette, where
the glucose is added to the terminus of the growing
microﬁbril.
The details of cellulose biosynthesis are not well
understood, in part because of the difﬁculty in isolating
active enzyme. Even the rosettes are absent from isolated
membranes, leading to the suggestion that some form of
interaction with the cytoskeleton is required to stabilize
the enzyme in situ. When this interaction is disrupted,
the complex dissociates and its activity is lost.
17.2 CELL DIVISION
The division of plant cells, like any eukaryotic cell,
occurs in two steps: mitosis or karyokinesis, which

results in the creation of two new nuclei, and cytokine-
sis, the subsequent division of the cytoplasm to create
two separate daughter cells. Between divisions, however,
each of the daughter cells must increase the amount of
cytoplasm as it enlarges, replicate its DNA, and prepare
for the next division. This sequence of events is known
as the cell cycle.
17.2.1 THE CELL CYCLE
The cell cycle can be described as four distinct phases:
the mitotic phase (M), the DNA synthesis phase (S),
and the two intervening phases or ‘‘gaps’’ (G1 and
G2) (Figure 17.6). The M phase is the division phase in
which chromosomes are condensed and their distinctive
morphology becomes visible with a light microscope.
Throughout the other three phases, collectively referred
to as interphase, the chromosomes are fully extended and
uncoiled and are not visible with a light microscope.
During S phase, DNA replication leads to the formation
of two identical copies of the chromosomes. In the G2
phase, the chromosomes begin to condense and the cell
assembles the rest of the machinery necessary to move
the chromosomes apart during mitosis.

division phase, or mitosis. During mitosis the chromo-
somes condense and the sister chromatids are separated.
S is the phase during which the chromosomes are diffuse,
but DNA synthesis occurs. Mitosis and the synthesis
phases are separated by two gaps in time. The progress
of the cell cycle is normally controlled at either the G1 to
S transition, or the G2 to M transition.
The time required to complete a cell cycle is highly
variable, depending on the cell type and various devel-
opmental cues, but the length of the S phase and the
M phase remain roughly constant for a given cell type.
G1 is the most variable phase and may account for the
major portion of a cell’s life span.
In order for development to proceed in an orderly
manner, the timing and rate of cell division and con-
sequently entry into the cell cycle must be precisely
controlled. The required control is achieved through a
complex interplay of various kinases, phosphatases, and
proteases that respond to both intrinsic and external
signals. Central to cell cycle control are the activi-
ties of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are
composed of two subunits—one subunit functions as a
catalyst and the other serves to activate the complex.
The activating subunit is a small, unstable protein called
cyclin, so named because when they were ﬁrst discov-
ered in Xenopus eggs, it was observed that during each
cell cycle the concentration rose steadily from zero and
then suddenly collapsed.
In plants, there are at least four classes of cyclins (A,
B, D, and H) and the association of CDKs with speciﬁc
cyclins is a key regulatory factor. Equally important is
the availability of cyclins as the levels of the activating
subunit oscillate during the cell cycle due to regulated
synthesis and degradation. Activation of CDKs also
requires phosphorylation of a speciﬁc threonine residue
(Thr160) on the catalytic subunit by a CDK-activating
kinase (CAK), while phosphorylation of other threonine
and tyrosine residues (Thr14, Tyr15) inhibits CDK acti-
vity. Phosphatase enzymes are available to remove the
inhibitory phosphate groups at the appropriate time.
The two principal sites of CDK control appear to be at
the G1 to S or G2 to M transitions. It is assumed that the
function of an active CDK complex is to phosphorylate
and thus activate other proteins involved in the synthesis
of DNA (S phase) or initiation of mitosis (M phase).
CDK inhibitors (CKI) also play a pivotal role by
arresting cell division when necessary, such as at the end
of a developmental program or in response to hormonal
or environmental cues. Operating principally at the G1
to S transition, a CKI will bind with an active CDK
complex in order to prevent it from phosphorylating
substrate. When conditions are appropriate for the cell
cycle to continue, the CKI can be removed by proteoly-
sis. First, CKI is marked for degradation by attachment
of ubiquitin (See Box 17.2). The ubiquitinated CKI is
then degraded, the CDK complex reactivated, and the
G1 to S transition is allowed to proceed.
17.2.2 CYTOKINESIS
Cytokinesis in animal cells is relatively simple, involving
a constriction of the cell membrane which advances
toward the center until the one cell becomes two cells.
The existence of the cell wall prevents a similar pattern
of cell division in plant cells. Plant cells must instead
construct new membranes and a new extracellular matrix,
including a middle lamella and two new primary walls,
inside a living cell.
The formation of the new walls begins in the late
mitotic or M phase of the cell cycle, after the two sets of
chromosomes have separated and moved toward oppo-
site poles in the cell and the new nuclear membranes
have begun to form. At this point, the mitotic spindle dis-
appears and the microtubules that had made up the spin-
dle disassemble and then reassemble to form a cluster of
interdigitating microtubules oriented perpendicular to
the plane of the new crosswall (Figure 17.7) (Box 17.1).
Called the phragmoplast, these microtubules serve to
direct the movement of small secretory vesicles, derived
from nearby Golgi complexes, into the equatorial
region of the cell. The vesicles begin collecting in the
center of the cell where they align along the equatorial
plane and begin to fuse with one another. The resulting
aggregate of vesicles is called the cell plate.
As newly arrived vesicles continue to add to the
cell plate, the plate grows outward in all directions
until its leading edge makes contact with the existing
plasma membrane surrounding the parent cell. Fusion
of the plate membranes with the parent cell membrane

in a dividing plant cell. Following nuclear
division, tubulin subunits originating from
remnants of the mitotic spindle reorganize as
microtubules oriented perpendicular to the
plane of cell division. These microtubules,
collectively called the phragmoplast, serve
to track small, Golgi-derived secretory vesi-
cles into the equatorial plane of the cell. The
vesicles fuse to form the cell plate, which
gradually grows outward toward the lateral
membranes of the dividing cell. The grow-
ing cell plate eventually fuses with the lat-
eral membranes. The membranes of the cell
plate form the new plasma membranes of the
daughter cells and the contents of the orig-
inal Golgi vesicles form the middle lamella
between them. Once membrane fusion is
complete, each daughter cell completes a new
crosswall by depositing a new primary wall.

effectively completes the separation of the two daugh-
ter cells. The interior of the plate—between the two
membranes—is ﬁlled with the pectic substances deliv-
ered by the Golgi vesicles and that now make up the
middle lamella between the daughter cells. Cytokinesis is
complete when cellulose synthase complexes are inserted
into the new membranes and each daughter cell deposits
a new primary wall adjacent to the middle lamella.
17.2.3 PLASMODESMATA ARE
CYTOPLASMIC CHANNELS THAT
EXTEND THROUGH THE WALL
TO CONNECT THE
PROTOPLASTS OF
ADJACENT CELLS
When the cell plate forms, membrane fusion is not
complete. This leaves some locations where cytoplasm
continuity is maintained between daughter cells. As the
cellulose is laid down and the new wall increases in
thickness, these connections form membrane-encased
channels called plasmodesmata (sing. plasmodesma)
(Figure 17.9). The membrane that encases the channel is
a continuation of the plasma membranes from adjacent
cells. Running through the center of the plasmodesma
is a second membranous tube—a tube within a tube—
called the desmotubule. The desmotubule is formed
as an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum that was
entrapped during the formation of the cell plate. A
sleeve of cytosol ﬁlls the space between the desmotubule
and plasmodesmata itself.
Plasmodesmata
are
not
large—approximately
60 nm in diameter—but there are often large numbers
of them. Estimated frequencies are in the range of 0.1
to 10.0 μm−2 of cell wall, although there is a tendency
for plasmodesmata to be grouped in roughly oval areas
called primary pit ﬁelds. Plasmodesmata are small
enough to preclude the exchange of organelles between
cells but large enough to permit the diffusion of small
solute molecules, including infectious viral RNA and
plant transcription factors, through the cytosolic sleeve.
Plasmodesmata thus provide a measure of membrane
and cytosolic continuity between cells and allow for
supracellular control over developmental programs.
The connection of neighboring protoplasts through
plasmodesmata creates a continuous cytoplasmic net-
work, referred to as the symplast, throughout the plant.
In a similar manner, the apoplast consists of continu-
ous extracellular or noncytoplasmic space. The apoplast
consists of interconnected cell walls, intercellular spaces,
and mature, nonliving vascular tissue. The concept of a
symplast and an apoplast is especially useful when con-
sidering the movement of water and dissolved solutes
throughout the plant.

locking network of cellulose microﬁbrils, cross-linking

BOX 17.1
CYTOSKELETON
Virtually all eukaryotic cells, both animal and plant,
contain a three-dimensional, interconnected network of
ﬁbrous protein called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskele-
ton plays vital roles in determining the organization of
cytoplasm and cell shape, and in cell division, growth,
and differentiation.
The cytoskeleton of plant cells is composed of two
different elements: microtubules and microﬁlaments.
Microtubules are long rods approximately 24 nm in
diameter and a hollow core about 12 nm in diameter.
They are assembled from subunits of a globular protein
called tubulin, which has a molecular mass of approx-
imately 100,000 daltons (100 kD) and is made up of
two globular polypeptides (α-tubulin and β-tubulin).1
Microtubules are formed when tubulin subunits sponta-
neously self-assemble into long chains called protoﬁla-
ments. Protoﬁlaments then line up laterally to form the
microtubule wall (see Figure 17.8). Microﬁlaments are
solid threads composed of actin, also a globular protein.
Two chains of actin subunits self-assemble in a helical
fashion to form a microﬁlament approximately 6 nm in
diameter.
The term cytoskeleton is an unfortunate choice
because it implies a rigid structure with a static
function. Instead, the cytoskeleton is very dynamic.
Microtubules
in
particular
are
constantly
being
assembled, disassembled, and rearranged as the cell

and

Microtubules
form the mitotic spindle, which plays a signiﬁcant
role in the movement of chromosomes during cell
division. Microtubules also determine the orientation
and location of the new cell wall between daughter
cells, and the deposition of cellulose in growing cell
walls.
Microﬁlaments appear to control the direction

the growth of pollen tubes. When a pollen grain germi-
nates, it develops a tubular extension that grows down
the stigma of the ﬂower and serves to deliver the male
nucleus to the egg. Growth of the tube is only at the tip,
and vesicles that contain cell wall precursors are guided
through the cytoplasm to the growing tip by a network
of microtubules.
The importance of the cytoskeleton in organizing
and coordinating the dynamic properties of growing
cells is only beginning to be appreciated. Techniques
for the study of plant cell cytoskeleton are rapidly
improving, and we can expect exciting advances in the
future.

strength and rigidity to the wall. This strength and
rigidity maintains the shape of the cell and its structural
relationship with neighboring cells and, ultimately, the
support of the entire plant. Thus a growing cell faces a
delicate balancing act. It must, at the same time, main-
tain the strength and structural integrity of the wall
while remaining sufﬁciently pliant to provide space for
the expanding protoplast.
17.3.1 CELL GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY
WATER UPTAKE AND LIMITED
BY THE STRENGTH AND
RIGIDITY OF THE CELL WALL
Since most of the volume of any cell is water, it follows
that for a cell to increase its volume it must take up water.
If, for example, a cell is bathed in an isotonic solution of
mannitol or similar solute that cannot enter the cell, the
cell will also not take up water and it will not grow. The
driving force for cell enlargement is the uptake of water.
Recall that cells take up water by the process of
osmosis. The high solute concentration of the proto-
plasm and vacuolar sap decreases the water potential of
the cell to the point where water diffuses into the cell.
With no means to compensate, a cell surrounded by pure
water might continue to swell indeﬁnitely or at least until
internal pressures exceeded the tensile strength of the
membrane. The consequences of such a situation are
vividly demonstrated when mammalian red blood cells
are placed in water. The cells quickly swell until the
plasma membrane bursts, releasing their contents into
the medium. Most animal cells avoid such osmotic dis-
aster by using metabolic energy to excrete either solute
or water and thus maintain a favorable pressure bal-
ance. Plant cells have found a different solution—they
surround the plasma membrane with a strong, more or
less rigid cell wall. Turgor pressure (a positive pressure)
developed as the expanding protoplast pushes against
the wall rises until it balances the negative osmotic pres-
sure of the protoplast. At that point the water potential
of the cell approaches zero and no further net water
uptake—or cell growth—will occur. It is the strength
and rigidity of the cell wall that imposes critical restric-
tions on the capacity of plant cells to grow. Thus, for
a cell to increase in size, the strength and rigidity of
the cell wall must be modiﬁed in order to reduce the
water potential of the cell, permit water uptake, and,
consequently, allow the cell to enlarge.
17.3.2 EXTENSION OF THE CELL WALL
REQUIRES WALL-LOOSENING
EVENTS THAT ENABLE
LOAD-BEARING ELEMENTS IN
THE WALL TO YIELD TO
TURGOR PRESSURE
Any increase in volume of a cell requires a corresponding
increase in the surface area of the surrounding wall, or
wall extension. Investigators know that wall extension
is related to turgor pressure—this has been demon-
strated empirically. For example, when turgor pressure
is experimentally reduced, the rate of cell expansion also
declines. Furthermore, wall extension and growth do
not occur in cells at very low or zero turgor pressure,
even though the cells remain metabolically active and
appropriate growth stimuli are present. This interde-
pendence of wall extension and turgor pressure can be
summarized by the following simple relationship:
dV/dt = m(P −Y)
(17.1)
The term dV/dt is the change (d) in volume (V) of a
cell over time (dt). dV/dt is thus a simple way to express
the growth rate of a cell. Y is the yield threshold, or the

of the elastic component, represented as springs. In 2a,
yielding of the plastic components allows relaxation in
the elastic component, illustrated by contraction of the
springs. In 2b, turgor reestablishes wall stress and the
wall expands to the same extent that the plastic compo-

minimum turgor pressure necessary for cell expansion to
occur. The term m is wall extensibility, a proportionality
constant between growth rate and turgor pressure (P)
in excess of the yield threshold. Wall extensibility is
a quantitative measure of the capacity of the wall to
irreversibly increase its surface area. According to this
relationship, the growth of a cell depends principally on
the amount by which turgor pressure exceeds the yield
threshold.
It is apparent that a growing cell is faced with con-
ﬂicting roles of turgor pressure. On the one hand, turgor
pressure opposes the continued uptake of water, which
is the driving force for cell expansion. At the same time,
turgor pressure promotes irreversible wall extension and
cell enlargement. How does the cell resolve this con-
ﬂict? The answer to this question is provided by the
concept of stress relaxation. Stress relaxation in the wall
is central to the process of cell growth.
Turgor pressure develops because the cell wall—
cellulose microﬁbrils cross-linked with xyloglucans—
resists deformation as the protoplast attempts to expand.
The force of the expanding protoplast pushing against
the wall thus generates stress (deﬁned as force/unit
area) within the wall. Cell growth appears to be initi-
ated when these stresses are relaxed by wall-loosening
events that cause load-bearing elements in the wall to
yield (Figure 17.10). The most likely candidate for the
load-bearing element is the xyloglucan linking two adja-
cent cellulose microﬁbrils. If the xyloglucan prevents
displacement of the microﬁbrils, then a loosening of the
xyloglucan cross link would constitute a stress relaxation
and allow the cellulose microﬁbrils to move apart. The
result would be a simultaneous and proportionate reduc-
tion in turgor pressure. A reduction in turgor pressure
leads to a decrease in the water potential of the cell
( becomes more negative), followed by the passive
uptake of water. The inﬂux of water in turn increases
cell volume, extends the cell wall, and tends to restore
both wall stress and turgor pressure. The process of cell
growth is thus seen as a continuous adjustment of turgor
pressure through stress relaxation in order to balance its
conﬂicting roles in water uptake and cell wall extension.
17.3.3 WALL LOOSENING AND CELL
EXPANSION IS STIMULATED BY
LOW PH AND EXPANSINS
It has been known since the 1930s that plant tissues
elongate faster when bathed in a medium with a low pH
(Figure 17.11). In the 1970s, a large body of work estab-
lished that this ‘‘acid-growth’’ phenomenon applied not
only to living tissues, but heat-killed tissues and iso-
lated cell walls as well. These experiments gave rise to
the concept of a wall-loosening enzyme with a low pH
optimum.
In the early 1990s, two cell wall proteins were
isolated and found to stimulate the expansion of cucum-
ber hypocotyl sections that had been heat-treated in

Chapter 17 / Growth and Development of Cells
order to inactivate endogenous wall-loosening activ-
ity. These proteins, called expansins, characteristi-
cally induce stress relaxation and extension of isolated
cell walls at low pH. Expansins are small proteins,
with a relative molecular mass of 26,000. In terms
of dry mass—one part protein per 5,000 parts cell
wall—they might be considered minor proteins. How-
ever, expansins are very active proteins and will induce
cell wall extension when added in amounts as low as 1
part expansin per 10,000 parts of cell wall. The response
is also very rapid—extension can be detected within
seconds of adding expansins to the cell wall test sys-
tem. In addition to stimulating extension of isolated
cell walls, expansins enhance the rate of growth when
applied to living cells. Moreover, expression of expansin
genes is highest in growing and differentiating tissues,
adding further weight to the hypothesis that expansins
are signiﬁcant wall-loosening agents.
Just how expansins achieve their unique effects
on the physical properties of cell walls is not yet
known, although two possibilities present themselves.
The ﬁrst possibility is that expansin hydrolyzes the
cross-linking glycans or other elements of the wall
matrix that hold the cellulose microﬁbrils in place. How-
ever, no hydrolytic activity on the part of expansins has
been demonstrated to date. There are known enzymes
whose activity is to hydrolyze components of the wall
matrix, but these enzymes do not induce stress relaxation
and extension. The second possibility is that expansins
attack and weaken the noncovalent bonds by which the
cross-linking glycans attach to the cellulose microﬁb-
rils. According to this proposal, expansin would migrate
along the surface of the cellulose microﬁbril and weaken
the attachment of the xyloglucan. The partial detach-
ment of a xyloglucan that was under tension would allow
it to relax. The cellulose microﬁbrils would then be dis-
placed in response to turgor until tension is reestablished
in the cross-link and new cross-links are formed. In this
way, expansin would not progressively weaken the cell
wall, but would catalyze an inchworm-like movement of
the wall polymers.
17.3.4 IN MATURING CELLS, A
SECONDARY CELL WALL IS
DEPOSITED ON THE INSIDE OF
THE PRIMARY WALL
When a cell stops enlarging and begins to mature, a
secondary cellulose wall is laid down on the inside of
the primary wall. Secondary walls are much thicker
and more rigid than primary walls. They contain up
to 45 percent cellulose, correspondingly lower amounts
of cross-linking glycans, and relatively little pectic sub-
stance. In thick-walled woody cells, the secondary wall
frequently consists of two distinct zones, characterized
by differing orientation of the microﬁbrils. In both zones
the microﬁbrils are oriented helically around the cell.
In the outermost layer, adjacent to the primary wall, the
microﬁbrils are oriented at a large angle to the long axis
of the cell. In the inner layer, the microﬁbrils are almost
parallel to the long axis. In some cells, such as ﬁbers, the
secondary wall may be so thick that only a very small
lumen, devoid of protoplasm, remains in the center at
maturity.
Most secondary walls also contain lignin, which
may account for as much as 35 percent of the dry weight
of woody tissues. Next to cellulose, lignin is probably
one of the most important biological substances in terms
of structural importance. Lignin is a plastic-like poly-
mer that has a high degree of strength, stronger even
than cellulose microﬁbrils. It is extremely resistant to
extraction without chemical degradation, which makes
its chemistry difﬁcult to study. It is known to consist of
a complex system of interlocking bonds between several
relatively simple phenolic alcohols. The combination of
cross-linked cellulose microﬁbrils embedded in a matrix
of pectic substances and lignin is responsible for the
exceptional strength of wood. In engineering terms,
secondary cell walls are a composite material, similar to
modern ﬁber-reinforced plastics and with many of the
same properties. The composite structure of cell walls is
what enables tall trees to withstand the stresses of high
winds and that makes wood such a useful and important
building material.
17.4 A CONTINUOUS STREAM
OF SIGNALS PROVIDES
INFORMATION THAT
PLANT CELLS USE TO
MODIFY DEVELOPMENT
Plant cell development is highly regulated by a variety
of signals that operate at several levels. Hormones are
chemical messengers that enable cells to communicate
with one another. Several classes of plant hormones,
including auxin, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid,
ethylene, and brassinosteroids, are known to promote
or inhibit various developmental responses, either singly
or in combination. Other intracellular factors such as
turgor, mineral status, and internal clocks may also cause
a cell to modify its metabolism and development.
Plant cells are also bombarded with external sig-
nals that provide information about their environment
and that are used to modulate development accordingly.
Light, temperature, gravity, and insect predation have
the most obvious and dramatic impact. Factors such as
magnetic ﬁeld, sound, and wind (a mechanical stimu-
lus) may have more subtle effects, but these have been
difﬁcult to establish experimentally. Other environmen-
tal factors such as soil moisture, humidity, nutrition,

17.4 A Continuous Stream of Signals Provides Information That Plant Cells Use to Modify Development
299
and pathogens may also inﬂuence development in some
cases. More recently it has become evident that air
and water pollutants represent not only an important
environmental challenge to plants but may modify devel-
opmental patterns as well.
17.4.1 SIGNAL PERCEPTION
AND TRANSDUCTION
A signal, regardless of whether it originates inside or
outside the plant, can have no effect unless there is a
receptor that allows it to be detected or perceived by
the cell. The presence or absence of the appropriate
receptor determines which cells are able to respond to a
particular signal. There must then be a mechanism that
converts, or transduces, the signal to some change in the
chemistry or metabolism of the cell, or gene expression,
that will ultimately give rise to the intended response.
All developmental signals, regardless of their nature,
share this sequence of signal perception, transduction, and
response.
There are two principal mechanisms for signal per-
ception and transduction. The ﬁrst involves a receptor
protein associated with the plasma membrane. The
receptor is both speciﬁc to the signal (e.g., hormone
molecule) and characteristic of the target cell. The
formation of a signal-receptor complex then sets into
motion a cascade of biochemical events that alters some
aspect of cellular metabolism. In the second mechanism,
the signal (e.g., a hormone molecule) is taken up by the
cell and migrates into the nucleus where it reacts with a
nuclear-based receptor to either activate or repress gene
expression.
The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.
The hormone auxin, for example, controls cell enlarge-
ment through a plasma membrane-based receptor while
it controls more complex developmental responses
through a nuclear-based receptor.
17.4.2 THE G-PROTEIN SYSTEM
IS A UBIQUITOUS
RECEPTOR SYSTEM
One receptor system that is proving to be ubiquitous in
plants and animals is the G protein-coupled receptor.
G-proteins are a large family of guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP) binding proteins that have long been
known for their role in the response of animal cells
to hormones, neurotransmitters, and a variety of other
signals that operate across the cell membrane. However,
recent genetic evidence from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza
sativa) has linked the presence of G proteins to signal
perception in plants as well (Figure 17.12).
The two major players in the G protein system are
the G protein itself, which consists of three distinct sub-
units (designated Gα, Gβ, and Gγ) and is located on the
cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, and a trans-
membrane protein known as the G-protein-coupled
receptor, or GPCR. GPCR is commonly referred to
either as a 7-trans-membrane (7TM) receptor or hep-
tahelical protein because the protein consists of seven
α-helix domains that span the membrane. The seven
helices are in turn connected by three hydrophilic loops
that extend into the aqueous environment on each of
the outer and inner surfaces of the membrane.
In effect, the G protein system functions as a bio-
chemical on/off switch. In the absence of a hormone
or other regulatory signal, the three subunits of the
G protein combine to form an inactive complex that is
located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. In
the inactive form (i.e., when the switch is ‘‘off ’’), the
Gα subunit carries a molecule of guanosine diphosphate

FIGURE 17.12 A model for signal transduction by the G
protein receptor system. In step 1, a signal molecule (the
ligand) binds to the transmembrane G protein coupled
receptor (GPCR), increasing its afﬁnity for the G pro-
tein (step 2). In step 3, the G protein exchanges its GDP
for GTP, which causes the dissociation of the Gα subunit
from the Gβγ dimmer and the release of both subunits
from the receptor (step 4). Both the Gα subunit and the
Gβγ dimer may bind to an effector, thus activating or
deactivating the effector (step 5). In step 6, the inher-
ent GTPase activity of Gα hydrolyses the GTP, which
deactivates Gα and allows the two subunits to recombine.

Chapter 17 / Growth and Development of Cells
(GDP). Signal transduction begins when a ligand (a
hormone or other small regulatory molecule) binds to
GPCR on the outer cell surface. Ligand binding causes
the GPCR molecule to alter its conformation, or shape,
such that it now has a higher afﬁnity for the G pro-
tein. The G protein binds to the cytoplasmic surface
of the receptor and the Gα subunit exchanges its GDP
for a molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The
G protein is now active, or ‘‘on.’’
In the next step, the activated G protein dissociates
from the receptor and the Gα subunit dissociates from
the combined Gβγ subunit. Each Gα and Gβγ subunit
is now free to activate an effector protein. Effectors
are enzymes that in turn control the amount of a sec-
ondary messenger produced or that regulate the ﬂow of
ions across membranes. Examples of effector molecules
include calmodulin, phospholipases, and protein and
lipid kinases discussed in the following sections. Gα
subunits also possess GTPase activity, so when the Gα
subunit has completed its job, the GTP is hydrolyzed to
GDP and inorganic phosphate. Following hydrolysis of
the GTP, the Gα subunit dissociates from the effector
protein and is free to recombine with a Gβγ subunit
and thus reform the inactive heterotrimeric complex. As
long as the GPCR itself remains activated, it can turn
on multiple G proteins, thereby amplifying the stream
of signals to the effector molecules. The study of G pro-
teins in plants is still in its infancy, but they have thus far
been implicated in signaling responses to gibberellins,
brassinosteroids, abscisic acid, and auxin.
17.5 SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION
INCLUDES A DIVERSE ARRAY
OF SECOND MESSENGERS
Signal perception is followed by a diverse array of bio-
chemical events, referred to as signal transduction or
signaling, that ultimately determines the cell’s response
to that signal. This often complex web of interacting
pathways usually involves a variety of small, mobile
molecules known as second messengers. The function
of a second messenger is to relay information from the
primary receptor to the biochemical machinery inside
the cell. Second messengers commonly amplify the orig-
inal signal by initiating a cascade of biochemical events.
The principal species of second messengers in plants
include protein kinase enzymes, calcium ions, and phos-
pholipid derivatives.
17.5.1 PROTEIN KINASE-BASED
SIGNALING
Protein kinases are enzymes that activate other pro-
teins by catalyzing their phosphorylation. The action of
protein kinases is balanced by the action of phosphatase
enzymes that deactivate the protein by removing the
phosphate group. Protein kinases are able to amplify
weak signals because one active kinase is able to phos-
phorylate hundreds of target proteins. Often speciﬁc
protein kinases act in series, creating a protein kinase
cascade. Protein kinases and kinase cascades have been
implicated in a wide array of plant signal transduction
pathways.
17.5.2 PHOSPHOLIPID-BASED
SIGNALING
Lipids are emerging as an important class of second
messengers. These second messengers are generated
by the action of enzymes known as phospholipases
that hydrolyze phospholipids. Recall that phospholipids
are a major constituent of cellular membranes. Four
different phospholipases are known: phospholipase A1
(PLA1), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C
(PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). Each of these
enzymes catalyzes the hydrolysis of a speciﬁc bond in
the phospholipid molecule as shown in Figure 17.13.
Virtually all of the products of phospholipase activ-
ity, including free fatty acids, appear to be involved in
further signaling chains.
Lipid-based signaling in plants can be illustrated by
the inositol triphosphate system. In this system, the
signal receptor-complex activates PLC, possibly involv-
ing a G protein (Figure 17.14). PLC catalyzes the release
of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG)
from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
bisphosphate (PIP2). Both IP3 and DAG are second mes-
sengers. IP3 diffuses into the cytoplasm where it activates
calcium channels and stimulates the release of calcium
from intracellular stores, most probably from the vac-
uole. In plants, DAG remains within the membrane
where it is immediately phosphorylated to phosphatidic

it stimulates the release of calcium. DAG is immedi-
ately phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid (PA) by the
plasma membrane lipid kinase DAG kinase. PA then
diffuses into the cytoplasm where it may also activate
ion channels or various effector proteins.
acid (PA). PA then diffuses into the cytoplasm where it
regulates ion channels or activates various enzymes.
17.5.3 CALCIUM-BASED SIGNALING
Calcium ions (Ca2) are involved in the regulation of
numerous physiological processes in plants, including
cell elongation and division, protoplasmic streaming,
the secretion and activity of various enzymes, hormone
action, and tactic and tropic responses. In order for cal-
cium to function effectively as a second messenger, the
cytosolic Ca2+ concentration must be low and under
metabolic control. Large amounts of calcium are stored
in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria, and
the large central vacuole but the cytosolic Ca2+ con-
centration is kept low largely through the action of
membrane-bound, calcium-dependent ATPases. Activ-
ity of the ATPase and, consequently, the cytoplasmic
Ca2+ concentration, is presumably under control of var-
ious stimuli such as light and hormones (Figure 17.15).
Calcium concentration throughout the cell is in part
regulated by calcium channels located in the plasma
membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuolar mem-
brane (tonoplast). Some channels, which control the
ﬂow of Ca2+ between compartments, are voltage-gated,
which means that their opening is determined by a
particular value of membrane potential. Others are
regulated either directly by signal receptors or by sec-
ond messengers such as inositol triphosphates or cyclic
nucleotides. Still others are able to sense tension in the
membrane and open in response to turgor or mechanical
stimuli such as touch and wind. Free Ca2+ also diffuses
very slowly in the cytosol—much more slowly than in
free solution. Because Ca2+ does not quickly disperse,
Ca2+ gradients are easily established and maintained.
The principal calcium receptor in plant and animal
cells is calmodulin, a highly conserved, ubiquitous
protein that can be isolated from a variety of higher
plants, yeasts, fungi, and green algae. Calmodulin from
several plant sources, including spinach, peanut, barley,
corn, and zucchini, has been well characterized, and
many of its properties are similar to calmodulin isolated
from bovine brain tissue. Plant and bovine calmodulin
have similar molecular mass (17 to 19 kDa), amino acid
composition, and calcium-binding properties. When it
binds with calcium, calmodulin undergoes a change in
conformation that allows it to recognize and activate
target proteins.
Several
classes
of
enzymes,
including
NAD+
kinases, protein kinases, and Ca2+-ATPases, are known
to be stimulated by calmodulin. NAD kinase catalyzes
the phosphorylation of NAD to NADP in the presence
of ATP. Because many redox enzymes are speciﬁc for
one of these cofactors, regulating the balance between
NAD and NADP is an effective way to regulate meta-
bolism. Similarly, as noted above, many other enzymes
are activated by protein kinase–catalyzed phospho-
rylation.

UBIQUITIN AND
PROTEASOMES—
CLEANING UP
UNWANTED
PROTEINS
At any given time, a plant cell may contain upward of
10,000 or more individual proteins. Many of these pro-
teins may no longer be required because the time of their
function has passed. Some may contain errors intro-
duced during their synthesis or may have been damaged
due to excessive heat or some other stress. Others, in
particular certain enzymes, may be short-lived by design
because they catalyze the ﬁrst or perhaps rate-limiting
step in a multistep metabolic sequence. Still others may
be key regulatory proteins, such as effectors of the cell
cycle, which depend on rapid turnover for maximum
effectiveness. Finally, ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of repressor proteins is now known to be a key step in
the regulation of gene transcription by hormones and
other developmental signals.
For all of these reasons, proteins are continually
subject to degradation by proteolytic enzymes called
proteases. Protein degradation is a form of cellular
housekeeping, in which unneeded or damaged proteins
are broken down and their component amino acids
recycled. Indeed, typically about half the protein com-
plement of a cell is replaced every 4 to 7 days. However,
proteases cannot be allowed uncontrolled access to cel-
lular protein or the result would be chaos. There must
be some mechanism both for controlling the access of
proteases to protein and for marking or identifying the
right proteins for degradation at the appropriate time.
Although protein is degraded in several cellu-
lar
compartments,
including
chloroplasts,
nuclei,
mitochondria, and vacuoles, the process as it occurs
in the cytosol is best understood. In the cytosol,
protein degradation is accomplished by two principal
components—a
small,
highly
conserved
protein,
ubiquitin, and a large, oligomeric enzyme complex,
the proteasome (Figure 17.16). The role of ubiquitin
is to mark a protein for degradation by forming a
conjugate with the target protein and delivering it to
the proteosome where the protein is degraded. This
is accomplished by the activity of three enzymes:
E1, E2, and E3. E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme,
activates the ubiquitin molecule with ATP. E2, the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, recruits the ubiquitin to
E3, the ubiquitin-protein ligase.

FIGURE 17.16 Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.
Through the action of a large, multienzyme complex,
a targeted protein is marked for degradation by tag-
ging the protein with ubiquitin. The complex consists
of three enzymes: (1) a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)
that forms a covalent bond with ubiquitin through a cys-
teine residue; (2) a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)
that transfers the covalently bound ubiquitin; and (3) a
ubiquitin-ligating enzyme (E3) that recognizes both the
target protein and the E2-ubiquitin complex. E3, also
known as the SCF complex, is composed of four subunits:
SKP1, cullin, RBX1, and an F-box protein. The F-box
protein recruits the target protein to the SCF complex
which then catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to the tar-
get protein. The action of E3 is repeated several times,
marking the target protein with a chain of four or more
ubiquitin molecules. The ubiquitin-protein complex is
then delivered to a 26S proteasome for degradation. The
proteasome consists of four stacked disks that form a
hollow cylinder. Not shown are two 19S regulatory pro-
teins that bind to the ends of the stack and direct the
ubiquitin-protein complex into the hollow, where the
protein-degrading active site is located.
There
are
several
different
kinds
of
ubiquitin-
protein ligases. In plants the most common kind
appears to be a multimeric protein called the SCF
complex. The complex is named for the ﬁrst three
subunits that were discovered: Skp1, cullin, and F-box
protein. Later a fourth subunit, RBX1, was identiﬁed.
Skp1, culllin, and Rbx 1 are common to all SCF
complexes. They, in effect, form a scaffold onto which
different F-box proteins can be assembled, each with
a unique substrate-speciﬁcity. The Arabidopsis genome,
for example contains nearly 700 putative F-box proteins.
An F-box protein typically contains a highly conserved
recognition site for the scaffold (the ‘‘F-box’’) and a

17.6 There is Extensive Crosstalk Among Signal Pathways
303
recognition site for a speciﬁc target protein which it
recruits to the SCF complex for ubiquitination. At least
some F-box proteins also contain a recognition site for
hormones or other developmental control factors.
Once the F-box protein has delivered the target
protein to the scaffold, the now complete SCF complex
then facilitates the transfer of the ubiquitin from E2
to the target protein. Additional ubiquitin molecules
are added to form a ubiquitin chain. Normally, four
ubiqitins are sufﬁcient, at which point the ubiquitinated
target protein is delivered to the proteasome.
The actual degradation of the protein is carried out
by the proteasome, a complex with a molecular mass
of more than 1.5 megadaltons (Mda). The proteasome
consists of two parts: a 20S core proteasome and two19S
regulatory complexes.1 Together the three parts make
up the active 26S proteasome. The core proteosome is
made up of four stacked rings with a central channel
that contains the active sites for proteolysis. The regu-
latory complex governs access to the channel, probably
unfolding the target protein and injecting it into the
channel for degradation. When a ubiquitinated protein
is delivered to the proteasome, the ubiquitin is released
to be reused as the target protein is inserted into the
proteasome for degradation.
1S values refer to the behavior of a complex with respect to
sedimentation in a centrifugal ﬁeld. It is dependent on the
shape and density of the complex.
calmodulin-dependent NAD and protein kinases have
been isolated from both soluble and membrane fractions
from a large number of plants.
17.5.4 TRANSCRIPTIONAL-BASED
SIGNALING
There is increasing evidence that some plant signals,
such as the light-sensitive pigment phytochrome and
some hormones, may by-pass plasma membrane recep-
tors in favor of nuclear receptors and direct intervention
in gene expression. They do this by diffusing into the
nucleus where they interact with speciﬁc transcription
factors.
Transcription factors are small, DNA-binding pro-
teins that control the transcription of messenger RNA
by binding to speciﬁc regulatory (i.e., noncoding) DNA
sequences in particular genes. Transcription factors
may either activate (or, up-regulate) the transcription
of that particular gene, or it may act to repress (or,
down-regulate) transcription. Some transcription fac-
tors have two binding sites: a DNA-binding site and a
binding site for a regulatory molecule. Binding of the
signal molecule, such as a hormone, to the transcrip-
tion factor induces changes in the expression of the
target gene. Exactly how these changes are brought
about has not yet been determined with any cer-
tainty. However, in the case of at least three signal
molecules—phytochrome and the two hormones auxin
and gibberellins—the evidence indicates the presence
of a transcription factor that, in the absence of the signal,
represses expression of the target gene. When this is the
case, it appears that binding of the signal molecule to
the transcription factor ﬂags the transcription factor for
degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system
(see Box 17.2). Degrading the repressor allows RNA
polymerase to bind with the promoter, thus enabling
full expression of the gene. These pathways will be
discussed more fully in later chapters.
17.6 THERE IS EXTENSIVE
CROSSTALK AMONG
SIGNAL PATHWAYS
Traditionally, signaling pathways were considered as
though each operated as an independent chain of events.
For example, the inositol triphosphate pathway was
thought to represent one signal pathway while another
used protein kinases and yet others used the G-protein
or calcium pathways. As more becomes known about
signal transduction pathways, it is increasingly appar-
ent that this view of segregated pathways is far too
simplistic. Signaling pathways more closely resemble
an interconnected web and established pathways are
linked by many connections, a situation commonly
referred to as crosstalk. The Oxford English Dictio-
nary deﬁnes crosstalk as ‘‘unwanted transfer of signals
between communication channels’’ but to the biolo-
gist crosstalk refers to interactions between and within
various classes of signals, the branching and merging
of transduction pathways, and common use of second
messengers—all of which help to coordinate develop-
mental signals. Thus three classes of hormones (auxin,
gibberellin, and brassinosteroids) stimulate hypocotyl
elongation, while two hormones (cytokinin and ethy-
lene) and light have an inhibitory effect. The extent of
these connections is not surprising when one recognizes
that there is a large number of rapidly changing envi-
ronmental signals that must be integrated with various

intrinsic control systems in order to execute a ﬁnely
tuned developmental program.
SUMMARY
The cell cycle describes in effect describes the history
of DNA and chromosomes during cell division. The
actual division of the cell into two daughter cells, or
cytokinesis, begins during the ﬁnal stages of mitosis
when the microtubules from the mitotic spindle reor-
ganize as the phragmoplast. The phragmoplast directs
Golgi-derived secretory vesicles to the equatorial plane
of the cell where new plasma membranes form and the
new crosswalls are laid down.
The driving force for cell enlargement is water
uptake. However, in order to prevent excessive water
uptake and to avoid rupturing the plasma membrane
due to high turgor pressure, plant cells are surrounded
by a very strong and relatively rigid wall. In order
for a cell to enlarge, the strength and rigidity of the
wall must be modiﬁed. In a turgid cell, the force
of water pressing against the wall generates stress
within the extensively cross-linked wall components.
Growth is initiated when these stresses are relieved by
wall-loosening events, which causes the load-bearing
cross-links between wall polymers to yield. Relieved of
stress, the wall expands, turgor is reduced, and more
water moves in until both turgor and wall stresses are
restored.
The orderly development of a complex multi-
cellular organism is coordinated by a combination
of intrinsic and extrinsic controls. Intrinsic controls
are expressed at both the intracellular and intercellu-
lar levels. Intracellular controls are primarily genetic,
requiring a programmed sequence of gene expression.
Intercellular controls are primarily hormonal, chemical
messengers that allow cells to communicate with one
another. Extrinsic controls are environmental cues such
as light, temperature, and gravity. Most environmen-
tal cues appear to operate at least in part by modifying
gene expression or hormonal activities.
All developmental stimuli are characterized by
a sequence of signal perception, signal transduction,
and response. Signal perception requires a recep-
tor molecule, which is normally a protein. Receptors
are now known for red and blue light, and most hor-
mones. Signal perception involves a diverse array of
interacting metabolic pathways. Prominent in these
pathways are small, mobile second messengers, such
as the G-proteins, lipid kinases, protein kinases, cyclic
nucleotides, calcium ion, and lipids. There is a high
degree of interaction between second messengers,
forming a complex web of signal transduction path-
ways.

Hormones I: Auxins
Multicellular plants are complex organisms and their
orderly development requires an extraordinary measure
of coordination between cells. In order to coordinate
their activities, cells must be able to communicate with
each other. The principal means of intercellular com-
munication within plants are the hormones. Hormones
are signal molecules that individually or cooperatively
direct the development of individual cells or carry infor-
mation between cells and thus coordinate growth and
development. Plant hormones have been the subject of
intensive investigation since auxin was ﬁrst discovered
almost a century ago.
The discussion of each hormone in this and subse-
quent chapters will begin with a review of biosynthesis
and metabolism. An understanding of hormone bio-
chemistry makes it easier to understand what kinds of
molecules they are and how they may function. In addi-
tion, a lot of what is known about what these molecules
do and how they do it is based on studies of mutants
that interfere with their biosynthesis or metabolism.
The metabolic turnover of hormone molecules is also a
signiﬁcant factor in the regulation of cellular activities.
This ﬁrst of four chapters on plant hormones is
devoted to auxin. The following chapters will cover
gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene, and
brassinosteroids. In the case of each hormone, we will
address the same three basic questions: what is it, what
does it do, and how does it do it?
Because this is the ﬁrst chapter on hormones, we
will begin with an introduction to the hormone concept
in plants. The balance of the chapter includes
•
the biochemistry and metabolism of auxins,
•
a review of auxin’s principal effects on growth and
development,
•
how auxin controls cell enlargement,
•
auxin transport in the plant, and
•
auxin control of genetic expression.
18.1 THE HORMONE CONCEPT
IN PLANTS
The concept of hormones, the chemical messengers that
enable cells to communicate with one another, arose in
the study of mammalian physiology. The latter half
of the nineteenth century witnessed exciting advances
in physiology and medicine. By 1850, it was known
that blood-borne substances originating in the testis
conditioned sexual characteristics. At the same time,
physicians pursuing clinical studies had become inter-
ested in the effect of glandular extracts and secretions
on the course of various diseases. By the turn of the cen-
tury, a number of substances that elicited speciﬁc effects
on the growth and physiology of mammals had been
305

306
Chapter 18 / Hormones I: Auxins
demonstrated and the concept that bodily functions
were coordinated by the production and circulation of
chemical substances was gaining wide acceptance. In
1905, the British physician E. H. Starling introduced
the term hormone (Gr., to excite or arouse) to describe
these chemical messengers.
Application of the hormone concept to plants may
be traced as far back as the observations of Duhamel
du Monceau in 1758. Du Monceau observed the forma-
tion of roots on the swellings that occur above girdle
wounds that interrupted the phloem tissues around the
stems of woody plants. In order to explain these and
similar phenomena, German botanist Julius Sachs (ca.
1860) postulated speciﬁc organ-forming substances in
plants. Sachs postulated that root-forming substances,
for example, produced in the leaves and migrating down
the stem, would account for the initiation of roots
above the wound. The real beginning of plant hormone
research, however, is found in a series of simple but
elegant experiments conducted by Charles Darwin (see
Box 18.1). It was Darwin’s observations and experi-
ments that ultimately led F. W. Went, almost half a
century later, to describe a hormonal-like substance as
the causative agent when plants grew toward the light.
At about the same time, H. Fitting introduced the term
hormone into the plant physiology literature.
What are hormones? Hormones are naturally
occurring, organic molecules that, at low concen-
tration, exert a profound inﬂuence on physiological
processes. In addition, hormones, as deﬁned by animal
physiologists, are (1) synthesized in a discrete organ or
tissue, and (2) transported in the bloodstream to a speciﬁc
target tissue where they (3) control a physiological
response in a concentration-dependent manner. While
there are many parallels between animal and plant
hormones, there are also some signiﬁcant differences.
Like animal hormones, plant hormones are naturally
occurring organic substances that profoundly inﬂuence
physiological processes at low concentration. The site
of synthesis and mode of transport for plant hormones,
however, is not always so clearly localized. Although
some tissues or parts of tissues may be characterized by
higher hormone levels than others, synthesis of plant
hormones appears to be much more diffuse and cannot
always be localized to discrete organs.
A hormone can serve effectively as a regulatory
signal only if the molecule has a limited lifetime within
the target cell. Any molecule sufﬁciently long-lived to be
used repeatedly would sacriﬁce its dynamic, regulatory
function. This means that the amount of a hormone in
a cellular pool must be closely regulated and exhibit a
rate of metabolic turnover that is rapid relative to the
response that it controls.
The amount of hormone available to a target cell
will be governed primarily by the rates at which active
hormone molecules enter (input) and exit (output)
the hormone pool. Hormones may enter the pool by
(1) de novo synthesis of the hormone, (2) retrieval of
active hormone from an inactive storage form, such
as a chemical conjugate, and (3) transport of hor-
mone into the pool from a site elsewhere in the plant.
Principal means for removing hormone from the pool
once it has acted include: (1) oxidation or some other
form of chemical degradation that renders the molecule
inactive or (2) synthesis of an irreversibly deactivated
conjugate. Clearly, in order to understand the dynamic
regulation of hormone activity in plants, it is essential
to know something of these inputs and outputs. No
understanding of hormone function can be complete
without a working knowledge of hormone biosynthesis
and metabolism.
18.2 AUXIN IS DISTRIBUTED
THROUGHOUT THE PLANT
Auxin (fr. G. auxein, to increase) is the quintessential
plant hormone. Auxin was the ﬁrst plant hormone to
be discovered and it has a principal role in the most
fundamental of plant responses—the enlargement of
plant cells. Auxin is synthesized in meristematic regions
and other actively growing organs such as coleoptile

DISCOVERING
AUXIN
The experimental beginnings of plant hormone research
in general and auxins in particular can be traced to the
work of Charles Darwin. Although Darwin is best known
for his work on evolution, later in his career he developed
an interest in certain aspects of plant physiology. Some
of these studies were summarized in the book The Power
of Movement in Plants, co-authored by his son, Francis.
One of several ‘‘movements’’ studied by the Darwins
was the tendency of canary grass (Phalaris canariensis)
seedlings to bend toward the light coming from a win-
dow, a phenomenon we now know as phototropism.
The primary leaves of grass seedlings are enclosed in
a hollow, sheath-like structure, called the coleoptile,
which encloses and protects the leaves as they grow up
through the soil. Darwin observed that coleoptiles, like
stems, respond to unilateral illumination by growing
toward the light source. However, curvature would not
occur if the tip of the coleoptile were either removed
or covered in order to exclude light. Since the bend-
ing response was observed over the entire coleoptile,
Darwin concluded that the phototropic signal was per-
ceived by the tip and ‘‘that when the seedlings are freely
exposed to lateral light, some inﬂuence is transmitted
from the upper to the lower part, causing the latter to
bend.’’ It was the implications of Darwin’s ‘‘transmis-
sible inﬂuence’’ that captured the imagination of plant
physiologists and set into motion a series of experiments
that culminated in the discovery of the plant hormone,
auxin—the ﬁrst plant hormone to be discovered.
Following the publication of Darwin’s book, a num-
ber of scientists conﬁrmed and extended their observa-
tions. In 1910, Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the
stimulus would pass through an agar block and was
therefore chemical in nature. In 1918, Paal showed
that if the apex were removed and replaced asymmet-
rically, curvature would occur even in darkness. In the
climate of the time—Baylis and Starling’s character-
ization of animal hormones had appeared only a few
years earlier—plant physiologists were quick to inter-
pret these observations as strong support for a plant
hormone.
The active substance was ﬁrst successfully isolated
in 1928 by F. W. Went, then a graduate student work-
ing in his father’s laboratory in Holland. Following up
on the earlier work of Boysen-Jensen and Paal, Went
removed the apex of oat (Avena sativa) coleoptiles and
stood the apical pieces on small blocks of agar. Allowing
a period of time for the substance to diffuse from the
tissue into the agar block, he then placed each agar
block asymmetrically on a freshly decapitated coleop-
tile. The substance then diffused from the block into
the coleoptile, preferentially stimulating elongation of
the cells on the side of the coleoptile below the agar
block. Curvature of the coleoptile was due to differ-
ential cell elongation on the two sides. Moreover, the
curvature proved to be proportional to the amount of
active substance in the agar. Went’s work was partic-
ularly signiﬁcant in two respects: ﬁrst, he conﬁrmed
the existence of regulatory substances in the coleop-
tile apex, and second, he developed a means for isolation
and quantitative analysis of the active substance. Because
Went used coleoptiles from Avena seedlings, his quanti-
tative test became known as the Avena curvature test.
Substances active in this test were called auxin, from the
Greek auxein (to increase).
The results of Went’s studies naturally stim-
ulated intensive efforts to isolate and identify the
active substance. One particularly active compound,
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), was isolated from human
urine in 1934. This peculiar source was selected because
it was suspected that female sex hormones, secreted
in urine, might have some plant growth activity. In
a beautiful piece of scientiﬁc serendipity, the impure
urine preparation initially assayed was highly active,
while
subsequently
puriﬁed
hormone
preparations
were inactive. This led the investigators back to the
material from which the female sex hormones were
initially extracted—the urine of pregnant women—and
the identiﬁcation of IAA. At the same time, IAA was
isolated from yeast extracts, and the following year,
from cultures of Rhizopus suinus. IAA was isolated from
immature corn kernels in 1946 and since then has been
found to be ubiquitous in higher plants.
apices, root tips, germinating seeds, and the apical buds
of growing stems (Figure 18.1). Young, rapidly growing
leaves, developing inﬂorescences, and embryos follow-
ing pollination and fertilization are also signiﬁcant sites
of auxin synthesis. Auxin, more than any other growth
substance, appears to be actively distributed throughout
the entire plant.
18.3 THE PRINCIPAL AUXIN IN
PLANTS IS INDOLE-3-
ACETIC ACID (IAA)
Although a large number of compounds have been
discovered with auxin activity, indole-3-acetic acid

308
Chapter 18 / Hormones I: Auxins
(IAA) is the most widely distributed natural auxin
(Figure 18.2). In addition to IAA, several other natu-
rally occurring indole derivatives are known to express
auxin
activity,
including
indole-3-ethanol,
indole-
3-acetaldehyde, and indole-3-acetonitrile. However,
these compounds all serve as precursors to IAA and
their activity is due to conversion to IAA in the tissue.
The initial discovery of IAA in plants and recogni-
tion of its role in growth and development stimulated
the search for other chemicals with similar activity. The
result has been an array of synthetic chemicals that
express auxin-like activity. One of these chemicals was
indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (IV, Figure 18.2). More
recently, IBA has been isolated from seeds and leaves
of maize and several other species. A chlorinated analog
of IAA (4-chloroindoleacetic acid, or 4-chloroIAA; II,
Figure 18.2) has also been reported in extracts of legume
seeds and a closely related, naturally occurring aromatic
acid, phenyl acetic acid (PAA) (III, Figure 18.2) has
recently been reported to have auxin activity. Because
IBA, 4-chloroIAA, and PAA have now been isolated from
plants, are structurally similar to IAA, and elicit many of
the same responses as IAA, there is a strong argument for
considering them natural hormones. However, it is not
yet clear whether they are active on their own or whether
they are ﬁrst converted to IAA. Chemically, the single
unifying character of molecules that express auxin activ-
ity appears to be an acidic side chain on an aromatic ring.
FIGURE 18.2 The chemical struc-
tures of some naturally occurring
and synthetic auxins. Indole-3-acetic
acid (I) is believed to be the active
auxin in all plants. Phenylacetic acid
(III) is widespread and two oth-
ers, 4-chlorindole-3-acetic acid and
indole-3-butyric acid, have been iden-
tiﬁed in plant extracts. The latter three
induce auxin responses when applied
exogenously, but probably act via con-
version to IAA. Structures VI, VII, and
VIII are active herbicides.

18.4 IAA is Synthesized from the Amino Acid l-Tryptophan
309
The amount of IAA present will depend on a num-
ber of factors, such as the type and age of tissue and its
state of growth. In vegetative tissues, for example, the
amount of IAA generally falls in the range between 1 μg
and 100 μg (5.7 to 570 nanomoles) kg−1 fresh weight,
but in seeds it appears to be much higher. In one study,
it was estimated that the endosperm of a single maize
seed four days after germination contains 308 picomoles
(pmole = 10−12 mole) of IAA. At the same time, the
maize shoot contained 27 pmoles of IAA and required
an estimated input of approximately 10 pmoles of IAA
hr−1 in order to support its growth. The high level of
IAA in the seed apparently serves to support the rapid
growth of the young seedling when the seed germinates.
18.4 IAA IS SYNTHESIZED FROM
THE AMINO ACID
l-TRYPTOPHAN
Since the 1930s, when K. V. Thimann ﬁrst observed
the synthesis of IAA in the mold Rhizopus suinus, which
had been fed the amino acid tryptophan, the conversion
of tryptophan to IAA has been studied in vivo in more
than 20 different plant species and in vitro with at
least 10 different cell-free enzyme preparations. The
synthesis of IAA is normally studied by feeding plants
tryptophan carrying a radioactive label, usually carbon
(14C) or tritium (3H), and examining the radioactivity of
subsequently isolated IAA or its intermediates.
Feeding experiments are complicated by several
factors and the results must always be approached
with caution. For example, radiolabeled tryptophan
can apparently undergo radiochemical decomposition,
thus giving rise to IAA by nonenzymatic reactions. In
addition, the pool size of tryptophan (also a precursor
for protein synthesis) is very large relative to that of
IAA and there is little data on the actual quantity of
IAA synthesized. Finally, care must be taken to ensure
that experiments are conducted under sterile conditions,
since many microorganisms readily convert tryptophan
to IAA. While these complications make it difﬁcult to
ascertain the exact pathway that functions in vivo, the
available evidence clearly establishes that plants are able
to synthesize IAA from tryptophan.
In
most
plants,
synthesis
of
IAA
occurs
in
three steps, beginning with the removal of amino
group on the tryptophan side chain. The product is
indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) (Figure 18.3). This reaction
is catalyzed by tryptophanamino transferase, a widely
distributed multispeciﬁc enzyme that appears to act as
well to remove amino groups from structural analogs
of tryptophan such as phenylalanine and tyrosine.
The second step is the decarboxylation of IPA to
form indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). The enzyme that
catalyzes this step, indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase,

has been described in several plant tissues and cell-free
extracts. Finally, IAAld is oxidized to IAA by a
NAD-dependent
indole-3-acetaldehyde
oxidase.
The presence of this enzyme has been demonstrated
in a number of tissues, including oat coleoptile. IAAld
may also be reversibly reduced to indole-3-ethanol.

310
Chapter 18 / Hormones I: Auxins
Indole-3-ethanol is active in bioassays using stem
sections, but this is probably due to its conversion
to IAA in the tissue. Finally, IAA can be reversibly
converted to IBA by the enzyme indole-3-butyric acid
synthase.
There is some evidence for alternate biosynthetic
pathways involving intermediates other than IPA, but
the burden of biochemical evidence indicates that the
IPA pathway is the principal pathway for the synthesis
of IAA from tryptophan in higher plants. Although
IAA-deﬁcient mutants might be expected to provide
further useful information, none have been identiﬁed to
date. This is perhaps because an IAA deﬁciency would
probably be lethal.
18.5 SOME PLANTS DO NOT
REQUIRE TRYPTOPHAN
FOR IAA BIOSYNTHESIS
Evidence
for
the
biosynthesis
of
IAA
via
a
tryptophan-independent pathway has been obtained
from mutants of both maize and Arabidopsis. Seedlings
of the orange pericarp (orp) mutant of Zea mays lack the
enzyme tryptophan synthase, which catalyzes the ﬁnal
step in tryptophan synthesis (see Figure 18.3). Although
seeds carrying the orp mutation germinate normally,
they do not survive because of their diminished capacity
for tryptophan synthesis. The IAA content of mutant
seedlings, however, is as much as 50-fold higher than
that of wildtype seedlings. Several tryptophan-requiring
mutants have also been isolated from Arabidopsis. Two
of these mutants, trp2 and trp3, also lack tryptophan
synthase and are unable to convert indole-3-glycerol
phosphate to tryptophan. The trp2 and trp3 seedlings,
unlike orp, do not accumulate free IAA but they do
contain elevated levels of conjugated IAA (see below).
Apparently, trp2 and trp3 store excess IAA in the
conjugated form. Radioisotope-labeling experiments
in both maize and Arabidopsis have conﬁrmed that the
IAA is synthesized from some precursor other than
tryptophan.
The precise pathway for tryptophan-independent
IAA synthesis is not known. However, the trp2 and trp3
Arabidopsis mutants do accumulate indole-3-acetonitrile.
Arabidopsis also contains the nitrilase enzymes necessary
for
converting
indole-3-acetonitrile
to
IAA,
thus
implicating indole-3-acetonitrile as an intermediate.
The source of indole-3-acetonitrile is not known,
although
its
accumulation
in
tryptophan
mutants
suggests a tryptophan-independent pathway for the
biosynthesis of indole-3-acetonitrile as well. It is
known that indole-3-acetonitrile can be derived from
glucobrassicin, the principal glucosinolate present
in members of the family Cruciferae. Details of the
tryptophan-independent indole-3-acetonitrile pathway
for auxin biosynthesis and whether it is limited to
Arabidopsis or the brassicas, or is more widespread,
remain to be determined.
18.6 IAA MAY BE STORED AS
INACTIVE CONJUGATES
Very early in the study of auxins, two populations of
the hormone were recognized—one was free-moving
and could be obtained by diffusion into agar; the other
appeared to be bound in the cell and could be isolated
only by extraction with solvents or by hydrolysis under
alkaline conditions. This latter population, referred to
as ‘‘bound auxin,’’ is now recognized as IAA that has

formed chemical conjugates with sugars to form glyco-
syl esters. Conjugates are formed by esteriﬁcation of
a glucose or inositol molecule to the acid group of the
side chain (Figure 18.4). IAA-glycosyl conjugates are
themselves inactive but they do release free, biologically
active IAA upon solvent extraction, alkaline hydrolysis,
or enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo.
Although quantitative data are lacking for most
plants, large pools of IAA glycosyl esters have been
demonstrated in seeds of Zea mays. These pools of
IAA conjugates are formed in the milky endosperm
as the seed develops and appear to be an important
source of active hormone for the embryo during the
ﬁrst few days of germination. It has been estimated,
for example, that as much as 60 percent of the IAA
requirement of a germinating maize shoot may be met
by hydrolysis of IAA conjugates initially supplied by
the endosperm. Since most of our knowledge of IAA
release by hydrolysis of conjugates comes from studies
with germinating seeds, it is not yet known whether
conjugate hydrolysis is equally important in the growth
of mature plants.
18.7 IAA IS DEACTIVATED BY
OXIDATION AND
CONJUGATION WITH
AMINO ACIDS
IAA in aqueous solution is relatively unstable and is
readily degraded by a variety of agents, including acids,
ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, and visible light, the
latter especially in the presence of sensitizing pigments
such as riboﬂavin. IAA degradation in situ, however,
appears primarily due to oxygen and peroxide, either
separately or in combination, in the presence of a suitable
redox system.
Inactivation of the Avena growth-promoting sub-
stance by aqueous extracts of leaves was ﬁrst reported
in the 1930s, even before the active principle was iden-
tiﬁed as IAA. An enzyme responsible for inactivating
IAA was ﬁrst isolated from plant extracts in the 1940s
and was called IAA oxidase. Later, the enzyme per-
oxidase, in concert with a ﬂavoprotein, was shown
to catalyze the oxidation of IAA while at the same
time releasing CO2. The oxidative decarboxylation of
IAA by peroxidase is now known to be synonymous
with IAA oxidase. In vitro oxidative decarboxylation
of IAA has been studied most extensively with puriﬁed
horseradish peroxidase. Because the end products of IAA
oxidation are physiologically inactive, IAA oxidation is
an effective way of removing the hormone molecule
once it has accomplished its purpose. More recent
studies with green tomato fruits, Vicia faba, and other
species have shown that conjugation of IAA with amino
acids such as alanine or aspartic acid also leads to irre-
versible deactivation (Figure 18.4).
18.8 AUXIN IS INVOLVED IN
VIRTUALLY EVERY STAGE
OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT
Auxins are characterized principally by their capacity to
stimulate cell elongation in excised stem and coleoptile
sections, but they are also involved in a host of other
developmental responses, including secondary root ini-
tiation, vascular differentiation, and the development
of axillary buds, ﬂowers, and fruits. Auxins are also an
important component in the signal chain that enables
roots and shoots to respond to gravity and unilateral
light. In fact, auxin is involved in virtually every stage of
plant growth and development from the organization of
the early embryo to ﬂowering and fruit development.
18.8.1 THE PRINCIPAL TEST FOR
AUXINS IS THE STIMULATION
OF CELL ENLARGEMENT IN
EXCISED TISSUES
Regulation of cell enlargement in Avena coleoptiles was
the basis for its discovery and this action has been
demonstrated repeatedly with excised plant tissues such
as subapical coleoptile tissues and stem segments cut
from dark-grown pea seedlings.
Auxin concentration-response curves typically show
an increasing response with increasing concentrations
of auxin until an optimum concentration is reached
(Figure 18.5). Concentrations exceeding the optimum
characteristically result in reduced growth. If the auxin
concentration is high enough, growth may be inhibited
compared with controls.
Another characteristic feature of auxin physiology
is that intact stems and coleoptiles do not show a signiﬁ-
cant response to exogenous application of the hormone.
Apparently the endogenous auxin content of intact tis-
sues is high enough to support maximum elongation and
added auxin has little or no additional effect. Thus, it
is a general rule that the effect of exogenously supplied
auxin on cell enlargement can be demonstrated only in
tissues that have been removed from the normal auxin
supply. These include excised segments of stems and
coleoptiles or tissues cultured on artiﬁcial media.
18.8.2 AUXIN REGULATES VASCULAR
DIFFERENTIATION
In addition to stimulating cell enlargement, auxin also
has a role in regulating cellular differentiation. The most
extensively studied system is the induction of vascular
differentiation in shoots, which is under control of auxin

produced in the young, rapidly developing leaves. The
production of xylem strands at the base of a Coleus
petiole, for example, is directly proportional to the
stream of diffusible IAA moving through the petiole.
Defoliation of Coleus epicotyls strongly reduces xylem
differentiation in the petiole, but this effect can be
reversed by applying equivalent amounts of IAA in
lanolin paste.
A favorite system for the study of vascular dif-
ferentiation is the regeneration of vessels and phloem
sieve tubes around wounds in Coleus stems, which is
also under the control of auxin (Figure 18.6). Coleus,
like other members of the mint family (Lamiaceae), has
characteristic square stems with a vascular bundle at each
corner. If a wedge-shaped incision is made that inter-
rupts one of these vascular bundles, parenchyma cells in
the region of the wound will differentiate into new vas-
cular elements. These vascular elements will eventually
reestablish continuity with the original bundle.
The differentiation of both xylem elements and
phloem sieve tubes around the wound is limited and con-
trolled by auxin supply. This can be shown by removal
of leaves (a source of auxin) above the wound, for
example, which reduces vascular regeneration. On the
other hand, because auxin moves preferentially down
the stem, removal of leaves below the wound has lit-
tle or no effect. Furthermore, the extent of vascular
regeneration is directly proportional to the auxin supply

dinal view of regenerated xylem vessel elements around
a wound (W) in a decapitated internode of cucumber
(Cucumis sativus). Lanolin containing 0.1 percent IAA
was applied to the upper side of the internode immedi-
ately after wounding. Polar regeneration is indicated by
the dense appearance of many xylem tracheary elements
(arrow) in the region of the damaged vascular bundle
above the wound. This is the region where the basipetally
ﬂowing IAA would initially accumulate because it was
interrupted by the wound and forced to ﬁnd a new path-
way around the obstacle. (Magniﬁcation: × 60) (Photo-

when exogenous auxin is substituted for the leaves. In
general, differentiation of phloem sieve tubes is favored
by low auxin concentrations (0.1% IAA w/w in lanolin)
while xylem differentiation is favored by higher auxin
concentrations (1.0% IAA w/w in lanolin).
Auxin is also required for vascular differentiation
in plant tissue culture. When buds, which are a source
of auxin, are implanted into clumps of undifferenti-
ated callus tissue in culture, differentiation of callus
parenchyma into vascular tissue occurs in regions adja-
cent to the implant. The same effect is achieved when
agar wedges containing IAA and sugars are substituted
for the implanted bud.
18.8.3 AUXIN CONTROLS THE
GROWTH OF AXILLARY BUDS
As a shoot continues to grow and the apical meristem
lays down new leaf primordia, small groups of cells
in the axil (the angle between the stem and the leaf
primordium) of the primordia become isolated from the
apical meristem and produce an axillary bud. In some
cases, such as the bean (Phaseolus), the bud continues to
grow, although at a much slower rate than the apical
bud. In many plants, however, mitosis and cell expansion
in the axillary bud is arrested at an early stage and the
bud fails to grow. It has been known for some time
that removal of the shoot apex, a common horticultural
technique for producing bushy plants, stimulates the
axillary bud to resume growth (Figure 18.7). Apparently
the apical bud is able to exert a dominant inﬂuence that
suppresses cell division and enlargement in the axillary
bud. For this reason, the phenomenon of coordinated
bud development is known as apical dominance.
Shortly after auxin was ﬁrst discovered, K. V.
Thimann and F. Skoog questioned whether there might
be a relationship between the capacity of the shoot tip
to release auxin and its capacity to suppress axillary bud
development—in other words, is apical dominance con-
trolled by auxin? Thimann and Skoog tested this idea
by decapitating broad bean (Vicia faba) plants and apply-
ing auxin to the cut stump. Axillary bud development
remained suppressed in the presence of auxin. Since this
initial demonstration, the capacity of auxin to substitute

COMMERCIAL
APPLICATIONS
OF AUXINS
Hormones and other regulatory chemicals are now used
in a variety of applications where it is desirable for
commercial reasons to control some aspect of plant
development.
The synthetic auxins are used in commercial appli-
cations largely because they are resistant to oxida-
tion by enzymes that degrade IAA. In addition to
their greater stability, the synthetic auxins are often
more effective than IAA in speciﬁc applications. One
of the most widespread uses of auxin encountered
by the consumer is the use of 2,4-D in weed con-
trol. 2,4-D and other synthetic compounds, such as
2,4,5-T and dicamba, express auxin activity at low con-
centrations, but at higher concentrations are effective
herbicides.
The introduction of 2,4-D and 4-chlorophen-
oxyacetic acid (4-CPA) as herbicides in 1946 revo-
lutionized our approach to agriculture. For reasons
that are not clear, chlorinated phenoxyacetic acids are
selectively toxic to broadleaf species. 2,4-D remains
the principal component of ‘‘weed-and-feed’’ mixtures
for home lawn care as well as for control of broadleaf
weeds in cereal crops. The synthetic auxins are favored
in commercial applications because of their low cost
and greater chemical stability.
Indolebutyric acid and naphthaleneacetic acid are
both widely used in vegetative propagation—the prop-
agation of plants from stem and leaf cuttings. This
application can be traced to the propensity for auxin to
stimulate adventitious root formation. Generally mar-
keted as ‘‘rooting hormone’’ preparations, the auxins,
usually a synthetic auxin such as NAA or IBA, are mixed
with an inert ingredient such as talcum powder. Stem
cuttings are dipped in the powder prior to planting in a
moist sand bed in order to encourage root formation.
4-CPA may be sprayed on tomatoes to increase
ﬂowering and fruit set while NAA is commonly used to
induce ﬂowering in pineapples. This latter effect is actu-
ally due to auxin-induced ethylene production. NAA is
also used both to thin fruit set and prevent preharvest
fruit drop in apples and pears. These seemingly opposite
effects are dependent on timing the auxin application
with the appropriate stage of ﬂower and fruit develop-
ment. Spraying in early fruit set, shortly after the ﬂowers
bloom, enhances abscission of the young fruits (again,
due to auxin-induced ethylene production). Thinning is
necessary in order to reduce the number of fruits and
prevent too many small fruits from developing. Spraying
as the fruit matures has the opposite effect, preventing
premature fruit drop and keeping the fruit on the tree
until it is fully mature and ready for harvest.
The use of synthetic auxins, especially the chlori-
nated forms, as herbicides has come under close scrutiny
by environmental groups because of potential health
hazards. 2,4,5-T, for example, has been banned in
many jurisdictions because commercial preparations
contain signiﬁcant levels of dioxin, a highly carcinogenic
chemical.
for the shoot tip in maintaining apical dominance has
been conﬁrmed repeatedly.
How does auxin from the shoot apex suppress axil-
lary bud development? The most widely accepted theory
holds that the optimum auxin concentration for axillary
bud growth is much lower than it is for the elongation
of stems. The stream of auxin ﬂowing out of the shoot
apex toward the base of the plant is thought to maintain
an inhibitory concentration of auxin at the axillary bud.
Removal of this auxin supply by decapitation reduces
the supply of auxin in the region of the axillary bud
and thereby relieves the bud of inhibition. More direct
evidence for the role of auxin transport is offered by
the observation that inhibitors of auxin transport (TIBA
and NPA) stimulate release of buds from dominance
when applied to the stem between the shoot apex and
the bud. In addition, lines of tomato that exhibit proliﬁc
branching (that is, the absence of apical dominance)
also fail to export radioactively labeled IAA from the
shoot apex.
18.9 THE ACID-GROWTH
HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINS
AUXIN CONTROL OF CELL
ENLARGEMENT
Whatever its primary action, auxin can alter the rate
of cell expansion only by ultimately inﬂuencing one
or more of the parameters previously identiﬁed in
equation 17.1 (Chapter 17). An increase in growth rate,
for example, would require an increase in wall exten-
sibility (m), an increase in turgor pressure (P), or a
decrease in yield threshold (Y). (Hydraulic conductance,
L, of the plasma membrane depends on the presence
of aquaporins and is not normally a limiting parame-
ter.) Direct measurements of P, using a micropressure
probe, have indicated that turgor pressure does not
change signiﬁcantly during auxin-stimulated increase in
the growth rate of pea stem sections. Although Y cannot
be measured directly, the results of indirect tests indicate

18.9 The Acid-Growth Hypothesis Explains Auxin Control of Cell Enlargement
315
that yield threshold does not change either. That leaves
extensibility, m. Extensibility is difﬁcult to assess. It is on
the one hand a rate coefﬁcient, but it is also a measure of
the capacity of cell walls to undergo irreversible (plastic)
deformation. A number of tests to measure extensibility
have been devised. Whichever the method, however, the
answer is invariably the same—the induction of rapid
cell enlargement by auxin is accompanied by a large and
rapid increase in wall extensibility.
The role of low pH in cell enlargement was intro-
duced in Chapter 17. At the same time that this
relationship between acid pH and cell enlargement was
becoming clear, it was also discovered that auxin would
cause growing cells to excrete protons. Several lines
of evidence indicate that proton secretion is central
to auxin-enhanced cell enlargement. (1) With Avena
coleoptiles the pH of the apoplastic, or cell wall, solu-
tion drops from 5.7 to 4.7 within 8 to 10 minutes of
auxin application. This lag period is consistent with
the lag period observed between auxin addition and the
beginning of the growth response. (2) Auxin-stimulated
proton secretion is an energy-dependent process inhib-
ited by both metabolic inhibitors and inhibitors of
auxin-induced growth. (3) If the wall space of coleoptile
sections is inﬁltrated with neutral buffers to prevent
pH change, auxin-induced growth is almost completely
prevented. (4) Agents other than auxin that cause pro-
ton excretion have an effect similar to auxin on the
promotion of growth. One such agent is fusicoccin, a
phytotoxin from the fungus Fusicoccum amygdali, which
causes cells to excrete protons at a great rate.
In 1970, R. Cleland and D. Rayle proposed a
simple but rather provocative theory to explain auxin-
stimulated increases in cell wall extensibility. They sug-
gested that auxin causes acidiﬁcation of the cell wall envi-
ronment by stimulating cells to excrete protons. There
the lower pH activates one or more wall-loosening
enzymes, which have an acidic pH optimum. At
about the same time, A. Hager, working in Germany,
published a similar proposal but went further to suggest
that auxin stimulated proton excretion by activating a
plasma membrane–bound ATPase proton pump. The
combined Cleland-Hager proposals are known as the
acid-growth hypothesis. Although the acid-growth
hypothesis has been tested in relatively few tissues (it has
been tested thoroughly only in Avena coleoptiles), the
evidence is generally supportive. In its present form, the
acid-growth hypothesis proposes that auxin activates
ATP-proton pumps located in the plasma membrane
(Figure 18.8A). The resulting acidiﬁcation of the cell
wall space lowers the pH toward the optimum range for
expansin activity. Increased expansin activity, in turn,

increases wall extensibility and allows for turgor-induced
cell expansion as described earlier in Chapter 17.
Although auxin does enhance the activity of
ATPase-proton
pumps
in
the
plasma
membrane,
auxin itself does not bind to the ATPase. Therefore,
there must be an auxin receptor that initiates a signal
transduction chain linking the presence of auxin with
increased ATPase activity. A putative auxin receptor
has been isolated from maize (Zea mays), but details of
the signal transduction chain itself remain obscure.
The maize auxin receptor is membrane-associated
protein designated ABP1 (Auxin-Binding Protein 1).
ABP1 is a 43 kDa glycoprotein dimer of 22 kDa subunits
that has a high afﬁnity for IAA. ABP1 has been local-
ized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, but small
populations are also found associated with the plasma
membrane and in the cell wall. ABP1 is a prime candi-
date for the auxin receptor that mediates cell elongation,
although the evidence for this role is indirect. Perhaps
the most compelling evidence comes from experiments
with antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by
the immune system of an animal in response to the pres-
ence of antigens. Antibodies will bind with the antigen,
usually a ‘‘foreign’’ protein, to render that protein inac-
tive. Antibodies (designated IgG) can be raised against
plant proteins by injecting puriﬁed protein into an ani-
mal such as a mouse or rabbit. Antibodies are a useful
tool because of the speciﬁcity of the antibody–antigen
reaction. Antibodies can also be ‘‘tagged’’ with ﬂuores-
cent chemicals or other markers so that their location
can be readily visualized by microscopy. Antibodies
raised against the auxin-binding protein (designated
IgG-antiABP) speciﬁcally inhibit both auxin-induced
coleoptile elongation and auxin-induced hyperpolar-
ization of the plasma membrane. Also, IgG-antiABP
applied to coleoptile sections was localized in the outer
epidermal cells, which are believed to be the most
auxin-responsive cells in the coleoptile.
The suggestion that ABP1 is the auxin-receptor
has attracted some controversy. The principal difﬁ-
culty has to do with the location of ABP1 in the
cell. ABP1 is found predominantly in the lumen of
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and some investiga-
tors have been unable to detect any ABP1 at the
plasma membrane. ABP1 even contains amino acid
sequences at either end of the molecule that are typ-
ical of proteins normally retained within the lumen
of the ER. However, more sensitive immunolocaliza-
tion techniques have now conﬁrmed a small population
(perhaps 1000 molecules) on the plasma membrane of
maize protoplasts. A second problem is that, based on
amino acid sequence, the ABP1 protein appears to have
no lipophilic membrane-spanning domain. To recon-
cile these observations, it has been proposed that ABP1
forms a complex with a transmembrane docking protein.
According to this model, the docking protein provides
the necessary lipid solubility to anchor ABP1 to the
membrane. The ABP1-docking protein complex is then
exported from the ER to the plasma membrane where it
is inserted with ABP1 facing the outside (Figure 18.8B).
It has been proposed that the ABP1-docking protein
complex is itself inactive, but attachment of an auxin
molecule activates the complex and initiates the signal
transduction pathway. The proposed docking protein
has yet to be identiﬁed, but there is some suggestion
that it might be a GCPR receptor in the family of
G-proteins (Chapter 17).
Auxin also activates the enzyme phospholipase A2
(PLA2) and several experiments have implicated PLA2
in the signal transduction chain. For example, activa-
tion of PLA2 can be blocked by IgG-antiABP. Also,
both lysophospholipids and fatty acids (the products
of PLA2) stimulate proton secretion and elongation.
These effects are inhibited by vanadate, which specif-
ically blocks the plasma membrane proton-ATPase.
These data suggest that PLA2 follows ABP1 in the
chain and that lysophospholipids and fatty acids appear
further along. Finally, both the IAA and lysophospho-
lipids effects on proton secretion and elongation can
be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that
the lipids activate the proton-ATPase with the involve-
ment of a protein kinase cascade. A model illustrating
how these components might interact is presented in
Figure 18.8B.
18.10 MAINTENANCE OF
AUXIN-INDUCED GROWTH
AND OTHER AUXIN
EFFECTS REQUIRES GENE
ACTIVATION
The acid-growth hypothesis does not alone resolve the
question of how auxin regulates cell growth, let alone
more complex developmental problems such as cell
maturation and differentiation. One difﬁculty is that
green stem sections, which respond to auxins, do not
respond well (if at all) to acids. Another difﬁculty is
that exogenous acid induces only a transitory growth
stimulation of coleoptiles. Neither acid nor fusicoccin is
effective after the ﬁrst 30 to 60 minutes. Auxin-induced
growth kinetics show an initial rapid increase in the
growth rate that reaches a maximum within 30 to
60 minutes. This initial burst is followed by a steady
or gradually declining rate over the next 16 hours
(Figure 18.9). The most plausible explanation for such
a two-phase response curve is that the acid-growth
response is limited primarily to the rapid initial growth
response. Additional auxin-regulated factors must then
be required for the maintenance of growth over the
longer term, including the well-deﬁned progression
of cells through the sequence division →expansion

→maturation →differentiation. These additional fac-
tors involve the transcription of genes and synthesis of
growth-promoting proteins.
Auxin rapidly and speciﬁcally stimulates the tran-
scription of a set of genes known as primary auxin
responsive genes. These include both SAUR (small
auxin upregulated RNAs) and AUX/IAA. SAUR genes
encode short, relatively unstable RNA transcripts. In
soybean hypocotyls, the expression of SAUR genes
appears to be localized in tissues that normally respond
to auxin and the RNA transcripts can be detected
within 2 to 3 minutes of auxin application—even before
auxin-induced elongation can be observed. Further-
more, an asymmetrical distribution of SAUR transcripts
has been detected in gravity-stimulated seedlings. The
asymmetry correlates with the differential cell elonga-
tion in responding seedlings, but can be detected even
before any visible signs of curvature. Finally, several
auxin-resistant mutants in Arabidopsis show low levels of
SAUR expression in response to auxin treatment.
AUX/IAA genes are induced over a period of 4 to
30 minutes following application of auxin. This is a
large family of genes—there are at least 29 differ-
ent AUX/IAA genes in the Arabidopsis genome—that
function as transcriptional regulators. The AUX/IAA
proteins do not bind directly with DNA, but exert
their regulatory effect by interacting with other proteins
called the auxin response factor (ARF). ARFs bind to
the promoter region of auxin-responsive genes and may
act either to activate or to repress gene expression. Since
AUX/IAA proteins repress the activity of ARFs, they
may act as either positive or negative regulators.
Early studies indicated that many of these respon-
sive genes could also be induced by the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. This observation suggests that
these genes may be controlled by short-lived repressor
proteins that normally prevent transcription. Accord-
ing to one model, auxin was thought to initiate the
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of these repressor pro-
teins. This model was conﬁrmed with the discovery of
the TIR1 gene in Arabidopsis. Originally identiﬁed in a
genetic screen for auxin transport inhibitors (hence its
name Transport Inhibitor Response 1), it was soon shown
that TIR1 is a soluble, nuclear-located auxin-receptor
protein that works in conjunction with auxin to derepress
the transcription of auxin-responsive genes.
TIR1 is an F-box protein (see Chapter 17, Box 17.3,
for the role of F-box proteins). However, in addition
to having a recognition site that allows it to bind with
the SCF scaffold, TIR1 also has a recognition site for
auxin. A recent study of the crystal structure of TIR1 has
shown that on the surface of the protein there is a pocket
that accommodates the AUX/IAA peptide. However, the
afﬁnity of TIR1 for AUX/IAA is very low unless an auxin
molecule is also present. The auxin molecule sits at the
bottom of the pocket where it simultaneously interacts
with both proteins. Auxin thus serves as a ‘‘molecu-
lar glue’’ that enhances TIR1-AUX/IAA binding. Once
both the auxin and AUX/IAA proteins are in place, TIR1
is then able to link with the SCF complex for subse-
quent ubiquitination and degradation of the repressor by
the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway (Figure 18.10).
Removal of the AUX/IAA repressor protein derepresses
the auxin-responsive gene, allowing the gene to proceed
with the transcription of messenger RNA and, as a con-
sequence, translation of auxin-induced proteins. Auxin
appears to modulate development through depression of
auxin-responsive genes, not through a simple activation.
As a side note, it is interesting that the crystal-
lographic studies now make it easier to answer the
long-standing question—‘‘What makes an auxin?’’
Essentially any molecule that ﬁts into the TIR1
binding pocket to enhance TIR1-AUX/IAA interaction
will qualify as an auxin. The relative effectiveness of
different auxin molecules depends on how well they ﬁt
in the pocket.

FIGURE 18.10 A model for auxin-induced gene derepres-
sion. (1) Auxin response factor protein (ARF) binds to
the DNA in the promoter region of an auxin-responsive
gene, but gene transcription is prevented by the presence
of AUX/IAA repressor protein. When auxin levels are
elevated, the auxin (A) combines with a nuclear-located
auxin receptor, TRI1, to form an auxin-TRI1 complex
(2). Auxin increases the afﬁnity of TRI1 for AUX/IAA and
facilitates the dissociation of AUX/IAA from the ARF (3).
Removal of the AUX/IAA proteins from the ARF dere-
presses the gene (4), allowing transcription of mRNA
and the translation of auxin-induced proteins, including
AUX/IAA (5). Meanwhile, TRI1 recruits AUX/IAA to the
E3 ubiquitin-ligating enzyme, or SCF complex (6), where
(7) AUX/IAA is polyubiquitinated. The ubiqitinated pro-
tein is then recruited to the 26S proteasome (8), where
it is degraded. The result is that when auxin levels are
high, TIR1 facilitates active transcription of mRNA by
continuously removing repressor protein. When auxin
levels are low, TIR1 is unable to bind with the repressor,
the repressor protein accumulates, and transcription is
shut down.
there appears to be a steady stream of auxin ﬂowing
down the shoot into the root. At least in Arabidopsis
seedlings, some of this stream apparently moves down
a concentration gradient in the phloem. A signiﬁcant
portion, however, moves through a complex, highly
regulated polar transport mechanism.
Polar transport was originally described based on
preferential movement either up or down in grass
coleoptiles, stems, and roots (Figure 18.11). When
movement is away from the morphological apex toward
the morphological base of the transporting tissue, the

coleoptile section is inverted, as shown in Figure 18.11,
the original direction of movement is maintained. How-
ever, as more is learned about auxin transport, the more
evident it becomes that directed auxin transport may be
lateral as well as up and down.
Polar transport of auxin in shoots tends to be pre-
dominantly basipetal at a velocity somewhere between
5 and 20 mm hr−1. Acropetal transport in shoots is
minimal. In roots, on the other hand, there appear to
be two transport streams. An acropetal stream, arriving
from the shoot, ﬂows through xylem parenchyma cells
in the central cylinder of the root and directs auxin
toward the root tip. A basipetal stream then reverses the
direction of ﬂow, moving auxin away from the root tip,
or basipetally, through the outer epidermal and cortical
cell ﬁles.
The phenomenon of polar auxin transport has
attracted widespread attention because of the assump-
tion that auxin concentration is an important variable
in several developmental responses. Auxin gradients due
to polar transport have been invoked to explain, at least
in part, developmental phenomena such as apical dom-
inance, adventitious and secondary root formation, and
differential growth responses to light and gravity. The
ﬂow of auxin in the root, for example, is intimately
involved in the root response to gravity and will be
covered in a later chapter.

First,
it
can
be
shown
that
polar
transport
is
inhibited
by anaerobiosis or by respiratory poisons such as
cyanide and 2,4-dinitrophenol. This is considered
evidence that polar transport is an energy-requiring
process dependent on oxidative metabolism in the
mitochondrion.
Second,
certain
chemicals,
called
phytotropins, have been known for some time to be
speciﬁc, noncompetitive inhibitors of polar transport.
These
include
TIBA
(2,3,5-triiodobenzoic
acid),
morphactin (9-hydroxyﬂuorine-9-carboxylic acid), and
NPA (N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid) (Figure 18.12). It
is presumed that such inhibitors block auxin transport
by binding to discrete carrier molecules that are
involved in polar transport system. Third, the uptake
of radioactive IAA is at least partially inhibited by
nonradioactive IAA. This latter observation indicates
that the labeled IAA and unlabeled IAA compete with
each other for a ﬁnite number of carrier sites.
These observations formed the basis for the
chemiosmotic model for auxin transport, proposed by
P. H. Rubery, A. R. Sheldrake, and J. A. Raven in the
mid-1970s. In its present form, the chemiosmotic model
contains three essential features: (1) a pH gradient
or proton motive force across the plasma membrane
that provides the driving force for IAA uptake, (2) an
IAA inﬂux carrier, and (3) an IAA efﬂux carrier that is
preferentially located at the base of auxin-transporting
cells (Figure 18.13). The principles of the chemiosmotic
model may be summarized as follows. IAA is a weakly
acidic, lipophilic molecule. Depending on the pH, IAA
may exist in either the protonated form (IAAH) or
the unprotonated, anionic form (IAA−). The cell wall
space is moderately acidic with a pH of about 5.5. At
that pH, approximately 20 percent of the IAA will be
protonated (IAAH). Consequently, the cell wall space
will contain both anionic and protonated IAA. Based
on its lipid solubility, a small proportion of uncharged
IAAH molecule would be expected to diffuse slowly
across the plasma membrane from the cell wall space

FIGURE 18.13 The chemiosmotic-polar diffusion model
for polar transport of IAA. In the acidic cell wall space
(pH 5.5) approximately 20% of the IAA is protonated.
Protonated IAA (IAAH) may enter cells by diffusion
across the cell membrane (dashed arrows) while the
anionic form (IAA−) may be taken up through AUX1 (cir-
cles), a proton/IAA symport carrier located randomly in
the plasma membrane. Inside the cell (pH 7.0) the depro-
tonated form IAA−will dominate. IAA−can exit the cell
only through efﬂux carriers of the PIN family (squares)
which are located preferentially at the base of the cell.
Membrane-bound ATPase-proton pumps help to main-
tain the appropriate pH differential across the membrane
and provide protons for IAA/H+ symport. The uniquely
basal location of the efﬂux carriers is the key to polar
transport.
into the cell. The bulk of the IAA, however, will enter
the cell as IAA−through an H+/auxin symport carrier
(the inﬂux carrier) that is uniformly distributed around
the cell.
Once in the cytoplasm, where the pH is closer to
7.0, IAAH will dissociate to IAA−and H+. The auxin
is now trapped inside the cell because IAA−can not
readily diffuse across the membrane. The key to the
chemiosmotic model, however, is the existence of a
carrier, located only in the basal membranes of the cell,
which mediates the efﬂux of IAA−from the cell. It is
the unique location of this efﬂux carrier, more than any
other single factor, which establishes polarity in auxin
transport.
The ﬁrst direct evidence for the existence of a basal
efﬂux carrier took advantage of the fact that the puta-
tive IAA-transport protein binds the phytotropin NPA.
The NPA-binding protein was isolated, antibodies were
raised against it, and the antibodies subsequently labeled
with the ﬂuorescent dye ﬂuorescein in order to make

320
Chapter 18 / Hormones I: Auxins
the antibodies visible under the microscope. When pea
stem sections were treated with the labeled antibodies,
ﬂuorescein was found to be localized on the basal plasma
membranes of the stem cells.
More recently, largely due to studies of auxin
mutants of Arabidopsis, two good candidates for auxin
inﬂux and efﬂux carriers have been identiﬁed. The
putative inﬂux carrier is a membrane protein, AUX1.
The AUX1 gene has been linked to auxin metabolism
and transport because mutations at that locus exhibit
IAA-resistant root growth, reduced lateral root initia-
tion, and reduced response of the root to gravity. Such
a phenotype is consistent with a reduced capacity to
take up IAA. The AUX1 gene has been cloned and the
polypeptide sequence of the protein is similar to that of
known amino acid permeases. Amino acid permeases are
membrane proteins that function as amino acid/proton
symport carriers. The protein homologies together with
the structural similarities between IAA and its precursor
amino acid, tryptophan, have led to the suggestion that
the AUX1 protein functions as an auxin/proton sym-
porter. Further support for this model is offered by the
observation that the synthetic auxin NAA restores the
gravitropic response to mutant (aux1) seedlings. NAA
uptake by cells is not carrier-mediated, so the loss of
AUX1 does not interfere with the response.
A family of genes, the PIN genes, that encode puta-
tive auxin efﬂux carriers have also been identiﬁed. (A
total of eight PIN genes have now been identiﬁed in
Arabidopsis.) One of the ﬁrst to be discovered is the PIN1
gene that controls ﬂower development in Arabidopsis.
The pin1 mutant is characterized by inﬂuorescences that
terminate in pinlike structures and show little or no evi-
dence of ﬂoral bud development. Polar auxin transport
is signiﬁcantly reduced in mutant pin1 inﬂuorescences
and the characteristics of the mutant can be mimicked
by blocking polar transport with phytotropins. As pre-
dicted by the chemiosmotic model, ﬂuorescent-labeled
antibodies have demonstrated that PIN1 protein is local-
ized in the basal membranes of xylem parenchyma cells.
Moreover, in keeping with the chemiosmotic model,
AUX1 and PIN1 proteins are located at opposite ends
of young root phloem cells (protophloem).
A second gene is variously called PIN2, EIR1,
WAV6, or AGR1. The several names are due to the
fact that the gene was identiﬁed independently in dif-
ferent laboratories, all studying mutants with impaired
root response to gravity. PIN2 was so named because
it encodes a protein that is very similar to the protein
encoded by PIN1. As with the PIN1 protein, immunolo-
calization experiments have shown that the PIN2 pro-
tein is localized in the basal membranes (i.e., furthest
from the root tip) of cell ﬁles in the root cortex and epi-
dermis. Moreover, like AUX1, the structure of the PIN
proteins resembles the bacterial amino acid permeases
and hence is a likely candidate for an IAA transporter.
Polarity in auxin transport is fundamental to plant
development and PIN proteins direct this transport by
moving from one cell surface to the other, in keeping
with changing demands for auxin asymmetry. One prob-
lem, for example, that has long puzzled developmental
biologists is how the apical-basal axis is established in
young embryos. PIN proteins appear to part of the key.
Immediately after the ﬁrst division of the zygote, PIN
proteins located acropetally in the basal cell direct the
ﬂow of auxin into the apical cell, specifying that cell as
the founder of the proembryo. As the apical cells pro-
liferate to form the globular embryo stage, they begin
to synthesize auxin themselves. The PIN proteins then
shift to a basipetal location and the direction of auxin
ﬂow reverses, thereby establishing the position of the
developing root pole. Similar changing patterns of PIN
distribution and the resulting changes in the polarity of
auxin transport are equally important in other responses
such as secondary root initiation and the responses of
shoot and roots to gravity and unilateral illumination,
which will be covered in detail in a later chapter.
SUMMARY
Hormones are numerous naturally occurring chemical
substances that profoundly inﬂuence, at micromo-
lar concentrations, the growth and differentiation of
plant cells and organs. The effectiveness of a hormone
depends on maintaining a closely regulated pool size,
which is accomplished by a balance of biosynthesis,
storage as inactive conjugates, and catabolic degrada-
tion of the molecule.
Auxins are characterized by their capacity to stim-
ulate elongation in coleoptile and stem segment but are
involved in virtually every aspect of plant development,
including seed germination, vascular differentiation,
lateral bud development, secondary root initiation, the
response of roots and shoots to gravity, and ﬂower and
fruit development.
A large number of synthetic compounds express
auxin activity, but indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is thought
to be the only naturally occurring auxin. In most plants
IAA is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan
although the study of tryptophan-requiring mutants
has established that in some plants, such as Arabidop-
sis, IAA is synthesized via a tryptophan-independent
pathway. IAA can be stored as chemical conjugates
such as glycosyl esters, which will release active IAA on
enzymatic hydrolysis. Glycosyl esters are an important
source of IAA during seed germination. Once IAA has
accomplished its purpose, it can be removed by peroxi-
dation to inactive products or conversion to amino acid
conjugates. Auxins may be transported in the phloem
or cell-to-cell by polar transport. The key to polar

transport is the location of efﬂux carriers on speciﬁc
cell walls.
The role of auxin in cell enlargement is best
described by the acid-growth hypothesis. Central to
this hypothesis is the activity of expansins; enzymes
that weaken cross-links between cellulose molecules,
increase wall extensibility, and allow for turgor-induced
cell expansion. Auxin also acts to derepress genes by
targeting repressor proteins for degradation by the
26S proteasome pathway, a process that accounts for
auxin-induced developmental responses.

Hormones II: Gibberellins
Gibberellins are members of a large and varied family
of plant constituents known as the terpenoids. Terpenes
are normally recognized on the basis of their chemical
structure, which may be dissected into one or more
5-carbon isoprene units. Gibberellins are thus biosyn-
thetically related to the carotenoid pigments, sterols,
latex, and other isoprene derivatives that will be dis-
cussed later. Gibberellins are noted for their capacity
to stimulate hyper-elongation of intact stems, especially
in dwarf plants and rosettes. They are also promi-
nently involved in seed germination and mobilization
of endosperm reserves during early embryo growth, as
well as leaf expansion, pollen maturation, ﬂowering, and
fruit development. This chapter describes
•
the biochemistry and metabolism of gibberellins,
•
a review of gibberellins’ principal effects on growth
and development, and
•
gibberellin receptors and the gibberellin signaling
chain.
19.1 THERE ARE A LARGE
NUMBER OF GIBBERELLINS
Gibberellins are a large class of molecules. In fact, more
than 135 have now been identiﬁed in higher plants and
fungi and additional members are added almost every
year. Only a few of these are biologically active in their
own right. The others are either intermediates in the
biosynthetic pathway or products of inactivation. It is
worth noting, however, that the number of gibberellins
found in any one species or organ may be very small
and the number of active gibberellins smaller yet. It is
believed, for example, that GA1 and GA4 are the prin-
cipal naturally occurring, active gibberellins in higher
plants.
All
gibberellins
are
diterpenes
based
on
the
20-carbon ent-gibberellane structure (Figure 19.1).
A little more than one-third of the gibberellins
characterized to date have retained the full complement
of 20 carbon atoms and are known as C20-gibberellins.
The others have lost carbon atom number 20 and
are consequently known as C19-gibberellins. With a
complex ring structure and the number of possible
substitutions on 19 or 20 carbon atoms, it is not difﬁcult
to see how there could be such a large number of
gibberellins.
Gibberellins that are demonstrated to be naturally
occurring and that have been chemically characterized
are assigned an ‘‘A’’ number. This number does not
imply chemical relationships; it is assigned roughly in
order of discovery. A C20-gibberellin commonly known
as gibberellic acid was one of the ﬁrst to be isolated
and characterized. Because GA3 is readily extracted
from fungal cultures, it is also the most common

commercially available form. GA1, GA3, and GA4, all of
which promote vegetative growth, are the most active
gibberellins and, consequently, the most widely used in
gibberellin research.
There are certain structural requirements for GA
activity. A carboxyl group at carbon-7 is a feature of
all GAs and is required for biological activity, and
C19-GAs are more biologically active than C20-GAs.
In addition, those GAs with 3-β-hydroxylation, 3-β,13-
dihydroxylation, or 1,2-unsaturation are generally more
active; those with both 3-β-OH and 1,2-unsaturation
exhibit the highest activity.
19.2 THERE ARE THREE
PRINCIPAL SITES FOR
GIBBERELLIN
BIOSYNTHESIS
It is generally accepted that there are three principal
sites of gibberellin biosynthesis: (1) developing seeds
and fruits, (2) the young leaves of developing apical
buds and elongating shoots, and (3) the apical regions
of roots. Immature seeds and fruits are prominent sites
of gibberellin biosynthesis. This is based on the obser-
vation that young fruits, seeds, and seed parts contain
large amounts of gibberellins, particularly during stages
of rapid increase in size. In addition, cell-free prepara-
tions from many seeds, such as wild cucumber (Marah
macrocarpus) and pea (Pisum sativum), are able to actively
synthesize gibberellins. The site of gibberellin biosyn-
thesis may be the developing endosperm (as it is in
the cucurbits), the young cotyledons of legumes, or
the scutellum of cereal grains. As the seed matures,
metabolism appears to shift in favor of gibberellin-sugar
conjugates.
It is not as easy to obtain clear evidence that gib-
berellin biosynthesis occurs in shoots and roots. This
is partly because gibberellin levels are much lower in
vegetative tissues. Vegetative tissues also yield cell-free
preparations that are less active, suggesting that enzyme
levels for gibberellin metabolism are also lower than
for reproductive tissues. Gibberellin synthesis in vege-
tative tissues is generally supported by the occurrence
of gibberellins in tissue exudates and the effects of
inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis. Gibberellins are
apparently derived from fundamental precursors that
are synthesized in chloroplasts (Section 19.3), which is
consistent with the synthesis of gibberellins in green
leaves. On the other hand, application of the inhibitor
(2-chloroethyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CCC,
an ‘‘antigibberellin’’) to roots rapidly decreases the

BOX 19.1
DISCOVERY OF
GIBBERELLINS
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies, Japanese rice farmers grew concerned about a
disease that seriously reduced the yield of their crops.
Plants infected with the bakanae (‘‘foolish seedling’’)
disease exhibited weak, elongated stems and produced
little or no grain. Japanese plant pathologists, interested
in developing means for controlling the disease, soon
established a connection with the presence of a fungus,
Gibberella fujikuroi. In 1926, E. Kurosawa reported the
appearance of symptoms of the disease in uninfected
rice plants that had been treated with sterile ﬁltrates
from cultures of this fungus. By 1938, Japanese investi-
gators had isolated and crystallized the active material,
which they called gibberellin after the genus name for the
fungus.
Gibberellin did not come to the attention of West-
ern plant physiologists until after the 1939–1945 war,
when two groups—one headed by Cross in England
and one by Stodola in the United States—isolated and
chemically characterized gibberellic acid from fungal cul-
ture ﬁltrates. At the same time, Japanese workers isolated
three gibberellins, which they named gibberellin A1, gib-
berellin A2, and gibberellin A3. Gibberellin A3 proved
to be identical with gibberellic acid. The known effect
of gibberellins on rice and several other plant systems
indicated that similar substances might be present in
higher plants as well. The ﬁrst higher-plant gibberellin
to be characterized was isolated from immature seeds of
runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) and found to be iden-
tical with gibberellin A1. Since then, gibberellins have
been shown to be ubiquitous in higher plants.
amount of gibberellin appearing in exudates. Further-
more, removal of the root apices from seedlings of scarlet
runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) results in decreased
shoot growth and the disappearance of GA1. It remains
possible that the synthesis of gibberellin precursors is
not limited to chloroplasts, but occurs in other forms of
plastids as well.
19.3 GIBBERELLINS ARE
TERPENES, SHARING A
CORE PATHWAY WITH
SEVERAL OTHER
HORMONES AND A WIDE
RANGE OF SECONDARY
PRODUCTS
Terpenes are a functionally and chemically diverse
group of molecules. With nearly 15,000 structures
known, terpenes are probably the largest and most
diverse class of organic compounds found in plants.
This large diversity arises from the number of basic
units in the chain and the various ways in which they
are assembled. Formation of cyclic structures, addi-
tion of oxygen-containing functions, and conjugation
with sugars or other molecules all add to the possible
complexity.
The
terpene
family
includes,
in
addition
to
the
gibberellins,
the
hormones
abscisic
acid
and
brassinosteroids, the carotenoid pigments (carotene
and xanthophyll), sterols (e.g., ergosterol, sitosterol,
cholesterol)
and
sterol
derivatives
(e.g.,
cardiac
glycosides), latex (the basis for natural rubber), and
many of the essential oils that give plants their
distinctive odors and ﬂavors. Cytokinin hormones and
chlorophyll, although not terpenes per se, do contain
terpenoid side chains.
The distinguishing feature of terpenes and terpene
derivatives is that they may be viewed as polymers
of the simple 5-carbon unit 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene,
or isoprene (Figure 19.2). Consequently, terpenes are
often referred to as isoprenoid compounds. The actual
building blocks for terpenoids, however, are not iso-
prene itself, but two phosphorylated derivatives known
as iso-pentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its iso-
mer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAP). IPP is
a product of two different biosynthetic pathways, one
located in the cytoplasm and one located in chloroplasts
(Figure 19.3).
The cytoplasmic pathway for IPP synthesis begins
with acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), an interme-
diate in the respiratory breakdown of carbohydrate
and

metabolism.
Three
molecules
of
acetyl-CoA condense in a two-step reaction to form

is the ﬁrst committed precursor for terpenes and this
pathway is therefore known as the mevalonic acid
pathway. Mevalonic acid then undergoes a two-step
phosphorylation, at the expense of two molecules
of ATP, to form C6 mevalonic acid pyrophosphate.
Removal of a carboxyl group converts mevalonic acid
pyrophosphate to the C5 compound IPP, which is
reversibly isomerized to DMAP.
The chloroplast pathway begins with the conden-
sation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and pyru-
vic acid to form deoxyxylulose phosphate, a 5-carbon
molecule. Deoxyxylulose phosphate is then reduced to
methylerythrltol-4-phosphate (MEP). MEP is sub-
sequently phosphorylated and oxidized to form IPP.
Like the synthesis of IPP, the subsequent synthesis
of terpenes is highly compartmentalized. In general,
sesquiterpenes (C15), triterpenes (C30), and polyter-
penes such as latex and other large molecules are
produced in the cytosolic compartment while isoprene (a
5-carbon volatile organic hydrocarbon), monoterpenes

nate in plastids (Figure 19.4). In either case, the synthesis
begins with the isomerization of IPP to DMAP. DMAP
is, in effect, a reactive primer molecule that initiates
chain formation by condensation with a molecule of
IPP. Elongation of the chain then continues with the
repetitive addition of IPP catalyzed by prenyltransferase
enzymes. The distinction between cytosolic and plastid
products is largely dependent on the compartmental-
ization of speciﬁc prenyltransferase enzymes. FPP is a
branch point that can give rise to other C15 sesquiter-
penes and, by head-to-head condensation of two C15
units, the C30 triterpenes (e.g., sterols). GGPP is a sec-
ond branch point, giving rise to linear C20 diterpenes,
cyclic diterpenes (including the gibberellins), and, by
head-to-head condensation of two C20 units, the C40
tetraterpenes (e.g., carotenoid pigments).

CH3→CH2OH→CHO→COOH to form kaurenoic
acid. The oxidation of kaurene to kaurenoic acid is
inhibited by ancymidol, another dwarﬁng agent. The
ﬁnal two steps involve a hydroxylation at carbon-7 and
contraction of the B ring with extrusion of carbon-7 to
form GA12-7-aldehyde.
The enzymes that convert ent-kaurene to GA12-7-
aldehyde are all NADPH-dependent, membrane-bound
cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. The cytochrome
P450 family is an interesting and important group
of enzymes. They are generally noted for their lack
of substrate speciﬁcity and are involved in numerous
biosynthetic as well as degradative pathways in plants
and animals. In mammals they are used to detoxify the
liver by converting hydrophobic compounds to more
hydrophilic derivatives that are more readily excreted.
As noted above, GA12-7-aldehyde is the ﬁrst com-
pound with the true gibberellane skeleton and is the
precursor to all other gibberellins. Oxidation of the
aldehyde group on carbon-7 to a carboxyl group gives
GA12. This carboxyl group is a feature of all GAs and is
required for biological activity. C19-GAs arise by sub-
sequent oxidative elimination of carbon-20. While the
biosynthetic pathway up to GA12-7-aldehyde is the same
in all plants, subsequent pathways can vary substantially
from genus to genus or even in different tissues in the
same plant. A brief summary of demonstrated intercon-
versions among gibberellins in pea seed and seedlings is
presented in Figure 19.6 simply as one example. Simi-
lar pathways for biosynthesis of gibberellins have been
demonstrated in cell-free endosperm and embryo prepa-
rations from pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) or inferred
from the knowledge of native gibberellins in Arabidopsis.
The 13-hydroxylation pathway (bold arrows) leading to
GA20 and GA1 is probably of widespread occurrence in
higher plants.

There are several mechanisms for deactivating gib-

pool. The principal mechanism, however, appears to be
the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 2 position,
which renders the gibberellin inactive. Other inactiva-
tion products are possible, depending on the species. In

amounts of GA4, GA5, GA6 (all C19 GAs), and GA37 and
GA38 (C20 GAs) are also found. Mature seeds, however,
contain mainly GA8-glucoside, with smaller amounts of
glucosyl esters of GA1, GA4, GA37, and GA38. In maize
(Zea mays) the biologically inactive GA8 is further con-
verted to GA8-glucoside, which is also inactive. In pea
(Pisum sativum), however, GA8 is oxidized to a 2-keto
derivative referred to as a GA8 catabolite.
19.6 GROWTH RETARDANTS
BLOCK THE SYNTHESIS
OF GIBBERELLINS
Since the 1950s, a number of synthetic compounds
known as growth retardants have been developed. These
compounds, also known as antigibberellins, have found
commercial use, particularly in the production of orna-
mental plants. Growth retardants may be applied to
potted plants either as a foliar spray or soil drench. The
principal effect of growth retardants is to reduce stem
elongation, resulting in plants that are shorter and more
compact, with darker green foliage. Flower size, how-
ever, is unaffected. Because individual growth retardants
block speciﬁc steps in gibberellin biosynthesis, they have
also found use as tools in physiological research.

Chapter 19 / Hormones II: Gibberellins
AMO-1618 and phosphon are antigibberellins that
inhibit enzymes involved in the synthesis of kaurene
while
ancymidol
blocks
the
subsequent
oxidation
of kaurene to kaurenoic acid. The effects of these
inhibitors can be reversed by the application of
gibberellins, such as GA20 or GA3. Another inhibitor,
known as BX-112, blocks the 3β-hydroxylation of
GA20 to GA1. In those plants where GA1 is the active
gibberellin, the effects of BX-112 can be reversed only
by the application of GA1 itself.
19.7 GIBBERELLIN TRANSPORT
IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD
Gibberellin transport studies have been conducted
largely by application of radioactively labeled GAs
to either stem or coleoptile sections. Gibberellins
have been detected in both the phloem and xylem
saps. Transport of gibberellins does not appear to be
polar, as it is with auxin, but moves along with other
phloem-translocated organic materials according to
a source-sink relationship. Whether gibberellins are
actually transported in the xylem is not clear; they
could end up there simply by lateral translocation from
the phloem. On the other hand, it is likely that any
gibberellins synthesized in the root tip are distributed
to the aerial portions of the plant through the xylem
stream. It is not known whether gibberellins are
transported as free hormones or in conjugated form.
19.8 GIBBERELLINS AFFECT
MANY ASPECTS OF PLANT
GROWTH AND
DEVELOPMENT
Since the discovery of gibberellins, it has been clear
that this hormone regulates stem elongation and the
mobilization of endosperm reserves during the early
stages of seed germination. In addition, largely through
studies of GA-deﬁcient mutants, gibberellins have been
implicated in a wide range of other developmental
responses such as ﬂowering and ﬂower development,
root and fruit growth, the development of seeds in the
fruit, de-etiolation, and the initiation of leaf primordia
in meristems.

COMMERCIAL
APPLICATIONS OF
GIBBERELLINS
The principal commercial use of gibberellins is in the
production of table grapes, such as the ‘‘Thompson
Seedless.’’ A gibberellin spray in the early stages of
ﬂowering thins the cluster by stimulating elongation of
the ﬂoral stems. This spreads the ﬂowers out, allowing
for the development of larger fruit. Larger fruit size is
encouraged by a second spray at time of pollination and
fruit set. Gibberellins have also been used to enhance
germination and stimulate early seedling emergence and
growth in species such as grape, citrus, apples, peach, and
cherry. Treatment of cucumber plants with gibberellin
will promote formation of male ﬂowers, which is useful
in the production of hybrid seed. The GA-induced
α-amylase in barley aleurone has led to widespread use
of GA in the malting industry where it is used to speed
up malt production.
The inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis also has
commercial applications. The growth of many stems
can be reduced or inhibited by synthetic growth retar-
dants or antigibberellins. These include AMO-1618,
cycocel (or, CCC), Phosphon-D, ancymidol (known
commercially as A-REST), and alar (or, B-nine). Growth
retardants mimic the dwarﬁng genes by blocking spe-
ciﬁc steps in gibberellin biosynthesis, thus reducing
endogenous gibberellin levels and suppressing internode
elongation. These compounds have found signiﬁcant
commercial use, particularly in the production of orna-
mental plants. Growth retardants may be applied to
potted plants either as a foliar spray or soil drench.
Their principal effect is to reduce stem elongation,
resulting in plants that are shorter and more com-
pact, with darker green foliage. Flower size, however,
is unaffected. Commercial ﬂower growers have found
these inhibitors useful in producing shorter, more com-
pact poinsettias, lilies, and chrysanthemums, and other
horticultural species.
In some areas of the world, wheat tends to ‘‘lodge’’
near harvest time, that is, the plants become top-heavy
with grain and fall over. Spraying the plants with anti-
gibberellins produces a shorter, stiffer stem and thus
prevents lodging. Antigiberellins also have been used to
reduce the need for pruning of vegetation under power
lines.

19.8 Gibberellins Affect Many Aspects of Plant Growth and Development
331
hyper-elongation
of
stem
tissue
remains
one
of
the more dramatic effects of gibberellins on higher
plants. Unlike auxins, gibberellins promote elongation
almost exclusively in intact plants rather than excised
tissues. Nowhere is this more evident than in the
control of internode elongation in genetic dwarfs. The
relationship between dwarﬁng or internode-length
genes and gibberellins was pioneered by the work of
B. O. Phinney on maize (Zea mays) and P. W. Brian and
coworkers on garden pea (Pisum sativum). Since these
pioneering studies, experiments have been conducted
with dwarf mutants of rice (Oryza sativa), bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris), Arabidopsis thaliana, and several others. In all
cases, application of exogenous gibberellin to the dwarf
mutant restores a normal, tall phenotype (Figure 19.7).
Exogenous gibberellin has no appreciable effect on the
genetically normal plant.
In maize, more than 30 mutants that inﬂuence
plant height have been described. Maize plants express-
ing these mutations have shortened internodes, due
to reduced cell division and cell elongation, and at
maturity reach only 20 to 25 percent of the height of
normal plants. At least ﬁve of these mutants (d1, d2,
d3, d5, an1) exhibit the normal phenotype when treated
with GA3, but show no response to other hormones
or growth regulators. Activity assays such as these have
been supported by other biochemical and radiotracer
experiments, demonstrating conclusively that internode
elongation in maize is under control of gibberellins.
Speciﬁcally, each mutation blocks a different step in the
FIGURE 19.7 The effect of gibberellic acid on dwarf
pea seedlings. Left: Control, showing reduced intern-
ode elongation characteristic of the dwarf growth
habit. Right: Gibberellin treated with a 5 × 10−4 M

biosynthetic pathway toward GA1, which is the active
form of gibberellin in maize. Similar experiments with
the Le allele in garden pea (the same allele studied by
Gregor Mendel in his pioneering genetic studies) have
demonstrated that this dwarf genotype (the homozygous
recessive le/le) also blocks the synthesis of GA1. In both
maize and pea, it has been shown that the dwarf genotype
leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in the gibberellin levels.
While studies with dwarf plants have been instrumen-
tal in linking gibberellins with stem elongation, there
are other dwarf mutants known that do not respond
to application of gibberellin. These mutants may be
unrelated to gibberellin-controlled growth and subject
to other, as yet unknown, regulating factors.
Additional support for the role of gibberellins in
stem elongation comes from the study of rosette plants.
A rosette is essentially an extreme case of dwarﬁsm in
which the absence of any signiﬁcant internode elon-
gation results in a compact growth habit characterized
by closely spaced leaves. The failure of internode to
elongate may result from a genetic mutation, or may
be environmentally induced. Regardless of the cause,
hyper-elongation of stems in rosette plants is invariably
brought about by the application of small amounts of
gibberellin (Figure 19.8).
Environmentally limited rosette plants such as
spinach (Spinacea oleraceae) and cabbage (Brassica sp.)
generally do not ﬂower in the rosette form. Just before
ﬂowering, these plants will undergo extensive internode
elongation, a phenomenon known as bolting. Bolting
is normally triggered by an environmental signal,
either photoperiod (as in spinach) or a combination
of low temperature and photoperiod (as in cabbage).
We will return to the phenomena of photoperiod and
cold requirement in later chapters. It is sufﬁcient to
note here that, under conditions normally conducive
to the rosette habit, spinach, cabbage, and many other
FIGURE 19.8 Gibberellin-stimulated stem growth in a
rosette genotype of Brassica napus. Treatments were

332
Chapter 19 / Hormones II: Gibberellins
rosette plants can be induced to bolt by an exogenous
application of gibberellic acid.
The above results suggest that (1) gibberellins are a
limiting factor in the stem growth of rosette plants and
(2) the effect of long days or cold treatment is to remove
that limitation. These possibilities have been conﬁrmed
in spinach and Silene armeria, both photoperiodic plants
requiring long days to ﬂower, by the extensive inves-
tigations of J. A. D. Zeevaart and coworkers. Spinach
contains six gibberellins, including GA19 and GA20.
GA20 will cause bolting in spinach under short day con-
ditions while GA19 is biologically inactive. Zeevaart and
coworkers found that rosette plants of spinach contain
high levels of the inactive form GA19 and low levels of
the active GA20. Upon transfer to long day conditions,
however, the level of GA19 declined while the level of
GA20 increased (Figure 19.9). The reciprocal changes
in GA19 and GA20 levels suggests a precursor-product
relationship, which was conﬁrmed in whole plants by
feeding deuterium (2H)-labeled precursors. In other
experiments, 14C-labeled GA19 was converted to GA20
by cell-free extracts from spinach plants maintained
under long days, but not in extracts from plants main-
tained under short days. On the basis of these studies,
it may be concluded that gibberellins have a signiﬁcant
role in the control of stem elongation in rosette plants.
The relationship between gibberellins and stem
elongation in cold-requiring plants has not been studied
as thoroughly as it has for plants that are sensitive to pho-
toperiod. As mentioned above, exogenous application of
GA3 will substitute for the cold requirement in many
plants and there is some evidence, based on bioassays,

that gibberellin-like activity increases in plants following
cold treatment. It is reasonable to expect on the basis of
these studies that changes in gibberellin biosynthesis or
metabolism are involved, but a more thorough study is
required.

MOBILIZATION OF NUTRIENT
RESERVES DURING
GERMINATION OF CEREAL
GRAINS
Gibberellins
initiate
the
mobilization
of
nutrient
reserves stored in the endosperm, while auxins promote
elongation of the embryonic axis. The auxins that
support early embryo growth are largely derived from
the breakdown of stored conjugates to free, active
IAA while the gibberellins, at least in cereal grains,
appear to be released by the hydrated embryo from a
preformed GA pool. In Arabidopsis, on the other hand,
seeds carrying mutations such as ga1, ga2, and ga3, that
act early in gibberellin biosynthesis, fail to germinate
but germination can be rescued by applying exogenous
gibberellin. More recently, it has been suggested that
brassinosteroids might also have a role in germination
of Arabidopsis seed (Chapter 21).
A role for gibberellins in mobilization of reserves
during seed germination was ﬁrst suggested by exper-
iments on germinating cereal grains in the late 1950s.
Cereal grains such as rye, barley, and wheat have a
protein-rich layer of cells called the aleurone which
surrounds the starchy endosperm tissue. During germi-
nation, cells in the aluerone secrete a range of hydrolytic
enzymes, including α-amylase and proteases, which are
involved in the hydrolysis of carbohydrate and protein
stored in the endosperm.
The involvement of gibberellins in enzyme secre-
tion can be shown by a relatively simple experiment.
Seeds of cereals such as barley are transected to produce
two half-seeds (Figure 19.10). One half-seed contains
the embryo and the other half-seed does not. When
imbibed, the embryo-containing half-seed will proceed
to secrete α-amylase and other hydrolytic enzymes
in order to digest the starchy endosperm, mobilize
the resulting nutrients, and initiate germination. The
half-seed without the embryo cannot, of course, ger-
minate but neither does it produce elevated levels of
α-amylase or any of the other hydrolytic enzymes
required for germination. Treatment of the embryo-less
half-seed with gibberellic acid, however, will stimu-
late the half-seed to produce high levels of α-amylase.
Experiments of this general nature have shown that the
germinating embryo sends a signal, probably gibberellin,
to the aleurone cells. There the gibberellin either acti-
vates or derepresses transcription of genes encoding the
necessary hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes are then

FIGURE 19.10 Gibberellin-stimulated secretion of α-amylase from barley half-seeds.
Embryo-less half-seeds were incubated on the surface of a starch-agar gel. After
48 hours, the gel was washed with iodine-potassium iodide (IKI), a reagent that
reacts with starch to form a blue-black color. A clear circle, or halo, surround-
ing the half-seed indicates the digestion of starch by α-amylase. The control plate
(left) contains four half-seeds but no added gibberellin. Two half-seeds produced
no α-amylase while the other two exhibited low activity. The plate on the right con-
tained 10 nanomoles gibberellic acid. Each of the gibberellin-treated half-seeds is
surrounded by a large halo, indicating active α-amylase secretion. (From a student

released into the endosperm where they break down
the starches and proteins to provide nutrients for the
growing embryo (Figure 19.11).
It should be noted that much of this work has
been conducted on a single cultivar (cv. ‘‘Himalaya’’)
of barley and the responsiveness of seeds to gibberellin
can be signiﬁcantly affected by environment during seed
development and maturation. Seed from barley grown
at high temperatures, for example, produce high levels
of α-amylase in the absence of added GA. Nonetheless,
the principles that have emerged from the barley system
appear to be widely applicable to wheat, rye, oats, and
other cereal grains.
19.9 GIBBERELLINS ACT BY
REGULATING GENE
EXPRESSION
Early physiological studies found that GA-stimulated
α-amylase secretion could be blocked by inhibitors such
as actinomycin D and cycloheximide, which inhibit RNA
and protein synthesis, respectively. Results like this indi-
cated that gibberellin stimulated de novo synthesis of
α-amylase by the aleurone layer.
Does
gibberellin
regulate
transcription
of
α-
amylase
mRNA?
An
unequivocal
answer
to
this
question was possible only after techniques for isolation
of protoplasts from barley aleurone cells were perfected.
Aleurone protoplasts provide a useful experimental
system. They respond normally to GA by exhibiting the
same ultrastructural changes and producing the same
isozymes with the same efﬁciency as intact aleurone
cells. Most importantly, high yields of transcriptionally
active nuclei can be readily isolated from protoplasts.
Based on evidence from several lines of investiga-
tion, it is clear that gibberellin dose regulates transcrip-
tion of α-amylase mRNA. Both in vivo pulse labeling
of protein and in vitro translation of protein from total
aleurone RNA, followed by electrophoretic and autora-
diographic analysis, show signiﬁcant increases in the
amount of α-amylase translated following the appli-
cation of gibberellin (Figure 19.12). α-Amylase may
constitute as much as 50 to 60 percent of the total
translated aleurone protein.
The gibberellin response is apparently not limited
to α-amylase alone, as a small number of other pep-
tides either increase or decrease following gibberellin
treatment. Furthermore, Northern blot hybridization
of α-amylase cDNA clones with RNA from aleurone
layers has conﬁrmed that gibberellin causes an increase

in the physical abundance of α-amylase mRNA. Fol-
lowing gibberellin treatment, α-amylase mRNA may
comprise as much as 20 percent of the total translatable
mRNA. Finally, time course studies have shown that
the rate of α-amylase synthesis following gibberellin
treatment closely correlates with the rate of mRNA
accumulation. These studies pretty well established that
a primary action of gibberellin, at least with respect
to seed germination, is to regulate in some way gene
transcription.
The challenge over the past ten years or so has
been to identify the genes and proteins that are involved
in the gibberellin signaling pathway. This has been
accomplished primarily by screening for mutations that
either enhance or lower gibberellin sensitivity. One such
mutant is the rice mutant slender rice1 (slr1). The slr1
mutation results in what is called a constitutive gibberellin
phenotype, which means that it behaves as if it were
saturated with gibberellin. Mutant seedlings elongate
rapidly and excessively compared with the wildtype and
α-amylase is produced by embryo-less half-seeds with-
out added gibberellin. Excessive gibberellin production
can be ruled out as the cause because the endogenous
GA content of the mutant is lower than that of the wild-
type and the response is not sensitive to inhibitors that
block gibberellin synthesis. Similar ‘‘slender’’ mutants
have been described in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and pea
(Pisum sativum).
Another example is the gibberellic acid insensitive
(gai) mutant in Arabidopsis. gai mutants are dwarfs that
do not respond to applied gibberellin. Similar mutations

DELLA PROTEINS
AND THE GREEN
REVOLUTION
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the world witnessed
advances in plant breeding and agronomy that led to sig-
niﬁcant increases in agricultural production worldwide.
These transformations, collectively referred to as the
‘‘green revolution,’’ were supported in part by the Rock-
efeller Foundation, other philanthropic organizations,
and universities in an effort to help food production
keep pace with worldwide population growth.
Some of the most signiﬁcant advances were seen in
wheat and maize breeding. Wheat yields, for example,
were substantially increased by breeding new varieties
that were shorter and thus more resistant to lodging
damage by wind and rain. The new, shorter varieties
also increased grain production at the expense of straw
biomass. The signiﬁcance of these efforts was recognized
when Norman Borlaug of the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico
was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his work
in wheat breeding.
The new varieties were shorter because the breeders
had introduced mutant dwarﬁng alleles, Reduced height-1
or Rht-B1in wheat and dwarf-8 or d8 in maize, that
conferred a reduced response to gibberellins. In 1999,
J. Peng et al. (Nature 400:256) showed that the Rht
and d8 loci encode Della transcription factors that are
analogous to the gibberellin insensitive (GAI) protein in
Arabidopsis. Like the mutant gai protein in Arabidopsis,
the rht-b1 and d8 proteins have an altered amino acid
sequence at the N-terminal end that interferes with
gibberellin signaling.
at the same genetic locus are responsible for dwarﬁng
in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays). slr1
and gai mutant plants respond the way they do because
the wild-type SLR1 and GAI genes encode transcription
regulators referred to as DELLA proteins. DELLA
proteins are a class of nuclear proteins that appear to
function as repressors in gibberellin signaling. This con-
clusion is based on earlier observations that degradation
of DELLA proteins in planta triggers gibberellin-type
responses. Although SLR1 is the only DELLA gene
described for rice, a total of ﬁve, including GAI, have
been described for Arabidopsis.
The discovery of DELLA proteins has been fol-
lowed by the discovery of a soluble GA receptor protein,
GA INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1), in rice. GID1
encodes a nuclear protein that binds with gibberel-
lic acid both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently it
was found that Arabidopsis carries three homologous
genes, designated AtGID1a, AtGID1b, and AtGID1c,
which encode similar proteins. Each of the Arabidop-
sis genes apparently has a speciﬁc, but overlapping,
role in growth and development. For example, individ-
ually the mutant genes atgid1a, atgid1b, and atgid1c
show no clear phenotype and even when any two
mutant genes were present, germination was normal.
The double mutant atgid1a-atgid1c exhibited a dwarf
phenotype while other double mutant combinations
were of normal height. However, the triple mutant
atgid1a-atgid1b-atgid1c failed to germinate without peel-
ing off the seed coat and the seedlings were severe
dwarfs, achieving a height of only a few millime-
ters after a month’s growth. On the other hand, the
expression of any one of the Arabidopsis wildtype genes
in gid1 mutant rice plants produced normal rice plants
with normal GA sensitivity.
All of this has been brought together recently by
the demonstration that the GID1 receptor binds not
only with gibberellin, but also with the DELLA protein
SLR1 to form a GA-GID1-SLR1 complex. According
to the current model, this hormone-receptor-repressor
complex then results in the degradation of the DELLA
repressor protein by the 26S proteasome pathway,
thus relieving a DELLA-imposed repression and allow-
ing expression of the gibberellin-responsive gene. In
other words, the function of gibberellin—to derepress
genes by facilitating the removal and ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of a repressor protein—is similar to that of
auxin described earlier in this chapter. This model would
also explain why the gai mutants are dwarfs that do not
respond to GA. Cloning of the Arabidopsis GAI gene has
shown that the mutant gai protein is missing a group of
amino acids at its N-terminal end. These missing amino
acids presumably render the protein insensitive to the
gibberellin-receptor complex without interfering with
its role as a repressor (Figure 19.13).
GA elicits multiple responses in plants and it may yet
be demonstrated that some of these responses involve
membrane-bound receptors and a cascade of secondary
messengers. However, it is interesting to note that, in
1957, P. W. Brian suggested that plants contained an
endogenous inhibitor and gibberellin acted not by direct
stimulation of a response but by relieving this inhibition.
Fifty years later, we have come full circle and Brian’s
proposal now seems remarkably prescient.

SUMMARY
Gibberellins are diterpenes, noted for their capacity to
stimulate hyper-elongation of intact stems, especially
in dwarf and rosette plants and stimulate mobilization
of endosperm reserves during seed germination.
Gibberellins are related biosynthetically to
carotenes and other isoprene derivatives. Principal
intermediates are geranyl-geranyl-pyrophosphate and
GA12-7-aldehyde.Gibberellins can be inactivated by
hydroxylation at the C-2 position or by conversion
to inactive conjugates. Gibberellins appear to be
transported primarily in the phloem in response
to source-sink relationships. Chemicals that block
gibberellin biosynthesis are used commercially to
produce shorter, more compact plants.
Gibberellin appears to act primarily by target-
ing the repressor proteins for degradation by the 26S
proteasome pathway.

Hormones III: Cytokinins
Cytokinins (CK) are derivatives of the nitrogenous base
adenine and are noted primarily for their capacity to
stimulate cell division in tissue culture. Cytokinins also
inﬂuence a number of other developmental responses,
including shoot and root differentiation in tissue culture,
the growth of lateral buds and leaf expansion, chloroplast
development, and delay of senescence. Most recently it
has been learned that cytokinins play a fundamental
role in maintaining the indeterminate property of shoot
apical meristems.
This chapter includes
•
the structure, synthesis, and metabolism of cyto-
kinins,
•
the role of cytokinins in regulating cell division,
•
the control of shoot meristem function by cyto-
kinins,
•
the role of cytokinins in apical dominance, senes-
cence, and other developmental events, and

cytokinin receptors and signal transduction.
20.1 CYTOKININS ARE ADENINE
DERIVATIVES
Naturally occurring cytokinins are all adenine deriva-
tives with either an isoprene-related side chain or an
aromatic (cyclic) side chain. The former are called iso-
prenoid cytokinins and the latter are called aromatic
cytokinins. Although there is some variation depending
on species and developmental stage, the most common
isoprenoid cytokinins are N6-(2-isopentenyl)- ade-
nine (iP), trans-zeatin (tZ), and dihydrozeatin (DZ)
(Figure 20.1). The aromatic cytokinins, such as benzyl-
adenine (BA) are less common and are found in only a
few species.
The original cytokinin, kinetin, is a synthetic de-
rivative that has not yet been identiﬁed in plants
(Box 20.1). Curiously, however, there is a recent report
that kinetin has been identiﬁed in human urine.

Enzymes that direct the synthesis of cytokinins have
been isolated from the slime mold Dictyostelium dis-
coideum, tobacco callus tissue, and crown gall tissue (see
Figure 20.7). The key reaction is the addition of a
dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAP) group to the nitro-
gen at the 6-position of adenosine−5′-monophosphate

FIGURE 20.1 The chemical structures of four representa-

cytokinin activity, is a synthetic cytokinin prepared by
heating DNA. Isopentenyl adenine (iP) and trans-Zeatin,
both isoprenoid-type cytokinins, are the most common
naturally occurring cytokinins. Benzyladenine (BAP) is
an aromatic cytokinin. The N6 position of adenine is
indicated and the side chains are highlighted.
(AMP) (Figure 20.2). DMAP, introduced previously in
Chapter 19, is also known as 2-isopentenyl diphos-
phate or 2iPP. This addition reaction is catalyzed by
the enzyme adenosine phosphate-isopentenyl trans-
ferase (IPT). The product is N6-(2-isopentenyl)-
adenosine−5′-monophosphate or iPRMP. The IPT-
catalyzed reaction is also the rate limiting reaction in
cytokinin biosynthesis, a factor that has enabled many
investigators to manipulate the cytokinin content of
tissues by transforming plants with genes that cause an
overexpression of IPT.
In the next two steps, the phosphate group and
the ribose group removed from [9R−5′P]iP to form
the active cytokinin N6-(2-isopentenyl)-adenine (iP).
Alternatively, the isopentenyl side chain of [9R−5′P]iP
may be hydroxylated before the phosphate and ribose
groups are removed to form zeatin (Z). Zeatin and iP
are thought to be the most biologically active cytokinins
in most plants. Reduction of the double bond in the side
chain of zeatin would give the dihydrozeatin derivative,
which is particularly active in some species of legumes.
Cytokinins are known to undergo extensive inter-
conversions between the free base (or, nucleobase),
ribosides, and ribotides when experimentally supplied
to tissues. Enzymes have been identiﬁed in wheat germ
that catalyze the conversion of iP to its riboside ([9R]iP)
or to its ribotide ([9R−5′P]iP) as well as enzymes that
catalyze the hydrolysis of the ribotides and ribosides to
the free base (iP). Naturally, these rapid interconversions
make it very difﬁcult to ascertain which form is the truly
‘‘active’’ form of the hormone. However, this confusion
has been at least partially resolved with the identiﬁcation
of cytokinin receptors, discussed later in this chapter.
Individual receptors from different species appear to
have different afﬁnities for cytokinin nucleobases, ribo-
sides and ribotides. This may be simply one way of
conferring speciﬁcity through the cytokinin-receptor
interaction.
20.1.2 CYTOKININS MAY BE
DEACTIVATED BY
CONJUGATION OR OXIDATION
There are two principal routes for regulating cytokinin
activity levels by removal of cytokinins from the active
pool: (1) conjugation with either glucose or amino
acids, and (2) oxidation. Examples of glucosylation of
the side chain hydroxyl group (O-glucosylation) of
zeatin or dihydrozeatin, for example, are abundant in
plants (Figure 20.3). O-glucosides are not themselves
active, but are readily hydrolyzed to active cytokinin
by glucosidase enzymes. O-glucosylation appears to be
a mechanism for storing excess cytokinin for retrieval
when physiological conditions warrant. O-glucosides
are also resistant to oxidation and thus may serve to
protect the hormone from oxidation while being trans-
ported to a target tissue. In some plants, such as radish,
maize, or tobacco, cytokinins may also be glucosylated
at one of the nitrogen positions on the purine ring.
Both the 7- and 9-glucosides are biologically inactive.
N-glucosides are also very stable and do not appear to be
hydrolyzed readily to give the active free base. Their for-
mation thus appears to be more a means for permanent
inactivation of cytokinins rather than storage.

THE DISCOVERY
OF CYTOKININS
The discovery of cytokinins came about because plant
cells in culture would not divide. The ﬁrst experimental
evidence for chemical control of plant cell division was
provided by Haberlandt in 1913, when he demonstrated
that phloem sap could cause nondividing, parenchyma-
tous potato tuber tissue to revert to an actively dividing
meristematic state. Other cell-division factors were later
demonstrated in wounded bean pod tissue, extracts of
Datura ovules, and the liquid (milky) endosperm of
coconut.
In the 1940s and 1950s, plant tissue culture was
attracting the attention of physiologists as a tool for
study of cell division and development. One group,
under the direction of F. Skoog at the University of
Wisconsin, was studying the nutritional requirements
of tissue cultures derived from tobacco stem segments.
Skoog and coworkers found that stem tissue explants
containing vascular tissue would proliferate on a de-
ﬁned
medium
containing
auxin.
On
the
same
auxin-containing medium, however, tissue explants
freed of vascular tissue would exhibit cell enlargement,
but failed to divide. They soon found that extracts
of vascular tissue, coconut milk, and yeast would all
stimulate cell division in the presence of auxin.
C. O. Miller, then working as a postdoctoral student
in Skoog’s laboratory, took on the task of isolating the
active material. Miller was able to provisionally identify
the active material as a adenine, one of the nitrogenous
bases found in nucleic acids. This led to a search for
active material in nucleic acid preparations, a source high
in adenine. In a beautiful piece of serendipity, Miller
sampled a bottle of herring sperm DNA which had been
sitting on the laboratory shelf. The sample proved to be
highly active, so a fresh supply of herring sperm DNA
was ordered. Unfortunately, the fresh sample proved to
be completely inactive. It turns out that the active princi-
ple in the original DNA sample had slowly accumulated
as the DNA aged on the laboratory shelf. Activity could
be generated in fresh DNA samples simply by artiﬁcially
‘‘aging’’ the sample with heat and acid.
In 1956, Miller and his colleagues reported the
isolation and crystallization of a highly active substance,
identiﬁed as the adenine derivative N6-furfurylamino-
purine, from autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Because
the compound elicited cell division, or cytokinesis, in
tissue culture, Miller and his colleagues named the
substance kinetin. In 1965, Skoog and his colleagues
proposed the term cytokinin.
Even though kinetin remains one of the most
biologically active cytokinins, it is an artifact of iso-
lation from DNA and has not been found in plants.
However, the discovery of kinetin and its dramatic
effect on cell division stimulated physiologists to
look for naturally occurring cytokinins. In the early
1960s, Miller, then at Indiana University, and D.
S.
Letham,
working
in
Australia,
independently
reported the isolation of a purine with kinetinlike
properties from young, developing maize seed and
plum fruitlets. This substance was characterized as
6-(4-hydroxy-3-methyl-trans-2-butenylamino) purine,
which was given the trivial name zeatin. Since the dis-
covery of zeatin, a number of other naturally occurring
cytokinins have been isolated and characterized.
Cytokinins also form conjugates with the amino
acid alanine (Figure 20.3). 9-Alanyl conjugates of zeatin
and dihydrozeatin have been identiﬁed in tissues of
lupine (Lupinus) fruit and root nodules, immature apple
seeds, and bean (Phaseolus) seedlings. These are also very
stable conjugates that probably serve to inactivate the
cytokinin in the same manner as N-glucosides.
Another mechanism—possibly the major mecha-
nism—for removing cytokinins from the hormone
pool is their irreversible degradation by the enzyme
cytokinin
oxidase/dehydrogenase
(CKX).
CKX
cleaves the isopentenyl side chain from either zeatin
or iP or their ribosyl derivatives. In order to function,
however, CKX must recognize the double bond of the
isoprenoid side chain. Consequently, dihydrozeatin and
aromatic cytokinins are resistant to degradation by
CKX. In the same way that the endogenous cytokinin
content can be increased by overexpression of the
gene
Isopentenyl
transferase
(IPT)
in
transgenic
plants, cytokinin content can be reduced in trans-
genic
plants
that
overexpress
cytokinin
oxidase/
dehydrogenase.

sap of roots from a variety of sources. It is generally
concluded that roots are a principal source of cytokinins
in most, if not all, plants and that they are transported
to the aerial portion of the plant through the xylem.
Indirect support for this conclusion is provided by the
observation that excised leaves from many species can
be maintained in a moist sand bed only if adventitious
roots are permitted to form at the base of the petiole.
If these roots do not form or are removed as they form,
the leaves will quickly senesce. The delayed senescence
when roots are allowed to form is apparently due to the
presence of cytokinins, which are synthesized in the root
and transported to the leaf through the vascular tissue.
Immature seeds and developing fruits also contain
high levels of cytokinins; the ﬁrst naturally occurring
cytokinins were isolated from milky endosperm of maize
and developing plum fruits. While there is some evi-
dence that seeds and fruits are capable of synthesizing
cytokinins, there is also evidence to the contrary. Thus it
remains equally possible that developing seeds, because
of their high metabolic activity and rapid growth, may
simply function as a sink for cytokinins transported from
the roots. On the other hand, there is now evidence that
cytokinins are not always a long-distance messenger. As
we will see later, meristematic cells in the shoot apical
meristem and ﬂoral meristems in particular are under
the control of locally produced cytokinins.
20.3 CYTOKININS ARE
REQUIRED FOR CELL
PROLIFERATION
The role of cytokinins in regulating cell division ﬁrst
became apparent as a result of attempts to culture
isolated carrot and tobacco tissues on deﬁned media
(see Box 20.1). Cell proliferation occurred only when
auxin plus some ‘‘cell-division factor’’ was present in the
medium. The ‘‘cell division factor’’ turned out, of course,
to be kinetin. It was soon learned that kinetin and other
cytokinins, always in the presence of auxin, stimulated cell
division in a wide variety of tissues. The signiﬁcance of
these studies was that no cambium or other meristematic
tissue was present in the cultures, therefore demonstrat-
ing that cytokinins have the capacity to initiate division
in quiescent, or nondividing, cells.
20.3.1 CYTOKININS REGULATE
PROGRESSION THROUGH
THE CELL CYCLE
Although much remains to be learned about how
cytokinins regulate cell division, studies of tobacco
suspension-cultured cells and Arabidopsis indicate a
direct role for cytokinins in regulating progression
through the cell cycle.
Freshly established tobacco cell cultures require
both auxin and cytokinin for continued cell division.
The absence of either hormone causes the cells to be
arrested in either the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Following addition of the missing hormone, the onset
of cell division can be detected within 12 to 24 hours. In
1996, K. Zhang and coworkers reported that cultured
cells arrested in G2 by the absence of cytokinin con-
tained cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) with reduced
activity, due to a high level of phosphorylation on a

344
Chapter 20 / Hormones III: Cytokinins
tyrosine residue. When such cultures were re-supplied
with cytokinin, the tyrosine was dephosphorylated, the
enzyme reactivated, and cell division resumed.
The current evidence suggests that a speciﬁc tyro-
sine residue in the CDK catalytic unit is phosphorylated
during the S phase by another kinase (Figure 20.4).
Although the phosphorylated CDK catalytic unit is able
to combine with cyclin (in this case, a B-type cyclin
or CycB), the phosphorylated complex remains inactive
until the inhibitory phosphate group is removed by a
cytokinin-dependent phosphatase. Thus the principal
role of cytokinin in cultured tobacco cells appears to be
that of generating an active CDK complex that initiates
cell division by catalyzing the transition from the G2
phase to mitosis, or M phase.
A second type of cytokinin action has been described
for Arabidopsis. A mutant of Arabidopsis with a high
level of cytokinin was found to contain as well a high
level of a D-type cyclin (CycD3). The accumulation of
CycD3 was rapidly induced when cytokinin was added
to wildtype cell cultures or applied to whole plants.
Moreover, cells of cultured callus tissues from transgenic
plants that were constructed to overproduce CycD3
continue to divide in the absence of cytokinin.
While it is well established that the B-type cyclins
act at the transition from G2 to mitosis, the level of
D-type cyclins in plants remains fairly constant through-
out the cell cycle and no speciﬁc activity for D-type
cyclins has yet been described. However, based on anal-
ogy with similar cyclins in animals, it has been proposed
that they control the transition from G1 to S phase. If
this is true, the Arabidopsis results would indicate that
cytokinin initiates cell division at the G1 to S transi-
tion through the induction of CycD3. Interestingly, two
other Arabidopsis D-type cyclins (CycD2 and CycD4)
are induced by sucrose. As more is learned about the
links between cytokinins or other developmental signals
and cell cycle regulatory proteins, we can look forward
to a better understanding not only of how cell division
is initiated but also how cells exit the cell cycle in order
to begin differentiation.
20.3.2 THE RATIO OF CYTOKININ TO
AUXIN CONTROLS ROOT AND
SHOOT INITIATION IN CALLUS
TISSUES AND THE GROWTH OF
AXILLARY BUDS
Auxin and cytokinins have antagonistic actions with
respect to root shoot formation in cultured tobacco
tissues (Figure 20.5). Both auxin and cytokinins are
required to maintain callus cultures. However, when
auxin is present alone, or if the ratio of auxin to cytokinin
is high, cultures will initiate root formation. Conversely,
a high cytokinin-to-auxin ratio promotes shoot produc-
tion and roughly equal amounts of auxin and cytokinin
will cause continued proliferation of undifferentiated
callus. This phenomenon has been put to practical appli-
cation in the technique of regenerating large numbers
of plants by micropropagation (Box 20.2).
Cytokinins also antagonize the auxin effect in reg-
ulating the growth of axillary buds, or apical domi-
nance (Chapter 18). In many species the application
of cytokinins either to the shoot apex or directly to
the axillary bud will release the bud from inhibition.
Tomato mutants expressing strong apical dominance
contain lower amounts of cytokinins than those with
normal dominance. More recent studies with transgenic
plants have conﬁrmed that plants with elevated auxin
levels show increased apical dominance and that over-
production of cytokinin reduces apical dominance. Most
FIGURE 20.4 A simpliﬁed model for hor-
monal control of the cell cycle in plants.
Cytokinin promotes the onset of mito-
sis (the G2 to M transition) by activating
a phosphatase that removes an inhibitory
phosphate group from the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK)/cyclin B complex. Auxin and
cytokinin also promote the accumulation of
G1 cyclins (shown here as cyclin D), neces-
sary for the onset of the S (synthesis) phase.

TISSUE CULTURE
HAS MADE
POSSIBLE
LARGE-SCALE
CLONING OF
PLANTS BY MICRO-
PROPAGATION
With a relatively small investment in space, technical
support, and materials, tissue culture has made it possible
to produce literally millions of high-quality, genetically
uniform plants. The process is known as micropropa-
gation. The most common technique is to place excised
meristematic tissue on an artiﬁcial medium containing a
cytokinin/auxin ratio that reduces apical dominance and
encourages axillary bud development (See Figure 20.5).
The new shoots can be separated and sub-cultured to
produce more axillary shoots, or placed on a medium
that encourages rooting. Once roots appear, the plantlets
can be planted out and allowed to develop into mature
plants. Alternatively, excised tissues can be used to estab-
lish callus cultures, which may then be induced to form
roots and shoots by manipulating the cytokinin/auxin
ratio.
Micropropagation can also be an effective way to
eliminate viruses and other pathogens and produce com-
mercial quantities of pathogen-free propagules. The
ﬁrst plants to be mass-produced by tissue culture were
virus-free orchids of the genus Cymbidium, but the tech-
nique has also been found useful for potato, lilies, tulips,
and other species that are normally propagated vegeta-
tively. Potato, for example, is vegetatively propagated
through buds on the tubers, a system that readily trans-
mits viruses to the next generation. Micropropagation
of potato from meristem cultures has proven to be an
effective way to isolate virus-free lines.
Micropropagation is also used extensively in the
production of forest tree species. Here the propagules
are generated primarily from cultures of axillary and
adventitious buds; callusing and differentiation of new
buds is rarely used. A similar approach has been applied
successfully to cultivars of apple (Malus), peach (Pyrus),
and pear (Prunus). Because most temperate fruits are
highly heterozygous, they do not breed true from seed
but are propagated by vegetative cuttings. Rooting of
microcuttings in culture is now a routine procedure
in many commercial laboratories. By the early 1980s,
growers in the Netherlands were producing more than
21 million plants by micropropagation.
In spite of the fact that plantlets derived from tissue
culture are cloned from presumably identical somatic
(nonsexual) cells, the regenerated plants can exhibit sig-
niﬁcant variation in their morphology and physiology.
This is known as somaclonal variation. The cause
of somaclonal variation is not clear, but it appears to
involve spontaneous genetic mutation as a result of the
culture conditions. The value of somaclonal variation is
that occasionally the variants exhibit some agronomi-
cally useful trait, such as disease resistance or variations
in ﬂoral color patterns.
interesting, however, is the observation that an exoge-
nous application of cytokinin to the suppressed apical
buds of auxin-overproducing plants will release the buds
from dominance. Thus, it appears that it is the ratio of
auxin to cytokinin, not the absolute level of auxin, which
suppresses axillary bud growth.
The cytokinin–auxin antagonism is believed to
account for the phenomenon of ‘‘witch’s broom,’’ an
example of extreme axillary bud release (Figure 20.6).
The witch’s broom syndrome appears on a wide vari-
ety of plants and most often results from parasitism
by fungi, bacteria, or mistletoes (Arceuthobium sp.), a
dwarf ﬂowering shrub that parasitizes predominantly
spruce (Picea), larch (Larix), and pine (Pinus). Although
the exact nature of the hormonal imbalance is not
known, it is believed that the parasitism stimulates
an overproduction of cytokinin. The resulting release
of apical dominance produces a dense mass of short
branches.
20.3.3 CROWN GALL TUMORS ARE
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
TO OVERPRODUCE CYTOKININ
AND AUXIN
Agrobacterium tumifaciens is a bacterium that causes neo-
plastic or tumorous growth, known as crown gall, on
stems (Figure 20.7). Crown gall tissues can be excised
and maintained on a simple medium containing mineral
salts, some vitamins, and sucrose as a carbon source. No
hormones need be added to the medium because the
infected tissues have been naturally engineered with the
capacity to synthesize both cytokinins and auxin.
A. tumefaciens contains a typical bacterial plasmid—
a small circular strand of DNA separate from the rest
of the bacterial genome. The A. tumefaciens plasmid is
called a tumor-inducing, or Ti, plasmid because it car-
ries the genes responsible for the neoplastic growth that
occurs when the bacterium infects a wounded plant. A

portion of the plasmid DNA, known as T-DNA (for
transferred DNA), contains the genes for three classes
of proteins. Two of these are the enzymes necessary
for the synthesis of cytokinins and auxins. The third is
the enzyme that causes the plant to produce opines,
unusual amino acids that serve as nutrients for the bac-
terium. When A. tumefaciens invades a host plant, the
T-DNA portion of the plasmid is inserted into the host
cell nuclear DNA. These genes are then replicated along
with the host cell genome. A. tumefaciens is in fact a natu-
ral genetic engineer. It transforms the host cell, which is
then programmed to overproduce cytokinins, auxin, and
opines. The cytokinins and auxin together encourage

20.3.4 CYTOKININS DELAY
SENESCENCE
At present, there are three lines of evidence indicating a
role for cytokinins as inhibitors of senescence. First is the
observation that exogenous application of cytokinin to
detached leaves will delay the onset of senescence, main-
tain protein levels, and prevent chlorophyll breakdown.
Application of cytokinins will also delay the natural
senescence of leaves on intact plants.
The second line of evidence consists of correlations
between endogenous cytokinin content and senescence.
For example, detached leaves that have been treated
with auxin to induce root formation at the base of
the petiole will remain healthy for weeks. In this
case, the growing root is a site of cytokinin synthesis
and the hormone is transported through the xylem to
the leaf blade. If the roots are continually removed as
they form, senescence of the leaf will be accelerated. It
has also been observed that when a mature plant begins
its natural senescence, there is a sharp decrease in the
level of cytokinins exported from the root.
A third and particularly convincing line of evidence
comes from recent studies employing recombinant
DNA techniques. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tobacum)
have been transformed with the Agrobacterium gene for
cytokinin biosynthesis, designated TMR (Figure 20.8).
The Agrobacterium TMR gene encodes for the enzyme
isopentenyl transferase, which catalyzes the rate-
limiting step in cytokinin biosynthesis. In this case, the

plantlets. The large, white areas in B and D are senesced leaves. The transformed
controls (C) do not, as expected, exhibit the cytokinin effect on lateral bud growth but
do not exhibit senescence. This probably indicates the transformed gene is ‘‘leaky’’
and a small amount of cytokinin is produced in the absence of heat shock. (From
Smart, C. et al. 1991. The Plant Cell 3:647. Copyright American Society of Plant
Physiologists. Photo courtesy of C. Smart.)
TMR gene was linked to a heat shock promoter. A
promoter is a sequence of DNA that signals where
the transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) should
begin. The heat shock promoter is normally involved
in the heat shock response of plants, which is induced
by a brief period of high temperature. Nomally, the
heat shock response involves the synthesis of a new
set of proteins called heat shock proteins. The heat
shock promoter is thus active only when subjected to a
high temperature treatment. By linking the TMR gene
to the heat shock promoter, cytokinin biosynthesis
can be turned on in the transformed plants simply
by subjecting the plants to a brief period of high
temperature. A heat shock of 42◦C for 2 hours caused
a 17-fold increase in zeatin levels in transformed plants
compared with untransformed control plants. When
subjected to heat shock on a weekly basis over a 12-week
period, transformed plants exhibited a marked release
of lateral buds from apical dominance as well as delayed
senescence. Transformed but non-heat-shocked plants
also remained green longer than normal plants but
did not exhibit release from apical dominance. This is
probably due to ‘‘leakiness’’ on the part of the promoter,
allowing production of a very small but effective amount
of cytokinin even at normal temperature.
The mechanism by which cytokinins are able to
delay senescence is not clear, but there is some evidence
that cytokinins exert a role in mobilizing nutrients. The
classic experiment of K. Mothes and coworkers, sum-
marized in Figure 20.9, illustrates this point. In this
experiment, a nutrient labeled with radioactive carbon
(e.g., 14C-glycine) is applied to a leaf after a portion
of the leaf has been treated with cytokinin. Invariably
the radioactivity is transported to and accumulates in
the region of cytokinin treatment. A variety of similar
experiments have led to the hypothesis that cytokinins
direct nutrient mobilization and retention by stimu-
lating metabolism in the area of cytokinin application.
This creates a new sink—an area that preferentially
attracts metabolites from the region of application (the
source). It is unlikely that cytokinins act directly through
stimulating protein synthesis since the mobilization
of nonmetabolites such as α-aminoisobutyric acid is
directed by cytokinins equally well.
20.3.5 CYTOKININS HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ROLE IN
MAINTAINING THE SHOOT
MERISTEM
The fundamental characteristic of a plant meristem is
the capacity to maintain the spatial distinction between
dividing cells and differentiating cells. The entire course
of plant development depends on maintaining that small
population of perpetually dividing cells. Ever since
Skoog and Miller demonstrated that cytokinins induced
cell division and shoot regeneration ﬁfty years ago,

cytokinins have been routinely used to induce shoot
formation in tissue culture for plant propagation and for
the production of transgenic plants. It has always been
assumed that cytokinins had a signiﬁcant role in main-
taining the meristem in planta, but direct evidence for
such a role has been difﬁcult to obtain. The traditional
method involving exogenous application of cytokinins
is something of a shotgun approach that provides rela-
tively little solid information. When you simply spray a
plant with hormone solution, for example, it is virtually
impossible to know how much hormone actually gets
into the plant or where it goes. Moreover, excessive
hormone levels may cause artifactual, nonphysiologic
effects.
Several new lines of evidence, however, now point
to a positive role for cytokinins in the shoot apical
meristem. Most of these experiments involve reducing
the in planta concentration of cytokinins, either by
overexpressing appropriate genes in transgenic plants
or through loss-of-function mutants. For example,
cytokinin levels can be reduced in planta by overex-
pressing the genes for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase
(CKX), which degrades active cytokinins. Arabidopsis
has seven CKX genes and, depending on which of these
genes is overexpressed, the cytokinin content can be
reduced to 30 to 45 percent of wildtype plants. The
result in all cases was retarded shoot development;
dwarfed, late ﬂowering plants; and reduced size of the
shoot meristem. The formation of leaf primordia was
slower in cytokinin-deﬁcient plants and the number
of leaf cells was signiﬁcantly reduced. Where CKX
was most strongly expressed, growth of the shoot
was arrested completely shortly after germination.
Similar results were obtained in experiments where the
cytokinin content was reduced through loss-of-function
mutants of the gene for IPT or of genes for known
cytokinin receptors (Section 20.4).
Further evidence for the maintenance of the shoot
apical meristem by cytokinins is offered by the discovery
of a cytokinin-deﬁcient rice mutant that was given the
intriguing name of lonely guy (log). Rice ﬂowers are
borne in a typical, highly branched grass inﬂorescence
called a panicle (Figure 20.10). The ﬂowers, or spikelets,
normally contain a single pistil surrounded by several
stamens. In log mutant plants, the size of the panicle
was severely reduced. There were fewer branches and
the branches bore abnormal ﬂowers. Flowers were often
reduced to no pistil and but a single stamen (hence the
name lonely guy). Microscopic studies revealed that after
the transition from vegetative to reproductive stage the
normally dome-shaped ﬂoral meristem ﬂattens and the
differentiation of ﬂoral organs is prematurely shut down.
Clearly the log mutant is characterized by a deﬁcient
meristem, but why? When the LOG gene was isolated
and cloned, it was found that expression of the LOG
gene is localized in regions of active cell division in the
meristem such as the apex of the meristem and branch
primordia. It was also found that LOG encodes a phos-
phoribohydrolase enzyme. This means that the enzyme
activates cytokinins by removing the ribose phosphate
group from an inactive cytokinin nucleotide to leave
the active free base. The absence of this enzyme in the
log mutant thus reduces the level of active cytokinin in
the critical region of cell division and the result is an
improperly maintained meristem.
20.3.6 CYTOKININ LEVELS IN THE
SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM ARE
REGULATED BY MASTER
CONTROL GENES
If cytokinins maintain the meristem by controlling
cell division, then what triggers differentiation? Plants,
fungi, and animals all contain genes that are involved
in patterning and organ initiation. Most of these genes
share a sequence of about 180 base pairs called the
homeobox or homeodomain. The resulting proteins
are therefore referred to as homeobox or homeodomain
proteins. In plants, the homeobox proteins are identiﬁed
as KNOX proteins, based on the KNOTTED1 protein
in maize—the ﬁrst homeobox protein to be identiﬁed in
plants. Homeobox genes are often referred to as master
control genes because of their fundamental role in devel-
opment and their capacity to specify the fate of tissues

rescence (A) is a typical grass panicle with numer-
ous branches covered with lateral ﬂowers, or spikelets
(shown here in green). Each branch ends with a termi-
nal spikelet (shown in red). The number of branches
and spikelets is determined by the timing of when the
shoot apical meristem of the main stem or branches is
converted to a terminal spikelet meristem. The wild-
type spikelet contains a pistil and numerous stamens (B).
With less cytokinin in the mutant, the branch meristems
are not properly maintained. The result is fewer, shorter
branches with fewer spikelets (C). Floral meristems are
also affected and the spikelet may be reduced to a sin-
gle stamen and no pistil (D). (Based on Kurakawa, T. et
al. 2007. Nature 445:652; and Kyozuka, J. 2007. Current
Opinion in Plant Biology 10:442.)
and organs. In the case of plants, one fundamental role
of KNOX genes is to specify meristems by regulating
the biosynthesis of cytokinins and gibberellins.
The impact of KNOX genes on development is illus-
trated by two types of mutations. Expression of wildtype
KNOX genes is localized to the nuclei of shoot apical
meristems. They are not normally expressed in leaf pri-
mordia or developed leaves of wildtype plants. There
are several dominant mutations, however, that alter this
pattern. These dominant mutations are gain-of-function
mutations, meaning that the genes are overexpressed
in the mutant seedlings. The result is that some leaf
tissues fail to differentiate and continue to divide, form-
ing sporadic outgrowths, or ‘‘knots,’’ on the leaf blade.
In extreme cases, ectopic shoots can actually be seen
developing on the leaf surface, indicating the presence of
active meristem-like cells. In other words, when KNOX
proteins accumulate due to overexpression of the KNOX
genes, cells in the leaf which should have switched to
differentiation fail to do so and continue dividing.
The Arabidopsis gene SHOOTMEREISTEMLESS
(STM) also encodes a KNOX protein and the effect of
the recessive loss-of-function mutant, stm, is just the
opposite of the gain of function dominant mutatnts
described above. Plants carrying the mutant stm fail to
develop any shoot apical meristem during embryogen-
esis. The pattern of STM expression is very similar to
the pattern of KNOTTED1expression in maize. Using
techniques to visualize mRNA in situ, the pattern of
STM mRNA was followed during embryogenesis. STM
mRNA initially appears in one or two cells in the
earlier globular stage embryos (Figure 20.11). As the
embryo enters the heart-shaped and torpedo stages,
STM expression is restricted to the notch between the
embryonic cotyledons—i.e., expression of STM is lim-
ited to the cells that will eventually organize as the
SAM. As the plant grows into the seedling stage and
adult plant, STM expression persists into the vegetative,
axillary, inﬂorescence, and ﬂoral meristems. But it is not
expressed in leaves or leaf primordia.
It thus appears that the Knox proteins are transcrip-
tion factors based almost exclusively in the meristem and
that regulate the switch between indeterminant (i.e.,
meristematic) growth and differentiation. If so, what
genes are targeted by these transcription factors? The
primary candidates appear to be genes that control the
synthesis of gibberellins and cytokinins. We’ve already
seen that LOG maintains the meristem by catalyzing
the formation of active cytokinins. In early studies of
KNOX proteins, it was noted that overexpression of
these transcription factors was accompanied by a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the cytokinin content, especially
trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyl adenine (iP). Recent
studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have conﬁrmed that the
higher cytokinin levels found in transgenic plants over-
producing KNOX proteins is a direct result of increased
transcription of the rate-limiting enzyme isopentenyl
transferase (IPT).
At the same time, it has been reported that KNOX
proteins suppress the transcription of GA20-oxidase
genes in at least four different species: Arabidopsis,
tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum), rice (Oryza sativa), and
potato (Solanum tuberosum). GA20-oxidase catalyzes the
conversion of inactive GA20 to the active gibberellin,
GA1. Thus it appears that cytokinins are primarily res-
ponsible for initiating and maintaining populations of
dividing cells. Gibberellins, on the other hand, are more
involved in the subsequent differentiation of cells. The
balance between division and differentiation is main-
tained by KNOX proteins; transcription factors whose
job it is to maintain a high CK/GA ratio in the shoot

apical meristem. This is accomplished by simultane-
ously stimulating cytokinin biosynthesis and suppressing
gibberellin biosynthesis. The resulting high-CK/low
GA condition is required for both the formation and
maintenance of the meristem. Outside the meristem,
KNOX genes are apparently turned off, cytokinin con-
centrations decline, cell division effectively ceases, and
gibberellins take over to encourage differentiation.
20.4 CYTOKININ RECEPTOR
AND SIGNALING
In spite of the fundamental role played by cytokinins in
cell division, the multiple other effects that cytokinins
have on plant development have made it difﬁcult to
identify cytokinin receptors and signal chains. It has
only been within the last decade, more than ﬁfty years
after Skoog and Miller puriﬁed the ﬁrst cytokinin, that
the ﬁrst genes involved in cytokinin signaling have been
identiﬁed.
The cytokinin receptor was ﬁnally discovered by
T. Kakimoto and his colleagues who developed an Ara-
bidopsis hypocotyl test to screen for mutants. Hypocotyl
sections, or explants, respond to added cytokinins by
typical cytokinin responses: rapid cell proliferation,
greening, and shoot formation. The cytokinin response
1(cre1) mutant shows none of these responses, even
with a tenfold increase in cytokinin concentration. This
would be expected if the cytokinin receptor were either
missing or nonfunctional in the mutant. Subsequent
experiments conﬁrmed that the wildtype protein CRE1
was in fact a cytokinin receptor. The same gene has also
been identiﬁed as WOODENLEG (WOL), so named
because its mutation retarded root growth, and Ara-
bidopsis HISTIDINE KINASE 4 (AHK4).
20.4.1 THE CYTOKININ RECEPTOR IS
A MEMBRANE-BASED HISTIDINE
KINASE
CRE1 is the ﬁrst component of a two-component reg-
ulatory system—a type of regulatory system previously
known to operate in bacteria and other prokaryotes. The
name comes from the bacterial conﬁguration where the
receptor (or sensor)—the ﬁrst component—activates
a response regulator (RR)—the second component.
Response regulators in turn either regulate the tran-
scription of target genes or modulate other metabolic
reactions. In addition to serving as hormone recep-
tors, two-component regulatory systems also function
in osmosensing (Chapter 1), light sensing, and other
forms of sensory perception.
CRE1 is an intracellular histidine kinase (HK)
with three domains (Figure 20.12). The sensor domain,
at the N-terminal end of the protein, includes two small,
hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions that anchor
the receptor in the plasma membrane. Between them
is a hydrophilic loop that extends into the extracellu-
lar space. This loop includes the cytokinin-binding site
since a mutation at this site interferes with cytokinin
binding and renders the receptor inoperative. The his-
tidine kinase domain is located on the cytoplasmic side
of the membrane. The term kinase identiﬁes HK as an
enzyme involved in a phosphorylation reaction and the
reference to histidine kinase means that the phospho-
ryl group is added to a histidine residue. The phosphate
attaches to a speciﬁc histidine residue (His459) in the his-
tidine kinase domain. The histidine kinase also includes
two receiver domains, Da and Db.
Once it became evident that the acceptor was a
histidine kinase, the fully sequenced Arabidopsis genome
could be searched for other potential components
of the signaling system. Arabidopsis is now known to

have the genes for eight different histidine kinases, six
histidine-phosphotransfer proteins, and 23 response
regulators. Only three of the HK genes (CRE1,
AHK2, AHK3) encode cytokinin receptors. At least
two are ethylene receptors and one is believed to be
an osmosensor. The reason for such a large number
of response regulators appears to be that many are
expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc manner, which allows for
a more ﬁnely tuned, tissue-speciﬁc signaling output.

when cytokinin binds with the input domain in the extracellular space. Cytokinin binding induces dimerization and
autophosphorylation of the acceptor histidine kinase. The phosphorelay system begins with the transfer of the phos-
phoryl group ﬁrst to an aspartic acid residue (D) in the receiver domain and then to a histidine residue in a separate
histidine phosphotransfer protein (HPT). The phosphorylated HPT migrates into the nucleus where the phosphoryl
group is transferred to either a B-type or A-type response regulator (RR). The activated B-type response regulator
then activates transcription of cytokinin primary response genes, including the A-type response regulator. The A-type
response regulators may down-regulate cytokinin responses by suppressing the activation of B-type response regulators.
Alternatively, A-type response regulators may positively or negatively modulate other cytokinin.

phosphorylation of a histidine residue in each of the
two receptor molecules. Whereas most kinase enzymes
catalyze the addition of a phosphoryl group to a sec-
ond molecule, the histidine kinase receptor autophos-
phorylates, which means that it phosphorylates itself.
The phosphoryl group is then spontaneously trans-
ferred to an aspartic acid residue on the Db receiver
domain.
The
classic
prokaryote
two-component
sys-
tem is comprised of only a receptor kinase and
a
response
regulator
and
the
response
regu-
lator is activated by receiving a phosphoryl group
directly from the histidine kinase. In plants, the
phosphoryl group is passed bucket-brigade fashion
through
one
or
more
histidine-phosphotransfer
proteins (HPTs). The phosphoryl group is transferred
from the receiver domain of the histidine kinase
to a histidine
residue on the HP protein. The
phosphorylated HP protein then migrates into the
nucleus where the phosphoryl group is transferred to
an Asp residue in a response regulator. Note that the
transfer is alternately from histidine to aspartic acid
to histidine to aspartic acid. The system that transfers
phosphoryl groups between the various HKs, HPTs,
and RRs is referred to as a phosphorelay network.
There are two classes of response regulators—the
A-type and the B-type. The role of response reg-
ulators is still being worked out, but in general, it
appears that B-type response regulators are transcrip-
tion factors. When activated by phosphorylation, B-type
response regulators induce the expression of genes that
are responsible for some cytokinin-regulated responses.
Among the target genes for B-type response regu-
lators are the genes for A-type response regulators.
A-type response regulators, however, are not transcrip-
tion factors and do not regulate gene expression. They
apparently modulate cytokinin responses by inﬂuencing
other aspects of metabolism.
The cytokinin system also has a built-in capacity
for shutting down the phosphorelay network when
no cytokinin is present. This conclusion is based on
the ﬁnding that CRE1, aside from its kinase function,
also exhibits phosphatase activity. The activity of a
phosphatase enzyme is the opposite of a kinase—a
phosphatase removes phosphoryl groups. Thus, in
the absence of cytokinin, CRE1 reverses the process,
unloads phosphoryl groups from HPTs, and quickly
inactivates the cytokinin response pathway
SUMMARY
Cytokinins are N6 adenine derivatives with either an
isoprenoid-related side chain or an aromatic side chain.
The most common naturally occurring cytokinins are
isopentenyl adenine and trans-zeatin.
Synthesis of cytokinins begins with the addition of
dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to an adenine nucleotide
(AMP, ADP, or ATP). The nucleotide-phosphate
group is cleaved off to generate the active form.
Although it has long been known that cytokinins are
synthesized in the roots and translocated to the shoot
through the xylem sap, it is now clear the some tissues,
meristems in particular, are under the control of
locally produced cytokinins. Cytokinins are deactivated
by conjugation with sugars and amino acids, or by
oxidative degradation.
Cytokinins, commonly in concert with auxin, are
involved in numerous developmental responses. These
include regulation of cell division, shoot and root initia-
tion, release of axillary bud growth, delay of senescence,
and maintenance of an actively dividing shoot apical
meristem.
Cytokinin receptors are of a class known as
histidine kinases. The signal chain involves a multistep
transfer of phosphoryl group transfer referred to
as a phsophorelay network. The ﬁnal targets are
A- and B-type response regulators. When activated
by phosphorylation, the responses regulators either
activate transcription of cytokinin primary response
genes or modulate other aspects of cytokinin related
metabolism.

Hormones IV: Abscisic Acid, Ethylene,
and Brassinosteroids
Abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and brassinosteroids
(BR) are three hormone classes that are noted for their
involvement in a wide variety of plant responses as well
as extensive interactions with auxins and gibberellins
and, to a lesser extent, with cytokinins. Most of the
current work on each of these three hormones focuses
on working out their physiology, metabolism, and mode
of action by screening for mutations.
In this chapter, we will take each of these three
hormones in turn and look at
•
their biosynthesis and metabolism,
•
the range of physiological effects, and
•
our current understanding of signal perception and
transduction.
21.1 ABSCISIC ACID
Unlike auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins, the hormone
abscisic acid (ABA) is represented by a single 15-carbon
sesquiterpene (Figure 21.1). ABA also appears to have
a more limited range of speciﬁc effects than auxins,
gibberellins, and cytokinins. The name is based on the
once held belief that it was involved in the abscission of
leaves and other organs. It now appears to have nothing
to do with abscision, but the name has stuck (Box 21.1).
The primary functions of ABA are (1) prohibiting
precocious germination and promoting dormancy in
seeds and (2) inducing stomatal closure and the produc-
tion of molecules that protect cells against desiccation
in times of water stress. ABA has also been implicated
in other developmental responses, including the induc-
tion of storage protein synthesis in seeds, heterophylly
(leaves of different shape on the same plant), initiation
of secondary roots, ﬂowering, and senescence.
21.1.1 ABSCISIC ACID IS SYNTHESIZED
FROM A CAROTENOID
PRECURSOR
Once the structure of ABA had been determined,
two possible pathways for the synthesis of ABA were
proposed. In the ‘‘direct pathway,’’ ABA would be syn-
thesized from a 15-carbon terpenoid precursor such
as farnesyl diphosphate (see Figure 19.4). By the late
1970s it had been clearly established that this pathway
was operative in certain fungal plant pathogens that
actively synthesized ABA, but not in plants themselves.
According to the second, or ‘‘indirect pathway,’’ ABA

THE DISCOVERY
OF ABSCISIC ACID
As more investigators became interested in plant
hormone
research,
it
soon
became
evident
that
ether extracts of plant material—used to extract
auxins—frequently contained substances that inter-
fered with the auxin response in the Avena coleoptile
curvature
test.
Initially,
the
principal
interest
of
investigators was to rid extracts of these interfering
substances. As time went on, however, interest turned
toward the possibility that these inhibitors might
themselves be growth regulators in their own right.
The advent of paper chromatography as an analytical
tool made it possible to achieve better separation of
the various substances in crude extracts. In 1953,
Bennet-Clark and Kefford reported that plant extracts
contained, in addition to IAA, a substance that inhibited
growth
of
coleoptile
sections,
which
they
called
inhibitor β. The observation that large amounts of
inhibitor β could be isolated from axillary buds and
the outer layer of dormant potato tuber led Kefford to
suggest that it was involved in apical dominance and
maintaining dormancy in potatoes. Meanwhile, other
investigators reported the occurrence of inhibitors
in buds and leaves that appeared to correlate with
the onset of dormancy in woody plants. In 1964,
P. F. Waring proposed the term ‘‘dormin’’ for these
endogenous, dormancy-inducing substances.
In another line of study, substances that acceler-
ated abscission were isolated from senescing leaves of
bean and from cotton and lupin fruits. These substances
would accelerate abscission when applied to excised
abscission zones and were called ‘‘abscission II.’’ These
several lines of study came to a head in the mid-1960s
when three laboratories independently reported the
puriﬁcation and chemical characterization of abscisin
II, inhibitor β, and dormin. All three substances proved
to be chemically identical.
It is not unusual in such cases that there was some
disagreement over what this substance should be called.
Although abscisin II had priority (it was the ﬁrst to be
crystallized and chemically characterized), some felt the
term awkward and argued it did not adequately describe
its range of effects. Finally, a panel of scientists active
in research on abscisin II and dormin was charged with
proposing an acceptable name. The name abscisic acid
and abbreviation ABA were recommended by this panel
to the 1967 International Conference on Plant Growth
Substances, which met in Ottawa. The recommendation
was accepted by the Conference and the term abscisic
acid is now in universal use.

sented by a single compound.
was produced from the cleavage of a carotenoid such
as β-carotene. Originally proposed in the late 1960s,
the indirect pathway was based on structural similar-
ities between carotenoid pigments and ABA and has
since received support from a variety of biochemical
studies, 18O2-labeling experiments, and, most recently,
the characterization of ABA biosynthetic mutants. The
cleavage of carotenoids, especially β-carotene, to pro-
duce useful biochemicals is not without precedent. The
cyanobacterium Microcystis, for example, produces a C10
metabolite by cleavage of β-carotene. Mammals pro-
duce vitamin A by cleavage of β-carotene and cleavage of
β-carotene to produce 2 molecules of the photoreceptor
retinal (C20) has been reported.
There is now a growing body of evidence sup-
porting the indirect synthesis of ABA from β-carotene
via the 40-carbon terpene violaxanthin (Figure 21.2).
First, a series of viviparous mutants in maize (described
further below) were found to have reduced levels of
both carotenoids and ABA. These mutants, shown to
be affected in the early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis,
establish a strong correlation between carotenoid and
ABA biosynthesis. Second, the carbon skeleton of ABA
and the position of the oxygen-containing substituents
are very similar to that of violaxanthin. J. A. D. Zeevaart
and his colleagues compared the incorporation of 18O2,
a stable isotope of oxygen, into ABA in water-stressed
leaves and turgid leaves of several species. The pat-
tern of 18O2-enrichment in the carboxyl group of ABA
was consistent with the cleavage of a xanthophyll and
its rapid conversion to ABA in water-stressed leaves.
Third, it is known that violaxanthin can be degraded in
the light in vitro to a 15-carbon derivative, xanthoxin, a
natural constituent of plants. If radio-labeled xanthoxin
is fed to bean or tomato plants, some of the radioactivity
appears in ABA. In ABA-deﬁcient tomato mutants, how-
ever, conversion of radio-labeled xanthoxin into ABA is
reduced relative to wildtype plants. Finally, at least

the synthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) from
glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruviate via
the methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. IPP
in the chloroplast gives rise to a variety of C10, C20, and
C40 terpenoids, including β-carotene. β-Carotene is con-
verted to violaxanthin, which is cleaved by the enzyme
nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) to yield
xanthoxin, a C15 precursor to ABA, and a 25-carbon
‘‘byproduct.’’
two groups have reported a stoichiometric relationship
between losses of violaxanthin and increases in ABA in
stressed etiolated bean leaves.
Although ABA is synthesized in the cytosol, its
biosynthetic pathway begins in the chloroplast (and
possibly other plastids in nongreen cells), which is
where carotenoid pigments are produced (Figure 21.2.
See also Figure 19.4). The critical enzyme is nine-cis-
expoycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). This enzyme
cleaves the 40-carbon carotenoid violaxanthin to pro-
duce a 15-carbon product, xanthoxin, and a 25-carbon
‘‘by-product.’’ Xanthoxin is then converted to abscisic
aldehyde by an alcohol dehydrogenase. Abscisic al-
dehyde is in turn oxidized to abscisic acid by abscisic
aldehyde oxidase. The enzyme NCED and, conse-
quently xanthoxin production, is known to be targeted
in the chloroplast while the alcohol dehydrogenase and
abscisic aldehyde oxidase are located in the cytosol.
This means that xanthoxin must migrate from the
chloroplast into the cytosol, although the mechanism
of migration is not yet known.
21.1.2 ABSCISIC ACID IS DEGRADED
TO PHASEIC ACID BY
OXIDATION
Abscisic acid is rapidly metabolized when it is applied
exogenously to plant tissues. In wilted bean leaves,
for example, the half-time for turnover (the time for
one-half of the labeled ABA to be destroyed) was esti-
mated to be about three hours. A glucose ester of
ABA has been found in low concentration in a variety of
plants, but the principal metabolic route seems to be oxi-
dation to phaseic acid (PA) and subsequent reduction of
the ketone group on the ring to form dihydrophaseic acid
(DPA) (Figure 21.3). At least some tissues appear to carry
the metabolism further to form the 4′-glucoside of DPA.
DPA and its glucoside are both metabolically inactive.
21.1.3 ABSCISIC ACID IS SYNTHESIZED
IN MESOPHYLL CELLS, GUARD
CELLS, AND VASCULAR TISSUE
There are a lot of open questions about the sites of
ABA synthesis in the plant. Earlier physiological studies
indicated that abscisic acid was found predominantly in
mature, green leaves, especially in water-stressed plants.
This would ﬁt with the more recent biochemical and
genomic studies described above showing that ABA pre-
cursors originate in chloroplasts but ABA itself is formed
in the cytoplasm. There is also evidence that ABA may
be stored in the chloroplasts (Chapter 13). At low pH,
ABA exists in the protonated form ABAH, which freely
permeates most cell membranes. The dissociated form
ABA−is impermeant because it is a charged molecule
that does not readily cross membranes. In actively
photosynthesizing mesophyll cells the cytosol will be
moderately acidic (pH 6.0 to 6.5) while the chloroplast
stroma is alkaline (pH 7.5 to 8.0). Thus, ABAH diffuses
readily from the cytosol into the chloroplast stroma,
where it dissociates and beomes trapped. This stored
ABA can later be released when photosynthesis shuts
down and the stroma pH declines.
Abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO) expression is
induced in guard cells under conditions of water stress
and NCED expression has been detected in guard cells
of senescing leaves and cotyledons. Thus it appears
that ABA is also synthesized directly in the guard cells.
Furthermore, expression of ABA biosynthetic genes
(NCED and others) has been localized in phloem
companion cells and xylem parenchyma cells of fully
turgid plants. This indicates that vascular tissues are
also a site of ABA synthesis in unstressed plants.
Abscisic acid is highly mobile and moves quickly
out of the leaves to other parts of the plant, especially
sink tissues. For example, radioactively labeled abscisic
acid applied to soybean leaves can be detected in the
roots within 15 minutes. Developing seeds also import

acid.
large amounts of abscisic acid from the leaves. There is
also some evidence that under conditions of water stress,
ABA either stored or synthesized in the roots is rapidly
exported to the leaves (See Section 21.1.5).
21.1.4 ABSCISIC ACID REGULATES
EMBRYO MATURATION AND
SEED GERMINATION
The development of embryos and subsequent germi-
nation of the seed is characterized by often dramatic
changes in hormone levels (refer to Figure 16.10). In
most seeds, cytokinin levels are highest during the very
early stages of embryo development when the rate of cell
division is also highest. As the cytokinin level declines
and the seed enters a period of rapid cell enlargement,
both GA and IAA levels increase. In the early stages of
embryogenesis, there is little or no detectable ABA. It
is only during the latter stages of embryo development,
as GA and IAA levels begin to decline, that ABA levels
begin to rise. ABA levels generally peak during the mat-
uration stage, when seed volume and dry weight also
reach a maximum, and then return to lower levels in
the dry seed. Maturation of the embryo is characterized
by cessation of embryo growth, accumulation of nutri-
ent reserves in the endosperm, and the development of
tolerance to desiccation.
The timing of ABA accumulation to coincide with
embryo maturation reﬂects the critical role that ABA
plays in the maturation process. One of the functions of
a seed, of course, is to disperse the population and ensure
survival of the species through unfavorable conditions.
A seed would be of little value if the embryo did not
enter dormancy but continued to grow and establish a
new plant before dispersal could occur. One function
of ABA is to prevent such precocious germination, or
vivipary, while the seed is still on the mother plant.
The relationship between ABA and precocious ger-
mination is clear. Vivipary can be chemically induced
in maize by treatment of the developing ear at the
appropriate time with ﬂuridone, a chemical inhibitor
of carotenoid biosynthesis. Since carotenoids and ABA
share early biosynthetic steps, ﬂuridone inhibits biosyn-
thesis of ABA as well. Fluridone-induced vivipary can be
at least partially alleviated by application of exogenous
ABA. Soybean embryos can be encouraged to germi-
nate precociously by treatments such as washing or slow
drying, both of which lower the endogenous ABA level.
Precocious germination will occur when the ABA con-
centration is reduced to 3 to 4 μg per g fresh weight of
seed, a level that is not normally reached until the late
stages of seed maturation.
The strongest indication of a role for ABA in pre-
venting precocious germination, however, comes from
the study of viviparous mutants. At least four viviparous
mutants in maize (vp2, vp5, vp7, vp9) are known to be
ABA-biosynthetic mutants with reduced levels of ABA in
the seeds. One maize mutant, vp1, appears to have nor-
mal ABA levels but is missing what is believed to be an
ABA-speciﬁc transcription factor. All of these mutants
germinate prematurely on the cob before the seeds have
entered dormancy. Viviparous mutants are also known
for Arabidopsis. ABA also stimulates protein accumula-
tion in the latter stages of soybean embryo development
and is known to prevent GA-induced α-amylase biosyn-
thesis in cereal grains. All of these results establish a
strong connection between ABA and seed maturation
and/or prevention of precocious germination.
ABA also initiates desiccation of the seed, although
the mechanisms are unknown. This may involve ABA
regulation of genes which encode proteins that are
involved in desiccation tolerance.
21.1.5 ABSCISIC ACID MEDIATES
RESPONSE TO WATER STRESS
Plants generally respond to acute water deﬁcits by clos-
ing their stomata in order to match transpirational water
loss from the leaf surface with the rate at which water
can be resupplied by the roots. Since the discovery of
ABA in the late 1960s, it has been known to have a
prominent role in stomatal closure during water stress.
In fact, ABA has long been recognized as antitranspirant
because of its capacity to induce stomatal closure and
thus reduce water loss through transpiration.
ABA accumulates in water-stressed (that is, wilted)
leaves and exogenous application of ABA is a powerful
inhibitor of stomatal opening. Furthermore, two toma-
to mutants, known as ﬂacca and sitiens, fail to accumulate
normal levels of ABA and both wilt very readily. The
precise role of ABA in stomatal closure in water-stressed

ABA equilibrates with the chloroplasts of the photosyn-
thetic mesophyll cells or is carried to the stomatal guard
cells in the apoplast.
whole plants has, however, been difﬁcult to decipher
with certainty. This is because ABA is ubiquitous, often
occurring in high concentrations in nonstressed tissue.
Also, some early studies indicated that stomata would
begin to close before increases in ABA content could be
detected.
According to current thinking, the initial detection
of water stress in leaves is related to its effects on
photosynthesis. Inhibition of electron transport and
photophosphorylation in the chloroplasts would disrupt
proton accumulation in the thylakoid lumen and lower
the stroma pH. At the same time, there is an increase in
the pH of the apoplast surrounding the mesophyll cells.
The resulting pH gradient stimulates a release of ABA
from the mesophyll cells into the apoplast, where it can
be carried in the transpiration stream to the guard cells
(Figure 21.4).
As noted above, wilted leaves accumulate large
quantities of ABA. In most cases, however, stomatal
closure begins before there is any signiﬁcant increase in
the ABA concentration. This could be explained by the
release of stored ABA into the apoplast, which occurs
early enough and in sufﬁcient quantity—the apoplast
concentration will at least double—to account for initial
closure. Increased ABA synthesis follows and serves to
prolong the closing effect.
Stomatal closure does not always rely on the per-
ception of water deﬁcits and signals arising within the
leaves. In some cases it appears that the stomata close in
response to soil desiccation well before there is any mea-
surable reduction of turgor in the leaf mesophyll cells.
Several studies have indicated a feed-forward control
system that originates in the roots and transmits infor-
mation to the stomata. In these experiments, plants are
grown such that the roots are equally divided between
two containers of soil (Figure 21.5A). Water deﬁcits
can then be introduced by withholding water from
one container while the other is watered regularly.
Control plants receive regular watering of both con-
tainers. Stomatal opening along with factors such as
ABA levels, water potential, and turgor are compared
between half-watered plants and fully watered controls.
Typically, stomatal conductance, a measure of stomatal
opening, declines within a few days of withholding water
from the roots (Figure 21.5B), yet there is no measurable
change in water potential or loss of turgor in the leaves.
In experiments with day ﬂower (Commelina communis),
there was a signiﬁcant increase in ABA content of the
roots in the dry container and in the leaf epidermis
(Figure 21.6). Furthermore, ABA is readily translocated
from roots to the leaves in the transpiration stream, even
when roots are exposed to dry air. These results suggest
that ABA is involved in some kind of early warning
system that communicates information about soil water
potential to the leaves.
21.1.6 OTHER ABSCISIC ACID
RESPONSES
There is recent evidence that ABA may also have a
role in lateral or secondary root development. The
initiation and development of lateral roots is known to
be primarily under the control of auxin, but lateral root
development can be inhibited by ABA if the hormone is
applied during early stages of lateral root development,
before the lateral root meristem becomes organized.
Earlier studies also indicated an impact of exoge-
nous ABA on ﬂower formation under certain conditions,
but the data was equivocal. In particular, no causal rela-
tionship could be established between endogenous ABA
levels and ﬂowering behavior. However, the prospect of
a role for ABA in ﬂowering has been revived recently
with the discovery that, under conditions that would
normally delay ﬂowering, ABA-deﬁcient mutants of
Arabidopsis produce ﬂowers somewhat earlier than wild-
type plants. This observation suggests that endogenous
ABA may normally inhibit or delay ﬂowering in Ara-
bidopsis. Further support comes from the discovery that
a gene (FCA) previously known to be involved in con-
trolling the time of ﬂowering also has the properties of
an abscisic acid receptor. We will take a closer look at
this receptor in the next section and the role of the FCA
gene in ﬂowering in Chapter 25.

have been studied for decades, the mechanism of
ABA perception and its subsequent signal chain have
remained elusive. As noted earlier, ABA is a weak acid.
As such it is likely to exist in both the protonated
and
unprotonated
forms
in
the
relatively
acidic
environment of the apoplast. In the protonated state it
may diffuse across the plasma membrane and react with
an intracellular receptor or, in the unprotonated form,
it may remain outside the cell to be sensed by a site on
the plasma membrane. Indeed, experiments employing
impermeable ABA derivatives and/or microinjection of
ABA into cells have indicated multiple ABA receptors
at multiple locations.
Over the last 20 years, methods that have normally
been employed to identify hormone receptors have pro-
ven relatively unsuccessful in the search for ABA
receptors. A more recent approach has made use of
antigen-antibody reactions with what are called anti-
idiotypic antibodies. In this method, antibodies raised
against ABA are themselves used as antigens to raise
a
second
group
of
antibodies—the
anti-idiotypic
antibodies—that have binding characteristics similar
to ABA. Thus, any protein that binds with the
anti-idiotypic antibodies could be a putative ABA
receptor. The anti-idiotypic antibodies were then used
to screen the proteins encoded by a complimentary

DNA (cDNA) library for barley aleurone cells. This
approach led to the identiﬁcation of ABAP1, a pro-
tein that is located in the plasma membrane of barley
aleurone cells and that speciﬁcally and reversibly binds
ABA in vitro.
Since the discovery of ABAP1, at least three other
putative ABA receptors have been identiﬁed. One is
a chloroplast protein Magnesium Protoporphyrin-IX
Chetalase H subunit (CHLH, also known as ABAR).
The second is a soluble, ﬂowering-time control protein
FCA isolated from Arabidopsis. Based on similarity of
amino acid sequence, FCA is homologous to the bar-
ley protein ABAP1. FCA interacts with another protein
(FY) to regulate the processing of functional mRNA (see
Chapter 25 for the role of FCA in ﬂowering). The third
putative receptor is a membrane-localized G-protein
coupled receptor (GPCR) identiﬁed as GCR2. The
simple fact that these proteins bind ABA in vitro,
however, does not prove they are true receptors. It
still needs to be demonstrated that loss-of-function
or gain-of-function mutants alter ABA functions in a
predictable manner.
The signal chain for ABA effects, both upstream and
downstream from the hormone, is a subject of intensive
study. The apparently complex interactions between
abiotic signals, receptors, second messengers, and
ABA-induced gene transcription—let alone crosstalk
with other signals—make it difﬁcult to assemble a
deﬁnitive scheme. Still, a number of components
are beginning to fall into place. Most of the recent

FIGURE 21.7 A simpliﬁed schematic illustrating the coordination of ion pumps
by ABA and Ca2+ during closure of stomatal guard cells. ABA is perceived by an
unknown receptor (ABA R) that transmits the ABA signal to inward-rectifying cal-
cium channels via a membrane-associated protein kinase. The kinase is antagonized
by a protein phosphatase (PP). ABA also stimulates the release of Ca2+ from internal
stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), possibly mediated by phospholipid
signaling and/or G protein. The increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration inhibits K+

channels and opens both K+
out and anion channels (A−). The result is a net loss of
ions from the guard cell, followed by a loss of water and turgor, and closure of the
stomatal pore.
ABA-insensitive gene mutations and can be summarized
in the following points.
1. There appears to be rapid turnover of ABA in both
stressed and unstressed plants, but the events that
sense abiotic stress and initiate ABA accumulation
remain unknown.
2. Ca2+ appears to be an important part of the ABA
signal chain, especially in stomatal guard cells.
Ca2+ mediates ABA-induced turgor adjustments
by activating plasma membrane anion channels
(Figure 21.7).
3. The promoter region of some genes contains a
sequence called the ABA response element (ABRE).
Transcription factors known as ABA response ele-
ment binding factors (ABFs) bind to this promoter
region to regulate the activity of many ABA-induced
genes. These genes include putative protective pro-
teins such as enzymes required for the synthesis
of osmolytes or compatible solutes that help the
plant adapt to water stress (Chapter 13), and tran-
scription factors that in turn regulate other changes
in gene expression
4. A number of ABA-insensitive (abi) mutants have
been identiﬁed. At least three insensitive mutants,
abi3, abi 4, and abi 5, impair only seed germination
and early seedling development. All three wildtype
genes (ABI3, 4, 5) encode transcription factors that
are expressed mainly in seeds, suggesting that the
role of ABA in seeds requires gene transcription.

362
Chapter 21 / Hormones IV: Abscisic Acid, Ethylene, and Brassinosteroids
5. A number of ABA-activated protein kinases that
positively regulate ABA responses have been identi-
ﬁed. In addition, ABI1 and ABI2 are protein phos-
phatases that negatively regulate ABA responses. So,
protein phosphorylation events are clearly impor-
tant in ABA signaling.
It will no doubt take some time to sort out all of
these components and those yet to be discovered and
construct a clear model of the signaling chains for various
ABA-mediated responses.
21.2 ETHYLENE
Ethylene is another class of hormones with a single
representative. Ethylene is a simple gaseous hydrocar-
bon with the chemical structure H2C
CH2. Ethylene
is apparently not required for normal vegetative growth,
although it can have a signiﬁcant impact on the devel-
opment of roots and shoots. Ethylene appears to be
synthesized primarily in response to stress and may
be produced in large amounts by tissues undergoing
senescence or ripening. Ethylene is commonly used to
enhance ripening in bananas and other fruits that are
picked green for shipment (Box 21.2). Ethylene is fre-
quently produced when high concentrations of auxins
are supplied to plant tissues and many of the inhibitory
responses to exogenously applied auxin appear to be due
to auxin-stimulated ethylene release rather than auxin
itself.
Ethylene occurs in all plant organs—roots, stems,
leaves, bulbs, tubers, fruits, seeds, and so on—although
the rate of production may vary depending on the stage
of development. Ethylene production will also vary from
tissue to tissue within the organ, but is frequently located
in peripheral tissues. In peach and avocado seeds, for
example, ethylene production appears to be localized
primarily in the seed coats, while in tomato fruit and
mung bean hypocotyls it originates from the epidermal
regions. The off-gassing of ethylene by natural vegeta-
tion is also a signiﬁcant source of atmospheric volatile
organic carbon (VOC).
21.2.1 ETHYLENE IS SYNTHESIZED
FROM THE AMINO ACID
METHIONINE
Despite the early discovery of ethylene, its known
importance in plant development, and its relatively
uncomplicated chemistry, the pathway for ethylene
biosynthesis initially proved difﬁcult to unravel. This
is partly because there were a large number of potential
precursors (sugars, organic acids, or peptides) known to
be present in plant tissues. In addition, until recently,
the enzymes involved have proven too labile to isolate
and study in vitro. Consequently, most of the work has
been carried out in vivo, with all the pitfalls inherent in
such experiments. Moreover, ethylene is a volatile gas
and available analytical methods for its measurement
were simply too insensitive. It wasn’t until the early
1960s that developments in gas chromatography made
it possible to analyze ethylene at physiologically active
concentrations. With the advent of gas chromatography,
the study of ethylene began to advance rapidly.
M. Lieberman and L. W. Mapson ﬁrst demon-
strated in 1964 that methionine was rapidly converted
to ethylene in a cell-free, nonenzymatic model sys-
tem. In subsequent studies, Lieberman and coworkers
conﬁrmed that plant tissues such as apple fruit con-
verted [14C]-methionine to [14C]-ethylene and that the
ethylene was derived from the third and fourth car-
bons of methionine. Little progress was made until
1977 when D. Adams and F. Yang demonstrated that
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was an intermediate in
the conversion of methionine to ethylene by apple tis-
sue. In 1979, Adams and Yang further demonstrated the
accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
acid (ACC) in apple tissue fed [13C]-methionine under
anaerobic conditions—conditions that inhibit the pro-
duction of ethylene. However, upon reintroduction of
oxygen, the labeled ACC was rapidly converted to ethy-
lene. ACC is a nonprotein amino acid that had been
isolated from ripe apples in 1957, but its relationship
to ethylene was not obvious at that time. These results
established that ACC is an intermediate in the biosyn-
thesis of ethylene.
The three-step pathway for ethylene biosynthesis in
higher plants is shown in Figure 21.8. In the ﬁrst step, an
adenosine group (i.e., adenine plus ribose) is donated to
methionine by a molecule of ATP, thus forming SAM.
An ATP requirement is consistent with earlier evidence
that ethylene production is blocked by inhibitors of
oxidative phosphorylation, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol.
Conversion of methionine to SAM is catalyzed by
the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase or SAM
synthetase.
The cleavage of SAM to yield 5′-methylthio-
adenosine (MTA) and ACC, mediated by the enzyme
ACC synthase, is the rate-limiting step. ACC synthase
was the ﬁrst enzyme in the pathway to be studied in
detail. The enzyme has been partially puriﬁed from
tomato and apple fruit but, because of its instability and
low abundance, progress toward its puriﬁcation and
characterization has been slow. More recently, genes
for ACC synthase have been isolated from zucchini
(Cucurbita) fruit and tomato pericarp tissue. The cloned
genes direct the synthesis of active ACC synthase in the
bacterium E. coli and yeast, making it possible to produce
the enzyme in sufﬁcient quantity for further study.
The enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ACC to
ethylene, previously referred to as the ethylene-forming
enzyme but now known as ACC oxidase, proved

THE DISCOVERY
OF ETHYLENE
The effect of ethylene on plants was originally described
by Dimitry Nikolayevich Neljubow, a graduate student
in Russia in 1886, who found that abnormal growth of
dark-grown pea seedlings could be traced to ethylene
emanating from illuminating gas. Interest in ethylene as
a plant growth factor, however, did not gain real momen-
tum until it was found to have commercial implications.
Those whose business involves the shipping and
storing of fruit have long been aware that ripe and
rotting fruit could accelerate the ripening of other fruit
stored nearby. For example, bananas picked in Cuba
and shipped by boat often arrived in New York in
an overripe and unmarketable condition. One of the
earliest reports that these effects were due to a volatile
substance given off by plant tissue was published in 1910
by H. H. Cousins in an annual report of the Jamaican
Department of Agriculture. He discovered that ripe
oranges released a volatile product that would accelerate
ripening of bananas stored with them. A number of
similar reports appeared in the early 1930s, showing
that volatile emanations from apples caused epinasty
in tomato seedlings and respiratory changes associated
with the ripening process. In 1934, R. Gane provided
indisputable evidence that the volatile substance was
ethylene.
especially difﬁcult to isolate in the active form. ACC
oxidase was ﬁnally identiﬁed when a gene cloned from
ripening tomato fruit (pTOM13) was linked to ethylene
production.
Another important aspect of ethylene biosynthe-
sis is the limited amount of free methionine available
in plants. In order to sustain normal rates of ethy-
lene production, the sulfur released during ethylene
formation must be recycled back to methionine. This
is accomplished by what is commonly referred to as
the methionine cycle (Figure 21.8). This cycle is also
known as the Yang cycle, after S. F. Yang, who carried
out much of the pioneering work on ethylene biosyn-
thesis. Double-labeling experiments have shown that
the CH3S-group is salvaged and recycled as a unit. The
remaining four carbon atoms of methionine are supplied
by the ribose moiety of the ATP used originally to form
SAM. The amino group is provided by a transamination
reaction.
Ethylene production is promoted by a number
of factors including IAA, wounding, and water stress,
principally by the induction of the synthesis of ACC
synthase. Induction of this enzyme in plant tissues is
blocked by inhibitors of both protein and RNA syn-
thesis, suggesting that induction probably occurs at the
transcriptional level. In E. coli carrying the cloned ACC
synthase gene, the physical abundance of ACC syn-
thase messenger RNA also increases in response to IAA

and wounding. Control of ethylene production thus
appears to be exercised primarily through transcrip-
tional regulation of the ACC synthase gene. Ethylene
production is also stimulated by ethylene itself, a form of
autocatalysis. This is commonly seen in ripening fruits
(see Chapter 25) where ethylene apparently stimulates
an increase in both ACC synthesis and its subsequent
conversion to ethylene.
21.2.2 EXCESS ETHYLENE IS SUBJECT
TO OXIDATION
Unlike other hormones, ethylene is a volatile gas that
is readily given off to the atmosphere. Ethylene can,
however, be metabolized by oxidation to carbon dioxide
or by conversion to either ethylene oxide or ethylene
glycol. It has not yet been established whether ethylene
metabolism has any active role in the physiological
action of the hormone. In fact, kinetic studies have
indicated that ethylene metabolism is a straightforward
chemical reaction not subject to normal physiological
controls. It may thus be only a nonessential consequence
of high ethylene levels in the tissue. It is therefore likely
that most tissues lose excess ethylene by simple diffusion
into the surrounding atmosphere.
21.2.3 THE STUDY OF ETHYLENE
PRESENTS A UNIQUE SET
OF PROBLEMS
Because ethylene is a simple gaseous hydrocarbon that
readily diffuses from its site of synthesis, study of its
role in development presents a unique set of prob-
lems. Although known primarily for its effects on fruit
ripening and its synthesis by many tissues in response
to stress, ethylene is known to affect virtually every
aspect of plant growth and development. As a byproduct
of hydrocarbon combustion, ethylene is also a com-
mon environmental pollutant that can play havoc with
greenhouse cultures or laboratory experiments. In addi-
tion, ethylene biosynthesis is also stimulated by high
levels of auxin and other hormones. Still, our under-
standing of ethylene physiology has made tremendous
strides over the past several decades, owing largely
to development of the gas chromatograph, the avail-
ability of ethylene-releasing agents, and the study of
ethylene-insensitive mutants. The gas chromatograph
has made possible quantitative analysis of ethylene at
extremely low concentrations that could not other-
wise be measured. Ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic
acid) is a compound that, at physiological pH, readily
decomposes to produce ethylene. Use of ethephon is
advantageous in the laboratory as its application and
concentration is often more easily controlled compared
with gaseous ethylene.
21.2.4 ETHYLENE AFFECTS MANY
ASPECTS OF VEGETATIVE
DEVELOPMENT
Ethylene is known primarily for its promotion of fruit
ripening and senescence. Ethylene control of fruit devel-
opment has been studied extensively in tomato, which
is a climacteric fruit. During the development of cli-
macteric fruits there is a characteristic developmentally
regulated burst in respiration called the climacteric rise.
The climacteric rise is normally accompanied by ethy-
lene production and is followed by the expression of
a set of genes that enhance ripening-related activities
such as development of fruit color, ﬂavor, and texture.
The tomato never ripe mutant is insensitive to ethylene
because it has a defective ethylene receptor protein.
Consequently, the ‘‘ripening genes’’ are not expressed
and, although the fruit reaches full size, it never develops
the red color, ﬂavor, and texture characteristic of a ripe
tomato.
Ethylene has been shown to stimulate elongation
of stems, petioles, roots, and ﬂoral structures of aquatic
and semiaquatic plants. The effect is particularly noted
in aquatic plants because submergence reduces gas dis-
persion and thus maintains higher internal ethylene
levels. In rice, ethylene is ineffective in the presence of
saturating levels of gibberellins, which also promotes
stem elongation. Moreover, ethylene promotes gib-
berellin synthesis in rice and the elongation effect can
be blocked with antigibberellins, which suggests that
gibberellin mediates this ethylene effect. By contrast,
root and shoot elongation in nonaquatic plants such as
peas (Pisum sativum) is inhibited by ethylene.
Ethylene stimulates many inhibitory and abnormal
growth responses such as the swelling of stem tissues
and the downward curvature of leaves, or epinasty. Leaf
epinasty occurs because of excessive cell elongation on
the adaxial (i.e., upper) side of the petiole. Epinasty is
a common response to water logging of ﬂood-sensitive
plants such as tomato (Lycopersicum) and is actually a
response to anoxia in the region of the roots. The
more vertical orientation of epinastic leaves reduces the
absorption of solar energy and, consequently, transpi-
rational water loss. This helps to bring water loss more
into line with reduced capacity for water uptake in plants
suffering root anoxia.
A role for ethylene has also been noted for pro-
motion of seed germination, inhibition of bud break,
reduced apical dominance, fruit ripening, cell death,
and pathogen responses. Ethylene can be a problem in
commercial greenhouse that are heated with gas-ﬁred
heating systems.
21.2.5 ETHYLENE RECEPTORS
AND SIGNALING
One of the best-known effects of ethylene is referred to
as the ‘‘triple response’’ of etiolated (dark-grown) dicot

21.2 Ethylene
365
seedlings (Figure 21.9). This response is characterized
by inhibition of hypocotyl and root cell elongation, a
pronounced radial swelling of the hypocotyl, and exag-
gerated curvature of the plumular hook. The response
is rapid (3 days post-germination) and allows large
populations of seedlings to be screened for ethylene
mutations. An absence of the triple response in the pres-
ence of exogenous ethylene has been used successfully to
identify ethylene-resistant mutants and other ethylene
response defects, especially in experiments conducted
with Arabidopsis. These mutants generally fall into one of
three distinct categories: (1) constitutive triple-response
mutants that exhibit the triple response in the absence
of ethylene, (2) ethylene-insensitive mutants, and (3)
mutants in which ethylene-insensitivity is limited to
speciﬁc tissues, such as the plumular hook or root elon-
gation. As a result of these experiments, several ethylene
receptors and downstream elements in the ethylene
signal chain have been identiﬁed.
Ethylene is perceived by a family of ﬁve membrane-
associated, two-component histidine kinase receptors.
Unlike most other two-component receptors, which
are localized in the plasma membrane, it has been
shown convincingly that the Arabidopsis receptor ETR1
is associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). The speciﬁc advantage(s) to localiza-
tion of the receptor in the ER rather than the plasma
membrane is not clear, but since ethylene diffuses read-
ily in both aqueous and lipid environments, ethylene
would have ready access to any subcellular location.

Plant Cell 2:513–523.)
The sensor domain of the ethylene receptor has three
membrane-spanning regions and is assumed to function
as a dimer. The sensor domain also contains a copper
cofactor that is necessary for ethylene binding. A unique
characteristic of the ethylene response system is that the
receptors are believed to be constitutively active. This
means that the receptors and subsequent signal chain
are functional in the absence of ethylene and that ethylene,
in effect, turns the system off.
Although there are some variations,
ethylene
signaling appears to follow the general model shown
in Figure 21.10. In the absence of ethylene, the signal
chain begins with a protein called Constitutive Triple

sensed by a family of two-component histidine kinase
receptors (ETR) that are located in the membrane of
the endoplasmic reticulum. In the absence of ethy-
lene the receptors are functionally active and activate
a serine-threonine kinase (CTR1). CTR1 is the ﬁrst
component in a protein kinase cascade that ultimately
targets one or more transcription factors. Phosphoryla-
tion activates the transcription factors that are then able
to bind to the promoter regions of ethylene-sensitive
genes and enable transcription of the genes. Ethylene
binding inhibits receptor function and blocks the acti-
vation of CTR1, thus shutting down the protein kinase
cascade, preventing phosphorylation of the transcription
factor, and turning off the gene.

Response 1 (CTR1). CTR1 physically interacts with
the histidine kinase domain of the receptor ETR1.
This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of CTR1
and initiates the signal transduction stream. CTR1 is a
serine/threonine protein kinase. According to this
model, CTR1 initiates a protein kinase cascade that
ultimately results in the phosphorylation of one or more
transcription factors and the constitutive expression of
certain genes. The protein kinase cascade is very similar
to a widely known group of mitogen-activated protein
kinases that serve a critical role in the transduction of
many signals in animals, plants, and fungi (Box 21.3).
CTR1 is equivalent to a MAPKKK and several potential
candidates for the other kinases in the MAPK cascade

MITOGEN-

PROTEIN KINASE:
A WIDESPREAD
MECHANISM
FOR SIGNAL
TRANSDUCTION
The capacity of extracellular signals such as hormones,
light, osmotic status, and stress to effect a change in
the physiology of cells often depends on regulating the
transcription of genes. The expression of a gene in
turn depends on the binding of activated transcription
factors to the DNA in the promoter region of the
gene. One of the primary means for regulating this
interaction between a transcription factor and DNA
is phosphorylation. Some transcription factors will not
bind to DNA unless they are phosphorylated, while
phosphorylation inhibits the binding of others.
Many extracellular signals are linked to transcrip-
tion factor phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) system (Figure 21.11). Origi-
nally named for its role in activation of genes involved in
cell proliferation (mitogen = to stimulate mitosis), the
MAPK system is known to mediate gene transcription
in response to a variety of signals in animals, plants, and
fungi.
The core of the MAPK system is a sequence of
three kinase enzymes. Each enzyme acts to effect the
phosphorylation of the next enzyme in the sequence.
Starting at the bottom end, the third enzyme in the
sequence, MAP kinase (MAPK), is responsible for phos-
phorylating a transcription factor. MAPK is in turn
phosphorylated by an MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK or
MAP2K), which is phosphorylated by an MAP kinase
kinase kinase (MAPKKK, or MAP3K). MAPKKK can
be activated directly by a signal-receptor complex, a
G-protein, or some other secondary signal.
There are two advantages to this system. The ﬁrst is
that each kinase is able to phosphorylate multiple copies
of the next component—hence the name ‘‘cascade.’’
The second advantage is that each of the components
is represented by a small family of proteins. By utilizing
different members of each family in various combi-
nations, the cell is able to assemble a large number of
different pathways that can interpret different extracellu-
lar signals and activate a variety of different transcription
factors.

activation may be mediated by a G-protein or other sec-
ond messenger system. The ﬁrst kinase in the cascade,
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP-
KKK) phosphorylates the second kinase, MAP kinase
kinase (MAPKK), which in turn phosphorylates the third
component, MAP kinase (MAPK). The ultimate target is
the phosphorylation of a transcription factor. The acti-
vated transcription factor binds to the promoter region
of the target gene and up-regulates transcription of the
gene. One of the genes whose expression is stimulated is
MKP1, a protein phosphatase that can remove the phos-
phate group from MAPK and block gene activation.

stream have recently been identiﬁed in Arabidopsis.
When ethylene binds with the receptor, it prevents
the interaction of CTR1 with ETR1. This blocks the
initiation of the protein kinase cascade and subsequent
gene activation. The result is that in the absence of
ethylene the expression of ethylene-controlled genes is
always ‘‘on.’’ The effect of ethylene is to turn these
genes ‘‘off ’’ by preventing the activation of the required
transcription factors.
21.3 BRASSINOSTEROIDS
Brassinosteroids are steroid hormones with a chemical
structure similar to the steroid hormones in animals.
Brassinosteroids elicit an impressive array of develop-
mental responses, including an increased rate of stem
and pollen tube elongation, increased rates of cell divi-
sion (in the presence of auxin and cytokinin), seed
germination, leaf morphogenesis, apical dominance,
inhibition of root elongation, vascular differentiation,
accelerated senescence, and cell death. Brassinosteroids
are also implicated in mediating responses to both
abiotic and biotic stress, including salt, drought, tem-
perature extremes, and pathogens.
The study of brassinosteroids as plant hormones
dates back to the early 1970s, when a group of agricul-
tural researchers began screening pollen, already known
as a rich source of growth-promoting substances. The
result was a complex mixture of lipids that stimulated
elongation of bean second internodes. Because the most
active preparations were isolated from pollen of the rape
plant (Brassica napus), the active substances were referred
to collectively as brassins.
Many of the effects of the brassins were similar to
those of GA, leading many to believe the extracts were
simply crude extracts of gibberellins, rather than a new
class of hormones as originally proposed. However, in
1979, M. D. Grove and his coworkers identiﬁed the
active component as brassinolide (BL) (Figure 21.12).
The very low concentration of brassinosteroids in plant
tissues is suggested by the fact that approximately 40
kilograms of bee-collected rape pollen were required in
order to obtain only 4 milligrams of pure, crystalline
BL! Fortunately, BL was chemically synthesized only
two years later, eliminating the need for such massive
and laborious extraction procedures.
For many years, the classiﬁcation of brassinosteroids
as hormones was not widely accepted. Effects could
be demonstrated only by exogenous application and it
was difﬁcult to assess their function in vivo. This all
changed with the discovery of mutants of Arabidopsis,
pea, and tomato that are blocked in brassinosteroid
biosynthesis. In all cases, the normal phenotype could
be rescued by the application of brassinosteroids. These

studies clearly established that brassinosteroids have
some well-deﬁned functions in normal plant develop-
ment and qualify as a distinct class of endogenous plant
hormones. More than 40 analogs of BL have now been
isolated from more than 60 plant species and virtually
all types of tissues, including pollen, seeds, leaves, stems,
roots, and ﬂowers. However, brassinolide remains the
most biologically active brassinosteroid and is widely
distributed throughout the plant kingdom. Like other
hormones, brassinolide is active in micromolar concen-
trations. Brassinolide at a concentration of 10−7 M is
able to stimulate a fourfold increase in the length of
soybean epicotyl sections.
Interestingly, most of the responses controlled by
brassinosteroids are also controlled by auxin. Although
the two hormones can act independently, it should not
be too surprising that there is considerable crosstalk
between brassinosteroid and auxin signaling pathways.
Relatively little is known about the mechanisms for
BR regulation of the many responses it appears to be
involved in. With respect to cell elongation, however,
the evidence indicated that BR increases plastic exten-
sibility of the cell wall by regulating genes encoding
wall-modifying enzymes such as expansins and cellulose
synthase.
21.3.1 BRASSINOSTEROIDS
ARE POLYHYDROXYLATED
STEROLS DERIVED FROM
THE TRITERPENE SQUALENE
Brassinosteroids are polyhydroxylated plant sterols—
lipoidal substances related biosynthetically to the gib-
berellins and abscisic acid (refer to Figure 19.4). Plants
synthesize a large number and variety of sterols, includ-
ing sitosterol, stigmasterol, cholesterol, and campes-
terol. Sterols and sterol derivatives are discussed more
extensively in Chapter 27. Sterols are triterpenoids, C30
molecules that are derived from acetate through the
mevalonic acid pathway (see Figure 19.3A, 19.4). In

368
Chapter 21 / Hormones IV: Abscisic Acid, Ethylene, and Brassinosteroids
the synthesis of terpenes, sequential additions of the
5-carbon isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) produce ter-
penes with 10-, 15-, or 20-carbon atoms. Triterpenes
are formed when two C15 (farnesyl) units join head
to head to form the C30 molecule squalene. The sub-
sequent biosynthesis of plant sterols is not yet fully
understood, but the ﬁrst step is a cyclization reaction to
form cycloartenol (Figure 21.13). Using cycloartenol
as a common precursor, there are probably multiple
pathways leading to the several sterols found in plants.
Decarboxylation and oxidation reactions are involved,
as most common sterols have from 26 to 29 carbons and
a single hydroxyl (—OH) group.
It is thought that most sterols, with the exception
of stigmasterol, may serve as precursors for various
brassinosteroids. However, the pathway for the biosyn-
thesis of brassinolide is best understood. This pathway
was established largely through studies using cultured
cells of Catharanthus roseus. The precursor to brassi-
nolide is campesterol, a C28 sterol. Through a series
of largely oxidative steps, additional hydroxyl (—OH)
groups are added and oxygen is introduced into the
B ring. There are two parallel pathways for the con-
version of campesterol to brassinolide, depending on
whether the oxidation at carbon-6 occurs early or late in
the pathway. In either case, approximately 12 steps are

to various oxidations and methylations to form campesterol and other sterols. The
pathway for synthesis of brassinolide from campesterol has been established in cul-
tured cells of Catharanthus roseus. Two alternate pathways are known, each involving
at least 12 steps.

21.3.2 SEVERAL ROUTES
FOR DEACTIVATION
OF BRASSINOSTEROIDS
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED
Studies into the metabolism of brassinosteroids in
tomato and Ornithopus cells, cucumber, and mung bean
have revealed several deactivation mechanisms. The
α-hydroxyl groups on the A ring may be epimerized
to form a β-hydroxyl, which is then followed by
esteriﬁcation with fatty acids or by glucosylation.
Other possibilities include cleavage of the side chain or
conjugation at other hydroxyl positions. The precise
method for deactivation clearly depends on the species
and possibly the tissue involved.
21.3.3 BRASSINOLIDE RECEPTORS
AND SIGNALING
With the discovery of brassinosteroids in plants, it is now
clear that steroid hormones are not restricted to animals.
Unlike animals, however, which rely mainly on nuclear
receptors for steroid hormones, plants appear to use
membrane-based receptors to initiate a phosphorylation
cascade that carries the signal into the nucleus. Although
genetic studies are beginning to unmask some of the
many components in brassinosteroid perception and
signaling, there remains much to be learned about how
they interact with each other and with signaling for
other biotic and abiotic factors. Figure 21.14 depicts a
general model for brassinosteroid signaling.
The principal receptor for brassinosteroids requires
the interaction of two proteins that form a plasma
membrane-associated heterodimer. The ﬁrst is a
serine/threonine
kinase
known
as
BRASSINOS-
TEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). (Keep in mind
that the name of the gene and protein are based on
observed mutations—hence the name ‘‘insensitive.’’)
The
second
is
the
protein
BRI1-ASSOCIATED
RECEPTOR KINASE (BAK1). Brassinosteroids bind
to the extracellular domain of BRI1, which ﬁrst induces
the dissociation of an inhibitory protein (BKI1) that
inhibits the association of BAK1 with BRI1 and then
promotes dimerization with BAK1 and autophos-
phorylation of BRI1. The phosphorylated complex
initiates BR signaling. One target of brassinosteroid
signaling is the protein BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE
RESISTANT
1).
BZR1 is a transcription
factor
whose location is dependent on its phosphorylation
status. In the phosphorylated state, BZR1 is trapped
in
the
cytoplasm
while
dephosphorylation
allows
it to move into the nucleus. The phosphorylation
status of BZR1 is mediated by two competing factors;
the
BR
signaling
chain
and
a
separate
protein,
BIN2.
BIN2
mediates
phosphorylation
of
BZR1
and thus keeps the protein in the cytoplasm. The
brassinosteroid signal, on the other hand, mediates
dephosphorylation of BZR1, which both activates the
transcription factor and encourages its migration into
the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, BZR1-P binds to
target sites in the promoter region of BR-sensitive
genes and initiates transcription. BR signaling may
also inhibit the phosphorylating ability of BIN2, thus
further ensuring activation and nuclear localization of
BZR1.

tion, is inhibited by the presence of BKI1. BR induces
the removal of BKI1, followed by the dimerization of the
two receptors and auto phosphorylation of kinase region
of BRI1. The targets of the BR signaling chain are tran-
scription factors such as BZR1. The cellular location and
activaty of BR-sensitive transcription factors is deter-
mined by their phosphorylation status. The BR signaling
chain dephosphorylates cytoplasmic BZR1-P, which then
migrates into the nucleus where it enables transcription
of BR-sensitive genes. The protein BIN2 phosphorylates
BZR1, causing it to migrate back into the cytoplasm, thus
inhibiting transcription. BR signaling may also enhance
transcription by blocking BIN2.

Chapter 21 / Hormones IV: Abscisic Acid, Ethylene, and Brassinosteroids
SUMMARY
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a 15-carbon sesquiterpene that
is synthesized by cleavage of the 40-carbon carotene
violaxanthin. It is synthesized primarily in green leaves
and can be stored in the chloroplast, although there is
some evidence that ABA may also be either synthesized
or stored in roots and exported to the leaves in times of
water stress.
The primary functions of ABA are (1) prohibiting
precocious germination and promoting dormancy in
seeds and (2) inducing stomatal closure and the produc-
tion of molecules that protect cells against desiccation
in times of water stress. ABA has also been implicated
in other developmental responses, including hetero-
phylly (leaves of different shape on the same plant),
initiation of secondary roots, ﬂowering, and senes-
cence.
ABA perception and signaling appears to be partic-
ularly complex. Several putative receptors or ABA bind-
ing proteins have been identiﬁed, including ABAP1 in
barley aleurone tissue, a protein involved in ﬂowering,
and a G-protein coupled receptor. A number of other
components of various ABA signaling chains have been
identiﬁed, but a clear model for any one chain has yet
to be constructed.
Ethylene is a simple 2-carbon gaseous hydro-
carbon that appears to be synthesized primarily in
response to stress or in senescing and ripening tis-
sue. Ethylene is ubiquitous in plants, has been impli-
cated in a wide range of developmental responses, and
frequently interacts with auxin and gibberellin. It’s
best-known response is the triple response of etiolated
dicot seedling, characterized by inhibition of hypocotyl
and root cell elongation, a pronounced radial swelling
of the hypocotyl, and exaggerated curvature of the
plumular or epicotyl hook.
Ethylene is synthesized by a simple three-step pro-
cess from the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine.
In order to sustain normal rates of ethylene produc-
tion, the sulphur released during ethylene formation is
recycled back to methionine via the Yang Cycle.
Ethylene is sensed by a membrane-located
histidine kinase receptor that initiates a mitogen-
activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade that results in
the activation of transcription factors. Uniquely in the
case of ethylene, however, the receptor kinase system
is constitutively active (i.e., ‘‘on’’) and is blocked, or
turned ‘‘off,’’ by ethylene.
Brassinosteroids (BR) are steroidal hormones that
elicit a wide range of effects when applied to plants
including an increased rate of stem and pollen tube
elongation, increased rates of cell division (in the pres-
ence of auxin and cytokinin), seed germination, leaf
morphogenesis, apical dominance, inhibition of root
elongation, vascular differentiation, accelerated senes-
cence, and cell death. Brassinosteroid sensing involves
a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the phos-
phorylation and dephosphorylation of transcription
factors.

Photomorphogenesis: Responding to Light
Plants do not enjoy the luxury of being able to change
their environment or to seek shelter from adverse con-
ditions by changing their location. Yet species survival
dictates that plants must be able to avoid adverse con-
ditions. The germination of seeds and survival of the
seedling that emerges are largely dictated by conditions
in their immediate environment. Many seeds will not
germinate if buried too deeply or if they lay in the
shade of a forest canopy. Seedlings that emerge beneath
a canopy tend to have elongated stems, as if reaching
out for the light. Weeds growing in full sun at the
edge of a wheat ﬁeld will be shorter and more com-
pact than plants of the same species competing with the
crop in the center of the ﬁeld. Plants ﬂower at different
times, spreading ﬂowering through the season as though
each species is awaiting some environmental cue. These
and similar patterns of plant behavior have a signiﬁ-
cant survival advantage. They enable plants to make the
best use of available resources, compete effectively with
other species, or anticipate unfavorable environmental
change.
How can seeds and seedlings know where they
are? How can plants ensure they are in a position to
maximize photosynthesis? How do plants measure the
passing of the season? The answers to these and many
other questions directly related to plant survival may be
found in their capacity to detect and interpret a variety
of environmental signals.
One particularly important environmental signal is
light. The quantity and quality of light are constantly
changing, often in predictable ways. Plants are able to
monitor these changes and make use of this information
to direct their growth, form, and reproduction. In this
chapter we

development or photomorphogenesis,

The regulation of plant development by light, or
photomorphogenesis, is a central theme in plant
373

development. In order to acquire and interpret the
information that is provided by light, plants have
developed sophisticated photosensory systems com-
prised of light-sensitive photoreceptors and signal
transduction pathways. A photoreceptor ‘‘reads’’ the
information contained in the light by selectively
absorbing different wavelengths of light. Absorption
of light normally induces a conformational change in
the pigment or an associated protein, a photochemical
oxidation-reduction reaction, or some other form of
photochemical change. Whatever the nature of the
primary event, absorption of light by the photoreceptor
sets into motion a cascade of events that ultimately
results in a developmental response.
There are four classes of photoreceptors in plants.
The phytochromes absorb red (R) and far-red (FR)
light (ca. 660 and 735 nm, respectively) and have a
role in virtually every stage of development from seed
germination to ﬂowering. Cryptochromes and pho-
totropin detect both blue (400–450 nm) and UV-A
light (320–400 nm). The cryptochromes appear to play
major roles during seedling development, ﬂowering,
and resetting the biological clock. Phototropin mediates
phototropic responses, or differential growth in a light
gradient, and will be discussed in the context of these
responses in Chapter 23. A fourth class of photore-
ceptors that mediate responses to low levels of UV-B
(280–320 nm) light have not yet been characterized.
Phytochrome, cryptochrome, and phototropin are
all chromoproteins (Chapter 6). Chromoproteins con-
tain a light-absorbing group, or chromophore, attached
to a protein with catalytic properties, called the apopro-
tein. The chromophore plus the apoprotein is referred
to as the holoprotein.
22.2 PHYTOCHROMES:
RESPONDING TO RED
AND FAR-RED LIGHT
Phytochrome is a unique pigment that can exist in two
states—one with an absorption maximum in the red
(R, or 665 nm) region of the spectrum and one with
an absorption maximum in the far-red (FR, 730 nm)
(Figure 22.1). The pigment is ubiquitous in plants
and its discovery solely on the basis of simple but
elegant physiological experiments ranks among the
major achievements of twentieth-century plant biology
(Box 22.1).
Early phytochrome studies employed almost exclu-
sively a combination of physiological experiments and
physical techniques such as in vivo spectroscopy. It is
interesting to note that even these early physiological
experiments predicted multiple forms of phytochrome.

is actually the spectrum for an equilibrium mixture
of Pfr and Pr (see text for details). Note the differen-
tial absorption in the blue region of the spectrum as
well as the red, far-red region. Some blue light effects
are mediated by phytochrome, but photoconversion by
red light is 50 to 100 times more effective than in the
blue. Because both forms absorb equally in the green
region (500 to 550 nm), green light does not appreciably
change the state of the pigment and can, in most cases, be
used as a safe light when setting up phytochrome experi-
ments.
With the advent of molecular genetics, the existence
of multiple phytochromes in higher plants was con-
ﬁrmed. In most angiosperms, for example, there are
at least three distinct phytochromes: phyA, phyB, and
phyC, encoded by the genes PHYA, PHYB, and PHYC,
respectively.1 Arabidopsis, which has been studied most
extensively, has ﬁve phytochromes (phyA–phyE). The
differences between the several phytochromes are in the
protein—the chromophore is common to all members
of the phytochrome family. The different phytochromes
are expressed in different tissues at different times in
development and mediate different light responses,
although it appears that phyA and phyB are the prin-
cipal species that mediate red and far-red responses.
Phytochromes also interact with each other as well
as with other photoreceptors and developmental stim-
uli, rendering an understanding of their complex signal
transduction pathways one of the more challenging areas
of current study.

BOX 22.1
HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVES—
THE DISCOVERY
OF PHYTOCHROME
It is now well established that phytochrome plays a crit-
ical role in almost every stage of plant development. Its
existence was predicated on the basis of a simple phys-
iological observation: seed germination and growth of
etiolated seedlings exhibited photoreversible responses
to red and far-red light. Because of its uniquely pho-
toreversible character, however, the newly proposed
pigment was initially greeted with skepticism in the
scientiﬁc community.
It had long been recognized that light inﬂuenced
plant development under conditions that excluded sig-
niﬁcant levels of photosynthesis. Indeed, dramatic dif-
ferences in the growth and form of plants in darkness
and light had fascinated botanists and physiologists for
centuries. However, little real progress toward under-
standing these phenomena was achieved until the early
1950s. At that time, H. A. Borthwick, a botanist, and
S. B. Hendricks, a physical chemist, began a study of
action spectra for such diverse phenomena as seed ger-
mination, stem elongation, and photoperiodic control
of ﬂowering. It soon became apparent that all these phe-
nomena shared similar action spectra, with peaks in the
red and far-red. More interesting, however, was the dis-
covery that a response potentiated by red light could be
negated if the red light treatment were followed imme-
diately with far-red light. Such clear photoreversibility
had never before been described in biology. This dis-
tinctive characteristic led Borthwick and Hendricks to
propose the existence of a novel pigment system, later
called phytochrome.
This new, but hypothetical, pigment would exist
in two forms: a red-absorbing form called Pr and a
far-red-absorbing form called Pfr. The pigment would
also be photochromic, which means that absorption of
light would alter its absorbance properties. Absorption
of red light by Pr would convert the pigment to the
far-red-absorbing form while subsequent absorption of
far-red light by Pfr would drive the pigment back to
the red-absorbing form. Solely on the basis of simple
physiological experiments, they were able to predict
several other features of this hypothetical pigment
system. First, because seeds and dark-grown seedling
tissues responded initially to red light, not far-red,
the pigment was probably synthesized as the Pr form.
Moreover, Pr was stable and probably physiologically
inactive. Second, because treatment with red light
initiated germination and other developmental events,
Pfr was probably the active form. On the other hand,
Pfr was apparently unstable and was either destroyed or
could revert to Pr in darkness by a nonphotochemical,
temperature-dependent
reaction.
Third,
because
the
pigment
could
not
be
seen
in
dark-grown,
chlorophyll-free tissue, it was no doubt present at very
low concentration. Borthwick and Hendricks further
surmised that the pigment must be acting catalytically
and was therefore possibly a protein. It is a tribute
to the scientiﬁc acumen of these investigators and
their coworkers that every one of these predictions
was later proven true. Yet, at the time, the existence
of phytochrome was met with some skepticism within
the scientiﬁc community, largely because there was no
precedent for such a photoreversible pigment in the
plant or animal research literature.

to Pr (dashed curve), causes the expected increase in
absorbance in the red and a decrease in the far-red
regions of the spectrum. The difference spectrum
effectively represents the absorption spectrum of
the Pr form. These data represent the ﬁrst physi-
cal demonstration of the existence of phytochrome.

Chapter 22 / Photomorphogenesis: Responding to Light
It was clearly necessary to obtain physical evidence
for the existence of phytochrome and, ultimately, to
isolate the pigment and characterize it in vitro. The
strategy that led to a satisfactory resolution of this
problem turned on the same unique photoreversible
character that generated skepticism in the ﬁrst place.
Since phytochrome was the only known photochromic
pigment present in plants, it should be possible to detect
absorbance changes related to photoconversion of the
pigment from one form to the other. Hendricks and
his colleagues thus predicted that the conversion of Pr
to Pfr in red light would be accompanied by a decrease
in absorbance in the red (the maximum absorbance of
Pr) and a corresponding increase in absorbance in the
far-red. Subsequent irradiation with far-red light should
cause an increase in absorbance in the red and a decrease
in the far-red. These experiments would require a special
kind of spectrophotometer, one capable of measuring
very small absorbance changes in dense, light-scattering
tissue samples. Fortunately, such an instrument was
under development in another laboratory at Beltsville
and
relatively
straightforward
modiﬁcations
were
required to adapt its use for phytochrome detection.
The predicted photoreversible absorbance changes
were ﬁrst demonstrated in dark-grown maize shoots in
1959 (Figure 22.2). This spectral analysis was the ﬁrst
physical evidence that phytochrome actually existed.
A short time later, the pigment was successfully iso-
lated and puriﬁed from dark-grown cereal seedlings.
In the years that followed, phytochrome was found
to be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. It is found in
algae, bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), and proba-
bly all higher plants where it plays a signiﬁcant role in
biochemistry, growth, and development.
22.2.1 PHOTOREVERSIBILITY IS THE
HALLMARK OF PHYTOCHROME
ACTION
The key to the discovery of phytochrome was the ﬁnding
that plant responses to weak red light could be nulliﬁed
if the red treatment were followed immediately with
far-red light (Table 22.1). Such clear photoreversibil-
ity had never before been described in biology. The
data in Table 22.1 are for groups of seeds that were
allowed to imbibe water in darkness for three hours
before being subjected to various brief light treatments.
The light treatments were either 1 minute of red light
(R; λ ca. 660 nm) or 3 minutes of far-red light (FR; λ>
700 nm) at low ﬂuence rates, or alternating R and FR in
succession.

Following irradiation, the seeds were returned to
darkness for 48 hours, and the number of germinated
seeds in each lot was then counted. Note that red
light promotes a high germination rate but that a R,FR
treatment (red light followed immediately by far-red
light) maintains germination at the dark level (22%).
When the R and FR treatments are alternated, the
germination rate depends solely on whether R or FR
was presented last. It is as though germination were
dependent on a switch that could be turned on by red
light and turned off by far-red light. Similar results were
observed with responses as diverse as stem elongation in
dark-grown pea seedlings and photoperiodic control of
ﬂowering in cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium).
Photoreversible behavior can be explained by a sim-
ple, two-state photoequilibrium model for phytochrome
(Figure 22.3). The red light-absorbing form of the pig-
ment is designated Pr and the far-red-absorbing form,
Pfr. Phytochrome is synthesized as the Pr form, which

basis of seed germination and other plant responses to

by the red-absorbing form of the pigment (Pr) converts
it to a form that absorbs far-red light (Pfr). Conversely,
absorption of far-red light by Pfr returns the pigment to
the Pr form. Pfr is considered the active form and initi-
ates a signal transduction chain that leads to germination.

accumulates in dark-grown tissue and is generally con-
sidered to be physiologically inactive. When Pr absorbs
red light, it is converted to the Pfr form, which is
the physiologically active form of the pigment for most
known responses. Exposure of Pfr to far-red light returns
the pigment to the Pr form. Both physiological and spec-
trophotometric experiments have also indicated that
some Pfr may revert to Pr by a temperature-dependent
process called dark reversion.
22.2.2 CONVERSION OF PR TO PFR IN
ETIOLATED SEEDLINGS LEADS
TO A LOSS OF BOTH PFR AND
TOTAL PHYTOCHROME
Most of the early work on phytochrome was conducted
with dark-grown, or etiolated, seedlings. Dark-grown
seedlings grow quickly, they accumulate relatively large
amounts of phytochrome, and the absence of chloro-
phyll makes it possible to measure phytochrome directly
in tissue with spectrophotometers adapted for use with
optically dense, light-scattering materials.2 With the
appropriate instrument, changes in the total amount of
phytochrome and the relative proportions of Pr and Pfr
could be monitored following controlled irradiations.
These in vivo spectrophotometric studies conﬁrmed
many of the original predictions about the dynamic
properties of phytochrome.
Typical phytochrome transformations in etiolated
seedling tissue are shown in Figure 22.4. The most dis-
tinctive feature is that Pfr is relatively unstable. Note
that when the tissue is returned to darkness after Pr is
converted to Pfr with a brief pulse of low ﬂuence red
light, the concentration of Pfr declines with a half-life of
1 to 1.5 hours. This loss of Pfr is accompanied by a cor-
responding decline in the total amount of phytochrome.
These kinetics can be explained by the fact that both
forms of the pigment are subject to irreversible chemical
degradation (Figure 22.5). In darkness, Pr accumulates
until its rate of synthesis is matched by the rate of Pr
degradation, which is relatively low. The loss of phy-
tochrome following a red irradiation can be explained by
two factors. First, the rate of Pfr degradation is approxi-
mately 100 times greater than the rate of Pr degradation.
Immunochemical studies have demonstrated the conju-
gation of Pfr with ubiquitin, indicating that Pfr is subject
to degradation by the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system.
Second, it has been demonstrated that Pfr suppresses
the transcription of the phytochrome gene by feedback
inhibition. As little as 5 seconds of red light causes a

absorption of light by pigments in solution. Conventional
spectrophotometers are by design limited to optically clear
solutions, free of light-scattering particles.

formation to the far-red-absorbing form (Pfr). Absorp-

tion.

22.2.3 LIGHT ESTABLISHES A STATE OF
DYNAMIC PHOTOEQUILIBRIUM
BETWEEN PR AND PFR
The absorption spectra for Pr and Pfr (Figure 22.1)
show that both forms have broad, overlapping absorp-
tion spectra. Note that Pfr absorbs some light at 660 nm
(although much less efﬁciently than Pr) and Pr absorbs
slightly in the far-red. Thus, even with ‘‘pure’’ red light
at 660 nm, it is not possible to convert 100 percent of
the pigment to Pfr. As soon as Pfr appears, a portion
of it will absorb red light and immediately phototrans-
formed back to the Pr form. In a similar manner, Pr also
absorbs a small amount of far-red light (735 nm), so that
even in pure far-red light some Pr will be converted to
Pfr. In other words, regardless of what light source is
used, a dynamic photoequilibrium () is established as
phytochrome cycles between Pr and Pfr. This photoe-
quilibrium is conveniently deﬁned as  = Pfr/PTOT, in
which PTOT is the total phytochrome or the sum of Pr
and Pfr. The photoequilibrium established by red light
(660 nm) in etiolated tissues, for example, is 0.8 while
the value for far-red light at 720 nm is 0.03. In other
words, pure red light will maintain about 80 percent Pfr
and 20 percent Pr while far-red light will establish about
3 percent Pfr. For this reason, the absorption spectrum
of Pfr shown in Figure 22.1 is actually the spectrum
of an equilibrium mixture of Pr and Pfr following a
saturating red light treatment.
Except in the laboratory, of course, plants do not
grow in dark boxes with occasional ﬂashes of red and
far-red light. Moreover, sunlight contains a mixture
of red and far-red wavelengths and, depending upon
time of day and environmental conditions, the relative
proportions of red and far-red wavelengths in sunlight
will change. The result is that sunlight will also produce
an equilibrium mixture of Pr and Pfr and, because the
quality of sunlight changes throughout the day, so will
the equilibrium mixture of Pr and Pf. The biological
response in most cases will depend on the proportion
of Pfr, or () in the system. The proportion of Pfr will,
in turn, depend on at least three factors: the relative
proportions of red and far-red wavelengths in the light
source, the forward and reverse rates of photoconversion
between Pr and Pfr, and the rate of thermal reversion of

CAN BE GROUPED ACCORDING
TO THEIR FLUENCE
REQUIREMENTS
Phytochrome-mediated
responses
are
conveniently
grouped into three categories on the basis of their
energy requirements. The classical red, far-red photo-
reversible responses discovered by Hendricks and
Borthwick and their colleagues are known as low
ﬂuence responses (LFRs). LFRs are stimulated by
light doses in the range of 1 μmole m−2 to 1000 μmole
m−2. This is equivalent to about a 0.1 second exposure
under a dense plant canopy at the lower end and about
one second of full daylight at the upper end. In addition,
LFRs are FR-reversible.
Phytochrome responses stimulated by light levels in
the range of 10−6 to 10−3 μmole−2 are called very low
ﬂuence responses (VLFRs). Typically, such low levels
of light (comparable to the light emitted from a ﬁreﬂy)
convert only about 0.01 percent of the phytochrome.
Several studies have indicated that dark-grown seedlings
are capable of responding to such very low levels of light.
Red light, for example, promotes an increase in sensitiv-
ity of cereal grain seedlings to a subsequent phototropic
stimulus. But the red light ﬂuence required to saturate
the response was found to be at least 100 times less
than that required to induce a measurable conversion of
Pr to Pfr! A low far-red ﬂuence also promotes pho-
totropic sensitivity just as red light does, indicating that
less than 1 percent of the pigment need be converted to
Pfr in order to saturate the response. Exposure to even
the traditional dim green safelights is sufﬁcient to elicit
or even saturate elongation responses in dark-grown
Avena seedlings. For example, as little as 0.01 percent
Pfr is required to elicit inhibition of mesocotyl elonga-
tion. This extreme sensitivity to light obviously makes
the study of VLFRs technically difﬁcult. VLFRs, for
example, are not photoreversible. The principal evi-
dence that a VLF response is mediated by phytochrome
is the similarity of its action spectrum to the absorp-
tion spectrum of Pr. The phenomenon, however, raises
perplexing yet intriguing questions about experimental
photocontrol of plant development.
In the natural environment, plants are exposed
to long periods of sunlight at relatively high ﬂuence
rates. Under such conditions, characterized by relatively
high energy over long periods of time, the photomor-
phogenic program achieves maximum expression, and
responses such as leaf expansion and stem elongation
are far more striking. Such light-dependent responses
are known as high irradiance reactions (HIRs). High
irradiance reactions generally share the following char-
acteristics: (1) full expression of the response requires
prolonged exposure to high irradiance, primarily with
a high proportion of far-red light; (2) the magnitude
of the response is a function of the ﬂuence rate and
duration; (3) like VLFRs, HIRs are not red, far-red
photoreversible.
The HIR has been implicated in a wide range of
responses that also qualify as LFRs, including stem
growth, leaf expansion, and seed germination. How-
ever, HIRs may exhibit strikingly different action spec-
tra depending on the species or growth conditions.
Etiolated seedlings, for example, respond to blue, red,

379
and far-red light. As de-etiolation progresses, there is
a shift from a far-red-sensitive HIR to a red-sensitive
HIR. Not surprisingly then, light-grown, green tissues
are more responsive to red light rather than far-red.
Some systems, such as anthocyanin synthesis in Sorghum
seedlings, respond only to blue-UV-A light.
Genetic studies involving phytochrome mutants in
Arabidopsis have identiﬁed that phyA is responsible for
the VLFR and FR-sensitive HIR responses and phyB is
responsible for the LFR and red-sensitive HIR.
22.3 CRYPTOCHROME:
RESPONDING TO BLUE
AND UV-A LIGHT
Charles Darwin was one of the ﬁrst to note that plants
respond to blue light when he observed that heliotropic
movements were diminished in light passed through a
solution of potassium dichromate, an effective absorber
of blue light. It is now known that those portions
of the spectrum that constitute blue and UV-A light
regulate many aspects of growth and development in
plants, fungi, and animals. Plant responses to blue and
UV-A light include aspects of de-etiolation such as
the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and stimulation
of cotyledon expansion, the opening and closure of
stomata, gene expression, ﬂowering time, the ‘‘setting’’
of endogenous clocks (Chapter 24), and the growth of
shoots in response to light gradients, or phototropism
(Chapter 23).
Most action spectra for blue-light responses had
peaks in the blue and UV-A regions of the spec-
trum and closely resembled the absorption spectra of
ﬂavin molecules, such as riboﬂavin. This prompted
A. W. Galston to postulate as early as 1950 that a
ﬂavoprotein was involved in blue light responses. Oth-
ers, however, mounted strong arguments in favor of a
carotenoid-based photoreceptor, and for many years the
ﬂavin–carotenoid controversy was hotly debated. The
controversy was difﬁcult to resolve because plants con-
tain a bewildering array of ﬂavoproteins and caroteno-
proteins, a factor that seriously complicated any efforts
to identify the one that might be involved speciﬁcally in
blue-light responses. Because of this elusive, or ‘‘cryp-
tic,’’ nature of the pigment and the pervasive blue-light
responses in cryptogams, or nonﬂowering plants, the
pigment was referred to as cryptochrome.
The ﬁrst protein with the characteristics of a
blue-light photoreceptor was isolated from Arabidopsis
in
1993.
Elongation
of
hypocotyls
in
wildtype
Arabidopsis can be inhibited by red, far-red, or blue light.
Several mutants (the hy mutants) were characterized by
elongated hypocotyls because they had lost the capacity
to respond to one or more regions of the spectrum. One
of these, hy4 (later named cry1), had lost the capacity to
respond speciﬁcally to blue light. The protein encoded
by the wildtype allele was subsequently isolated and, on
the basis of its photobiological and genetic properties,
identiﬁed as cryptochrome 1 (cry1). The argument
between the ﬂavin camp and the carotenoid camp was
ﬁnally resolved after more than 40 years when it was
shown that cry1 binds two ﬂavin-related chromophores,
one of which is ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
(Section 22.5.3).
A second cryptochrome, cry2, has also been identi-
ﬁed. Cry2 mediates blue-light suppression of hypocotyl
elongation, cotyledon expansion, and anthocyanin pro-
duction in Arabidopsis. In addition, cry2 has a role in
determining ﬂowering time and is synonymous with
FHA, the product of a ﬂowering-time gene. The roles of
cry2 and FHA in ﬂowering are examined in Chapter 25.
22.4 PHYTOCHROME AND
CRYPTOCHROME
MEDIATE NUMEROUS
DEVELOPMENTAL
RESPONSES
Phytochrome and cryptochrome act both jointly and
independently to regulate a wide range of developmental
responses. Some of the better understood responses are
described in the following sections.
22.4.1 SEED GERMINATION
The germination of many seeds is inﬂuenced by light as
evident in the ﬂush of germination in areas of cultivation
or natural disturbance. Some seeds, known as positively
photoblastic seeds, are stimulated to germinate by
light. The germination of others, known as negatively
photoblastic seeds, is inhibited by light. Some seeds,
mostly agriculturally important species that have been
selected for high germinability, are not affected by light.
Many seeds, such as lettuce, may require only brief
exposure to light, measured in seconds or minutes, while
others may require as much as several hours or even days
of constant or intermittent light (e.g., Lythrum salicaria,
Epilobium cephalostigma). In all cases, the responsible
pigment appears to be phytochrome.
Most seeds that require light for germination tend to
be very small seeds that have comparably small embryos
and limited endosperm. They need to be close to the
surface when they germinate so that the young seedling
can reach the sunlight before the reserves are exhausted.
Most soils attenuate light very quickly. A 1 mm thickness
of ﬁne soil, for example, passes less than 1 percent of
the incident light and then only at wavelengths longer
than 700 nm. As a result, most light-requiring seeds

380
Chapter 22 / Photomorphogenesis: Responding to Light
need not be buried very deeply for germination to
be held in check. However, some seeds (e.g., Sinapis
arvensis) require very little Pfr ( = 0.05) to stimulate
germination and may exhibit germination when covered
with up to 8 mm of soil. Thus, the role of phytochrome
in both seed germination and seedling development
appears to be one of conveying information to the seed
or seedling about its position relative to the soil surface.
Interestingly, most common agricultural weeds
such as Amaranthus (pigweed), Ambrosia (ragweed),
and Chenopodium (lambs quarters) produce prodigious
numbers of very small light-sensitive seeds. These seeds
accumulate in the ‘‘seed bank’’ just below the surface
of the soil where they will not germinate. Every time
the soil is disturbed, however, a new batch of seeds
germinates because they are exposed to light. This
is a major factor in the competitive success of these
species.
Suppression of germination in negatively photo-
blastic seeds, such as wild oats (Avena fatua), generally
requires long-term exposures at high ﬂuence rates.
Far-red and blue light are most effective, although in
some cases (e.g., Phacelia tanacetifolia) red light is also
effective. Photoinhibition of seed germination appears
to be an example of a high irradiance reaction. In
Arabidopsis, seed germination is controlled solely by
phytochromes.
22.4.2 DE-ETIOLATION
Plants grown in darkness exhibit a distinct morphology.
The details may vary from one species to another, but in
a dicot such as bean (Figure 22.6) the hypocotyl is elon-
gated and spindly, with a pronounced plumular hook,
or recurve, just below the ﬁrst leaves. The leaves them-
selves undergo limited development and remain small
and clasping, as they were in the embryo. Chlorophyll is
absent and the seedlings appear white or yellow in color.
In monocot cereal grains the ﬁrst internode, or meso-
cotyl, elongates excessively in the dark and the coleop-
tile, which is a modiﬁed leaf, grows slowly. The primary
leaves remain within the coleoptile and stay tightly rolled
around their midvein. This general condition exhib-
ited by dark-grown seedlings is called etiolation. Other
characteristics of the etiolated condition include arrested
chloroplast development and low activities of many
enzymes. When exposed to light, etiolated seedlings
undergo de-etiolation, a process under control of both
phytochromes and cryptochromes. Hypocotyl growth
is arrested, the plumular hook gradually straightens,
and elongation of the epicotyl accelerates. Light also
stimulates the leaves to unfold, enlarge, and complete
their development. Chloroplast development also pro-
ceeds and the leaves green up as chlorophyll accumulates
and the leaves become photosynthetically competent. In
FIGURE 22.6 The de-etiolation response in 7-day-old
seedlings of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The seedling on
the right was grown in darkness. Note the elongated
hypocotyl, recurved plumular hook, an absence of pri-
mary leaf expansion, and absence of chlorophyll. The
seedling at left was grown under normal white light con-
ditions. Note the shortened hypocotyl, unfolding of the
plumular hook, expanded primary leaves, and accumula-
tion of chlorophyll. The center seedling was exposed to
5 minutes of weak red light daily for three days, which is
sufﬁcient to initiate the de-etiolation response.
particular, light stimulates the synthesis of the chloro-
phyll a/b light harvesting pigment-protein.
The developmental signiﬁcance of etiolation and
de-etiolation is not difﬁcult to construct. Remember that
a plant is fundamentally a photosynthetic organism. A
seed carries a limited amount of nutritive tissue that must
support development of the seedling until such time as
its leaves are established in the light and photosynthesis
can take over the supply of energy and carbon. In
the darkness experienced beneath the soil, the limited
reserves of a seed are committed to extension growth
of the hypocotyl in order to maximize the possibility
that the plumule, composed of the young leaves, will
reach the light and be able to carry out photosynthesis
before the reserves are exhausted. Once established
in the light, the remaining reserves may be invested
in development of photosynthetic tissue, such as leaf
expansion and chloroplast development.

381
22.4.3 SHADE AVOIDANCE
Plants need light for photosynthesis and those that ﬁnd
themselves growing in the shade of neighbors or under
a canopy can adjust to the reduced availability of light
in two ways. They can (1) adjust their light-harvesting
capability by increasing the speciﬁc leaf area and the
amount of chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex or
they can (2) adjust their morphology in order to position
their leaves out of the shade. Plants typically respond to
shadelight with increased elongation of stem-like organs
(including hypocotyls and leaf petioles, a more upward
orientation of leaves (hyponasty), reduced branching,
and reduced tillering (in grasses). In the end, shad-
ing leads to early ﬂowering and seed set in an effort
to ‘‘escape’’ shading by shortening generation time.
These and other effects are collectively called the shade
avoidance syndrome.
Radiation within and below a canopy is markedly
deﬁcient of red and blue light because these wavelengths
are largely absorbed by the chlorophyll in the overly-
ing leaves. By contrast, chlorophyll is transparent to
far-red light; any attenuation of far-red is limited almost
solely to reﬂection. Plants therefore use phytochrome
(speciﬁcally phyB, phyD, and phyE) and cryptochrome
to detect these characteristic differences in composition
between shadelight and unﬁltered daylight.
The effect of canopy shading can be described in
terms of the ratio of red to far-red ﬂuence rates (R/FR,
or ζ; Gr. zeta). The value of ζ in unﬁltered daylight
is typically in the range of 1.05 to 1.25. The value in
shadelight beneath a canopy will, of course, vary with the
nature of the vegetation and the density of the canopy.
Some representative values are listed in Table 22.2.
These values fall well within the range where a small
change in ζ would cause a relatively large change in the
proportion of Pfr (Figure 22.7).
Shadelight can be mimicked in the laboratory or
growth chamber by supplementing white ﬂuorescent
light (ζ = 2.28) with various amounts of far-red light
through the entire photoperiod. This can be done in
such a way that the ﬂuence rate of photosyntheti-
cally active radiation (PAR) remains constant from one

treatment regime to the next. This removes the impact
of photosynthetic output and any differences in growth;
morphogenesis can thus be attributed to the phy-
tochrome photoequilibrium value (), which can be
estimated from the measured R/FR ratio for each reg-
imen. When young plants of Chenopodium album were
grown this way, the logarithmic stem extension rate
was found to be linearly related to  (Figure 22.8).
The response to light quality may be quite rapid. In
Chenopodium, for example, an increase in the stem exten-
sion rate can be observed within seven minutes of adding
FR light to the background ﬂuorescent source. Even
when not directly shaded, plants are able to anticipate
shading. The reduction in red to far-red ratio reﬂected
from the leaves of nonshading neighbors and propa-
gated horizontally is often sufﬁcient to initiate shade
avoidance responses.
22.4.4 DETECTING END-OF-DAY
SIGNALS
There are also substantial changes in the spectral energy
distribution of natural daylight on a daily basis. At both
dawn and dusk, when the sun sits low on the horizon,
there are signiﬁcant relative decreases in the value of ζ

compared with the main part of the day. In one study,
for example, ζ values at dusk were reduced by 14 to 44
percent of those at midday. A detailed examination of
the response of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) to end-of-day
red or far-red light reveals that a reduction in the pro-
portion of phytochrome maintained as Pfr at the end
of the photoperiod is associated with drastic changes in
the developmental pattern. Lowering of  from a high
value (ca. 0.65 to 0.75) to a very low value (ca. 0.03)
accentuates stem and petiole extension, reduces leaf
expansion and branching, and lowers the chlorophyll
content. These experiments do not, of course, prove
a causal link between phytochrome photoequilibrium
and morphogenic responses to changes in the radia-
tion environment. They do, however, demonstrate that
plants have the capacity to respond to changes in spectral
energy distribution similar to those that occur naturally
in the environment. It also seems highly likely that phy-
tochrome is the photoreceptor that detects end-of-day
signals, which could reﬂect an important role in time
measurement (Chapters 24, 25)
22.4.5 CONTROL OF ANTHOCYANIN
BIOSYNTHESIS
Anthocyanins are the water-soluble red and blue pig-
ments responsible for the color of many vegetables,
fruits, and ﬂowers. The biosynthesis of anthocyanins
is a classical high irradiance reaction, ﬁrst revealed in
studies of red cabbage seedlings. Like other responses
of etiolated seedlings, the initiation of anthocyanin accu-
mulation is a classic phytochrome-dependent LFR. The
red, far-red photoreversibility, however, is limited to
brief irradiations. When longer-term irradiations are
applied, the action peak for continued anthocyanin
accumulation is shifted to the far-red, with reduced
effectiveness in the red. This effect of prolonged far-red
irradiation has been interpreted as a requirement for
maintaining a low level of Pfr over time—long enough
to avoid rapid depletion of the Pfr pool by degradation.
22.4.6 RAPID PHYTOCHROME
RESPONSES
The response time for most phytochrome-mediated
developmental effects is measured in hours or even days,
but there are some responses with response times mea-
sured in minutes or seconds. Most, but not all, of these
rapid responses appear to be related to membrane-based
activities such as bioelectric potential or ion ﬂux. One
of the earliest indications that phytochrome inﬂuenced
the electrical properties of tissues was a curious effect on
the surface charge of root tips reported by T. Tanada
in 1968. Tanada observed that dark-grown barley root
tips would ﬂoat freely in a glass beaker with a specially
prepared negatively charged surface. Within 30 seconds
following a brief red irradiation the root tips would
adhere to the surface. A subsequent far-red treatment
would release the root tips from the glass. It was later
found that adhesion and release was correlated with
phytochrome-induced changes in the surface potential
of the root tips. A brief red treatment generated a
positive surface potential, attracting the tips to the neg-
atively charged surface. A far-red treatment generated
a negative surface potential, thereby causing the tips
to detach. Similar effects of red and far-red light on

22.5 Chemistry and Mode of Action of Phytochrome and Cryptochrome

surface potential of Avena coleoptiles have also been
demonstrated.
Phytochrome-modulated transmembrane poten-
tials
have

been
reported
for

of
tissues from several laboratories. The results are not
completely consistent, but in most cases red light
induces a depolarization of the membrane within
5 to 10 seconds following a red light treatment. A
subsequent far-red treatment causes a slow return to
normal polarity or small hyperpolarization. At this
point, it is not known whether such effects are due to
a direct action of phytochrome on the membrane or
whether a second messenger system is involved.
22.4.7 PhyA MAY FUNCTION TO
DETECT THE PRESENCE
OF LIGHT
What purpose does it serve the plant to have multiple
forms of phytochrome? More speciﬁcally, of what ben-
eﬁt is it for etiolated plants to accumulate an apparent
excess of labile phyA, which is so quickly degraded in
the Pfr form? One possibility is that phyA functions
only to detect the presence of light, rather than to dis-
tinguish subtle differences in light quality. Note that
phyA accumulates in two particular situations: (1) in
seeds that require red light to germinate and conse-
quently do not germinate when buried deep in the soil,
and (2) in germinated seedlings in which phytochrome
is used to detect light as the seedling approaches the
soil surface. The large amount of phyA that accumu-
lates under both of these conditions appears to function
as a sensitive antenna or photon-counter that detects
only the presence of light. Once the seed or seedling
is exposed to adequate light, the excessive quantity of
labile phytochrome disappears. This allows the more
stable phyB to monitor the R-FR ratio over time
and direct development accordingly. It may be difﬁ-
cult to obtain direct evidence in support of such a
scenario, but it is an important ﬁrst step in taking phy-
tochrome studies out of the laboratory and into the real
world.
22.5 CHEMISTRY AND MODE OF
ACTION OF PHYTOCHROME
AND CRYPTOCHROME
22.5.1 PHYTOCHROME IS A
PHYCOBILIPROTEIN
The phytochrome chromophore (Figure 22.9) is called
phytochromobilin because it is a linear tetrapyrrole that
is similar in structure to mammalian bile pigments. Phy-
tochromobilin is virtually identical to phycocyanobilin,
the chromophore of the pigment phyconcyanin found
in cyanobacteria and the red algae. Phytochromobilin is
also related to the chromophores of chlorophyll, the res-
piratory cytochrome pigments, and hemoglobin, except
that these pigments are all cyclic tetrapyrroles.
The difference between the Pr chromophore and
the Pfr chromophore is a rotation (a cis–trans isomeriza-
tion) of the double bond between rings C and D. The
absorption of red light provides the energy required
to overcome the high activation energy for rotation
around the double bond, a transition that is not nor-
mally possible at ambient temperature. The pigment can
be returned to the more stable Pr conﬁguration by either
FR light or thermal-dependent reversion in darkness.
There is also evidence that the change in the chro-
mophore induces substantial conformational changes in
the protein, which would account for its activation when
converted to Pfr.

FIGURE 22.10 The structure of phytochrome. This block
diagram of two phytochrome molecules (a dimer) shows
the principal domains and subdomains. The N-terminal
photosensory domain binds the phytochromobilin chro-
mophore (PCB) and is linked by a hinge region to the
C-terminal regulatory domain. The regulatory subunit
contains the dimerization domain (DD) and the histidine
kinase-related domain (HKRD). One possible phospho-
rylation site is shown (dashed line); a serine residue (S)
located in the hinge region that is phosphorylated specif-
ically in the Pfr form. Other possible phosphorylation
sites are serine residues located in the P1 subdomain at
the N-terminus of the photosensory domain. The P4
domain is believed to interact with the D-ring of the
chromophore to stabilize the energetically unfavorable
Pfr form. The regulatory domain presumably initiates
transduction of the light signal.
Phytochrome apoprotein is a relatively small pro-
tein with a molecular mass of 125 kDa. It consists of
two structural domains of approximately equal size; a
globular N-terminal domain and an open, or extended,
C-terminal domain (Figure 22.10). The A ring of
the chromophore is covalently linked to the protein
through a cysteine residue in the N-terminal domain.
The N-terminal end of the molecule is thus called
the photosensory domain. The C-terminal domain,
or regulatory domain, contains a subdomain that has
the characteristics of a histidine kinase (the histidine
kinase-related domain, HKRD). In this respect, phy-
tochrome resembles a two-component system like those
previously encountered in osmoregulation and hor-
mone sensing. In vivo, phytochromes exist as a dimer,
with one chromophore on each monomer.
22.5.2 PHYTOCHROME SIGNAL
TRANSDUCTION
Phytochrome
regulation
of
proteins
or
protein
function was ﬁrst reported in 1960 by A. Marcus,
who demonstrated red, far-red reversible control of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in
bean seedlings. Since then, the list of enzymes and
other proteins whose activities are known to be light
regulated, in most cases by phytochrome, has grown to
more than 60. These observations led to the obvious
conclusion that phytochrome acted by controlling gene
expression. Only recently, however, have the results of
genetic studies suggested mechanisms for the control of
gene expression by phytochrome. Although the detailed
mechanism of phytochrome signaling is still not clear,
at least three important factors have been identiﬁed:
1. the phytochromes are serine/threonine kinases that
both autophosporylate and phosphorylate a number
of other proteins,
2. phytochromes are imported into the nucleus in the
active Pfr form, and
3. phytochrome responses are associated with signiﬁ-
cant changes in gene expression.
Early studies of the amino acid sequence of the phy-
tochrome molecule revealed that its carboxy-terminal
domain had amino acid sequences homologous to bac-
terial histidine kinase enzymes. Because of this similarity
it was suggested in the 1980s that phytochromes might
be protein kinases. There was, however, no direct
evidence of such activity. This all changed with the
discovery of phytochrome in the cyanobacteria. The
cyanobacterial phytochrome (cph1) has an N-terminal
domain similar to the chromophore-binding domain
of plant phytochrome, has spectral properties similar
to plant phytochromes, and, most importantly, exhibits
light-mediated histidine kinase activity. Shortly after-
ward, it was shown that puriﬁed oat phytochrome A
exhibited light-regulated autophosphorylation ability.
However, plant phytochrome autophosphorylates serine
residues, rather than histidine residues as its cyanobac-
terial counterpart does. Phytochrome is preferentially
phosphorylated in the Pfr form (Figure 22.10) which
may then initiate signaling by transferring the phos-
phate group to an appropriate substrate molecule. It
is well known that the addition of a phosphate group
or its removal has profound effects on the structure
and stability of proteins, thereby inﬂuencing functional
properties and intracellular location. Phytochrome may
regulate various aspects of development simply by phos-
phorylating different substrates or initiating different
kinase cascades.
At least two putative phosphorylation substrates
have
been
identiﬁed.
PKS1
(PHYTOCHROME
KINASE SUBSTRATE 1) is a cytoplasmic protein
that is phosphorylated by phyA in vitro. PKS1 binds to
both phyA and phyB and its phosphorylation in vivo is
stimulated by red light, suggesting that phytochrome is
the responsible kinase. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase
2 (NDPK2) is an enzyme that also appears to interact
with phytochrome. NDPK catalyzes the synthesis
of
various
nucleoside
triphosphates
(e.g.,
CTP,
GTP, UTP) from ATP and the corresponding nucleo-
side diphosphate. Its activity is signiﬁcantly increased
in the presence of the Pfr form of phyA in vitro,

22.5 Chemistry and Mode of Action of Phytochrome and Cryptochrome
385
phosphorylation of NDPK2 is stimulated by red light
in vivo, and ndpk2 mutants exhibit altered responses
to both red and far-red light. Puriﬁed phyA can
also phosphorylate both cryptochromes in vivo and
phosphorylation of cry1 is also stimulated by red
light in vivo. This is particularly interesting in view
of the known physiological interactions between red
and blue light responses and raises the possibility
that phyA might modulate blue light responses via
phosphorylation of cryptochrome (see Section 22.5.3).
Unfortunately, a direct link between kinase activity and
phytochrome signaling has yet to be established.
In order to control gene expression, the phy-
tochrome signal chain must extend into the nucleus
where the genes are located. In fact the signal chain in
this case is rather short, because phytochrome itself can
move into the nucleus. For a long time it was assumed
that phytochrome was strictly a cytosolic protein. This
view changed when phytochrome was tagged by fusing it
with a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) and the fusion
product was then expressed in transgenic plants. The
GFP-fused phytochrome remains biologically active and
the location of the tagged phytochrome can be visually
conﬁrmed by microscopic examination. These studies
made it clear that phytochrome in its inactive Pr form
does indeed accumulate in the cytoplasm, but conver-
sion to the Pfr form unmasks a nuclear localization
sequence that allows phytochrome to be recognized
by the nuclear import machinery (Figure 22.11). The
mechanism of nuclear import is not clear, but it has
been shown that the recognition sequence is located
in the carboxy-terminal domain of the phytochrome
molecule and that a protein identiﬁed as FHY1 (from
the mutant fhy1, or far-red elongated hypocotyl 1) is specif-
ically required. The rate of nuclear import varies. PhyA,

for example, is transported into the nucleus within 15
minutes of the onset of light, but phyB is not detected
for at least two hours.
As
multiple
phytochromes
arrive
inside
the
nucleus, they appear to form aggregates referred
to as nuclear bodies or speckles. Phytochrome also
physically interacts, at least in vitro, with a family of
transcription factors called phytochrome-interacting
factors (PIF), an interaction that establishes a direct
link
between
phytochrome
and
gene
expression.
Genetic analysis has established that PIF and PIF-like
(PIL) proteins are predominantly negative regulators
of phytochrome-dependent pathways. For example,
members of the PIF family inhibit seed germination,
control protochlorophyllide accumulation and repress
phytochrome-regulated gibberellin biosynthetic genes.
Most PIF proteins are stable in the dark, but are
rapidly degraded in the light. The degradation of at
least two PIFs (PIF1 and PIF3) is mediated by the
26S-proteosome system in a phytochrome-dependent
manner. Once the light is switched off, PIF protein

to its active Pfr form, which then is imported into the
nucleus. The Pfr recruits the promoter-bound PIF for
degradation by the 26S-proteosome system, thus reliev-
ing the repression of the gene. Far-red light will convert
the Pfr back to Pr, which immediately dissociates from
PIF, thus allowing PIF to reassociate with the promoter
and reestablish gene repression.

(Figure 22.12). In the dark, phytochrome accumulates
and remains in the cytoplasm as Pr, which is inactive.
Meanwhile, nuclear PIF proteins inhibit the expression
of phytochrome-dependent genes. Upon irradiation,
Pr is converted to Pfr, which is then imported into
the nucleus where it targets transcriptional regulators
for degradation, thereby activating transcription of
phytochrome-responsive genes. This model, however,
does not explain all phytochrome-dependent responses.
The rapid phytochrome responses described above
(22.4.5) would seem to require a cytoplasmic, perhaps
even membrane-located, phytochrome system. There is
some evidence that these responses may involve cyclic
GMP and/or calcium second messenger systems.
22.5.3 CRYPTOCHROME STRUCTURE
IS SIMILAR TO DNA REPAIR
ENZYMES
Most plant cryptochromes are 70 to 80 kDa proteins
with two recognizable domains (Figure 22.13). The
N-terminal
domain
shares
amino
acid
sequence
homologies with microbial DNA photolyase, a unique
class of ﬂavoenzymes that use blue light to catalyze
repair of UV-induced damage to microbial DNA.
The N-terminal domain of cryptochrome is therefore
called the photolyase-related (PHR) domain. The PHR
domain of cryptochrome binds two chromophores.
The ﬁrst is ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the same
redox cofactor encountered in respiratory metabolism.
The
second
is
5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate,
or
MTHF. MTHF is a member of another family of redox
cofactors called pterins (Figure 22.14). The second,
or C-terminal, domain of cryptochrome has no known
homologies with other proteins and its function is not
clear.
The principal differences between photolyase and
the cryptochromes are that the cryptochromes have the
distinguishing carboxy-terminal extension not found in

the photolyases and cryptochromes exhibit no pho-
tolyase activity. The similarity does, however, raise the
possibility of an evolutionary relationship between the
photolyases and the cryptochromes and it has been sug-
gested that microbial photolyases are the evolutionary
precursors for plant cryptochromes.
22.5.4 CRYPTOCHROME SIGNAL
TRANSDUCTION
Unlike phytochrome, the molecular consequences of
photoexcitation of cryptochrome remain unknown.
Other ﬂavoproteins are known to participate almost
exclusively in oxidation–reduction reactions and pho-
tolyases repair damaged DNA by transferring electrons
to pyrimidine dimers. It seems likely that the primary
photochemical
event
when
cryptochromes
absorb
blue light would involve a similar electron-transfer
mechanism.

22.7 De-Etiolation in Arabidopsis: A Case Study in Photoreceptor Interactions
387
The signal transduction chain for the crypto-
chromes appears to be relatively short since the
cryptochromes are located mainly in the nucleus. Cry1
is located in the cytoplasm in the light but moves into
the nucleus in the dark while cry2 seems to reside
permanently in the nucleus. In the nucleus, cryp-
tochrome interacts directly with the COP1 (CONSTI-
TUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1), an E3
ubiquitin ligase. COP1 is a major repressor of photo-
morphogenic responses by constantly degrading a
number of transcription factors. The cop1 mutant there-
fore displays all of the characteristics of a light-grown
seedling (a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype)
in the dark. When irradiated with blue light, cryp-
tochrome undergoes a conformational change which
leads to the deactivation of COP1 and accumulation of
transcription factors necessary for proper development
in the light.
A
number
of
experiments
have
shown
that
cryptochromes are subject to light-dependent phospho-
rylation. In one study, for example, it was shown that
the C-terminal domain of cry1 was phosphorylated by
phyA in vitro. Phosphorylation of cry1 by phyA occurred
with both red and blue light. In other experiments, both
cry1 and cry2 exhibited blue light-dependent phos-
phorylation in vivo. The in vivo blue light-dependent
phosphorylation of cry2 was also detected in a range of
phytochrome mutants—that is, in the absence of
functional phytochrome. Thus, while phytochrome
can phosphorylate cryptochrome, blue light-dependent
phosphorylation of cryptochrome is independent of
phytochrome. The implication is that cryptochrome
in the dark is not phosphorylated and, consequently,
inactive. The absorption of blue light by cryptochrome
enables its phosphorylation by some unknown kinase.
The phosphorylated form of cryptochrome is active
and initiates signal transduction.
22.6 SOME PLANT RESPONSES
ARE REGULATED BY UV-B
LIGHT
A number of plant responses are attributed to radiation
in the UV-B region of the spectrum. A positive effect of
ultraviolet light on anthocyanin accumulation has been
known since the mid-1930s. Later it was recognized that
sunlight ﬁltered through window glass, which absorbs
ultraviolet rays, was less effective than unﬁltered sun-
light. This effect was ﬁnally characterized when it was
demonstrated that ﬂavonoid biosynthesis in parsley (Pet-
roselinum crispum) cell suspension cultures and seedlings
was induced by UV-B radiation (280–320 nm). Maxi-
mum effectiveness was at 290 to 300 nm, with little or no
activity beyond 320 nm. By 1986, 11 species of higher
plants were listed for which UV-B induced anthocyanin
and ﬂavonoid biosynthesis in coleoptiles, hypocotyls,
seedling roots, and cell culture.
In Sorghum bicolor the action spectrum for ﬂavonoid
biosynthesis shows three peaks: 290 nm, 385 nm, and
650 nm. Action at 385 nm and 650 nm could be reversed
by a subsequent exposure to far-red, but the peak at
290 nm could not. The 385 nm and 650 nm peaks have
been attributed to phytochrome, leaving the 290 nm
peak due to a UV-B receptor. In parsley it appears that
ﬂavonoid biosynthesis results from the coaction of three
pigments: phytochrome, a separate blue receptor (prob-
ably cryptochrome), and a UV-B receptor. The UV-B
system is a necessary prerequisite to ﬂavonoid biosyn-
thesis since neither the blue receptor nor phytochrome
is effective unless preceded by a UV-B light treatment.
The UV-B receptor has yet to be isolated and
its identity remains unknown. Phytochrome has been
suggested—the protein moiety does absorb UV-B
light—but results such as those described above would
argue against it. In members of the Leguminoseae
family, ultraviolet-induced ﬂavonoid biosynthesis can
be reversed with blue light in a manner reminiscent of
photoreactivation of UV damage in microorganisms.
This could implicate DNA itself as a UV photoreceptor,
but the action peak is shifted to wavelengths somewhat
shorter than those normally characteristic of UV-B
action.
22.7 DE-ETIOLATION IN
ARABIDOPSIS: A CASE STUDY
IN PHOTORECEPTOR
INTERACTIONS
Arabidopsis is a typical dicot seedling in that growth in
white light is accompanied by (1) arrested hypocotyl
elongation, (2) a straightening of the hypocotyl or
plumular hook, (3) unfolding of the cotyledons, and
(4)
expansion
of
the
cotyledons.
Studies
with
phytochrome-
and
cryptochrome-deﬁcient
mutants
have
conﬁrmed
that
de-etiolation
responses
in
Arabidopsis
seedlings
involve
complex
interactions
between three different photoreceptors: phyA, phyB,
and cry1. An experiment demonstrating some of
these interactions is illustrated in Figure 22.15. In the
experiment illustrated here, elongation of the hypocotyl
in wildtype seedlings was suppressed by approximately
68 percent in white light. The phyA-deﬁcient single
mutant (phyA) had little effect on hypocotyl elongation,
while in the absence of phyB, hypocotyl elongation was
suppressed by only 20 percent. These results indicate
that phyB is the principal photoreceptor for control of
hypocotyl elongation. phyA still has a role, however, a
fact which is uncovered in the double mutant, phyAphyB.
In the absence of both phyA and phyB, not only is
hypocotyl elongation not suppressed by white light,

the hypocotyls are even longer than in dark-grown
controls. In other words, the phyA mutation appears to
have enhanced the effect of the phyB mutation.
Both straightening of the hypocotyl hook and
unfolding of the cotyledons in white light were
relatively unaffected by any one of the three single
mutants, phyA, phyB, and cry1. In the phyAphyBcry1
triple mutant, however, the hook failed to straighten
out and the cotyledons did not unfold. These results
indicate
that
hook
straightening
and
cotyledon
unfolding are controlled in a completely redundant
manner by all three photoreceptors. Only when all
three photoreceptors are missing are these two aspects
of de-etiolation signiﬁcantly compromised.
Although not shown in Figure 22.15, cotyledon
expansion in Arabidopsis appears to be controlled prin-
cipally by phytochrome B and cryptochrome. In one
experiment, cotyledon area in the phyB and cry1 mutants
was reduced by 50 percent and 64 percent, respectively.
However, in the phyBcry1 double mutant, cotyledon area
was not signiﬁcantly greater than in the dark-grown con-
trols. This additive effect of the phyB and cry1 mutants
suggests that each photoreceptor independently controls
a distinct aspect of cotyledon expansion.
The results described here represent only a brief
sampling of the many interactions that occur between
the several photoreceptors, but one thing is clear.
Redundancy, or the possibility of evoking similar
effects through different photoreceptors, is common
to
light-induced
phenomena.
As
well,
numerous
examples
of
synergism
and
antagonism
between
photoreceptors have been demonstrated. Whether
such interrelationships are the results of parallel,
independent signal pathways or of extensive crosstalk
between pathways remains to be seen. Nevertheless,
plants have clearly evolved a versatile system of multiple
photoreceptors that allows them to respond efﬁciently
and ﬂexibly to dynamic changes in ﬂuence rate and
composition of light in their environment.
SUMMARY
The light in a plant’s environment contains a signiﬁ-
cant amount of information and the use of
that information by plants, called photomorphogenesis,
is a central theme in plant development. In order
to acquire the information provided by light, plants
have developed a sophisticated array of photorecep-
tors and signal transduction pathways. There are three
major classes of photoreceptors: the phytochromes that
respond principally to red and far-red light, the cryp-
tochromes that respond to blue light, and phototropin,
which also responds to blue light.
Phytochrome is a family of photoreceptors; ﬁve are
known in Arabidopsis (phyA–phyE). They are chromo-
proteins with a chromophore that consists of an linear
tetrapyrrole similar to phycocyanin. Phytochrome in
vivo is a dimer of a 125 kDa polypeptide chain. The
hallmark of phytochrome action is photoreversibility:
irradiation with red light converts the red-absorbing
form of the pigment (Pr) to the far-red-absorbing
form (Pfr). The physical presence of phytochrome was
established by demonstrating the predicted photore-
versible absorbency changes in vivo. PhyA accumulates
in dark-grown seedlings in the Pr form, which is sta-
ble. PhyAfr is unstable and is destroyed with a half-life
of 1 to 1.5 hours. PhyB is expressed at low levels in
both light and dark. PhyBfr is light stable. A mixture
of red and far-red light (or white light) will establish
a photoequilibrium mixture of Pr and Pfr. Pfr is the
physiologically active form.
Phytochrome-mediated effects are conveniently
grouped into three categories on the basis of their
energy requirements: very low ﬂuence responses
(VLFR), low ﬂuence responses (LFR), and high irradi-
ance reactions (HIR). LFRs include the classically
photoreversible phytochrome responses such as seed
germination and de-etiolation. LFRs convey
information to the seed about its position relative
to the soil surface and maximize the potential for a
seedling to become established in light and initiate
photosynthesis before the nutrient reserves of the

seedling are exhausted. VLFRs are not photoreversible
and are difﬁcult to study because they saturate at light
levels below those that cause a measurable conversion
of Pr to Pfr. HIRs require prolonged exposure to
high irradiance, are time dependent, and are not
photoreversible.
Under natural conditions, the phytochrome pho-
toequilibrium value (Pfr/P) is related to the red to
far-red ﬂuence rates. It is likely that phyB is the sen-
sor that detects changes in red, far-red ﬂuence ratio
that occur under canopies and as end-of-day signal. In
this way, phytochrome mediates the shade avoidance
syndrome, provides a plant with information about
the proximity of its neighbors, and contributes to the
time-sensing mechanism.
Cryptochrome is also a chromoprotein. Cryp-
tochrome has two chromophores—FAD and a
pterin—and bears similarity to the microbial DNA
repair enzyme, photolyase. Cryptochrome mediates
hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and setting
the biological clock. Cryptochrome also has a role in
determining time of ﬂowering.
The study of photoreceptor signal transduction
is in its infancy, although some signiﬁcant advances
have been made. Phytochrome appears to operate
in two modes. Phytochrome has serine-threonine
kinase activity and at least two signaling partners are
known. PKS1 and NDPK2 are both phosphorylated
by phyA in vitro. phyA can also phosphorylate cry1,
which may help to explain the extensive interactions
between phytochrome and cryptochrome in regulat-
ing de-etiolation. Phytochrome also regulates gene
action through the translocation of phyB into the
nucleus where it has a role in activating or suppress-
ing transcription. The mode of action of cryptochrome
is unknown, but its similarity to photolyase suggests
that cryptochrome may have a redox function. Cryp-
tochrome is also readily phosphorylated, which may be
signiﬁcant in the signal transduction chain.

Tropisms and Nastic Movements:
Orienting Plants in Space
The power of movement is not normally associated with
plants. Yet movement pervades the life of the green
plant. Movement in higher plants does not involve loco-
motion as it does in animals, nor is it so obvious. Plant
movement is mostly slow and deliberate, but it is a
key factor in determining the orientation of plants in
space. Plants that have been inadvertently placed in the
horizontal position will reorient their root and shoot
to the vertical. House plants will bend, appearing to
seek light coming through a window. Leaves may peri-
odically rise and fall throughout the day and night,
while others track the sun as it moves across the sky.
Leaves of the Venus ﬂytrap snap closed on a hapless
insect. While most plant movements are relatively slow,
they nonetheless serve important functions by position-
ing organs for the uptake of nutrients and water and
optimal interception of sunlight, or (in the case of the
ﬂytrap) obtaining nutrients such as nitrogen through
the leaves.
There are two principal categories of movement in
plants, based on the distinctiveness of their mechanisms.
Growth movements are irreversible. They arise as
the result of differential growth within an organ or
between two different organs. Turgor movements
are reversible, resulting from simple volume changes in
certain cells—most often in a special organ called the
pulvinus. Within each group, we can further distinguish
between nutation, tropism, and nastic movement.
The term nutation (or circumnutations) denotes a
regular rotary or helical movement of plant organs, most
typically the stem apex, in space. Nutations are best de-
monstrated by time-lapse photography. Tropic respon-
ses are directionally related to the stimulus such
as light (phototropism), gravity (gravitropism), water
(hydrotropism), or touch (thigmotropism). Nastic respon-
ses are not obviously related to any vector in the stimu-
lus. Directionality of nastic responses is inherent in the
tissue and includes epinasty (bending down), hyponasty
(bending up), nyctinasty (the rhythmic sleep movements
of leaves), seismonasty (response to mechanical shock),
thermonasty (temperature), and thigmonasty (touch).
This chapter will focus on the three plant move-
ments that have been explored most thoroughly. These
are

phototropism, particularly the nature of the pho-
toreceptor and the role of auxin in the signal trans-
duction chain,
•
gravitropism, including a brief discussion of the
nature of the gravitational stimulus and the mecha-
nism of gravity perception, the particular character
of gravitropism in shoots and roots, and the role

23.1 PHOTOTROPISM:
REACHING FOR THE SUN
Most people are familiar with the sight of house plants
bending toward the light from an open window, an
everyday example of the phenomenon called pho-
totropism (Figure 23.1). Phototropism is a classic plant
physiology problem that has attracted the interest of
botanists since the middle of the nineteenth century.
Darwin’s study of phototropism, published in his book
The Power of Movement in Plants in 1881, is credited
with overcoming the preoccupation of English-speaking
botanists with descriptive and taxonomic biology and
stimulating an interest in the more dynamic aspects of
plant function. Cell elongation in phototropically stim-
ulated grass coleoptiles also led to Went’s discovery of
plant hormones (Chapter 18).
Tropic responses may be either positive or negative.
If a plant responds in the direction of the stimulus (e.g.,
toward a light source) it is said to be positive. If it
grows away from the stimulus it is said to be negative.
Whether the phototropic response is positive or negative
depends largely on the nature of the organ or its age.
For example, coleoptiles, hypocotyls, and the elongating
portions of stems and other aerial organs are for the
most part positively phototropic while the tendrils of
most climbing plants are negatively phototropic. Leaves
are normally plagiotropic, which means they orient at
FIGURE 23.1 The phototropic response in oat (Avena
sativa) coleoptiles. Left: Dark-grown seedling placed
in unilateral blue light, from the right, for 90 minutes.
Right: Unlighted control. Note that the overall length
of the coleoptile is approximately the same in the two
seedlings.
angles intermediate to the light. Roots, on the other
hand, are largely nonphototropic, although some may
exhibit a weakly negative response. The stems of ivy
(Hedera helix) are negatively phototropic during the
shade-loving juvenile stage, but older branches become
positively phototropic. The stems of ivy-leafed toad
ﬂax (Cymbalaria muralis) become negatively phototropic
following fertilization. This interesting behavior helps
to place ripening seed pods into crevices in the walls on
which the plant is normally found.
23.1.1 PHOTOTROPISM IS A RESPONSE
TO A LIGHT GRADIENT
Phototropism is often deﬁned as a response to unilateral
light, and so it is in the laboratory. Under normal growth
conditions, however, the bending response will occur
even in plants that are receiving light from all sides.
All that is required is that the ﬂuence rate be unequally
distributed. In experiments with bilaterally illuminated
grass coleoptiles, for example, as little as 20 percent
difference in ﬂuence rate on the two sides of the organ
will induce a bending response (Figure 23.2). Thus light
can be presented unilaterally (as it is in most laboratory
experiments), bilaterally, from all sides, and even from
above, providing only that a gradient is created across
the organ. Phototropism is thus a growth response to a
light gradient.
The magnitude of a light gradient across an organ
such as a coleoptile is dependent on optical properties
of the tissue as well as differences in incident light.
A light gradient across an organ, for example, can be
FIGURE 23.2 A phototropic response will occur whenever
there is a light gradient established across the stem or
coleoptile axis. The upper part of the ﬁgure represents
unilateral illumination, which is normal in experimental
situations. The lower part of the ﬁgure illustrates bilat-
eral illumination, with the highest ﬂuence rate from the
right. Phototropic curvature is the same in either case.

intensiﬁed by screening within the organ. Pigments,
including but not limited to the photoreceptor itself,
will attenuate the light as it passes through the organ.
Light can also be attenuated by scattering, reﬂection,
or diffraction within the cells or as it passes between
cells. Thus gradients across individual cells, measured
by using microﬁberoptic probes, may vary from 5:1
to 50:1. To further complicate matters, organs such
as coleoptiles appear to function as light pipes. This
means that light applied to the tip, for example, will
be transmitted through the coleoptile to cells fur-
ther down the organ. Thus the phototropic stimulus
is far from being a simple matter. These complex
interactions between light and the optical properties
of tissue have led to signiﬁcant difﬁculties in experimen-
tal design as well as in interpretation of the resulting
data.
23.1.2 PHOTOTROPISM IS A
BLUE-LIGHT RESPONSE
Since the 1930s, action spectra for phototropism have
been repeatedly determined for a number of organisms,
but have been most thoroughly documented for coleop-
tiles of oats (Avena sativa) and maize (Zea mays) and for
sporangiophores of the fungus Phycomyces. The action
spectra for oat coleoptiles and Phycomyces are virtually
identical, indicating that they share a homologous, if not
common, photoreceptor. All other phototropic action
spectra are similar and consistently show two peaks in
the blue region of the spectrum near 475 nm and 450 nm
and a small peak or shoulder at 420 nm (Figure 23.3).
In addition there is a broad action peak in the UV-A
region near 370 nm. The action spectra for both oat and
Phycomyces phototropism show an additional peak in the
region of 280 nm, indicating that the photoreceptor is
probably a chromoprotein.
As early as the 1940s, it was suggested that the
photoreceptor could be a ﬂavin molecule such as ribo-
ﬂavin. However, because of its action spectrum the pho-
toreceptor for phototropism was subject to the same
ﬂavin-carotenoid controversy described in the previous
chapter for other blue-light responses now known
to be regulated by the cryptochromes. On the other
hand, there were several physiological results that
ruled out carotenoids as the photoreceptor for pho-
totropism long before the responsible pigment, photo-
tropin, was ﬁnally discovered and shown to be a
ﬂavo-protein. Carotenoid biosynthesis, for example,
can be blocked, either by mutation or by treatment
of seedlings with the herbicide norﬂurazon, which
inhibits
the
enzyme

desaturase.

carotenoid-deﬁcient

mutants,

seedlings, and norﬂurazon-treated seedlings all exhibit
a normal phototropic response to blue light.

23.1.3 PHOTOTROPISM ORIENTS
A PLANT FOR OPTIMAL
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
The phototropic blue-light response is distinct from
the blue-light responses mediated by phytochrome
and cryptochrome that were discussed in the previous
chapter. Phytochrome and cryptochrome responses
are morphogenetic responses—they alter the pattern
of growth and development. The singular impact of
phototropism, on the other hand, is that it orients
growth and leaf angle toward incident light in order
to maximize light interception for photosynthesis. The
bending of coleoptiles and hypocotyls is only the most
visible part of a larger blue-light syndrome that plants
use to optimize photosynthesis. Plants also use blue light
to control stomatal opening and facilitate gas exchange
as well as to relocate chloroplasts within the cell.
It has long been known that stomatal opening is
under the control of light. On the one hand, light
absorbed by chlorophyll (i.e., red light) stimulates stom-
atal opening and obviously depends on photosynthetic
reactions in the guard cell chloroplasts. However, there
is a second, much more sensitive, system that is driven
by low levels of blue light. Most of the evidence points
to a dominant role of the blue-light response in the early

394
Chapter 23 / Tropisms and Nastic Movements: Orienting Plants in Space
phases of stomatal opening, such as when the stomata
open at dawn, prior to the beginning of photosynthesis.
Plants also use blue light to control the high-light
avoidance response of chloroplasts in the mesophyll
cells. In low light, the chloroplasts always gather along
the cell walls that are parallel to the surface, (i.e., peri-
clinal walls) that are perpendicular to the incident light
(Figure 23.4). In high light, such as direct sunlight,
the chloroplasts avoid potential damage by lining up
along the anticlinal walls (i.e., parallel to the incident
light). The redistribution of chloroplasts appears to be
in response to a light gradient through the cytoplasm,
so the responsible photoreceptor is probably located
in the cytoplasm, not the chloroplasts. The mecha-
nism of redistribution has yet to be discovered, but the
cytoskeleton is commonly involved in moving organelles
within the cell and may be involved in the movement of
chloroplasts as well.
23.1.4 FLUENCE RESPONSE CURVES
ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLEXITY
OF PHOTOTROPIC RESPONSES
Perhaps no aspect of phototropism has indicated the
complexity of the process so much as attempts to deﬁne
relationships between ﬂuence and response. Phototro-
pism is characterized by a rather curious ﬂuence-
response curve, quite unlike most photobiological
responses.
Fluence response curves are generally obtained
by monitoring the response of the organ to differ-
ent total amounts of light (ﬂuence), usually by using a
single ﬂuence rate but varying the presentation time.
Figure 23.5 shows a ﬂuence-response curve determined
for Avena coleoptile phototropism that illustrates the
classic response to increasing ﬂuence. There is an initial
rise to a ﬁrst peak, which is called ﬁrst positive curva-
ture. With increasing ﬂuence, curvature declines, to the
point that this may even result in a bending away from
the light source. This decline and negative response is
called ﬁrst negative curvature. Note that ﬁrst negative
curvature is not necessarily ‘‘negative’’ in the sense of
bending away from the light. It may be simply a reduced
positive response. Following the region of ﬁrst negative
curvature, the response curve again rises into what is
called second positive curvature. In some cases, a sec-
ond negative and even a third positive curvature have
been reported. First positive curvature is also known
as tip curvature, because it is restricted to the apex of
coleoptiles. Second positive curvature is also called basal
curvature because the curvature extends more toward
the basal region of the coleoptile.

interception. In high-light conditions (right) the chloroplasts gather along the side
(anticlinal) walls, or parallel to the incident light, in order to avoid damage due to
excessive light. Mesophyll cells are shown in cross-section (A) and surface view (B).

There is a fundamental law of photochemistry,
called the Bunsen-Roscoe reciprocity law, which says
the product of a photochemical reaction is determined
by the total amount of energy presented, regardless of
ﬂuence rate or presentation time. In other words, the
same result is obtained with either a brief exposure
to a high ﬂuence rate or a longer exposure to a low
ﬂuence rate. Numerous experiments have established
that the reciprocity law applies to ﬁrst positive cur-
vature but does not apply to ﬁrst negative or second
positive curvatures. Second positive curvature is instead
very time-dependent. In other words, second positive
curvature is more dependent on presentation time than
on ﬂuence rate. Failure of reciprocity for second pos-
itive curvature suggests the possibility that more than
one photoreceptor might be involved. However, action
spectra have been determined for both ﬁrst and second
positive curvature and they are identical. Apparently
both ﬁrst and second positive curvature are mediated by
the same photoreceptor and the complexities of second
positive curvature are due to subsequent events in the
signal transduction chain.
23.1.5 THE PHOTOTROPIC RESPONSE
IS ATTRIBUTED TO A LATERAL
REDISTRIBUTION OF
DIFFUSIBLE AUXIN
At the same time F. W. Went and his contemporaries
had chosen to study the inﬂuence of the apex on coleop-
tile elongation, parallel studies on the role of the root
apex were being conducted in Germany by N. Cholodny.
The result was independent proposals by Cholodny, in
1924, and Went, in 1926, that the apex was able to
inﬂuence cell elongation in the more basipetal extension
region of the organ. These ideas of these 2 investigators
were drawn together in the late 1920s in an attempt to
explain phototropism. The Cholodny-Went hypoth-
esis states that unilateral illumination induces a lateral
redistribution of endogenous auxin near the apex of the
organ. This asymmetry in auxin distribution is main-
tained as the auxin is transported longitudinally toward
the base of the organ. The higher concentration of auxin
on the shaded side of the organ stimulates those cells
to elongate more than those on the lighted side. It is
this differential growth that causes curvature toward the
light source.
The experimental basis for the Cholodny-Went
hypothesis is derived largely from agar-diffusion exper-
iments originally conducted by Went and described
earlier in Chapter18. In Went’s experiments, oat coleop-
tiles were ﬁrst stimulated with unilateral light. The
coleoptile apices were then excised, split longitudinally,
and the two halves placed on agar blocks in order to col-
lect the auxin that diffused out of the base. The amount
of auxin collected in the agar blocks was then assayed by
the Avena curvature test (Chapter 18). Went reported
that a signiﬁcantly higher quantity of auxin was collected
from the shaded half of the coleoptile apex than from the
lighted half, indicating that unilateral lighting caused a
greater proportion of the auxin to be transported down
the shaded side of the coleoptile.
Doubts as to the validity of the Cholodny-Went
hypothesis arose from numerous unsuccessful attempts
to verify asymmetric auxin distribution by applying
14C-labeled IAA to tropically stimulated coleoptiles.
These problems, however, may be largely attributed to
poor experimental technique. It is now evident that a
large proportion of the radioactive auxin taken up by
the tissue in those experiments did not enter the auxin
transport stream. When care is taken to discount this
nondiffusible auxin, a clear differential in auxin transport
can be detected. For example, when maize coleoptile tips
were supplied with 14C-IAA, approximately 65 percent
of the radioactivity was recovered from the shaded side.
There was no signiﬁcant asymmetry when subapical
sections were used, further evidence that the lateral
redistribution of auxin occurs at the very apex of the
coleoptile.
In the 1960s, the Cholodny-Went hypothesis was
systematically reevaluated by W. R. Briggs and his col-
leagues. Briggs repeated Went’s original split-tip exper-
iments but, unlike Went, he excised the tips and placed
them on agar blocks before presenting the phototropic
stimulus. The results (Figure 23.6) clearly demonstrate
that when the tip is partially split, leaving tissue conti-
nuity only at the very apex of the coleoptile, exposure
to unilateral light causes an increase in the amount of
diffusible auxin on the shaded side and a decrease on
the lighted side. The total amount of auxin recovered,
however, remains effectively constant. When lateral
diffusion of auxin is prevented throughout the entire

length of the tip, no such asymmetric auxin distribution
is observed. These results clearly support the princi-
pal tenet of the Cholodny-Went hypothesis, namely,
that unilateral light induces a preferential migration of
auxin down the shaded side of the coleoptile. Their
experiments also conﬁrmed that auxin production in
coleoptiles of Zea mays is conﬁned to the apical 1 to 2 mm
and that lateral redistribution during phototropic stim-
ulation probably occurs within the most apical one-half
mm.
Compelling support for the Cholodny-Went the-
ory has been provided by a more recent study of auxin
redistribution in Brassica oleraceae hypocotyls. The free
IAA concentration found on the shaded side of the
hypocotyl was found to be at least 20 percent higher
than on the lighted side following phototropic stimula-
tion. Moreover, the differential auxin concentration was
accompanied by a several-fold increase in the expres-
sion of auxin-regulated genes on the shaded side of the
hypocotyls, including two members of the α-expansin
family of genes that are necessary for cell wall extension
(see Chapter 17). Finally, both the auxin differential and
the differential in auxin-regulated gene expression could
be detected before there was any noticeable curvature of
the hypocotyls.
23.1.6 PHOTOTROPISM AND RELATED
RESPONSES ARE REGULATED BY
A FAMILY OF BLUE-SENSITIVE
FLAVOPROTEINS
Two lines of study led to the discovery of the photore-
ceptor for phototropism, now called phototropin. In
the late 1980s, it was reported that blue light stimulated
the phosphorylation of a 120 kDa plasma membrane
protein localized in the actively growing regions of etio-
lated pea seedlings. This is the same region that is most
responsive to the phototropic stimulus. After extensive
biochemical and physiological characterization, the pro-
tein was found to be a kinase that autophosphorylates in
blue light. There was also a strong suggestion that this
kinase was the photoreceptor for phototropism.
A short time later, a mutant characterized by a
failure to respond to the phototropic stimulus (non-
phototropic hypocotyl 1, or nph1) was isolated from
Arabidopsis. Plants carrying the nph1 mutant not only
failed to exhibit phototropism, but coincidentally lacked
the 120 kDa membrane protein. When the NPH1 gene
was cloned, it was found, as expected, to encode the
120 kDa protein. The NPH1 holoprotein was subse-
quently renamed phototropin 1 (phot1) because of its
functional role in phototropism.
Phototropin 1 is a ﬂavoprotein with two ﬂavin
mononucleotide (FMN) chromophores (Figure 23.7). It
has a carboxy-terminal domain with the characteristics
of a serine-threonine kinase. The photosensory domain
at the N-terminus has two distinctive domains called
LOV domains, so named because they share charac-
teristics with microbial proteins that regulate responses
to light, oxygen, or voltage. Not surprisingly, the two
LOV domains are the two sites that bind FMN and make
phototropin responsive to light. A second phototropin,
phototropin 2 (phot2), has since been discovered. On
the basis of amino acid sequence, the two phototropins
are about 60 % similar, but the two LOV domains are
virtually identical and each phototropin binds two FMN
chromophores.1
The two phototropins found in Arabidopsis, phot1
and phot2, exhibit some overlapping functions. Each
also appears to have unique physiological roles. First
positive curvature appears to be mediated solely by
1In 2001, the gene for photo2 was originally described as
NPL1 (NPH-like1), a homolog of the gene NPH1 (non-
phototropic hypocotyl 1) or PHOT1. NPL1 has since been
renamed PHOT2 to bring the nomenclature in line with
phototropin 1.

phot1, while second positive curvature is mediated by
both phot1 and phot2. Phot1 and photo2 contribute
equally to stomatal opening, while the avoidance move-
ment of chloroplasts under high light intensities is
mediated only by phot2.
Recent evidence has also indicated a role for
phototropins in the promotion of cotyledon and leaf
expansion and the rhythmic sleep movements of kidney
bean leaves (see Chapter 24).
23.1.7 A HYBRID RED/BLUE LIGHT
PHOTORECEPTOR HAS BEEN
ISOLATED FROM A FERN
A particularly interesting photoreceptor has recently
been isolated from the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris.
Designated neochrome (formerly known as phy3),
this photoreceptor has properties of both phytochrome
and
phototropin
(Figure
23.7).
The
amino
acid
sequence of the amino-terminal domain shows a
signiﬁcant homology to the chromophore-binding
domain of phytochrome. Furthermore, when the gene
was expressed in yeast and the puriﬁed protein was
reconstituted with a phycocyanobilin chromophore, it
showed typical phytochrome photoreversible behavior.
But neochrome also has the two LOV domains, which
bind FMN, and a serine/threonine kinase domain
at the C-terminus that are virtually identical to
phototropin. Neochrome is required for phototropism
in Adiantum, which is regulated by red as well as blue
light. Neochrome is clearly a hybrid photoreceptor
that mediates red, far-red, and blue-light responses.
What is curious, however, is that Adiantum also has
two fully functional phototropins like their higher
plant counterparts and, again like their higher plant
counterparts, phot2 is solely responsible for mediating
high-light chloroplast avoidance movements.
Several other ferns, mosses, and algae have both
phototropins and neochromes, which raises interesting
questions regarding the evolution of photoreceptors as
well as their physiological action.
23.1.8 PHOTOTROPIN ACTIVITY
AND SIGNAL CHAIN
Participants in the phototropin signal chain are only
now just beginning to ‘‘come to light.’’ Some of the
more important factors can be summarized as follows:
1. Autophosphorylation of phototropin plays a signiﬁcant
role in the phototropic response, probably by initiating
a phosphorylation cascade. Studies employing mutants
of the PHOT1 gene have shown that the protein is
apparently folded in such a way that the phospho-
rylation site is blocked by the LOV2 domain in the
dark. Absorption of blue light by the chromophore
induces a change in the conformation of the pro-
tein so that the phosphorylation site is available and
active. The role of the LOV1 domain is not clear.
Mutants lacking the LOV1 domain have shown that
LOV1 is not necessary for phosphorylation but its
presence does increase kinase activity.
2. Phototropins may be involved in gene regulation. No
substrates directly phosphorylated by phototropin
in planta have yet been identiﬁed, but there are
several proteins that interact with the photore-
ceptor and are necessary for a proper response.
For example, the proteins NONPHOTOTROPIC
HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3) from Arabidopsis and a
homologous protein (called an ortholog) from rice,
COLEOPTILE PHOTOTROPISM 1 (CPT1),
include domains that are characteristic of transcrip-
tional regulators or proteins that are involved in
protein degradation. The mutants nph3 and cpt1,
in which these proteins are missing, show no pho-
totropic response.
3. Phototropin disrupts polar auxin transport. One of the
challenges presented by phototropism is to establish
whether or not a link exists between the absorption

398
Chapter 23 / Tropisms and Nastic Movements: Orienting Plants in Space
of blue light by phototropin and the asymmetrical
auxin distribution proposed by the Cholodny-Went
hypothesis. As described previously, asymmetric
auxin distribution has been demonstrated experi-
mentally. Recent experiments have focused on the
relationship between phototropin and auxin efﬂux
facilitator PIN1. PIN1 is normally localized at the
basal ends of xylem-associated cells where it
serves to facilitate the polar vertical ﬂow of auxin
(Chapter 18). When the location of PIN1 in Arabi-
dopsis hypocotyls was monitored by immunoﬂuore-
scence microscopy following phototropic stimulus,
the basal location of PIN1 in wildtype plants
was disrupted in the cortical cells on the shaded
side of the hypocotyl. A similar disruption was
not observed in phot1 mutants. These results
suggest that phototropic bending is initiated by
a phototropin-mediated decrease in the vertical
transport of auxin. This would lead to a retention
or sequestering of auxin, and consequent increased
growth, in those cells that are directly involved in
phototropic bending.
23.1.9 PHOTOTROPISM IN GREEN
PLANTS IS NOT WELL
UNDERSTOOD
A ﬁnal area of concern is phototropism in light-grown
plants, where relatively little is known about the
phototropic process. As with phytochrome, discussed in
Chapter 22, most of what we know about phototropism
is derived from laboratory studies with etiolated seed-
lings. However, in light-grown cucumber (Cucumis
sativus) and sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus) seedlings
subjected
to
uniform
lighting,
curvature
of
the
stem can be induced by simply shading one of the
FIGURE 23.8 Curvature in cucumber (Cucumis sativus)
seedlings induced by shading cotyledons. The left-hand
cotyledon was covered with aluminum foil and the
seedling uniformly irradiated with white light for 8
hours. (After Shuttleworth, J. E., M. Black. 1977. Planta
135:51.)
cotyledons (Figure 23.8), and the phototropic response
of sunﬂower seedlings is markedly decreased if the
leaves are removed. The cucumber response, at least,
differs from the classical phototropic response in that
it is induced by red light rather than blue light. This
appears to be a phytochrome-mediated response and is
related to inhibition of hypocotyl elongation below the
irradiated cotyledon. Both the cucumber and sunﬂower
responses may be attributed to the fact that the leaves
are a prime source of auxin required for the growth
response. Both cucumber and white mustard (Sinapis
alba) also exhibit a classical phototropic response
induced by irradiating the hypocotyls directly with blue
light. Clearly the control of stem growth in green plants
is an area where there is still much to learn.
23.2 GRAVITROPISM
Gravitropism is probably one of the most unfailingly
obvious and familiar plant phenomena to most people
(Figure 23.9). Everyone is aware that shoots always
grow ‘‘up’’ and roots always grow ‘‘down.’’ Or do they?
A casual walk through the woods or garden should
reveal how overly simpliﬁed this view is. The lateral
branches of most trees and shrubs do not grow up; they
grow outward in a more or less horizontal position.
Stolons (or runners) of strawberry (Fragaria) plants and
buttercups (Ranunculus) also grow horizontally along
the soil surface. Dig into the soil and you will ﬁnd
rhizomes (underground stems) and many roots growing
horizontally. Many pendulous inﬂorescences show no
directional preference for growth, but hang down simply
of their own weight.
FIGURE 23.9 Gravitropism in maize (Zea mays) seedlings.
Four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were placed in the
horizontal position for 3 hours. Note the shoot exhibits
negative gravitropism and the root exhibits positive grav-
itropism.

23.2 Gravitropism
399
Unlike most other environmental stimuli, the force
of gravity is omnipresent and nonvarying. It does not
vary in magnitude as temperature does, for example.
Gravity cannot be turned on and off, such as light at
dawn and dusk. Moreover, gravity is not a unilateral
stimulus—there is no gradient component in gravity.
Cells on the lower side of a stem or root are subjected to
the same gravitational force as those on the upper side.
Consequently, it is likely that gravity can be detected
only by the movement of some structure or structures
within the cells—a movement that establishes an initial
asymmetry in the cell and is translated in terms of
pressure. The mass and movement of whatever structure
is involved must be consistent with the sensitivity and
speed of the gravitational response and there must be
a mechanism for transducing the pressure signal into a
biochemical signal that can lead to a differential growth
response.
23.2.1 GRAVITROPISM IS MORE THAN
SIMPLY UP AND DOWN
It is true that the root and shoot of the primary plant
axis do align themselves parallel with the direction
of gravitational pull. Such an alignment is said to
be orthogravitropic. The primary root, which grows
toward the center of the earth, exhibits positive gravit-
ropism. The shoot, which grows away from the center
of the earth, exhibits negative gravitropism. Organs
such as stolons, rhizomes, and some lateral branches,
which grow at right angles to the pull of gravity, are
said to be diagravitropic. Organs oriented at some
intermediate angle (between 0◦and 90◦to the vertical)
are said to be plagiogravitropic. Lateral stems and lat-
eral roots are commonly plagiogravitropic. Organs that
exhibit little or no sensitivity to gravity are said to be
agravitropic.
The advantages to the plant of positive and nega-
tive gravitropic growth responses are fairly obvious.
Seeds may assume a random orientation in the soil, but
in order to ensure survival, the shoot, with its photo-
synthetic structures, must be above ground in order
to take advantage of sunlight. The root system must
remain in the soil in order to secure anchorage and a
reliable supply of nutrients and water. The primary root
most often exhibits a strongly positive orthogravitropic
response.
Secondary
roots
(i.e.,
ﬁrst-level
branch
roots), however, tend to grow more horizontally
while tertiary roots are generally agravitropic. This
hierarchy of gravitational responses ensures that the
root system more effectively ﬁlls the available space
and thus more efﬁciently mines the soil of water
and nutrients (Figure 23.10). In a similar fashion, a
hierarchy of negative orthogravitropic, diagravitropic,
and plagiogravitropic responses in the shoot system

helps to reduce mutual shading and ensures a more
efﬁcient capture of sunlight to drive photosynthesis.
23.2.2 THE GRAVITATIONAL STIMULUS
IS THE PRODUCT OF INTENSITY
AND TIME
Gravitational stimulation (stimulus quantity or dose) is
the product of the intensity of the stimulus and the time
over which the stimulus is applied:
d = t · a
where a is the acceleration of mass due to gravity
(in g), t is the time (in seconds) over which the stim-
ulus is applied, and d is the dose in g seconds (g z s)
(see Box 23.1: Methods in the Study of Gravitropism).
The minimum dose required to induce gravitropic cur-
vature is called the threshold dose. Threshold dose will
vary depending on the organism or experimental con-
ditions. Values of d in the range of 240 g · s (at 22.5◦C)
to 120 g z s (at 27.5◦C) have been reported for Avena
coleoptiles, but more careful mathematical analyses sug-
gest that less than 30 g · s (i.e., an acceleration of 1 g for
less than 30 seconds) is sufﬁcient to induce gravitropic
curvature in roots. Three other parameters are of inter-
est when deﬁning gravistimulation: presentation time,
reaction time, and threshold intensity.

METHODS IN THE
STUDY OF
GRAVITROPISM
A fundamental requirement for any form of scientiﬁc
experimentation is that of controlling the application of
the stimulus in the form of intensity (or concentration)
and duration. Since the gravitational ﬁeld of earth cannot
be extinguished (except in the microgravity conditions
of space), experimentation on gravitational effects on
plants and other organisms has required some unique
approaches.
Most experiments require a mass acceleration in the
range of 1 g or less, which can easily be achieved by
simply orienting the organ (e.g., a coleoptile or primary
root) away from the vertical. The force (at least for
short-term stimulation) is generally proportional to the
sine of the angular deviation from the vertical. Thus
the force is greatest in the horizontal position since sine
90◦= 1 (the sine of angles less than 90◦is less than 1).
Seedling shoots generally must be oriented between 0.5◦
to 10◦from the vertical in order to induce curvature.
Forces greater than 1 g can be achieved by the use
of specially designed centrifuges. Similar centrifuges
have been used earlier in the century for studying the
properties of animal (egg) membranes, and so forth.
Centrifugation has not been used extensively in the
study of gravitropisn, but those experiments in which it
has been used have provided some useful insights.
The problem of extinguishing gravitational forces
has been approached in two ways: clinostats and space
ﬂight. A clinostat is a device that holds the plant axis in a
horizontal position while continuously rotating it about
the horizontal axis. This does not actually extinguish the
gravitational ﬁeld, of course, but the summated effect is
a nondirected constant stimulation. With the clinostat,
plants can ﬁrst be subjected to a brief stimulus and then
rotated to, in effect, remove any further stimulus. As
might be expected, continuous multilateral stimulation
has been found to inﬂuence a variety of physiological
parameters. Avena seedlings, for example, respond with
increased growth rate and increased respiration. Some
of these changes may be incidental, but others may
inﬂuence the gravitropic response. Results must always
be interpreted with caution.
SPACE—THE FINAL FRONTIER
The advent of space ﬂight in the 1950s has pro-
vided plant scientists with unique opportunities to study
responses to microgravity conditions. Since 1960, when
the ﬁrst wheat and maize seeds were carried aloft on
Sputnik 4, experiments with plants have been con-
ducted on manned and unmanned spacecraft from both
the United States and the Soviet Union (now Rus-
sia). Perhaps not unexpectedly, physiological effects
of microgravity are not limited to gravitropism but
embrace a variety of other cellular events. Many of
the effects are deleterious, including reduced growth,
chromosomal aberrations, and other cytological abnor-
malities. Death at the ﬂowering stage was common
until, in 1982, Arabidopsis thaliana were successfully car-
ried through a complete life cycle and produced viable
seed. Many of the difﬁculties could be attributed simply
to the logistics of trying to maintain plants in space, but
even with improved methods, difﬁculties are still being
encountered. As yet the returns may be modest, but the
use of microgravity as an experimental tool is ripe for
exploitation.
The minimum duration of stimulation required to
induce a curvature that is just detectable is known as the
presentation time. The intensity of stimulation should
also be deﬁned, although a stimulus of 1 g at 90◦is more
or less standard. A force of 1 g is easily obtained by simply
placing the stem or root in a horizontal position. Presen-
tation times of 12 seconds for cress roots and 30 seconds
for Avena coleoptiles have been determined, but a brief
1-second stimulus will induce curvature in Avena coleop-
tiles if the stimulus is repeated every 5 seconds. This
suggests that some cumulative receptive process begins
the instant the plant assumes a horizontal position.
Presentation time should not be confused with reac-
tion time, which is the interval between the presentation
of the stimulus and the actual development of curvature.
Reaction times involve the complete signal transduction
sequence that leads to the asymmetric growth response.
Typically, 10 minutes is required before curvature can
be visually detected, although reaction times may vary
from a few minutes to hours, depending on the species
and conditions. In experiments employing sensitive elec-
tronic position-sensing transducers, curvature of maize
coleoptiles could be detected within about 1.5 minutes
of horizontal placement, while bending of the mesocotyl
could not be detected before 3.5 minutes.
The minimum stimulus intensity required to induce
a response is known as the threshold intensity. Thresh-
old intensities have been determined for a variety of
plant organs under different experimental conditions.
The results are remarkably consistent and indicate that
roots are perhaps an order of magnitude more sensi-
tive than shoots. In land-based clinostat experiments

facilitators (red circles). The signal is then transmitted to the elongation zone of the

(see Box 23.1), values for threshold intensity for Avena
coleoptiles and roots were found to be 1.4 × 10−3 g and
1.4 × 10−4 g. Values calculated for lettuce seedling
hypocotyl and roots in experiments aboard the Salyut 7
spacecraft were 2.9 × 10−3 g and 1.5 × 10−4 g, respec-
tively. It is apparent that many plants are very sensitive
to gravitational stimulus.
23.2.3 ROOT GRAVITROPISM OCCURS
IN FOUR PHASES
Virtually all of the studies on root gravitropism have
focused on primary roots and have identiﬁed four suc-
cessive phases: perception, transduction, transmission,
and growth response (Figure 23.11). Although the actual
timing may vary depending on the conditions of the
experiment, the initial perception phase occurs within
perhaps one second of orienting a root off the vertical
and involves biophysical mechanisms (e.g., pressure) for
sensing the direction of gravitational pull. The trans-
duction phase, occurring between 1 and 10 seconds
following reorientation, involves the conversion of the
biophysical single to a biochemical signal. The transmis-
sion phase occurs between 10 seconds and 10 minutes
of reorientation and involves a redistribution of auxin
within the root tip. The growth response, due to the
unequal distribution of auxin, causes curvature of the
root toward a more vertical orientation.
23.2.3.1 Gravity is perceived by the columella
cells in the root cap.
Gravitropic perception in the
root is localized in the root cap, a thimble-like mass of
cells that covers the tip of the root. The root cap consists
of a central core of cells (the columella) arranged in
regular tiers and one or more outer layers of peripheral
cells. Traditionally, the function of the root cap was
thought to be twofold; it provides physical protection
for the root apical meristem and its peripheral cells
secrete a mucilaginous polysaccharide that lubricates
the path of the growing root.
A third function, that of gravity perception, has
been established by experiments in which the root cap
is wholly or partially surgically removed (Figure 23.12).
Complete removal of the root cap does not interfere with
the elongation of the root but completely abolishes any
gravitropic response. Decapped roots will recover sen-
sitivity to gravity after about 24 hours, which correlates
with the regeneration of a new cap. Surgical experiments
have also indicated that removal of the central core, or
columella, cells caused the strongest inhibition of the
response to gravity. Individual cells or pairs of columella
cells can be selectively removed or ablated (L. ablatus, to
take away) with a nitrogen laser, in conjunction with an
optical microscope. Ablation of the innermost columella
cells has the greatest impact on root curvature, without
affecting overall growth rate of the root (Figure 23.13).
Laser ablation of the root cap peripheral cells, on the
other hand, has no effect on the gravitropic response.

Driss-Ecole, 2003).
23.2.3.2 Gravity perception involves displace-
ment of starch-ﬁlled amyloplasts.
A response to
gravity must almost certainly involve sedimentation
of some physical structure within the cell. F. Noll
was the ﬁrst to suggest, in 1892, that plants might
sense gravity in a manner similar to some animals.
Crustaceans, molluscs, and many other invertebrates
have gravity-sensing organs called statocysts, small
innervated cavities lined with sensory hairs. Within
the cavity are one or more statoliths, tiny granules of
sand or calcium carbonate that are pulled downward
by gravity. When the statocyst changes position, the
statoliths also shift position, bending the sensory hairs
and sending an action potential to inform the central
nervous system of the change.
In 1900, G. Haberlandt and E. Nemec indepen-
dently adapted the statolith theory to account for plant
responses to gravity. Based on careful cytological stud-
ies, they proposed the starch-statolith hypothesis in
which starch grains found in specialized tissues func-
tion as statoliths. Statocytes are cells containing sedi-
mentable starch grains. Tissues that contain statocytes
are known as statenchyma. Support for the statolith
hypothesis was found in earlier reports by Darwin and
others that removal of the root tip, where most of the
starch grains are found, resulted in a loss of gravit-
ropic response. Nonetheless, the hypothesis was not
universally accepted and over the decades a number of
investigators have attempted to prove or disprove it.
A statolith is not a naked starch grain, but a group
of starch grains contained within a membrane, called an
amyloplast (Figure 23.14). There may be 1 to several
individual grains within an amyloplast and as many as a
dozen amyloplasts in each statocyte. This compares with
the single large grains characteristic of starch storage
organs. Not all amyloplasts in all cells are readily mobile.
In fact, detection of putative statoliths, or readily mobile
amyloplasts, appears to be largely conﬁned to regions of
high gravitropic sensitivity. These include the mass of
columella cells in the central core of the root cap and, in
hypocotyls, a zone of endodermal cells that sheath the
vascular tissues (also referred to as the starch sheath).
Mobile amyloplasts may also be found in the inner
cortical cells of aerial organs and the pulvini, or motor
organs in the nodes of grass stems that are responsive to
gravity.
Any gravity-sensing mechanism involving particle
sedimentation would have to operate with a speed and
sensitivity consistent with the known speed and sensitiv-
ity of the response. In the 1960s, L. J. Audus undertook
a careful examination of various subcellular particles.
Audus concluded that, of all the cellular organelles, only
starch grains have the mass and density to move through
the viscous cytoplasm within known presentation times.
Ultrastructural examination has shown that other cel-
lular organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum,
may become shifted in cells subjected to gravitational

stimulus, but these movements are thought to be a con-
sequence of starch grain sedimentation. Although there
is still no direct proof for the starch-statolith hypothesis,
there is a large body of evidence that is more consistent
with that idea than any other that has been put forward
to date. This evidence is summarized below:
1. Gravitropism is generally absent in plant species that
have no starch grains or amyloplasts. In lower plants
such as algae and fungi, excess carbohydrate may
not be stored as starch. In these cases, some other
substance may function as statoliths. In the alga
Chara, for example, the role of starch grains is
replaced by granules of barium sulphate.
2. There is a strong correlation between the rate of starch
sedimentation and presentation time. In sweet pea
(Lathyrus odoratus), for example, there is a parallel
increase in both sedimentation time and presenta-
tion time as the temperature is lowered from 30◦C
to 10◦C. The decline in both is presumably related
to an increase in protoplasmic viscosity.
3. Loss of starch by hormone treatment or mutation is
accompanied by a loss of graviresponse. For example,
roots of cress seedlings (Lepidium sativum) treated
with cytokinin or gibberellin at 35◦C become
starch-free in 29 hours. The growth rate of treated
roots is reduced only slightly (0.48 mm h−1 vs.
0.64 mm h−1) but any response to gravity is
completely eliminated. Transfer of the roots to
water in the light results in a parallel recovery of
both amyloplasts and gravitropic responsiveness
after 20 to 24 hours. In maize (Zea mays) the
amylomaize mutant produces smaller amyloplasts
than the wildtype. In studies of the percentage
and speed of amyloplast sedimentation the degree
of coleoptile curvature was strictly correlated
with the size of the amyloplast. Another mutant
of maize, hcf-3 (high chlorophyll ﬂuorescence-3) is
unable to carry out photosynthesis and thus can
form no starch in the leaf base statocytes when the
endosperm reserves have been exhausted. Such
seedlings do not respond to gravity unless fed
sucrose, in which case recovery of both amyloplasts
and sensitivity to gravity was noted.
4. Amyloplasts can be displaced by a high-gradient magnetic
ﬁeld in place of gravity. An intracellular magnetic ﬁeld
has been used to displace statoliths laterally (called
magnetophoresis) in both roots and hypocotyls. The
magnetic ﬁeld also induces a curvature similar to the
gravitropic response.
It is not known how the sedimentation of statoliths
creates physiological asymmetry in the cell or tissue,
although a number of models have been proposed. Most
models agree that it is not the change in position of
the statolith or the process of movement per se that
is important. The preferred view is that the statolith
exerts pressure on one or more membranes or other cel-
lular components. Although there is no direct evidence
for pressure-sensitive membranes in plants, both the
plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
have been suggested as likely targets. Electron micro-
graphs of gravistimulated root statocytes, for example,
commonly show amyloplasts sedimented on the endo-
plasmic reticulum against the lower side of the cell
(Figure 23.14).
23.2.3.3 The transmission and response phases
involve a lateral redistribution of auxin in the
elongation zone.
Like phototropism, development
of curvature in response to gravity ultimately involves a
differential growth response. It is not surprising, then,
that the Cholodny-Went hypothesis of asymmetric
auxin distribution has dominated thinking and research
into gravitropism for more than 60 years. Accordingly,
the hypothesis states that horizontal orientation of the
shoot or roots induces a lateral translocation of auxin
toward the lower side of the organ. Auxin redistribution
would bias the growth rate in favor of the lower side
such that negatively gravitropic organs (e.g., coleoptiles
and shoots) would turn upward. In positively gravitropic
organs such as roots, the higher concentration of auxin
is thought to inhibit elongation on the lower side relative
to the upper, causing the organ to grow downward.
Exogenous auxin, for example, very effectively inhibits
root growth when applied at concentrations of 10−6
M or greater, concentrations that normally stimulate
elongation of coleoptiles and shoots. In addition,
gravitropic curvature is prevented by inhibitors of auxin
transport (TIBA, NPA).
Auxin ﬂow in the root is described by the ‘‘auxin
fountain model’’ (Figure 23.15). Auxin synthesized in the
shoot is transported basipetally through the shoot and
into the root. There it continues to move acropetally
toward the root tip through cells associated with the
central vascular tissues, or stele. In the columella region
of the root cap, the auxin ﬂow is reversed and the auxin
moves basipetally into the cortical cells of the elongation
zone (Figure 23.15A). In a vertical root the ﬂow of
auxin into the cortical region is distributed uniformly
around the root. When the root is displaced horizontally
(Figure 23.15B), the ﬂow of auxin from the columella is
redistributed laterally (i.e., downward). In other words,
auxin ﬂow in a horizontal root is biased toward the lower
side of the root. The implication is that the higher auxin
content on the lower side of the root inhibits elongation
relative to the upper side and the root curves downward.

potential of the columella cells. Within seconds of
reorienting Lepidium sativum roots to a horizontal
position, the columella cells on the lower side of the
root depolarize (the potential becomes less negative)
and those on the upper side hyperpolarize (the potential
becomes more negative). These changes in membrane
potential appear to be in some way related to the
cytoskeleton because they are inhibited by cytochalasin
D, a drug that disrupts the cytoskeleton by binding
to rapidly elongating actin ﬁlaments. There is also
evidence that amyloplasts are connected to the plasma
membrane by actin ﬁlaments. These observations
have given rise to the hypothesis that displacement of
amyloplasts stimulates stretch-activated ion channels.
Stretch-activated channels are so named because they
are activated in patch-clamp experiments when the
membrane is stretched by applied suction. According to
this hypothesis, stretch-activated ion channels would
be responsible for the observed changes in membrane
potential in the columella cells, which in turn would
lead to the asymmetric distribution of auxin.
Changes in the pH of columella cells have also
been observed in gravity-stimulated roots. By using
pH-sensitive ﬂuorescent proteins to monitor changes
in pH during gravistimilation of Arabidopsis root, it has
been shown that pH of the root cap apoplast decreases
from pH 5.5 to 4.5 within 2 minutes of gravistimu-
lation. Conversely, the cytoplasmic pH of columella
cells increases slightly, from pH 7.2 to pH 7.6. These
pH changes in the root cap precede auxin-related pH
changes in the elongation zone by about 10 minutes.
Several investigators have highlighted a role for
calcium in the gravity response of both coleoptiles
and roots. Radio-labeled calcium (45Ca) accumulated
in the upper half of sunﬂower hypocotyls and maize
coleoptiles within one hour of stimulation by gravity.

of

is
prevented by treatment with chloropromazine, an
inhibitor of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin.
This suggests that the response to gravity might at one
stage involve a Ca2+/calmodulin complex.
Experiments with exogenously applied calcium have
provided equally convincing evidence of a role for cal-
cium in root gravitropism. For example, asymmetrically
applied agar blocks containing 10 mM CaCl2 will induce
curvature of maize roots, but only if the block is applied
to the root tip (Figure 23.16). Migration of calcium in
roots appears to be restricted to the root cap—migration
is prevented if the cap is removed—and is directed
toward the lower side of the horizontal root. More-
over, the calcium appears to move not through root
cap cells but through the thick mucilaginous layer that
coats the root cap. The importance of this mucilaginous
coating is reﬂected in the observation that its contin-
ual removal by washing renders the root insensitive to
gravity. Note that the direction of calcium asymmetry
relative to auxin is opposite in gravistimulated coleop-
tiles and roots. In both organs, calcium migrates toward
the potentially concave side. Thus in a horizontally ori-
ented root, calcium moves downward to accumulate on
the lower side of the root cap but it moves toward the
upper side of a coleoptile. The source of this calcium
is unknown, but it could be released from the ER as
the result of an interaction between the amyloplasts and
the ER.

ing EGTA, a calcium chelator, causes the root to grow in

Finally, and perhaps not unexpectedly, recent exper-
iments in which the PIN proteins were linked to a green
ﬂuorescent protein and examined microscopically have
demonstrated that the auxin fountain and root grav-
itropism depend on the coordinated distribution and
activities of the auxin efﬂux facilitators PIN1, PIN2,
and PIN3 (Figure 23.17). PIN1 is localized at the apical
end of cells in the stele and is responsible for deliver-
ing the auxin stream to the root apex. PIN3 is located
along the lateral wall of the columella cells in a verti-
cally oriented primary root, where it diverts the ﬂow of
auxin laterally, or centrifugally, toward the peripheral
root tissues. PIN2 is located primarily on the basal walls
of the peripheral root cap, epidermal, and cortical cells
where it mediates the basipetal stream of auxin toward
the cell elongation zone. The importance of PIN2 in
gravitropism is indicated by the observation that pin2
mutants fail to establish the required lateral auxin dis-
tribution following gravistimulation and do not exhibit
a normal gravitropic response.
When a vertical root is rotated to the horizon-
tal position, two signiﬁcant events occur. First, PIN3
becomes redistributed, accumulating along the lower
sidewalls of the columella cells. This redistribution of
PIN3 presumably diverts the incoming auxin toward the
lower side of the root. Second, PIN2 becomes asym-
metrically distributed between the upper and lower sides
of the root. The evidence suggests that the PIN2 pro-
tein is rapidly turned over due to ubiquitination and

auxin transport facilitator PIN2 in vertical (A) and grav-
istimulated (B) roots. In vertical roots PIN2 is located
more or less symmetrically throughout the peripheral
root cap, epidermis, and cortex, mediating the basipetal
ﬂow of auxin toward the cell elongation zone uniformly
around the root. In gravistimulated roots, enhanced
degradation of PIN2 at the upper side of the root biases
PIN2 location to the lower side.
proteasome-dependent degradation. Gravistimulation
apparently leads to an increased rate of PIN2 degra-
dation in the upper side of the root. At the same time,
higher auxin levels were found to promote increased
retention of PIN2 in the lower side of the root. This
unequal distribution of PIN2 would thus help to main-
tain the auxin gradient originally established by PIN3
in the columella cells.
But how does a root straighten out when it once
again approaches a vertical orientation? It turns out that
auxin can also promote the degradation of PIN2. It has
been proposed that as auxin levels continue to build
up in the lower side of the root, concentrations even-
tually reach a threshold where auxin-mediated PIN2
degradation begins to reduce auxin transport toward the
elongation zone, thus reducing further curvature.
The big unresolved question at this time, of course,
is how the settling of amyloplasts in response to gravity
induces changes in pH, calcium ﬂux, and other second
messengers and how these changes are all linked to
changes in the distribution and activity of the auxin
transport proteins.
23.3 NASTIC MOVEMENTS
In addition to the directed movements of tropisms,
many plants and plant parts, especially leaves, exhibit
nastic movements, in which the direction of movement
is not related to any vectorial component of the stim-
ulus. Nastic responses may involve differential growth,
in which case the movement is permanent. Alterna-
tively the movement may be reversible, caused by turgor
changes in a specialized motor organ.

406
Chapter 23 / Tropisms and Nastic Movements: Orienting Plants in Space
Epinasty and thermonasty are examples of nastic
responses involving differential growth. Epinasty is the
downward bending of an organ, commonly petioles
and leaves whose tips are inclined toward the ground.
It is not a response to gravity, however, but appears
to depend on an unequal ﬂow of auxin through the
upper and lower sides of the petiole. Epinasty is also a
common response to ethylene or excessive amounts of
auxin. The reverse response, called hyponasty, is less
common but can be induced by gibberellins. A typical
example of thermonasty is the repeated opening and
closure of some ﬂower petals, such as tulip and crocuses.
In spite of their repeated nature, however, thermonastic
movements are permanent and result from alternating
differential growth on the two surfaces of the petals.
The most dramatic nastic movements are all turgor
movements, which may be broadly separated into
three categories: (1) leisurely rhythmic leaf movements
in nyctinastic plants, (2) very rapid seismonastic
movements in a limited number of species, and
(3) thigmonastic or thigmotropic curling of threadlike
appendages in climbing plants and vines. Nyctinastic
and seismonastic responses depend on differential
turgor movements in specialized motor organs, called
the pulvinus (pl. pulvini). The pulvinus is a bulbous
structure most often encountered in plant families
characterized by compound leaves, such as the Legumi-
noseae and Oxalidaceae (Figures 23.18 and 23.19). It

occurs at the base of the petiole (primary pulvinus),
the pinna (secondary pulvinus), or the pinnule (tertiary
pulvinus). The pulvinus contains a number of large,
thin-walled motor cells, which alter the position of the
leaf by undergoing reversible changes in turgor.
23.3.1 NYCTINASTIC MOVEMENTS
ARE RHYTHMIC MOVEMENTS
INVOLVING REVERSIBLE
TURGOR CHANGES
Nyctinastic movements (Gr. nyctos, night + nastos = clo-
sure) are most evident in leaves that take up a different
position in the night from that taken during the day.
Typically leaves or leaﬂets are in the horizontal, or open,
position during the day and assume a more vertical, or
closed, orientation at night. The primary leaf of com-
mon bean plants exhibits particularly strong nyctinastic
movements but this can also be seen in Coleus, prayer
plants, and other common garden and house plants.
Observations of nyctinastic movements can be traced
back as far as the writings of Pliny in ancient Greece.
The Swedish botanist C. Linnaeus (in 1775) coined the
term ‘‘plant sleep’’ to describe nyctinastic movements
and they are commonly referred to as sleep movements
today. The sleep movements of bean were prominent in
the discovery of endogenous biological clocks and are
described further in Chapter 24.
Sleep movements have been studied by several
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century botanists, includ-
ing Darwin. The process, however, has been studied
most extensively by Ruth Satter and her colleagues in
Samanea samanan, a member of the Leguminoseae with
doubly compound leaves (Figure 23.18). In Samanea the
paired pinnae and pinnules are normally separated and
spread apart, while in closing they fold toward each
other. In Samanea, the paired pinnules fold basipetally
(i.e., downward), but in other species, such as Mimosa
pudica and Albizzia julibrissin, closure of paired pinnules
is upward, or acropetal. The doubly compound leaves
of Mimosa, Albizzia, and Samanea all have three pulvini,
but the simple leaf of Phaseolus (bean) has only two. It is
the secondary pulvinus that generally exhibits the more
rapid or dramatic change and has consequently been
studied most extensively (Figure 23.19). They are also
relatively large (2 to 3 mm diameter, 4 to 7 mm long
in Samanea) and the changes in curvature are readily
visible to the naked eye.
All nyctinastic responses depend on reversible tur-
gor changes in the pulvinus. The pulvinus is typically
cylindrical in shape, with prominent transverse furrows
which facilitate bending, on the adaxial and abaxial sides
(Figure 23.19). It contains a central vascular core with
both xylem and phloem surrounded by sclerenchyma
tissue. The vascular tissue assumes a linear arrangement

petioles fold toward the stem axis while the leaf blade drops from the horizontal
to the vertical position. (B) Schematic diagram of the bean secondary pulvinus in
cross-section, showing the enlarged cortical parenchyma region. During closure, the
motor cells of the extensor region lose turgor, while the motor cells of the ﬂexor
region gain turgor and the petiole moves toward the stem axis. During opening, the
extensor cells gain turgor and the ﬂexor cells loose turgor, thus driving the petiole
away from the stem axis.
as it passes through the pulvinus, apparently enhanc-
ing the ﬂexibility of the pulvinar region. Outside the
vascular core is a cortex comprised of 10 to 20 layers
of parenchyma cells. The cells of the outer cortex have
thin, elastic walls and exhibit large changes in size and
shape during movement. These are called motor cells.
Changes in the size and shape of the motor cells are
responsible for leaf movement.
The opposite sides of the pulvinus are known as
the extensor and ﬂexor regions (Figure 23.19B). The
extensor region is formed by motor cells that lose turgor
during the bending movement, or ‘‘closure.’’ Motor
cells in the ﬂexor region gain turgor during closure
and lose turgor during opening. Thus, the swelling
of extensor motor cells and shrinkage of ﬂexor motor
cells straightens the pulvinus and opens or spreads apart
leaves or leaﬂets. The relative positions of extensor
and ﬂexor regions in the pulvinus (whether adaxial or
abaxial, for example) will be reversed, depending on
whether closure is basipetal or acropetal.
Nyctinastic movements are sensitive to blue light,
the physiological status of phytochrome, and endo-
genous rhythms. Although the mechanism of signal
perception and how these three stimuli interact is not
known, it is clear that both the receptors and the
responding system (the motor cells) are located in the
pulvinus—at most a few cells apart. It is known that
phytochrome can ‘‘reset’’ the endogenous clock that
regulates nyctinastic leaf oscillations. The relationship
between phytochrome and endogenous rhythms will be
discussed in the next chapter.

MOTOR CELLS
Regardless of the nature of the stimulus, motor cell
volume changes are due to osmotic water uptake (or
loss) as a result of ion accumulation (or loss) across
the cell membrane. What ions are exchanged, how are
they transported, and what is the driving force for ion

movement? These questions have been approached
with a variety of techniques, including histochemi-
cal and radiochemical methods, and scanning electron
microscopy coupled with X-ray analysis. The results
show that leaf movement in all nyctinastic plants stud-
ied thus far is associated with a massive redistribution of
potassium ion (K+) between the symplast and apoplast
in both the extensor and ﬂexor regions of the pulvinus
(Figure 23.20). Swollen extensor cells are characterized
by high protoplasmic K+ and low apoplastic K+. In
Phaseolus vulgaris, fully 30 percent of the osmotic poten-
tial change can be accounted for by K+ movement. The
charge carried by K+ is compensated primarily by chlo-
ride and possibly small organic anions such as malate
and citrate.
Beyond the central role of K+ ﬂux in nastic move-
ments, it is difﬁcult to pin down the speciﬁc sequence
of molecular and biophysical events in the signal chain.
Patch-clamp experiments with isolated Samanea motor
cell protoplasts have established that K+ exchange across
the plasma membrane occurs through K+ channels and
that these channels can be regulated by changing the
membrane polarity. Depolarization of the membrane
opens the channels and allows K+ to move out of the
cell down its electrochemical gradient. It has also been
established that there are pH gradients across the plasma
membranes of motor cells. In the case of open Samanea
pulvina, the pH of the apoplast is about 5.5 in the
ﬂexor region and 6.2 in the extensor region. The cyto-
plasmic pH is approximately neutral in both regions.
Upon a light/dark transition (leading to closure), the
pH gradient in the extensor region dissipates while
in the ﬂexor region the gradient increases. Although
quantitative relationships between H+ ﬂux and K+ ﬂux
have yet to be tested, H+ extrusion could contribute
to the electrochemical gradient necessary to drive K+
uptake. Any observed changes in membrane potential
are undoubtedly the consequence, not the cause, of the
cross-membrane trafﬁc in osmotically active ions.
The prominent roles of K+ channels and H+
pumps have been incorporated into the current model
for motor cell movement. A simpliﬁed version of the
model is shown in Figure 23.21. In this model, the
light signal activates phytochrome (or cryptochrome),
which accelerates inositol phospholipid turnover.

than those normally detected in animal systems. The

of a calcium pump that extrudes Ca2+ would help to
ensure the restoration of Ca2+ homeostasis.
Many details of this model remain to be described,
especially the function of the inositol phospholipid cycle
in plants. Still, plant cells are known to contain virtually
all the required components and the model is consistent
with what has been observed in pulvini thus far. Signiﬁ-
cant advances are to be expected in the future, especially
now that patch-clamp techniques—long a mainstay of
electrophysiology research for animal cells—can be
applied to plant cell protoplasts. This state-of-the-art
technique has been in use for plant cells only since
about 1984, but has proven invaluable for the study of
ion channels.
23.3.3 SEISMONASTY IS A RESPONSE TO
MECHANICAL STIMULATION
A limited number of leguminous plants that possess
pulvini and exhibit nyctinastic movements also exhibit a
response to mechanical stimulation. This phenomenon
is known as seismonasty. Since seismonastic plants
respond to touch, they are sometimes considered
thigmonastic. However, seismonastic plants respond to
a wider variety of stimuli including shaking or wind,
falling raindrops, wounding by cutting, and intense heat
or burning.
The best known example of seismonastic plants is
the tropical shrub Mimosa pudica (Figure 23.22). The
survival advantage of such a response is not certain.
Some have suggested that since these plants grow in
arid, exposed areas where they are exposed to drying
winds, folding of the leaves may be a means of reducing
water loss. Others suggest that it is a means of protection
from large herbivores or insects. However, one thing is
clear—the response is very rapid. When the pulvinus
is stimulated directly, bending begins in less than one
second!
The ultimate response, leaf movement, of course
involves movement of pulvini motor cells just as in nycti-
nastic movements. However, there are three essential
characteristics of the seismonastic response that have
served to focus attention on the early steps of signal
transduction. The ﬁrst of these is the rapidity of the
response. Second, seismonasty follows the ‘‘all-or-none
principle,’’ which means that there is no obvious rela-
tionship between the intensity of the stimulus and the
extent of the response. Third, excitation is propagated
from the place of stimulation. The similarity of these
characteristics to animal nerve transmission has given

rise to the expectation that plants may also be capable
of transmitting stimuli in the form of potential changes.
Indeed it has now been well established that virtually
any part of the Mimosa plant can perceive stimuli and
transmit them as electric pulses to the pulvini. Although
plants do not have discrete nerve tissue, it appears that
phloem sieve tubes can and do function as conduits for
signal transmission. Stimulation of the petiole results in a
rapid depolarization that is propagated basipetally along
the sieve tube at a rate of about 2 cm s−1. The unique
structure of the sieve tube with its protoplasmic conti-
nuity through the sieve plates appears to be well suited
for transmission of electrical signals. The appearance of
the action potential is correlated with a rapid uptake of
protons, suggesting that proton ﬂux is responsible for
the depolarization. When the action potential reaches
the pulvinus, it appears to stimulate a rapid unloading of
both K+ and sugars into the apoplast. Water would fol-
low and the resulting loss of turgor would cause collapse
of the motor cells.
Other investigators have found that substances iso-
lated from phloem sap of Mimosa and other species will
stimulate closure of Mimosa pulvini when applied to the
cut end of the stem. The active substance has been iden-
tiﬁed as a glycosylated derivative of gallic acid (4-0-β-d-
gluco-pyranosyl-6′-sulphate)). Called ‘‘turgorin,’’ this
substance has been isolated from 14 higher plants that
exhibit nyctinastic movements. It has been suggested
that turgorin may give rise to action potentials in a
manner similar to the animal neurotransmitter, acetyl-
choline.
SUMMARY
Plant movements serve to orient the plant body in
space. Thus roots exhibit positive gravitropism, grow-
ing down in order to mine the soil for mineral nutrients
and water. Shoots exhibit negative gravitropism and
positive phototropism in order to optimize the inter-
ception of sunlight for photosynthesis.
There are several categories of plant movements.
Growth movements involve cell division and elonga-
tion and are consequently irreversible. Turgor move-
ments involve changes in turgor pressure and cell
volume, and are reversible. Tropisms are direction-
ally related to the stimulus whereas the directionality
of nastic movements is inherent in the tissue and are
not related to any vector in the stimulus. Nutations are
rotary or helical movements that are best observed with
time-lapse photography.

Under natural conditions, phototropism is a
growth response to a light gradient, although in the
laboratory it is usually studied by subjecting organs
to unilateral light. Organs may either grow toward
(positive phototropism) or away from (negative
phototropism) the higher irradiance. Phototropism
is a response to blue and UV-A light; mediated by a
ﬂavoprotein called phototropin, located in the plasma
membrane.
The phototropic response is characterized by dif-
ferential growth on the lighted and shaded sides of the
responding organ. The most generally accepted the-
ory to account for differential growth in coleoptiles
and stems is the Cholodeny-Went theory. This the-
ory proposes a lateral redistribution of auxin as it ﬂows
basipetally from the apex where it is synthesized. In the
case of positive phototropism, the higher concentration
of auxin ﬂows down the shaded side of the organ, caus-
ing cells on the shaded side to elongate more rapidly
than those on the lighted side.
Unlike most stimuli to which plants are exposed,
gravity is omnipresent and nonvarying. There is no
gravitational gradient. Gravity can be sensed only by
movement of cellular structures (statoliths), which
then establishes an asymmetry that is translated in
terms of pressure. Although there is no direct proof,
the weight of evidence indicates that statoliths are the
starch-containing plastids, amyloplasts.
Sensitivity to gravity in the root is localized in
the columella, a group of cells in the central core
of the root cap. The primary transducer that senses
the pressure of the statoliths and initiates the sig-
nal transduction chain remains unknown. Some evi-
dence suggests it might be the endoplasmic reticulum.
Another theory proposes that the sedimenting amy-
loplasts activate stretch-activated ion channels in the
plasma membrane. As in phototropism, the gravit-
ropic response involves differential growth that can
be explained by redistribution of auxin transport. The
steps between pressure sensing and auxin redistribu-
tion are unknown, but experiments indicate that pH
changes, calcium ions, and inositol triphosphate may
all be involved. Ultimately, the signal chain results in
the relocation of auxin transport facilitators of the PIN
family.
Plants exhibit a variety of nastic responses. One
of the most prominent is the periodic movement of
leaves known as sleep movements, or nyctinasty. Leaf
movement is mediated by turgor changes in special-
ized motor cells located in structures called pulvini,
found at the distal end of the petiole. Turgor changes
are mediated by a ﬂux of potassium ion induced by an
interaction between phytochrome, biological clocks,
and the inositol triphosphate system. Another nastic
response is illustrated by seismonasty in the sensi-
tive plant Mimosa. Seismonasty involves similar turgor
changes in response to physical disturbance.

Measuring Time: Controlling
Development by Photoperiod
and Endogenous Clocks
Two hundred and ﬁfty years ago, Carl v. Linn´e, better
known for his development of the binomial system of
nomenclature, designed a ﬂower clock based on the
opening and closing of the petals at speciﬁc but different
times of the day. The plants were arranged in a circle
and one could tell the time of day by simply noting
which ﬂowers were open and which were closed. It is
often difﬁcult for the layman to understand that plants
can tell time without a Timex™, but many aspects of
plant behavior can be interpreted in no other way. One
example is the consistent ﬂowering of various species
at particular times of the year. Roses always bloom in
the summer and chrysanthemums in the fall. Indeed,
the ﬂowering of many plants is so predictable from
one year to the next that gardeners have for centuries
incorporated them into their gardens as ﬂoral calendars,
unerringly marking the progress of the seasons. In the
northern latitudes, perennial plants sense the short days
of autumn as a signal to induce bud dormancy, thus
anticipating the unfavorable conditions of winter. The
most reliable indication of the advancing season is the
length of day, and an organism’s capacity to measure
the proportion of daylength in a 24-hour period is
known as photoperiodism. However, photoperiodism
is only one of the more outward manifestations of a far
more fundamental timekeeping mechanism, known as
the biological clock.

HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVES:
THE DISCOVERY
OF
PHOTOPERIODISM
Although it had earlier been suggested that latitudinal
variations in daylength contributed to plant distribu-
tion, the ﬁrst efforts at controlled experimentation were
conducted by a French scientist in 1912. J. Tournois
found that both Humulus (hops) and Cannabis (hemp)
plants ﬂowered precociously during the winter in the
greenhouse. Tournois eliminated temperature, humid-
ity, and light intensity as environmental cues and in
1914 concluded that the changing of either daylength or
nightlength was responsible for early ﬂowering. Unfor-
tunately, World War I intervened and Tournois did
not live to continue his experiments. At the same time,
H. Klebs was studying ﬂowering of Sempervivum funkii
(commonly known as ‘‘hens-and-chickens’’). Semper-
vivum grows as a vegetative rosette in the winter
greenhouse. By supplementing normal daylight with
artiﬁcial light, Klebs was able to break the rosette habit,
stimulate stem elongation, and induce ﬂowering. From
his experiments, Klebs concluded that length of day
triggered ﬂowering in nature. However, it remained for
W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard to demonstrate the
full impact of daylength on ﬂowering and coin the term
photoperiodism.
W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard were scientists with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture near Washington,
D.C. The initial focus of their work was a mutant
cultivar of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), called Maryland
Mammoth. In the ﬁeld, Maryland Mammoth plants
grew to be very tall with large leaves. Such characteristics
would obviously be advantageous to the tobacco industry
at the time (in the early 1920s), but breeding efforts
were frustrated by the fact that the plants would not
ﬂower in the ﬁeld during the normal growing season
at that latitude. In the greenhouse, however, even very
small plants ﬂowered in the winter and early spring.
Clearly, ﬂowering was not simply a matter of the age of
the plants. Another problem of interest to Garner and
Allard concerned ﬂowering in soybean (Glycine max).
When the cultivar Biloxi was sown over a 3-month
period from May to August, all of the plants ﬂowered
within a 3-week period in September (Figure 24.1).
The earliest seeded plants thus took 125 days to ﬂower
while those seeded last required only 58 days. Again it
appeared that all plants, regardless of age, were simply
awaiting some signal to initiate ﬂowering.
Like Tournois, Garner and Allard eliminated a
variety of environmental conditions (such as nutrition,
temperature, and light intensity) as the ‘‘signal,’’ com-
ing ﬁnally (and with some reluctance) to the conclusion
that ﬂowering was controlled by the relative length of
day and night. Using a crude but effective system of
rolling plant benches in and out of darkened garagelike
buildings at predetermined times, Garner and Allard
proceeded to describe the ﬂowering characteristics of
scores of different species with respect to daylength.
They went on to suggest that bird migration might
also be keyed to daylength—a phenomenon that is now
well documented. We now know that photoperiodic
control is not limited to ﬂowering, but is a basic regu-
latory component in many aspects of plant and animal
behavior.

24.1 PHOTOPERIODISM
The switch from the vegetative state to the ﬂowering
state is arguably one of the most dramatic and mysterious
events in the life of a ﬂowering plant. Photoperiodism
inﬂuences many aspects of plant development such
as tuber development, leaf fall, and dormancy, but the
control of ﬂowering by photoperiod has attracted the
major share of interest. Indeed, it was the failure of a
tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum) mutant to ﬂower under ﬁeld
conditions that led to the discovery of photoperiodism
(Box 24.1).

24.1 Photoperiodism

24.1.1 PHOTOPERIODIC RESPONSES
MAY BE CHARACTERIZED BY A
VARIETY OF RESPONSE TYPES
Photoperiodic responses fall into one of three general
categories. They are: short-day plants (SD plants),
long-day plants (LD plants), and daylength-indifferent
or
day-neutral
plants
(DNP)
(Table
24.1
and
Figure 24.2). Short-day plants are those that ﬂower
only, or ﬂower earlier, in response to daylengths
that are shorter than a certain value within a 24-hour
cycle. Long-day plants respond to daylengths that are
longer than a certain value, while day-neutral plants
ﬂower irrespective of daylength. Within the long- and
short-day categories, we also recognize obligate and
facultative requirements.1 Plants that have an absolute
requirement for a particular photoperiod before they
will ﬂower are considered obligate photoperiodic types.
The common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), for
example, is an obligate short-day plant. Xanthium will
not ﬂower unless it receives an appropriate short
photoperiod. On the other hand, most spring cereals
such as wheat (Triticum sp.) and rye (Secale cereale) are
facultative long-day plants. Although spring cereals will
eventually ﬂower even if maintained under continuous
short days, ﬂowering is dramatically accelerated under
long days. The popular research object Arabidopsis
is also a facultative long day plant. However, the
distinction between obligate and facultative response
is not always hard and fast for a particular species or
cultivar. Photoperiod requirement is often modiﬁed by
external conditions such as temperature. A particular
species may, for example, have an obligate requirement
at one temperature but respond as a facultative plant at
another temperature.
In addition to these three basic categories, there
are a number of other response types that ﬂower
under some combination of long and short days. Var-
ious species of the genus Bryophyllum are, for example,
long-short-day plants (LSD plant)—they will ﬂower
only if a certain number of short days are preceded
by a certain number of long days. The reverse is true
of the short-long-day plant (SLD plant) Trifolium
repens (white clover). A few plants have highly special-
ized requirements. Intermediate-daylength plants, for
example, ﬂower only in response to daylengths of inter-
mediate length but remain vegetative when the day is
either too long or too short. Another type of behavior
is amphophotoperiodism, illustrated by Madia elegans
(tarweed). In this case, ﬂowering is delayed under inter-
mediate daylength (12 to 14 hours) but occurs rapidly
under daylengths of 8 hours or 18 hours. There are
many, often subtle, variations to the three basic response
1The terms obligate and facultative may be interchanged with
the terms qualitative and quantitative, repectively.

It is important to understand that the distinction
between SD plant and LD plant is not based on the
absolute length of day. Consider, for example, that both
Xanthium and Hyoscyamus niger (black henbane) will
ﬂower with 12 to 13 hours of light per day (Figure 24.3).
Yet the former is properly classiﬁed as a SD plant and
the latter as a LD plant. Whether a plant is classiﬁed

as a SD plant or LD plant depends instead on its
behavior relative to a critical daylength. Plants that
ﬂower when the daylength is shorter than some critical
maximum are classiﬁed as SD plant. Those that ﬂower
in response to daylengths longer than a critical minimum
are classiﬁed as LD plant. Thus the critical daylength
for the SD plant Xanthium is 15.5 hours, meaning that
it will ﬂower whenever the daylength is less than 15.5
hours out of every 24. The critical daylength for the
LD plant Hyoscyamus is 11 hours and it will ﬂower
when the daylength exceeds that value. In the absence of
further information, the actual daylength under which
a plant will ﬂower is no indication of its response type.
A corollary to this observation is that, although SD
plants tend to ﬂower in the spring and fall and LD
plants tend to ﬂower in midsummer, the classiﬁcation as
a SD plant or LD plant is not necessarily an indication
of the time of year that species will ﬂower.
Many plants require more or less continuous expo-
sure to the appropriate photoperiod, at least until ﬂoral
primordia have been developed, in order to ﬂower suc-
cessfully. Others will proceed to ﬂower even if, once
exposed to even a single proper photoperiod, the plant
is returned to unfavorable photoperiods. Such plants
are said to be induced and the appropriate photope-
riod is referred to as an inductive treatment. The
phenomenon of induction raises intriguing, though
unresolved, questions about the physiological properties
of the induced state. Clearly a physiological change has
taken place in induced plants and this change persists,
even though no anatomical or morphological change is
evident at the apex where ﬂowers will appear.
Induction can also be experimentally useful. One
of the reasons Xanthium has been so widely used for
studies of photoperiodism is that a single short-day
cycle will irreversibly lead to ﬂowering, even in plants
that are returned to long days. Such an extreme sensi-
tivity to induction is not widespread, but it has been
demonstrated in other SD plants such as Japanese
morning glory (Pharbitis nil), duckweed (Lemna pur-
pusilla), and lambs quarters (Chenopodium rubrum), and
in the LD plants dill (Anethum graveolens) and rye grass
(Lolium temulentum).
Induction is not an all-or-none process, but can be
achieved in degrees. Although Xanthium will respond to
a single inductive cycle, the initiation of ﬂoral primordia
is more rapid and more proliﬁc if multiple cycles are
given. Other plants may exhibit fractional induction—a
summation of inductive photoperiods despite inter-
ruption with noninductive cycles. Plantago lanceolata
(plantain), for example, normally requires a threshold
of about 25 long days to induce ﬂowering. Plants given
only 10 long days will remain vegetative, but a schedule
of 10 long days followed by 10 short days and then
another 15 long days will induce ﬂowering. The plants
are apparently able to sum the long days in spite of the
intervening short days. Examples of summation with
up to 30 intervening noninductive periods have been
reported.
24.1.3 PLANTS ACTUALLY MEASURE
THE LENGTH OF THE DARK
PERIOD
In their original publications, Garner and Allard sug-
gested that plants responded to the relative lengths
of day and night and coined the term photoperiodism,
which combines the Greek roots for light and dura-
tion. Photoperiodism turns out to be a misleading
term, however, because it implies that plants mea-
sure the duration of daylight. In fact, plants measure
neither the relative length of day and night nor the
length of the photoperiod—they measure the length
of the dark period. This was elegantly demonstrated
by the experiments of K. C. Hamner and J. Bonner
in 1938 (Figure 24.4). Under 24-hour cycles of light
and dark, Xanthium ﬂowered with dark periods longer
than 8.5 hours but remained vegetative on schedules of

16 hours light and 8 hours darkness (Figure 24.4A,B).
On schedules of 4 hours light and 8 hours darkness,
plants remained vegetative even though the 4-hour
photoperiod is much shorter than the 15.5-hour critical
photoperiod (Figure 24.4C). On the other hand, sched-
ules of 16 hours light and 32 hours darkness induced
rapid ﬂowering even though the photoperiod exceeded
the critical daylength (Figure 24.4D).
The results of the Hamner and Bonner experiment
allow two conclusions. First, the relative length of day
and night is not the determining factor in photoperi-
odism, because the ratio of light to dark is the same in
schedules B, C, and D (Figure 24.4) but with different
results. Second, it is the length of the dark period that is
important. The consistent feature within the experiment
is that Xanthium will ﬂower whenever the dark period
exceeds 8.5 hours and will remain vegetative whenever
the dark period is less than 8.5 hours. The critical role of
the dark period was conﬁrmed by interrupting the dark
period with brief light exposures (Figure 24.4 E–H).
The ﬂowering effect of an inductive 9-hour dark period
can be nulliﬁed by interrupting the dark period with a
brief light-break (Figure 24.4G), but a ‘‘dark interrup-
tion’’ of a long light period has no effect (Figure 24.4H).
Experiments with LD plants give similar results; LD
plants require a dark period shorter than some critical
maximum. With LD plants, a light-break in the mid-
dle of an otherwise noninductive long dark period will
shorten the dark period to less than the maximum and
permit ﬂowering to occur. At this point it is clear that
photoperiodism has relatively little to do with daylength
per se. It is instead a response to the duration and timing
of light and dark periods. Thus, the critical daylength
for a SD plant actually represents the maximum length
of day in a normal 24-hour regime that will allow a dark
period of sufﬁcient length. In the case of LD plants, long
dark periods are inhibitory and the critical daylength is
the minimum in a 24-hour regime that will keep the
dark period short enough to allow ﬂowering.
The ﬂuence given during a light-break need not be
very high to be effective. As little as one minute of incan-
descent light at a low ﬂuence will prevent ﬂowering in
Xanthium. Even bright moonlight is sufﬁcient to delay
ﬂowering in some SD plants. This raises an interesting
possible relationship between nyctinastic leaf move-
ments, discussed in the previous chapter, and control
of ﬂowering. It is possible, at least in some cases, that
nyctinastic leaf movements could serve to reorient the
leaves parallel to incident moonlight and thus reduce the
impact of moonlight on the time-sensing mechanism.
24.1.4 PHYTOCHROME AND
CRYPTOCHROME ARE THE
PHOTORECEPTORS FOR
PHOTOPERIODISM
Photoperiodism is a response to the length of a dark
period, but the length of a dark period is deﬁned by
the interval between photoperiods. In other words, the
length of a dark period is determined by the timing of
light-off and light-on signals. In the case of a SD plant
such as Xanthium, a light-break given in the middle
of an otherwise inductive long dark period, as shown
earlier in Figure 24.4, may be construed as a premature
light-on signal that interferes with the timing process.
Light-breaks are useful because they are effective with
short exposures of low-ﬂuence-rate light and can be
applied to a single induced leaf. The light-break thus
provides an opportunity to explore the nature of the
pigment involved in photoperiodism by determining an
action spectrum.
Early action spectra on several SD plants in the late
1940s indicated that red light was most effective as a
light-break, with a maximum effectiveness near 660 nm.
Then, at the same time that photoreversibility of seed
germination was demonstrated, H. A. Borthwick and
his colleagues also reported that red light inhibition of
ﬂowering in Xanthium was reversible with far-red. Later,
similar results were demonstrated for other SD plants.
Red, far-red photoreversibility of the light-break clearly
implicates phytochrome in the photoperiodic timing
process. The situation with LD plants, however, is not
as clear. A light-break with red light in the middle of
an otherwise noninductive long night should promote
ﬂowering. It does in Hyoscyamus and some others, but

24.1 Photoperiodism
419
many LD plants are not sensitive to light-breaks and
some are inhibited by red light. The role of phytochrome
is far from clear at this point, but based on recent work
with phytochrome mutants in Arabidopsis, it has been
suggested that phyA is required to promote ﬂowering of
an LDP under certain conditions. PhyB, on the other
hand, seems to inhibit ﬂowering.
Blue light is also effective in controlling photope-
riod. In Arabidopsis, for example, blue light is effective
at promoting ﬂowering when applied in a light-break
experiment, suggesting that cryptochromes are involved
as well. It is not yet clear what role cry1 may have in
photoperiodic control of ﬂowering. On the other hand,
cry2 is known to promote ﬂowering, but is believed to
interact directly with the biological clock. More will be
said about the role of cry2 later in this chapter, when we
turn our attention to the biological clock.
24.1.5 THE PHOTOPERIODIC SIGNAL IS
PERCEIVED BY THE LEAVES
The actual change from the vegetative to reproductive
growth occurs, of course, in apical meristems—usually
beginning at the shoot apex and appearing later in
the axillary buds. Contrary to expectations, however,
the photoperiodic signal is perceived not by the stem
apex but by the leaves. This has been demonstrated
in a variety of ways. Some of the earliest experiments

were conducted by a Russian plant physiologist M.
Chailakhyan. He reported ﬂowering in Chrysanthemum
morifolium, a SD plant, in which the apical, defoliated
portion was kept on long days but the leafy portion
was subjected to short days. When conditions were
reversed, with the upper, defoliated portion kept on
short days and the leafy portion on long days, the plants
remained vegetative (Figure 24.5). Although the plants
in this experiment still contained axillary buds, ﬂowering
has been successfully induced in plants from which the
axillary buds have been removed. In later experiments
it was shown that plants such as Perilla and Xanthium
stripped of all but one leaf could be induced to ﬂower
if the remaining leaf were provided the appropriate
photoperiod. Leaves may also be removed from induced
plants and grafted to noninduced receptors where they
will induce a ﬂowering response. Finally, leaves need
not even be attached to the plant in order to be induced.
When excised leaves of Perilla (SD plant) were exposed
to short days and grafted back to noninduced plants, the
plants ﬂowered even when maintained under long days.
The sensitivity of the leaf may vary with age.
In Chrysanthemum, Perilla, and soybean (Glycine), the
youngest fully expanded leaf was found to be most sen-
sitive. In experiments with Xanthium in which the plants
are stripped of all but the most sensitive leaf, it has been
shown that peak sensitivity is reached during the period
of most rapid expansion, when the leaf is about half its

420
Chapter 24 / Measuring Time: Controlling Development by Photoperiod and Endogenous Clocks
ﬁnal size. These observations lead to two conclusions:
ﬁrst, that the leaf is independently responsible for per-
ceiving the phototropic signal, and second, that the leaf
initiates a signal chain, probably involving a diffusible
ﬂoral stimulus, that communicates this information to
the shoot apical meristem. Grafting experiments were
also used to estimate velocity of movement of the stimu-
lus, which for most species was found to be in the range
of about 2.5 to 3.5 mm hr−1.
24.1.6 CONTROL OF FLOWERING BY
PHOTOPERIOD REQUIRES A
TRANSMISSIBLE SIGNAL
The spatial separation between the site of perception
of the photoperiodic signal (the leaves) and the site of
ﬂowering (the shoot apical meristem) logically requires
a transmissible signal that carries the information from
the leaf to the shoot apex. Over the past 70 years, several
hypotheses have been advanced in order to explain the
transmission of a ﬂoral stimulus, but the most persistent
has been the hypothesis of a ﬂoral hormone.
Russian plant physiologist M. Chailakhyan was the
ﬁrst to suggest, in 1936, that the ﬂoral stimulus might be
a hormone, which he proposed be called ﬂorigen. The
concept of a ﬂowering hormone was based primarily
on the fact that the stimulus was transmissible across
a graft union. For example, when several Xanthium
plants are approach-grafted in sequence, all can be
brought to ﬂower if only the ﬁrst is induced by short
days (Figure 24.6). Members of the same family, such
as the SD plant tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum) and the LD
plant black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), both in the fam-
ily Solanaceae, can be grafted with relative ease. In such
a partnership, Hyoscyamus will ﬂower under short days if
the tobacco is also maintained under short days, but not
if the tobacco is maintained under long days. Conversely,
tobacco will ﬂower under long days when grafted to
Hyoscyamus maintained under long days. A number
of successful interspeciﬁc and intergeneric grafts have
yielded similar results. These results have led to the con-
clusion that the ﬁnal product of photoperiodic induction
appears to be physiologically equivalent in plants of dif-
ferent photoperiodic classes and is probably identical to
the constitutive ﬂoral stimulus in day-neutral plants.
Given the universal nature of other plant hormones,
it should not be too surprising that the same ﬂoral stim-
ulus operates in all photoperiodic classes. The major
unanswered question that remains, however, is with
regard to the chemical identity of the ﬂorigen. One
approach toward answering this question is to prepare
from ﬂowering plants an extract that will evoke ﬂower-
ing in noninduced plants. Subsequent fractionation of
the extract should lead to identiﬁcation of the active sub-
stance. Unfortunately, although several attempts have
been made, they have met with limited success. In one

mitted from the single induced leaf through all of the
plants.
of the most successful attempts to date, a methanol
extract from freeze-dried Xanthium plants evoked a
weak ﬂowering response when applied to leaves of other
Xanthium plants kept under long days. Unfortunately,
few other attempts have been successful and none has
been consistently repeated.
Of the several classes of plant hormones, only
gibberellins have been shown consistently to evoke ﬂow-
ering in a wide variety of species. Repeated applications
of dilute gibberellin solutions (containing principally
GA3) to the apex of annual Hyoscyamus, Samolus parv-
iﬂorus, and Silene armeria (all LD plants) elicited a
ﬂowering response under short days. Does this mean
that gibberellin is equivalent to ﬂorigen? The answer to
this question is clearly negative. To begin with, evoca-
tion of ﬂowering in response to gibberellin application
is almost entirely restricted to LD plants that normally
grow as rosettes under short days. This includes annual
LD plants and biennial species that require an overwin-
tering cold treatment before ﬂowering as LD plants (see
Chapter 25). For example, carrot (Daucus carota), Chi-
nese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis), and biennial strains of
black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) all grow as rosettes
and remain vegetative during the ﬁrst growing season.
The meristems are then subjected to an over winter-
ing cold treatment. The following spring, the stems
undergo rapid internode elongation and the plants will
ﬂower in response to long days. In the absence of any
cold treatment but under long days, exogenously applied
gibberellin will stimulate stem elongation and ﬂower-
ing. It thus appears that gibberellin will substitute for
the cold requirement of biennial species or the long-day
requirement of annual LD plants. But gibberellin will
not evoke ﬂowering in most SD plants (such as Xanthium
or Biloxi soybean) kept under long days.

24.1 Photoperiodism
421
Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis, a fac-
ultative long-day plant, have recently cast a different
light on the nature of ﬂorigen. A number of experi-
ments conducted over the last decade have indicated a
prominent role for the gene CONSTANS (CO). It was
ﬁrst observed that plants carrying mutant alleles of CO
ﬂower late under long days, but ﬂower normally under
noninductive short days. It was also found that CO
mRNA accumulated in leaves under long days as well
as in vegetative meristems and leaf initials. However,
in spite of these and other observations, it was not
clear whether CO stimulated ﬂowering by acting in
the leaves where the photoperiod signal is perceived
or in the meristem where ﬂowering occurs. The key
proved to be experiments with transgenic Arabidopsis
plants in which the CO gene was linked to a pro-
moter from melon (Cucumis melo)—a promoter that
is active only in the phloem companion cells in the
minor veins of mature leaves. The transgenic plants
expressing the CO gene ﬂowered early under nonin-
ductive short-day conditions. Early ﬂowering was also
observed in transgenic co mutant plants that were engi-
neered to constitutively express the CO gene. Finally, it
was demonstrated that when scions homozygous for the
co mutation were grafted to CO-expressing stock, early
ﬂowering was observed in the scions. Other experiments
designed to test this idea have provided no evidence that
CO itself is translocated out of the leaf cells These
results strongly indicate that the CO gene participates in
generating a phloem-mobile transmissible ﬂoral signal.
A likely candidate for the mobile ﬂoral signal
is FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a small protein
(ca. 20 kD) that is known to promote ﬂowering in a
dosage-dependent manner. The CO gene encodes a
transcription factor that induces the expression of FT
mRNA in leaves. The presence of RNA and peptides in
phloem sap is well documented and in a recent study of
Brassica napus, FT was one of 140 proteins identiﬁed in
the phloem sap. According to one current model, CO
responds to an inductive photoperiod by activating FT
mRNA transcription and FT protein synthesis in leaf
phloem parenchyma cells (Figure 24.7). The FT protein
then moves through the phloem sieve tube elements to
the shoot apical meristem where it induces a group of
gene known as ﬂoral meristem identity genes. The
role of ﬂoral identity genes will be discussed further in
Chapter 25.

scription factors to induce the transcription of ﬂowering
genes.
function of the pre-dark light requirement is not clear
since the requirements vary markedly depending on the
species and conditions of the experiment. For maximum
ﬂowering with a single inductive dark period, Xanthium
requires 8 to 12 hours of light. Pharbitis requires at
least 6 hours. In others such as Kalanchoe, a few seconds
of light per day were sufﬁcient to induce ﬂowering.
Where longer light periods are necessary, it may be
because photosynthetic products are required for the
processes initiated in the dark period. Where very brief
periods of light are effective, clearly photosynthesis
cannot be involved and some other explanation for the
light requirement must be sought.
In many cases it has been demonstrated that
high-ﬂuence light following the inductive dark period
is also important. Again the experimental details are
sketchy and the requirements seem to vary, but two
explanations have been offered. One possibility is that
the postinductive light period provides a stream of
photosynthate that enhances translocation of the ﬂoral
stimulus out of the leaf. However, some of the results
are not readily explained as translocation effects. There
is also evidence suggesting that the ﬂoral stimulus is
subject to destruction or inactivation in the leaf if the
dark period is too long. Consequently, it has been
suggested that light may be required to stabilize or
prevent inactivation of the ﬂoral stimulus in the leaf.

HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVES:
THE BIOLOGICAL
CLOCK
The possibility that an internal, or endogenous, time-
keeper might be involved was ﬁrst raised by the French
astronomer M. De Mairan in 1729. De Mairan found
that leaf movements in the sensitive plant (Mimosa) per-
sisted even when the plants were placed in darkness for
several days. Subsequently studies by J. G. Zinn (in 1759)
and A. P. De Candolle (in 1825) conﬁrmed DeMairan’s
ﬁndings (see Sweeny, 1987). Curiously, DeCandolle
found that under continuous light the time between
maximum opening of the leaves was closer to 22 or 23
hours rather than the 24 hours under natural conditions.
It would be a full century before the signiﬁcance of this
ﬁnding was fully appreciated!
The study of leaf movements continued to interest
botanists and plant physiologists through the latter half
of the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries.
Much of the work simply conﬁrmed the widespread
occurrence of leaf movements and that they persisted
under either continuous light or continuous darkness.
In 1863, J. Sachs reported no correlation between leaf
movements and temperature ﬂuctuations, thus elimi-
nating temperature as a cause. One difﬁculty, from an
experimental perspective, was that studies of periodic
phenomena required around-the-clock monitoring. In
1875, W. Pfeffer devised an apparatus for automatic and
continuous recording of leaf position. Pfeffer attached
the leaf, via a ﬁne thread, to a stylus, which in turn
recorded the position of the leaf on a rotating drum
coated with carbon (lampblack). With some improve-
ments, the same apparatus is occasionally used even
today (Figure 24.8).
Over a period of 40 years, from 1875 to 1915, Pfeffer
contributed several papers devoted to leaf movements
in Phaseolus vulgaris, the common garden bean. At one
point, he showed that plants that had lost their rhythmic
leaf movements (as they will under prolonged continu-
ous light or darkness) will regain them if exposed to a
new light–dark cycle. If the new cycle is inverted with
respect to natural day and night, leaf movement will
also be reversed. Pfeffer concluded that persistent leaf
movements under continuous light or darkness were a
‘‘learned’’ behavior. Others showed that regardless of
any previous light–dark cycle, under continuous illumi-
nation sleep movements clearly reverted to a 24-hour
oscillation. In the end, Pfeffer was forced to conclude
that leaf movements were an endogenous, and probably
inherited, behavior.

FIGURE 24.8 A diagram illustrating the principle of the
drum recording apparatus used by B ¨unning and oth-
ers for recording leaf movements. The recording stylus
(S) is attached to a ﬁnely balanced lever (L), which is in
turn tied to the midvein of the leaf. As the leaf
changes position, the stylus describes a tracing on the
rotating drum.
During the 1920s, improvements in the technol-
ogy for maintaining constant environments, especially
with respect to light and temperature, set the stage for
signiﬁcant advances in understanding leaf movements.
One key observation was made by Rose Stoppel in
Germany. Maintaining bean plants in a dark room at
constant temperature, Stoppel observed that maximum
night position of the leaves (i.e., near vertical orienta-
tion) occurred at the same time (between 3:00 and 4:00
A.M.) every day, exactly 24 hours apart. She reasoned that
an endogenous, biological timer could be that accurate
only if some environmental factor acted to, in effect,
reset the clock on a daily basis. Stoppel referred to this
factor as factor X.
The endogenous nature of the biological clock
ﬁnally became evident through the work of two young
botanists who had been given the task of determin-
ing whether subtle atmospheric factors might inﬂuence
plants. E. B¨unning and K. Stern became interested in
Stoppel’s factor X and, in order to achieve satisfactory
constant temperature conditions, set up their bean plants
and recording devices in Stern’s potato cellar. Like
Stoppel, B¨unning and Stern found that the maximum
night position came every 24 hours, but, surprisingly,
some 7 to 8 hours later than in Stoppel’s experiments!
B¨unning and Stern quickly recognized that the key was
the very weak red light used when watering the plants
and tending the recording equipment. Stoppel visited
her experiments early in the morning while B¨unning and
Stern, because Stern’s potato cellar was some distance

from the laboratory, made their visits in the late after-
noon. Interestingly, at that time the textbook dogma
was that red light had no effect on plant morphogene-
sis. B¨unning and Stern concluded that the dogma was
wrong—even weak red light apparently synchronized
leaf movement so that the maximum night position
always occurred about 16 hours later. Indeed, when the
red light was eliminated, the period between maximum
night positions was no longer 24 hours but 25.4 hours
(Figure 24.9). B¨unning and Stern had identiﬁed factor
X and lay the groundwork for the eventual discovery of
the role of phytochrome in circadian rhythms.
Actually, most of the data ﬁt a combination of these two
ideas and the effect of the postinduction light require-
ment may be to quickly move the stimulus, such as FT
protein, away from a site of inactivation in the leaf.
24.2 THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK
Photoperiodism is inextricably linked to an internal
time-measuring system known as the endogenous bio-
logical clock (Box 24.2). Another long-observed and
dramatic manifestation of the biological clock is the diur-
nal rise and fall of leaves (known as nyctinastic, or sleep,
movements) (Figure 24.10 and Chapter 23). Superﬁ-
cially, nyctinastic movements appear to be subject to
external, or exogenous, control—namely the daily pat-
tern of light and dark periods. However, under the right
circumstances, it can be shown that the oscillations in
leaf position are independent of external factors. On
the other hand, photosynthetic carbon uptake describes
a periodicity because it is light-driven and daylight is
periodic over time. Photosynthesis is thus diurnal. It
is active only during daylight hours and thus mirrors the
daily light-dark cycle.
There are three criteria that serve to distinguish
between simple diurnal phenomena and rhythms driven
by an endogenous clock. (1) A clock-driven rhythm
persists under constant conditions (that is, in the absence
of external cues). (2) A clock-driven rhythm can be
‘‘reset’’ by external signals, such as light or temperature.
(3) There is no lasting effect of temperature on the
timing of the clock-driven rhythm. These three criteria
will be addressed in turn.
24.2.1 CLOCK-DRIVEN RHYTHMS
PERSIST UNDER CONSTANT
CONDITIONS
The key to an endogenous rhythm is that it persists,
for at least several cycles, under constant conditions
(usually constant light or constant darkness). The rhyth-
micity expressed under constant conditions is described
as free-running. The time required to complete a cycle
is referred to as the period (τ; tau) (Figure 24.11A).
Period is conveniently described as the time from peak
to peak, but it applies equally well to any two compara-
ble points in the repeating cycle. Biological rhythms are
traditionally classiﬁed according to the length of their
free-running period. Thus a circadian rhythm has a
period of approximately 24 hours (circa, about + diem,
day). Bean leaf movement is a circadian rhythm because
its free-running period length is about 25.4 hours.
A period of about 28 days, the time between one full
moon and the next, describes a lunar rhythm and a

period of one year is an annual rhythm. Also of interest
are rhythms in metabolic activity with periods substan-
tially less than 24 hours (measured in minutes or hours).
These are known as ultradian rhythms.
The difference between the maximum and mini-
mum, or peak and trough, of a rhythm is known as
the amplitude (A) (Figure 24.11A). The amplitude of a
free-running circadian rhythm usually diminishes with
time until it eventually disappears altogether. In some
cases this is probably due to declining energy reserves
in prolonged darkness since the amplitude can be main-
tained, at least for a while, by feeding sucrose. More
often, however, the clock seems to run down and an
external signal is required to start up the rhythm again.
The term phase has two slightly different but related
usages. Any point of the cycle that can be identiﬁed by
its relationship to the rest of the cycle can be consid-
ered a phase. The position of the peak (maximum night
position of leaves, maximum ﬂowering, etc.) is the most
common reference point for phase relationships because
it is usually most readily identiﬁed. In Figure 24.11A,
for example, the two rhythms are displayed out of phase
by approximately 6 hours. Phase may also be used to
describe an arbitrary part of the cycle, such as night
phase or day phase.
Discussions of endogenous circadian rhythms are
sometimes complicated by the fact that two time frames
are involved: solar time and circadian time (CT).
Solar time is an external time, based on a normal
24-hour day. Circadian time, on the other hand, is an
internal time and is based on the free-running period.
One cycle is considered to be 24 hours long, regardless
of its actual length in solar time. Each hour of circadian
time is therefore 1/24 of the free-running period. Thus
if the free-running period is 30 hours, events that occur
at 0, 15, and 30 hours of darkness will have occurred at
circadian times CT:0, CT:12, and CT:24, respectively.
The circadian time scale is useful in assessing phase

24.2 The Biological Clock

relationships within experiments or between rhythms
with different periods. Finally, the phase of the
free-running cycle that corresponds to day in a normal
light–dark environment is known as subjective day
and that which corresponds to normal night is the
subjective night. In the case of sleep movements in
bean, for example, the phase of the free-running cycle
during which the leaves are in the horizontal position
would be considered the subjective day. The phase
during which the leaves are in the vertical position
would be subjective night.
The rhythmic movements of bean leaves are nor-
mally coupled, or synchronized, to the solar day–night
cycle (Figure 24.11B). The same coupling was evident
in both Stoppel’s and B¨unning’s experiments when the
rhythm was coupled to the red light signal (Box 24.2).
Such a coupling of a circadian rhythm to a regular exter-
nal environmental signal is known as entrainment. The
signal that synchronizes or entrains the rhythms is often
referred to as a zeitgeber (Ger. zeit, time + geben, to
give).
A large number of circadian rhythms have now been
described in a wide range of organisms. The list includes
single-celled ﬂagellates, algae, fungi, crustacea, insects,
birds, and mammals (including humans), in addition
to ﬂowering plants. A full list of known rhythms in
ﬂowering plants alone would cover several pages. An
abbreviated list is provided in Table 24.2. A more exten-
sive list, with references, is provided by Sweeny (1987).
24.2.2 LIGHT RESETS THE BIOLOGICAL
CLOCK ON A DAILY BASIS
The action of the biological clock or endogenous
rhythms is to ensure that certain functions occur at a
particular time of day. For example, the oscillations of
the clock in beans determines that the leaves rise during
the day and fall at night. The period of the endogenous
rhythm is ﬁxed, but it may be ‘‘fast’’ or ‘‘slow’’ relative
to the 24-hour solar period. Moreover, the daily
duration of light and dark within the 24-hour solar

period changes steadily throughout the season. How
does the organism reconcile a nonvarying endogenous
periodicity with these daily and seasonal changes in
daylight? How are these rhythms kept in phase? To
answer this question, we go back to the concept of
entrainment. Entrainment is, in effect, a means for
moving the oscillations of the clock forward or back in
time on a daily basis, just as you might reset the time of
an alarm clock every night before retiring. Entrainment
is also useful to the experimentalist because it is the
one signiﬁcant way in which circadian rhythms can be
manipulated in the laboratory.
Entrainment is not limited to solar periodicity.
Within limits, rhythms can be entrained to light–dark
cycles either shorter (18 to 20 hours) or longer (up
to 30 hours or more) than 24 hours. Entrainment to
extremely short or long cycles is rare. More useful infor-
mation, however, can be obtained by studying whether
the rhythm is moved forward or back in time and by
how much. The experiment normally entails giving
brief light pulses (usually 1 hour or less) at various times
during an established free-running rhythm in constant
darkness. The timing of the next peak is then compared
with controls that have not been given a light pulse. For
example, when populations of Chenopodium seedlings
are exposed to single dark periods of various lengths,
their capacity to ﬂower ﬂuctuates rhythmically for at
least three cycles (Figure 24.12). In this case, a common
light-off signal sets the rhythm in motion and the timing
of the light-on signal (i.e., the length of the dark period)
determines whether the plants will ﬂower. If, however,
relatively brief pulses of light are given at various times
during the dark period, the pulses will reset the clock
or shift the phase of the rhythm. The result is a phase
response curve such as that shown in Figure 24.13.
This curve demonstrates that a light pulse given early
in the subjective night causes a delay of the ﬁrst and
subsequent peaks relative to the control. Somewhere
near the middle of the subjective night there is a phase
jump such that pulses given in the latter half of the
subjective might cause subsequent peaks to be advanced
relative to the controls. Note that light pulses given
during the subjective day have very little effect on phase
relationships. Similar phase response curves have been
demonstrated for a variety of circadian rhythms and help
to explain entrainment. It seems to be a character of the
system that re-phasing is accomplished in such a way as
to require the least net displacement of the rhythm. Thus,
during the early part of the subjective night, the light
pulse is apparently interpreted as a delayed light-off, or
dusk, signal and the phase of the endogenous rhythm
is adjusted accordingly. As the pulse arrives later, the
delay is increased until at some point the pulse is now
interpreted as an early light-on, or dawn, signal. This
causes the rhythm to be advanced. Phase-shifting in this
way constantly adjusts or entrains the rhythm to local

cated. The free-running periodicity (τ) is approximately

seedlings are depleting their carbon supply over the
extended dark period. Amplitude can be maintained by
supplying the seedlings with glucose. (From King, R. W.

solar time. The observation that similar phase response
curves can be described for such different phenomena as
insect pupal eclosion, bioluminescence in the dinoﬂag-
ellate Gonyaulax, and CO2 evolution and ﬂowering in
higher plants indicates similar properties, if not mech-
anisms, for the circadian clock in a variety of different
organisms.
Although light plays an obvious role in resetting
circadian rhythms, the photoreceptor involved is clearly
not the same in all cases. Action spectra for resetting
rhythms in Gonyaulax, the protozoan Paramecium, fungi,
and insects all share a large peak in the blue region of
the spectrum, suggesting that a ﬂavoprotein blue-light
receptor such as cry2 might be involved. In higher plants,
however, both phytochromes and cryptochromes appear
to be involved. For example, establishment of rhythms
in dark-grown bean plants and phase-setting of leaf
movement in Samanea both show a classic phytochrome
photoreversibility with brief red and far-red light treat-
ments. Others, however, such as the CO2-evolution
rhythm in Bryophyllum leaves, can be reset with red light
but the effect is not reversible with far-red. The effect of
far-red light in the Bryophyllum system is to abolish the
rhythm altogether! This might also be a phytochrome
effect, but these and other experiments make it clear that

photocontrol of phase-setting is not a straightforward
process.
24.2.3 THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS
TEMPERATURE-COMPENSATED
Most chemical reactions, and thus growth and other
biological responses, respond to temperature with a Q10
near 2. This means that a 10◦C increase in tempera-
ture will approximately double the rate of the process.
A decrease in temperature leads to a decrease in the rate
by the same amount. While such temperature sensitivity
may be advantageous to the organism in some cases, the
accuracy of a biological clock would be severely compro-
mised if it were sensitive to often-random temperature
ﬂuctuations brought about by local environments. As
it turns out, the period length of circadian rhythms is
relatively insensitive to temperature. A classic example
is again bean leaf movement. When seedlings are raised
in the dark from seed, leaf movements tend to be small
and unsynchronized. A single ﬂash of light (the zeitgeber)
initiates larger, synchronized movements.
In B¨unning’s experiments, the synchronized move-
ments had a periodicity of 28.3 hours at a constant
15◦C and 28 hours at 25◦C. Although these data would

24.2 The Biological Clock
427
seem to suggest that the circadian rhythm is insen-
sitive to temperature, this is not strictly true. When
seedlings were shifted from 20◦C to 15◦C, the initial
period was 29.7 hours. Seedlings shifted from 20◦C to
25◦C had a period of 23.7 hours. These periods, how-
ever, lasted only for the ﬁrst cycle or two—later cycles
returned to periods of approximately 28 hours. Clearly
the circadian rhythm is temperature-sensitive, but some
mechanism quickly compensates for variations in tem-
perature. Consequently, the Q10 for most circadian
rhythms is near 1. Amplitude may be affected by tem-
perature, but temperature-compensation is clearly a
characteristic of the period for most circadian rhythms.
24.2.4 THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS A
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT
IN PHOTOPERIODIC TIME
MEASUREMENT
Endogenous rhythms of all kinds are fundamentally a
question of time measurement, a concept that is not
easily imagined within the framework of conventional
biochemistry. Moreover, the clock is exclusively internal
and, except for resetting by light and temperature, is
not generally subject to manipulation from the outside.
This means the clock is not amenable to traditional
experimental strategies, since these normally require
that the investigator be able to control or manipulate the
system in some way. Another difﬁculty is our inability
to distinguish between oscillations that are part of the
timekeeping mechanism and those that are simply the
‘‘hands’’ responding to the output of the basic oscillator.
In 1936, E. B¨unning ﬁrst proposed that photoperi-
odism was tied to circadian rhythms. B¨unning proposed
that the rhythm was comprised of two phases—the
photophile, or light-loving phase, and the scotophile,
or dark-loving phase—which alternated about every
12 hours. According to B¨unning’s hypothesis, light
falling on the plant during the photophile phase would
promote ﬂowering while light during the scotophile
phase would inhibit ﬂowering. In most experimental
situations, when the plant is placed under continuous
conditions, the photophile phase would probably be
equivalent to subjective day and the scotophile phase
equivalent to subjective night. In order to demonstrate
rhythmicity in ﬂowering and test B¨unning’s hypoth-
esis, several novel experimental strategies have been
employed. The difﬁculty is that, unlike leaf movement or
carbon dioxide evolution, ﬂowering is not a continuous
process.
One
strategy
to
demonstrate
rhythmicity
in
ﬂowering is illustrated by the SD plant Chenopodium
rubrum, described in the previous section. Seedlings of
Chenopodium can be induced to ﬂower with a single dark
period when the seedlings are only 41/2 days old. Before
and after the dark period, the seedlings are maintained
under continuous light. As shown in Figure 24.12, when
the length of the dark period is varied, light during
the ﬁrst 8 to 10 hours inhibits ﬂowering as would be
expected with a SD plant. Thereafter, the capacity of the
seedlings to ﬂower as a function of the length of the dark
period expresses a rhythmic pattern for at least three
cycles, with a free-running period of 30 hours. With
minor variations in the experimental strategy, essentially
the same results have been demonstrated by other inves-
tigators using a variety of plants including cocklebur,
soybean, Japanese morning glory, and duckweed.
A second example of the close dependency of
photoperiodic time measurement on rhythmic phases
comes from a series of elegant experiments conducted
by W. S. Hillman with the aquatic plant Lemna pur-
pusilla (Figure 24.14). Lemna purpusilla is a SD plant
with a critical daylength of 12 hours. As an experi-
mental organism, Lemna offers the unique advantage
of growing heterotrophically in darkness when sup-
plied with glucose. This means that long light periods
can be eliminated and timing can be controlled by
skeleton photoperiods—short pulses of light that serve
to mark the beginning and end of dark periods. All
that is required to induce ﬂowering in Lemna are
two 15-minute (0.25 h) light periods every 24 hours
(Figure 24.15). Thus, when taken from continuous light to
a schedule of 13 hours dark: 0.25 hours light: 10.5 hours
dark: 0.25 hours light, Lemna will ﬂower. On a schedule
of 10.5 hours dark: 0.25 hours light: 13 hours dark:

Note that the only difference between the two schedules
is the length of the ﬁrst dark period following continuous
light. Even though both schedules contain a 13-hour
inductive dark period, ﬂowering is induced only when
the long dark period comes ﬁrst.
Clearly, Lemna recognizes the brief light pulses as
the beginning and end of two different dark periods,
but how does the plant know which is which? As with
other plants under continuous light, Lemna becomes
arrhythmic; that is, the amplitude of the rhythm damps
out until the rhythm disappears. Transfer of the plants to
darkness starts up the rhythm. Since ﬂowering occurred
only when the ﬁrst dark period exceeded the critical
night length, the ﬁrst dark period (and every alternate
period thereafter) must have been interpreted as night.
This appears to be a general rule—the light-off signal
following a period of continuous light starts up the
rhythm and the ﬁrst dark period (CT 0 to 12) is always
the night phase. The second phase (CT 12 to 24)
is the day phase. In subsequent experiments, Hillman
conﬁrmed that ﬂowering occurs only when a dark period
longer than the critical night length coincides with the
night phase of its circadian rhythm. It is interesting to
note that this interpretation is not limited to ﬂowering
plants—skeleton photoperiods elicit similar responses
with respect to photoperiodic effects in insects and birds.
24.2.5 DAYLENGTH MEASUREMENT
INVOLVES AN INTERACTION
BETWEEN AN EXTERNAL LIGHT
SIGNAL AND A CIRCADIAN
RHYTHM
Several models have been proposed to explain the
integration of photoperiodic time measurement with
the biological clock. The model that is most consistent
with both the earlier physiological studies and more
recent genetic evidence is the external coincidence
model. This model is essentially an updated version
of B¨unning’s scotophile and photophile hypothesis
(Figure 24.16). Keep in mind that this model has been
developed primarily for Arabidopsis, which is a facultative
long-day plant. In its simplest form, the external
coincidence model separates time measurement into
two interacting components: the circadian clock itself
and a clock-regulated daylength measuring mechanism.
According to this model, the circadian clock sets a
light-sensitive phase within the light–dark cycle. It does
this by controlling the cyclic output of a key regulator

FIGURE 24.16 The external coincidence model explains
daylength measurement in long-day plants. A critical
regulator gene is expressed maximally in late afternoon.
Because the function and stability of the regulator pro-
tein, whose function is to turn on ﬂowering genes, is
regulated by light, the downstream expression of ﬂow-
ering genes will occur only under long days when the
maximum expression of the regulator coincides with the
presence of daylight. The vertical dashed line represent
the day to night transition. The model also applies to
short-day plants if it assumed that the regulator inhibits
ﬂowering.

such that it reaches a maximum concentration in late
afternoon. In a long-day plant, the regulator is ulti-
mately responsible for turning on ﬂowering genes in the
shoot apical meristem but in order to initiate this chain
of events, the regulator must ﬁrst be activated by light.
Consequently, ﬂowering will be accelerated only when
the late-afternoon expression of the regulator coincides
with the presence of daylight, i.e., under long days.
Under short days, the regulator does not reach max-
imum concentration until well after the beginning of
the dark period. Consequently, the regulator can not be
light-activated and is thus unable to initiate the cascade
of events that leads to transcription of the ﬂowering
genes.
Although relatively little information is available for
short-day plants, the external coincidence model would
apply if it is assumed that the regulator inhibits, rather
than promoting, ﬂowering in short day plants.
24.2.6 THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS A
NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP
A basic model for the circadian clock system in plants
requires three components: input pathways, a central
oscillator, and output pathways (Figure 24.17). In plants,
the principal input pathway is mediated by the photore-
ceptors phytochrome and cryptochrome, which set the
phase of the oscillator in response to an external time
cue (e.g., daylength). The output pathways connect the
oscillator to other physiological processes whose overt
rhythms reﬂect the timing of the central oscillator.
Most output pathways are believed to be mediated by
clock-controlled genes.
The strategy for the genetic dissection of the circa-
dian clock is ﬁrst to identify genes whose transcription
is controlled by the clock and thus exhibits circadian
oscillations. One then looks for mutants that inﬂuence
the expression of the clock-controlled genes. If a mutant
can be identiﬁed that inﬂuences timing at any level,
the wildtype gene can be isolated and its gene product
analyzed for clues to its role in the timing mechanism.
The ﬁrst examples of clock-controlled genes in
plants were those involved in photosynthesis, in particu-
lar those encoding the chlorophyll a/b–binding proteins
found in the light-harvesting complex. Others include
the small subunit of Rubisco, the enzyme Rubisco acti-
vase, and, in crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants,
the enzyme PEP carboxylase kinase. The chlorophyll
a/b–binding proteins are encoded by a small family of
genes (CAB). Expression of CAB, as measured by mRNA
levels, is cyclic. CAB transcription begins to increase
shortly before dawn and reaches a peak a few hours
later. This cyclic expression of CAB has been exploited
to develop a sensitive, rapid, and automated system for
monitoring circadian rhythms at the molecular level.
This has been accomplished by fusing a reporter gene,

FIGURE 24.17 The three principal components of a sim-
ple circadian system include input pathways, a central
oscillator, and output pathways. In plants, the input
pathway(s) originate with light signals, mediated by phy-
tochrome and cryptochrome, that entrain (or, reset) the
central oscillator and may activate clock components.
The oscillator is localized within individual cells and reg-
ulates the expression of clock-controlled genes, which in
turn regulate overt rhythms. The output rhythms are the
‘‘hands’’ of the clock. Multiple-output pathways allow a
single oscillator to control overt rhythms with the same
periodicity but different phases.
the bioluminescent ﬁreﬂy luciferase (luc), with the pro-
moter for one of the chlorophyll a/b–binding protein
genes, CAB2. Luciferase has a sufﬁciently short life span
so that its activity will accurately reﬂect the activity of
the promoter. Because the CAB2 promoter is linked to
the central oscillator, transgenic plants containing the
resulting CAB2::luc reporter system will thus emit
light rhythmically and these emissions can be moni-
tored with sensitive light-monitoring equipment. Use
of the CAB2::luc reporter system has played a large role
in facilitating genetic analysis of the clock.
A number of genes closely related to the clock have
now been described and the list continues to grow. Many
of these were originally identiﬁed as ﬂowering-time
mutants in Arabidopsis and only later were found to
be associated with the clock. One of the ﬁrst circa-
dian timing mutants to be identiﬁed was toc1 (timing
of CAB). The gene product TOC1 is localized in the
nucleus where it has a role in transcription. The toc1
mutation shortens period length for a wide range of
clock-controlled processes. TOC1 transcripts exhibit a
24 hour periodicity with a peak in the evening. Two
other clock-associated genes are CIRCADIAN CLOCK
ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED
HYPOCOTYL (LHY). CCA1 is a transcription factor

that was discovered because of its capacity to bind
with the CAB promoter in Arabidopsis. It appears to
be a key element in the signal transduction pathway
linking phytochrome with the expression of CAB. How-
ever, expression of CCA1 itself cycles with a 24-hour
period, peaking in the morning soon after dawn. There
are several reasons for believing that CCA1 is closely
associated with the circadian oscillator. In transgenic
plants that constitutively express high levels of CCA1,
other circadian outputs, such as leaf movement, lose
their rhythmicity and ﬂowering is delayed. The circa-
dian rhythms of other clock-regulated genes, including
CAB, CAT3 (a gene encoding the enzyme catalase), and
an RNA-binding protein (CCR2) are also eliminated in
transgenic plants that over express CCA1.

FIGURE 24.18 A simpliﬁed molecular model of the Ara-
bidopsis circadian clock. The input signal, light, is per-
ceived by phytochrome and cryptochrome. The central
oscillator is a negative feedback system. TOC1 is a posi-
tive regulator of the CCA1 gene while CCA1 is a negative
regulator of the TOC1 gene. As TOC1 levels increase, an
increase in the levels of CCA1 follows. CCA1 in turn
shuts down the production of TOC1. The result is that
TOC1 and CCA1 levels alternately rise and fall. ELF3,
itself a product of the oscillator, blocks the input signal
in the evening in order to ensure that the clock is reset
by the morning light-on signal. One output of the clock
is the transcription of CONSTANS (CO), which initiates
the ﬂowering process.
Another clock-associated mutant is elf3 (early ﬂow-
ering 3). The elf3 mutation not only advances ﬂowering
under short days, but also renders both leaf movement
and CAB expression arrhythmic when entrained plants
are shifted to continuous light. However, CAB2::luc
activity still oscillates when entrained plants are shifted
to continuous dark. ELF3 protein levels are regulated
by the clock and peak in the evening. ELF3 functions to
repress (or, gate) the light input pathway in the evening
by binding to PHYB and inhibiting its activity. The
result is that ELF3 makes the clock insensitive to light
in the evening and ensures that clock is reset by the
morning light-on signal.
According to the current model, CCA1 and TOC1
are part of a negative feedback loop that makes up
the central oscillator (Figure 24.18). TOC1 acts as a
positive regulator of the CCA1 gene, thus stimulating
its transcription and the accumulation of CCA1 protein.
CCA1 protein, however, acts as a negative regulator
of the TOC1 gene, so as CCA1 accumulates, one of
its actions is to repress TOC1 transcription. In this
manner, TOC1 and CCA1 levels alternately increase
and decrease, or oscillate, over a 24-hour period. The
oscillations are kept in phase by the dawn light-on signal
received by phytochrome and cryptochrome and gated
by ELF3, itself a product of the oscillator.
The circadian oscillator generates multiple out-
put rhythms, possibly through the regulatory action of
TOC1, CCA1, or related proteins on different genes.
One of these certainly is the rhythmic output of CON-
STANS (CO) in the leaf, which initiates the ﬂoral
signaling cascade as described earlier. Other multiple
outputs with different free-running periods could be
explained in several ways. The clock is more complex
than the simpliﬁed model shown in Figure 24.17. As
the information accumulates, it is becoming increas-
ingly clear that many additional genes and proteins are
involved, forming multiple feedback loops. These addi-
tional layers of complexity could easily lead to multiple
rhythms with different periodicities. Alternatively, there
could be multiple oscillators within each cell, each linked
to different genes, or there could be different oscillators
within different cells in the same tissue.
24.3 PHOTOPERIODISM
IN NATURE
Photoperiodism almost certainly reﬂects the need for
plants to synchronize their life cycles to the time of year.
Outside of the tropics, daylength is the most reliable
predictor of seasonal change (Figure 24.19). Not sur-
prisingly, photoperiodism is more important to plants
in the subtropical and temperate latitudes where sea-
sonal variations in daylength are more pronounced. But
even many tropical plants respond to the small changes
in daylength that occur within 5 or 10 degrees of the

equator. Does this mean that the photoperiod response
ties a species to one particular latitude? Probably not,
since the critical photoperiod only sets the upper (for
SD plant) or lower (for LD plant) limits for daylength.
Beyond that, ﬂowering and other responses to pho-
toperiod can usually occur within fairly broad limits.
Moreover, there is evidence that populations of plants
are able to genetically adapt to latitude, thus giving
rise to physiological ecotypes. In a variety of species,
including Betula (birch), Chenopodium (lambs quarters),
Oxyria digyna (mountain sorrel), and Xanthium, there are
known ecotypes or photoperiodic races characterized by
different critical daylengths. As a rule, the length of
the critical day is longer as the individuals are collected
at more northerly latitudes. In most cases, the critical
daylength seems to key ﬂowering to a consistent time
interval before the arrival of damaging autumn frosts at
that latitude.
Photoperiodism also helps to ensure that plants
ﬂower in their temporal niche, reducing competition
with others as well as ensuring that reproductive devel-
opment is completed before the onslaught of unfavor-
able winter conditions. In many species, germination,
for a variety of reasons, may not be uniform. If ﬂower-
ing relied solely on plant size, nonuniform germination
would be expected to spread ﬂowering out in time as
well. To the extent that cross-pollination is required or
advantageous, ﬂowering synchronized by photoperiod
would serve to ensure the maximum pollinating popu-
lation or to coordinate ﬂowering with the appearance of
a particular pollinating insect.
Photoperiod and its effects on geographical distri-
bution of plants can have a direct impact on humans,
as illustrated by the case of common ragweed (Ambrosia
artemisifolia). Ragweed is an annual SD plant, with a
critical daylength of about 14.5 hours. The further north
one goes, the longer the summer daylength. At the lat-
itude of Winnepeg, Canada, (50◦N), for example, the
daylength exceeds 16 hours through most of June and
July and doesn’t drop below 14.5 hours until mid-August
(Figure 24.19). Ragweed induced to ﬂower at that time
of the year would have insufﬁcient time to ﬂower and
produce mature seed before the arrival of killing frosts in
early fall. Since common ragweed can reproduce only by
seed, it is abundant only in the more southerly regions
of Ontario, Quebec, and the maritime provinces. It is
rarely found, and then only on scattered patches of agri-
cultural land, throughout most of western and central
Canada. Hay-fever sufferers in these regions are at least
spared the inconvenience of highly allergenic ragweed
pollen, which plagues their neighbors to the south. This
is not to suggest that photoperiod is the only factor that
limits the distribution of plants such as ragweed, but it
is clearly a signiﬁcant part of the equation.
SUMMARY
Photoperiodism is a response to the duration and tim-
ing of light and dark periods. There are three basic
photoperiodic response types: short-day (SD) plants,
long-day (LD) plants, and day-neutral (DN) plants.
Other response types are variations on the three basic
types and may be modiﬁed by environmental condi-
tions such as temperature. A photoperiod requirement
may be qualitative, in which case the requirement is
absolute, or quantitative, in which case the favorable
photoperiod merely hastens the response. The distinc-
tion between LD plants and SD plants is based on their
response to daylengths greater than or shorter than
the critical daylength. The absolute critical daylength
varies from one species to another and the critical
daylength for a LD plant may be shorter than the
critical daylength for a SD plant.

Chapter 24 / Measuring Time: Controlling Development by Photoperiod and Endogenous Clocks
Plants actually measure the length of a dark inter-
val between the light-off and light-on signals. Action
spectra of the light-break, which interrupts an other-
wise inductive dark period, indicate that phytochrome
is involved in the light signals. Photoperiodic light
signals are perceived in the leaf but the response ulti-
mately occurs elsewhere in the plant. This separation of
perception and response suggests the logical necessity
for a transmissible stimulus. In the case of ﬂowering,
the stimulus was proposed to be a hormone called ﬂori-
gen. It now appears that transmissible signal may be
a small protein, FT, which is synthesized in the leaf
phloem parenchyma and carried through the sieve
tubes to the shoot apical meristem where it turns on
the ﬂowering genes.
Many aspects of plant development, including pho-
toperiodism and nyctinasty, are controlled by an inter-
nal circadian clock. The circadian clock is difﬁcult to
study by traditional methods because, other than shift-
ing the phase (equivalent to setting the clock), the
clock is not readily manipulated by external inﬂuence.
Three criteria that distinguish between simple periodic
phenomena and clock-driven rhythms are (1) a clock-
driven rhythm persists under constant conditions, (2) a
clock-driven rhythm is reset or phased by environmen-
tal signals such as light and temperature, and (3) clock-
driven rhythms exhibit temperature compensation.
Time measurement in photoperiodism involves an
interaction between phytochrome and the endogenous
biological clock. The nature of the clock and the phy-
tochrome/clock interactions is beginning to yield to
genetic studies. The use of a CAB2::luc reporter system
has enabled identiﬁcation of several clock-associated
genes in plants. The central oscillator in plants is a
negative feedback system similar to the oscillator pre-
viously found in insects, animals, and cyanobacteria.
Because changing daylength is the most reliable
predictor of seasonable change, photoperiodism almost
certainly reﬂects the need for plants to synchronize
their life cycle to the time of year. Photoperiodism
helps ensure that plants ﬂower in their temporal niche,
reducing competition with others, or that reproduction
is complete before the onslaught of unfavorable winter
conditions.
CHAPTER REVIEW

plant?

Flowering and Fruit Development
Flowering and fruit development have long held the
interest of developmental biologists and physiologists
because they represent a dramatic change in the pattern
of shoot development and have signiﬁcant economic
implications. The switch of the shoot apical meri-
stem from vegetative to ﬂoral organs and the subse-
quent development of fruit is a critical step in the
developmental history of a plant and must be regulated
precisely in order to ensure reproductive success. In
the previous chapter it was shown that synchronization
of ﬂowering time with an environmental cue such as
photoperiod is not a simple event. It is possible only
through the interactions of many genetic and biochem-
ical pathways: pathways involved in signal perception
and transduction; pathways involved in the regulation
of the circadian clock; and pathways involved in the
development of the ﬂoral primordia.
Over the years, ﬂowering in a number of species,
including maize (Zea mays), petunia (Petunia sps.), snap-
dragon (Antirrhinum sps.), tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum),
and annual ryegrass (Lolium temulentum), has been the
subject of molecular and genetic studies. More recently,
focus has shifted to the model plant Arabidopsis, where
a number of genes that inﬂuence ﬂowering have been
identiﬁed and a model proposed to account for the
genetic speciﬁcation of ﬂoral organ initiation. In many
cases, especially winter cereals and biennials, a period
of low temperature can signiﬁcantly alter the ﬂowering
response. The low-temperature treatment, called ver-
nalization, inﬂuences ﬂowering time under long days.
Finally, ﬂowering is followed by the development of a
specialized organ, the fruit, which ensure the proper
environment for seed maturation and dispersal of the
mature seed.
In this chapter we will examine
•
the molecular genetic control of ﬂower initiation
and development in the shoot apical meristem,
•
the phenomenon of vernalization and its relation-
ship to other ﬂowering time pathways, and
•
the basic principles of fruit set and fruit develop-
ment.
25.1 FLOWER INITIATION AND
DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES
THE SEQUENTIAL ACTION
OF THREE SETS OF GENES
As noted in the previous chapter, ﬂowering in many
plants is inﬂuenced by environmental factors such as
photoperiod and temperature and involves the synthesis
of a mobile ﬂoral stimulus in the leaves. Other plants do
not require external inputs and the signal is generated
in the leaves when the plant simply reaches a minimum

Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
stage of development. In any case, ﬂower development
is initiated when that signal arrives at the shoot apical
meristem. During the vegetative state, the shoot apical
meristem is programmed to produce leaf primordial.
When the ﬂoral signal arrives from the leaf, the meri-
stem acquires ﬂoral identity and secondary inﬂorescence
meristems, or ﬂoral primordia, arise in the axils of the
uppermost leaf primordia.
The use of genetic mutants that alter ﬂowering-time
and the initiation of ﬂoral primordia has been a pow-
erful tool for identifying many of the genes involved
and dissecting the various pathways that lead to ﬂower-
ing (Table 25.1). As a general rule, mutants that cause
early ﬂowering indicate a wildtype gene that normally
represses ﬂowering while mutants that cause late ﬂow-
ering point to a wildtype gene that normally promotes
ﬂowering.
Extensive research with Arabidopsis has identiﬁed
three sequential stages to the ﬂowering process, each
with its own set of genes. The ﬁrst set of genes com-
prises the ﬂowering-time genes. Flowering-time genes
determine when the plant initiates ﬂowering, either in
response to the appropriate environmental signal or
by monitoring the developmental state of the plant.
Most mutations of the ﬂowering-time genes cause the
plants to ﬂower later than normal, although a few will
cause ﬂowering to advance. One role of ﬂowering-time
genes is to activate the expression of ﬂoral-identity
genes. Floral-identity genes commit undifferentiated
primordia to the production of ﬂoral rather than veg-
etative structures. Mutations in ﬂoral-identity genes
cause primordia that would normally develop as ﬂowers
to produce structures with vegetative characteristics.
The ﬂoral-identity genes in turn activate a set of
organ-identity genes that serve to control the sub-
sequent development of ﬂoral organs such as sepals,
petals, stamens, and carpels. Expression of ﬂoral- and
organ-identity genes, however, is not strictly linear.
Some identity genes overlap in both the time of their
expression and their function. As we shall see later, muta-
tions in the organ-identity genes may cause abnormal
development of any or all of the ﬂoral organs.
25.1.1 FLOWERING-TIME GENES
INFLUENCE THE DURATION
OF VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Flowering-time genes provide the connection between
ﬂorigen, or the ﬂoral induction signal, and the transi-
tion to the production of ﬂoral organs. Flowering-time
mutants may therefore interfere with the production of
the signal in the leaf (including the timing mechanism, or
circadian clock), translocation of the signal to the apex,
or its activity in the apex. Most ﬂowering-time mutants
identiﬁed thus far cause plants to ﬂower later than nor-
mal, indicating that the mutants interfere with pathways
that normally promote ﬂowering. Note that ﬂowering
time, as it is used here, refers to a developmental time

rather than chronological time (e.g., days to ﬂower-
ing). For example, Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day
plant with a critical photoperiod of 8 to 10 hours.
The vegetative Arabidopsis plant grows as a rosette and
ﬂowering is preceded by stem elongation. Thus, under
long days Arabidopsis ﬂowers with 4 to 7 leaves in the
rosette (about 3 weeks) but under short days ﬂowering
is delayed until 20 leaves have formed (7 to 10 weeks).
Note that ﬂowering is not related to elapsed time, but
to the number of rosette leaves produced before the
ﬂowering stem appears. Late-ﬂowering mutants simply
extend vegetative growth and increase the number of
leaves in the rosette before the stem elongates and the
ﬂowers develop.
It is interesting to note that, although a large num-
ber of late-ﬂowering mutants have been described, no
single Arabidopsis mutant that remains vegetative indef-
initely has yet been identiﬁed. This ﬁts with the general
assumption that there are multiple pathways controlling
ﬂowering time with a certain amount of built-in redun-
dancy. Redundancy provides that inactivation of genes in
one pathway is at least partially compensated for by other
genes or complementary pathways. In Arabidopsis, at
least ﬁve separate, but interacting, pathways for control-
ling ﬂowering time have been identiﬁed (Figure 25.1).
Several ﬂowering-time mutants, including fca, ld,
and fve, ﬂower later than wildtype plants under both
LD and SD conditions but remain sensitive to ver-
nalization. Because ﬂowering in the mutants is equally
affected under both LD and SD conditions, the cor-
responding wildtype genes are thought to be active
in an autonomous pathway that monitors develop-
mental stage and initiates ﬂowering in response to

FIGURE 25.1 Five separate genetic pathways control

converge on LEAFY (LFY), a ﬂoral-identity gene in the
shoot apical meristem that mediates the switch from a
vegetative meristem to a ﬂoral meristem.
internal developmental signals. Such a signal is com-
monly reﬂected in a minimum leaf number that must
be achieved before ﬂowering can proceed. Flower-
ing of a second group of mutants, including constans
(CO) and gigantea (GI), is delayed under LD condi-
tions, but not under SD conditions. These mutants also
show no response to low-temperature treatments, or
vernalization, which is normally linked to a LD ﬂow-
ering response and not a SD response. As described in
Chapter 24, the CO gene is believed to be a central
component in the photoperiodic or long-day pathway
and is responsible for promoting the mobile ﬂoral stim-
ulus FT. Both CO and GI have been cloned and studied
in some detail. It appears that GI operates before CO
in the same pathway and that ﬂoral promotion under
long days depends on the amount of CO protein and,
subsequently, FT protein that is produced. The action
of FT at the shoot apical meristem is at least in part
mediated by a transcription factor FD. At this point it
appears that the combination of FT and FD proteins
is responsible for initiating ﬂowering under long days
by activating ﬂoral identity genes in the shoot apical
meristem.
A single mutant identiﬁed as ga1, which ﬂowers
late under LD conditions and does not ﬂower at all
under SD conditions, is thought to represent a sepa-
rate pathway mediated by gibberellin, the gibberellic
acid or GA pathway. Finally, there is a small group of
genes that appear to act primarily as ﬂoral repressors.
This conclusion is based on the observation that their
loss-of-function mutants [e.g., elf3 (early ﬂowering 3) and
phytochrome B (phyB)] cause early ﬂowering. Some, such
as the phyB mutants, retain a response to photoperiod
while others, such as elf3, do not. The loss of photope-
riod response in elf3 appears due to disruption of the
circadian rhythm component of photoperiodic timing.
Other early-ﬂowering mutants, such as emf1 and emf2
(embryonic ﬂower 1-2), ﬂower almost immediately fol-
lowing germination, without forming any rosette leaves.
Instead, the plants form reproductive structures on the
surface of their cotyledons. Because wildtype plants
eventually ﬂower, it appears that the repressor activity
of EMF genes must be intended to prevent precocious
ﬂowering. The activity of repressor genes must decline
during development or at some point be turned off,
eventually allowing one or more of the promotory path-
ways to take precedence. In addition to the above four
genetic pathways, a possible ﬁfth pathway that mediates
low-temperature effects on ﬂowering has been suggested
by recent studies.
One of the challenges that remain is to sort out to
what extent known ﬂowering-time genes are involved in
the production, transmission, and perception of the
ﬂoral induction signal. In this regard, an interest-
ing late-ﬂowering mutation has recently been isolated
from maize (Zea mays). Flowering in maize follows

436
Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
an autonomous pathway and wildtype plants normally
ﬂower after producing a ﬁxed number of leaves. Maize
plants carrying the mutant id1 (indeterminate 1), how-
ever, continue to produce only leaves long after the
wildtype plant has produced ears and tassels. When they
eventually do ﬂower, the ﬂoral structures are aberrant.
However, unlike many of the Arabidopsis ﬂowering-time
genes, which are expressed in the shoot apical meristem
and activate ﬂoral-identity genes, id1 is expressed only in
the young leaves. This pattern suggests that the function
of ID1 may be more closely related to the synthesis of
the ﬂoral stimulus (or repression of ﬂoral inhibitors) in
the leaves.
25.1.2 FLORAL-IDENTITY GENES
AND ORGAN-IDENTITY
GENES OVERLAP IN TIME
AND FUNCTION
While the principal effect of ﬂowering-time mutants
is on the duration of vegetative development, muta-
tions in the ﬂoral-identity genes disrupt the transition
of the undifferentiated primordia to ﬂoral meristems.
At least four ﬂoral-identity genes have been isolated
from Arabidopsis: LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1),
APETELA 2 (AP2), and CAULIFLOWER (CAL). Floral-
identity genes are expressed in the apical meristem prior
to the formation of ﬂoral organs but their expression
is up-regulated rapidly following ﬂoral induction by
long days or application of gibberellin. However, their
individual roles have been difﬁcult to study because
of extensive redundancy (i.e., a loss of function due
to one mutation is readily compensated by one of the
other wildtype genes). The LEAFY gene appears to
play a key role in ﬂoral meristem identity. This can
be demonstrated by placing the gene under the control
of a strong gene promoter (designated 35S) from the
cauliﬂower mosaic virus. Transgenic plants that con-
tain the 35S::LEAFY combination (called a construct)
bypass the requirement for a ﬂoral induction signal
and express the gene constitutively. In such plants, a
shortened primary shoot terminates early in clusters of
ﬂowers and all secondary shoots produce ﬂowers from
the rosette. By contrast, the lfy mutant produces more
inﬂorescence branches than a wildtype plant but the
‘‘ﬂowers’’ consist of green, leaf-like organs. Moreover,
constitutive expression of the ﬂowering-time gene CO
leads to a rapid activation of LEAFY in wildtype plants.
LEAFY appears to have a central role in the ﬂowering
process. It is probably the principal target of the mobile
ﬂowering-time mobile stimulus FT when it arrives in
the meristem. LEAFY, in turn, activates organ identity
genes such as APETALA1 (AP1).
The Arabidopsis ﬂower is rather typical among
advanced ﬂowering plants, consisting of four distinct
whorls of ﬂoral organs (Figure 25.2).The outermost

FIGURE 25.2 (A) The Arabidopsis ﬂower consists of four
distinct whorls. The outermost whorl (whorl 1) consists
of four sepals, which are green and leaf-like. The next
whorl (whorl 2) consists of four yellow petals. The third
whorl contains six stamens, and the innermost whorl
(whorl 4) contains two fused carpels at the base of the
pistil.
whorl (whorl 1) consists of four sepals, which are green
and leaf-like. The next whorl (whorl 2) consists of four
yellow petals. The third whorl (whorl 3) contains six
stamens, or male reproductive organs, and the inner-
most whorl (whorl 4) contains two fused carpels at the
base of the female reproductive structure, the pistil.
Mutations in combination with studies of temporal and
spatial expression patterns have identiﬁed ﬁve genes
that are involved in the determination of organ iden-
tity: APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA2 (AP2), APETALA3
(AP3), PISTILATA (PI), and AGAMOUS (AG). Note
that AP1 and AP2 have both been previously identi-
ﬁed as ﬂoral identity genes as well. Mutations in the
organ-identity genes generally result in the modiﬁca-
tion, displacement, or total absence of ﬂoral organs. In
addition, mutations in any one of these genes generally
inﬂuence the development of two adjacent ﬂoral organs.
The inﬂuence of organ-identity genes on the devel-
opment of the Arabidopsis ﬂower can best be understood
by viewing the ﬂoral meristem as three overlapping
developmental ﬁelds or ﬁelds of gene activity; desig-
nated A, B, and C. Field A includes the sepals and petals
(whorls 1 and 2), ﬁeld B includes the petals and stamens
(whorls 2 and 3), and ﬁeld C includes the stamens and
central carpels (whorls 3 and 4). This view is referred
to as the ABC model for ﬂoral organ speciﬁcation, in
which a particular gene or pair of genes is associated
with each developmental ﬁeld, but controls the identity
of two adjacent whorls of organs (Figure 25.3). Accord-
ing to this model, expression of AP1 alone speciﬁes
sepals; AP1 in combination with AP3 and PI speciﬁes
petals; AP3 and PI in combination with AG specify sta-
mens; and AG alone speciﬁes the carpels. Expression of
AP2 is apparently required throughout the meristem, in
part to suppress, in combination with a sixth, unknown
gene (X), the expression of AG in those whorls that are
destined to become sepals and petals.

ﬁcation of whorls 2 and 3. Field C is involved in the

sepals, ﬁelds A and B together specify petals, ﬁelds B

ﬁes carpels. Each ﬁeld is associated with a speciﬁc gene
or gene pair. APETALA1 is expressed only in ﬁeld A,
APETALA3 and PISTILLATA are expressed in ﬁeld B,
and AGAMOUS is expressed only in ﬁeld C. AGAMOUS
also represses (T-bar) the expression of APETALA1 in
ﬁeld C. APETALA2 is expressed throughout the meri-
stem and, in conjunction with an unknown gene (X),
represses the expression of AGAMOUS in ﬁeld A. (After

in loss-of-function mutants for each of these genes

to be expressed in all four whorls. The result
is petaloid structures in whorl 3 and sepaloid
structures in whorl 4.
meristem would be unable to form either petals or
stamens. Not only is this the case, but the whorls that
would normally be ﬁlled with petals and stamens are
ﬁlled instead with sepal-like and carpel-like structures.
Similarly, in the ag mutant, stamens and carpels are not
formed and all four whorls are ﬁlled with sepals or petals.
No doubt this model will continue to be reﬁned as new
genes are discovered and the various genes and their
products are subjected to further molecular analysis.
Although it is becoming more evident which genes
are active in controlling which aspects of ﬂoral initiation
and development, their biochemical and physiologi-
cal function is not yet clear. However, most of the
gene products that have been analyzed thus far share
certain characteristics, called motifs, which are typi-
cal of transcription factors. Transcription factors are
DNA-binding proteins that enable RNA polymerases
to recognize promoters and begin transcription of the
gene in eukaryotes. It thus appears that the principal
function of most ﬂowering-time, ﬂoral-identity, and
organ-identity genes is to regulate other genes that may
then direct synthesis of the components that actually
make up the individual organs.
25.2 TEMPERATURE CAN ALTER
THE FLOWERING RESPONSE
TO PHOTOPERIOD
There are many examples of interactions between tem-
perature and photoperiod, particularly with respect to
ﬂowering behavior (see Salisbury, 1963, for an exten-
sive listing). In most cases the interaction results in
relatively subtle changes in the length of the critical

438
Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
photoperiod or a tendency toward daylength neutral-
ity or an inability to ﬂower altogether at high or low
temperature extremes. There are other plants, however,
for which ﬂowering is either quantitatively or qualita-
tively dependent on exposure to low temperature. This
phenomenon is known as vernalization. Vernalization
is a means of preventing precocious reproductive devel-
opment late in the growing season, ensuring instead
that seed production does not begin until the beginning
of the next growing season so that the seed will have
sufﬁcient time to reach maturity.
Vernalization refers speciﬁcally to the promotion
of ﬂowering by a period of low-temperature and should
not be confused with other miscellaneous effects of
low-temperature on plant development. The term itself
is a translation of the Russian yarovizatsya; both words
combining the root for spring (Russian, yarov; Latin,
ver) with a sufﬁx meaning ‘‘to make’’ or ‘‘become.’’
Coined by the Russian T. D. Lysenko in the 1920s, ver-
nalization reﬂects the ability of a cold treatment to make
a winter cereal mimic the behavior of a spring cereal
with respect to its ﬂowering behavior. The response
had actually been observed many years earlier by agri-
culturalists, but didn’t receive critical attention of the
scientiﬁc community until J. G. Gassner showed in 1918
that the cold requirement of winter cereals could be
satisﬁed during seed germination. For his part, Lysenko
received considerable notoriety for his conviction that
the effect was an inheritable conversion of the winter
strain to a spring strain. His position—a form of the
thoroughly discredited Lamarkian doctrine of inheri-
tance of acquired characteristics—was adopted as Soviet
dogma in biology and remained so until the 1950s.
The adoption of Lysenko’s views as ofﬁcial dogma
had a signiﬁcant impact on Soviet biology and placed
agriculture in the USSR at a severe disadvantage for
decades.1
25.2.1 VERNALIZATION OCCURS MOST
COMMONLY IN WINTER
ANNUALS AND BIENNIALS
Typical winter annuals are the so-called ‘‘winter’’ cere-
als (wheat, barley, rye). ‘‘Spring’’ cereals are normally
daylength insensitive. They are planted in the spring
and come to ﬂower and produce grain before the end of
the growing season. Winter strains, however, if planted
in the spring would normally fail to ﬂower or pro-
duce mature grain within the span of a normal growing
1The story of vernalization is a classic example of what can
happen when science becomes enmeshed in political
ideology. For the interested student, this unfortunate episode
in the history of science has been artfully documented by
D. Joravsky in his book The Lysenko Affair (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1970).
season. Winter cereals are instead planted in the fall.
They germinate and over-winter as small seedlings,
resume growth in the spring, and are harvested usually
about midsummer. The over-wintering cold treatment,
or vernalization, renders the plants sensitive to long
days.
One of the most thorough studies of vernaliza-
tion and photoperiodism was carried out on the Petkus
cultivar of rye (Secale cereale) by F. G. Gregory and
O. N. Purvis, beginning in the 1930s. There are two
strains of Petkus rye: a spring strain and a winter strain.
The spring strain of Petkus rye is a facultative long-day
plant. Under short days, ﬂoral initiation does not occur
until after about 22 leaves have been produced, typi-
cally requiring a season of about 4.5 months. Under
the appropriate long-day regime, however, ﬂowering in
the spring strain is initiated after as few as seven leaves
have been produced, requiring only about two months.
When sown in the spring, the winter strain is insensi-
tive to photoperiod. The winter strain ﬂowers equally
slowly—requiring four to ﬁve months—regardless of
daylength.
If seeds of the winter strain are sown in the fall,
however, the germinated seedlings are subjected to
an over wintering low-temperature treatment. When
they resume growth in the spring, winter strain plants
respond as long-day plants in the same way as the spring
strain. The effect of the over wintering cold treatment
can also be achieved by vernalizing the seed, that is, by
holding the germinated seed near 1◦C for several weeks.
Note that the low-temperature treatment, at least in the
case of winter annuals, does not alone promote early
ﬂower initiation. Rather, the effect of vernalization is to
render the seedling sensitive to photoperiod.
Another example of vernalization is seen in bien-
nial plants. Biennials are monocarpic plants that normally
ﬂower (and die) in the second season, again follow-
ing an over-wintering cold treatment. Typical bien-
nials include many varieties of sugar- and table-beet
(Beta vulgaris), cabbages and related plants (Brassica
sp.), carrots (Daucus carota) and other members of
the family Umbellifereae, foxglove (Digitalis purpurea),
and some strains of black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger).
Biennials share with the winter annuals the property
that subjecting the growing plant to a cold treat-
ment stimulates a subsequent photoperiodic ﬂowering
response.
Biennials typically grow as a rosette, charac-
terized by shortened internodes, in the ﬁrst season
(Figure 25.5). Over winter, the leaves die back but
the crown, including the apical meristem, remains
protected. New growth the following spring is char-
acterized by extensive stem elongation, called bolting,
followed
by ﬂowering.
The cold
requirement in
biennials is qualitative (i.e., absolute). In the absence of
a cold treatment many biennials can be maintained in

the nonﬂowering rosette habit indeﬁnitely. As a rule,
vernalized plants, whether winter annuals or biennials,
tend to respond as long-day ﬂowering plants, although
some biennials are daylength-indifferent following
vernalization. One exception to the rule is the perennial
Chrysanthemum morifolium, a SDP. Some varieties of
Chrysanthemum require vernalization before responding
as a quantitative SDP. As a perennial, Chrysanthemum
normally requires vernalization on an annual basis.
Many other plants such as pea (Pisum sativum) and
spinach (Spinacea oleracea) can be induced to ﬂower
earlier with a cold treatment but it is not an absolute
requirement.
25.2.2 THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE
FOR VERNALIZATION IS
VARIABLE
The range of temperatures effective in vernalization
varies widely depending on the species and duration of
exposure. In Petkus rye, the effective range is −5◦C
to +15◦C, with a broad optimum between +1◦C and
+7◦C. Within these limits, vernalization is proportional
to the duration of treatment. Flowering advances sharply
after as little as one to two weeks’ treatment at 1◦C to
2◦C and is maximally effective after about seven weeks
at that temperature (Figure 25.6). Within the effective
range, the temperature optimum is generally higher
for shorter treatment periods. Presumably, a longer
exposure to lower temperatures within the effective

Seeds were germinated in moist sand at 1◦C for the
time indicated. Cold treatments were scheduled so that
all seeds were returned to the greenhouse at the same
time. The number of days to ﬂowering progressively
decreased with increasing length of the cold treat-
ment. (From Purvis, O. N., F. G. Gregory. 1937. Annals
of Botany, N.S. 1:569–591. Copyright, The Annals of
Botany Company.)
range is required because the metabolic reactions leading
to the vernalized state progress more slowly.
Like ﬂowering, the vernalized state is more or less
permanent in most species, giving rise to the con-
cept of an induced state. For example, vernalized
Hyoscyamus, a LDP, can be held under short days
for up to 10 months before losing the capacity to
respond to long-day treatment. On the other hand,
all cold-requiring plants that have been studied are
capable of being devernalized—vernalization can be
reversed if followed immediately by a high-temperature
treatment. Flowering in vernalized winter wheat, for
example, can be fully nulliﬁed if the seedlings are held
near 30◦C for three to ﬁve days. For most plants, then,
there is a ‘‘neutral’’ temperature where neither vernal-
ization nor devernalization occurs. For Petkus rye the
neutral temperature is about 15◦C. Vernalized seeds of
Petkus rye can also be devernalized by drying them for
several weeks or by maintaining the seeds under anaer-
obic conditions for a period of time following the cold
treatment.

Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
25.2.3 THE VERNALIZATION
TREATMENT IS PERCEIVED
BY THE SHOOT APEX
A vernalization treatment is effective only on actively
growing plants. Cold treatment of dry seeds will not
sufﬁce. Thus winter cereals may be vernalized as soon
as the embryo has imbibed water and the germination
process has been initiated. Other plants, in particular
the biennials, must reach a certain minimum size before
they can be vernalized. Hyoscyamus (black henbane), for
example, is not sensitive before 10 days of age and does
not reach maximum sensitivity until 30 days of age. In
either case, the cold treatment appears to be effective
only in the meristematic zones of the shoot apex. This
can be shown by localized cooling treatments or ver-
nalization of moistened embryos. Early studies showed
that even the cultured apex of isolated rye embryos
was susceptible to vernalization. Thus the induced state
established in a relatively few meristematic cells can be
maintained throughout the development of the plant.
Most biennials, however, cannot be induced as seeds.
In these plants it is the over-wintering stem apex that
perceives the stimulus, although there are some reports
suggesting that leaves and even isolated roots may be
susceptible in some cases.
25.2.4 THE VERNALIZED STATE
IS TRANSMISSIBLE
Experiments with isolated embryos have shown that ver-
nalization treatments are effective only when the embryo
is supplied with carbohydrate and oxygen is present,
indicating that it is an energy-dependent metabolic pro-
cess. Still, the nature of the induced state has eluded
researchers for many years. To the extent that the
meristem itself is the site of perception, any necessity
for a transmissible hormone appears to be ruled out.
A cold-induced, permanent change in the physiological
or genetic state of the meristematic cells (referred to
as ‘‘mitotic memory’’) would be self-propagating, that
is, it could be passed on to daughter cells through cell
division. There is some support for this argument. In
plants such as Petkus rye and Chrysanthemum, only tissue
produced in a direct cell line from the induced meristem
is vernalized. If the cold treatment is localized to a single
apex, it will ﬂower, but all the buds that did not receive
the cold treatment will remain vegetative.
In other experiments, especially with Hyoscyamus,
transmission of the vernalized state across a graft union
has been demonstrated. A list of successful experiments
has been tabulated by A. Lang in his 1965 review (see
Further Reading). These experiments are comparable
to the transmission of ﬂorigen’’ across a graft union
(Chapter 24) and result in ﬂowering in nonvernal-
ized receptor plants. If a vernalized Hyoscyamus plant is
grafted to a nonvernalized plant, both will ﬂower under
long days. Transmission requires a successful (i.e., liv-
ing) graft union and appears to be coordinated with the
ﬂow of photoassimilate between the donor and receptor.
Experiments such as those described above led
G. Melchers to propose the existence of a transmissi-
ble vernalization stimulus called vernalin. Like ﬂorigen,
vernalin has resisted all attempts at isolation and remains
a hypothetical substance. Unfortunately, the vernalin
story is to some extent clouded by interpretation. The
grafting experiments all require vernalization followed
by long days. They do not clearly distinguish between
the transmission of ‘‘vernalin’’ and the possibility that
the nonvernalized partner is responding instead to the
ﬂoral stimulus itself (e.g., FT), which would be trans-
mitted from the vernalized donor under long days.
Adding to the complexity of vernalization is the
apparent involvement of gibberellins in the response to
low temperature (see Figure 25.5). This was dramatically
demonstrated by A. Lang in 1957 when he showed that
repeated application of 10 μg of GA3 to the apex would
stimulate ﬂowering in nonvernalized biennial strains of
Hyoscyamus and several other biennials maintained under
short days. No such promotion occurred in Xanthium
and other short-day plants treated with gibberellin under
noninductive long days. Subsequently it has been shown
that gibberellin levels tend to increase in response to
low-temperature treatments in several cold-requiring
species.
The role of gibberellins is not clear, although in
noninduced plants very high concentrations of the gib-
berellin precursor ent-kaurenoic acid accumulate in the
shoot apex. This suggests that the cold treatment is
required to complete the synthesis of gibberellins in
these plants.
25.2.5 GIBBERELLIN AND
VERNALIZATION OPERATE
THROUGH INDEPENDENT
GENETIC PATHWAYS
Results such as those described in the previous section
have raised the question: Are vernalin and gibberellin
equivalent? The answer, on both physiological and
genetic grounds, is no. It is true that gibberellin appears
to substitute for the cold requirement of some vernal-
izable plants and for the long-day requirement in some
long-day plants, or, in the case of vernalization, both.
But virtually every situation in which gibberellin has suc-
cessfully substituted for low temperature or long days
in promoting ﬂowering involves bolting, or the rapid
elongation of stems from the rosette vegetative state.
Far less success has been achieved with gibberellins
in caulescent long-day plants—those whose stems are
already elongated in the vegetative state. Moreover,
the developmental pattern in responsive plants differs

25.2 Temperature Can Alter the Flowering Response to Photoperiod
441
signiﬁcantly depending on whether stem elongation is
stimulated by low temperature or gibberellin treatment.
Following low-temperature treatment, ﬂower buds are
evident at the time stem elongation begins. Following
gibberellin treatment, on the other hand, the stem ﬁrst
elongates to produce a vegetative shoot. Flower buds do
not appear until later. These results suggest independent
pathways for vernalization and gibberellins.
Recent genetic studies of ﬂowering have conﬁrmed
that gibberellin and vernalization operate via separate
genetic pathways (see Figure 25.1). When a triple
mutant was constructed containing mutant alleles
(co-2, fca-1, ga1-3) that impair each of the long-day,
autonomous, and GA-dependent pathways, the mutant
plants failed to ﬂower under either long days or short
days in controlled environment rooms. After 90 to 100
rosette leaves had been produced without ﬂowering, the
plants were then transferred to a long-day greenhouse.
After six months, the majority of the mutant plants
had died without ever ﬂowering. However, if the triple
mutant seedlings were ﬁrst vernalized at 5◦C for 7
weeks, all the plants ﬂowered after approximately 50
leaves had been produced. The most straightforward
interpretation of these results would be that (1) the
triple mutant has an absolute requirement for vernaliza-
tion and (2) vernalization promotes ﬂowering through
yet another genetic pathway that is separate from the
GA-dependent, long-day, and autonomous pathways.
Both the autonomous pathway and vernalization
reduce the expression of the gene FLOWERING LOCUS
C (FLC). The product of this gene is a transcription
factor that represses ﬂowering. However, when the
wildtype FLC gene is absent, control by the autonomous
pathway is also eliminated but the effect of vernalization
is not. Thus it appears that the autonomous pathway
acts solely through controlling FLC expression, but
vernalization is able to promote ﬂowering through two
pathways: either through suppressing FLC expression or
through some yet-to-be-discovered FLC-independent
mechanism.
25.2.6 THREEE GENES DETERMINE
THE VERNALIZATION
REQUIREMENT IN CEREALS
This brings us to the question of whether vernalin, like
ﬂorigen, is a hormone. Or a better question to ask might
be: what is the molecular basis for vernalization? It has
actually been known for more than 30 years, primarily
through plant breeding experiments, that three genes
(VERNALIZATION 1, 2, and 3, or VRN1, VRN2, and
VRN3) have a major role in determining the vernaliza-
tion requirements in cereal grains. These genes have
now been isolated and characterized.
The VRN1 gene encodes a transcription factor and
is induced by a vernalization treatment. Furthermore,
there is a quantitative relationship between the amount
of VRN1 expressed in a vernalized plant and the amount
by which ﬂowering time is reduced under long days.
VRN2 represses ﬂowering under long days by block-
ing the expression of the ﬂoral stimulus FT. On the
other hand, VRN2 is itself repressed by VRN1. Vari-
eties of winter cereals that lack a functional copy of
VRN2 respond normally to long days without requiring
a prior cold treatment. VRN3 is the cereal equivalent
(called an ortholog) of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in
Arabidopsis.
A model to illustrate how these three genes inter-
act to control ﬂowering in winter wheat and barley
is presented in Figure 25.7. Prior to receiving a cold
treatment, the winter cereals are unable to respond to
long days because FT (or VRN3) expression is repressed
by the presence of VRN2. When the seeds are sown
in late summer or early autumn, the shoot apex devel-
ops vegetatively until winter, when VRN1 expression
is promoted. In the spring, growth is renewed; the
low-temperature-induced expression of VRN1 remains
high; and VRN1 suppresses any further expression of

sis. Long days (mediated by PHOTOPERIOD 1 (PPD1)
in cereals) are sensed by the CONSTANS gene (CO)
which activates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expres-
sion. VRN2 prevents ﬂoral induction before winter by
repressing FT expression. A low-temperature vernaliza-
tion treatment induces expression of VRN1, which
represses VRN2 and allows expression of FT under long
days. How the low temperature induces VRN1 expres-
sion isn’t known. In cereals, VRN1 also acts as a ﬂoral
meristem identity gene. In Arabidopsis, FT expression
is repressed by FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Flow-
ering proceeds under long days following vernalization
because the low temperature represses FLC expression.

VRN2. FT is then allowed to be expressed and the plant
now responds to long days by initiating ﬂoral primordia.
VRN2 is referred to as a ﬂoral integrator gene because,
as shown in the model, its central role is to integrate the
low temperature and photoperiod responses.
Flowering in the dicot Arabidopsis is also accelerated
by vernalization and the molecular mechanism is very
similar to that in the cereals. The principal difference
is that in Arabidopsis the gene FLOWERING LOCUS
C (FLC), not VRN2, is most directly responsible for
suppressing FT expression and maintaining the vegeta-
tive state of the apex. The repression of FLC, in turn,
appears to be regulated by low temperature through a
complex involving VRN1 and VRN2 (Figure 25.7).
25.3 FRUIT SET AND
DEVELOPMENT IS
REGULATED BY HORMONES
The fruit is the ﬁnal stage in the growth of the repro-
ductive organ. Botanically a fruit is a mature or ripened
ovary wall and its contents, although in some plants
other ﬂoral parts may become involved. There is a wide
diversity of fruits, depending on how the ovary develops.
In its simplest form, such as peas or beans, the fruit con-
sists of the seed or seeds enclosed within an enlarged but
dry ovary (the pod). Such fruits are classiﬁed as dehis-
cent fruits—dehiscent because at maturity the ovary wall
breaks open to free the seeds. The fruit of Arabidopsis is a
dry dehiscent fruit. Maize (Zea mays) is a non-dehiscent
dry fruit consisting of a single seed with its seed coats
fused with the dry ovary wall (a structure called the peri-
carp). Tomato is an example of a ﬂeshy fruit (actually a
berry) with an enlarged, ﬂeshy inner fruit wall. In some
species, a structure other than the ovary wall develops
as the fruit. These are called pseudocarpic fruits. A
strawberry is one example. A strawberry ‘‘fruit’’ actu-
ally consists of a number of individual one-seeded fruits
(called achenes) borne on the surface of an enlarged,
ﬂeshy receptacle. In many cases, it is clear that the fruit
undergoes considerable cell division and cell enlarge-
ment as well as signiﬁcant qualitative changes. These
changes are due largely to changes in hormone content.
Fruit
development,
maturation,
and
ripening
have been widely studied because of their biological
signiﬁcance—fruits protect the developing seed and
serve as a vehicle for dispersal of the mature seed—as
well as their practical importance as a signiﬁcant
component in human nutrition. The development,
maturation, and ripening of ﬂeshy fruits have received
the bulk of the attention over the years because of
problems associated with transportation, storage, and
other aspects of post-harvest physiology.
25.3.1 THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLESHY
FRUITS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO
FIVE PHASES
Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) has become a popular
model in which to study ﬂeshy fruit development, in part
because there are numerous mutants available and the
plant is easily transformed. With tomato as a model, the
life history of a fruit can be divided into ﬁve more-or-less
distinct phases. Phase I involves the development of the
ovary in preparation for fertilization and seed develop-
ment and ends with the decision to either abort further
development or to proceed with further cell division
and cell enlargement in the ovary walls. This decision
to proceed with ovary development is generally referred
to as fruit set. In phase II, or the initial phase of fruit
development, growth of the nascent fruit is due primar-
ily to cell division in the ovary walls. The cells thus
become small and dense, with very small vacuoles. Dur-
ing phase III, cell division effectively ceases and further
growth of the fruit is mostly by cell enlargement. Once
the fruit has reached its ﬁnal size, it enters phase IV,
or a period of ripening. In a ﬂeshy fruit like tomato,
ripening involves the development of color and ﬂavor
constituents (e.g., carotenoids, sugars, and acids) and a
softening of the tissue that render the fruit attractive to
animals. Tissue softening is due primarily to increased
activity of enzymes such as polygalacturonase (PG).
PG degrades the pectic substances that are found in the
middle lamella and which are responsible for cell-to-cell
adhesion. Finally, in phase V, senescence sets in and the
fruit begins the decay process.
As might be expected, all of the plant hormones
are active at various stages during fruit development
(Figure 25.8). During seed development and ﬁrst and
second phases of fruit development, auxins, cytokinins,
and gibberellins are all present and active. Cytokinin
level peaks during phase II, the period of most active cell
division. Auxin level peaks in early phase III, coinciding
with the initiation of cell enlargement, and then declines
as the fruit reaches mature size. A second surge in auxin
level occurs in the early stages of ripening, along with the
appearance of signiﬁcant levels of ethylene. The role of
gibberellins is not well understood, but they are probably
involved with cytokinins in initiating cell division and
with auxin in maintaining cell enlargement. Tomato is a
climacteric fruit and the burst in respiration is related to
the appearance of ethylene and the qualitative changes
in the fruit that represent ripening (see Chapter 21 for
a discussion of ethylene).
25.3.2 FRUIT SET IS TRIGGERED
BY AUXIN
Normally, successful pollination and fertilization of the
ovule by sperm nuclei are required for fruit set to occur.

In the absence of fertilization, ﬂowers fail to produce
seeds and, in most cases, the ﬂoral parts senesce without
forming fruits. The commitment to fruit set therefore
appears to rely on positive growth signals generated
prior to or immediately following fertilization. There
are some cases, however, in which unfertilized ﬂow-
ers go on to produce normal, but seedless, fruits. The
phenomenon of fruit development in the absence of
pollination and fertilization is known as virgin fruit-
ing or parthenocarpy (from parthenos, meaning virgin).
Parthenocarpy may occur naturally due to lack of polli-
nation or pollination that does not result in fertilization,
or from pollination followed by embryo abortion. Com-
mon examples of naturally parthenocarpic fruits are
bananas, navel oranges, most varieties of ﬁgs, pineapple,
and some seedless grapes. Studies involving either nat-
ural or induced parthenocarpy have had a major role in
helping to understand the initial phases of normal fruit
development, especially fruit set.
In the mid-1930s, it was found that pollen and
extracts of pollen were both a rich source of auxin and
could stimulate fruit set in unpollenated plants of the
family Solanaceae (e.g., tomato, peppers). Auxin induces
parthenocarpy in a small number of plants in other
families as well, particularly in the Cucurbitae (cucum-
ber, pumpkin), and Citrus. Parthenocarpy is a biological
curiosity—of what value is a seedless fruit—but it has
signiﬁcant economic implications as well. In California,
for example, synthetic auxins are used to stimulate fruit
set in early tomato crops, when cool night temperatures
would otherwise tend to reduce fruit set. Many other
fruits such as citrus and watermelons are more salable
in the seedless form. Gibberellins, either alone or in
combination, may also induce parthenocarpy in species
such as pear and citrus.
Other than pollen, at least one source of auxin for
fruit initiation is the seed. This was demonstrated in
a classic study of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) con-
ducted by J. P. Nitsch in the 1950s. Since the fruit of
a strawberry is the ﬂoral receptacle and the achenes
are borne on the surface, it is a simple task to remove
the seeds without damaging the underlying receptacle.
Nitsch found that removal of the seeds prevented fur-
ther development of the fruit, but supplying the fruit
with auxin restored normal development. Furthermore,
if some seeds were removed and others left in place,
the fruit would develop only in those regions where
the seeds were undisturbed (Figure 25.9). Other studies
conﬁrmed that strawberry achenes were a good source
of auxin.
Molecular approaches have followed up on the clas-
sical physiological studies and conﬁrmed that auxin from
the developing ovule has a central role in fruit set and
early fruit development. In general, these approaches
have taken advantage of artiﬁcially induced partheno-
carpic fruit development, either by (1) increasing the
synthesis of auxin in the ovule or ovary, or (2) by manip-
ulating auxin regulatory proteins such as AUX/IAA or
auxin response factors (ARF). (Refer to Chapter 18 for
the role of AUX/IAA and auxin response factors in
auxin-regulated responses.)

of seed (achenes) removal on the development of straw-
berry fruit. All but two rows of seeds were removed from

Subsequent fruit development was limited to the region

Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
One approach, for example, involves the Agrobac-
terium tumifaciens tumor-inducing genes iaaM and iaaH.
These are the genes that encode IAA biosynthesis and
cause the overproduction of IAA when Agrobacterium
invades host cells. IaaM and iaaH can be used to
construct a transgene by linking them to a promoter
that restricts their expression speciﬁcally to the ovule.
When this transgene construct is inserted into egg-
plant, tobacco, tomato, strawberry, and raspberry plants,
the constitutive production of IAA induces partheno-
carpic fruit development. Another gene that induces
parthenocarpy is the rolB gene, isolated from another
Agrobacterium species (Agrobacterium rhizogenes). The
rolB gene, again linked to a promoter speciﬁc for the
ovary and young fruit, induced parthenocarpy when
it was inserted into tomato. The mechanism of rolB
action is not known, but it appears to increase the tissue
sensitivity to auxin.
In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutants for the auxin
response factor gene ARF8 induce parthenocarpic fruit
development. ARF8 is a transcription factor that is
expressed primarily in the ovule and surrounding tis-
sues. Further experiments indicated that ARF8 acts as a
negative regulator for fruit set, i.e., it inhibits fruit set,
probably in combination with one or more AUX/IAA
proteins. Expression of the ARF8 gene is also switched
off after fertilization.
Most of the data for the role of auxin in fruit set is
consistent with the following model. Prior to pollina-
tion and fertilization, further development of the ovary
is blocked by the presence of AUX/IAA and/or ARF
repressor proteins such as ARF8. Pollination (and fertil-
ization of the ovules) induces an increase in the level of
auxin, thus leading to the auxin-mediated degradation
of the AUX/IAA proteins via the 26S-proteasome path-
way. This frees up the auxin-response factors to regulate
auxin-responsive genes that are necessary for fruit set
and subsequent fruit development.
25.3.3 RIPENING IS TRIGGERED BY
ETHYLENE IN CLIMACTERIC
FRUITS
In many, but not all, ﬂeshy fruits the metabolic and
visual changes that occur during the ripening process are
accompanied by a signiﬁcant burst in respiratory activity
or CO2 evolution, called the climacteric (Figure 25.10).
Examples of climacteric fruits include tomato, cucurbits
(cucumber and related fruits), banana, apple, peaches,
and plums. Nonclimacteric ﬂeshy fruits, which do not
show the CO2 burst, include strawberry, grape, cit-
rus, and all nonﬂeshy, or dry fruits such as Arabidopsis
or maize. The ripening process in climacteric fruits
has attracted a lot of research over the years because
of its economic importance and because just prior to
the respiratory burst there is a signiﬁcant increase in

production in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), a climac-

phase and steadily declines during the cell expansion and
maturation phase. It then rises sharply at the breaker
stage which identiﬁes the beginning of the ripening
phase. The CO2 ‘‘burst’’ is immediately preceded by a
signiﬁcant increase in the production of ethylene. (After

the production of ethylene (Figure 25.10). Moreover,
ethylene synthesis is also auto-catalytic. Once ethylene
production begins in one fruit, its production is stim-
ulated in surrounding fruit—hence the old axiom that
one rotten apple spoils the barrel. The role of ethylene
in fruit ripening has assumed signiﬁcant commercial
importance. For example, tomatoes, bananas, and other
climacteric fruits that have to be shipped any distance are
commonly picked at the mature green stage and then
ripened at their destination by gassing with ethylene
(Box 25.1).
The rate limiting steps in the biosynthesis of ethy-
lene are catalyzed by the enzymes ACC synthase (ACS)
and ACC oxidase (ACO) (see Chapter 21). In tomato
there are two ACS genes that are expressed in the fruit
and appear to be responsible for triggering ripening.
Both genes, LeACS1A and LeACS4, are under develop-
mental control and are induced at the onset of ripening.2
Furthermore, the induction of both genes is impaired
by mutations at either the ripening inhibitor (rin) or the
nonripening (nor) locus. In other words, fruits of tomato
plants carrying the rin and nor mutations do not produce
ethylene, do not exhibit a climacteric CO2 burst, and
do not ripen. The expression of the gene LeACS4 is
also controlled by ethylene itself and thus appears to be
responsible for regulating the autocatalytic production
of ethylene by a positive feedback system.
A large number of ethylene signaling components
have been identiﬁed in both Arabidopsis and tomato,

ETHYLENE:
IT’S A GAS!
Ethylene has been unwittingly used by humans for cen-
turies to stimulate fruit ripening. In ancient China,
harvested fruit was commonly ripened in rooms where
incense was being burned and in California in the early
twentieth century kerosene stoves were used to ripen
lemons. These practices worked because ethylene is a
common combustion product. For the same reason,
ethylene can still occasionally cause ethylene-mediated
growth problems for modern-day greenhouse opera-
tions that heat with natural gas.
Once the role of ethylene in ripening became
known, however, attention turned to methods for con-
trolling fruit ripening by preventing or delaying the
effects of ethylene production in climacteric fruits.
Apples, for example, are harvested in the fall but are
generally available in the markets throughout the year
because of controlled atmospheric storage. Controlled
atmospheric storage employs a combination of low tem-
perature, low ambient oxygen, and high ambient CO2.
Oxygen levels are generally reduced to 1 percent to
3 percent from the normal 21 percent. CO2 levels may
be increased up to 8 percent from the normal 0.035 per-
cent. These conditions lower both ethylene production
and the respiration rate of the fruit, and thus modu-
late, if not prevent, the ethylene-stimulated respiratory
climacteric.
including some ethylene receptors that are present only
in the fruit and are strongly induced during the ripen-
ing process. The challenge now is to understand how
these many components interact to form a coherent
signal transduction chain that regulates a multitude of
fruit-ripening genes.
SUMMARY
Flower initiation and development involves the action
of at least three sets of genes. These genes regulate
ﬂowering-time (including the circadian clock), ﬂoral-
meristem identity, and ﬂoral-organ identity.
Flowering-time mutants may ﬂower either later than or
earlier than the wildtype. Flowering time in Arabidopsis
is under the control of at least four different genetic
pathways. The long-day pathway genes constitute
the photoperiodic control system. The autonomous
pathway monitors the state of vegetative development
and initiates ﬂowering in response to endogenous
signals. The GA pathway involves a single gene,
mediated by gibberellin. The fourth pathway involves
a set of genes that normally repress ﬂowering. Mutants
in the repressor pathway ﬂower early.
Mutations in ﬂoral-identity genes disrupt the
transition to a ﬂoral meristem, while organ-identity
genes control the initiation of sepals, petals, stamens,
and carpels. Some ﬂoral-identity genes and organ-
identity genes overlap in time of expression and func-
tion. The ABC model for ﬂoral organ speciﬁcation
views the meristem as three overlapping developmen-
tal ﬁelds and identiﬁes the genes and combination
of genes that specify speciﬁc ﬂoral organs. Most of
the ﬂowering-time, ﬂoral-identity, and organ-identity
genes encode products that have some characteristics
of transcription factors.
Vernalization is the promotion of ﬂowering by
a period of low temperature. In the case of winter
annuals, such as cereals, vernalization changes the pho-
toperiodic behavior from daylength indifference to
a quantitative long-day response. Biennials typically
grow as a rosette until vernalized. The ﬂowering stem
then bolts (elongates) and responds as a long-day plant.
A temperature of approximately 0◦C to 5◦C, applied to
the actively growing apex of the plant for several weeks,
is required for vernalization to be effective. Tempera-
ture in vernalizable plants is perceived in the stem apex
and is transmissible. The use of ﬂowering-time mutant
has shown that vernalization operates independently of
the long-day, autonomous, and gibberellin-dependent
genetic pathways.
Fruits are classiﬁed as dry or ﬂeshy, depending
on the extent of ovary development following fer-
tilization. The development of ﬂeshy fruits such as
tomato and apple can be divided into ﬁve phases.
Phases II through IV represent the progression from
fruit set to the fully ripe fruit. Auxin is responsible
for fruit set, while auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins
are involved at various times until the fruit reaches
maturity. Fruit development is normally initiated by
a release of auxin associated with pollination and/or
fertilization of the ovule. Parthenocarpy is the devel-
opment of seedless fruits in the absence of pollination
or fertilization. Parthenocarpy can be induced in some
fruits by the application of auxin. Phase IV, or ripen-
ing, is characterized by the development of color and
ﬂavor constituents and softening of the fruit due to a
breakdown in the pectic substances that are involve in
cell-to-cell adhesion. Ripening in some ﬂeshy fruits is

446
Chapter 25 / Flowering and Fruit Development
accompanied by a marked increase in respiratory rate
and CO2 release (the respiratory climacteric) triggered
by ethylene. Ethylene release is catalyzed at least in part
by ACC synthase and ACC oxidase, two rate limiting
enzymes that are developmentally controlled. Ethy-
lene initiates a signal transduction chain that turns on
ripening genes.

Temperature: Plant Development
and Distribution
Plants are chemical machines and one universal char-
acteristic of chemical machines is their sensitivity to
temperature. Temperature, along with light and water,
is one of the most critical factors in the physical envi-
ronment of plants. This is especially so because plants,
unlike homeothermic animals, are not able to maintain
their tissues at a constant temperature. Environmental
temperature therefore exerts a profound inﬂuence on
cellular metabolism and, as a result, plant growth and
their geographic distribution.
All of the chemical machinery of nature—every
individual enzymatic reaction, every metabolic function,
every physiological process—has temperature limits
above and below which it cannot function and an
optimum temperature range where it proceeds at a
maximum rate. Temperature also affects the integrity
of cell structure (especially the structure and proper-
ties of membranes), limits the distribution of species in
space and time, and inﬂuences the direction of speciﬁc
developmental events.
Temperature as an environmental stress and ﬂow-
ering regulator has been discussed in earlier chapters. In
this chapter we will introduce some of the other ways in
which temperature is known to inﬂuence plant growth,
development, and distribution. Speciﬁc topics include:
•
the role of temperature in perennial plants, in par-
ticular its role in bud and seed dormancy, and
•
some examples of how temperature inﬂuences the
geographic distribution of plants.
26.1 TEMPERATURE IN THE
PLANT ENVIRONMENT
Of all the planets, the thermal environment on earth is
particularly ﬁt to give rise to and sustain life. This is
because life functions in an aqueous medium and the
range of temperatures encountered over most of the
earth’s surface generally ensures that sufﬁcient water
is maintained in the liquid state. The temperature
at which biological processes can occur is generally
limited by the freezing point of water on the low
side and the irreversible denaturation of proteins on
the high side. Between these two extremes, a plot of
growth versus temperature for individual organisms
assumes the shape of an asymmetric bell curve, similar
to that for individual enzyme reactions or multiple
enzyme-catalyzed metabolic sequences (Figure 26.1).
In fact, the temperature curve for growth of an

organism effectively represents a composite of the
temperature curves for photosynthesis, respiration, and
other critical metabolic processes. Growth curves thus
exhibit, just as do individual metabolic and enzyme
reactions, the three cardinal temperatures (minimum,
optimum, and maximum). Just as the actual values of
cardinal temperatures vary between different metabolic
processes, the actual values of cardinal temperatures
for growth curves will vary from species to species.
Assuming other factors are not limiting, these cardinal
temperatures generally deﬁne the temperature range
over which growth is possible. It is close to the extremes
of this range that plants experience temeprature stress
as described in earlier chapters.
Green plants probably ﬁrst evolved in the tropical
regions, not so much because of warmer temperatures
(although that may have been a factor), but because the
temperatures there were relatively stable. With time,
plants gradually migrated into the temperate and polar
regions as they adapted to wider variations in temper-
ature on a daily and seasonal basis. Green plants are
now found in regions as extreme as the Antarctic conti-
nent and the northern tundra, where temperatures over
much of the year are near or below freezing, and in the
warmest places on earth such as Death Valley (Califor-
nia), where summer temperatures commonly approach
or even exceed 50◦C.
Plants and related organisms may be broadly clas-
siﬁed according to their ability to withstand tempera-
ture. Those that grow optimally at lower temperatures
(between 0◦C and 10◦C) are called psychrophiles. The
psychrophiles include primarily algae, fungi, and bac-
teria. Higher plants generally fall into the category of
mesophiles, whose optimum temperatures lie roughly
between 10◦C and 30◦C. Thermophiles will grow
unhindered at temperatures between 30◦C and 65◦C,
although there are reports of cyanobacteria growing at
temperatures as high as 85◦C. These temperature ranges
apply to hydrated, actively growing organisms. Dehy-
drated organisms and organs, such as resurrection plants
(Selaginella lepidophylla) and dry seeds with moisture con-
tents as low as 5 percent, are able to withstand a much
broader range of temperatures for extended periods of
time.
Plants in nature are subjected to a complex mosaic
of ﬂuctuating air and soil temperature regimes such that
it is very difﬁcult to study the effects of temperature in a
natural setting. Air temperature, for example, ﬂuctuates
widely, and often rapidly, depending on the time of
day, cloud cover, season, and other factors. Soil is a
major heat sink as it absorbs and stores solar energy
during the day. At night, some of this heat is radiated
back into the atmosphere, which both cools the soil
and warms the surface. Soil temperature also varies with
the soil structure, organic content, and other physical
characteristics as well as slope and aspect (the direction
it faces with respect to the sun).
Both air and soil temperatures have an impact on
plant growth. Air temperature inﬂuences leaf tempera-
ture and therefore the rates of photosynthesis, respira-
tion, and other metabolic reactions. On the other hand,
soil temperature inﬂuences germination, root develop-
ment, and nutrient uptake. For example, maize seeds will
not germinate below about 10◦C and the time required
for germination of winter wheat increases linearly with a
decrease in soil temperature below 25◦C. Several inves-
tigators have shown that the uptake of nutrients such
as calcium, boron, nitrogen, and phosphorous increases
with increasing temperature. In cold soils, soybean roots
spread out closer to the soil surface, while in warmer
soils the roots grow more deeply. The stem apex (or,
crown) of many grasses is situated at or near the soil
surface, which means that leaf development in grasses
is probably inﬂuenced more by soil temperature than
by air temperature. The study of soil temperature and

26.2 Bud Dormancy
449
its inﬂuence on growth and development is of more
than passing interest because soil temperature can be a
signiﬁcant factor in determining agricultural yield.
While the temperature in tropical climes is relatively
stable, plants growing in temperate regions and closer
to the poles are subject to more or less predictable vari-
ations in temperature on a daily and seasonal basis. It is
perhaps not too surprising that plants have evolved ways
to incorporate this information in their developmen-
tal and survival strategies. Plants use this information
to ensure dormancy of buds, tubers, and seeds, and to
modify their ﬂowering behavior, all of which appear to
be keys to survival over periods unfavorable to normal
growth and development.
26.2 BUD DORMANCY
One aspect of development that is strongly inﬂuenced
by temperature is dormancy. Dormancy is a term that is
applied to tissues such as buds, seeds, tubers, and corms
that fail to grow even though they are provided with
adequate moisture and oxygen at an appropriate temper-
ature. Dormancy is a difﬁcult process to study because
it is a progressive process, often occurring in degrees.
Buds that are just entering dormancy, for example,
may be stimulated to renew growth rather easily. On
the other hand, buds that have developed full dormancy
may require prolonged or severe treatment to break dor-
mancy and renew growth. Dormancy in some organs
may be enforced by other organs in the plant or by
external factors. As a result, dormancy terminology has
been quite inconsistent and can be confusing. Terms
such as quiescence, rest, true dormancy, and imposed or
enforced dormancy have been used by different authori-
ties to describe various states or conditions. However, it
is most convenient to group dormancy mechanisms into
one of three types: paradormancy, in which the inhibi-
tion of growth arises from another part of the plant (e.g.,
apical dominance); ecodormancy, in which growth is
imposed by limitations in the environment (e.g., lack of
water); and endodormancy, in which the dormancy is
an inherent property of the dormant structure itself (see
Lang, 1987).
Bud dormancy is an example of endodormancy.
A bud is a shortened, very compact terminal or axillary
shoot axis in which the internodes have failed to elongate
and leaves or ﬂoral parts have not enlarged. The whole
is enclosed in a set of modiﬁed leaves, called bud scales
(Figure 26.2). Bud scales serve a protective function,
both insulating the bud and preventing desiccation.
Many popular fall ﬂowering bulbs are also large buds
(Box 26.1).
The growth of deciduous perennial plants typical of
temperate regions, where warm summers alternate with
cold winters, is cyclical; such plants normally undergo

a cessation of active growth on an annual basis. Both
vegetative and ﬂoral buds formed in the latter part of the
summer or early fall will survive over the winter in a dor-
mant condition and do not normally renew their growth
until more favorable temperature conditions return in
the spring. However, it is not the low temperature itself
that inhibits bud growth. Dormancy mechanisms are
well under way before the cold temperatures arrive and,
similar to vernalization, a period of low temperature is
required before bud regrowth can occur in the spring.
Just as vernalization prevents precocious ﬂowering in
the fall, bud dormancy prevents precocious bud growth,
ensuring that the meristems enclosed within the bud are
able to survive the adverse conditions of winter.
In order to ensure survival of the plant, dormancy
mechanisms must be in place before the arrival of unfa-
vorable conditions. This means that the plant must be
able to anticipate climatic change. Mechanisms must also
be in place to ensure that the buds do not break dor-
mancy until such time that environmental conditions are
appropriate to sustain normal growth and development.
Premature breaking of buds during an unseasonably
warm period in the winter, for example, could have seri-
ous consequences for the survival of the plant. In short,
dormancy is a precisely regulated requirement for the
perennial habit, cued by factors in the environment and
maintained, and ultimately broken, by speciﬁc metabolic
changes in the organism.
Dormancy studies have focused on three principal
questions. (1) What are the environmental signals that
stimulate the onset of dormancy and how are they

with numerous leaves surrounding one or more cen-
tral meristems (Figure 26.3). The leaves are modiﬁed
for food storage. In an onion, for example, these leaves
are the portion of the bulb that we eat. Corms, rep-
resented by plants such as crocus and gladiolus, are
solid shortened stems with numerous buds systemati-
cally arranged under a protective covering of paper-thin
leaves.
The most popular spring-ﬂowering bulbs and

and require an extended cold period before the buds
break dormancy and ﬂower in the spring.
perceived? (2) What metabolic changes are responsible
for the reduced activity? (3) What signals the startup of
renewed growth at the appropriate time?
26.2.1 BUD DORMANCY IS INDUCED
BY PHOTOPERIOD
Plants anticipate seasonal change by monitoring pho-
toperiod. The onset of dormancy in buds is a typical
short-day response, coincident with leaf fall, decreased
cambial activity, and increased capacity to withstand
low temperature, or cold hardiness In temperate woody
species, the short days and decreasing temperatures of
late summer and autumn induce the leaf primordia to
form bud scales instead of leaves. The formation of scales
is followed by the induction of cold hardiness and the
cessation of cell division in the meristem. Once growth
has ceased and meristem has entered dormancy, the
meristem becomes insensitive to any growth-promoting
signals.

26.3 Seed Dormancy
451
Like ﬂowering, the short-day photoperiod signal
that initiates the onset of dormancy is perceived in
the leaves. It should not be surprising, then, that the
same players that detect photoperiod for the control
of ﬂowering are also involved in controlling dormancy.
For example, when the genes CONSTANS (CO) and
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) were over-expressed in
transgenic poplar trees, bud growth did not stop fol-
lowing exposure to short days. On the other hand,
down-regulation of FT triggers the onset of dormancy.
Thus it appears that the combination of CO and FT
represents a universal photoperiodic signal module. It is
not known, however, which gene(s) or gene product(s)
FT interacts with to trigger bud dormancy.
Relatively little is also known about the physio-
logical state of dormant buds except that during their
formation the bud primordia accumulate storage mate-
rials such as starches, fats, and proteins. Dormant buds
are further characterized by low respiratory activity, a
signiﬁcant loss of water, and the inability to grow even
if temperature, oxygen, and water supply are adequate.
There have been reports that the endogenous gibberellin
levels decline at the onset of dormancy and that some
buds may be released from dormancy if treated with
gibberellin or cytokinins, but, otherwise, little is known
about the hormonal status of dormant buds.
26.2.2 A PERIOD OF LOW
TEMPERATURE IS REQUIRED
TO BREAK BUD DORMANCY
Although induction of bud dormancy is coincident with
decreasing temperature and short days, the principal
role of temperature appears to be in breaking dor-
mancy. Most dormant buds have a chilling requirement
that must be met before the cells are capable of renewed
cell division and enlargement. Studies on the chilling
requirement for breaking dormancy have concentrated
on commercial fruit species and deciduous ornamen-
tals. This is because in the northern hemisphere, the
chilling requirement largely determines the southerly
limits of cultivation for these plants. The process is
especially critical in fruit trees since the ﬂower bud that
bears fruit are initiated in the previous summer. The
bud then over-winters and, having satisﬁed its chilling
requirement, ﬂoral development continues the follow-
ing spring. Apple trees, for example, will not bear fruit
without a cold winter.
Temperatures near or just above freezing appear to
be most effective at breaking dormancy. The amount
of chilling required varies with species, cultivar, and
even location of the buds on the trees. Species such as
apple (Malus pumila), pear (Pyrus communis), and cherry
(Prunus sps.) require approximately 7 to 9 weeks of
exposure to temperatures below 7◦C in order to over-
come dormancy. Others may require up to 22 weeks
(American plum, Prunus americana) or as few as four
to six weeks (apricot, Prunus armeniaca). Persimmons
(Diospyros kaki ) require only four days of low tem-
perature and so can be grown successfully much further
south than other fruit trees. The temperature in temper-
ate regions often varies widely throughout the winter,
but this generally poses no problem for dormant tissues.
In most cases, buds and other dormant tissues are able
to sum the periods of cold and will not renew growth
until the appropriate amount of cold treatment has been
accumulated.
There is wide variation in the chilling requirement
of different species and ecotypes (or, genetic races) of
maple. More than 12 weeks of chilling are required to
break dormancy in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) col-
lected in southern Canada, while those collected from
the warmer regions near the southern limits of its dis-
tribution required only a few weeks of low temperature.
Similar results were obtained for seedlings of red maple
(Acer rubrum).
Very little is known about the molecular mech-
anisms involved in breaking bud dormancy. What is
known comes largely from the study of various species
of poplar (Populus sps.), birch (Betula papyrifera), and
apple where recent efforts have been directed toward
characterizing the expression of dormancy-responsive
genes. In one species of poplar (P. tricocarpa), for
example, a gene homologous with FLOWRING LOCUS
C (FLC-like gene or PtFLC) has been implicated in
bud dormancy. FLC is the ﬂoral suppressor that is
down-regulated in Arabidopsis during a vernalization
treatment (Chapter 25). PtFLC is expressed in the shoot
apices of poplars grown under long days but, like FLC in
Arabidopsis, PtFLC declines in dormant buds during the
low temperature period. By analogy with vernalization,
the down-regulation of PtFLC could be a key compo-
nent in the cold-mediate release of bud dormancy in
poplar. In another study, it was found that expression
of the gene KNAP2 increased during the onset of dor-
mancy in apple buds, but was down-regulated during the
breaking of dormancy. KNAP2 is a KNOTTED-like
homeobox protein; a group of master control proteins
that have a fundamental role in development of plants
and animals alike (see Chapter 20).
26.3 SEED DORMANCY
26.3.1 NUMEROUS FACTORS
INFLUENCE SEED DORMANCY
Seeds are in many respects similar to buds—they consist
of a small embryonic axis (along with some storage tis-
sues) enclosed by a series of membranes, collectively
called the seed coat. The seed coat serves a pro-
tective function much as bud scales do. Its presence

452
Chapter 26 / Temperature: Plant Development and Distribution
often suppresses germination by restricting the uptake
of water and exchange of oxygen, it mechanically lim-
its the expansion of the embryo and, in some cases,
contains inhibitors that prevent growth of the embryo.
These limitations can be removed and the germination
of many seeds accelerated by mechanically disrupting or
removing the seed coat, a process called scariﬁcation.
In the laboratory, scariﬁcation may be accomplished
with ﬁles or sandpaper. In nature, abrasion by sand,
microbial action, or passage of the seed through animal
gut will accomplish the same end. Seed coats can be very
tough. Uniformity and rate of germination of morning
glory (Pharbitis nil), cotton, and some tropical legume
seeds, for example, can be improved by soaking the dry
seed in concentrated sulfuric acid for up to an hour.
Scariﬁcation by passage through animal gut no doubt
occurs as a result of the acidic conditions in the gut.
As with buds, dormancy in seeds refers to the situa-
tion wherein the embryo fails to grow because of physi-
ological or environmental limitations. These limitations
commonly include the inability of water or oxygen to
penetrate the seed coat. Seeds of some plants, par-
ticularly in the family Leguminoseae, have specialized
structures that control seed moisture content. E. Hyde
described a structure in seeds of lupine (Lupinus arboreus)
that functions as a hygroscopically operated check-valve
and that limits imbibition of water by the seed. Because
water cannot pass through the unscariﬁed seed coat,
the only possible route of entry is through a small
pore, called the hilum (Figure 26.4). When the water

seed of Lupinus arboreus (tree lupine) showing the hilum,

seed. The counter palisade is a group of thick-walled
cells lying on the outer surface of the cuticle. When
the seed moisture content is higher than the moisture
level in the ambient air, the hilum ﬁssure is open and
water escapes from the tracheid cluster. When the water
ambient moisture level is higher than inside the seed,
the counter palisade cells swell and close off the hilum
ﬁssure in order to prevent the seed from rehydrating.
(From Hyde, E. O. C. 1954. Annals of Botany 18:241.

content of the seed is higher than ambient, the hilum
is open to permit the exit of water and allow the seed
to dry. But when the moisture content outside the seed
is higher than inside, cells surrounding the hilum swell,
thus closing off the pore and preventing the uptake of
water. In addition, as the seed dries out the permeability
of the seed coat to water also decreases and the dormancy
of the seed increases. Other seeds have pores that are
blocked with a plug, called the strophiolar plug, which
must be mechanically dislodged before water and oxygen
can enter.
There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest
that seed coats also interfere with gas exchange, oxygen
uptake in particular. As noted above, removal of the seed
coat often leads to a signiﬁcant increase in respiratory
consumption of oxygen. Measurements of the oxygen
permeability of seed coats have been made and there
is general agreement that permeability is very low in
those seeds tested. However, it is not always clear that
limited oxygen permeability is the primary cause of
dormancy. The complexity of the situation and problems
of interpretation are well illustrated by studies of the
genus Xanthium, or cocklebur.
A cocklebur contains two seeds: an upper, dormant
seed and a lower, nondormant seed. Dormancy of the
upper seed can be overcome either by removing the seed
coat or by subjecting the intact seed to high oxygen ten-
sion. The inference is that seed coat permeability in the
dormant seed limits the supply of oxygen to the embryo
and thus prevents germination. However, several other
observations have cast doubt on this conclusion. There
are, for example, no measurable differences between
the dormant and nondormant seed with respect to the
permeability of the seed coat to oxygen. Moreover, the
rate of oxygen diffusion through the seed coats is more
than sufﬁcient to support measured rates of oxygen con-
sumption by the embryos inside. Clearly, dormancy of
the upper seed in Xanthium cannot be due to limited
permeability of the seed coat to oxygen. Why then,
do the upper, dormant seeds require a higher oxygen
level to elicit germination? It appears that the seed
coat is a barrier, not to the uptake of oxygen but to
the removal of an inhibitor from the embryo. Aqueous
extracts of Xanthium seeds have revealed the presence of
two unidentiﬁed inhibitors, based on tests of the extracts
in a wheat coleoptile elongation assay. The same two
inhibitors are found in diffusate collected from isolated
embryos placed on a moist medium, but not in diffusate
from seeds surrounded by an intact seed coat. Thus ger-
mination in the dormant seed appears to be prevented by
the presence of these inhibitors and the seed coat serves
as a barrier that prevents those inhibitors from being
leached out. The oxygen requirement can be explained
by the observation that high oxygen tension reduces the
quantity of an extractable inhibitor, presumably by some
oxidative degradation.

26.3 Seed Dormancy
453
Even the role of inhibitors in seed dormancy is
not clear. Along with hormones such as auxins and
gibberellins, a large number of inhibitors have been
identiﬁed in seeds, fruits, and other dispersal units.
These include hormones (ABA), unsaturated lactones
(coumarin), phenolic compounds (ferulic acid), various
amino acids, and cyanogenic compounds (i.e., com-
pounds that release cyanide) characteristic of apple and
other seeds in the family Rosaceae (see Chapter 27).
The simple presence of an inhibitor does not, how-
ever, prove its role in dormancy. The inhibitors could
be localized in tissues not directly involved in growth
of the embryo or otherwise sequestered so as to pre-
clude any role in preventing germination. Evidence in
support of a role for inhibitors is generally limited to
leaching experiments such as that described above for
Xanthium. In some cases, dormancy can then be restored
by exposing the leached seed to the putative inhibitor.
In order to clearly establish whether an inhibitor has an
active role in regulating germination, it is necessary to
establish whether inhibitor levels in the seed correlate
with the onset and termination of dormancy. In spite
of the voluminous literature relating inhibitors to dor-
mancy, there is very little critical support for a direct
role. For the present, evidence for the imposition and
maintenance of dormancy by inhibitors remains largely
circumstantial.
26.3.2 TEMPERATURE HAS A
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT
ON SEED DORMANCY
Temperature has a signiﬁcant impact on termination of
dormancy in many seeds. In fully imbibed seeds, both
alternating and low (chilling) temperatures are known
to terminate dormancy. Many seeds, even though fully
hydrated, will not germinate when maintained under
constant temperature. They require instead a diurnal
cycle of ﬂuctuating temperature. The required temper-
ature differential between the high and low temperature
is often not great, ranging from a few degrees to perhaps
5◦C or 10◦C, depending on the species. Germination of
broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolia) seeds, for example,
exceeds 90 percent when the temperature differential is
about 10◦C and when the high temperature is given for
16 hours each day.
The reaction to alternating temperature is complex
and poorly understood. In Rumex, alternating treatments
are effective only when the high temperature is greater
than 15◦C. Also, when the high temperature is given
for only 8 hours each day, a differential of only 5◦C is
required to induce 90 percent germination. Although in
some cases the effect of alternating temperature appears
to be localized in the embryo itself, there are many
well-documented cases where the effect of alternating
temperature is mechanical. It is, in effect, a form of
scariﬁcation, releasing the seed from some kind of seed
coat–imposed dormancy.
It has long been known that freshly shed seeds
of many herbaceous and woody species have dormant
embryos that can be induced to growth only by a
prolonged low-temperature treatment. These include
maples (Acer sps.), hazel (Corylus), and many genera
in the family Rosaceae (pear, Pyrus; apple, Malus;
hawthorne,
Crateagus).
Normally,
following
the
required period of low temperature, the seeds will not
germinate until temperatures are more favorable for
embryo emergence and seedling development. In most
cases this requirement ensures that the seed shed in late
summer or fall will not germinate until spring.
The exposure to low temperature that satisﬁes
this germination requirement is known as either
pre-chilling, or stratiﬁcation. The latter term has its
origin in the horticultural practice of layering seeds
in moist sand or peat moss and exposing them to low
temperature for several weeks or months to induce
germination. It is important that the pre-chilling
requirement for release of seed dormancy not be
confused with vernalization, which is a cold treatment
to an already germinated seedling, as discussed earlier
in the previous chapter. As with breaking of bud
dormancy, temperatures near freezing but below 10◦C
are most effective for terminating seed dormancy. The
optimum for most species is near 5◦C. In a population
of seeds, the effectiveness is also a function of the length
of the cold treatment (Figure 26.5).
It is presumed that seeds undergo some metabolic
changes during the period of low temperature, gener-
ally referred to as after-ripening, but the exact nature
of these changes is unclear. There is some evidence
for redistribution of carbon and nitrogen from the
endosperm to the embryo, a decline in the inhibitor
content, and a rise in gibberellin and cytokinin content.

Gibberellin treatments will substitute at least partially
for the cold requirement in many seeds, just as they do
in other cold-requiring systems.
26.4 THERMOPERIODISM
IS A RESPONSE TO
ALTERNATING
TEMPERATURE
Growers have long recognized the beneﬁcial effect on
plant growth of lowering greenhouse temperatures dur-
ing the night. This effect has been particularly well
documented by the work of F. Went and his colleagues
in the 1940s. Went found that tomatoes (Lycopersicum
esculentum) grown at constant temperatures of 26◦C and
18◦C grew poorly and (at 26◦C) failed to produce fruit.
Plants maintained under alternating conditions of 26◦C
during the day and 18◦C at night grew vigorously and
produced a maximum number of fruit. In order to be
effective, the day–night differential had to be synchro-
nized with the light–dark cycle. If the temperature cycle
was inverted, with the high temperature falling dur-
ing the dark period, growth was even poorer than at a
constant 26◦C. To describe this phenomenon, F. Went
coined the term thermoperiodism.
It is now recognized that many, but certainly not
all, plants perform better under regimes with a similar
temperature differential. For those that do, the effect
is primarily on vegetative development, in contrast to
photoperiodism where the inﬂuence is primarily on ﬂo-
ral production. In some plants, such as potato (Solanum)
and tobacco (Nicotiana), low night temperature leads
to a decline in shoot–root ratio, due to preferential
root growth. Stems of Begonia also respond to ther-
moperiodism. It has been reported that stem elongation
was inhibited by low daytime temperatures alternating
with high nighttime temperatures (14◦C/24◦C) when
compared with constant daytime/nighttime tempera-
tures (19◦C/19◦C). On the other hand, stem elongation
was promoted by alternating high daytime temperatures
with low nighttime temperatures (24◦C/19◦C).
Another example of the effect of temperature dif-
ferentials is illustrated by ﬂoral movements in members
of the Liliaceae, such as tulip (Tulipa) and Crocus. Flow-
ers in these plants normally open during the day and
close at night, but these movements are only slightly
affected by light. Instead, the perianth segments or
tepals1 respond to changing temperature. This is a
form of thermonasty, involving a differential growth
response of cells on the inner (or adaxial) and outer
1Tepal is the collective term for sepals and petals when the
two share a common morphology and are indistinguishable
one from the other.
(or abaxial) surfaces of the tepals. The optimum tem-
perature for growth differs by approximately 10◦C
between the two surfaces (Figure 26.6). The opening
of the ﬂower in response to an increase in tempera-
ture (Figure 26.6A) corresponds to a sharp but transient
increase in the growth rate of cells on the inner surface
(Figure 26.6B). Conversely, closure following a drop
in temperature (Figure 26.6C) appears to be caused
by a similar change in the growth rate of cells on the
outer surface (Figure 26.6D). Other investigators have
reported opening following a rise of as little as 0.2◦C
for Crocus and 1◦C to 2◦C for tulip. There are lower
limits—Crocus, for example, will not open at tempera-
tures below 8◦C. Thus if the spring days are very cold,
the ﬂowers may not open at all. Thermonasty is not lim-
ited to ﬂower parts; it has also been demonstrated for the
stem angle of Phryma leptostachya, a perennial Asian herb.
26.5 TEMPERATURE
INFLUENCES PLANT
DISTRIBUTION
Temperature is thought to be one of the most impor-
tant factors limiting the worldwide distribution of plants.
Distribution limits often reﬂect temperature character-
istics of major metabolic processes, especially photosyn-
thesis. The temperature range compatible with growth
of higher plants lies generally between 0◦C and 45◦C,
although there are some plants that exceed either of
these limits and within those limits temperature compat-
ibility is very much species dependent. Various cultivars
of wheat (Triticum vulgare), for example, will grow at
temperatures from near zero to over 40◦C, although the
temperature optimum for growth falls in the range of
20◦C to 25◦C.
As a general rule, temperatures that are optimum
for growth reﬂect the geographical region in which the
species originated. Thus, plants native to warm regions
either require or perform better at higher temperatures
than those that originated in cooler areas of the world.
The optimum for maize (Zea mays), a plant of tropical
origin, is in the range 30◦C to 35◦C and it will not grow
below 12◦C to 15◦C. Garden-cress (Lepidium sativum),
a temperate herb, will grow at temperatures as low as
2◦C but its maximum temperature for growth is 28◦C.

metabolic effects not only limit distribution, but have
signiﬁcant economic implications as well. Cotton
(Gossypium), for example, is a southern crop in part
because cool night temperatures in northern latitudes
adversely affect ﬁber cell wall thickening, and the
northern limits for maize production are very much
limited by its inability to grow at lower temperatures.

However, advances in agronomy and plant breeding
have moved the limits for maize steadily northward
over the past several decades.
Although extensive studies of temperature effects
have been conducted using controlled environment
facilities, it is difﬁcult to carry out ﬁeld studies with
any degree of precision. This is because the leaves and
roots of plants are commonly subject to a mosaic of
ﬂuctuating temperature regimes. Leaf temperature, for
example, depends not only on daily and seasonal vari-
ations in atmospheric temperature, but such factors as
cloud cover, wind speed, their position in the canopy,
and so forth. Root temperature depends on depth in
the soil, soil moisture content, soil structure, and other
physical parameters of the soil. Thus, in a natural envi-
ronment, individual leaves and roots may be responding
to distinctly different microclimates, each with its own
unique temperature regime.
In one study, a variety of species native to either
the cool coastal regions of northern California or the
hot, dry desert of Death Valley were transplanted into
experimental gardens in both locations. At the Death
Valley site summer air temperatures commonly reach
50◦C, a temperature that is lethal for many organisms.
By contrast, average daily maximum temperatures at the
coastal site were less than 20◦C. Plants at both sites were
irrigated and fertilized so that water supply and nutri-
ents were not limiting factors and their performance
with respect to growth and survival was assessed on a
regular basis. On the basis of their growth responses, the
plants could be grouped into three main categories: (1)
those that were unable to survive the summer months;
(2) those that survived but grew slowly during the sum-
mer; and (3) those that grew most rapidly during the
summer months (Table 26.1).
Virtually all of the species that are native to the
cool coastal climate were unable to survive the high
desert temperatures. Of the plants tested, only Tide-
stromia oblongifolia, a deciduous C4 perennial native
to Death Valley, was able to thrive in the summer
desert heat. Strikingly, T. oblongifolia was unable to
survive the cool coastal temperatures. At the other
extreme, Atriplex glabriuscula, a C3 annual native to
the coastal region, thrived in the coastal garden but
died in the desert in spite of ample irrigation. Two
clones of the C4 species Atriplex lentiformis were also
tested—one native to the coastal regions of southern
California and one that occurs naturally in Death Val-
ley. In terms of biomass production, the desert clone
outperformed the coastal clone in the Death Valley
garden; their relative performance was reversed in the
coastal garden. The relative success of A. glabriuscula and

T. oblongifolia in the two environments appeared to
correlate with their capacity to assemble a compe-
tent photosynthetic apparatus. For example, the relative
growth rates of the two species under laboratory con-
trolled conditions compared favorably with the response
of photosynthetic rate to temperature under the dame
conditions. Both the maximum relative growth rate and
maximum rate of photosynthesis occurred at approx-
imately 25◦C for A. glabriuscula and at approximately
40◦C to 45◦C for T. oblongifolia.
Other species are more ﬂexible with regard to
temperature. Several species, including A. hymenelytra,
Nerium oleander, and the creosote bush (Larrea divari-
cata), were able to survive in both the desert and cool
coastal habitats, although their growth rate was not as
great as either A. glabriuscula or T. oblongifolia. Most
of their growth was in fact accomplished during the
spring or fall when temperatures were less extreme.
In all three cases, growth at low or high tempera-
ture under controlled conditions caused an appropriate
shift (by as much as 15◦C) in the optimum temper-
ature for photosynthesis. More importantly, however,
there was no signiﬁcant change in the maximum rate
of photosynthesis, only the temperature at which the
maximum rate occurred. Thus some plants exhibit a
signiﬁcant degree of phenotypic plasticity with respect
to photosynthesis and temperature, which enables them
to survive a wider range of climatic conditions. Plants
restricted to one climate or another apparently do not
exhibit the same degree of plasticity in their metabolic
reactions.
On a worldwide basis, temperature is the most
important factor affecting the relative distribution of C3
and C4 grasses. On a smaller scale, this is illustrated by
the distribution of plants along an elevational gradient,

FIGURE 26.7 Adiabatic lapse and air temperature on the
windward and leeward sides of a mountain. Unsaturated
air rises from point A to point B at the adiabatic lapse rate
of 1◦C/100 m. At point B the air becomes saturated with
water vapor and cools more slowly at a wet lapse rate of
0.4◦C/100 m. The dry lapse rate applies as the air warms
on its descent to D and is no longer saturated. This
warming trend is responsible for the Chinook winds that
blow out of the Rocky Mountains or the Foehn winds of
alpine Europe. (From Rosenberg, N. J. et al. 1983. Micro-
climate: The Biological Environment. New York: Wiley.

such as up a mountainside where temperature decreases
with increasing altitude. This decrease in temperature
with elevation is called the adiabatic lapse. As air rises,
it expands and cools. The term adiabatic refers to the
fact that cooling occurs without an exchange of heat.
In the case of an elevational gradient, cooling as the
air rises is entirely due to expansion of the air mass
as the pressure decreases. The heat content and, conse-
quently, the temperature of a unit volume of air mass are
therefore lower. It is because of adiabatic lapse that the
temperature gradient remains stable and the less-dense
cooler air does not descend from high in the mountains
to displace the warmer air in the valleys. The adiabatic
lapse rate for dry air is constant at about 1◦C/100 m
elevation (Figure 26.7). The lapse rate for moist air
(wet lapse rate) is more variable and lower than the dry
lapse rate because condensation of water vapor releases
heat.
P. W. Rundel has studied the distribution of C3
and C4 grasses along an elevational gradient in Hawaii.
Rundel found a sharp transition in the distribution
of the two photosynthetic types at about 1400 m. C4
grasses were predominant at warmer, drier elevations
below 1400 m, while in the cooler, moist environment
above 1400 m the C3 grasses were predominant. The
midpoint of the transition zone is the elevation where
the maximum daily temperature for the warmest month
of the year is approximately 21◦C. Similar distributions
of C4 and C3 grasses have been reported in other

elevational studies carried out in Africa and Costa Rica,
and in latitudinal gradients in North America. In the
latter case, the transition temperatures are slightly lower,
but the principle is still valid.
SUMMARY
All living organisms can be broadly classiﬁed accord-
ing to their ability to withstand temperature. Psy-
chrophiles grow optimally at temperatures of 0◦C to
10◦C; mesophiles, 10◦C to 30◦C; and thermophiles,
30◦C to 65◦C. Most higher plants are mesophiles,
although plants will generally survive temperatures
between 0◦C and 45◦C. Temperature limits generally
reﬂect the freezing point of water on the low side and
denaturation of protein on the high side.
Plants also use temperature as a cue in their devel-
opmental and survival strategies. Decreasing tempera-
ture in the autumn in concert with photoperiod induces
dormancy in buds, characterized by low respiratory rate
and an inability to grow even if temperature, oxygen,
and water supply are adequate. Most dormant buds
have a chilling requirement that must be met before
dormancy can be broken and growth renewed. Dor-
mancy is also a property of many seeds, a situation
in which the seed fails to germinate because of envi-
ronmental and physiological limitations. Seed coats
may interfere with water uptake or oxygen uptake, or
may contain inhibitors that must be broken down or
leached out before germination can proceed. Many
seeds require alternating temperatures or a period of
low temperature (pre-chilling or stratiﬁcation) to break
dormancy.
Some plants, such as tomato, grow poorly at con-
stant temperature, but require alternating day–night
temperatures (thermoperiodism) for optimum growth.
In others, such as tulip and Crocus, changing tem-
perature regulates the opening and closure of ﬂoral
petals.
Temperature is a principal factor in the distribu-
tion of plants, or biogeography. Survival in extreme
environments appears to be due to intrinsic differences
between species in the temperature dependence of their
growth responses and photosynthetic metabolism. In
a study of elevational gradients up a mountainside, a
sharp transition was found between C4 species (in the
warmer, drier, lower elevations) and C3 species (in the
cooler, moister, higher elevations). It is clear that tem-
perature stability of principal metabolic pathways is a
signiﬁcant determinant in plant distribution.

Secondary Metabolites
The sum of all of the chemical reactions that take place
in an organism is called metabolism. Some aspects
of metabolism, such as the metabolism of carbon and
nitrogen assimilation and energy conversions, have been
addressed in earlier chapters. Most of that carbon, nitro-
gen, and energy ends up in molecules that are common
to all cells and are required for the proper functioning of
cells and organisms. These molecules, e.g., lipids, pro-
teins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, are called primary
metabolites (see Appendix). Unlike animals, however,
most plants divert a signiﬁcant proportion of assim-
ilated carbon and energy to the synthesis of organic
molecules that may have no obvious role in normal
cell function. These molecules are known as secondary
metabolites.
In this chapter, we examine some of the broader
aspects of secondary metabolites. The focus will be the
biosynthesis, physiology, and ecological roles of four
major classes of secondary metabolites:
•
terpenes, including hormones, pigments, essential
oils, steroids, and rubber,
•
phenolic compounds, including coumarins, ﬂavo-
noids, lignin, and tannins,
•
glycosides, including saponins, cardiac glycosides,
cyanogenic glycosides, and glucosinolates, and
•
alkaloids.
Some secondary metabolites are also involved in
defense against invading pathogens, a subject that is
also addressed in this chapter.
27.1 SECONDARY METABOLITES:
A.K.A NATURAL PRODUCTS
The
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
metabolites is not always easily made. At the biosyn-
thetic level, primary and secondary metabolites share
many of the same intermediates and are derived from
the same core metabolic pathways (Figure 27.1). In
the strictest sense, however, secondary metabolites
are not part of the essential molecular structure or
function of the cell. Secondary metabolites generally,
but not always, occur in relatively low quantities and
their production may be widespread or restricted to
particular families, genera, or even species. Also known
as natural products, these novel phytochemicals were
of little interest to biologists because of their apparent
lack of biological signiﬁcance. They were known,
however, to have signiﬁcant economic and medicinal
value and were thus of more than a passing interest to
natural products chemists. Natural products have found
use in antiquity as folk remedies, soaps, and essences.
They include drugs and other medicinal products,

against microbial or insect attack.
27.2 TERPENES
27.2.1 THE TERPENES ARE
A CHEMICALLY AND
FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE
GROUP OF MOLECULES
With nearly 15,000 structures known, terpenoids are
probably the largest and most diverse class of organic
compounds found in plants. As discussed earlier in
Chapter 19, the unifying feature of terpenes is that
they are generally lipophilic polymers based on the sim-
ple 5-carbon unit 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, or isoprene,
which is derived via either the mevalonic acid pathway
or the MEP pathway (Chapter 19, Section 19.3).
Terpenes can be grouped into several classes, based
on the number of carbon atoms (Figure 27.2). This
large chemical diversity arises from the number of basic
units in the chain and the various ways in which they
are assembled. Formation of cyclic structures, addi-
tion of oxygen-containing functions, and conjugation
with sugars or other molecules all add to the possible
complexity. The name terpenoid derives from the fact
that the ﬁrst compounds in the group were isolated
from turpentine (Ger. terpentin), an essential oil (chieﬂy
pinene) distilled from the resins of several coniferous
trees.
The terpene family includes hormones (gibberellins
and abscisic acid): the carotenoid pigments (carotene and
xanthophyll); sterols (e.g., ergosterol, sitosterol, choles-
terol) and sterol derivatives (e.g., cardiac glycosides);
latex (the basis for natural rubber); and many of the
essential oils that give plants their distinctive odors and
ﬂavors. Cytokinin hormones and chlorophyll, although
not terpenes per se, do contain terpenoid side chains. It
is apparent from this list that many terpenes have signiﬁ-
cant commercial value as well as important physiological
roles. Many terpenes and terpene derivatives may be
considered primary metabolites. The hormones abscisic
acid and gibberellin, the carotenoid and chlorophyll
pigments, and sterols (steroid alcohols) all play signiﬁ-
cant roles in plant growth and development. The vast
majority of terpenes, however, are secondary metabo-
lites, many of which appear to act as toxins or feeding
deterrents to herbivorous insects.
27.2.2 TERPENES ARE CONSTITUENTS
OF ESSENTIAL OILS
Many plants, such as citrus, mint, Eucalyptus, and vari-
ous herbs (sage, thyme, etc.), produce complex mixtures
of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and terpenoids, known
generally as essential oils (essence, as in perfume).
Essential oils are responsible for the characteristic odors
and ﬂavors of these plants but they are also known
to have insect-repellant properties. The terpenes and
terpene derivatives found in essential oils are predom-
inantly hemi-, mono-, and sesquiterpenes, which can
be moderately to highly volatile. Several examples are
shown in Figure 27.3. In most plants, the essential oils
are synthesized in special glandular trichomes (hairs) on
the leaf surface (Figure 27.4), although the essential oils

resins of certain conifers, for example, also accumu-
late mixtures of terpenes, including the monoterpenes,
α- and β-pinene, and myrcene (Figure 27.5).
27.2.3 STEROIDS AND STEROLS ARE
TETRACYCLIC TRITERPENOIDS
Steroids and sterols are synthesized from the acyclic
triterpene squalene, although they generally are modi-
ﬁed and have fewer than 30 carbon atoms. Steroids with
an alcohol group, which is the case with practically all
plant steroids, are known as sterols. The most abundant
sterols in higher plants are stigmasterol and sitosterol
(Figure 27.6), which often make up more than 70 percent
of the total sterols. However, plants also contain a large
number of the more than 150 other sterols known to
occur in nature. Plant sterols include cholesterol which,
although widespread in occurrence, is present in only

thought they might serve to deter feeding by herbivores.
trace quantities. The extremely low level of cholesterol
allows plant oils to be marketed as ‘‘cholesterol-free.’’
Sterols are constituents of plant membranes, which
is perhaps their most important known function in
plants. Because sterols are planar molecules, their pack-
ing properties are different from phospholipids that
make up the bulk of the membrane bilayer. Sterols pack
more tightly than phospholipids and therefore tend to
increase the viscosity and enhance the stability of mem-
branes. Otherwise, little is known about the function of
sterols in plants. Unlike the steroid hormones in ani-
mals, there is no known hormonal role for sterols in
plant development. Some sterols may have a protective
function, such as the phytoecdysones, which have a
structure similar to the insect molting hormones. When
ingested by insect herbivores, phytoecdysones disrupt
the insect’s molting cycle. Other sterols are present as
glycosides, which give rise to a number of interest-
ing and economically signiﬁcant secondary products.
Steroid glycosides are discussed below.
27.2.4 POLYTERPENES INCLUDE
THE CAROTENOID PIGMENTS
AND NATURAL RUBBER
Larger terpenes include the tetraterpenes (40-carbon)
and the polyterpenes. The principal tetraterpenes are
the carotenoid family of pigments (Chapter 6). The only
important isoprene derivatives with a greater molecu-
lar mass than the tetraterpenes are rubber and gutta.
Rubber is a polymer consisting of up to 15,000 isopen-
tenyl units. The polymer may be linear, as shown in
Figure 27.7, or cross-linked into more complex conﬁg-
urations. The only difference between rubber and gutta
is the conﬁguration of the double bonds. In rubber the

cidal properties.
double bonds are all cis conﬁgurations, while in gutta
the double bonds are all trans.
In the plant, rubber occurs as small particles sus-
pended in a milky-white emulsion called latex. Latex
production is widespread in plants, with estimates rang-
ing from a few hundred to several thousand species that
produce latex in some form. The principal commer-
cial source is Hevea brasiliensis, a rubber tree native to
the Amazon rainforest. Others include the ornamen-
tal rubber tree (Ficus elastica), milkweed (Asclepias), and
the Russian dandelion (Taraxacum Kok-saghyz). Latex
contains about 30 to 40 percent rubber and 50 per-
cent water. The balance is a complex mixture of resins,
terpenes, proteins, and sugars. In most plants, latex is

produced in the phloem, accumulating in a series of
long, interconnected vessels called laticifers.
The best-known source of gutta is a desert shrub,
Parthenium argentatum, which grows in northern Mexico
and southwestern United States. Parthenium (commonly
known as guayule) may contain as much as 20 percent
latex by weight, which is stored not in laticifers but in
the vacuoles of stem and root cells. Guayule was at one
time a signiﬁcant commercial source of gutta for use in
rubber products. However, while a single rubber tree, if
properly tapped, can continue to produce for up to 30
years, guayule plants must be harvested (and, of course,
replanted) annually.
Finally, there is a connection between terpenes
and air pollution. Many of the essential oils, especially
hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, are
highly volatile and are given off in large quantities by
plants, particularly during warm weather. Known gen-
erally as volatile organic carbon (VOC), these natural
emissions from plants contribute to the formation of
haze and cloud, and are involved in the formation of
toxic tropospheric ozone.
27.3 GLYCOSIDES
Some of the more interesting, if not important,
derivatives synthesized by plants are glycosides. Most
glycosides are thought to function as deterrents to
herbivores. The term glycoside (Gr. glykys, sweet)
refers to the bond formed (called a glycosidic bond)
when

molecule containing a hydroxyl group. Sugars may form
glycosidic bonds with other sugars, such as when linked

464
Chapter 27 / Secondary Metabolites
together to form polysaccharides, or with hydroxyl
groups on noncarbohydrate molecules, such as steroids
or amino acids. The sugar most commonly found in
glycosides is glucose, although speciﬁc glycosides often
contain rare sugars.
Three particularly interesting glycosides are the
saponins, the cardiac glycosides (cardenolides), and the
cyanogenic glycosides. A fourth family, the glucosino-
lates, although technically not glycosides, are a similar
structure and so are included here.
27.3.1 SAPONINS ARE TERPENE
GLYCOSIDES WITH DETERGENT
PROPERTIES
Saponins may take the form of (1) steroid glycosides,
(2) steroid-alkaloid glycosides, or (3) triterpene glyco-
sides (Figure 27.8). Saponins may also occur as aglycones
(e.g., the terpene without the sugar), which are known
as sapogenins. In much the same way as soap, which
is the sodium salt of a fatty acid, the combination of
a relatively hydrophobic triterpene with a hydrophilic
sugar gives saponins the properties of a surfactant or
detergent. When agitated in water, saponins form a sta-
ble soapy foam. The name saponin is in fact derived from
Saponaria (soapwort), which at one time was employed
as a soap substitute.
The principal role of saponins appears to be as
a preformed defense against attack by fungi. Evidence
indicates that saponins form complexes with sterols con-
taining an unsubstituted 3-β-hydroxyl group. When the
saponins react with sterols in the membranes of invading
fungal hyphae, the result is a loss of membrane integrity.
In a classic example of one-upmanship, however, many
pathogenic fungi have developed strategies, such as the
development of detoxifying enzymes, for circumvent-
ing this defense mechanism. Oat (Avena), for example,
produces a triterpenoid saponin, avenacin A-1, which
is localized in the root epidermal cells and effectively
protects against an invasion by a fungal pathogen (Gaeu-
mannomyces graminis var. tritici) that infects the roots of
both wheat (Triticum) and barley (Hordeum). However,
another strain of G. graminis (var. avenae) produces an
enzyme, avenacinase, that detoxiﬁes avenacin A-1 and
FIGURE 27.8 Saponins are triterpenoids or steroids
containing one or more sugar units. Medigenic
acid glucoside is a triterpenoid saponin from alfalfa
(Medicago sativa). Disogenin glycoside is a steroidal
saponin isolated from clover (Meliotus spp.). The
addition of a hydrophilic sugar group to a normally
hydrophobic terpenoid gives saponins surfactant
properties similar to soap.

allows the pathogen to invade oats as well as wheat
and rye.
The effect of saponins on eukaryotic membranes
is highly nonspeciﬁc and it is not clear how plants
protect their own membranes against the deleterious
effects of their own saponins. One possibility is that the
saponins are stored in the form of a biologically inac-
tive molecule, called a bisdesmosidic saponin, which
has two sugar chains rather than one. When under
attack, the inactive form may be converted to the active
monodesmosidic form by hydrolytic removal of the
second sugar chain. Alternatively, biologically active,
monodesmosidic saponins may be sequestered in vac-
uoles or organelles whose membranes contain a high
proportion of sterols with a protected 3-β-hydroxyl
position.
The effect of saponins on animals is somewhat vari-
able. While not signiﬁcantly toxic to mammals, saponins
do have a bitter, acrid taste and will cause severe gas-
tric irritation if ingested. Saponins will hemolyze red
blood cells, however, if injected into the bloodstream.
This action is presumably because of their detergent
properties and their ability to disrupt membranes gen-
erally. On the other hand, saponins are highly toxic to
ﬁsh and have been used as ﬁsh poisons. Saponins have
also been implicated in reports of livestock poisoning.
Alfalfa saponins, for example, can cause digestive prob-
lems and bloating in cattle. At the same time, there are
reports that saponins contained in alfalfa sprouts will
lower serum cholesterol levels. Commercially, saponins
from the bark of Quillaja saponaria have been used as
surfactants in photographic ﬁlm, in shampoos, liquid
detergents, toothpastes, and beverages (as emulsiﬁers).
The saponin glyscyrrhizin from licorice (Glyscyrrhiza
glabra) has been used in medicines and as a sweetener
and ﬂavor-enhancer in foods and cigarettes.
27.3.2 CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES ARE
HIGHLY TOXIC STEROID
GLYCOSIDES
The cardiac glycosides (or, cardenolides) are struc-
turally similar to the steroid saponins and have similar
detergent properties. They are distinguished from other
steroid glycosides by the presence of a lactone ring
(attached at C17) and the rare sugars (found almost
exclusively in this group of steroids) that form the gly-
coside (Figure 27.9). Like the saponins, cardenolides
occur naturally as either the glycoside or the aglycone
(or genic).
The cardenolides have a wide distribution; they have
been recorded in more than 200 species representing
55 genera and 12 families and are a principal agent
in accidental poisonings of humans. Perhaps the best
known is digitalis, a mixture of cardenolides extracted
from the seeds, leaves, and roots of purple foxglove,
Digitalis purpurea or Grecian foxglove, D. lanata. The
two principal cardenolides in digitalis are digitoxin and
its close analog digoxin. Digitalis is also the source of a
saponin, digitonin.
Since the late eighteenth century, digitalis has been
used for its therapeutic value in treating heart conditions
such as atherosclerosis. Because they disrupt the heart
muscle Na+/K+-ATPase pumps (hence the appellation
cardiac), cardenolides are highly toxic to vertebrates. The
extreme toxicity of cardenolides has long been exploited
by African hunters, who coated their arrows and spears
with cardenolide-rich extract from plants. In therapeutic
use, however, carefully regulated doses can both slow
and strengthen the heartbeat. Unfortunately, the lethal
and therapeutic doses are very close, so the therapy must
be carefully monitored.
Other common sources of cardenolides are the
milkweeds, Asclepias and Calotropis. These two species
are known as ‘‘milkweeds’’ because they produce a
milky-white, cardenolide-rich latex. The milkweeds are
particularly interesting because they are the principal
host for ovipositing monarch butterﬂies. The emerg-
ing larvae feed on the milkweed leaves and sequester
the cardenolides without ill effect. The cardenolides
are retained through metamorphosis and are present
in the adult monarchs. When birds, such as blue jays,

attempt to feed on monarchs, the accumulated carede-
nolides induce an emetic reaction that forces the bird to
vomit. The bird then wisely avoids attempting to feed
on monarch larvae for some time.
27.3.3 CYANOGENIC GLYCOSIDES
ARE A NATURAL SOURCE OF
HYDROGEN CYANIDE
It might seem odd that plants synthesize chemicals capa-
ble of releasing deadly hydrogen cyanide or prussic acid
(HCN), but more than 60 different cyanogenic com-
pounds of plant origin have been described from more
than a dozen plant families. Predominant among these
are the cyanogenic glycosides. A common cyanogenic
glycoside is amygdalin (Figure 27.10), which occurs
in many representatives of the family Rosaceae. It is
found in the seeds of apples and pears and in the bark,
leaves, and seed of the stone fruits (apricot, peaches,
plums, cherries). Most cyanogenic glycosides appear to
be derived from one of four amino acids (phenylala-
nine, tyrosine, valine, and isoleucine) or from nicotinic
acid. Intact cyanogenic glycosides are not themselves
toxic, but when the plant is damaged by a herbivore,
the glycoside undergoes an enzymatic breakdown and
cyanide is released. Cyanide, a noncompetitive inhibitor
of cytochrome oxidase, is acutely toxic.
The enzymatic breakdown of cyanogenic glycosides
is a two-step process (Figure 27.10). First, the sugars are
released by the enzyme β-glycosidase. The resulting
hydroxynitrile is moderately unstable and will slowly
decompose, liberating HCN in the process. Normally,
however, decomposition is accelerated by a second
enzyme, hydroxynitrile lyase. Enzymatic release of
cyanide does not normally occur in intact plants because
the enzymes and the substrate are spatially separated.
In some cases, separation is maintained within the
cell, but in others, the enzymes are in one cell and
the cyanogenic glycosides in another. In Sorghum, for
example, the cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin is synthe-
sized and stored in epidermal cells, while the glycosidase
and lyase enzymes are found in the mesophyll cells. Only
when the tissue is crushed and the contents of the two
cells are mixed will cyanogenesis occur.
There is some evidence that the presence of
cyanogenic glycosides deters feeding by insects and
other herbivores, although most animals have the
ability to detoxify small quantities of cyanide. Clearly
the effectiveness of cyanogenic glycosides as a deterrent
depends on many factors, such as the amount present,
the rate of release of cyanide, and the ability of the
animal to detoxify. The level of cyanogenic glycosides
in plants is highly variable, inﬂuenced by both genetic
control and environmental stress. The latter is a
concern when using Sorghum for livestock forage.
Dhurrin accumulates rapidly and can cause livestock
poisoning when Sorghum plants are stressed by drought
or frost.
Many
common
food
plants
naturally
contain
cyanogenic glycosides in concentration sufﬁciently low
that they are not normally a health hazard. These
include soy and other beans (Fabaceae); apples, apricots,
peaches, plums, and other fruits in the family Rosaceae;
and ﬂax seed (Linum), which is a popular health
food. One food source that contains large amounts
of cyanogenic glycosides is cassava, a potato-like root
of the tropical plant Manihot esculenta. Cassava, also
known as manioc or, in North America, tapioca, is a
major source of starch for millions of people in tropical
countries. However, poisoning is avoided by careful
preparation of the plant. This includes grinding the
root and expressing the ﬂuids, or boiling the root in
several changes of water.
27.3.4 GLUCOSINOLATES ARE SULFUR-
CONTAINING PRECURSORS
TO MUSTARD OILS
Glucosinolates are found primarily in the mustard
family (Brassicaceae) and related families in the order
Capparales. They are precursors to the mustard oils,
an economically important class of ﬂavor constituents
FIGURE 27.10 Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside

that gives the pungent taste to condiments such as
mustards and horseradish as well as the distinctive ﬂavor
of cabbages, broccoli, and cauliﬂower.
All glucosinolates are thioglucosides (thio, sulfur)
with the general structure shown in Figure 27.11A.
The sugar is always glucose. The diversity encoun-
tered in structure and properties is due to the R
group, which may range from a simple methyl group
to large linear or branched chains containing aromatic
or heterocyclic structures. The biological activity of
glucosinolates depends primarily on their hydrolysis to
mustard oils (Figure 27.11B). Hydrolysis of glucosi-
nolates is catalyzed by an enzyme called myrosinase
(a thioglucosidase). The hydrolysis product is unstable
and immediately undergoes a rearrangement to form a
thiocyanate or isothiocyanate. Like the cyanogenic gly-
cosides, glucosinolates are spatially separated from the
hydrolytic enzymes so that the mustard oils are normally
formed only when the cells are disrupted, allowing the
enzyme and substrate to come together. As with other
defense compounds, some herbivores are deterred or
repelled by the presence of glucosinolates in a plant,
while others have adapted to use the glucosinolates
or mustard oils as attractants to stimulate feeding and
ovipositing.
Glucosinolates, or rather their absence, have had
a signiﬁcant impact on the oilseed industry. Rape seed
(principally Brassica napus) is a good source of veg-
etable oil, but its high content of glucosinolate together
with high erucic acid (a 22-carbon fatty acid) gives the
oil undesirable taste and poor storage properties. New
strains have been bred with low glucosinolates and erucic
acid. These strains, called canola in order to distin-
guish them from normal rape, are now an economically
important oil source.

many phenolics appear to be involved in plant/herbivore
interactions. Some (e.g., lignin) are important structural
components, while others appear to be simply metabolic
end-products with no obvious function.
27.4.1 SHIKIMIC ACID IS A KEY
INTERMEDIATE IN THE
SYNTHESIS OF BOTH AROMATIC
AMINO ACIDS AND
PHENYLPROPANOIDS
The biosynthesis of most phenylpropanoids begins
with the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine,
and tryptophan. These aromatic amino acids are,
in turn, synthesized from phosphoenolpyruvate and
erythrose-4-phosphate by a sequence of reactions
known as the shikimic acid pathway (Figure 27.13).
The shikimic acid pathway is common to bacteria,
fungi,
and plants,
but is not found in animals.
Phenylalanine and tryptophan are consequently among
the 10 amino acids considered essential for animals
(including humans) and represent the principal source
of all aromatic molecules in animals. Tyrosine is not
classiﬁed as essential because animals can synthesize it
by hydroxylation of phenylalanine.
Synthesis of the aromatic amino acids begins with
the condensation of one molecule of erythrose-4-P,
from the pentose-phosphate respiratory pathway, with
one molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from gly-
colysis. The resulting 7-carbon sugar is then cyclized
and reduced to form shikimate. Shikimate is then con-
verted to chorismate, a critical branch point that leads
either to phenylalanine and tyrosine or to tryptophan.
The shikimic acid pathway is an excellent example of
feedback regulation, where the concentrations of prod-
uct molecules regulate the ﬂow of carbon through
key enzymes. The ﬁrst key enzyme in the pathway
is the aldolase that catalyzes the initial condensation
erythrose-4-P with PEP. Aldolase is inhibited by all
three end-products: tyrosine, phenylalanine, and trypto-
phan. In a similar manner, the conversion of chorismate
to prephenate is inhibited by both phenylalanine and
tyrosine, while the conversion of chorismate to anthrani-
late is inhibited by tryptophan.
Another
step
of
interest
in
the
pathway
is
the second step in the conversion of shikimate to
3-enolpyruvylshikimate-5-P. The enzyme 3-enolpy-
ruvylshikimate-5-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) is
inhibited
by
the
herbicide
glyphosate
(marketed
commercially as RoundUp™). Plants treated with
glyphosate will die because they are unable to synthesize
the
aromatic
amino
acids
and
their
derivatives,
especially
protein.
Thus
glyphosate-treated
plants
effectively die of protein starvation.
27.4.2 THE SIMPLEST PHENOLIC
MOLECULES ARE ESSENTIALLY
DEAMINATED VERSIONS OF THE
CORRESPONDING AMINO ACIDS
Synthesis of most secondary phenolic products begins
with the deamination of phenylalanine to cinnamic acid
(Figures 27.14, 27.15). The enzyme that catalyzes this
reaction, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), is a
key enzyme because it effectively controls the diversion
of carbon from primary metabolism, such as protein
synthesis, into the production of phenylpropanoids.
An alternate route, the deamination of tyrosine to
p-OH-cinnamic acid, appears to be limited largely, if
not exclusively, to grasses.
Cinnamic
acid
is
readily
converted
to
p-OH-cinnamic acid by the addition of a hydroxyl
group (Figure 27.15). The sequential addition of
hydroxyl and methoxy groups gives rise to caffeic acid
and ferulic acid, respectively. None of these four simple
phenols appear to accumulate to any extent. Their
principal function appears to be as precursors to more
complex derivatives such as coumarins, lignin, tannins,
ﬂavonoids, and isoﬂavonoids.
27.4.3 COUMARINS AND COUMARIN
DERIVATIVES FUNCTION AS
ANTICOAGULANTS
The coumarins (Figure 27.16) are a widespread fam-
ily of lactones called benzopyranones. More than 1,500
examples are known, from more than 800 species of
plants. The biosynthesis of coumarins is not well under-
stood because the putative enzymes and their genes
have yet to be isolated. It is most likely, however, that
the two simplest forms, coumarin and 7-OH-coumarin
(umbelliferone), are formed by an ortho-hydroxylation
of cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid, respectively, fol-
lowed by ring closure (Figure 27.17).

way and phosphoenolpyruvate from glycolysis. Enzymes indicated as 1, 2, and 3 are
subject to feedback inhibition and thus are important regulatory enzymes in the path-
way. Those enzymes are (1) 3-deoxyarabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase;

(EPSPS), which catalyzes the second of three reactions in the conversion of shikimate
to chorismate, is inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate. Glyphosphate thus prevents
the synthesis of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine.

As a family, coumarins are noted for their roles
as antimicrobial agents, feeding deterrents, and germi-
nation inhibitors. The simplest example, coumarin, is
the product that gives new-mown hay its characteristic
pleasantly sweet odor. Coumarin is also a constituent of
Bergamot oil, an essential oil that is used to ﬂavor pipe
tobacco, tea, and other products. While coumarin itself
is only mildly toxic, many of its derivatives can be highly
toxic. One derivative, dicoumarol (Figure 27.16), is
typically found in moldy hay or silage containing sweet
clover (Meliotus spp.). Dicoumarol causes fatal hemor-
rhaging in cattle by inhibiting vitamin K, an essential
cofactor in blood clotting. The discovery of dicoumarol
in the 1940s led to the development of a synthetic
coumarin derivative, Warfarin™, widely used as a rodent
poison. Scopoletin (Figure 27.16), the most prevalent
coumarin in higher plants, is often present in seed coats.
It is suspected of being a germination inhibitor that
must be leached out of the seed coat before germination
can proceed.
The most toxic coumarin derivatives are synthe-
sized not by plants, but by fungi. The fungus Aspergillus
ﬂavus commonly infects foodstuffs such as livestock
feed, peanuts, and maize (the latter especially fol-
lowing damage by the European corn borer). The
invading Aspergillus produces a group of mycotoxins
called aﬂatoxins (from A. ﬂa. + toxin), believed to be
the most potent and carcinogenic of natural toxins
(Figure 27.16). Deaths have been recorded from inges-
tion of maize contaminated with as little as 6 to 15 parts
per billion (or, 6 to 15 μg kg−1) of aﬂatoxin. Aﬂatox-
ins have multiple effects: they are mutagenic; they bind
to DNA and prevent RNA transcription; they compete
with hormones for binding sites, impair the immune sys-
tem, and damage the liver and kidney. Peanut products
are a common source of aﬂatoxin poisoning in humans
and all raw, shelled peanuts in the United States must be
inspected for their aﬂatoxin content. Aﬂatoxins in cattle
feed is another particular problem. When cattle ingest
the toxin, they convert it to another equally toxic form
and secrete it into the milk.

Gymnosperm
lignin

mainly of coniferyl alcohol subunits while angiosperm
lignin is a mixture of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol
subunits.
The
biosynthesis
of lignin is not well
understood, but it is believed that the alcohols are
oxidized to free radicals by the ubiquitous plant enzyme,
peroxidase. The free radicals then react spontaneously
and randomly to form polymeric lignin.
Lignin is found in cell walls, especially the sec-
ondary walls of tracheary elements in the xylem. In spite
of its abundance (second only to cellulose), the struc-
ture of lignin is not well understood. Lignin is a very
large polymer; it is insoluble in water and most organic
solvents, and impossible to extract without consider-
able degradation. Moreover, the three basic monomers
may link together in a variety of ways to form a multi-
branched, three-dimensional structure. The complexity
is so great that, like snowﬂakes, each lignin ‘‘molecule’’
may be unique. For the same reason that monolignols
are able to form extensive linkages with each other,
the lignin polymer is able to form numerous cross-links
with other cell wall polymers. The result is a high degree
of mechanical strength and rigidity in ligniﬁed woody
stems. Lignin is in fact what makes wood, wood!
Although the principal function of lignin is struc-
tural, it has also been implicated as a defensive chemical.
Lignin itself is not readily digested by herbivores and,
because it is covalently linked to cellulose and cell wall
xyloglucans, its presence decreases the digestibility of
these polymers as well. Also, when fungal pathogens
enter host cells, they do so by enzymatically degrading
the host cell wall. Several studies have shown that lignins
and other phenolic derivatives accumulate at the site of
fungal penetration, presumably slowing the rate of cell
wall degradation.
27.4.5 FLAVONOIDS AND STILBENES
HAVE PARALLEL BIOSYNTHETIC
PATHWAYS
As noted earlier in Chapter 6, ﬂavonoids include the
anthocyanin pigments that serve to attract insect polli-
nators and the isoﬂavonoids that function as phytoalex-
ins, or antibacterial and antifungal agents. Flavonoids
have a role in symbiont recognition between rhizo-
bia and host roots. It has also been demonstrated that
exposure of plants to UV radiation increases the con-
tent of ﬂavonoids, suggesting that ﬂavonoids such as
kaempferol may offer a measure of protection by screen-
ing out harmful UV-B radiation.
Flavonoids represent a very large class of pheno-
lic derivatives (more than 4,500 representatives are
known), with a variety of functions. Biochemically, how-
ever, all ﬂavonoids share a common structure consisting
of three rings, labeled A, B, and C (Figure 27.19).

have been reported from more than 70 plant fami-
lies. Coumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone)
are derived from cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid,
respectively. Scopoletin is probably the most widespread
coumarin in plants. Dicoumarol is a powerful anticoag-
ulant found in moldy hay. Dicoumarol derivatives and
synthetic coumarins are commonly used to thin blood
in cardiac patients. Aﬂatoxin B1, a mycotoxin, is among
the most carcinogenic and toxic of naturally occurring
compounds.
Both ring B and the 3-carbon bridge that makes up
ring C are derived from the shikimic acid pathway via
phenylalanine and p-coumaric acid. The six carbons
that make up the A ring are derived from malonic
acid, in the form of a malonyl-coenzyme A complex,
malonyl-CoA. (Malonyl-CoA is also a principal inter-
mediate in fatty acid synthesis.) The key enzyme is

committed step in ﬂavonoid biosynthesis. CHS cat-
alyzes the stepwise condensation of three molecules of
malonyl-CoA with one molecule of p-coumaryl-CoA
to form 4,2′,4′,6′-tetrahydroxychalcone, or, naringenin
chalcone. A chalcone is a C6—C3—C6 pattern wherein
ring C is not yet closed. The enzyme chalcone isomerase
then catalyzes the closure of ring C to form narin-
genin. Naringenin is the precursor to ﬂavonols such
as kaempferol and quercitin as well as the anthocyanin
pigments.
Stilbenes are a group of C6—C2—C6 compounds
that have a chemical defense role, primarily against
fungal invasions of heartwood (the distinctively colored
core of the tree). Stilbenes are one of several phenyl-
propanoid derivatives that are continually infused into
the heartwood of trees after the cells have been ligniﬁed.
A defensive role is suggested by the localized deposition
of stilbenes in regions of sapwood as well, when the sap-
wood is attacked by insects of pathogenic fungi. The role
of stilbenes in this case appears to be one of preventing
the spread of the invading insect or pathogen.
Stilbene biosynthesis, like the ﬂavonoids, involves
the sequential condensation of malonyl-CoA units with
either cinnamoyl-CoA or p-coumaroyl-CoA, except
that the enzyme catalyzing the reaction is stilbene
synthase.
27.4.6 TANNINS DENATURE PROTEINS

The name tannin is derived from the historic practice
of using plant extracts to ‘‘tan’’ animal hides, that is,
to convert hides to leather. Such extracts contain a
mixture of chemically complex phenol derivatives that
bind to, and thus denature, proteins. For years, the most
common test for tannins was the capacity to precipitate

gelatin (a protein). Two categories of tannins are now
recognized: condensed tannins and hydrolyzable tan-
nins. Condensed tannins are polymers of ﬂavonoid units
linked by strong carbon-carbon bonds. These bonds
are not subject to hydrolysis but can be oxidized by
strong acid to release anthocyanidins. The basic struc-
tural unit of hydrolyzable tannins is a sugar, usually
glucose, with its hydroxyl groups esteriﬁed to gallic acid
(Figure 27.20). Gallic acid residues are in turn joined to
form an extensively cross-linked polymer.
Like other phenolics, the biological role of tannins
is not clear. Tannins do appear to deter feeding by many
animals when tannin-free alternatives are available.
This effect could be related to the astringency—a sharp,
somewhat unpleasant sensation in the mouth—for
which tannins are noted. The astringent property of
tannins is a component in the ﬂavor of many fruits
as well as drinks such as coffee, tea, and red wine.
As well, tannins tend to suppress the efﬁciency of
feed utilization, growth rate, and survivorship. The
conventional interpretation has been that tannins
reduce digestibility of dietary protein, presumably by
binding with protein in the gut. Other studies, however,
have cast doubt on this interpretation, suggesting that
tannins may be toxic in other, yet unknown, ways.

INSECTS AND DISEASE
27.5.1 SOME TERPENES AND
ISOFLAVONES HAVE
INSECTICIDAL AND
ANTI-MICROBIAL ACTIVITY
One of the better-known and commonly used natural
insect toxins is pyrethrin, a monoterpene ester that is
produced in the ovaries of ﬂowers of Chrysanthemum
(or, Pyrethrum) cineraiifolium (Figure 27.21). C. cinerai-
ifolium is widely cultivated in Montenegro, Japan, and
eastern Africa, where the unexpanded ﬂower heads are
dried and powdered. Pyrethrin is a neurotoxin that

membrane. Pyrethrins are popular organic insecticides
because they have a relatively low mammalian toxic-
ity. Natural pyrethrins are also readily inactivated by
oxidation and so do not persist in the environment.
Many other terpenes, while not insecticides per se,
do help plants to repel invasions by insects. Many plants
respond to insect attack by producing additional quan-
tities of toxic or repellant metabolites. Unfortunately,
in some cases chemical deterrents can turn against the
plant. As insects evolve resistance, they are able to use
the same chemical as a host-recognition cue to help
them locate hosts they can feed on without ill effect.
At least one group of ﬂavones, the isoﬂavones,
has become known for its anti-microbial activities
(Figure 27.22). Isoﬂavones are one of several classes
of chemicals of differing chemical structures, known
as phytoalexins, which help to limit the spread of
bacterial and fungal infections in plants. Phytoalexins
are generally absent or present in very low concentra-
tions, but are rapidly synthesized following invasion by
bacterial and fungal pathogens.
The details of phytoalexin metabolism are not yet
clear. Apparently a variety of small polysaccharides,
glycoproteins and proteins of fungal or bacterial origin,
serve as elicitors (L. elicere, to entice) that stimulate
the plant to begin synthesis of phytoalexins. Studies
with soybean cells infected with the fungus Phytophthora
indicate that the fungal elicitors trigger transcription

of mRNA for enzymes involved in the synthesis of
isoﬂavones. The production of phytoalexins appears to
be a common defense mechanism. Isoﬂavones are the
predominant phytoalexin in the family Leguminoseae,
but other families such as Solanaceae, appear to use
terpene derivatives.
27.5.2 RECOGNIZING POTENTIAL
PATHOGENS
As discussed earlier in Chapter 13, plants challenged
by insects or potentially pathogenic organisms also
respond with a hypersensitive reaction, characterized
by changes in the composition and properties of the cell
wall and other factors, including necrotic lesions at the
site of the invasion, that limit the spread of the invading
pathogen. Because the hypersensitive reaction is a form
of developmental response, we must assume that a signal
detection and transduction chain is involved.
Attempts to explain the susceptibility of plants to
infection have shown that disease has an underlying
genetic basis. In fact both pathogens and potential host
plants carry genes that determine whether or not disease
will occur and disease will occur only when those genes
are compatible. Compatibility can be explained by the
gene-for-gene model, which predicts that resistance
will occur only when the pathogenic microorganism
carries a dominant allele at the avirulence (Avr) locus
and host plants carry a complementary dominant allele
at the resistance (R) locus (Figure 27.23). Any other
combination of dominant and recessive alleles leads to
a successful infection. A matching pair of dominant
pathogen avirulence genes and dominant plant resis-
tance genes initiates a hypersensitive reaction in the
plant.
Although a number of avirulence genes have been
isolated from both bacteria and fungi, the speciﬁc

function of their products is not known. One pos-
sibility is that avirulence genes encode enzymes for
the production of elicitors and resistance genes encode
receptors that recognize elicitors. A variety of elicitors
have been identiﬁed, most of them extracellular micro-
bial products commonly associated with cell walls of
bacteria and fungi. For example, fungal elicitors include
β-glucans, chitosan (a chitin subunit),1 and arachi-
donic acid (an unsaturated lipid). Other elicitors include
various polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and small pep-
tides. Even pectic fragments, resulting from initial
degradation of the plant cell wall pectins, or mechan-
ical damage are capable of eliciting a hypersensitive
reaction.
Recognition of elicitors by the plant cell likely
takes place at the plasma membrane. It is expected that
some form of signal transduction pathway is required
to relay this information to the nucleus in order to
effect gene transcription. A variety of common signal-
ing agents have been suggested, including changes in
pH, and ion ﬂuxes (especially potassium and calcium).
For example, a transient uptake of Ca2+ (and efﬂux
of K+) was observed when cultured cells were chal-
lenged with a fungal elicitor. Moreover, expression of
defense response genes can be regulated by regulat-
ing intracellular Ca2+ levels. Thus, defense responses
can be activated by stimulating Ca2+ uptake with Ca2+
ionophores or inhibited by blocking Ca2+ channels.
Other early events in elicitor-treated cells include pro-
tein phosphorylation and the production of active oxy-
gen species (O−
2 and H2O2), known as the oxidative
burst. The precise role of these various signals and how
they interact in the signal cascade is unknown. It is
a topic that is under active investigation in numerous
laboratories.
27.5.3 SALICYLIC ACID, A SHIKIMIC
ACID DERIVATIVE, TRIGGERS
SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED
RESISTANCE
In many cases, the hypersensitive reaction leads to a
general immunity against infection known as systemic
acquired resistance or SAR (Chapter 13). Most of the
evidence suggests that the signal for SAR is salicylic
acid (SA) or its volatile methylated derivative methyl-
salicylate. The role of SA in SAR is indicated by several
lines of evidence. For example, SAR is characterized by
a rise in the levels of SA along with the activation of
defense-related genes and the appearance of their prod-
ucts, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. In addition, SA

rather than cellulose. Chitin is a polymer of N-acetylgluco-
samine that forms microﬁbrils similar to cellulose.

Chapter 27 / Secondary Metabolites
is synthesized from chorismate via isochorismate, a reac-
tion catalyzed by the enzyme, but Arabidopsis mutants
that failed to accumulate SA after SAR induction were
shown to be deﬁcient of this enzyme. Accumulation of
SA in infected plants carrying mutations of the isocho-
rismate synthase gene is no more than 5 to 10 percent
of wildtype plants and systemic resistance is severely
compromised.
The molecular genetics and biochemistry of SAR
is slowly yielding to investigation. A central player is
the regulatory protein NPR1 (NON EXPRESSOR
OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1). NPR1
is expressed at low levels throughout the plant, but its
messenger RNA levels rise some two- to threefold fol-
lowing pathogen infection or salicylic acid treatment.
In addition, several Arabidopsis mutants that were not
responsive to salicylic acid were found to have muta-
tions in the NPR1 gene. NPR1 protein interacts with a
group of transcription factors known as the TGA fam-
ily of transcription factors; an interaction that requires
salicylic acid and stimulates the transcription of PR
genes.
Of particular interest is the recent discovery that
changes in the redox status of the cell play an impor-
tant role in the NPR1/TGA interaction. A change
in the cellular redox potential, from an initial burst
of reactive oxygen species to a more reducing envi-
ronment, is induced by salicylic acid and appears to
facilitate the transcription of PR genes by triggering the
translocation of NPR1 from the cytosol into the nucleus
where it is free to interact with the TGA transcription
factors.
27.6 JASMONATES ARE LINKED
TO UBIQUITIN-RELATED
PROTEIN DEGRADATION
As previously shown in Chapter 13, a plant’s resistance
to insects and disease is also mediated by the fatty acid
derivative jasmonic acid and its methyl ester (methyl-
jasmonate), collectively referred to as jasmonates (See
Figure 13.16). Jasmonates were ﬁrst recognized for their
ability to promote senescence of detached barley leaf
segments, but a role in disease resistance was suggested
when phytoalexin biosynthesis in cell cultures was linked
to jasmonic acid content. It is now known that jasmonic
acid accumulates in wounded plants and in plants treated
with many elicitors. Jasmonic acid has also been linked
to the activation of a number of genes encoding proteins
with antifungal properties.
Jasmonic acid is synthesized by the oxidation and
rearrangement of linolenic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid
(see Appendix). Plant membranes are a rich source of
linolenic acid as a constituent fatty acid of phospholipids.
It is thought that elicitors ﬁrst bind with an unknown
receptor in the plasma membrane. The elicitor-receptor
complex activates a membrane-bound phospholipase
that releases linolenic acid. The formation of jasmonic
acid then involves several steps in which the linolenic
acid undergoes successive oxidizations and cyclization.
Central to jasmonate signaling is a family of
transcriptional repressors (JAZ) and an F-box protein
(COI1) that is structurally and functionally related to
the TIR1 auxin receptor (Chapter 18). Because of this
similarity, the current model for jasmonate signaling
bears a close resemblance to that of auxin-mediated
degradation of AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors
previously described in Chapter 18. According to this
model, jasmonates promote binding of JAZ repressor
proteins to the E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCFCOI1) and
their subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-26S
proteasome system, thus allowing for the activation of
jasmonate-responsive genes.
27.7 ALKALOIDS
27.7.1 ALKALOIDS ARE A LARGE FAMILY
OF CHEMICALLY UNRELATED
MOLECULES
As a group, alkaloids share three principal characters:
they are soluble in water, they possess at least one
nitrogen atom, and they exhibit high biological activity.
Often the nitrogen will accept a proton, which gives it
a slightly basic, or alkaline, character in solution (hence
the name alkaloid). Alkaloids are for the most part het-
erocyclic, although a few aliphatic (noncyclic) nitrogen
compounds, such as mescaline and colchicine, are con-
sidered alkaloids. Altogether, some 12,000 alkaloids have
been found to occur in approximately 20 percent of the
species of ﬂowering plants, mostly herbaceous dicots.
27.7.2 ALKALOIDS ARE NOTED
PRIMARILY FOR THEIR
PHARMACOLOGICAL
PROPERTIES AND MEDICAL
APPLICATIONS
The word ‘‘alkaloid’’ is virtually synonymous with the
word ‘‘drug’’; as recently as 1985, 10 of the 12 com-
mercially most important plant-derived drugs were
alkaloids. Alkaloids generate varying degrees of phys-
iological and psychological response in humans, most
often by interfering with neurotransmitters. In large
doses, most alkaloids are highly toxic, but in smaller
doses they may have therapeutic value.
From prehistory to the present, alkaloids or
alkaloid-rich extracts have been used for a variety of
pharmacological purposes, such as muscle relaxants,
tranquilizers, antitussives, pain killers, poisons, and

27.7 Alkaloids

mind-altering drugs. One of the oldest known is opium,
an exudate obtained from the immature seed capsule
of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferon). The use of
opium mixed with wine to induce sleep and relieve pain
was noted on Sumerian tablets dating back to 2500 BC.
The species name somniferon was chosen by Linnaeus
because of its sleep-inducing properties. Opium is
a latex gum containing a mixture of more than 20
different alkaloids, including morphine, codeine, and
papaverine (Figure 27.24). The opium poppy has been
traditionally cultivated in the Golden Crescent of the
eastern Mediterranean (presently Iran, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan) and in parts of southeast Asia. The
genus Papaver contains 9 other species, many of them
common garden ornamentals, but none of which
produce alkaloids of medical interest. In 399 BC, the
Greek philosopher Socrates was executed by consuming
an extract of hemlock (Conium spp.) containing the
alkaloid coniine. In the Western Hemisphere, the
Aztecs and other native cultures used the peyote cactus
(Lophophora williamsii), containing mescaline and a
large number of other alkaloids, for its hallucinogenic
properties.
Alkaloids are generally classiﬁed on the basis of
the predominant ring system present in the molecule
(Figure 27.25). In spite of the extensive variation in
structure, however, alkaloids are generated from a lim-
ited number of simple precursors. Most alkaloids are
synthesized from a few common amino acids (tyrosine,
tryptophan, ornithine or argenine, and lysine). The
tobacco alkaloid nicotine is synthesized from nicotinic
acid and caffeine is a purine derivative.
Although a few alkaloids are found in several genera
or even families, most species display their own unique,
genetically determined pattern. As with other secondary
metabolites, individual alkaloids may be restricted to
particular organs, such as roots, leaves, or young fruit.

Codeine and morphine are naturally occurring alkaloids isolated from the seed cap-
sules of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferon). Heroin is a semisynthetic alkaloid
produced by acetylation of morphine. Codeine is commonly used as a cough-
suppressant and local anesthetic. Morphine is used primarily as an analgesic or pain
killer. Heroin was originally synthesized by pharmaceutical chemists in the late nine-
teenth century as part of an effort to ﬁnd a more effective alternative to morphine.
Berberine, however, is found in several sources, includ-
ing seeds of barberry (Berberis vulgaris). Barberry was
at one time a common horticultural hedge but is now
out of fashion due to the high incidence of poisoning in
young children attracted to its bright-red berries.
The quinolizidine alkaloids, such as lupinine, are
frequently called lupine alkaloids because of their high
abundance in the genus Lupinus. Although range ani-
mals are deterred from eating lupines because of their
bitter taste, grazing on lupines is still a common cause
of poisoning of grazing cattle. The highest concen-
tration of alkaloids occurs in the seed, so livestock
losses are generally highest in the fall. Other alkaloids
that cause poisoning of livestock include senecionine
(Senecio, groundsel), lycotonine (Delphinium, larkspur),
scopolamine (Datura stramonium, jimson weed), and
atropine (also known as hyoscyamine) from black
henbane (Hyoscyamus niger). Agricultural crops are not
without some risk to human consumption. The family
Solanaceae is noted for genera such as Datura, Hyoscya-
mus, and Atropa belladonna (the deadly nightshades),
all containing high amounts of toxic alkaloids. Edible
members of the Solanaceae include potato (Solanum
tuberosum) and tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum), which
produce the steroidal alkaloids α-solanine and tomatine,
respectively. The solanine alkaloids are cholinesterase
inhibitors that interfere with nerve transmission. For-
tunately, the alkaloid content of both potato tubers and
ripe tomato fruit is well below toxic levels, although
green vines have higher levels and are potentially toxic
if eaten. Potato tubers that have been exposed to strong
sunlight and have begun to green may also synthesize
toxic levels of the α-solanine and should not be eaten.
The indole alkaloids are often referred to as
terpenoid-alkaloids because, although the basic indole
ring structure is derived from tryptophan, the rest
of the molecule is derived from the mevalonic acid

pathway. Two well-known terpenoid-indole alkaloids,
vinblastine and vincristine, are produced by the Mada-
gascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus. In the 1950s it
was discovered that vinblastine and vincristine arrest
cell division in metaphase by inhibiting microtubule
formation. They have since been used in the treatment
of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, and other forms
of cancer. Unfortunately, C. roseus produces a complex
array of indole alkaloids of which vinblastine and vin-
cristine represent only a very small proportion (about
0.05% of leaf dry weight). This makes their extraction
and puriﬁcation difﬁcult and costly. Recent efforts have
led to the development of cell culture systems in order to
produce higher yields at reasonable cost. Unfortunately,
because alkaloid production is so often tissue-speciﬁc,
production in cell culture has not been highly success-
ful. Other well-known alkaloids such as cocaine (from
leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum coca), codeine
(from the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum), nicotine
(tobacco), and caffeine (coffee beans and tea leaves) are
widely used as stimulants or sedatives.
27.7.3 LIKE MANY OTHER SECONDARY
METABOLITES, ALKALOIDS
SERVE AS PREFORMED
CHEMICAL DEFENSE
MOLECULES
Whether alkaloids have any speciﬁc function in plants
has been a subject of debate for many years. Some
plants appear to invest a signiﬁcant proportion of their
resources, especially nitrogen, in a diverse array of alka-
loids and yet they have no obvious function in the
physiology of the plants themselves. Like other sec-
ondary products, however, there are at least two general
arguments supporting a defensive role. Firstly, most
alkaloids have a bitter taste, which is considered a uni-
versally repellant character for all animals, including
insects. Secondly, all alkaloids are biologically active
and many are signiﬁcantly toxic to insects and other
animals. Nicotine, for example, is a potent insect poison
and one of the ﬁrst insecticides used by humans.
Many alkaloids have antibiotic properties and may
have a role in defense against microbial infection. Inter-
estingly, it has been known for a long time that alkaloid
concentrations are very low when measured on a whole
plant basis, but, as noted earlier, may be very high in
selected organs or tissues. Often the tissues that accumu-
late alkaloids are those most vulnerable in terms of plant
ﬁtness (young inﬂuorescences or seed pods, for example)
or peripheral tissues that would be ﬁrst attacked by her-
bivores. Thus the morphine content of whole young
poppy capsules is less than 2 percent, but 25 percent
or more in the latex that exudes when the capsule is
wounded. Quinine accumulates in the outer bark of the
tree Cinchona ofﬁcinalis and Rauwolﬁa alkaloids are con-
centrated primarily in the root bark. Although alkaloids
have been studied extensively for their pharmacological
and medicinal value, there is much yet to be learned
with respect to their physiology and chemical ecology.
SUMMARY
Although the products of plant metabolism are often
designated as either primary or secondary metabolites,
the distinction between the two is not easily made.
Primary metabolites such as protein, lipid, carbohy-
drate, and nucleic acids comprise the basic metabolic
machinery of all cells. Others, such as chlorophyll and
lignin, are more restricted in occurrence but are equally
essential to the growth and development of the organ-
ism. Secondary metabolites, on the other hand, may be
found only in speciﬁc tissues or at particular stages of
development and have no obvious role in the develop-
ment or survival of the organism.
Three metabolic pathways that give rise to both
primary and secondary metabolites are the mevalonic
acid and MEP pathways and the shikimic acid pathway.
The mevalonic acid and MEP pathways give rise to
two 5-carbon compounds, isopentenyl pyrophosphate
and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, that form the basis
for the terpenoid family. Terpenoids include primary
metabolites such as phytol (a portion of the chlorophyll
molecule), membrane sterols, carotenoid pigments, and
the hormones gibberellin and abscisic acid. Secondary
products include a range of 5-carbon hemiterpenoids
through 40-carbon tetraterpenes and the polyterpenes,
rubber and gutta.
The shikimic acid pathway produces the
aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
tryptophan—all primary metabolites required for
protein synthesis. Deamination of phenylalanine to
cinnamic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine
ammonia lyase (PAL), effectively diverts carbon from
primary metabolism into the synthesis of a wide range
of secondary metabolites—coumarins, lignin, tannins,
ﬂavonoids, and isoﬂavonoids—based on simple
phenolic acids.
Salicylic acid is involved in establishing the hyper-
sensitive reaction to insect herbivory and pathogen
infection. The gene-for-gene model predicts that no
infection will occur when the pathogen and host
plant carry dominant avirulence and response genes,
respectively. An early event in this sensing/signaling
pathway is the activation of defense-related genes and
synthesis of their products, pathogenesis-related (PR)
proteins. The plant immune response continues with
the development of a general immune response known
as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR signaling
includes the protein NPR1, which responds to a change

480
Chapter 27 / Secondary Metabolites
in cellular redox potential by migrating into the nucleus
where it interacts with transcription factors to stimulate
the transcription of PR genes.
Other interesting and useful secondary metabolites
include the saponins (terpene glycosides), cardiac gly-
cosides, cyanogenic glycosides, and glucosinolates. The
alkaloids are a heterogeneous group of nitrogenous
compounds with signiﬁcant pharmacological prop-
erties. Although the physiological roles of secondary
metabolites are poorly understood, most are toxic to
some degree and appear to serve primarily in defense
against microbial infection and attack by herbivores.

metabolism.

I.1 LIPIDS
Lipids (Gr. lipos, fat) are a chemically diverse group of
molecules deﬁned primarily by their ability to dissolve
readily in organic solvents, but only sparingly in water.
These include fats, oils, and the phospholipids and
glycolipids that make up the cellular membranes. Sterols
(steroid alcohols) and molecules containing long-chain
hydrocarbons such as the pigments chlorophyll and
carotene, although chemically distinct from fats and
oils, are also considered lipids on the basis of their
solubility properties.
Fats and oils are composed of long hydrocarbon
chains called fatty acids and the three-carbon alcohol
glycerol (Figure I.1). Fatty acids are attached to the
glycerol through an ester link between the carboxyl
group of the fatty acid and a hydroxyl group on the glyc-
erol molecule. Because one fatty acid (an acyl group)
is esteriﬁed to each of the three glycerol carbons, a
molecule of fat or oil is known as triacylglycerol, or a
triglyceride. Fatty acids vary according to the length
of the hydrocarbon chain (i.e., the number of carbon
atoms) as well as the number of carbon–carbon dou-
ble bonds and the position of those double bonds in
the chain (Table I.1). Fatty acids that have no double
bonds are known as saturated fatty acids, referring to
the fact that all the carbon–carbon bonds are saturated
with hydrogen atoms. Fatty acids with double bonds
are considered unsaturated. Unsaturated fatty acids are
identiﬁed not only by the number of double bonds, but
also by their location in the molecule. For example,
there are two forms of linolenic acid: α-linolenic acid
has double bonds at the 9, 12, and 15 carbons, while
in γ -linolenic the double bonds are at the 6, 9, and 12
carbons. Most fatty acids contain an even number of car-
bon atoms because their synthesis involves the successive
addition of two-carbon acetate (CH3—COO−) units.
The difference between fats and oils is a matter
of melting points. The melting points of fatty acids
increase with chain length and the extent of saturation.
Saturated fatty acids tend to be solid at room temper-
ature and unsaturated fatty acids tend to be liquid at
room temperature. Thus fats, which are normally solid
at room temperature, are triglycerides composed of pre-
dominantly saturated fatty acids, while oils, normally
ﬂuid at room temperature, are composed of predom-
inantly unsaturated fatty acids. Plant cells, especially
those in seeds, contain mostly oils that are often stored
in lipid bodies called oleosomes. Lipids may, in fact,

be the dominant form of stored carbon in smaller seeds
because it is an efﬁcient form in which to store energy.
Lipids are less oxidized than carbohydrate and therefore
will yield more energy when oxidized during respiration.
Lipid bodies are also commonly found in chloroplasts,
which contain an extensive internal membrane system.
These lipid bodies may represent a reservoir of lipids
for membrane synthesis.
The principal class of lipids found in most cellular
membranes is the phospholipids. Phospholipids are
diglycerides; meaning that only two fatty acids (rather
than three) are esteriﬁed to the glycerol molecule.
The third position is occupied instead by a phosphate
group (Figure I.2). The simplest phospholipid is
phosphatidic acid (PA), in which R = −OH. PA is
found only in small quantities in most membranes.
In most membrane phospholipids, R is a small, polar
molecule such as choline, ethanolamine, serine, or
myo-inositol. Phospholipids containing these head
groups are known as phosphatidylcholine
(PC),
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine
(PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), respectively.
Further variation in phospholipids is introduced
by the nature of the two fatty acids; in plant mem-
branes, the most abundant are 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1,
18:2, and 18:3. A high proportion of unsaturated fatty
acids in the membrane lipids contributes to the ﬂuid-
ity of membranes. This is because the carbon–carbon
double bond introduces a ‘‘kink’’ in the fatty acid (see
Figure I.2) that prevents the resulting phospholipids
from packing as tightly as they do with only saturated
fatty acids. Phospholipids are often described as having
a charged, polar phosphate ‘‘head’’ and a long hydro-
carbon ‘‘tail’’ represented by the two fatty acids. This
gives the molecule a dual character in that the phosphate
head is hydrophilic (‘‘water-loving’’) and the fatty acid tail
is hydrophobic (‘‘water-fearing’’). A molecule with both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties is known as
amphipathic.
Some plant membranes contain large amounts of
glycolipids, lipids in which the head group contains
one or more sugar residues. The internal membranes of
the chloroplast are particularly distinctive in this regard.
They contain only about 10 percent phospholipid
and about 80 percent monogalactosyl diglyceride
(MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG).
MGDG and DGDG are similar to phospholipids
except that the phosphate group is replaced with

one or two molecules, respectively, of the sugar
galactose. The remaining 10 percent of the chloroplast
membrane lipid is accounted for by sulfolipid; in this
case, a sulfur group is attached to the galactose in
MGDG.
The principal sites of a fatty acid and lipid biosyn-
thesis are the endoplasmic reticulum, the chloroplast,
and the mitochondria. Chloroplasts appear to have the
enzymatic machinery for synthesizing all the C16 and
C18 fatty acids and the addition of galactosyl residues to
the diglycerides in order to make MGDG and DGDG.
Chloroplasts do not, however, appear to make phospho-
lipids; this is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum,
which contains all the enzymes necessary for the synthe-
sis of PC and PE. Mitochondria are apparently unable
to synthesize either PC or PE, even though these are
the principal phospholipids of the mitochondrial mem-
branes.
I.2 PROTEINS
Proteins are composed of amino acids. There are 20
‘‘standard’’ amino acids, speciﬁed by the genetic code,
that make up all proteins. All amino acids have the
same core structure, in which a single carbon atom
(the α-carbon) carries both an amino group (—NH2)
and a carboxylic acid group (—COOH) (Figure I.3).
At physiological pH, both the amino group and the
carboxyl group of an amino acid are ionized. Amino
acids thus carry both a negative charge and a positive
charge at the same time. Such molecules are known as
zwitterions.
The structures of the 20 individual amino acids vary
according to the nature of the R group, or side chain.
This side chain may consist of nonpolar groups which
give the amino acid hydrophobic properties, or either
neutral or charged polar groups, which give the amino
acid hydrophilic properties (Figure I.4).
A peptide bond forms when the amino group of one
amino acid forms a covalent link with the carboxyl group
of a second amino acid (Figure I.5). When two amino
acids are linked by a single peptide bond, the result-
ing molecule is called a dipeptide. Three amino acids
constitute a tripeptide, and so forth. A chain containing
a large number of amino acids is called a polypep-
tide. Most proteins are polypeptides containing in the
range of 40 to 4,000 amino acids, which allows for an
extremely large number of different protein molecules.
For example, a simple dipeptide may have any one of
20 choices for the ﬁrst amino acid paired with any
one of the same 20 choices for the second amino acid.
This allows for 202, or 400, possible unique dipep-
tides. Similarly, for a protein containing 100 amino
acids, there are 20100, or 1.27 × 10130, possible unique
combinations.
Because the chemical properties of the side chains of
individual amino acids are each different, it is clear that
organisms are able to synthesize an enormous number
of different proteins with an equally large range of bio-
chemical properties. The variety of proteins is further
enhanced with the addition of nonstandard amino acids,
or amino acid derivatives. These amino acid deriva-
tives are the result of speciﬁc modiﬁcations made to a
standard amino acid after the peptide chain has been

standard amino acid that is found in certain cell wall
proteins.
Protein molecules have several levels of organiza-
tion, as shown in Figure I.6. The sequence of amino acids
in a polypeptide is referred to as the primary structure.
Primary structure is determined by the sequence of
nucleotides in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that
makes up the gene for that protein. This sequence is
ﬁrst transcribed into a messenger ribonucleic acid
(mRNA), which migrates from the nucleus into the
cytoplasm where it attaches to particles called ribo-
somes. Amino acids are sequentially assembled into
polypeptides on the ribosome according to the sequence
of nucleotides, or message, in the mRNA. When the

completed polypeptide chain is released from the ribo-
some, it folds spontaneously to form a three-dimensional
shape. The backbone of peptide bonds may form a heli-
cal coil (an α-helix), or may fold such that segments
of the chain lie side by side to form a pleated sheet,
or it may form random coils. These speciﬁc spatial
arrangements are referred to as secondary structure
and all three may occur within a single peptide chain.
The number and distribution of helices, pleated sheets,
and random coils in the polypeptide determine the
three-dimensional conﬁguration of the entire polypep-
tide, called tertiary structure. Tertiary structure of the
protein is commonly referred to as conformation. Some
protein molecules are composed of a single polypep-
tide, while others are composed of multiple polypeptide
chains, called subunits. The arrangement of subunits
in the protein molecule is referred to as quaternary
structure. The three-dimensional structure of a pro-
tein is stabilized by a variety of noncovalent bonds,
including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions
between ionized amino and carboxyl groups on the
amino acid side chains. At the tertiary level, covalent
disulﬁde bonds (—S—S—) may form between nearby
amino acids with sulfur groups in their side chains.
Alternatively, neighboring amino acids with nonpolar
side groups may form strong hydrophobic interac-
tions.
Subtle differences in the composition and structure
give each protein its unique characteristics and its ability
to discriminate between other molecules with which it
interacts. In spite of the large size and complex structure
of most proteins, a change in even a single amino acid
in the sequence may dramatically alter its biological
properties.

acid chain spontaneously forms an α-helix, a β-sheet,
or a random coil. All three conﬁgurations may occur
within a single peptide chain. (C) Tertiary structure is
the three-dimensional shape, or conformation, of a com-

refers to an assembly of multiple peptide chains.
I.3 CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
in the general proportions of 1:2:1. In other words,
the hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) are found in the
same proportions as they are found in water, hence
‘‘carbon hydrate.’’ The composition of carbohydrates is
(CH2O)n, where n ≥3. Smaller carbohydrate molecules
play a central role in the energy metabolism of cells and
are the principal source of carbon skeletons for almost
all other organic molecules.
I.3.1 MONOSACCHARIDES
The simplest carbohydrates are known as monosac-
charides (L. saccharum, sugar), because they cannot be
hydrolyzed to form simpler carbohydrates. The basic

features of monosaccharides are illustrated by the triose
(three-carbon) sugars glyceraldehyde and dihydroxy-
acetone (Figure I.7). Note that both molecules contain
a carbonyl oxygen (—C = O). In glyceraldehyde the
carbonyl oxygen forms an aldehyde group (—CHO),
while in dihydroxyacetone it forms a ketone group
(—C—CO—C—). Glyceraldehyde is therefore referred
to as an aldo sugar, or aldose, and dihydroxyacetone is
referred to as a keto sugar, or ketose. Other common
monosaccharides include the 4-carbon sugar, erythrose
(a tetrose); the 5-carbon sugar, ribose (a pentose); the
6-carbon sugar, glucose (a hexose); and the 7-carbon
sugar, sedoheptulose (a heptose) (Figure I.8).
The four most common hexoses found in plants
are D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, and D-fructose
(Figure I.9). Mannose is similar to glucose except for
the orientation of the hydroxyl group on the second
carbon. Similarly, galactose and glucose differ only in
the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 4.
These are examples of stereoisomers. Stereoisomerism
arises because the four bonds of a carbon atom do not
lie in a single plane as they are usually represented on
paper, but form a three-dimensional tetrahedron:
When the carbon atom is attached to four different
substituents, there are two possible conﬁgurations that
are mirror images of each other. Such carbons are
known as asymmetric carbons. Glucose, for example,

contains four asymmetric carbon atoms (carbons 2, 3, 4,
5), which allows for up to 24 or16 possible sterioisomers.
Mannose and galactose are just two of the 16 possible
sterioisomers of glucose. Each stereoisomer has different
chemical, physical, and biological properties.
Note that the names of the four sugars above contain
the preﬁx D- (fr. L, dextra, right hand). This identiﬁes the
structure of the D-enantiomer, which, in solution, rotates
plane polarized light to the right, or clockwise, from
the point of view of the observer. By convention, the
D-enantiomer is drawn with the hydroxyl group on the
highest-numbered asymmetric carbon placed to the right
of the carbon chain. If this hydroxyl is written to the left
(and all other hydroxyl groups are similarly inverted), the
designation is L- (fr. L, laevus, left). L-sugars rotate plane
polarized light counterclockwise, or to the left. Most
naturally occurring sugars are in the D conﬁguration.
One exception is L-galactose, a constituent of agar.
Although monosaccharides are often depicted as
linear molecules, in solution the aldehyde or ketone
group normally reacts intramolecularly with a hydroxyl
group to form a cyclic molecule (Figure I.10). Note
that ring closure generates an additional asymmetric
center at the former carbonyl carbon (C1 for glucose
and C2 for fructose). Depending on the position of
the hydroxy group on this carbon, the conﬁguration is
known as either α or β. These two forms are referred
to as anomers, and the asymmetric carbon is referred
to as the anomeric carbon. When glucose molecules
are linked together in a chain, the distinction between
α and β is not trivial. For example, starch, a storage
carbohydrate, is a polymer of α-D-glucose units while
the cellulose found in plant cell walls is a polymer of
β-D-glucose units. The physical and chemical properties
of starch and cellulose are very different!
The aldehyde or ketone group of monosaccharides
may be reduced to an alcohol group (Figure I.11).
Reduction of glucose, for example, yields sorbitol and
mannose yields mannitol. The sugar alcohols (sorbitol

FIGURE I.10 In solution, monosaccharides cyclize to form
an internal lactone ring. The ring forms between the
carbonyl carbon and a nonterminal hydroxyl group. A
monosaccharide that forms a six-membered ring (ﬁve
carbons and one oxygen) is called a pyranose, after pyran,
the simplest molecule containing such a ring. Similarly,
a monosaccharide that forms a ﬁve-membered ring (four
carbons and one oxygen) is called a furanose, after furan.
Glucose, a 6-carbon aldo sugar, forms a pyranose, while
fructose, a 6-carbon keto sugar, forms a furanose.
and mannitol) frequently serve as storage carbohydrate
in algae and other lower plants. Alternatively, the pri-
mary alcohol group of an aldose may be oxidized to
form a carbonyl, or acid, group. The acid form of glu-
cose is glucuronic acid and of galactose, galacturonic
acid. Glucuronic and galacturonic acids are important
components of noncellulosic cell wall polymers.
Monosaccharides such as glyceraldehyde and dihy-
droxyacetone, are known as reducing sugars because of
the ease with which the free aldehyde group reduces mild
oxidizing agents. The standard test is the reduction of
silver ion (Ag+) to metallic silver using Tollens’ reagent.
A silver mirror lining on the surface of the reaction vessel
indicates the presence of a reducing sugar.

anomeric hydroxyl group of one sugar and a hydroxyl
group of a second sugar (Figure I.12). Small carbohy-
drate polymers are identiﬁed by the number of sugar
residues (e.g., 2 sugars = disaccharide, 3 = trisaccha-
ride, etc.) while longer chains are referred to simply as
polysaccharides (also known as glycans). The glyco-
sidic bond is effectively analogous to the peptide bond
in proteins.
The principal disaccharide found in higher plants
is sucrose, formed by the condensation of α-D-glucose
with α-D-fructose (Figure I.12). Note that the bond is
formed between the number-1 carbon of glucose and the
number-2 carbon of fructose. Because the bond involves
the number-1 and number-2 carbons of α-sugars, it
is designated as an α(1 →2) link. Also, because both
reducing groups are involved in forming the bond,
sucrose is not a reducing sugar.
Polysaccharides usually consist of a single type of
sugar (i.e., glucose), although polysaccharides consisting
of more than one sugar are known. The two most

FIGURE I.13 The structures of cellulose and amylose.
Both are polymers of glucose. In cellulose, carbon-1 of
the ﬁrst β-D-glucose residue is linked to carbon-4 of the
next β-D-glucose residue (a β(1 →4) glycosidic bond).
Amylose is a linear form of starch in which α-D-glucose
residues are linked by α(1 →4) glycosidic bonds. In
either case, the value of n may be up to several thousand.
common polysaccharides in higher plants are starch
and cellulose. Starch is made up entirely of (1 →4)-
linked and (1 →6)-branched α-D-glucose residues
(Figure I.13). Cellulose, on the other hand, is a long,
unbranched chain of (1 →4)-linked β-D-glucose
residues (Figure I.13). Because both starch and cellulose
are made of glucose, they are commonly referred to as
glucans. Starch forms a helically coiled structure used
primarily for storage of carbon and energy. Cellulose
is a linear molecule that may contain 3,000 or more
glucose residues and is noted for its high degree of
structural strength. Cellulose, which may comprise up
to 80 percent of the dry weight of a plant, is the most
abundant organic substance in the world and perhaps
one of the most economically important. A polymer
similar to cellulose is chitin, the principal component
of the exoskeleton of some invertebrates (crustaceans,
insects, spiders) and the cell walls of some fungi. Chitin
is a β(1 →4)-linked polymer of N-acetylglucosamine,
which differs chemically from cellulose only in that
the hydroxyl group on carbon-2 of the glucose unit is
replaced by an —NHCOCH3 group.
Another important class of polysaccharides is the
fructans. Fructans are polymers with varying numbers
of fructose molecules added to the fructose end of
sucrose and are particularly common in grasses. Fruc-
tans built up of β(2 →6) links are known as levans,
while those with β(1 →6) links are known as inulins.
Inulin is an important storage carbohydrate in Jerusalem
artichoke (Helianthus tuberosum).
