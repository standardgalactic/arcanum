Welcome back Develop 100
There has never been a more exciting 
time to be a game developer. 2020 has 
presented its fair share of challenges, 
and still, our industry reacted, adapted 
to deliver its most successful year. 
Publicly listed publishers delivered 
an average 30 per cent growth in the 
second calendar quarter, while Newzoo 
upgraded its annual forecasted growth to nearly 20 per cent 
year-on-year. 
In a world where almost everyone is either a current or 
potential gamer, our cultural relevance has never been greater. 
Game engines are branching out of games and enhancing 
more aspects of our lives, for example by replacing traditional 
dashboards with interactive displays. And when cultural scenes 
became out of reach due to the pandemic, virtual music concerts 
and digital art exhibitions started to fill the void. 
Working in such a fast-paced industry means we rarely take 
time to look back and celebrate our big successes. With the 
gaming landscape changing by the year, which new studios have 
broken out and become huge household names, and which have 
created generation-defining blockbuster games? For 2020, it 
wasn’t always those you might expect.
It’s important to celebrate the studios that contribute to 
making the games industry better and the powerhouse that it is 
today. That’s why we’re so passionate about supporting MCV/
Develop’s Develop 100, and why we were so excited to be a part 
of bringing the list back for 2021. 
For everyone included in the list, I want to extend our warmest 
congratulations. You are a huge reason why the global games 
industry is going from strength to strength. And all that while 
creating games that bring a smile to the face of millions around 
the world. Thank you for making this industry what it is today and 
being a source of inspiration to thousands of game developers 
worldwide.

HOW IT WORKS
In association with

The Tokyo-based studio Akatsuki has seen enormous 
success with its Dragonball Z mobile game, Dragon Ball Z: 
Dokkan Battle. 
According to Forbes, the game is responsible for about 
three quarters of the company’s annual revenues of  
$254m. The free to play title has exceeded 350  
million downloads since its release in 2015, grossing  
an excess of $2bn in 
worldwide revenue. 
The studio itself, 
meanwhile, was founded 
in 2010 and was listed 
on the New York Stock 
exchange back in 2016, 
off the back of the 
success of Dokkan Battle.

The Vietnamese studio 111 Dots developed Garena Free 
Fire for Singapore-based Garena Games. And the title 
has proved incredibly popular, even in the increasingly 
crowded battle royale genre. It was the most downloaded 
mobile game in 2019 and in May 2020 set a record with 
over 80m daily active users globally. 
The third-person shooter puts its success down to 
performance, as it 
runs smoothly on 
low specification 
handsets. Garena 
also works with 
Activision and 
Tencent to distribute 
Call of Duty: Mobile in 
south east asia.

Japanese company Aniplex is largely focused on anime 
and music production, but it makes the Develop 100 list 
off the back of Japanese mobile title, Disney: Twisted-
Wonderland.  Developed in collaboration with Walt Disney 
Japan, the game is only available in Japan, and released 
in March 2020. Despite this, the game has already seen 
explosive success, attracting 1.5m pre-registered users 
before the game had 
even launched. 
Aniplex also acts 
as a publisher, and is 
responsible for publishing 
Fate/Grand Order, with its 
developer Delightworks 
also appearing on this 
year’s list. 
Alibaba is primarily known as a technology company 
specialising in e-commerce, but it has made significant 
investments in its entertainment division in recent years. 
In 2018, the company invested ¥1 bn ($145m) to create a 
global distribution ecosystem for mobile games. Although, 
it’s best performing title is only available in China to date. 
Romance of the Three 
Kingdoms: Strategy 
Edition, developed by 
Alibaba’s subsidiary 
Ejoy, is among the 
most profitable games 
worldwide, with a 
lifetime revenue of 
$500m since its launch 
in September 2019.

Bandai Namco – Dimps
Archosaur Games
Dimps Corporation is a Japanese developer, based in 
Osaka. Founded on March 6, 2000 by several former 
SNK and Capcom employees, the studio is known for 
developing games in the Dragon Ball and Street Fighter 
franchises – and most notably for our purposes, Dimps, in 
collaboration with Bandai Namco, developed the iOS and 
Android title, Dragon Ball Legends, which has proven to be 
a global smash hit.
Launched in May 2018, 
the game has already 
grossed over $140m 
worldwide – with the 
majority of that success, 
$100m, coming from the 
United States and Japan.
Archosaur Games, formerly Zulong Entertainment, is 
located in Beijing, and is responsible for a number of 
mobile games, such as World of Kings and Novoland: The 
Castle in the Sky.
Most recently the developer is behind the game 
Dragon Raja, a mobile MMORPG which launched globally 
on February 27th 2020. The game proved immediately 
successful, attracting 1.5 
million pre-registered 
players prior to launch.

publisher recently raised

Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, 
is responsible for some of the biggest franchises in gaming 
history and, in better times, is behind the annual gaming 
convention Blizzcon, which celebrates franchises such as 
Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.
Almost unquestionably the studio’s most famous game 
– and one of the most famous games in gaming generally – 
is the 2004 MMORPG, World of Warcraft.
That title has thrived in its 16-year lifetime, becoming 
synonymous with the genre, and seeing off countless 
competitors seeking to take its spot as the indisputed king 
of the MMORPG. 
By 2017, the game had generated over $9.23 billion in 
lifetime revenue, making it one of the most lucrative game 
franchises of all time.
Since then 
the game has 
seen multiple 
content packs 
to maintain 
its devoted 
playbase, as 
well as the 
2019 release 
of World of 
Warcraft 
Classic, which 
recreates the game in its original state, as it existed when 
it launched all the way back in 2004.
Stepping away from World of Warcraft, Blizzard 
Entertainment has seen success with a much newer IP: 
2016’s hero shooter Overwatch. The game generated 
$1 billion in its first year of release, and has seen over 50 
million players in its lifetime. A sequel, Overwatch 2, was 
announced in 2019 and is expected in 2021.

Founded in 2009, Camel Games is a Beijing based  
mobile developer that has found success with a range 
of titles for the more 
devoted  mobile gamer, 
such as Little Empire, 
Storm Age, War and Order 
and Titan Throne. 
Its big hit of late, 
though, has been Age 
of Z Origins, a post-
apocalyptic  base building 
title with great reviews 
that has been pulling in 
serious money across 
numerous regions on 
official app stores. 
Bungie slides comfortably into the Develop 100 list on the 
back of its live service title, Destiny 2. Originally released in 
2017, the game has seen multiple updates and significant 
expansions over the years. 
Most recent is the November 2020 release of Beyond 
Light, which made significant changes to the game and its 
previous expansions.
The Destiny franchise 
(including the original 
game) is listed as one 
of the highest-grossing 
game franchises of 
all time. SuperData 
estimates that Bungie 
saw $300m in digital 
revenue in 2019.

Japanese developer and publisher Capcom has had an 
incredibly successful few years lately, thanks in no small 
part to it dipping back into its back catalogue and remaking 
their older titles, with the re-releases and remakes of the 
Resident Evil franchise routinely topping the sales charts.
The series continues to generate revenue for the 
company, and 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake proved 
particularly popular. 
The game released to rave reviews and picked up 
multiple awards, including picking up the Ultimate Game of 
the Year award at the 2019 Golden Joysticks.
More importantly than all of that, however, Resident 
Evil 2 also sold incredibly well. By September 2020, the 
game had sold over 7 million copies, outselling the original 
Resident Evil 2 – a game that has been on sale since 1998. 
In 2020, Capcom 
released another 
remake, this 
time for Resident 
Evil 3. While this 
couldn’t top its 
predecessor, it 
sold 2m copies in 
its first week. 
Looking forward, 
Resident Evil Village 
(8), was announced 
back in June 2020, 
and is expected to 
hit PC and next-gen hardware sometime in 2021.
Stepping away from Resident Evil, the company has seen 
huge success with Monster Hunter: World. Released in 2018, 
it’s gone on to become the best-selling game in Capcom’s 
history, with over 16.4 million copies sold, as of September 
2020. With plenty of DLC to help further boost revenues.

COLOPL – Square Enix
Capital Games 
It may be a long time before an AR title matches the 
global phenomenon that was Pokémon Go, but away 
from Niantic, it’s Dragon Quest Walk that has made the 
best eff ort to date. 
The augmented reality 
RPG title has been 
earning big since its 
launch in Japan in June 
last year. And that’s 
without a global launch 
to date. 
The title is just one of 
many from the Tokyo-
based developer, but it 
looks set to be the one 
that puts it on the map.  
Since 2015 Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has been providing 
many fans with their mobile fi x of their favourite galaxy, a 
long time ago and far, far away. Character collecting and 
turn-based battles are the order of the day here. With 
the whole thing overseen by the team at EA’s Capital 
Games in Sacramento. 
Whether its a natural lifespan or the result of a break in 
the movie release schedule, the game has seen revenues 
declining over the 
last year, but it’s still 
the standout mobile 
performer based on 
the IP. 
Meanwhile the 
team is working on a 
new untitled game.

Part of the Sega Europe family, Creative Assembly has 
been making incredible wargames for 33 years now. The 
Total War franchise has been a hit even longer than digital 
distribution, although for a long time now it’s been a 
Steam-enabled  success story.
That changed somewhat this year, when the studio 
decided to switch it up by releasing its latest title, 
A Total War Saga: Troy, 
exclusively on Epic 
Games Store, with a 
24-hour giveaway to 
really get things going. 
It’s not all Total War for 
the future though, with 
Creative Assembly also 
working on an unannounced FPS IP from its second team 
in Horsham, expect more on that in early 2021. 
The company has also seen success with Total War titles 
using the tabletop Wahammer IP, Alien Isolation (an FPS 
stealth title) plus it made Halo Wars 2 for Microsoft. 
As part of Sega Europe, the studio works alongside 
Sports Interactive, Relic Entertainment, Amplitude 
Studios and Two Point Studios. With SEGA leaning heavily 
into the strategy genre in Europe.

Even with 28 years under its belt, during which time Crystal 
Dynamics successfully adopted gaming’s biggest heroine in 
Lara Croft, it must still have been somewhat intimidated to 
be handed the reins to Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. 
Marvel’s Avengers had sky-high 
expectations. The results were 
successful enough to place the 
studio in our top 100 list, but 
critically the consensus is that 
it’s still something of a work-
in-progress. Parent Square Enix’s 
deal with Marvel reportedly covers 
multiple titles, so there’s more 
to come. And in 2018 the studio 
opened a satellite in Bellevue, 
Washington, Crystal Northwest.
South Korean developer Com2Us, part of the larger 
Gamevil group, launched Summoners War back in 2014. 
The title is a huge success, grossing over a $1bn lifetime, 
and continues to pull in revenues today, being part of 
the top 100 mobile titles of the year, on offi  cial stores, 
according to Sensor Tower. 
The fantasy RPG 
continues to lead 
the company’s 
broad off ering 
today, which 
includes MLB and 
NBA sports titles, 
dating games and 
even a stick-fi gure

Cygames has two standout titles, either of which would 
have secured it a place in this year’s cohort. Action RPG 
Princess Connect! Re:Dive has been phenomenally popular 
in Japan, and has just secured a worldwide release as we 
go to press – working with Crunchyroll Games. 
It’s also seen enduring 
success with gacha RPG 
Granblue Fantasy, which 
shares creative talent, and a 
whole lot more, with the Final 
Fantasy series. The game has 
seen 25m in Japan alone by 
the end of 2019, spinning off  
console titles, anime series 
and manga in the process.
Cygames is based in Shibuya in Tokyo, situated 
alongside its CyberAgent parent. The company has 
numerous subsidiaries, including an anime studio to 
further its homegrown IPs. Upcoming titles include 
console action RPG Project Awakening, which appears 
to riff  off  the Monster Hunter series. 
Elsewhere, Cygames is again sponsoring the back of the 
Juventus football team shirt, until 2022. And has launched 
its fi rst Switch title in Shadowverse: Champion’s Battle.

Japanese studio Delightworks is primarily known as the 
developer behind the mobile title Fate/Grand Order, 
published by Aniplex  – who also appears in this list. The 
online free-to-play title is based on Type-Moon’s hugely 
popular Fate/stay night franchise.
The game was released in Japan in July 2015 for Android, 
with the iOS version coming in August. The English 
language version of the game, meanwhile, launched two 
years later in 2017.
The game is enormously popular in its home country of 
Japan, with some reports indicating it has seen a level of 
success comparable with Niantic’s Pokémon Go – another 
title that makes this year’s list.
In the fi rst year of the game’s Japanese launch, from 
2015 to 2016, Fate/Grand Order grossed over $646 million. 
In 2017, the year 
of its English-
language launch, 
the game was 
the year’s sixth 
highest-grossing 
mobile game, 
pulling in $982 
million. To date, 
the game has 
surpassed $4 
billion in revenue (as of the end of 2019), and has a global 
install base of 13.8 million. Fate/Grand Order accumulated 
$1.1 billion in 2019 alone, becoming the top-grossing 
mobile game in Japan.
It attracted media attention in 2018, when a player spent 
$70,000 in the game. Surprisingly, the report only served 
to highlight the game’s popularity, which continues as 
strong as ever, blending turn-based and gacha mechanics.

DIGIT Game Studios
The South Korean company describes itself enigmatically 
as the ‘Enfant Terrible of the Global Games Market’. Its 
biggest title, and the reason for its inclusion here, is Mobile 
DoubleDown - Casino Slots Game. It’s a social casino title, 
with over 100 slot machines included. 
Also on its slate 
are DoubleU 
Bingo and Hello

Established in 
2012 it pivoted away 
from initial success 
creating Facebook 
games to make

Founded in 2012, DIGIT is the largest games studio in 
Ireland, based in Dublin. 
The studio’s fi rst game was the free to play, strategy 
MMO King of the Realm, which became a top grossing 
game in over 50 countries. DIGIT are perhaps better 
known as the creators of Star Trek Fleet Command.
As of July 2019, the game has surpassed $100m in 
lifetime revenue with a massively engaged playerbase 
– 85 per cent of 
players played

Warframe showed a then suspicious console industry how 
to do free-to-play the right way. After seven years and 
with more than 60m players, developer Digital Extremes, 
has built an enviable community of dedicated fans for its 
PvE and PvP space ninja action title. 
By avoiding pay-to-win mechanics, reinventing and 
expanding the game at an impressive rate, engaging 
with its community 
(both digitally and in the 
real world with its own 
convention), plus porting 
onto new platforms, 
including Switch and (as 
we go to press) next-
gen consoles, the team 
has repeatedly gone 
above and beyond. 
Based in Ontario, 
the company was 
founded in 1993. 
Early key titles were 
in partnership with 
Epic, creating both 
Unreal and Unreal 
Tournament. 
Today it’s a 
subsidiary of Chinese 
firm Leyou, which also 
owns Splash Damage 
in the UK. 
With over 300 staff 
Digital Extremes

Formerly known as Tiburon Entertainment, EA Tiburon is 
a Florida-based studio known for its work on the Madden 
NFL franchise. 
The now 32-year old franchise is one of the largest in  
the industry, with a combined lifetime sales of over 130m 
copies for the series. 
EA Tiburon’s titles have proven successful enough 
that local city councils 
are eager to attract the 
company. During their 
recent headquarters 
move to Downtown 
Ontario, the city council 
offered $9m in economic 
incentives to bring EA to 
the city. Now that’s NFL.
EA Gothenburg, formerly Ghost Games, is known for 
its work on the Need for Speed franchise, which is one 
of gaming’s most successful franchises, selling over a 
combined 150m copies.
Their most recent title is the Xbox One, PS4 and PC title 
Need for Speed Heat, released in November 2019. 
In February 2020, EA announced plans to return Ghost 
Games to being an 
engineering support 
studio for all of EA (and 
renaming the studio EA 
Gothenburg, its original 
name), while moving the 
Need for Speed license 
back to Criterion Games

Epic Games, responsible for the hugely popular Unreal 
Engine, as well as the creator of the Gears of War and 
Unreal franchises, finds a comfortable spot in the Develop 
100 list off the back of one game: Fortnite.
Fortnite’s dominance of the industry, following its 
release in 2017, is unquestionable. While Epic Games did 
not invent the battle royale genre – and indeed Fortnite 
originally launched without a 
battle royale mode, the game 
has become synonymous 
with it, and quickly became a 
household name. The mobile 
version of the game alone 
has accumulated $1bn in 
revenue in just two years. 
As with 
any title that 
becomes 
a cultural 
phenomenon, 
Fortnite is no 
stranger to 
controversy: 
both contrived 
and justified. 
Most recently 
the game 
has been at the heart of an ongoing legal battle between 
Epic Games and Apple – a battle that began with Epic 
Games circumventing Apple’s revenue cut for games 
by offering direct payment methods for the game’s 
microtransactions. The legal battle even became part of 
an  in-game tournament, the #FreeFortnite Cup, which 
featured an evil-looking, apple-headed businessman skin 
called the Tart Tycoon.
EA’s largest and longest-serving outpost is based 
in Barnaby, British Columbia, and has been the core 
developer for the astronomically successful FIFA series 
since the early nineties. 
FIFA is one of the biggest grossing games in the world, 
with FIFA 20 reaching over 35m consumers on console 
and PC across the last cycle, plus earning well beyond that 
thanks to the incredibly 
popular FIFA Ultimate 
Team mode. 
The developer is also 
responsible for the 
NHL series, again going 
back over 25 years, and 
more recently (since 
2014) it’s taken 
on EA Sports 
UFC franchise 
too. Tot all 
of those up 
and you have 
an incredible 
revenue-
generating 
powerhouse. 
The location 
boasts over 
1,300 staff in total and supports development at other 
studios, providing a huge testing capability and motion 
capture facilities, as well as playing home for corporate 
teams. Numerous rooftop patios overlook the studio’s 
full-size football pitch, giving you an idea of both the 
quality of the offices and their dedication to the cause.
More broadly EA had a stellar 2020, with record-breaking 
results across multiple metrics.

Launched in 2017, the game combines puzzle mechanics 
with a makeover game, letting players renovate  the  
titular mansion as

The game has 
received highly 
positive feedback 
for its soft approach

It’s made many other games in its 20 year history, but 
Gearbox is now synonymous with the Borderlands 
franchise, with its shoot-and-loot gameplay. 
The latest iteration, Borderlands 3, was launched just 
before our qualifying period, but even shorn of its release 
day earnings, the game has totted up enough sales to 
make the 100. 
Based in Frisco Texas, and run 
by games press favourite Randy 
Pitchford, the company partners 
with Take Two’s 2K label for 
publishing duties. It’s stated that 
Borderlands 3 had sold 8m copies 
by the end of 2019, with the 
biggest Windows sales to date 
for any 2K title.  
Chinese-based publisher and developer Funplus, and its 
subsidiaries, including Century Games, manages a number 
of high-grossing games with a global release strategy.
Of particular note is the  long-titled State of Survival:

promoted and has a huge following, combining base 
building and real-

Before it was the architect of many of our childhoods, 
Game Freak actually began life as a video game magazine 
in the 1980s. 
However, because video game magazines are a stupid 
idea that will never catch on, the video game company of 
the same name launched in 1989. 
After finding initial success with the NES title Mendel 
Palace (known as Quinty in Japan), Game Freak went on to 
create Pokémon in 1996, which has dominated their output 
(and the industry as a whole) ever since.
Pokémon is the world’s largest media franchise, earning 
roughly $4 billion a year. 
As of March 2020, the series has sold a combined 
368 million units worldwide. Beginning life in video 
games, it has since expanded into trading cards, a long-
running anime 
series, films, 
merchandise and 
even a short-
lived theme park.
Despite the 
series’ age, 
new entries 
have proven to 
be  remarkably 
popular. 
The most recent entries to the series, Pokémon Sword 
and Pokémon Shield, have sold more than 19 million copies 
worldwide and are the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch 
games to date.
Pokémon’s other foray onto the Nintendo Switch, 
Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu & Let’s Go Eevee also proved 
monstrously popular. These remakes of the original games 
have sold over 12.5m copies.

Gram Games is one of three parts of the Zynga family  
to make our 2020 cohort. It became part of Zynga in  
2018 and reports since have shown that it has very  
much outperformed expectations. 
Its star title remains the smash hit Merge Dragons!  
Which has often been Zynga’s top performer,  
an impressive feat 
given the internal 
competition. With 
offices in Istanbul 
and now London, 
the company has a 
range of Merge titles 
as well as classic 
puzzle game 1010, 
among others. 
US mobile developer and publisher Glu Mobile has had a 
successful couple of years, boosted by its back catalogue 
of titles, such as Design Home. Looking ahead, the 
company is expected to continue to ride this wave of 
success into next year as well.
The developer’s flagship title, Design Home, which has 
surpassed $435 million in lifetime revenue. In March 2020 
Glu officially launched 
Disney Sorcerer’s Arena, 
a soft-launched title that 
had already seen 100,000 
downloads on Google 
play alone prior to its 
official launch, no doubt 
helped by the Disney IP.

Founded in 2007, Gumi is a Tokyo-based studio 
responsible for a number of titles, most notably War of the 
Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, which Gumi developed 
in collaboration with Square Enix.
War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius borrows 
gameplay elements from the Final Fantasy Tactics series, 
and proved instantly 
popular. 
Following its Japanese 
release on November 
14, 2019, the game has

Tokyo based Gungho has seen incredible success with 
its Puzzle & Dragons IP since it launched way back in 
2012. Although ‘managed decline’ was the phrase usually 
associated with the breakout Match-3 title in recent years, 
which in its heyday was the 
talk of the industry and even 
spawned a Mario crossover 
game for the 3DS. 
The IP looks to have turned 
a corner in early 2019 though 
with earnings up for the first 
time in years. Elsewhere the 
company has seen success 
with Switch title Ninjala 
and mobile MMORPG 
Raganarok Masters, 
via subsidiary Gravity. 
It operates Teppen, a 
card battler based upon 
Capcom’s characters  
and properties. 
Gungho is also the 
parent company of many 
Japanese developers. 
Grasshopper Manufacture, 
Goichi Suda’s arthouse 
developer, creator of console classics No More Heroes and 
Killer 7; Acquire, co-developer of Octopath Traveler; and 
Game Arts, creator of the Grandia series.
Gungho has been involved in gaming since the early days 
of MMORPGs. Created as a joint venture by Softbank, 
Gungho was majority owned by the company until 2016 
when it became fully independent at a cost of around 
$685m for just under a 24 per cent stake.

Arknights is amongst the newest mobile titles in this year’s 
list having received a Chinese release in mid-2019 and a 
worldwide one early in 2020. A blend of tower defence and 
gacha mechanics, the polished gameplay and production 
values place it well ahead of many competitors. 
Co-developed by Hypergryph and Studio Montagne, 
who are based in Shanghai, and published by Yostar 
(also in this year’s 
cohort for Azur 
Lane), the game 
is quickly building 
a big fanbase and 
looks well-equipped 
to build a media 
empire to rival its 
ship-based sibling.

Singapore’s I Got Games owes a lot of its success to Lords 
Mobile, which has become one of the most infl uential 
strategy titles on mobile – attracting 200 million players 
worldwide and winning multiple awards since its launch in 
March 2016
In 2018 it was announced that the game had generated 
$825 million in lifetime revenue. During that same year I 
Got Games was earning 
up to $50 million a month 
from Lords Mobile alone.
Another of the studio’s 
titles, Castle Clash, 
has generated over 
$550 million in lifetime 
revenue, according to a 
2018 report.
id Software is a Texas-based studio known for the 
Wolfenstein and Doom Franchises. Both are still popular 
today, Doom in particular, despite the franchise 
celebrating its 27th birthday in 2020. 
2016’s Doom, which revived the franchise, proved 
immediately popular on release – and again upon its re-
release on the Nintendo Switch. 
2020’s Doom Eternal 
meanwhile, doubled the 
launch weekend revenue 
of the 2016 title. The 
game debuted at number 
2 in the UK charts, beaten 
only by some tough 
competition in Animal 
Crossing: New Horizons.

Founded in 2002, Infinity Ward has become a household 
name as the creator of the Call of Duty franchise. The 
studio’s first game was the original Call of Duty, and Infinity 
Ward has been responsible for numerous entries to the 
franchise in the years since: Most recently with 2019’s Call 
of Duty: Modern Warfare and its battle royale spin-off Call 
of Duty: Warzone.
As of May 2019, the 
Call of Duty franchise 
has sold over 300m 
copies, and has been 
verified by the Guiness 
Book of Records as the 
best-selling FPS series 
of all time. 
Call of Duty: 
Warzone, co-
developed by 
Infinity Ward and 
Raven Software 
has now seen in 
excess of 85m 
players to date.
And Activision 
reported that the 
entire franchise 
had seen $3bn of 
revenue across all formats in the last 12 months — that 
figure includes Treyarch’s Black Ops: Cold War, which 
missed our qualifying period, so we’ll be seeing them here 
next year. 
While Modern Warfare’s time in the sun looks to be over, 
Warzone continues to roll on, with Infinity Ward’s design 
and , supported by Raven’s work, and now with content 
drawn from Treyach’s Cold War. It’s a truly modern beast.

Jagex
Vancouver’s Kabam became part of Netmarble back in 
2016, largely as a result of its success with Marvel Contest 
of Champions, a success that continues for the studio 
to this day, with the title remaining Netmarble’s biggest 
single earner internationally. 
The online brawler remains immensely popular, with an 
ever-growing array 
of characters to keep 
players engaged and 
entertained. 
Set to run for as long 
as Marvel retains its 
popularity, which given 
the new TV series 
looks like forever. 
The success of Runescape under Jagex is an incredible, 
enduring story. Celebrating its 20th anniversary as we 
go to press, the fantasy MMO continues to enthrall, with 
subscriber numbers higher than ever before. And it pays 
homage to its own history, running Old School Runescape 
alongside the core game since 2013.
More recently we’ve seen mobile versions of the game, 
to let its devotees play as and when they like, plus at the 
end of last year the game 
was finally released on Steam 
as well, in order to draw yet 
more players. Meanwhile 
Jagex is also taking its 
expertise and utilising it in a 
third-party publishing arm.

‘What Hideo Kojima did next’ sums up this entry. The 
Metal Gear veteran split from Konami in 2015 to make 
Death Stranding, a title that launched at the very start of 
our Develop 100 year in early December 2019. 
Kojima Productions already existed in name as a Konami 
subsidiary, but having split away, Kojima had to rebuild the 
team, largely with Konami veterans, in order to create his 
latest title. 
It’s one of the few titles 
that had strong appeal 
across all our key regions, 
propelling the studio onto 
the list despite it being 
its only title, and with no 
paid DLC released to date 
either.

King has gained fame from their astronomically successful 
cross-platform franchise Candy Crush franchise, which 
includes Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Candy 
Crash Jelly Saga and Candy Crush Friends Saga. Activision 
Blizzard acquired the developer in 2016 for $5.9bn.
Five years after its mobile release, the Candy Crush Saga 
series has received over 2.73bn downloads. 
According to Sensor 
Tower estimates, the 
series has generated 
a collective $1.5bn 
in microtransaction

an absolutely enormous 
average daily spend of  
$4.2m. Truly Kingly.

Beijing-based Long Tech Network has a big hit on its hands 
with Last Shelter: Survival. Even just looking at the offi  cial 
Google and Apple stores, it’s clear the game has a huge 
following, giving it a high ranking in Sensor Tower’s top 
100 earning titles for the last year. 
The MMO zombie strategy game has many of the typical 
genre tropes, with players throwing up complex bases 
very quickly. 
That makes the 
experience much like 
Long Tech’s own, which 
only started in 2015 with

numbers over 160. It has

Casual multiplayer title AFK Arena surpassed 6.6 million

Mixi
Mediatonic
Mixi is a Japanese company founded in 1999. It’s also 
known for its social networking site of the same name, but 
its relevance to this list however lies in its gaming efforts, 
namely in developing and publishing iOS and Android title 
Monster Strike. 
By 2018 the game had surpassed Puzzle & Dragons to 
become the highest-grossing mobile game of all time, 
and has grossed a total 
revenue of at least $8.13 
billion as of 2019.
Gameplay blends 
Pokemon-style monster 
collecting with flicking 
your monsters in to 
battle a la Puzzle Bobble.
London-based Mediatonic has been busy since its 
founding back in 2005, having released over 100 games.
In more recent times however, the company has hit upon  
a genius formula in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout.
The knockabout, assault course, battle royale title 
has undoubtedly put the studio on the map. The game 
launched as a free title to PS Plus subscribers, as well 
as a simultaneous PC 
launch. Within 24 hours 
of release, the game had 
drawn over 1.5 million 
players. By August 2020, 
Fall Guys had become 
the most downloaded PS 
Plus game of all time.

Chinese studio miHoYo is the developer behind the 
smash-hit free to play title Genshin Impact. The company 
was founded by three Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
students, united by their love of anime.
The studio has released a number of games since its 
founding in 2011, such as Guns GirlZ and Honkai Impact 3rd, 
but Genshin Impact is by far its most successful title  
to date.
Upon the game’s launch 
on September 28th 2020 on 
PC, PS4 and mobile devices, 
Genshin Impact became an 
overnight sensation. Within 
its first week after release 
itwas downloaded 17m times. 
The game 
grossed over 
$393 million on 
mobile devices 
within two 
months, making 
Genshin Impact 
the second 
biggest mobile 
game launch in 
history, after 
Honor of Kings.
The action 
RPG title blends an open world environment with a battle 
system using elemental powers and gacha character 
switching. Up to four players can form a party to fight 
togther, while some elements of its gameplay and style 
have been compared to Nintendo’s Zelda Breath of the Wild.
Speaking of which, miHoYo is now planning on releasing 
Genshin Impact on the Nintendo Switch (and PS5 too).

Founded as an independent studio back in 2009 by Markus 
“Notch” Persson, the studio then just called Mojang, this 
Swedish developer has certainly come a long way from the 
early days of Minecraft’s first publicly-released alpha stage. 
The studio was founded around the development and 
release of the ubiquitous sandbox title Minecraft –  
a game that would go on to dominate the gaming 
landscape, eventually 
becoming the best-
selling games of all time.
To date the game has 
sold 200m copies, and 
has 126m monthly active 
users. That success has 
prompted multiple spin-
off titles, such 
as Minecraft: 
Story Mode 
(developed 
by TellTale 
Games) as 
well as the 
augmented 
reality title 
Minecraft 
Earth, which 
was also developed by Mojang Studios.
More recently the studio released Minecraft Dungeons, 
which was developed by Mojang in collaboration with 
Double Eleven, the first new Minecraft game by the studio 
since the original’s release.
In November 2014, the studio was acquired by Microsoft 
for $2.5bn and was later rebranded as Mojang Studios in 
May 2020. It seemed like a lot of money then, it wasn’t. 
Mojang Studios 
Shanghai-based Moonton has launched a raft of games 
under its Mobile Legends IP, but it’s the 2016 Mobile 
Legends: Bang Bang that is performing best for the 
300-person company and secures its place in our list. 
The 5v5 mobile MOBA title has grown its roster from 10 
to 103 heroes since release, providing a steady income 
stream. Its success has brought attention, though, with 
Tencent and Riot taking 
legal action in 2018 for 
plagiarism and winning.
Despite that the title 
continues to flourish, 
being one of the few 
mobile MOBAs to have 
also thrived in the  
US market.
Moon Active is a startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel, that 
focuses on iOS, Android and Facebook games. The

The studio is perhaps best known as the creator of the 
hugely successful casual free to play mobile title Coin 
Master – which was released back in 2015 and is currently 
the highest-grossing 
mobile game in the UK.
As of October 2019, 
Coin Master has seen 
over 81m downloads, and 
has grossed in excess of 
$508m in gross revenue 
in its lifetime.

Disney’s curiously limbless yet adorable Tsum Tsums

the usual Match-3 genre. Developed by Tokyo-based  
NHN PlayArt and operated by LINE, Disney Tsum Tsum  
has been a huge success alongside the collectible  
plush toyline.  
In fact, Disney Tsum Tsum appears to be the best-

Nat Games was acquired by the goliath Nexon (best 
known for Dungeon 
Fighter Online) back in 
May 2018. In recent

Uncharted protagonist Nathan Drake may have gone into 
retirement back in 2016, but that hasn’t kept Naughty Dog 
from having an absolute blockbuster of a year in 2020, 
following the June 19 release of The Last of Us Part II.
Predictably, the game did pretty well. The Last of Us Part 
II is one of the best-selling Playstation 4 games of all time, 
in part thanks to launching 
late into the console’s life. 
It is also the fastest-selling 
PlayStation 4 exclusive, with 
over four million units sold in 
its release weekend .
The Last of Us Part II was 
the biggest launch of 2020 
in terms of 
both physical 
and digital 
sales (though 
at the time of 
writing, CD 
Projekt Red’s 
Cyberpunk 
2077 has yet to 
release, so this 
may change).
The game is on 
every game of the year list under the sun, and has swept 
multiple awards this year. In November 2020 the game 
went home from the Golden Joysticks with 6 awards – 
winning in every category in which it was nominated.
The original game in the series remains popular too, The 
Last of Us is among the best-selling games on the PS3, and 
The Last of Us Remastered is one of the best selling PS4 
games of all time.

Most of Nintendo’s first-party efforts are grouped under its 
gigantic Nintendo EPD group. But the perennial Mario Party 
series is the sole domain of Nintendo subsidiary NDcube . 
That even a smaller Mario title, such as Super Mario Party, 
can put a developer on our list is a testament to the power 
of both the IP and the Switch. The series’ consistent success 
over the last decade is down to series director, now company 
CEO, Shuichiro Nishiya. Who has upheld the quality bar set by 
Nintendo itself. 
The company also 
made the well-received

Ed Boon’s Chicago-based studio creates (literally) 
incredible fighting games. The Warner Bros subsidiary 
has done just that with title after title, most recently with 
Mortal Kombat 11 – available on all console formats.
 The game actually launched back in Spring 2019, but it’s 
a testament to its staying power that the studio makes 
our top 100 without a flagpole release in our qualifying 
period, with big earnings 
in both the US and EU. 
Recently the game has 
added both Rambo and 
Terminator characters to 
its roster, and with cross-
play now set to unite the 
community, it’s a game 
with a lot more potential.
Beginning life back in 2001 as an independent developer, 
Neople was later acquired by Nexon back in 2008. The 
South Korean studio is primarily known as the creator  
of Dungeon Fighter Online. 
Although the game was released in 2005, the game 
remains incredibly popular, and is one of the most played 
and highest grossing games of all time. The game has 
exceeded 700m players 
worldwide, and as of 
May 2020 has grossed 
$15bn in lifetime 
revenue – Making it one 
of the highest-grossing 
entertainment media 
products of all time.

NetEase is a goliath of gaming. In its third quarter of 
2020 alone it posted revenues of $2bn, an increase of 
20 per cent year on year. If we could actually identify its 
various internal teams, they would likely all have their own 
individual presences on this list.
That said, no one of Netease’s titles are on the scale 
of Game for Peace, or Honor of Kings, but its strength in 
depth is incredible, and also gives it a stability that places it  
above almost anyone, bar arch rival Tencent.
Fantasy Westward Journey remains the firm’s top-
grossing title, and that’s after almost 20 years of incredible 
returns on PC. 
The mobile version of the popular MMORPG, launched in 
2015, now takes the lead but the brand remains as strong, 
if not stronger, than ever. 
On mobile, at least, that title is closely followed in 
revenues by Netease’s battle royale effort, Knives Out  
(not to be confused with the excellent film of the same 
name). Also notable are Identity V, an asymmetrical 
multiplayer horror titles and Onmyoji, with its fantasy  
turn-based battles. It’s also launched the Marvel Super  
War MOBA, although that doesn’t seem to be getting a 
global release.

Next Level Games is an independent developer 
established in 2002. While the studios’ first project 
was NHL Hitz Pro, it is perhaps better known for its 
collaboration with Nintendo.
The studio has developed the Mario Strikers games, 
Punch Out!! for the Wii, 3DS titles Luigi’s Mansion 2 and 
Metroid Prime: Federation Force, and most recently – 
2019’s Luigi’s Mansion 3.
The latter in particular 
proved successful for 
the studio, attracting 
positive reviews and 
receiving the ‘Best 
Family Game’ award at 
The Game Awards 2019. 
South Korea’s mobile gaming giant recently posted Q3 
results of $535m in total revenue up 3.6 per cent year on 
year. Behind that success lies its perennial earner, the 
UE4-powered MMO Lineage 2 Revolution. 
The company has also shown itself adept at making  
the most of licensed IPs. A big title for the last 12  
months was The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross, based  
on the successful 
manga and anime 
series (which is shown

Formerly known as Niantic Labs, this San Francisco-based 
studio has seen enormous success with its augmented 
reality mobile titles Ingress, Pokémon Go, and Harry Potter: 
Wizards Unite. 
Pokémon Go has been a particular success story, 
boasting a lifetime revenue of over $4bn, with $1bn earned 
in 2020 alone – despite the COVID-19 pandemic limiting 
player’s mobility.
Niantic attracted 
enormous mainstream 
attention following the 
2016 launch of Pokémon 
Go – And even got a 
shoutout during Hilary 
Clinton’s unsuccessful 
Presidential run.
Yes, you know Hero Wars, it’s the game advertised by 
those everpresent lava/treasure/acid/hero ‘puzzles’ at 
the bottom of every page on the internet. Well it turns out 
that those ads really work, and the game behind them has 
captured players’ attention too, notching up a very healthy 
revenue stream, 
propelling creator 
Nexters into our 
cohort this year. 
Privately-owned 
Nexters is based in 
Cyprus, from which 
it also operates RTS 
title Throne Rush and 
Island Experiment, an 
adventure-puzzle title.

After the disappointment of the Wii U, Nintendo has 
bounced back in spectacular fashion with the Switch, 
which seems to print money – thanks to both its own titles 
and strong indie sales on its digital store. The console has 
performed fantastically for Nintendo – particularly during 
2020, with sales boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The console now sits 
at over 68.3m units sold 
in its lifetime, off ering an 
enormous user base for 
Nintendo’s fi rst party titles.
As such the Switch has 
seen a lot of popular remakes 
and re-releases of Nintendo’s 
back catalogue, 
such as Mario 
Kart 8 and The 
Legend of Zelda: 
Link’s Awakening 
(co-developed 
with Grezzo).
By far the 
company’s 
biggest success 
story last year 
was Animal 
Crossing: New Horizons. The game released at absolutely 
the right time: March 2020, right as the pandemic forced 
countries worldwide into lockdown, and towards gaming – 
particularly social games. 
As such, the game surpassed its lifetime sales 
expectations within its fi rst two months, and is now the 
second-best selling game in Japan of all time, beaten 
only by Game Freak’s Pokémon Red and Blue.

PES Productions – Konami
Pearl Abyss
Based out of Istanbul, Peak Games is now part of the 
growing Zynga family, having been acquired for a massive 
$1.8bn in June of last year. The deal was Zynga’s largest 
to date and the key prizes were Toy Blast and Toon Blast, 
puzzle titles which have performed incredibly well in 
recent years – with a 
total DAUs of 12m at 
the time of purchase. 
By Sensor Tower’s 
reckoning Toon Blast 
was Zynga’s biggest 
single grossing title, 
but the original Toy 
Blast is also pulling in 
a huge chunk of cash 
annually as well. 
In the western media, much has been made of Konami’s 
focus on mobile titles for its home market rather than 
attempting to repeat past glories on console. 
However, based on the earnings of titles such as Pro 
Yakyuu Spirits (or Professional Baseball Spirits to give its 
westernised title), this is a sound move for the company.
One of the top earners globally, it competed with the 
likes of Brawl Stars and Call of Duty: Mobile in terms of 
total revenues from 
offi  cial app stores. 
The title was 
developed by Osaka-
based PawaPuro 
Productions, a part 
of Konami’s internal 
development team.

The eFootball PES series remains a strong alternative to 
FIFA. And in terms of the mobile version of the game, PES 
appears to be ahead of its rival, with Sensor Tower putting 
the game in its top 100 titles globally in offi  cial app stores. 
PES Productions approach the mobile version by trying 
to stay as true as possible to the console gameplay..
The well-received 2020 version of the game only got 
a ‘Season Update’ for 
2021, eff ectively new 
stats and lineups for the 
current game. That’s 
because PES Productions 
is working on an all-new 
next-gen version for PS5 
and Xbox Series consoles 
to launch in late 2021. 
Pearl Abyss is a Korean developer best known for the 
MMORPG Black Desert Online, Black Desert Mobile and 
Shadow Arena. 
Pearl Abyss has reached over 30 million players in over 
150 countries through Black Desert Online, earning a 
lifetime revenue of $1.5 billion worldwide.
The developer is currently working on Crimson Desert, a 
PC and console title that 
was originally planned 
to act as a prequel title 
to Black Desert. As the 
game’s development 
went on however, 
it became a new, 
standalone IP with a new 
story and characters.

Playdemic earns its place here for the continuing 
success of its smash-hit multiplayer title Golf Clash 
– the undoubted king of casual golf games. With the 
Manchester-based developer having increased in size to 
around 65 staff in recent years as a result. 
Playdemic’s future isn’t just beautiful links and keen 
competition, though. Acquired in 2017 by Warner Bros 
subsidiary TT Games, it’s 
also been set to work on 
developing mobile titles 
using the LEGO IP. 
To that end it’s been 
involved in the soft-launched 
LEGO Star Wars Battle, which 
is being led by sibling studio 
TT Brighton.

Founded and headquartered in Israel, with offices around 
the globe, Plarium was acquired by Aristocrat back in 2017 
for $500m. Other

Headquartered in Herzliya, Israel, Playtika has now 
expanded to 4,000 employees in offices around the world. 
It also has expanded into multiple genres, such as puzzle, 
hidden object and solitaire titles.
That said, the company’s biggest titles remain in the 
social casino genre, with titles such as Slotomania Free 
Slots: Casino Slot Machine Games, Bingo Blitz - Bingo  
games, and House of Fun - Casino Slots. 
The company 
acquired Helsinki 
developer Seriously 
last year, creator 
of Best Fiends and 
Berlin-based Wooga 
(June’s Journey) the 
year before. 
Founded in Russia, but headquartered in Dublin, Playrix 
is an incredible success story, with 18 offices around the 
world and over 2,000 employees. Its strength in depth 
is impressive, with four top earners in the last year: 
Township, Gardenscapes, Homescapes, Fishdom.
Its consistency in driving massive hits is incredible. 
Most titles blend Match-3 gameplay with other activities. 
The formula let the developer soar over 1bn downloads 
across its catalogue 
of titles last year. 
Gardenscapes even 
pulled in more than 
Candy Crush Saga 
some months, the 
first time its been 
topped since 2012.

PUBG Studio
Founded in 2000, this studio is best known for its 
breakout hit, Rocket League. Launched in 2015, and free 
on Playstation Plus upon release, the game has had long-
lasting success, eventually going free to play in 2020.
The game is actually a sequel to Psyonix’s Supersonic 
Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, but has far 
outshone its predecessor in terms of success.
Rocket League proved 
immediately popular, 
seeing 5m downloads 
and 179,000 concurrent 
players in its launch 
month of July 2015. As 
of September 2018, the 
game had seen 50 million 
players since launch.
Product Madness was acquired by Aristocrat back in 
2012. The deal brought together an expert in the social 
casino genre with a manufacturer of real-world casino slot 
machines, and the combination has proved irresistible to 
fans of the genre. 
Cashman Casino Las Vegas Slots, Lightning Link Casino 
Slots and Heart of Vegas Casino Slots, were all top 100 
grossing apps according 
to Sensor Tower over 
the last year. To support

Now over ten years old, League of Legends continues 
to dominate the MOBA space on PC. Still the biggest 
competitive game around, last year’s World Championship 
was watched by over 100m viewers. The Tencent-
owned company is based in Los Angeles, amongst 24 
offices worldwide. Recent news is split between two 
titles. Valorant is Riot’s effort to dethrone CS:GO with 
a competitively-
focused shooter. 
While League’s mobile 
spin-off Wild Rift, in 
soft launch, finally 
allows Riot to compete 
directly with the 
innumerable mobile 
League clones. 
After more than a few name changes, the Seoul-based 
developers of the ongoing PC phenomenon are now called 
PUBG Studio, a part of Krafton, which handles publishing 
duties. To date the PC title has sold over 70m copies and 
despite tough competition in the genre it created, the 
original retains a huge 
audience globally. 
PlayerUnknown’s

Roblox Corporation is the creators of the multi-platform, 
free-to-play phenomenon Roblox.
Although the game was released all the way back in 2006, 
the game was relatively small until it found significant 
success in the 2010s, and now boasts over 164m monthly 
active users as of August 2020, and is played by over half of 
all children under 16 in the USA.
For most of the 
game’s history, 
however, the  
game’s player base  
was relatively small  
due to co-founder 
David Baszucki being 
uninterested in press 
coverage, and 
the game getting 
drowned out by 
other platforms 
released around 
the same time.
The game’s 
success lies not in 
simply attracting 
players, but in 
turning them 
into creators, its 
this community which generates the practically endless 
content that its player-base enjoys. 
Roblox then spreads the wealth around, with creators on 
the platform being projected to have earned a combined 
$250m over the course of 2020. 
Roblox Corporation is valued at $4 billion, with the iOS 
version of the game passing a lifetime revenue of $2 billion 
in October 2020. An upcoming IPO is being watched keenly.
Respawn Entertainment was founded in 2010 by Jason 
West and Vince Zampella, who previously co-founded 
Infinity Ward (which also features on this list) and created 
the Call of Duty franchise. Now that’s a CV.
The studios first effort was the Titanfall franchise, But 
today Respawn is primarily known as the creator of battle 
royale hit Apex Legends – which boasted 50 million players 
within its first month when 
launched in February 2019. 
Apex Legends has proved 
so popular that EA not only 
expects the game to hit $1 
billion lifetime revenue in 
2021, but based on its current 
trajectory the publisher 
expects it to earn $1 billion a year. Now into its seventh 
season the game’s season pass model is flourishing 
More recently the studio was behind the November 2019 
title Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which sold more than ten 
million copies by the end of March 2020. The game has 
proved remarkably popular in the states, where it’s one of 
the best selling games of the year – ranking second, beaten 
only by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The game cleverly 
blends mechanics from Uncharted and Dark Souls.

Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit I, previously Business 
Division 1, is the area of Square Enix responsible for the 
Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts franchises.
The studio was formed in 2019, following a restructuring 
at the company which combined Business Division 1, (who 
handled the mainline Final Fantasy series), with Business 
Division 3 (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy spin-offs and the 
SaGa series) and Business 
Division 4 (who handled the 
Final Fantasy spin-offs that 
are produced alongside 
external companies).
The unit is led by Yoshinori 
Kitase, who was the leader of 
Business Division 1 and acted 
as director 
on some of 
Square Enix’s 
biggest titles, 
including the 
original Final 
Fantasy VII
Most notably 
in 2020, 
Business 
Division 1 was 
responsible 
for the long, long anticipated release of Final Fantasy VII 
Remake, a recreation and re-imagining of one of Square 
Enix’s most beloved titles. 
Upon its release,Final Fantasy VII Remake proved an 
instant sensation: selling  3.5m copies worldwide within 
three days, and being received warmly by critics. As  
of August 2020, the game has sold over five million  
copies worldwide.
Smilegate Entertainment is the studio behind the colossal 
free-to-play shooter hit Crossfire. Undeniably the leading 
shooter across the asian markets, the game boasts 8m 
concurrent players and 650m registered users. It’s also 
available in 80 countries worldwide. 
The free-to-play military FPS had grossed over $10.8bn 
lifetime as of 2018 and has appeared consistently on the 
top-grossing PC games lists 
from Superdata since then. 
Smilegate’s total revenues 
in 2018 were $703m, led by 
Crossfire’s earnings. 
First released way back in 
2007, the game now includes 
almost innumerable game 
modes and maps, as well as characters and weapons –  
all of which are based around real-world guns and special 
forces units.
An Xbox-exclusive spin-off, CrossfireX is in the offing, 
with a campaign provided by no less than Remedy 
Entertainment. Although that title has been delayed 
until an undecided date in 2021. In addition, Smilegate 
Entertainment also launched VR title Rogan: The Thief in 
the Castle in 2019, which received an Epic Mega Grant.

responsible for the highly-successful RPG Epic 7, a  
top-earner in asian markets which has also received  
a global release.
Launched in early 
2017 the RPG stands

globally, selling over 2.4 million copies in its first three  
days after release. 
That made Ghost of

Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studios is a Chinese studio with 
offi  ces in Shenzhen, Los Angeles, Chengdu and Shanghai. 
TiMi Studios was founded in 2008, and was originally 
named Jade Studio. 
The studio changed its name back in 2014 after it 
merged with Wolong Studio and Tianmeiyiyou Studio – 
forming TiMi. 
The company is 
responsible for a number of 
titles, but is perhaps most 
famous for developing the 
mobile game Honor of Kings, 
adapted as Arena of Valor in 
western regions. Honor of 
Kings, released in 2015 on 
Android and iOS 
devices, is one of 
the most popular 
and highest-
grossing games in 
the world, and is the 
most downloaded 
app globally. 
Honor of Kings 
has seen over 100 
million daily active 
players, as of 
November 2020.
As of March 2019, the world’s most lucrative game had 
surpassed $4.5 billion in lifetime revenue, since its launch 
in October 2015. 
The game has seen the lion’s share of its revenue 
generated in China, but has seen signifi cant overseas 
success. According to Sensor Tower estimates, the game 
has generated over $200 million outside of China.
Arguably the biggest game in the world right now is PUBG 
Mobile, or Game For Peace as its modifi ed Chinese sibling 
is known. The mobile version of the original title sticks 
pretty close to the formula, but is entirely re-engineered 
to work on mobile devices. 
Lightspeed 
& Quantum is 
responsible for that 
reworking. The 
studio was founded 
in 2008 and is a part 
of Tencent, which 
publishes both 
PUBG Mobile and 
Game For Peace. 
The studio is also 
behind PUBG Mobile 
Lite, a spin-off  title 
running on Unreal 
Engine 4, which is 
then optimised  to 
work on more 
modest handsets. 
In a complete 
change of 
direction, the 
studio last year 
released The 
Everlasting Regret, 
a beautiful puzzle 
game based on 
a classic poem and rendered in a period-perfect Tang 
dynasty art style – one that won’t trouble the censors.
The studio also got a new sibling recently, with 
Lightspeed LA being launched back in July 2020. Led by 
Rockstar veteran Steve Martin, it promises to develop 
triple-A titles.

The Just Dance franchise has been particularly 
successful for Ubisoft, on which Ubisoft Paris has 
collaborated with the likes of Ubisoft Pune, Ubisoft 
Shanghai and Ubisoft Bordeaux.
Just Dance 2020 was the last in the franchise to release 
on the Nintendo Wii –

It’s been a busy year for Ubisoft Montreal, with the recent 
release of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla – the first in the series 
to launch on the new generation of consoles.
Ubisoft Montreal was founded in April 1997, as part of 
Ubisoft’s expansion into worldwide markets at the time.
The studio is one of the largest in the world, with over 
3,500 employees. 
Ubisoft Montreal is so 
influential that it is credited 
for helping to establish 
Montreal as a creative city, 
and cementing it as a local 
hub for the games industry. 
No doubt boosted by 
releasing as a next-gen 
launch title,  
Assassin’s Creed 
Valhalla sold more 
copies in the first 
week of release 
than any previous 
Assassin’s Creed 
title, with Ubisoft 
confirming it  
had over 1.8 
million players  
on November

Ubisoft Montreal has a long-standing relationship with 
the Assassin’s Creed franchise, having worked on the

including Assassin’s Creed Origins, as well as Odyssey, 
on which Ubisoft Paris collaborated with sister studios 
Ubisoft Quebec, Ubisoft Singapore and Ubisoft Milan.

Visual Concepts Entertainment is an American developer 
based in Novato, California. 
The studio specialises in sports games in the 2K 
franchise, particularly NBA 2K and WWE 2K. 
Visual Concepts was founded in 1988, before being 
acquired by Sega in 1999 and eventually being sold to 
Take-Two Interactive in January 2005. 
It was this acquisition by 
Take-Two that led to the 
creation of the 2K label, of 
which the studio’s NBA 2K 
and WWE 2K franchises are 
both a part, alongside other 
franchises, such as the likes 
of Bioshock and Borderlands.
The NBA 
2K franchise 
has been 
particularly 
successful – 
according to 
Take-Two 
Interactive, 
NBA 2K20 
made over 
$1 billion in 
combined 
sales and microtransaction revenues in just its first year. 
The followup, NBA 2K21 has sold 5 million copies to date, 
following its release in September 2020.
Things are looking less rosy for the WWE 2K franchise, 
however. The most recent entry, WWE 2K20 was roundly 
panned by fans and critics alike, due to releasing with a 
number of serious bugs. In turn, WWE 2K21 was cancelled, 
with the studio looking to jump to a next-gen version.

Valve
Established in 2007, Vizor Interactive is a Minsk-based 
developer responsible for a number of mobile titles.
The most recent, and most popular of their games is 
Klondike Adventures. 
Since its release in 2018, the game has been downloaded 
over 16 million times. In December of that year, the game 
earned $6.3m in monthly revenues. 
Between Q1 and 
Q3 2020, Klondike 
Adventures was the 
third-highest grossing 
mobile simulation title 
in the United States, 
generating just  
over $80m. 
Although much of Valve’s attention has been focused on 
its Steam storefront in recent years, the company remains 
a household name in the industry, and continues to draw 
significant revenue from its back catalogue alone  
– Counterstrike and DoTA 2, in particular.
This year Valve made a surprise return to the Half Life 
franchise, after a 13 year hiatus. While Half Life: Alyx’s 
sales were likely limited 
by being a VR-only title, 
the game saw a total of 
860,000 players in March, 
following its release on 
the 23rd, as well as  
being received warmly  
by critics.

Whilst Wargaming has seen success with various spin-offs, 
such as World of Warships, plus mobile and console takes 
on the formula, it’s the original World of Tanks on PC that 
continues to lead the charge. 
Developed by the team at its Minsk office, the free-to-
play title features a huge arsenal of over 600 real-world 
military vehicles, with a focus on PvP play – although PvE 
campaigns have been 
added in recent years.  
Its success has allowed 
its parent to branch out 
into other genres and 
even set up studios in 
the US and UK to more 
directly target audiences 
in western territories.

Chinese studio Yotta Games is responsible for the 
simulation game Mafia City, which is available on iOS and 
Android devices.
Despite releasing in 2017, the game has maintained an 
impressive level of success, listing in the top 10 grossing 
games worldwide in March, April and May 2019, according 
to SuperData.
The game is hugely 
popular in Japan, where 
it frequently finds itself 
in the top 15 highest-
grossing games. But it 
also has seen significant 
overseas success in the 
UK, US Germany and 
South Korea.
With offices in Shanghai and Tokyo, Yostar worked with 
developers Shanghai Manjuu and Xiamen Yongshi to 
create 2017’s Azur Lane, a side-scrolling shoot ‘em up with 
RPG elements. 
The game anthropomorphises actual World War 2 
battleships as female characters. It’s all bizarre as it 
sounds, with the predictable stylings you’d expect –  
a Dead or Alive beach 
volleyball crossover 
has just kicked off for 
instance. And that’s 
just one part of an ever 
growing empire around 
the title, which has 
proven incredibly popular 
in Japan and beyond.

Part of Warner Bros Interactive 
Entertainment, the Boston-
based studio leads development 
on strategy title Game of 
Thrones: Conquest. 
The mobile title appears 
to have outlasted its source 
material in popularity – thankfully 
the game’s developers never had 
to tackle that tricky ending.
Launched in 2017 to take 
advantage of the GoT hysteria, 
the game has proven to be 
consistently successful, with 
more than 20m downloads  
to date.
