Abstract: Conservation practitioners have long recognized ecological connectivity as a global priority for
preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function. In the early years of conservation science, ecologists extended
principles of island biogeography to assess connectivity based on source patch proximity and other metrics
derived from binary maps of habitat. From 2006 to 2008, the late Brad McRae introduced circuit theory as
an alternative approach to model gene flow and the dispersal or movement routes of organisms. He posited
concepts and metrics from electrical circuit theory as a robust way to quantify movement across multiple
possible paths in a landscape, not just a single least-cost path or corridor. Circuit theory offers many theoretical,
conceptual, and practical linkages to conservation science. We reviewed 459 recent studies citing circuit theory
or the open-source software Circuitscape. We focused on applications of circuit theory to the science and
practice of connectivity conservation, including topics in landscape and population genetics, movement and
dispersal paths of organisms, anthropogenic barriers to connectivity, fire behavior, water flow, and ecosystem
services. Circuit theory is likely to have an effect on conservation science and practitioners through improved
insights into landscape dynamics, animal movement, and habitat-use studies and through the development
of new software tools for data analysis and visualization. The influence of circuit theory on conservation
comes from the theoretical basis and elegance of the approach and the powerful collaborations and active
user community that have emerged. Circuit theory provides a springboard for ecological understanding and
will remain an important conservation tool for researchers and practitioners around the globe.

base te´orica y la elegancia de la estrategia y de las colaboraciones fuertes y la comunidad activa de usuarios

Introduction
Ecological connectivity is a global priority for preserving
biodiversity and ecosystem function (UNEP 2015; IUCN
2017) and has long been of interest to conservation sci-
entists (Harris 1984). In the early years of conservation
science, ecologists extended principles of island biogeog-
raphy to assess connectivity based on proximity to source
patches (MacArthur & Wilson 1967) and other metrics
derivable from binary maps containing habitat patches
embedded in a nonhabitat matrix (e.g., With et al. 1997).
The introduction of least-cost modeling in the early 1990s
(Knaapen et al. 1992) was a major advancement in con-
nectivity and movement corridor research and quickly
became the dominant paradigm for evaluating connectiv-
ity for animals. However, least-cost paths often have clear
limitations, including an assumption that individuals have
perfect knowledge of the landscape and therefore select
a single optimal route.
In 3 papers published from 2006 to 2008, Brad McRae
introduced circuit theory to many ecologists and con-
servation scientists as an alternative, process-driven ap-
proach to modeling gene flow and the dispersal or
movement routes of organisms (see below). Drawing
from his background in electrical engineering, as well
as the seminal work of Doyle and Snell (1984) and oth-
ers, McRae’s key innovation was recognizing that circuit
theory permitted a robust way to quantify gene flow.
The approach provided a much-needed theoretical basis
for understanding and mapping patterns of connectiv-
ity and has been rapidly adopted in conservation sci-
ence, other ecological disciplines, and beyond. The de-
velopment of accompanying software, such as the open-
source program Circuitscape (McRae et al. 2008, 2013;
www.circuitscape.org), has provided accessible means
of implementing circuit theory concepts across a range
of projects and disciplines. Additional software and devel-
opment topics are described in Supporting Information.

In the wake of Brad McRae’s untimely death in July
2017 (Lawler et al. 2018), we explored the importance
and key contributions of circuit theory to connectivity
conservation and related issues. We considered the foun-
dations of circuit theory, including key concepts, out-
puts, and comparisons with other approaches to evaluat-
ing connectivity and the theory’s diversity of applications
in conservation and ecology, including a synthesis of rel-
evant publications across a variety of topics and from
multiple geographies. Finally, we considered how new
applications of circuit theory might continue to benefit
conservation theory and practice, particularly in an era
of global change.
Foundations of Circuit Theory in Conservation
Brad McRae posited circuit theory as an elegant alterna-
tive approach to model gene flow and organismal move-
ment in a series of 3 papers published during 2006–2008.
McRae (2006) linked the findings of Doyle and Snell
(1984) and Chandra et al. (1996) to population genet-
ics and landscape ecology. Specifically, Doyle and Snell
(1984) demonstrated that resistance distances from cir-
cuit theory are directly proportional to the movements
of Markovian random walkers on graphs, and Chandra
et al. (1996) related resistance distances to “commute
times,” or the time it takes a random walker to travel
from one point to another and back again. McRae (2006)
described the concept that the genetic distance among
subpopulations of interest can be estimated by represent-
ing the landscape as a circuit board, where each pixel
in a raster depiction of the landscape is a resistor, and
gene flow between any 2 subpopulations occurs via all
possible chains of resistors linking them, not just along
the single chain with the lowest sum of resistances (i.e.,
the least-cost path). He coined this notion “isolation by
resistance” (IBR), which has practical consequences in
the context of conservation. For example, in IBR (but
not least-cost models) increasing the number of paths
always decreases the total resistance and genetic distance
among subpopulations, and habitat degradation increases
genetic distance, even outside the least-cost path. Its theo-
retical foundation and computational efficiency has made
circuit theory a powerful and defensible tool for under-
standing potential gene flow, animal movement routes,
and landscape connectivity.
The second foundational paper (McRae & Beier 2007)
demonstrated that IBR explained genetic patterns of
mammal (wolverine [Gulo gulo]) and plant (bigleaf
mahogany [Swetenia macrophylla]) populations about
50–200% better than 2 conventional approaches, namely
isolation by distance and least-cost paths. The findings
were striking because the species were undergoing rapid
human-caused demographic changes, violating the IBR
model assumption that all populations are in genetic
equilibrium (i.e., based on the response variable, FST).
This robustness suggested that circuit theory could be
applied to the variety of other landscapes experiencing
human-caused changes.
Finally, McRae et al. (2008) introduced many readers
to the key concepts and metrics used in electrical circuit
theory and how they could be applied to model and map
the process of connectivity over extensive landscape,
habitat, or population networks (based on georeferenced
raster grids). Two of the most commonly used metrics
include current density and effective resistance. Current
density provides an estimate of the net movement prob-
abilities (or flow) of random walkers through a given
grid cell. Effective resistance permits a pairwise distance-
based measure of isolation among populations or sites
(McRae & Beier 2007). McRae et al. (2008) illustrated
how circuit theory could be used to identify multiple
(i.e., redundant) movement pathways or habitat corridors
and reveal, for example, critical pinch points that con-
strain potential flow between focal areas. Redundancy is
a measure of the number of possible pathways between
focal points and reflects a fundamental relationship that
is the ratio of least-cost distance to effective resistance
(see Koen et al. [2012] and Marrotte and Bowman [2017]
for in-depth treatments of this topic). Because circuit the-
ory uses the same underlying landscape resistance data
used by least-cost and other connectivity models, it could
readily be added to the toolkits of conservation planners.
In addition, McRae et al. (2008) introduced many readers
to Circuitscape software, opening the door to diverse
applications.
Applications of Circuit Theory to Conservation
Circuit theory has been applied to a wide range of conser-
vation questions and challenges. Because Circuitscape is
the principal tool that researchers and practitioners use
to apply the method, we reviewed 459 papers identi-
fied through either a Web of Science or Google Scholar
search of work that cited McRae et al. (2008) or the Cir-
cuitscape user guide (McRae & Shah 2009; McRae et al.
2013). Of these studies, 277 directly used the software.
Applications ranged across disciplines from conservation
to evolutionary biology, from anthropology to epidemi-
ology, and more. Circuitscape has been applied on every
continent (including off the coast of Antarctica [Dambach
et al. 2016]), and several applications spanned multiple
continents (e.g., Lawler et al. 2013; Tassi et al. 2015)
(Fig. 1). Whatever the geographic or conservation con-
text, Circuitscape has been most frequently applied to
single, focal species, though studies of 2 or more species
are becoming more common (Fig. 2). The vast majority of
studies addressed animals (n = 228), but 10 focused on
plants and 1 on protists (Dong et al. 2016). Mammals were
by far the most common vertebrates studied, followed by
birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, though arthropods
have been studied almost as frequently as birds (Fig. 3).

At least 5 mammal-focused studies addressed human ge-
nomics or movement patterns.
We examined the impressive range and diversity of
circuit-theoretic and Circuitscape applications and con-
sidered how circuit theory has been used to understand
landscape and population genetics, the movement and
dispersal paths of organisms, anthropogenic barriers to
connectivity, fire behavior, water flow, and ecosystem
services. Additional topic areas and examples are given
in Supporting Information.
Landscape and Population Genetics
The foundational papers on circuit theory energized
the emerging field of landscape genetics (Guillot et al.
2009; Manel & Holderegger 2013). Use of genetic data
to inform models of landscape resistance to movement
with circuit theory has since become standard practice
(Zeller et al. 2012; Simpkins et al. 2018). This informa-
tion has been useful in formalizing the incorporation of
landscape structure and complexity into conservation
plans for many species and ecosystems. For example, the
multispecies Washington Connected Landscapes project
(WWHCWG 2010) incorporated mountain goat (Oream-
nos americanus) connectivity based on genetic circuit-
theory models (Shirk et al. 2010), and the Washington-
British Columbia Climate-Connectivity project (Krosby

et al. 2016) spurred additional research based on genetic
and circuit theoretic approaches for assessing potential
impacts and adaptation actions under climate change
(Parks et al. 2015). Circuit theory has been used in mul-
tiple ways to explore the potential impacts of climate
change on landscape genetics. A few studies explored
how historical changes to Earth’s climate have affected
connectivity, resulting in modern genetic patterns (Bell
et al. 2010; Ortego et al. 2015), or have examined the im-
pact climate change will have on future genetic patterns
(Velo-Anton et al. 2013).
Despite its widespread use and contributions, the ap-
plication of circuit theory in genetics is not yet fully real-
ized. Initial statistical approaches based on comparing in-
terindividual genetic distances with resistance distances
(e.g., with Mantel tests) often led to faulty inferences
by incorrectly assuming linearity, ignoring spatial struc-
ture in the data, and failing to recognize that genetic
distances can be affected by variable local population
density (Legendre & Fortin 2010; Jaqui´ery et al. 2011;
Graves et al. 2013). Other recent approaches use appro-
priate probability distributions for distance data (Hanks &
Hooten 2013) and newer IBR models accommodate vari-
ation in population sizes to some extent (Petkova et al.
2016). Even if the basic IBR model assumptions are met,
challenges remain in automating procedures for how to
weigh various environmental factors and how to account
for uncertainty in noisy estimates of landscape variables
(Dudaniec et al. 2016). In their comparison of microsatel-
lite genetic data sets with maps of current density derived
using circuit theory, Marrotte et al. (2017) found that
current density was not usually a good predictor of gene
flow for 4 terrestrial mammal species in Ontario, espe-
cially where habitat amount was high or pinch points
were observed. Overall, these and numerous other efforts
to extend circuit theory underscore its foundational and
future importance to landscape genetics.
Identifying and Conserving Pathways and Corridors for Animal Movement
Circuit theory was quickly taken up and applied by
conservation scientists and ecologists not only to pre-
dict population-level patterns of gene flow, but also to
understand how landscape features influence individual
movement paths and thus conservation and restoration
of habitat corridors and targeted studies of movement
(Dickson et al. 2013). The breadth of applications, along
with comparative method studies, has increased under-
standing of the strengths of circuit theory in conserva-
tion and highlights its complementarity with other meth-
ods for predicting movement, including least-cost paths
(e.g., Howey 2011; Mateo-Sanchez et al. 2015; Marrotte
& Bowman 2017). Circuit theory is particularly appropri-
ate when the assumption of moving individuals having
limited knowledge of the surrounding landscape is met
(McClure et al. 2016; Keeley et al. 2017; Maiorano et al.
2017).
Circuit theory’s basis in random-walk theory results in
an implicit assumption that individuals moving across
a landscape have no knowledge of relative resistance
beyond their immediate surroundings, making it par-
ticularly appropriate for modeling natal dispersal paths
(McRae et al. 2008). Applications to predicting dispersal
corridors for large, wide-ranging carnivores have been
common (e.g., Proctor et al. 2015; Ahmadi et al. 2017;
Gantchoff & Belant 2017; McClure et al. 2017), but
circuit theory has also been used to model amphib-
ian dispersal via surface water networks of Australia
(Bishop-Taylor et al. 2015), dispersal paths of subter-
ranean beetles via substratum karst systems (Rizzo et al.
2017), marine shrimp larvae dispersal via ocean currents
(Dambach et al. 2016), dispersal of early human pop-
ulations in Africa and the Caucasus (Tassi et al. 2015;
Tarkhnishvili et al. 2016), and even pathways of early
explorers (e.g., Hernando de Soto’s route through the
Appalachian Mountains in 1540 [Thayn et al. 2016]). Ad-
vantages of circuit theory may be less pronounced when
applied to the movements of individuals through known

Circuit Theory
landscapes. For example, circuit theory and least-cost
path models perform comparably in predicting seasonal
ungulate migration routes (Poor et al. 2012; McClure et al.
2016). Still, circuit theory is suitable for characterizing
relative frequency of routine movements along multi-
ple potential paths through urban and other fragmented
landscapes (e.g., Braaker et al. 2014; R¨odder et al. 2016;
Grafius et al. 2017).
Given its utility for predicting high-use animal move-
ment routes, researchers have applied circuit theory to
evaluate alternatives for establishment of protected areas
to enhance connectivity among populations (e.g., pumas
[Puma concolor] in the Atlantic Forest of southeast Brazil
[Castilho et al. 2015], forest understory birds in Costa
Rica [Fagan et al. 2016], and giant pandas [Ailuropoda
melanoleuca] in China’s Qinling Mountains [Wang et al.
2014]). Circuit theory models have also been used to iden-
tify corridors between occupied and unoccupied habitat
areas to promote recolonization of a species’ historic
range, or to identify areas suitable for habitat restora-
tion (e.g., Jarchow et al. 2016; Zi´ołkowska et al. 2016;
Gantchoff & Belant 2017). Similarly, other applications
have identified potential pathways for spread of invasive
species, diseases, and pathogens (details given in Sup-
porting Information).
Conservation scientists often wish to protect corridors
that promote movement of more than 1 species and
have used circuit theory to assess the functionality and
efficiency of potential multispecies corridors (e.g., Koen
et al. 2014; Bleyhl et al. 2017; Lechner et al. 2017). Several
studies (e.g., Epps et al. 2011; Breckheimer et al. 2014)
show that corridors designed for wide-ranging umbrella
species enhance connectivity for less vagile organisms
with similar habitat requirements, and Brodie et al. (2015)
found that multispecies corridors tailored to ecologically
similar species (e.g., carnivores and herbivores) can be
highly effective for all species. Dilkina et al. (2017) ex-
plored the cost-effectiveness of grizzly bear (Ursus arc-
tos) and wolverine corridors by optimizing corridor selec-
tion under a constrained budget. Even greater generality
can result from species-agnostic approaches to estimat-
ing ecological flows that base landscape resistance on
the degree to which habitats are unaltered or otherwise
modified by humans (e.g., Bennie et al. 2014; Dickson
et al. 2017).
Anthropogenic Barriers to Connectivity
Circuit theory has been used to determine how humans
impact movement corridors and where mitigating these
impacts might be most crucial to maintaining or restoring
connectivity. Understanding the effects of linear infras-
tructure such as transportation corridors and other bar-
riers (e.g., international boundary structures and fence
lines) on connectivity and gene flow was a primary impe-
tus for McRae’s interest in the theory and development
of Circuitscape (McRae 2006). Examples include work by
Litvaitis et al. (2015) that explores the potential effects
of roads on the movement of wide-ranging carnivores in
New Hampshire and work by Naidoo et al. (2018) exam-
ining barrier effects on movement corridors for African
elephants (Loxodonta africana). Guidance for direct ap-
plication of these approaches with transportation agen-
cies has been provided by Beier et al. (2011), and initial
explorations are underway that explicitly incorporate vol-
ume of traffic on highways into estimates of landscape
permeability (e.g., Theobald et al. 2012). Yet, work inte-
grating connectivity across transportation infrastructure,
particularly within the context of regional transporta-
tion planning, remains understudied (e.g., Mateo-Sanchez
et al. 2014), and this gap is especially important given the
ubiquity of transportation and its strong population and
genetic effects on various animals globally (Trombulak &
Frissell 2000). Beyond the impacts of transportation cor-
ridors, circuit-theory applications have addressed a wide
range of anthropogenic impacts on connectivity, includ-
ing urbanization, agriculture, and energy infrastructure
(Supporting Information).
More recent studies have assessed the vulnerability of
populations to climate change due to fragmentation that
could potentially impede adaptive shifts in distributions
(e.g., Leonard et al. 2017a). A number of studies used
Circuitscape to explicitly plan for climate-driven move-
ments. For example, Lawler et al. (2013) used species
distribution models to map the routes that organisms
might follow to track shifting climates, and Littlefield et al.
(2017) mapped connections between climatic conditions
today and where those conditions will be in the future
(i.e., climate analogs). These and other studies have used
Circuitscape to model climate, sea-level rise, range shifts,
and projections of climate-driven landscape change to
determine or anticipate the impact of climate change on
species and their movements.
Nontraditional and Emergent Applications of Circuit Theory
Fire Spread
Circuit theory has provided an intuitive analogue to the
process of wildfire movement (i.e., spread) across het-
erogeneous landscapes. The approach accommodates
important stochastic properties of wildfire by model-
ing probabilistic spread between adjacent neighbors in a
landscape network (Gray & Dickson 2015). Circuit theory
also accommodates the critical role of spatial context in
estimating fire likelihood because areas on the landscape
can burn far away from an ignition source. In this case,
circuit conductance (the inverse of resistance) is a sur-
rogate for the ease of fire spread across the landscape.
Fuels, topography, and other biophysical variables that
influence the spread of fire may be flexibly integrated into
a conductance surface in a circuit-theoretic model (Gray

& Dickson 2015, 2016). Resulting metrics (e.g., current
density and centrality) and maps of potential fire connec-
tivity can be used to target areas on the landscape where
fuel breaks could most effectively hinder fire movement
through wildlife habitat (Welch et al. 2015) and disrupt
the invasive grass-fire cycle (Gray & Dickson 2016). In
addition, wall-to-wall estimates of fire connectivity can be
useful to identify areas of highest fire likelihood across
a landscape and, consequently, the natural and human
infrastructure at greatest relative risk from wildfire (Gray
& Dickson 2015).
Water Flow
The electronic circuit analogy has been used in a vari-
ety of subdisciplines within the field of hydrology. As
early as 1962, electronic circuit models were seen as
an innovative approach to analyzing groundwater flows
(Robinove 1962). In these early studies, physical cir-
cuit models, often involving the careful placement and
soldering of thousands of resistors for each individual
run, were constructed in the laboratory to simulate the
groundwater system (Miley & Kuelske 1990). With in-
creased computer processing power, this approach was
supplanted by more contemporary node-based numerical
models that are in wide use today (Fetter 2001). The
use of such models has significantly advanced scientists’
understanding of flow connectivity within aquifers as
well as between ground and surface waters (Singh 2014).
Application of resistance-based groundwater models has
provided insights into questions that are highly relevant
to the field of conservation science, including under-
standing water budgets in the midst of rapid human
development (Tillman et al. 2016), the effects of flow
management (Shafroth et al. 2010), groundwater pump-
ing (Falke et al. 2011) on dryland stream habitats and
riparian ecosystems, and the impacts of climate change
on stream summer base flows (Huntington & Niswonger
2012).
Ecosystem Services
In the context of ecosystem services, circuit theory has
been used to examine the landscape genetic structure
and movements of pollinators, especially bees, in re-
sponse to habitat and land-use changes (e.g., Goulson
et al. 2011; Lander et al. 2013; Lozier et al. 2013; Jaffe
et al. 2016a, 2016b). In southeastern Australia, Luck
et al. (2014) used Circuitscape to investigate the poten-
tial movements of Regent Parrots (Polytelis anthopeplus)
through almond orchards, which may benefit from par-
rots foraging on nuts remaining after harvest, reducing
the need for manual or mechanical removal. Koh et al.
(2013) used circuit theory to estimate the potential flow
of agricultural insect predators across habitat networks in
the U.S. Midwest. They quantified the pest-control benefit
of grassland restoration and native prairie remnants and
concluded that the flow of multiple predators on soybean
aphids (Aphis glycines) was improved by the presence of
adjacent, native “conservation plantings” that maximize
such biocontrol services.
Impacts of Circuit Theory and Future Opportunities
Circuit theory’s widespread application across multiple
disciplines (beyond genetics and wildlife ecology) is a tes-
tament to its power and flexibility as a tool for exploring
movement and flow across a range of scales and settings.
For example, novel applications of the theory to under-
standing the spread of fire, water, diseases, and invasive
species, as well as the future impacts of climate change
on natural and human systems, are transforming the way
scientists, planners, managers, and decision makers think
about or incorporate connectivity processes into their
work. From these diverse applications, we anticipate that
new areas of inquiry and tools will emerge that can also
benefit the field of conservation.
We see a variety of opportunities for circuit theory’s
continued development and use in conservation. First, a
new wave of applications is emerging from advances in
how we conceptualize connectivity, such as by recog-
nizing that a range of habitat conditions can serve as a
source for individuals (and genes) moving between pop-
ulations. “Omnidirectional” or “wall-to-wall” approaches
(e.g., Walpole et al. 2012; Koen et al. 2014; Pelletier et al.
2014; Anderson et al. 2016; McRae et al. 2016; Support-
ing Information) avoid the need to arbitrarily define and
delineate discrete areas to connect (e.g., habitat cores or
patches), revealing important areas for connectivity over
continuous landscape gradients. Because circuit theory
extends easily to nontraditional landscapes, efforts to
quantify connectivity in other dynamic systems, such as
seascapes, riverscapes, and belowground environments
(e.g., caves or karst), are expanding. Circuit theory can
also be used to identify key places for mitigating or
restoring connectivity (e.g., McRae et al. 2012; Torrubia
et al. 2014) in areas where new investments in transporta-
tion infrastructure might prioritize crossing structures for
wildlife. Second, tighter coupling between near real-time
data on landscape dynamics (e.g., derived using remotely
sensed images within Google’s Earth Engine environ-
ment) and estimates of landscape resistance and current
flow, as well as increasingly available information (e.g.,
Global Positioning System or other telemetry data) spe-
cific to the movement behaviors or seasonal life-history
traits of a target organism, will greatly improve insights
into or tests of potential connectivity. Third, we expect
that outputs from Circuitscape will be used more fre-
quently as hypotheses to strategically inform the design
and monitoring of habitat-use studies and to strengthen
statistical inferences drawn from field data.

Circuit Theory
Although circuit theory provides a robust and intuitive
framework for analyses of gene flow, animal movement,
and corridor use, IBR may not perform as well as some
other frameworks (e.g., isolation by distance) in less frag-
mented landscapes (Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. 2015) or when
connectivity is being assessed for migration pathways as
opposed to dispersal pathways (e.g., Poor et al. 2012;
McClure et al. 2016). As with any modeling framework,
the assumptions and utility of a circuit-theoretic approach
should always be assessed on a project-by-project ba-
sis. Several assumptions and caveats still need to be ad-
dressed, such as modeling long-distance dispersal events
(McRae 2006) and asymmetric migration (McRae et al.
2008; but see Hanks 2017). Future applications of circuit
theory could account for temporal variation in disper-
sal rates (Anderson et al. 2010; Cushman & Lewis 2010)
and predicting patterns of variation at adaptive loci (e.g.,
Creech et al. 2017).
Since the initial applications of circuit theory in conser-
vation, Circuitscape and other related applications have
undergone rapid and near constant refinement and im-
provement. Increasingly, circuit theory-based analyses
are being conducted on larger and more complex data
sets through recent advances in open-source software
(e.g., gflow [Leonard et al. 2017b]), programing (e.g.,
the Julia numerical computing language [Bezanson et al.
2017]), and cluster- or cloud-based computing resources.
The Julia implementation of Circuitscape (version 5.0)
has greatly improved performance and scalability. Users
are now able to solve for landscape grids that are larger or
derived at finer resolutions than those used in earlier ver-
sions, as well as pairwise resistance calculations between
a higher number of focal points (see also, Supporting
Information).
Similarly, advances in data visualization tools have as-
sisted the communication of circuit theory results to a
broader set of conservation practitioners, stakeholders,
and planning efforts. A leading example is Migrations
in
Motion
(http://maps.tnc.org/migrations-in-motion),
which uses a dynamic illustration of projected species
migrations under climate change (Lawler et al. 2013) and
has been a powerful and accessible way for The Nature
Conservancy (TNC) to communicate the potential risks
of climate change to a variety of audiences, including
the general public. These advances are often occurring
as scientists around the world apply circuit theory to
inform applications and decision makers. In his work
at TNC, McRae played a major role in the development
of generalized connectivity maps produced with wall-to-
wall (Anderson et al. 2016) and Omniscape (McRae et al.
2016; Supporting Information) versions of Circuitscape
models. These regional-scale flow maps remain a key
component in TNC’s Conserving Nature’s Stage approach
for identifying land protection priorities, which to date
has helped guide decisions on US$38 million in land pro-
tection funding. In India, national policy associated with
the Wildlife Protection Act, which delineates key habitat
areas as tiger reserves, has been informed by Circuitscape-
derived models and maps (Qureshi et al. 2014; Dutta et al.
2016).
We believe the impact of circuit theory and Cir-
cuitscape on conservation has come from not only the
theoretical basis and elegance of the approach, but also
from the powerful collaborations and active user commu-
nity that have emerged. Because circuit theory took root
so quickly and broadly, it can be expected to continue
to provide a springboard for ecological understanding
and remain an important tool for future researchers and
conservation practitioners around the globe.
