“When you read the Quran, seek refuge with 
Allah from Satan the outcast. He has no authority 
over those who believe and trust in their Lord. His 
authority is only over those who follow him, and 
those who associate others with Him.” [The Bee 
98-100]

them.

6  As for those who disbelieve—it is 
the same for them, whether you 
have warned them, or have not 
warned them—they do not believe.

7  Allah has set a seal on their hearts 
and on their hearing, and over their 
vision is a veil. They will have a 
severe torment.

8  Among the people are those who 
say, “We believe in Allah and in the 
Last Day,” but they are not believers. 
   ٩
ﻳُﺨَٰﺪِﻋُﻮنَ 
ٱﻟﻠﱠﻪَ

9  They seek to deceive Allah and 
those who believe, but they deceive 
none but themselves, though they 
are not aware. 
   ٠١
ﻓِﻰ ﻗُﻠُﻮﺑِﻬِﻢ ﻣﱠﺮَضٌ ﻓَﺰَادَﻫُﻢُ

10  In their hearts is sickness, and 
Allah has increased their sickness. 
They will have a painful punishment 
because of their denial. 
   ١١
وَ إِذَا ﻗِﻴﻞَ ﻟَﻬُﻢْ ﻻَ ﺗُﻔْﺴِﺪُوا۟ ﻓِﻰ 
ٱﻷْ َرْضِ 
 
ﻗَﺎﻟُﻮٓ ا۟ 
إِﻧﱠﻤَﺎ ﻧَ

11  And when it is said to them, “Do 
not make trouble on earth,” they say, 
“We are only reformers.” 
   ٢١
أَﻻَ ٓ إِﻧﱠﻬُﻢْ ﻫُﻢُ 
ٱﻟْﻤُﻔْﺴِﺪُونَ 
 
وَﻟَٰﻜِﻦ ﻻﱠ ﻳَﺸْﻌُﺮُونَ 
 12  In fact, they are the 
troublemakers, but they are not 
aware. 
   ٣١
وَ إِذَا ﻗِﻴﻞَ ﻟَﻬُﻢْ ءَ اﻣِﻨُﻮا۟ ﻛَﻤَﺎٓ ءَ اﻣَﻦَ

ٱﻟﺴﱡﻔَﻬَﺎٓءُ 
 
وَﻟَٰﻜِﻦ ﻻﱠ ﻳَﻌْﻠَﻤُﻮنَ 
 
13  And when it is said to them, 
“Believe as the people have 
believed,” they say, “Shall we 
believe as the fools have believed?” 
In fact, it is they who are the fools, 
but they do not know. 
   ٤١
وَ إِذَا ﻟَﻘُﻮا۟

14  And when they come across those 
who believe, they say, “We believe”; 
but when they are alone with their 
devils, they say, “We are with you; 
we were only ridiculing.” 
   ٥١
ٱﻟﻠﱠﻪُ 
 
ﻳَﺴْﺘَﻬْﺰِئُ ﺑِﻬِﻢْ وَﻳَﻤُﺪﱡﻫُﻢْ ﻓِﻰ ﻃُﻐْﻴَٰﻨِﻬِﻢْ 
ﻳَﻌْﻤَ 
ﻬُﻮنَ 
 
15  It is Allah who ridicules them, and 
leaves them bewildered in their 
transgression.

16  Those are they who have bartered 
error for guidance; but their trade 
does not profit them, and they are 
not guided. 
   ٧١
ﻣَﺜَﻠُﻬُﻢْ ﻛَﻤَﺜَﻞِ

17  Their likeness is that of a person 
who kindled a fire; when it 
illuminated all around him, Allah took 
away their light, and left them in 
darkness, unable to see.  
   ٨١
ﺻُﻢﱞۢ ﺑُﻜْﻢٌ ﻋُﻤْﻰٌ ﻓَﻬُﻢْ ﻻَ ﻳَﺮْﺟِﻌُﻮنَ 
 18  Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not 
return. 
   ٩١
أَوْ ﻛَﺼَﻴﱢﺐٍ ﻣﱢﻦَ

ﭑﻟْﻜَٰﻔِﺮِﻳﻦَ 
 
19  Or like a cloudburst from the sky, 
in which is darkness, and thunder, 
and lightning. They press their 
fingers into their ears from the 
thunderbolts, in fear of death. But 
Allah surrounds the disbelievers. 
   ٠٢
ﻳَﻜَﺎدُ

ٱﻟﻠﱠﻪَ 
 
ﻋَﻠَﻰٰ ﻛُﻞﱢ ﺷَﻰْ ءٍ ﻗَﺪِﻳﺮٌ 
 
20  The lightning almost snatches 
their sight away. Whenever it

but when it grows dark over them, 
they stand still. Had Allah willed, He 
could have taken away their hearing 
and their sight. Allah is capable of 
everything.

who believe, they know that it is the 
Truth from their Lord. But as for

“What did Allah intend by this

heavens and the earth, and that I 
know what you reveal and what you

another. And you will have residence

55  And recall that you said, “O 
Moses, we will not believe in you 
unless we see Allah plainly.”

Thereupon the thunderbolt struck

57  And We shaded you with clouds, 
and We sent down to you manna 
and quails: “Eat of the good things 
We have provided for you.” They did 
not wrong Us, but they used to 
wrong their own souls.

58  And recall that We said, “Enter this 
town, and eat plentifully from it 
whatever you wish; but enter the 
gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' We 
will forgive your sins, and give 
increase to the virtuous.”

59  But the wrongdoers among them 
substituted words other than those 
given to them, so We sent down on 
the wrongdoers a plague from 
heaven, because of their wicked 
behavior.

60  And recall when Moses prayed for 
water for his people. We said, “Strike 
the rock with your staff.” Thereupon 
twelve springs gushed out from it, 
and each tribe recognized its 
drinking-place. “Eat and drink from 
Allah’s provision, and do not corrupt 
the earth with disobedience.”

61  And recall when you said, “O 
Moses, we cannot endure one kind 
of food, so call to your Lord to 
produce for us of what the earth 
grows: of its herbs, and its 
cucumbers, and its garlic, and its 
lentils, and its onions.” He said, 
“Would you substitute worse for 
better? Go down to Egypt, where 
you will have what you asked for.” 
They were struck with humiliation

63  And recall when We received a 
pledge from you, and raised the 
Mount above you: “Take what We 
have given you earnestly, and 
remember what is in it, that you may 
attain righteousness.”

64  But after that you turned away. 
Were it not for Allah’s grace and 
mercy towards you, you would have 
been among the losers.

65  And you surely knew those of you 
who violated the Sabbath. We said 
to them, “Be despicable apes!” 
   ٦٦
ﻓَﺠَﻌَﻠْﻨَٰﻬَﺎ ﻧَﻜَٰﻼً ﻟﱢﻤَﺎ ﺑَﻴْﻦَ ﻳَﺪَﻳْﻬَﺎ وَﻣَﺎ ﺧَﻠْﻔَﻬَﺎ

66  Thus We made it a deterrent for 
their generation, and for subsequent 
generations, and a lesson for the 
righteous.

67  And recall when Moses said to his 
people, “Allah commands you to 
sacrifice a heifer.” They said, “Do 
you make a mockery of us?” He 
said, “Allah forbid that I should be so 
ignorant.”

says she is a heifer, neither too old, 
nor too young, but in between. So do 
what you are commanded.”

71  He said, “He says she is a heifer, 
neither yoked to plow the earth, nor 
to irrigate the field; sound without 
blemish.” They said, “Now you have 
brought the truth.” So they slew her; 
though they almost did not.

72  And recall when you killed a 
person, and disputed in the matter; 
but Allah was to expose what you 
were hiding.

73  We said, “Strike him with part of 
it.” Thus Allah brings the dead to life; 
and He shows you His signs, that 
you may understand.

74  Then after that your hearts 
hardened. They were as rocks, or 
even harder. For there are some 
rocks from which rivers gush out, 
and others that splinter and water 
comes out from them, and others 
that sink in awe of Allah. Allah is not 
unaware of what you do.

75  Do you hope that they will believe 
in you, when some of them used to 
hear the Word of Allah, and then 
deliberately distort it, even after 
understanding it?

79  So woe to those who write the 
Scripture with their own hands, and 
then say, “This is from Allah,” that 
they may exchange it for a little 
price. Woe to them for what their 
hands have written, and woe to them

85  But here you are, killing your own, 
and expelling a group of your own 
from their homes—conspiring 
against them in wrongdoing and 
hostility. And if they come to you as 
captives, you ransom them, although 
it was forbidden to you. Is it that you 
believe in part of the Scripture, and 
disbelieve in part? What is the 
reward for those among you who do 
that but humiliation in this life? And 
on the Day of Resurrection, they will 
be assigned to the most severe 
torment. Allah is not unaware of 
what you do.

87  We gave Moses the Scripture, and 
sent a succession of messengers 
after him. And We gave Jesus son of 
Mary the clear proofs, and We 
supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is 
it that whenever a messenger comes 
to you with anything your souls do 
not desire, you grew arrogant, 
calling some impostors, and killing 
others?

they disbelieved in it. So Allah’s

90  Miserable is what they sold their 
souls for—rejecting what Allah has 
revealed, out of resentment that 
Allah would send down His grace 
upon whomever He chooses from 
among His servants. Thus they 
incurred wrath upon wrath. And 
there is a demeaning punishment for 
the disbelievers.

91  And when it is said to them, 
“Believe in what Allah has revealed,” 
they say, “We believe in what was 
revealed to us,” and they reject 
anything beyond that, although it is 
the truth which confirms what they 
have. Say, “Why did you kill Allah’s 
prophets before, if you were 
believers?”

93  And We made a covenant with 
you, and raised the Mount above 
you: “Take what We have given you 
firmly, and listen.” They said, “We 
hear and disobey.” And their hearts 
became filled with the love of the calf 
because of their disbelief. Say, 
“Wretched is what your faith 
commands you to do, if you are 
believers.”

community, that you may be 
witnesses to humanity, and that the 
Messenger may be a witness to you. 
We only established the direction of 
prayer, which you once followed, 
that We may distinguish those who 
follow the Messenger from those 
who turn on their heels. It is indeed 
difficult, except for those whom Allah 
has guided. But Allah would never 
let your faith go to waste. Allah is 
Kind towards the people, Merciful.

170  And when it is said to them, 
“Follow what Allah has revealed,” 
they say, “We will follow what we

174  Those who conceal what Allah 
revealed in the Book, and exchange 
it for a small price—those swallow 
nothing but fire into their bellies. And 
Allah will not speak to them on the 
Day of Resurrection, nor will He 
purify them, and they will have a

177  Righteousness does not consist 
of turning your faces towards the 
East and the West. But righteous is 
he who believes in Allah, and the 
Last Day, and the angels, and the 
Scripture, and the prophets. Who 
gives money, though dear, to near 
relatives, and orphans, and the 
needy, and the homeless, and the 
beggars, and for the freeing of 
slaves; those who perform the 
prayers, and pay the obligatory 
charity, and fulfill their promise when 
they promise, and patiently 
persevere in the face of persecution, 
hardship, and in the time of conflict. 
These are the sincere; these are the 
pious.

the murdered is ordained upon you: 
the free for the free, the slave for the 
slave, the female for the female. But 
if he is forgiven by his kin, then grant

Whoever of you witnesses the 
month, shall fast it. But whoever is 
sick, or on a journey, then a number

distinguished from the black streak. 
Then complete the fast until nightfall. 
But do not approach them while you 
are in retreat at the mosques. These 
are the limits of Allah, so do not 
come near them. Allah thus clarifies 
His revelations to the people, that 
they may attain piety.

191  And kill them wherever you 
overtake them, and expel them from 
where they had expelled you. 
Oppression is more serious than 
murder. But do not fight them at the 
Sacred Mosque, unless they fight 
you there. If they fight you, then kill 
them. Such is the retribution of the 
disbelievers.

213  Humanity used to be one 
community; then Allah sent the 
prophets, bringing good news and 
giving warnings. And He sent down 
with them the Scripture, with the 
truth, to judge between people 
regarding their differences. But none 
differed over it except those who 
were given it—after the proofs had 
come to them—out of mutual envy 
between them. Then Allah guided 
those who believed to the truth they 
had disputed, in accordance with His 
will. Allah guides whom He wills to a 
straight path.

217  They ask you about fighting 
during the Holy Month. Say, 
“Fighting during it is deplorable; but 
to bar others from Allah’s path, and 
to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent 
access to the Holy Mosque, and to 
expel its people from it, are more 
deplorable with Allah. And 
persecution is more serious than 
killing. They will not cease to fight 
you until they turn you back from 
your religion, if they can. Whoever 
among you turns back from his 
religion, and dies a disbeliever—
those are they whose works will 
come to nothing, in this life, and in 
the Hereafter. Those are the inmates 
of the Fire, abiding in it forever.

either honorable retention, or setting

period. It is the duty of the father to 
provide for them and clothe them in 
a proper manner. No soul shall be 
burdened beyond its capacity. No 
mother shall be harmed on account 
of her child, and no father shall be 
harmed on account of his child. The 
same duty rests upon the heir. If the 
couple desire weaning, by mutual 
consent and consultation, they 
commit no error by doing so. You 
commit no error by hiring nursing-
mothers, as long as you pay them 
fairly. And be wary of Allah, and 
know that Allah is Seeing of what 
you do.

had set the dowry for them, give 
them half of what you specified—
unless they forego the right, or the

fighting was ordained for you, you 
would not fight?” They said, “Why 
would we not fight in the cause of 
Allah, when we were driven out of 
our homes, along with our children?” 
But when fighting was ordained for 
them, they turned away, except for a 
few of them. But Allah is aware of 
the wrongdoers.

scoops up a little with his hand.” But 
they drank from it, except for a few

he and those who believed with him, 
they said, “We have no strength to 
face Goliath and his troops today.”

argued with Abraham about his

sovereignty? Abraham said, “My 
Lord is He who gives life and causes 
death.” He said, “I give life and 
cause death.” Abraham said, “Allah 
brings the sun from the East, so 
bring it from the West,” so the 
blasphemer was confounded. Allah 
does not guide the wrongdoing

275  Those who swallow usury will not 
rise, except as someone driven mad 
by Satan's touch. That is because 
they say, “Commerce is like usury.” 
But Allah has permitted commerce, 
and has forbidden usury. Whoever, 
on receiving advice from his Lord, 
refrains, may keep his past earnings, 
and his case rests with Allah. But 
whoever resumes—these are the

with honesty. And call to witness two

think it too trivial to write down, 
whether small or large, including the 
time of repayment. That is more 
equitable with Allah, and stronger as 
evidence, and more likely to prevent 
doubt—except in the case of a spot 
transaction between you—then there 
is no blame on you if you do not 
write it down. And let there be 
witnesses whenever you conclude a

14  Adorned for the people is the love 
of desires, such as women, and 
children, and piles upon piles of gold 
and silver, and branded horses, and 
livestock, and fields. These are the 
conveniences of the worldly life, but 
with Allah lies the finest resort.

15  Say, “Shall I inform you of 
something better than that? For 
those who are righteous, with their 
Lord are Gardens beneath which 
rivers flow, where they will remain 
forever, and purified spouses, and 
acceptance from Allah.” Allah is 
Observant of the servants.

no god but He, as do the angels, 
and those endowed with 
knowledge—upholding justice. 
There is no god but He, the Mighty, 
the Wise.

19  Religion with Allah is Islam. Those 
to whom the Scripture was given 
differed only after knowledge came 
to them, out of envy among 
themselves. Whoever rejects the 
signs of Allah—Allah is quick to take 
account.

20  If they argue with you, say, “I have 
surrendered myself to Allah, and 
those who follow me.” And say to 
those who were given the Scripture, 
and to the unlearned, “Have you 
surrendered?” If they have 
surrendered, then they are guided; 
but if they turn away, then your duty 
is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the 
servants.

23  Have you not considered those 
who were given a share of the 
Scripture, as they were called to the 
Scripture of Allah to arbitrate 
between them; then some of them 
turned back, and declined?

24  That is because they said, “The

limited number of days.” They have 
been misled in their religion by the 
lies they fabricated.

37  Her Lord accepted her with a 
gracious reception, and brought her 
a beautiful upbringing, and entrusted 
her to the care of Zechariah. 
Whenever Zechariah entered upon 
her in the sanctuary, he found her 
with provision. He said, “O Mary, 
where did you get this from?” She 
said, “It is from Allah; Allah provides 
to whom He wills without reckoning.”

77  Those who exchange the 
covenant of Allah, and their vows, 
for a small price, will have no share 
in the Hereafter, and Allah will not 
speak to them, nor will He look at 
them on the Day of Resurrection, 
nor will He purify them. They will 
have a painful punishment.

twist the Scripture with their tongues, 
that you may think it from the 
Scripture, when it is not from the 
Scripture. And they say, “It is from 
Allah,” when it is not from Allah. 
They tell lies and attribute them to 
Allah, knowingly.

81  Allah received the covenant of the 
prophets, “Inasmuch as I have given 
you of scripture and wisdom; should 
a messenger come to you verifying 
what you have, you shall believe in 
him, and support him.” He said, “Do 
you affirm My covenant and take it

110  You are the best community that 
ever emerged for humanity: you 
advocate what is moral, and forbid 
what is immoral, and believe in 
Allah. Had the People of the 
Scripture believed, it would have 
been better for them. Among them 
are the believers, but most of them 
are sinners.

they will turn around and flee, then 
they will not be helped.

112  They shall be humiliated 
wherever they are encountered, 
except through a rope from Allah, 
and a rope from the people; and 
they incurred wrath from Allah, and 
were stricken with misery. That is 
because they rejected Allah’s 
revelations, and killed the prophets 
unjustly. That is because they 
rebelled and committed aggression.

117  The parable of what they spend in

wrong them, but they wronged their

146  How many a prophet fought 
alongside him numerous godly 
people? They did not waver for what 
afflicted them in the cause of Allah, 
nor did they weaken, nor did they 
give in. Allah loves those who 
endure.

Miserable is the lodging of the 
evildoers.

152  Allah has fulfilled His promise to 
you, and you defeated them by His 
leave; until when you faltered, and 
disputed the command, and 
disobeyed after He had shown you 
what you like. Some of you want this 
world, and some of you want the 
next. Then He turned you away from 
them, to test you; but He pardoned 
you. Allah is Gracious towards the 
believers.

153  Remember when you fled, not 
caring for anyone, even though the 
Messenger was calling you from 
your rear. Then He repaid you with 
sorrow upon sorrow, so that you 
would not grieve over what you 
missed, or for what afflicted you. 
Allah is Informed of what you do.

154  Then after the setback, He sent 
down security upon you. Slumber 
overcame some of you, while others 
cared only for themselves, thinking 
of Allah thoughts that were untrue—
thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is 
anything up to us?” Say, “Everything 
is up to Allah.” They conceal within 
themselves what they do not reveal 
to you. And they say, “If it was up to 
us, none of us would have been 
killed here.” Say, “Even if you Had 
stayed in your homes, those 
destined to be killed would have 
marched into their death beds.” Allah 
thus tests what is in your minds, and 
purifies what is in your hearts. Allah 
knows what the hearts contain.

156  O you who believe! Do not be like 
those who disbelieved, and said of 
their brethren who marched in the 
land, or went on the offensive, “Had 
they stayed with us, they would not 
have died or been killed.” So that 
Allah may make it a cause of regret 
in their hearts. Allah gives life and 
causes death. Allah is Seeing of 
what you do.

159  It is by of grace from Allah that 
you were gentle with them. Had you 
been harsh, hardhearted, they would 
have dispersed from around you. So 
pardon them, and ask forgiveness 
for them, and consult them in the 
conduct of affairs. And when you 
make a decision, put your trust in 
Allah; Allah loves the trusting.

every soul will be paid in full for what 
it has earned, and they will not be

164  Allah has blessed the believers,

who recites to them His revelations,

the Scripture and wisdom; although 
before that they were in evident

“Come, fight in the cause of Allah, or

only increased them in faith, and 
they said, “Allah is enough for us; He 
is the Excellent Protector.”

as you are, without distinguishing 
the wicked from the sincere. Nor will 
Allah inform you of the future, but 
Allah elects from among His

187  Allah received a pledge from

to be mature enough, hand over 
their properties to them. And do not 
consume it extravagantly or hastily

not charge any wage, but the poor 
may charge fairly. When you hand 
over their properties to them, have it 
witnessed for them. Allah suffices as

he leaves. If there is only one, she 
gets one-half. As for the parents, 
each gets one-sixth of what he 
leaves, if he had children. If he had 
no children, and his parents inherit 
from him, his mother gets one-third. 
If he has siblings, his mother gets 
one-sixth. After fulfilling any bequest

Permitted for you are those that lie

marry one of the believing maids 
under your control. Allah is well 
aware of your faith. You are from 
one another. Marry them with the 
permission of their guardians, and 
give them their recompense fairly—
to be protected—neither committing 
adultery, nor taking secret lovers. 
When they are married, if they 
commit adultery, their punishment 
shall be half that of free women. 
That is for those among you who 
fear falling into decadence. But to 
practice self-restraint is better for 
you. Allah is Most Forgiving, Most

your attention,” it would have been 
better for them, and more upright. 
But Allah has cursed them for their 
disbelief; they do not believe except 
a little.

fighting was ordained for them, a 
faction of them feared the people as 
Allah is ought to be feared, or even 
more. And they said, “Our Lord, why 
did You ordain fighting for us? If only 
You would postpone it for us for a 
short while.” Say, “The enjoyments 
of this life are brief, but the Hereafter 
is better for the righteous, and you 
will not be wronged one bit.”

78  Wherever you may be, death will

in fortified towers. When a good 
fortune comes their way, they say, 
“This is from Allah.” But when a 
misfortune befalls them, they say, 
“This is from you.” Say, “All is from 
Allah.” So what is the matter with 
these people, that they hardly 
understand a thing?

102  When you are among them, and 
you stand to lead them in prayer, let 
a group of them stand with you, and 
let them hold their weapons. Then, 
when they have done their 
prostrations, let them withdraw to the

have not prayed yet, come forward 
and pray with you; and let them take 
their precautions and their weapons. 
Those who disbelieve would like you 
to neglect your weapons and your 
equipment, so they can attack you in 
a single assault. You commit no 
error, if you are hampered by rain or 
are sick, by putting down your 
weapons; but take precautions. 
Indeed, Allah has prepared for the

171  O People of the Scripture! Do not 
exaggerate in your religion, and do 
not say about Allah except the truth. 
The Messiah, Jesus, the son of 
Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and 
His Word that He conveyed to Mary, 
and a Spirit from Him. So believe in 
Allah and His messengers, and do 
not say, “Three.” Refrain—it is better 
for you. Allah is only one God. Glory 
be to Him—that He should have a 
son. To Him belongs everything in 
the heavens and the earth, and Allah 
is a sufficient Protector.

“Allah gives you a ruling concerning 
the person who has neither parents 
nor children.” If a man dies, and 
leaves no children, and he had a 
sister, she receives one-half of what 
he leaves. And he inherits from her if 
she leaves no children. But if there 
are two sisters, they receive two-
thirds of what he leaves. If the 
siblings are men and women, the 
male receives the share of two 
females.” Allah makes things clear 
for you, lest you err. Allah is Aware 
of everything.

they catch for you, and pronounce 
Allah’s name over it. And fear Allah. 
Allah is Swift in reckoning.

5  Today all good things are made 
lawful for you. And the food of those 
given the Scripture is lawful for you, 
and your food is lawful for them. So 
are chaste believing women, and 
chaste women from the people who 
were given the Scripture before you, 
provided you give them their 
dowries, and take them in marriage, 
not in adultery, nor as mistresses. 
But whoever rejects faith, his work 
will be in vain, and in the Hereafter 
he will be among the losers.

6  O you who believe! When you rise 
to pray, wash your faces and your 
hands and arms to the elbows, and 
wipe your heads, and your feet to 
the ankles. If you had intercourse, 
then purify yourselves. If you are ill, 
or travelling, or one of you returns 
from the toilet, or you had contact 
with women, and could not find 
water, then use some clean sand 
and wipe your faces and hands with 
it. Allah does not intend to burden 
you, but He intends to purify you, 
and to complete His blessing upon 
you, that you may be thankful.

He covenanted with you; when you 
said, “We hear and we obey.” And

12  Allah received a pledge from the 
Children of Israel, and We raised 
among them twelve chiefs. Allah 
said, “I am with you; if you perform 
the prayer, and pay the alms, and 
believe in My messengers and 
support them, and lend Allah a loan 
of righteousness; I will remit your 
sins, and admit you into Gardens 
beneath which rivers flow. But 
whoever among you disbelieves 
afterwards has strayed from the right 
way.”

13  Because of their breaking their 
pledge, We cursed them, and made 
their hearts hard. They twist the 
words out of their context, and they 
disregarded some of what they were 
reminded of. You will always witness 
deceit from them, except for a few of 
them. But pardon them, and 
overlook. Allah loves the doers of 
good.

Say, “Who can prevent Allah, if He

belongs the sovereignty of the 
heavens and the earth and what is 
between them. He creates whatever 
He wills, and Allah has power over

27  And relate to them the true story of 
Adam's two sons: when they offered 
an offering, and it was accepted 
from one of them, but it was not 
accepted from the other. He Said, “I 
will kill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts 
only from the righteous.”

29  “I would rather you bear my sin 
and your sin, and you become 
among the inmates of the Fire. Such 
is the reward for the evildoers.”

30  Then His soul prompted him to kill 
his brother, so he killed him, and 
became one of the losers.

31  Then Allah sent a raven digging 
the ground, to show him how to 
cover his brother's corpse. He said, 
“Woe to me! I was unable to be like 
this raven, and bury my brother's 
corpse.” So he became full of 
regrets.

32  Because of that We ordained for 
the Children of Israel: that whoever 
kills a person—unless it is for 
murder or corruption on earth—it is 
as if he killed the whole of mankind; 
and whoever saves it, it is as if he 
saved the whole of mankind. Our 
messengers came to them with 
clarifications, but even after that, 
many of them continue to commit 
excesses in the land.

33  The punishment for those who 
fight Allah and His Messenger, and 
strive to spread corruption on earth, 
is that they be killed, or crucified, or 
have their hands and feet cut off on

36   As for those who disbelieve, even 
if they owned everything on earth, 
and the like of it with it, and they 
offered it to ransom themselves from 
the torment of the Day of 
Resurrection, it will not be accepted 
from them. For them is a painful

with their mouths, “We believe,” but 
their hearts do not believe; and from 
among the Jews—listeners to lies, 
listeners to other people who did not 
come to you. They distort words 
from their places, and they say, “If 
you are given this, accept it; but if 
you are not given it, beware.” 
Whomever Allah has willed to divert, 
you have nothing for him from Allah. 
Those are they whose hearts Allah 
does not intend to purify. For them is 
disgrace in this world, and for them 
is a great punishment in the 
Hereafter.

illicit earnings. If they come to you, 
judge between them, or turn away

between them equitably. Allah loves 
the equitable.

44  We have revealed the Torah, 
wherein is guidance and light. The 
submissive prophets ruled the Jews 
according to it, so did the rabbis and 
the scholars, as they were required 
to protect Allah’s Book, and were 
witnesses to it. So do not fear 
people, but fear Me. And do not sell 
My revelations for a cheap price. 
Those who do not rule according to 
what Allah revealed are the 
unbelievers.

So judge between them according to

They strive in the way of Allah, and 
do not fear the blame of the critic. 
That is the grace of Allah; He

Allah is Embracing and Knowing.

them in defiance and blasphemy.

75  The Messiah son of Mary was only 
a messenger, before whom other 
Messengers had passed away, and 
his mother was a woman of truth. 
They both used to eat food. Note

82  You will find that the people most 
hostile towards the believers are the 
Jews and the polytheists. And you 
will find that the nearest in affection

because among them are priests

89  Allah does not hold you 
accountable for your unintended 
oaths, but He holds you accountable 
for your binding oaths. The 
atonement for it is by feeding ten 
needy people from the average of 
what you feed your families, or by 
clothing them, or by freeing a slave. 
Anyone who lacks the means shall 
fast for three days. That is the 
atonement for breaking your oaths 
when you have sworn them. So 
keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes 
clear His Revelations to you, that 
you may be grateful.

Wasilah, or of Hami; but those who 
disbelieve fabricate lies about

not conceal Allah’s testimony, for 
then we would be sinners.”

Allah took away your hearing and

52  And do not drive away those who 
call upon their Lord, morning and

80  And his people argued with him. 
He said, “Do you argue with me

brought—a light and guidance for 
humanity?” You put it on scrolls, 
displaying them, yet concealing 
much. And you were taught what 
you did not know—neither you, nor 
your ancestors. Say, “Allah;” then 
leave them toying away in their 
speculation.

108  Do not insult those they call upon 
besides Allah, lest they insult Allah 
out of hostility and ignorance. We

their deeds. Then to their Lord is

most solemn oaths, that if a miracle

164  Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other

things?” No soul gets except what it 
is due, and no soul bears the 
burdens of another. Then to your 
Lord is your return, then He will 
inform you regarding your disputes.

20  But Satan whispered to them, to 
reveal to them their nakedness, 
which was invisible to them. He said, 
“Your Lord has only forbidden you 
this tree, lest you become angels, or 
become immortals.”

22  So he lured them with deceit. And 
when they tasted the tree, their 
nakedness became evident to them, 
and they began covering themselves 
with the leaves of the Garden. And 
their Lord called out to them, “Did I 
not forbid you from this tree, and say

96  Had the people of the towns

101  These towns—We narrate to you 
some of their tales. Their

141  Remember how We saved you 
from Pharaoh’s people, who 
subjected you to the worst of 
sufferings—killing your sons and 
sparing your women. In that was a 
tremendous trial from your Lord.

142  And We appointed to Moses thirty 
nights, and completed them with ten; 
and thus the time appointed by his 
Lord was forty nights. And Moses 
said to his brother Aaron: “Take my 
place among my people, and be 
upright, and do not follow the way of 
the mischief-makers.”

143  And when Moses came to Our 
appointment, and his Lord spoke to 
him, he said, “My Lord, allow me to 
look and see You.” He said, “You will 
not see Me, but look at the 
mountain; if it stays in its place, you 
will see Me.” But when his Lord 
manifested Himself to the mountain, 
He turned it into dust, and Moses fell 
down unconscious. Then, when he 
recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, 
I repent to you, and I am the first of 
the believers.”

Even if they see every sign, they will

148  In his absence, the people of 
Moses adopted a calf made from 
their ornaments—a body which 
lowed. Did they not see that it could 
not speak to them, nor guide them in 
any way? They took it for worship. 
They were in the wrong.

150  And when Moses returned to his 
people, angry and disappointed, he 
said, “What an awful thing you did in 
my absence. Did you forsake the 
commandments of your Lord so 
hastily?” And he threw down the 
tablets; and he took hold of his 
brother’s head, dragging him 
towards himself. He said, “Son of my 
mother, the people have 
overpowered me, and were about to

160  We divided them into twelve tribal 
communities. And We inspired 
Moses, when his people asked him 
for something to drink: “Strike the 
rock with your staff.” Whereupon 
twelve springs gushed from it. Each 
group recognized its drinking-place. 
And We shaded them with clouds,

manna and quails: “Eat of the good 
things We have provided for you.” 
They did not wrong Us, but they

164  And when a group of them said, 
“Why do you counsel a people 
whom Allah will annihilate, or punish 
with a severe punishment?” They 
said, “As an excuse to your Lord, 
and so that they may become 
righteous.”

seized those who did wrong with a 
terrible punishment, because of their

your sins, and will forgive you. Allah

against you, to imprison you, or kill 
you, or expel you. They planned, 
and Allah planned, but Allah is the 
Best of planners.

nothing but myths of the ancients.”

on us stones from the sky, or visit us 
with a painful affliction.”

33  But Allah would not punish them 
while you are amongst them. And 
Allah would not punish them as long 
as they seek forgiveness.

34  Yet why should Allah not punish 
them, when they are turning others 
away from the Sacred Mosque, 
although they are not its custodians? 
Its rightful custodians are the pious; 
but most of them do not know.

They will spend it, then it will

Those who disbelieve will be herded

cavalry you can mobilize, to terrify 
thereby Allah’s enemies and your 
enemies, and others besides them 
whom you do not know, but Allah

Allah’s way will be repaid to you in

regular charity, and fear none but 
Allah. These are most likely to be

40  If you do not help him, Allah has 
already helped him, when those who 
disbelieved expelled him, and he 
was the second of two in the cave. 
He said to his friend, “Do not worry, 
Allah is with us.” And Allah made His 
tranquility descend upon him, and 
supported him with forces you did 
not see, and made the word of those 
who disbelieved the lowest, while 
the Word of Allah is the Highest. 
Allah is Mighty and Wise.

74  They swear by Allah that they said 
nothing; but they did utter the word 
of blasphemy, and they renounced 
faith after their submission. And they 
plotted what they could not attain. 
They were resentful only because 
Allah and His Messenger have 
enriched them out of His grace. If 
they repent, it would be best for 
them; but if they turn away, Allah will 
afflict them with a painful 
punishment—in this life and in the 
Hereafter—and they will have on 
earth no protector and no savior.

establish a mosque to cause harm,

Allah bears witness that they are

So rejoice in making such an

124  Whenever a chapter is revealed, 
some of them say, “Which of you 
has this increased in faith?” As for 
those who believe: it increases them 
in faith, and they rejoice.

is sickness: it adds disgrace to their 
disgrace, and they die as 
unbelievers.

126  Do they not see that they are 
tested once or twice every year? Yet 
they do not repent, and they do not 
learn.

revealed, they look at one another, 
“Does anyone see you?” Then they 
slip away. Allah has diverted their 
hearts, because they are a people 
who do not understand.

2  Is it a wonder to the people that We 
inspired a man from among them: 
“Warn mankind, and give good news 
to those who believe that they are on 
a sound footing with their Lord”? The 
disbelievers said, “This is a manifest 
sorcerer.”

3  Your Lord is Allah, who created the 
heavens and the earth in six days, 
then settled over the Throne, 
governing all things. There is no 
intercessor except after His 
permission. Such is Allah, your 
Lord—so serve Him. Will you not

4  To Him is your return, altogether. 
The promise of Allah is true. He 
originates creation, and then He 
repeats it, to reward those who 
believe and do good deeds with 
equity. As for those who disbelieve, 
for them is a drink of boiling water,

11  If Allah were to accelerate the ill 
for the people, as they wish to 
accelerate the good, their term 
would have been fulfilled. But We 
leave those who do not expect Our 
encounter to blunder in their 
excesses.

are recited to them, those who do 
not hope to meet Us say, “Bring a 
Quran other than this, or change it.” 
Say, “It is not for me to change it of

60  What will they think—those who 
fabricate lies and attribute them to 
Allah—on the Day of Resurrection? 
Allah is bountiful towards the people, 
but most of them do not give thanks.

61  You do not get into any situation, 
nor do you recite any Quran, nor do 
you do anything, but We are 
watching over you as you undertake 
it. Not even the weight of an atom, 
on earth or in the sky, escapes your

“O my people, if my presence

Allah’s signs is too much for you, 
then in Allah I have put my trust. So

Our signs. So consider the fate of 
those who were warned.

74  Then, after him, We sent

Thus We set a seal on the hearts of

33  Is He who is watchful over the 
deeds of every soul? Yet they 
ascribe associates to Allah. Say, 
“Name them! Or are you informing 
Him of something on earth He does 
not know, or is it a show of words?” 
In fact, the scheming of those who 
disbelieve is made to appear good to 
them, and they are averted from the 
path. Whomever Allah misguides 
has no guide.

36  Those to whom We gave the 
Scripture rejoice in what was 
revealed to you, while some factions 
reject parts of it. Say, “I am 
commanded to worship Allah, and to 
never associate anything with Him. 
To Him I invite, and to Him is my 
return.”

36  To every community We sent a 
messenger: “Worship Allah, and 
avoid idolatry.” Some of them Allah 
guided, while others deserved 
misguidance. So travel through the 
earth, and see what the fate of the

75  Allah cites the example of a 
bonded slave, who has no power 
over anything; and someone to 
whom We have given plentiful 
provision, from which he gives 
secretly and openly. Are they equal 
in comparison? All praise belongs to 
Allah, but most of them do not know.

76  And Allah cites the example of two 
men: one of them dumb, unable to 
do anything, and is a burden on his 
master; whichever way he directs 
him, he achieves nothing good. Is he 
equal to him who commands justice, 
and is on a straight path?

110  But then your Lord—for those 
who emigrated after being 
persecuted, then struggled and 
persevered—your Lord thereafter is 
Forgiving and Merciful.

done, and they will not be wronged.

112  And Allah cites the example of a 
town that was secure and peaceful, 
with its livelihood coming to it 
abundantly from every direction. But 
then it turned unappreciative of 
Allah’s blessings, so Allah made it 
taste the robe of hunger and fear, 
because of what they used to craft.

Him that you serve.

115  He has forbidden you carrion, and 
blood, and the flesh of swine, and 
anything consecrated to other than 
Allah. But if anyone is compelled by 
necessity, without being deliberate 
or malicious, then Allah is Forgiving 
and Merciful.

116  And do not say of falsehood 
asserted by your tongues, “This is 
lawful, and this is unlawful,” in order 
to invent lies and attribute them to 
Allah. Those who invent lies and 
attribute them to Allah will not 
succeed.

commit evil on earth twice, and you 
will rise to a great height.

5  When the first of the two promises

6  Then We gave you back your turn

7  If you work righteousness, you 
work righteousness for yourselves; 
and if you commit evil, you do so 
against yourselves. Then, when the 
second promise comes true, they 
will make your faces filled with 
sorrow, and enter the Temple as 
they entered it the first time, and 
utterly destroy all that falls into their 
power.

revert. We have made Hell a prison

you may seek bounty from your

No burdened soul carries the

We expedite for him what We decide

encompasses humanity. We did not 
make the vision We showed you, 
except as a test for the people, and 
the tree cursed in the Quran. We 
frighten them, but that only 
increases their defiance.

61  When We said to the angels, “Bow 
down before Adam,” they bowed 
down, except for Satan. He said, 
“Shall I bow down before someone 
You created from mud?”

62  He said, “Do You see this one

64  “And entice whomever of them 
you can with your voice, and rally 
against them your cavalry and your 
infantry, and share with them in 
wealth and children, and make 
promises to them.” But Satan 
promises them nothing but delusion.

17  You would have seen the sun, 
when it rose, veering away from their 
cave towards the right, and when it 
sets, moving away from them to the 
left, as they lay in the midst of the 
cave. That was one of Allah’s 
wonders. He whom Allah guides is 
truly guided; but he whom He 
misguides, for him you will find no

19  Even so, We awakened them, so 
that they may ask one another. A 
speaker among them said, “How 
long have you stayed?” They said, 
“We have stayed a day, or part of a 
day.” They said, “Your Lord knows 
best how long you have stayed.” 
“Send one of you to the city, with this 
money of yours, and let him see 
which food is most suitable, and let 
him bring you some provision 
thereof. And let him be gentle, and 
let no one become aware of you.”

21  So it was, that We caused them to 
be discovered, that they would know 
that the promise of Allah is true, and 
that of the Hour there is no doubt. As 
they were disputing their case 
among themselves, they said, “Build 
over them a building.” Their Lord 
knows best about them. Those who 
prevailed over their case said, “We 
will set up over them a place of 
worship.”

22  They will say, “Three, and their 
fourth being their dog.” And they will 
say, “Five, and their sixth being their 
dog,” guessing at the unknown. And 
they will say, “Seven, and their 
eighth being their dog.” Say, “My 
Lord knows best their number.” 
None knows them except a few. So 
do not argue concerning them 
except with an obvious argument,

 ﺑًﺎﺳَﺮَ 
61  Then, when they reached the 
junction between them, they forgot 
about their fish. It found its way into 
the river, slipping away. 
٢٦
  
ﻓَﻠَﻤﱠﺎ ﺟَﺎوَ زَا ﻗَﺎلَ ﻟِﻔَﺘَﯩٰﻪُ ءَ اﺗِﻨَﺎ ﻏَﺪَآءَﻧَﺎ ﻟَﻘَﺪْ

62  When they went further, he said to 
his servant, “Bring us our lunch; we 
were exposed in our travel to much 
fatigue.” 
٣٦

63  He said, “Do you remember when 
we rested by the rock? I forgot about 
the fish. It was only the devil who 
made me forget it. And so it found its 
way to the river, amazingly.” 
٤٦
  
ﻗَﺎلَ ذَٰﻟِﻚَ ﻣَﺎ ﻛُﻨﱠﺎ ﻧَﺒْ

64  He said, “This is what we were 
seeking.” And so they turned back 
retracing their steps.

65  Then they came upon a servant of 
Ours, whom We had blessed with 
mercy from Us, and had taught him 
knowledge from Our Own. 
   ٦٦
ﻗَﺎلَ ﻟَﻪُ

66  Moses said to him, “May I follow 
you, so that you may teach me some 
of the guidance you were taught?” 
٧٦
  
ﻗَﺎلَ إِﻧﱠﻚَ ﻟَﻦ ﺗَﺴْﺘَﻄِﻴﻊَ ﻣَﻌِﻰَ ﺻَﺒْﺮًا

 68  And how will you endure what you 
have no knowledge of?”

you in any order of yours.”

70  He said, “If you follow me, do not 
ask me about anything, until I myself 
make mention of it to you.”

71  So they set out. Until, when they 
had boarded the boat, he holed it. 
He said, “Did you hole it, to drown its

something awful.”

ﻗَﺎلَ أَ

 72  He said, “Did I not tell you that you

٣٧
  
ﻗَﺎلَ ﻻَ ﺗُﺆَاﺧِﺬْﻧِﻰ ﺑِﻤَﺎ ﻧَﺴِﻴﺖُ وَﻻَ ﺗُﺮْﻫِﻘْﻨِﻰ

73  He said, “Do not rebuke me for

74  Then they set out. Until, when they 
encountered a boy, he killed him. He 
said, “Did you kill a pure soul, who 
killed no one? You have done 
something terrible.” 
٥٧
  
ﻗَﺎلَ أَﻟَﻢْ أَﻗُﻞ ﻟﱠﻚَ إِﻧﱠﻚَ ﻟَﻦ ﺗَﺴْﺘَﻄِﻴﻊَ ﻣَﻌِﻰَ

76  He said, “If I ask you about

received excuses from me.”

77  So they set out. Until, when they 
reached the people of a town, they 
asked them for food, but they 
refused to offer them hospitality. 
There they found a wall about to 
collapse, and he repaired it. He said, 
“If you wanted, you could have 
obtained a payment for it.”

79  As for the boat, it belonged to 
paupers working at sea. I wanted to 
damage it because there was a king 
coming after them seizing every boat 
by force.

80  As for the boy, his parents were 
believers, and we feared he would 
overwhelm them with oppression 
and disbelief.

81  So we wanted their Lord to 
replace him with someone better in 
purity, and closer to mercy.

82  And as for the wall, it belonged to 
two orphaned boys in the town. 
Beneath it was a treasure that 
belonged to them. Their father was a 
righteous man. Your Lord wanted 
them to reach their maturity, and 
then extract their treasure—as a 
mercy from your Lord. I did not do it 
of my own accord. This is the 
interpretation of what you were 
unable to endure.”

86  Until, when he reached the setting 
of the sun, he found it setting in a 
murky spring, and found a people in 
its vicinity. We said, “O Zul-Qarnain, 
you may either inflict a penalty, or 
else treat them kindly.”

86  So Moses returned to his people, 
angry and disappointed. He said, “O 
my people, did your Lord not 
promise you a good promise? Was 
the time too long for you? Or did you 
want wrath from your Lord to

127  Thus We recompense him who 
transgresses and does not believe in 
the revelations of his Lord. The 
punishment of the Hereafter is more 
severe, and more lasting.

128  Is it not instructive to them, how 
many generations before them We 
destroyed, in whose settlements 
they walk? Surely in that are signs 
for people of understanding.

from your Lord, the inevitable would 
have happened, but there is an 
appointed term.

130  So bear patiently what they say, 
and celebrate the praises of your 
Lord before the rising of the sun, and 
before its setting. And during the 
hours of the night glorify Him, and at 
the borders of the day, that you may 
be satisfied.

90  So We answered him, and gave

5  O people! If you are in doubt about 
the Resurrection—We created you 
from dust, then from a small drop, 
then from a clinging clot, then from a 
lump of flesh, partly developed and 
partly undeveloped. In order to 
clarify things for you. And We settle 
in the wombs whatever We will for a 
designated term, and then We bring 
you out as infants, until you reach 
your full strength. And some of you 
will pass away, and some of you will 
be returned to the vilest age, so that 
he may not know, after having 
known. And you see the earth still; 
but when We send down water on it, 
it vibrates, and swells, and grows all 
kinds of lovely pairs.

18  Do you not realize that to Allah 
prostrates everyone in the heavens 
and everyone on earth, and the sun, 
and the moon, and the stars, and the 
mountains, and the trees, and the 
animals, and many of the people? 
But many are justly deserving of 
punishment. Whomever Allah 
shames, there is none to honor him. 
Allah does whatever He wills.

55  Those who disbelieve will continue 
to be hesitant about it, until the Hour 
comes upon them suddenly, or there 
comes to them the torment of a 
desolate Day.

to Allah; He will judge between

good deeds will be in the Gardens of 
Bliss.

have a humiliating punishment.

58  Those who emigrate in Allah’s 
cause, then get killed, or die, Allah 
will provide them with fine 
provisions. Allah is the Best of 
Providers.

60  That is so! Whoever retaliates 
similarly to the affliction he was 
made to suffer, and then he is 
wronged again, Allah will definitely 
assist him. Allah is Pardoning and 
Forgiving.

61  That is because Allah merges the 
night into the day, and He merges 
the day into the night, and because 
Allah is Hearing and Seeing.

besides Him is vanity, and because 
Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.

65  Do you not see that Allah made 
everything on earth subservient to 
you? How the ships sail at sea by 
His command? That He holds up the 
sky lest it falls on earth—except by 
His permission? Allah is Gracious 
towards the people, Most Merciful.

dispute with you in this matter. And 
invite to your Lord; you are upon a

everything in the heavens and the 
earth? This is in a book. That is easy 
for Allah.

71  Yet they worship, besides Allah, 
things for which He sent down no 
warrant, and what they have no 
knowledge of. There is no savior for 
the transgressors.

so listen to it: Those you invoke 
besides Allah will never create a fly, 
even if they banded together for that 
purpose. And if the fly steals 
anything from them, they cannot 
recover it from it. Weak are the 
pursuer and the pursued.

39  As for those who disbelieve, their 
works are like a mirage in a desert. 
The thirsty assumes it is to be water. 
Until, when he has reached it, he 
finds it to be nothing, but there he 
finds Allah, Who settles his account 
in full. Allah is swift in reckoning.

fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he

see it. He to whom Allah has not 
granted a light has no light.

43  Have you not seen how Allah 
propels the clouds, then brings them 
together, then piles them into a 
heap, and you see rain drops 
emerging from its midst? How He 
brings down loads of hail from the 
sky, striking with it whomever He 
wills, and diverting it from whomever 
He wills? The flash of its lightening 
almost snatches the sight away.

factions. He persecuted a group of

sparing their daughters. He was truly 
a corrupter.

disclose him, had We not steadied 
her heart, that she may remain a 
believer.

not know.

18  The next morning, he went about 
in the city, fearful and vigilant, when 
the man who had sought his 
assistance the day before was 
shouting out to him. Moses said to 
him, “You are clearly a 
troublemaker.”

19  As he was about to strike the one 
who was their enemy, he said, “O 
Moses, do you intend to kill me, as 
you killed someone yesterday? You 
only want to be a bully in the land, 
and do not want to be a

20  And a man came from the farthest

25  Then, one of the two women 
approached him, walking bashfully. 
She said, “My father is calling you, to 
reward you for drawing water for us.” 
And when he came to him, and told 
him the story, he said, “Do not fear,

27  He said, “I want to marry you to

the two terms I fulfill, there shall be 
no reprisal against me; and Allah is

29  When Moses had completed the 
term, and departed with his family, 
he noticed a fire by the side of the 
Mount. He said to his family, “Stay 
here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps 
I can bring you some information 
from there, or an ember from the 
fire, that you may warm yourselves.”

he saw it wiggling, as if it were 
possessed, he turned his back to 
flee, and did not look back. “O 
Moses, come forward, and do not 
fear, you are perfectly safe.

43  We gave Moses the Scripture after 
We had annihilated the previous 
generations; as an illumination for 
mankind, and guidance, and mercy,

sending messengers.

it was a mercy from your Lord, that 
you may warn people who received 
no warner before you, so that they

47  Otherwise, if a calamity befell 
them as a result of what their hands

magic backing one another.” And 
they said, “We are disbelieving in

But most of them do not know.

8  We have advised the human being 
to be good to his parents. But if they 
urge you to associate with Me 
something you have no knowledge

10  Among the people is he who says, 
“We have believed in Allah.” Yet 
when he is harmed on Allah’s 
account, he equates the people's 
persecution with Allah’s retribution. 
And if help comes from your Lord, 
he says, “We were actually with 
you.” Is not Allah aware of what is 
inside the hearts of the people?

5  Call them after their fathers; that is 
more equitable with Allah. But if you 
do not know their fathers, then your 
brethren in faith and your friends. 
There is no blame on you if you err 
therein, barring what your hearts 
premeditates. Allah is Forgiving and 
Merciful.

6  The Prophet is more caring of the 
believers than they are of 
themselves, and his wives are 
mothers to them. And blood-relatives 
are closer to one another in Allah’s 
Book than the believers or the 
emigrants, though you should do 
good to your friends. That is 
inscribed in the Book.

nothing but illusion.”

13  And when a group of them said, 
“O people of Yathrib, you cannot 
make a stand, so retreat.” And a 
faction of them asked the Prophet to 
excuse them, saying, “Our homes 
are exposed,” although they were 
not exposed. They only wanted to 
flee.

had blessed, and you had favored, 
“Keep your wife to yourself, and fear 
Allah.” But you hid within yourself 
what Allah was to reveal. And you 
feared the people, but it was Allah 
you were supposed to fear. Then, 
when Zaid ended his relationship 
with her, We gave her to you in 
marriage, that there may be no 
restriction for believers regarding the 
wives of their adopted sons, when 
their relationship has ended. The 
command of Allah was fulfilled.

Prophet, and he shies away from 
you, but Allah does not shy away 
from the truth. And when you ask his 
wives for something, ask them from 
behind a screen; that is purer for 
your hearts and their hearts. You 
must never offend the Messenger of

by asking your ewe in addition to his 
ewes. Many partners take 
advantage of one another, except 
those who believe and do good

15  As for Aad, they turned arrogant 
on earth, and opposed justice, and 
said, “Who is more powerful than

Allah, who created them, is more 
powerful than they? And they went

16  So We unleashed upon them a 
screaming wind, for a few miserable 
days, to make them taste the 
punishment of shame in this life; but 
the punishment of the Hereafter is 
more shameful; and they will not be 
saved.

kindness to his parents. His mother 
carried him with difficulty, and 
delivered him with difficulty. His 
bearing and weaning takes thirty 
months. Until, when he has attained 
his maturity, and has reached forty 
years, he says, “Lord, enable me to 
appreciate the blessings You have 
bestowed upon me and upon my 
parents, and to act with 
righteousness, pleasing You. And 
improve my children for me. I have 
sincerely repented to You, and I am 
of those who have surrendered.”

That is because they disregarded 
the revelations of Allah; and so they 
became surrounded by what they 
used to ridicule.

28  Why then did the idols, whom they 
worshiped as means of nearness to 
Allah, not help them? In fact, they 
abandoned them. It was their lie, a 
fabrication of their own making.

Then, when you have routed them, 
bind them firmly. Then, either 
release them by grace, or by 
ransom, until war lays down its 
burdens. Had Allah willed, He could 
have defeated them Himself, but He 
thus tests some of you by means of 
others. As for those who are killed in 
the way of Allah, He will not let their 
deeds go to waste.

ﺑَﻞْ ﻋَﺠِﺒُﻮٓ ا۟ أَن ﺟَﺎٓءَﻫُﻢ ﻣﱡﻨﺬِرٌ ﻣﱢﻨْﻬُﻢْ ﻓَﻘَﺎلَ

ﻫَٰﺬَا ﺷَﻰْ ءٌ ﻋَﺠِﻴﺐٌ 
 
2  They marveled that a warner has 
come to them from among them. 
The disbelievers say, “This is 
something strange. 
   ٣
أَءِ ذَا ﻣِﺘْﻨَﺎ وَﻛُﻨﱠﺎ ﺗُﺮَاﺑًﺎ ۖ ذَٰﻟِﻚَ رَﺟْﻊٌۢ ﺑَﻌِﻴﺪٌ 
 3  When we have died and become 
dust? This is a farfetched return.” 
   ٤
ﻗَﺪْ ﻋَﻠِﻤْﻨَﺎ ﻣَﺎ ﺗَﻨﻘُﺺُ 
ٱﻷْ َرْضُ 
 
ﻣِﻨْﻬُﻢْ ۖ وَﻋِﻨﺪَﻧَﺎ

4  We know what the earth consumes 
of them, and with Us is a 
comprehensive book.

ﻟَﻤﱠﺎ ﺟَﺎٓءَﻫُﻢْ ﻓَﻬُﻢْ ﻓِﻰٓ أَﻣْﺮٍ

5  But they denied the truth when it 
has come to them, so they are in a 
confused state. 
   ٦
أَﻓَﻠَﻢْ ﻳَﻨﻈُﺮُوٓ ا۟ إِﻟَﻰ

6  Have they not observed the sky 
above them, how We constructed it, 
and decorated it, and it has no 
cracks? 
وَ    ٧
ٱﻷْ َرْضَ 
  ﻣَﺪَدْﻧَٰﻬَﺎ وَ أَﻟْﻘَﻴْﻨَﺎ ﻓِﻴﻬَﺎ رَوَٰﺳِﻰَ وَ أَﻧۢﺒَﺘْﻨَﺎ

7  And the earth, how We spread it 
out, and set on it mountains, and 
grew in it all kinds of delightful pairs? 
   ٨
ﺗَﺒْﺼِﺮَةً وَ ذِﻛْﺮَىٰ ﻟِﻜُﻞﱢ ﻋَﺒْﺪٍ ﻣﱡﻨِﻴﺐٍ 
 8  A lesson and a reminder for every 
penitent worshiper.

9  And We brought down from the sky 
blessed water, and produced with it 
gardens and grain to harvest.

11  As sustenance for the servants. 
And We revive thereby a dead town. 
Likewise is the resurrection.

12  Before them the people of Noah 
denied the truth, and so did the 
dwellers of Russ, and Thamood. 
   ٣١
وَﻋَﺎدٌ وَﻓِﺮْﻋَﻮْ نُ وَ إِﺧْﻮَٰ

27  Then We sent in their wake Our 
messengers, and followed up with 
Jesus son of Mary, and We gave 
him the Gospel, and instilled in the 
hearts of those who followed him 
compassion and mercy. But as for 
the monasticism which they 
invented—We did not ordain it for 
them—only to seek Allah’s approval. 
But they did not observe it with its 
due observance. So We gave those 
of them who believed their reward, 
but many of them are sinful.

2  It is He who evicted those who 
disbelieved among the People of the 
Book from their homes at the first 
mobilization. You did not think they 
would leave, and they thought their 
fortresses would protect them from 
Allah. But Allah came at them from 
where they never expected, and 
threw terror into their hearts. They 
wrecked their homes with their own 
hands, and by the hands of the 
believers. Therefore, take a lesson, 
O you who have insight.

4  You have had an excellent 
example in Abraham and those with 
him; when they said to their people, 
“We are quit of you, and what you 
worship apart from Allah. We 
denounce you. Enmity and hatred 
has surfaced between us and you, 
forever, until you believe in Allah 
alone.” Except for the words of 
Abraham to his father, “I will ask 
forgiveness for you, though I have 
no power from Allah to do anything 
for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust, 
and to You we repent, and to You is 
the ultimate resort.

10  O you who believe! When 
believing women come to you 
emigrating, test them. Allah is Aware 
of their faith. And if you find them to 
be faithful, do not send them back to 
the unbelievers. They are not lawful 
for them, nor are they lawful for 
them. But give them what they have 
spent. You are not at fault if you 
marry them, provided you give them 
their compensation. And do not hold 
on to ties with unbelieving women, 
but demand what you have spent, 
and let them demand what they 
have spent. This is the rule of Allah; 
He rules among you. Allah is 
Knowing and Wise.

11  If any of your wives desert you to 
the unbelievers, and you decide to 
penalize them, give those whose 
wives have gone away the 
equivalent of what they had spent. 
And fear Allah, in whom you are 
believers.

5  The example of those who were 
entrusted with the Torah, but then 
failed to uphold it, is like the donkey 
carrying works of literature. 
Miserable is the example of the 
people who denounce Allah’s 
revelations. Allah does not guide the 
wrongdoing people.

6  Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if 
you claim to be the chosen of Allah, 
to the exclusion of the rest of 
mankind, then wish for death if you 
are sincere.” 
   ٧
وَﻻَ ﻳَﺘَﻤَﻨﱠﻮْﻧَﻪُ

flee will catch up with you; then you 
will be returned to the Knower of the 
Invisible and the Visible, and He will 
inform you of what you used to do.”

9  O you who believe! When the call 
is made for prayer on Congregation 
Day, hasten to the remembrance of 
Allah, and drop all business. That is 
better for you, if you only knew.

10  Then, when the prayer is 
concluded, disperse through the 
land, and seek Allah’s bounty, and 
remember Allah much, so that you 
may prosper.

11  Yet whenever they come across 
some business, or some

towards it, and leave you standing. 
Say, “What is with Allah is better 
than entertainment and business; 
and Allah is the Best of providers.”

are Allah’s Messenger.” Allah knows 
that you are His Messenger, and

2  They treat their oaths as a cover, 
and so they repel others from Allah’s 
path. Evil is what they do. 
   ٣ ٰذَٰﻟِﻚَ ﺑِﺄَﻧﱠﻬُﻢْ ءَ اﻣَﻨُﻮا۟ ﺛُﻢﱠ ﻛَﻔَﺮُوا۟ ﻓَﻄُﺒِﻊَ ﻋَﻠَﻰ

3  That is because they believed, and 
then disbelieved; so their hearts 
were sealed, and they cannot 
understand.

4  When you see them, their 
appearance impresses you. And 
when they speak, you listen to what 
they say. They are like propped-up 
timber. They think every shout is 
aimed at them. They are the enemy, 
so beware of them. Allah condemns 
them; how deluded they are!

5  And when it is said to them, 
“Come, the Messenger of Allah will 
ask forgiveness for you,” they bend 
their heads, and you see them 
turning away arrogantly. 
   ٦

6  It is the same for them, whether 
you ask forgiveness for them, or do 
not ask forgiveness for them; Allah 
will not forgive them. Allah does not 
guide the sinful people.

7  It is they who say: “Do not spend 
anything on those who side with 
Allah’s Messenger, unless they have 
dispersed.” To Allah belong the 
treasures of the heavens and the 
earth, but the hypocrites do not 
understand.

Allah, and His Messenger, and the 
believers; but the hypocrites do not 
know.

1  O Prophet! If any of you divorce 
women, divorce them during their 
period of purity, and calculate their 
term. And be pious before Allah, 
your Lord. And do not evict them 
from their homes, nor shall they 
leave, unless they have committed a 
proven adultery. These are the limits 
of Allah—whoever oversteps Allah’s 
limits has wronged his own soul. 
You never know; Allah may 
afterwards bring about a new 
situation.

 53  No indeed! But they do not fear 
the Hereafter. 
   ٤٥
ﻛَﻼﱠ ٓ إِﻧﱠﻪُ

 54  Nevertheless, it is a reminder.

it.

Allah wills. He is the Source of 
Righteousness, and the Source of 
Forgiveness.
