Editor’s Preface
The seminal ‘MIT notes’ of Dennis Sullivan were issued in June
1970 and were widely circulated at the time. The notes had a ma-
jor inﬂuence on the development of both algebraic and geometric
topology, pioneering
the localization and completion of spaces in homotopy theory,
including p-local, proﬁnite and rational homotopy theory, lead-
ing to the solution of the Adams conjecture on the relationship
between vector bundles and spherical ﬁbrations,
the formulation of the ‘Sullivan conjecture’ on the contractibility
of the space of maps from the classifying space of a ﬁnite group
to a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex,
the action of the Galois group of Q over Q on smooth manifold
structures in proﬁnite homotopy theory,
the K-theory orientation of PL manifolds and bundles.
Some of this material has been already published by Sullivan him-
self: in an article1 in the Proceedings of the 1970 Nice ICM, and
in the 1974 Annals of Mathematics papers Genetics of homotopy
theory and the Adams conjecture and The transversality character-
istic class and linking cycles in surgery theory2. Many of the ideas
originating in the notes have been the starting point of subsequent

developments3. However, the text itself retains a unique ﬂavour of
its time, and of the range of Sullivan’s ideas. As Wall wrote in sec-
tion 17F Sullivan’s results of his book Surgery on compact manifolds
(1971) : Also, it is diﬃcult to summarise Sullivan’s work so brieﬂy:
the full philosophical exposition in (the notes) should be read. The
notes were supposed to be Part I of a larger work; unfortunately,
Part II was never written. The volume concludes with a Postscript
written by Sullivan in 2004, which sets the notes in the context of
his entire mathematical oeuvre as well as some of his family life,
bringing the story up to date.
The notes have had a somewhat underground existence, as a kind
of Western samizdat. Paradoxically, a Russian translation was pub-
lished in the Soviet Union in 19754, but this has long been out of
print. As noted in Mathematical Reviews, the translation does not
include the jokes and other irrelevant material that enlivened the
English edition.
The current edition is a faithful reproduction of
the original, except that some minor errors have been corrected.
The notes were TeX’ed by Iain Rendall, who also redrew all the
diagrams using METAPOST. The 1970 Nice ICM article was Tex’ed
by Karen Duhart. Pete Bousﬁeld and Guido Mislin helped prepare
the bibliography, which lists the most important books and papers
in the last 35 years bearing witness to the enduring inﬂuence of the
notes. Martin Crossley did some preliminary proofreading, which
was completed by Greg Brumﬁel (“ein Mann der ersten Stunde”5).
Dennis Sullivan himself has supported the preparation of this edition
via his Albert Einstein Chair in Science at CUNY. I am very grateful
to all the above for their help.

Preface
This compulsion to localize began with the author’s work on in-
variants of combinatorial manifolds in 1965-67. It was clear from the
beginning that the prime 2 and the odd primes had to be treated
diﬀerently.
This point arises algebraically when one looks at the invariants of
a quadratic form1. (Actually for manifolds only characteristic 2 and
characteristic zero invariants are considered.)
The point arises geometrically when one tries to see the extent of
these invariants. In this regard the question of representing cycles
by submanifolds comes up. At 2 every class is representable. At odd
primes there are many obstructions. (Thom).
The invariants at odd primes required more investigation because
of the simple non-representing fact about cycles. The natural invari-
ant is the signature invariant of M – the function which assigns the
“signature of the intersection with M” to every closed submanifold
of a tubular neighborhood of M in Euclidean space.
A natural algebraic formulation of this invariant is that of a canon-
ical K-theory orientation
△M ∈K-homology of M .
1Which according to Winkelnkemper “... is the basic discretization of a compact manifold.”

In Chapter 6 we discuss this situation in the dual context of bun-
dles. This (Alexander) duality between manifold theory and bundle
theory depends on transversality and the geometric technique of
surgery. The duality is sharp in the simply connected context.
Thus in this work we treat only the dual bundle theory – however
motivated by questions about manifolds.
The bundle theory is homotopy theoretical and amenable to the
arithmetic discussions in the ﬁrst Chapters.
This discussion con-
cerns the problem of “tensoring homotopy theory” with various
rings.
Most notable are the cases when Z is replaced by the ra-
tionals Q or the p-adic integers ˆZp.
These localization processes are motivated in part by the ‘invari-
ants discussion’ above.
The geometric questions do not however
motivate going as far as the p-adic integers.2
One is led here by Adams’ work on ﬁbre homotopy equivalences
between vector bundles – which is certainly germane to the manifold
questions above. Adams ﬁnds that a certain basic homotopy relation
should hold between vector bundles related by his famous operations
ψk.
Adams proves that this relation is universal (if it holds at all) –
a very provocative state of aﬀairs.
Actually Adams states inﬁnitely many relations – one for each
prime p. Each relation has information at every prime not equal to
p.
At this point Quillen noticed that the Adams conjecture has an
analogue in characteristic p which is immediately provable. He sug-
gested that the etale homotopy of mod p algebraic varieties be used
to decide the topological Adams conjecture.
Meanwhile, the Adams conjecture for vector bundles was seen to
inﬂuence the structure of piecewise linear and topological theories.
The author tried to ﬁnd some topological or geometric under-
standing of Adams’ phenomenon. What resulted was a reformula-
tion which can be proved just using the existence of an algebraic
2Although the Hasse-Minkowski theorem on quadratic forms should do this.

construction of the ﬁnite cohomology of an algebraic variety (etale
theory).
This picture which can only be described in the context of the
p-adic integers is the following – in the p-adic context the theory of
vector bundles in each dimension has a natural group of symmetries.
These symmetries in the (n−1) dimensional theory provide canon-
ical ﬁbre homotopy equivalence in the n dimensional theory which
more than prove the assertion of Adams. In fact each orbit of the
action has a well deﬁned (unstable) ﬁbre homotopy type.
The symmetry in these vector bundle theories is the Galois sym-
metry of the roots of unity homotopy theoretically realized in the
‘ˇCech nerves’ of algebraic coverings of Grassmannians.
The symmetry extends to K-theory and a dense subset of the sym-
metries may be identiﬁed with the “isomorphic part of the Adams
operations”. We note however that this identiﬁcation is not essential
in the development of consequences of the Galois phenomena. The
fact that certain complicated expressions in exterior powers of vec-
tor bundles give good operations in K-theory is more a testament to
Adams’ ingenuity than to the ultimate naturality of this viewpoint.
The Galois symmetry (because of the K-theory formulation of
the signature invariant) extends to combinatorial theory and even
topological theory (because of the triangulation theorems of Kirby-
Siebenmann). This symmetry can be combined with the periodicity
of geometric topology to extend Adams’ program in several ways –
i) the homotopy relation implied by conjugacy under the action
of the Galois group holds in the topological theory and is also
universal there.
ii) an explicit calculation of the eﬀect of the Galois group on the
topology can be made –
for vector bundles E the signature invariant has an analytical
description,
△E in KC(E) ,
and the topological type of E is measured by the eﬀect of the
Galois group on this invariant.

xii
One consequence is that two diﬀerent vector bundles which are
ﬁxed by elements of ﬁnite order in the Galois group are also topolog-
ically distinct. For example, at the prime 3 the torsion subgroup is
generated by complex conjugation – thus any pair of non isomorphic
vector bundles are topologically distinct at 3.
The periodicity alluded to is that in the theory of ﬁbre homotopy
equivalences between PL or topological bundles (see Chapter 6 -
Normal Invariants).
For odd primes this theory is isomorphic to K-theory, and geomet-
ric periodicity becomes Bott periodicity. (For non-simply connected
manifolds the periodicity ﬁnds beautiful algebraic expression in the
surgery groups of C. T. C. Wall.)
To carry out the discussion of Chapter 6 we need the works of the
ﬁrst ﬁve chapters.
The main points are contained in chapters 3 and 5.
In chapter 3 a description of the p-adic completion of a homotopy
type is given.
The resulting object is a homotopy type with the
extra structure3 of a compact topology on the contravariant functor
it determines.
The p-adic types one for each p can be combined with a rational
homotopy type (Chapter 2) to build a classical homotopy type.
One point about these p-adic types is that they often have sym-
metry which is not apparent or does not exist in the classical con-
text. For example in Chapter 4 where p-adic spherical ﬁbrations are
discussed, we ﬁnd from the extra symmetry in C P∞, p-adically com-
pleted, one can construct a theory of principal spherical ﬁbrations
(one for each divisor of p −1).
Another point about p-adic homotopy types is that they can be
naturally constructed from the Grothendieck theory of etale coho-
mology in algebraic geometry.
The long chapter 5 concerns this
etale theory which we explicate using the ˇCech like construction of
Lubkin. This construction has geometric appeal and content and
should yield many applications in geometric homotopy theory.4
3which is “intrinsic” to the homotopy type in the sense of interest here.
4The study of homotopy theory that has geometric signiﬁcance by geometrical qua homotopy
theoretical methods.

xiii
To form these p-adic homotopy types we use the inverse limit
technique of Chapter 3. The arithmetic square of Chapter 3 shows
what has to be added to the etale homotopy type to give the classical
homotopy type.5
We consider the Galois symmetry in vector bundle theory in some
detail and end with an attempt to analyze “real varieties”.
The
attempt leads to an interesting topological conjecture.
Chapter 1 gives some algebraic background and preparation for
the later Chapters. It contains the examples of proﬁnite groups in
topology and algebra that concern us here.
In part II6 we study the prime 2 and try to interpret geometrically
the structure in Chapter 6 on the manifold level. We will also pursue
the idea of a localized manifold – a concept which has interesting
examples from algebra and geometry.
Finally, we acknowledge our debt to John Morgan of Princeton
University – who mastered the lion’s share of material in a few short
months with one lecture of suggestions. He prepared an earlier man-
uscript on the beginning Chapters and I am certain this manuscript
would not have appeared now (or in the recent future) without his
considerable eﬀorts.
Also, the calculations of Greg Brumﬁel were psychologically in-
valuable in the beginning of this work. I greatly enjoyed and bene-
ﬁted from our conversations at Princeton in 1967 and later.

Chapter 1
ALGEBRAIC CONSTRUCTIONS
We will discuss some algebraic constructions. These are localiza-
tion and completion of rings and groups. We consider properties of
each and some connections between them.
Localization
Unless otherwise stated rings will have units and be integral do-
mains.
Let R be a ring. S ⊆R −{0} is a multiplicative subset if 1 ∈S
and a, b ∈S implies a · b ∈S.
Definition 1.1 If S ⊆R −{0} is a multiplicative subset then
S−1R , “R localized away from S”
is deﬁned as equivalence classes
{r/s | r ∈R, s ∈S}
where
r/s ∼r′/s′
iﬀrs′ = r′s .
1

2
S−1R is made into a ring by deﬁning
[r/s] · [r′/s′] = [rr′/ss′] and
[r/s] + [r′/s′] =
·rs′ + sr′
ss
¸
.
The localization homomorphism
R →S−1R
sends r into [r/1].
Example 1 If p ⊂R is a prime ideal, R−p is a multiplicative subset.
Deﬁne
Rp , “R localized at p”
as (R −p)−1R.
In Rp every element outside pRp is invertible. The localization
map R →Rp sends p into the unique maximal ideal of non-units in
Rp.
If R is an integral domain 0 is a prime ideal, and R localized at
zero is the ﬁeld of quotients of R.
The localization of the ring R extends to the theory of modules
over R.
If M is an R-module, deﬁne the localized S−1R-module,
S−1M by
S−1M = M ⊗R S−1R .
Intuitively S−1M is obtained by making all the operations on M
by elements of S into isomorphisms.
Interesting examples occur in topology.
Example 2 (P. A. Smith, A. Borel, G. Segal) Let X be a locally
compact polyhedron with a symmetry of order 2 (involution), T.
What is the relation between the homology of the subcomplex of
ﬁxed points F and the “homology of the pair (X, T)”?
Let S denote the (contractible) inﬁnite dimensional sphere with
its antipodal involution. Then X × S has the diagonal ﬁxed point
free involution and there is an equivariant homotopy class of maps
X × S →S

(which is unique up to equivariant homotopy). This gives a map
XT ≡(X × S)/T →S/T ≡R P∞
and makes the “equivariant cohomology of (X, T)”
H∗(XT ; Z/2)
into an R-module, where
R = Z2 [x] = H∗(R P∞; Z/2) .
In R we have the multiplicative set S generated by x, and the coho-
mology of the ﬁxed points with coeﬃcients in the ring S−1R = Rx =
R[x−1] is just the localized equivariant cohomology,
H∗(F; Rx) ∼= H∗(XT ; Z/2) with x inverted ≡H∗(XT ; Z/2) ⊗R Rx .
For most of our work we do not need this general situation of
localization. We will consider most often the case where R is the
ring of integers and the R-modules are arbitrary Abelian groups.
Let ℓbe a set of primes in Z. We will write “Z localized at ℓ”
Zℓ= S−1 Z
where S is the multiplicative set generated by the primes not in ℓ.
When ℓcontains only one prime ℓ= {p}, we can write
Zℓ= Zp
since Zℓis just the localization of the integers at the prime ideal p.
Other examples are
Z{all primes} = Z and Z∅= Q = Z0 .
In general, it is easy to see that the collection of Zℓ’s
{Zℓ}
is just the collection of subrings of Q with unit. We will see below
that the tensor product over Z,
Zℓ⊗Z Zℓ′ ∼= Zℓ∩ℓ′

4
and the ﬁbre product over Q
Zℓ×Q Zℓ′ ∼= Zℓ∪ℓ′ .
We localize Abelian groups at ℓas indicated above.
Definition 1.2 If G is an Abelian group then the localization of G
with respect to a set of primes ℓ, Gℓis the Zℓ-module
G ⊗Zℓ.
The natural inclusion Z →Zℓinduces the “localization homomor-
phism”
G →Gℓ.
We can describe localization as a direct limit procedure.
Order the multiplicative set {s} of products of primes not in ℓby
divisibility. Form a directed system of groups and homomorphisms
indexed by the directed set = {s} with
Gs = G
multiplication by s′/s
−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→Gs′ if s ⩽s′ .
Proposition 1.1
lim

s
Gs ∼= G ⊗Zℓ≡Gℓ.
Proof: Deﬁne compatible maps
Gs →G ⊗Zℓ
by g 7→g ⊗1/s. These determine
lim
−→
s
Gs →G ⊗Zℓ.
In case G = Z this map is clearly an isomorphism. (Each map
Z →Zℓis an injection thus the direct limit injects. Also a/s in Zℓis
in the image of Z = Gs →Zℓ.)
The general case follows since taking direct limits commutes with
tensor products.
Lemma 1.2 If ℓand ℓ′ are two sets of primes, then Zℓ⊗Zℓ′ is iso-
morphic to Zℓ∩ℓ′ as rings.

Proof: Deﬁne a map on generators
Zℓ⊗Zℓ′
ρ−→Zℓ∩ℓ′
by ρ(a/b ⊗a′/b′) = aa′/bb′. Since b is a product of primes outside ℓ
and b′ is a product of primes outside ℓ′, bb′ is a product of primes
outside ℓ∩ℓ′ and ρ is well deﬁned.
To see that ρ is onto, take r/s in Zℓ∩ℓ′ and factor s = s1s2 so that
“s1 is outside ℓ” and “s2 is outside ℓ′.” Then ρ(1/s1 ⊗r/s2) = r/s.
To see that ρ is an embedding assume
X

ai/bi ⊗ci/di
ρ−→0 .
Then
X

aici/bidi = 0, or
X

so ρ has kernel = {0}.
Lemma 1.3 The Z-module structure on an Abelian group G extends
to a Zℓ-module structure if and only if G is isomorphic to its local-
izations at every set of primes containing ℓ.
Proof: This follows from Proposition 1.1.

Proposition 1.4 Localization takes exact sequences of Abelian groups
into exact sequences of Abelian groups.
Proof: This also follows from Proposition 1.1 since passage to a
direct limit preserves exactness.
Corollary 1.5 If 0 →A →B →C →0 is an exact sequence of
Abelian groups and two of the three groups are Zℓ-modules then so
is the third.
Proof: Consider the localization diagram

²

The lower sequence is exact by Proposition 1.4. By hypothesis and
Lemma 1.2 two of the maps are isomorphisms. By the Five Lemma
the third is also.
Corollary 1.6 If in the long exact sequence
· · · →An →Bn →Cn →An−1 →Bn−1 →. . .
two of the three sets of groups
{An}, {Bn}, {Cn}
are Zℓ-modules, then so is the third.
Proof: Apply the Five Lemma as above.
Corollary 1.7 Let F →E →B be a Serre ﬁbration of connected
spaces with Abelian fundamental groups. Then if two of
π∗F, π∗E, π∗B
are Zℓ-modules the third is also.
Proof: This follows from the exact homotopy sequence
· · · →πiF →πiE →πiB →. . . .
This situation extends easily to homology.
Proposition 1.8 Let F →E →B be a Serre ﬁbration in which π1B

acts trivially on eH∗(F; Z/p) for primes p not in ℓ. Then if two of
the integral
eH∗F, eH∗E, eH∗B
are Zℓ-modules, the third is also.
Proof: eH∗X is a Zℓ-module iﬀeH∗(X; Z/p) vanishes for p not in ℓ.
This follows from the exact sequence of coeﬃcients
· · · →eHi(X)
p−→eHi(X) →eHi(X; Z/p) →. . . .
But from the Serre spectral sequence with Z/p coeﬃcients we can
conclude that if two of
eH∗(F; Z/p), eH∗(E; Z/p), eH∗(B; Z/p)
vanish the third does also.
Note: We are indebted to D. W. Anderson for this very simple
proof of Proposition 1.8.
Let us say that a square of Abelian groups

Lemma 1.9 The direct limit of ﬁbre squares is a ﬁbre square.
Proof: The direct limit of exact sequences is an exact sequence.
Proposition 1.10 If G is any Abelian group and ℓand ℓ′ are two
sets of primes such that
ℓ∩ℓ′ = ∅, ℓ∪ℓ′ = all primes
then

is a ﬁbre square.
Proof:
Case 1: G = Z: an easy argument shows
0 →Z →Zℓ⊕Zℓ′ →Q →0
is exact.
Case 2: G = Z/pα, the square reduces to

Case 3: G is a ﬁnitely generated group: this is a ﬁnite direct sum of
the ﬁrst two cases.
Case 4: G any Abelian group: this follows from case 3 and Lemma
1.9.
We can paraphrase the proposition “G is the ﬁbre product of its
localizations Gℓand Gℓ′ over G0,”
More generally, we have

Then G is the inﬁnite ﬁbre product of its localizations G2, G3,
. . . over G0.
Proof: The previous proposition shows G(2,3) is the ﬁbre product
of G(2) and G(3) over G(0). Then G(2,3,5) is the ﬁbre product of G(2,3)
and G(5) over G(0), etc. This description depends on ordering the
primes; however since the particular ordering used is immaterial the
statement should be regarded symmetrically.

Completions
We turn now to completion of rings and groups.
As for rings
we are again concerned mostly with the ring of integers for which
we discuss the “arithmetic completions”. In the case of groups we
consider proﬁnite completions and for Abelian groups related formal
completions.
At the end of the Chapter we consider some examples of proﬁnite
groups in topology and algebra and discuss the structure of the p-
adic units.
Finally we consider connections between localizations and com-
pletions, deriving certain ﬁbre squares which occur later on the CW
complex level.
Completion of Rings – the p-adic Integers
Let R be a ring with unit. Let
I1 ⊃I2 ⊃. . .
be a decreasing sequence of ideals in R with
∞
\
j=1
Ij = {0} .
We can use these ideals to deﬁne a metric on R, namely
d(x, y) = e−k, e > 1
where x−y ∈Ik but x−y ̸∈Ik+1, (I0 = R). If x−y ∈Ik and y−z ∈Il
then x −z ∈Imin(k, l). Thus
d(x, z) ⩽max
¡
d(x, y), d(y, z)
¢
,
a strong form of triangle inequality. Also, d(x, y) = 0 means
x −y ∈
∞
\
j=0
Ij = {0} .
This means that d deﬁnes a distance function on the ring R.

10
Definition 1.3 Given a ring with metric d, deﬁne the completion
of R with respect to d, bRd, by the Cauchy sequence procedure. That
is, form all sequences in R, {xn}, so that1
lim
n,m→∞d(xn, xm) = 0 .
Make {xn} equivalent to {yn} if d(xn, yn) →0.
Then the set of
equivalence classes bRd is made into a topological ring by deﬁning
[{xn}] + [{yn}] = [{xn + yn}] ,
[{xn}] · [{yn}] = [{xnyn}] .
There is a natural completion homomorphism
R c−→bRd
sending r into [{r, r, . . . }]. c is universal with respect to continuous
ring maps into complete topological rings.
Example 1 Let Ij = (pj) ⊆Z. The induced topology is the p-adic
topology on Z, and the completion is the ring of p-adic integers, bZp.
The ring bZp was constructed by Hensel to study Diophantine equa-
tions. A solution in bZp corresponds to solving the associated Dio-
phantine congruence modulo arbitrarily high powers of p.
Solving such congruences for all moduli becomes equivalent to an
inﬁnite number of independent problems over the various rings of
p-adic numbers.
Certain non-trivial polynomials can be completely factored in bZp,
for example
xp−1 −1
(see the proof of Proposition 1.16.)
Thus here and in other situations we are faced with the pleas-
ant possibility of studying independent p-adic projections of familiar
problems over Z armed with such additional tools as (p −1)st roots
of unity.
1In this context it is suﬃcient to assume that d(xn, xn+1) →0 to have a Cauchy sequence.

Example 2 Let ℓbe a non-void subset of the primes (p1, p2, . . . ) =
(2, 3, . . . ). Deﬁne
Iℓ
j = (
Y
pj)p∈ℓ,p⩽pj .
The resulting topology on Z is the ℓ-adic topology and the comple-
tion is denoted bZℓ.
If ℓ′ ⊂ℓthen Iℓ
j ⊂Iℓ′
j
and any Cauchy sequence in the ℓ-adic
topology is Cauchy in the ℓ′-adic topology. This gives a map
bZℓ→bZℓ′ .
Proposition 1.13 Form the inverse system of rings {Z/pn}, where
Z/pn →Z/pm is a reduction mod pm whenever n ⩾m. Then there
is a natural ring isomorphism
bZp
bρp
−→
∼
= lim
←{Z/pn} .
Proof: First deﬁne a ring homomorphism
bZp −→
ρn Z/pn .
If {xi} is a Cauchy sequence in Z, the pn residue of xi is constant
for large i so deﬁne
bρn[{xi}] = stable residue xi .
If {xi} is equivalent to {yi}, pn eventually divides every xi −yi, so
ρn is well deﬁned.
The collection of homomorphisms ρn are clearly onto and com-
patible with the maps in the inverse system. Thus they deﬁne
bZp −→
bρp lim
←Z/pn .
bρp is injective. For bρp{xi} = 0, means pn eventually divides xi for
all n. Thus {xi} is eventually in In for every n. This is exactly the
condition that {xi} is equivalent to {0, 0, 0, . . . }.
bρp is surjective.
If (ri) is a compatible sequence of residues in
lim
←Z/pn, let {eri} be a sequence of integers in this sequence of residue
classes. {eri} is clearly a Cauchy sequence and
bρp{eri} = (ri) ∈lim
←Z/pn

12
Corollary bZp is compact.
Proof: The isomorphism bρp is a homeomorphism with respect to
the inverse limit topology on lim
←Z/pn.

is naturally isomorphic to the complex K-theory of R P∞,
bR ∼= K(R P∞) ≡[R P∞, Z × BU] .
It is easy to see that additively this completion of R is isomorphic
to the integers direct sum the 2-adic integers.
Example 4 (K(ﬁxed point set), Atiyah and Segal)
Consider again
the compact space X with involution T, ﬁxed point set F, and ‘ho-
motopy theoretical orbit space’, XT = X × S∞/((x, s) ∼(Tx, −s)).
We have the Grothendieck ring of equivariant vector bundles over
X, KG(X) – a ring over the representation ring R.
KG(X) is a
rather subtle invariant of the geometry of (X, T). However, Atiyah
and Segal show that
i) the completion of KG(X) with respect to the ideals (x −1)jKG(X)
is the K-theory of XT .
ii) the completion of KG(X) with respect to the ideals (x + 1)jKG(X)
is related to K(F).
If we complete KG(X) with respect to the ideals (x −1, x + 1)jKG(X)
(which is equivalent to 2-adic completion)2 we obtain the isomor-
phism
K(F) ⊗bZ2[x]/(x2 −1) ∼= K(XT )ˆ
2 .
We will use this relation in Chapter 5 to give an ‘algebraic descrip-
tion’ of the K-theory3 of the real points on a real algebraic variety.
Completions of Groups
Now we consider two kinds of completions for groups. First there
are the proﬁnite completions.
Let G be any group and ℓa non-void set of primes in Z. Denote
the collection of those normal subgroups of G with index a product
of primes in ℓby {H}ℓ.
2(x −1, x + 1)2 ⊂(2) ⊂(x −1, x + 1).
3Tensored with the group ring of Z/2 over the 2-adic integers.

14
Now {H}ℓcan be partially ordered by
H1 ⩽H2 iﬀH1 ⊆H2 .
Definition 1.4 The ℓ-proﬁnite completion of G is the inverse limit
of the canonical ﬁnite ℓ-quotients of G –
bGℓ= lim
←
{H}ℓ
(G/H) .
The ℓ-proﬁnite completion bGℓis topologized by the inverse limit
of the discrete topologies on the G/H’s. Thus bGℓbecomes a totally
disconnected compact topological group.
The natural map
G →bGℓ
is clearly universal4 for maps of G into ﬁnite ℓ-groups.
This construction is functorial because the diagram
H = f−1H′
²
/ H′
²
G
²
f
/ G′
²
G/H
¯f
/ G′/H′
shows f induces a map of inverse systems –
{H′}ℓ→{f−1H′}ℓ⊆{H}ℓ
G/H
¯f−→G′/H′, H = f−1H′
and thus we have bf
bGℓ≡lim
←G/H
bf−→lim
←G′/H′ ≡bG′
ℓ.
4There is a unique continuous map of the completion extending over a given map of G into
a ﬁnite group.

p-proﬁnite completion
of the group G

Z/pn
which agrees (additively) with the ring theoretic p-adic comple-
tion of Z, the “p-adic integers”.
2) Again G = Z, ℓ= {p1, p2, . . . }. Then
Zℓ= lim

α = {(α1, α2, . . . , αi, 0, 0, 0, . . . )}

5) If G is ℓ-divisible, then ℓ-proﬁnite completion reduces G to the
trivial group. For example,
bQℓ= 0, (Q / Z)ℓ= 0 .
6) The p-proﬁnite completion of the inﬁnite direct sum

From the examples we see that proﬁnite completion is exact for
ﬁnitely generated Abelian groups but is not exact in general, e.g.
0 →Z →Q →Q / Z →0
becomes
0 →bZℓ→0 →0 →0 .
If we wanted a construction related to proﬁnite completion which
preserved exactness for non-ﬁnitely generated groups, we could sim-
ply make the
Definition 1.5 The formal ℓ-completion of an Abelian group G, ¯Gℓ
is given by
¯Gℓ= G ⊗bZℓ.
Proposition 1.15 The functor G →¯Gℓis exact. It is the unique
functor which agrees with the proﬁnite completion for ﬁnitely gen-
erated groups and commutes with direct limits.
Proof: The ﬁrst part follows since bZℓis torsion free. The second
part follows from
i) any group is the direct limit of its ﬁnitely generated subgroups
ii) tensoring commutes with direct limits.
If ℓis {all primes} then bGℓis called “the proﬁnite completion” of
G and denoted bG. ¯Gℓis the “formal completion” of G and denoted
¯G. Thus ¯G = G ⊗¯Z = G ⊗bZ.
We note here that the proﬁnite completion of G, bG is complete
if we remember its topology. Namely, let { bH} denote the partially

Algebraic Constructions
17
ordered set of open subgroups of bG of ﬁnite index. Then
bG ∗∼= lim
←
{ b
H}
{ bG/ bH} = “continuous completion of bG” .
It sometimes happens however that every subgroup of ﬁnite in-
dex in bG is open. This is true if bG = bZ, in fact for the proﬁnite
completion of any ﬁnitely generated Abelian group. Thus in these
cases the topology of bG can be recovered from the algebra using the
isomorphism ∗.
The topology is essential for example in

Examples from Topology and Algebra
Now we consider some interesting examples of “proﬁnite groups”.
1) Let X be an inﬁnite complex and consider some extraordinary
cohomology theory h∗(X). Suppose that πi(X) is ﬁnite and hi(pt)
is ﬁnitely generated for each i (or vice versa.)
Then for each i, the reduced group ehi(X) is a proﬁnite group.
For example, the reduced K-theory of R P∞is the 2-adic integers.
The proﬁniteness of ehi(X) follows from the formula
ehi(X) ∼=
lim
←
skeleta X
ehi(skeleton X)
and the essential ﬁniteness of ehi(skeleton X).
2) Let K containing k be an inﬁnite Galois ﬁeld extension. K is a
union of ﬁnite Galois extensions of k,
K =
[
∞
L .
Then the Galois group of K over k is the proﬁnite group
Gal (K/k) = lim
←
{L}
Gal (L/k) .

18
Examples
i) Let k be the prime ﬁeld Fp and K = eFp, an algebraic closure of
Fp. Then K is a union of ﬁelds with pn elements, Fpn, n ordered
by divisibility, and
Gal ( eFp, Fp) = lim
←−
n
Gal (Fpn, Fp)
= lim
←−
n
Z/n
= bZ .
Moreover each Galois group has a natural generator, the Frobe-
nius automorphism
Fpn
F
−−−→
x7→xp Fpn .
F is the identity on Fp because of Fermat’s congruence
ap ≡a (mod p) .
Thus the powers of F generate bZ topologically (they are dense.)
The ﬁxed ﬁelds of the powers of the Frobenius are just the various
ﬁnite ﬁelds which ﬁlter eFp.
ii) If k = Q, and K = AQ is obtained by adjoining all roots of unity
to Q, then
Gal (AQ/ Q) = bZ
∗,
the group of units in the ring bZ.
AQ can be described intrinsically as a maximal Abelian extension
of Q, i.e. a maximal element in the partially ordered “set” of
Abelian extensions of Q (Abelian Galois groups.)
The decomposition

integers.

iii) If k = Q and K = eQ, an algebraic closure of Q, then
G = “the Galois group of Q”
= Gal (eQ/ Q)
=
lim
←
Galois number ﬁelds K
Gal (K/ Q)
is a proﬁnite group of great importance.
G has very little torsion, only “complex conjugations”, elements
of order 2. These are all conjugate, and each one commutes with
no element besides itself and the identity. This non-commuting
fact means that our (conjectured) etale 2-adic homotopy type for
real algebraic varieties (Chapter 5) does not have Galois symme-
try in general.
Notice also that in a certain sense G is only deﬁned up to inner
automorphisms (like the fundamental group of a space) but its
proﬁnite Abelianization
G/[G, G]
is canonically deﬁned (like the ﬁrst homology group of a space).
Perhaps this is one reason why there is such a beautiful theory
for determining G/[G, G]. This “class ﬁeld theory for Q” gives a
canonical isomorphism
G/[G, G] ∼= bZ
∗.
We will see in the later Chapters how the bZ
∗-Galois symmetry of
the maximal Abelian extension of Q, “the ﬁeld generated by the
roots of unity” seems to permeate geometric topology – in linear
theory, C∞-theory, and even topological theory.
iv) We will see below that the group of p-adic units is naturally
isomorphic to a (ﬁnite group) direct sum (the additive group),
e.g.
bZ
∗
p ∼= Z/(p −1) ⊕bZp
(p > 2) .
Thus there are non-trivial group homomorphisms
bZ →bZ
∗
e.g. bZp maps non-trivially into bZ
∗
q for q = p, and q ≡1 (mod p).

The p-adic units
Besides these interesting “algebraic occurrences” of proﬁnite groups,
in the p-adic case analytical considerations play a considerable role.
For example, the p-adic analytic functions log and exp can be em-
ployed to prove
Proposition 1.16 There is a “canonical” splitting of the (proﬁnite)
group of units in the p-adic integers
bZ
∗
p ∼= Z/(p −1) ⊕bZp
(p > 2)
bZ

Proof: Consider the case p > 2. Reduction mod p and the equiva-

follow from counting the order of the group of units in the ring
Z/pk Z (which “approximates” bZp.)
These show that the “Teichm¨uller representative”
¯x = x + (xp −x) + (xp2 −xp) + . . .
is a well deﬁned p-adic integer for any x in bZ
∗
p.
However, ¯x is just
¯x = lim
n→∞xpn .
Thus, every point in bZ
∗
p ﬂows to a deﬁnite point upon iteration of
the Frobenius pth power mapping, x 7→xp.
The binomial expansion

shows (a + pb)pn ≡apn (mod pn).
Thus ¯x only depends on the residue class of x modulo p.
So each coset of U ﬂows down over itself to a canonical point.
The (p −1) points constructed this way form a subgroup (compris-
ing as they do the image of the inﬁnite iteration of the Frobenius
endomorphism), and this subgroup maps onto Z/(p −1).
This gives the required splitting T.
Step 2. We construct a canonical isomorphism
U −→
∼
=
bZp .

22
Actually we construct an isomorphism pair
U
l
−→
←−
e
pbZp ⊆bZp .
First,
(1 + u)
l−→log(1 + u) = u −u2/2 + u3/3 −. . .
This series clearly makes sense and converges. If u = pv, the nth
terms un/n make sense for all n and approach zero as n goes to ∞
(which is suﬃcient for convergence in this non-Archimedean situa-
tion.)
The inverse for ℓis constructed by the exponential function
x
e7→ex = 1 + x + x2/2 + · · · + xn/n! + . . .
which is deﬁned for all x in the maximal ideal
pbZp ⊆bZp .
Again one uses the relation x = py to see that xn/n! makes sense for
all n and goes to zero as n approaches inﬁnity. The calculational
point here is that
νp(n!) = ⌊n −ϕp(n)
p −1
⌋
where νp(n) is deﬁned by
n =
Y
p
pνp(n)
and ϕp(n) = the sum of the coeﬃcients in the expansion
n = a0 + a1p + a2p2 + . . .
Since elog x = x, and log ex = x are identities in the formal power
series ring, we obtain an isomorphism U ∼= pbZp. Since bZp is torsion
free pbZp is canonically isomorphic to bZp. This completes the proof
for p > 2. If p = 2 certain modiﬁcations are required.
In step 1, the exact sequence
1 →U →bZ
∗
2
T−→Z/2 →1
comes from “reduction modulo 4” and the equivalence
(Z/4)∗∼= Z/2 .

Algebraic Constructions
23
The natural splitting is obtained by lifting Z/2 = {0, 1} to {±1} ⊆
bZ2. But the exponential map is only deﬁned on the square of the
maximal ideal,
4bZ2
e−→U .
Namely,
ν2(n!) = n −ϕ2(n)
means (2y)n
n!
is deﬁned (and even) for all n but only approaches zero
as required if y is also even.
From these functions we deduce that U is torsion free from the
fact that bZ2 is torsion free.

If we consider mixing these operations in groups, the following
remarks are appropriate.

gives zero,

ℓ′ =



Y
p∈ℓ∩ℓ′
bGp
if ℓ∩ℓ′ ̸= ∅
0
if ℓ∩ℓ′ = ∅.
e.g. (G, l, ℓ′) = (Z , ∅, p) gives bQp = 0.
ii) localizing and then formally completing leads to new objects, e.g.
a) (Z0)¯
p = ¯Qp = Q ⊗bZp, the “ﬁeld of p-adic numbers”, usually
denoted by Qp. Qp is the ﬁeld of quotients of bZp (although it

Algebraic Constructions
27
is not much larger because only 1/p has to be added to bZp to
make it a ﬁeld). Qp is a locally compact metric ﬁeld whose
unit disk is made up of the integers bZp. The power series for
log(1 + x) discussed above converges for x in the interior of
this disk, the maximal ideal pbZp of bZp.
Qp is usually thought of as being constructed from the ﬁeld
of rational numbers by completing with respect to the p-adic
metric. It thus plays a role analogous to the real numbers, R.
b) (Z0)¯ = ¯Q = Q ⊗bZ is the restricted product over all p of the
p-adic numbers. Namely,
Q ⊗bZ = c
Y
p

is the subring of the inﬁnite product consisting of inﬁnite
sequences
(r2, r3, r5, . . . , rp, . . . )
of p-adic numbers where all but ﬁnitely many of the rp are
actually p-adic integers.
Note that Q is contained in ¯Q as the diagonal sequences
n/m →(n/m, n/m, . . . , n/m, . . . ) .
If we combine this embedding with the embedding of Q in the
reals we obtain an embedding
Q ,→¯Q × {real completion of Q}
as a discrete subgroup with a compact quotient.
¯Q×{real completion of Q} is called the ring of Adeles (for Q.)
Adeles can be constructed similarly for general number ﬁelds
and even algebraic groups
¡
e.g. Q (ξ) = Q (x)/(xp −1) and
GL (n, Z).
¢
These Adele groups have natural measures, and the volumes
of the corresponding compact quotients have interesting num-
ber theoretical signiﬁcance. (See “Adeles and Algebraic Groups”
Lectures by Andre Weil, the Institute for Advanced Study,
1961 (Progress in Mathematics 23, Birkh¨auser (1982).)
In the number ﬁeld case the Adeles form a ring. The units
in this ring are called ideles. The ideles are used to construct
Abelian extensions of the number ﬁeld.
(Global and local
class ﬁeld theory.)

Proof: We have to check exactness for

where i and j are the natural inclusions
bZp −−→

Take n ∈Z and q ∈bZp then
(n/pa) + q = (n + paq)/pa
can be an arbitrary p-adic number. Thus i −j is onto.
It is clear that (b) ⊕(0) has zero kernel.
To complete the proof only note that a rational number n/m is
also a p-adic integer when m is not divisible by p. Thus n/m is in Z
localized at p.
Corollary The ring of integers localized at p is the ﬁbre product of
the rational numbers and the ring of p-adic integers over the p-adic
numbers.

Qp is an inﬁnite tuple
a = (r2, r3, r5, . . . )
of p-adic numbers in which all but ﬁnitely many of the components
are integers Op.
If the non-integral component rp equals Op/pα take n to be an
integer in the residue class (mod pα) of Op. Then
a + (n/pα, n/pα, . . . , n/pα, . . . )
has one fewer non-integral component than a. This shows the ﬁnite
Adeles c

As before the proof is completed by observing that a rational
number which is also a p-adic integer for every p must actually be
an integer.
Corollary The ring of integers is the ﬁbre product of the rational
numbers and the inﬁnite product of all the various rings of p-adic
integers over the ring of ﬁnite Adeles.
More generally, for a ﬁnitely generated Abelian group G and a
non-void set of primes ℓthere is a ﬁbre square

Taking ℓto be “all primes” we see that the group G can be recov-
ered from appropriate maps of its localization at zero G ⊗Q and its
proﬁnite completion,
Y

bGp into G⊗“ﬁnite Adeles”. Taking ℓ= {p}
we see that G localized at p can be similarly recovered from its
localization at zero and its p-adic completion.
We will be doing the same thing to spaces in the next two Chap-
ters.
Thus to understand a space X it is possible to break the
problem up into pieces – a proﬁnitely completed space b
X and a ra-
tional space X0. These each map to a common Adele space XA, and
any information about X may be recovered from this picture

Chapter 2
HOMOTOPY THEORETICAL
LOCALIZATION
In this Chapter we deﬁne a localization functor in homotopy the-
ory. There is a cellular construction for simply connected spaces and
a Postnikov construction for “simple spaces”.
At the end of the Chapter we give some (hopefully) enlightening
examples.
We work in the category of “simple spaces” and homotopy classes
of maps. A “simple space” is a connected space having the homotopy
type of a CW complex and an Abelian fundamental group which acts
trivially on the homotopy and homology of the universal covering
space.
Let ℓbe a set of primes in Z which may be empty. ℓwill be ﬁxed
throughout the discussion and all localization will be made with
respect to it.

i.e., π∗Xℓis a Zℓ-module. We say that a map of some space X into
a local space Xℓ

is a localization of X if it is universal for maps of X into local
spaces, i.e., given f there is a unique fℓmaking the diagram

Taking ℓ= identity we get the
Corollary For a “simple space” the following are equivalent
i) X is its own localization
ii) X has local homology
iii) X has local homotopy.
Corollary If X
ℓ−→X′ is a map of local “simple spaces” then
i) ℓis a homotopy equivalence
ii) ℓinduces an isomorphism on local homotopy
iii) ℓinduces an isomorphism of local homology
are equivalent.
Note the case ℓ= all primes. We also note here that a map induces
an isomorphism on local homology iﬀit does on rational homology
and on mod p homology for p ∈ℓ.
The proof of the Theorem is not uninteresting but long so we
defer it to the end of this Chapter.
We go on to our construction of the localization which makes use
of Theorem 2.1.
We begin the cellular construction by localizing the sphere.
Choose a coﬁnal sequence {ℓ′
n} from the multiplicative set of in-
tegers generated by primes not in ℓ.
Choose a map Si ℓ′
n
−→Si of degree ℓ′
n and deﬁne the “local sphere”

and ℓis a localization. This homotopy situation is interesting be-
cause the map induced on homotopy by a degree d map of spheres
is not the obvious one, e.g.
i) S2 d−→S2 induces multiplication by d2 on π3S2 = Z. (H. Hopf)

Definition 2.2 A local CW complex is built inductively from a

35
point or a local 1-sphere by attaching cones over the local sphere
using maps of the local sphere Sℓinto the lower “local skeletons”.
Note: Since we have no local 0-sphere we have no local 1-cell.
Theorem 2.2 If X is a CW complex with one zero cell and no one
cells, there is a local CW complex Xℓand a “cellular” map
X
ℓ−→Xℓ
such that
i) ℓinduces an isomorphism between the cells of X and the local
cells of Xℓ.
ii) ℓlocalizes homology.
Corollary Any simply connected space has a localization.
Proof: Choose a CW decomposition with one zero cell and zero
one cells and consider
X
ℓ−→Xℓ
constructed in Theorem 2.2. By Theorem 2.1 ℓlocalizes homotopy
and is a localization.
Proof of 2.2: The proof is by induction on the dimension. If X
is a 2 complex with X(1) = point, then X is a wedge of 2-spheres
X = W S2. W S2 →W S2
(ℓ) satisﬁes i) and ii), and is a localization.
Assume the Theorem true for all complexes of dimension less than
or equal to n −1. Let X have dimension n. If f : A →Aℓsatisﬁes i),
ii) and is a localization then P f : P A →P Aℓdoes also. We have

cells, since ℓn−1 does. We may now form the ladder

All the spaces on the bottom line except possibly X(ℓ) have local
homology thus by exactness it does also. Since all the vertical maps
localize homology except possibly ℓ, it does also. This completes the
proof for ﬁnite dimensional complexes. If X is inﬁnite take
Xℓ=
∞
[

X(n)
ℓ
.
This clearly satisﬁes i) and ii).
There is a construction dual to the cellular localization using a
Postnikov tower.
Let X be a Postnikov tower

We say that X is a “local Postnikov tower” if Xn is constructed
inductively from a point using ﬁbrations with “local K(π, n)’s”.
(Namely K(π, n)’s with π local.)

Homotopy TheoreticalLocalization
37
Theorem 2.3 If X is any Postnikov tower1 there is a local Post-
nikov tower Xℓand a Postnikov map
X →Xℓ
which localizes homotopy groups and k-invariants.
Proof: We induct over the number of stages in X. Induction starts
easily since the ﬁrst stage is a point. Assume we have a localization
of partial systems
X(n−1) −→
ℓX(n−1)
ℓ
localizing homotopy. Then the k-invariant
k ∈Hn+1¡
X(n−1); πn

may be formally localized to obtain

.
¯kℓdetermines a unique

X(n−1)

satisfying ℓ∗kℓ= ¯kℓ. This follows from remarks in the proof of The-
orem 2.1 and the universal coeﬃcient theorem.
We can use the pair of compatible k-invariants (k, kℓ) to construct
a diagram

where Xn is the ﬁbre of k (by deﬁnition of k), Xn
ℓis deﬁned to be

Proceeding in this way we localize the entire X-tower.
1We need not assume π1 acts trivially on the homology of the universal cover to make this
construction.

Corollary Any “simple space” has a localization.
Proof: Choose a Postnikov tower decomposition for the “simple
space”. Localize the tower by 2.3 to obtain a “simple space” local-
izing the original.
We remark that any two localizations are canonically isomorphic
by universality. Thus we speak of the localization functor.
Proposition 2.4 In the category of “simple spaces” localization pre-
serves ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations.
Proof: We will use the homology and homotopy properties of lo-
calization. Let

Thus (∗) is a commutative ladder. By the Five Lemma gℓ: Fℓ→ﬁber

iℓ−→Eℓ
fℓ

There b ∪C(a) : X ∪f C(A) →Xℓ∪fℓC(Aℓ) is an isomorphism of Zℓ
homology.
To complete the proof we need to show that
Xℓ∪fℓC(Aℓ) = Yℓ
is a “simple space”. Then it will follow from the second corollary to
Theorem 2.1 that the natural map
Xℓ∪fℓC(Aℓ) →(X ∪f CA)ℓ
is an equivalence.
We leave to the reader the task of deciding whether this is so in
case Yℓis not simply connected.
We note here that no extension of the localization functor to the
entire homotopy category can preserve ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations.
For this consider the diagram
S2

The vertical sequence is a ﬁbration and the horizontal sequence is a

we obtain

If coﬁbrations were preserved R P2
ℓshould be a point. If ﬁbrations

ℓshould be S2
ℓ(which is not a point).
It would be interesting to understand what localizations are pos-
sible for more general spaces.2
We collect here some additional remarks and examples pertaining
to localization before giving the proof of Theorem 2.1.
(1) We have used the isomorphism for local spaces X
[Si
ℓ, X]based ∼= πiX .
This is a group isomorphism for i > 1 (since Si
ℓ= ΣSi−1
ℓ
the left
hand side has a natural group structure) and imposes one on the
left for i = 1.
(2) For a local space X,
ΩiX ∼= Mapbased(Si
ℓ, X)
generalizing (1).
(3) The natural map
(ΩiX)ℓ→Ωi(Xℓ)
deﬁned by universality from
ΩiX
Ωiℓ
−−→ΩiXℓ
is an equivalence between the components of the constant map.
(Note ΩiSi has “Z-components” but Ωi(Si
ℓ) has “Zℓ-components”).
Thus
¡
Mapbased(Si, Si)+1
¢
ℓ∼= Mapbased(Si
ℓ, Si
ℓ)+1 .
2See equivariant localization in the proof of Theorem 4.2.

(4) If ℓand ℓ′ are two disjoint sets of primes such that ℓ∪ℓ′ = all
primes, then

(See Proposition 1.12.)
(7) X0 is an H-space iﬀit is equivalent to a product of Eilenberg
MacLane spaces. (See Milnor and Moore, On the structure of
Hopf algebras, Annals of Math. 81, 211–264 (1965)).
(8) X is an H-space if and only if Xp is an H-space for each prime p
with H∗(Xp; Q) isomorphic as rings to H∗(Xq; Q) for all p and q.
(They are always isomorphic as groups.)
Proof: If X is an H-space, let X ×X
µ−→X be the multiplication.
µ induces µp : (X × X)p
µp
−→Xp, and thus Xp × Xp
µp
−→Xp. Thus
each Xp inherits an H-space structure from X.
(Xp)0 inherits
an H-space structure from Xp. (Xp)0 = X0, and if we give X0
the H-space structure from X, this homotopy equivalence is an

42
H-space equivalence. Thus we have the ring isomorphism
H∗
¡
(Xp)0; Q
¢ ∼= H∗(X0; Q)
∼=
H∗(Xp; Q) .
Conversely if Xp is an H-space for each p and H∗(Xp; Q) ∼= H∗(Xq; Q)
as rings then (Xp)0 ≃(Xq)0 as H-spaces, since the H-space struc-
ture on a rational space is determined by its Pontrjagin ring.
Thus we have compatible multiplications in the diagram

This induces an H-space multiplication on the ﬁbered product,
X.
Note: If H∗(X; Q) is 0 for ∗⩾n, some n, then the condition on
the Pontrjagin rings is redundant. This follows since H∗(Xp; Q) =
H∗(Xq; Q) as groups, and both must be exterior algebras on a
ﬁnite set of generators. This implies that they are isomorphic as
rings.
(9) If H is a homotopy commutative H-space then the functor F =
[

(10) If X has classifying space BX, then Xℓhas one BXℓ.

deﬁnes the localization at zero of BSO2n.
(13) H∗(BSO2n−1; Q) ∼= Q [p1, . . . , pn−1].
In fact this is true if Q is
replaced by Z [1/2]. Thus
a) (BSO2n−1)0 ∼=
n−1
Y
i=1
K(Q , 4i)
b) If we localize at odd primes, the natural projection
BSO2n−1 →BSO
has a canonical splitting over the 4n −1 skeleton.
(14) The Thom space MUn is the coﬁber in the sequence
BUn−1 →BUn →MUn ,
thus (MUn)0 is the coﬁber of
n−1
X
i=1
K(Q , 2i) →

K(Q , 2i) →(MUn)0
e.g. (MUn)0 has K(Q , 2n) as a canonical retract.
Geometric Corollary: Every line in H2i(ﬁnite polyhedron; Q)
contains a point which is “naturally” represented as the Thom
class of a subcomplex
V ⊂polyhedron
with a complex normal bundle.
(15) (BU)0 is naturally represented by the direct limit over all n, k
BUn
⊗k
−−→BUkn .
(16) We consider Sn for n > 0.
a) Sn
0 is an H-space iﬀn is odd. In fact S2n−1
0
is the loop space
of K(Q , 2n).
b) S2n−1
2
is an H-space iﬀn = 1, 2, or 4 and a loop space iﬀn = 1
or 2. (J. F. Adams)
c) S2n−1
p
is an H-space for all odd primes p and for all n. S2n−1
p
is a loop space iﬀp is congruent to 1 modulo n. (The ne-
cessity of the congruence is due to Adem, Steenrod, Adams,

44
and Liulevicius. For the suﬃciency see Chapter 4, “Principal
Spherical Fibrations”.)
Thus each sphere S2n−1 is a loop space at inﬁnitely many
primes, for example S7 at primes of the form 4k + 1.
But at each prime p only ﬁnitely many spheres are loop spaces
– one for each divisor of p−1 if p > 2 (or in general one for each
ﬁnite subgroup of the group of units in the p-adic integers.)

then
i) If all spaces are connected, have π1 Abelian and two of the maps
f, g, and h localize homotopy then the third does also.
ii) If the fundamental groups act trivially on the homology of the
ﬁbres and two of the maps f, g, and h localize homology the third
does also.
The proof of i) follows immediately from the exact ladder of ho-
motopy as in Proposition 1.7.
The proof of ii) has two points. First, by Proposition 1.8 if two
of the homologies
eH∗F ′ ,
eH∗E′ ,
eH∗B′
are local the third is also. Second, if we know the homologies on the
right are local then to complete the proof of ii) it is equivalent to
check that f, g, h induce isomorphisms on
eH∗(
; Zℓ)

Homotopy TheoreticalLocalization
47
since e.g.
eH∗(F ′) ∼= eH∗(F ′) ⊗Zℓ∼= H∗(F ′; Zℓ) .
But this last point is clear since if two of f, g, h induce isomor-
phisms on H∗(
; Zℓ) the third does also by the spectral sequence
comparison Theorem. With these remarks in mind it is easy now to
see that a map of simple spaces
X
ℓ−→X′
localizes homotopy iﬀit localizes homology.
Step 1. The case
(X
ℓ−→X′) =
¡
K(π, 1) ℓ−→K(π′, 1)
¢
.
If ℓlocalizes homology, then it localizes homotopy since π = H1X,
π′ = H1X′. If ℓlocalizes homotopy then
(π →π′) = (π →πℓ) .
So ℓlocalizes homology if
i) π = Z. ℓis just the localization
S1 →S1
ℓ
studied above.
ii)
π = Z/pn for πℓ= 0 if p /∈ℓ
πℓ= Z/pn if p ∈ℓ.
For general π, take ﬁnite direct sums and then direct limits of the
ﬁrst two cases.
Step 2. The case
(X
ℓ−→X′) =
¡
K(π, n) ℓ−→K(π′, n)
¢
.
If ℓlocalizes homology, then it localizes homotopy as in Step 1
because π = HnX, π′ = HnX′.
If ℓlocalizes homotopy, then we use induction, Step 1, diagram
III in remark b) and remark c) to see that ℓlocalizes homology.

48
Step 3. The general case X
ℓ−→X′.
If ℓlocalizes homology, apply the Hurewicz theorem for n = 1 to
see that ℓlocalizes π1. Then use Step 1, diagram II in remark a) for
n = 1 and remark c) to see that
X2
ℓ2
−→X′
2
localizes homology. We apply Hurewicz here to see that ℓ2 and thus
ℓlocalizes π2. Now use Step 2 for n = 2, diagram II for n = 2 and
remark c) to proceed inductively and ﬁnd that ℓlocalizes homotopy
in all dimensions.
If ℓlocalizes homotopy then apply Step 2 and diagram I induc-
tively to see that each
Xn ℓn
−→(X′)n
localizes homology for all n. Then
ℓ= lim
←ℓn
localizes homology.
Now we show that i) and ii) are equivalent.
If X
ℓ−→X′ is universal for maps into local spaces Y , then by
taking Y to be various K(π, n)’s with π local we see that ℓinduces
an isomorphism of H∗(
; Q) and H∗(
; Z/p), p ∈ℓ. Thus ℓinduces
homomorphisms of
H∗(
; Q) and H∗(
; Z/p), p ∈ℓ
which must be isomorphisms because their dual morphisms are. Us-
ing the Bockstein sequence
· · · →Hi(
; Z/pn) →Hi(
; Z/pn+1) →Hi(
; Z/pn) →. . .
and induction we see that ℓinduces an isomorphism on H∗(
; Z/pn)
for all n.
Thus ℓinduces an isomorphism on H∗(
; Z/p∞) since
taking homology and tensoring commute with direct limits, and
Z/p∞= lim
−→
n
Z/pn, p ∈ℓ.
Finally ℓinduces an isomorphism of H∗(
; Zℓ) using the coeﬃcient
sequence
0 →Zℓ→Q →Q / Zℓ→0

Homotopy TheoreticalLocalization
49
and the equivalence
Q / Zℓ=
M
p∈ℓ
Z/p∞.
Now X′ is a local space by deﬁnition. Thus the homology of X′
is local by what we proved above. This proves i) implies ii).
To see that ii) implies i) consider the obstruction to uniquely

These lie in

we see that ℓinduces an isomorphism of Zℓ-cohomology. By uni-
versal coeﬃcients (over Zℓ) the obstruction groups all vanish. Thus
there is a unique extension fℓ, and ℓis a localization.


Chapter 3
COMPLETIONS IN HOMOTOPY THEORY
In this Chapter we extend the completion constructions for groups
to homotopy theory.
In spirit we follow Artin and Mazur1, who ﬁrst conceived of the
proﬁnite completion of a homotopy type as an inverse system of
homotopy types with ﬁnite homotopy groups.
We “complete” the Artin-Mazur object to obtain an actual ho-
motopy type b
X for each connected CW complex X. This proﬁnite
completion b
X has the additional structure of a natural compact
topology on the functor, homotopy classes of maps into b
X,
[
, b
X] .
The compact open topology on the functor [
, b
X] allows us to
make inverse limit constructions in homotopy theory which are nor-
mally impossible.
Also under ﬁnite type assumptions on X (or b
X) this topology is
intrinsic to the homotopy type of b
X. Thus it may be suppressed or
resurrected according to the whim of the moment.
A formal completion ¯X is constructed for countable complexes.
¯X is a CW complex with a partial topology on the functor
[
, ¯X] .
1Etale homotopy theory, Springer Lecture Notes 100 (1969).

52
We apply the formal completion to rational homotopy types where
proﬁnite completion gives only contractible spaces.
In this case, an essential ingredient in the extra topological struc-
ture on the functor [
, ¯X] is a bZ-module structure on the homotopy
groups of ¯X. This bZ-structure allows one to treat these groups which
are enormous Q-vector spaces.
These completion constructions and the localization of Chapter 2
are employed to fracture a classical homotopy type into one rational
and inﬁnitely many p-adic pieces.
We discuss the reassembly of the classical homotopy types from
these pieces using an Adele type and a homotopy analogue of the
“arithmetic square” of Chapter 1.
Construction of the Proﬁnite Completion b
X
We outline the construction.
We begin with the following observation. Let F denote a space
with ﬁnite homotopy groups. Then the functor deﬁned by F,
[
, F]
may be topologized in a natural way. This (compact) topology arises
from the equivalence
[Y, F]
∼
=
−→
lim
←
ﬁnite subcomplexes Yα
[Yα, F]
and is characterized by the separation property – Hausdorﬀ.
Now given X consider the category {f} of all maps
X
f−→F , πiF ﬁnite .
This category is suitable for forming inverse limits and a functor b
X
is deﬁned by
b
X(Y ) = lim
←
{f}
[Y, F] . 2
2{f} depends on X.

Completions in Homotopy Theory
53
The compact open topology on the right implies that the Brown
requirements for the representability of b
X hold.
Thus we have a well deﬁned underlying homotopy type for the
proﬁnite completion
b
X together with a topology on the functor
[
, b
X].
Note: The essential nature of this compactness for forming inverse
limits is easily illustrated by an example – let L denote the inverse
limit of the representable functor
[
, S2]
using the self map induced by
S2 degree 3
−−−−−→S2 .
It is easy to check
L(S1) ∼= L(S2) ∼= ∗, but
L(R P2) has two elements .
Thus L is not equivalent to [
, B] for any space B.
We, perhaps prematurely, make the

The following paragraphs discuss and justify this deﬁnition.
Proposition 3.1 If F has ﬁnite homotopy groups, [
, F] may be
naturally regarded as a functor into the topological category of com-
pact Hausdorﬀtotally disconnected spaces.
A homotopy class of maps F →F ′ induces a continuous natural
transformation of functors
[
, F] →[
, F ′]
Proof: The proof is based on two assertions:
i) for each ﬁnite complex Yα,
[Yα, F] is a ﬁnite set .
ii) for an arbitrary complex Y the natural map
[Y, F] restriction
−−−−−−−→
lim
←
Yα a ﬁnite
subcomplex of Y
[Yα, F]
is a bijection of sets.
i) and ii) will be proved in the note below. Together they imply
that [Y, F] is naturally isomorphic to an inverse limit of ﬁnite dis-
crete topological spaces. But from general topology we know that
such “proﬁnite spaces” are characterized by the properties compact,
Hausdorﬀ, and totally disconnected.
A homotopy class of maps Y ′
f−→Y induces a continuous map of
proﬁnite spaces
[Y, F] →[Y ′, F] .
A cellular representative of f induces a map of directed sets

and thus a map (the other way) of inverse systems.
Similarly F

Corollary The full subcategory of the homotopy category deter-
mined by homotopy types with ﬁnite homotopy groups is canonically
isomorphic to a category of functors from the homotopy category to
the category of compact Hausdorﬀspaces,
F ↔[
, F] .
Each space X determines a subcategory of this category of “com-
pact representable functors”.
First consider the category {f}, where
i) an object of {f} is a (based) homotopy class of maps
X
f−→F ,
where F has ﬁnite homotopy groups.
ii) a morphism in {f}, f′ →f, is a homotopy commutative diagram

If h′ is the point map, C(h, h′) is just the ﬁbre of h (after h is
made into a ﬁbration). In general C(h, h′) may be described as
the space mapping into F ′ which classiﬁes (equivalence classes
of) a map g into F ′ together with a homotopy between h ◦g and
h′ ◦g in F. (This is easily seen to be a representable functor in
the sense of Brown.)
Or, more explicitly C(h, h′) may be described as a certain subset
of the product (paths in F) × F ′, namely,
C(h, h′) = {P ∈F I, x ∈F ′ | P(0) = h(x), P(1) = h′(x)} .
As in the ﬁbre case there is an exact sequence of homotopy groups

From the exact sequence we see that X →F ′′ is in the category
{f}
¡
F ′′ = C(h, h′) has ﬁnite homotopy groups.
¢
We ﬁnd ourselves in the following situation –
i) for each space X we have by Proposition 3.2 a good indexing
category {X →F} = {f}. (We also assume the objects in {f}
form a set by choosing one representative from each homotopy
type with ﬁnite homotopy groups.)
ii) we have a functor from the indexing category {f} to the cat-
egory of “compact representable functors”
f →[
, F] .
This should motivate
Proposition 3.3 We can form the inverse limit of compact repre-
sentable functors Fα indexed by a good indexing category {α}. The
inverse limit
lim
←−
α
Fα
is a compact representable functor.
Proof: The analysis of our limit is made easier by considering for
each Y and α, the “inﬁnite image”,
Iα(Y ) = intersection
over all
α →β
{image Fβ(Y ) →Fα(Y )} .
One can use the directedness and eventual uniqueness in {α} to
see that all the morphisms from α to β
α →
→
→β

58
induce one and the same morphism
Iβ(Y )
αβ
−−→Iα(Y ) .
For example, equalize α →
→β by α →
→β →γ, then
Fγ(Y ) →Fβ(Y ) →
→Fα(Y )
coequalizes
Fβ(Y ) →
→Fα
but Iβ(Y ) is contained in the image of Fγ(Y ).
Thus all maps of
Fβ(Y ) into Fα(Y ) agree on Iβ(Y ).
To see that this unique map
Iβ(Y ) →Fα(Y )
has image contained in Iα(Y ) use the strong form of directedness of
{α} – if
Fγ(Y ) →Fα(Y )
is an arbitrary map into Fα(Y ), dominate β and γ by δ′, then equalize
the compositions by δ

Any point in Iβ(Y ) is contained in the image of Fδ(Y ). By com-

Iβ(Y )
αβ
−−→Iα(Y ) .
It is clear that the inverse limit lim

Fα can be taken to be the
ordinary inverse limit lim
←Iα over {α} with morphisms
α →

→β collapsed to α
αβ
−−→β .
Moreover, Iα(Y ) is clearly compact Hausdorﬀand non-void if all
the Fβ(Y ) are.
¡
To see that Iα(Y ) is non-void an argument like the
above is used to check the ﬁnite intersection property for the images
of the Fβ(Y )’s.
¢
Of course, Fα(Y ) always contains the constant map so
Y
lim
←−
α
Fα
−−−−→lim

Fα(Y )
assigns to each space Y a non-void compact Hausdorﬀspace. (Here
we use the fundamental fact (∗∗), the inverse limit of non-void com-
pact Hausdorﬀspaces is a non-void compact Hausdorﬀspace.)
To see that
G = lim
←−
α
Fα
is representable we need to check the Brown axioms –
i) the exponential law
ii) the Mayer Vietoris property.
The ﬁrst property requires the natural map
G
¡ _
β
Yβ
¢
→
Y
β
G(Yβ)
to be an isomorphism. But this is clear since inverse limits commute
with arbitrary products.
The second property is more subtle and usually the one that fails.
If Y = A ∪B, Z = A ∩B (all complexes are subcomplexes), and

60
we are given elements in G(A) and G(B) which restrict to the same
element in G(Z), then there should be at least one element in G(Y )
restricting to these elements in G(A) and G(B).
Now this is true at each index α since Fα is a representable functor.
Moreover, the set of solutions is clearly a compact subset of Fα(A ∪
B).
Fundamental fact (∗∗) then insures that the inverse limit of
these compact solution spaces will be non-void. Thus lim
←F = G has
the Mayer Vietoris property.
It is now easy to construct for such a functor as lim
←F (universally
deﬁned and satisfying i) and ii) universally) a representing CW com-
plex X
lim
←−
α
Fα ∼= [
, X] .
(See for example, Spanier, Algebraic Topology.)
Note: We left two points open in Proposition 3.1.
First if Y is ﬁnite and πiF is ﬁnite for each i, then
[Y, F] is ﬁnite .
This is proved by an easy ﬁnite induction over the cells of Y . One
only has to recall that the set of homotopy classes of extensions of a
map into F over the domain of the map with an i-cell adjoined has
cardinality no larger than that of πiF.
The second point was the isomorphism
[Y, F]
∼
=
−→
r lim
←
{α}
[Yα, F] ,
{α} the directed set of ﬁnite subcomplexes of Y .
Step 1. r is onto for all Y and F. Let x be an element of the inverse
limit. Let β denote any subdirected set of {α} for which there is a
map
Yβ =
[
α∈β
Yα
xβ
−→F
representing x/β. The set of such β’s is partially ordered by inclu-
sion and the requirement of compatibility up to homotopy of xβ.
Any linearly ordered subset of the β’s is countable because this is
true for {α}. We can construct a map on the inﬁnite mapping tele-
scope of the Yβ’s in any linear chain to see that the partially ordered

Completions in Homotopy Theory
61
set of β’s has an maximal element (by Zorn’s Lemma). This max-
imal element must be all of {α} because we can always adjoin any
ﬁnite subcomplex to the domain of any xβ by a simple homotopy
adjunction argument.
Step 2. r is injective if πiF is ﬁnite. Let f and g be two maps which
determine the same element of the inverse limit. Then f and g are
homotopic on every ﬁnite subcomplex Yα. Since πiF is ﬁnite there
are only ﬁnitely many homotopy classes of homotopies between f
and g restricted to Yα. These homotopy classes of homotopies be-
tween f and g form an inverse system
¡
over {α}
¢
of ﬁnite sets. The
inverse limit is then non-void (by compactness, again).
Now we
repeat step 1 to see that such an inverse limit homotopy can be re-
alized to give an actual homotopy between f and g.
Some properties of the proﬁnite completion
We study the homotopy and cohomology of the proﬁnite comple-
tion b
X.
Proposition 3.4 If X is (k −1) connected, then
πk b
X ∼= (πkX)ˆ, as topological groups .
Proof: By deﬁnition of b
X
πk b
X = lim
←
{f}
πkF .
Every ﬁnite quotient
πkX
r−→π
occurs in this inverse system, namely
X −−−−−−−−−−→
1st k-invariant K(πkX, k) r−→K(π, k) .
A covering space argument for k = 1 and an obstruction theory
argument for k > 1 shows the full subcategory of {f} where F is
(k −1) connected and πkX
f−→πkF is onto and coﬁnal. This proves
the proposition.
Before considering the relation between the higher homotopy of
X and b
X, we must ﬁrst consider cohomology.

On the other hand, if x ∈
Hi( b

commutativity in (I) to the identity map of b

The element in L determined by x′ has the same restriction to Xα
as x. So for each ﬁnite subcomplex of b
X, L and C restrict to the
same subgroup of Hi(Xα; Z /n).
Thus C cannot be larger than (L closure) = L′. Any point outside
L′ is separated from L′ in one of the ﬁnite quotients Hi(Xα; Z /n)
Lemma 3.7 Suppose X has “countable type”,
Hom (π1X; ﬁnite group)
and
Hi(X; Z /n)
are countable. Then b
X is a simple inverse limit

Let F(n) denote the “coskeleton of F” obtained by attach-

The collection of such homotopy types is countable. The homo-

Under our assumption the homotopy set [X, F(n)] is countable.
Thus X has an inverse limit over an indexing category C which
has countably many objects and ﬁnitely many maps between any
two of them.

One can now choose a linearly ordered coﬁnal subcategory

Now we can give a more precise interpretation of the topology on

Suppose the maps in the above sequence

applying the path construction.)
Let F∞denote the inverse limit space. F∞has a natural topology

by the compact open topology on the function space. A set of ho-
motopy classes is open iﬀthe set of all representatives is an open
set in the function space.
Proposition 3.8 If X has countable type the topological functors
[

X] and [
, F∞] are homeomorphic.
Proof: The natural map
[

For the topologies consider ﬁrst the case when F∞= X = b
X = F

that the “inverse limit” and “compact open” topologies on [Y, F]
agree.3
It follows that the natural bijection
[
, F∞] →[
, b
X]
is continuous.
The openness follows from the ﬁbration property.
QED.
Since F∞and b
X have the same weak homotopy type they have the
same singular homology and cohomology. Also the set of singular
simplices of F∞is just the inverse limit of the sets of singular sim-
plices of the Fi. It seems that it is an unsolved problem to use this
precise information to relate the singular cohomology of the inverse
limit F∞and the limit cohomology of the Fi.
To continue to study the cohomology and homotopy of b
X we must
take a new tack and place more restrictions on X.
3This uses two basic facts about CW complexes
i) the ﬁnite subcomplexes are coﬁnal in the lattice of compact subspaces of a CW complex
ii) the “compact open” topology on [ﬁnite complex, CW complex] is discrete.

Theorem 3.9 If X is simply connected4 and its homotopy groups

iv) any map of X into a space with proﬁnite homotopy groups ex-
tends uniquely to b

v) X →b

Note: part ii) of the Theorem has the corollary
eK(Y )ˆ ∼= [Y, BUˆ] ,
for Y a ﬁnite complex. This is proved by induction over the cells of Y
using ii), the Puppe sequence, and the fact that proﬁnite completion
is exact for ﬁnitely generated groups.
The proof of Theorem 3.9 is based on the following.
Lemma 3.10 Suppose X is a simple space with ﬁnitely generated
homotopy groups.
Then there is a map X →Y and an inverse
system of spaces with ﬁnite homotopy groups {Fi} so that
i) πiY ∼= (πiX)ˆ
ii) Y ∼= lim
←Fi
4The simply connected hypothesis may be replaced by π1X is “good” for example π1X
is ﬁnite or π1X is ﬁnitely generated Abelian.
Then a form of Lemma 3.10 with twisted
coeﬃcients may be proved using twisted k-invariants. See remark below for the ﬁrst step.

68
iii) H∗(X, Z /n) ∼= H∗(Y, Z /n) ∼= lim
→H∗(Fi, Z /n) .
Proof:
Step 1: The case X = S1. Let X →Y be the natural map K(Z , 1) →
K(bZ, 1). Let {Fi} be the inverse system
©
K(Z /i, 1)
ª
. Then i) and
ii) are clear. The ﬁrst equivalence of iii) holds because
K(Z , 1) →K(bZ, 1) →K(bZ/ Z , 1)
is a ﬁbration and bZ/ Z is a vector space over Q. The second equiva-
lence of iii) follows from the ﬁrst by calculating
lim
→H∗¡
K(Z /i, 1), Z /n
¢ ∼= H∗(S1, Z /n) .
Step 2: The case X = K(G, n), G any ﬁnitely generated Abelian
group. Take Y = K( bG, n) and {Fi} to be
©
K(G⊗Z /i, 1)
ª
. The above
argument commutes with ﬁnite products to take care of n = 1, the
case G = Z /r being trivial. The case n > 1 is reduced to n = 1 as
usual using the ﬁbration
K(π, n −1) →∗→K(π, n) .
The ﬁrst equivalence of iii) follows by comparing the spectral se-
quences of the ﬁbrations
K(G, n −1)
²
/ K( bG, n −1)
²
Path space
²
/ Path space
²
K(G, n)
/ K( bG, n)
.
The second equivalence of iii) follows by studying the map be-
tween the mod p cohomology spectral sequence for K( bG, n −1) →
∗→K( bG, n) and the direct limit of the corresponding sequences for
K(G ⊗Z /i, n −1) →∗→K(G ⊗Z /i, n) .
Since taking homology commutes with direct limits we can generate
a direct limit spectral sequence.
Since the cohomology groups in

Completions in Homotopy Theory
69
question are all ﬁnite in each degree the E2 term of the limit sequence
is the appropriate tensor product. The comparison then proceeds
as usual.
Step 3: Suppose i), ii) and iii) hold for n-stage Postnikov systems and
consider the case when Xn+1 is an (n + 1)-stage Postnikov system.
We have the ﬁbration
Xn+1 →Xn
k−→K(π, n + 2)
where Xn is the n-stage of Xn+1 and π is πn+1(Xn+1).
We also
have by induction the map Xn →Yn and the inverse system {Fi}
satisfying i), ii) and iii).
Using iii) we can distribute the various reductions mod r of the
k-invariant in Xn among the Fi to construct maps of ﬁbrations

²

²
/ Fir

²

mod r
/ K(π ⊗Z /r, n + 2)
which are compatible over r.
Then we consider the {Eir} and Yn+1 = lim
←Eir. We have a map
Xn+1 →Yn+1, namely lim fr. ii) holds by construction.
We have the map of sequences
Xn+1
²
/ Xn+1
²
Xn
²
/ Yn
²
K(π, n + 2)
/ K(bπ, n + 2) .
The sequence on the right is a ﬁbration because its homotopy se-
quence is the inverse limit of exact sequences of ﬁnite groups and
therefore exact.
i) clearly holds.

70
The equivalence of iii) then follows from step 2 by the spectral
sequence and limit spectral sequence arguments used there.
Step 4: General case. X is the inverse limit of its n-stages Xn. Let
{Fi} be the union inverse system of spaces constructed inductively
above. Let Y be the inverse limit of these (or of the Yn). By the
skeletal convergence of homotopy and cohomology i) and iii) follow
from step 3.
Proof of Theorem 3.9. Let us consider deﬁning the proﬁnite com-
pletion of X by considering maps into simply connected spaces with
only ﬁnitely many non-zero (ﬁnite) homotopy groups. Thus we have
a general inverse system {Ei}, a map X →{Ei} and b
X = lim
←Ei. We
can assume the {Fi} in the Lemma form a subsystem.
Since H∗(X, Z /n) ∼lim
→H∗(Fi, Z /n) each map X →Ei factors
in an eventually unique manner through some Fj by elementary
obstruction theory.
Thus
b
X ≃lim
←Ei ≃lim
←Fi ≃Y
and i) and ii) of the Theorem are proved.
The second part of iii) follows from i) since K(A, n) ∼lim
←K(Ai, n)
if A is the proﬁnite group lim
←Ai, Ai ﬁnite.
The ﬁrst part of iii) is analogous to the remark about Eilenberg-
Moore spaces or follows by direct calculation.
iv) follows by a covering space argument, obstruction theory, and
i).
iv) shows (| b
X|)ˆ and b
X are deﬁned by the same inverse system of
simply connected spaces. This proves vi).
Now consider v). If we have X
f−→Y and Y has proﬁnite homotopy
groups, there is a canonical extension b

If f satisﬁes ii) then bf must induce an isomorphism of homotopy
groups.
If f satisﬁes i), then

is isomorphic to H2X →H2Y which is proﬁnite completion by
Lemma 3.11 below. If we pass to the 2-connective of f we are in the
same situation by a spectral sequence argument. And so on. QED.
Lemma 3.11 Suppose π c−→π′ is a homomorphism of Abelian groups
such that
i) c ⊗Z /n is an isomorphism of ﬁnite groups
ii) π′ is an inverse limit of ﬁnite groups.
Then π′ ≃bπ and c is proﬁnite completion.
Proof: Note that G ⊗Z /n ﬁnite implies
bG ≃lim
←−
n
(G ⊗Z /n) .
Thus c induces an isomorphism of proﬁnite completions,
bπ = lim(π ⊗Z /n)
lim
←c ⊗Z /n
−−−−−−−−−→lim(π′ ⊗Z /n) = bπ′ .
It suﬃces to prove that bπ′ ≃π′.

Fα .
Now π′ ·n
−→π′ is continuous since
lim

Thus the image nπ′ is compact and closed.
The quotient
π′/nπ′ = π′ ⊗Z /n
is ﬁnite. So nπ′ is also open.
Thus, the natural map
π′
ℓ−→lim
←−(π′ ⊗Z /n) = bπ′

72
is continuous.
ℓis onto by the usual compactness argument. But
π′ →bπ′
is always a monomorphism for any proﬁnite group π′. This proves
the Lemma.
Note: Finally we make a remark5 that is useful for non-simply con-
nected examples.
We can normalize the inverse system for deﬁning b
X so that each
map X →Fi is surjective on π1 and πjFi is zero above some point.
Then any local system of ﬁnite groups deﬁned on X is eventually
deﬁned on any subsystem {Ej} ,→{Fi} when
(π1X)ˆ ∼lim
←π1Ej .
Suppose that
H∗(X; M) ∼lim
→H∗(Ej; M)
for all such twisted coeﬃcients M. Then obstruction theory shows
that {Ej} is coﬁnal in {Fi} so
b
X ∼lim
←Ej .

i) If G is ﬁnitely generated and Abelian then
K(G, n)ˆ ∼K( bG, n) ∼K(G ⊗bZ, n) .
ii) If π∗X is ﬁnite, X ∼b
X.
iii) bSn is not the Moore space M(bZ, n). bSn has rational homology in
inﬁnitely many dimensions (A. Bousﬁeld).
iv) K(Q / Z , 1)ˆ ∼(C P∞)ˆ ∼K(bZ, 2).

v) If X = BO2, the classifying space for the orthogonal group of
degree 2, then b
X is the total space of the natural non-orientable
ﬁbration with base K(Z /2, 1) and ﬁbre K(bZ, 2). We will see below
that the completion of X at odd primes is completely diﬀerent.
vi) A recent striking observation6 in homotopy theory implies proﬁ-
nite completion K(S∞, 1) ∼F0 where S∞= lim

metric group of degree n and F0 = lim

function space of degree zero maps of Sn to itself under suspen-
sion.
A map K(S∞, 1) →F0 is deﬁned by converting a ﬁnite cover over
X into a framed subspace of X × Rn and applying the Pontrjagin
construction.
Now F0 has ﬁnite homotopy groups, π1F0 = πn+1Sn = Z /2, and
π1Sˆ∞is Z /2 because of the simplicity of the alternating groups
An, n > 4. The map K(S∞, 1) →F0 induces an isomorphism of
ﬁnite cohomology.
vii) Suppose X has the homotopy type of a complex algebraic variety
V . Then under mild assumptions on X ˇCech-like nerves of alge-
braic (etale) coverings of X give simplicial complexes with ﬁnite
homotopy groups approximating the cohomology of b
X. (Lubkin,

the inﬁnite mapping telescope of the ℓ-proﬁnite completions of the

Note that ¯Xn is a CW complex and the functor

Proposition 3.17 The homotopy type of ¯Xℓand the partial topology
on
[
, ¯Xℓ]
only depend on the homotopy type of X.
Proof: If {Xj} is another ﬁltering of X by ﬁnite subcomplexes, we
can ﬁnd systems of maps
Xi →Xj(i)
Xj →Xi(j)
because the CW topology on X forces any map of a compact space
into X to be inside Xi (Xj) for some i (for some j). The compositions
Xj →Xi(j) →Xj(i(j))
Xi →Xj(i) →Xi(j(i))
are the given inclusions. So the induced maps

the proposition.
9See proof of Proposition 3.17.

78
A similar argument using cellular maps shows that a ﬁltering on
a homotopy equivalent space X′ leads to the same result.
In fact, the formal completion is a functorial construction on the
homotopy category.
The homotopy groups of ¯Xℓare direct limits of proﬁnite groups.
The maps in the direct system are continuous and bZℓ-module ho-
momorphisms.
So πi ¯Xℓis a topological group and a bZℓ-module.
Similarly πiX ⊗bZℓis a bZℓ-module and a topological group.
The
topology is the direct limit topology

Proposition 3.18 If X is simply connected, there is a natural iso-

In particular, the homotopy group are topological groups and bZ-

Then there is a natural homotopy equivalence between

Thus (X0)−is a localization at zero for b
X with the correct bZ-
module structure on its homotopy groups. It follows that it has the
correct (bZ ⊗Q)-module structure.
Definition Let ( b

type of X”. The homotopy groups of XA have the structure of mod-
ules over the ring of “ﬁnite Adeles”,
A = Q ⊗bZ .

Corollary 3.21 X is determined by its rational type X0, its proﬁ-
nite completion b
X, and the equivalence
(X0)−∼=e ( b
X)0
(≡“Adele type of X) .
e is a bZ-module isomorphism of homotopy groups. The triple
(Y0, bY , f)

In this description of the homotopy type of X one should keep in
mind the splitting of spaces
b
X =
Y
p
b
Xp
(product of compact representable functors) and maps
v =
Y
p
bvp .
Then one can see how geometric spaces X are built from inﬁ-
nitely many p-adic pieces and one rational piece.
The ﬁtting to-
gether problem is a purely rational homotopy question – with the
extra algebraic ingredient of proﬁnite module structures on certain
homotopy groups.
In this pursuit we note the analogue of the construction of Adele
spaces in Weil, Adeles and Algebraic Groups (Progress in Mathe-
matics 23, Birkh¨auser, 1982).
Let S be any ﬁnite set of primes. Form

The second factor is (as usual) constructed using the natural com-
pact topology on the functors [

The {XS} form a directed system and

Completions in Homotopy Theory
85
Note: In summary, we apply this discussion to the problem of ex-
pressing a simply connected space Y – whose homotopy groups are
ﬁnitely generated bZ-modules – as the proﬁnite completion of some
geometric complex X,
Y ∼= b
X .
We take Y and form its localization at zero. To do this we could
make the direct limit construction using the individual p-adic com-
ponents of Y as in Proposition 3.22 (using Y ∼= bY ∼=
Y
p
bYp). This
gives the “Adele type”, XA, of X if it exists.
XA is a rational space – its homotopy groups are Q-vector spaces
(of uncountable dimension). However, these homotopy groups are
also bZ-modules. The problem of ﬁnding X then reduces to a problem
in rational homotopy theory – ﬁnd an appropriate “embedding” of
a rational space (with ﬁnitely dimensional homotopy groups) into
XA. Namely, a map
X0
c−→XA
so that
πiX0 ⊗bZ →
∼=
πiXA ,
as bZ-modules.
Then the desired X is the induced “ﬁbre product”
X
²
/ Y
l
²

/ XA
For example, in the case of a complex algebraic variety X we see
what is required to recover the homotopy type of X from the etale
homotopy type of X ∼b
X.
We have to ﬁnd an “appropriate embedding” of the rational type
of X into the localized etale type
X0 →( b
X)0 .
Note: It is easy to see that any simply connected space Y whose
homotopy groups are ﬁnitely generated Q-modules is the localization
of some geometric space X,
Y ∼= X0 .

86
One proceeds inductively over a local cell complex for Y = S Yn –
Sk
0
a−→Yn−1, Yn = Yn−1/Sk
0 = coﬁbre a .
If Xn−1 is constructed so that
(Xn−1)0 ∼= Yn−1 , Xn−1 geometric
we can ﬁnd a′ so that
Sk

²
a′ / Xn−1

Sk

a / Yn−1
commutes, for some choice of the localization Sk →Sk

In fact
choose one localization of Sk, then the homotopy element
Sk
l−→Sk
0
a−→Yn−1
may be written (1/m) · a′, where a′ is in the lattice
image (πkXn−1 →πkYn−1) .
Then a′ works for the new localization
Sk →Sk
0
m

∼

and Xn = Xn−1/Sk ∼= coﬁbre a′ satisﬁes
(Xn)0 ∼= Yn .
This argument also works for localization at some set of primes ℓ.
It would be interesting to analyze the obstructions for carrying
out this argument in the proﬁnite case.

at ℓ”.
The square of groups

ℓ.
The above discussion holds without essential change.
If ℓ= {p}, the square becomes
Xp

Xp
²
X0
/ XQp ,
where
XQp = ( b
Xp)0 = (X0)−
p
is the form of X over the p-adic numbers – the p-adic completion
of Q.
One is led to ask what XR should be where R is the real numbers
– the real completion of Q, and how it ﬁts into this scheme.
For example, the “ﬁnite Adele type” XA should be augmented to
“the complete Adele type”
XA × XR .

88
Then the ﬁbre of the natural map
X0 →XA × XR
has compact homotopy groups and this map might be better under-
stood.
If ℓis the complement of {p}, then spaces of the form b
Xℓcan be
constructed algebraically from algebraic varieties in characteristic

Chapter 4
SPHERICAL FIBRATIONS
We will discuss the theory of ﬁbrewise homotopy classes of ﬁbra-
tions where the ﬁbres are l-local or l-adic spheres. These theories
are interrelated according to the scheme of the arithmetic square
and have interesting symmetry.
Definition. A Hurewicz ﬁbration1
ξ : S →E →B
where the ﬁbre is the local sphere Sn−1
l
, n > 1, is called a local
spherical ﬁbration. The local ﬁbration is oriented if there is given
a class in
Uξ ∈Hn(E →B; Zl)2
which generates
Hn(Sn−1
l
→∗; Zl) ∼= Zl
upon restriction.
When l is the set of all primes the theory is more or less familiar,
i) the set of ﬁberwise homotopy equivalence classes of Sn−1 ﬁbra-
tions over X is classiﬁed by a homotopy set
[X, BGn] .
1E →B has the homotopy lifting property for maps of spaces into B.
2Hn(E →B) means Hn of the pair (mapping cylinder of E →B , E).
89

90
ii) BGn is the classifying space of the associative H-space (compo-
sition)
Gn = {Sn−1 f−→Sn−1 | deg f ∈{±1} = Z∗}
that is, ΩBGn ∼= Gn as inﬁnitely homotopy associative H-spaces.
(Stasheﬀ, Topology 1963, A Classiﬁcation Theorem for Fibre
Spaces.)
iii) the oriented theory3 is classiﬁed by the homotopy set
[X, BSGn]
where BSGn may be described in two equivalent ways
a) BSGn is the classifying space for the component of the iden-
tity map of Sn−1 in Gn, usually denoted SGn.
b) BSGn is the universal cover of BGn, where π1BGn = Z/2.
iv) the involution on the oriented theory obtained by changing ori-
entation
ξ →−ξ
corresponds to the covering transformation of BSGn.
v) there are natural inclusions Gn →Gn+1, BGn →BGn+1, corre-
sponding to the operation of suspending each ﬁbre. The union
BG =
∞
[
n=1
BGn
is the classifying space for the “stable theory”.
The stable theory for ﬁnite dimensional complexes is just the di-
rect limit of the ﬁnite dimensional theories under ﬁberwise suspen-
sion. This direct limit converges after a ﬁnite number of steps – so
we can think of a map into BG as classifying a spherical ﬁbration
whose ﬁbre dimension is much larger than that of the base.
For inﬁnite complexes X we can say that a homotopy class of
maps of X into BG is just the element in the inverse limit of the
homotopy classes of the skeleta of X.
This uses the ﬁniteness of
the homotopy groups of BG (see Chapter 3). Such an element in
3The ﬁbre homotopy equivalences have to preserve the orientation.

Spherical Fibrations
91
the inverse limit can then be interpreted as an increasing union of
spherical ﬁbrations of increasing dimension over the skeletons of X.
The involution in the “stable theory” is trivial4 and there is a
canonical splitting
BG ∼= K(Z/2, 1) × BSG .
Some particular examples can be calculated:
BG1 = R P∞,
BSG1 = S∞∼= ∗
BG2 = BO2,
BSG2 ∼= C P∞∼= BSO2
All higher BGn’s are unknown although the (ﬁnite) homotopy
groups of
BG =
∞
[
n=1
BGn
are much studied.

Stasheﬀ’s explicit procedure does not apply without (semi-simplicial)
modiﬁcation to Sn−1
l
-ﬁbrations for l a proper set of primes. In this
case Sn
l is an inﬁnite complex (though locally compact).
If we consider the l-adic spherical ﬁbrations, namely Hurewicz
ﬁbrations with ﬁbre bSn−1
l
, the situation is even more inﬁnite. bSn−1
l
is an uncountable complex and therefore not even locally compact.
However, Dold’s theory of quasi-ﬁbrations can be used5 to obtain
abstract representation theorems for theories of ﬁbrations with ar-
bitrary ﬁbre.

This diagram classiﬁes the diagram of oriented theories.
The
action of the fundamental groups on the covering spaces corre-
sponds to the action of the units on the oriented theories –
(ξ, Uξ) →(ξ, αUξ)
where ξ is the spherical ﬁbration, E →B, Uξ is the orientation
in Hn(E →B; R), α is a unit of R = (Z, Zl, bZl).
The proof of 4.2 is rather long so we defer it to the end of the
Chapter. However, as corollary to the proof we have
Corollary 1 There are natural equivalences
π0 Aut Sn−1

(SGn)ˆ
l .
Here Aut X is the singular complex of automorphisms of X – a
simplex σ is a homotopy equivalence
σ × X →X .
The subscript “1” means the component of the identity.

94
The Galois Group
A second corollary of the Main Theorem which should be empha-
sized is the symmetry in
(BSGn)l and (BSGn)ˆ
l .
Corollary 2 Since the Theorem shows these spaces classify the
oriented theories they have compatible Z∗
l and bZ
∗
l symmetry.
For l = {p},
Z∗
l ∼= Z/2 ⊕Free Abelian group
generated by the
primes other
than p
bZ
∗
l
∼=
(
Z/(p −1) ⊕bZp
(p > 2)
Z/2 ⊕bZ2
(p = 2)
So in the complete theory we see how the rather independent sym-
metries of the local theory coalesce (topologically) into one compact
(topologically) cyclic factor.
We will see below (Corollary 3) that the homotopy groups of
BSGn are ﬁnite except for one dimension –
πnBSGn = Z ⊕torsion
n even
π2n−2BSGn = Z ⊕torsion
n odd
The ﬁrst (n −1) ﬁnite homotopy groups correspond to the ﬁrst
n −2 stable homotopy groups of spheres.
Then (BSGn)ˆ
l has for homotopy the l-torsion of these groups plus
one bZl (in dimension n or 2n −2, respectively).
The units bZ
∗
l act trivially on the low dimensional, stable groups
but non-trivially on the higher groups. For example, for n even we
have the natural action of bZ
∗
l on
πn(BSGn)ˆ
l/mod torsion ∼= bZl .

Spherical Fibrations
95
On the higher groups the action measures the eﬀect of the degree
α map on the homotopy groups of a sphere. This action is com-
putable up to extension in terms of Whitehead products and Hopf
invariants. It seems especially interesting at the prime 2.
The Rational Theory
If l is vacuous, the local theory is the “rational theory”. Using
the ﬁbration
[(Ωn−1Sn−1)1 →SGn →Sn−1]localized at l = 0
it is easy to verify
Corollary 3 Oriented Sn−1
∅
ﬁbrations are classiﬁed by
i) an Euler class in Hn(base; Q) for n even
ii) a “Hopf class” in H2n−2(base; Q) for n odd.

Corollary 3 has a “twisted analogue” for unoriented bundles.
Stably the oriented rational theory is trivial. The unoriented sta-
ble theory is just the theory of Q coeﬃcient systems, H1(

Note that Corollary 3 (part i) twisted or untwisted checks with
the equivalence

and the square of the natural action for n odd.

iii) The action of the Galois group (units of l-adic integers) is trivial

97
Also, because of the rational structure
lim
n→∞
¡
(BSGn)l →(BSGn)ˆ
l
¢
is an isomorphism. This completes the proof of i) since the stable
oriented l-adic theory is classiﬁed by
lim
n→∞(BSGn)ˆ
l .
ii) Consider the l-adic case. A coeﬃcient system
α ∈H1(
, bZ
∗
l )
determines an bS1
l -bundle α by letting the units act on some repre-
sentative of bS1
l by homeomorphisms. (A functorial construction
of K(bZl, 1) will suﬃce.)
Represent a stable oriented l-adic ﬁbration by an l-local ﬁbration
γ using the isomorphism of i). The ﬁberwise join α∗γ determines
a (cohomologically twisted) l-adic ﬁbration since
bS1
l ∗Sn−1
l
∼= bSn+1
l
.
One easily checks (using the discussion in the proof of Theorem
4.2) that this construction induces a map
K(bZ
∗
l , 1) × (BSG)l →
¡
lim
−→
n
bBn
l
¢
which is an isomorphism on homotopy groups.
The local case is similar.
In fact an argument is unnecessary
since one knows a priori (using Whitney join) that the stable
local theory is additive.
iii) The action of the Galois group is clearly trivial using ii). Or, more
directly in the local theory the action is trivial because there are
automorphisms of
S1
l ﬁbre joinγ , γ an oriented local ﬁbration
which change the orientation by any unit of Zl. Then the action
of the proﬁnite group bZ
∗
l is trivial by continuity.
Note that part iii) of Corollary 3 is a “pure homotopy theoretical
Adams Conjecture”.

98
The Inertia of Intrinsic Stable Fibre Homotopy Types
We generalize the “purely homotopy theoretical Adams conjec-
ture” of the previous Corollary 3, iii).
Let
B0 →· · · →Bn
i−→Bn+1 →. . .
be a sequence of spaces. Assume that each space is the base of a
spherical ﬁbration of increasing ﬁbre dimension
Sdn →γn →Bn ,
and that these ﬁt together in the natural way
i∗γn+1
fn∼=
¡
γn ﬁbre join Sdn+1−dn¢
.
We will study the “stable bundle”
B∞
γ−→BG ,
where B∞= mapping telescope {Bn}, and a representative of γ is
constructed from the {γn} and the equivalences {fn}.7
The basic assumption about the “stable ﬁbration” γ is that it is
“intrinsic to the ﬁltration” {Bn} of B∞– there are arbitrarily large
integers n so that the spherical ﬁbration γn+1 is strongly approxi-
mated by the map
Bn →Bn+1 ,
i.e. the natural composition
Bn

−−−−−−−−→i∗γn+1
i∗

is an equivalence over the d(n)-skeleton where
¡

inﬁnity as n approaches inﬁnity.
7Recall from Chapter 3 that mapping into BG deﬁnes a compact representable functor. γn
over Bn determines a unique map Bn
(γn)
−−−→BG and γ is the unique element in the inverse
limit lim
←[Bn, BG] ∼
= [B∞, BG] deﬁned by these.
In particular, γ is independent of the
equivalences {fn}.

adic spherical ﬁbration context. In the oriented case we are then
studying certain maps,
B∞→(BSG)l ∼=
Y
p∈l

It is clear that the localization or completion of an intrinsic stable
ﬁbration is intrinsic.

Corollary Any automorphism of BG which keeps the ﬁltration
{BGn} invariant is homotopic to the identity map.
Remark: There is at least one homotopy equivalence of BG which
is not the identity – the homotopy inverse
x 7→x−1
deﬁned by the H-space structure in BG.
Remark: In the intrinsic examples above BO, BPL, BG, . . . , the ﬁl-
tered automorphisms are precisely those operations in bundles which
give isomorphisms and preserve the geometric ﬁbre dimension. That

102
is they are isomorphisms which are geometric in character. The The-
orem can then be paraphrased “geometric automorphisms of bundle
theories preserve the stable ﬁbre homotopy type”.

a local Sn−1

p
-ﬁbrations one for each
p in l together with the coherence condition that the characteristic
classes (either Euler or Hopf, with coeﬃcients in Qp) they determine
are respectively in the image of a single rational class.
Principal Spherical Fibrations
Certain local (or l-adic) spheres are naturally homotopy equiva-
lent to topological groups. Thus we can speak of principal spherical
ﬁbrations. The classifying space for these principal ﬁbrations is easy
to describe and maps into the classifying space for oriented spherical
ﬁbrations.
Proposition (p odd) bSn−1
p

group (or loop space) iﬀn is even and n divides 2p −2.8
Corollary S2n−1
l
is homotopy equivalent to a loop space iﬀ
l ⊆{p : Z/n ⊆p-adic units} .
Let S2n−1
l
have classifying space P ∞(n, l), then
ΩP ∞(n, l) ∼= S2n−1
l
.
8For p = 2, it is well known that only S1, S3 and S7 are H-spaces, and S7 is not a loop
space.

104
The ﬁbration
S2n−1
l

implies
i) H∗¡
P ∞(n, l); Zl
¢
is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra on one
generator in dimension 2n.
ii) For each choice of an orientation of S2n−1
l
there is a natural map
P ∞(n, l) →(BSG2n)l .
In cohomology the universal Euler class in (BSG2n)l restricts to
the polynomial generator in P ∞(n, l).
Proof of the proposition: A rational argument implies a spher-
ical H-space has to be odd dimensional.
If bSn−1
p
is a loop space, ΩBn, it is clear that the mod p cohomology
of Bn is a polynomial algebra on one generator in dimension n.
Looking at Steenrod operations implies λ divides (p−1)pk for some k,
where n = 2λ. Looking at secondary operations – using Liulevicius’
mod p analysis generalizing the famous mod 2 analysis of Adams
shows k = 0, namely λ divides p −1.
On the other hand, if λ divides p −1 we can construct Bn directly
–
i) embed Z/λ in Z/(p −1) ⊆bZ
∗
p ,
ii) choose a functorial K(bZp, 2) on which bZ
∗
p acts freely by cellular
homeomorphisms,
iii) form
Bn =
¡
K(bZp, 2)/(Z/λ)
¢ˆ
p .
We obtain a p-adically complete space which is simply connected,
has mod p cohomology a polynomial algebra on one generator in
dimension n and whose loop space is bSn−1
p
.
In more detail, the mod p cohomology of K(bZp, 2)/(Z/λ) is the
invariant cohomology in K(bZp, 2) –
(1, x, x2, x3, . . . ) α−→(1, αx, α2x2, . . . ), αλ = 1 .

Spherical Fibrations
105
This follows since λ is prime to p and we have the spectral sequence
of the ﬁbration
K(bZp, 2) →K(bZp, 2)/(Z/λ) →K(Z/λ, 1) .
Bn is simply connected since
π1
¡
K(bZp, 2)/(Z/λ)
¢ˆ
p = (Z/λ)ˆp = 0 .
Bn is then (n −1)-connected by the Hurewicz theorem.
The space of loops on Bn is an (n −2)-connected p-adically com-
plete space whose mod p cohomology is one Z/p in dimension n −1.
The integral homology of ΩBn is then one bZp in dimension n−1 and
we have the p-adic sphere bSn−1
p

U ∈Hn(A →X; Zl)
such that
Hi(X; Zl) ∪U

is an isomorphism, then under appropriate fundamental group as-
sumptions A
f−→X determines an oriented Sn−1

For example if the fundamental group of X acts trivially on the
ﬁbre of f, then an easy spectral sequence argument shows that
H∗(ﬁbre f; Zl) ∼= H∗(Sn−1

If further ﬁbre f is a “simple space” a ﬁberwise localization10 is

The analogous relation is not true in the complete context. How-
ever, we can say that

Thus ﬁbre join followed by ﬁberwise completion deﬁnes a pairing
in the l-adic context.

But t exists by obstruction theory,
H∗(∂ξ′, ξ | ∂σ; π∗Fl) ∼= H∗¡
∂σ × (Fl, F); Zl -module
¢
= 0 .
Thus we can ﬁberwise localize any ﬁbration with “simple ﬁbre”
by proceeding inductively over the cells of the base.
We ob-
tain a “homotopically locally trivial” ﬁbration which determines
a unique Hurewicz ﬁbration with ﬁbre Fl.

108
The same argument works for ﬁberwise completion,
F →bFl
whenever
H∗( bFl, F; bZl) = 0 .
But this is true for example when F = Sn−1 or Sn−1
l
.
This shows we have the diagram of i) for objects. The argument
for maps and commutativity is similar.
To prove ii) and iii) we discuss the sequence of theories
U :
½
oriented
SR-ﬁbrations
¾
f−→{SR-ﬁbrations} w−→H1(
, R∗)
where SR = Sn−1, Sn−1
l
, or bSn−1
l
; and R is Z, Zl, or bZl.
The ﬁrst map forgets the orientation.
The second map replaces each ﬁbre by its reduced integral homol-
ogy. This gives an R coeﬃcient system classiﬁed by an element in
H1(
; R∗).
Now the covering homotopy property implies that an SR ﬁbration
over a sphere Si+1 can be built from a homotopy automorphism of
Si × SR preserving the projection Si × SR →Si. We can regard this
as a map of Si into the singular complex of automorphisms of SR,
Aut SR.
For i = 0, the ﬁbration is determined by the component of the
image of the other point on the equator. But in the sequence
π0 Aut SR →[SR, SR] →πn−1SR →Hn−1SR
the ﬁrst map is an injection and the second and third are isomor-
phisms. Thus
π0 Aut SR ∼= R∗∼= Aut (Hn−1SR) .
This proves ii) and the fact that oriented bundles over S1 are all
equivalent.
More generally, an orientation of an SR ﬁbration determines an
embedding of the trivial ﬁbration SR →∗into it. This embedding
in turn determines the orientation over a connected base.

Spherical Fibrations
109
Thus if the orientation sequence U corresponds to the sequence
of classifying spaces
eBR
f−→BR w−→K(R∗, 1)
we see that for i > 0
πi+1 eBR ∼= [Si+1, eBR]free
∼= oriented bundles over Si+1
∼= based bundles over Si+1
∼= [Si+1, BR]based
∼= πi+1BR .
So on homotopy we have
∗
f−→R∗w
−→
∼
= R∗
for π1 ,
πi+1
f−→
∼
= πi+1 →∗
for πi+1 .
Therefore, U is the universal covering space sequence.
Also the correspondence between based and oriented bundles shows
the R∗actions correspond as stated in iii).
We are left to prove the ﬁrst part of iii).
The cell by cell construction of part i) shows we can construct
(cell by cell) a natural diagram

Also, a based or oriented SR-ﬁbration over Si+1 has a well deﬁned
characteristic element,
Si →component of the identity of Aut SR .

110
So we need to calculate the homotopy in the diagram

Now c0 just tensors the homotopy with bZl.
An element in πi of the upper right hand space is just a homotopy
class of maps
Si × SR →SR , SR = bSn−1
l
which is the identity on ∗× SR and constant along Si × ∗. By trans-
lation to the component of the constant we get a map which is also
constant along ∗× SR, thus a homotopy class of maps
Si ∧SR →SR .
This homotopy set is isomorphic to
[bSn+i−1
l
, bSn−1
l
] ∼= [Sn+i−1, bSn−1
l
] ∼= πn+i−1Sn−1 ⊗bZl .
The naturality of this calculation shows c1 also l-adically com-
pletes the homotopy groups.
There is a long exact homotopy sequence for the vertical sequence
on the left.

Spherical Fibrations
111
A proof of this which works on the right goes as follows. Look at
the obstructions to completing the diagram
SR
∗× σi+1
σi+1 × SR
∂σi+1 × SR ∪σi+1 × ∗
SR
These lie in
Hk¡
(σi+1, ∂σi+1) × (SR, ∗); πk−1SR
¢
.
But these are all zero except k = n + i and this group is just
πn+i−1 bSn−1
l
∼= πi(“ﬁbre”) .
So we can construct an exact homotopy sequence on the right.
This means that c also tensors the homotopy with bZl.
This proves that
BSGn →universal cover bBl
n
is just l-adic completion.
The localization statement is similar so this completes the proof
of iii) and the Theorem.


Chapter 5
ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
(Etale1 Homotopy Theory)
Introduction
We discuss a beautiful theory from algebraic geometry about the
homotopy type of algebraic varieties.
The main point is this – there is a purely algebraic construction of
the proﬁnite completion of the homotopy type of a complex algebraic
variety.
We will be concerned with aﬃne varieties over the complex num-
bers, V ⊂Ck, such as
GL (n, C) ⊆Cn2+1 = {(x11, x12, . . . , xnn, y) | det(xij) · y = 1} .
We also want to consider algebraic varieties of ﬁnite type built
from a ﬁnite collection of aﬃne varieties by algebraic pasting such
as
P 1(C) = {space of lines in C2} = A1 ∪A2
where the pasting diagram
A1 ←A1 ∩A2 →A2
1“etale” equals smooth.
113

114
is isomorphic to
C ←−−−−−−
inclusion C −{0} −−−−−−→
inversion C .
The role of C in the above deﬁnition is only that of “ﬁeld of deﬁn-
ition”. Both of these deﬁnition schemes work over any commutative
ring R giving varieties (deﬁned over R)
GL (n, R) and P 1(R) .
For this last remark it is important to note that the coeﬃcients in
the deﬁning relation of GL (n, C) and the pasting function for P 1(C)
naturally lie in the ring R (since they lie in Z).
The notion of a prescheme over R has been formulated2 to de-
scribe the object obtained by the general construction of glueing
together aﬃne varieties over R.
The notion of algebraic variety over R (or scheme) is derived from
this by imposing a closure condition on the diagonal map.
One of the main points is –
To any prescheme S there is a naturally associated etale homo-
topy type ε(S). The etale homotopy type is an inverse system of
ordinary homotopy types. These homotopy types are constructed
from “algebraic coverings” (= etale coverings) of the prescheme S.
One procedure is analogous3 to the construction of the ˇCech nerve
of a topological covering of a topological space.
As in the ˇCech theory the homotopy types are indexed by the set
of coverings which is partially ordered by reﬁnement.
In Artin-Mazur4, a number of theorems are proved about the
relationship between
i) the classical homotopy type of a variety over the complex num-
bers and its etale homotopy type.
2For precise deﬁnitions see for example I. G. Macdonald , Algebraic Geometry. Introduction
to Schemes, Benjamin (1968)
3For a simple description of this construction see p. 456 of Lubkin, On a Conjecture of Weil,

Actually, Artin and Mazur use a more elaborate (than ˇCech like)
construction of the “nerves” – interlacing the actual nerves for sys-
tems of etale coverings.
This construction uses Verdier’s concept of a hypercovering.
They develop some homotopy theory for inverse systems of ho-
motopy types. The maps

Theorem 5.1 then implies for X a complex algebraic variety of ﬁnite
type
5One has to assume that X satisﬁes some further condition so that the homotopy groups of
the “nerve” are ﬁnite – normal or non-singular suﬃces. Anyway, if they are not, one can
proﬁnitely complete the nerve and then take an inverse limit to construct b
X algebraically.

in the sense
of maps
described above
{f} is the category used in Chapter 3, {X
f−→F}, to construct the
proﬁnite completion of the classical homotopy type.
Thus we can take the inverse limit of the “nerve” of etale coverings
and obtain an algebraic construction for the proﬁnite completion of
the classical homotopy type of X.
We try to motivate the success of the etale method. To do this
we discuss a slight modiﬁcation of Lubkin’s (ˇCech-like) construction
in certain examples.
Then we study the “complete etale homo-
topy type” and its Galois symmetry in the case of the ﬁnite Grass-
mannian.
For motivation one might keep in mind the “Inertia Lemma” of
Chapter 4.
Intuitive Discussion of the Etale Homotopy Type
Let V be an (irreducible) complex algebraic variety. Let us con-
sider the problem of calculating the cohomology of V by algebraic
means. It will turn out that we can succeed if we consider only ﬁnite
coeﬃcients. (Recall that the cohomology of a smooth manifold can
be described analytically in terms of diﬀerential forms if we consider
real coeﬃcients.)
The singular method for calculating cohomology involves the no-
tion of a continuous map
simplex −→underlying topological space of V
so we abandon it.
The ˇCech method only involves the formal lattice of open sets for
the topology of V . Some part of this lattice is algebraic in nature.

Algebraic Geometry
117
In fact we have



lattice of
subvarieties of
V



c−→
½

¾
which assigns to each algebraic subvariety the complement – a “Zariski
open set”.
The open sets in {image c} deﬁne the Zariski topology in V –
which is algebraic in nature.
Consider the ˇCech scheme applied to this algebraic part of the
topology of V . Let {Uα} be a ﬁnite covering of V by Zariski open
sets.
Proposition If {Uα} has (n + 1) elements, then the ˇCech nerve of
{Uα} is the n-simplex, ∆n.
The proof follows from the simple fact that any ﬁnite intersection
of non-void Zariski open sets is a non-void Zariski open set – each
is everywhere dense being the complement of a real codimension 2
subvariety.
n = 2
Notice also that if we close U under intersections (and regard all the
intersections as being distinct), the simplices of the ﬁrst barycentric
subdivision of the n-simplex,

118
correspond to strings of inclusions
Ui1 ⊆Ui2 ⊆· · · ⊆Uin .
Since the homology of the n-simplex is trivial we gain nothing
from a direct application of the ˇCech method to Zariski coverings.
At this point Grothendieck enters with a simple generalization
with brilliant and far-reaching consequences.
i) First notice that the calculation scheme of ˇCech cohomology for
a covering may be deﬁned for any category. (We regard {Uα} as
a category – whose objects are the Uα and whose morphisms are
the inclusions Uα ⊆Uβ.)
We describe Lubkin’s geometric scheme for doing this below.
ii) Consider categories constructed from coverings of X by “etale
mappings”,
eUα
π−→Uα ⊆X .
Uα is a Zariski open set in X and π is a ﬁnite6 covering map.
(The images of π are assumed to cover X.)
The objects in this category are the maps
eUα
π−→X
and the morphisms are the commutative diagrams
eUα

(three morphisms)
So the generalization consists in allowing several maps eUα →
→eUβ,
instead of only considering inclusions.
Actually Grothendieck generalizes the notion of a topology using
such etale coverings and develops sheaf cohomology in this context.
It is clear from the deﬁnition that the lattice of all such categories
(constructed from all the etale coverings of X) contains the following
information:
6Only ﬁnite coverings are algebraic. Riemann began the proof of the converse.

119
i) the formal lattice of coverings by Zariski open sets
ii) that aspect of the “lattice of fundamental groups” of the Zariski
open sets which is detected by looking at ﬁnite (algebraic) cov-
erings of these open sets.
To convert this information into homotopy theory we make the
Definition (The nerve of a category) If C is a category deﬁne a
semi-simplicial complex S(C) as follows –
the vertices are the objects of C
the 1-simplices are the morphisms of C
...
the n-simplices are the strings of n-morphisms in C ,
O0

The face operations are obtained by composing maps. The de-
generacies are obtained by inserting the identity map to expand the
string.
The “nerve of the category” is the geometric realization of S(C).
The homology, cohomology and homotopy of the category are de-
ﬁned to be those of the nerve.
To work with the nerve of a category geometrically it is convenient
to suppress the degenerate simplices – those strings

The examples below begin to give one a feeling for manipulating
the homotopy theory of categories directly without even going to
the geometric realization of the category.

ii) If K is a simplicial complex, let C(K) denote the category whose
objects are the simplices of K and whose morphisms are the face
relations
σ < τ .
Then the non-degenerate part of the nerve of C(K) is the ﬁrst
barycentric subdivision of K.
K

iii) If there is at most one morphism between any two objects of C,
then nerve C(U) forms a simplicial complex.
iv) If C has a ﬁnal object A, then the nerve is contractible. In fact

v) C and its opposite category have isomorphic nerves.
The next example illustrates Lubkin’s ingenious method of utiliz-
ing the nerves of categories.
Example 1 Let U = {Uα} be a ﬁnite covering of a ﬁnite polyhedron
K. Suppose
i) K −Uα is a subcomplex
ii) Uα is contractible
iii) {Uα} is “locally directed”, i.e. given x ∈Uα ∩Uβ there is a Uγ
such that x ∈Uγ ⊆Uα ∩Uβ.
Then following Lubkin we can construct the subcovering of “smallest
neighborhoods”, C(U). Namely Uα ∈C(U), iﬀthere is an x such that

Uα is the smallest element of U containing x. (Property iii) and the
ﬁniteness of U implies each x has a unique “smallest neighborhood”.)
We regard C(U) as a category with objects the Uα and morphisms
the inclusions between them.
Proposition 5.1
nerve C(U) ∼= K .
Proof: Suppose K is triangulated so that
i) each simplex of K is in some element Uα of C(U).
ii) For each Uα of C(U) the maximal subcomplex of the ﬁrst barycen-
tric subdivision of K, K(Uα) which is contained in Uα is con-
tractible.
(If this is not so we can subdivide K so that
i) each simplex is smaller than the Lebesgue number of U
ii) each complement K −Uα is full – it contains a simplex iﬀit
contains the vertices.)
Then the category C(U) is equivalent to a category of contractible
subcomplexes of K, {K(Uα)}. It is easy now to deﬁne a canonical
homotopy class of maps
nerve C(U)
f−→K
f
Map each vertex Uα of nerve C(U) to a vertex of Kα. Map each
1-simplex Uα →Uβ of nerve C(U) to a (piecewise linear) path in Kβ.

122
We proceed in this way extending the map piecewise-linearly over
nerve C(U) using the contractibility of the K(Uα)’s.
We construct a map the other way.
To each simplex σ associate Uσ the smallest neighborhood of the
barycenter of σ. One can check7 that Uσ is the smallest neighbor-
hood of x for each x in the interior of σ.
It follows that σ < τ implies Uσ ⊆Uτ.
So map each simplex in the ﬁrst barycentric subdivision of K,
σ1 < σ2 < · · · < σn , σi ∈K
to the simplex in nerve C(U),
Uσn ⊆Uσn−1 ⊆· · · ⊆Uσ1 .
This gives a simplicial map
K′ −→
g nerve C(U) , K′ = 1st barycentric subdivision .
Now consider the compositions
K′ −→
g nerve C(U) −→
f K
nerve C(U)
f−→K = K′ g−→nerve C(U) .
One can check for the ﬁrst composition that a simplex of K′
σ1 < · · · < σn
has image in K(Uα1).
A homotopy to the identity is then easily
constructed.
For the second composition consider a triangulation L of nerve
C(U) so that f is simplicial.8 For each simplex σ of L consider
a) the smallest simplex of nerve C(U) containing σ, say U1 ⊂U2 ⊂
· · · ⊂Un.
7The subset of Uα consisting of those points for which Uα is the “smallest neighborhood” is
obtained by removing a ﬁnite number of Uβ’s from Uα. It this consists of open simplices.
8f may be so constructed that this is possible.

Algebraic Geometry
123
b) all the open sets in C(U) obtained by taking “smallest neighbor-
hoods” of barycenters of f∗τ, τ a face of σ.
Let C(σ) denote the subcategory of C(U) generated by U1, U2, . . . , Un;
the open sets of b); and all the inclusions between them.
The construction of f/σ takes place in Un so all the objects of
C(σ) lie in Un. This implies nerve C(σ) is a contractible subcomplex
of C(U)
¡
C(σ) has a ﬁnal object – Un.
¢
Also by construction τ < σ implies C(τ) ⊆C(σ). g ◦f and the
identity map are both carried by
σ →C(σ) ,
that is
I(σ) ⊆C(σ) ,
g ◦f(σ) ⊆C(σ) .
The desired homotopy is now easily constructed by induction over
the simplices of L.
Note: The canonical map
K

−→nerve C(U)
U = {Uα}
C(U) = category of “smallest neighborhoods” .
is deﬁned under the assumptions
i) K −Uα is a subcomplex
ii) U is ﬁnite and locally directed.
We might prematurely say that maps like gU (for slightly more
complicated U’s) comprise Lubkin’s method of approximating the
homotopy type of algebraic varieties.
The extra complication comes from allowing the categories to have
many morphisms between two objects.
Example 2 Let π be a group. Let C(π) be the following category:
C(π) has one object π

124
the morphisms of this object are the elements of π. These compose
according to the group law in π.
Then
N = nerve of C(π) ∼= K(π, 1) ,
the space with one non-zero homotopy group π in discussion one.
Proof: First consider π1N. In the van Kampen description of π1 of
a complex we take the group generated by the edge paths beginning
and ending at the base point with relations coming from the 2-cells,
(See Hilton and Wylie, Homology Theory, CUP (1960).)
Now N has only one vertex (the object π).
An element of π then determines a loop at this vertex. From the
van Kampen description we see that this gives an isomorphism
π −→
∼
= π1N .
Now consider the cells of N. The non-degenerate n-cells corre-
spond precisely to the n-tuples of elements of π,
{(g1, . . . , gn) : gi ̸= 1} .
An n-cell of the universal cover e
N is an n-cell of N with an equiv-
alence class of edge paths connecting it to the base point.
We obtain a non-degenerate n-cell in e
N for each element in π and
each non-degenerate n-cell in N.
It is not hard to identify the chain complex obtained from the cells
of the universal cover e
N with the “bar resolution of π”. (MacLane
– Homology Springer (1967), p. 114.)

Algebraic Geometry
125
Thus e
N is acyclic.
But e
N is also simply connected, thus
π ∼K(π, 1) .
The preceding two examples admit a common generalization which
seems to be the essential topological fact behind the success of etale
cohomology.
Example 3 Let U be a locally directed covering of X by K(π, 1)’s,
πiUα = 0 if i > 1 , Uα ∈U .
Consider the “generalized etale”9 covering of X by the universal
covers of the Uα
eUα →X
and construct the category of “smallest neighborhoods” as before.
(We assume for all x ∈U only ﬁnitely many U’s contain x). The
maps are now all commutative diagrams

.
Then X is homotopy equivalent to
nerve C(U) .
A map X →nerve C(U) is slightly harder to construct than in
example 1.
It is convenient to use contractible “ˇCech coverings”
which reﬁne U as in Theorem 5.12 below.
One homological proof can then be deduced from Theorem 2,
p. 475 of Lubkin, On a Conjecture of Weil, American Journal of
Mathematics 89, 443–548 (1967).
Rather than pursue a precise discussion we consider some spe-
ciﬁc examples. They illustrate the geometric appeal of the Lubkin
construction of etale cohomology.
9We are allowing inﬁnite covers.

126
i) (the circle, S1) Consider the category determined by the single
covering map,
R x7→eix
−−−−→
π
S1 .
This category Z has one object, the map π, and inﬁnitely many
morphisms, the translations of R preserving π.
The nerve of Z has the homotopy type of a K(Z , 1) ∼= S1.
ii) (the two sphere, S2) Let p and σ denote two distinct points of
S2. Consider the category over S2 determined by the maps
object
name
S2 −p
⊆
−→S2
e
S2 −q
⊆
−→S2
e′
(universal cover S2 −p −q) →S2
Z
.
The category has three objects and might be denoted
C ≡{e ←Z →e′} .
e and e′ have only the identity self-morphism while Z has the
covering transformations πn, −∞< n < ∞. There are unique
maps
Z →e and Z →e′ .
The nerve of the subcategory {Z} is equivalent to the circle. The
nerve of {e} is contractible and the nerve of {Z →e} looks like
the cone over the circle. Thus the nerve of C looks like two cones
over S1 glued together along S1, or
nerve C ∼= S2 .
iii) (the three sphere S3) Consider C2 −0 and the cover
U1 = {z1 ̸= 0} ∼= S1 ,
U2 = {z2 ̸= 0} ∼= S1 ,
U1 ∩U2 = {z1 ̸= 0, z2 ̸= 0} ∼= S1 × S1 .
Let C be the category determined by the universal covers of these
open sets mapping to C2 −0. Then C might be denoted
{Z ←−
p1 Z ⊕Z −→
p2 Z} ,

Algebraic Geometry
127
where p1 and p2 are the two projections. (We think of the ele-
ments in Z or Z ⊕Z and p1 and p2 as generating the morphisms
of the category.)
The nerve of C is built up from the diagram of spaces
{S1 ←−
p1 S1 × S1 −→
p2 S1} ,
corresponding to the decomposition of S3 into two solid tori glued
together along their common boundary.
the realization of the natural functor
{Z ←Z ⊕Z →Z} →{e ←Z →e′}
corresponds to the hemispherical decomposition of the Hopf map
S3 H
−→S2 .
iv) (Complex projective plane) Consider the three natural aﬃne open
sets in
C P2
= {(z0, z1, z2) “homogeneous triples”} ,
deﬁned by
Ui = {(z0, z1, z2) : zi ̸= 0}
i = 0, 1, 2 .
Ui is homeomorphic to C × C,
Ui ∩Uj is homeomorphic to (C −0) × C i ̸= j,
U0 ∩U1 ∩U2 is homeomorphic to (C −0) × (C −0).

e4 ∪H S2 ∼= C P2.
Note that the category C has an involution obtained by reﬂecting
objects about the l2 axis and mapping morphisms by sending a
into b.
The ﬁxed subcategory is
{e ←Z 2−→Z}
whose nerve is the mapping cone of
S1 degree 2
−−−−−→S1
or the real projective plane R P2.
v) (Complex projective n-space) Again consider the category deter-
mined by the universal covers of the natural aﬃnes in C Pn
Ui = {(z0, . . . , zn) : zi ̸= 0}, 0 ⩽i ⩽n
and their intersections. This category is modeled on the n-simplex,
one imagines an object at the barycenter of each face whose self
morphisms form a free Abelian group of rank equal to the dimen-

130
sion of the face,

∼= C P3 .
The nerve of this category is equivalent to C Pn.
This decomposition of C Pn occurs in other points of view:
i) the nth stage of the Milnor construction of the classifying space
for S1,
S1 ∗S1 ∗· · · ∗S1
|
{z
}
n join factors
/S1
ii) the dynamical system for the Frobenius map
(z0, z1, . . . , zn) Fq
−−→(zq
0, zq
1, . . . , zq
n) .
If we iterate Fq indeﬁnitely the points of C Pn ﬂow according to
the scheme of arrows in the n-simplex.
Each point ﬂows to a
torus of the dimension of the face.
For example, if we think of P 1(C) as the extended complex plane,
then under iteration of the qth power mapping
the points inside the unit disk ﬂow to the origin ,
the points outside the unit disk ﬂow to inﬁnity ,
the points of the unit circle are invariant .

Algebraic Geometry
131
This corresponds to the scheme
S2 ∼= P 1(C) ∼= {e ←Z →e} .
(John Guckenheimer).
This (n-simplex) category for describing the homotopy type of
C Pn has natural endomorphisms –
F q =
(
identity in objects ,
f →fq for self morphisms .
(F q is then determined on the rest of the morphisms.)
The realization of F q is up to homotopy the geometric Frobenius
discussed above, Fq.
From these examples we see that there are simple categories which
determine the homotopy type of these varieties
V : C1 −0, C2 −0, . . .
C P1 , C P2 , . . . , C Pn , . . . .
These categories are constructed from Zariski coverings of V by
considering the universal covering spaces of the elements in the
Zariski cover.
These categories cannot be constructed from etale coverings of V ,
collections of ﬁnite to one covering maps whose images are Zariski
open coverings of V .
If we consider these algebraically deﬁned categories we can how-
ever “proﬁnitely approximate” the categories considered above.
For example, in the case V = S2 = C P1, look at the etale covers
Un : S2 −p
⊆
−→S2 ,
S2 −q
⊆
−→S2 ,
S2 −p −q −−−−−−→
degree n S2 .
The category of this cover,
C(Un) ∼= {e ←Z /n →e}

132
has nerve the suspension of the inﬁnite dimensional lens space
suspension K(Z /n, 1) .
These form an inverse system by reﬁnement

The nerves give an inverse system of homotopy types with ﬁnite
homotopy groups
{suspension K(Z /n, 1)}n .
We can think of this inverse system as representing the etale ho-
motopy type of S2 (it is homotopically coﬁnal in the inverse system
of all nerves of etale coverings).
We can form a homotopy theoretical limit if we wish10,

Since π1X is zero we have the proﬁnite completion of S2, con-
structed algebraically from etale coverings of C P1.
10Using the compact topology on [
, Σ K(Z /n, 1)] as in Chapter 3.

Algebraic Geometry
133
In a similar manner we construct the proﬁnite completions of the
varieties above using the nerves of categories of etale coverings of
these varieties.
For a more general complex variety V Lubkin considers all the
(locally directed, punctually ﬁnite) etale covers of V . Then he takes
the nerves of the category of smallest neighborhoods.
This gives
an inverse system of homotopy types from which we can form the
proﬁnite completion of the homotopy type of V .
The success of the construction is certainly motivated from the
topological point of view by the topological proposition and exam-
ples above.
From the algebraic point of view one has to know
i) there are enough K(π, 1) neighborhoods in a variety
ii) the lattice of algebraic coverings of these open sets gives the proﬁ-
nite completion of the fundamental group of these open sets.
The following sketch (which goes back to Lefschetz11) provides
credibility for i) which was proved in a more general context by
Artin.
Consider the assertion
Kn: for each Zariski open set U containing p ∈V n, there is a
K(π, 1) Zariski open U′ so that
p ∈U′ ⊆U ,
where V n is a non-singular subvariety of projective space
C Pn.
“Proof of Kn”:
a) Kn is true for n = 1. V 1 is then a Riemann surface and
U = V −ﬁnite set of points .
11First few pages of Colloquium volume on algebraic geometry.

134
But then U is a K(π, 1).
b) If F →E →B is a ﬁbration with F and B K(π, 1)’s then E is a
K(π, 1). This follows from the exact homotopy sequence.
c) Kn is true for all V if Kn−1 is true for V = P n−1(C).
Consider U ⊆V a Zariski open set about p. Choose a generic
projection π of P n(C) onto P n−1(C),
p
x1
x2
the curve
π−1(π(p))
V

so that
i) π(p) is a regular value of π/V ,
ii) the non-singular Riemann surface C = π−1¡
π(p)
¢
cuts V −U
transversally in a ﬁnite number of points x1, . . . , xn.
Choose a K(π, 1) neighborhood W of π(p) in P n−1(C) contained in
the set of images of points where i) and ii) (with constant n) hold.
Then by b) π−1W −(V −U) is a K(π, 1) neighborhood of p con-
tained in U. It is ﬁbred by a punctured curve over a K(π, 1) neigh-
borhood in P n−1(C). Q. E. D.
For the fundamental group statement of ii) it is easy to see that
an etale map determines a ﬁnite covering space of the image. (One
may ﬁrst have to apply a ﬁeld automorphism of C to obtain a local
expression of the map by complex polynomials.)
The converse is harder – the total space of a ﬁnite cover has an
analytic structure. This analytic structure is equivalent in enough
cases to an algebraic structure to compute bπ1. For n = 1, this fact
is due to Riemann.

Algebraic Geometry
135
The Complete Etale Homotopy Type
In order to apply etale homotopy we pass to the limit using the
compactness of proﬁnite sets (as in Chapter 3). We obtain a single
homotopy type from the inverse system of homotopy types com-
prising the etale type. This “complete etale homotopy type” is the
proﬁnite completion of the classical homotopy type for complex va-
rieties.
We study the arithmetic square (in the simply connected case) and
look at the examples of the Grassmannians – “real” and “complex”.
Let X denote the homotopy type of an algebraic variety of ﬁnite
type over C or a direct limit of these, for example
Gn(C) =
lim
k→∞(Grassmannian of n-planes in k-space) .
The etale homotopy type of X is an inverse system of CW com-
plexes with ﬁnite homotopy groups.12
Each one of these complexes determines a compact representable
functor (Chapter 3) and the inverse limit of these is a compact rep-
resentable functor. Let us denote this functor by b
X.

14Recall that if in some case the nerve does not have ﬁnite homotopy groups, then we ﬁrst
proﬁnitely complete it.

136
Theorem 5.2 Let V be a complex algebraic variety of ﬁnite type.
The “complete etale homotopy type”, deﬁned by
[
, bV ] ≡
lim
←
etale covers
[
, nerve]
is equivalent to the proﬁnite completion of the classical homotopy
type of V .
The integral homology of bV is the proﬁnite completion of the in-
tegral homology of V ,
eHi bV ∼= ( eHiV )ˆ.
If V is simply connected, the homotopy groups of bV are the proﬁ-
nite completions of those of V
πi bV ∼= (πiV )ˆ.
In this simply connected case bV is the product over the primes of
p-adic components
bV ∼=
Y
p
bVp .
Moreover, the topology on the functor
[
, bV ]
is intrinsic to the homotopy type of the CW complex bV .
Proof: The ﬁrst part is proved, for example, by completing both
sides of the Artin-Mazur relation among inverse systems of homo-
topy types,
etale type ≡
½
inverse system
of “nerves”
¾
∼= {F}{f} .
(see Chapter 3)
To do this we appeal to the Lemma of Chapter 3 – the arbitrary
inverse limit of compact representable functors is a compact repre-
sentable functor.
Since the inverse system {F}{f} was used to construct the proﬁnite
completion of V the result follows.
The relations between homology and homotopy follow from the
propositions of section 3.

Algebraic Geometry
137
Note: Actually it is immaterial in the simply connected case whether
we use the Artin-Mazur pro-object or Lubkin’s system of nerves to
construct the complete etale type. The characterization of Chapter
3 shows that from a map of V into an inverse system of spaces {Xi}
with the correct cohomology property
H∗(V ; A) ∼= lim
→H∗(Xi; A)

we can construct the proﬁnite completion of V ,

(This is true for arbitrary π1 if we know the cohomology isomorphism
holds for A twisted.)

Under ﬁnite type assumptions,

the topology on the homotopy functor is “intrinsic” to the homo-
topy type of b

Thus we can think of b
X as a homotopy type which happens to
have the additional property that there is a natural topology in
the homotopy sets [

This is analogous to the topology on bZ which is intrinsic to its

because c and i are both homotopy equivalences.
i is an equivalence because of the well-known Gram-Schmidt de-
formation retraction. That c is an equivalence follows for example
from Chevalley16 – who showed that any compact Lie group17 G
has a complex algebraic form

in our case O(n) and O(n, C)

which is topologically a product tubular neighborhood of the
compact form.
If we adjoin the equation det A = 1 we get the special complex
orthogonal group
SO(n, C) ,
the component of the identity of O(n, C).
Now consider the “algebraic form” of the oriented real Grassman-
nians (thickened)
eGn,k(R) ∼= SO(n + k, C)/(SO(n, C) × SO(k, C)) .
These are nice complex algebraic varieties which have the same
homotopy type as the orientation covers of the real Grassmanni-
ans
GL (n + k, R)/(GL (n, R) × GL (k, R)) .
Let X = lim
k→∞
eGn,k(R) ∼= BSOn, the classifying space for the spe-
cial orthogonal group.

17Thus we can apply this etale homotopy discussion to any compact Lie group. I am indebted
to Raoul Bott for suggesting this.

142
The Galois Symmetry in the Grassmannians BUn and
BSOn
Now we come to the most interesting point about the “algebraic”
aspect of etale homotopy type.
The varieties that we are considering – the “Grassmannians”
Gn,k(C),
eGn,k(R)
are deﬁned over the ﬁeld of rational numbers. The coeﬃcients in
the deﬁning equations for
GL (n, C) and O(n, C)
are actually integers.
Thus any ﬁeld automorphism of the complex numbers ﬁxes the co-
eﬃcients of these equations and deﬁnes an algebraic automorphism
of these Grassmannian varieties. Such an algebraic automorphism
determines an automorphism of the system of algebraic coverings,
an automorphism of the system of corresponding nerves, and ﬁnally
a homotopy equivalence of the complete etale homotopy type.18
We can describe the action informally. Our variety V is built from
a ﬁnite number of aﬃne varieties
V
= S Ai ,
Cn ⊇Ai = {(x1, . . . , xn) | fji(x1, . . . , xn) = 0, 0 ⩽j ⩽k} .
The Ai are assembled with algebraic isomorphisms between com-
plements of subvarieties of the Ai.
To say that V is deﬁned over the rationals means the coeﬃcients
of the deﬁning equation fji = 0 lie in Q and the polynomials deﬁning
the pasting isomorphisms have coeﬃcients in Q.
If σ is an automorphism of C,
z 7→zσ ,
we have an algebraic isomorphism of Cn
(z1, . . . , zn) 7→(zσ
1 , . . . , zσ
n) .
18Actually a homeomorphism of the homotopy functor [
, bV ].

143
σ has to be the identity on the subﬁeld Q (1σ = 1, 2σ = 2, (1
2)
σ
=
1
2σ = 1
2, etc.) 19
Thus σ preserves the equations
fji(z1, . . . , zn) = 0
deﬁning the aﬃnes Ai and the pasting isomorphisms from which we
build V . This gives
V
σ−→V ,
an algebraic isomorphism of V .
We describe the automorphism induced by σ on the system of
“etale nerves”.

σ∗Uα = {(v, u) : σ(v) = πα(u)} .
Thus we have a “backwards map” of the indexing set of etale
coverings used to construct the etale type,
{U} 7→{σ∗U} .
19I think some analogy should be made between this “inertia” of Q and the “inertia” of stable
ﬁbre homotopy types of Chapter 4.

144
On the other hand there is a natural map of the categories deter-
mined by U and σ∗U in the other direction
C(σ∗U) σ−→C(U) .
This is deﬁned by
(σ∗Uα) 7→Uα ,
(σ∗Uα
f−→σ∗Uβ) 7→(Uα
σ∗f
−−→Uβ) ,
where σ∗is deﬁned so that
σ∗Uα
f
²
σ∗

commutes.
Thus σ induces a map of inverse systems of categories
indexing set : {U} →{σ∗U} ⊆{U} ,
inverse system of categories : {C(σ∗U)} →{C(U)} .
Similarly we have a map of the inverse system of nerves
{U} →{σ∗U} ,
{nerve C(σ∗U)} →{nerve C(U)} .
Finally we pass to the limit and obtain an automorphism
bV
σ−→bV
of the proﬁnite completion of the homotopy type of V .
Remark: (General Naturality). In this case when σ is an isomor-
phism σ∗is also an isomorphism so that it is clear that σ∗f exists
and is unique.
If σ were a more general morphism, say the inclusion of a subva-
riety
W ,→V

145
then the “smallest neighborhood” concept plays a crucial role.
The elements in C(U) were really “smallest neighborhoods” (see
example 1 in the preceding section – “Intuitive Discussion of the
Etale Homotopy Type”) constructed from the locally ﬁnite locally
directed etale covering U. σ∗U is also locally ﬁnite and locally di-
rected so it has “smallest neighborhoods”, which are the objects of
C(σ∗U).
One can check that
σ∗Uα ⊆σ∗Uβ
σ∗Uα, σ∗Uβ “smallest
neighborhoods” in W
of ωα and ωβ
implies
Uωα ⊆Uωβ
Uωα, Uωβ “smallest
neighborhoods” in V
of ωα and ωβ .
So we have a functor
C(σ∗U) →C(U)
induced by
σ∗Uα 7→Uωα .20
The functor is not canonical, but the induced map on nerves is
well-deﬁned up to homotopy – as in the ˇCech theory.
Lubkin uses an interesting device which enlarges the calculation
scheme restoring canonicity on the map level. We use this device in
the proof about the “real variety conjecture”.
Example V = C −0.
The etale coverings with one element
{Un}
Un

are suﬃcient to describe the etale homotopy.
21For the purpose of the moment we think only of ordinary covers.

146
The associated category is the one object category Z /n – the
self-morphisms form a cyclic group of order n.
Now Un
π−→C−0 is equivalent to C−0 Fn
−−→C−0 where Fn is raising
to the nth power. So

The covering transformations of π are rotations by nth roots of
unity
fξ : z 7→ξz , ξn = 1 .
Now σ∗fξ is deﬁned by
(C −0)

σ∗fξ

(C −0)

or
(σ∗fξ)(zσ) =

This reduces to
σ∗fξ(z) =
¡
fξ(zσ−1)
¢σ
=
¡
ξ · (zσ−1)
¢σ
= ξσ · z
or
σ∗fξ = fξσ .
So if we identify the one object “group” categories C(Un) with
the group of nth roots of unity, the automorphism of C acts on the
category via its action on the roots of unity
ξ 7→ξσ , ξn = 1 .

Algebraic Geometry
147
Notice that the automorphism induced by σ on the etale homo-
topy of C−0 only depends on how σ moves the roots of unity around.
This is not true in general21 however it is true for a general variety
V that the automorphism induced by σ on the etale homotopy of V
only depends on how σ moves the algebraic numbers around.
Roughly speaking eQ, the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers and C are two
algebraically closed ﬁelds containing Q
Q ⊆eQ ⊆C ,
and nothing new happens from the point of view of etale homotopy
in the passage from eQ to C.
So we have the “Galois group of Q”,
Gal (eQ/ Q)
acting naturally on the proﬁnite completion of the homotopy types
of the Grassmannians
Gn,k(C) and “Gn,k(R)” .
¡
“Gn,k(R)” ≡O(n + k, C)/O(n, C) × O(k, C).
¢
The existence of the action is a highly non-trivial fact. The au-
tomorphisms of the ground ﬁeld eQ are very discontinuous when ex-
tended to the complex plane. Thus it is even quite surprising that
this group of automorphisms acts on the (mod n) cohomology of
algebraic varieties (deﬁned over the rationals).22
We have some additional remarks about the Galois action.
i) Many varieties if not deﬁned over Q are deﬁned over some number
ﬁeld – a ﬁnite extension of Q. For such a variety V deﬁned over
K, a subgroup of ﬁnite index in the “Galois group of Q”,
Gal (eQ/K) ⊆Gal (eQ/ Q)
acts on the proﬁnite completion of the homotopy type of V .
21Although it is an open question for the Grassmannians. For partial results see the section
“The Groups generated by Frobenius elements acting on the Finite Grassmannians”.
22I am indebted to G. Washnitzer for explaining this point to me very early in the game.

148
ii) The actions of these proﬁnite Galois groups are continuous with
respect to the natural topology on the homotopy sets
[
, bV ] .
For example, in the case V is deﬁned over Q a particular ﬁnite
etale cover will be deﬁned over a ﬁnite extension of Q.
The
varieties and maps will all have local polynomial expressions using
coeﬃcients in a number ﬁeld L.
The eﬀect of the proﬁnite Galois group is only felt through the
ﬁnite quotient
Gal (L/ Q) .
It follows that the inverse limit action gives homeomorphisms of
the proﬁnite homotopy sets
[
, bV ] .
iii) A consequence of this “ﬁniteness at each level” phenomenon is
that we can assume there is a coﬁnal collection of etale cover-
ings each separately invariant under the Galois group. Thus we
obtain a beautiful preview of the Galois action on the proﬁnite
completion –
an inﬁnite scheme of complexes each with a ﬁnite symmetry and
all these interrelated.

Action of Gal (eQ/ Q) on Cohomology
Gal (eQ/ Q) acts on the multiplicative group of roots of unity con-
tained in eQ.
The full group of automorphisms 23 of the roots of
unity is the group of units bZ
∗. The action of bZ
∗is naturally given
by
ξ 7→ξa , ξn = 1, a ∈bZ
∗.
(ξa means ξk where k is any integer representing the “modulo n”
residue of a ∈bZ
∗.)
This gives a canonical homomorphism
Gal (bQ/ Q)
/
A
&
(Galois group of the
ﬁeld generated by
the roots of unity
)
⊆bZ
∗.
Class ﬁeld theory for Q says that A is onto and the kernel is the
commutator subgroup of Gal (eQ, Q).
The Abelianization A occurs again in the etale homotopy type of
P 1(C).
Proposition 5.3 The induced action of the Galois group Gal (eQ, Q)
on
H2
¡
(P 1(C))ˆ; Z

is (after Abelianization) the natural action of bZ
∗on bZ.
Proof:
Consider the etale map V →P 1(C),
V = C∗−−−→
z→zn C∗≡C −0 ⊆P 1(C) .
The covering group is generated by
z 7→ξz where ξn = 1 .

Let σ be a ﬁeld automorphism of eQ. We saw in the example of
the preceding section that the action of σ corresponds to the action
of σ on the roots of unity
covering map ξ →covering map ξ .
We apply this calculation to the system of etale covers of P 1(C)

The automorphism determined by σ on the entire system of etale
covers of P 1(C) is “homotopic” to an automorphism of the coﬁnal
subsystem {Cn}. The above calculation24 shows this automorphism
of {Cn} is
i) the identity on objects,
ii) sends ξ 7→ξσ, ξ ∈Z /n, for maps.
The realization or nerve of the covering category Cn is
suspension K(Z /n, 1)
with 2-dimensional homology Z /n.

is built up from its action on the nth roots of unity. This is what we
wanted to prove.
Remark: One should notice the philosophically important point
that the algebraic variety P 1(C) does not have a canonical fun-
damental homology class. The algebraic automorphisms of P 1(C)
permute the possible generators freely.
The topology of the complex numbers determines a choice of ori-
entation up to sign. The choice of a primitive fourth root of unity
determines the sign.
Conversely, as we shall see in a later Chapter (the Galois group
in geometric topology) and in a later paper, choosing a K-theory
orientation on a proﬁnite homotopy type satisfying Poincar´e Duality
corresponds exactly to imposing a “homeomorphism class of non-
singular topological structures” on the homotopy type25.
Corollary 5.4 The induced action of G = Gal (eQ/ Q) on
H∗¡
(P n(C))ˆ; bZ
¢ ∼= bZ[x]/(xn+1 = 0)
is (via Abelianization) the natural action of bZ

determined by
i) the action on H∗(BSOn; Z /2) is trivial.

Remark: The nice action of Gal (eQ/ Q) in the cohomology is related
to some interesting questions and conjectures.
For each p there is a class of elements in Gal (eQ/ Q) representing
the Frobenius automorphism in characteristic p, x 7→xp.
Let Fp
denote one of these.
In our Grassmannian case Fp acts on the q-adic part of the coho-
mology by
ci 7→pici ,
ci ∈H2i(
, bZq) .
The famous Riemann Hypothesis in characteristic p – the remain-
ing unproved Weil conjecture26 – asserts that for a large class of
varieties27 Fp acts on the cohomology in a “similar fashion” –
the action of Fp on the q-adic cohomology in dimension k has
eigenvalues (if we embed bZq in an algebraically closed ﬁeld) which
a) lie in the integers of a ﬁnite extension of Q ,
b) are independent of q ̸= p ,
c) have absolute value pk/2 .
In our Grassmannian case the cohomology only appears in even
dimensions, the eigenvalues are rational integers (pi if k = 2i).

154
This simpliﬁcation comes from the fact that the cohomology of
the Grassmannians is generated by algebraic cycles (also in charac-
teristic p) – the Schubert subvarieties,
Sk
i,→G .
(k = complex dimension)
Looking at homology and naturality then implies
Fp (i∗Sk) = i∗Fp Sk in homology
= i∗pkSk
= pki∗Sk
(the second equation follows since the top dimensional homology
group is cyclic for Sk – the value of the eigenvalue can be checked
in the neighborhood of a point).
Tate conjectures28 a beautiful converse to this situation – roughly,
eigenvectors of the action of Fp in the bZq-cohomology for all q cor-
respond to algebraic subvarieties (in characteristic p).
The action of Gal (eQ/ Q) on K-theory, the Adams Op-
erations, and the “linear” Adams Conjecture
Gal (eQ/ Q) also acts on the homotopy types
BUˆ = lim
n→∞(BUn)ˆ
(inﬁnite mapping cylinder)
BOˆ = lim
n→∞(BOn)ˆ
since it acts at each level n.
These homotopy types classify the group theoretic proﬁnite com-
pletions of reduced K-theory,

eKO(X)ˆ ∼= [X, BOˆ]
for X a ﬁnite dimensional complex.

eKU(X)ˆ ≡

eKU(ﬁnite subcomplex)ˆ ∼= [X, BUˆ] .
Thus for any space X we have an action of Gal (eQ/ Q) on the
proﬁnite K-theory (real or complex)
K(X)ˆ.
In the original K-theories, we have the beautiful operations of
Adams,

,
ii) ψk is an endomorphism of the ring K(X),
iii) ψk ◦ψl = ψkl.
ψk is deﬁned by forming the Newton polynomial in the exterior
powers of a vector bundle. For example,
ψ1V = ΛV = V
ψ2V = V ⊗V −2Λ2V
...

p (before redeﬁnition) was topologically nilpo-
tent, the powers of (ψk)ˆ
p converge to the zero operation on the re-
duced group
eK(X)ˆ, for k ≡0 (mod p) .
One of our main desires is to study the ubiquitous nature of the
“isomorphic part” of the Adams operations.
For example, recall the Abelianization homomorphism
G = Gal (eQ/ Q) →bZ
∗
obtained by letting G act on the roots of unity.
Theorem 5.7 The natural action of Gal (eQ/ Q) in proﬁnite K-theory

Thus – if we think in terms of homotopy equivalences of the “alge-
braic varieties”
BU = lim
→
n,k
Gn,k(C) ,
BO = lim
→
n,k
“Gn,k(R)”
we see that the “isomorphic part” of the Adams operation is com-
patible with the natural action of
Gal (eQ/ Q)
in the category of proﬁnite homotopy types and maps coming from
algebraic varieties deﬁned over Q.
Remark. We must restrict ourselves to the “isomorphic part” of the
Adams operation to make this “algebraic” extension to the Adams
operations to the Grassmannians and other varieties. For example,
Proposition 5.8 ψ2 cannot be deﬁned on the 2-adic completion
G2,n(C)ˆ
2 , n large ,
so that it is compatible with the nilpotent operation
ψ2 on (BU)ˆ
2 .
We give the proof below. It turns out the proof suggests a way
to construct some interesting new maps of quaternionic projective
space.
We recall that an element γ in K(X)ˆ has a stable ﬁbre homotopy
type, for example in the real case the composition
X →BOˆ −−−−−→
natural
map
BGˆ ∼= BG .
Corollary 5.9 (Adams Conjecture). For any space X, the stable
ﬁbre homotopy type of an element in
K(X)ˆ
(real or complex)
is invariant under the action of the Galois group
bZ
∗= Abelianized Gal (eQ/ Q)

158
and therefore under the action of the “isomorphic part” of the
Adams operations.
Proof of Corollary 5.9: We have ﬁltered the homotopy equiva-
lences of
(BU)ˆ or (BSO)ˆ
corresponding to the elements of the Galois group by homotopy
equivalences of
(BUn)ˆ or (BSOn)ˆ
(corresponding to elements in the Galois group).

For the real case we only have to add the remark that the natural
map
BOˆ →BG
canonically factors
(BSOˆ →BSG) × (R P∞identity
−−−−−→R P∞) ,
and α restricted to R P∞is the identity. Q. E. D.

Note: If we apply this to a ﬁnite complex X, recall that
[X, BG] ∼=
Y
l
[X, (BG)ˆ
l] ∼= product of ﬁnite l-groups .
Thus ψkx −x determines an element in
[X, BG]
which is concentrated in the p-components for p dividing k. This
gives the conjectured assertion of Adams – “the element
khigh power(ψkx −x), x ∈K(X)
determines a trivial element in
J(X) ⊆[X, BG] . ”
Note: The proof of the Inertia Lemma simpliﬁes in these vector
bundle cases – for example, the stable bundles

is “exactly intrinsic” to the ﬁltration {BOn}. Namely,
ﬁbre →BOn−1 →BOn
is ﬁbre homotopy equivalent to canonical spherical ﬁbration over
BOn
Sn−1 →
(total space of
spherical
ﬁbration

→BOn .
Thus the skeletal approximations used in that proof are not needed.
Furthermore, the proof then gives a much stronger result than the
“classical Adams Conjecture”. We obtain homotopy commutativi-
ties at each unstable level

In the next section we study certain α’s by bringing in certain
primes. This gives Frobenius operations on various p-adic compo-
nents of the proﬁnite theory of n-dimensional vector bundles
[
, (BOn)ˆ] .

160
In a later Chapter we relate the action of the Galois group on
n-dimensional proﬁnite vector bundle theory to Galois actions on
the analogous piecewise linear theory, topological theory, and the
oriented spherical ﬁbration theory. These are the Adams phenomena
whose study inspired the somewhat extensive homotopy discussion
of the earlier Chapters.
This discussion also yields the more natural statement of Corol-
lary 5.9.
However, the Adams Conjecture for odd primes29 was proved
much earlier (August 1967) in Adams’ formulation using only the
existence of an algebraically deﬁned “space-like” object having the
mod n cohomology of the complex Grassmannians plus an awkward
cohomology argument with these space-like objects.
The use of etale homotopy at this time was inspired by Quillen –
who was rumored to have an outline proof of the complex Adams
conjecture “using algebraic geometry”.
The “2-adic Adams Conjecture” came much later (January 1970)
when a psychological block about considering non-projective vari-
eties was removed30. Thus
Gn,k(R)
∼
homotopy
equivalent
On+k(C)/On(C) × Ok(C)
could be treated.
The ﬁnal section describes an intermediate attempt to treat real
varieties directly. This was to be the ﬁrst half of a hoped for proof
of the 2-adic Adams Conjecture, the second half (required by lack
of Galois symmetry) would depend on a step like that used in the
next section and the simple structure of the cohomology of the com-
mutator subgroup of Gal (eQ/ Q).
Note (Higher order operations in K-theory) As in ordinary coho-
mology one can obtain secondary operations in K-theory by measur-
ing the failure on the “cocycle level” of relations between operations
on the “cohomology class level”.

Thus the relation
ψ2 ◦ψ3 = ψ3 ◦ψ2
leads to a secondary operation in K-theory (Anderson). If we think
of maps into BUˆ as cocycles we have a representative
lim
→
n,k
¡
the etale type of Gn,k(C)
¢
on which Gal (eQ/ Q) acts by homeomorphisms.
Thus one can imagine that secondary operations are deﬁned on
the commutator subgroup of the Galois group – the elements in here
correspond to the homotopies giving the relations among Adams
operations.
Furthermore, if in some space like K(π, 1), π ﬁnite, the K-theory
is generated by bundles deﬁned over the ﬁeld, AQ, “Q with the roots
of unity adjoined” the secondary operations should give zero. For
example
ψ2 ◦ψ3 = ψ3 ◦ψ2
holds on the “level of cocycles” for a generating set of bundles over
K(π, 1).
(We recall that for K(π, 1), π ﬁnite, the homomorphisms of π into
GL (n, C) which factor through GL (n, AQ) generate the K-theory of
K(π, 1) topologically.)
Proof of 5.7: Let B denote BSO or BU.
Claim: two maps
bB
α
→
→
β
bB
are homotopic iﬀthey “agree” on the “cohomology groups”, H∗( bB; bZ)⊗
Q.
Assuming this we can deduce the Theorem –
ﬁrst the calculations of the preceding section (Corollary 5.5 and
5.6) show that G is acting on cohomology through its Abelianization.
Thus in the complex case we are done –

162
bZ
∗acts on complex K-theory and “µk ∈bZ
∗” and “isomorphic part
of ψk” agree on the cohomology of BUˆ (see note below). Thus the
action of µk agrees with that of ψk (see note below).
In the real case, recall that BO naturally splits
BO ∼= BSO × R P∞
using the “algebraic maps”
R P∞∼= BO(1, C) →lim
−→
n
BO(n, C) ∼= BO ,
BSO ∼= lim
−→
n
BSO(n, C) →lim
−→
n
BO(n, C) ∼= BO
and the “algebraic” Whitney sum operation in BO,
lim
→(BOn × BOn →BO2n) .
Thus the homotopy equivalences of BOˆ corresponding to the el-
ements in the Galois group naturally split.
The same is true for ψk. This uses
ψk (line bundle) = line bundle ,
ψk (oriented bundle) = oriented bundle ,
ψk is additive .
A homotopy equivalence of R P∞must be homotopic to the iden-
tity so we are reduced to studying maps
BSOˆ →BSOˆ.
Our claim and the previous calculations then show that bZ
∗acts
in real K-theory (the elements of order two all act trivially,
tp ∈Z /(p −1) ⊕bZp = bZ

t2 ∈Z /2 ⊕bZ2 = bZ

and ψk corresponds to the action of µk.
Note: One can repeat the arguments of the previous section to see

163
the eﬀect of ψk on the cohomology – the properties
ψk(η) = ηk
η line bundle ,
ψk additive ,
ψk commutes with complexiﬁcation
are all that are needed to do this.
We are reduced to proving the claim.
For the case BUˆ or BSOˆ away from 2 a simple obstruction theory
argument proves this. For completeness we must take another tack.
We concentrate on the case B = BSO.
It follows from work of Anderson and Atiyah that the group
[B, B]
i) is an inverse limit over the ﬁnite subcomplexes Bα of the ﬁnitely
generated groups [Bα, B].
ii) There is a “cohomology injection”
[B, B]

H4i(B; Q) .
We claim that B can be replaced by bB and ii) is still true.

0 →Tα →[Bα, B]
(ph)α
−−−→
Y
i=1
H4i(Bα; Q)
is exact. If we pass to the inverse limit (ph)α becomes an injection
so

Tα = 0 .
So we tensor with bZ and pass to the limit again. Then since

This proves our claim and the Theorem.
Proof of Proposition 5.8. We ﬁrst note a construction for “Adams
operations on quaternionic line bundles and complex 2-plane bun-
dles”.
Suppose “ψp is deﬁned” in (BU2)ˆp.31
Now ψp is deﬁned on (BU2)ˆq q ̸= p by choosing some lifting of
µp ∈bZ
∗to the Galois group Gal (bQ/ Q). Putting these ψp together
gives ψp on
(BU2)ˆ =
Y
p
(BU2)ˆp .
ψp can be easily deﬁned on the localization,
(BU2)0 = K(Q , 2) × K(Q , 4) .
Thus ψp is deﬁned on BU2, the ﬁbre product of (BU2)0, (BU2)ˆ,
and (B bU2)0 ∼= K(Q ⊗bZ, 2) × K(Q ⊗bZ, 4).
This operation has to be compatible (by a cohomology argument)
with the map BU2
c1
−→BU1 ∼= K(Z , 2). Thus ψp is deﬁned on the
31“ψp is deﬁned” means an operation compatible under the natural inclusions into K-theory
with the original Adams operation.

165
ﬁbre,
BSU2 ∼= BS3 ∼= “inﬁnite quaternionic projective space” .
For p = 2 we obtain a contradiction, there is not even a map of
the quaternionic plane extending the degree four map of
H P1 ∼= S4 .32
Thus ψ2 cannot be deﬁned on a very large skeleton of (BU2)ˆ
2.
Since BU2 is approximated by G2,n(C) this proves the proposition.
For p > 2 we obtain the
Corollary 5.10 For self maps of the inﬁnite quaternionic projec-
tive space the possible degrees on S4 ∼= H P1 are precisely zero and
the odd squares.
Proof: The restriction on the degree was established by various
workers.
(I. Berstein proved the degree is a square using complex K-theory,
R. Stong and L. Smith reproved this using Steenrod operations,
G. Cooke proved the degree was zero or an odd square using real
K-theory.)
We provide the maps. From the above we see that it suﬃces to
ﬁnd
ψp on (BU2)ˆp ,
p > 2 .
This follows by looking at the normalizer of the torus in U2,
N : 1 →S1 × S1 →N →Z /2 →1 .
Z /2 acts by the ﬂip of coordinates in S1 × S1.
Consider the diagram of classifying spaces
BS1 × BS1
/ BN
j
²
/ R P∞
BU2
.
32A cell argument (Arkowitz and Curjel) or a transversality argument plus the signature
formula shows the degree would have to satisfy a congruence ruling out degree 4, d(d−1) ≡0
(mod 24).

166
The horizontal ﬁbration shows for p > 2
H∗(BN; Z /p) ∼= invariant cohomology of BS1 × BS1 .
Thus j is an isomorphism of cohomology mod p. Sine π1BN =
Z /2, j becomes an isomorphism upon p-adic completion,
(BU2)ˆp ∼= (BN)ˆp .
Now N has a natural endomorphism induced by raising to the kth
power on the torus. Thus BN has self maps ψk for all k. These give
ψk for all k on (BU2)ˆp, in particular we have ψp.
The proof actually shows
(BUn)ˆp ∼=
¡
B(normalizer of torus)
¢ˆ
p , p > n .
So we have
Corollary 5.11 ψp exists in BUn and BSUn for n < p.
Remark: For n > 1, these give the ﬁrst examples of maps of classi-
fying spaces of compact connected Lie groups which are not induced
by homomorphisms of the Lie groups. (SU2 = S3 is fairly easy to
check). This was a question raised by P. Baum.
Conjecture: ψp does not exist in BUp.
Remark: It is tempting to note a further point. The equivalence
(BUn)ˆp ∼=
¡
B(normalizer T n)
¢ˆ
p
can be combined with the spherical topological groups of Chapter 4
to construct exotic “p-adic analogues of Un”.
Namely
B(normalizer T n) =
¡ n
Y
i=1
BS1 × EΣn
¢
/Σn
where Σn is the symmetric group of degree n and EΣn is a con-
tractible space on which Σn acts freely.
So consider for λ dividing p −1,

For λ = 1 we get the p-adic part of unitary groups up to degree
p −1. For λ = 2 we get the p-adic part of the symplectic groups up
to degree p−1. For λ another divisor we obtain “ﬁnite dimensional”
groups (p-adic). (All this in the homotopy category.)
The Groups generated by Frobenius elements acting
on the Finite Grassmannians
We saw in the previous section that the action of Gal (eQ/ Q) was
Abelian in the proﬁnite K-theory – this action being densely popu-
lated by the “isomorphic part of the Adams operations”.

This Galois symmetry in the inﬁnite Grassmannians is compatible

The action on cohomology Abelianizes as we have seen so it is
natural to ask to what extent the “homotopy representation” of
Gal (eQ/ Q) Abelianizes.
We can further ask (assuming some Abelianization takes place)
whether or not there are natural elements (like the Adams operations
in the inﬁnite Grassmannian case) generating the action.
We note for the ﬁrst question that this is a homotopy problem
of a diﬀerent order of magnitude than that presented by the cal-
culations of the last section. There is no real theory34 for proving
the existence of homotopies, between maps into such spaces as ﬁnite
Grassmannians,
X
f
→
→
g
(ﬁnite Grassmannian)ˆ.
One has to construct the homotopies or nothing. In this case the
ﬁrst part of the construction depends on arithmetic properties of
the equations deﬁning the Grassmannians. The second part comes
essentially from the contractibility of
¡
K(π, 1)
¢ˆ
p
where π is a non-p group.
Thus these considerations must be sifted through the sieve of
primes.
We do this by considering only one p-adic component of
the proﬁnite completion of the ﬁnite Grassmannians.
34Besides the “tautological bundle theory”.

However at the ﬁnite level we don’t know if the diﬀerent Frobenius

q converge p-adically to another prime l does
(q-Frobenius)n →(l-Frobenius)
in the proﬁnite group
π(p-adic ﬁnite Grassmannian) ?
It seems an interesting question – this compatibility of the diﬀer-
ent Frobenius operations on the ﬁnite Grassmannians. The group
they generate might be anywhere between an inﬁnite free product
of bZ
∗
p’s and one bZ
∗
p. The answer depends on the geometric question
of ﬁnding suﬃciently many etale covers of these Grassmannians to
describe the etale homotopy. Then one examines the ﬁeld extensions
of Q required to deﬁne these, their Galois groups, and the covering
groups to discover commutativity or non-commutativity relations
between the diﬀerent homotopy Frobenius operations. The “intu-
itive” examples above35 and the “nilpotent” restriction of the last
Chapter imply that “non-Abelian groups have to enter somewhere”.
35The categories of projective spaces.

170
The simplest non-commutative Galois group G that might enter
into this question36 is that for the ﬁeld extension of Q obtained by
adjoining the “pth roots of p”, the twisted extension
1 →Fp →G →F ∗
p →1
Fp the prime ﬁeld.
We close this summary with the remark that the arithmetic of the
deﬁning equations of O(n, C) (as we understand it) forces us to omit
the case q = 2, p odd for some of the ﬁnite (odd) real Grassmannians.
This omission provides a good illustration of the arithmetic in-
volved. We describe the situation in Addendum 1.
The essential ingredients of the Theorem are described in Adden-
dum 2.
We describe the Theorem.
The Galois group Gal (eQ/ Q) contains inﬁnitely many (conjugacy
classes of) subgroups
“decomposition group” = Gq “⊆” Gal (eQ/ Q) .
Gq is constructed from an algebraic closure of the q-adic completion
of Q. Gq has as quotient the Galois group of the algebraic closure
of Fq,
Gq

Theorem 5.12 For each prime q37 not equal to p there is a natural
36Informal oral communication from J. Tate.
37We make certain exceptions for q = 2, p odd in the real case. These are discussed below.
Note these exceptions do not aﬀect the study of the “2-adic real Grassmannians”.

The image of the canonical generator Frobenius in bZ gives a canon-

tor bundles with a ﬁxed ﬁbre dimension and codimension.
Caution: As discussed above we do not know that
ψq ◦ψl = ψl ◦ψq .
However we are saying that the subgroup generated by a single ψq
is ‘correct’, Uq ⊆bZ
∗
p.
Proof: First one constructs an algebraic closure of the q-adic num-
bers Qq which has Galois group Gq and contains (non-canonically)
the algebraic closure eQ of Q. Then Gq acts on Q and we have a map
Gq →G = Gal (eQ/ Q) .
This map is deﬁned up to conjugation and is an injection. Gq also
acts on the integers in this extension of Qq and their reductions
modulo q which make up eFq the algebraic closure of the prime ﬁeld.
Thus we have a map
Gq →bZ = Gal ( eFq/Fq) .
The bZ has a canonical generator, the Frobenius for the prime q;
and the map is a surjection.38
38I am indebted to Barry Mazur for explaining this situation and its connection to etale
homotopy.

Now Artin and Mazur show under certain circumstances that the
p-adic part of the etale homotopy type of the variety can be con-
structed just from the variety reduced modulo q, q ̸= p. For example,
for complex Grassmannians it is enough to observe that the deﬁni-
tion of “the Grassmannian in characteristic q” gives a non-singular
variety of the same dimension –
GL (n + k, eFq)/ GL (n, eFq) × GL (k, eFq)
is non-singular and has dimension 2nk.
In this (good reduction mod q) case it follows from Artin-Mazur
that the action of Gal (eQ/ Q) restricted to Gq factors through an
action of bZ generated by the Frobenius at q,

as desired.
Now the action of bZ (and therefore π) is built up from an inverse
system of actions on simply connected nerves39 on which π is acting
via cellular homeomorphisms.
In each nerve Nα the action factors through the action of a ﬁnite
Galois quotient group πα.
Let Eα denote the universal cover of
K(πα, 1) and form the new inverse system
{N′
α} = {(Nα × Eα)/πα} .
We have a ﬁbration sequence
Nα →N′
α →K(πα, 1)
of spaces with ﬁnite homotopy groups. We can form the homotopy
theoretical inverse limit as in Chapter 3 to obtain the ﬁbration se-
quence
X →X′ π−→K(π, 1) .
The action of π on the mod p cohomology of the ﬁbre is trivial
by construction. Also, the mod p cohomology of π is trivial – for we

is a homotopy equivalence. This means that π × c gives an equiva-
lence
X′ π×c
−−→X × K(π, 1) .
The action of π was trivial in X′ by construction. It follows from
X′ ∼= X × K(π, 1)
that the action is homotopy trivial in X. This is what we set out to
prove.
Remark: From the proof one can extract an interesting homotopy
theoretical fact which we roughly paraphrase – if a map
X
f−→X
is part of a “transformation group” π acting on X where
i) the mod p cohomology of π is trivial,
ii) π acts trivially on the mod p cohomology of X,
then f is homotopic to the identity on the p-adic component of X.
Addendum 1. In the case of the real Grassmannians we sometimes
exclude q = 2 for p odd. The reason is that our description of the
complex orthogonal group
O(n, C) ⊆GL (n, C)
used the form
x2
1 + x2
2 + · · · + x2
n .
In characteristic q = 2
x2
1 + · · · + x2
n = (x1 + · · · + xn)2 .
So the subgroup of GL (n, Fq) preserving x2
1 + · · · + x2
n can also be
described as the subgroup preserving the linear functional x1 + · · · +

Algebraic Geometry
175
xn. This deﬁnes a subgroup which is “more like GL (n −1)” than
the orthogonal group. It has dimension n2 −n instead of 1
2n(n −1)
so our description of O(n, C) does not reduce well mod 2.
We can alter the description of the complex orthogonal group for
n = 2k. Consider the subgroup of GL (n, C) preserving the “split
form”
x1x2 + x3x4 + · · · + x2k−1x2k .
This deﬁnes a conjugate subgroup
O(n, C) ⊆GL (n, C) .
This description reduces well modulo 2 – the dimension of this
subgroup of GL (n, eFq) is 1
2n(n −1).
Thus, we can include the cases of the “even” real Grassmannians
eG2n,2k(R) = SO(2n + 2k, C)/SO(2n, C) × SO(2k, C)
for q = 2 in Theorem 5.12.
For example,
BSO2n =

eG2n,2k(R)
is included for q = 2.
BSO2n+1 may also be included for q = 2 using the following device.

BSO2n+1 →BU2n+1 →B1 →(B1)ˆ
p
is p-proﬁnite completion. Here B1 may be described in either of two
ways –
i) B1 = (BU2n+1 × S∞)/(Z /2) where Z /2 acts by
complex conjugation × antipodal map ,
ii) (B1)ˆ is the limit of the etale homotopy types of the “real Grass-
mannians”

(For a further discussion of this see the next section.)
So the subgroup of bZ

p generated by 2 acts on the homotopy type
(BSO2n+1)ˆp
via its action on (BU2n+1)ˆp.
In all cases (p = 2, 3, 5, . . . ), the element of order 2 in bZ

responds to complex conjugation and acts trivially on the p-adic
component of the homotopy type of the real Grassmannians.
Addendum 2. We might indicate the essential ingredients of the
proof.
Suppose V is any variety deﬁned over Q. If the cohomology of
V is generated by algebraic cycles then the action of Gal (eQ/ Q) on
the cohomology (which then only occurs in even dimensions) factors
through its Abelianization bZ
∗.
If V can be reduced well mod q the action of Gal (eQ/ Q) restricted
to Gq simpliﬁes to a bZ action.
This action of bZ can then be further simpliﬁed to a Uq ⊆bZ

The etale homotopy of real varieties – a topological
conjecture
Suppose the complex algebraic variety VC can be deﬁned over the
real numbers R – the equations deﬁning VC can be chosen to have
real coeﬃcients. Let |VR| denote the variety (possibly vacuous) of
real solutions to these equations.
VC has a natural involution c, complex conjugation, induced lo-
cally by
(x0, x1, . . . , xn)
c7→(¯x0, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xn) .
c is an algebraic homeomorphism of V with ﬁxed points |VR|.
A natural question is – can one describe some aspect of the ho-
motopy type of the real variety |VR| algebraically?

Algebraic Geometry
177
We have the etale homotopy type of the complex points VC,Vet,
and Vet has an involution σ corresponding to complex conjugation
in VC. The pair (Vet, σ) is an algebraically constructed homotopy
model of the geometric pair (VC, conjugation).
Thus we are led to consider the related question of “geometric
homotopy theory” –
What aspect of the homotopy type of the ﬁxed points F of an
involution t on a ﬁnite dimensional locally compact space X can be
recovered from some homotopy model of the involution?
In the examples of Chapter 1 we saw how certain 2-adic comple-
tions of the cohomology or the K-theory of the ﬁxed points could
be recovered from the associated “ﬁxed point free involution”
(X′, t′) ≡(X × S∞, t × antipodal map) ,
S∞= inﬁnite sphere
with orbit space
Xt = X′/(x ∼t′x) ≡X × S∞/(Z /2) .
Now (X′, t′) is a good homotopy model of the geometric involution
(X, t). For example, the projection on the second factor leads to the
useful ﬁbration
X ∼= X′ →Xt →R P∞≡S∞/antipodal .
Let (geometric, Z /2) denote the category of locally compact ﬁnite
dimensional topological spaces with involution and equivariant maps
between them. let (homotopy, free Z /2) denote the category of CW
complexes with involution and homotopy classes of equivariant maps
between them.
We have two constructions for objects in (geometric, Z /2):
a) the geometric operation of taking ﬁxed points,
b) the homotopy theoretical operation of passing to the associated
free involution
(X′, t′) = (X × S∞, t × antipodal) .

178
These can be compared in a diagram

Our basic question then becomes – can we make a construction
F, “the homotopy theoretical ﬁxed points of a ﬁxed point free invo-
lution”, so that the above square commutes?
Note we should only ask for the 2-adic part of the homotopy
type of the ﬁxed point set.
This is natural in light of the above
examples in cohomology and K-theory. Also examples of involutions
on spheres show the odd primary part of the homotopy type of the
ﬁxed points can vary while the equivariant homotopy type of the
homotopy model (X′, t′) stays constant.
There is a natural candidate for the homotopy theoretical ﬁxed
points. We make an analogy with the geometric case – in (geometric, Z /2)
the ﬁxed points of (X, t) are obtained by taking the space
{equivariant maps (point →X)} .
In (homotopy, free Z /2), the role of a point should be played by
any contractible CW complex with free involution, for example S∞
– the inﬁnite sphere.
Definition. If X is a CW complex with an involution t deﬁne the
homotopy theoretical ﬁxed points F of (X, t) by
F(X, t) =
·
singular complex of
equivariant maps
(S∞→X)
¸
.
We list a few easy properties of F:
i) F(S∞, antipodal map) is contractible (≃point).
ii) F(X, t) ≃F(X′, t′).
iii) F(X × X, ﬂip) ≃X.

Algebraic Geometry
179
iv) F(X′, t′) ≃singular complex of cross sections (Xt →P ∞(R))
(generalization of i).)
We make the

Paraphrase – “We can make a homotopy theoretical recovery of
the 2-adic homotopy type of the geometric ﬁxed point set from the
associated (homotopy theoretical) ﬁxed point free involution”.
One can say a little about the question.
i) The conjecture is true for the natural involution on X × X – this
follows by direct calculation – property iii) above.
ii) The conjecture is true if the set of ﬁxed points of X is vacuous –
for then Xt is cohomologically ﬁnite dimensional. So there are no
cross sections on Xt →R P∞. (This has the interesting Corollary
E below.)
iii) If the involution is trivial – the ﬁxed points are all of X. However,
the homotopy ﬁxed points is the space of all maps of R P∞into
X. For these to agree 2-adically it must be true that the space

180
of all based maps of R P∞into a ﬁnite dimensional space X is
contractible. 40
iv) The latter conjecture seems quite diﬃcult from a direct point of
view. The ﬁxed point conjecture seems to hinge on it –
In fact suppose (X, t) is a smooth manifold with smooth involu-
tion with ﬁxed submanifold F – say F connected.
Let ν denote the projectivized normal bundle of F, then one can
determine that
Xt ∼= F × R P∞∪ν (X −F)/(x ∼tx)
where
ν →(X −F)/(x ∼tx) is the natural inclusion ,
ν →F × R P∞is the
(projection onto F) × (canonical line bundle over ν)
F × RP ∞
ν
closure of
ﬁnite dimensional
image of X −F
in Xt
The conjecture of iii) indicates that any map of R P∞into Xt cannot
involve the “locally compact part of Xt” too seriously so we need
only consider maps into the inﬁnite part of F × R P∞. Applying the
conjecture of iii) again gives the result.
40This is the original formulation of the conjecture which was subsequently solved by Haynes
Miller, The Sullivan conjecture on maps from classifying spaces, Ann. of Maths. 120, 39–87
(1984).

The Real Etale Conjecture
Let us return to the original question about the homotopy of real
algebraic varieties.
Let (X, t) denote the etale homotopy type of the complex points
with involution corresponding to complex conjugation.
We ﬁrst
think of (X, t) as approximated by an inverse system of complexes
Xα each with its own involution.
We can do this by restricting
attention to the coﬁnal collection of etale covers of VC which are
invariant (though not ﬁxed) by conjugation.
We form the ﬁbration sequence
Xα →Xα
t →P ∞(R) (= R P∞)
and pass to limit to obtain the complete ﬁbration sequence
X →Xt →P ∞(R) .
This sequence has a direct algebraic description.
To say that a variety VR is deﬁned over R means that we have a
scheme built from the spectra of ﬁnite R-algebras. We have a map
VR →Spec R .
The complex variety VC is the ﬁbre product of natural diagrams
VR
²
Spec C
/ Spec R .
Applying the complete etale homotopy functor gives a ﬁbre prod-
uct square
X
²
/ etale homotopy type
²
∗
/ etale homotopy type
(VR)
Spec R = K(Z /2, 1) ,
i.e. the sequence
X →Xt →P ∞(R) .

182
Thus we can conjecture three equivalent descriptions of the 2-adic
homotopy type of the variety of real points |VR| –
i) The 2-adic completion of the space of equivariant maps of the
inﬁnite sphere into the etale homotopy type of the associated
complex variety. (We ﬁrst form the inverse system of equivariant
maps into each nerve in the system, then 2-adically complete and
form a homotopy theoretical inverse limit as in Chapter 3).
ii) The space of cross sections of the etale realization of the deﬁning
map
VR →Spec R .
(Again complete the etale homotopy type of VR. We get a map
of CW complexes
Xt →P ∞(R) .
Then take the singular complex of cross sections and 2-adically
complete this.)
Note: This last description is analogous to the deﬁnition of the
“geometric real points”: a real point of VR is an R-morphism
Spec R →VR ,
namely, a “cross section” of the deﬁning map
VR →Spec R .
iii) A set of components of the space of all maps
{etale type (Spec R) →etale type (VR)}
2-adically completed.
(The space of cross sections of
Xt →R P∞= etale type (Spec R)
may be described (up to homotopy) as the subset of the function
space of all maps
{R P∞→Xt}
consisting of those components which project to the non-trivial
homotopy class of maps of R P∞to R P∞.
This description is
perhaps easier to compute theoretically.)

Algebraic Geometry
183
We ﬁrst prove a subjunctive theorem and then some declarative
corollaries.
Theorem 5.13 The topological ﬁxed point conjecture implies the
above etale descriptions of the 2-adic homotopy type of a real vari-
ety are correct.
Proof: Let Un be a linearly ordered inverse system of locally di-
rected, ﬁnite etale covers of the variety of complex points VC so that
i) Un is invariant by complex conjugation,
ii) Vˆ
C ∼= lim
←−
n
nerve C(Un) where the nerve of the category of smallest
neighborhoods is as discussed above.
However instead of using the little category C(U) discussed above
use the (larger) homotopy equivalent category C(U, V ) (introduce
labels).
Ux is an object of C(U, V ) if “Ux is a smallest neighborhood of x”.
The morphisms are the same diagrams as before
Ux

– we ignore the “labels” x and y.
Enlarging the category like this makes the map between nerves
nerve C(U1, V ) →nerve C(U, V )
canonical if U1 reﬁnes U.
Inductively choose a linearly ordered system of locally directed
ﬁnite topological coverings Vn so that
i) Vn reﬁnes Un and Vi for i < n
each V ∈Vn is contractible.
ii) V is invariant by conjugation.

184
Then we have a canonical diagram of equivariant maps

To construct fn we assume as above for each n that VC is triangu-
lated so that
i) complex conjugation is piecewise linear,
ii) VC −Uα is a subcomplex, Uα ∈Vn.
¢
By the proposition above each fn is an equivalence.
By etale
homotopy theory the right hand column converges to the proﬁnite
completion of VC.
From this it follows that the proﬁnite completion of the map
VC × S∞/(Z /2) t−→R P∞
is equivalent to

or,

.
Thus the 2-adic completion of the space of cross sections of these
maps agree. The topological ﬁxed point conjecture asserts we obtain
the 2-adic completion of the homotopy type of the real points in the
ﬁrst instance. This proves the Theorem.
The proof does show that some aspect of the cohomology and K-
theory of a ‘real variety’ |VR| can be described algebraically.

Cohomology: Let R denote the “cohomology ring of Z /2”,

The Z /2 etale cohomology of VR is a module over R – using the

THE GALOIS GROUP IN GEOMETRIC
TOPOLOGY
We combine the Galois phenomena of the previous Chapter with
the phenomenon of geometric periodicity that occurs in the the-
ory of manifolds. We ﬁnd that the Abelianized Galois group acts
compatibly on the completions of Grassmannians of k-dimensional
piecewise linear subspaces of R∞.
We study this symmetry in the theory of piecewise linear bundles
and other related geometric theories.
To motivate this study consider the problem of understanding
what invariants determine a compact manifold.
There is the underlying homotopy type plus some extra geometric
invariant. In fact deﬁne a map

.
With the appropriate deﬁnitions and hypotheses ∆is an injection
and the “equations deﬁning the image” are almost determined.
We remark that the notion of isomorphism on the right is some-
what subtle – we should have a diagram

²
M

187

188
g is any homotopy equivalence between the underlying homotopy
types M and L and dg is a bundle isomorphism of the “tangent
bundles” TM and TL which is properly homotopic to the homotopy
theoretical derivative of g, a naturally deﬁned proper ﬁbre homotopy
equivalence between TM and TL.1
So to understand manifolds we must understand bundles, bundle
isomorphisms, and deformations of ﬁbre homotopy equivalences to
bundle isomorphisms.
There are questions of a homotopy theoretical nature which we
can decompose and arithmetize according to the scheme of Chapters
two and three. (We pursue this more strenuously in a sequel.)
It turns out that the odd primary components of the piecewise
linear or topological questions have a surprisingly beautiful struc-
ture – with Galois symmetry and four-fold periodicity in harmonic
accord.
Piecewise linear bundles
Consider a “block of homeomorphisms”,
f
σ × Rn →σ × Rn.
σ a simplex
f satisﬁes
i) f is a piecewise linear homeomorphism which ﬁxes the zero sec-
tion σ × {0},
ii) for every face τ < σ, f keeps τ × Rn invariant, “f preserves the
blocks”.
This deﬁnes a simplex of the piecewise linear group PLn.
1See Sullivan, 1966 Princeton Thesis for a deﬁnition of dg.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
189
This group determines a theory of “Rn-block bundles”,
E
B
blocks
we have a “total space” E which admits a decomposition into blocks,
σ × Rn, one for each simplex in the “base”, B which is embedded in
E as the “zero section”, σ × {0} ⊆σ × Rn.
The notion of isomorphism reduces to piecewise linear homeomor-
phism of the pair of polyhedra (E, B). The isomorphism classes form
a proper “bundle theory” classiﬁed by homotopy classes of maps into
the “PL Grassmannians”, Gn(PL) (or BPLn – the classifying space
of the group PLn).
The fact that block bundles are functorial is a non-trivial fact
because there is no “geometrical projection”, only a homotopy the-
oretical one.
The lack of a “geometric projection” however enables the tubular
neighborhood theorem to be true. Submanifolds have neighborhoods
which can be “uniquely blocked”,
and transversality constructions can be made using the blocks.
In fact, it seems to the author that the category of polyhedra with
the concomitant theory of block bundles provides the most general
and natural setting for performing the geometrical constructions
associated with transversality and intersection.
We note the fact that a homotopy theoretical “non-zero section”
of a block bundle cannot necessarily be realized geometrically pre-
cisely because there is no “geometric projection”.

190
The Transversality Construction
Consider a closed submanifold Mn+l of the block bundle E. It
is possible2 (if B is compact) to perform a compactly supported
isotopy so that
M is transversal to B ,
M intersects a neighborhood of B in a union of blocks intersect the
neighborhood.
E
B
M
The intersection with B is a compact manifold V l which is a sub-
polyhedron of B. There are certain points to be noted.
i) If Mn+l varies by a proper cobordism W n+l+1 in E ×unit interval
then V varies by a cobordism.
ii) A proper map M
f−→E can be made transversal to B by making
the graph of f transversal to M × B. We obtain a proper map
V →B .
iii) More general polyhedra X may be intersected with B. The in-
tersection has the same singularity structure as X. For example,
consider a Z /n-manifold in E, that is, a polyhedron formed from
a manifold with n-isomorphic collections of boundary components
by identiﬁcation. The transversal intersection with B is again a
Z /n-manifold. We can speak of Z /n-cobordism, and property ii)
holds.
iv) Passing to cobordism classes of proper maps
M →E

and cobordism classes of maps
V →B
yields Abelian groups (disjoint union)
Ω∗E and Ω∗B
and we have constructed the Thom intersection homomorphism
Ω∗E ∩B
−−→Ω∗B ,
plus a Z /n analogue
Ω∗(E; Z /n) ∩B
−−→Ω∗(B; Z /n) .
Proposition 6.1 Intersection gives the Thom isomorphism
Ω∗E ∩B
−−→
∼

Ω∗B .
Proof: If M ∩B = ∂W, then we can “cobord to M′ oﬀof B” using
M × I union “closed blocks over W”, schematically
M
M ′
W
B
M ∩B
Now use that fact that the one point compactiﬁcation of E, E+
with B removed is contractible to “send M′ oﬀto inﬁnity”, using a
proper map M′ × R →E −B. This proves ∩B is injective. ∩B is
clearly onto since
(blocks over V ) ∩B = V .

192
Note if E were oriented by a cohomology class
U ∈Hn(E, E −B; Z)
the isomorphism above would hold between the oriented cobordism
groups (also denoted Ω∗).
We deﬁne Z /n-manifolds by glueing together oriented isomorphic
boundary components and obtain the Z /n-Thom isomorphism
Ω∗(E; Z /n) ∩B
−−→
∼
=
Ω∗(B; Z /n) .
The Signature Invariants and Integrality
The Thom isomorphism
Ω∗E ∩B
−−→
∼
=
Ω∗B
is the basic geometric invariant of the bundle E. To exploit it we
consider the numerical invariants which arise in surgery on mani-
folds.
If x ∈H4i(V ; Q), deﬁne “the signature of the cycle x” by
signature x = signature of quadratic form on H2i(V ; Q)
given by ⟨y2, x⟩, y ∈H2i(V ; Q).
An oriented manifold V has a signature in Z. An oriented Z /n-
manifold has a signature in Z /n,
signature V
= signature (V/singularity V ) mod n .

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
193
These signatures are cobordism invariants. For example, if V is
cobordant to zero, we can unfold the cobordism
Q
V

where Q and W are obtained from the cobordism of V to ∅and see
that

using the Addition Lemma (Novikov) for the signature of “manifolds

These signature relations are proved by pleasant little duality ar-
guments.

E × Rk .
If B is a closed manifold and the ﬁbre dimension of E is even,
then
B ∩B
represents the Poincar´e dual of the Euler class in homology, an “un-
stable invariant”. If this class is zero then B is homologous to a cycle
in E −B If B ∩B is cobordant to zero in B × I then B is cobordant
in E × I to a submanifold of E −B (by the argument above).
We will see that
i) L and the rational Euler class form a complete set of rational
invariants for E (ﬁbre dimension E even). The set of bundles is
almost a “lattice” in the set of invariants.
ii) ∆E and the ﬁbre homotopy type of E −B →B form a complete
set of invariants at odd primes.

At the prime 2, LE, the ﬁbre homotopy type of E −B →B , and
a certain additional 2 torsion invariant K determine E. The precise
form and geometric signiﬁcance of K is not yet clear4.
We pursue the discussion of the odd primary situation and the
K-theory invariant ∆E.
We will use ∆E to construct the Galois
symmetry in piecewise linear theory. The construction of ∆E follows
from the discussion below.
Besides the “algebraic implication” for piecewise linear theory of
∆E, we note here that for smooth bundles ∆E will be constructed
from the “Laplacian in E”. We hope to pursue this “analytical im-
plication” of ∆E in PL theory in a later discussion.
Geometric Characterization of K-theory
We consider a marvelous geometric characterization of elements
in K-theory (real K-theory at odd primes).
Roughly speaking, an element in K(X) is a “geometric cocy-
cle” which assigns a residue class of integers to every smooth Z /n-
manifold in X.
The cocycle is subject to certain conditions like
cobordism invariance, amalgamation of residue classes, and a peri-
odicity formula.5
Actually there is another point of view besides that of the title.
Geometric properties of manifold theory force a four-fold periodicity
into the space classifying ﬁbre homotopy equivalences between PL
bundles.
This four-fold periodic theory is the germane theory for studying
the geometric invariants of manifolds beyond those connected to the
homotopy type or the action of π1 on the universal cover.
The obstruction theory in this geometric theory has the striking
“theory of invariants” property of the “geometric cocycle” above (at

all primes). This can be seen by interesting geometric arguments
using manifolds with “join-like singularities”.6
The author feels this is the appropriate way to view this geo-
metric theorem about real K-theory at odd primes – where “Bott
periodicity” coincides with the “geometric periodicity”.
However, the proof of the geometric cocycle theorem (at odd
primes) is greatly facilitated using K-theory. Moreover the Galois
group of Q acts on K-theory.
In summary, the “geometric insight” into this theorem about K-
theory comes from the study of manifolds, the Galois symmetry in
manifold theory comes from K-theory.7
We describe the theorem.

K(X)0 means the localization of K(X) at {0}, KO(X)⊗Q. K(X)ˆ

Remarks:
a) The isomorphisms above are determined by the case X = pt,
where
(Ω4∗(pt) signature

b) The proof shows that the isomorphism holds for cohomology the-
ories – that is, if we consider geometric cocycles with values on
4i+j-manifolds subject to cobordism and the periodicity relation,
then we are describing elements in
Kj(X)0 or Kj(X)ˆ.

The integrality condition means that σQ is integral on the lattice

This in turn implies that the element determined by σf in
K(X)ˆ ⊗Q = K(X)(Adele)l
is “rational” and is in fact the image of the element determined

a geometric cocycle of “degree d”.

In eﬀect, the construction amounts to ﬁnding the ∆E of the corol-
lary when E is a vector bundle.
Let γ denote the canonical bundle over the Grassmannian BSO4n.
There is a natural element
∆4n = Λ+ −Λ−
Λ+ + Λ−∈KOc(γ) ⊗Z [ 1
2] .
Λ = Λ+ ⊕Λ−is the canonical splitting of the exterior algebra of γ
into the eigenspaces of the “∗operator” for some Riemannian metric
on γ.
Explanation:
a) KOc(γ) ≡KO(Thom space γ) = KO(MSO4n) is isomorphic to
the kernel of the restriction
KO(BSO4n) →KO(BSO4n−1) .
b) Elements in KO(BSO4n) can be deﬁned be real representations of
SO4n. Λ denotes the exterior algebra regarded as a representation
of SO4n. Λ+ and Λ−are the ±1 eigenspaces of the involution
α : Λ →Λ
given by Cliﬀord multiplication with the volume element in Λn
(i.e. α : Λi →Λn−i is (−1)i∗where ∗is Hodge’s operator).
c) Λ+ ⊕Λ−has dimension 24n so that it is invertible in KO(BSO4n)
with 1/2 adjoined.
d) Λ+ and Λ−are isomorphic as representations of SO4n−1 so

Λ+ + Λ−lies in the kernel

e) The element ∆4n ∈KOc(γ4n) ⊗Z [1

KOc(R4n) which is 2−2n times the “natural integral generator”

202
(deﬁned using ∆+ −∆−where ∆= ∆+ + ∆−is the “basic spin
representation” deﬁned using the Cliﬀord algebra of R4n).
f) We shall think of K-theory K0, K1, K2, . . . (KO tensor Z [1

riodicity isomorphism deﬁned by ∆4 in KOc(R4) ⊗Z [ 1

g) The elements ∆4q are multiplicative with respect to the natural
map

∆4(q+r)/(γ4q × γ4r) = ∆4q × ∆4r
in KOc(γ4q × γ4r) ⊗Z [1

(I am indebted to Atiyah and Segal for this discussion.)
The elements ∆4n are deﬁned in the universal spaces for bordism,

They deﬁne then a natural transformation

these are related by Alexander duality.
Thus smooth manifolds can be regarded as cycles in K-theory.
Then any element in Ki(X), ν may be evaluated in a manifold M
of dimension n in X and we obtain
(M →X) ∩ν ∈Kn−i(pt) .
If M is a Z /k-manifold we obtain an element in Kn−i(pt)⊗Z /k.10
10Technically, this uses the fact that Z /k-manifolds represent “bordism with Z /k coeﬃcients”
which is easy to prove. One deﬁnes a map by transversality and the coeﬃcient sequence above
gives the isomorphism.

To calculate ∆(V ) we encounter the characteristic classes of the

∆(V )

11We note that there is a more direct evaluation of ∆obtained by embedding the split Z /k-
manifold M in D2
∗× RN equivariantly.
D2
∗means D2 with Z /k rotating the boundary.
One combines this embedding with the map of M into X and the classifying map of ν into
BSO4k. One can then pull ∆4k back to the mod k Moore space

with K-group Z /k. Following this construction through allows an analytical interpretation
of the residue classes in Z /k in terms of the “elliptic operator for the signature problem”.

204
To analyze ∆f consider again the natural transformation ∆∗from
bordism ⊗Z [1/2] to K-theory. By obstruction theory in the uni-
versal spaces one sees directly that ∆∗is onto for zero dimensional
cohomology.12
Namely: We have a map of universal spaces
M
(∆)
−−→B
(B = (BO){odd primes}) , M = lim
−→(Ω4nMSO4n){odd primes})
and
i) (∆) is onto in homotopy,

We can ﬁnd then a universal cross section.
It follows by Alexander duality when X is a ﬁnite complex that
∆∗is onto for all dimensions.
In the kernel of ∆∗we have the elements
{(V →pt) × (M →X), signature V = 0} .
In the elegant expression of Conner-Floyd we then have a map,
Ω∗(X) ⊗Ω∗Z [ 1
2] ∆∗
−−→K∗(X) ,
which is a naturally split surjection.
One passes again to cohomology in dimension zero to see that this
is injective. One sees by a rational calculation that ∆∗is injective
for the case
X = (MSON)large skeleton .
12We assume all groups are localized at odd primes.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
205
The result follows for any X because we can calculate ∆∗(µ) con-
sidering µ as a map
h-fold suspension X
µ−→(MSON)skeleton .
The natural splitting of ∆∗implies
µ∗(kernel ∆∗) = (kernel ∆∗) ∩image µ∗
in Ω∗⊗Ω∗Z [1/2].
The left hand side is zero (∆∗is injective for MSON) while image
µ∗is a general element. Thus kernel ∆∗= 0, and

From the deﬁnition of mod n homology (the ordinary homology
of X smash the Moore space) we see that for odd n
Ω∗(X; Z /n) ⊗Ω∗Z ∼= K∗(X; Z /n) .
Now Ω∗(X; Z /n) is a “multiplicative theory”. We can form the
product of two Z /n-manifolds.
×
=
one obtains a Z /n-manifold except at points like x. The normal link
at x is
Z /n ∗Z /n , a Z /n-manifold of dimension one .
(Z/3 ∗Z/3)
13 This kernel argument and the tensor product formulation are due to Conner-Floyd. 
See "The relation of cobordism to  K-theory", Springer Lecture Notes 28 (1966),  
for their beautiful ``complex and symplectic formulae''. 

206
Now Z /n∗Z /n bounds a Z /n-manifold (the cobordism is essentially
unique) so we can remove the singularity by replacing the cone over
Z /n ∗Z /n with this cobordism at each bad point x.
We obtain then a product of Z /n-manifolds.
Thus
K∗(X; Z /n) ∼= Ω∗(X; Z /n) ⊗Ω∗Z /n
has a natural co-multiplication14. In particular, it is a Z /n-module.
We can then deﬁne a natural evaluation
K∗(X; Z /n) e−→Hom
¡
K∗(X; Z /n); Z /n
¢
.
The right hand side is a cohomology theory – “Hom of Z /n-
modules into Z /n is an exact functor”. We have an isomorphism for
the point – this is Bott periodicity mod n. Thus e is an isomorphism,
Pontrjagin Duality for K-theory.
Therefore
K∗(X; Z /n) ∼= Hom

K∗(X; Z /n), Z /n

Now K(X) is ﬁnitely generated so we can tensor the Z /n coeﬃ-
cient sequence with bZ, and pass to the inverse limit over odd n (the

K∗(X)ˆ ∼= lim

But then the isomorphism above identiﬁes the proﬁnite K-theory
in dimension i with the ﬁnite geometric cocycles of degree i.
This proves the proﬁnite statement in Theorem 6.3.
We note that the rational statement is a rational cohomology
calculation.
One checks that there is a unique element Σ in K(X) ⊗Q so that
σQ(M
f−→X) = ⟨LM · ph f∗Σ, M⟩
for each geometric cocycle σQ. (LM is the L genus of the tangent
bundle of M.) Q. E. D.
Remark: Atiyah has an interesting formulation of the problem of
giving a direct geometric construction of ∆E for a PL bundle. Con-
sider a compact polyhedral submanifold of RN,
γx
x
τx
M
M ⊂RN with “PL normal bundle E”. If x is a non-singular point
(x in the interior of a top dimensional simplex) we have the natural
volume form γx on the normal space of M at x. γx may be regarded
as an element in the Cliﬀord algebra of the tangent space to RN at
these points of M.
γx satisﬁes γ2
x = 1 and deﬁnes a splitting of Λ(RN
x ),
Λ(RN
x ) = (Λτx ⊗Λ+νx) ⊕(Λτx ⊗Λ−νx) ,
τx the tangent space to M at x, Λ+, Λ−as above.

“=” Λ+ −Λ−
Λ+ + Λ−(νx) ,

208
the local form of the element above.
So the problem of constructing ∆E may be “reformulated” –
extend the function γx over all of M to the following –
i) for each point y there is a unit γy in the Cliﬀord algebra of RN
at y.
ii) γy satisﬁes γ2
y = 1 (or at least γ2
y lies in a contractible region about
the identity in the units of the Cliﬀord algebra).
iii) γy is constructed by connecting the local geometry of M at y with
the homotopy of regions in the Cliﬀord algebra of RN at y.
We note that the case (manifold, normal bundle in Euclidean
space) is generic for the problem of constructing ∆E, so this would
give the construction for any PL bundle E.
The proﬁnite and rational theory of PL block bundles
We continue in this mode of considering a problem in terms of its
rational and proﬁnite aspects and the compatibility between them.
This approach is applicable to the theory of piecewise linear bun-
dles because of the existence of a classifying space,
BPLn = block Grassmannian of “PL n-planes” in R∞.
Thus we can deﬁne the proﬁnite completion of the set of n-dimensional
PL bundles over X by
[X, proﬁnite completion BPLn] .
For each locally ﬁnite polyhedron we obtain a natural compact
Hausdorﬀspace. In the oriented theory the “geometric points” cor-
responding to actual bundles form a dense subspace15. The topolog-
ical aﬃnities induced on these points correspond to subtle homotopy
theoretical connections between the bundles.
15This follows for ﬁnite complexes by induction over the cells.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
209
To interpret the general point recall we have the natural map of
classifying spaces16
(BSPLn)ˆ →(BSGn)ˆ.
So a proﬁnite PL bundle determines a completed spherical ﬁbration.
We can think of a completed PL bundle as having its underlying
spherical homotopy type plus some extra (mysterious) geometrical
structure.

We will consider only the p-adic components for p odd – the 2-adic
component is still rather elusive.
In the discussion the proﬁnite completion Xˆ will always mean
with respect to groups of odd order. We occasionally include the
prime 2 for points relating to the 2-adic linear Adams Conjecture.
We can also deﬁne “rational PLn bundles” over X 17
∼= [X, (BPLn)localized at zero] .
Intuitively, the rationalization of a bundle contains the “inﬁnite
order” information in the bundle.
Recall that the arithmetic square tells us we can assemble an
actual PL bundle from a rational bundle and a proﬁnite bundle
which satisfy a “rational coherence” condition.
In the case of PLn bundles this coherence condition is expressible
in terms of characteristic classes as for spherical ﬁbrations in Chap-
ter 4. This follows from the
16For the stable theory this means a proﬁnite PL bundle has a classical ﬁbre homotopy type.
17We are thinking primarily of the oriented case. However BPL2n can be localized using the
ﬁbration
BSPLn →BPL2n →K(Z /2, 1)
and the ﬁberwise localization of Chapter 4.
BPL2n+1 should be localized at zero as
BSPL2n+1 because the action of π1 = Z /2 is rationally trivial.

For n odd no twisting is required because (-1) acts trivially on

do not hold for block bundles, as they do for vector bundles. It
seems reasonable to conjecture that these relations do hold in
the intermediate theory of PL microbundles – where we have a
geometric projection.

The information carried by the rational L classes is precisely the
integral signatures of closed manifold intersections with the zero
section.
The Euler class measures the transversal intersection of B with
itself.

We have already remarked that the second invariant is deﬁned for
a proﬁnite PL bundle over B.
The ﬁrst is also deﬁned – to see this appeal again to the universal
example En over BSPLn.
It is easy to see that bKcEn is isomorphic to the corresponding
group for the completed spherical ﬁbration over (BSPLn)ˆ.

We see that the diﬀerent ways to put (proﬁnite) geometric struc-
ture in the homotopy type E −B →B correspond precisely to the
diﬀerent bK-orientations.
We recall that an orientation determines a Thom isomorphism
bK(B)
∆∼= bK(E) .
Since ∆E was constructed from the signature invariant σ(E), the
K-theory Thom isomorphism is compatible with the geometric Thom
isomorphism discussed above.
We then see the aesthetically pleasing point that at the odd primes
the pure geometric information19 in a PL bundle is carried by the
Z /n signature of Z /n intersections with the zero section (n odd).
Moreover we see that any assignment of signatures to “virtual in-
tersections” (with a subsequent geometric zero section) for a spher-
ical ﬁbration satisfying cobordism invariance and the periodicity re-
lation can be realized by a homotopy equivalent proﬁnite PL bundle.
From the homotopy theoretical point of view we see that the ob-
struction to realizing a completed spherical ﬁbration as the “comple-
ment of the zero section” in a PL bundle is precisely the obstruction
to K-orientability.
Remark: The obstruction to K-orientability can be measured by a
canonical characteristic class
k1(ξ) ∈bK1(B) .
where ξ is any complete spherical ﬁbration over B.
Thus the image of proﬁnite PL bundles in spherical ﬁbrations is

Corollary 2 The “diagonal action” in PLn theory,

i) The signature invariant together with a 2-primary (Arf) invariant
were used by the author to show the topological invariance of geo-
metric structures (triangulations) in bundles under a “no 3-cycle
of order 2” hypothesis (1966). Since we are only concerned with
odd primes here “homeomorphism implies PL homeomorphism”.
This explains the wording of Corollary 1.
These invariants also gave results about triangulations of simply
connected manifolds. This fundamental group hypothesis was es-
sentially removed20 by the more intrinsic arguments of Kirby and
Siebenmann (1968, 1969) who also constructed triangulations.
20The manifold S3 × S1 × S1 illustrates the interdependence.

ii) We would like to reformulate Corollary 2 in the following way.
Think of the symmetries in these theories of bundles as being
described by group actions in the classifying spaces. Then the
group action on the PL Grassmannian corresponding to
V 7→αn/2V α
α ∈bZ

keeps the image of the linear Grassmannian “invariant” and there
gives the action of the Galois group, Gal (¯Q/ Q).

Note These theorems give a rather explicit formula for measuring
the eﬀect of the Galois group on the topological type of a vector

This might be useful for questions about algebraic vector bundles
in characteristic 2.
The proofs of Theorems 6.6 and 6.7 are discussed in the “Equivari-
ance” section below.
Normal Invariants (Periodicity and the Galois Group)
We consider for a moment the theories of ﬁbre homotopy equiva-
lences between bundles (normal invariants).
These theories are more closely connected to the geometric ques-
tions about manifolds which motivated (and initiated) this work.
Moreover, the two real ingredients in the ensuing calculations ﬁnd
their most natural expression here.
Geometrically a normal invariant over the compact manifold M
(with or without boundary) is a cobordism class of normal maps, a
degree one map
L
f−→M
covered by a bundle map
µ
normal bundle of L
in Euclidean space
¶
bf

µ
any bundle

¶
.
We may talk about smooth, PL, or topological normal invari-
ants, sN, plN or tN. Normal invariants form a group (make f × f′
transversal to the diagonal in M × M) and have natural geometric
invariants.
For example for each Z /n-manifold V in M consider
any “cobordism invariant” of the quadratic form in the transversal
inverse image submanifold f−1(V ).

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
217
From the homotopy theoretical point of view normal invariants
correspond to ﬁbre homotopy equivalences between bundles over
M,
E
f−→F .
An equivalence is a ﬁbre homotopy commutative diagram (over
M)
E

where the vertical maps are bundle isomorphisms.
These homo-
topy normal invariants can be added by Whitney sum and the
Grothendieck groups are classiﬁed by maps into a universal space
sN ∼[
, G/O]
plN ∼[
, G/PL]
tN ∼[
, G/Top]
depending on the category of bundles considered.
The geometric description of normal invariants leads to a para-
metrization of the manifolds (smooth, PL, or topological) within a
simply connected homotopy type. This uses the “surgery on a map”
technique of Browder and Novikov. 21
The homotopy description may now be used to study these in-
variants of manifolds.
First there is an interplay between geometry and homotopy theory
– it turns out that the geometric invariants suggested above (signa-
tures of forms over R and Arf invariants of forms over Z /2) give a
complete set of numerical invariants of a normal cobordism class in
either the PL or topological context. (This is contained in Sullivan,
“Geometric Topology Notes” Princeton 196722 for the PL case, and
uses the more recent work of Kirby and Siebenmann constructing
triangulations for the topological case.)
The relations between the invariants are described by cobordism
and a periodicity formula. This is the geometric periodicity, which
is a perfect four-fold periodicity in the topological theory (even at
2).
21See author’s thesis. C. T. C. Wall extended this theory to non-simply connected manifolds
and another “second order” invariant associated with the fundamental group comes into play.

This isomorphism implies that we have an action of the Galois group

∗in the topological normal invariants.
The map P is constructed from the transversality invariants (the
signature invariant, again) using the geometric characterization of
K-theory above.
The K-orientation of a PL bundle developed as a generalization
of this odd primary calculation of PL normal invariants.
The isomorphism P is the ﬁrst “ingredient” in our calculations
below. It is discussed in more detail below.
The second ingredient was constructed in Chapter 5.
The homotopy description of normal invariants can be proﬁnitely
completed. The discussion of the Adams Conjecture above shows
the following.
For each proﬁnite vector bundle v over M and α ∈bZ
∗we have a
canonical element
(vα ∼v)
in the group of proﬁnite smooth normal invariants over M.23
(Recall that the ﬁbre homotopy equivalence
vα →v
dim v = n
was canonically determined by the isomorphism induced by α on
BOn−1.)
23We note here that a compact manifold with boundary has an arbitrary (ﬁnite) homotopy
type.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
219
We only require the existence of these natural “Galois elements”
for the calculation below. However, the precise structure of these
elements should be important for future ‘twisted calculations’.
We hope to pursue this structure and the quasi action of the Ga-
lois group in a later discussion of manifolds.
Some Consequences of Periodicity and Galois Sym-
metry
We will use the work up to now to study the stable geometric
theories.
Recall we have the signature invariant of a PL bundle leading
to the K-orientation theorem24 and the odd primary periodicity for
normal invariants.
We also have the Galois symmetry in the homotopy types of the
algebraic varieties,
Grassmannian of k-planes in n-space
leading to an action of the Galois group bZ
∗on vector bundles.
We combined these to obtain a compatible action of the Galois
group on the linear and the piecewise linear theory and the canonical
ﬁbre homotopy equivalence between conjugate bundles

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
221
Note on content
We have seen in Chapter 5 that xα −x has a (canonical) ﬁbre
homotopy trivialization for vector bundles.
Assuming this Adams essentially proved Theorem 6.8 for vector
bundles by a very interesting K-theory calculation.
On the other hand it is clear from our deﬁnition of the Galois
action for PL or Top that conjugate elements are ﬁbre homotopy
equivalent.
The burden of the proof is then the other half of the statement.
It turns out that the point is compatibility of the Galois action.
This neatly reduces the PL case to the linear case and a modiﬁed
form of Adams calculations.
To proceed to the proof of this theorem and to further study the
interrelationship between the stable theories we decompose every-
thing using the roots of unity in bZ.
Consider the p-adic component for one odd prime p. Recall from
Chapter 1, bZ
∗
p has torsion subgroup
F ∗
p ∼= Z /(p −1) .
Let ξp = ξ be a primitive (p −1)st root of unity in bZp and consider
any bZp-module K in which bZ
∗
p acts by homomorphisms. Denote the
operation on K
x 7→xξ
by T and consider
πξi =
Y
j̸=i
T −ξj
ξi −ξj
i = 0, . . . , p −2 .
These form a system of orthogonal projections which decompose
K
K = K1 + (Kξ1 + · · · + Kξp−2) .
Kξi is the eigenspace of T with eigenvalue ξi (Kξi = πξiK). We
group the ξ-eigenspaces to obtain the invariant splitting
K = K1 + Kξp , independent of choice of ξp .

222
If K is a bZ-module on which the Galois group bZ
∗acts by a product
of actions of bZ
∗
p on Kp, we can form this decomposition at each odd
prime, collect the result and obtain a natural splitting
K = K1 + Kξ ,
where K1 =
Y
p
(Kp)1, Kξ =
Y
p
(Kp)ξp.
We obtain in this way natural splittings of
proﬁnite vector bundles
proﬁnite topological bundles
topological normal invariants (proﬁnite)
K0
K0 ∼= (K0)1 + (K0)ξ
Ktop
Ktop ∼= (Ktop)1 + (Ktop)ξ
tN
tN ∼= (tN)1 + (tN)ξ .28
To describe the “interconnections between these groups” we con-
sider another natural subgroup of Ktop, “the subgroup of Galois
equivariant bundles”.
Let C 1 denote the subgroup of topological bundles {E} whose
natural Thom isomorphism
K(base E)
∪∆E
−−−→
∼
=
K(Thom space E)
is equivariant with respect to the action of the Galois group.
Note that this means
(x · ∆E)α = xα · ∆E
or ∆α
E = ∆E. Thus the identity map provides an isomorphism be-
tween E and Eα, i.e.
C 1 ⊆
(
ﬁxed points of
Galois action on
topological bundles
)
.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
223

order.

By deﬁnition image θ consists of the smoothable bundles and im-
age j consists of ﬁbre homotopically trivial bundles.
Recall that the Galois group bZ
∗acts compatibly on this diagram
of theories.
Theorem 6.9 (decomposition theorem)
a) θ is an injection on the 1 component and
(Ktop)1 = θ(K0)1 ⊕C 1 .
b) j is an injection on the ξ component and
(Ktop)ξ = j(tN)ξ .
c) (image θ)ξ ⊂(image j)ξ, “a vector bundle at ξ is ﬁbre homotopy
trivial”.
d) (image j)1 ⊆(image θ)1, “a homotopy trivial bundle at 1 is smooth-
able”.
In other words the subgroups
C 1 = {equivariant bundles}
image j + image θ = {smoothable or homotopy trivial bundles}

224
are complementary. Moreover, the latter subgroup canonically splits
into a subgroup of smoothable bundles and a subgroup of homotopy
trivial bundles
Ktop ∼=
C 1
(K0)1
(tNξ)
Note: Since Ktop, (tN)ξ, and (K0)1 are representable functors so
is C 1.
The homotopy groups of C 1 are the torsion subgroups of
Ktop(Si). These can be described in the symmetrical fashion
C 1 = stable (i −1) stem
image j
∼= group of (i −1) exotic spheres
∂parallelizable
.
For example (C 1)p is
¡
2p(p−1)−2
¢
-connected. This follows directly
from the K-orientation sequence below. Calculations like these with
homotopy groups were also made by G. Brumﬁel – in fact these
motivated the space splittings.
Corollary 1 C 1 injects into homotopy theory and into “topological
theory mod smooth theory”.
Analogous to this statement that the equivariant bundles are ho-
motopically distinct we have
Corollary 2 Distinct stable vector bundles ﬁxed by all the ele-
ments of ﬁnite order in the Galois group are also topologically dis-
tinct.
These corollaries follow formally from Theorem 6.9.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
225
The K-theory characteristic class of a topological
bundle
In order to prove the decomposition theorem we measure the “dis-
tance” of a topological bundle from the subgroup of bundles with
an equivariant Thom isomorphism.
The key invariant is the K-theory characteristic class ΘE deﬁned
for any topological bundle E.29
Consider the function
bZ
∗ΘE
−−→K∗(Base)
(where K∗= 1 + eK) deﬁned by the equation
Θα · ∆E = ∆α
E
α ∈bZ
∗.
ΘE measures the non-equivariance of the Thom isomorphism deﬁned
by ∆E
x 7→x · ∆E .
We note that
o) ΘE is a product of functions
(ΘE)p : bZ
∗
p →K∗(Base)p .
i) ΘE satisﬁes a “cocycle condition”.
Θαβ = (Θα)βΘβ .30
ii) ΘE is continuous.
iii) ΘE is exponential
ΘE⊕F = ΘE · ΘF .
iv) If k is an integer prime to p then (see K-Lemma below)

29The ‘idea’ of the invariant is due to Thom. A related Θ for vector bundles was used by
Adams and Bott.

226
(We regard η and ¯η as complex line bundles for the purposes of
computing the right hand side. The element obtained is ﬁxed by
conjugation so lies in the real K-theory.)
The multiplicative group of (diagonal) 1-cocycles functions satis-
fying o), i) and ii) is denoted Z1
d(bZ
∗, K∗), the group of continuous
crossed homomorphisms from the group bZ
∗into the bZ
∗-module K∗.
Among these we have the principal crossed homomorphisms the
image of
K∗δ−→Z1
d(bZ

u 7→δu , deﬁned by δuα = uα/u .31
The quotient of crossed homomorphisms by principal crossed ho-
momorphisms is the 1-dimensional cohomology of the group bZ
∗with
coeﬃcients in K∗

now consider the problem (at odd primes) of classifying a vector
bundle E up to
linear isomorphism
ﬁberwise homeomorphism
ﬁbre homotopy type .
The geometric characterization above gave a ‘geometric cocycle’
which determined the stable isomorphism type of E,
∆∈Hom
¡
Ωl
∗(
; Q / Z), Q / Z) .
These numerical invariants can be calculated analytically given a
Riemannian geometry on E.
The K-theory Thom class ∆E can also be determined by the
Hodge complex on E. ∆E and the ﬁbre homotopy type of E deter-
mine the topological type of E. The Θ invariant is then calculated
from the action of the Galois group on ∆E.
Theorem 6.10 A vector bundle E is topologically trivial iﬀthe co-
cycle ΘE is identically 1.

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
227
Theorem 6.11 E is ﬁbre homotopy trivial iﬀΘE is cohomologous

Any cohomology class contains the Θ invariant of some vector
bundle E.

32The homotopy statement is true at 2 for vector bundles.

228
Note: Because ΘE is a product and bZ

p is cyclic ΘE is determined
by its value at one “generating” point α ∈bZ
∗.33
Thus the single
invariant Θα(E) ∈K∗(B) is a complete topological invariant of the
vector bundle E. In these terms we can then say that E is ﬁbre
homotopically trivial iﬀΘα(E) = δu(α) = uα/u for some u ∈K∗(B).
We stated the theorem in the invariant form above to show the
rather striking analogy between the “problem” and the “form” of
the solution.
We pursue this “form” and add a fourth “K-group” to the collec-

Thus sN splits as theories. The splitting is not necessarily addi-

proving Theorem 6.12 ﬁrst.

commutes .
Moreover the horizontal map is an isomorphism at 1, and the ver-
tical maps are isomorphisms at ξ.
Proof:
a) The diagram commutes because
i) any homomorphism K →K∗is determined by its eﬀect in the
reduced K-theory of the 4i-spheres. To see this note that we

230
have an H-map of classifying spaces
O × BO →1 × BO
with given action on the primitive homology (rational coef-
ﬁcients) – the spherical homology classes. We have already
seen (the claim in Theorem 3.7 or by elementary obstruction
theory here in the odd primary case) that this determines the
homotopy class.
ii) The reduced K-theory of the sphere S4i is cyclic so if θα maps
a generator ν of eK(S4i) to (1 + ν)θi in 1 + eK(S4i) = K∗S4i,
then
(θαν)α/θαν = (1 + θiν)α/(1 + θiν) since ν2 = 0
= (1 + θiα2iν)/(1 −θiν)
= 1 + θi(α2i −1)ν ,
but
θα(να −ν) = θα(να)/θα(ν)
= (1 + να)θi(1 −θiν)
which also equals 1 + θi(α2i −1)ν. So they agree on spheres.
b) We have used the formulae
να = α2i ∈eKS4i ,
(1 + ν)α = 1 + α2iν ∈K∗S4i .
The second follows from the ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst follows from our
calculations on homology in Chapter 5. Together they imply the
vertical maps act on the 4i-spheres by multiplication by α2i −1,
i = 1, 2, . . . .
These are isomorphisms if i ̸≡0 mod (p −1/2), the region of
dimensions where ‘Kξ of the spheres’ is concentrated. This proves
the vertical maps are isomorphisms for all spaces.

where g(x) = xα ∼x. (Note we don’t have to check any compatibility
since we only need the map g on any arbitrarily large skeleton of the
classifying space for K-theory.)
A check of homotopy groups shows dξ and d1 are isomorphisms
up to some large dimension. This shows f is onto K and
K ∼= Kξ ⊕K∗
1
for complexes up to any large dimension.
(If we wish, the theory of compact representable functors then
shows f has an actual cross section.)
This proves Theorem 6.12.

234
a) Id is the identity,
b) p is an isomorphism by the construction below,
c) f is onto by what we just proved,
d) (θ∆)1 is isomorphic to
¡
x 7→θα(x)1
¢
so it is an isomorphism by
the K-Lemma,
e) δξ is an isomorphism similarly,
f) C 1 = kernel θ by deﬁnition.
Theorem 6.9 now follows formally – the crucial point being the
naturality of the eigenspaces under the maps j and θ.
Proof of Theorems 6.10, 6.11 We also see that
θ(K0)1 ⊕j(tN)ξ
Θ
−→
∼
= Z1
d(bZ
∗, K∗) ,
or
Ktop ∼= C 1 ⊕Z1
d(bZ
∗, K∗) ,
and under this identiﬁcation the maps
tN →Ktop , K0 →Ktop
are just 0 + δ and 0 + θ∆respectively.
This proves 6.10 and parts ii) and iii) of the corollary. Part i) is
a restatement of Theorem 6.11.
Theorem 6.11 part i) follows from the deﬁnition of Θ and the
ontoness of f.
Part ii) follows from the fact that H1
d is “concatenated at 1” since
δξ is an isomorphism.
But the smooth bundles generate because
(θ∆)1 is an isomorphism.
Proof of Theorem 6.8 We have proved xα −x ∼0. For the con-
verse ﬁrst consider the vector bundle case:
V is ﬁbre homotopy trivial iﬀθV ∼0 by Theorem 6.11.
θ∆(V ) ∼0 means there is a u so that
θ∆(V )α = δu(α) .

The Galois Group in Geometric Topology
235
By the K-Lemma V also in K1 implies V = xα −x. This takes
care of the eigenspace of 1.
At ξ every element is a diﬀerence of conjugates.
The proof is
completed by adding two cases 1 and ξ.
The topological case:
The Galois action in (Ktop)ξ is isomorphic to that in K∗
ξ by Theo-
rem 6.9 and periodicity. Thus any element in (Ktop)ξ is a diﬀerence
of conjugates.
The eigenspace of 1 is all smooth except for C 1 which doesn’t en-
ter by 6.9. Thus we are reduced to the smooth case just treated.
Q. E. D.
The K-orientation sequence and PLn theory
To study K-oriented ﬁbration theory and its relation to PL theory
we us the K-orientation sequence on the classifying space level
· · · →KGˆn →SGˆn →Bˆ
⊗→(BKGn)ˆ →(BSGn)ˆ.
(BSGn)ˆ classiﬁes the oriented ﬁbration theory with ﬁbre bSn−1.
(BKGn)ˆ classiﬁes the theory of K-oriented Sn−1 ﬁbrations. (The
argument of Dold and Mayer-Vietoris sequence for K-theory implies
(BKGn)ˆ exists and classiﬁes the K-oriented theory.)
Bˆ
⊗classiﬁes the special units in bK. The group of K-units acts on
the K-oriented ﬁbrations over a ﬁxed base.
Then we have the loop spaces SGˆn, KGˆn, . . .
The maps are the natural ones, for example,
i) Bˆ
⊗→BKGˆ is obtained by letting the K-theory units act on the
trivial orientation of the trivial bundle.
ii) If n →∞SGˆn →Bˆ
⊗is induced by the natural transformation
½
stable cohomotopy
theory
¾ˆ
→{K-theory}ˆ
by looking at the multiplicative units.

236
The sequence is exact, for any consecutive three spaces there is a
long exact sequence of homotopy.
Note: There is an orientation sequence for any multiplicative coho-
mology theory h
→hGn →SGn →H⊗→BhGn →BSGn ,
where
[
, H⊗] ∼= special units h0( ) .
In case the multiplication in the theory is associative enough in
the cocycle level the obstruction to h-orientability is measured by
an element in h1
⊗(BSG) – the h∗analogue of the 1st Stiefel Whitney
class.
This is true for K-theory although the details of this discussion
are not secured.
Another way to ﬁnd the ﬁrst Stiefel Whitney class for K-theory is
to use the identiﬁcation (below) of the orientation sequence (stable)
with the sequence
· · · →G →G/PL →BPL →BG ⇝B(G/PL) ⇝. . .
This sequence has been extended to the right (inﬁnitely) by Board-
man. The space B(G/PL) may be inﬁnitely de-looped and its loop
space is equivalent to BOˆ at odd primes.
Postnikov arguments
(taught to me by Frank Peterson) show B(G/PL) is equivalent at
odd primes to the classifying space for K1, and eK0 ∼= K∗.
Another construction of the 1st Stiefel Whitney class in K-theory
(for odd primes) can be given by constructing a “signature invariant
in BG” using recently developed techniques for surgery on Poincar´e
Duality spaces.37 This makes the construction canonical.
We compare the K-orientation sequence with the (PLn ⊆Gn)-

If we unravel the deﬁnition of ∆PL deﬁned in terms of transversal-
ity and signatures of manifolds we see the claim is true on homotopy
in dimension 4k
Z →bZ
generator 7→power of 2 .
All other groups are zero at odd primes.
Corollary ∆PL is proﬁnite completion at odd primes. Thus proﬁ-
nite PLn theory is isomorphic to K-oriented bSn−1 theory.
Proof: We tensor the upper homotopy sequence with bZ to obtain
an exact sequence isomorphic by the Five Lemma to the lower se-
quence.
This completes the proof of Theorem 6.5 (bZ).
Theorem 6.5 (Q) follows from the discussion of BSGn in Chapter
4, the diagram
Gn/PLn

i) etale homotopy of Chapter 5,
ii) the identiﬁcation of PL theory with K-oriented theory just dis-
cussed,
iii) the completion construction of Chapter 4 for ﬁbrations.
The ﬁrst formula of Theorem 6.6 follows easily from the coﬁbra-
tion
(BSOn−1)ˆ →(BSOn)ˆ →Thom space bγn
where bγn is the completed spherical ﬁbration associated to the canon-
ical bundle over BSOn.
An element α in Gal (eQ/ Q) determines a homotopy equivalence
(α) of the Thom space and obstruction theory shows
(α)∗x = β · xα
where x is an element in bK (Thom space), and
β =
(αn/2

The second formula is immediate.
For the stable equivariance of Theorem 6.7 note that there is an
automorphism of
¡
bγ ﬁbre join K(bZ, 1)
¢ﬁbrewise completion
which multiplies any orientation by an arbitrary unit in bZ.
The actions simplify as stated and the equivariance follows from
the unstable calculation.

Galois Symmetry in Manifold Theory
At the Primes
Dennis Sullivan
(M.I.T., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, U.S.A.)
Let M denote the category generated by compact simply con-
nected manifolds1 and homeomorphisms. In this note we consider
certain formal manifold categories related to M. We have the proﬁ-
nite category c
M, the rational category MQ and the adele category
MA. The objects in these categories are CW complexes whose ho-
motopy groups are modules over the ground ring of the category
(bZ = lim
←−Z/n, Q, and A = Q ⊗bZ) and which have certain additional
manifold structure.
From these formal manifold categories we can reconstruct M up to
the equivalence. For example, a classical manifold M corresponds to
a proﬁnite manifold c
M, a rational manifold MQ and an equivalence
between the images of c
M and MQ in MA. In fact, M is the ﬁbre
product of c
M and MQ over MA .
Thus we can study M by studying these related categories. Here
we ﬁnd certain advantages.
– the structure of M ﬁnds natural expression in the related cat-
egories.
– these categories are larger and admit more examples-manifolds
with certain singularities and more algebraic entities than topo-
logical spaces.
– there is a pattern of symmetry not directly observable in M.
For the last point consider the collection of all non-singular al-
gebraic varieties over C. The Galois group of C over Q permutes
these varieties (by conjugating the coeﬃcients of the deﬁning re-
lations) and provides certain (discontinuous) self maps when these
coeﬃcients are ﬁxed.
1The case π1 ̸= 0 can be treated to a considerable extent using families (see [S3]).

252
As far as geometric topology is concerned we can restrict attention
to the ﬁeld of algebraic number Q (for coeﬃcients) and its Galois
group Gal (Q/Q). Conjugate varieties have the same proﬁnite ho-
motopy type (canonically) so Gal (Q/Q) permutes a set of smooth
manifold structures on one of these proﬁnite homotopy types. [S3]
If we pass to the topological category c
M we ﬁnd this Galois action
is abelian and extends to a natural group of symmetries on the
category of proﬁnite manifolds;
abelianized
Gal(Q/Q)
≃
(
group of units
of bZ
)
acts on c
M .
First description.
The possibility of deﬁning formal manifold categories arises from
the viewpoint begun by Browder and Novikov. For example, Brow-
der observes that
(i) a manifold has an underlying homotopy type satisfying Poincar´e
duality.
(ii) there is a Euclidean bundle over this homotopy type – the normal
bundle in Rn (which is classiﬁed by a map into some universal
space B)
(iii) the one point compactiﬁcation of the bundle has a certain homo-
topy theoretical property- a degree one map from the sphere Sn
(the normal invariant).
Novikov used the invariant (iii) to classify manifolds with a ﬁxed ho-
motopy type and tangent bundle, while Browder constructed mani-
folds from the ingredients of (i), (ii), (iii).
We propose tensoring such a homotopy theoretical description of
a simply connected manifold with a ring R. For appropriate R we
will obtain formal manifold categories MR.
To have such a description of MR we assume there is a natural
construction in homotopy theory Y →YR which tensors the homo-
topy groups with R (under the appropriate hypothesis) and that a
map ν : X →BR has an associated sphere ﬁbration (sphere= Sn
R).

Galois Symmetry in Manifold Theory
253
There are such constructions for R any of the subrings of Q, Z,
any of the non-Archimedian completions of Q, Qp, the arithmetic
completions of Z, bZp and bZ, the ﬁnite Adeles Q ⊗bZ (see [S1]).
The ﬁbre product statement
M ∼MQ ×MA c
M
(c
M = MbZ)
follows from the Browder surgery theorem and the analogous de-
composition of ordinary (simply connected) homotopy theory (see
[B] and [S1] chapter 3).
Second description.
If one pursues the study of Browder’s description of classical man-
ifolds in a more intrinsic manner – internal to the manifolds studied
– certain transversality invariants occur in a natural way. These sig-
nature and Arf invariants of quadratic forms on submanifolds control
the situation and the structure which accrues can be expressed in
the formal manifold categories see [S2] and [S3].
In the ”rational manifold theory”, a manifold is just a rational
homotopy type satisfying homological duality over Q together with
a preferred characteristic class
ln + ln−4 + · · · + ln−4i + . . . = lX ∈Hn−4∗(X, Q) ,
n = dim X .
Here ln is an orientation class and l0 is the signature of X (if n ≡
0(4)). To pursue a more precise discussion we should regard X as a
speciﬁc CW complex endowed with speciﬁc chains representing the
characteristic class.
Then a homotopy equivalence X
f→Y between two such complexes
and a chain ωf so that f#lX −lY = ∂ωf determines a ”homeomor-
phism” up to concordance.
There is an analogous ”homological” description for MA if we
replace Q by A = Q ⊗bZ (or by any ﬁeld of characteristic zero.)
The proﬁnite manifold theory has a more intricate structure. First
of all there is a complete splitting into p-adic components
c
M ∼
Y
p
c
Mp
where the product is taken over the set of prime numbers and c
Mp is
the formal manifold category based on the ring R = bZp, the p-adic
integers.

254
For the odd primes we have a uniform structure. Let (k∗, k∗) de-
note the cohomology theory constructed from the p-adic completion
of real k-theory by converting the skeletal ﬁltration into a grading.
Then the p-adic manifolds are just the k-duality spaces at the prime
p. That is, we have a CW complex X (with p-adic homotopy groups)
and k-homology class
µX ∈km(X)
m = dim X (defn)
so that forming cap products with the orientation class gives the
Poincar´e duality
ki(X) ∼km−i(X) 2
The homeomorphisms in c
Mp correspond to the maps X →Y giving
an isomorphism of this natural duality in k-theory
k∗X
/ k∗Y
k∗X
µX∩≃
O
k∗Y
o
µY ∩≃
O
”homeomorphism condition”
i.e. f is a homotopy equivalence and f∗µX = µY .
Again a more precise discussion (determining a concordance class
of homeomorphisms . . . ) requires the use of cycles (analogous to
the chains above) and a speciﬁc homology producing the relation
f∗µX = µY .
Note that K(X)∗, the group of units in k0(X), acts bijectively
on the set of all orientations of X.
Thus the set of all manifold
structures (up to equivalence) on the underlying homotopy type of
X is parametrized exactly by this group of units.
Also note that a homotopy type occurs as that of a p-adic manifold
precisely when there is a k-duality in the homotopy type: (see [S2]
and [S3]).
At the prime 2 the manifold category is not as clear.
To be
sure the 2-adic manifolds have underlying homotopy types satisfy-
ing homological duality (coeﬃcients Z2). Thus we have the natural
2We could reformulate this deﬁnition of a k-duality space at the prime p in terms of homo-
logical Poincar´e duality and the existence of an orientation class in “periodic” K-homology.
Using the connective k-theory seems more elegant and there is a natural cycle interpetation
of k∗in terms of manifolds with signature free singularities, (see [S2]).
We also note that the Pontryagin character of µx would be compatible with the rational
characteristic class of a classical manifold determining X.

(mod 2) characteristic classes of Wu
vX = v1 + v2 + · · · + vi + . . .
(i ⩽dim X
2
)
where vi ∈Hi(X, Z/2) is deﬁned by duality and the Steenrod oper-
ations
vi ∪x = Sqi(x)
dim x + i = dim X .
The square of this class only has terms in dimensions congruent to
zero mod 4
v2
2 + v2
4 + v2
6 + . . .
and the ”manifold structure” on X deﬁnes a lifting of this class to
bZ2-coeﬃcients 3
LX = l1 + l2 + · · · + li + · · · ∈H4∗(X, bZ2) .
The possible manifold structures on the homotopy type of X are
acted on bijectively by a group constructed from the cohomology
algebra of X. We take inhomogeneous cohomology classes,
u = u2 + u4 + u6 + · · · + u2i + . . .
using Z/2 or bZ2 coeﬃcients in dimensions congruent to 2 or 0 mod
4 respectively. We form a group G from such classes by calculating
in the cohomology ring using the law
u ¦ v = u + v + 8uv .
Note that G is the product of the various vector spaces of (mod 2)
cohomology (in dimensions 4i + 2) and the subgroup G8 generated
by inhomogeneous classes of H4∗(X, bZ2).
If we operate on the manifold structure of X by the element u in
G8 the characteristic class changes by the formula
LXu = LX + 8u(1 + LX) .
For example, the characteristic class mod 8 is a homotopy invariant.
(See [S3]).
3Again, the Poincar´e dual of LX would be compatible with the rational characteristic class
of a classical manifold determining X.

Local Categories
If l is a set of primes, we can form a local manifold category Ml
by constructing the ﬁbre product
Ml ≡MQ ×MA (
Y
p∈l
c
Mp)
The objects in Ml satisfy duality for homology over Zl plus the
additional manifold conditions imposed at each prime in l and at Q.
For example we can form M2 and Mθ, the local categories corre-
sponding to l = {2} and l = θ = {(odd primes)}. Then our original
manifold category M satisﬁes
M ∼= M2 ×MQ Mθ
and we can say
M is built from M2 and Mθ with coherences in MQ.
M2 is deﬁned by homological duality spaces over Z(2) satisfying
certain homological conditions and having homological invariants
(at 2).
Mθ is deﬁned by homological duality spaces over Z[1/2] with the
extra structure of a KO ⊗Z[1/2] orientation.
MQ is deﬁned by homological duality spaces over Q with a ratio-
nal characteristic class.
Examples
(1) Let V be a polyhedron with the local homology properties of an
oriented manifold with R coeﬃcients. Then V satisﬁes homological
duality for R coeﬃcients.
If R = Q, the rational characteristic class can be constructed by
transversality, (Thom) and we have a rational manifold
V ∈MQ
The Thom construction can be reﬁned to give more information.
The characteristic class lV satisﬁes a canonical integrality condition4.
4See J.Morgan and D.Sullivan, The transversality characteristic class and linking cycles in
surgery theory, Ann. Maths. 99, 463–544 (1974)

Galois Symmetry in Manifold Theory
257
At p > 2 lV can be lifted (via the Chern character) to a canonical
K-homology class [S1].
So if V also satisﬁes Z/p-duality (p > 2) we have a k-duality space
and a local manifold at odd primes V ∈Mθ.
If V satisﬁes Z/2-duality we have a good candidate for a manifold
at 2 (V ∈M2?)
Note that such polyhedra are readily constructed by taking the
orbit space of an action of a ﬁnite group π on a space W 5.
For
example if the transformations of π are orientation preserving then
W/π is a Z/p homology manifold if W is, and p is prime to the order
of π. W/π is a Q homology manifold if W is.
(2) Now let V be a non-singular algebraic variety over an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p. Then the complete etale
type of V determines a q-adic homological duality space at each
prime q not equal to p. (See [AM] and [S1]).
V has an algebraic tangent bundle T. Using the etale realization
of the projective bundle of T one can construct a complex K-duality
for V . To make this construction we have only to choose a generator
µk of
H1(k −{0}, bZq) ≃bZq .
This K-duality is transformed using the action of the Galois group
to the appropriate (signature) duality in real K-theory, q > 2. If
π1V = 0, we obtain a q-adic manifold for each q ̸= 2 or q ̸= p.6
[V ] ∈Mq
Now suppose that V is this reduction mod p of a variety in char-
acteristic zero. Let VC denote the manifold of complex points for
some embedding of the new ground ring into C.
Of course VC determines q-adic manifolds for each q, [VC] ∈Mq.
We have the following comparison. If µk corresponds to the nat-
ural generator of H1(C −0, bZq) then
[V ] ≃[VC] in Mq .

The Galois symmetry
To construct the symmetry in the proﬁnite manifold category c
M
we consider the primes separately.
For p > 2 we have the natural symmetry of the p-adic units bZ∗
p in
isomorphism classes in c
Mp. If M is deﬁned by the homotopy type
X with k-orientation µX, deﬁne Mα by X and the k-orientation µα
X
using the Galois action of α ∈bZ∗
p on k-theory (q ∈Z∗
p acts by the
Adams operation ψq when q is an ordinary integer). Note that M
and Mα have the same underlying homotopy type7.
For p = 2 we proceed less directly. Let M be manifold in c
M2 with
characteristic class LM = l1 + l2 + . . . If α ∈Z∗
p deﬁne uα ∈G8(M)
by the formula
1 + 8uα = 1 + α2l1 + α4l2 + . . .
1 + l1 + l2 + . . .
i.e.
ua =
¡α2 −1
8
¢
l1 +
¡α4 −1
8
l2 + 1 −α2
8
l2
1
¢
+ . . .
Deﬁne Mα by letting uα act on the manifold structure of M. An
interesting calculation shows that we have an action of bZ∗
2 on the
isomorphism classes of 2-adic manifolds – again the underlying ho-
motopy type stays ﬁxed7.
We have shown the
Theorem. – The proﬁnite manifold category c
M possesses the sym-
metry of the subﬁeld of C generated by the roots of unity.
The compatibility of this action of bZ∗on c
M with the Galois action
on complex varieties discussed above is clear at p > 2, and at p = 2 up
to the action of elements of order 8 in the underlying cohomology
rings of the homotopy types. We hope to make the more precise
calculation in [S3]8.
7This connection proves the Adams conjecture for vector bundles ([S1] chapters 4 and 5), an
extension to topological euclidean bundles (chapter 6), and ﬁnally an analogue in manifold
theory [S3].
8The calculation was completed but not published.
It can be deduced as well from the
papers of John Wood, Removing Handles form Non-Singular Algebraic Hypersurfaces in
CPn+1, Inventiones math. 31, 1–6 (1975), Complete Intersections as Branched Covers and
the Kervaire Invariant, Math. Ann. 240, 223–230 (1979).

These notes were motivated by some twists and turns in the geo-
metric story of the classiﬁcation of high dimensional simply con-
nected manifolds, HDSC for short. Part II of the notes (never com-
pleted, but see [15]) was planned to use the theory of Part I for
this application. Perhaps here would be a good place to sketch that
history and mention some outstanding problems and conjectures
relating the Galois theory of Part I and new developments such
as Ranicki’s theory, Mandell’s recent theorem, Donaldson’s theory,
Casson’s lifting of the Rochlin invariant and the interplay of topol-
ogy and quantum physics. The story will be punctuated by a few
personal anecdotes.
The story begins in my graduate days at Princeton where Lori
was born (March ‘64): the photo was taken in the common room of
old Fine Hall.
Motivated by Browder’s lectures (1964-65) combining Poincar´e
duality spaces and Novikov’s theory for constructing smooth man-
ifolds, my thesis [10] developed a geometric obstruction theory for
deforming a homotopy equivalence f : L →M between closed man-
ifolds to a geometric equivalence (either smooth or combinatorial).
The diﬀerence between these two obstruction theories was equiva-
lent to an already existing obstruction theory (Hirsch and Mazur [4])
for classifying the smooth structures up to isotopy on a given com-
binatorial or PL manifold. The latter obstruction theory had ﬁnite
coeﬃcients, the ﬁnite groups πn(PL/O) of Milnor’s exotic spheres.
261

262
The orders of these groups begin (in dimension 7)
28, 2, 8, 6, 992, 1, 3, 2, 16256, 2, 16, 16, . . .
but were largely unknown in general, being essentially equivalent to
the Bernoulli numbers and the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
Namely, except for the elements of Kervaire invariant one corre-
sponding to a possible extra Z/2 in dimensions 2n −2, take out im-
age J, a cyclic group of order the denominator of Bn/4n and put in
a cyclic group of order the numerator of Bn/4n, the exotic spheres
bounding parallelizable manifolds, to get the Kervaire-Milnor [5]
groups of exotic spheres.
It made sense (a suggestion of Milnor) to concentrate on the PL
or combinatorial version of the obstruction theory, where the ob-
structions were visible as middle dimensional surgery, i.e. construc-
tive cobordism, obstructions along relative submanifolds of M pulled
back transversally by f to L. Actually, a crucial fact for the sub-
sequent developments was that the surgery obstructions deﬁned by
pulling back closed (or Z modulo n) submanifolds of M× Euclidean
space were actually invariants of the triple (L, f, M) and gave apriori
calculations of some of the obstructions.
However, I am getting ahead of the story. I was happy to present
the obstruction theory at my thesis defense (January, 1966) with
completely explicit coeﬃcient groups. The obstructions were in the
groups
H2(M; Z2) , H4(M; Z) , H6(M; Z2) , H8(M; Z) , etc.
I was somewhat taken aback by Steenrod’s reaction at the question-
ing, when he asked “A theory is all well and good but how does
one compute the obstructions?” “No one asked that for the Hirsch-
Mazur smoothing theory” I answered.
Steenrod’s question and my defensive answer haunted me some
days later on the voyage aboard the USS United States heading for
Southampton along with Lori and her mother Kathy, to spend the
next eight months at Warwick University.
The apriori invariants
mentioned above came back to me and I remembered Thom’s work
on the Steenrod representability question – which homology classes
in a polyhedron are represented by maps of a closed manifold into
that polyhedron. At the prime 2 all classes were proven by Thom
[19] to be Steenrod representable.
Then one could prove that at
the prime 2 all the obstructions above were deducible from apriori

263
invariants. Thus the usual phenomena of obstruction theory that
later obstructions depend on the deformations making earlier ob-
structions zero could only apply to the odd primary torsion part of
the obstructions in H4k(M; Z).
This possibility arose here because some homology classes re-
quired singularities in their representatives, and the singularities
(Thom) were essentially related to the odd primes.
I tried ﬁrst to extend the apriori surgery obstruction invariants to
more general objects – manifolds with singularities – that could rep-
resent the general homology class. Using the explicit and beautiful
nature of the smooth cobordism ring at odd primes. a very explicit
set of singularities was found at Warwick after some months. The
objects were stratiﬁed sets modeled on the stratiﬁed joins of a set of
generators for the smooth bordism ring (at odd primes) [15]. I re-
member turning the page of my singularities notebook (while sitting
on the deck of a ship going to Scandinavia) to start a new section
on surgery for these spaces. The ﬁrst case was a singularity stratum
which was a submanifold of codimension 5 whose neighbourhood
was the product with the cone over the complex projective plane –
the ﬁrst generator of cobordism. See [15].
The surgery argument didn’t work! For example, an eight dimen-
sional cycle would have a 3 dimensional stratum with transversal
link C P2. Surgery could ﬁrst be done in dimension 3 then extended
over the 8-dimensional stratum to pick up a relative obstruction in
the middle dimension there. So far so good! However, in a homology
of this sort between two eight dimensional cycles of this sort, a rel-
ative surgery obstruction along the homology of the 3 dimensional
stratum could appear and be multiplied by C P2 (the link) to inﬂu-
ence and change the eight dimensional obstruction [9]. No apriori
invariants here! I was so disappointed, that in a pique I threw my
entire singularities notebook overboard into the North Sea.
Upon calmer reﬂection, there was a lot to be said for the situation
on the positive side. The argument seemed to work for singularities
based on manifolds with signature zero, and with these one could
create a new homology theory with coeﬃcients agreeing with those
of the obstruction theory at odd primes
(0 Z2 0 Z 0 Z2 0 Z . . . )⊗Z [1/2] = (0 0 0 Z [1/2] 0 0 0 Z [1/2] . . . ) .

264
Also the argument showed there really was indeterminacy in the
odd primary obstructions with the prime p causing trouble around
dimension 2p, as usual predicted by the Steenrod reduced pth powers.
It seemed the surgery obstruction theory, completely decided in
terms of ordinary cohomology theory at the prime 2, was equivalent
at odd primes to a 4-periodic homology theory with the same groups
of a point as real K-theory at odd primes – KO ⊗Z [1/2].
Actually, one could even prove an equivalence using a variant
of the work Conner-Floyd and Landweber – see [16].
Whereas
they could prove complex bordism theory Z-tensored over the Todd
genus was complex K-theory, we could see by similar methods that
smooth bordism Z [1/2]-tensored over the signature (or Hirzebruch
L-genus) was Z [1/2]-tensored real K-theory. Furthermore, the sig-
nature surgery obstructions gave a map from the obstruction theory
at odd primes to KO ⊗Z [1/2], providing the desired equivalence.
Again I am getting ahead of the story. In point of fact this latter
argument was completed in Princeton around the time of the birth
of my second daughter Amanda (October ‘66), and came about as
a kind of rescue.
There was earlier a funny talk (by me) at the June 1966 Ar-
beitstagung in Bonn that one could prove a good theorem about
the Hauptvermutung for a manifold if every homology class in that
manifold was Steenrod representable, but that as was well known
the latter fact (seemingly unrelated) was sometimes false. The con-
nection with the Hauptvermutung came about because almost all
the apriori surgery obstructions for f : L →M could be shown to be
zero for a homeomorphism f, employing the arguments Novikov [10]
used to show that the rational Pontryagin classes were topological

265
invariants. The only snag was the argument only gave 2O = 0 for
the obstruction O in H4(M; Z).
Thus as more and more obstructions became “apriori” they could
be shown to be zero for homeomorphisms (with the exception in
H4(M; Z)) and better and better results about the Hauptvermutung
became true.
The idea arose then that all the obstructions that could not be
described apriori by surgery obstructions were in fact completely
indeterminant and didn’t matter in the sense they could be avoided
by redeforming on lower skeleta.
A complex argument using the above singularities was developed
during the summer of ‘66 to complete the analysis of odd primary
obstructions and the concomitant vanishing theorem for homeomor-
phisms with a Hauptvermutung corollary 1.
During a series of lectures on this argument with singularities at
Princeton (fall ‘66) a problem developed with the product structure
for the singularities. This was solved using the above results relating
the above theory with singularities, bordism, and KO ⊗Z [1/2], and
the product structure in the latter. A crucial role was played by
Pontryagin duality for K-theory at odd primes, for n odd
Hom(KO∗( , Z /n), Z /n) ≃KO∗( , Z /n) .
The Pontryagin duality as well as the connection with bordism is
false at the prime 2 for KO-theory. (Actually KO is related to spin
bordism. Also KO( , Z /2) is not a multiplicative theory, which I had
learned from Luke Hodgkin in England).
These issues motivated the localization of homotopy theory at
two and at odd primes described in Part I. But why worry about
the rational theory and the proﬁnite completion?
1The result was for simply connected manifolds of dimension at least ﬁve. Namely, a home-
omorphism between combinatorial manifolds was homotopic to a combinatorial equivalence
unless a certain obstruction of order two in the fourth integral cohomology vanished. Two
years later Siebenmann’s work showed that the order two obstruction was realized. Kirby
and he had already shown somewhat earlier that a homeomorphism between combinatorial
manifolds of dimension ﬁve or greater was isotopic to a combinatorial equivalence if a certain
obstruction in the third cohomology with mod two coeﬃcients vanished, and non simply
connected manifolds were included. These two obstructions are related by the integral Bock-
stein (Kirby and Siebenmann [6]).
In the early eighties Donaldson discovered an inﬁnite
and realized obstruction for deforming a homeomorphism to a combinatorial equivalence in
dimension four [2], given that Freedman had simultaneously shown homotopy equivalence
and homeomorphism were almost the same in dimension four [3].

266
The Adams conjecture about K(X) and the spherical ﬁbre homo-
topy types J(X), if proved, allowed the analysis of the PL obstruc-
tion theory at odd primes to be extended to the smooth theory in the
sense that the theory could be related to a standard homotopy con-
struction. Motivated by a suggestion in characteristic p of Quillen, I
found a simple proof of the Adams conjecture (Aug ‘67 for complex
K-theory) that only used the existence of etale homotopy theory in
characteristic zero. In order to beneﬁt from the etale construction in
algebraic geometry one had to produce the proﬁnite completion of
the homotopy type described in the notes. Then the results about
the smooth obstruction theory followed. There was a small snag for
a while concerning real as opposed to complex Grassmannians that
lead to the conjecture about homotopy theoretic ﬁxed points – later
proved by Haynes Miller [8].
The arithmetic square in the notes showed how Z information
could be recovered from Q information and proﬁnite information.
Since the proﬁnite part seemed to ﬁt with abstract algebra because
of the etale theory, I wondered whether the Q information was re-
lated to abstract analysis – for example diﬀerential forms.
An answer arose in the following way in the months at MIT just
prior to the birth of my ﬁrst son Michael (February ‘72)
Frank Peterson had told me that Quillen (then also at MIT) had
an algebraic model of rational homotopy theory [11]. In 1970 I had
wanted to explore the structure of the representation of Aut(X) on
H∗(X) for X a ﬁnite simply-connected homotopy type. I guessed
that Aut(X) should be an arithmetic group and the representation
came from an algebraic group homomorphism
Aut(X)Q →Gl(H∗(X; Q)) .

267
In trying to put together the various ideas above, the minimal mod-
els derivable from Q-forms on polyhedra in the sense of Whitney,
and the subsequent model of rational homotopy theory were found.
The above arithmetic and algebraic group conjecture could also be
proved in this way very transparently [17].
Earlier, a more com-
plicated proof using Kan’s machinery (as in Quillen’s theory) was
found by me and independently by Clarence Wilkerson [21].
About this time dynamical systems, hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian
groups, and quasiconformal analysis which concerned more the geom-
etry of the manifold than its algebra began to distract me (see ICM
report 1974), and some of the work mentioned above was left in-
complete and unpublished.
For example, one new project began in the 1980’s in fractal geom-
etry – the Feigenbaum universal constant associated to period dou-
bling – presents a new kind of epistemological problem. Numeri-
cal calculations showed that a certain mathematical statement of
geometric rigidity in dynamics was almost certainly true, but the
available mathematical technique did not seem adequate. Thus as-
suming the result was true there had to be new ideas in mathematics
to prove it. The project consumed the years up to the birth of my
second son Thomas in July ‘88 [18].
This same kind of epistemological point occurs again when we get
back to the algebraic thread of the story.
The return of my attention to algebra and the underlying alge-
braic nature of a manifold came about in the following way.
At a physics lecture at IHES in 1991 I learned the astonishing (to
me) fact that the fundamental equations of hydrodynamics in three
dimensions were not known to have the appropriate solutions. Yet

268
engineers used these equations to predict the observable aspects of
ﬂuid motion.
I needed a break after the long renormalization program posed
by Feigenbaum’s numerics and I tried to understand the nature of
the diﬃculties in the PDE analysis – not necessarily to solve them
– which arose from the nonlinear terms in the equations. One could
make several observations.
(I) The diﬃculties in the Navier-Stokes equation could be related to
the diﬃculties in the foundations of quantum ﬁeld theory – multi-
plying currents or distributions in the dual spaces of smooth objects
like diﬀerential forms. (Actually such algebraic diﬃculties also arose
in earlier attempts to ﬁnd local combinatorial formulae for the sig-
nature and the Pontryagin classes [13]).
(II) Also much progress was happening on the quantum physics side
by bypassing the analytic issues about foundations and pursuing the
algebraic structure per se. In fact many things relating the topology
of manifolds and quantum physics were discovered. In the physics
formalism there was evidence of a role to be played by variants of
the algebraic models of rational homotopy theory. By the time my
third son Ricardo was born in September ‘95
I had begun to dream about using transversality and cell decompo-
sitions to apply nontrivial algebra from algebraic topology to hard
problems like Navier-Stokes or foundational quantum ﬁeld theory.
This would be guided by understanding the role of model ideas from
algebraic topology in that part of quantum ﬁeld theory which was
rigorous mathematics – 1) conformal ﬁeld theory, 2), 3) gauge theory
invariants of 4-manifolds and 3-manifolds, 4) J-holomorphic curves
in symplectic manifolds, and 5) generalized Kodaira Spencer theory.

269
These theories oﬀer new vistas for answering the question what
is a manifold (what is space time) to be added to the perspective
at the beginning of the story of surgery theory d’apres Browder,
Novikov, Wall and Ranicki.
The second occurrence of the curious epistemological idea happens
here. All of the above mentioned mathematical theories are united
in the minds of theoretical physicists such as Vafa and Witten as
being diﬀerent aspects of quantum ﬁeld theory. To me this seems al-
most irrefutable evidence that such a synthesis actually exists inside
mathematics. What is this synthesis?
Problem 1 Formulate an algebraic Math QFT deﬁnition which will
be realized by some or all of the above ﬁve theories 1), 2), 3), 4), 5).
Conjecture 1 Such a formulation will utilize a new abstract deﬁnition
of a manifold – e.g. over the rationals a diﬀerential graded algebra
satisfying Poincar´e duality in some appropriate form.
There is some nontrivial information about Conjecture 1.
The
above analysis of the odd primary obstruction theory of my thesis
in terms of KO⊗Z [1/2] lead to the idea of a manifold (at odd primes)
as a homotopy type enriched by Poincar´e duality for KO ⊗Z[1/2]
(as well as satisfying Poincar´e duality for ordinary homology) [16].
Later Ranicki’s algebraic surgery theory allowed a complete result
to be stated over Z (namely for all the primes and Q) that a manifold
(in the topological sense, simply-connected, and of dimension ⩾4)
could be modeled by a homotopy type satisfying Poincar´e duality in
an appropriate (and subtle) local sense at the level of the integral
chains for homology [12].
Recently (2003), Michael Mandell [7] has shown that a ﬁnite-
type simply-connected homotopy type is determined by the integer
cochains provided with the system of higher homotopies related to
the cup product being inﬁnitely homotopy associative and graded
commutative (extending Steenrod’s original system of homotopies
producing Steenrod squares and Steenrod reduced powers).
A natural question arises to combine Mandell’s and Ranicki’s the-
ories.
Problem 2 Construct an algebraic model of a simply-connected closed
topological manifold as an integral chain complex with a hierarchy of
chain homotopies expressing its structure as an inﬁnitely homotopy

270
associative, graded commutative, Poincar´e duality algebra. (All di-
mensions).
Conjecture 2 Over Q, there is a construction of the rational char-
acteristic classes from the models of the rational homotopy type
appropriately enriched with Poincar´e duality.
Actually, I once asked a theoretical physicist (going my way on
the Manhattan subway): what is an oﬀshell topological string theory
(for him)? His response was a diﬀerential graded algebra satisfying
Poincar´e duality. In some situations the adjective oﬀshell (as op-
posed to onshell) for a physicist means at the level of cochains or
diﬀerential forms (as opposed to the homology level) for a topolo-
gist. With Moira Chas I have studied some algebraic topology in
the loop space of a manifold called string topology [1]. This used
transversality to construct new algebraic structures which are mys-
terious but attractive for their simplicity of deﬁnition – although
they are no comparison to our new daughter (my third) Clara born
in April ‘02
The use of local transversality to construct new algebraic struc-
tures in mapping spaces of circles or surfaces into a target man-
ifold conjecturally goes beyond the topological category to probe
the combinatorial or smooth structure. This is only about the ﬁ-
nite obstruction theory mentioned above (augmented by the Z /2 of
Rochlin’s theorem) in higher dimensions but would be a signiﬁcant
factor in dimension 4 because of Donaldson’s results about the pos-
sible inﬁnitude of combinatorial structures (or equivalently smooth
structures) on a given topological manifold structure. This inﬁni-
tude also uses Freedman’s results [3] to go from homotopy type to
homeomorphism type.

271
Conjecture 3 A smooth manifold M has additional algebraic struc-
ture in the chains of mapping spaces of surfaces with or without
boundary into M, which is obtained by looking at transversal singu-
larities and coincidences. These deﬁne structures like those from the
topological string theories in physics. These structures interact non-
trivially with Casson’s lifting of Rochlin’s invariant (the latter being
responsible for the 2O problem above), the Vassiliev and Vaughan
Jones invariants in dimension 3 and Donaldson invariants in dimen-
sion 4.
Problem 3 Formulate some of these structures more precisely – along
the lines of algebraic models with Poincar´e duality.
Finally, let us return to algebraic varieties and Galois symmetry.
The obstruction theory above and the work of these notes shows the
following result (planned for Part II): consider a nonsingular alge-
braic variety V deﬁned over some ﬁeld of algebraic numbers, and
the proﬁnite equivalence VC →proﬁnite etale homotopy type as a
manifold structure on a proﬁnite homotopy type satisfying Poincar´e
duality. The result is that the action of Gal(Q/ Q) on the topolog-
ical manifold structure (π1 = {1}, dimC ⩾3) factors through the
abelianized Galois group bZ
∗. I think something similar is true for
the smooth manifold structure set – or at least it should be possible
to analyze it using the end of Part I, the ICM ‘70 paper following
and the footnote 8 there.
Problem 4 Analyze the action of Gal(Q/ Q) on the smooth manifold
structure set on a proﬁnite homotopy type associated to nonsingular
algebraic varieties deﬁned over Q (including π1 ̸= {1} and dimC = 2)
One should be careful here because even for elliptic curves the ac-
tion of Gal(Q/ Q) on H1(torus) contains much arithmetic information
(Kazhdan communication).
We have two sorts of Galois symmetry which need to be synthe-
sized, thanks to proﬁnite homotopy theory.
Conjecture 4 There is a concrete context with symmetry in struc-
ture which synthesizes these two compatible contexts, nonsingular
simply connected algebraic varieties over Q with dimC > 2 and
Gal(Q/ Q) symmetry, and simply connected topological manifolds
with dimR > 4 and the bZ
∗symmetry on the invariants (deﬁned us-
ing the isomorphic part of the Adams operations at odd primes from

272
Part I and the cohomological construction of the ICM ‘70 paper and
footnote 8 there at the prime 2).
By concrete context I mean something like replace a manifold or
variety by the inverse system or limit of its ﬁnite (branched) covers
to obtain solenoidal manifolds with branching singularities [19]. The
symmetries might be combinatorially deﬁned by rearrangement of
the branched covers.
To this end I once noticed (Berkeley ‘68-‘69) that any ﬁnite co-
eﬃcient cohomology class of a manifold could be killed by passing
to a ﬁnite branched cover. This uses transversality and the repre-
sentation of Eilenberg MacLane spaces as large symmetric products
of simple spaces. Thus one could construct an analogue of the etale
site (see Part I) in algebraic geometry for any smooth manifold as a
possible ﬁrst step to Conjecture 4 - which was a kind of unrequited
Jugendtraum for me.
