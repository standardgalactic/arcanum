Preface 
This book grew out of a Survey Lecture given to the Association for 
Symbolic Logic meeting in January 1969 and is based on a course at the 
University of Wisconsin in the spring of 1969. It is planned both as a 
textbook for an advanced graduate course and as a reference for research 
work in mathematical logic. 
We have written for the reader who already has a thorough knowledge 
of ‘classical’ model theory, that is, model theory for the usual first order 
predicate logic. The necessary background is given in the book MODEL 
THEORY 
by C. C. Chang and H. J. Keisler. 
In recent years model theory has grown beyond first order logic, and 
one of the most exciting developments has been model theory for in- 
finitary logic. In this book we have decided to restrict our attention once 
and for all to the most fruitful part of infinitary logic to date, the logic 
L,,, . This logic is built up from the first order predicate logic L by allow- 
ing countably infinite disjunctions and conjunctions. Our aim is to pre- 
sent the model theory for L,,, in a form which makes the overall structure 
as clear as possible. We shall give particular emphasis to the methods 
which are used for constructing models, and on their relation to the 
methods available in classical model theory. 
After reading this book the student can go on to the study of the larger 
infinitary logies L,, in the forthcoming book LARGE INFINITARY 
LANGU- 
AGES by M. A. Dickmann. 
The first wave of results in the model theory of L,,, 
came around 1963 
with the work of Karp (Completeness Theorem), Scott (countable mod-

els), Morley (computation of the Hanf number), and Lopez-Escobar 
(Interpolation Theorem). 
A second wave around 1967 began with of Kreisel’s observation that 
the classification of infinitary languages Lab by the cardinals a, 
is too 
crude for many purposes. In particular, the full language L,,, 
has un- 
countably many formulas. This wave contains the study of the sublan- 
guages L, 
of L,,, 
given by an admissible set d, initiated by Barwise. 
Another important recent development is the use of Consistency Prop- 
erties in the model theory of L,,, 
by Makkai. Many of the early proofs 
in the subject made heavy use of proof theoretic methods, but the work 
of Makkai has made a more model-theoretic treatment possible. 
The earlier portion of this book presents the basic model-theoretic 
results on L,,, 
in the light of the work of Barwise and Makkai. Later on, 
the book continues with topics such as categoricity, models of power wl, 
and some applications to set theory. It contains some results of the author 
which have not previously appeared in the literature. 
The book is divided into four parts. At the beginning of each part a new 
method of constructing models is introduced: the Henkin construction 
in Part I, Skolem functions and indiscernible sets in Part ZZ, elementary 
chains in Part IZI, and ultrapowers in Part IV. The four parts are divided 
further into lectures. Each of the thirty-four lectures corresponds roughly 
to one lecture given in the author’s course at Wisconsin in 1969, except 
that the boundaries between lectures have been adjusted to match the chan- 
ges of topics. In the earlier portion of the book where the basic material 
is covered, several problem sets have k e n  included. The end of a proof 
is indicated by the symbol -1. 
The author wishes to thank the many colleagues who offered helpful 
suggestions in the preparation of this book, and owes a special debt 
to Jon Barwise, C. C. Chang, Kenneth Kunen, and Saharon Shelah.

Introduction 
As we have stated in the preface, we shall assume that the reader al- 
ready has a knowledge of model theory for first order predicate logic. 
We shall begin with a brief discussion of various languages which go be- 
yond first order logic. 
are two infinite cardinals, then the infinitary logic L,, is 
like first order logic except that it allows the conjunction and disjunction 
of a set of fewer than ct formulas, has ct individual variables, and allows 
universal and existential quantification on a set of fewer than fi variables. 
In particular, L,, 
is the classical first order logic. The next simplest case 
is the language L,,,, which allows countable conjunctions and disjunc- 
tions but only finite quantifiers. Many of the results of this book carry 
over in some form to the languages La,, or sometimes even to the La,. 
However, we have decided to limit our scope to the language L,,,, with 
countably many relation and function symbols. The loss in generality is 
made up for by a much smoother theory. 
The language L,,, 
is closely related to several other extensions of 
first order logic, including the following. 
1. w-logic, which is like first order logic except that it has an extra one- 
placed relation symbol Nand constants 0, I ,  2,3, . . .. In the model theory 
of w-logic we admit only models fl such that the set N of natural numbers 
is a subset of A, and we interpret Nand 0, 1,2,3, . . . in the natural way. 
2. Weak second order logic, which has variables for finite sequences of 
elements as well as individual variables, and has an operation of concate- 
nation of finite sequences and a membership relation.

3. Second order logic in which the set variables are interpreted as ranging 
over finite sets. 
4. First order logic with the additional quantifier (Qx) which means 
‘there exist infinitely many’. 
Of all these languages, L,,, 
has proven to be the most convenient. 
The main defect of first order logic is that it is not adequate for expressing 
most mathematical concepts. There are many important notions from 
mathematics which can be expressed in L,,, but not in first order logic. 
Here are some examples of classes of models characterized by a sentence 
(a) The class of all finite models, 
of LUJ,,. 
v 3x, . . . xnVy(y = X I  v.. . v y  = x,). 
n < o  
(b) The class of all models isomorphic to the standard model of arith- 
metic. Add to Peano’s axioms the axiom 
Vx(x = o v x  = O ‘ V X  = 0”v.. .). 
(c) The class of Archimedean ordered fields. 
(d) The class of Abelian torsion groups. 
(e) The class of all models (21 = ( A ,  0, - I ,  U) where ( A ,  0, - I )  
is 
a group and U is a set of generators of 2l. Add to the group axioms the 
axiom 
tlX v 3Uo...u,-I A ~ ( U m ) V ~ ( U ~ l ) A X = u g O ( U I O  
... O U n - l ) .  
n < o  
m < n  
(f) The class of models 
= (R, F )  where F is a field and R is the ring 
of all polynomials in one variable with coefficients in F. 
The language L,,,, 
is much more powerful than L,,,. 
For example in 
L,,,, 
the following sentence characterizes the class of all well-orderings 
(21 = ( A ,  <): 
The order axioms plus the axiom 
1 
( 3 x O x 1 ~ 2  *) A x n + 1  < X n .  
n < o  
We shall see in Lecture. 10 that the concept of a well ordering cannot 
be expressed in L,,,. 

11 
INTRODUCTION 
5 
Very often it is useful to study well behaved sublanguages L, 
of L,,, 
instead of the whole language L,,,. 
One reason for this is that L,,, 
has uncountably many formulas. Later on we shall introduce the concept 
of afragment L, of L,,,, 
and the stronger notion of a logic Ld over an 
admissible set d. 
As this course proceeds we shall use a few important techniques again 
and again. The reader should watch for these techniques and use them 
as a way of comparing the model theory of L,,, 
with the model theory of 
first order logic. We single out seven basic methods and list them here. 
A. Constructing models from individual constants (the Henkin con- 
struction). 
B. Skolem functions. 
C. Indiscernible elements. 
D. Elementary chains. 
E. Ultraproducts. 
F. Adding new symbols to the language. 
G. Passing from a fragment L, 
t L,,, 
to a larger fragment La c L,,,. 
All of these methods except the last are available in the model theory 
of first order logic. The presence of the additional method G adds a whole 
new dimension to the subject, and makes the model theory for L,,, 
much 
more than a simple generalization of classical model theory. The most 
useful result in classical model theory is the Compactness Theorem. The 
result for L,,, 
which plays a role most like the Compactness Theorem 
in classical model theory is the Model Existence Theorem, which appears 
to be the fundamental result in the subject. Although the Compactness 
Theorem in its original form is not true for L,,,, 
it can be generalized 
in a less straightforward way to the Barwise Compactness Theorem. In a 
similar manner, many of the other basic results of classical model theory, 
such as the Lowenheim-Skolem Theorem, generalize in rather unexpect- 
ed ways to theorems for L,,,. 
We shall use ordinary set-theoretic notation, and always assume 
the axiom of choice. Ordinals are defined so that each ordinal a is equal 
to the set of all smaller ordinals, and cardinals are identified with initial 
ordinals. The set of all subsets of Xis denoted by S(X). 
We shall assume throughout these lectures that L is a first order logic

with countably many relation, function, and constant symbols, the logical 
symbols 
-7, A, v,v,3, =, 
and w1 variables 
1'0, u 1 , .  . . u,, . . ., c1 < 0 1 .  
The language L,,, 
has the same symbols as L, but in L,,, the conjunc- 
tion symbol A and disjunction symbol V may be applied to countable 
or finite sets of formulas as well as to pairs of formulas. 
The class of allformulas of L,,, is the least class Xsuch that: 
(i) Each atomic formula of L is in A'. 
(ii) If cp E X and u < o1 then (7 cp) E X, Vu,cp E X, and 3u,q E A'. 
(iii) If @ is a finite or countable, non-empty, subset of X, then A @ E X 
and V@EX. 
All this is done within set theory. For definiteness, we agree that each 
variable u, is the ordered pair (u, sc), 
and each of the other symbols of L 
is a natural number. Atomic formulas are finite sequences of symbols. 
1 
cp is the ordered pair (1, 
cp), A @ is ( A, a), and Vv,q is (V, urn, cp), 
while V and 3 are treated in the same way. Thus each formulaof L,,, 
is a set. Informally we shall use parentheses for readability instead of 
angular brackets and commas. 
Free variables, models % = ( A , .  . .) for L, and satisfaction of for- 
mulas of L,,, 
in %, are defined as usual. We use cp(x, . . . x,) to denote 
a formula whose free variables are included in the set {xl, . . ., x,}. A 
sentence is a formula with no free variables. We shall usually be con- 
cerned only with formulas having finitely many free variables. The satis- 
faction notation 
8 k q[a1 . . . a,] 
means that (a,, . . ., a,) satisfies q(x, . . . x,) in %. The notation % 
'13 
means that 8 and 23 are isomorphic, and % c '13 means % is a submodel 
of B. We let % = %(L), % = %(Lola), mean that % and 8 satisfy exactly 
the same formulas in L, or L,,, , respectively. 
We introduce the abbreviations +, H, in the usual way, for implication 
and equivalence.

if we allow 23 to be uncountable.

Model Existence Theorem 
Two basic results for L are the Compactness Theorem (If C is a set of 
sentences of L and every finite subset of C has a model, then C has a 
model), and the Upward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem (If a set I: 
of sentences of L has an infinite model of power a, then it has models of 
all powers fl > a). The example below shows that both of these results 
fail for L,,,. 
EXAMPLE. 
Let co, cl, c 2 , .  . ., c, be constants for L. Let C be the set of 
sentences 
(VX) v (x = cn), c, # co, c, # c1,. . .. 
n < o  
Then every finite subset of C has a model but C has no model. Moreover, 
the first sentence in the above list has a model of power o but no un- 
countable model. 
The failure of the Compactness Theorem makes model theory for 
L,,, 
radically different from model theory for L. Our next theorem can 
frequently be used in L,,, 
in situations where the Compactness Theorem 
was used in L. It gives the essential content of Henkin’s construction 
which Henkin first used to prove the Godel Completeness Theorem in 
1949. The result in the present form is due to Makkai, and it evolved from 
work of Henkin, Smullyan, and others. We first need some definitions. 
The set of subformulas of a formula cp of L,,,, 
denoted by sub(cp), is 
defined inductively as follows: 
If cp is an atomic formula, sub(cp) = {cp}. 
10 

MODEL EXlSTENCE THEOREM 
31 
I 1  
sub(7 cp) = sub(cp) u { 7 
cp}. 
sub(Vxcp) = sub(cp) u (Vxcp}, 
sub(A@) = urp4 
sub(cp) u {A@}, 
and similarly for 3 and V. 
It is clear from the definition that for every formula cp of L,,,, 
sub(cp) 
is finite or countable. Moreover, if cp has only finitely many free variables, 
so does every $ E sub(cp). 
We now introduce a fundamentally important notion, that of a con- 
sistency property. Let C be a countable set of new constant symbols, 
and let M be the language formed by adding each c E C to L. We may 
then form the infinitary logic M,,, 
corresponding to M. 
A consistency property is a set S of countable sets of sentences of 
M,,, 
which has certain properties to be listed below. To motivate the 
definition we mention that the simplest example of a consistency property 
is the set of all countable sets s of sentences of M,,, 
such that s has a mo- 
del 
with universe A = {uc: c E C } .  As we shall see, there are also many 
other examples. 
Let us first introduce some convenient notation. 
Given a formula v, of M,,,, 
the formula cp l, obtained by 'moving a

(Arpe@cp) 1

(V,€@cp) 1 
is Acps@ 
140. 
(Vxcp) 
is 3x 
cp. 
(3xcp) 1 
is Vx 
cp. 
Thus we see that cp 
is always logically equivalent to 1 
cp. 
DEFINITION. 
Let S be a set of countable sets of sentences of M,,,. s is 
said to be a consistency property iff for each s E S, all of the following 
hold. 
(Cl) (Consistency rule) Either cp 4 s or ( 
(C2) (1-rule) If (-, cp) E s then s u {cp l}

(C3) (A-rule) If (A@) E S  then for all cp E @, s u (cp) E S.

(C6) (%rule) If (3xcp(x)) E s, then for some c E C, s u {cp(c)} E S. 
By a basic term we mean either a constant symbol or a term of the form 
F(c,, . . ., c,) where cl, . . ., c, E C and F is a function symbol of L. 
(C7) (Equality rules). Let t be a basic term and c, d~ C.

If c = t, cp(t) E s, then s u (cp(c)> E S. 
For some e E C, s u {e = t }  E S. 
Before proceeding further, some remarks and examples are in order. 
REMARK 
1. If S is a consistency property, so are each of the following: 
The set of all subsets of elements of S; 
The set of all s E S in which only finitely many constants c E C occur; 
The set of all finite subsets of elements of S.

s E s.

If ~ E S ,  
c, d, e E C ,  and (c = d), ( d =  e)Es, then su{c = e } E S .  
Each of the sets below is a consistency property, where s ranges over 
the set of all countable sets of sentences in M,,,.

The next theorem is the main result which gives the notion of a consisten- 
cy property importance. It is a very general criterion for the existence of a 
model. The theorem is due to MAKKAI [1969] and is closely related to 
earlier work of HENKIN [I9631 and SMULLYAN 
[1963], [1965]. 

31 
MODEL EXISTENCE THEOREM 
13 
THEOREM 
2. (MODEL EXISTENCE 
THEOREM). 
If S is a consistency property and so E S, then so has a model. 
PROOF. 
We may assume without loss of generality that every subset of 
a member of S belongs to S. Let Y be the least set of sentences such that 
so c y; 
Y is closed under subformulas; 
If t is a term, c E C, and cp(t) E Y, then p(c) E Y; 
If (7 cp) E Y then (cp 7) E Y ;  
J f c , d E C t h e n c = d E Y .  
The set Y is clearly countable. Let X be the set of all sentences in Y, and 
put X = {cpo, q l ,  cpz, . . .}. Let T = {to, ri, t 2 ,  . . .} be the set of all 
basic terms of L. We shall construct a sequence so c s1 c s2 c . . . of 
elements of S as follows. 
so E S is already given. Suppose we have s,, E S. Then using the de- 
finition of consistency property, we may choose s,,+ such that: 
(1) sn c sn+i ES. 
(2) If s,, u {cp,,} 
E S then cp,, E s , , + ~ .  
(3) If s,, u {cp,,} 
E Sand cp,, = V@, then for some 8 E @, 8 E s,+ 1. 
(4) If s,, u {cp,} 
E S and cpn = 3xcp(x), then for some c E C, cp(c) E s,,+ 1. 
( 5 )  For some c E C, (c = t,,) E s , , + ~ .  
We now define a model c1I of so. Let s, = Un<,s,,. For c, d E C, let 
c 
d iff 
(c = ~ ) E s , .  
It follows from (C7) that - is an equivalence relation on C. For example, 
suppose c, d, e E C and (c = d) ES,, 
(d = e) ES,. Then (c = e) E X 
so for some rn, c = e is (P,. 
Taken 2 m so that (c = d), (d = e)Es,. 
Then by(C7), s,, u {c = e} ES, whences, u {c = e} E Sand (c = e)E s,+ 
I .  
Let 3 have the universe set A = {c/- : c E C } .  By (C7), if ~ ( c ,  . . . c,,) 
E s, and c1 - d, , . . ., c,, - d,,, then q(d1 . . . d,,) E s,. 
Therefore we may 
interpret the relation, constant, and function symbols of M in 
in such 
a way that: 
(6) If t is a basic term and c E C, then c1I k c = t iff (c = t )  E s,; 

14 
MODEL EXISTENCE THEOREM 
[3 
(7) If R is an n-placed relation symbol and cl, . . ., c, E C, then 
k R(c, . . . c,) 
iff R(c, . . . c,) E s,. 
The conditions (6) and (7) determine the model a. By an induction on the 
complexity of terms it can then be shown using (Cl) and (C7) that any 
atomic sentence or negated atomic sentence in s, 
holds in a. Finally, 
using rules (C2)-(C6) and induction on the complexity of sentences, 
we see that every sentence in s, holds in a. Therefore 9l is a model of 
s, and hence a model of so .4 
REMARK. 
The model 2l in the above proof is at most countable. In fact, 
it has the additional property that every U E A  is the interpretation of 
some c E C, namely each c/- is the interpretation of c. 
Note that in the proof the rules (Cl) and (C7) were only needed for 
the case where cp is an atomic or negated atomic sentence. Thus the Model 
Existence Theorem still holds for a slightly weaker notion of Consistency 
Property. 
The following corollary is a useful generalization of the Model Existen- 
ce Theorem. 
COROLLARY 
(EXTENDED 
MODEL EXISTENCE 
THEOREM). 
Let S be a consistency property and let r be a countable set of sentences 
in the language M,,,. 
Assume that for all s E S and cp E r, s u (9) 
E S. 
Then for all s E S, s u r has a model. 
PROOF. Define 
S' = { S U  r : s E s } .  
It is easy to check that S' is a consistency property. Let s E S. Then 
s u r E S', whence by the Model Existence Theorem, s v r has a mode1.i

Completeness Theorem 
For the next few lectures we shall let C be a countable set of constant 
symbols which are not in the language L, and let M be the language for- 
med by adding each c E C to L. M,,, 
is the infinitary logic corresponding 
to M. 
We shall now take up the task of choosing a list of axioms and rules 
of inference for La,, and proving a completeness theorem for this lan- 
guage. In this theorem and in many other proofs, we shall use the lan- 
guage M,,, as a tool for obtaining results about our given language L,,, . 
In what follows, x, y are arbitrary variables, cp, $ are arbitrary formulas 
of L,,,, and @ is an arbitrary countable set of formulas of L,,,. 
AXIOMS 
FOR L,,,: 
1. Every instance of a tautology of finitary propositional logic is an 
axiom. 
2. (1 
cp) - 
(cp 1). 
3. A@ - cp, where cp E @. 
4. Vxcp(x. . . ) -+ q(r. . .), where cp(x. . .) is a formula, t is a term which 
is free for x in q ( x .  . .), and q ( t .  . .) is obtained by replacing each free 
occurrence of x by t.

COMPLETENESS THEOREM 
[4 
7. cp(x. . .)A t = x --f cp(r . . .), where cp(x . . .) and q(r. . .) are as in 3 
above. 
RULES 
OF INFERENCE FOR LaL,: 
1. From JI, $ 4 cp, infer cp. 
2. From JI 4 cp(x.. .), infer JI -+ Vxcp(x. . .), where x does not occur 
free in JI. 
3. From JI -+ 
cp, for all cp E @, infer $ + A@. 
The set of theorems of L,,, 
is the least set of formulas of L,,, which 
contains all the axioms and is closed under the rules of inference. kL,,, 
cp 
means that cp is a theorem of L,,,. 
Obviously, a necessary and sufficient condition for tLolocp is that there 
exist a countable sequence cpo, cpl, . . . q a , .  . ., cppp such that qs = cp 
and for each CI =< p, cprt is either an axiom of L,,, 
or is inferred from 
earlier formulas cpy, y < CI, by a rule of inference. Such a sequence is 
called a proof of cp. 
A formula is said to be valid, k cp, iff cp is satisfied in every model for 
L by every interpretation of the free variables of cp.

If cp is a sentence of L,,,,

PROOF. 
Any theorem of L,,, 
is valid, because the axioms are valid and 
the rules of inference preserve validity. 
For any sentence cp of L,,,, 
we have t-Lolwcp if and only if kMwlwq. 
Because any proof in L,,, is a proof in M,,,. 
And given any proof in 
M,,, , only countably many variables occur in the proof, so we can ob- 
tain a proof in L,,, 
by replacing in a uniform way each occurrence of 
each c E C by a variable which does not occur in the given proof. 
Let S be the set of all finite sets s of sentences of M,,, 
such that only 
finitely many c E C occur in s, and not 
We claim that S is a consistency property. To illustrate, we check that 
S satisfies (C5), (C6), and (C7) in the definition of consistency property.

The other parts of the proof are left to the student.i 
We now introduce the notion of a fragment of L,,, 
and generalize 
the completeness theorem to fragments. One of the difficulties in the 
logic L,,, is that it has uncountably many formulas. For many purposes 
it is better to consider ‘nice’ countable subsets of the set of formulas of 
L,,, . The notion of a fragment is a first, crude approximation to a ‘nice’ 
set of formulas.

Craig Interpolation Theorem 
THEOREM 
4 (CRAIG INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
FOR Lm1,). 
Let cp, I) be sentences of L,,, 
such that != cp + I). Then there is a sentence 
8 of L,,, 
such that t cp + 8, t 8 + I), and every relation, function, or 
constant symbol of L which occurs in 8 occurs both in cp and in Ic/. 
(The above result is due to LOPEZ-ESCOBAR 
[1965], who gave a proof- 
theoretic argument using cut elimination. The result generalizes a theorem 
of Craig for first order logic. The proof below is due to Makkai, and is 
an adaptation to L,,, 
of a proof of Craig’s Theorem for L by Henkin.) 
PROOF. Let X ,  be the set of all sentences cp‘ of M,,, 
such that every 
relation, constant, or function symbol of L which occurs in cp’ occurs 
in cp, and also only finitely many c E C occur in cp’. Define X, similarly. 
Let S be the set of all finite sets s of sentences of M,,, 
which can be ex- 
pressed as a union s = s1 u s2 such that: 
(1) 81 = X,, 
s2 = X,. 
(2) If 8,, 
O2 E Xp n X ,  and k A s1 -+ el, c A s2 -+ 02, then 8, A O2 is 
consistent. 
We claim that S is a consistency property. Let us show, for example, 
that (C5) holds for S. Let s = s1 u s2 E S and VZ E s. Assume first 
that V Z E S ~ .  
Then V Z E  X, and C c X,. We shall show that for 
some a E Z, s’ = s u {a} E S with s; = s, u {a}, si = s2. 
Suppose not. Then for all a E Z there exist el,, OZg E X, n X, such 
that

A e,,. 
and el, A 8,, is inconsistent. But then 
a E z  
a d  
Thus if we put 
= VasXOla, 8, = /\,EZ8Z,, we see that (1) and (2 
are contradicted. This shows that S has the property (C5). 
The case that VZ E s, is similar. The other parts of the proof that : 
is a consistency property are left to the reader. We remark that (C6) de 
pends on the fact that only finitely many c E C occur in each s E S. Fo 
(C7) we note that we may assume that each relation constant, or functioi 
symbol of L occurs in cp or $. Recalling that the terms in (C7) are basil 
terms, we see that all the equations c = t belong to either X ,  or X,. 
Since Sis a consistency property, by the Model Existence Theorem eacl 
s E S has a model. But != cp -, $, so the set {cp, 1 
$} has no model 
Therefore {cp, 1 
$} # S. Also, cp E X,, $ E X ,  . This means that we cai 
find 8,, 8, EX, n X, such that 
and 
k cp -, 81, I= 1 * -+ 02, 
8, A 8, is inconsistent. 
It follows that 
k 8, .+ -, 8,, k- -, 8, 4 
$, whence k 
-+ $. 
Let us write dl = Bl(cl . . . c,) where cl, . . ., c, are all the c E C occur 
ring in el. Choose new variables y l ,  . . . y,,, and let 8 = Vyl. . . ynOl(y 
. . . y,). Then 0 is a sentence of L,,, 
which satisfies the desired conclusion 
COROLLARY. 
Let cp(x, . . . x,), $(xl . . . x,) be formulas of L,,,, 
sucl 
that k cp -+ $. Then there is a formula 8(x, . . . x,) of L,,, 
such tha 
k cp + 8, k 8 4 $, and every relation, function, or constant symbol whicl. 
occurs in 8 occurs in both cp and $. 
PROOF. Replace x l ,  . . ., x, by new constants el, . . ., en and apply tht 
interpolation theorem.4

In the Craig Interpolation Theorem we cannot always finc 
8 SO that:

THEOREM 
5 (BETH'S THEOREM 
FOR L,,,). 
(LOPEZ-ESCOBAR 
[1965]). Let 
P and Q be two new relation symbols with n places. Let q(P) be a sentence 
of the language (L u {P}),,,, 
and let q ( Q )  be formed by replacing each 
occurrence of P by Q. Suppose that 
(i) 
CP(P) 
A dQ) 
+ (P(x1 * * - xn) - Q(xl*

i.e. cp(P) defines P implicitly. Then there is a formula O(xl . . . x,,) of 
L,,, 
such that 
(ii) k cp(P) + (P(x, . . . x,,) - 
8(x1 . . . x,,)), 
i.e. q(P) defines Pexplicitly. 
PROOF. From (i) we have 
I= ~P(P)AP(xI 
* * xn) + (q(Q) 
+ Q(x1 -

By the above corollary there is a formula O(x, . . . x,,) of L,,, 
such that 
(1) t cp(P>AP(X,. . . x,,) -, qxl . . . x,,),

From the second line (2) it follows that, by replacing Q by P, 
Then by (1) and (3) we conclude that (ii) ho1ds.i 
In first-order logic L it is easy to see, using the compactness theorem, 
that Craig's Interpolation Theorem is equivalent to A. Robinson's 
Consistency Theorem (which was proved at about the same time, per- 
haps a bit earlier): 
ROBINSON 
CONSISTENCY 
THEOREM. 
Let L', L" be two expansions of the 
language L such that L' n L" = L (i.e. every symbol common to L' and 
L" belongs to L). Let T be a complete theory in L and let cp be a sentence 
of L' and $ a sentence of L". If T u {cp} is consistent and T u {$} is 
consistent, then T u {cp, $} is consistent. 

22 
CRAIG INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
This theorem fails for the logic L,,,; 
its proof does not go throu; 
because the compactness theorem is no longer available. The followi 
set of exercises explains the situation in more detail. A set T of sentenc 
of L,,, is said to be a complete theory iff T has a model and for any t\

Lyndon Interpolation Theorem 
It is easy to show by induction that in a formula cp of L,,,, 
each o( 
currence of a symbol is within the scope of a finite number of negatio 
signs. An occurrence of a symbol is said to be positive iff it is within th 
scope of an even number of negation signs. Otherwise an occurrence : 
called negative. Thus a symbol can occur positively, negatively, or both i 
a formula. 
THEOREM 
6 (LYNDON INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
FOR Lo,,). 
(LOPEZ 
ESCOBAR 
[1965]). 
Suppose cp, $ are sentences of L,,, 
with k cp .+ $. Then there is a ser 
tence 8 of L,,, 
such that: 
(i) 1 cp .+ 8, 1 8 .+ $; 
(ii) Any relation symbol occurring positively (negatively) in 0 occui 
positively (negatively) in both cp and $. 
EXAMPLE. The example k 3x(c = X A  
R(x)) + 7 R(c) shows thz 
the theorem is false if we also require that every constant and functio 
symbol which occurs positively (negatively) in f3 occurs positively ("el

PROOF 
OF THEOREM

let X, be the set c 
all sentences 8 of M,,, 
such that only finitely many c E C occur in 8, an 
each relation symbol which occurs positively (negatively) in 0 also OCCUI 
positively (negatively) in c. In the argument below we shall consider th

sets x,, x,, &,, xTq.

LYNDON INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
25 
Let S be the set of all finite sets s c X, u XIIL which can be written 
as a union s = s, u s2 such that: 
(1) s1 = x,, 
s.2 = x1,; 
( 2 ) I f e , ~ X ,  n X , ,  e2EX1, nXls, a n d k A s , - , 8 , , k A ~ , - , f ? ~ ,  
then 8, A 8, is consistent. 
We claim that S is a consistency property. The proof is similar to that 
of the Craig Interpolation Theorem. The only steps which require spe- 
cial explanation are the consistency rule (Cl) and the equality rule (C7). 
These are the steps where it is essential that all equations of M,,, 
belong 
To prove the consistency rule (Cl), let s = s1 u s2 E S and suppose 
(Cl) fails, both a and la belong to s. If a E s1 and 
E s2 , then (2) 
is contradicted by 8, = a, 8, = la. If, (-,u) E s,, then (2) fails when 
8, is -,c = c, O2 is c = c. The other two cases are similar, and we have 
a contradiction. Therefore (Cl) holds. 
As an indication of the proof of (C7), assume that s = s1 u s, E S 
and let t be a basic term, c E C, and (c = t), a(t) E s. We shall show that 
s u { ~ ( c ) }  
E S. Suppose first that (c = t), a(t) E sl. Then k As, -+ O(C) 
and a(.) 
E X, , whence it follows that s u {a(c)> E S with s; = s1 u {a(c)> 
s; = s2. Next suppose that a(t) E s, , c = t E s,. Then

x,, x,,. and xl$. 
k A s1 -+ (c = t -+ a(.)),

b A s, -, (c = t -, el), k A s, -+ (C = r A 8,). 
(c = t -, el)/+ = t A 8 , )  
Then 
Hence 
is consistent, whence 8, A 8, is consistent. Therefore again s' E S. The 
other cases are similar. 

26 
LYNDON INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
The proof of (C2)-(C6) depends on the fact that if a relation symb 
occurs positively (negatively) in t~ and if u E Z, then the symbol also occu 
positively (negatively) in 7 
CT 1, 
A Z, 
Vxt~, VZ, and 3xcr. 
By the Model Existence Theorem, each s E S has a model, and ther 
fore {cp,

and O2(c, . . . c,,) in X-,, n 
such that 
cp -, el, 
$ .+ e2, 
(el~e2). 
e = vx, . . . x,e(x, . . . x,,) 
Then the sentence 
of L,,, 
has the required properties (i)-(ii).i 
we shall need later. 
THEOREM 
6A (LYNDON INTERPOLATION THEOREM

Assume that L has no function or constant symbols. Suppose cp, $ ai 
sentences of L,,, 
in which the equality symbol = does not occur, ar 
C cp -, $, not C 1 
cp, not k $. 
Then there is a sentence 8 of L,,, 
in which = does not occur which hi 
the properties (i) and (ii) of Theorem 6. 
PROOF. We follow the notation in the proof of Theorem 6. Define 1 
to be the set of all sentences 8 E X, in which the equality symbol does nc 
occur. Let S be the set of all finite sets s c Y, u Y7# which can be writte 
in the form s = s1 u s2 such that (1) and (2) hold with Y in place of 
and s1 and s2 are both consistent (so (Cl) will go through). Then arguir 
as before we see that S has all the properties (Cl)-(C6) of a consistenc 
property except the equality rule. Moreover, no member of S contaiI 
the equality symbol. By the Model Existence Theorem without equalil 
(Problem 4 in the last lecture), every s E S has a model. Therefore, sin( 
{cp, 1 
I)} has no model, {cp, 
$} 4 S. Furthermore. by hypothesis 
is consistent and (l 
$) is consistent. Then as before we see that there 
a sentence 8 of Lala in which = does not occur with the required prope 
ties (i) and (ii).i 
The above theorem also has a version for logic without identity whic

LYNDON INTERPOLATION THEOREM

The next result is one of a class of theorems known as 'preservation 
theorems'. Like Theorem 6 above, it is due to Lyndon for L and to Lopez- 
Escobar for L,,,. 
We say that a sentence cp of L,,, 
is positive iff every 
occurrence of a relation, constant, or function symbol, or the = symbol, 
in cp is positive. It is easily seen, by 'moving the negations inside', that 
cp is positive if and only if cp is logically equivalent to a sentence which is 
built up from atomic formulas using only V, 3, A, and V. 
A sentence cp of L,,, 
is said to be preserved under homomorphisms re- 
lative to a iff whenever %, % are models of a, % is a model of cp, and % is 
a homomorphic image of %, then % is a model of cp.

Then cp is preserved under homomorphisms relative to a if and only if 
there is a positive sentence 6 of L,,, such that b a + (cp c+ 0). 
PROOF. We see easily by induction that every positive sentence is preserv- 
ed under homomorphisms; whence if Co + (cp t, e) for some positive 
sentence 8, then cp is preserved under homomorphisms with respect to u. 
Assume cp is preserved under homomorphisms with respect to a. We 
may assume without loss of generality that cp, Q contain no function 
or constant symbols. For any n-placed function symbol can be replaced 
by an (n+ 1)-placed relation symbol, and any constant symbol by a 
l-placed relation symbol, and then a can be replaced by a A 6 where 6 
is the appropriate sentence saying that the relations are functions (or 
constants). 
Let E be a new binary relation symbol, and let C be the sentence stating 
that E is an equivalence relation and is a congruence relation with respect 
to each relation symbol in a, cp. Form cp(E), a(E) by replacing each OC- 
curence of = by E. Now add a new binary relation symbol E', and for 
each n-placed relation symbol R of L, a new n-placed relation symbol 
R'. Form C', cp'(E'), a'(E') by replacing E by E' and each relation symbol 
R by R'. Finally, let H be the conjunction of all sentences 
Vxl . . . x,,(R(x, . . . x,,) -+ R'(x,. . . x,)), 
~x,x,(E(x,xz) -+ E'(x1 xz)), 
for each relation symbol R. Then since cp is preserved under homomor- 
phisms relative to a,

The = symbol does not occur in the above sentence. Moreover, the syrr 
bols E’, R‘ do not occur on the left, and the symbols E, R occur only pc 
sitively on the right. Therefore, by Theorem 6 ~ ,  
there is a positive ser 
tence B(E), involving only E and relation symbols of L, such that 
c CA ~ J ( E )  A c p ( ~ )  -+ e(q, c e(E) .+ ( H A  C’ A ~ J ’ ( E ’ )  .+ cp’(~’)).

We shall next prove another special interpolation theorem and apply I 
to obtain another preservation theorem for L,,, . 
A sentence of L,,, 
is said to be quantijier-free iff it contains no quar 
tifiers. A formula cp is universal iff every occurrence of the quantifie 
V in cp is positive, and every occurrence of the quantifier 3 in cp is negativr 
A formula cp is existential iff ( 
cp) is universal. It is easy to show b 
a simultaneous induction that a formula cp of L,,, 
is universal (existential 
if and only if it is logically equivalent to a formula built up from atomi 
formulas and their negations using only V, A, V(3, A, V), and wit 
the same free variables.

Malitz Interpolation Theorem 
THEOREM 
8. (MALITZ [1969]). Suppose L has no function symbols. Let 
cp, $ be sentences of L,,, 
such that $ is universal and C cp + $. Then 
there is a universal sentence 8 of L,,, 
such that k cp -, 8, k 8 + $, and 
every relation or constant symbol occurring in 8 occurs in both cp and $. 
PROOF. 
We may assume without loss of generality that $ is quantifier- 
free, for the bound variables in $ can be replaced by new constants. Let 
S be the set of all finite sets s of sentences of M,,, 
such that only finitely 
many of the constants c E C occur in s, and s can be written as a union 
s = s, u s, where s, is quantifier-free, s, and s, have models, and:

which occurs in 8 occurs in both s1 and s,. 
We claim that S is a inconsistent property. 
Let us check parts (C4) and (C7), and leave the rest to the student. 
(C4) Let Vxa(x) E s E S. We must show that for all c E C, {~(c)} u s E S. 
Let c E C and writes = s1 u s2 satisfying (*). Since s, is quantifier-free,

CASE 11. a(t) E s1 , d = t E s2, d occurs in sl. Then s1 u {d = t} a1

The above paragraph is the place where we would have difficulty 
L had function symbols, because some of the symbols in t might then o

DEPINITION. 
Let cr, cp be sentences of Lm1,. cp is said to bepreserved under 
submodels relative to cr iff whenever %, 23 are models of u, 58 is a sub- 
model of %, and % is a model of cp, then 23 is a model of cp. 
THEOREM 
9 (MALITZ [1969]). Let cp, u be sentences of L,,,. Thencp is 
preserved under submodels relative to D if and only if there is a universal 
sentence 8 of L,,, such that != u -+ (cp ++ 8). 
PROOF. 
We may assume that L has no function or constant symbols. 
For we may replace functions and constants by relations in the usual way 
and add to cr a sentence stating that those relations are functions or con- 
stants. Let C be a countable list of new constant symbols. By induction 
we define for each formula $ of L,,, a formula $ " o f M,,, 
as follows: 
(A Y)" = A {$": $ E  !PI. 
(VX$(X.. .))" = A $"(c.. .). 
Thus $" is quantifier-free. Since cp is preserved under submodels relative 
to u, we have 
If + is atomic, +" = $.

By Theorem 8 there is a universal sentence 8 of L,,, such that

Since 8 A 
(u + cp) has no countable 
model, since any countable model can be enumerated by C and thus 
made into a model of 
(u" 3 cp"). 
From the Model Existence Theorem 
it follows that 8 A 
(cr -+ cp) has no model at all, whence I= 8 + (u -+ cp). 
Therefore I= u * (cp t, 8).i

Let u, cp be sentences of L,,,. Then cp is preserved under

MALITZ INTERPOLATION THEOREM 
" 
Theorem 9 was first proved for first order logic L by LoS and Tarsk 
using methods quite different than the above proof. The corollary wai 
proved later by Henkin, and more generally by A. Robinson, for firs 
order logic. Several other known preservation theorems for L were gen 
eralized to L,,, 
by Makkai using the methods of the last two lectures. 
PROBLEMS 
1. (BARWISE, 
MALITZ). Suppose L has no function or constant symbols 
Let cp, + be sentences of L,,, 
such that 4p is universal and k cp 3 $ 
Prove that there is a universal sentence 8 of L,,, 
such that k cp + 8 
k 8 3 t+b, and every relation symbol which occurs in 8 occurs in both 4 
and +. 
NOTE: To see why we assumed L has no function or constant symbols, 
consider the counterexample 
k R(c) + (3x)R(x). 
2. Let @ be a finite or countable set of sentences of L,,,, 
such that @

for each rp E @ such 
that: 
(i) {O,:

(iii) For each cp E Qi, each relation, function, or constant symbol which 
occurs in 8, occurs in cp and in some member of Qi- (9). 
3. (MAKKAI). 
Problem 2 above holds with (iii) replaced by: 
(iv) For each 4p E @, each relation symbol occurring positively (negati- 
vely) in 8, occurs positively (negatively) in cp and negatively (positively) 
in some member of @ - {cp}. 
4. (BARWISE,

Let 8 and 8 be countable models 
for L. Then

universal sentence of L,,, 
which holds in 23 holds in 8. 
5. (CHANG, MAKKAI). Let 8, '23 be countable models for L. Then '23 
is a homomorphic image of 8 if and only if every positive sentence of

Admissible sets 
In this lecture we shall introduce the notion of an admissible set, 
which is due to PLATEK 
[1966]. 
DEFINITION. 
By a formula of set theory we shall mean a formula in the 
first order logic with identity and the binary relation symbol E. If cp is a 
formula of set theory, we use the abbreviations 
(Vx E Y)cp for (Vx)(x E Y + cp), 
(3x E y)cp for (3x)(x E y A q). 
A A,-formula is a formula of set theory which is built up from atomic 
formulas and their negations using only the operations 
A, v, (Vx E Y), (3x E Y). 
Here we mean finite A and V. 
A Z-formula is a formula of set theory built up from atomic formulas 
and their negations using the above four operations and (3x). A n-for- 
mulu is one built in the same way but with (Vx) instead of (3x). 
For example, (Vx E y)(3z E w)(x E z A 7 z = u) is a A,-formula, 
while (Vx E y)(3z)(x E Z A  1 
z = u) is a Z-formula which is not A,. 
LEMMA 
1. (i) The negation of a A,-formula is logically equivalent to 
a A,-formula. The negation of a Z-formula is logically equivalent to 
a l7-formula. The negation of a l7-formula is logically equivalent to a 
Z-formula.

(ii) Let a, b be transitive sets with a c b, and let c l , .  . ., C , E U .  If 
q(xl . . . x,) is a do-formula, then 
(a, E) t= q[cl . . . c,] o 
(b, E) t= q[cl . . . c,]. 
If q(x, . . . x,) is a X-formula, then 
(a, E) t= P [ C ~  - . c,] * (b, E) 1 P [ C ~  
- - * c.1. 
If q(x, . . . x,) is a I?-formula, then 
(b, E) t= q [ c ,  . . . c,] 3 (a, E) C q[cl . . . c,]. 
The proof of this lemma is left to the student. 
DEFINITION. d is said to be an admissible set iff: 
(i) d is non-empty. 
(ii) d is transitive. 
(iii) If x E d, 
then the transitive closure TC(x) of x belongs to d. 
(iv) ( A o - S ~ ~ n 0 ~

then there is a transitive set a E &'such 
that 
b l ,  . . ., b, E a and (a, E) C q[b, . . . b,]. 
DEFINITION. 
A set X t d is said to be X on d iff there is a C-formula 
q(xy, . . . y.) and elements b,, . . ., b, E d such that 
X = {a E d: (d, 
E) C q[ab1 . . . b,,]}. 
That is, X is defined by a 2-formula with parameters in d. 
We shall 
call cp(xbl . . . b,) a 2.-definition of X. 
The notion of a set X c d being I? on d, and of a lI-dejinition of 
X, are defined analogously. 
A set X c d i s  said to be A on d i f f  it is both2 on d and If on d. 

36 
ADMISSIBLE SETS 
[8 
NOTE: 
cp(xb, . . . b,) stands for the pair cp(xy, . . . y,), ( b ,  . . . b,). Before 
proceeding further, we give some examples of admissible sets. 
EXAMPLE 
1. The set d' = R(w) of all sets of finite rank is admissible. 
Indeed, (d, 
E) satisfies all the axioms of ZF except the axiom of in- 
finity. The corresponding language L,, is just the classical first-order 
logic L. 
For any X c R(w), 
X E  R(o) iff X is finite, 
Xis A on R(w) iff X is recursive, 
X is C on R(w) iff X is recursively enumerable. 
In general, one may think of the property of belonging to d as a gener- 
alization of the property of being finite, and A on d, C on d as genera- 
lizations of the properties of recursiveness and recursive enumerability. 
The set R(w) is the smallest admissible set. As we see in the exercises, 
any other admissible set contains w as an element. 
EXAMPLE 
2. The next smallest admissible set is the set L(a) of all sets 
constructible before the first non-recursive ordinal u. 
EXAMPLE 
3. If d 
is a transitive set and (d, 
E) is a model of all the axioms 
of ZF except possibly the power set axiom, then d is an admissible set. 
In particular, let u be any regular cardinal. Then the set L(u) of all 
sets constructible before a is admissible. 
The set ff, is defined as the set of all sets x such that TC(x) has power 
< a. For each regular cardinal a, H, is an admissible set. 
When a = w, the sets L(o) and H, are the same as the set R(w). The 
elements of R(w) are sometimes called hereditarily jinite, whence R(w) 
is denoted by HF. 
When u = wl, 
the elements of H,, are called hereditarily countable 
and H,, is denoted by HC. 
We remark that KRIPKE [1964] and PLATEK [1966] have introduced 
the notion of a recursively regular, or admissible ordinal. They showed 
that an ordinal a is recursively regular if and only if L(u) is an admissible 
set. 
Suppose cp(xl . . . x,) is a formula of set theory and y is a variable which 
does not occur in cp. Then the relativization of the formula cp to y ,  denoted 

81 
ADMISSIBLE SETS 
37 
by cpY(xl, . . ., x,), is defined to be the formula obtained from cp by replac- 
ing each quantifier (Vz), (32) in cp by the bounded quantifier (Vz E y), 
(3z E y). Thus for any formula rp of set theory, rpy is a A,-formula, which 
has all the free variables of rp and the additional free variabley. For rel- 
ativized formulas we shall sometimes use the notation 
Notice that if a E d and b,, . . ., b, E a, then 
For example, the Z-reflection axiom may be expressed in the following 
form: 
If 'p(yl . . . y,) is a Z-formula, then 
( d , ~ )  
kq(y, ...yn)+( h)[xistransitive A ~ , E X A  ... A ~ , , E X A

If G is a function, G c d x d ,  
G is Z on d, a E d, and a c domain(G), then Gla E d. 
(iv) (DEFINITION

Let G(,) be a function such that for 
all a, b E d, G(a, b) E d, 
and G l d  is Z on d. Suppose F is a function 
with domain d which is defined recursively by 
F(x) = G(x, FITC(x)), all x E d. 
Then F is A on d and F maps d into d. 
Parts (i), (ii), and (iv) are due to Platek, and part (iii) to Barwise. 
PROOF. (i) Let a, b E d. By Z-reflection there is a c E d such that a, 
bEc. By A,-separation, {a, b} ~ d .  
It follows that (a, b )  = {{a}, 
{a, b}} E d. We show that a x  b E d. By the above remarks,

ADMISSIBLE SETS

(d, 
E) i= (Vx E a)(Vy E b)(3z)(z = (x, y)). This is a C-formula, so by 
Z-reflection there exists c E d such that a, b E c and 
<c, E) k (VX E ~ ) ( V Y  
E b)(jz)(z = <x, Y)). 
Then a x  b c c. 
But 
a x b = (U E c : (3x E a)@ E b)(u = (x, JJ)]). 
Thus by A,,-separation, a x b E d. The other parts of (i) are similar or 
easier. 
(ii) Let cp(xb, . . . b,,) and Il/(xb, . . . b,,) be a C and n-definition of X. For 
all x E X, 
<d, 
E) 
~ ( ~ 6 1

whence by Z-reff ecfion, x E X implies 
(d, 
E) I= (3y)(x, b, . . ., b, E y A y is transitive A cpY(xb, . . . b,)). 
Similarly, x $ X implies 
(d, 
E) C ( l y ) ( x ,  b, , . . ., b, E y A y is transitive A 
$Y(xb, . . . b,,)). 
Then, since X c a, 
(d, 
E) I. (Vx E a)[(3y)(x, b, , . , ., b,, E y A y transitive A cp'(x, bl . . . b,,)) 
v (3y)(x, b, , . . .,b, E y A y transitive A 1 
+'(xbl . . . b,))]. 
Abbreviate the above as (d, 
E) k (Vx E a)(@ v $). Since the formula 
(Vx E a)(? v $) is Z, there exists d E d such that a, b, , . . ., b, E d, d is 
transitive, and (d, E) C (Vx E a)(p v 3). We claim that 
X E X  iff < ~ , E ) ~ X E U A @ ' .  
Because if (d, 
E) C x E a A pd, then since ? is I;, (d, 
E) k x E a h  p, 
whence (d, 
E) != cp(xb, . . . b,) and x E X. Conversely, if not (d, 
E) C 
x E a h  Fd, then either: x $ a, whence x $ X; or else (d, 
e )  1

in which case (A?, E) != tJd. 
But 3 is also Z, so (d, 
E) I= @, and hence 
(d, 
E) C i 
$(xb, . . . b,), SO x $ X. 
(iii) We first remark that, by (i), every relation R c d

 is also a 
subset of d. Moreover, it is easy to show using ordered pairs that R

b, E d such that R = {{a, b): (d, 
E) k p[abb, . . . bJ]. We may call 
cp(xyb, . . . b,) a Z-definition of R. 
Now let cp(xybl . . . b,) be a Z-definition of G. Then Gla has the Z-defi- 
nition 
X E U A (P(Xyb1 . . . b,), 
so Gln is Z on d. We have, since a c domain(G), 
<d, 
E) C (Vx E a)(3y)cp(xybl 
* 
bn). 
By C-reflection there exists c E 
b, E c, and 
such that c is transitive, a, b,, . . ., 
(c, 4 
t= (Vx E 4(3Y)cp(VbI 
* * b"). 
Therefore Gla c ax c. By (i), a x c E d. 
Finally, Gla has the l7-definition 
X E U A ( V Z  E C)(p(XZbl . . . b,) + Z = y). 
Thus Gla is A on d. By A-separation, Gla E d. 
(iv) We first observe that the relation u E TC(x) has the Z-definition: 
x # U A  (3u)[x E U A  (Vy E u)(y # u + (3z)(z E y n u)]. 
Hence the relation w = TC(x) has the Z-definition 
x c w A (w is transitive) A (Vu E w) u E TC(x). 
Now let cp(xyzb, . . . b,) be a Z-definition of the binary function G l d .  
Let F' be the subset of d which has the Z-definition $(xzb, . . . b,): 
(3w)(3f)[w = TC(x) Afis a function A domain(f) = w A cp(xfzb, . . . b,) 
A (Vr E w ) ( ~ s ) ( s  = TC(r) A q(rflsf(r)b, . . . b,)]. 
The terms domain(f), fls, f ( r )  can be eliminated by introducing appro- 
priate bounded quantifiers. We show by induction that for all ordinals 
ct and all a E d n R(a), F'la = Flu and F'la E d. 
This assertion is trivial 
for o! = 0 and passes through limit ordinals automatically. Assuming it 
for ct, we prove it for a+ 1. Let a E R(a+ 1) n d, 
x E a. Let w = TC(x). 
Then w E d n R(ct). By hypothesis, P[w = F'lw E d. 
Letf = Flw. Then 
F(x) = G(x,f) E d. It then is clear from an examination of the formula 
$ with this choice of w,fthat the pair (x, F(x)) belongs to the relation

ADMISSIBLE SETS 
[8 
F(x) = 
F'. Moreover, w, f are the only sets which satisfy the part of $ within the 
square brackets, so there is no pair <x, z) E F' with z # F(x). Therefore 
F'la = Fla. The set F'la has the Z-definition II/ A X  E a. Since F is a total 
function and F'la = F(a, we have a c dornain(F'1a). Then by the Z- 
replacement principle proved above, Flu E d. 
This completes the induc- 
tion. Hence F maps d into d. 
We conclude that $(xzb,. . . b,) is a C-definition of F. On the other

Barwise Compactness Theorem 
The next theorem is a generalization of the classical fact that the set 
of all valid formulas of L is recursively enumerable. 
THEOREM 
10. (BARWISE 
[1969]). Let sit’ c HC be an admissible set. Then 
the set of all valid sentences rp E LB is ,Z on d. 
PROOF. We recall that M is just the language L with the countable 
set C of extra constant symbols, and thus the preceding lemma holds for 
MB as well as LB. Let F,cp 
mean that rp E MB and there exist x E d, 
u E sit’ such that rp E P(a, x), where P is the function on d x d into d 
defined recursively as follows. Intuitively, rp E P(a, x )  means that cp has 
a proof in Md of ‘height’ gu such that each step of the proof belongs to 
x. More formally, 
P(a, x )  = 0 if a E d - o r d ,  
and for a E ord n d, 
P(a, x )  is the set of all rp E x n MB such that either

BARWISE COMPACTNESS THEOREM 
43 
Notice that (2), (3), and (4) correspond to the rules of modus ponens, 
generalization, and conjunction, respectively. We may regard P as a to- 
tally defined function with domain d by making P(y) = 0 when y is not 
an ordered pair. 
We shall first check that the function P maps d into d and is A on d. 
We observe that P is defined recursively from a function G whose do- 
main includes a? x d. Furthermore, for each u, x and f in d, we have 
(5) G(<a,x),f) = x 
and in view of Lemma 3, 
(6) The relation ‘y E G((u, x),f)’ is A on d. 
Then by the A-separation principle, we have 
(7) G ( ( 4  x>, f) E d. 
Using (6) we see that 
( 8 )  G I d x  d is Z on d. 
We now conclude by the principle of definition by Z-recursion, using 
(7) and (8), that P maps d into d and is A on d. 
In what follows we shall write ‘cp E P(a, x)’ to denote the Z-definition 
of P. We observe that P(a, x )  is increasing in ct and x, that is, if a E /l E d, 
x c y E d, and u, B are ordinals, then 
Let S be the set of all finite sets s c M, of sentences such that not I-, 1 
As, and only finitely many c E C occur in s. We claim that 
(9) S is a consistency property. 
Let us first assume (9) and give the rest of the proof of the theorem. 
Since P is Z on d, kdcp has the X-definition 
(3x)(3ct)’cp E P(u, xy. 
Thus the set of all sentences cp E L, such that Fd’p is Z on d. Since all 
axioms are valid and the rules of inference preserve validity, we have 
If cp E L, and I-,cp, 
then I= cp. 

44 
BARWISE COMPACTNESS THEOREM 
[9 
On the other hand, suppose cp E L, and cp is valid. Let cp be a sentence. 
We now apply, once again, the Model Existence Theorem; it says that 
every s E S has a model, hence { 
A(? 
cp), when- 
ce tdq. Thus 
9) 6 S. Then t, 
if cp E Ld and b cp, then tdcp. 
This proves that the set of all valid sentences cp E L, is ,Z on d. 
The only step in the proof of (9) which presents any difficulty is the 
verification of’: 
(C 5). If V 0 E S E  S then for some 0 ~ 0 ,  
s u { O }  E S. Assume V 0 E 
s E S but for all 8 E 0, s u {e} 6 S. We shall get a contradiction. We have 
k, 
A(s u {a)), whence kd(A s -+ - e), for all 8 E 0. Therefore 
(d, 
E) b (ve E @ ) ( 3 ~ ) ( 3 a ) r ( A  
s -, 4) 
E P(a, x)’]. 
The formula on the right is a C-formula, so by C-reflection there is a 
transitive a E d such that s E a, 0 E a, and 
<a, E) 1 (ve E 0 ) ( 3 4 ( 3 4 y ~

E) I= (ve E o p

s --f 
(d, 
E) b (ve E o ) ( j X  E a y ( ~  
s -+ 
e) E ~ ( a ,  
xi-. 
It follows that 
e) E ~ ( a ,  
x)*. 
Since a is transitive and P(a, x) is increasing in x, 
e) E P ( X ,  a)’. 
Let j3 be the least ordinal not in a, i.e. fi = ord n a. Then by A ,  separa- 
tion, fi E d, and hence 
(d, 
E) k (ve E O ) ( j a  E p)‘(A s -+ 
(d,

whence td(A s -, ABEe 0). But V 0

A s, contradicting s E S. This proves (C5). i 
In the above argument, the assumption that d c HC was needed 
so that L, would be included in Lala) and the Model Existence Theorem

would be available. If d is not a subset of HC, then some elements of 
d are uncountable, and L, 
will contain uncountable conjunctions. In 
these lectures we are only interested in the case d c HC. In the next 
theorem we must assume not only that d c HC but also that d itself 
is countable, i.e. d 
E HC. This is the principal theorem in logic on ad- 
missible sets. 
THEOREM 11. (BARWISE COMPACTNESS 
THEOREM). 
Let d c HC be a 
countable admissible set. Suppose X c L, 
is a set of sentences, X is Z 
on d, and every x c Xsuch that x E d has a model. Then Xhas a model. 
PROOF. Let S be the set of all s c M, such that s is a set of sentences 
of M,, 
s is 1 on d, every x c s such that x E d has a model, and only 
finitely many c E C occur in s. We claim that S is a consistency property. 
Again the only difficult case to verify is: 
(C5) If V O E S E  S then for some 8 E 0, s u {8} E S. 
Suppose V O E s E S but s u { O }  q2 S for all 8 E 0. 
Then for all 8 E O 
there is an x E d such that x c s and x u { O }  has no model. Therefore 
(d, 
E) c (ve E 0)(3x)[x c s A (3a)(3y)'(~ x -+ 
e) E P(N, y)']. 
Here x c s is written in terms of a Z-definition of s, and P(a, y )  is the 
function defined in the proof of Theorem 10. The formula on the right 
is thus a Z-formula. Thus there is a transitive a E d such that all the 
constants occurring in the above formula belong to a, and the above for- 
mula holds in (a, E). It follows that 
( d , ~ )  
~ ( ~ ~ E @ ) ( ~ x E u ) [ ( x  
c S ) ' A ( ~ X ) ( ~ ~ ) ' ( A X - +  l e ) ~ ~ ( a , y ) ' ] . ( l )  
Let 
b = { U E U : ( U , E ) ~ U E S } .  
Then b c c and b is defined by the A,,-formula 
U E a A (U E S>" 
in (d, 
E). Hence by A,-separation, b E d. 
Also, since s is 1 on d, 
we 
have b c s. Finally, if (d, 
E )  k x E U A  (x c sy, then x c b. It follows 
from (1) that for all 8 E 0 there is an x c b with t, A x + 7 
8, and 
thus 1 A x + 
8, and k A b + 1 8 .  Then C A b + ABEe 1 8 ,  and 
hence b u {V 0} has no model. But b u {V 0} E S(s) n d. 
This con- 

46 
BARWISE COMPACTNESS THEOREM 
[9 
tradiction completes the proof that S satisfies part (C5) of the definition 
of consistency property. 
The set X of sentences of Ld mentioned in the hypothesis of the theo- 
rem belongs to S. Since S is a consistency property, we may apply the 
Model Existence Theorem, and X has a model. i 
REMARKS. 
The proofs of Theorems 10 and 11 originally given by Barwise 
were proof-theoretic, using cut free derivations in L,. Later, Karp gave 
proofs of Theorems 10 and 11 using Boolean-valued models. The present 
proofs are more model-theoretic in character than the earlier proofs. Our 
proofs depend primarily on the Model Existence Theorem rather than 
on a notion of derivation in L,. The above proof of the Barwise Com- 
pactness Theorem is given in MAKKAI [1969b]. 
Our notation F,cp 
can be interpreted as saying there is a proof tree for 
rp in d, but we use it only as a &definition of I= cp. Using the axiom of 
choice, one can show directly that P,cp 
implies kLdcp, that is, if rp has a 
proof tree in d then it has a well ordered proof using formulas of Ld. 
The language Ld and the Barwise Compactness Theorem grew out of 
ideas of KREISEL 
[1965]. It contains a compactness theorem for o-logic 
which follows from the Barwise theorem. 
The Barwise Compactness Theorem has a number of applications to 
recursion theory and set theory. See, for example, FRIEDMAN 
and JENSEN 
[1967] and BARWISE 
[1970]. We shall give just one simple illustration here. 
COROLLARY. 
Let d be a countable admissible set and let T c L, be 
a set of sentences such that Tis ,Z on d and every cp E Tis true in (d, 
E). 
Then T has a model (B, F )  such that

E) # (B, F). 
(iii) If a E d, 
b E B, and bFa, then b E d.

PROOF. Add to L a constant c, for each a E A? and one additional 
constant c. Let T' be the set of sentences Tplus the following: 
c # c,, each a ~ d .  
vx(x E c, -, V x = cb), each a E d.

Then T' is Z on d. Every Th c T' such that Ti E d has a model; be- 
cause the set X of all a E d for which c, occurs in TA belongs to d, and 
therefore we can obtain a model for Th by interpreting c by any element 
b E d - X .  Then by the Barwise Compactness Theorem, T has a model 
(B, F). We may interpret each constant c, by a. Then (B, F )  has the 
properties (i)-(iii). -i

Undefinability of well order 
In this lecture we shall give an example of combining the following two 
techniques: 
(a) The Model Existence Theorem. 
(b) Adding new relation, function, or constant symbols to L. 
THEOREM 
12 (i) (MORLEY [ 1965a1, LOPEZ-ESCOBAR 
[ 19661). 
Let T be a countable set of sentences of L,,,, 
and let U, < be a unary 
and binary relation symbol of L. Suppose that for all u < w l ,  T has a 
model 8 = ( A ,  U, <, . . .) such that < linearly orders U and (a, <) 
c ( U ,  <). Then T has a model % = (B, V, <, . . .) such that < lin- 
early orders B and (V, <) contains a copy of the rational numbers. 
(ii) (MORLEY [1967], BARWISE [1969]). Let &’ c HC be a countable 
admissible set and let T be a set of sentences of L, which is C on d. Sup- 
pose that for all CL E Ord n &‘, T has a model <A, U, <, . . .) such that 
< linearly orders U and (u, <) c ( U ,  <). Then T has a model 
% = (B, V, < , . . .) such that < linearly orders B and ( V, < ) contains 
a copy of the rationals. 
PROOF. The proof we give differs from the original proofs. We have 
simplified the argument by using the Model Existence Theorem. It is 
obvious that (ii) implies (i), but we shall first give the proof of (i) because 
it is easier. 
(i) We add to L a set D = {d,.: r rational) of constants. Call the new 
language L’. Form M‘ be adding a countable set C of new constants to 
L’, and let M; 
be a countable fragment of ML,, such that T c M i .

Let K be the class of all models(A, U, <, . . .> of L such that the se 
Ord n U = U' is a countable ordinal and < is the usual ordering on U' 
Let S be the set of all sets s = so u T u {d, < d,: q < r as rationals: 
such that so is a finite set of sentences of M;, 
only finitely many c E C 
d E D occur in so, say 
so = so(cl . . . c,d,, . . . d,,), rl < . . . < r,,

We claim that S is a consistency property. The only parts of the verifica,

(C5). Let VO E s E S. Then for each a < w1 , there is a 9, E O suck 
that 
(a, b, . . . b,) k (3x, . . . x,) 
A so A 9,(xl . . . x, d,, . . . d,,,), 
in the definition of S. Since O is countable, there is a 9 E O such tha 
9 = 9, for arbitrarily large a < 0,. 
It follows that s u {O,} E S. 
(C7). The interesting case is the following: If d, E D, then for all s E 2 
there is c E C such that s u {d, = c} E S. 
Let c be a constant in C not occurring in so. Let rl < . . . < rp < I 
< rP+, < . . . < r,. Then to show that s u {d, = c} E S we need onlj 
observe that if p 2 u+u, and /I b,, b,+p S b,, . . ., b,-,+B 6 b, 
then setting b = bp+a we have 
a 5 b,,. . ., bp+u 5 by b 5 b+u,. . ., b,-,+u 5 b,. 
It follows from the hypotheses that 
T u  {d, < d,: q < r} 
belongs to S. Then by the Model Existence Theorem the above set has 5 
model. It follows that T has a model '23 such that ( V, <) contains a copj 
of the rationals.

For each ordinal u E Ord n d, let rsa

U is linearly ordered by 5.

Observe that if u < p then r,, c rsa. 
Let K,, be the C.JSS of all models 
(8, b, . . . b,) such that % E K, b,, . . ., b, E U', and

Consider any sentence B(c, . . . c,d,, . . . d,,) of M;. 
Recalling the

8 k T, (8,

We also note that a model (23, bi . . . b:) is isomorphic to a model in 
the class K,, if and only if it can be expanded to a model of r,. (The con- 
stants cog, ep, correspond to the ordinals p, b,+p). It follows that

Let Q(u, 0) mean that a is an ordinal, O(cl . . . c,dr, . . . drJ is a sentence

This contradicts (2). Hence s u { O }  E S for some 8 E 0, and (C5) holds. 
We conclude that S is a consistency property. It follows from the Mod-

T u  (d, -= d,: q < r} E S, 
T has a model B where (V, <) contains a copy of the rationa1s.i

PROOF. By Scott’s theorem there is a cp such that for all countable 23, 
23 k cp if and only if 23 z ?I. 
If rp has an uncountable model, then by Co-

( v X ) ( v U ,  2, E u ) ( U  < V A R(u, X )  + R(V, X ) ) ;  
(VU, 
2, E U)(U < V + ( j X ) ( R ( V ,  X )  A i 
R(U, X ) ) ;  
(Vx)(3u E U)R(u, x). 
Then by Theorem 12, T* has a model 
where V contains a copy of the rationals. The models BV are the required 
chain of models of T. -I

Omitting Types Theorem 
In this lecture we shall give an example of the technique of prov 
a theorem for a countable fragment L, by applying the Model Existei 
Theorem to a set of sentences in a larger countable fragment La. 
This technique of enlarging the set ..d has no analog in first order 101 
and using it we can obtain new results for first order logic L by using 
methods for Ld. For L the following resuIt is essentially due to Hen 
and Orey. 
THEOREM 
13 (OMITTING TYPES THEOREM). 
Let L, be a countable fragment of L,,, , let T c L, be a set of senteni 
and for each n < o let @,(x, . . . x,,,) be a set of formulas of L, wit1 
most the free variables xl, . . ., xp,. Suppose that 
(i) T has a model; 
and 
(ii) For all n < o and all formulas $(xl . . . x,,) in Ld, if T u {(3x1 
xpn)$} has a model, then there exists 'p E @" such that T u {(3x, 
x,,)$ A 'p} has a model. 
PROOF. 
Let Md be the set of all formulas obtained from form] 
in L, 
by replacing all occurrences of finitely many free variables 
constants c E C (as before). Let S be the set of all s of the form 
s = s ~ u T u { V @ ~ ( C ~  
... cPn):n <a, C ~ E C ) ,  
54

OMITTING TYPES TWEOREM

where so is a finite set of sentences of M,, only finitely many c E C occur 
in so, and S, u T has a model. 
We claim that S is a consistency property. The only nontrivial step is 
part (C5) of the definition. Let VO E s E S. 
CASE I. VO E so u T. Let 9( be a model of so u T. Then for some 0 E 0, 
9( k 8, whence s u {e} E S. 
CASE 11. VO = V@,,(c, . . . c,,) 
for some n < 0 and cl, . . . cpn E C. 
This means that 
0 = (Cp(Cl . . . c,,): ql E Qn}. 
Let dl, . . ., d, be all the constants in C - { c , ,  . . ., c,,} which occur in 
so; thus we may write 
so = S0(CI . . . CPndl . . . d,). 
Since s E S, the set 
T u  ((3x1 * * .  X p n ) ( 3 Y ,  . * . Y m )  A SO(XI * * * X p n Y l  - * * Y m ) }  
has a model, where the y's are new variables. Then by (ii), there is a 
~p E Qi, such that 
T u  ((3x1 * * xnp)(3Y1 . . ~ m )  
A sO(x1 * * - x p n Y l  * * . Y r n ) A d x 1  * 
* xpJ1 
has a model. 
It follows that 
s u (ql(C1 . * . c,,)} 
E s, 
l u  
so u { q l ( C l  . . . c,,)] 
because q(cl . . . cpn) E 0 and 
has a model. 
By (i), the set 
T u  {V@,(Cl 
. . . c,,): n < 0, ci E C }  
belongs to S. Then by the Model Existence Theorem and the remark 
following it, the set (i) has a model % in which every element is an inter- 
pretation of some c E C. Therefore % is a model of T, and also of 
A (VX, . . . X,") VQn. -I 
n < m

OMITTING TYPES THEOREM 
11 1 
The Omitting Types Theorem will be useful later on in these lectures. 
The name “omitting types” comes from the fact a model of a sentence of 
the form 
A (VX, . . . X,,) 
V@,,(X, 
* . . X,,) 
n < o  
may be thought of as a model which, for each n < w, omits the type of 
p,,-tuples of elements satisfying the set of formulas { 
q(x, . . . x,,): 
cp E @,,I. 
The following very elementary result points out the importance of 
sentences of the above special form. It shows that the study of countable 
fragments of L, 
can be reduced to the study of models which omit 
countably many types with respect to L, i.e. to models of sentences of the 
above special form with each @,, a set of sentences of L. 
THEOREM 
14. Let L, 
be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
Then there is 
a language L’ formed by adding countably many relation symbols to 
L and a sentence 
CP = A ( v ~ 1  
* * * x p , )  V qrnn(X1 * * * ~ p , , , )  
m<a) 
n < o  
such that each qmn is a formula of L‘ and: 
(i) Every model CtT for L has a unique expansion to a model for L‘ with 
(ii) For every formula $(yl . . . yr) E L, with finitely many free variables 
there is a formula $’(yl . . . yr) in L’ such that 
N‘ k cp. 
k cp + ($ - $7. 
(iii) For every formula B(yl . . . y,) of L’ there is a formula B1(yl . . . y,: 
E L, such that 
k cp -+ (e - el). 
PROOF. Form L’ by adding, for each formula $(yl . . . y,) E L,, an r. 
placed relation symbol RS(Y, . . , yr.). 
Let us abbreviate 
Y = Y 1 ~ * * * ~ Y r ,

The conclusions (i) - (iii) then follow easily. i 
The Omitting Types Theorem can be used to prove an important theo- 
rem in recursion theory. To state this theorem we need some definitions. 
DEFINITION. 
Let U c o. A set X c R(o) is said to be recursive in U 
iff X is A on the structure (R(o), E, U ) ;  that is, there are a C-formula 
~ ( x )  
and a n-formula .(x) in the language of (R(o), E, U) such that 
X = {a : (R(w), E, U )  k a[a]> 
and 
X = {a : (R(w), E, U )  1 .[a]}. 
An ordinal p is said to be recursive in U iff there exists a well ordering 
X of w of order type j? which is recursive in U. Finally, 
is defined 
to be the least ordinal which is not recursive in U. 
Recall from Lecture 8 that an ordinal a is said to be admissible iff the 
set L(a) of all sets constructible before stage a is admissible. 
We shall need two classical lemmas from recursion theory (see PLATEK 
[ 19661). 
LEMMA 
A. For any set U c o, 
the ordinal 
ordinal. 
LEMMA 
B. For any admissible ordinal ci, there exists a set S c ci which 
is C but not A on L(ct). 
is a countable admissible 

58 
OMITTING TYPES THEOREM 
The proof of Lemma B is just a generalization of Godel's diagonal 
construction of an r.e. set which is not recursive. We omit the proofs 
of Lemmas A and B. 
The following theorem was first proved by SACKS [I9701 using a forcing 
construction. Later FRIEDMAN 
and JENSEN 
[1968] found a much simpler 
proof using the Barwise Compactness Theorem. The proof below is sim- 
pler yet and is due to T. Grilliot and S. Simpson. 
THEOREM 
15. A countable ordinal a > w is admissible if and only if there 
is a set U c o such that a = my. 
PROOF. One direction is given by Lemma A. For the other direction, 
assume that ci > w and a is a countable admissible ordinal. Let L con- 
tain the e-symbol, a constant symbol cu, and a constant symbol cs for 
each ordinal /? < a. Let d be the admissible set d = L(a). Let S be a 
subset of a which is Z on d but not A on d. 
Let T be the following set of sentences of Ld: 
The 2-replacement scheme. 
All the axioms of Zermelo set theory. 
x E cs * V,,, 
x = c,, for each /? < a. 
X E C U  + X E C , .  
'cB is recursive in cu', for each p -= 01. 
For each j?, the last sentence is just the formalization in Zermelo set theory 
of the definition of '/? 
is recursive in U'. We observe that 
For example, let U c w be such that 
(1) T has a model. 
{(my n ) :  2" - 3" E U >  
is a well ordering of w of order type a. Then for some ordinal y > a, 
<R(Y)Y EY UY /?>a<. 
is a model of T. Moreover, it is obvious that 
(2) T is .Z on d. 
Now let O(x) be the set of formulas: 
Vy(y E x -+ y is an ordinal) 
C~ E x, for each p E S 
-I cs E x, for each /3 E a-S. 

111 
OMITTING TYPES THEOREM 
59 
We shall use the Omitting Types Theorem to show that 
T u { 
3xA0} has a model. 
Such a model is said to omit the set S. To do this, consider any formula 
$(x) in L, such that T u {3x$(x)} has a model. Let I' be the set of all 
formulas q ( x )  such that T k $(x) + cp(x). By Problem 6 in Lecture 9, 
r is C on d. Assume for the moment that 0 c r. Then, since r is con- 
sistent, the sets 
S = { p  < a: (cg E x )  E r}, 
a - S =  { f i < a : ( 7 c s ~ x ) ~ r }  
are both Z on d, whence S is A on d. But S is not A on d, so there is a 
formula f3 E 0 - r. Then 
T" @X)(11/(Xb 
1 
e(x>>> 
has a model. It follows from the Omitting Types Theorem that T has 
a model 8 in which V x  VoE8 9, which is equivalent to 1 
3x A@, 
holds. Then 8 is a model of T which omits S. 
Let U be the interpretation of cu in 8. Then from the axioms of T we 
see that U c w and wy 2 a. Assume that my > a. Then there is a C- 
formula cp(x) which defines a well-ordering Y o n  w of order type a in the 
model (R(o), E, U). But (R(w), E, U), and hence Y, are elements of Z. 
By using the principle of definition by C-recursion in 8, we see that Z 
must have an at* ordinal, which we may identify with a. Let ~ ( x )  
be a 
C-definition of S in d. Thus 
s = {fi < u: 8 k a'L'u"(cg)}. 
8 c (Vy)(y E s 4+ o'L(u"(y)). 
Using &separation in a, there is an s E such that 
Therefore 
'~?II=C~ES 
for BES, 
8 k  l c g E s  
for PEa-S, 
contradicting the fact that 2 omits S. We therefore conclude that 
wy = u. -I 

60 
OMITTING TYPES THEOREM 
11 1 
The following corollary, due to Friedman, improves Problem 8 in 
Lecture 9. 
COROLLARY 
c. Let a be a countable admissible ordinal and suppose 
there is a model M of ZF with a 2 osp(M), the ordinal standard part 
of M .  Then a is the ordinal standard part of some model N of ZF. 
PROOF. The result is trivial for a = w. Suppose that a > w. Let T‘ 
be the theory T in the proof of the preceding theorem plus the axioms 
of ZF. Suppose M C ZF and a -= osp(M). Then 
M k ‘a is admissible’. 
We may assume that M is countable. 
Using Cohen’s forcing construction, we may also assume that 
M k  ‘a is countable’. 
Then by Theorem 14 in M ,  
u 
kf k (3u)(u C WAC( = 01). 
It follows that if we interpret cu by U and cs by /? for each /? < GI, then 
M becomes a model of T‘. From the proof of Theorem 15 we see that 
T‘ has a model N which omits S, and its reduct N must be a model of 
ZF such that a = osp(N). -1

Prime models 
In this lecture we give some applications of the Omitting Types Theorem. 
The results are due to Vaught for L. 
DEFINITION. 
Let L, be a fragment of L,,,. 
By a complete theory Tin L, 
we mean a set T c L, of sentences which is maximal consistent. By the 
completeness theorem, T is a complete theory in L, iff there is a model 
(ZI for L such that T is the set of all sentences of L, holding in (ZI. 
A formula cp(x, . . . x,,) E L, 
(with finitely many free variables) is con- 
sistent with T if and only if T k (3x, . . . x,)cp, i.e. (3x, . . . x,)cp holds in 
all models of T. 
q(x1 . . . x,) is said to be compZete (in L,) 
with respect to Tiff cp E L,, 
cp is consistent with T, and for every formula $(xl . . . x,) E L,, 
either 
Tk cp -+ I) or TI. 
cp -+ 
7 I). 
cp(xl . . . x,) is said to be incompletable (in L,) 
with respect to Tiff 
cp E LA, cp is consistent with T, and there is no complete O(xl . . . x,) E L, 
such that T k 8 -+ cp. 
A set of formulas @(xl . . . x,) c L, 
is said to be a type (in L,) 
with respect to Tiff there is a model 2l of T and elements a,, . . . a, E A 
such that 
Now let T be complete theory in L,. 
@ = (q?(x, . . . x,) E L,: 
(ZI k rp [a, . . . a,]). 
The n-tuple (a, . . . a,,) is said to realize the type @ in (ZI. A model (ZI 
61 

62 
PRIME MODELS 
[12 
of T is said to realize a type @(xl . . . x,) iff some n-tuple in A realizes 
@, and otherwise $?I is said to omit Qi. 
For the remainder of this lecture, we assume 
L, is a countable fragment of L,,, , 
T is a complete theory in L,. 
The above notation will always be used with respect to Ld . 
LEMMA 
A. Let Z be a finite or countable set and for each i E Z, let Qii(x, . . . 
x,,) be a type which contains no complete formulas, with respect to T. 
Then T has a countable model which omits each type !Pi, i E I. 
PROOF. 
It suffices to show that 
TU { A (VX, . . . x,,) V i 
q} 
id 
r p 4  
has a model. Let i E I and let $(xl . . . x,,) be consistent with T. If $ # Qi 
then (-I $) E 
and (1,5 
A 1 
1 
$) is consistent with T. Suppose that 
$ E dji. Then $ is not complete with respect to T, and it follows that there 
is a formula 8(x, . . . x,,) E Ld such that both $ A  8 and $ A 
8 are 
consistent with T. Moreover, either 8 E ai or (7 8) E Qi. Thus in all 
cases we have shown that for some rp E Qii, $ A 1 
rp is consistent with T. 
The desired result now follo%s from the Omitting Types Theorem. -I 
LEMMA 
B. T has a countable model $?I such that for all n < w, every n-tuple 
in A satisfies either a complete formula or an incompletable formula with 
respect to T. 
PROOF. 
For each n c w, let @,(xi . . . x,) be the set of all complete or 
incompletable formulas in the free variables x i ,  . . ., x,. Let $(xl . . . x:,) 
E Ld be consistent with T. Then either $ is incompletable, whence I,!I 
E @,, 
or there is a complete formula q(x1 . . . x,) E @, 
such that T k rp -+ $, 
whence 
By the Omitting Types Theorem, T has a countable model % satisfying 
the sentence 
A rp i s  consistent with T. 
A (VX, . . . x,) VGn. 
n<m 
Clearly % has the required property. -I 
We shall apply these two lemmas to the study of prime models of T. 

121 
PRIME MODELS 
63 
We first introduce the important notion of an elementary submodel in L,. 
DEFINITION. 
M is said to be an elementary submodel of 23 in Ld, in sym- 
bols M -< Ld23, iff 9I c 23 and for every formula cp(x, . . . x,) E Ld (with 
finitely many free variables) and all a, , . . ., a,, E A, 
8 C cp[a, . . . a,,] if and only if 23 I= q[al . . . a,,]. 
M is elementarily embeddable in 23 in L, iff M is isomorphic to some ele- 
mentary submodel of 23 in Ld. We shall say that 8 is a prime model of 
Tiff M is a model of T and M is elementarily embeddable in every model 
of T in Ld. 
These definitions could also be made for arbitrary, as well as countable, 
fragments of L,,,. 
The next theorem is due to VAUGHT [1961] for first order logic, and 
the proof below is a straightforward extension of his argument to L,. 
THEOREM 
16. (i) M is a prime model of Tif and only if M is a model of T 
of power at most o, 
and every n-tuple of elements of A satisfies a complete 
formula in M. 
(ii) Any two prime models of T are isomorphic. 
(iii) T has a prime model if and only if there are no incompletable 
formulas $(x, . . . x,,) with respect to T. 
PROOF. (i) Let M be a prime model of T. Since T has models of power 
at most o, 
M has power at most o. Let a,, . . ., a, E A, and let @(xl . . . x,,) 
be the type realized by (a, , . . ., a,,) in M. If @ contains no complete 
formula, then by Lemma A there is a model of T which omits @. But then 
(11 cannot be elementarily embeddable in 23, because the image of a, , . . ., 
a,, under the elementary embedding must also realize @ in '23. Therefore 
@ contains a complete formula ~ ( x ,  . . . x,,), and (a, , . . ., a,,) satisfies 
cp in M. 
Conversely, suppose M is a countable model of T and every n-tuple in 
M satisfies a complete formula. Let A = {al uz, a3, . . .}. For each 
n < o, 
let cp,,(x, . . . x,,) be a complete formula satisfied by (a1 . . ., an) 
in 8. Then T t= 3x,cp,(xl), so we may choose an element b, E B with 
23 k p,[b,]. In general, if 23 k cp,,[b, . . . b,], then since cpk is complete, 

64 
PRIME MODELS 
112 
we have T I= (P,, + (~X,,+~)(P,,+~, whence we may choose b,+, E B 
with % I= cpn+ [bl . . . b,,, 3. The mapping a,, -+ b,, on A into B construct- 
ed in this way is an elementary embedding of CU into % in L,, because 
any two n-tuples which satisfy the same complete formula must satisfy 
exactly the same formulas of L, . Hence (II is prime. 
(ii) We argue as above, with a back and forth construction between 
two models having the property characteristic of prime models given in (i). 
(iii) Suppose there is an incompletable formula q(x, . . . x,) with 
respect to T. Then for any model (II of T, some n-tuple satisfies cp(xl . . . x,,) 
in a, and thus cannot satisfy any complete formula. Hence by (i) (II is 
not a prime model. 
For the converse, suppose there are no incompletable formulas with 
respect to T. By Lemma B and (i) it follows that T has a prime model. -I 
COROLLARY 
c. If for each n < o, T has at most countably many types 
@(xl . . . x,,), then T has a prime model. 
PROOF. Suppose ~ ( x ,  . . . x,,) is an incompletable formula with respect 
to T. Let Qi(xl . . . x,,), i E I, be all the types in T which contain q ( x ,  . . . 
x,). Then by hypotheses I is countable. Since cp is incompletable, each 
ai contains no complete formulas. Then by Lemma A, T has a model (II 
which omits each Qi, i E I. But T k (3xl , . . x,,)cp, so some a,, . . ., a,, E A 
must satisfy cp. Then the type realized by (al, . . ., a,,> contains cp. This 
is a contradiction and shows that T has no incompletable formulas. Hence 
by Theorem 16 (iii), T has a prime model. i 
COROLLARY 
D. T is o-categorical, that is, any two countable models of 
Tare isomorphic, if and only if 
Ti= A (Vx, . . . x,,) V (cp(xl . . . x,,): cp complete w.r. to T}). 
n<m 
PROOF. By Theorem 16 (i) and (ii). i 

13 
Skolem functions and indiscernibles 
We now turn to an entirely different method of constructing models, 
namely, from Skolem functions. 
Let L, 
be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
The Skolem language L: 
for L, 
is constructed as follows. We first form the language LS). This 
language has all the symbols of L,, 
and, for each formula 3xq(y, . . . y,) 
E L, in which the variables yl, . . ., y,, do not occur bound, L:) 
has 
a new n-placed function symbol F3xrp. We define LS' to be the least 
countable fragment which contains all the formulas of L, 
and all the 
new symbols &,+,. 
Proceeding inductively, for each n < w, n 2 1, define L$+') = L:)"). 
Finally, define 
L: 
= u L'Z. 
n c o  
Then it is clear that L: 
is also a countable fragment. 
whose axioms are all formulas of the form 
The Skolem theory, TSkolem, 
for L, is the theory in the Ianguage L: 
~ X V ( Y ,  
* * * YJ -+ q ( F 3 x J ~ 1  * - * YJY1 . . * ynh 
where 3xq is a formula of L: 
and y,, . . ., y,, do not occur bound in 
3xq. Note that the above axioms are formulas of Ls, because if 3xq 
is in Ls) then the above formula is in LS"). Recall that fragments 
are closed under finite connectives, quantifiers, and substitutions. 
Let 8 be a model for L. By a Skolem expansion of 8 we mean a model 
8* = (8, 
G3xp)3xgEL.d 
61 

68 
SKOLEM FUNCTIONS AND INDISCERNIBLES 
r13 
for the language L: 
which is a model of TSkolem. 
we first prove a useful lemma on elementary submodels. 
LEMMA. 
Let L, 
be a fragment of L,,,, 
and let %, B be models for L. 
Then '23 <L,% 
if and only if B c 8 and for all formulas 3xcp(yl . . ., 
y,) E L, 
and all b,, . . ., b, E B, if M k 3xcp[b, . . . b,] then there exists 
a E B such that 2l k cp[ab, . . . b,]. 
In order to state the fundamental result about Skolem expansions, 
The statement for L and proof are due to TARSKI and VAUGHT 
[1957]. 
PROOF. We show by induction on the complexity of formulas that 
for every formula $(yl , , , y,) E L, and all b,, . . ., b, E B, 
'iY k $[bl . . . b,] if and only if B k $[b, . . . b,]. 
Since 23 c 2l, this holds when $ is atomic. We note that every sub- 
formula of a formula with finitely many free variables has finitely many 
free variables, so we restrict our attention to such formulas. If $ is 
of the form 
8 or 'r\O and 8, or each element of 0, 
has the above 
property, then so does $. Suppose $ = (3x)8(y1 . . . y,). If B t= $[bl . . . 
b,] there exists a E B such that B k 8[ab, . . . b,], whence % t= B[ab, . . . 
b,], and % k $[b, . . . b,]. Suppose that % t= $[b, . . . b,]. Then by hy- 
pothesis there exists a E B such that 91 k 8[ab, . . . b,], whence B t= 
$[b, . . . b,]. -I

(i) Every model % for L has a Skolem expansion with respect to Ld.

Let 
(3x)cp(y, . . . y,) be a formula in L:. 
Choose variables u1 , . . ., u, not 
occurring in 3xcp and form 3cp(u, . . . u,) by substituting free occurrences 
of the y’s for the u’s. Suppose b,, . . ., b, E B and %* k 3xcp(y, , . . y,)

3xcp(u, . . . u,)[bl . . . b,], 
k cp(F,,,(u, . . . un)ul . . . u,) 
[b, . . . b,], since %* is a model of TSkolem. 
Let a = G,,,,,(b, . . . b,) in

whence 
U* 
a* k cp(xu, . . . u,)[ab, . . . b,],

As a first application we have another extension to L, of a result from 
TARSKI and VAUGHT [1957]. 
COROLLARY 
(DOWNWARD 
LOWENHEIM-SKOLEM-TARSKI 
THEOREM). 
Let L, be a countable fragment of L,,, . Let % be a model for L, X c A ,  
and a an infinite cardinal with 1x1 S a 5 IAl. Then % has an elementary 
submodel % <L,% 
such that X c Band IBJ = a. 
PROOF. Choose Y of power a such that X c Y c A .  Let %* be a Skolem 
expansion of %. Let %* be the submodel of %* generated by Y. Then 
%* <L.,%*. 
Hence, letting 8 be the reduct of B* to L, 
<Lg%. 
Since 
Llt& is countable, and a is infinite, IBI = IYI = a. -I 
The Upward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem is not true in general 
for countable fragments. In fact we have the following collection of coun- 
terexamples.

fined recursively by:

PROOF. 
Since u is countable we may write o + a  = {&: n < w}. 
Let L have the binary relation E, the one-placed function r (for 'rank'), 
and constants cp,, n < o. Let cp be the conjunction of the following sen- 
tences: 
(Vx)(x E cBn c-f V x = cBm), 
each n < w. 
Bm<Bn 
(W( v r(x) = CS"). 
(VX, Y>(X E Y + r(x) E r(y)). 
n < w  
r(csn) = can, 
each n < o. 
(Vx, y>[(Vz)(z E x c-f z E y )  + x = y ]  ('extensionality'). 
Since IR(w+a)l = za, we see that cp has the required property. i 
Our next goal is to prove a form of the Upward LGwenheim-Skolem- 
Tarski Theorem for L,. 
If %* is a model of TSkolem 
and X c A, then the submodel of %* gen- 
erated by X will be called the Skolem hull of X in %*, and will be denot- 
ed by Hull,,(X), (or simply HuN(X) if no confusion will result). Thus from 
Theorem 17 we see that 
HUZZ,.(X) <L*,9.1*, 
and when L: 
is countable, [Hull (X)l = w+lXI. 
Another application of Skolem functions is to sets of indiscernible 
elements. This notion and the basic results below were introduced for 
L by EHRENFEUCHT 
and MOSTOWSKI 
[1956]. 
DEFINITION. 
Let L,, be a fragment of L,,,, 
and let % be a model for L. 
By a set of indiscernibles in '$l 
we mean a linearly ordered set ( X ,  <) such 
that X c A and for any two finite increasing sequences x1 < . . . < x,, 
and y 1  < . . . < y,, in ( X ,  <), we have 
(%XI 
* * * x n )  s L L d ( K  Y ,  * .  * yn), 
i.e. the n-tuples (xl,. . ., x,,) and (yl,. . ., y,,) realize the same type of 
L, in 9.I.

The order relation < is not necessarily definable in the model a. 
Consider again a countable fragment L, 
and its Skolem language 
L:. 
Sets of indiscernibles in a model a* of TSkolem are particularly useful. 
Notice that if ( X ,  <) is a set of indiscernibles in a*, then it is also a set 
of indiscernibles in Hull (X), 
because Hull ( X )  
THEOREM 
19 
Suppose a*, B* are models of TSkolem 
for a countable fragment Ld, 
( X ,  <) and (Y, <) are sets of indiscernibles in %*, B*, and finite in- 
creasing sequences from Xand Y realize the same types in L; . Then every 
monomorphism f of ( X ,  <) into (Y, <) can be extended uniquely 
to an elementary embedding f of Hull,,(X) into Hull,,( Y). 
Let %* be a model of TSkolem for a countable fragment L,, let ( X ,  <) 
be an infinite set of indiscernibles in a*, and let (Y, <) be an arbitrary 
infinite linearly ordered set. Then there exists a model B* such that 
( Y ,  < ) is a set of indiscernibles in B*, and the finite increasing sequences 
from X and Y realize the same types. In particular, a* = L.d'i13*.

(i) (ELEMENTARY 
EMBEDDING 
THEOREM) 
(ii) (STRETCHING 
THEOREM) 
PROOF. (i) Any element a E HuN(X) can be expressed in the form 
a = t(x, . . . x,,) where f is a term in L: 
and x1 < . . . < x,, in ( X ,  <). 
If t ,  and t, are two terms and t,(x, . . . x,,) = fz(xl . . . x,,), then any 
increasing n-tuple y1 < . . . c y,, in ( Y ,  <) also satisfies the equation 
tl(y, . . . y,,) = tz(yl . . . y,,). It follows that there is a function f: Hull 
( X )  + Hull (Y) such that for all terms t in n variables and all x, < . . . 
< x,, in ( X ,  <), 
f ( t ( x ,  . . . x,)) = t(fx, . . .fxn). 
(1) 
Let 'p(u, . . . v,) be a formula of L; and let a, , . . ., a, E Hull (X). Sup- 
pose ai = t i ( x , . .  . x,,) where xi < . . . < x,, and i = 1,. . ., m. Then 
the following are equivalent, where u l ,  . . ., u,, are new variables: 
Hull ( X )  C 'p[a, . . . a,] 
Hull ( X )  k 'p(t,(u, . . . u,,) . . . tm(ul . . . u,,))[xl . . . x,,] 
Hull ( Y )  k 'p(t,(u, . . . u,,) . . . t,(u, . . . u,,))Lfxl . . .fx.l

This shows that f is an elementary embedding. 3 is unique because any 
extension offto an elementary embedding must satisfy (1) andfis the on- 
ly extension off satisfying (1). 
(ii) Let Tbe the set of all terms in Lz. If t,(u, . . . on), tz(u, . . . u , ) ~  T, 
write t ,  N t2 iff for any x1 < . . . < x, from ( X ,  <), 
t,(x, I . .  x,) = t,(x, .

in %*. Let 2; 
be the equivalence class oft, . Let B be the set of all formal 
expressions t(y, . . . y,) such that t(u, . . . u,,) E T has at most the free 
variables vl, . . ., u,, and y ,  < . . . < y, E Y. We define an equivalence 
relation M on B as follows. Let t(y, . . . y,), t‘(y; . . . y:.) E B, where 
t(u, . . . v,), t’(u; . . . .Ar) 
E T. The yi and yf may be combined into a 
single increasing sequence z, < . . . < z, in (Y, <), where y ,  = 
zil,. . .,yn = zi,, 
y; = zj,, . . .,yb. = zj,.. Form terms 
t o ( u l . .  . u,,,) 
and r;(u, . . . u,,,) by replacing u,, . . ., u, by oil, . . ., ui, and u ; ,  . . ., ui,, 
by ujl, . . ., ujn., repectively. Then we write 
r(y, . . . y,) w q y ;  . . . y:.) 
if and only if to N t;. 
that it is transitive. We need the following fact: 
The relation M is obviously reflexive and symmetric. We must show 
Suppose t(yl . . .yo), t’(y; . . . y:.) E B, w1 < . . . < w, in 
( Y ,  <), andy, = wkp,y; = wl,. Form t,(u, . . . up), ti(u, . . .up) 
by replacing y, by uk,, y: by ulr, respectively. Then t ,  - ti if and 
The difference between (1) and the definition of M is that z, < . . . < z,,, 
is the least sequence containing the y ,  and y f ,  while w1 < . . . < wp is 
an arbitrary one. Since X is infinite we can find an increasing sequence 
x1 < . . . < x, in ( X ,  <>. Suppose to N td, whence to(x, . . . x,) 
= 
t;(xl.. . x,). 
By the indiscernibility of ( X ,  <), to(xq,. . . x,,) = 
t;(x,, . . . x,,), 
where q, is defined so that 
only if t(yl . . . y,) w t’(y; . . . y;.). 
(1) 
(21 7 * 
2,) = <wql 7 
- 7 Wq,). 
But t,(xl . . . x,) = f O ( x q l . .  . x,,), t;(xl . . . x,) = t;(xq1 . . . x,,). Hen- 
ce ?,(XI . . . xp) = t;(xl . . . x,). By indiscernibility, this holds for all 

131 
SKOLEM FUNCTIONS AND INDISCERNIBLES 
73 
increasing p-tuples from (X, 
<), whence t, - ti. By reversing the ar- 
gument we see that t, - t; implies t, m t;. This proves (1). 
The transitivity of x follows easily from (1). Let B be the set of all 
equivalence classes a", a E B. We treat Y as a subset of B by identifying 
each y E Y with t(y)" where t ( q )  is the term made up of ul alone. It 
follows from (1) that: 
For any a,, . . .,a, E B there exists, for some m < o, terms 
( Y , <) such that a, = t,(y, . . . y,)", . . ., a, = t,(yl . . . y,)?. 
B can be made into a model B* 
for L> by defining relations, functions 
t,(u, . . . u,), . . ., t,(u, . . . U,)E T and y ,  < . . . < y, in 
( 2 )  
and constants as follows: 
R(t,(y, . . . y,)". . . t,(yl . . . y,)") in B* 
iff for all x1 < . . . < x, in ( X ,  <), 
R(t,(x, . . . x,) . . . t,(x, . . . x,)) in a*. 
(Here we are committing the abuse of using the same symbol R for a 
relation of QI* and the corresponding relation of B*.) 
G(t,(y, . , . y,)". . . t,(y, . . . y,)") 
= (G(t, . . . u,). . . t , ( ~ , . .  . u,)) 
(

. . . y m ) ' .  
(Here we use G both for a function on B and the corresponding symbol 
of L:.) 
Finally, each constant c of L> is interpreted by cz in B*. 
One can check that this definition does not depend on the choice of re- 
presentatives of the equivalence classes under w . 
By induction on the complexity of formulas it can be shown that 
an increasing n-tuple from Y satisfies a formula 8(v, . . . u,) of L: 
in 
B* if and only if every increasing n-tuple from X satisfies 8 in a*. The 
Skolem functions are needed for the case where 8 is of the form Vx$ or 
3x$. It follows that Y is a set of indiscernibles in B* and increasing n- 
tuples from X and Y realize the same types in L: . -I 
Note that in the above proof, B* is also the Skolem hull of Y.

Let Ld be a countable fragment and let T be a theory in the

If T has a model %* which is a model of TSkolem 
and has an infinite set of indiscernibles, then T has models of arbitrarily 
large cardinality. 
Furthermore, for any model %* of TSkolem

Erdos-Rado Theorem 
In the next few lectures we shall give some applications of indiscer- 
nible elements. In order to show that models with infinite sets of indis- 
cernibles exist, we need the following partition theorem of ERDOS 
and RADO [1956]. The Erdos notation a + (a)!, where a, p, y are cardi- 
nals and 1 5 n < o, 
is useful here. [XI" is the set of all x c X of power 
exactly n. 
DEFINITION. 
c1+ (a): means that whenever 1x1 = a and the set [X]" is 
written as a union of y sets, [XJ" 
= UiEYCi, 
there is a subset Y c X 
of power I Y [  = 
such that for some i e  y, [Y]" 
c Ci. 
Equivalently, 
given any function f on [X]n into y, there exists a subset Y c X of 
power IYI = p and an i E y such that for all {yl, . . ., y,} E [Y]", 
f ( { y l ,  . . ., y.}) = i. Note that the relation a + (a)! is preserved under 
increasing the number on the left and decreasing the numbers on the 
right. 
Given a cardinal a, we define a0(a) = OL, and for ordinals 5 > 0, 
Zt (a) = sup (2'<(")). E.g., >,(a) = 2".

We claim that PI has an elementary submodel 23 of power >,,(a) such 
that I c B and '23 is >,,-,(a)+-saturated relative to 2. The proof is like 
the proof of the existence of p+-saturated models of power 28. One need 
only form an elementary chain

This is possible because there are at most >,,(a)'n-'(a)

Since M has power > >,,(a), '23 is a proper submodel of 2. Choose

The Hanf number of Lwl, 
In this lecture we shall prove an Upward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski 
Theorem for L,,,. 
The proof will be an application of the Model Exist- 
ence Theorem, indiscernible elements, Skolem functions, and the Erdos- 
Rado Theorem. It is convenient to use the Extended Model Existence 
Theorem which was proved in Lecture 3. 
THEOREM 
21. (UPWARD LOWENHEIM-SKOLEM-TARSKI 
THEOREM 
FOR Ld). 
(MORLEY [1965a] in a special case, LOPEZ-ESCOBAR 
[1966] in general.) 
Let L, be a countable fragment of L,,, 
and T a set of sentences of Ld. 
Suppose that for all a < ol, 
T has a model of power 3,. Then: 
(i) T has a model which has an infinite set of indiscernibles in Ld. 
(ii) T has models of all infinite powers. 
PROOF. We first prove the implication (i) =, (ii). Assume that (i) holds 
for all countable fragments Ld and all T. Form the Skolem lanquage 
L: 
of L,, 
and let T* = T u TSkolem. 
Then L> is a countable fragment 
and T* is a set of sentences of L>. Moreover, by Theorem 17, every mo- 
del of T has an expansion which is a model of T*. 
Hence T* has models 
of power 3, for all a < ol. 
Thus by (i), T* has a model 8* which has 
an infinite set (X, <) of indiscernibles. Let /? be an arbitrary infinite 
cardinal and let (Y, <) be a linearly ordered set of power /?. 
By the Stret- 
ching Theorem (Theorem 19 (ii)), T* has a model !8* 
in which 
( Y ,  <) is a set of indiscernibles. Then B* has power fl. The reduct % of 
!B* to L is thus a model of T of power /I. 
78 

151 
THE HANF NUMBER OF La,, 
19 
We now prove (i). We remark that (ii) was proved by applying (i) 
to the fragment L:. 
We need only prove (i) for an arbitrary L, 
and T, 
since the special case of L: 
and T* is then included. We shall not have 
to mention Skolem functions in the proof of (i). 
Let us form the language M by adding to L two countable sets D = 
{dl, dz, . . .} and C of new constants. Let Md be the least countable 
fragment of M,,, 
which includes L,. 
Let I be the set of all sentences of the forms 
8(di, . . . dip) ts 8(dj, . . . djp), 1 
di = d j ,  
where 8 ( v , . .  . U,)E L,, 
1 5 i, < . . . c i, < w, and 1 s j 1  < . . . < 
j p  < o, 
and i # j .  Then it is easy to see that if 8 is a model for L, and 
a,, az, . . . are elements of A such that (8, a, az . . .) is a model of Z, then 
8 has the infinite set of indiscernibles ( X ,  c) 
where 
X =  {a1,az, ...I, a i < a j i f f i < j ,  
in Ld. Thus to prove (i) it suffices to show that T u Z has a model. 
In view of the Extended Model Existence Theorem, it is sufficient to find 
a consistency property S in Md such that S is non-empty and 
for all cp E TuI and s E S, sw{cp} E S. 
(0) 
We shall now define a set S with the desired properties. Let S be the 
set of all finite sets s of sentences of M, such that: 
Only finitely many c E C and d E D occur in s, say 
s = s(cl.. . c,,,dl.. . d,,). 
(1) 
For all LY < w, there is a model 8 of T and a linearly ordered set 
( X ,  <) such that X c A, 1x1 = a=, and for all 
(I, < . . . < a,, in X ,  
(2) 
(a, a, . . . a,,) C (3, 
. . . u,,,) A s(u, . . . u,dl . , . d,,). 
In the above, it is understood that the constants c1 , . . ., c,,, are replaced 
by new variables u1 , . . ., u, E -01, and that the elements a, , . . ., a,, are 
interpretations of the contants d,, . . ., d,. 
We first claim that 
S is non-empty.

THE HANF NUMBER OF Lmim

For example, consider the logically true sentence (3x)(x = x). Since 
for each a < wI T has a model % of power a,, and since (3x)(x = x) 
contains no constants, conditions (1) and (2) hold for s = {(3x)(x = x)}. 
Thus {(~x)(x = x)} E S. 
Next we show that 
S is a consistency property. 
(4) 
All the parts of the definition of consistency property can be verified in 
a routine way except the condition 
If V 0  E s E S, then for some 8 E 0, s u { O }  E S. 
( 5 )  
We may write s = s(cl . . . c,dl . . . d,), and for all 8 E 0, 8 = 8(c1 . . . 
cmdl . . . d,). Let GI < w , .  Then cr+n < w , .  By (2) we may choose a 
model Ma of T and a linearly ordered set ( X , ,  <> of power IX,l = a,+,, 
X, c A,, such that for all a, < . . . < a, in X,, 
Ma b (324, . . . u,)As(u, . . . umd, . . . d,). 
Then since V 0  E s we see that for all a, < . . . < a, in Xu, 
yl, k v ( 3 U 1  . . .Urn)( A S A 8 ) ( U 1  . . . U m d l  . . . d,).

We may then choose a function f :  [X,y + 0 such that whenever 
a, < . . . < a, in X, and f ( a ,  .. .a,) = 8,

According to the theorem of Erdos and Rado, 
Then, since a,+,, = a,,(>,) 2 a,-,(a,)+, 
we have 
It follows, since 101 S o, 
that there is a set Y, c X, of power IY,l = a,, 
and an element 8, E 0, 
such that for all a, < . . . < a, in Y,,f(al . . . a,) 
= 8,. Using the countability of 0, we see that there exists 8' E 0 such 
that for arbitrarily large a < ol, 
8' = 8,. This means that for arbi- 
trarily large a < o1 
the set s u {O'} has property (2). It follows at once

that s u {O'} satisfies (2) for all CL < a,, 
and therefore s u {O'} E S. This 
proves (5), and (4) follows. 
It remains only to show that S satisfies (0). Let cp E T u 1, and s E S. 
If cp E Tit is obvious that (1) and (2) hold fors u {cp}, whence s u {p} E S. 
Similarly, if cp is of the form -- di 3 dj, then it is clear that s u {cp} E S. 
Suppose now that cp E I, say cp is 
O(di, . . . dip) c) B(dj, . . . djp). 
For this case we must again apply the Erdos-Rado Theorem. Let 
CL < 0 , .  By (2) there is a model 8 of Tand a linearly ordered set ( X ,  <) 
such that 1x1 = &+,,

whence 
we can choose a set Y c X of power IYI = Zu such that the restriction 
of g to [YIP is constant. Then for any a, < . . . < a, and b, < . . . < b, 
in Y, we have 
8 t @[a, . . . up] iff 3 t B[b, . . . b,]. 
Let q = max (n, i,,j,). It follows that for any a, < . . . < ag in Y,

Thus the set s u {p} satisfies (2) and belongs to S. This proves (0), and 
the theorem follows. -I 
The Upward Lowenheim-Skoiem-Tarski Theorem for Ld can be 
combined with Example 18 to compute what is known as the Hanf num- 
ber for L,,, . The Hanf number can be defined in a very general setting. 

82 
THE HANF NUMBER OF 
[I5 
DEFINITION. 
Let Z be a set and for each i E Z let Ki 
be a class of models for 
L. By the Hunf number for the family (Ki: 
i E I }  we mean the least car- 
dinal a such that for all i E I, if Ki contains a model of power 2 a then 
Ki contains arbitrarily large models. The Hunf number of a fragment 
L, of L,,, is the least cardinal a such that for each sentence rp E L,, 
if 
cp has a model of power 2 a then cp has arbitrary large models. That is, 
the Hanf number of L, 
is the Hanf number of the family {Ki: 
i E I }  
where I is the set of all sentences of L, and Ki 
is the class of all models 
of i. For example, the Hanf number of L is a. 
We thus have the 
COROLLARY. 
The Hanf number of the language L,,, is a,,. 
PROOF. Example 18 shows that the Hanf number is 1 a,,. 
Let cp 
be a sentence of L,,, 
which has a model of power 2 a,,. 
There is 
a countable fragment L, with cp E L,. 
By the Downward LST Theorem, 
cp has models of power 
for each a < al. 
Then by Theorem 21, cp 
has arbitrarily large models. Hence the Hanf number is S am,. 4 
The definition of the Hanf number is motivated by the following ob- 
servation of HANF [1964]: 
REMARK. 
Every family (Ki: i E Z} has a Hanf number. 
PROOF. For each i E I, define ai to be zero if Ki 
contains arbitrarily 
large models, and to be the supremum of the powers of the models in 
Ki 
otherwise. By the axiom of replacement, there is a cardinal p such that 
for all ~ E I ,  
ai < p. Then /3 has the property that for all i E Z ,  if Ki has 
a model of power 2 p then Ki has arbitrarily large models. Hence there 
is a least cardinal a with that property. a is the Hanf number of 
{Ki: i E I } .  i 

16 
The Hanf number of L, 
We have seen in the preceding lecture that the Hanf numbers of L and 
L,,, 
are, respectively, w and a,,. 
We shall now generalize the proof 
to obtain the Hanf number for an arbitrary admissible set a2 c HC. 
For any transitive set d, let us write 
o ( d )  = Ord n a2 = least ordinal not in d. 
Thus if &‘ c HC, then w 
.(at’) 5 wl. We have seen in an exercise 
that if &’is an admissible set other than R(w), then w E at’ and thus o ( d )  
> w. 
THEOREM 
22 (MORLEY [1967], BARWISE [1969]). Let .a? c HC be an 
admissible set, d # R(o). Then the Hanf number of L, 
is a0(&). 
In fact, if cp is a sentence of L,, 
and for all a < o(at’), cp has a model of 
power aa, then cp has models of all infinite powers. 
is a refinement 
of Example 18. We need the fact that w E -01, and it must be assumed that 
L has enough relation, function, or constant symbols to carry the example 
through. The details are left to the student. 
We prove the last statement in the theorem, which implies that the 
Hanf number of Lsr is 5 
Suppose cp is a sentence of Lsr and for all a < o ( d ) ,  rp has a model of 
power aa. Then there is a countable fragment La E a2 such that cp E La. 
Let L: 
be the Skolem language of La. Then the Skolem theory TSkolem 
for 
La is a set of sentences of L:. 
Add two infinite sets of constants, C and

D = {d, , d2, . . .} to Lg, and let Ma be the least countable fragment 
containing Lz and these new constants. Finally, let I be the set of all sen- 
tences of Ma of the forms 
l d i ~ d j ,  
l s i < j < w ,  
O(d,, . . . dip) C, O(dj, . . . d,,), 
where B(ul . . . 0,) E Lz, 
1 
i, < . . . < i, < a, 1 5 j ,  < . . . < j ,  < o. 
Then using the A-separation principle we see that each of the sets L:, 
TSkolem, 
C, D, Ma, 
and I are elements of d. 
We wish to find a consistency property S in the language M,,, 
such 
that: 
(b) 
Once this is done, the proof can be completed as follows. By the Extended 
Model Existence Theorem, the set 
(a) 
TSkolem 
{cp> 
For all s E S and $ E I, s u {$) E S. 
TSkolem u (cp> 
has a model. Let (8*, a 1 u 2 . .  .) be such a model. Then the reduct 
8 of %* to L is a model of cp. Moreover, the set X = {al, a 2 , .  . .}, 
with the ordering ai < aj iff i < j ,  is an infinite set of indiscernibles 
for the model %* in the language L:, 
because the set of sentences I holds. 
It now follows from the Stretching Theorem that cp has models of all in- 
finite powers. 
We now shall define the consistency property S which is required. Let 
&(Ma) be the set of all finite sets of sentences of Ma. 
Then &(Ma) E d. 
We shall define recursively a function Q on d into d which has the in- 
tuitive meaning: 
Q(p) is the set of all sets s = so u TSkolem 
u {cp} where so E &,(Ma) 
and it can be seen in at most p steps that no consistency property 
satisfying (a), (b) contains s. 
More formally, Q can be defined recursively by: 
If x is not an ordinal, Q(x) = 0. 
If fi E o ( d ) ,  then Q(p) is the set of all s E sd such that the following for-

After looking back at the definition of consistency property, the relation 
between the above definition of Q(p) and consistency property will be 
clear. (For clarity we used = for the equality symbol of L). 
Using the principle of C-recursive definition, we see that Q(x) is de- 
fined for a11 x E d and that the function Q is A on &’. Let us define S 
as the set of all sets s = so u TSLolern 
u {cp} such that so E &(Ma), only 
finitely many c E C and d E D occur in so, and s 4 UaEo(d)Q(~). 
We claim 
that 
(c) S is a consistency property. 
As an illustration we verify part (C5) of the definition of consistency 
property. 

86 
THE HANF NUMBER OF Ld 
Let V Y E s E Sand suppose that for all $ E Y ,  s u {$} # S. Let ‘ x ~ Q ( y ) ’  
be a L: definition of the relation x E Q(y). Then 
By Z-reflection there is an a E d such that a is transitive, s E d, Y E a, 
and 
(a, E) 1 (W E ~ Y ) ( ~ Y ) ‘ s  u {$I E Q(r)’. 
It follows that 
(d, 
E) 1 (W E Y ) ( ~ Y  
E o(a))‘s u {$} E Q(r)’. 
Therefore s E Q(o(a)), contradicting s E 5’. Thus part (C5) of the defini- 
tion of consistency property holds. 
To complete our proof it remains only to prove (a) and (b). The proof 
of (b) is easy, for if s E Sand $ E I and s u {I)} E Q(a), then s E Q(a + l), 
contradicting s E S; thus s u {$} E S. 
(d) Let s = so u TSkolem 
u {cp}, let so = so(cl . . . c,dl . . . d,,) contain 
only finitely many c E C and d E D, and so E S,(M,). 
Suppose there is 
a model %* and a linearly ordered set (A’, <) such that X c A, 1x1 2 
>o.(8+1), and for all a, < . . . < a,, in X, 
To prove (a) we shall show by induction that for all p E o ( d ) :  
(a*, a, . . . a,,) 
k (3ul.. . urn) A s(uI . . . umd, . . . d,,). 
Then s I Q@). 
The proof of (d) uses the Erdos-Rado Theorem. It is similar to the 
argument used in proving Theorem 21. Suppose (d) holds for all y < p, 
E o ( d ) ,  but that (d) fails for p. There are ten cases corresponding to the 
ten disjuncts in the definition of Q(p). Two of these cases require the 
Erdos-Rado Theorem. One of these cases is where there exists O E I  
and y < p such that s u {el E Q(y). Say 8 = $(di, . . . dip) $(d,, . . . 
djP). But then using (d) for y and the partition relation 
+ 
P 
(>uI.fl+p) 
+ (&d;o.p’ 
whence 1,.(8+1) 
+ (%.(v+1))2 
we obtain a contradiction. The other case is when there exists V Y E S 
such that for all $ E Y there is a y < p with s u {+} E Q(y). This time the 

161 
THE HANF NUMBER OF L& 
87 
partition relation 
&Ll.(p+l) + (&D.pE 
is used to get a contradiction. 
To conclude (a) from (d) we apply (d) in the case that so is the empty 
set. Then no constants from D occur in s = TSkolem 
u (40). 
Since w E d 
and p E d, it can be shown that w (a+ 1) E o ( d ) .  Then by hypothesis 
cp has a model % of power &,,.(p+l). 
Let %* be a Skolem expansion of % 
in the language L:. 
Taking X = A and < arbitrary, the hypotheses of 
(d) are satisfied. Then by (d), s # Q(p). Hence s E S and (a) holds. -I 
HISTORICAL 
REMARK. 
The theorem was first proved by Morley in the 
special case that cp is of the form A,,, 
(Vx, . . . x,,,) Vrn<,cpmnn, 
where 
cpmn E L. The general case was proved by Barwise. The argument of Bar- 
wise, however, was different from the above proof and depended on 
a forcing construction over the admissible set d.

Morley's Two Cardinal Theorem 
In this lecture we generalize the Upward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski 
Theorem to obtain a theorem on pairs of cardinals. We assume throug- 
hout this lecture that U is a one-placed predicate symbol of L, and L, 
is a countable fragment of L,,,,. 
DEFINITION. 
Let '21 = ( A ,  U, . . .) be a model for L and let (X, <) be a 
linearly ordered set with X c A. We say that ( X ,  <) is a set of indiscer- 
nibles over U (for the model '21 in the language L,) iff for all uI , . . ., uq E U 
and every pair of increasing p-tuples x1 c . . . < x p ,  y1 < . . . < y p  
in ( X ,  <), we have 
(a, 
u1 . . . u 4 x ,  . . . x,) 
-L,('21,u1 . . . uqy, . . . y,). 
DEFINITION. 
= ( A ,  Cr, . . .) is said to be a model of type ( K ,  A) iff 
IAl = ii and IUI = 1. A set T of sentences of L, is said to admit ( K ,  A) 
iff T has a model of type (IC, A). 
THEOREM 
23 (MORLEY [1965a]). Let T be a set of sentences of L,. 
Suppose that for all c1 < w1 there exists a cardinal K >= w such that T 
admits (z=(K), K). Then: 
( i )  
T has a model '21 = ( A ,  U, . . .> such that U is infinite and there is 
an infinite set of indiscernibles over U. 
(ii) 
For all cardinals A 2 w, T admits (A, a). 
(ii). Form the 
Skolem language L> and let T* = T u TSkolem. 
Then for all c1 < w1 
88 
PROOF. As in Theorem 21, we first prove that (i) 

171 
MORLEY'S TWO CARDINAL THEOREM 
89 
there exists K 2 w such that T* admits (&(K), 
K ) .  Applying (i) to 
L: 
and T*, there is a model %* = ( A ,  U, . . .) of T* with an infinite 
set ( X ,  <) of indiscernibles over U, i n  L>. We may assume that %* is 
countable, using the Downward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem. 
Moreover, U is infinite and thus IUI = o. For each U E  U add a new 
constant c, to L>, forming the language N,, 
and form the model 
(%*, u ) , . ~ .  Each formula of N, 
contains only finitely many c,. It fol- 
lows that ( X ,  <) is a set of indiscernibles in N,. 
By the StretchingTheo- 
rem, if we let (Y, <) be a simply ordered set of power 2, then there is a 
.model (B*, bJuEU such that (Y, <) is a set of indiscernibles for this mo- 
del in N,, (8*, 
b),,v = Hull(Y), and increasing p-tuples from X and 
Y realize the same types in N,. 
Let 23 = (B, V, . . .) be the reduct of 
this model to L. Then 23 is a model of T and its cardinality is IBI = IYI 
= 1. We claim that V = {b,: u E U }  and thus I Vl = w. For let b E V. 
For some term t(u, . . . up) of N, 
and some y1 -= . . . < y, in Y, b = 
t(y, . . . y,). Let x1 < . . . < x, in X .  Since t(y, . . . y,) E V, Z(X, . . . x,) 
E U. Thus for some u E U, t(xl . . . x,) = u, whence t(y, . . . y,) = b,. 
Therefore V = {b": u E U } ,  and T admits (A, w). 
Proof of (i). The proof is similar to the proof of (i) in Theorem 21. 
Add countable sets C, D of constants to L,, forming M,. 
Let I be the set 
of all sentences of the form 
di = d j ,  i < j < o, 
(Vu, . . . u,)[O(u, . . . ziqdi, . . . dip) t, O(u, . . . uqdj, . . . djJ] 
where O(u, . . . uqul . . . up) E L, 
and i, < . . . < i,, j ,  < . . . < j,. We 
may assume that T contains a set of sentences which says that U is in- 
finite. It is clear that if (%, a, a2 . . .) is a model of T u I then % is a model 
of T which has an infinite set of indiscernibles over U. By the Extended 
Model Existence Theorem, to get a model of T u I it suffices to find a 
consistency property S such that S # 0, and for all s E S and rp E T u I, 
We let S be the set of all finite sets s of sentences of M, 
of the form 
s = s(cI . . . c,d, . . . d,) such that for all c1 < w1 there is a model 
= ( A ,  U, . . .) of T and a linearly ordered set ( X ,  <) with X c A ,  
1x1 I &(IUl), and for all a, < . . . < a, in X, 
s u {cp} E s.

The proof that S has the desired properties is like the proof of Theorem 
21. The main difference is that in showing that s E S, p E Z implies 
s u (p) E S, we use a partition relation of the form 
au+p(lw 
+ ~u(I~I)zpI~l* 
This relation follows from the Erdos-Rado Theorem. -I 
We remark that any set of indiscernibles over U is a set of indiscerni- 
bles. Theorem 21 follows from Theorem 23 by taking U to be a new re- 
lation symbol which is not mentioned in the set of axioms T. 
COROLLARY. 
Let T be a set of sentences of L,. 
If there exists K 2 o 
such that T admits (a,,(~), K ) ,  then for all A 2 o T admits (A, a).

all c1 < o,, 
T admits (aU(ic), K ) .  i

Categoricity in power 
In the next two lectures we shall give some applications of the Two- 
Cardinal Theorem, Theorem 23. 
A class & of models for L is said to be K-categorical, where K is a 
cardinal, iff any two models a, BE& of power K are isomorphic. 
A set T of sentences is K-categorical iff the class of all models of T is 
K-categorical. By way of introduction we state a result of MORLEY 
[1965] 
for first order logic. 
MORLEY 
CATEGORICITY 
THEOREM. 
Let T be a set of sentences of L. If T is K-categorical for some cardinal 
K > o, 
then T is A-categorical for all ;1 > w. 
We shall consider the problem of extending Morley's theorem to 
other kinds of classes of models. We shall first look at the PC, classes 
of models defined below. 
DEFINITION. 
A class& of models of L is said to be a PC,-class iff there 
is an expansion L' of L formed by adding a finite or countable collection 
of new relation, function, or constant symbols, and a set T' of sentences 
of L', such that JI is the class of all reducts to L of models of T'. In other 
words, a PC,-class is the class of all models of an infinitely long second 
order sentence of the form 
W1)(3P,) * * * A q n  
n<a, 
where each qn is finite first order sentence involving the extra symbols 
P,, P,, . . .. 
91 

92 
CATEGORICITY IN POWER 
[I8 
The following example shows that Morley's theorem does not hold in 
general for PC,-classes. 
EXAMPLE 
(SILVER). Let J% be the class of all models 8 = ( A ,  U )  such 
that IAl 
2I"I. Thendl is a PC, class. Moreover, dl is ic-categorical 
if and only if ic = zU for a limit ordinal CL (equivalently, 1 < K implies 
2A < ic). Thus if K is of the form zU, 
CI limit, and A is not of that form, 
then ic-categoricity does not imply I-categoricity for PC,-classes. 
Nevertheless we shall now prove that Morley's theorem does generalize 
to PC,-classes for certain K and A. We shall see later on that it holds when 
K = ol. 
For the present we prove: 
THEOREM 
24. Let IC, A be cardinals such that K > o and 1 = 3,, 
for 
some CI 2 1. Then every PC,-class which is ic-categorical is A-categorical. 
Theorem 24 and also Theorem 25 below are due independently to G. 
To prove the theorem we need some facts about ic-saturated models. 
DEFINITION. 
A model 8 for L is said to be ic-saturated iff for every set 
X c A of power 1x1 < K and every set C(u) of formulas ~ ( u ) ,  with one 
free variable u, in the language of the model (8, x),,~, if every finite sub- 
set of C(u) is satisfiable in (8, 
x),,~, then C(u) is satisfiable by an element 
in (a, x ) ~ ~ ~ .  
That is, the infinite sentence 
Cudnovskii, S .  Shelah, and the author. 
C A ( 3 ~ )  
A &du)l 
+ (30) A z(~> 
TO€S,(~) 
holds in (8, x),,~. 8 is said to be saturated iff 8 is ic-saturated where 
ic is the power of A. 
LEMMA FOR THEOREM 24. 
(i) If ic, p > o then every K-categorical 
PC, class J! has an ol-saturated model of power p. 
(ii) If 8' is a Ic-saturated model for an expansion L' of L, then the reduct 
of 8' to L is K-saturated. 
(iii) If 8, 23 are saturated models of the same power IAI = IBI and if 
8 E 123, then 8 z 23. 
Part (i) is due to MORLEY [1965], and parts (ii) and (iii) are due to 
MORLEY 
and VAUGHT [1962]. The proof of part (i) uses elementary chains, 

181 
CATEGORICITY IN POWER 
93 
which will be introduced later on. We shall postpone the proof of (i) 
to Lecture 22. (ii) is simple, and (iii) uses a 'back and forth' construc- 
tion. We shall not give the details here. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 
24. Let 
be a PC, class which is rc-categorical. 
Let T' be a set of sentences in an expansion L' of L such that A% is 
the class of a11 reducts of models of T'. Let a, 23 E .A have power A. We 
wish to show that 8 E 23. We first claim that 8 E 23. For if 8 $ 23 then 
there is a sentence cp of L such that 8 1 cp and 23 k 1 
cp, whence T' u {cp} 
and T' u { 7 
cp} both have infinite models of power A; then they both 
have models of power K ,  contradicting the K-categoricity of A. 
We next claim that 8 and 23 are saturated. Suppose 8 is not saturated. 
We shall derive a contradiction. Let 8' be a model of T' whose reduct to 
L is 8. 
There is a set X c A of power 1x1 -= A and a set Z(u) of formulas 
in the language of (8, x ) , , ~  which is finitely satisfiable but not satis- 
fiable in (8, x),,~. Then I,Z(u)I -= A. Letf be a one-one function on a sub- 
set U c A onto the set Z(u). Let S c A x A be defined by 
S(a, b) iff u E U and (8, x),,~ kf(u)[b]. 
Form the model 
a1 = (8') 
u, S). 
Since A = D,,., 
where 
ci >= 1 and 
lU/ = Iz'(u)l < A, 
we 
have 
A 2 &,,l(lUl). Let $ be the sentence 
A (VU, . . . U, E U)(3U)[s(U, U) A . . . A s ( U n U ) ]  A 
n < o  
A i 
( 3 U ) ( v U  E U ) s ( U U )  A 
A ( v U  E u) v (3x1 . . . X , ) ( V U ) [ s ( U U )  * 
. . . X , U ) ] .  
W L  
Then $ holds in a,. Thus the set of sentences T' u {$} has a model 
of type (A, I Ul). But T' u {$} is a countable set of sentences in the langu- 
age M,,, 
where M is the language of a1. 
Hence by Theorem 23, T' u {$} 
has a model Gl = (G', V, R) of type (K, 0). But then the reduct 
of G' 
to L is a model in A% of power K ,  and since $ holds in 6, we see easily 
that 0. is not w,-saturated. 
On the other hand, by part (i) of the lemma with p = K ,  -4 has an

CATEGORICIN IN POWER 
r18 
o,-saturated model of power K .  This contradicts the K-categoricity of 
A. We conclude that '% is saturated. Similarly, % is saturated. Since 
'% = 8, it follows from part (iii) of the lemma that '% z 23, whence 
A is 1-categorical. i 
The proof we just carried out actually gives a somewhat more general 
result. 
DEFINITION. 
A class .A of models for L is said to be a PC,-class over 
L,,, iff there is an expansion L' of L formed by adding a finite or coun- 
table collection of new symbols and a countable set T' of sentences of 
I-"," such that A is the class of all reducts to L of models of T'. 
THEOREM 
24 (General form.) 
Let 1 = 
for some ordinal 01 2 1. 
Let IC be an uncountable cardinal. Let A be a PC,-class over L,,,. Then: 
(i) If every model in A of power K is w,-saturated, then every model in 
A of power 1 is saturated. 
(ii) If& is K-categorical and the model of power K is w,-saturated, then 
A? is A-categorical. 
Note that the theorem holds in particular where A is the class of all 
models of a countable set T of sentences of Lala. It also shows, putting 
K = A, that if every model in .A of power 1 is w,-saturated then every 
such model is saturated. 
Theorem 24 is an example of a theorem in classical first order logic 
which is proved by applying a result in the infinitary logic L,,, . Similarly 
the general form of Theorem 24 may be regarded as a theorem about a 
countable fragment Ld which is proved by going to a larger countable 
fragment La. 

19 
Homogeneous models 
Many familiar sentences in L,,, do not have any o,-saturated models. 
Thus to enlarge the scope of the results of the last lecture it is desirable to 
replace the notion of a saturated model by a weaker notion. 
If L, is a fragment of L,,,, 3, 23 are models for L, X c A andfis a 
function on X into B, then the notation 
(a, X ) X d  = L d ( ~ ' f X ) x % X  
means that for every formula q(u, . . . 0,) E L, with finitely many varia- 
bles and any xl, . . ., x, E X, 
2 != q [ x l  . . . x,] iff 23 != qvx, . . .fx,,].

By hypothesis, (1) and (2) hold for all A < w. Assume w 5 A 5 K and 
(l), (2) hold for all p < A. We prove (1) for 1. Let X c A, 1x1 = A. 
We may enumerate X, X = {xu: a < A]. For each a < 1 we shall choose 
by induction an element y, E B such that 
Suppose /? < 1 and we have chosen y, E B, a < p, such that

(3) holds for p = L. This proves (1) for A. The proof of (2) for 1 is similar. 
It follows that (1) and (2) hold for A = K .  Using (1) and (2) for all 1 < K ,  
we can construct an isomorphism between

Theorem 21 T' has a model W generated by an infinite set (X, <) of 
indiscernibles in L;. 
By the Stretching Theorem we may assume that X has 
power K and ( X ,  <) is the ordering of a real closed field of power K. 
Then any two increasing n-tuples in ( X ,  <) can be extended to an auto- 
morphism of (X, <). Moreover, %' has power K. Let % E A? be the re- 
duct of %' to L. 
For a, b E A" define a - b iff there exist terms t,, . . ., t,, of L' and 
x1 < . . . < x,, y ,  < . . . < y, in ( X ,  <) such that 
a, = ti(x, . . . x,,,), bi = t,(y, . . . y,), 
1 5 i < n. 
That is, a and b are built from the same Skolem terms using increasing 
m-tuples from ( X ,  <). We claim that: 
For each n < o, 
N is an equivalence relation on A" with count- 
ably many classes. 
(1) 
If a - b then (W, 
a) 
(W, b). 
(2) 
To see (1) we note that L' has only countably many terms t and every 
element of A is of the form t(x, . . . x,,,). 
To prove (2), extend xi + y j  to an automorphism of ( X ,  <), then by 
Problem 2, Lecture 13, extend this to an automorphismf of %'. Since 
a - b, we must have f(a,) = b,, . . .,f(a,) = b,, whence (2) holds. 
From (2) we see that if a N b then a, b realize the same type in L,,,. 
Hence by (1) only countably many types in L,,, 
are realized in the 
model %. i 
THEOREM 
25. Let K, A be cardinals such that K > w and A = 
for 
some ordinal a 2 1. Let L, be a countable fragment of L,,, 
and let 
A be a PC,-class over L,,,. 
If every model % E A of power K is ( ~ 1 ,  
L,)-homogeneous, then every model 23 E A? of power 2 A is (A, Ld)- 
homogeneous. 
COROLLARY 
1. Let K, A be cardinals such that K > o and A = a,,. 
11, 
a 3 1. Let A? be a PC,-class over L,,,. 
Suppose A? is K-categorical 
and the model in A? of power K is (o, 
, La,,)-homogeneous. Then A? 
is A-categorical. 
We shall first prove the corollary and then the theorem. 

191 
HOMOGENEOUS MODELS 
99 
PROOF 
OF COROLLARY. 
Suppose A is not I-categorical. Then there 
are two non-isomorphic models a, B in A? of power I. Since 1 2 a,, 
we may use Lemma E. Thus the model B E A  
of power ic realizes only 
countably many types in L,,,. 
Therefore there is a countable fragment 
L, of L,,, 
such that for all a, b E C", n < o, 
(C, a) E~,(C, b) iff (c, a) = L , I o ( ~ ,  b). 
We simply put into L, 
a formula to distinguish each pair a, b which 
do not realize the same type in L,,,. 
By hypothesis, C7 is (mi, L,,,)- 
homogeneous. It then follows by (1) that 0. is (ol, 
L,)-homogeneous. 
By Theorem 25, a and B are L,-homogeneous. Then by Lemma D, 
and 8 do not realize the same types in Ld. Thus there is a countable 
set C(u, . . . u,,) of formulas of L, such that, say, 
a k ( 3 U l  . . . U,,) A z(U1 . . . U,,) 
and 
!8 k i 
(3U1 . . . a,,) A z(U1 . . . U,,). 
Let T' be a countable set of sentences in a countable expansion L:,, 
of L,,, 
such that A is the class of all reducts to L of models of T'. 
Then each of the countable sets of sentences 
T' u {(3ul . . . u,,) A C), 
T' U {T (30, . . . V,,)Az) 
has a model of power 1 2  sol. By the Upward and Downward LST 
Theorem, each of these sets has a model of power K ,  contradicting the 
ic-categoricity of A. -I 
PROOF OF THEOREM 
25. Suppose there is a model B €A? of power 
2 12 which is not (A, L,)-homogeneous. 
Let T' be a countable set of 
sentences in some expansion LL,, such that A? is the class of all reducts 
to L of models of T'. There is a set X c B of power 1x1 < I and a func- 
tionfon Xinto B such that (8, 
x),,~ =Ld(B,fx)x,x, but for somey E B 
and all z E B it is not the case that 
(% x, Y),d =Ldd(!83'fxY Z)x,x.

HOMOGENEOUS MODELS

Let B' be an expansion of B to a model of T' and form the model B" = 
(B', X , f ) .  In 8'' 
the following sentence q9 holds: 
A (VX, . . . x, E X)(Cp(Xl . . . x,) c* cp(fx1 * * . f X " ) )  
PEL, 
A(~Y)(VZ) 1 
A (vx1 * * * xn E x)(+(xI . * Xny) c* +(fxl . . . jxn z)). 
Moreover, since I = z,, 
.= and a 2 1 and 1x1 < I S IBI, we have 
IBI L 3,1(lXl). Thus by Theorem 23 the theory T' u {$I has a model 
of type ( K ,  w), say W' 
= (n', Y, 9). Then the reduct 
of a' to L is 
a model in A of power K. Moreover, since q9 holds in W' 
and IYI = 0, 
we see that 'ZT is not (wl, L,)-homogeneous. 
Our proof is comp1ete.i 
The corollary can be slightly generalized to: 
COROLLARY 
2. Let K ,  I satisfy the hypotheses of Corollary 1. Let A- by 
a PC,-class over L;,, 
such that A- is the class of all reducts to L- of 
some class d satisfying the hypotheses of Corollary 1. Then d- 
is 
I-categor ical. 
EXAMPLES. 
Let A, be the class of all models ( A ; ,  U )  such that ( A ,  0
)
 
is a group freely generated by the subset U c A. Then A1 is categorical 
in all uncountable powers and all uncountable models of dl are homo- 
geneous. 
Let dz 
be the class of all free groups. Then dz 
is categorical in all 
uncountable powers. Since A2 is the class of all reducts of models 
in dl, 
dz 
satisfies the hypotheses of Corollary 2. 
Let d3 
be the class of all models of the form ( A ,  U )  where IUI = 0. 
Then d3 
is a PC,-class over L,,, 
and is categorical in every uncountable 
power. d3 
does not satisfy the hypotheses of Corollary 1, because no 
uncountable model of A3 is (wl, L,,,)-homogeneous. 
However, 
satisfies the hypotheses of Corollary 2 because any uncountable model 
( A ,  U, c,,, 
cl, cz, . . .) satisfying the sentence (Vx E U )  v,,,

End elementary extensions 
In this lecture we shall apply the technique of indiscernible elements 
to obtain end extensions of models of set theory. ZF, ZFC, and ZFL de- 
note, respectively, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ZF with the axiom of 
choice, and ZF with the axiom of constructability. 
DEFINITION. Consider a model 2i = ( A ,  E, . . .) where E is a binary 
relation. A model 23 = (B, F, . . .) is said to be an end extension of 
2i iff 23 is a proper extension of PI and for all b E B and a E A ,  if bFu 
then b E A. 
THEOREM 
26 (KEISLER AND MORLEY [1968]). Let % be a countable 
model of ZF. Then 2 has end elementary extensions of arbitrarily large 
cardinality. 
We shall not prove the theorem in its full generality here. Instead we 
prove a simpler special case. 
SPECIAL 
CASE OF THEOREM 
26. Let (21: be a countable model of ZFL. Then 
2 has end elementary extensions of arbitrarily large cardinality. 
PROOF. Add a constant e, to the language for each u E A, and form the 
model 
%’ = <A, E, U).eA. 
Let L be the language of (21:’. Add two countable sets C, D = {d, , d2, . . .} 
of new constants to L, forming the language M. Let T be the set of all 
102 

201 
END ELEMENTARY EXTENSIONS 
103 
sentences of L which hold in a’, plus the infinite sentences 
Vx V (x E e, + x = eb), 
a E A. 
(1) 
bEa 
Thus T is a countable set of sentences of L,,, 
and 8’ is a model of T. 
Let I be the set of all sentences 
‘di is an ordinal’, 
d i E d j ,  where 15 i < j < w, 
B(di, . . . dip) ++ B(d,, . . . d,,), 
where B(ul . . . up) E L, 
and the sequences of i’s and j ’ s  are increasing. Thus I is a set of sentences 
of M. We shall show that 
T v Z has a model. 
(2) 
First we show that (2) implies the conclusion of the theorem. Suppose 
T u Z has a model 
%” = (B’, d, d2 . . .) = (B, F, e,, d, d, . . .)aEA. 
Then with respect to the language L, the set { d l ,  d,, . . .} with the ob- 
vious order is an infinite set of indiscernibles in the model B’. Since ‘iX 
is a model of ZFL, so is 23 = (B, F). Therefore, since in ZFL there is 
a definable well ordering of the universe, the model 23 has a Skolem 
expansion 23* such that for every formula $ of L* there is a formula cp 
of L with B* k cp t) $. Then the set {d,, d,, . . .} is indiscernible in the 
model 
B’* = (@*, ea)aEA. 
Let K 2 w. By the Stretching Theorem there is a model B‘* generated 
by a set (Y, <) of indiscernibles of power IYI = K such that B’* and 
a’* realize the same types in L*. It follows that 93’ and 6’ 
realize the same 
types in L. In particular, since 23’ is a model of T, B’ is a model of T. 
Recalling the way T was defined, this means that B is isomorphic to an 
end elementary extension of 8. Since B‘* is generated by Y, 6 has power 
IYl = K. This is the required conclusion. 
It remains to prove (2). By the Extended Model Existence Theorem, 
it suffices to find a consistency property S in M,,, 
such that S # 0 and 

104

for all (PE T u  rand S E  S, s u {cp} E S .  We define S to be the set of all 
finite sets s of sentences of M,,, 
such that: 
Each cp E s is either a sentence of M, one of the sentences (I), 
or a sentence of the form 
(3) 
V (c E e, + c = eb), a E A ,  C E  C. 
bEa 
Only finitely many c E C and d E D occur in S, say 
s = s(cl . . . cmd1 . . . d,).

(3u, . . . urn) A s(u1 . . . urn& . . . A))]. 
(4) 
( 5 )  
AIXl = a A ( v p  l...pnEX)(pl <... <fin+ 
We claim that S is a consistency property. The only non-trivial step 
is (C5), which reduces to: 
If vb,,(c E e, + c = e,) E s E S, then for some bEa, 
If cpv@ E S E  S, then either s u {cp} E S or s u {@} E S. 
(6) 
(7) 
{c E e, -, c = eb} v s E S. 
For (6) and (7) we use the fact that the formalization of the Erdos-Rado 
Theorem holds in the model %. Assume the hypotheses of (6). Let a 
be a cardinal in %. Let %' k y = 3,(la u a[). For some y E A, ( 5 )  is 
satisfied with y, y in place of u, x. Then using the partition relation 
y + (a)~,, in g, we see that for some bEu, the condition (5) holds for 
a with s replaced by s u {c E e, + c = t?b}- Thus 
a' k (Va)(3b)(3x)[a is a cardinal -+ bEc, A X  is a set of ordinals 
A 1x1 = ClA (vpl . . . p, E X)(j1 < . . . < p, 
(3u)(A s ( u B ~  - - - Pn)A (ui E e, + ui = .,))I, 
with u = (ul . . . urn), c = ci. 
Using the axiom of replacement in % we see that a fixed element bEu 
can be chosen independent of a in the above formula. Therefore 
s u {c E e, + c = eb> belongs to S. The proof of (7) is similar but 

20 1 
END ELEMENTARY EXTENSIONS 
105 
involves partitions into two parts instead of la1 parts. Hence S is a con- 
sistency property. 
Any finite set of logically true sentences of L clearly belongs to S, SO 
S is non-empty. If s E S and cp E T, then s u {cp} E S because 8' k cp. To 
prove that if s E Sand cp E Z then s u {cp} E S, one must use once more the 
Erdos-Rado Theorem in 8. 
The details are similar to the corresponding 
step in the proof of Theorem 21. -I 
The above proof may easily be extended to the case where 8 is a count- 
able model of ZFC by using a lemma which was proved by Solovay using 
the forcing construction. 
LEMMA (SOLOVAY). 
Let 8 = ( A ,  E )  be a countable model of ZFC. 
Then there is a linear ordering 5 of A such that ( A ,  E, I) 
is a model 
of ZFC in which the replacement scheme holds for all formulas involving 
both E and the new relation symbol 5 ,  and such that 
( A ,  E, I) 
k (Vx)(the restriction of 5 to xz is a well-ordering), 
that is, every non-empty set is well-ordered by 5. 
A proof of the above lemma without forcing was announced by 
GAIFMAN 
[1968]. Our proof of the special case of Theorem 26 for models 
of ZFL also shows the following: 
Every model ( A ,  E, 5 )  satisfying the conditions in the above lemma 
has arbitrarily large end elementary extensions. 
However, for every end elementary extension (B, F, 5 ') of ( A ,  E, 5 >, 
( B ,  F )  is an end elementary extension of ( A ,  E). Thus it follows that 
every countable model ( A ,  E )  of ZFC has arbitrarily large end elementary 
extensions. The proof in the case that ( A ,  E )  is only a model of ZF uses 
similar ideas but is more complicated. 
Theorem 26 also holds for countable models of ZF with extra relations, 
provided that the replacement scheme holds for formulas involving the 
extra relation symbols. 
Theorem 26 also holds for uncountable models 
= ( A ,  E )  of 
ZF such that the linearly ordered set (ordinals of 91, E )  has cofinality 0. 
However, it does not hold for all uncountable models of ZF, or even Of 
ZFL. (See KEISLER 
and SILVER [1970].)

Elementary chains 
Beginning with this lecture, we shall add one more method of construct- 
ing models in the languages L,. 
Up to this point we have applied the 
methods of the Model Existence Theorem, Skolem functions, and in- 
discernible elements. The new construction we take up next is the ele- 
mentary chain construction. 
Let L, be a fragment of L,,,. 
We recall that 91 <L, 
'23 means that 
2I c '$3 and for every formula q ( v ,  . . . u,,) E L, with finitely many free 
variables and all a,, . . . a,, E A ,  
'ill k q[a, . . . a,,] iff 23 k q[al . . . a,,]. 
This is equivalent to % c 23 and the relation 
U)oeA =L,(% 
a).EA 
By an elementary chain in L, of length a, where u is an ordinal, we mean 
a sequence 21P, /3 < a, of models for L such that whenever y < /3 < u 
we have 'ill,, <Ld 'illfl. The fundamental result about elementary chains 
is the following result which was proved by Tarski and Vaught for L.

Our main use of elementary chains in L, will be in the study of models 
of power a,. 
The Model Existence Theorem is a powerful tool for con- 
structing models of power coo, while indiscernible elements are a way 
of constructing models of arbitrarily large power when possible. In many 
cases we can construct a model of power a, as the union of an elemen- 
tary chain of countable models in L,. 
Let us consider the following question. Let L, be a fragment of L,,, 
and let (LL be a countable model for L. When does there exist an un- 
countable model 0: with !J < L,O:? 
with 
% < L, 
23. This condition is also sufficient when L, = L,,, 
(Problem 
3, p. 121). GREGORY 
[1970a] showed that this condition is not sufficient 
in general for countable admissible d. The next theorem answers a 
similar question for end elementary extensions. 
In a slightly different form it is proved in KEISLER 
[1970]. 
DEFINITION. 
Let (LL = ( A ,  R, . . .) where R is binary. % = (B, R', . . .) is 
An obvious necessary condition is that there exists a model 23 #

a strong end extension of (21 iff (21 c 8,(21 
# 23, and for all a E A and 
b E B-A, aR'b and not bR'a. 
When R, R' are linear orderings, the notions of end extension and 
strong end extension are equivalent. 
THEOREM 
28. Let (21 = ( A ,  R, . . .) be a countable model for L such that 
R is a transitive, irrefiexive relation on A. For any formula p of Let,, let 
(3 arb. large x)cp = (Vz)(3x)(zRx 
A cp), 
where z does not occur in cp. Let Ld be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
Then the following are equivalent: 
(i) (21 has a strong end elementary extension. 
(ii) (21 has a strong end elementary extension of power o 
(iii) Each of the following are valid in (21: 
(4 
(VY, z)(3x)(yRx A zRx). 
(b) (3 arb. large x)V,<,O, + V,& 
arb. large x)O,, where V.,,O, 
is in L,. 
(c) (3 arb. large x)(3y)cp 
(3y)(3 arb. large x)cp v (3 arb. large y )  
(3x)cp, where cp E Ld. 
(In (b) and (c), the formulas may have finitely many free variables). 
PROOF. We first assume (i) c-, (iii) and prove (i) c) (ii). 
It is trivial that (ii) -+ (i). Assume (i). Since Ld is a fragment, the for- 
mulas (a), (b), and (c) of (iii) all belong to Ld. Thus since (iii) holds 
for (21, (iii) holds for 223 whenever (21 xLd8. Hence (i) holds for 8 when- 
ever % xLd 
23 and 8 is countable. Using (i) o1 
times, and using Theorem 
27, we see that 8 has a strong elementary end extension of power wl. 
For we may form an elementary chain a@, < w1 in Ld such that 
%,, 
= (21 and for y < p < ol, is a strong end extension of %?; thus 
uB<,l has power at least w1 and is a strong end elementary extension 
of a. This proves (ii). 
We now prove (i) + (iii). Let 23 be a strong end elementary extension 
(a) For anyy, z E A, we have yR'b A zR'b, whence 8 
Is (3x)(yRx A zRx), 
of 8. Let b E B - A .  
and hence (a) holds in %.

(b) Suppose 'II k (3 arb. !arge x )  V,,,

Then 23 l= (3

8,[al . . . a,]. 
Hence for some c E B, bR'c and 
23 k Vnc,On[al . . . a,,c]. Then for some n c o, 
23 k O,[a, . . . a,c]. 
Since bR'c and b E B- A, c E B-A. Therefore for all a E A, aR'c. It fol- 
lows that 'II k (3 arb. large x)O,[a, . . . a,], and 'II k V,,,(3 
arb. large 
(c) Suppose 'II l= (3 arb. large x)(3y)cp[al . . . a,]. Then the same holds 
in 23. Hence for some C E  B, bRc and '23 k (3y)cp[a, . . . a,c]. So for 
some dE B, '$3 i= cp[al.. . a,,,cd]. Since bR'c, C E  B-A. 
Case I. d E A .  Then for all z E A, 'B k ( 3 x ) ( z R x ~

same holds in 'II, and 23 i= (3 arb. large x)cp[a, . . . a,d], and % k (3y)

Case 11. d E  B- A. For all Z E  A, zR'd, so '23 I= (3y)(zRy A 3xcp)[al . . . a,], 
and since the same holds in %, % k (3 arb. large y)(3x)cp[al . . . a,,,]. 
x)e,[a, . . . a,,,]. 
Finally we prove (iii) --f (i). Assume (iii). Add to L a constant sym- 
bol en for each a E A and a new constant d. Let L[, be the least countable 
fragment containing L, 
and these new constants. Let a' = (a, 
Let T be the set of all sentences O(d) of L, 
such that 
%' k 
(3 arb. large x )  
O(x). 
That is, rtr' k (3z)(Vx)(zRx --f O(x)). Let cp be the sentence 
cp = A (Vy) V ( y  = eb v en Ry). 
REA 
bsA 
Thus T is a set of sentences of LL, and cp is of the form 
Ancto(Vy)Vmcocpmn, 
each cpmn E LL. Since R is transitive and irreflexive, 
aRb implies that not bRa. It follows that for any model '$3" = ('$3, b,, 
b)aEA of T u (cp}, '23 is isomorphic to a strong end elementary extension 
of 8. To show that T u {cp} has a model we use the Omitting Types 
Theorem (Theorem 13). It thus suffices to prove that: 
T is consistent. 
(1) 
If (3y)$(y) E L, is consistent with T and a E A, then there is a 
b E A such that (3y)($(y) A ( y  = en v e,Ry)) is consistent with 
T. 
(2)

We first prove (1). We add to L> a countable set C of constants, for- 
ming M,. 
Let S be the set of all finite sets s = s(cl . . . c,d) of sentences 
of M, 
such that 
rz1' t (3 arb. large x)(3ul . . . urn) A s(ul . . . urnx). 
Then S is a consistency property. The crucial step, part (C5) of the 
definition, is taken care of by part (iii)(b). For if V,,,O, 
E s E S, then 
'11' P (3 arb. large x)(3u1 . . . urn) v (As A en), 
'11' P (3 arb. large x) V (3u, . . . urn)( A S A  On), 
n < o  
n<w 
and by (iii)(b), there is an n < w such that 
'11' t (3 arb. large x)(3ul . . . urn)( As A On), 
whence s u {On} E S. 
Moreover, S # 0. For by (a) we have 
'11' t (3 arb. large X)(X = x), 
whence {c = c} E S. We claim that 
If s E S and $ E T, then s u {$} E S. 
(3) 
For we have %' i= (3z)(Vx)(zRx + $(x)), and by (a), 
rz1' C (3 arb. large X)(ZRXA 
(3u, . . . urn)As), whence 
'11' i= (3 arb. large x)($(x)A (3ul . . . urn) As). From (3) it follows that 
S' = {S u T: 
s E S }  
(4) 
is a consistency property. Therefore (1) holds. 
We now prove (2). We claim that 
$(d) is consistent with T iff '11' i= (3 arb. large x)$(x). 
(5 1 
For if '11' P (3 arb. large x)$(x) then {$(d)} E S, whence T u {$(d)} E S' 
and has a model. On the other hand, if $(d) is consistent with T then 
not % i= 
(3 arb. large x) 
$(x), whence % C 1 
1 
(3 arb. large 
x) 1 
1 
$(x), % t (3 arb. large x)$(x). 
Now suppose (3y)$(d, y )  is consistent with T. Let a E A. Then 
'11 (3 arb. large x)[(3y)($(xy) A e,Ry) v (3y)($(XY) A 1 
e,RY)].

Hence for some b E A, 8’

Another two cardinal theorem 
In this lecture we give some applications of Theorems 27 and 28 from 
the preceding lecture. Our first theorem is a result about end elementary 
extensions of models of Zermelo set theory. By the rank function we 
mean unique function r(x) on sets to ordinals such that, for each set 
x, r(x) is the least ordinal u for which r(y) < a for all y E x. In ZF, the 
rank function is definable and for each ordinal a, the family {x: r(x) < a> 
is a set, denoted by R(u). 
THEOREM 
29. Let % = ( A ,  E )  be a countable model of Zermelo set 
theory in which the rank function is definable and for all ordinals a, the 
set {x: r(x) < a} exists. The following are equivalent: 
(i) % has a proper end elementary extension. 
(ii) % has an end elementary extension of power w l .  
(iii) % is a model of ZF. 
PROOF. Let R be the relation such that aRb means r(a) < r(b). Then 
R is definable in % and is transitive and irreflexive. Moreover, % satis- 
fies conditions (iii)(a) and (iii)(b) of Theorem 28 when we let Ld be 
first-order logic L. Rewriting (iii)(c) in the form 
(vY)(W(wcp + r ( 4  < a A (3P)(VY)(VX)(cp + r(y) < S) + 
+ ( W ( W V Y ) ( c p  + r ( x )  < a), 
we see that % satisfies (iii)(c) if and only if % is a model of ZF. The result 
thus follows from Theorem 28. -I

ANOTHER TWO CARDINAL THEOREM 
122 
Theorems 30, 31, and 32 below are all in KEISLER 
[1966]. 
The next application is another useful Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski 
theorem for two cardinals. 
THEOREM 
30. Let K ,  A be cardinals with K > A 2 w. Then: 
(i) Let '$I 
= ( A ,  U, . . .) be a model L type ( K ,  A) and let L, be acount- 
able fragment of L,,,.Then thereexist models 23,B such that 23 <L,'zl, 
'23 xLdB, 
'23 is countable, B has type (wl, w), and U has the same inter- 
pretation in 65 as in 23. 
(ii) If T is a countable set of sentences of L,,, 
and T admits (K, A), then 
Tadmits (wl, 
w). 
PROOF. (i) implies (ii), because there is a countable fragment L, 
with T c L,, 
hence if 
We prove (i). By the Downward LST Theorem, there exists a, 
<Ld%, 
such that U c A ,  and A ,  has power A'. 
Then go is of type (A', 
A). Hence 
we may assume that 9 is of type (A', 
A). Now let R be a strict well-or- 
dering of A of order type A'. 
Add a symbol for R to L, forming L .  
Let Lz, be a countable fragment of La,, 
such that L, c LL. Since 
(UI = A < A' 
and 1' 
is regular, U is not cofinal in ( A ,  R). Therefore 
is a model of T then so is 6. 
(a, R) k 
(3 arb. large x)U(x). 
(1) 
Moreover, it is easily seen that (a, R) satisfies the condition (iii) of Theo- 
rem 28. 
By the Downward LST Theorem there is a countable model (23, R') 
<r,,(21, 
R). Then (23, R') satisfies (1) and Theorem 28 (iii). The re- 
lation R' is also transitive and irreflexive. Therefore by Theorem 28, 
(23, R') has a strong elementary end extension (a, R") in Lz, of power 
wl. By (1) for (23, R'). the interpretation of U is the same in B as in 
23. Thus B is a model of type (wl, 0). Since (23, R') <L,,,(a, 
R) and 
(23, R') <L,,,(&, 
R") and L, 
c Lz. we have 23 <L, a, 23 <L,G. 
-I 
Part (ii) of the above theorem was first proved, for first-order logic L 
only, by Vaught. Vaught's proof did not generalize to the languages 
L,, and the theorem in its present form is due to the author. Theorem 
30, like Theorem 23, has applications to categoricity in power. 

221 
ANOTHER TWO CARDINAL THEOREM 
117 
THEOREM 
31. Let A be a PC, class. If A is o,-categorical, then d 
is cate- 
gorical in every power I > o. 
PROOF. A has an o,-saturated model of power w ,  . The proof is just 
like the proof of Theorem 24 but uses the Two-Cardinal Theorem 30 
instead of Theorem 23. One shows that if dl has a model of power I 
which is not saturated, then d 
has a model of power w1 which is not sat- 
urated. i 
The special case of Theorem 31 where A is the class of all models 
of a theory in L is a consequence of the Morley Categoricity Theorem. 
The next result is analogous to Theorem 25. For the corollaries it is impor- 
tant that we have defined A to be ic-categorical iff d has at most one 
model of power K up to isomorphism. Thus if 4 has no models of power 
K, it is still said to be K-categorical. 
THEOREM 
32. Let A be a PC, class over L,,, . Let L, be a countable frag- 
ment of L,,, . Suppose that every model % E 4 of power w1 is L,-homo- 
geneous. Then every uncountable model in 4 is L,-homogeneous. 
PROOF. Like the proof of the Theorem 25. -i 
COROLLARY 
1. Let A be a PC, class over L,,,. 
Suppose A is w,-cate- 
gorical and for some countable fragment L, of L,,,, 
the model of d of 
power o, 
is L,-homogeneous. Then A is I-categorical for every cardinal 
A > 0. 
In the above corollary we cannot conclude that d has any models 
of power I .  However, if we strengthen the hypotheses slightly we obtain 
a stronger conclusion. 
COROLLARY 
2. Let A be a PC, class over L,,, 
which has a model of power 
2 30,. Suppose A is o,-categorical and the model of A of power 
o1 is L,,,-homogeneous. 
Then A is I-categorical and has a model of 
power A for each cardinal I > o. 
This corollary is the analogue of the corollary to Theorem 25. 
We give two more applications of Theorem 30. The following theorem 
is new. 

118

THEOREM 
33. Let A? be a PC, class over L,,,

be a 
countable fragment of L,,,. Suppose A contains a model % of power 
> 2". Then .A! 
contains a model '$3 of power w1 such that only count- 
ably many types in L, are realized in '$3. 
PROOF. 
There are at most 2" sets of formulas of Ld, hence altogether at 
most 2" types in L,. 
Let T' be a set of sentences in an expansion L& of 
L,,, 
such that A is the class of all reducts of models of T'. Then 2l 
is the reduct of some model 8' of T'. Since 9 
realizes at most 2, < IAl 
types in L,, 
there is a set U c A of power I UJ = 2" such that 
(a', U) 
k A (VX, . . . x,)(3u, . . . u, E U)

Call the above sentence 8. By Theorem 30, T' u (8} has a model (B', 
Y )  
of type (wl, w). Since 8 holds in this model, every n-tuple in B realizes 
the same type in L, 
as some n-tuple in V. But V is countable, so the 
reduct 93 of 123' realizes only countably many types in Ld. Since 123' k T'. 
B E A. Finally, 8 has power wl. -1 
Let 23 be a model for L, X c B, and L, a fragment of L,,, . Form the 
language L,(X) 
by adding to L a constant Cb for each b E X and taking 
all formulas obtained from formulas in L, by substituting finitely many 
constants for free variables. Let 123, be the model (93, b)b,x and T, the 
complete theory of '$3, 
in the language Ld(X). 
We recall from Lecture 12 that a type (in one variable) in L,(X) with 
respect to T, is a set of formulas @(x) c L,(X) such that for some model 
'21 of T, and a E A, 
That is, the set of all formulas of L,(X) satisfied by an element a in some 
model 8, of T, is a type w.r. T,. 
When the model 123 is fixed, we may use a briefer notation. By a type 
in Ld over X we mean a type in L,(X) 
with respect to T,. In particular, 
by a type in L, over '$3 we mean a type in L, over B. Since 91B is a model 
of TB if and only if 8 iLd%, 
we see that @(x) is a type over '$3 if and only 
if for some % >L, 
123 and a E A,

A type in L, over Xis realized in 23 iff it is satisfied in BX by some b E B. 
In general, there are at most 2''' types in L, over an infinite set X ,  of 
which at most (BI are realized in 8.

an let L,

0. E A, there are at most IC( types in L, over 6. 
(ii) Suppose that for every model B E ,A? and every countable set X c B, 
23 realizes at most countably many types in L,

model Q E ,A? and every infinite set Y c C, Q realizes at most (YI types in 
L, over Y. 
PROOF. (i) Suppose A% is the class of all reducts of models of T' to 
L. Let B be an infinite model in ,A?, say (C( = I. Let 6' be an expansion of 
0: to a model of T'. Assume that there are R+ different types Za(u), 
u < I f ,  in L,

Given a formula cp in the language L,, 
we may form the formulas cp',

pretation of A' 
in a,, has power wl, and the sentence $ shows that there 
are at least w1 types in L, over 23. 
The proof of (ii) is similar. -1 
The above theorem was first proved by Morley in a different way in 
the special case that .A? is the class of all models of a set T of sentences of 
L. This application of Theorem 30 was suggested by J. Silver. 
We now have the tools necessary to prove part (i) of the lemma for 
Theorem 24. Recall that this lemma was stated and used in Lecture 18 
but its proof was postponed until now. Let us restate the lemma. 
LEMMA 
FOR THEOREM 
24. 
class 4 has an w,-saturated model of power p. 
(i) If K ,  p > w then every K-categorical PC, 
PROOF. Let .A? be the class of all reducts of models of a theory T* in 
an expanded language L". We may assume that T* has Skolem functions. 
We claim that: 
For every countable model '11 E 4, there are only countably 
many types over M. 
(1) 
By Theorem 21 (or by the classical result of Ehrenfeucht and Mostows- 
ki for L), the theory T* has a model generated by an infinite set of indis- 
cernibles, whence by the Stretching Theorem T* has a model B* generated 
by a set ( Y ,  <) of indiscernibles of order type ( K ,  <). Suppose there 
are at least w1 types over M. By the Compactness Theorem for L there is a 
model B > M of power w1 in A! which realizes w1 different types over 
M. 0. has an elementary extension of power K 2 wl, so by the K-categoricity 
of 4 we may assume that 0. < 23. Then A c B and 
23; realizes at least w, types. 
(2) 
Let X be a countable set X c Y such that A c Hull (X). For y, y' E Y 
put y - y' iff for all x E X ,  x < y o x < y' and x = y 9 x = y'. Then 
the equivalence class of y depends only on the least x E X with y < x if 
there is one, and on whether y = x. Hence there are only w equivalence 
classes under -. It follows from the indiscernibility of (Y, <) in B* 
that any two m-tuples 
< ~ I ( Y  1 - * * ~ r n )  . . * t n b l  * * * ~ m ) > ,  
(tl(y; * * * ~ 6 )

Therefore

(3) 
But since A c X ,  (3) contradicts (2). This proves (1). 
We now use (1) to prove the lemma. By (1) and Theorem 34, we have

such that each am

chain of models of T and take unions at the limit ordinals. Then since

Our next theorem is a generalization of the Morley categoricity theorem 
to countable fragments L,. 
It was announced in KEISLER [1969] with- 
out proof. 
THEOREM 
35. Let Ld be a countable fragment of L,,,, 
T c Ld a set of 
sentences, and K, I > w. Assume that: 
(11) For every countable model % of T, there are models B of arbitrar- 
ilylarge power such that $2 <Ld 23. 
(111) Every model 
L,-homogeneous. 
REMARK 
1. In the special case that L, 
is the first order logic L, hy- 
pothesis (11) holds and (I) => (111). Thus only the hypothesis (I) is needed, 
and the theorem reduces to the Morley Categoricity Theorem. 
REMARK 
2. In the special cases that either K = w1 or I = wla, ct 2 1, 
Theorems 32 and 25 already imply the above theorem. In fact, in these 
two special cases the result holds for a PC, class A over L,,, 
and holds 
without hypothesis (11). 
REMARK 
3. The following questions are open: Does Theorem 35 hold 
without hypotheses (III)? Does (I) imply (III)? 
(I) T is K-categorical.

35. In what follows we shall assume all the hypotheses of Theorem 35. 
Our first lemma reduces the proof to showing something about models 
of power o1 
and IC. 
We need the notation below: 
If%!=TaandXcA,then: 
a E X ;  
L,(X) is the least fragment containing Ld and a constant c, for each 
'zlx is the model (ay a),sX; 
Tx is the set of all sentences cp E L,(X) true in ax; 
L> is the Skolem language for L,; 
T* = T u  TSkolem, 
T; = TX u Tkotem. 
LEMMA 
A. Suppose that for every model 'zl of T of power w1 and every 
finite or countable X c A, there is a model B of T of power K such that 
X c B, Bx = L,(xl ax, 
and every type in L,(X) which is omitted in 
!2lx is omitted in BX. 
Then the conclusions of Theorem 35 hold. 
PROOF. By Theorem 32 it suffices to prove 
Every model of T of power w, is L,-homogeneous. 
(1) 
T is @,-categorical. 
(2) 
Suppose the model 
of T of power o1 is not L,-homogeneous. Then 
there is a countable Y c A and a functionfon Y into A and an element 
b E A such that 
(a> 
U).EY = L J ~ > f 4 . € Y

but there is no f b E A  with 
Let X = Yu(fa: a E Y> u (b}. Let Bx be a model of power K such that 
'zlx 
L,Bx and every type in L,(X) omitted in ax is omitted in Bx. 
By (III), B is (a1, 
L,)-homogeneous. Since (3) holds for aY 
it also holds 
for 23. But this means that there existsfb E B such that (4) holds for 23. 
However, since (4) does not hold for any fb E A, the type in L,(X) which 
is realized by fb in 'Bx 
must be omitted in BlX. This contradiction shows 
that % is L,-homogeneous.

To prove (2) it suffices to show that any two models of T of power o1 
realize the same types in L,, 
in view of Lemma D of Lecture 19. Sup- 
pose %, %’ are models of T of power o,, 
% realizes a type Z(v, . . . 0,) 
in L,, 
and %’ omits C(u, . . . v,). Let X = {xl . . . x,} where ( x ,  . . . x,) 
realizes C in U. By (1) there is a model 23, of power K such that (x, . . . x,) 
realizes C in 23. Also, there is a model B’ of T of power K such that every 
type in L, omitted in 8‘ is omitted in 23’. In particular 23‘ omits Z. Thus 
23 and 23‘ are not isomorphic, contradicting (I). -I

B. Let U be a model of T, IAl = w,, X c A, (XI 5 o. Then 
there is a model ‘$3;

PROOF. By the Downward LST Theoremythere is a countable model 
91’ such that X c A’ and %’ XL ‘$1. By (11) there are arbitrarily large 
d-.-,- 
models B’ > Ld %’. It follows that T, has arbitrarily large models, since 
mi, 93; must be models of T,. Then T,* has arbitrarily large models. 
Then by the Upward LST Theorem and the Stretching Theorem, T; 
has a model 23; generated by a set (Y, <) of indiscernibles of type 
(K, <). Thus (i) holds. 
Let % = {as: /? < ol}. 
It follows from (I) and (11) that for each 

126 
MORE ABOUT CATEGORICITY IN POWER 
[23 
countable model a’ of T there is an elementary embeddingf’: a’ <L,B, 
where B is the reduct of B; to L. By induction we shall choose elements 
b, E Hull (Yl), fl < wl, such that for ct = ol, 
Then the mapping a, -+ b, will give the embedding f required in (ii). 
If 01 5 w1 is a limit ordinal and (I) holds for all a’ < a, then (1) holds 
for a. Thus it suffices to assume (1) holds when ct = y and that b, E Hull 
(Yl) for all /? < y, and then show that there exists by E Hull (Y,) such that 
(1) holds when a = y+ 1. Here y is an arbitrary countable ordinal. 
Let ‘W be a countable model such that a’ <Ld% 
and X u {aB: B 5 y }  
c A’. Then there is a mappingf’: a’ iLdB. Therefore 
By (111), B is (a,, 
L,)-homogeneous. 
Hence there exists c E B such that 
We must show that we can choose c E Hull(Yl). For some term t(vl . . . 
u,,) of L*,(X) and some y1 < . . . < y ,  in ( Y ,  <) we have c = t(yl . . . yJ. 
Since y < w1 there is a y E Y, such that for all j? < y, b, E HuN({y’ E Y 
For i = 1, . . ., n let 
Y’ < YI).

Then y ; ,  . . .,yi E Y , .  Set b, = t(y; . . . yi). Then by E Hull(Yl). It fol-

(3) 
Since f’: a’ i L d B  and a‘ <Ld%, 
(1) holds for ct = y + l .  
We now prove (iii). Since the language L>(X) has only countably many 
different terms and the set f(A) has power wl, there must be a single 
term t(v, . . . v,,) of L*,(X) such that for w1 different n-tuples y1 < . . . 
< y,, in (Yl, <), t(y, . . . y,) E ~ ( A ) .  
Thus for each /? < wl we may 
choose a different n-tuple yf < . . . <

no uncountable set of B’s with the same yf). Since ( Y, , c) has order 
type (0, , <) and m is the greatest such integer it is not hard to see that 
we can find a strictly increasing sequence & E  W, y < a,, such that 
y < 6 < w1 implies y? < yk+ , . Thus the sequences ( y f y  . . .

order 2 according to the subscript y. Then (Z, <> has type (K, <) and 
Z ,  is the set consisting of the first w, elements of 2. Since (Y, <) is 
indiscernible in 23; and (4) holds, (Z, <) is indiscernible in 8;. 
By

LEMMA 
c. Let % be a countable model of T. Then there are only countably 
many types over % in Ld. (Equivalently, the theory T A  has only countably 
many types in L,(A).) 
PROOF. By hypothesis (II), TA has arbitrarily large models. Hence 
T,* has arbitrarily large models, whence by Theorem 21 T,* has a model 
932 generated by a set (Y, <) of indiscernibles in L:(A) 
of power 
K. Moreover, since BA is a model of TA, % 
Since L*,(A) has 
only countably many terms and since the type realized by an m-tuple 
(fl(y11

on the terms c,, . . ., t,,, and the relative order of the elements yij in

We claim that: 
Every type over % in L,

By the Downward LST Theorem we may assume C is 
countable. Then by (11), (5 has an extension 8' >L,(5

Recall from Lecture 12 that if T' is a complete theory in L,, 
then 
a formula ~ ( v ,  
. . . v,,) E L, is complete with respect to T' iff 
is con- 
sistent with T' and for all $(ul . . . v,) E L,, 
T' k cp + $ or T' k cp -+ 
1 
$. Moreover, 8 is incompletable w.r. T' iff 8 E L,, 
8 is consistent with 
T', and there is no complete formula cp w.r. T' such that T' k cp + 8. 
Our next lemma is an application of Theorem 16 from that lecture. 
LEMMA 
D. Let % be a model of Tand X c A .  Then there are no incomple- 
table formulas 8 E L,(X) with respect to T,. 
PROOF. Suppose first that X is countable. By the corollary to Lemma 
c, T, has countably many types in L,(X). 
By Corollary c to Theorem 
16, Tx has a prime model, whence by Theorem 16 (iii), there are no in- 
completable formulas $ E L,(X) 
w.r. T,. 
We now consider the general case where X is arbitrary. Suppose 
8(vl . . . v,,) E L,(X) is incompletable w.r. T,. Say 8 = B(vl . . . v,a, . . . 
a,), where a,, . . . u,EX. Let X ,  = {al . . .ap}. For each cp(ul.. . v , ) ~

(2) 
both cp~8, and cph

XI is countable because L,(X,)

We repeat the process, considering all formulas q ( u ,  . . . v,) E L,(X,),

subsets of X such that for any m < w and formula q(u, . . . v,) E L,(X,)

L,(X,), 
and hence for every cp E L,(X,) 
satisfying (1) there is a 
8, E L,(X,) 
satisfying (2). This shows that 8 is incompletable w.r. Txo. 
This contradicts the first paragraph of the proof. i 
The next lemma should be compared with Theorem 16. 
LEMMA 
E. Let 2 be an infinite model of T and X c A. Then T, has a 
model Bx of power 1B1 = w u 1x1 such that every n-tuple in BX satis- 
fies a complete formula of L,(X). 
PROOF. 
We first show the following: 
If a, E A for all y < p and each a, satisfies a complete formula 
with respect to TXvfaa:d<y). 
then each n-tuple (ayi.. . a,=> 
satisfies a complete formula with respect to Tx. 
We prove (1) by induction on y. Suppose y < p and each n-tuple 
y1 < . . . < y, < y, (a,, . . . aYn) satisfies a complete formula with 
respect to Tx, We must show that for all y1 < . . . < yn < y, 
(ay, . . . u,~u,> satisfies a complete formula w.r. T,. 
By hypothesis, 
ay satisfies a complete formula +(u) w.r. TXv(a6:d<yl. 
$(u) has finitely 
many constants, say +(u) = $(uas, . . . as,), with p1 < . . . < P, < Y. 
We may assume that {yl,. . ., y,} c {PI, . . ., p,}.

We now repeat the process with an enu-

a list of all formulas cp(u) E L,(X u {a, : 6 c /3 * n}), and the analogues

whence 8, is a model of T,. Finally, by (1) and (3), every n-tuple in

every n-tuple satisfies a complete formula. Then Ex is a model of T, of

elements of Z which occur as constants in 8. Thus we may write 
0 = O(ul . . . u,zl . . . z,,,). Let z; < . . . < z; be the first m elements in

We conclude our discussion of categoricity in power by showing how 
the Morley Categoricity Theorem folIows from Theorem 35. The Morley 
theorem may be stated as follows: 
MORLEY CATEGORICITY 
THEOREM 
(Restated). If Ld = L then Theorem 
35 holds without hypotheses (11) and (III). 
We can immediately note the following. 
REMARK 
1. If Ld = L, then (11) holds. For the Upward Lowenheim- 
Skolem-Tarski Theorem holds in general for L. 
REMARK 
2. If L, = L and (I) holds, then (111) holds. For by the Lemma 
for Theorem 24, T has an @,-saturated model of power IC, and every 
@,-saturated model is a,-homogeneous. 
From Remarks 1 and 2, Theorem 35 implies the Morley Categoricity 
Theorem. 

24 
Extending models of set theory 
In the next few lectures we shall apply the Omitting Types Theoremand 
the elementary chain construction to the study of models of set theory. 
The results in the next five lectures, 24-28, are in KEISLER 
[1970]. We 
first need some notation. 
Suppose (11 = ( A ,  F ) ,  23 = ( B ,  F )  are models of Zermelo set theory, 
and let (11 < B. For each a E A ,  we let 
aE = {b E A :  bEa}, 
and we define a, for a E B similarly. An element a E A  is said to be 
$xed by B iff a, = aE. Otherwise a is said to be enlarged by B. 
EXAMPLES. 
B is an end extension of M if and only if every a E A is fixed 
by B. (See Lecture 20). If (aE, E )  is well-founded and a is fixed by B, 
then (aF, F )  "= (aE, E ) ,  so (a,, F )  is also well-founded. If B has exactly 
the same ordinals as M, and 91 is well-founded, then B is also well-founded, 
because every element of 8 or 8 has a rank. 
In Zermelo set theory a regular cardinal is defined to be a cardinal m 
with the following property: 
If 1x1 = m, IyI < m, 
and x = U {f(z): z E y }  for some functionf, then 
there exists z E y such that lf(z)l = m. 
We shall find the following generalization of a regular cardinal useful. 
132

EXTENDING MODELS OF SET THEORY

If cp(v) is a formula in the language of the expanded model a,, 
we shall 
define 
cp(P1) = { a  E A :  MA k cp[a]}. 
p(%) will be called a class in 8 (definable with parameters from A ) .  Let 
cp(%), $(a) be classes in M. We say that cp(8) is regular over $(a) iff the 
following holds in MA: 
For all x, y, andf, if ~ ( x )  
and $(y) andf is a function and x = 
u { f ( z ) :  z E y}, then there exists z E y such that cp(f(z)). 
Forexample, theformula 1x1 2 rn is regular over the formula Jyl < m 
if and only if rn is a regular cardinal in 8. We sometimes speak of the 
formula q ( v )  being regular over $(u) in 8, 
when the class cp(8) is regular 
over $(a). 
THEOREM 
36. Let (21 = ( A ,  E )  be a countable model of Zermelo set theory. 
Suppose the class cp(%) is regular over the class +(%)and that the sentences 
(W(cp(U) 
+ I4 2 2), ( V W 4  s 2 + $(4) 
hold in a,. 
Then there is an elementary extension @ = (B, F )  of % 
such that: 
(i) Every a E (~('21) is enlarged. 
(ii) Every a E $(a) is fixed. 
(iii) For every b E cp(@), 
lbFl = ol. 
(iv) For every b E $(B), IbFJ 5 w. 
PROOF. Our first observation is that 
If %A k ( ~ ( a ,  u a,), then a, E (~(9) 
or a, E cp(%). 
(1) 
This is because 8, k $(2) and cpp(8) is regular over $(a). By an easy in- 
duction we see that 
(2) 
If 
k ~ ( a ,  
u . . . u un), then a, E q(%) for some i 5 n. 
To simplify matters, we observe that: 
Without loss of generality we may assume that the class cpp(8) 
is closed under the relation 2 ,  i.e. 'Ir, k cp(x) r\y 3 x + cp(y). (3) 
To prove (3) let cp'(u) = (3u)(u c u A cp(u)). Then cp'(8) is closed under

to prove (3) is that q’@) is regular over $(91). Suppose r, s, f E A and

Then 
hence by regularity of q over $ there exists z,Es with %A k q(g(z,)). 
Then %A t q’(f(z,)), and therefore q(9) 
is regular over $(a). This 
proves (3). We assume hereafter that ~ ( 9 1 )

Our next step is to prove: 
Let a E (a). Then there is a countable (21’ > which enlarges a

Let L(A) be the first order language of the model aA,

T =  Th(%A)u { c E ~ }

By Th(21A), Q is an elementary extension of a. We must have c E Q - A ,  
because if c E A then %A t 
q ( { c } )  and thus T k c # {c}, which is im- 
possible if T u { x }  has a model. Therefore by c E a, a is enlarged by (5. 
Hence to prove (4) it suffices to show that T u {x} has a model. We shall 
show this by applying the Omitting Types Theorem. We claim that for 
every sentence 8(c) of L(A u {c}), 
d(c) is consistent with T if and only if 9, k q ( { x  E a: d(x)}). ( 5 )

In case (7), we conclude from ( 5 )  that

[24 
In case (8), we use the assumption that q(8) is regular over $(a) and 
we see that for some e E dE, 
k q ( { x  E a :  e(x e)}). 
Therefore O(ce) is consistent with T, so 
(3u)(u = e A O(cu)) is consistent with T. 
(10) 
We have shown that (6) implies (9) or (10). It then follows from the 
Omitting Types Theorem (Theorem 13) that T u {x} has a countable 
model. This completes the proof of (4). 
We note that every countable model 
= 8 satisfies the hypotheses 
of the theorem and thus satisfies the conclusion of (4). We next prove 
8 has a countable elementary extension 23 which satisfies con- 
clusions (i) and (ii) of the theorem, i.e. every a E q(8) 
is 
enlarged and every UE$(%) 
is fixed. 
(11) 
Since 8 is countable, q(%) is at most countable and we may list its ele- 
ments, q(8) 
= {a,, a,, . . .}. (If q(%) is empty we may take B = 8 and 
the theorem holds trivially. We now tacitly assume cp(8) # 0). This list 
may have repetitions. Using (4) w times we form an elementary chain 
8 = $lo < g1 < . . . of length w such that each a, is countable, and in 
passing from an to 8,+ the element a, is enlarged but each b E $(a,) is 
fixed. By induction on n we see that in passing from 8 to an+, 
each 
b E $(a) is fixed. Now let B = u,.=m8,. 
Then 23 clearly satisfies the 
conclusion of (11). We remark, as in the case of (4), that since every 
countable model 8, = 8 satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem it satis- 
fies the conclusion of (11). 
To complete the proof of the theorem we apply (11) w1 times. We thus 
form an elementary chain 
a < o, of countable models such that 
8, = 8; 
For limit ordinals a, 8, = uB<,8B; 
For all a < wl, every a E q(8,) 
is enlarged in passing to i?l,+,; 
For all a < wl, every a E $(a,) is fixed in passing to a,+,. 
We let 23 = 
= L),<m,%,. By induction on y we see that whenever 

241 
EXTENDING MODELS OF SET THEORY 
137 
a E $(2lm) and GI < y 5 wl, a is fixed in passing from 
to a,. This shows 
that % satisfies conclusion (ii). Furthermore, if b E $(B) then for some 
GI < ol, 
b E $(Bm), 
whence b, = bEa and so Ib,l 5 o. This shows that 
23 satisfies conclusion (iv). Each a E cp(8) is enlarged in passing to ?Il, 
and thus is enlarged in passing to 23, for 8 < 8, < B. Hence 23 satisfies 
(i). Finally we verify that 23 satisfies (iii). Let b E cp(B). For some GI < co1, 
b E cp(?Ia). Then for all y, CI 5 y < wl, b ~cp(8~). 
Hence for each such y there 
is an element b, E bE,,+,-bE,. Since the sets bEY, 
GI 5 y < o1 form an 
increasing chain of subsets of b,, the set {by: 
GI 5 y < ol} 
is an uncount- 
able subset of b,. Thus IbFJ 2 ol. 
But each am 
is countable, so IBI 5 o1 
whence lbFl = ol. 
This verifies (iii) and completes the proof. i

(ii) Every element of power < m in i?l is fixed.

o-model of Zermelo set theory plus ‘wi is regular’. Then there is an o- 
model 115 > 8 such that if 115 t (b = ol), lbFl = w l .  
We shall use the following lemma to obtain extensions having exactly 
the same ordinals as the original model in many situations.

PROOF. 
We show that for every formula cp(uo . . . u,) and all cl, . . ., c,

If 23 k (3uo)p[cl . . . c,] then for some co E C, B k cp[co . . . c,].

It will then follow that 0. i

23 and 'Z c Q, we can 
conclude from (1) that the required formula B i 
0. i 
'23 holds. 
For some a E A, 23 k (a is an ordinal), and 
B C c1 E R(Ix)A. . . A  c, E R(a). 
By the reflection principle in 8 there exists fl E A such that 8 k (fl is an 
ordinal) A a 5 /?, and both the formulas cp, (3uo)cp are absolute for B and 
the R(P) of B; that is, 
8 k uo, . . ., u, E R(B) + (cp(uo . . . u,) c-) cpR'B)(~o. . . on)), 
(2) 
and 
B t. u l ,  . . ., u, E R(B) -+ ((3uo)cp(u . . . u,,)c-)(3uo E R(/3))cpR'B'(uo . . . u,)).

Thus (2) and (3) hold for 23 with u l , .  . ., u, replaced by cl,. . ., c,. 
By assumption, 23 k (3uo)cp[c . . . c,]. Hence by (3) there exists co E B 
such that 
8 C co E R(P) A rpR(')[c0 . . . c,]. 
Using (2), 
Therefore co E C and (1) holds for 'p. -I 
COROLLARY 
D. Let B be a countable model of ZF plus 'every union of a 
well-orderable set of well-orderable sets is well-orderable'. Then there is 
a model 23 > B such that 
(i) B has exactly the same ordinals as B. 
(ii) For every b E B such that 23 C (b is not well-orderable), we have 
23 C c0 E R ( / ~ ) A ~ [ C ~ .

lbFl = 0 1 .  
Moreover, if B is well-founded so is B.

REMARK. 
The conclusion (i) implies that every well-orderable u E A is 
fixed, and also if b E B and 8 
k (b is well-orderable), then lbFl 5 w. 
Conclusion (ii) implies that every non well-orderable a E A is enlarged. 
Examples of well-founded models M satisfying the hypotheses of the corol- 
lary and in which not every set is well-orderable (i.e. choice fails) have 
been given, e.g., by MATHIAS 
[1970]. 
PROOF 
OF COROLLARY 
D. Let q ( u )  be the formula ‘u is not well-order- 
able’ and $(u) be ‘ u  is well-orderable’. It then follows from the hypoth- 
eses that q(M) is regular over $(a). Hence by Theorem 36 there exists 
8’ 
> CU such that every ordinal of M is fixed and for all non-well-orderable 
b E B’, IbPl = ol. 
By Lemma c the submodel B of all b E 23’ such that 
for some CI E A, B’ k b E R(a), is such that 9l < B i 
93’. It follows that 
8 has exactly the same ordinals as a, i.e. (i) holds. Since bF = bF, for all 
b E B, (ii) also holds. The ‘moreover’ clause follows at once from (i). -I 
Our next aim is to generalize the last corollary to arbitrary models of 
ZF. 
LEMMA 
E. There is a formula W(u) of ZF such that in every model % 
of ZF, W(M) is the least class in 
(i) Every singleton of % belongs to W(M). 
(ii) W(M) is closed under unions of well-orderable subsets, that is, if 
uE c W(M) and % C (a is well-orderable), then % k W ( u  a). 
PROOF. For each ordinal a, define W, to be the least subset of R(a+ 1) 
which contains all singletons in R(a+ 1) and is closed under unions of 
well-orderable subsets. This definition can be expressed in ZF. If a < j, 
then W, n R(a+ 1) is obviously closed under unions of well-orderable 
subsets and contains all singletons in R(a + l), whence W, c W,. Define 
W(v) c, (3a)(a is an ordinal A v E W,). 
such that: 
Then W(u) clearly satisfies (i) and (ii). Let M be a model of ZF and sup- 
pose a class q(M) satisfies (i) and (ii). Since each R(a+ 1) is closed under 
unions of subsets, each set q(%) n R(a+ 1) is closed under unions of 
well-orderable subsets. Therefore each W, c cp(%), 
whence W(%) c 
q(%). This shows that W(M) is the least class satisfying (i) and (ii). i

COROLLARY 
H. Let W be a countable model of ZF. Then there exists an 
elementary extension 23 > W such that 23 has exactly the same ordinals

PROOF. 
By Theorem 36 there exists 23' > W such that each ordinal of &L 
is fixed and for all b E B'- W(B'), IbF.l = w1 (using Lemma G ) .  Let 8 
be the submodel of 23' such that 
B = (b E B': For some ordinal a of 2, 
23' b b E R(a)}. 
By Lemma c, W < 23 < 23'. It is easy to see that 23 has exactly the same 
ordinals as W and that for all b E B, bF = bF'. The result follows. i 
COROLLARY 
I. Let W be a well-founded model of ZF and let 23 > W have

PROOF. 
By induction on the ordinals a of W, show that every a E W"(W)

Dedekind sets. Halpern and Levy, and later Mathias, have given examples 
of countable €-models of ZF in which every set can be linearly ordered 
but the set of real numbers has a Dedekind subset. These models satisfy 
the hypotheses of the next corollary. 
COROLLARY 
J. Let % be a countable model of ZF in which the following 
holds: 
If 0 < Ix,I < o for all n < o, 
then the sequence (xn: n < o) 
has a choice function. 
Then there is a model 23 > % which has exactly the same ordinals as 9.l 
and such that for all b E B, if 23 C b is Dedekind then lbFl = ol. 
Thus 
Dedekind sets are ‘much larger’ than the class of all ordinals when % 
is viewed from the outside. 
PROOF. In view of our previous arguments it suffices to show that the 
class cp(%) of all Dedekind sets in 2 is regular over the class I)(%) 
of all 
ordinals of a. Let x E cp(%), 
y E I)(%), 
and 
fl C (f is a function and x = u { f ( z ) :  z E y}). 
Suppose that for all zEy, % k If(z)l < o. 
Since 2 C (y is an ordinal), we 
may assume without loss of generality that 
% C (z E z‘ E y +f(z),f(z’) are disjoint and non-empty). 
For we may replace f ( z ’ )  by f(z’)- u z s z , f ( z )  and ‘delete’ z’s with f ( z )  
empty. If 
k y < o, 
then % C 1x1 < o, 
contradicting % C x is Dedekind. 
Thus 2 C y 2 w. Using our choice assumption, 
8 
C (3g)(g is a choice function for (f(n): n < 0)). 
Let % C u = {g(n): n < w}. Since the f(n)’s are disjoint, % k IuI = 
to A u c x. But this contradicts 2 I= (x is Dedekind). We cannot have 
Yl k If(z)l 2 w. Hence for some zEy, % C ( f ( z )  is Dedekind), i.e. 
‘!I k cp(f(z)). -I 
Corollaries H and I can be explained in terms of transitive E-models. 
If \u = ( A ,  E) is a transitive €-model of ZF, then by ord(%) we mean the 

251 
SHORT, UNCOUNTABLE MODELS OF SET THEORY 
143 
least ordinal not in A, which coincides with the set of all ordinals u E A .  
Using Corollaries H and I we can draw the following conclusions: 
Let T be a complete extension of ZF. Then T has a transitive ernode123 
of power u1 such that ord(23) is countable if and only if T has a countable 
transitive €-model and T k (3u) 
T has a transitive €-model 23 of power o1 
with ord(23) = a, (a a given 
countable ordinal), if and only if T has a countable transitive model 91 
with ord(9l) = u and T b (30) 1 
W(u). 
Theorem 36 above appeared in KEISLER [1970], Corollaries A and B 
appeared earlier in KEISLER 
and MORLEY [1968]. The models mentioned 
in connection with Corollary J are constructed in HALPERN 
and LEVY 
[1970] and MATHIAS [1970]. 
The first examples of transitive €-models 23 of ZF such that ord(23) is 
countable but 93 has power w1 were constructed by Cohen and were not 
published. His proof used the forcing construction. His method was re- 
fined by Easton, Solovay, and Sacks to obtain transitive €-models 23 of 
ZF such that ord(23) is countable and 23 has power 2" (also unpublished). 
They evidently did not settle exactly which complete extensions of ZF 
have such models, as in Corollaries H and r above. The precise connection 
between the models of this kind constructed via forcing and via the Omit- 
ting Types Theorem has not been worked out. The question of whether 
Corollary H holds with 2" in place of o1 
is open.

Lebesgue measure 
In this lecture we shall consider models of ZF in which every set is 
Lebesgue measurable. Our first result is another corollary of Theorem 36. 
COROLLARY. 
Let '21 be a countable model of ZF such that 
'21 != (any well-ordered union of sets of reals of Lebesgue measure0 has 
Lebesgue measure 0). 
Then there is a model 8 > '21 which has exactly the same ordinals as % 
such that if 23 i= b = S(o) then lbFl = ol. 
PROOF, Let q ( u )  say that u is a set of real numbers and u does not have 
Lebesgue measure 0. Then it follows from our hypotheses that q(%) 
is regular over the class of all ordinals of '21. Since when we identify 
S(o) with the real unit interval it has Lebesgue measure 1, the desired 
result follows from Theorem 36 and Lemma c. i 
From now on it is convenient to identify S(o) with the real unit interval 
[0, 11 in the canonical way (binary expansions). We shall use p(x) to 
denote the Lebesgue measure of x ,  p* and p* denote inner and outer 
Lebesgue measure, respectively. If '21 = ( A ,  E) is a transitive €-model of 
ZF, then [0, 11 n A E A and [0, I ]  n A satisfies the formula u = [O, 11 
in 21. For this reason it is better to state our results in terms of transitive 
E-models instead of well-founded models. We recall that every well- 
founded model of ZF is isomorphic to a transitive €-model of ZF. In 
what follows we shall show that it is possible to have transitive E-models

LESBESGUE MEASURE 
145 
\zI of ZF in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable and [O, 11 n A 
is quite large. 
It was shown by Mycielski and Swierczkowski that the Axiom of De- 
terminateness has the following consequences: 
I. Every set x c [0, 11 is Lebesgue measurable. 
11. Every sequence (x,,: 
n < w )  of non-empty sets x, c [0, 11 has a 
choice function. 
It is not hard to show that I and I1 imply 
111. The union of any well-ordered sequence of sets of reals of Lebesgue 
measure 0 has Lebesgue measure 0. 
Moreover, it was shown by Solovay that if ZF has a transitive €-model 
with an inaccessible cardinal then ZF has a transitive E-model in which 
1-111 above hold (and also the axiom of dependent choice). 
THEOREM 
37. Assume the continuum hypothesis 2" = wl. Let % = 
( A ,  E) be a countable transitive €-model of ZF+I+II+III. Then there 
is a transitive E-mod61 B = (B, E) such that: 
(i) ord(%) = ord(8). 
(ii) There is an elementary embeddingf: % < B which is the identity 
on ord(8). 
(iii) The set [0, 11 n B has outer Lebesgue measure 1 in the real world, 
p*([O, 11 n B) = 1. 
REMARK. 
The condition p*([O, 11 n B) = 1 is best possible in the sense 
that we must have p*([O, 13 n B) = 0. This was pointed out by Kunen. 
[0, 11 n B must be a proper subset of [0, 11 since B contains only count- 
ably many ordinals and thus there are elements of [0, 11 which code 
ordinals not in B (i.e. they are of the form {2"3": (n, m) E y }  where y is 
a well ordering of w of order type not in B). Moreover, [0, 11 n B is a 
subgroup of [0, 11 under addition modulo 1, and it is a classical result 
that any proper subgroup of [0,1] has inner measure 0. 
PROOF 
OF THEOREM 
37. We use the fact that every subset of [0, 11 which 
meets every closed set of positive measure has outer measure 1. We shall 
prove:

LESBEGUE MEASURE 
[26 
Let ( A , ,  E,) be a countable well-founded model of ZF + I +I1 
+III, and let X c [0, 11 be a closed set with p ( X )  > 0. Then 
there exists r E X and a model ( A , ,  El) > ( A , ,  E,) with 
the same ordinals as ( A , , E , )  such that for some b E A , ,  
r = {n < w: (A,,,!?,) k neb}. 
(1) 
Suppose we have proved (1). There are 2" = w1 closed subsets of [0, 11. 
We apply (1) w1 times, once for each closed set X c [0, 11 of positive 
measure, and thus form an elementary chain am, 
u < wl, 
starting with 
fl and taking unions at the limit ordinals. The union 23' of this elementary 
chain is an elementary extension of fl, , has exactly the same ordinals as 
a,, and for each X c [0, 13 of positive measure there is a b E B' with 
{n < w : 2 3 ' C n E b } E X .  
Thus the transitive realization 23 of 23' has the same ordinals as fl and 
p*([O, I] n B) = 1. Thus it suffices to prove (1) for the theorem. 
We now prove (1). We may assume that ( A , ,  E,) is a transitive E- 
model, since it is isomorphic to one. Thus we may assume ( A , ,  E,) = 
( A ,  E). Let X c [0, 11 be a closed set with p ( X )  = 1 > 0. X may be 
written in the form X = n,,, 
X,, where X ,  3 X ,  3 X ,  3 . . . and each 
X,, is a finite union of closed intervals with rational endpoints, say 
X n  = Cx.13 
~ n , l  u * * * u CXnpn 9 ~ n p , l *  
The xij and y i j ,  being rational, belong to A. For each n let a,, = X,, n A .  
Then a,, E A, and indeed 
fl k an = [ X n I  3 ~ n l l  
u * . * u [xnp,

Suppose

The property of Baire 
We shall give analogues to the results of the last lecture with the notion 
of Baire category in place of Lebesgue measure. A set X c [0,1] is said 
to be offirst category if€ X is disjoint from some countable intersection 
of dense open sets. The classical Baire category theorem states that in 
ZFC any countable union of sets of first category again has first category. 
Mycielski has shown that the Axiom of Determinateness also has the 
following consequence: 
1'. Every set x c [0, 11 has the property of Baire, that is, there exists an 
open set y c [0, I ]  such that the symmetric difference ( x - y )  u ( y - x )  
is of first category. 
Solovay's model of ZF + I + I1 + I11 also satisfies 1'. Moreover, Kunen 
has shown that I' and the 'countable choice' property I1 imply 
111'. The union of any well-ordered sequence of sets of reals of first cate- 
gory has first category. 
THEOREM 
38. Assume the continuum hypothesis 2'" = wl. Let % = (%, E) 
be a countable transitive €-model of ZF + I' + I1 + 111'. Then there is a 
transitive €-model 23 = (B, E) such that: 
(i) ord(%) = ord(%). 
(ii) There is an elementary embedding$ % < 23 which is the identity on 
ord(%). 
(iii') The set [0, 11 n B is not of first category in the real world.

Moreover, if 8 is also a model of I and I11 then 23 can be found so that 
in addition 
(iii) The set [0, 11 n B has outer Lebesgue measure one in the real world. 
PROOF. 
Since the methods are similar to those we have used before, we 
shall only sketch the main points of the proof. It is sufficient to show that: 
For every countable E-model % = ( A ,  E) of ZF+l’+Il+TII’ 
and every set Y c [0, I] which is a countable intersection of 
dense open sets, there is a model 8 > 8 which has exactly the 
same ordinals as 
and an element c E B such that 
r = { n ~ ~ : B k n n c } ~ Y .  
(1) 
We may represent Y in the form Y = nn<, 
Yn where each Y,, is a 
dense open set of the form 
K = u 
(xmn 9 Ymn), x i j ,  Yij rational, 
m < w  
and Yo 2 Y, 3 Y, 3 . . .. Form the language L(A u {c}) and let T be 
the following set of sentences: 
T = Th(aA) u {c E [0, 111 u {c d a :  
C (a has first category)}. 
We wish to show that 
T u {(Vx)(ord(x) + V x = a)} u { A V c E ( X m n  9 Y m n ) }  
(2) 
asord(%) 
ncco m C o  
has a model. (2) will clearly imply (1). The proof of (2) uses the Omitting 
Types Theorem. The criterion for consistency with T is 
q(c) is consistent with T if and only if 
k ( { x  E [0, 11: ~ ( x ) }  
is not of first category). 
(3) 
Thus Tis consistent. To use the Omitting Types Theorem the following 
two facts must be shown. 
If (3y)(y is an ordinal A p(c, y)) is consistent with T, then there 
is an a E ord(8) such that q(c, a) is consistent with T. 
q(c) A c E (x,,,, y,,,) is consistent with T.

(5) 
If q(c) is consistent with T and n < o, 
then for some m < W,

THE PROPERTY OF BAIRE

The proof of (4) uses hypothesis HI’, while the proof of ( 5 )  uses 1’. 
The first clause of the theorem is proved by using (1) w1 times. The 
‘moreover’ clause is proved by alternately using (1) of this proof and 
(I) of the proof of Theorem 37 w1 times. 4 
Without the continuum hypothesis one can prove a weaker form of 
Theorem 38 like the weaker form of Theorem 37 which we stated above. 
Theorems 37 and 38 are due to the author, and answer questions 
proposed by K. Kunen. They were stated without proof in KEISLER 
[1970].

Second order number theory 
We shall now give an application of our methods to models of second 
order number theory. Second order number theory has two kinds of 
variables: 
number variables x, y, z, . . ., 
set variables X ,  Y, Z, . . .. 
In addition it has the symbols = , E, a constant 0, the successor functions, 
and + , .. The symbols s, + , 
*, 0 are applied to number variables to form 
terms. The = symbol is meaningful between two set variables or two 
number terms, and E goes between a number term and set variable. The 
axioms of second order number theory with choice are: 
Peano's axioms, including induction. 
Extensionality: X = Y c-, (Vx)(x E X - 
x E Y ) .  
The comprehension scheme: 
(3X)(Vy)(y E X c r  q(y, . . .)), where X does not occur in q(y, . . .), 
but other free variables may. 
The choice scheme: 
(Vx)(3Y)cp(xY. . .) + (3Y)(Vx)cp(xYx . . .), where Y, = {y: 2" 
3y 
E Y }  with the obvious abbreviations. 
A model of second order number theory is a model of the form 2 = 
(N, 
A, 0, s, + , 
a )  where A c S(N), the number variables range over N, 
the set variables over A, and all the axioms hold when E has the standard 
meaning. An w-model is a model A = (w, A, 0, s, + , -) where A c S(w) 
154 

28 1 
SECOND ORDER NUMBER THEORY 
155 
and 0, s, + , . are standard. An o-model is completely determined by the 
set A c S(o). The notion of an elementary extension is meant now in the 
sense of second order logic. 
THEOREM 
39. Let A be a countable w-model of second order number 
theory with choice. Then: 
(i) There exists an elementary extension B > A which is an w-model of 
power ol. 
(ii) Let S(o) have the ‘product topology’ under the identification of 
S(o) with 2”. Suppose S is a countable union of closed sets in S(w) such 
that S n A = 0. Then in (i), B may be chosen so that S n B = 0. In 
particular, if S is countable and S n A = 0, we can find B with S n B 
= 0. 
I 
l 
PROOF. 
We first prove part (i). Add a new constant to the language for 
each element of A, and form the model A, of this expanded language 
L(A). We shall call a formula cp( V )  of L(A) with one free set variable 
‘enumerable’ (in A )  if and only if 
A, b (3 V(VV)(cp(V> + ( W ( V  = Q). 
{ VE A : A, b cp( V ) }  c { vx : x E o}, 
Intuitively, this means that 
so that U ‘enumerates’ cp( V). It is easy to see that 
If cpl( V )  and cpz( V )  are enumerable, then cpl v cpz( V )  is enumer- 
able. 
(1) 
Add a new constant symbol C to the language L(A) and let T be the 

156 
SECOND ORDER NUMBER THEORY 
set of sentences: 
T = Th(A,) u {l O(C): O(V) is enumerable). 
We claim that 
cp(C) is consistent with Tif and only if cp(V) is not enumerable. (2) 
Obviously, if q ( V )  is enumerable then q(C) is inconsistent with T. 
Conversely suppose cp(C) is inconsistent with T, i.e. T!= 7 
cp(C). For 
some enumerable formulas el( V ) ,  . . ., e,(V), we have 
T ~ ( A , ) , ~ B ~ ( C ) ,  
..., le,(c), 
vw 
A, c: 
e , ( v ) A  . . . A 
e,(v) 
-+ 
v(V>, 
A, 1 c p ( ~ )  
-, e,(v) v. . . v e,(v). 
Then 
whence 
By (l), Q,(V) v . . . v On( V )  is enumerable, whence cp( V )  is enumerable. 
This proves (2). 
It follows that 
T is consistent. 
(3 1 
For if Tis inconsistent then by (2) the formula V = Vis enumerable, and 
A, I= (3 U)(VV)(3X)( v = UJ. 
A, k (W)(Vx)(x E v- 1 
x E U,). 
But using comprehension, 
The above two formulas contradict each other. We conclude that (3) 
holds. (This is essentially Cantor's proof that 2" is uncountable). 
Next we prove 
If (3y)cp(Cy) is consistent with T then for some n < W ,  cp(cn) 
is consistent with T. 
(4) 
To prove (4), assume that for all n < w, T k 
cp(Cn). By (2), for 
each n, cp( Vn) is enumerable, thus 
A, k ( ~ u ) ( v v ) ( ~ ( v ~ )  
-+ (3x)V = Ux). 

281 
SECOND ORDER NUMBER THEORY 
157 
Since A is an o-model, 
A, I= ( V Y > ( W ( V ~ ) ( C p ( ~ Y )  
+ (3x)V = Q. 
A, c ( w v Y ) ( ~ v ) ( C p ( V Y )  
+ (3X)V = (k),). 
A, b (3W)(VX, Y)(U,), = W2’3Y. 
(3W)(VY)(VV)(Cp(VY) -+ (3X)V = %w), 
By the choice scheme, 
But using comprehension, 
Thence 
A, 
and 
A, c (3W)(VY)(VV)(Cp(VY) 
-+ (3z)V = WZ), 
whence 
4 4  b (T(VV)((~Y)Cp(VY) 
+ (3z)V = WZ)). 
This shows that (3y)~p(l/Y) 
is enumerable, and by (2), T b 1 
(3y)q(Cy). 
Therefore (4) holds. 
Using the Omitting Types Theorem (modified to second order logic), we 
see that Thas a model (B,, C )  satisfying the infinite formula (Vx) V,,, 
x 
= n. Thus 23 is an o-model, and A < B. For each D E A, the formula 
V = D is enumerable, so TI= 
C = D. It follows that C E B-A. We 
have shown that: 
Every countable w-model of second order number theory with 
choice has a proper elementary extension which is an o-model. (5) 
Using (5) o1 times and taking unions of the elementary chain at limit 
ordinals, we obtain an uncountable o-model B > A. The proof of (i) is 
complete. 
PROOF 
OF (ii): Let S = u,<, 
S, where each S, is a closed set. Then each 
S,, can be written in the form S, = nm<, 
S,, where each S,, is a basic 
closed set. A basic closed set P is determined by a condition 
V E  P c-, $(V) 
where $(V) is a finite Boolean combination of formulas of the type

n E  V. We wish to show that the theory has an o-model in which the 
infinite sentence 
( V X )  A 
V -1 X E S , ,  
n<m m < m  
holds. We claim that 
For every sentence (3X)(p(CX) consistent with T and every 
n < o, 
there is an m < o such that (3X)(rp(CX) A 1 
X E Smn) 
is consistent with T. 
(6) 
To prove (6) suppose that for all m < o, 
T k i 
( 3 x ) ( ( p ( c x )  A 1 
x E s,,). 
Then for all m, the formula 
( ~ X ) ( ( P ( V X )  
A 1 
X E s m n )  
is enumerable. In number theory there is a definable way of associating 
a natural number with each finite sequence of natural numbers, and hence 
with each basic closed set. Thus there is a formula +(nX) such that for 
each n, 
AA C Il/(nX) t* X E the nth basic closed set. 
Using the axiom of comprehension, the set 
W = { n  E o: 
( ~ X ) ( ( P ( V X ) A  $(nX)) is enumerable) 
belongs to A. Moreover, for each m < o, 
S,,,, is the pZh basic closed set 
for some p E W. 
Using the choice scheme, the formula 
( 3 4  bJ E W A  (3X)((PW) A 1 
WX))I 
( 3 X ) [ C p ( W A  ( W ( U  E WA 1 
WX))I, 
(7) 
or 
can be shown to be enumerable. But since A n S = 0, A n S, = 0, 
whence 
A, k (3U)(U E WA i 
$'(Ux)). 
It follows that the formula (7) is equivalent in AA to 

281 
SECOND ORDER NUMBER THEORY 
159 
which is therefore enumerable. Thus (3X)(p(CX) is inconsistent with T, 
and (6) holds. 
Using (3), (4), and (6) with the Omitting Types Theorem we see that T 
has an o-model in which (VX)A,,, 
V,,, 
X E  
S,, holds. Then using 
an elementary chain of length ol we obtain the desired uncountable 
o-model B > A such that B n S = 0. i 
Part (i) of the theorem answers a question of H. Friedman.

A three cardinal theorem 
We shall prove a three-cardinal theorem for the language L,. 
Suppose 
throughout that Ld is a countable fragment of L,,,, and that U, V are 
one-placed relation symbols. We say that 91 = ( A ,  U, V, . . .) is a model 
of type ( K ,  A, p) iff JAl = K ,  IUI = A, IVI = p.

(i) T has a model of type (wl, wl, w )  in which there is an infinite set of 
indiscernibles over U. 
(ii) For all I 2 wl, T admits (I, wl, 0).

Then T* satisfies the hypotheses. Hence

A THREE CARDINAL THEOREM 
161 
T* has a model B* of type (wl, ol, 
o) with an infinite set of indiscern- 
ibles over U. By the problems in Lecture 17 concerning indiscernibles in 
uncountable languages, T* admits (A, ol, 
o), 
whence T does also. 
Proof of (i): For this proof we shall need a slight generalization of 
Theorem 28 (Lecture 21). The proof is a simple adjustment of that of 
Theorem 28. 
THEOREM 
28’. Let B = ( A ,  R, U‘, . . .) be a countable model such that 
R is a transitive, irreflexive relation on U‘. For any formula cp of L,,, 
let 
(3 arb. large x)cp = (Vz)( U’(z) + (3x)(zRx A q)), 
where z does not occur in q. Let La be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
Then the following are equivalent: 
(i’) There exists ‘23 >La % such that 
(U& , R,) is a strong end extension of (U’, R). 
(ii’) There is a ‘23 
B such that 
(U;, 
R g )  is a strong end extension of (U‘, R )  and U, has power 
W1. 
(iii’) Each of the following are valid in 8: 
(a’) (t’y, z)( U’(y) A V ( z )  + (3x)(yRx A zRx)). 
(b’) (3 arb. large x)V,<, On -, V,,, 
(3 arb. large .)On, 
where 
(c’) (3 arb. large x)(3y)(q A U’(y)) + (3y)(3 arb. large x)(q A U’(y)) 
We leave the proof of Theorem 28’ to the reader. One simply ‘relati- 
V n < ,  en E La* 
v (3 arb. large y)(3x)(q A U’(y)). 
vizes’ things to U‘. 
Now we give the proof of (i). We may assume without loss of generality 
that T 1 (Vx)( V(x) + U(x)). Otherwise replace U(x) by U(x) v V(X). 
Now add a new one-placed relation U‘ and binary relation R to L, 
forming LL. Let T‘ be the set of all sentences of L‘‘ 
of the forms (a’), 
(b’), (c‘) of Part (iii) of Theorem 28’, plus 
(VX>((V(X) 
+ U’(X>) 
A ( U ’ W  -, W

R linearly orders U‘, 
V is an initial segment of ( U ’ ,  R).

A THREE CARDINAL THEOREM 
~9 
For each a < ol, 
the theory T' admits ( ~ J K ) ,  K, p', 
p); for we may 
take a model of Tof type (3=(~), 
K, p), choose U' such that V c U' c U 
and U' has power p+, and let R be a well-ordering of U' of order type 
p', 
thus getting a model of T'. By Theorem 23 part (i), T' has a countable 
model 58 = ( A ,  U, U', V, R) which has an infinite set of indiscernibles 
( X ,  <) over U. Add new constant symbols c,, 
X E  X ,  and let I be the 
set of sentences of LL({c,: x E X } )  stating that the c,'s are indiscernible 
over U. Let T" = T' u I. Then in the new language Lz({c,: x E X } ) ,  
all the sentences of the forms (a'), (b'), (c') are consequences of T", be- 
cause they are all obtained from formulas of type (a')-(c') 
of LL by re- 
placing free variables by the new constants. Therefore by Theorem 28', 
there is an elementary extension BX of '$Xx such that (U;, RB) is an end 
extension of (U', 
R )  of power wl. Thus the model 93 is of type (a1, 
wl, 
ol, 
o) 
and in this model ( X ,  <) is an infinite set of indiscernibles over 
U. The reduct of 2.3 to the original language L is thus a model satisfying 
the required conditions for (i). (The set VB is the same as V because I/ is 
an initial segment of (U', 
R)). -I 
The analogue of Theorem 40 for first order logic is due to VAUGHT 
[ 19651, the present Three-Cardinal Theorem 40 was announced in 
KEISLER [ 19671. 
Like the two-cardinal theorems, the Three-Cardinal Theorem 40 has 
a number of applications. We give two examples here. For both of the

Ld is a

model 2.3 E A  
of type (A, p) is (p, L,)-homogeneous. 
PROOF. Like the proof of Theorem 25 or 32. 
THEOREM 
42. Suppose that for every model 58 E A of power K and every 
countable set X c A, (II realizes at most countably many types of Ld 
over X. Then for every model 2.3 €.A? of power A and every set Y c B 
of power p, 2.3 realizes at most p types over Y. 
PROOF. Like Theorem 34.

End elementary extensions 
which omit a type 
In the next few lectures we shall obtain further results on models of 
power wt for the language L,,,. 
The method of elementary chains makes 
it possible to say much more about models of power w1 than we could say 
about models of larger powers. One of our important tools so far has been 
Theorem 28 on end elementary extensions. We shall now prove a stronger 
version of Theorem 28 which concerns end elementary extensions in 
which countably many types are omitted. The next three results, Theo- 
rems 43-45, are special cases of theorems in KEISLER 
[1970]. 
THEOREM 
43. Let i!l = (A, R, . . .) be a countable model for L such that 
R is a transitive, irreflexive relation on A. Let Ld be a countable fragment 
of L,,,. 
(These are exactly the hypotheses of Theorem 28). Let Q be an 
infinite sentence of the form 
d = A (VX, 2 . . . xp,) v Q,,, 
m<w 
n < o  
where each om, E L,. Suppose 'ill has an elementary end extension with 
respect to L, of power ol. 
Then the following are equivalent: 
(i*) 'ill has a strong end elementary extension 
of power o1 
such that 
Q holds in 23. 
(ii*) For every m < w and every sentence in L,(A) of the form 
where (S) is a string of quantifiers of the types (3u) and (3 arb. large u), if 
'illA != (S)(% 
* * - x p , w  
163 

164 
END ELEMENTARY EXTENSIONS WHICH OMIT A TYPE 
then there exists n < w such that 
I= (S)(3x1 * . - xp,,,)($ 
A Cmn). 
NOTE: Condition (ii) is similar to the condition in the Omitting Types 
Theorem, except that the string of quantifiers (S) is present. 
PROOF 
OF THEOREM 
43. We shall rely heavily on results already establish- 
ed during the proof of Theorem 28. The direction (i) => (ii) will not be 
needed in the sequel, so we only give a bare outline of its proof. First, 
using the proof of Theorem 28 we see that the model 23 may be chosen so 
that a class of 23 is unbounded with respect to R if and only if it has power 
w l .  Then (ii) is proved by induction on the length of the string (S). 
(ii) => (i): Let T be the set of sentences introduced in the proof of 
Theorem 28. It is in the language Ld(A u {d}). Let cp be the ‘end ex- 
tension’ sentence 
CP = A (VY> V (Y = e,veaRy) 
a d  
beA 
of that proof. It suffices to show that T u {cp, o} has an uncountable 
model. Actually, it is enough to show that T u {cp} has a model (BA, d )  
such that condition (ii*) holds for 23. For then we may repeat the process 
o1 
times. By Theorem 28, any model of Thas an end elementary extension 
of power wl. The condition (ii*) obviously passes over limit ordinals, and 
thus we will have an uncountable model of T u {cp} for which (ii*) holds. 
It is obvious that any model for which (ii*) holds is a model of o, because 
in (ii*) we may take $ to be the formula x1 = a, A .  . . A  xp, = upm for 
any p,-tuple u1 , . . ., up,,, of elements of the model. 
The condition (ii*) itself can be expressed by an infinite sentence of the 
form 
e = A (vx, . . . xqm) v emn, 
eO(Y1 
* 
YqJ 4 ( Y ,  - * 
YqJ’ - - * 
0, = (S)(% 
* * - x,)9,. 
m<W 
n<w 
where Om, E L,. 8 can be described as follows. Fix m c w. Let 
be a list of all formulas of the fragment L, of the form 

301 
END ELEMENTARY EXTENSIONS WHICH OMIT A TYPE 
165 
Let 8" be the infinite formula 
Finally, let 
8 = A 8". 
m < m  
Then a model 23 satisfies (ii*) if and only if 23 is a model of 8. 
In Theorem 28 it was shown that T is consistent, and the condition (2) 
was vtrified so that the Omitting Types Theorem could be used to show 
that T v {cp} has a model. We now show that in addition 
If m < o, 
r < o, (3yl . . . y& 
is a sentence of L,(A u {d}) 
which is consistent with T, then either 
(3Yl 
* * Yq,)bA 1 
or> 
is consistent with T, or else there is an n < o such that 
( 3 ~  
1 * * * yq,)[x A (S)('X~ * * * xp,,,)(+r A ~ m n ) l  
is consistent with T. 
(2' ) 
We need the fact from the proof of Theorem 28 that 
x(d) is consistent with Tiff %A C (3 arb. large x)n(x). 
( 5 )  
To prove (2'), suppose (3y1 . . . y,)x(d) is consistent with T, but 
T c 
(3yl . . . yqj(+) 
A 
e r ) .  
Then 
T 1 n(d) + (S)(3xl . . . x ~ , ) $ ~ .  
Using (5), 
%A I= (3 arb. large x)(3yl . . . yq,)x(x), 
whence using (6), 
%A k (3 arb. large x)(3yl . . . y,J(S)(3x1 . . . xp,)(n(x) A +r). 

166 
END ELEMENTARY EXTENSIONS WHICH OMIT A TYPE 
Putting 
(S‘) = (3 arb. large x)(3y1 . . . yqp)(S), 
we have 
% b (s 
. . . x,,)(+) 
A 
Then using the assumption that (ii*) holds for %, we have some n < o 
such that 
(s’)(3x1 - * xpm)(4x> A $r A urnn). 
Using (5) again we conclude that 
( 3 ~ 1  
* - * Yq)(S)(gx, - - - xpm)(n(4 A $r A cmn) 
is consistent with T, whence 
(33’1 - * * y q J [ 4 4  A (S)(3x1 * - . Xp,)($r 
A 0m)l 
is consistent with T. This proves (2‘). 
Now using (2) and (2’) and the consistency of T, we see by the Omitting 
Types Theorem that T u {cp, d} has a model. By our previous remarks, this 
completes the proof. -I 
In the above theorem, the string of quantifiers ( S )  was needed in order 
to have a condition (ii*) which would continue to hold in some countable 
end extension of a, so that a chain of length o1 
could be formed. Notice 
that in the proof of Theorem 43, the condition (ii*) was used in the given 
model 8 with a longer string (S’) in order to show that (ii*) holds in a 
new model 8 with the string (S). 
We shall give some applications of Theorem 43. In what follows we 
shall say that a model 8 = { A ,  R, . . .> and language L, are an end 
extension pair iff they satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 43, that is, 
8 is countable; 
R is a transitive irreflexive relation over A ;  
L, is a countable fragment of L,,,; 
8 has an end elementary extension in L, of power ol.

By Theorem 28, 

31 
Models of power q 
It was shown by EHRENFEUCHT 
and MOSTOWSKI 
[1956] that in first 
order logic, every P c d  class A? which has infinite models has a model 
!XK of each infinite power K such that only countably many types in 
L are realized in aK. 
This is an easy consequence of their result that 
JZ has a model with an infinite set of indiscernibles and ot the Stretching 
Theorem. For a countable fragment L, 
we have the following weaker 
results. For both of them assume 
is a P c d  class over L,,, 
and L, is 
a countable fragment: 
1. If A has a model of power 2 a", then for each cardinal K 2 o 
JZ has a model of power K which realizes only countably many types in 
L,. 
(By the Upward LST Theorem). 
2. If A has a model of power > 2" then .A has a model of power o1 
which realizes only countably many types in L,. (Theorem 33). 
The above result is not true if we assume only that A has an uncount- 
able model. For example let L, 
= L and let .A be the PC, class over L,,, 
composed of all models isomorphic to o-models of second order number 
theory. Then every uncountable model of A7 realizes uncountably many 
types, and in fact 4 has no models of power > 2" but does have models 
of power 2". 
The next theorem gives a weaker conclusion then Theorem 33 under 
the assumption that .A has an uncountable model. 
168

MODELS OF POWER 0 1  
I69 
THEOREM 
44. Let L, 
be a countable fragment of L,,, 
and let A be a 
PC, class over La,, which has at least one uncountable model. Then the 
set of all types in L, which are realized in all uncountable models in A? 
is countable. 
PROOF. Let T’ be a countable set of sentences in a language L,,, 
such 
that A is the class of all reducts to L of models of T‘. Then T‘ has an 
uncountable model, hence a model B’ of power wl. 
Let R be a well-order- 
ing of B of order type (w, , < ). Let L,, be a fragment which is countable, 
contains L,, 
and contains all sentences in T’ and in the first order 
language of (B’,R). Then there is a countable model (%‘,R’) 
XLd 
(B’, R) such that (B’, R) is an end extension of (a’, I?). (To get (W, 
R’), 
first take a countable elementary submodel (ao, R,) of (B’, R), then 
extend it to a countable elementary submodel containing the initial seg- 
ment of (23, R) generated by a,, and repeat o times). 
Then (a’, R’) 
and L,, form an end extension pair, and a’ is a model of 
T‘. Let X be the set of all types in L, which are realized in every uncount- 
able model of A. 
We show X is countable. 
Suppose Z = C(u, . . . up) belongs to X. Then the sentence 
(VU, . . .up) v 1 0  
aEZ 
is not true in any uncountable elementary end extension of (a’, R’) 
relative to Ld,. This means that condition (ii*) fails. That is, there is a 
sentence 
0, = (S)(3U, * * * u,>h 
of L,,(A’) such that (a;,, 
R’) k 0, and for all o E C, 
We claim that 
If C(u, . . . up), T(ul . . . up) E X and X # r, then 0, # 0,. 
(1) 
For suppose C, r E X and 0, = Or, C # r. Then there must be a formula 

170 
MODELS OF POWER 0 1  
and the fact that the quantifiers (3) 
and (3 arb. large x) commute with 
disjunction, we see that either (2) or (3) must fail. This contradiction 
proves (1). 
Since the language Ldt is countable, and by (1) there is a one-one map- 
ping of X into the set of formulas of L,. , we conclude that Xis countable. 
The proof is complete. -I 
The next theorem shows that if 4 has fewer than the maximum num- 
ber of non-isomorphic models of power w1 , the conclusion of Theorem 44 
can be strengthened. 
THEOREM 
45. Let Ld be a countable fragment of L,,, 
and let A? be a 
PC, class over L,,,. 
If A? has fewer than 2"' nonisomorphic models of 
power o, , then every model in A? realizes only countably many types in 
Equivalently, if A! has a model which realizes 2 o, types in L,, 
then 
Ld * 
JZ has exactly 2"' models of power w, , up to isomorphism. 
PROOF. 
Let T' be a countable set of sentences of L$,, such that A? is 
the class of all reducts of models of T'. Assume A? has a model 23 which 
realizes 2 w, types in L,. 
Then we may assume 58 has power ol. 
For 
somep < o, 23 realizes o, types in L, withp variables, say 
C , ( V l  
* * * up), < 0 1 .  
Let 23' be an expansion of 23 to a model of T'. Add the following new 
functions and relations to 23': 
A well-ordering R of B of order type w,; 
A one-one function F of BP onto B; 

311 
MODELS OF POWER 0 1  
171 
A set U c B of power o1 
such that for each u < w1 there isaunique 
b,, . . ., b, such that B t. &[b1 . . . b,] and F(bl . . . b,) E U; 
A function G mapping U one-one onto B. 
Form the model 
B" = (%', R, F, U, G). 
This model satisfies the infinite sentence 
( v U 1  . . . U , U l  . . . U , ) [ ( U ( F ( U 1  . . . U , ) ) A  u(F(U1 . . . Up)) 
A A b ( U 1  . . . U , ) * b ( U ,  
. . .Up)) 
U 1  = U1 A . . A U p  = Up]. (1) 
This sentence states that each type in Ld is satisfied by at most onep-tuple 
whose F-image is in U. Let L:,, 
be a countable fragment containing Ld, 
T', all sentences of the first order language L" of B", and the sentence (1). 
By Theorem 28, any countable model W' iLPrd,, 
Bft has an elementary 
end extension in EL.. of power o1 , hence 8", 
L'& is an end extension pair. 
Let 
U E L ~  
8 6  -&#, Bf'. 
Consider the binary tree of length w1 , 
T =  u "2, 
a < m i  
with the ordering s 5 t iff s is an initial segment of t for s, t E T. The two 
successors of s in Tare denoted by SO and sl . 
We shall construct models 8, and types Z,(ul . . . up) in Ld for each 
s E T, with the following properties (where 
is as above): 
If s < t then 
is an end elementary extension of '2IS in EL,, . 
(2) 
Each as 
is countable. 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
For all s 6 t, at realizes the type Zs. 
If s < t and si $ 1, then !I& 
has an end elementary extension in 
Ls., of power w1 which omits ZSi (i E (0, 11). 
For example, the first few points of the tree are:

Zol, 
for instance, realizes the types Z+, Zo, Zol 
but has end elementary 
extensions of power w1 omitting Z1 and Zoo. 
Suppose we have succeeded in constructing the a, and Z,. The three has 
2"' branches S E"' 2. For each branch S, let 
23s = (J as. 
s<s 
Since Bs 
is a union of an elementary chain of proper extensions of length 
w, and each a, is countable, Bs is an elementary extension of a, 
of 
power 0,. Moreover, the reduct of Bs 
to L' is a model of T', so the reduct 
BslL of Bs 
to L is a member of A. Let S, S' ~ " ' 2  
and S # S'. Then there 
is a least CI such that S(a) # S'(a), say S(a) = 0 and S'(CI) = 1. Let 
s = Sla = S'la. Then 
so < s, sl < 9, sl $ s, so g S'. 
By (4), BS realizes Zso and Bs, 
realizes Z,, . By (5), every as for s < S 
omits Z,, , hence BS omits Z,, . Similarly Bs, 
omits Zso. Therefore, since 
Zso and C,, are types in L,, 
'%s\L and B,.IL are not isomorphic. This 
shows that A has 2"' non-isomorphic models, of power w,. We note 
that A cannot have more than 2"' non-isomorphic models of power o1 
because there are only 2"' isomorphism types of models of power o1 
altogether.

MODELS OF POWER W1

Thus the theorem will be proved once we show the existence of as, 
Zs 
satisfying (2>-(5). We show this by induction on the length of s. Suppose 
we already have constructed C,, 
'$Is satisfying (2)-(5) for all s E T of 
length less than u (given an c1 < ol). 
CASE 1. c1 is a limit ordinal. For each t of length a, define at = 
us<, 
a, and let Cf be any type realized by $!If. Then (2), (3), and (4) Gb- 
viously hold. (5) also holds because of Corollary 2 in the preceding lec- 
ture. 
CASE 2. c1 = 0. Let C, be any type realized in the given model $!I4. 
CASE 3. c1 = j + 1. Let s be of length j, 
s E T. We show how to choose 
S?llso, aSl, 
C,, 
, Csl . Let Bo >L"d,, as0 
be an end elementary extension of 
power w1 which omits Cri whenever r c s and ri & s. B0 
exists by Corol- 
lary 1 of the last lecture. 
Because of the function G, the set U in Bo has power ol, 
hence by the 
sentence (I), there are w1 types in L, 
realized in B0 . Consider the PC, 
class A" over L,,, 
of all reducts to L of models isomorphic to end 
elementary extensions in L;,, of as. 
By Theorem 44, only countably many 
types in L, are realized in all models in A" of power ol. 
Hence there 
exists a type Zso in L, which is realized in Bo but is omitted in some model 
BIIL EAT" of power ol. 
This model is the reduct of an end elementary 
extension B1 in Li.. 
of as, 
and Bl has power w l .  Now let lYso be a count- 
able end elementary extension of %, such that as0 
realizes Cso and 
Then qs0 
has end elementary extensions of power w1 omitting each type 
C,i where r < s, ri F s. By Corollary 1 we may assume that Bl not only 
omits Zso but also omits each type Cri where r c s and ri F s. Arguing as 
before, B1 realizes w1 types in Ld, hence there exists a type Csl in L, 
which is realized in Bl but is omitted in some end elementary extension Q 
of S?lso of power w l .  Let aSl be a countable end elementary extension of 
lY, which realizes Csl 
and with 
a s  <L"&" as1 <L"# Bl * 
Then as0 
, Zso , ?Is1, Zsl 
satisfy all the conditions (2)-(5). 
The proof is 
complete. i 

174 
MODELS OF POWER W1 
REMARK. Notice that the notion of an end extension did not enter into 
the statements of the last two theorems. However, they were essential in 
the proofs in order to give a method of taking proper elementary exten- 
sions o1 times. Theorem 45 gives a new result even for first order logic. 
In the case of first order logic it can be stated more simply because of the 
Compactness Theorem. 
COROLLARY. 
Any complete theory Tin L which has uncountably many 
types has exactly 2"' models of power o1 
up to isomorphism. 
It is an open question whether the above corollary holds wlth o1 
re- 
placed everywhere by 2" (without the continuum hypothesis). It is known 
that if T has uncountably many types then it has 2" types (equivalently, a 
countable Boolean algebra with an uncountable Stone space has Stone 
space of power 2"). The following example shows that the corollary fails 
for almost all cardinals K > 2". 
EXAMPLE. 
Let L have one-placed relations Roy R, , R2, . . . only. Let T 
be the theory of all models l!l such that each consistent finite Boolean 
combination of the R,'s is infinite in l!l. Then T has 2" types. For each 
infinite cardinal A 5 2", T has 2A non-isomorphic models of power A. 
However for cardinals N, > 2", T has lct12w non-isomorphic models of 

311 
MODELS OF POWER Wt 
175 
power 8,. For a model is determined by the number of elements in each 
of the 2" types. E.g. T has just 2'- models of power 22m, etc. 
EXAMPLE. 
The theory of dense linear order has just countably many types 
but still has 2"' non-isomorphic models of power ol. 
(However if count- 
ably many individual constants are added then the resulting theory has 2" 
types). Thus the converse of the above corollary fails. 
The problem of finding a necessary and sufficient condition for a first 
order complete theory to have 2"' non-isomorphic models of power o1 
is open. 

32 
Ultrapowers 
Up to this point in the course we have made use of three main methods 
The Henkin construction and Model Existence Theorem; 
Skolem functions and indiscernibles; 
Elementary chains. 
of constructing models in the study of infinitary logic: 
All of these constructions are also of basic importance in first order mod- 
el theory. 
There is one more method of constructing models which is basic to 
first order model theory but has not yet been used at all in this course, 
namely the ultraproduct construction. As a matter of fact, there is a way 
to use the ultraproduct construction in L,,,, and several of the results 
we have proved were first discovered using ultraproducts. In first order 
model theory ultraproducts can always be used as a substitute for the 
Compactness Theorem and there are many results whose only reasonable 
proofs use ultraproducts. (For a survey and historical account see KEISLER 
[1967a].) However, in the model theory of L,,, ultraproducts can only 
occasionally be used as a substitute for the Model Existence Theorem, 
and there are very few results to date whose only good proof uses ultra- 
products. For this reason we have chosen a treatment of the subject 
which emphasizes the Model Existence Theorem in preference to ultra- 
products. 
We shall now describe an ultraproduct construction appropriate 
L,,, . Its theory is not yet in a satisfactory state of development, but we 
will be able to prove some results which indicate that there ought to 
179 

180 
ULTRAPOWERS 
be things that can be done in L,,, 
using ultraproducts which cannot be 
done in other ways. We presuppose a knowledge of ultraproducts in 
first-order logic. 
In the following let L, 
be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
If q ( x ) ~  
L,(B) and '$3 is a model, recall that the set 
q(%) = { b  E B :  BB C q [ b ] }  
is called a class of 23. Similarly, if q(x, y )  E L,(B) 
and BE 
k q ( x ,  y )  A 
q ( x ,  z )  + y = z, then the partial function FQB defined by 
FqB(b) = c iff BE 
k q[b, c] 
is called a definable function of '$3. The domain of the function FQB is the 
class 
((3Y)rp)W. 
If necessary for clarity we may add the phrase 'with respect to L,' 
to 
the above two definitions, and say 'class in 23 w.r. L,' 
or 'definable 
function in '$3 w.r. Ld'. 
DEFINITION. 
Let ~ ( ' $ 3 )  be a class in 23 (w.r. Ld). '$3 is said to be SkoIem 
over q(w.r. L,) iff for every formula $(x, y )  E L,(B) there is a definable 
function F$B in 23 (w.r. L,) whose domain is the class q(%) such that for 
all x E q(23), 
BE 
(3y)$(x, y) imp1ies BE 
$(xF$B(x))* 
DEFINITION. 
Suppose 'B is Skolem over q(%) and D is an ultrafilter over 
q(B). The Skolem ultrapower n, '$3 is defined as follows. Let C be the set 
of all definable functions in '$3 with domain ~('$3). Given F#B and 
FOB 
E C, we say that 
F,, 
-DFOBiff {X E (~('$3): FSB(X) = FsB(x)) 
ED. 
For F E  C, let FD be the equivalence class of F under wD. The universe 
set nDB of nD 
'$3 is the set 
nDB = { F D :  F E c}. 
The relations of IlDB are defined as follows: For all F', . . ., F" E C and 

321 
ULTRAPOWERS 
181 
n-ary relation R, 
R,(F;. . . F;) iff {X E ~(113): R(F'(x). . . ~"(x))} 
ED. 
As in the case of ordinary ultraproducts one can check that x D  is an 
equivalence relation and the relations RD are well defined. Functions 
and constants of l7, 8 are treated similarly. This defines the model nDB. 
The natural embedding of 113 into UD113 is the function d: 113 + nD23 
which maps each b E B to the equivalence class of the constant function 
at b. All the constant functions are obviously definable in 113. The above 
definition is very similar to Skolem's original construction used to get a 
non-standard model of arithmetic. 
DEFINITION. 
Let ~(113) be a class in 113. An ultrafilter D over ~(113) is said 
to be L,-complete

We now prove two theorems which hold for uncountable as well as 
countable models 113. 
THEOREM 
46 (THE FUNDAMENTAL 
THEOREM). 
Let ~ ( 2 3 )  
be a class in 113, 
let 113 be Skolem over ~(113) (both w.r. L,), and let D be an L,-complete 
ultrafilter over ~(23). (i) Then for all formulas +(xl . . . X,)E L, and 
all definable functions F', . . ., F" in 113 (w.r. Ld), with domain cp(B), 
we have 
I I D B  c + [ F A . .  . F;S] iff{x E ~(8):

(ii) The natural embedding d is elementary, 
d :  113 <Ld IZDB. 
(iii) d is a proper embedding iff D is non-principal. 
PROOF. The proof is similar to the result in first order logic, proceeding 
by induction on the complexity of formulas. We give only the two parts of 
the induction which differ from the first order proof. 
Assuming the theorem holds for +(xOxl . . . xn), we prove it for

domain cp(23). Suppose that 
{ x  E (~(23): 8 I: (3xo)$[F'(x). . . F"(x)]} ED. 
(1) 
Let b, . . . b, be all the constants occurring in cp and in the definitions of 
F', . . ., F". Then there is a formula B(xx,b, . . . b,) 
E L,(B) such that 
for all x and xo in B, 
23 I: $ [ x o ~ ' ( x ) .  . . ~ " ( x ) ]  
iff 23 b e[xxo b, . . . b,]. 
Since 23 is Skolem over cp(23) there is a definable function F o  in 8 with 
domain (~(23) such that for all x E cp(23), 
8 c ( ~ x , ) $ [ F ' ( x ) .  . . ~ " ( x ) ]  
implies 23 I: $[F'(x). . . ~ " ( x ) ] .  
It follows that 
{ x  E cp(23): 23 I: $ [ F o ( x ) .  . . F"(x)]} ED, 
whence by hypothesis 
and so

The above theorem easily generalizes to the richer infinitary

EXAMPLE. 
If D is a countably complete ultrafilter then D is L,-complete 
for every d, whence we always have 23 <Ld IID23. In fact, 23 <Lmlo, 
II, 23 where IZDB is the usual ultrapower, and even stronger results hold.

(i) There exists an elementary extension 0. 
23 such that ~(0.)-

(ii) There exists a non-principal L,-complete ultrafilter D over cp(B). 
PROOF. (ii) implies (i) by the Fundamental Theorem above. 
Assume (i). Let c E q(0.)-q(23). Let E be the set of all classes below: 
E = {$(23): $@) c (~(23) and c E $(&)}. 
Then E has the finite intersection property and hence can be extended 
to an ultrafilter D over ~(23). D is non-principal because for each 
b E q(B), we have 
whence 
c E (. 
z b A cp(x))(0.>, 
( x  # b A q(x))(%) = ~(23)- {b} E D. 
To show D is L,-complete, let

pose that for each n < w,

Then since the FA are definable in 23, we have

Ultrapowers of models of set theory 
In this lecture we give an application of the ultrapower to models of 
set theory. For simplicity we shall consider models of first order logic, but 
we shall see in the next lecture that the results can be used to give informa- 
tion about models of L,. 
Suppose L has among its relations the binary relation E. We shall 
denote by Z the Zermelo set theory formulated in terms of E. A model 
23 = (By E, . . .) for L is said to be a model of Z iff <B, E )  is a model 
of Z. Suppose 23 is a model of Z and b E B. We say that 23 satisfies choice 
over b iff for every formula q(x, y )  in L(B), we have 
BE k (3f) Gf is a function with domain b A ((3y)cp ( x y )  + cp(x,f(x)))]. 
Recalling an earlier definition, if a, b E B we say that b is regular over a iff 
the formula 1x1 2 161 is regular over the formula lyl 5 lal, i.e., 
8 k If 1x1 2 lbl, Iyl 6 la], g is a function with domain y, and 
x = u 
M Z )  : z EY}, then (32 Ey)lg(Z)I 2 PI. 
We recall that in Theorem 36 we proved the following (but with b and 
Let 23 be a countable model of Z. Suppose that a, b E By b is regular over 
a replaced by classes ~ ( 2 3 )  
regular over t+b(%)): 
a, and 
k lbl 2 2 A  IQI 2 2. 
Then there is an elementary extension Q = (C, F, . . .) of 23 such that a 
is fixed and lbFl = ol.

ULTRAPOWERS OF MODELS OF SET THEORY 
[33 
Theorem 36 was stated only for the case where 23 = (B, E )  with no 
additional relations, but the proof also holds in case 23 = (B, E, . . .) 
is a model of Z in which the axiom of subsets holds for all formulas of L. 
Using ultrapowers we now prove a similar result in which the hypothesis 
that 23 is a model of Z for L is replaced by assuming 23 satisfies choice 
over b, and the hypothesis that 23 is countable is weakened to the as- 
sumption that a certain part of % is countable. The main interest in the 
theorem is that in certain cases it allows us to handle uncountable models. 
THEOREM 
48. Let 23 = (B, E, . . .) be a model of Z and let a, b E B. 
Assume: 
23 satisfies choice over b; 
23 k Ib x bl = Ibl A Ibl 2 2 A la1 2 2; 
b is regular over a; 
lcEl = w where 23 1 c = ba. 
Then there is an elementary extension 0. > 8, 0. = (C, F, . . .), such that 
and 
a is fixed, i.e. aF = aE, 
IbFl = wl* 
PROOF. We first observe that since 93 satisfies choice over b, 8 i s  Skolem 
over the class b,. Moreover, the definable functions Fin 23 with domain 
b, correspond to the elements f E B where 
23 1 f is a function with domain b. 
We shall therefore speak about thef’s instead of the F’s. 
the formula 
Let L, be the smallest countable fragment of L,,,(B) 
which contains 
A X x Z d .  
Since cE is countable and 23 k la1 5 IcI, we see that a, is countable, hence 
the above conjunction is countable. We claim that 
dEa 
There exists a non-principal L,-complete ultrafilter D over 6,. (1) 
To prove (1) we begin by making an enumeration 
cE = i f 0  , f l  ,f2 9 * * *>. 

33 I 
ULTRAPOWERS OF MODELS OF SET THEORY 
187 
Using the regularity of b over a, we may choose a sequence 
e, , e, , e, , . . . E B 
such that for each n < w, 
B 'F (en+l c en c b A le,J = ( b (  r\f,le,, is constant). 
We take for D any ultrafilter over b, which contains all the sets en,, 
n < w. D is non-principal because for each d E b, there is an fn which is 
the characteristic function of {d) in 8, 
hence en must not contain d. 
We must now show that D is L,-complete. That is, we must show that 
for everyfe B such that SB 
'F (fis a function with domain b), 
If for all dEu, {xEb: 'BE k f ( x )  # d )  ED, 
then 
(xEb: %B 'F Af(x) # d }  ED. 
dEa 
This is equivalent to showing: 
If {xEb: BE 
k f ( x )  E a }  E D then for some dEa, 
{XEb: 'BB 'Ff(x) = d )  ED. 
Suppose 
{XEb: B B  'Ff(x) E U }  E D .  
Let g be such that in B, 
g(x) = f ( x )  whenf(x) E a, and g E 
Then g = fn for some n. Hence in 23, glen is constant, say with the value 
dEa. Then in '23, f ( x )  = d whenever x E en and f ( x )  = g(x), It follows 
that 
{ x E b : f ( x )  = din %} ED, 
and (2) holds. Thus (1) is verified. 
Applying (1) we form the ultrapower n,S. We have by the fundamen- 
tal theorem that d: B < Ld IZ, B, and the elementary embedding enlarges 
b. It also leaves a fixed because 
BB 'F (Vx)(x E a --f 1 
A x # d), 
dEa

[33 
hence IID8 also satisfies the above sentence of LJB). Thus IIDB r 0; 
for some elementary extension Q > B which leaves a fixed and enlarges 
b. Finally, we note that 
lCFl = 0. 
(3) 
This is because each element of cF corresponds to an element of IIDB 
which is an equivalence class of an elementfE B such that 
BB kfis a function on b into c, 
that is, 
But 
BB k f E  ’((”a). 
BB k Ib((”a)I = Ibxbal = I b a1 = Ic( 
because by hypothesis 
B B  k Ibx bl = Ib(. 
Therefore, since c, is countable, there are only countably many such f. 
This proves (3). 
By (3) we see that the model 0. satisfies all the hypotheses of the 
theorem. It follows that we may repeat the construction w1 times and 
form an elementary chain Ba, a < w1 such that Bo = B and at each 
step a is fixed and b is enlarged. The hypotheses of the theorem obviously 
are preserved by union of countable elementary chains, so we define 
Ba = UBXu 
BBwhenais alimit ordinal < wI. 
TheunionQ = uu<ol 
Ba 
is then the desired elementary extension of B. -I 
REMARK. The theorem can be easily generalized by replacing a by a 
countable collection a,, n < 0, 
of elements of B. Theorems 46-48 above 
were announced in a somewhat different form in KEISLER 
[1965].

The Seven Cardinal Theorem 
The two-cardinal result in Theorem 30 (If T admits (K, p) then T 
admits (wl , w)), and the three-cardinal result in Theorem 40 were both 
first proved using ultrapowers. Essentially, their original proofs were 
based on Theorem 48. The proofs we have given above based on the 
Model Existence Theorem were discovered later and were preferred here 
because the Model Existence Theorem is a more widely applicable method 
than the ultrapower construction for L,,, . 
The original proof of Theorem 40 (ii), however, is of some independent 
interest and is given below. Let Ld be a countable fragment of L,,,. 
THEOREM 
40 (ii). Let T c Ld be a set of sentences such that for all 
u < w1 there are cardinals K: =- p >= w such that T admits (&(K:), 
K, p). 
Then for all A 2 al, 
T admits (A, wl, 0). 
PROOF USING ULTRAPOWERS. It is understood that the language L has 
two distinguished one-placed relation symbols U and V to which the 
notion of a model of type (a, B, 7) refers. We may assume that 
T != (Vx) V(x) -+ U(x). 
As in Theorem 40 before, we add a new relation U' and the axiom 
vX( V(X) -b 
u ' ( X ) )  A u'(X) -+ (X(u)). 
(&(J4 
K, p+, P) 
(4 ) 
Then T with (4) admits 
for we may take U' of power p+. 
189 

190 
THE SEVEN CARDINAL THEOREM 
13 3 
For each a < w1 we may 'impose' a model of Z o n  the model of 
T u (4) of type 
in the following way. We may form a model 
( L ( K > ,  K, P+7 PI 
Bu = <R(K+), E, &(ti), 
K ,  P+, P, . . -) L,, sat, ~ P ) r p ~ ~ ,  
such that the reduct 
Bi = <&(K), ti, P+, P, - . .> 
is a model of T u (4). The set L, is thus represented by a relation of the 
model and there is a constant for each element of L,. 
The relation sat 
denotes the relation between L, and R ( K + )  such that for each q ( u l  . . . un) 
E L, and x E R(K+), 
sat (cpx) iff x E >,(K)" and 58; t= cp[x]. 
Each Bu 
is a model of the set of sentences T' which is described as fol- 
lows: 
Let the relations of 
correspond to the indicated relation symbols: 
< R ( K + ) ,  E, ~LK), 
K ,  P+, p, - * -, L,, 
sat, cp> 
E w 
UU' v 
L, 
sat cp . 
Then T' has axioms which state: 
Zermelo set theory 
sat(cp, x) for all sentences cp E T, 
U is a set, i.e. (3x)(Vy)(y E x f--r U(y)), 
V is a set and U' is a set and V c U' c U, 
Choice over U', 
U' is regular over V, 
IU'x U'I = IU'I and IU'I 2 2 and IVI 2 2, 
There is a one-one function of L, into V, 
The rules giving the recursive definition of sat for cp E Ld hold. 
All the above axioms of T' are finite except for (*). Let T" be the theory 
with all the axioms of T' plus a new function F and an axiom stating that 
(Qx)(x E Ld4-P v *EL, 
x = cpx 
(*) 

331 
THE SEVEN CARDINAL THEOREM 
191 
F maps W onto the universe. Using the Downward LST Theorem we see 
that T" has a model of type (>=(K), K, p', p) for each CI < w l .  Then 
using Morley's Two-Cardinal Theorem (Theorem 23) we see that T" has 
a model of type (A, w, w, w )  for each 1 2 wl. Call this model 8". 
Moreover, 23'' may also be chosen so that the set "U of all functions in 
23'' from U' into U is countable. 
The reduct B' of this model to the language of T' is then a model of 
T'. Furthermore, the interpretation of Win 23' has power A because of the 
function F of T". By Theorem 48, there is an elementary extension 
6' > B' such that the interpretation of Win 6 has power A, the interpre- 
tation of U' in 6' has power wl, but Vis fixed. Furthermore, 6' is obtain- 
ed as the union Gf an elementary chain of length w1 of models in which the 
interpretation of "U is countable (as in the proof of Theorem 48). There- 
fore the interpretation of U in 6' has power wl. Let 6 be the reduct to L 
of the restriction of B' to W. Then B is a model of type (A, wl, w). 
Since V is fixed and there is a one-one function of Ld into V in B', the 
relation Ld is also fixed by&'. Therefore the infinite sentence (*) holds in 
0.'. It follows by 6' > '23' that 6' is a model of T'. Then we conclude that 
sat has the intended meaning in B', and therefore 0. is a model of T. -I 
Notice that this proof of Theorem 40 proceeded by first getting a model 
of type (A, w, w )  and then extending it to one of type (A, wl, 0). 
The 
other proof we gave first constructed a model of type (a1 
, wl, w )  and 
then extended it to one of type (A, wl, 
0). Thus there seems to be an 
essential difference between the two proofs. 
We conclude with one rather special example of a theorem in L,,, 
whose only known proof uses ultrapowers. It is given not for its own 
sake but as an indication that it is possible to do things in L,,, 
with ultra- 
powers which cannot be done as readily in other ways. 
If d' is admissible let 
(K, 
'd 
(1, v )  
mean that every sentence rp E Ld which admits (K, p) admits ( I ,  v). 
THEOREM 
49 (THE SEVEN CARDINAL 
THEOREM). Let &' be a countable 
admissible set. Suppose that (K, p )  -)& (A, w), and A 2 w1 , p < K. Then

whenever w S a < p, /?(a+) 
p, we have

PROOF. Assume o E d. Let cp E Ls4 admit ( K ,  p, a), say 93 is a model 
of cp of type ( K ,  p, a). Let Ld0 be a countable fragment of L,,, 
such that 
cp E Ld0 and Ldo E d. Imposing a model of set theory on 93 we form 
the model 
The three dots stand for the relations of 93, and K is identified with the 
universe of 8. 
The theory T' of the preceding proof can now be expressed by a single 
sentence cp' of Lb. By hypothesis, the set " + p  of all functions in 93 on a+ 
into 
has power p("+) 5 p, and therefore cp' has a model 8; of power 1 
in which the interpretation of "+p is countable. Then as before there is a 
model B' > 93; of power 1 in which the interpretation of p has power o1 
and the interpretation of a is fixed. Then the reduct Q of B' restricted to 
the interpretation of IC is a model of cp of type (A, ol, 
0). 
The case when o # d is similar. In this case we have d = R(o) so 
Ld is just first order logic. Then in forming the model 8' 
we do not need 
Ld0 and sat. To make sure that the sentence cp' is a single sentence of L, 
we need only make the universe of %' be R(K+ + 1). -I 
The same argument gives the following result in first order logic. 
COROLLARY. 
Suppose that 1 2 wl, p -= K, and every theory Tin L which 
admits ( I C , ~ )  
admits (A,w). Then every theory T in L which admits 
(K, p, a )  admits (A, w1 o), 
whenever
