Abstract
Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE) for Open Science at
scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and
potentially transformative forms of collaboration. It is based on the realizations that (1) the
structured parts of the Web itself can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments
depend on communities, (3) closed environments are limited in their capacity to nurture
thriving communities. Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic
backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary
research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe. By establishing a
central  shared  information  node,  research  data  can  be  linked  and  annotated  into
knowledge. Despite occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant
barriers to broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of
integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances. The
proposed  actions  include  providing  best  practices  and  tools  for  semantic  mapping,
adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration with existing

research environments, and the development of policies for information quality and
interchange. The effectiveness of the actions will be tested in pilot use cases. Unforeseen
barriers will be investigated and documented. We will promote the adoption of Wiki4R by
making it easy to use and integrate, demonstrate the applicability in selected research
domains, and provide diverse training opportunities. Wiki4R leverages the expertise gained
in Europe through the Wikidata and DBpedia projects to further strengthen the established
virtual  community  of  14000  people.  As  a  result  of  increased  interaction  between
professional  science  and  citizens,  it  will  provide  an  improved  basis  for  Responsible
Research and Innovation and Open Science in the European Research Area.

Context
This article describes a research proposal that was submitted on January 14, 2015, to the
European Commission's H2020-EINFRA-2015-1 call for proposals for e-Infrastructures for
virtual  research  environments  (VRE).  Its  main  proposition  was  to  build  this  VRE  by
integrating  research  workflows  with  the  Web  through  Wikidata,  an  existing  open
environment for managing structured information collaboratively across all domains of
human knowledge.
Wikidata is being built entirely using open software and open content, and it had a
community of over 14,000 monthly contributors worldwide at the time, which has since
risen to over 16,000. A VRE built on that basis would thus avoid some of the problems
traditionally plaguing many VREs: software and/ or content that are proprietary and hence
siloed, and a lack of community uptake.
Moreover, Wikidata's public version histories of both content and software (another feature
missing in many VREs) provide for a solid basis for open science, which emerged as a
new priority of the European Commission's research activities (and elsewhere) over the
course of the year.
The project proposed to prototype the integration of Wikidata with a set of workflows that
are either transdisciplinary (e.g. for handling scholarly references) or particular to specific
use cases like chemistry or mineralogy. Apart from project management (WP 1), the
individual workpackages then focused on
•
(WP 2) describing research-relevant concepts (e.g. molecules, chemical reactions
or journal articles) in terms of Wikidata's continuously evolving data model and with
a view to maximize compliance with Web standards;
2
Mietchen D et al.

•
(WP 3) establishing exchange and curation workflows between Wikidata and
external  databases  hosting  information  about  these  concepts  (e.g.  identifier
mapping);
•
(WP 4) using Wikidata content in research workflows (e.g. querying it, or using its
identifiers in research notebooks), including citizen science projects;
•
(WP 5) training, education and outreach around these topics, with a focus on
creating  openly  licensed  educational  materials that  could  be  reused  in  other
contexts.
Several of the activities proposed in the framework of the project have since experienced
progress due to support from different parts of the community. For instance, there are now
several mechanisms to query Wikidata in real-time or nearly so, some of which are using
SPARQL (cf. Task 4.1). This allows, for instance, to get a list of countries ordered by the
number of their cities with a female mayor. Basic support for units is now available too (cf.
Task 2.1), and the integration of bibliographic metadata of scholarly citations (part of Task
3.1) is moving forward.
On the other hand, some of the proposed activities have seen little to no progress over the
year, although we continue to see them as valuable for the community. These include, for
instance, the integration of the European Library's dataset of bibliographic metadata for
books into Wikidata (another part of Task 3.1) or Task 3.3, concerned with
•
identifying potential external data sources suitable for integration with Wikidata and
•
exploring the benefits for data providers to engage in such an open sharing of their
data.
or Task 4.4, which was about
•
involving Wikidata in scientific curation workflows
•
connecting Wikidata with citizen science projects
as well as the reuse of data from the Horizon 2020 Open Data Pilot (part of Task 3.1), or
most of WP 5, e.g. the development of online tutorials and course materials.
Some training events (cf. Task 5.5) have already been organized by the community, e.g. at
the Semantic Web applications and tools for life sciences (SWAT4LS) conference earlier
this month by the Gene Wiki team, whose NIH-supported work on Wikidata had inspired
our Wiki4R proposal and who also received that conference's Best paper prize for their
contribution  "Wikidata:  A  platform  for  data  integration  and  dissemination  for  the  life
sciences and beyond".
Like most of the submissions to this heavily oversubscribed call, our proposal was rejected.
While this may have been appropriate in the context of this specific call (hard to tell, since
there is no public information about which projects were submitted, and why the winning
ones were chosen over the others), we think that the ideas we put into the proposal are still
worth pursuing, and we want to encourage others to build on our proposal to move forward
with the integration of research workflows with Wikidata.

There are some signs that this may indeed be happening: the WikiProject Wikidata for
Research, which was initially started about a year ago in order to facilitate the open and
collaborative drafting of our proposal (including assembling the group of project partners)
has developed into a platform for sharing information at the interface between Wikidata
and research, and about one third of its ca. 50 participants have signed up after our
proposal was submitted. Some of them have, independent of us, explored how medical
content on Wikipedia could benefit from closer integration with scholarly databases through
Wikidata  (similar  to  Task  3.1),  and  published  a  paper about  it,  while  the  Wikimedia
Foundation recently funded a proposed project to mine selected external websites for facts
that could be turned into statements on Wikidata, with the URL of that external site serving
as a reference (similar to Task 3.2). Of note, a number of external websites and services
have started to use Wikidata identifiers in their workflows (cf. Task 4.3), many of them in
the area of cultural heritage (cf. Task 4.5).
In preparing the proposal for publication, we kept as closely as possible to the original text
(which is still available as a preprint on Zenodo) and whose DOI was included in the
original submission. Bothe the preprint and this version are missing the letters of support,
since the logos in the letterheads are under copyright of the respective institutions and
cannot be posted under an open license. Similarly, the reviews cannot be posted here,
since we do not know who has the copyright, and whether they would consent to this
publication. We encourage funders to make it simpler for applicants to share the reviews of
their proposals, and we will update this article should we receive permission to post the
reviews.
Except for adding this Context section, the changes made here were the addition of some
metadata sections (e.g. Keywords, Funding program) and a few copyedits (typos and
making sure all tables and figures are actually cited in the text). We also added an
Acknowledgements section and dropped Anonymous as co-author in order to comply with
journal policy.

Objectives
The overarching goals of the proposed project are:
1.
To  support  the  application  of  Open  Science  principles  by  leveraging  and
strengthening  an  existing  trusted,  shared,  long-term-sustainable,  collaborative
platform for the curation of open data.
2.
To enable researchers across Europe and beyond to perform transdisciplinary
research, overcoming the fragmentation of virtual research environments (VREs)
and separated data silos by moving to an open, shared data environment with
collaborative data curation.
3.
To  support  increasingly  rich  interlinking  of  information  and  digital  knowledge
representations that can be used by both humans and machines.
4.
To increase the capabilities of both professional and citizen scientists and the
capacities of their organisations to collaborate with each other in mutually beneficial
and potentially transformative ways.
5.
To support the development of Open Science policies and, through increased
dialogue  between  scientists  and  citizens,  foster  Responsible  Research  and
Innovation in the European Research Area.
We will use the terms Open Science and Open Research interchangeably here, with the
understanding that no domain of research – academic, industrial, governmental or other –
should be regarded as excluded from using an open approach. We will underline that by
running this transdisciplinary project itself as an open project, where not only the results
but also the process of research are made transparent if feasible. 
To achieve these goals, we will build a VRE on the basis of Wikidata, the database that
anyone can edit, which serves as the semantic backbone for structured data in Wikipedia
and its sister projects. It represents a massive development step and paves the way
towards a structured future of Wikipedia. Upon its launch, Sue Gardner, Executive Director
of the Wikimedia Foundation, wrote: “Before Wikidata, Wikipedians needed to manually
update hundreds of Wikipedia language versions every time a famous person died or a
country’s  leader  changed.  With  Wikidata,  such  new  information,  entered  once,  can
automatically appear across all Wikipedia language versions. That makes life easier for
editors and makes it easier for Wikipedia to stay current."
Wikidata is a major open data platform for massive online collaboration and is designed to
share “the sum of all human knowledge”, including all domains of scholarly and scientific
knowledge. It has already become a major focus point for sharing scholarly as well as
technical information. As a key element of the wider landscape of citizen-driven open
knowledge initiatives, Wikidata is unfolding with the active participation of a global and
1

multilingual community of volunteers – more than 14,000 of them contribute to the project
on a monthly basis.
By building on Wikidata, the proposal avoids the problems of many other VRE platforms
that struggle to find sufficiently large communities of users. An ecosystem of infrastructure,
technologies and tools already exists, but the interactions with professional research are
insufficiently developed. Most professional science and citizen science projects presently
work  on  completely  separate  digital  platforms.  The  present  project  addresses  known
barriers and investigates the yet unknown ones. By adding innovative features required for
research workflows, providing help with semantic mapping, providing best practices and
training materials, and researching pilot use cases, this project will enable the Wikidata
platform to develop from a virtual environment to a virtual research environment for Open
Science, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and
potentially transformative forms of collaboration.
The specific objectives of the project are: 
1. Goal 1: 
1.1. to provide a VRE where contributions are transparent and trusted because all changes
are accountable and a full history of changes is publicly available;
1.2. to enhance the verifiability of statements by accompanying them with provenance and
references (Task 3.2);
1.3. to increase the scale and immediacy with which scientific information is made globally
available to both people and machines, and curated by them;
2. Goal 2: 
2.1. to support transdisciplinary science by promoting the adoption of a single open data
VRE platform across disciplines from the natural sciences to the humanities;
2.2. to establish a single open-data VRE platform by piloting it for a set of core use cases
(chemistry,  library  and  information  science,  biodiversity  science,  mineralogy  and  the
cultural heritage sector);
2.3. to promote the open-source Wikibase software (of which Wikidata is an installation) as
a framework also installable and adaptable for institution-internal knowledge management;
3. Goal 3: 
3.1. to establish the use of stable identifiers for scientific objects and concepts (which are
dereferenceable, i.e. can be actively followed to obtain further information) in a pilot of 5
large and 10 smaller scientific datasets (WP2 and Task 3.1);
6
Mietchen D et al.

3.2. to increase the interlinking of information by making a large number of scientific
objects and concepts citable in a long-term stable and sustainable manner in the Linked
Open Data Cloud;
4. Goal 4: 
4.1. to develop and provide documentation, training materials, tutorials, open educational
course  materials,  best-practices  advice,  as  well as  dissemination  and  community
engagement events (WP5);
4.2. to increase the number of citizen data scientists and citizen data curators interacting
with professional scientific researchers and professional research organisations with the
aim to increase the quality of the data available for all (Task 4.5);
4.3. to increase the number of external citizen science projects that use Wikidata (Task
4.5);
5. Goal 5: 
5.1. to participate in the EC’s Open Data Pilot as both provider and re-user of data from
multiple domains, which can inform quality improvement measures for the Pilot;
5.2. to analyse the motivations for the open sharing of data in research contexts, identify
best  practices,  and  distill  recommendations  on  the  design  and  implementation  of
institutional and overarching data-sharing policies.
Relation to the work programme 
The proposal is strongly aligned with the specific challenges of the Horizon 2020 call for “e-
Infrastructures for virtual research environments (VRE)”. It will address the challenge of
capacity-building in interdisciplinary European research by adapting a trans-disciplinary
collaborative  open-data  knowledge  platform  to  the  needs  of  professional  researchers
(WP2–4), developing best practices for and providing training around that (WP5). Being
web-based and supporting standard forms of knowledge expression, knowledge integration
and computing, the proposed VRE will integrate resources across all layers of the e-
infrastructure. Its strengths will be full and inherent transdisciplinarity and mechanisms to
support openness with respect to standards, transparency and accountability; options for
dissent;  and  mechanisms  to  encourage  consensus-building.  It  will  provide  significant
computing resources to improve the analysis and integration options of both existing
general knowledge and the newly integrated scientific data. 
The Wiki4R VRE will be modular. The existing Wikidata infrastructure already fulfils several
requirements of a modern VRE:
•
abstraction from underlying infrastructures, 
•
the use of open source software with a large global developer base, 
•
the use of globally accessible, well-documented interfaces and APIs, 
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
7

•
the use of web-based workflows,
•
a service-oriented architecture supporting both human and machine use,
•
an ecosystem of tools interacting with the core infrastructure, and
•
full interoperability with standard Semantic Web technologies.
The action will specifically address the presently tentative connection between Wikidata
stakeholders (open-source volunteer developers from civil society) and professional
researchers and their organisations. With its limited resources, the project will target on-
platform development that is beneficial for research across domains. However, we expect
that future extensions – by both the project partners and others – will create an ecosystem
of  domain-specific  functionality  around  this  VRE  through  both  on-  and  off-platform
enhancements.  Wikidata  and  DBpedia  will  provide  generic  data  storage,  integration,
curation and analysis services to a multilingual open-data user community, with strong
attention to trust, provenance, accountability, and verifiability. All data on Wikidata will be
open-access. Domain- and discipline-specific services from public, private and commercial
research institutions will build on this foundation.
The Wiki4R VRE will be relevant for data-oriented research that addresses a broad range
of  societal  challenges,  from  the  natural  sciences  (including  health,  climate  research,
environment, agriculture and forestry), to engineering (including energy and transport),
mathematics,  information  science,  the  digital  humanities,  education  and  unsupervised
learning. The project partners span major branches of the natural sciences, the arts and
humanities, the cultural and natural heritage sector, and civil society, along with partners
with information science and Semantic Web expertise. Due to the open and participatory
nature of Wikidata, people and organisations outside the partner consortium will be free to
contribute.  Challenges  regarded  as  important  by  citizens  will  be  addressable:  no
restrictions will be imposed by the consortium partners on the type and usage of data.
The greatest strength of the action will be new ways of a wide spectrum of citizens in
research, data analysis and knowledge sharing, leading to a more inclusive, innovative and
reflective European society. Open knowledge and the engagement of citizens and society
in a responsible research and innovation process resonate strongly with European values.
Global  initiatives  with  a  European  basis  –  like the  Open  Knowledge  Foundation,
Wikimedia’s Wikidata and DBpedia – provide very valuable contributions to that.
Concept and approach
The  research  agenda  for  VREs  by  Candela  et  al.  (2013) highlights  that  usability,
sustainability and the reuse of services and resources should be built into the design, and
that VREs should be integrated with other existing infrastructure in a mutually beneficial
way,  enhancing  their  sustainability  and  their  value  in  the  eyes  of  broader  research
communities. Promoting a VRE user community early in development will be critical to
ensuring  sufficient  uptake  for  the  sustainability  of  VREs  and  the  potential  for  future
research on improving them. Ideally, the VRE should come to be seen as an essential
technology for the target community; this will require both social and technical innovation.
As Candela et al. suggest, the “focus should be primarily on using technology to identify
8
Mietchen D et al.

and rationalise workflows, procedures, and processes characterising a certain research
scenario rather than having technology invading the research scenario and distracting
effort from its real needs.”
Many existing VREs are designed as secure and closed "remote desktop" systems, in
which a selected and managed number of researchers can work, and which provide
feature-complete, controlled and customised data access and computing services to the
larger world. This approach clearly has its applications; but it typically does not scale well
to  a  large  number  of  researchers  with  diverse  research  needs.  One  reason  for  this
concerns the management of access and collaboration rights. If researchers fall into few
well-defined groups with standard tasks (e.g. citizen scientists with homogeneous data
collection rights), large numbers can be managed. However, researchers typically have
very diverse needs. This can extend to citizen scientists, if they are considered as partners
who collaborate in the full research process. The rights management for a VRE with a
large number of users – possibly 100,000 – could become prohibitively expensive. Another
reason concerns VRE-specific methods of access to external data and services, the sum of
which can be expensive to implement and sustain. This limits this type of VREs with
respect to the number and diversity of research questions and typically results in discipline-
specific VREs. Finally, while the results from such a VRE may be channelled into open-
access publications, such VREs typically do not easily lend themselves to open science,
where the research process itself is shared (Fig. 1).
Our proposal does not attempt to build such a secured, highly customised, discipline-
specific research environment with expensive-to-maintain, purpose-tailored tools. Instead,
it focuses on the needs of open science and empowering researchers to work together
across disciplines in an open environment. Ultimately, the web itself – especially the
Semantic Web combined with web-based computing services – is the full VRE. Specific

firewall.

components, such as the Wikidata–science connection developed here, are components of
this VRE. They provide services to the web, but do not limit the use of the web and its
services.
The  concept  of  open  science  (alternatively  called  “open  research”  if  disciplines  like
philosophy,  history,  are  not  included  in  the  definition  of  “science”)  is  central  to  this
proposal. Open science is highly inclusive, inviting collaboration from professional peers as
well as other interested parties, including citizen scientists. It is also open with respect to
the process, inviting collaboration and providing access to research data as soon as they
are created. 
Managing  openness  is  not  a  trivial  exercise.  It  requires  both  appropriate  technical
foundations and procedural and social competencies, rules and policies. Openness and
collaboration need to be maximised, dissent needs to be possible, consensus needs to be
encouraged, all actions need to be owned, and all actors held accountable. Contributions
must  be  not  only  technically  documented,  but  also  suitably  acknowledged  with
provenance-related information that may be available to both humans and machines, yet
transparent to the search process for content.
Many of the technologies and policies have already been developed in the context of
Wikipedia and Wikidata. However, there is no automatic adoption of these techniques by
professional science. We identify social barriers, especially a lack of examples and lack of
training, but also technical gaps. The project therefore studies these problems. It works
both on enhanced technical solutions and on providing professional researchers with
examples, guidelines and best practice documentation as to how their data can be shared
openly and integrated with other open data (see “Optimizing openness”, T3.3). 
The Wiki4R VRE, which will be tested in a number of pilot cases, supports web-based,
discipline-neutral, standard  analysis  methods. It empowers  researchers to share data
widely, to integrate and interlink research data with general, non-discipline-specific data, to
cite data and have their own data cited. Finally, it empowers researchers to share the
burden  of  data  curation  between  professional  science  organisations  and  citizen  data
scientists/citizen data curators.
The open-science approach will not work for all possible domains of systematic inquiry
(e.g. industrial research aiming at patentable results). If legal, data privacy, commercial, or
other considerations prevent openness, it will be necessary to design mechanisms that
allow  certain  data  to  be  stored  privately.  Aspects  of  data  privacy  will  be  carefully
considered  where  applicable,  and  the  Wikimedia  Foundation’s  privacy  policy will  be
enforced.
However,  where  open  science  is  possible,  it  will  be  highly  desirable.  By  increasing
opportunities for collaboration, by increasing transparency and trust, by providing research
progress and feedback opportunities as early as possible, and by providing more examples
for students to learn from, research and education will become more efficient.

Mietchen D et al.

Factors that facilitate the uptake of the Wiki4R VRE for open science use are open data,
coverage  of  all  domains  of  knowledge,  a  powerful  API  and  strong  support  for
multilingualism (in terms of the data, the community, and the user interface). The use of a
CC0 license will avoid forced attribution stacking for primary data, while at the same time
mechanisms support and encourage proper scholarly citation. The deep integration of
Wikidata with Wikipedia and its sister projects provides an excellent basis for recognition,
long-term sustainability, and high impact. The consortium expects to have fewer issues
with the credibility, sustainability and longevity concerns most EU projects typically fight
with. One limitation that the present action will address is a lack of acceptance as a VRE
for professional research. A key goal of the actions will be to ensure that the Wiki4R VRE
will  be  readily  accepted  by  many  partners  outside  the  consortium.  The  number  of
researchers targeted by this action is therefore potentially very high.
An important action is the integration of semantic entities and ontologies between research
data and existing Wikidata items and properties to improve interoperability (WP2). The
study and alignment of ontologies in this context is based on the realisation that research is
dynamic: in the foreseeable future, no single ontology will be able to cover the needs of all
diverse research groups. Even within disciplines, ontologies will be constantly evolving.
Wikidata therefore supports an agile development of multiple ontologies, including the
option that ontologies developed by different researchers may be contradictory. The choice
of a single ontology will often be required for analysis purposes. The fundamental system
is not built for a priori “truth”, but for discourse and research. Thus, instance/subclass
assertions will underlie the same requirements for ownership and provenance reference as
all other statements.
Sharing the semantics of research data early in the research process has great potential in
increasing the efficiency of research. Doing so enables the expression of knowledge by the
authoritative researchers, rather than the kind of guesswork that typically has to occur
when adding semantic tagging to research publications that are not inherently semantic
(but, for example, have been published as PDF). Another problem addressed is the
problem that identifiers for concepts or objects may be required for further work long before
the formal results are finally published. Even without full open science, much is being
reported on conferences and in communications that influences the research of other
groups and makes it desirable to semantically refer to new objects and concepts as early
as possible. The creation and dissemination of appropriate identifiers should be one of the
first steps in an open-science process (Fig. 2).
The proposed social and technical design of the Wiki4R VRE addresses the needs and
requirements of a diverse network of project partners and associate partners, who offer
use cases for data deposition and reuse as well as provision of value-added services.
There are still comparatively few examples of Wikidata use in research contexts, therefore
the project will include the development of new projects as well as associated tools and
infrastructure that support these and existing use cases. Several partners are specifically
interested in the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, for example:
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
11

•
providing bibliographic metadata across scholarly domains for direct linking with
research data
•
integration of data across chemistry, between chemistry and biology and between
chemistry and mineralogy
•
integration of metadata about heritage collections
•
integration of multilingual data.
The Wiki4R VRE will exist in an ecosystem of tools, services and infrastructures at national
and European levels. Several parts of the ecosystem have been developed by project
partners,  maximising  the  ease  with  which  the  present  project  can  build  upon  these
developments. Examples include The European Library (part of the Europeana Foundation
, providing access to the catalogues of 48 National and Research Libraries of Europe) and
Open PHACTS (providing pharmacological data to aid drug discovery). Further examples
are portals for advanced data exploration, multilingual integration, and semantic linking of
data. Examples of transdisciplinary and multilingual data-driven research include analysing
relationships between data items, such as the social and intellectual relationships between
ancient  philosophers,  linkages  between  scientific  facts  extracted  from  the  scholarly
literature,  or  the  detection  of  biases  across  many  languages  (see  also  gender  bias
examples further down). Value-added data mining services such as ContentMine have
already defined use cases for automated deposition and retrieval of data in the context of a
social architecture. They combine use of structured data from Wikidata to find connections
between incoming data streams from the scientific literature with community curation. A
number of visualisation projects use Wikidata, for example to analyse networks of ancient
philosophers.

The existing Wikidata community includes domain specialists such as the editors of WikiPr
oject Chemistry. In many cases, this means that mapping and external links to relevant
resources already exist, of which the project can take advantage.
The following research innovation activities are especially relevant for Wiki4R:
The Europeana Foundation and The European Library (already mentioned above) are
supported as part of the EU’s Digital Agenda and expected to be funded as part of the
EU’s  Connected  Europe  Facility.  The  Europeana  Foundation acts  as  the  central
aggregator for data about Europe’s culture heritage. Europeana has aggregated 32 million
records related to digitised objects in Europe’s museums, archives and libraries. For this
purpose, Europeana has developed a Europeana Licencing Framework to harmonise the
rights statements about digitised content and a related metadata model (the Europeana
Data Model) for creating interoperable metadata from different domains. These two pillars
ensure that the data available from Europeana - which will put onto Wikidata as part of this
project - is all marked as CC0 and available as standardised Linked Open Data.
In addition to the central aggregator, various other specific aggregators focus on specific
areas of the cultural sector (e.g. museums or archives). In the context of this proposal, The
European Library will make its dataset of over 90 million bibliographic records available,
i.e. data about published books. The data is drawn from national and research libraries
across Europe - in essence, the European Library dataset acts as the record of publication
in Europe. Similar to Europeana, the dataset is available as CC0 and as standardised LOD
of national, regional, and local endeavours where complementarities and new challenges
are clearly identified and acted upon. 
RENDER is a finished FP7 project which provided a comprehensive conceptual framework
and  technological  infrastructure  for  enabling,  supporting,  managing  and  exploiting
information diversity in Web-based environments. Diversity was viewed as a crucial source
of innovation and adaptability, ensuring the availability of alternative approaches towards
solving hard problems, and provides new perspectives and insights on known situations.
Equally  important,  embracing  diversity  in  information  management  is  essential  for
enhancing  state-of-the-art  technology  in  this  field  with  novel  paradigms,  models,  and
methods and techniques for searching, selecting, ranking, aggregating, clustering and
presenting information purposefully to users, thus alleviating critical aspects of information
overload. The concepts, methods, techniques and technology developed by RENDER will
especially inform the diversity approach for Wiki4R.
Gene Wiki (an Associate partner, via Andrew Su at Scripps) is a highly relevant project for
our purpose in that GeneWiki successfully implements the dissemination of professional
research information into Wikipedia and increasingly Wikidata. Its focus is on human
genes,  diseases  and  drugs,  which  has  some  very  limited  thematic  overlap  with  our
activities  on  metabolites  (see  also  T3.1).  Methodologically,  we  envisage  a  close
collaboration, e.g. in terms of sharing in the development of code for curating Wikidata
items and in collaborating with relevant WikiProjects in the semantic modelling parts
(WP2). There is also a conceptual overlap in that some of our proposed activities map well
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
13

onto activities that were contained in the Gene Wiki proposal but not approved for funding.
This includes a training component (our T5.2-T5.5) but also the idea of partnering with a
journal (cf. T5.1). The Gene Wiki project is to run until April 2018, so we envisage
organizing a joint session during at least one of the events we are both attending (e.g.
during  Wikimania  2016,  which  is  to  take  place  in  Italy  ).  Wiki4R  will  build  on  the
experiences of GeneWiki.
Wikimedia  Deutschland  is  partner  in  the  Commons  European  Training  Network 
(CONCERTO) proposed by the Autonomous University of Barcelona under the MARIE
Skłodowska-CURIE ACTIONS Innovative Training Networks (ITN), Call H2020-MSCA-
ITN-2015. This ITN, if funded, will provide a cross-disciplinary approach to research of
global, local, digital and non-digital commons and initiate 15 individual research projects,
including one on knowledge commons. Synergy effects between CONCERTO and Wiki4R
would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms and policies supporting and
governing diverse multi-stakeholder knowledge commons such as Wikidata.
The Blue Obelisk Movement is an informal organization of chemistry promoting and
developing tools for Open Data, Open Source, and Open Standards (ODOSOS) in chemist
ry. Besides many cheminformatics tools, they also maintain a manually curated, CC0-
waived knowledgebase of element and isotope properties which will be used in the Wiki4R
pilots.
Multimedia  Objects  in  Open-Access  Publication,  a  recent  DFG  (German  Science
Foundation) application by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB)
will investigate the “harvesting, indexing and provision of multimedial open access objects
using the infrastructure of Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata”. If funded, this action will
provide significant synergies with Wiki4R, which will be leveraged through the Leibniz
research network Science 2.0, in the framework of which TIB collaborates with MfN and
WMDE.
Data analysis tools like Cytoscape or R and workflow systems like Taverna are frequently
used  in  research,  and  Wiki4R  is  interested  in  integration  with  these  tools.  Various
consortium partners are involved in projects that expose data platforms in such tools.
These projects include BioVEL/ViBRANT, Wf4Ever, and eNanoMapper, all aimed at
making data integration and analysis easier. 
Other relevant past and present projects are OpenUp! (natural history media aggregator
into Europeana), OpenAIRE (EC Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe), and
Zenodo (open access literature repository, used also by OpenAIRE).
Wiki4R will focus on use case scenarios of the VRE that cross disciplinary boundaries in
that they:
1. are useful for all disciplines: scholarly publications and associated multimedia, ontology
development, metadata about institutions or researchers;
14
Mietchen D et al.

2. cover a broad range of disciplines (H2020 Open Research Data Pilot, citizen science,
GLAM collections, structured historical information, big data);
3. focus on information from chemistry that is used in a wide range of other disciplines
(from agriculture to medicine and pharmacology to palaeontology and mineralogy to the
restoration of paintings);
4. focus on information from biological taxonomy that forms the basis for research in an
entire field (life sciences);
5. range from monolingual to multilingual;
6. give guidance to software development representative for a diverse set of potential
users.
Ambition
The  development  of  a  completely  universal,  transdisciplinary,  transnational,  and
translingual VRE is an unsolved challenge. It involves extremely complex technical, legal,
procedural and social issues and is, in fact, a challenge by far exceeding the resources
and funding durations typically available. The proposal is highly innovative in addressing
this problem by recognizing three key points:
1.
The Web itself, in the form of globally interconnected data and services, is the VRE
of the future.
2.
The focus must be on establishing globally accepted points of collaboration to
iteratively  and  in  an  agile  development  process  gather  sufficient  resources,
development and training actions to provide this VRE.
3.
The open knowledge community has already developed solutions and platforms for
many of these issues, solutions which, with limited effort, can be brought to fruition
for conventional professional research as well.
Using highly limited resources, the proposal will therefore focus on investigating and
developing the functionality of Wikidata for professional scientific research. VREs built on
top of existing, widely deployed and utilized platforms are rare, but this approach is
essential for sustainability, trust and reaching a large community. The proposal most likely
is asking for significantly less resources than many other VRE proposals in this call. In the
light of the vision above, it understands itself as a pilot in a global, highly ambitious process
of increasing integration, collaboration, and openness.
Professional scientists and researchers as well as citizen scientists (including "Citizen Data
Scientist") will be able to use this environment. With the inclusion of Freebase into Wikidata
(expected to be accomplished by the Open Knowledge community in 2015), the Wiki4R
VRE will be capable of providing a unique service: for the first time, both citizen and
professional  scientists  from  any  research  or  language  community  can  integrate  their
databases into an open global structure. This point of integration can be used to publicly
annotate, verify, criticise and improve the quality of available data, to define its limits, to
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
15

contribute to the evolution of domain-specific ontologies, and to make all this available to
everyone, without restrictions on use and reuse. One application will be the analysis of
intersections  of  public  (governmental)  and  research  data.  An  example  could  be  the
combination of disease epidemiology data (by country, by year) with public sales data of
products (e.g. drugs, food) or events (e.g. concerts, movies).
Open Science in itself is an ambitious new undertaking. The proposal is ground-breaking in
combining the open collaboration methods developed in citizen-driven open knowledge
initiatives with the new Open Science approaches developed in professional research on a
common infrastructure.
Impact
Expected impacts
The research community is experiencing a massive growth in data, a trend that is expected
to continue. On the one hand, this manifests itself in the form of large data volumes and
data streams with high bit rate of relatively homogeneous data. Particle physics are a
prime example where these aspects of big data are dominant. These are addressed
through various EU funding actions (e.g., EUDAT). On the other hand, however, the trend
also manifests itself in the form of “big complexity issues”. New research information refers
to  previous  information,  often  across  many  different  disciplines.  Traditional  isolated
databases  containing  verbatim  information  in  data  fields,  queryable  through  human-
oriented search portals or custom APIs, do not fulfil today’s data analysis requirements. A
first improvement is to disambiguate relations between items through stable, globally
unique identifiers. However, this still requires the expert knowledge in which “data silos”
related data will be found. The next step in managing the complexity of interrelated
scientific, societal, and governmental information is therefore to use identifiers which inform
machines how to reach related information. The most general model for this is called the
“Semantic Web”.
Whereas funding with respect to high data volume and high speed processing issues is
ample, it may be that insufficient attention is yet given to issues of high data complexity.
With the present proposal we offer a step into this direction, addressing many issues of the
future  of  scientific  data  analysis  in  the  face  of  high  data  complexity.  The  proposal
contributes to:
•
Strengthening the European Expertise in Semantic Web issues,
•
interlinking research data early on,
•
developing Open Science collaboration expertise in general, and especially 
•
developing capacities in collaboration expertise between citizen data scientists 
While the Semantic Web addresses many technical issues, it becomes truly effective only
if data are semantically interlinked to provide context (the final star in Berners-Lee’s five
star concept). Reaching this state at the necessary scale is a complex problem. An
16
Mietchen D et al.

important answer is community data curation by an alliance professional scientists from
multiple institutions as well as citizen data scientists. To achieve this, database maintainers
must relinquish some control and become competent in smarter collaboration techniques.
Wikimedia projects are a prime example for crowdsourcing and massive collaboration per
se, but they also have a track record of involvement in the curation of external scientific
databases. Notable examples include the Gene Wiki project – which curates information
about human genes on the English Wikipedia and now increasingly on Wikidata – and the
Rfam/Pfam projects, which collaborate with the English Wikipedia in curating databases ab
out RNA and protein families.
The project addresses collaboration opportunities both between professional organisations
and between professional research and citizen science. An example may illustrate use
cases for the first scenario:
Natural  history  museum  collections  across  the  world  hold  hundreds  of  millions  of
specimens, which are important for studying the diversity of organisms and their uses. The
digitisation of theses specimens is a slow and expensive process (because of sheer
numbers, diversity of objects and their preservation, hard to decipher handwritten labels,
etc.). Knowing itineraries of collectors, routes and dates of expeditions can improve quality
control and greatly simplifies expensive processes like geolocating specimens (essential
for  habitat  modelling,  nature  conservation  and  climate  change  research).  Having  a
transinstitutional repository of collector itineraries rather than each institution curating local
data would greatly increase the efficiency of work. Existing systems like ORCID (for
contemporary authors only) or VIAF do provide much information, but cannot provide
enough coverage for the breadth of collectors relevant to museums. The Wiki4R VRE will
provide links to ORCID and VIAF, but also support adding new persons as needed in a
way, that local work can use the newly created semantic identifiers within seconds. 
Highly relevant to the Wikidata argument is that the use case is in fact not limited to natural
history collection. Many collectors collecting both natural and cultural history artefacts.
Thus,  the  standard  disciplinary  approach  to  institute  a  shared  conventional  database
across natural history institutions (e.g. in Europe through CETAF) is still not fully satisfying.
Going even further, collections are also relevant as a historical record documenting global
exploration  (and  often  colonization)  of  the  world  and  collaboration  with  historical
researchers is highly desirable.
The Wiki4R VRE is ideally positioned for collaborative data curation across scientific
disciplines, organisations, countries and languages, since it: 
•
is already well established and globally available to everyone,
•
provides data in a structured format and in multiple languages,
•
can be contributed to and corrected collaboratively, through humans and machines,
•
can be linked with other ancillary data (e.g. current or historical geographical
entities).
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
17

In order to realize this transdisciplinary integration potential, groundwork has to be laid by
integrating domain-specific research data and scientific knowledge bases with existing
Wikidata content. We will support the ontological mapping (WP2), establish tools and
workflows for systematic integration (WP3) and analysis methods (WP4), and develop
training materials. The effectiveness of the methods developed will be tested. Important
pilot use cases are bibliographic metadata about scholarly publications and chemistry data
(e.g.  small  molecules,  biochemical  pathways,  enantiomers).  Professional  chemical
researchers will closely collaborate with Wikidata’s WikiProject Chemistry – a community of
volunteers with a shared interest in curating chemical information on Wikidata – and
professional  librarians  with  WikiProject  Source  MetaData,  a  community  interested  in
metadata about references cited on Wikipedia. Similar WikiProjects exist for a steadily
growing  variety  of  topics  and  will  be  our  general  points  of  contact  for  ensuring
interoperability of our cross-domain activities with domain-specific matters. For instance,
WikiProject sum of all paintings collects information about paintings in museum collections
around the globe, and lists of these paintings can easily be generated on the basis of
Wikidata, e.g. for Kandinsky. Other WikiProjects on Wikidata deal with music, economics, g
eology, medicine, or tropical cyclones. 
The proposed project – in its transdisciplinary character – has also excellent potential for
gender research. Existing research examples include the Wikipedia Gender Inequality
Index research project, studying questions like among all the gendered biographies, which
Wikipedias  have  the  highest  percentages  of  articles  about  a  given  gender?  As  the
semantic data becomes richer, it will become possible to study the interrelation between
gender and cultural biases, or sexuality and ethnicity biases among Wikipedias. In fact, for
any recorded property in Wikidata, we will be able to see how they are biased by language.
We aim to demonstrate that the increased uptake of Wikidata as a central part a Wiki4R
VRE will accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. Technically, Wiki4R will improve
reliable discovery, access and re-use of public data. Not all data will be in Wikidata itself;
the vision is that Wikidata becomes a hub with linking concepts and essential information,
with additional detail provided as the professional research organisations. Socially, the
project  will  lead  to  more  effective  collaboration  among  professional  researchers  and
between  professional  and  citizen  researchers.  Open  science  has  great  potential  to
increase the efficiency and creativity of research. Furthermore, true collaboration with
citizens, including discussions about research goals, will greatly strengthen discussions
about responsible research and innovation. The project is dedicated to building bridges
between user communities. With its breadth of scope and true transdisciplinarity, the
project will have impact across disciplines and can become a paradigm for structuring open
data for open science.
In many ways, Open Science is an equivalent to open borders. The economic success of
the removal of taxation, legislation, and other cross-border obstacles to trade in the EU
demonstrates how research can gain by mastering the necessary competencies to remove
obstacles  between  research  groups,  disciplines  and  nationally  organised  research
organisations. However, this vision urgently needs a foundation in platforms designed for
18
Mietchen D et al.

openness, transparency and trust. Wikidata is the ideal candidate for achieving this, but
critically needs enhancements to better interact with professional research.
Measures to maximise impact
Some measures to maximise impact have already previously been mentioned. Wikidata is
a generic system designed for most types of structured semantic data from all scholarly
knowledge domains and is available openly and widely. Of special importance is the focus
on enabling re-use. 
By  default,  any  project  involving  Wikimedia  communities  or  a  Wikimedia  movement
organization will require that all project information, contents, data, and results are made
available under an open license. Consequently, this project will be entirely based on open
source software  (Linux,  Mediawiki,  Wikibase,  etc.)  and  all  software  developed  in  the
consortium will be under open source licenses, maximizing the coalition that maintains the
software  beyond  the  duration  of  the  project.  Research  data  integrated  into  Wikidata
likewise will be re-usable under open licenses. The project will treat data pursuant to the
definition of Linked Open Data, a standard also adopted by the EU for its Open Data Portal
(see also T4.1).
Reports or scientific publications resulting from the project will be published under the ‘gold
model’ of open access, with additional archival in relevant repositories. The default license
will be CC BY 4.0.
Of critical importance for the success and impact of the project is that the Wiki4R VRE
becomes compatible with and integrated into the data workflows of professional scientific
institutions. Interoperability will be tested with W3C unit tests (Task 4.1). Data can be
created and updated both by humans and software/machine and are immediately available
for further use or new semantic links (Task 4.2).
Dissemination and exploitation of results
The exploitation plan for the project is primarily based on the concept of openness. The
value is generated as a result of lowering barriers to re-use and integration, similar to how
the EU economy profits from lowering other barriers, such as tariffs, border controls, and or
non-harmonized legislation. Openness is not altruism, but in many cases makes societal
and economic sense.
A good example is open source software. This form of software is not the domain of
hobbyist  or  universities  alone.  It  makes  economic  sense  because  it  allows  major
competitors in the IT industry to share the burden of most software development, while
focusing their proprietary actions on a number of (non-open) additions.
Similarly, a global, transdomain, multilingual structured knowledge base, providing generic
facts as well as research results, with open licensing and a powerful API is an excellent
basis for entrepreneurial business developments. For example, Histropedia – a startup in
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
19

the UK and an Associate partner – uses Wikidata statements as the basis for location- and
time-aware services that allow users to create or view timelines on topics of their choice.
Media from Wikimedia Commons and related Wikipedia articles are automatically added.
The system will support combining external data with globally available Wikidata-based
data, to create spatio-temporal visualisations for research, education, presentations or as
parts of other software applications. Intended user are academic research, education (e.g.
a  chart  of  atmospheric  CO2  and  average  temperatures  plotted  against  a  timeline  of
geological events), the tourist industry, and organisations that wish to visualise their own
proprietary data sets in combination with publicly available data. Another example is Music
Brainz (a project of the associate partner MetaBrainz ) which already closely interconnects
its own work with Wikidata and which is used e.g. by the BBC (UK). 
Open data can in general be an excellent basis for business. An apt example is the recent
decision  to  dissolve  the  Google  Freebase  system  in  favour  of  the  broader  Wikidata
integration  possibilities,  with  Google  reasoning:  “they’re  growing  fast,  have  an  active
community, and are better-suited to lead an open collaborative knowledge base.“ We
agree with Google’s assessment and consider it important to build capacities on exploiting
openness such that the European economy may benefit.
Similar benefits from openness can be expected in the area of education, especially the
development of Open Educational Resources (OER) and courses. The benefit will not only
the availability of data that are directly relevant to the curriculum. The availability of data
sets of the scale and complexity present on the Wiki4R VRE will enable courses where real
research can be performed based on inquiries generated by the students rather than the
teacher.
Thus, the focus of the project is on dissemination, not knowledge protection. Data present
in Wikidata can be either used directly or they can be downloaded and imported into mirror
deployments. Management is not through access rights, but through accountability. All the
data changes are tracked and patrolled by the contributors of Wikidata. Quality control is
currently mainly manual, but one of the actions of the present proposal is to develop
improved automated quality control systems. Both scientists and citizens can create unit
tests  to  provide  timely  quality  control  (Task  4.1).  The  results  can  be  used  to  alert
community administrators as well as professional research organisations curating their
data on Wikidata. 
Sustainability
The sustainability of the Wiki4R VRE critically depends on the financial sustainability of
Wikidata. Wikidata is a project of both the global Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia
Deutschland (Germany). Since 2012, both organisations have invested significant amounts
of their own funds, supported by third-party funding from, e.g., the Allen Institute for
Artificial  Intelligence,  Google,  the  Gordon  and  Betty  Moore  Foundation,  and  Yandex.
Wikidata has already become a core technology for the functioning of Wikipedia and is
thus essential to the Wikimedia movement. It is supported by a number of additional
stakeholders from the cultural, information technology and educational arenas who see its
20
Mietchen D et al.

potential for making content and knowledge accessible. Wikidata’s business plan for
financial sustainability includes a diversity of financial and human resources which are
currently secured or under development:
•
The invaluable human resources provided by the community of Wikidata online
volunteer contributors and editors (currently over 14,000 individuals and growing
fast)
•
Base funding from the budget of the Wikimedia Foundation (which raised USD 37
million in online donations in the 2013-14 fiscal year)
•
Base funding from the general operating budget of Wikimedia Deutschland (which
raised USD 8 million in online donations)
•
Funding through partnerships with corporate donors
•
Funding  from  private  foundations  (WMDE  fund  development  staff  is  currently
working with a strong focus on fund acquisition from European-based foundations
with an interest in free and open knowledge)
•
Public educational and cultural institutions and entities of government, interested in
partnering with WMDE and its broad community of online volunteers. 
A direct monetization of Wikidata is neither intended nor possible, as it conflicts with core
principles of the Wikimedia and Open Knowledge movements. It is, however, possible that
at some point computationally expensive services may be provided at a charge or under
dedicated  funding  by  public  or  private  partners  depending  on  these  services.  In  the
framework of the current proposal, we consider a testing of such services to be premature. 
Communication activities
As a basis for engaging with the target communities and beyond, all communications will
be as open as possible, as is common practice in both Open Science and Wikimedia
contexts. 
That practice was already applied to the drafting process of this proposal itself, which was
completely open from the initial blog post to the outline on Wikidata and from the actual
drafting in public Google docs to the archiving of the final version under a Creative
Commons Attribution license in a dedicated Zenodo community and a dedicated page on
Wikidata for post-submission updates. 
This was complemented by daily communication via a public mailing list, and a dedicated
Twitter  hashtag as  well  as  contributions  to  the  Wikidata  mailing  list and  community
newsletters related to Wikidata or cultural partnerships, in addition to public hangouts and
the various communication channels on Wikidata itself. 
One article about the project was viewed well over 6000 times prior to proposal submission
, and another one offered “uncritical cheering” for the project. Judging from such feedback
and from the contributions we received from the community during the drafting process,
this multi-channel interactive approach is fruitful. We were further encouraged by public
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
21

attention being directed to the issue of open grant proposals in response to one of our
publications. 
A final underpinning of our communication strategy is the awareness that Wikidata was
conceived as a tool to help manage data for Wikipedia. While Wikidata has since grown
more of an identity of its own, this aspect is still important, and it provides exposure at
scale and in multiple languages.
On that basis, the detailed communication strategy varies depending on the characteristics
of the respective communities:
Individual professional researchers will be reached through the networks of the project
partners,  through  publications,  mailing  lists,  training  events  and  through  conference
attendance.  We  will  also  address  the  lack  of  professional  recognition  for  community
curation by exploring ways to couple it to formal publications. For example, the Gene Wiki
Reviews couple the publication of review articles on specific genes with contributions to the
corresponding  articles  on  the  English  Wikipedia.  This  follows  in  the  footsteps  of  the
journals  RNA  Biology and  PLOS  Computational  Biology,  which  have  been  coupling
Wikipedia pages and review articles in a similar fashion. One of the MfN team members
(DM) is involved in the PLOS initiative, and associate partner Pensoft (who is the publisher
for several MfN journals) is interested in such an approach. While such initiatives have
created a relatively low number of articles so far, they are widely known in the respective
communities and can thus serve to raise community awareness of our activities.
Professional Research organisations: All project partners are involved in professional
networks, which will be leveraged to reach out to professional organizations outside the
project. For instance, MfN and WMDE are both members of the Leibniz research network
Science 2.0, and UPM acts as the Spanish node of the DBpedia network. 
Furthermore, we will leverage the growing network of interactions between the Wikimedia
and  research  communities,  which  has  so  far  been  focused  on  Wikipedia,  Wikimedia
Commons and to some extent Wikisource, but is now extending towards Wikidata. 
One particularly successful initiative in this framework is that of a Wikimedian in Residenc
e, i.e. an active member of the Wikimedia community working inside an organization or
institution on enhancing the interaction between the two. Such Wikimedians in Residence
have been active in about 100 institutions around the globe over the last 5 years, and they
form the nucleus of a very active community at the intersection between Wikimedia and the
cultural sector, which increasingly extends into research-related organizations like the
Swedish Agricultural University, Cancer Research UK, or ORCID. The Royal Society of
Chemistry, specifically, is an Associate partner and will assist the project in engaging the
chemical community.
These  cultural  partnerships  have  also  led  to  technical  developments,  e.g.  several
Wikimedia chapters partnered with Europeana to create a toolset that facilitates the upload
of images and other media from heritage collections to Wikimedia Commons with proper
metadata. 
22
Mietchen D et al.

Higher Education: The consortium has four universities as members (UPM, UM, UOC,
UPS), three of which will collaborate to organize a MOOC (T5.4), and all partners are
involved in the development of course materials (T5.3). The non-university partners also
have strong ties to higher education, e.g. doctoral research being performed at MfN,
Europeana materials being used in lectures, and OER conferences organized by WMDE.
Furthermore, many users (both contributors and readers) of Wikidata are students or Early-
Stage Researchers, and hundreds of courses are organized around the globe each year
that have a Wikipedia component and that increasingly involves Wikidata as well.
Citizen Science projects: The European Citizen Science Association, the secretariat of
which  is  hosted  at  the  Museum  für  Naturkunde  Berlin,  has  established  important
communication channels to a large number of citizen science projects in Europe. We will
communicate through these channels (web site, newsletters, events and meetings).
The Wikidata community primarily communicates through the well-established and widely
used Wikidata community portal. It facilitates introduction of new users and editors to the
tools, rules and practices, enables users to submit requests and engage in topical on-wiki
discussion. It further provides the platform for Wikiprojects, which are groups of editors
working together to improve Wikidata. Wiki4R will utilize the existing channels of this
platform to provide updates, resolve integration issues, and introduce new users from the
science communities to the world of Wikidata.
Wikimedia communities in general: Wikidata is the fastest-growing Wikimedia project
globally in terms of the increase in number of volunteer contributors. However, there are
other  Wikimedia  communities  –  including  Wikipedians,  Wikimedia  organizations,  and
contributors to cultural heritage projects – whose members have a vested interest in the
development of Wikidata. Communication activities for these people and groups will use
well-established  channels  as  well,  including  a  variety  of  Wikimedia  blogs,  online
newspapers, Meta-Wiki pages and Twitter.
Policy and decision makers: Outreach and continuous communication to this group will
utilize,  among  other  channels,  the  joint  Brussels  office  of  the  EU-based  Wikimedia
Chapters.  Also  known  as  the  Free  Knowledge  Advocacy  Group  EU  (FKAGEU),  this
Alliance of Open Knowledge advocates will be able to directly communicate policy-relevant
project results, barriers, insights and relevant project outputs through its strong network of
contacts with Members of the European Parliament and other key decision makers. Some
of the main policy priorities of the FKAGEU are EU copyright reform, free and open access
to public works (which includes scientific articles produced by publicly funded researchers)
and freedom of panorama. All of these policy issues are of crucial importance to the goal of
increasing the number of items and data sets that are available under open license and
linked in Wikidata.

Implementation
WORK PLAN 
Overall structure of the work plan
The five work packages (WPs) can be briefly characterized as follows:
WP  1:  “Coordination  and  management” will  provide  the  administrative  support  for
effective project management and support the organisational structures and governance
mechanisms  for  the  efficient  coordination  of  the  Wiki4R  consortium.  It  will  facilitate
communication and exchange of information between consortium partners, WPs, and
organisational bodies, including an independent Advisory Board. Main outputs will be the
implementation and updating all documents required for the full implementation of the
projects, including the management of deliverables and all interim and final financial and
scientific  reports.  Another  main  output  will  be  a  highly  transparent  and  open
communication,  which  provides  new  avenues  for  assessing  and  engaging  with  the
research process and its outcomes.
WP  2:  “Semantic  modelling”  will  work  on  community-agreed  profiles  for  the  most
relevant semantic concepts (core classes and core properties) in a selected number of
scientific domains. Profiles include semantic mappings as well as associated policies and
best practices that meet the functional requirements of the research use cases addressed
in WP3 and WP4. Furthermore, this WP will match these classes and properties to
ontologies used by the scholarly community to allow integration of Wikidata into research
data, using the common ontology used by both. Main outputs will be property profiles
required for the classes of data sets to be integrated in Wiki4R as well as for common
classes needed for the research context. Policies and best practices will be documented
and semantic mappings provided where each class and property will have at least one
relation  to  external  ontologies.  Multiple  mappings  may  be  provided  where  required
(especially if different use cases have different needs).
WP 3: “Integrating research resources with Wikidata” will demonstrate how research
data  can  be  integrated  with  Wikidata  in  the  Wiki4R  VRE.  For  this  purpose,  it  will
incorporate a selection of external research resources into the VRE, demonstrating pilot
workflows  for  semantic  integration,  quality  assurance  mechanism,  and  bidirectional
information flow. Attention will be given to the mechanisms in which Wiki4R can promote
the open licencing of external resources that are yet unavailable for re-use. Main outputs
will be workflows, best practices documentation, approaches to measure the quality of
data, and foremost working examples that serve as paradigms and motivations for future
applications. In addition, resources suitable for the future application of Wiki4R will be
identified and the motivation and pitfalls around sharing data experienced in the pilots will
be summarized in reports. This WP depends on WP2.
24
Mietchen D et al.

WP 4: “Enabling the use of Wikidata in research contexts” will integrate Wikidata into
the  daily  workflows  of  professional  scientists  to  create  a  full  VRE.  To  address
confidentiality  issues  of  ongoing  research  projects,  this  WP  will  develop  solutions  to
dynamically mirror the content of Wikidata and provide controlled information interchange
using Semantic Web technologies. Scientists will be able to curate information in Wikidata
using workflow-oriented dedicated editing interfaces that will interact with Wikidata via its
APIs. The approaches will be tested in the laboratories of one of the project partners, using
citizen science projects, and in a collaboration with Europeana. This WP depends on
WP3.Main outputs will be a new interaction between Wikidata and a SPARQL endpoint for
complex  queries,  and  a  ready-to-use  virtual  machine  that  allows  hosting  a  Wikibase
software instance compatible with Wikidata and Wiki4R in a protected institutional network.
Further output will be solutions developed around the use cases to test the approach and
reports on the effectiveness of Wikidata use in these use cases.
WP 5: “Dissemination, stakeholder engagement and training” will disseminate the
outputs generated by the project to communities of stakeholders. It will practice openness
through open communication to the extent that this is practical. In combination with the
multiple,  largely  bidirectional  communication  channels  outlined  in  the  communication
strategy,  this  allows  to  engage  diverse  communities  more  profoundly  than  traditional
methods. Main outputs will be communication and engagement activities, including training
activities directed at science students, professional researchers as well as members of the
Wikidata community. The ultimate output will be capacities in the European Research Area
in engaging in Open Science, using Wiki4R as a hub for research.

Objectives 
The  objectives  of  this  work  package  are  to  oversee  administration,  operational
management,  and  overall  implementation  of  the  project,  including  internal  effective
communication and collaboration between the coordinator, individual consortium members,
and the European Commission (T1.1), to organize and administer consortium networking
and governance, including supporting relevant bodies and meetings, including Advisory
Board (AB), ensuring efficient and effective management and decision-making procedures
(T1.1) and to implement sound financial management as well as controlling systems and
quality assurance of deliverables and periodic and final Reports (T1.2).
Description of work 
Task 1.1 Intra-consortium management and communication (Lead MfN; all partners;
Month 1-36)
The core part of this task will be the organization and coordination of the consortium bodies
and their meetings, particularly meetings of the Steering Committee (monthly remotely),
and the General Assembly (once a year in person), as well to ensure for efficient and
regular communication between the coordination, the consortium bodies, and all partners.
In person meetings will be aligned with independent community meetings (such as the
“Wikimania”, the yearly meeting of the Wikipedia/Wikimedia/Wikidata community). This
task will further establish a high level scientific Advisory Board. The Advisory Board will
help to monitor progress, and provide independent guidance and advice to the coordinator,
Steering Committee and the entire consortium. Advisory Board members will be supported
in  their  function  by  the  project  logistically  and  with  limited  secretarial  functions.  The
coordination office will also provide for direct links between the Advisory Board and all
consortium bodies, groups and partners as needed. Daily communication will primarily
happen via electronic means, including email, Skype and the #wikidata channel on the
irc.freenode.net network.

Task 1.2 Reporting and finances (Lead MfN; all partners; Month 1-36) 
This task includes the preparation and coordination of the periodic scientific and financial
project reports as requested by the EC, and of the Data Management Plan according to the
H2020  Open  Data  Pilot.  Further  activities  include  the  coordination  of  common
administrative tasks, such as elaborating and providing templates for detailed planning and
reporting of the tasks in each WP; providing formats for compiling and editing progress
reports; monitoring progress through reaching milestones and deliverables; quality control
and  submission  of  products  and  deliverables.  Financial  monitoring  will  ensure  a
transparent financial distribution of the EC grant, including setting and monitoring payment
schedules, and terms of reimbursement. We will also prepare financial controlling reports
for the overall monitoring of the project.

Objectives 
The goal of this WP is to assist the Wikidata community in establishing and setting up a
framework of classes and properties (by using the W3C Web Ontology Language, OWL )
to  enable  the  support  of  the  selected  interdisciplinary  VRE  research  fields  (T2.1).
Specifically, it develops profiles of classes and properties for concepts the project first
focuses  on,  such,  isotopes  and  their  properties,  like  decay,  research  papers  and
properties, like its DOI, title, authors list (using the ORCID), and metabolites and other
small molecules and properties like their chemical structure, boiling and melting point, and
external  database  identifiers.  The  second  task  (T2.2)  will  focuses  on  the  required
mappings  between  Wikidata  elements  (i.e.  classes  and  properties)  and  elements  in
external ontologies. Where needed, recommendations will be made to refine or add new
Table 3. 
WP2 - Semantic modelling
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
27

classes and properties to allow easier or more accurate integration with research data.
Besides  actual  mappings,  also  guidelines  and  procedures  will  be  established  that
streamline the process of building and extending class and property vocabulary and of
populating items with statements involving those properties. Here, the multilingual nature of
Wikidata will be included. We will reuse community adopted ontologies and vocabularies,
such as ChEBI and CHEMINF, and standards like the CIDOC Conceptual Reference
Model used in cultural heritage documentation. 
Description of work 
Task 2.1: Recommendations for classes and their property profiles (Lead: UM; all
partners; Month 1-36)
This tasks focuses on the development of VRE-specific property profiles for classes of
Wikidata items for a number of disciplines. Profiles are defined as sets of properties and
associated policies and best practices that meet the functional requirements of specific
research use cases (WP3 and WP4). Profiles are not limiting the application of properties
which  are  absent  from  the  profile;  rather  they  guide  the  interaction  by  reducing  the
mapping process to a manageable set of properties. Where possible, existing community
efforts towards creating property profiles will be built on. For instance, generic lists already
exist  of  properties  available  for  creative  works  or  periodicals,  as  well  as  draft
recommendations for scholarly articles and chemicals. However, properties considered for
profiles are not limited to properties that already exist on Wikidata; new ones will have to
be introduced. An important part of this task is also to work with Wikidata development
(partner WMDE) to increase the range of available data types (e.g. for supporting units or
geo shapes ). Property profiles will be created for a significant number of classes that fall
under the use cases outlined in the “Concept and approach” part of the Excellence section
of the proposal. The focus will be on the 50-100 most widely used DBpedia classes as
filtered by our use cases. Priority will be given to profiles required for data sets to be
integrated in T3.1, including form project partners (e.g. minerals, meteorites and taxa in the
case of MfN’s collections).
Task 2.2: Semantic mapping for properties (Lead: UPM; all partners; Month 1-36) This
task addresses the need to map the select classes and properties from T2.1 employed in
Wikidata to the larger semantic web world, including DBpedia. We will identify ontologies
and aim at releasing the needed terms as a single "Wikidata for research" ontology.
Example options include the ChEBI and CHEMINF ontologies for the chemistry domain (for
the life sciences the BioPortal and Ontology Lookup Service are useful). Properties used in
property profiles of target item classes from T2.1 will thus be mapped across multiple
established ontologies relevant to the respective VRE use case. On that basis, a pattern
will be built that allows statements about the respective item classes to be expressed in
RDF. Mappings will be provided in a machine readable way, to aid the RDF export of
Wikidata as outlined in T4.1.

Objectives 
This work package is concerned with external research resources with the VRE for the use
cases in the focus of the project. This includes identifying external research resources
suitable for integration with Wikidata, establishing and demonstrating workflows for such
integration (T3.1), establishing quality assurance mechanisms (T3.2), facilitating the reuse
of Wikidata, and analysing the conditions under which external resources are being made
openly available in a way that is suitable for integration with Wikidata (T3.3). The tasks
focus on both defining the requirements as well as the implementation of these tasks, and
a selection of Open Data resources will be integrated to demonstrate how the process of
this integration practically works, with the benefit that Wikidata grows in size and becomes
even more useful to the research community. It builds on existing and well-documented
experiences with such data integration, e.g. in the context of authority control or human
genes, or from Wikipedias. 
Description of work 
Task 3.1: Integrate external databases with Wikidata (Lead UM; Month 1-36)
This task is concerned with enriching Wikidata with CC0 data available from external
sources, taking into account the property profiles and the semantic mappings created in
T2.1 and T2.2. Work here will begin with the integration of one cross-domain database
(The  European  Library  )  and  domain-specific  ones  (Blue  Obelisk  Data  Repository  ).
Integration will be implemented as Open workflows, for which a suitable platform will be
selected. A good candidate here would be the Open Science Framework (OSF) hat is
being developed by the Center for Open Science (COS), an Associate partner. The task
consists of the following subtasks:
Table 4. 
WP3 - Integrating research resources with Wikidata
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
29

European Library Bibliography: The European Library aggregates bibliographic data
across European libraries and makes the data available under CC0 through RDF and an
API. While current data may focus on bibliographic information about articles, books, etc.,
citation of other types will be considered too, like software and data citations, for which we
aim at full compatibility with the DataCite Metadata Schema. (Subtask Lead EF)
The Blue Obelisk Data Repository (BODR) is a CC0 data collection of chemical element
and isotope information collected and maintained by the Blue Obelisk movement. The data
is manually collected and curated from primary sources from, among others, the IUPAC
and  scholarly  publications,  which  could  be  listed  accordingly.  Classes  involved  here
include chemical elements, materials consisting of a single element (e.g. diamond and
oxygen gas), and isotopes. Properties for these classes include element symbol, melting
points, decay constants, etc. The goal of this task is to make a BODR release based on
Wikidata content. Collaboration with the “Groupe de Chimie Analytique de Paris Sud” is
anticipated as well. (Subtask Lead UM)
(Human) Metabolites: For chemical structures, human metabolites will be a focus area.
The Recon2 project created systematic model of the human metabolism under the CC0
waiver. This will feed back into the semantic modelling of chemical compounds, as per
T2.1 and T2.2. Central here are chemical compounds, metabolites, with property names,
and identifiers. Challenges include the charge states of metabolites in this data set and
linking  those  to  the  uncharged  species.  This  work  is  complementary  to  but  partially
overlaps with the work by the Gene Wiki project, which focuses on drug compounds.
Collaboration with WikiPathways is anticipated as well. (Subtask Lead UM)
Other data sources: The task will then expand towards the integration of other data
sources, possibly including MusicBrainz, research-related subsets of Freebase, a subset of
PubChem, the H2020 Open Data Pilot and further resources that are to be identified in
T3.3, including from MfN and Europeana. Options here are the integration of information
about institutions and to support the H2020 Open Data Pilot. In this pilot, considerable
amounts of data will be made publicly available over the course of the project, especially in
those key areas where the pilot is mandatory, such as the NanoSafety Cluster community.
A subset thereof (as identified through T3.3) will be suitable for integration with Wikidata,
which will be handled in this task.
Task 3.2 Quality assurance (Lead: UPM; all partners; Month 1-36) 
This task is concerned with systematically monitoring and improving the quality of the
information already available on or newly added to Wikidata. This includes the handling of
provenance information (in conjunction with T3.1), along with provisions for data citation (in
conjunction with the Data Citation Principles and the property profiles developed in T2.1).
For instance, one of the reasons for the growing reference rot in scholarly publications is
that  the  URLs  of  databases  change  over  time.  Identifier  systems  like  Digital  Object
Identifiers (DOI) or the Handle System address this issue, but not all databases use them
now, fewer have used them in the past, and not all references to those databases having
such identifiers make use of them. In Wikidata, this kind of information could be modelled
30
Mietchen D et al.

by making statements using properties like official website or URL formatter with qualifiers
that indicate start and end times. Tools such as those developed in T4.3 can then reason
upon that information and turn a dysfunctional data citation back into one that points to the
current location of the data if the database still exists.
The task also includes establishing mechanisms for community editors to review and verify
existing and incoming information, both on a factual and linguistic level, as well as tools to
assist with that. Furthermore, it includes measures to assess and increase the consistency
of information on Wikidata. This involves diagnosing erroneous statements (e.g. related to
the death of a person ), which may occur because external sources conflict, or information
across languages, or because related statements are incomplete. For statements identified
this way, we will develop measures to fix them on a programmatic basis or through
interaction with Wikidata editors, while leaving room (as the Wikidata data model allows)
for inconsistencies that simply reflect inconsistencies outside Wikidata, such as territories
being claimed by more than one independent country. Finally, the task includes ways to
propagate those fixes (or other annotations of the detected inconsistencies) to external
databases, to alert original sources if appropriate, and to notify interested Wikipedia editors
or WikiProjects that such inconsistencies were detected and acted upon.
Task 3.3 Optimizing openness (Lead: MfN; all partners; Month 1-36)This task consists of
two main activities: (1) the identification of sources of open data suitable for integration into
Wikidata (public domain or CC0 waiver), (2) an analysis of the motivations for sharing such
data openly, with the aim of informing future open-data policies at project partners or more
generally, including for H2020.
(1) Only a small subset of the publicly available research data is suitable for integration
with Wikidata, with legal, ethical (privacy, etc.), and technical interoperability being major
factors, along with considerations of quality, maintainability and scope. For instance, while
many datasets that would otherwise fit into Wikidata are not free of reuse restrictions,
some datasets like the metadata in Europeana are available under CC0 but do not fully
match the scope of Wikidata. Additionally, while efforts to make data repositories more
visible have been stepped up in recent years, data discoverability remains a challenge. We
will generate an overview of potential data sources for Wikidata and identify datasets
suitable for import or mapping within the framework of the project, as per T2.1 and T3.1.
This overview will include general repositories like re3data as well as data sources in the
respective fields (both domain-general like BioSharing and more specific ones) and from
citizen science projects (in conjunction with T4.4) and the H2020 Open Data Pilot, taking
into account that its requirements on openness are not as strict as those at Wikidata.
(2) Building on that survey of data sources, we will analyse underlying motivations for
sharing  data  openly,  in  order  to  distil  best  practices  and  provide  recommendations,
conscious of existing barriers to sharing. The sharing of data and other resources is an
integral part of research endeavours. In the Web age, most new research objects are
digital, and many legacy ones are being digitized. Once digital, they can be easily shared
over the Web, and from there, it is technically only a very small step towards opening them
up for reuse by a potentially global and cross-disciplinary audience. Socially, this step is
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
31

significant, and few incentives beyond altruism exist for institutions, research groups or
individuals to fully embrace openness. Mid- to long-term effects of openness have been the
subject of prior investigations that established, for instance, citation advantages for open
access articles or for publications associated with open data or open source software. The
situation is much less clear for immediate and short-term benefits, but if such benefits
exist, an analysis of best practices around them can help harness their potential for data
providers, the wider research community, and society at large. As one of the founding
signatories of the Bouchout Declaration for Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management
(along with associate partners Plazi and Pensoft), MfN has a special interest in these
issues, and as the coordinator of this project that is centred around data sharing, a special
responsibility.
This activity is thus concerned with identifying benefits that accrue to those who share their
research openly, as laid out in the Bouchout Declaration, but not limited to the field of
biodiversity research. For instance, it has been suggested “that data sharing, especially
sharing data through an archive, leads to many more times the publications than not
sharing data.” Similarly, institutional data sharing has been associated with “becom[ing] a
canonical reference  point.”  We  will  also  analyse  potential  pitfalls  associated  with  not
sharing data openly, again a case that could help build momentum behind the Bouchout
Declaration and similar initiatives. For instance, many paintings from heritage collections
are not available online through the respective institution but in a multitude of variations
from other sources, to the point that it becomes next to impossible to discern properties
that these digital representations may have in commons with the original. In those cases,
the above-mentioned reference point is missing. The wider societal framework in which
institutions operate may affect openness too, e.g. through legislation, trade negotiations, or
a competitor’s openness. We will take this into account in providing recommendations for
data sharing policies, focusing on the institutional and European levels. A final role of the
survey is to highlight barriers to the use of Wikidata in research contexts, to suggest
measures to lower or overcome those barriers within the framework of the use cases, and
to  identify  data  sharing  communities  whose  curation  workflows  might  benefit  from
integration into Wikidata, as prototyped by Encyclopedia of Life or WikiPathways and
addressed in T4.4.

Objectives 
The aim of this WP is to connect research workflows directly with the Wikidata knowledge
base (T4.1). To this end, research laboratories will collaborate directly with the Wikidata
community of contributors (T4.2 and T4.3). A platform will be created, where research
laboratories or organisations can work on data partly in a private environment and partly in
the shared open environment, while at the same time increasing the amount of work that
occurs as open science. The interface for direct work of scientists on Wikidata will be
improved with the goal to curate information directly in lab tools. A better synergy between
citizen  scientists  (T4.4),  professional  scientific  researchers  and  professional  research
organisations will increase the quality of the data available for all (T4.5). As examples, the
tasks will help to plan the future use Wikidata as a VRE in research organisations.
Description of work (Lead WDME; Month 1-36)
Task 4.1 Wikidata as Linked Open Data (Lead UPM; UPS; Month 1-36)
This task will provide a data interchange mechanism between Wikidata and Wiki4R tools.
The classes and properties will initially be those defined by Wikidata and later those added
in T2.2. This mechanism will be used to provide a query endpoint (based on SPARQL),
such that a data curator can change information on Wikidata and query and reuse it via
SPARQL in Wiki4R. During this task, we will develop:
•
Export information from parts or all of Wikidata as RDF in near real time (as fast as
technically achievable) (UPM)
•
Provide a SPARQL endpoint (UPM) 
•
Establish  a  mechanism  for  syncing  the  information  between  multiple  Wiki4R
instances (see Fig. 1, first specification UPS + UPM / implementation & deployment
UPM)
•
Package  this  Wiki4R  mirroring  mechanism  in  virtual  machines  (at  least  one
instance in the Wikimedia Labs’ cloud and one in the UPS cloud ) and check their
interoperability using Tests For TripleStores 
•
Support researchers in creating their own unit tests, to check the quality of the data
automatically (see T3.3) and establish a continuous delivery workflow (UPS)
Table 5. 
WP4 - Enabling the use of Wikidata in research contexts
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
33

The aim is to create a standard workflow for the quick installation of a Wiki4R SPARQL
endpoint in an institutional cloud where:
•
the data can be reused without performance or interoperability problems,
•
errors and inconsistencies in Wikidata’s data can be detected (cf. T3.3), and 
•
information can be updated on Wikidata at least manually (errors, additions)
Task 4.2 Editing Wikidata via the Wikibase API (Lead UPS; all partners; Month 1-26)
Building on the mirroring mechanism developed in T4.1, the scientists’ own tools will allow
them to edit via the Wikidata API and reuse the updated information directly from within
their research workflows. The task will build on an existing OAuth scheme for remote
editing of Wikidata . It will be configured such that relevant Wikidata policies are honoured,
without requiring researchers to know every detail of these policies. Special attention will
be  paid  to  proper  provenance  and  data  citation  (in  collaboration  with  T3.2).  The
development  of  research  tools  where  scientists  can  edit  Wikidata  from  within  their
workflows  will  be  tested  by  scientific  researchers  using  a  large  number  of  chemical
analytical methods and techniques.
Task 4.3 Wikidata identifiers in the lab (Lead UPS; all partners; Month 10-28) 
This task will integrate the functionality of an existing laboratory database portal developed
by UPS into Wiki4R to provide a test case for Wiki4R. It will inform the design of Wiki4R
research workflows and of applying Open Science and Linked Open Data principles on the
basis of Wiki4R. Use cases, from across the laboratories of UPS, in which research
workflow tools require semantic identifiers for materials, procedures, instruments or other
facilities, will be explored. A major goal is to enhance the reproducibility and transparency
of research by integrating a semantic documentation. One use case in analytical chemistry
will be selected to be prototyped. In conjunction with outreach activities and building on the
results of T3.3, the final result will be a report on the place of Wikidata in science and the
role of science in Wikidata.
Task 4.4 Citizen science (Lead MfN; MfN; Month 13-36) 
The Wiki4R VRE is uniquely positioned to serve citizen science projects. This task will
explore  ways  to  (1)  involve  the  Wikidata  community  with  the  curation  of  scientific
knowledge bases, (2) connect Wikidata to external crowd collaboration projects with a
scientific focus.(1) We will extend the community curation approaches employed by the
Gene Wiki and Rfam/Pfam projects to other areas: building on the outcomes of WP3 (T3.3 
in particular), as well as on past collaborations (e.g. with the Encyclopedia of Life and
WikiPathways ), we will work with a small group of professional research communities that
are already sharing their data openly to explore how their curation workflows might benefit
from a citizen science component integrated with the Wikidata platform and community.
This will include MfN groups along with the laboratories partnering in T4.3 to explore the
use of Wikidata identifiers in the lab, and communities using Wikibase in their curation
workflows, e.g. the EAGLE project. (2) Starting with citizen science projects identified in
T3.3 as suitable for integration with Wikidata, we will work on integrating the workflows on
34
Mietchen D et al.

those platforms with those on Wikidata. The work is based on appropriate property profiles
(T2.1),  mappings  to  suitable  external  vocabularies  or  ontologies  (T3.1),  and  quality
assurance mechanisms as identified in T3.2.
To illustrate how this might look like, consider the classical case of a curator on Galaxy Zoo
being presented an image of a galaxy and tasked with the assessment of whether that
galaxy is elliptical, spiral or neither. Depending on the assessment of that curator or of
multiple curators on Galaxy Zoo, the corresponding Wikidata item for that galaxy could
then be created or updated as to whether it is an instance of an elliptical or spiral galaxy. At
the same time, other metadata about the galaxy could be imported from Galaxy Zoo or its
sources, while the image that the Galaxy Zoo curator had seen would go onto Wikimedia
Commons, with automated classification on the basis of that metadata, annotations of the
objects visible in the image, and a statement on that galaxy’s Wikidata item that the galaxy
is  depicted  in  that  image  on  Wikimedia  Commons.  Subsequent  rounds  of  galaxy
classification – e.g. targeted at students of astronomy or image analysis – could then be
built to decide which subtype of elliptical galaxies that particular galaxy belongs to (e.g. cD
galaxy ).
Such classification tools have already been prototyped as Wikidata games, allowing for
instance  to  annotate  Wikidata  items  about  species  with  corresponding  images  from
Wikimedia Commons, or items about people with statements about their gender, or items
about books with statements about their authors. These prototypes can in principle be
played on both desktop and mobile devices, and they produce statistics that could be fed
into the calculation of altmetrics. We will work to develop these prototypes further for a
subset of our use cases (e.g. animal migration, or identification keys for minerals or animal
sounds), closely align them with the quality assurance measures proposed in T2.3 and
integrate their use into the outreach and training activities in WP5, especially the tutorials
developed in T5.3, the MOOC in T5.5, and the training events in T5.7.
Task 4.5: Wikidata for cultural heritage (Lead EF; MfN; Month 13-36) 
This task will explore ways in which researchers in cultural heritage (and digital humanities
in general) and the Wikidata community can better interact in the aggregation and curation
of cultural heritage information. Using focussed subsets of data from Wikidata (through
WP3), Wikimedia Commons, and Wikisource, the task will engage with researchers within
the digital humanities to define use cases. The present coverage and quality of Wikidata
content for these use cases will assessed, and, building on existing Wikidata tools and
metadata games, new metadata games supporting rich semantic annotation will created.
Towards the end of the project, the use of the Wikidata in different research scenarios will
be easier, so as to provide a good basis for wider adoption across the cultural sector.
The subsets will focus on audio recordings, historic newspapers, and World War I, themes,
where the collections provided by the Europeana Foundation have excellent depth. Audio
recordings are an important topic at the MfN, which houses one of the largest animal
sound archives, and are at the core of activities of MusicBrainz, an associate partner of the
project.

Objectives 
The objectives of this work package are to disseminate not just the results but the process
behind building and using this VRE to communities of relevant stakeholders, especially the
research and Wikidata communities (T5.1) and to engage with these stakeholders around
using Wikidata as a Virtual Research Environment and how to collaborate within that
framework (open licenses, WikiProjects, cross-cultural issues), and to provide training for
that (T5.2-T5.5).
Description of work 
Task 5.1: Dissemination and community engagement (Lead MfN; all partn.; Month
1-36)
Each partner will, within this task and over the project lifetime, actively contribute to the
publication of articles and to presentations in seminars, workshops and conferences,
based on project rationale, methodology, and outputs of the project. We will also use social
media to that effect. Besides these classical dissemination channels, the open nature of
the project allows to offer an additional and more profound layer of dissemination, one that
conveys not just the results of the project, but the process behind achieving them, and
even the option of contributing. This applies to content, software, data, policies, reports and

Nurturing communities of users is one of the key challenges for VREs. We will address this
by a) engaging with the existing Wikidata community about research-related matters, b)
engaging with the research community about Wikidata-related matters and c) bringing the
two together. For example, UPS will organize special days where their scientists will learn
how to use wikis – and Wikidata in particular – for collaboration. These events will also be
used to test the user-friendliness of the platform, in conjunction with T4.3.Inspired by
existing attempts to couple journal articles and Wikipedia contributions (see description of
the Gene Wiki), we will also explore ways in which something similar could be achieved
with Wikidata. The three journals published by MfN would be a candidate here, as would
the Biodiversity Data Journal published by associate partner Pensoft.
Task 5.2: Development of tutorials (Lead UOC; all partners; Month 1-24)
Development of different tutorials for WP2 (semantic mapping), WP3 (“Integrating research
resources with Wikidata”) and WP4 (“Enabling the use of Wikidata in research contexts”)
as well as on the benefits of and barriers to openness that will be identified in T3.3. These
tutorials should be available online under terms compatible with reuse on Wikimedia
platforms. They would focus on text and video recordings but also make use of tools like
the Wikidata games to inform about key features of the site and its operation. They will
both  provide  new  training  resources  for  participants  and  improve  already  existing
documentation on Wikidata.
Task 5.3: Development of course materials (Lead UOC; all partners; Month 1-30) The
goal of this task is to develop freely available materials that can be used in university
courses and on Wikimedia platforms, so future skilled workers will make best use of the
open-data infrastructure provided by Wikidata and other organizations. The intention is to
provide materials for a number of different data usage scenarios. This might range from
simple data retrieval to more complex treatments of data-sets like GIS and machine
learning.  The  material  will  be  available  online,  e.g.  via  Wikiversity,  where  UPS  has
organized such courses in the past. It will be kept up to date, and translated into at least
two European languages in addition to English. It will be suitable for injection into graduate
and postgraduate coursework, but also suitable for on-the-job-training. This task will be
carried out in conjunction with WP2 (mapping), WP3 (integrating resources via Wikidata)
and WP4 (Wikibase tools), since materials will be mostly designed from their respective
outcomes.  Teaching  materials  will  be  mostly  in  text  form,  adding  some  educational
treatment and providing practical exercises and self-assessment tools. Specific tasks will
be:  compilation  of  source  materials,  writing,  adding  educational  treatment,  reviewing
materials by consortium partners as well as the Wikidata community, editing, translation,
and open publishing.
Task 5.4: Development of a MOOC (Lead UOC; all partners; Month 1-36) Development
of  a  MOOC  (Massive  Online  Open  Course)  that  will  be  based  on  Wikidata,  tightly
integrated with other Wikimedia platforms, and include different learning paths according to
the background and interests of participants. Specific steps in this task are: a) gathering
and adapting existing resources about Wikidata and about our own project; b) designing
and developing new resources for the course, including audiovisual resources – this could
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
37

be partly done through Wikiversity using tools like Quiz extension or interactive approaches
like those used in the Wikipedia Adventure ; c) designing and developing assignments,
exercises and assessment procedures; d) adapting all educational resources to an open
platform for MOOCs; delivering the course (about 6 weeks); e) evaluating the course
performance (through participation data and a survey to all participants).
Task  5.5:  Organization  of  training  events ( Lead  UM;  all  partners;  Month  1-36)
Organization of training events on all aspects of Wikidata for research. These training
events will be targeted, basically, at a) researchers – those based at partner institutions in
the  project,  those  participating  in  other  EU-funded  research  projects,  and  those
participating in citizen science projects, b) Wikimedians involved in Wikidata and other
Wikimedia projects. Special attention will be paid to the subsets of both groups that are
developers, as well as to their intersection, with the aim of expanding the ways in which
Wikidata can be used, and nurturing communities of actual users. Some of the events will
also be held at different conferences relevant to the project.

Inter-relation of the main components of the project (Fig. 4) 
Management structure and procedures
Organisational structure and decision-making
For implementing the project, the Wiki4R Consortium will initially comprise 7 partners from
4 EU member states. The project duration is planned as a period of three years (36
months).A  project  of  this  small  complexity  and  scale  requires  an  appropriate
management structure and will be implemented by the project coordinator (MfN) within
WP1 (Coordination and management). These structures as well as the decision making
processes will be established according to the following principles:
•
due consideration of the equality and collective responsibility of all participants,
•
greatest possible transparency of the overall management, and decision making
processes,
•
ensuring compliance with all relevant provisions and regulations of the European
Commission (EC),
•
providing for cost efficiency and professional administration,

•
realization of effective sound monitoring and quality management,
•
undertaking research according to best scientific practices.
The proposed coordination structure for Wiki4R is based on long management experiences
gained  from  other  research  projects  and  networks  with  similar  requirements.  The
coordination and management structure for Wiki4R will be composed of the following core
elements:
•
General Assembly (GA)
•
Steering Committee (SC)
•
Project Coordinator (PC)
•
Advisory Board (AB) 
Their interrelationship and the overall Wiki4R management structures are illustrated by Fig.
5. The management bodies, their composition, responsibilities, scope of decision-taking
power, and working procedures will be described in detail in the Consortium Agreement to
be signed by all partners. It will be each partner’s general responsibility to undertake all
reasonable endeavours to perform and fulfil, promptly, actively, and on time, all of its
obligations under the Grant Agreement and the Consortium Agreement as well as their
tasks within the work packages according to their role in the Consortium including the
submission of the deliverables as described in the proposal. The following structures and
mechanisms will be essential elements for efficient management of the entire project.

submission of the deliverables as described in the proposal. The following structures and
mechanisms will be essential elements for efficient management of the entire project.
General Assembly
The entire Wiki4R partnership is represented in the General Assembly (GA), which is the
ultimate  decision  making  body for  the  consortium.  The  GA  comprises  all  project
partners, who are also eligible to vote on propositions presented to the GA. Each partner to
the consortium sends one official representative and has one vote. The GA will be
chaired by the Project Coordinator.
Decisions taken by the GA primarily generally relate to:
•
budget-related matters,
•
periodic activity reports and financial reports,
•
periodic activity reports and financial reports,
•
acceptance and addition of new partners,
•
if required, exclusion of partners, updating the work plan, and modification of the
Consortium Agreement.
If voting is required, decisions shall be taken by a majority of two-thirds (2/3) of the votes,
unless otherwise provided in the Consortium Agreement. The GA can also appoint an
equity liaison person who will be in charge of gender equity issues and will, if needed,
take on the function of ombudsperson in case of conflict resolution between individuals.
42
Mietchen D et al.

Ordinary GA meetings will take place once a year in conjunction with major community
events, such as Wikimania, Wikimedia Hackathons, or GLAM-Wiki meetings.
Steering Committee
The Wiki4R Steering Committee (SC) is the main coordinating body for the ongoing
project execution and its performance in compliance with the work plan. The Steering
Committee will work on behalf of the General Assembly, and regularly report to the GA on
interim decisions taken and other items of interest. Ordinary SC meetings are to be held at
least twice a year, and the SC will coordinate work inter-seasonally by conference calls or
other means. Ordinary SC members are the Coordinator and the Work Package Leaders
(WPL). The Coordinator shall chair all meetings of the SC, unless decided otherwise by the
General Assembly. The Steering Committee will strive to work by consensus. In case of
need of voting, decisions shall be taken by a majority of two-thirds (2/3) of the votes,
unless otherwise provided in the Consortium Agreement. Each member of the SC will have
one vote, and in case of equal votes the chair will have a casting vote. The Steering
Committee is primarily responsible for supporting the Project Coordinator in fulfilling the
legal and contractual obligations towards the European Commission by monitoring and
controlling the efficient implementation of the project’s objectives and work programme,
on the basis of regular, 6-monthly financial and activity reports from each of the work
packages. The SC will also provide for risk management and consider applying appropriate
rules on “intervention measures“ in case of significant delays or breach of obligations
(details  of  this  will  be  made  explicit  in  the  Consortium  Agreement),  and  conflict
management within the consortium.
Project Coordinator 
The Project Coordinator (PC) is the intermediary between the Wiki4R consortium and
the European Commission and is responsible for the overall management of the project,
including the submission of reports and achievement of the deliverables. He ensures
compliance by the partners with the contractual obligations in all activities of the project.
The Project Coordinator has a right of veto in the case of decisions conflicting with the EC
Grant Agreement at the General Assembly and at the Steering Committee. The coordinator
will administer the EC financial contribution in accordance with the Grant Agreement,
and the decisions taken by the consortium via the General Assembly.
The Wiki4R consortium will be led by the Museum für Naturkunde – Leibniz Institute for
Evolution and Biodiversity Science (MfN). The project coordinator will be supported in this
function by an Administrative Project Manager. This person will be in charge of day-to-
day administration including the detailed contractual and budget management, financial
controlling, and reporting.
The MfN is one of the World's leading natural history collections and research institutions
and  holds  competence  in  areas  of  biodiversity  and  environmental  research,  from
biogeography and taxonomy to information management, climate change, and advising
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
43

environmental policy. The museum has a staff of about 250 persons, an annual budget of
about € 22M (2013), and it is currently undergoing a period of significant expansions and
renovation. In 2009, the MfN was re-constituted as a Foundation under public law and
became a member of the Leibniz Association, one of Germany´s four leading research
organizations. The balance sheet and the accountancy of the MfN are checked annually by
an independent external auditor.
External funding is handled by the Third Party Funds Department, which manages more
than  100  externally  funded  projects,  among  them  several  EC-funded  projects  (e.g.,
coordinating EU BON (Co. 308454), and as Partner in SYNTHESYS 3 (Co. 312253),
OpenUp! (Co. 270890), European Creative (Co.325120), pro-iBiosphere (Co. 312848) and
other FP7 finished projects.
The MfN has its own Bureau of Media Communication, which maintains regular contact
with different media, politicians, and scientific organizations, and will be a valuable support
mechanism for public outreach, and the broader dissemination of the project´s results.
Finally, the Project Coordinator will also be supported by the EU Liaison Office of the
Leibniz-Association in Brussels. The office will advise the Coordinator and his team in
any EU policy related issues as well as in relevant administrative questions concerning
Horizon2020.
Work Package Leaders
Each Work Package will have one designated Work Package Leader (WPL), who is taking
on this role in addition to his/her role as an individual partner to the project. WP leaders
report to the Project Coordinator. They are appointed by the institutions designated to lead
the WP have sound scientific background and wide management experience to guide the
respective WP and tasks, and to ensure performance and progress of the work with regard
to project deliverables and milestones. In particular, WP leaders will be responsible for:
•
effective  communication  between  members of  the  WP  and  to  the  Steering
Committee, 
•
for effective (within designated resources) and timely (within designated deadlines)
completion of work, milestones, and deliverables
•
any activities, deliverables and information as relevant to other partners or the
consortium as a whole;
•
quality control and technical management, i.e. the coordination and monitoring
on a day-to-day basis of progress of the individual work package and its task,
including;
•
delivering interim activity reports i.e. referring to work progress and budget-
development,  and  alerting  in  case  of  delay  or  default  and  if  necessary  with
suggestions for the solution of possible challenges and problems.
The following WPL have been assigned and agreed: Table 9.

Advisory Board
The main role of the Advisory Board (AB) will be to help to guarantee the delivery of high
scientific and technical quality output from the project, and to ensure that the project
partners will not become isolated within their own thinking and perceptions. In that function,
the AB will act as a constant internal review mechanism, advising independently with both
quality control and risk management. While generally being asked on views and advice on
specific issues, the AB will be free to express its opinion on any aspect of the project’s
activity and performance.
The  AB  will  also  advise  on  the  outreach  to  the  wider  scientific  and  stakeholder
communities not directly  involved  in the  project  and  for  benefiting  from  independent,
external expertise. The AB will be established at the beginning of the project.
The AB may call on additional experts on an ad hoc basis, should the need arise. For the
full duration of the project, members of the AB are expected to be available who can be
contacted at any time for specific questions. The AB will primarily advise and work with the
Project Coordinator and Steering Committee, but deliver its main reports to the General
Assembly. For its work, the AB will also liaise with the internal project working groups.
Consortium Agreement and IPR management
A Consortium Agreement (CA) will be developed and signed by all partners, which will set
out in detail the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities of participants to each other and to the
consortium. In addition to detailed provisions for consortium organization and governance,
it will include recommendations for equality and gender issues, Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR), data exchange, use of software and other resources within the project, promoting
open access and free sharing of information. It will be based on the DESCA model for
Horizon2020  projects,  and  include  relevant  provisions  to  also  ensure  quality  control.
Conflict Management resolutions will also be addressed in detail in the CA.

Communication within the Consortium and Project Meetings
Active  communication  process will  be  installed  to  ensure  internal  coherence,  and
effectiveness in the daily exchange of information and cooperation for all consortium
partners. It will be the responsibility of the Coordinator to facilitate efficient communication
for the project, which will rely on the following mechanisms:
•
email  correspondence  as  the  primary  means  of  day-to-day  communication,
including use of mailing lists and electronic discussion forums for the project and
individual communities,
•
regular conferences, using internet-based video conferencing tools,
•
communication through the project web- platform.
In addition frequent and regular meetings at various levels are regarded as key to the
success of projects such as Wikidata for research, and for developing a good and lasting
network of networks. The following Table 10 lists relevant meetings to take place during
the course of the project.

With an open and agile development model, we will be

work on Wiki4R beyond the project duration is already
anticipated.

This is a hard-to-assess problem depending on many

Wiki4R, addressing both professional and citizen
scientists, is probably unique in that a huge community in
terms of citizen scientists is already there, i.e. citizens
volunteering their spare time to curate data. We cannot
guarantee yet a huge community of professional
scientists, as we are focussing on pilots. For these pilots,
however, the participation is already secured. While not
endangering the Wiki4R project itself, lack of
professional adoption beyond pilots would destroy its
impact. The work plan is therefore carefully planned with
this in mind and significant resources are invested in
training and capacity building to make this less likely.

Consortium as a whole
The consortium brings together seven partners whose core competencies span the major
branches of the natural sciences and into the information sciences as well as the cultural
and natural heritage sector, and civil society. 
With the exception of WP1, all partners are involved in all work packages, which ensures
effective interaction beyond meetings or formal communications.
The profiles of the partners are distinct, but overlap in a systematic fashion: 
•
UPM, WMDE, UM and UPS are all providers of semantic technologies, and while
UPM and WMDE work across disciplines, they are distinguished by a focus on
automated techniques (UPM) and community-supporting platforms (WMDE). Both
are highly involved across WP2-4.
•
Similarly, while both UM and UPS work in chemistry, the former bridges towards
computational chemistry and biology, the latter towards experimental chemistry and
the physical sciences. UM focuses on the integration of information into Wikidata
(WP3), UPS on the reuse of information from Wikidata (WP4).
•
UPM, UM and UPS are campus universities, whereas the fourth university in the
consortium, UOC, is a virtual university. UOC will thus focus on the virtual training
aspects, with UM and UPS contributing. All partners except UOC will organize on-
site  training  events,  and  all  partners  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  course
materials as well as to dissemination and community engagement (WP5).
•
UOC  has  in  the  past  performed  research  on  the  use  of  Wikipedia  in  higher
education. Its participation in the other work packages thus will not only inform the
training activities in WP5 but also a new line of research on the use of Wikidata in
higher education.
•
EF is a data provider and as such involved in WP3, but its focus within the project
is on exploring the potential of using Wikidata in cultural heritage contexts (WP4),
together with MfN; this builds on prior collaboration in former EU projects like
OpenUp!
•
Beyond its coordinator role, MfN provides multiple aspect of biological expertise. It
is involved in all work packages, as a data provider (WP3), data re-user (WP4) and
use case provider for the semantic modelling (WP2). Use cases are from biology
(e.g. taxa), mineralogy, as well as cultural history (historic records). Citizen science
is  transdisciplinary.  Finally,  it  addresses  sustainability  issues  in  “Optimizing
openness” (T3.3), which builds the foundation for future projects of this kind.
Most but not all of the key personnel have contributed to Wikidata in the past, and all are
experienced in EU research projects.
The partners are complemented by 17 associate partners, as detailed in section 4.3 of the
proposal.

Mietchen D et al.

Most of them are based within the European Research Area, but some (Scripps,
MetaBrainz and Center for Open Science) in the US. As a group, their expertise goes well
beyond  that  of  the  consortium  and  covers  areas  ranging  from  genetics  to  music
technology, from history to mathematics, from data mining to publishing, libraries and
repositories. They also cover the value chain from basic research to applied research to
scholarly societies and professional bodies, from non-profit to startup, from botanic garden
to universities.
They will provide use cases or data, advice on semantic modelling, data integration or data
reuse within their fields, their countries or for their languages, they will help engage their
respective communities, and they will contribute to training and dissemination activities.
Importantly, the associate partners will also serve as seeds for follow-ups to Wiki4R: our
proposal is openly licensed and intended to be forked, so as to help build an ecosystem of
Wiki4R projects and initiatives that are linked on the one hand to Wikidata either directly or
through  the  infrastructure  we  will  build,  and  on  the  other  hand  to  their  respective
communities.
Resources to be committed
In consideration of the size of the project, careful attention has been given to a realistic
allocation of the Wiki4R budget among partners, reflecting their respective involvement and
work load in each of the WPs. The budget as presented here has been agreed by the
consortium and all partners.
The total costs of the project amount to 1,553,685.00 Mio €, with an EC-contribution of
1,553,685.00 Mio €. The project will have a duration of 3 years (36 months) and requires
200 person months in total.
The total costs as given in Table 13 relate to the auditable aggregated costs that will be
incurred by all partners, corresponding to the administrative forms.

Human Resources
Personnel costs represent the largest cost category for Wikidata for research, reflecting
the  labour  intensive  RTD  nature  of  the  project.  For  Wikidata  for  research,  mainly
postdoctoral researchers and technical staff will be required and offered positions, mainly
to be recruited from universities and research institutions involved. For the management
tasks, the coordination team will be supported by a 25% project management position to
be paid by the project. In addition, the project will benefit greatly from considerable work
time and support provided in kind by personnel, predominately senior staff of professorial
or equivalent status, from many partner institutions, including several of the WP leads.
Their combined effort and commitment in all areas of the project will add a substantial
number of additional person months and resources, not accounted for in the declared
budget.
Equipment and Consumables
Most  Wiki4R  project  partners  can  and  will  rely  on  their  existing  institutional  ICT
infrastructure and equipment for the project, less than 1% budget has been allocated to
equipment. Additional equipment needed means primarily ICT hardware and software, and
related tools and working stations.
A small amount of the requested budget will be used for consumables. Consumables relate
to the preparation of training materials and tutorials planned under WP5. 2,000€ for Partner
have been planned to cover open access fees. In addition to that, the management budget
Table 14. 
Summary of staff effort
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
53

of the Coordination in WP1 includes an open access fees contingency fund (ca 8,000€)
available to all partners for project-related publications.
Travel costs
Travel costs include mainly attendance of project meetings for the General Assembly,
Steering Committee as well as other for groups and committees as foreseen in the work
plan. WP-Leaders have a budget of 6,000€, whilst the other partners 5,000€ foreseen for
the three years.
The management budget of the Coordination (WP1) includes a travel contingency fund to
allow to cover travel expenses of members or representatives of the Advisory Board and of
the  associate  partners,  as  well  as  for  invitation  of  additional  stakeholders  to  project
meetings.
Sub-contracting
All sub-contracting will follow Horizon 2020 financial guidelines and is related to rules for
awarding contracts according to the principles of best value for money (best price-quality
ratio), transparency, and equal treatment.
Sub-contracting costs refer to those partners with an EC contribution higher than 325k€
that will be subject of financial audits following the financial rules under Horizon 2020.
These audit costs are planned in WP1, under sub-contracting and vary between 2000 and
3000€ per audit for MfN.

Partner 4: Wikimedia Deutschland (WMDE), Germany
Wikimedia Deutschland – Gesellschaft zur Förderung Freien Wissens – is a charitable
non-profit organisation under German Law. Founded in 2004, it is the first and largest
chapter  of  the  Wikimedia  Movement,  as  strong  partner  of  the  US-based  Wikimedia
Foundation and a leader in the free knowledge movement with a membership of 22000+,
70 employees and an annual budget around €5M. WMDE supports Wikimedia projects
such as the German-speaking Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wikisource and others. 
Relevant experience and role in the project 
In 2012, WMDE began developing Wikidata, a free, collaborative, multilingual, secondary
database,  collecting  structured  data  to  provide  support  for  Wikipedia,  Wikimedia
Commons, and other Wikimedia projects. Wikidata has quickly evolved into a structured
data repository with many uses beyond the Wikimedia projects. Since 2012, Wikidata has
quickly gathered a community of more than 1.5 million editors who have so far contributed
about 190 million edits to Wikidata, resulting in the creation of about 13 million data items.
In addition, the potential of beyond-Wikimedia uses has attracted the attention of many
individuals, groups and stakeholders, including the research and science communities. The
“Gene Wiki” and the Wikidata community recently announced that every human gene
Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)
63

(according to the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information) now has a
representative entity on Wikidata. Next steps to support life sciences data in Wikidata are
to establish bots that populate Wikidata with entities representative of two other key
classes: diseases and drugs; and to expand the scope of these bots to include the addition
of statements that link these entities together into a valuable network of knowledge.
In November of 2014, Wikidata received the Open Data Institute’s Open Data Publisher
Award - celebrating “high publishing standards and use of challenging data“. In December
of 2014, Google announced that all the data in Freebase will be migrated to Wikidata and
that Freebase will be wound down: “We believe strongly in a robust community-driven
effort to collect and curate structured knowledge about the world, but we now think we can
serve  that  goal  best  by  supporting  Wikidata  --  they’re  growing  fast,  have  an  active
community, and are better-suited to lead an open collaborative knowledge base.” With this,
Wikidata has become the premier structured data base project, uniquely positioned to
serve as a repository for research data as well.
Wikimedia  Deutschland  will  be  the  leader  for  WP4,  Enabling  the  use  of  Wikidata  in
research contexts. WMDE will support the project in developing a SPARQL endpoint to
enable easy access to the data in Wikidata for researchers and make Wikidata follow
established standard procedures of the semantic web.

The  Data  group  at  CDS  develops  a  Data  as  a  Service  platform  which  goals  and
technologies are closely related to the project. The future platform will interconnect all the
data of laboratories amongst themselves but also with the scientific information on the
Web.  Wikidata  has  already  become  a  major  focus  point  to  openly  share  scientific
information on the Web and so, it will play a major role in the future platform of CDS. 
CDS includes the Machine Learning and Optimization team (AO), a joint team of INRIA/
CNRS/University Paris Sud. The team has been participating and taking a leading role in
several EU-projects (PASCAL, SYMBRION, CITINES, MASH, EGEE/EGI) as well as in
national  industry-oriented  projects  such  as  TIMCO  (Technologies  for  In-Memory
Computing). 
Its role in the project will be to experiment the manners to reuse and to complete the
information of Wikidata in the tools of laboratories (WP4). The aim is to start to build in the
university a unified research area open to the world. Moreover, it will establish links with
the ongoing effort of the EGI.eu foundation towards open science as described in the Open
Science Commons whitepaper. 
Profile of the personnel 
Dr. Cécile Germain (f) is a full professor of Computer Science. She is a member of the
Machine Learning and Optimization team (AO), a joint team of INRIA/CNRS/University
Paris Sud. Her research interests are in Machine Learning and its applications to e-science
and autonomic computing. As the policy officer of University Paris Sud for Scientific
Computing and chair of the Data group in CDS, she has extensive experience with the
scientific data systems at all scales, including international scientific collaborations in High
Energy Physics. Current relevant projects are the Center for Data Science, EGI.eu and
TIMCO.  She  has  initiated  and  leads  the  Grid  Observatory  initiative  (http://www.grid-
observatory.org),  a  digital  curation  facility  for  the  digital  assets  of  the  EGI  flagship
European grid for computer science and engineering. She is also involved in the design of
interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including the recent HiggsML challenge. 
Karima Rafes (f) is a researcher at the Center for Data Science of Paris-Saclay and she
started a thesis related to Linked Data. Her expertise is research about the Semantic Web
since 2007. She developed the LinkedWiki tool for MediaWiki; and in the CDS project, she
researched pragmatic solutions to help laboratories integrate the latest Cloud and Linked
Data technologies in their workflows.

Significant infrastructure 
The Virtual Data computing centre located at the Orsay campus of University Paris Sud is
a joint facility with other regional institutions. This top-level infrastructure (PUE 1.3) is
currently designed for 400KW IT, and will be extended up to 1.5MW IT in the next seven
years. It hosts ~ 4000 cores and 500TB of disk storage. It includes a tier2-node of the EGI
grid and a 1000 cores cloud using the IaaS technology developed in the FP7 StratusLab
project. Extensions are planned in 2015-2016 to include resources dedicated to database
operations (project OpenData@UPSud), with 100TB of storage and in-memory computing
facilities.
