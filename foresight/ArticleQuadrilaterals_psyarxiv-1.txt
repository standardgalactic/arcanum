Abstract 
Among primates, humans are special in their ability to create and manipulate highly elaborate 
structures of language, mathematics or music. Here, we show that this sensitivity to abstract 
structure is already present in a much simpler domain: the visual perception of regular 
geometric shapes such as squares, rectangles or parallelograms. We asked human subjects to 
5 
detect an intruder shape among six quadrilaterals. Although the intruder was always defined by 
an identical amount of displacement of a single vertex, the results revealed a geometric 
regularity effect: detection was considerably easier when either the base shape or the intruder 
was a regular figure comprising right angles, parallelism or symmetry, than a more irregular 
shape. This effect was replicated in several tasks and in all human populations tested, including 
10 
uneducated Himba adults and French preschoolers. Baboons, however, showed no such 
geometric regularity effect, even after extensive training. Baboon behavior was captured by 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but neither CNNs nor a variational auto-encoder 
captured the human geometric regularity effect. However, a symbolic model, based on exact 
properties of Euclidean geometry, closely fitted human behavior. Our results indicate that the 
15 
human propensity for symbolic abstraction permeates even elementary shape perception. They 
suggest a new putative signature of human singularity, and provide a novel challenge for non-
symbolic models of human shape perception.

Among primates, humans are unique in their ability to develop formal symbolic systems 
that capture regularities in the external world, such as the language of mathematics. A great 
variety of non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to account for human singularity, 
including the emergence of evolved mechanisms for social competence (1), pedagogy (2), 
10 
natural language (3, 4), or recursive structures across multiple domains such as language, music 
and mathematics (5–8). Unfortunately, few experimental paradigms, mostly in the domain of 
artificial grammar learning, afford a direct comparison of human and non-human primate 
behavior using the same methods (9–14). Here, we present experimental investigations of the 
differences between humans and baboons in the domain of geometry, and more specifically, 
15 
the visual perception of quadrilaterals such a square, a rectangle or a parallelogram. We show 
that all humans, regardless of culture or education, are sensitive to the presence of geometric 
regularities such as right angles, parallelism or symmetry, and perform very differently from 
baboons in an elementary visual perception task. 
Prehistorical records suggest that the human appeal for geometric shapes is as ancient 
20 
as humanity itself. Circles, squares and spirals are omnipresent in human art and architecture.

The earliest engravings attributed to Homo sapiens, consisting of a triangular mesh of parallel 
lines, are estimated to be ~73000 years old (15). Even Homo erectus already drew abstract 
patterns ~540,000 years ago (16). Paleoanthropologists do not question the human origins of 
such drawings because, when given the opportunity to draw, other non-human primates never 
produce structured figures (17). By contrast, the diversity and abstraction of young children’s 
5 
drawings are striking (18, 19). Prior research has established that even preschoolers and adults 
with no formal education from the Amazon already possess sophisticated intuitions for 
geometry (20, 21) forming an intuitive mathematical “language of thought” (22). Those prior 
results suggest, but do not prove, that humans possess a much deeper level of understanding 
of the abstract properties of geometry than other primates. Here, our goal was to design a 
10 
simple empirical test capable of probing this hypothesis. 
We reasoned that if humans are spontaneously attuned to the major properties of 
Euclidean geometry (lines, length, parallelism, perpendicularity, symmetry) and their 
combinations, then they might exhibit a geometric regularity effect, with a better and faster 
perception of regular shapes, such as a square, than of irregular ones. Indeed, several previous 
15 
experiments, both within and outside the domain of geometry, have shown that whenever 
regularities are present, humans use them to compress information in working memory and 
achieve a smaller “minimal description length”, thus facilitating memorization, anticipation and 
outlier detection (22–26). Crucially, a shape perception test could be simple enough to probe 
the sensitivity of both human and non-human primates to the same mathematical properties. 
20 
We opted for the intruder test, where a participant must simply find the outlier shape within a 

 
5 
 
set of six, and which has been previously used to explore human intuitions of geometry (20, 
27).  
Results 
Design of the geometric intruder task. We selected 11 quadrilaterals ranging from perfect 
regularity (a square, with its four right angles, parallel lines and equal sides) to full irregularity 
5 
(an arbitrary quadrilateral devoid of any of these properties) (Fig. 1A; exact shapes described in 
supplementary table T1).  For each such reference shape, four deviant versions were generated 
by changing the position of the bottom-right vertex by a constant distance, either along the 
bottom side or along a circle centered on the bottom-left vertex (thus violating either distance 
or parallelism). All deviants departed from their reference shape by the same amount, and all 
10 
11 reference shapes were matched for average distances between vertices (see Supplementary 
Online Materials). On each trial of the intruder task, we selected one of the 11 possible 
reference shapes and presented five instances of it, varying in scale and orientation (e.g. 5 
rectangles), together with a single deviant (in this case, a non-rectangle with the bottom-right 
vertex displaced). The location of this outlier was randomized, and six levels of shape rotation 
15 
and shape scale were pseudo-randomly distributed among the six shapes. The participants’ task 
was to click on the outlier shape, as fast and accurately as possible (figure 1B).  
Intruder task in educated adults. In experiment 1, with N = 605 French adults, we observed a 
striking geometric regularity effect: error rates varied dramatically with the reference shape, 
from 2% to 40%, with a consistent ordering from regular to irregular (Fig. 1C; Univariate Type III 
20 
Repeated-Measures ANOVA: F(10, 6040) = 292.88, p < 10-15; explained variance evaluated by 

 
6 
 
the generalized eta squared: η²G= .27). By contrast, the size, rotation and position of the outlier 
had significant but only minor effects (size: F(5, 3020) = 4.46, p = .0005, η²G=.005; rotation: F(5, 
3020) = 21.19, p < .0001, η²G=.021; position: F(5, 3020) = 4.96, p = .0001, η²G=.005). Response 
times were tightly correlated with error rates (linear regression: r² = .92, p < .0001) and 
therefore also exhibited a large geometric regularity effect (Fig. S1). 
5 
In experiment 1, the intruder was always a deviant shape, and was therefore more 
irregular than the reference shape. Thus, participants could have responded by selecting the 
most irregular among the six shapes on display. To avoid this confound, in experiment 2 and all 
subsequent experiments, half of the displays were canonical (five instances of one of the 11 
reference shape, plus a single deviant) and half were swapped (five deviants, identical up to a 
10 
rotation or scale change, plus a single reference shape; see examples in Fig. 1B). As previously, 
participants were simply asked to click on the shape that differed from the others. In a new 
group of N = 117 French adults, the geometric regularity effect was replicated (F(10, 1160) = 
70.96, p < 10-15, η²G=.25), while size, position and rotation effects again had either insignificant 
or very small effects (size: F(5, 580)=2.16, p=.056, η²G=.008 ; rotation: F(5, 580)=9.66, p < .0001, 
15 
η²G=.031; position: F(5,580)=2.26, p=.047, η²G=.008). Response times also yielded a large 
geometric regularity effect (correlation with error rate: r²=.95, p<.00001). Error rates were 
strongly correlated across experiments (r² = .97; p < 10-7; Fig 1.D) and display types (r² = .84; p < 
.0001; Fig. 1.D). 
Subjective ratings of complexity. Three additional experiments investigated the origins of the 
20 
geometric regularity effect. First, we asked whether geometric regularity was cognitively 

 
7 
 
penetrable and could therefore be directly reported using subjective ratings. N = 27 French 
adults rated the subjective complexity and N = 21 rated the subjective regularity of each 
reference shape on a 1-100 scale. Both subjective ratings correlated tightly with error rates in 
the intruder task (complexity r²=.88 and regularity r²=.76; r²=.84 after aggregating the two 
conditions by averaging complexity and 1 – regularity; all p<.0001; Fig. 1E). Since the early 
5 
visual stages of object recognition are largely thought to be cognitively impenetrable (28), the 
finding that humans have correct intuitions that some geometric shapes are simpler than 
others suggesting that this effect arises at a level of representation beyond early vision. 
Visual search. We further tested this idea by probing whether the search for geometric 
regularity engages parallel (“pop-out”) or serial processes. N = 11 French adults engaged in a 
10 
classic task of visual search for an outlier in arrays of 6, 12 or 24 shapes. Response times 
showed that search was always serial, for all 11 shapes, yet with a slope and an error rate that 
again correlated linearly with geometric regularity (p<.0001, r²=0.98; Fig. 2; detailed analysis of 
the effects of number of items and item presence provided in Supplementary Materials). This 
finding shows that the regularity effect does not arise from an early pre-attentive pop-out, even 
15 
for the simplest shapes such as square or rectangle. Rather, geometric shape perception 
involves an attention-dependent stage whose speed increases with geometric regularity. 
Sequential presentation of shapes. As a further test of the perceptual stage at which the 
geometric regularity effect arises, we asked whether this effect would still be present if the 
shapes could not be perceived in one glance, but had to be mentally reconstructed for a 
20 
sequential display of their vertices. N = 16 French adults participated in an experiment in which 

 
8 
 
the shapes were broken down into a sequence of four dots, one for each vertex location, in a 
systematic order. By having the sequence unfold over a time span of 1.8 s, thus largely 
exceeding the time window for integration within the ventral visual recognition system (29, 30), 
our goal was to prevent classical bottom-up shape recognition mechanisms, yet still allow 
subjects to grasp the geometric relationships between the 4 vertices. The experiment was run 
5 
in small blocks, each with reference shapes. In the first six trials of a given block, the four dots 
always traced a fixed quadrilateral (e.g. rectangle), with variations in size and orientation. Then, 
on each subsequent trial, the first 3 dots continued to trace the same quadrilateral (again with 
variations in size and orientation), but on half of the trials the fourth dot was displaced to one 
of the four possible deviants shown in figure 1A. Participants were asked to indicate if the last 
10 
dot was correctly or incorrectly located. Even under this sequential condition, the geometric 
regularity effect was replicated: the error rate still varied dramatically across shapes (F(8, 120) = 
10.1, p<10-9, η²G=.16) and the effect correlated with the geometric regularity effect observed 
for static shapes (r² = .56; p = .02; Fig. 1F). Thus, the effect arises from a level of representation 
where geometric properties can be ascertained even when they are not simultaneously present 
15 
in the stimulus. 
Probing the influence of education: Himbas and young children. We next investigated the 
dependence of the effect on age, education and culture. One possibility is that the effect arises 
from formal education in mathematics, for instance because regular shapes are also familiar, 
nameable, and taught at school. To address this concern, we turned to human populations with 
20 
little or no formal schooling. First, we tested French preschoolers (N=28 kindergarteners; mean 
age 5 years 4 months; range 4:11 to 5:10 ; to shorten the duration of the experiment, children 

 
9 
 
were tested solely with canonical displays; N=156 1st graders were also tested, see 
supplementary materials and Fig. S2 for detailed results). Second, even since those Western 
children could have been introduced with shape names, we also tested 22 uneducated Himba 
adults, a pastoral people of northern Namibia whose language contains no words for geometric 
shapes, receive little or no formal education, and who, unlike French subjects, do not live in a 
5 
carpentered world (31). 
In both populations, the geometric regularity effect was replicated (Fig. 1G and 1H). In 
preschoolers, errors rates varied even more dramatically than in educated French adults across 
the 11 shapes. They remained below 20% for the square and rectangle, ~50% for the iso-
trapezoid, and continued to climb up to 60-70% for more irregular quadrilaterals. The 
10 
correlation of children and French adult performance was strong and remained significant even 
when excluding the two simplest shapes (square and rectangle; Fig. S2D). Similarly, the 
performance of Himba adults varied with geometrical regularity and was correlated with that of 
both French adults (r²=0.55) and French preschoolers (r²=0.59). Both findings converge with 
previous work (20, 22) to suggest that the geometric regularity effect reflects a universal 
15 
intuition of geometry present in all humans and largely independent of formal knowledge, 
language, schooling, and environment. 
Can baboon pass the intruder test? Next, we investigated whether the effect was also present 
in a non-human primate species, the guinea baboon (Papio papio). Baboons’ visual system is 
largely similar to that of humans, and they perform similarly in some shape recognition tasks 
20 
(e.g. ref 25). We capitalized on a large facility where baboons can freely access testing booths 

 
10 
 
with touch screens (33). Twenty-six baboons received individualized training on the intruder 
task, using a great variety of images and textures (Fig. 3). Complete detail of each subject’s 
learning history and performance is provided in Fig. S3 and in Supplementary Materials. A full 
data set was obtained from 20 animals who completed (1) an initial series of training stages on 
the intruder task with 10 non-geometric image pairs, progressively increasing in the number of 
5 
available choices (Fig. 3A; 20 animals reached criterion; average of 5200 trials to criterion, 
range 1000 – 14500); (2) a first generalization to 10 novel non-geometric image pairs, indicating 
that they understood the intruder task (only tested in 18 animals; average = 272 trials, range 
100 – 700); (3) a second generalization to black-and-white geometric shapes, where a simple 
non-geometric parameter sufficed to respond (e.g. pick a small triangle amidst large pentagons; 
10 
average = 220 trials, range 100 – 600); and finally (4) generalization and further retraining with 
the complete set of quadrilaterals identical to human participants (average 6305 trials, range 
704 – 8712). 
Twenty of the 26 animals showed a clear understanding of the intruder task, because 
following training with 20 non-geometric images, they showed immediate first-trial 
15 
generalization to new such images and/or to easily distinguishable polygons (Fig. 3B). However, 
when presented with the 11 quadrilaterals, baboons’ performance collapsed, suggesting that 
they found all of them equally similar (Fig. 3C). Their performance was close to chance on the 
first test block (76.2% errors, SE=1%; chance = 83.3%) and slowly progressed on subsequent 
days. 11 animals continued performing the geometrical task for 8000 trials or more, eventually 
20 
reaching 53% errors (significant deviation [SD]=6.7%) on blocks 81 to 99. Note that this 
performance was comparable to that of the preschoolers and 1st graders, who achieved 

 
11 
 
respectively 51% (SD=14%) and 48% errors (SD=16%). Yet even in the latter blocks, for the 11 
primates who reached that stage and had therefore received consequent training, no geometric 
regularity effect was observed. Although error rates differed across the 11 shapes (F(10, 100) = 
24.68, p<10-14, .0001, η²G=.44), with a consistent ordering across baboons (Fig. S4), they 
correlated weakly and non-significantly with the geometric regularity effect found in human 
5 
populations (Fig. 3C). Rather, their performances were impacted, at least in part, by visual 
properties that had little to no impact on our human participants, such as outlier rotation and 
outlier type (see table T2 for a systematic investigation of the significance and effect size of 
each predictor on each population). Thus, baboons performed poorly with quadrilaterals and 
were insensitive to their geometric regularities. 
10 
Models of human and baboon performance. To shed light on the dissociated performance of 
humans and baboons, we contrasted two classes of models of the intruder task (Fig. 4). The 
first class assumes that quadrilaterals are processed by standard image recognition mechanisms 
in the ventral visual pathway, while the second assumes an additional level of discrete, 
symbolic processing of non-accidental geometrical properties.  
15 
We modeled the ventral visual pathway using CORnet, one of the top-scoring 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) on brain-score.org, a platform that compares 
computational models with behavioral and neural observations (34) (other CNNs gave identical 
results; see Supplementary Online Materials). This model was pre-trained to label photographs 
on ImageNet, a large set of images featuring natural and man-made items. To determine if this 
20 
model could successfully simulate the outlier task, we fed the network, without retraining, with 

 
12 
 
each of the six images actually presented to the participants on a given trial, collected the 
corresponding activation vectors in each CNN layer, and defined as the intruder the image 
whose vector differed most from the mean of the others. When averaging across trials, this 
process yielded a predicted error rate for each shape, separately for each layer in the model. 
A second class of model, capitalizing on the prior demonstration of categorical 
5 
perception for parallels and perpendicularity (27), assumes that quadrilaterals are mentally 
encoded as a symbolic list of discrete geometric properties. For each shape, the model loops 
over all pairs of sides and angles and generates a vector of 0’s and 1’s for the presence or 
absence of equal angles, equal sides, parallelism, and right angles (with a tolerance fitted to 
12.5%, although this parameter had little impact, see Fig. S5). The difficulty of spotting the 
10 
intruder is then predicted to be inversely related to the ℒଵ distance between the symbolic 
vectors coding for the reference and deviant shapes. 
 
Fig. 4C shows the matrix of correlation, over the 11 shapes, between the errors rates for 
each human population, each of the 11 well-trained baboons, and the predictions of the two 
models. Two squares are apparent. First, all baboons are intercorrelated, and their 
15 
performance is well predicted by the last layer of the CNN model, putatively corresponding to 
ventral inferior temporal cortex (IT; mean across animals: r = .81, SE = .03). However, the CNN 
model is a poor predictor of human performance (mean across human groups: r = .48, SE = .10; 
the two distributions are significantly different: t-test, p = .024) and reaches significance only 
for Himbas and preschoolers (p = .005 and p = .048 respectively). Second, conversely, all human 
20 
groups are well predicted by the symbolic model (mean r=.84, SE=.05, see table T3 for a 

 
13 
 
breakdown of the effect of each symbolic property), but that model is a poor predictor of 
baboon behavior (mean r = .44, SE = .04; the two distributions are significantly different: t-test, 
p < .001). 
This double dissociation was confirmed by a two-parameter multiple regression where 
the predictions of the two models were put in competition to predict 44 data points (11 shapes 
5 
x 4 deviants) per population (Fig. 4D). The three experiments with French adults who received 
formal education were almost exclusively captured by the symbolic regressor, and each 
baboon’s data by the neural-network regressor. Interestingly, uneducated populations (Himba 
adults and French preschoolers) showed a significant contribution of both models.  
Thus, the modelling suggests that two strategies are available to solve the intruder task 
10 
and may coexist in humans (31, 35): an early visual capacity, shared with other non-human 
primates, to recognize shapes in the ventral visual pathway and use this code to detect a salient 
deviation in shape; and a higher-level universal human capacity to grasp abstract geometric 
properties. The former may exploit a variety of early and late visual cues, since further analysis 
of the CNN’s performance showed some degree of predictability of the baboons’ behavior by 
15 
the V1 layer already, or by the surface area of the stimuli (Fig. S6). The abstract strategy, 
however, appears out of reach of such simple perceptual models (indeed, without further 
assumptions, the neural networks would have been incapable of passing the sequence version 
of the task, as humans did).  
We verified that several other similar neural networks, such as DenseNet or ResNet, 
20 
were similarly unable to fit human behavior (Fig. S7). It could be argued that the geometric 

 
14 
 
shape fell too far off the training space to elicit uninterpretable results. However, the model 
trained to label the ImageNet dataset did attribute to each geometry shape a highly consistent 
label (mostly “envelopes”; Supplementary Table T4). In order to test the effect of the training 
space, we modified the network with extra output units and trained it to label our reference 
shapes (Fig. S8). Four training strategies were tried, depending on whether we trained the 
5 
network to label all 11 shapes or just the shapes with names in English; and whether all layers 
were allowed to change, or just the final layer (see Supplementary Materials). Nevertheless, all 
four manipulations failed to increase their predictive power of the CNN for any human 
population, and either worsened the predictive power for the baboon behavior, or left it 
unchanged. Since CNNs are far from perfect in capturing human behavior, even for natural 
10 
stimuli(36–38), we also tested Variational Auto-Encoders(39) (VAE), whose architecture 
“compresses” information and may therefore be more suited to the task of encoding regular 
shapes. A classical VAE was successfully trained to encode and decode our reference shapes 
(Fig. S9A). However, it too did not exhibit the geometric regularity effect. First, its loss function 
varied very little across the 11 shapes (Fig. S9B). All shapes were learned similarly across 
15 
training epochs, and the loss did not correlate well with either the human or the baboon 
behavior (Fig. S9C). Second, using the same methodology as for CNNs, we probed whether the 
internal compressed representation of the model could be used to spot the outlier; again, it 
proved to be predictive of neither the humans’ or the baboons’ behavior (Fig. S9D).  
 
20 
Discussion 

 
15 
 
Using the geometric intruder test, regardless of the human populations we tested, we 
observed a replicable geometric regularity effect: finding an intruder amongst six quadrilaterals 
is much easier when either the reference or the deviant shape are highly regular. This effect is 
already present in young children (preschoolers and 1st graders), and was also replicated in 
uneducated adults from a remote non-Western population with reduced access to education, 
5 
suggesting that the effect does not depend on age, culture and education. Additionally, we 
show that this effect is replicable using different presentation modes (by presenting the entire 
shape at once, or the four vertices sequentially) and different tasks (intruder, serial search, or 
subjective complexity rating).  
Given this apparent universality in humans, it is noteworthy that the baboons did not 
10 
share this effect. Their performance was initially quite poor with all quadrilaterals, but even 
when it later improved to the level of human children and showed significant variations across 
shapes, it still did not correlate with the geometrical regularity effect. This striking difference 
occurred even though the baboons clearly understood the demands of the intruder task, having 
reached a threshold of 80% correct or more on a first set of stimuli (where chance is 16.7% 
15 
correct) and then generalized to new non-geometrical stimuli. It also cannot come from a lack 
of motivation: while a few baboons did not complete the training, the twenty on which we 
collected data spontaneously performed an average of 867 geometrical trials per day (1st 
quartile 278 trials, median 641 trials, 3rd quartile 1332 trials).  
An empiricist could argue that the difference was due to the different environments in 
20 
which humans and baboons live. The “carpentered world” hypothesis (40) proposes that an 

 
16 
 
increased sensibility for right angles and parallel lines arises naturally from a Western style of 
life in a world full of rectilinear shapes (objects, buildings, books, etc.). Indeed, this was the 
dominant environment for most of our participants. However, several arguments refute this 
idea. First and foremost, the effect was present in the Himba people, but not in baboons. Yet 
the rural settlements of the Himba are quite unlike industrialized societies and their 
5 
environment is relatively free of rectilinear objects. Conversely, the baboons we tested were 
not wild animals, but grew up and lived in an environment comprising a mixture of natural 
objects (trees and rocks) and man-made, rectilinear objects (buildings, doors, computer 
screen), which was arguably as “carpentered” as the Himbas’ (see illustration in Supplementary 
Materials).  
10 
Second, even in a carpentered world, after projection in two dimensions, irregular 
shapes are arguably more frequent that regular ones on the retina, because the observers are 
rarely perfectly aligned with their environment for a rectilinear projection to occur. 
Parallelograms are also rare in our environment -- and yet they figured among the shapes with 
few errors. Thus, it is not clear how frequency in the environment would explain our result. 
15 
Finally, we directly tested this empiricist hypothesis by training artificial neural networks with a 
dataset (ImageNet) that featured many man-made rectilinear image categories, such as 
envelopes, binders, band-aids or lampshades (labels which they readily applied to our 
quadrilaterals; see table T4). Even more crucially, we retrained them with our geometric shapes 
(see figure S8). Neither types of training sufficed for the neural networks to predict human 
20 
behavior. 

 
17 
 
The dissociated performance of humans and baboons suggests that the intruder task 
can be solved using two strategies: a perceptual strategy, well captured by current neural-
network models of the ventral visual pathway, in which geometric shapes are encoded using 
the same feature space also used to recognize any image (e.g. faces, objects, etc); and a 
symbolic strategy, in which geometric shapes are encoded by their discrete non-accidental 
5 
regularities such as right-angles or parallel sides. The latter strategy seems available to all 
humans, whether in Paris or in rural Namibia. It is tempting to speculate that it may be available 
only to humans, as suggested by the failure of all the baboons we tested. At the moment, 
however, this proposal remains tentative, because we only tested a limited number of humans 
and a single non-human primate species. Both facets of this proposal will have to be submitted 
10 
to further tests, for instance by contrasting human infants, who are known to be born with 
sophisticated symbolic abilities (41), and chimpanzees, who may lack a logical or hierarchical 
mode of data analysis (8). 
The present results converge with prior research, using more complex geometric 
displays and tasks, which indicated that all humans, even young or uneducated ones, possess 
15 
intuitions for geometry (20–22) and automatically apply a symbolic, language-like formalism to 
geometric data (22, 42). Brain imaging showed that this “language of geometry” rests primarily 
on dorsal and inferior sectors of prefrontal cortex (42). These regions are activated whenever 
humans reason about mathematical concepts and recombine them algebraically (43–45). While 
they are located outside of classical language areas, their surface area is strikingly expanded in 
20 
the human lineage (46, 47), and they are therefore a good candidate for the emergence of 
novel human capacities in evolution, including symbolic mathematics. Previous work has shown 

 
18 
 
that proto-mathematical core knowledge is present in other non-human primates, such as 
numerosity in macaque monkeys (48, 49) or spatial navigation in baboons (50). However, what 
these species may be lacking is a capacity to discretize those representations and recombine 
them in larger language-like combinatorial expressions such as “four equal sides” (5–8), which 
are needed in order to conceive of a square and draw it. In the future, it would be informative 
5 
to test whether chimpanzees who received “language training”, i.e. learned to use visual tokens 
to label numbers and objects (51, 52), would show the geometric regularity effect. There are 
reasons to doubt it, since careful analyses suggest that, unlike young children, chimpanzees do 
not use these tokens in productive combinations (11). 
A parallel issue is, how could the neural networks we tested be modified to eventually 
10 
pass the geometrical intruder test? Classical convolutional neural networks mimic only part of 
human visual recognition abilities (38). They roughly correspond to the first, bottom-up pass of 
invariant visual object recognition (53), but much more sophisticated recurrent top-down 
architectures are required to attain human-level performance in slower perceptual decision 
making tasks (54, 55). It will be interesting to examine if those newer models pass the present 
15 
test or, as we tentatively suggest, if yet another level of symbolic representation, perhaps 
based on symbolic tree-based generative models and program inference (56–58), is needed.  
In summary, the present results suggest a new putative human cognitive universal: the 
capacity to perceive the regularity of a geometric shape such as a square. They hint at the 
exciting possibility that humans differ from other primates in cognitive mechanisms that are 
20 
much more basic than language comprehension or theory of mind, and involve a rapid grasp of 

 
19 
 
mathematical regularities in their environment. Those findings also provide a novel challenge 
for artificial intelligence, as none of the classical neural network models we tested so far could 
capture human behavior.

Materials and Methods 
Reference shapes. All experiments relied on a single set of 11 fixed reference shapes, which 
were all quadrilaterals (Fig. 1A; the coordinates of their vertices are listed in Supplementary 
Table T1). We matched most reference shapes for two parameters. First, the average distance 
between all pairs of vertices (i.e., the mean of six distances) was the same across the 11 shapes. 
5 
This ensured that the reference shapes had the same overall size. Second, the bottom edge was 
of fixed length across 9 of the 11 shapes – this was particularly important for the sequence 
experiment, where this segment was the last to appear on the screen and was the only one that 
could contain an outlier. The square and the rhombus were the only exceptions: they were only 
matched to other shapes on the average of distances. This was necessary because (1) the 
10 
square had only one degree of freedom, and (2) the rhombus would otherwise have been 
either too similar to the square or utterly flat. 
For some shapes (e.g. rectangle), this set of constraints led to a single choice for the specific 
shape. For others, we selected a shape that satisfied the constraints while being maximally 
different from the shapes in other categories. For instance, the specific quadrilateral that we 
15 
selected for the “irregular” category made it maximally obvious that it did not have equal sides, 
parallel sides, equal angles or right angles. 
The constraints that we adopted implied that the shapes were not strictly equalized in other 
dimensions such as surface or perimeter. Such residual differences might explain why the 
performance of neural networks and baboons varied slightly across shapes, but crucially they 
20 
were uncorrelated with shape regularity (see Supplementary Materials). 

 
21 
 
Deviant shapes. For each reference shape, we generated four deviant shapes by changing the 
position of the bottom-right vertex. All deviant vertices were equidistant from the correct 
vertex location. Two deviant vertices were positioned along the bottom edge, either 
lengthening it or shortening it (see Figure 1A). The two other deviant positions preserved the 
correct distance from the bottom left vertex, and thus the length of the bottom edge, but 
5 
changed its orientation. The distance of the deviant position from the correct position was fixed 
for all experiments and was common to all shapes. It was computed as a proportion of the 
(fixed) average distance between all pairs of vertices (55% for the sequence experiment; 30% 
for all other experiments). 
Variations in orientation and size. In their default presentation, the shapes were centered on 
10 
their center of mass, and their top vertex was horizontal. We then rotated the six shapes by a 
random permutation of the following angles: [-25°, -15°, -5°, 5°, 15°, 25°]. We avoided 0° 
rotation to prevent participants from relying on parallelism with the edges of the computer 
screen, and we avoided larger angles to side step the fact that some shapes had rotational 
symmetry (for instance, a 45° rotated square is identical to a -45° rotated square, but the same 
15 
does not hold for a trapezoid). We also scaled the shapes by a random permutation of the 
following scaling factors: [0.875, 0.925, 0.975, 1.025, 1.075, 1.125]. 
Participants and experimental procedures. Details of the participants, design, procedure, and 
analyses specific to each experiment are presented as Supplementary Materials. Briefly, 612 
French adults were recruited for online experiment 1, 117 for online experiment 2, and 48 for 
20 
on-line subjective ratings. For the sequence and visual search experiments, we tested 

 
22 
 
respectively 16 and 11 participants in individual isolated testing booths. 28 French preschoolers 
(mean age 64 months; range 59-70 months; 15 boys, 13 girls) from two classrooms were tested 
individually in their school. Finally, 44 native Himba adults were recruited on-site in small 
individual villages of Northern Namibia (Southern Africa). All were monolingual native speakers 
of Otjihimba, a dialect of the Otjiherero language, which does not have vocabulary for most 
5 
geometric shapes. Out of these, we report data for the 22 participants who did not attend a 
single year of schooling (for additional analyses of the effect of schooling, see Supplementary 
Materials). 
Baboons (26 Papio papio, 18 females, age range 1.5-23 years, mean age 11 years) were tested 
at the CNRS primate facility (Rousset-sur-Arc, France). Baboons lived in a 700 m2 outdoor 
10 
enclosure with access to indoor housing and could, on a voluntary basis, at any time, enter ten 
Automated Learning Devices for Monkeys equipped with a 19-inch touch screen, a food 
dispenser, and a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader that could identify the animals

Figure 1. Geometric regularity effect in humans 
A, stimuli. We selected 11 quadrilaterals with various degrees of regularity, as defined by 
5 
parallelism, equal sides, equal angles and right angles. For each quadrilateral, four deviants 
were generated by moving the bottom right corner by a fixed distance, thus shortening, 
lengthening or rotating the bottom side. B, examples of intruder-task displays. Left: circular 
display used in experiment 1. Participants had to tap the intruder. Center: Rectangular display 
used in experiment 2 and following. In the canonical presentation, five shapes exemplified a 
10 
fixed quadrilateral, with variations in size and orientation, and the remaining shape was a 
deviant. In the swapped presentation, those two shapes were swapped. In either case, 
participants had to tap the intruder. Right: sequential presentation, unfolding from top to 
bottom and from left to right over the span of 1.8 seconds. Participants had to answer “correct” 
for properly placed dots (in green), and “incorrect” for deviant dots (example in red).  C, 
15 
geometric regularity effect in experiment 1: error rate varied massively with shape regularity 
in French adults. Shapes are ordered by performance and each is labeled with a color which is 
consistent across graphs. Error bars represent the standard error pooled over all participants – 
in this figure it is smaller than dot size. D-H: Replications of the geometric regularity effect 
with: D, swapped versus canonical trials in French adults; E, subjective judgments of shape 
20 
complexity on a 1-100 scale; F, Sequential presentation of the four corners; G, French 
preschoolers; H, uneducated Himba adults from rural Namibia.

Figure 2. Visual search paradigm. A, Examples of visual search displays. In the visual search 
task, 6, 12 or 24 shapes were randomly positioned inside a circle, and participant had to decide 
whether all the shapes were identical, irrespective of rotation and scaling, or whether there 
was one that differed from the others. They gave their binary present/absent response by 
pressing one of two possible keys on the keyboard. B, Error rates in visual search task. Errors 
5 
rates increased with both the number of shapes and their complexity (geometric irregularity). 
The latter effect correlated tightly with the average error rate in the intruder task.  C, Search 
times. Left: Slope of the visual search as a function of the number of displayed items, the 
presence or absence of an outlier, and the shape. Right: Correlation between the slope of the 
visual search on present trials and the error rates of the intruder task (exp. 2).

Figure 3. The geometric regularity effect is absent in baboons. A, training procedure. Each 
animal was trained for thousands of trials on the intruder task, first with a small number of 
fixed images (n=3, training stage 1), then with a larger number of images (up to 6, training stage 
5) and with variations in size and orientation. Mastery of the task was verified through two 
generalization tests using novel images. Each baboon moved from one stage to the next only 
5 
when the error rate fell below 20%. B, Summary of baboon training performance (first and last 
blocks of 88 trials each). Each color represents one baboon. Most animals attained criterion on 
the 10 pairs of shapes used for training (top) and successfully generalized to 10 new pairs of 
shapes (bottom left) and to 3 pairs of easily distinguishable polygons (bottom right; chance = 
83.3% errors with 6 shapes). C, performance in the geometric intruder task. Left: average 
10 
performance for each geometric shape at three stages: the first 33 test blocks, the middle 33 
test blocks, and the last 33 test blocks. Each block contained 88 trials, and baboons took at 
most 99 blocks. Right: correlation between the average error rate in baboons and in French 
adults taking the same test (experiment 2).

Figure 4. A double dissociation in geometric shape perception. A, symbolic model. Each shape 
is coded by a vector of discrete geometric properties (equal angles, parallel sides, equal lengths 
and right angles; each relationship is assumed to be detected with a tolerance of 12.5%). The 
distance between the standard and outlier vectors is then used as a predictor of the ease of 
intruder detection. B, neural network model (panel modified from ref. (53), with permission 
5 
from the authors). CORnet, a model of the ventral visual pathway for image recognition, is used 
to encode each of the six shapes of a given trial by an activation vector in inferotemporal cortex 
(IT). The shape whose vector is the most distant (ℒଶ-norm) from the average of the five others, 
is taken as the network’s intruder response. Predicted error rate is obtained by averaging 
across hundreds of trials. C, Simple correlation matrix across shapes between the performance 
10 
of individual baboons (names in capitals, top rows), the predictions of the two models (middle 
rows), and various human groups (bottom rows). Color indicates the correlation coefficient r. D, 
Standardized regression weights (beta) in a multiple regression of the data from various human 
and non-human primate groups across 44 data points (11 shapes X 4 outlier types) using the
