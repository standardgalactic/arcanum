 
The History of Sir Walter Buffalo Lawn 
Despite the fact that Buffalo grass was always slow to establish, 
suffered poor colour retention and gave thousands of Aussie kids 
annoying itchy rashes it remained a popular post-war choice of grass in 
Australia. 
It maintained its popularity right up to the 1950s because of its tough 
blade structure, heat tolerance and, above all, low water consumption. 
Kikuyu was initially imported as a rapid growing cow feed, but soon 
became popular as a lawn choice, gaining in popularity during the 1960s 
as a cheap lawn solution. 
Far from being the budget saviour of lawns in Australia, it wasn’t long 
before it turned into an invasive noxious weed taking over much of the 
eastern coast. 
Sir Walter Buffalo Lawn – Australia’s Most 
Successful Lawn in the Shade 
During the 1990s housing trends changed and the existing lawn 
varieties struggled to adapt. 
Houses became larger, blocks became smaller and the traditional 
Aussie lawn became smaller too. Larger houses meant that suddenly 
lawns had to deal with shade and extreme heat all at the same time. 
The solution to these issues appeared from the States in the from of 
new varieties of grass, however while these initially promised great 

things, they often suffered in the harsh Australian environmental 
conditions. 
Shademaster, the first soft leaf buffalo grass, revitalised the lawn market 
and paved the way for locally engineered turf products. 
The future arrived in 1996 with the arrival of a grass that was more 
resilient to disease, pests and fungus than other grasses. 
It was drought resistant, thrived in shade and sun and stayed green and 
lush throughout the year. 
It was called Sir Walter. 
15 years down the line and following extensive testing, thousands of 
lawn installations and some of the harshest weather conditions to date, 
Sir Walter Buffalo Lawn continues to thrive. 
It has shrugged off humidity related funguses, extreme water 
restrictions, shade, insects, lawn grubs and weeds where other varieties 
would not have survived. Sir Walter Buffalo Lawn really is the best home 
lawn. 
Sir Walter buffalo lawn is a hard wearing, but beautiful soft leaf buffalo 
and it remains Australia’s no. 1.
