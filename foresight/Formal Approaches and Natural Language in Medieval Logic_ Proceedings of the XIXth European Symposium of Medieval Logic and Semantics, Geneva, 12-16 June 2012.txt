INTRODUCTION
Since their birth in 1973, when three eminent scholars were having 
some drinks together in Warsaw, the European Symposia for Medieval 
Logic and Semantics have played an important role in coordinating a 
movement of rediscovery of late medieval philosophy of language, and 
more speciﬁ cally of its strong logical-semantic component. Besides the 
acknowledgement of the sophistication and reﬁ nement of medieval logical 
theories, as well as of the wide scope of the medievals’ inquiries, what has 
particularly fuelled this enthusiasm is the awareness of striking afﬁ nities 
with some of the main semantic approaches developed in the wake of the 
late 19th-early 20th century revolution in logic; indeed, the two periods 
seem to share formal ambitions. As far as logic is concerned, this was 
shown as early as 1956 by Bocheński, who pointed to some late medieval 
distinctions between formal and material consequences. In semantics, the 
afﬁ nity was found in the elaborate late medieval theories of quantiﬁ cation, 
reference, modalities, etc., and their role in attempts at formally determining 
the truth conditions of propositions. In both periods logic has maintained 
complex, and at time uneasy, relations with natural language, and both 
have seen pragmatic, ‘ordinary language’ endeavours to overcome some 
of the difﬁ culties. Soon, however, modern scholars became careful not too 
overlook the speciﬁ cities of theories developed more than ﬁ ve hundred 
years apart, in particular with respect to their ‘formal’ character.
Tackling the question whether medieval logic can be considered as 
a formal logic, Alfonso Maierù noted already in 1972 that the efforts of 
medieval logicians over the centuries could be seen as tending towards 
the identiﬁ cation of logical «structures» in language and its use which 
are formal enough to become objects of scientiﬁ c consideration1. Maierù 
pointed at the medievals’ «quest for a formal logic whose validity extends 
to any ﬁ eld of knowledge and does not depend on the peculiarities of 
different subject matters… but obeys only its own principles». But 
Maierù also stressed that «the language investigated is a historical one, 
Latin. One might thus wonder to which extent… one is allowed to speak 
of ‘formal logic’ in the middle ages». In other words, medieval logic in

INTRODUCTION
all its complexity –one could just as well talk about medieval philosophy 
of language– is characterized by a certain tension between the aims of 
‘formalist ambitions’ and the constraints proper to natural language. Such 
a conﬁ guration has made of the Middle Ages an exceptionally promising 
ﬁ eld of investigation for historians interested not only in logic and the 
development of formal approaches, but also, and more fundamentally, in 
the question of what it means, for logic, to be formal.
Some forty-three years and twenty symposia after the Warsaw meeting 
–and forty-four years after Maierù’s remarks–, our knowledge of the ﬁ eld 
has considerably expanded, allowing us to reassess the question of the 
formal character and formalising ambitions of medieval logic, as well as 
that of the natural character of the language in (and on) which it operated: 
in other words, the question of the nature, object and purpose of medieval 
logic. The 19th European Symposium for Medieval Logic and Semantics, 
which took place in Geneva from the 12th to the 16th of June 2012, intended 
to contribute to such a reassessment. So do the 25 papers published in 
these proceedings, which tackle the issue from three different angles. The 
ﬁ rst part focuses on the notion of formal logic, and more speciﬁ cally on 
questions pertaining to hylomorphism and formal validity; the second 
considers different ways the medieval philosophers had of conceiving (and 
doing) logical semantics; and the third gathers investigations regarding 
the extent to which the object language of medieval logic is natural –or 
regimented.
The conference at the origin of this volume was part of the Swiss 
National Science Foundation Project nº 129877, «Formal Semantics 
and Natural Language in 13th Century. Theoretical Devices and Applied 
Perspectives»; it beneﬁ ted from the ﬁ nancial support of the Marie Gretler

I. Formal Logic: Hylomorphism and Formal Validity


IWAKUMA YUKIO*
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
The two Introductiones, Vienna and Escorial, which I edited as works 
of William of Champeaux, contain treatises on media as appendix1. The 
term medium means a special type of hypothetical sentence, which ﬁ rst 
appeared in the two Introductiones around 1100, provoked controversy in 
the ﬁ rst few decades of the 12th century, and declined in the later period.
In the present paper, I shall ﬁ rst discuss (1) what a medium is, then (2) 
the controversy on media in the early 12th century, and lastly (3) the latest 
treatise on media known so far. 
1 What is a medium?
1.1. Media in William of Champeaux’s Introductiones
The earliest known texts on media, the Vienna and Escorial ones, 
discuss several media, giving some of them special names such as 
medium a partibus: Vienna 1.1, Escorial 2 
si omne animal est asinus, omnis homo est lapis. 
medium a subiecto: Vienna 1.2, Escorial 4
si omnis homo est lapis, tunc, si omnis lapis est homo, omnis 
homo est asinus.
medium a praedicato: Vienna 1.3, (Escorial 3) 
si omnis homo est lapis, tunc, si omnis lapis est homo, omnis 
lapis est asinus. 
medium parvum: Vienna 1.5, Escorial 1
si omnis homo est lapis, quidam lapis est lapis.

At ﬁ rst sight, these media appear to be sophistic, their antecedents 
and/ or consequents being false. Our texts, however, do not treat them as 
sophisms; instead, they give a proof for each of them. For example, the 
Vienna treatise gives the following proof for the medium parvum:
Text 1*: The Vienna treatise 1.5, Ms Wien, VPL 2499, f. 38r, p. 782
Media. Nota hanc naturam in parvo medio: quotiens aliquid1 
de aliquo universaliter, praedicatum praedicatur de se particulariter, 
ut hic: si (A1) omnis homo est lapis, (A2) quidam lapis est lapis.
Quod sic probatur. Si (A1) omnis homo est lapis, tunc vera est 
ipsa, scil. (A1) ‘omnis homo est lapis’, et iterum ista (A2) ‘quidam 
lapis est homo’. Et, si verae sunt istae duae propositiones (A1) 
‘omnis homo est lapis’ et (A2) ‘quidam lapis2 est homo’, tunc (A3) 
quidam lapis est lapis (a subiecto, regula: si aliquid subicitur alicui 
universaliter, et aliquid subicitur subiecto particulariter, primum 
praedicatum praedicatur3 de secundo subiecto particulariter). 
Collige terminos positos.
1 aliquid] aliq(uo)d W – 2 lapis est homo] homo e(st) lap(is) W – 3 
praedicatur] particularit(er) W et Iwakuma 1993 
The proof in the Escorial treatise runs perfectly parallel (ed. Iwakuma, 
p. 112). It is certain, then, that the author, William, accepts media as true 
sentences.
The term medium is never explicitly deﬁ ned in any of the relevant 
works known so far, which I shall all discuss in detail below. But we have 
two clues as to what the term medium means: the two expressions most 
frequently used, namely media propositio and per medium. 
1.2. Medium / medius / media 
First, we should note that the object of our concern is medium in neuter, 
not medius in masculine nor media in feminine. Boethius’ translation of 
Aristotle’s Prior Analytics uses the term medium in neuter as well as medius 
* The notes numbers within the quotations refer to the critical apparatus at the end 
of each quotation (eds.).
2 Ed. IWAKUMA, «The Introductiones dialecticae», pp. 45-114.

in masculine in the sense of a middle term of a categorical syllogism. 
Therefore, after the mid-12th century, when the work of Aristotle’s began 
to be widely circulated, medium in neuter came to be commonly used in the 
sense of a middle term. Thus John of Salisbury in his Metalogicon, written 
in 1159, reports that it was William of Champeaux who took up medium, 
but John confuses William’s medium in neuter with medius (terminus) in 
masculine3. In the ﬁ rst half of the century, however, ‘middle term’ is always 
expressed by medius in masculine, apart from a very few exceptions; 
therefore medium in neuter must have had then a different meaning.
The term media (propositio) in feminine is used in all the extant 12th 
century commentaries on Boethius’ De syllogismis hypotheticis to refer to 
a special type of hypothetical sentences of the form 
si est A, est B; si est B, est C, 
from which syllogisms are composed with conclusions of the form 
ergo, si est A, est C. 
Boethius does discuss such syllogisms in his De syllogismis 
hypotheticis I (855C-866A10), but he never calls them by the name media 
propositio, an expression used only by medieval logicians. 
1.3. Per medium arguments
Another expression, per medium, is used throughout the ﬁ rst half of 
the 12th century, even in the periods before and after medium itself was 
discussed. It is usually used to mean a special type of proofs, namely those 
of the form 
3 John of Salisbury, Metalogicon III.9.43-53 (CCCM 98, p. 129): «Versatur in 
his inventionis materia, quam hilaris memoriae Willelmus de Campellis, postmodum 
Catalanensis episcopus, difﬁ nivit, etsi non perfecte, esse scientiam reperiendi medium 
termium et inde eliciendi argumentum. Cum enim de inhaerentia dubitatur, necessarium 
est aliquod inquiri medium cuius interventu copulentur extrema. Qua speculatione an 
aliqua subtilior vel ad rem efﬁ cacior fuerit, non facile dixerim. Medium vero necessarium 
est ubi vis inferentiae in terminis vertitur. Si enim inter totas propositiones sit, ut potius 
sit obnoxia complexioni partium quam partibus complexis, medii nexus cessat.»

if P, then Q; if Q, then R; therefore, if P, then R 
or a longer chain 
if P1, then P2; if P2, then P3; ...; if Pn-1, then Pn; therefore, if P1, then 
Pn’. 
The earliest usage of the expression per medium is found in the 
following proto-vocalist text4 from the late 11th century. 
Text 2: Ms Paris, lat. 544, f. 102
Quod autem falsae particulares et indeﬁ nitae ponant falsas 
universales, probatur hoc modo per medium. Nam, si (P) falsa est 
‘quidam homo [non] est albus’, (Q) vera est ‘nullus homo est albus’; 
et, si (Q) vera est ‘nullus homo est albus’, (R) falsa est ‘omnis homo 
est albus’. Et item, si (P’) falsa est ‘homo est albus’, (Q’) vera est 
‘nullus homo est albus’; et, si (Q’) vera est ‘nullus’, (R’) falsa est 
‘omnis homo est albus’. Rursus, si (P1) falsa est ‘quidam homo 
non est albus’ vel ‘homo non est albus’, (P2) vera est ‘omnis homo 
est albus’; et, si (P2) vera est ‘omnis homo est albus’, (P3) falsa est 
‘quidam1 homo non est albus’ <vel ‘homo non est albus’>; quodsi 
(P3) falsa est ‘quidam homo non est albus’ vel ‘homo non est albus’, 
(P4) falsa est ‘nullus homo est albus’. 
1 quidam homo non est albus] nullus homo est albus P 
The expression ‘secundum medium’ still frequently appears with the 
same sense in the Introductiones Montanae minores and maiores from the 
mid-12th century5. 
We should note that the per medium argument is never discussed as 
such by Boethius, but is a product of medieval logicians. A per medium 
argument is not the same as a media propositio syllogism. In media 
propositio syllogisms, the constituent propositions always have the same

and 34.27, Ed. by L. M. DE RIJK, Logica Modernorum II-2, Van Gorcum, Assen 1967.

subject term; but in per medium arguments, P, Q, and R can well be 
propositions with different subject terms. Presumably, paying little notice 
to this difference, medieval logicians took the name media propositio from 
the expression per medium, which had already been used before Boethius’ 
De syllogismis hypotheticis came to be known. 
1.4. Conclusion 
Now, it should be pointed out that the media were always proved by 
a per medium argument. For example, the proof of parvum medium cited 
before (Text 1) runs as follows: 
A1 ¨ A1 ∧ A2, A1 ∧ A2 ¨ A3 ⊢ A1 ¨ A3. 
It is also the case with all the arguments concerning media which I 
shall discuss below. 
I conclude, then, that a medium is a sentence with the conjunction 
«if» which can be proved by a per medium argument. Special nominal 
expressions such as medium parvum, etc. are given to some strange kinds 
of such arguments, which are true in spite of the fact that their antecedent 
and/or consequent are false. 
2. Controversies over media in the early 12th Century 
There began a controversy over proofs of media in the ﬁ rst decade of 
the 12th century. 
2.1. The dissimilitudo theory 
The controversy at its earliest stage was reported in Vienna treatises 
on media. 
Text 3: the Vienna treatise 1.4, Ms Wien, VPL 2499, ff. 37v-38r, ed. 
Iwakuma pp. 77-78
[1.1] Haec supradicta media, scil. medium a partibus et de praedicato 
et de subiecto, hoc modo determinantur. †Vel magis† quando ex 

8 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
aliquo antecedenti duo consequentia sequuntur, unumquodque per se, 
ex quibus postea simul acceptis sequitur aliud, non licet iungi extrema, 
quia medius terminus dissimiliter enuntiatus est, ut in argumentatione 
medii a partibus ex1 ‘omne animal est asinus’ sequitur ‘omne non 
asinus est non homo’ et ‘omnis asinus est non homo’ unumquodque 
per se; et ex illis postea simul acceptis trahitur ‘omnis homo est bos’ 
vel aliquid tale; medius itaque terminus dissimiliter enuntiatus est, 
scil. illae duae propositiones dissimiliter enuntiantur; quare non 
probatur consequentia, quia non ostenditur sequi ex aliquo vero. 
[1.2] Et hoc habet auctoritas Boethii2 dicentis quod, quando medius 
terminus dissimiliter enuntiatur, non licet extrema concludere, si ﬁ t 
talis dissimilatio quae impediat conclusionem. 
[2.1] Sed contra respondetur quod, cum haec Boethius dixit, agebat 
de modalibus |38r| propositionibus3; sed praemissae propositiones 
non sunt modales; quare haec ratio non videtur cogens ut3 concedatur. 
In nulla enim argumentatione †universaliter iterum dicitur† extrema 
cohaerent, quia ibi semper medius terminus dissimiliter enuntiatur. 
[2.2] Ratio etiam praedicta in medio a partibus non videtur valere, 
†quod dicimus, quando aliqua propositio falsa concedatur pro vera, 
quod debeat habere illud quod vera,† scil. quod praedicatur5 sit

Rijk – 5 praedicatur sic W, sed praedicatum legit De Rijk; fortasse 
sic legendum? 
Unfortunately, some parts are corrupt, but we can at least see that there 
were some people who did not accept proofs of media ([1]); however, the 
author himself, William of Champeaux, does not agree with them ([2]). 
Those who did not accept proofs of media claimed that they have a ﬂ aw 
because the middle terms are accepted differently (dissimilliter) in some 
steps of the proof ([1.1]), appealing to the authority of Boethius ([1.2]). We 
shall call this the dissimilitudo theory. 
William rejects the dissimilitudo theory, saying ([2.1]) that Boethius 
only speaks of modal propositions, but no modal propositions appear in 
the proofs of media. Boethius actually asserts in the passage alluded to (De 
syl. hyp. I, 842C3-D5) that in order to construe syllogisms from mediae 
propositiones, the middle term should not be enunciated dissimiliter, as for 
example in this manner: 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
9
si est A, est B; et, si necesse est esse B, est vel non est C, 
touching only modal propositions. 
This is the beginning of the controversy. 
2.2. Peter Abelard in his Dialectica 
Abelard discusses relevant issues in Book III.1 of his Dialectica. 
2.2.1. Before we discuss our issue, however, it is necessary to see that 
Book III has a very complicated structure, which is not always clear from 
De Rijk’s edition6. 
Book III intends to discuss topical arguments. It begins with the 
deﬁ nition of loci (pp. 253.16-263.3) and its division (pp. 263.4-271.21), 
but in the course of the latter, a long interpolation intervenes (pp. 271.21-
309.24). After the interpolation, a discussion of maxima propositio follows 
(pp. 309-25-331.4), although they had already been discussed before (pp. 
264.5-268.35), and then we have discussions of each locus (pp. 331.5 to 
the end).

2.2.2. The interpolation begins as follows, proposing two issues to be 
discussed.
Text 4: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614, f. 152r, 
pp. 271.22-26 ed. De Rijk
Sed nunc quidem, utrum omnium inferentia suprapositarum 
consequentiarum veritatem custodia[n]t1, consideremus. Quod 
facilius hoc modo fecerimus, si2 prius, (I) in quo hypotheticae

addidi, <sensus> addiderunt Cousin et De Rijk 
As for Issue I, Abelard asserts (pp. 271.26-279.13) that the truth 
of hypothetical sentences consists in the necessity of logical entailment 
(necessitas consecutionis). Two corollaries follow. The truth or necessity 
of an entailment is eternal, that is to say, it is not affected by changes in 
the world (pp. 279.13-282.29). Therefore it is different from the truth 
of categorical sentences, which is affected by changes in the world (pp. 
282.30-283.35). Joscelin of Soissons takes a similar position (cf. ¶ 2.3.2 
below). 
2.2.3. As for Issue II (pp. 283.37-309.24), Abelard ﬁ rst distinguishes 
two meanings of necessity (pp. 283.37-286.30). In a broader sense, it 
means that if what the consequents say is not the case, what the antecedents 
say cannot be the case. In a stricter sense, it means that antecedents in 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
11
themselves require consequents, in addition to the fact that antecedents 
cannot be true without the consequents being such. The necessity of 
entailment should be accepted in the latter, stricter, sense.
Text 5: Abelard, Dialectica III, Paris, BnF, lat. 14614 f. 153v, pp. 
283.37-284.3 ed. De Rijk
Videntur autem duae consecutionis necessitates. Una quidem 
largior, cum videlicet id quod dicit antecedens non potest esse 
absque eo quod dicit consequens. Altera vero strictior, cum scilicet 
|284| non solum antecedens absque consequenti non potest esse 
verum, <sed1 etiam> ex se ipsum exigit. Quae quidem necessitas 
in propria consecutionis sententia consistit et veritatem tenet 
incommutabilem, ... 
1 <sed etiam> addidit De Rijk
After that, Abelard discusses the following eight general rules for 
an antecedens and a consequens in a consequentia (pp. 286.31-309.24), 
asserting that only the ﬁ rst two cases are valid and that all the remaining 
ones are invalid.

In between the discussions of rules I-V (pp. 286.31-292.33) and VI-
VIII (pp. 305.8-309.24), Abelard makes a long and complicated digression 
(pp. 292.34-305.7). This digression deserves a more detailed study, since it 
is directly relevant to our present concern, medium. 
2.2.4. In the digression, Abelard ﬁ rst points out (pp. 292.34-293.4) 
that there are some people who assert that Rules III and IV are valid in 
some cases, viz. in the topical arguments on locus ab oppositis and ab 
immediatis. For example, 

12 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
si est sanum, non est aegrum (against the invalid rule III) 
si non est sanum, est aegrum (against the invalid rule IV). 
But Abelard refuses, as is well known, the validity of locus ab oppositis 
and ab immediatis. Against those who accept the two loci, Abelard argues 
as follows (p. 293.5-25). The sentences above (‘si est sanum, ...’ etc.) 
might be true according to the relation of things (secundum habitudinem 
rerum), but the aforementioned rules (III and IV) should not be understood 
according to the relation of things, but according to the whole meaning of 
the antecedent (secundum totarum antecedentis enuntiationum sententiam). 
There are many if-sentences (consequentiae) that are true according to the 
former, but false according to the latter. 
Abelard, then, gives some examples of such if-sentences7, viz. 
(a) si omnis homo est lapis, quidam lapis est lapis
(b) si Socrates est Brunellus, Socrates est homo,
giving proofs for (a) and (b), as follows.
Text 6: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614 f. 155r, pp. 
294.6-17 ed. De Rijk 
Sic tamen <verae>1 ostendi poterunt suprapositae consequentiae, 
hoc modo. Si  
(a1) omnis homo est lapis 
vera est, simul et  
(a2) quidam lapis est homo. 
Quodsi verae sunt  
(a1) omnis homo est lapis 
et  
(a2) quidam lapis est homo, 
contingit necessario veram2 <esse> 
 
(a3) quidam lapis est lapis. 
Haec est enim forma inferentiae tertii modi primae ﬁ gurae. Unde et 
sic per extremorum coniunctionem infertur 
 
 (a) si omnis homo est lapis, quidam lapis est 
lapis. 
7 Abelard, Dialectica III, ed. DE RIJK p. 293.31-32. He gives another example (p. 
293.34) (c) «si Socrates (] id(em) Ms et De Rijk) est animal, <Socrates> est homo», 
and discusses it separately from (a) and (b) (pp. 302.18-303.28). This is irrelevant to 
our present concern.

Sic quoque secunda  (b) convincitur vera. 
Si 
(b1) Socrates est Brunellus 
vera est, simul et

Ex his autem duabus necessario consequitur

Ex qua etiam infertur 
 
(b4) Socrates est homo.

homo.

Now, Sentence (a) is exactly the same as parvum medium although 
Abelard does not explicitly call it by the name ‘medium’. Moreover, the 
proof given for (a) runs perfectly parallel to that given in the treatises on 
media (see Text 1 above). Abelard thus accepts parvum medium (a) as a 
true sentence as well as (b) together with their proofs. 
2.2.5. Abelard then discusses the dissimilitudo theory (pp. 294.18-
295.34 ed. De Rijk).
Text 7: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614, f. 155r, p. 
294.18-24 ed. De Rijk
Huic tamen extremorum coniunctioni <non>nulli1 resistere conantur

compar<ar>et2, ut sunt illae, quae vel ex categorica et hypothetica vel

14 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
The proof of (b) above is criticized from the point of view of the 
dissimilitudo theory, as follows. 
Text 8: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, lat. 14614, f. 155v, p. 
295.14-24 ed. De Rijk
Sic quoque et ex dissimilitudine medii termini illi quoque superiori 
argumentationi, quae ostendebat 
 
 (b) si Socrates est Brunellus, Socrates est homo, 
 
per denegationem ultimae consequentiae, quae ait 
 
 si (b3) Socrates est Socrates, (b4) Socrates est homo, 
 
 resistere laborant. Aiunt enim istam consequentiam non 
aliunde veram videri nisi ex eo quod Socrates hominis 
inferius fuerit. Illum autem hominis inferius esse non iam 
recipiunt, ubi in praemissa enuntiatione (b1) Brunellus (qui 
hominem expellit) coniunctus Socrati fuerat, immo asinus1 
per Brunellum (qui ei copulatur). Neque enim iam ipsum 
aliud a Brunello esse nullo modo aiunt. 
1 asinus correxerunt De Rijk et Cousin, asini V 
2.2.6. Abelard next reports that many people reject the dissimilitudo 
theory and accept the proofs of (a) and (b) as valid ones. 
Text 9: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614, f. 155v, 
pp. 295.35-297.24 ed. De Rijk 
Sed sunt plerique qui primae argumentationis consequentiae (a, b) 
obviandum non censeant propter illam terminorum enuntiationem. 
Neque enim resistendum in huiusmodi argumentationibus dicunt nisi 
ex dissimilitudine medii termini. Medius autem <terminus>1 nondum 
existit, una |296| tantum consequentia proposita. Ut enim medius 
intercedat terminus, oportet ipsum et in prima consequentia subsequi 
et in secunda antecedere. Priori vero con sequentiae contradicere non 
audent eo quod compellantur conﬁ teri falsas eas <esse>2 quoque, quae 
ex falsis propositionibus vere texuntur, veluti ista 
(f) si omnis homo est margarita, omnis homo est lapis. 
Neque enim iam margarita (hominem prorsus continens) species 
lapidis remanet. 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
15
Sed, <si>3 priores consequentias (a, b) ex ulla terminorum 
enuntiatione non denegent, quomodo4 illam argumentationem 
absolvunt quae Aristotelicam auctoritatem oppugnat, ubi in tractatu 
Oppositorum: “Sanis, inquit (Cat. p. 75.5), omnibus, sanitas quidem 
erit, languor vero non erit”?5 Est autem talis argumentatio quae 
potius ostendat (g) si omne animal sit sanum, languorem esse; quod 
plane Aristoteli contradicit, qui (g*) si omne animal sanum sit, 
languorem non esse conﬁ rmat. Est autem huiusmodi argumentatio 
 
 si (g1) omne animal est sanum, (g2) omne languidum est 
sanum, 
a toto. Animal namque etiam languentia continet. Quod 
 
 si (g2) omne languidum est sanum, 
 
(g3) omne languidum est animal. 
Unde et  
(g4) quoddam animal est languidum. 
Unde et  
(g5) languor in quodam animali consistit, 
et ita  
(g6) languor est. 
Itaque per medium ostensum est quod 
 
 (g) si (g1) omne animal est sanum, (g6) languor est. 
Quae quidem argumentatio cassari non dicitur ut6 in priori 
consequentia (a, b). 
Sed primam quidem consequentiam (g1 ¨ g2) pro eo contradicunt 
quod prima eius positio (g1) quasi concessa praemittatur. Cuius 
veritatis concessio (g1) iam omnino perimit continentiam languidi 
in animali (g2). Ubi enim animal sano prorsus supponi conceditur 
(g1), nullum continere languidum annuitur. Tunc itaque terminorum 
enuntiationem (g1) unius quoque per se positae consequentiae 
inferentiam (g1 ¨ g2) perimere dicunt, cuius habitudinis vim 
enuntiationis veritas aufert, cum subcontinua<tiva>7 conditio 
apponitur, id est cum id quod iam concessum fuerat coniungit. 
Cum autem non <subcontinuativa8 est sed> solum continuativa nec 
quicquam concessionis requiritur sed sola conditionis copulatio 
attenditur, id, quod nec verum est nec concessum, consecutionem 
impedire non dicunt. 
Sed unde maiorem vim adversus enuntiationem secundae (g2 ¨ g3) 
vel tertiae9 (g3 ¨ g4) consequentiae quam adversus enuntiationem 

16 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
primae (g1 ¨ g2) habeat primae partis enuntiatio (g1), cum 
videlicet nec vera sit nec concessa.10 Sicut in superioribus 
argumentationibus, ubi vel ex 
 
(d1) omne animal est homo 
 
(d5) quoddam animal non est homo 
vel ex  
(b1) Socrates est Brunellus 
 
(b4) Socrates est homo 
extrahebatur, non ex |297| primis quidem propositionibus (d1, 
b1) ut ex concessis argumentari incipimus, nec ullam earum 
concessionem requirimus, sed sub conditione solum si hoc est, 
illud esse proponimus. Quae quidem conditionis copulatio aeque 
et in veris et in falsis enuntiationibus consistit. Nulla itaque 
exhibet<ur>11 ratio ut prioris enuntiatio partis magis sequentes 
quam priores consequentias oppugnare valeat, sed12 aequaliter 
eius veritas adversa utrisque13 fuerit. Sed, nec pro enuntiatione 
quacumque impediri potest quaecumque consequentia vera 
consistit. Quod enim sempiternum [non]14 est ac necessarium, 
nullo potest impediri casu, nec propter enuntiare, ut Aristoteles 
meminit (De int. 9 p. 16.3-4), erit aliquid aut non erit. Enuntiatione 
ergo resistendum non est, sed15 veritate enuntiationis. Alioquin per 
oppositam enuntiationem quamlibet possemus impedire veritatem, 
qui sic16 quidlibet vel esse vel non esse enuntiare<mus>17. Si ergo 
sola enuntiationis veritas impediat, nulla autem vera enuntiatio 
sic18 praemissa consecutione<m>19 posteriorum hypotheticarum 
impediat, profecto inique20 calumniantur ex veritate praemissae 
enuntiationis consequentias posteriores. Nam consequentiae21, quae 
praemittuntur, verae quidem conceduntur ab ipsis, veluti illa quae 
ait 
 
 si (d1) omne animal est homo, (d2) omnis asinus est 
homo, 
et  
 si (b1) Socrates est Brunellus, (b2) Brunellus est Socrates. 
Sed earum veritas aliarum veritatem nullo modo impedit. Neque 
enim verum vero potest esse impedimento. Non itaque ex veritate 
illius praemissae enuntiationis calumniari oportuit posteriores 
consequentias.

This position is William of Champeaux’s. The ‘quasi concessa’ in 
the quotation above is reminiscent of the following passage of William’s 
Vienna treatise on media. 
Text 10: The Vienna treatise 1.1, ms Wien VPL 2499 f. 36r, p. 75 
ed. Iwakuma
Quaeritur hic a probante utrum ipse, <qui> argumentetur de ‘omne1 
animal est asinus’, <argumentetur> de vera vel de falsa. 
Respondetur2: de neutra, sed de concessa pro vera. Quo concesso, 
oportet quod asinus sit maius animali subiecto secundum regularem 
praedicationem, cum accidens <de subiecto> vel idem de se non 
praedicetur ibi.

Abelard agrees with William that (a) (= parvum medium) as well as 
(b) is true and that their proofs are valid. Still, Abelard argues against 
William’s position, since there is a difference between the two masters in 
the acceptance of the proofs. 

18 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
A work from William’s school, a version of C88, says as follows. 
Text 11: C8 VP-version, Vat. Reg. lat. 230, f. 69va-b, Paris lat. 
13368, f. 213va; the parts in parentheses {} are V-additions 
SANIS1 NAMQUE (75.5). Hic2 probat a partibus contrariorum quod non 
est necesse, si unum contrarium sit, et reliquum esse, sic3: |V69VB| 
Quia necessarium `non´ est, si sanitas est, aegritudinem esse; et, si 
albedo est, nigredinem esse. Quod ostendit his verbis: SANIS quidem 
OMNIBUS existentibus, {id est si omne4 animal est sanum,} sanitas 
erit, languor5 quidem non erit, id est OMNIBUS animalibus existentibus 
SANIS, SANITAS QUIDEM ERIT per simplex esse, LANGUOR6 VERO7 NON ERIT 
per simplex esse {manente prima concessione, scilicet quod omne 
animal sit sanum.} 
Hic videtur posse probari quod liber denegat, scilicet quod 
 
 (g’) omnibus existentibus sanis, languor [non8] erit, 
sic.  
 Si (g’1) omnia9 animalia sunt sana, (g’2) omne animal est 
sanum; 
 
 <et, si (g’2) hoc est, (g’3) quoddam sanum est animal>; 
 
 et, si (g’3) hoc est, tunc (g’4) quoddam sanum10 est 
aegrum; 
 
 et, si (g’4) hoc est, (g’5) quoddam animal est aegrum; 
 
 et, si (g’5) quoddam animal est aegrum, tunc (g’6) 
aegritudo est. 
Sed sic determinandum est, ubi dicitur 
 
si (g’2) omne animal est sanum, 
 
(g’3) quoddam aegrum11 est sanum, 
quod, quando dicimus 
 
(g’2) omne `animal´ est sanum, 
ibi removemus aegritudinem ab omni animali; et ita non est vera 
illa12 consequentia quae dicit 
 
 si (g’2) omne animal est sanum, (g’3) quoddam aegrum 
est sanum.

8 C8 is a commentary on Aristotle’s Categories, which was presumably originally 
written by William of Champeaux, and preserved in various revisions by William’s 
students. See IWAKUMA, «Vocales Revisited», pp. 89-91.

Sed13 videtur quod bene sequitur in veritate: 
 
 si (g’2) omne animal est sanum, (g’3) quoddam aegrum 
est sanum. 
Quod sic patet. Si (g’3) quoddam animal <est> aegrum, tunc, 
 
 si (g’2) omne animal est sanum, (g’3) quoddam aegrum 
est sanum. 
Sed, quando Aristoteles dicit quod 
 
si omne animal sit sanum, languor non erit, 
voluit pro certo verum esse omne animal esse sanum; et ideo, 
manente illa concessione, non remanet languor. Quae consideratio 
non potest esse in huiusmodi14 consequentiis 
 
 si (d1) omne animal est homo, (d2) omnis asinus est 
homo. 
Si enim concederemus ita esse conﬁ rmando quod (d1) omne animal 
sit homo, non sequitur postea (d2) omnis asinus est homo, quia, 
ubi conﬁ rmavimus omne animal esse hominem, ibi concessimus 
perire15 omnes res sub animali praeter hominem. Unde dubitando, 
non conﬁ rmando, accipitur prior propositio. Ad quod utile est 
scire quod ‘si’ haec coniunctio, quando dicitur ativam, `tunc´ facit 
dubitationem, quasi dicat 
 
si hoc est quod dubium est, tunc est illud; 
quando autem est subcontinuativa, tunc facit certitudinem, et valet 
idem quod ‘quia’, quasi dicat 
 
 si hoc est quod verum est, (id16 est quasi ‘quia hoc est’), 
est illud. 
Et in his continuativa

According to these texts (Text 9 and 11), William considers that (g) 
is false and (d) is true, since in (g) and (d) the conjunction ‘si’ should be 
accepted differently, for in (g) it is subcontinuativa and equivalent to ‘quia’ 
while in (d) it is continuativa and simply equivalent to ‘if’. Abelard argues 
against them that there is no reason at all to accept ‘si’ differently in (g) 
and in (d).
2.2.7. Abelard reports, then, two more positions in this controversy, 
together with counter-arguments against each position. 
One is another kind of the dissimilitudo theory (pp. 297.25-301.30). 
Text 12: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614, 
ff. 155v-156r, pp. 297.25-298.9 ed. De Rijk

si est A, est B, 
 
si necesse est esse B, est vel non est C”,

nihil illam dissimilitudinem huic pertinere videmus. Haec enim

This is the same type of the dissimilitudo theory as that reported in the 
Vienna treatise (see Text 3 above). 
The second position reported and rejected by Abelard (pp. 301.30-
303.28) is as follows. 
Text 13: Abelard, Dialectica III, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 14614, f. 156v,

2.3. Joscelin of Soissons 
A somewhat later stage of the controversy is recorded in two sources 
from the side of William’s students, Joscelin of Soissons (§ 2.3) and Walter 
of Mortagne (§ 2.4 below). 
2.3.1. SH4 
Ms Orléans 266 contains several commentaries on the De syllogismis 
hypotheticis. One of them, to which I give the number SH4, is a product 

22 
IWAKUMA YUKIO
of the school of Joscelin of Soissons, since it mentions (f. 267a) ‘noster 
m(agister) G.’ and again a little later to ‘m. Gosl.’’. 
SH4 reports the controversy as follows. 
Text 14: SH4, Ms Orléans 277, p. 271
NUNQUAM TAMEN DISSIBILITER MEDIUS TERMINUS ENUNTIATUR (842D6).

[1.1] mentions the eight if-sentences (1)-(8). The ﬁ rst is medium 
parvum, and its proof mentioned in [2.2] is the same as the one 
found in the Vienna and Escorial treatises (Text 1 above) and in 
Abelard’s Dialectica (Text 6 above). 
[1.2] alludes to the attack on the media from the dissimilitudo 
theory. The author ([2.1]) rejects the attack and says that he accepts 
almost all of the eight if-sentences (1)-(8). But the reason of his 
acceptance ([2.2-2.3]), this time, is different from those given in the 
Vienna treatise (Text 1 above) and in Abelard’s Dialectica (cf. pp. 
297.31-301.30 ed. De Rijk). According to SH4, the dissimilitudo 
theory is false in that it falsely presupposes that the ﬁ rst step of the 
proof, namely ‘α and β’, is a media propositio. 
2.3.2. SH4 continues as follows

A, non est B’, sed A posse esse sine B. Et alibi in eodem (De syl.

Unfortunately, this part is heavily corrupt. However, we can at least 
see the following facts. 
Joscelin asserts [3.1] that truth-conditions are different in categorical 
and hypothetical sentences. The truth of categorical sentences is affected 
by what happens in the world, while it is not the case with hypothetical 
sentences. Joscelin’s position is so far similar to Abelard’s (cf. § 2.2.2 
above), but he turns it into the thesis that all true hypothetical sentences 
are always necessary (semper est omnis vera necessaria), while Abelard 
says that all true hypothetical sentences are true from eternity (omnes verae 
consequentiae ab aeterno sunt verae, Dialectica III p. 279.18 ed. De Rijk). 
Joscelin reports three theories with respect to the question of what 
are true and necessary hypothetical sentences ([3.3.2]-[3.3.4]). According 
to the ﬁ rst theory ([3.3.2]), true and necessary hypothetical sentences are 
those the antecedents of which cannot be true unless the consequents are 
true; according to the second ([3.3.3]), we should add the further condition 
that antecedens in themselves require consequens. The ﬁ rst corresponds to 
what Abelard reports as necessity in a wider sense, the second to what he 
reports as necessity in the strict sense (cf. § 2.2.3 above). The ﬁ rst is the 
theory of Ulger of Angers, as I shall show below (§ 2.4.2). Abelard holds 
the second theory in his Dialecitca (cf. § 2.2.3 above), but SH4 [3.3.4] 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
27
attributes to Abelard (“ma. Pe.”) the third theory, namely that understanding 
(intellectus) of antecedents contains understandings of consequents. This 
must have been the theory at which Abelard arrived after his Dialectica. 
SH4 [4] says that Walter of Mortagne holds almost the same theory as 
Joscelin’s. Walter’s theory is recorded in more detail in another text (see 
§ 2.4 below). 
2.4. Walter of Mortagne and the De dissimilitudine terminorum 
2.4.1. The same ms, Orléans 266, contains on pp. 291a-293b another 
treatise relevant to our issue, medium. It begins as follows. 
Text 16: De dissimilitudine terminorum, Ms Orléans 266, p. 291a
Boethius dicit in Hypotheticis syllogismis  (I, 842D9-14) quod, si 
medius terminus dissimiliter enuntietur in utraque propositione, 
non possunt concludi extrema nec ullus potest ﬁ eri syllogismus 
nec propositio una. Triplex1 ergo `de´negat, in quo, ut videtur 
verum dicere, [cum] haec triaα a media propositione, in qua medius 
terminus diverso modo accipitur, removeat. Nam puto quod diverso 
modo medius terminus pronuntiari intelligit aliquo de illis sex modis 
quos Boethius (2 In Perherm., pp. 132.21-134.7) contra sophisticas 
importunitates determinari praecipit.

 α haec tria, scil. non posse concludi extrema, nec ullum 
syllogismum ﬁ eri, et non unam propositionem ﬁ eri. 
I shall call this text De dissimilitudine terminorum. The author explicitl 
says that he follows Walter of Mortagne (see Text 17 [4] below). 
After the incipit quoted above (Text 16), there follows: 
I (pp. 291a-292a): some preliminary discussions. 
II (pp. 292a-293a): discussions of the following seven sophisms. 
(i) si nulla res est, aliqua res est.  
(= SH4 (7))
(ii) si omne animal est homo, quoddam animal non est homo.  (= SH4 (8))
(iii) si omnis homo est lapis, quidam lapis est lapis.  
(= SH4 (1))
(iv) si Socrates est Plato, Socrates non est Plato.  
(= SH4 (2))
(v) si omnis homo est homo, quidam homo non est Socrates  (= SH4 (4))

IWAKUMA YUKIO
(vi) si albedo est, nigredo est.  
(= SH4 (5))
(vii) si omne ens est domus, nullum ens est domus.  
(= SH4 (3))
For each sophism, the author ﬁ rst mentions an accustomed proof 
given to the sophism; secondly he shows how the proof was attacked 
by those who held the dissimititudo theory; and ﬁ nally the author gives 
his own attack against the counterargument from the view-point of the 
dissimilitudo theory. 
III (pp. 293a-b): The author’s own solution to show that the proof of 
each sophism does not hold, having a ﬂ aw different from that shown by the 
dissimilitudo theory. 
2.4.2. A passage from the preliminary discussions (Part I) mentions 
many masters by name. 
Text 17: De dissimilitudine terminorum, Ms Orléans 266, p. 291a-b
[1.1] Sed, quia de dissimilitudine loqui ex occasione huius loci 
iam cepimus, dissimilitudin(um) diversitates, quae secundum 
quorundam reputationes extremorum conclusionem impedire

[1.2] Et, quia necessitas consequentiae praepediri dissimilitudine1 
videtur, prius de necessitate consequentiarum loquamur; et, an omnis 
vera <consequentia> sit necessaria, et e converso, sicut m. Gosl’ dicit 
et quidam alii, seu non omnis vera sit necessaria, rimemur. 
[2] M. itaque G., qui omnem, ut praemissum est, veram 
consequentiam necessariam dicit, necessariam in absolutam 
necessariam et determinatam necessariam dividit. Necessariam 
autem absolutam illam aestimat cuius veritatem, postquam semel 
est inventa, nec varietas temporum nec permutatio rerum alterat, ut 
 
Socrates est homo. 
Necessariam vero determinatam dicit quam non rerum natura 
semper veram, immo veram aliquando <quando> aliquis rerum 
eventus efﬁ cit, ut haec 
 
si Socrates est Socrates, tunc Socrates sedet. 
Non enim ista semper est vera, nisi tunc tantum quando Socrates 
sedet.

[3] M. autem Petrus non omnem veram reputat2 esse necessariam, 
quia illam tantum necessariam arbitratur cuius antecedentis sententia 
consequentis claudit sententiam (sententiam vero idem esse quod 
intellectum dicit), ut 
 
si est homo, est animal. 
Hanc enim propositionem ‘Socrates est homo’ tres intellectus putat 
habere, id est ‘Socrates est animal’ ‘Socrates est rationalis’ ‘Socrates 
est mortalis’; et sic istius propositionis intellectus, quae est ‘Socrates 
est homo’, huius alterius, quae est ‘Socrates est animal’, intellectum 
sicut et reliquarum duarum quas continet, dicit continere. 
[4] Sed m. Galt(er)ius, ut dictum est, relictis quibus in hac uti 
solebat solutione circumlocutionibus, ad meliorem se contulit 
sent(ent)ia<m>, quam nos tenemus. Nos autem |291b| illam veram 
consequentiam sive necessariam esse dicimus, cuius dividentis 
verus esse nequit intellectus.

solent dicere, cuius antecedens non potest esse sine consequente. ...

This passage gives a summary of what is already known to us, namely 
[1] that the controversy began with the attack from the point of view of 
the disimilitudo theory, [2] the theory of Joscelin of Soissons, and [3] 
Abelard’s later theory. In addition, [4] it gives information on the theory of 
Walter of Mortagne, namely that true and necessary hypothetical sentences 
are those whose consequents’ negation cannot be true, and [5] tells us that 
the theory according to which necessary hypothetical sentences are those 
whose antecedents cannot be true unless their consequents are true is from 
Ulger of Angers.
2.4.3. All of the seven sophisms ((i)-(vii)) discussed in Part II are 
exactly the same as those enumerated in SH4 (Text 14 [1.1] above). But 
the author explicitly calls them sophismata. On that point the position the 
author takes is contrary to SH4, which accepts them as true sentences. 
Now, (iii) in the De dissimilitudine terminorum is the same as medium 
parvum and is called so by the author. Moreover its proof (cf. Text 18 [1]) 
runs parallel to that which is now familiar to us.

Text 18: De dissimilitudine terminorum, Ms Orléans 266, p. 292a-b
Huic etiam argumentationi parvi medii dissimilitudinem inferunt, 
per quam conclusionem impediri dicunt. Cuius medii terminorum 
notitia talis est: 
 
 (iii) si (A1) omnis homo est lapis, (A3) quidam lapis est 
lapis. 
[1] Quod solet probari, sic. Si (A1) omnis homo est lapis, (A1') 
omne non lapis est non homo; et sic (A1) omnis homo est lapis. 
Item si (A1) omnis homo est lapis, (A2) quidam lapis est homo. 
Et, si verae sunt istae duae (A2) ‘quidam lapis est homo’ et (A1) 
‘omnis homo est lapis’, vera est (A3) ‘quidam lapis est lapis’. A 
praedicato. Regula: SI QUID PRAEDICATUR DE ALIQUO PARTICULARITER, 
ALIUD +PRAEDICATUM DE+ PRAEDICATO UNIVERSALITER, ILLUD IDEM 
PRAEDICATUR DE SUBIECTO PRIORIS PRAEDICATI PARTICULARITER. 
[2] Hanc igitur conclusionem tali dicunt infringi dissimilitudine, 
qua dictitant in priori argumentatione illas duas propositiones, id 
est (A2) ‘quidam lapis est homo’ et (A1) ‘omnis homo est lapis’, ad 
illam quae est (A3) ‘quidam1 lapis est lapis’, ut duas consequi, et illas 
easdem conﬁ rmant in sequenti consequentia ut unum antecedere. 
[3] Quod qualiter unum sit, videat qui potest, quia ego nequeo 
videre. Non enim, puto, eos velle quod coniunctio interposita de 
duabus unam faciat, cum Boethius (2 In Perherm. II.5, p. 109.22-28) 
istam ‘Iupiter tonat’ et ‘Iuno ninguit’ multiplicem, id est non unam 
sed multas propositiones, esse dicat. Per quod plane velle videtur 
quod per interpositam coniunctionem duae propositiones in unam 
non redigantur. Si enim idcirco +illas+ ibi dicunt ut duo consequi, 
hic autem velut unum antecedere, quia ibi cum duabus, hic autem 
una enuntiantur prolatione, nos e converso hic cum duabus quidem

eandem causam, hic tanquam unum an<te>cedere, ibi quasi duo 
consequi convincamus.

2.4.4. Text 18 [2] above gives a counter-argument against the proof 
of (iii), and [3] rejects the counter-argument. The author of the De 
dissimilitudine terminorum thus appears to agree with Joscelin of Soissons 
and Abelard in that he accepts the truth of (iii) as well as the validity of its 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
31
proof. However, the author gives in Part III his own answer to the sophism 
(iii). 
Text 19: De dissimilitudine terminorum, Ms Orléans 266, p. 293b
Hanc etiam argumentationem, per quam 
 
(iii) si omnis homo est lapis, quidam lapis est lapis 
<probatur>, sic possumus denegare, ut dicamus ex his duabus 
propositionibus (A2) ‘quidam lapis est homo’ et (A1) ‘omnis 
homo est lapis’ haec consequens (A3) ‘quidam lapis est lapis’ non 
procedere. 
Quodsi quis ad hoc probandum illam <regulam> quam 
praemisimus a praedic(a)to velit afferre, r(espondemus) neque 
per r(egulam) aliquam consequentiam veriﬁ cari concedimus, 
neque ex consequentia regulam. Si enim quia vera est r(egula) 
vera est consequentia, et quia non est vera consequentia nec vera 
est r(egula). Quod falsum est. Potest namque vera esse regula, nec 
tamen vera erit consequentia, quia nec erit consequentia nisi sit qui 
eam proferat. Similiter quoque vera potest esse consequentia, nec 
tamen ideo vera erit regula, cunctis tacentibus, quia nec etiam erit. 
Regula enim et consequentia diversi sunt aeres nulla habitudine se 
exigentes. 
According to the author, the rule a praedicato, which was the basis 
of the proof, does not conﬁ rm (iii), because the rule a praedicato and the 
sentence (iii) are different airs (i.e. distinct physical phenomena), and so, 
if nobody utters the rule or the sentence, the rule a praedicato can be true 
while the sentence (iii) is not, and vice versa, since what is not uttered is 
not true (since it is not existent). Strange assertion! By the same token, one 
could deny any inferences by any rules! However, when the author says 
that the rule and the sentence are different airs, he presupposes the vox-in-
substantia theory, which was the issue at stake in the early 12th century9. 
Now, SH4 reports that Walter of Mortagne held almost the same 
theory as Joscelin of Soissons, but that Walter attributed necessity not only 
to true sentences but also to false ones (Text 15 [4] above). What it means 
9 With respect to the vox-in-substantia theory and the controversy over it, see 
IWAKUMA, «Vocales Revisited», pp. 81-171, at §§ 5.3.1-5.3.4, and pp. 113-116.

seems to be that Walter accepts (iii) as necessary, and that (iii) can at the 
same time be a non-true sentence or deprived of any truth-value (as well as 
of any other properties), viz. when it is not uttered.

3.1. Pecuriality of the Parisian Media
This treatise is of a different character from those so far discussed in 
this paper. It does not discuss any media common to the others. Among 
the eight sentences discussed here, only the ﬁ rst three ((1)-(3)) bear some 
similarity with the media known so far, in that they have a form X¨(Y¨Z), 
and that their categorical constituents are nonsense such as ‘omnis homo 
est lapis’ or ‘omnis homo est homo’. The last four ((5)-(8)), on the other 
hand, have much more complicated forms, and all are, together with (2), 
tautologies from the modern point of view, albeit some of categorical 
constituents are again nonsense. That might also be the case with (4); 
indeed, although its discussion is incomplete (it ends with a lacuna), it can 
very well be a tautology if we ﬁ ll the gaps as suggested in the list above. 
3.2. William of Champeaux’s discussion of syllogisms
In order to understand this Parisian treatise on mediis, we ﬁ rst have 
to note that the discussion of syllogisms in the Vienna and Escorial 
Introductiones is unusual. Both the Introductiones deal with syllogisms as 
part of discussions of hypothetical propositions. That is to say, categorical 
syllogisms are discussed in such a form as 
si omne S est M, tunc, si omne M est P, omne S est P, 
while Boethius discusses them in the form 
omne S est M, omne M est P, ergo omne S est P. 
The same applies to hypothetical syllogisms. 

 
ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
35
A closer examination shows further intriguing features of the 
discussion of categorical syllogisms in the Introductiones. 
There aren’t any references to the Aristotelian-Boethian distinctions 
of modes and ﬁ gures. Instead, the two Introductiones divide categorical 
syllogisms according to the distinction of whether the inferential force (vis 
inferentiae) is in the subject term or in the predicate. Accordingly, some 
valid syllogisms are discussed twice, once as those whose inferential force 
lies in the subject term, and once more as those whose inferential force lies 
in the predicate12. 
The two Introductiones do not touch upon some of the valid syllogisms 
discussed in Boethius’ De syllogismis categoricis13. At the same time, the 
Escorial Introductiones discuss Camestrop and Camenop14, which are not 
mentioned in Boethius’ De categoricis syllogismis, nor in Aristotle’s Prior 
Analytics, nor in any other medieval discussion of syllogisms. Moreover, 
some invalid syllogisms are afﬁ rmatively mentioned in the Escorial 
Introductiones15. 
Among syllogisms, both the Introductiones discuss strange non-
syllogistic sentences of such forms as 
i) si omne S est P, tunc si omne P est S, omne S est P. (Vienna 5.1 
(2), Escorial 8.2) 
ii) si omne S est P, tunc, si quoddam P non est S, quoddam S non est 
P. (Escorial 8.7) 
iii) si omne S est P, tunc, si nullum P est P, nullum S est S. (Vienna 
5.1 (5), Escorial 8.3) 
iv) si omne S est P, tunc, si quoddam S est S, quoddam P est P. 
(Vienna 5.2 (3), Escorial 8.8) 
We should note here that i) has the same form as medium (2) of the 
Parisian treatise, although the term for P is different. 
12 The ﬁ rst mode of the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure is repeated in the Vienna Introductiones 5.1(1) 
and 5.2(1), in the Escorial Introductiones 8.1 and 8.10. The second mode of the ﬁ rst 
ﬁ gure in the Escorial 8.4 and 8.23. The forth mode of the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure in the Escorial 
8.14 and 8.23. And the forth mode of the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure in the Escorial 8.5 and 8.26.
13 The Vienna Introductiones discuss only syllogisms I.1-3, II.2 and 4, III.1 and 3. 
The Escorial treatise lacks the discussions of I.5 and 6, and III.1.
14 For Camestrop, see the Escorial Introductiones 8.21; and for Camenop, see the 
Escorial Introductiones 8.25. 
15 It is the case with Escorial 8.15, 8.16, and 8.27; cf. also 8.19.

For hypothetical syllogisms too, the treatment of the two Introductiones 
is completely different from that in Boethius’ De syllogismis hypotheticis. 
Boethius ﬁ rst distinguishes different types of hypothetical sentences and 
then makes various syllogisms with the modus ponens and modus tollens 
for each type of hypothetical sentences. For example, he construes twofold 
syllogisms from hypothetical propositions of the form ‘si est A, est B’, as 
follows:
 
si est A, est B; sed est A; ergo est B, 
or  
si est A, est B; sed non est B; ergo non est A. 
The two Introductiones, on the other hand, give various rules without 
proof, such as 
quicquid sequitur ad consequens, sequitur ad antecedens. 
A ¨ C, C ¨ X ⊢ A ¨ X. 
This rule, which they call ab antecedenti, is valid from our modern 
point of view, but it is never found in Boethius’ works, nor is it a hypothetical 
syllogism in the Boethian sense at all. In such a rule the antecedent and the 
consequent can well have different subjects, but Boethius deals only with 
syllogisms whose categorical constituents have the same subjects. 
As I have shown elsewhere16, the two Introductiones were so inﬂ uential 
that many texts were later written on their model; but in all of later works, 
syllogisms, both categorical and hypothetical, are discussed faithfully 
following Boethius. This shows that the strange discussion in the two 
Introductiones came soon to be forgotten and replaced by the Boethian one. 
These facts strongly suggest that the doctrine of syllogisms contained 
in the two Introductiones was developed under circumstances in which

ON MEDIUM IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY 
37
there was little knowlegde of Boethius’ monographs on syllogisms. It is 
true that the De syllogismis hypotheticis is referred to in the Vienna treatise 
(see Text 3 above), and that, by way of consequence, the De syllogismis 
hypotheticis was already known when the Vienna treatise was written; but 
the doctrine itself was obviously formed without knowledge of Boethius’ 
works. 
It might perhaps be the case that Peter Abelard brought the knowledge 
of Boethius’ monographs on syllogisms to Paris. The monographs were 
known well within the proto-vocalists sect17. A treatise written in the syle of 
the Introductiones preserved in the ms Paris lat. 544 ff. 110r-114r18 contains 
a genuinely Boethian discussion of syllogisms, and it was certainly written 
by a proto-vocalist in the late 11th century. 
3.3. Parisian Media and William’s discussion of syllogisms
Going back to the Parisian treatise on mediis, many media discussed 
there present a remarkable similarity with hypothetical sentences discussed 
in the two Introductiones, as is shown in the following table.

It is remarkable that all the sentences listed here are tautologies in the 
sense of our modern classical propositional logic. 
The two Introductiones did not give proofs for any of them, but the 
Parisian treatise gives thourough proofs for the last four media (for medium 
(4) there is no proof, but a lacuna in the ms). For example, the proof of (5) 
runs as follows.

When we presuppose the deduction theory, namely 
 
 P ⊢ Q ⇒   ⊢ P¨Q,
[3.1] and [3.3] are themselves valid by the rule a consequenti, viz. 
 
 A¨C, C¨P   ⊢ A¨P, 
which is shown by the words ubi nihil est (‘there is nothing to prove 
further’). Replace A with X, C with Y→Z and P with W→Y in [3.1]; and 
A with W, C with Y and P with Z in [3.3]. The rule a consequenti validates, 
too, that [2]=[3.2] follows from [3.3] and [3.1]. Replace A with X¨(Y¨Z), 
C with W¨Y and P with X¨(W¨Z).

All the proofs of (6)-(8) proceed likewise, only the following three 
rules being unproved:
Ab antecedenti  
A¨C, P¨A ⊢ P¨C 
A consequenti  
A¨C, C¨P ⊢ A¨P 
Ab antecedenti et consequenti 
  
 
A¨C, P¨A, C¨Q ⊢ P¨Q; 
(the deduction theory is always presupposed tacitly). It might also be the 
case with (4), the discussion of which, ending on a lacuna, is incomplete. 
In this way, we may reckon the parts (4)-(8) as a kind of formalization of 
propositional logic without axioms and with three deductive rules. In fact, 
employing the same method, it would be possible in principle to produce a 
group of inﬁ nite tautological propositions. 
It is, however, impossible to apply this view to the parts (1)-(3). Be 
that as it may, historically speaking, there wasn’t any further signiﬁ cant 
development in the direction of such a formalization. Attempts of this kind, 
provided there were any, were soon forgotten and replaced by Boethius’ 
theory of hypothetical syllogisms, which is essentially different from our 
modern propositional logic. 
Conclusions 
Without knowing Boethius’ monographs on syllogisms, William of 
Champeaux developed a discussion of media or true if-sentences proved 
by per medium arguments, giving special names such as medium parvum 
etc. to those of them which are true in spite of the fact that they have 
false antecedents and/or false consequents. Peter Abelard arrived at Paris 
around the turn of the century, perhaps with the knowledge of Boethius’ 
monographs on syllogisms. William’s discussion of media came to be 
attacked by the dissimilitudo theory, which was supported by Boethius’ 
De syllogismis hypotheticis. This attack provoked controversies, involving 
many younger masters like Peter Abelard, Joscelin of Soissons, Walter 
of Mortagne, Ulger of Angers, and others; and through the controversy 
they each deepened their thought on the nature of logical entailment. This 
polemical situation offered a possibility of developing something like the 
modern formalization of propositional logic. But the possibility declined 
soon, with the acceptance of Boethius’ theory of syllogisms.

JOHN MACFARLANE*
ABELARD’S ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY
 
Introduction
Buridan deﬁ nes a formal consequence as one in which no categorematic 
terms occur essentially –one that remains valid no matter what the matter, 
provided we keep the form the same1. A material consequence, by contrast, is 
one that fails to hold «in all terms, keeping the form alike». So, for example,
(1) A man runs. Therefore an animal runs.
is a material, but not a formal consequence, because the consequence can 
be destroyed by substituting «horse» for «man» and «wood» for «animal». 
Similar deﬁ nitions of formal and material consequence can be found in 
Pseudo-Scotus and Albert of Saxony2.
Two things are striking about this medieval deﬁ nition. The ﬁ rst is 
that it is very close to the modern conception of formal consequence one 
ﬁ nds in Bolzano and Tarski3. The second is that although Buridan and the 
other fourteenth-century logicians state these distinctions with a great deal 
of precision, they say almost nothing about the point of the distinctions. 
Why are these distinctions drawn in the way they are? What philosophical 
purpose do they serve?
Although the resemblance of the medieval distinction to the modern 
one has been widely noted, the lack of explicit motivation has not. I suspect 
that is because we ﬁ nd the distinction so familiar and natural that we do 
not not pause to think about what motivates it. But the question should be a

live one for us, as well. We can sort good inferences into those that can be 
turned into bad ones by uniform substitution of nonlogical vocabulary, and 
those that cannot. But what is so special about the inferences in the latter 
class, the ones we call «formally valid»? Consider this pair:
(2) Snow is white, everything white is colored; therefore, snow is 
colored.
(3) Snow is white. Therefore, snow is colored.
Is my knowledge that (2) is a good inference any more certain or apriori than 
my knowledge that (3) is a good inference? Presumably not. Why, then, do we 
care about the distinction between formally and materially valid inferences? 
Is it just that the formally valid inferences are more amenable to systematic 
treatment? But then, thinking of them as valid in a special way –formally 
valid– would be akin to thinking of stars that can be studied using terrestrial 
telescopes as a special kind of stars –telescopically accessible stars4.
Those who want to avoid this deﬂ ationary conception might be 
tempted to something like the following line of thought. An inference like 
(3) owes its validity to a fact about the world –the fact that whatever is 
white is colored. Not a very exciting fact, perhaps, and one that can be 
known apriori –but a fact nonetheless. In contrast, the validity of (2) does 
not depend on any fact about white things, snow, or anything else. (2) is 
valid entirely in virtue of its form or construction; its validity does not 
depend on any fact about the world, however general. Generalizing, we 
might say that formally valid inferences are inferences whose validity is 
not grounded in any fact about the world. Of course, the claim that there 
are such inferences is a substantive one. Let us call it the
Formality Thesis: There are inferences whose validity is entirely 
grounded in their forms, and does not depend on any fact about the 
world5.

(there are inferences that are valid solely in virtue of their forms, and not at all in 

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY 
43
The Formality Thesis goes with a view of logic that seems quite natural. 
On this view, the role of logic is to help us make explicit everything on 
which an inference depends. When we have teased out hidden assumptions 
to the point where we have a formally valid argument, then we know that 
the process of explicitation has come to an end; we have made all of the 
assumptions on which the inference depends explicit. We could not think 
of logic this way if the Formality Thesis did not hold, since there would 
always be further facts on which the validity of an inference depends, 
which could in principle be made explicit as further premises.
As natural as it may seem, though, the Formality Thesis is a substantive 
and controversial thesis. It does not follow immediately from the fact that 
inference (2) holds «in all matter» –that is, on all uniform substitutions of 
nonlogical terms– that it is good solely in virtue of its form, independently 
of any facts about the world. Although the schema
(4) X is prime. X > 2. Therefore, X is odd.
yields a good inference for every substitution for X, the goodness of these 
inferences is grounded in a fact about primes –namely, that every prime 
greater than 2 is odd. So clearly the inference from «every instance of the 
schema is a good inference» to «the instances are good solely in virtue 
of being instances of the schema» is not a good one in general. Maybe it 
is cogent when we restrict ourselves to schemata of a certain kind –those 
in which the only ﬁ xed terms are «logical constants». But if so, that is 
something that requires showing.
Which brings me, at last, to Abelard. Abelard interests me because, 
unlike later medieval logicians, he offers an argument for the Formality 
Thesis –a thesis his predecessors seem to have rejected. This argument 
motivates his distinction between formal and material consequence –or, 
in his terminology, perfect and imperfect entailment (inferentia6). He does 
not slide from «good in all matter» to «good in virtue of form»; indeed, 
he recognizes inferences that are good in all matter but depend for their 
virtue of any facts about the world) and an epistemological thesis (there are inferences 
that we can know to be valid solely on the basis of knowledge of their forms, and 
independently of any knowledge of facts about the world).
6 In translating inferentia as «entailment», I follow C. MARTIN, «Logic», in 
J. E. BROWER – K. GUILFOY (eds.), The Cambridge Companion to Abelard, Cambridge 
University Press, Cambridge 2004, pp. 158-199.

JOHN MACFARLANE
validity on facts about the world. He gives a much subtler argument –and 
it is a good argument, in its philosophical context. But it is not an argument 
that can give us a good reason to accept the Formality Thesis.
Perfect and imperfect inferentia
An entailment is perfect, Abelard says, when
[…] from the structure (complexio) of the antecedent itself, the truth 
of the consequent is manifest, and the construction (constructio) of 
the antececent is so disposed that it contains also the construction 
of the consequent in itself, just as in syllogisms or in conditionals 
which have the form of syllogisms. (253.31-254.1)7
For example,
(5)  If every man is an animal and every animal is alive, every man 
is alive. (254.35)8
An entailment is imperfect, by contrast, when the connection between 
antecedent and consequent takes its necessity «from the nature of things» 
(ex rerum natura, 255.7-8), not from the construction of the antecedent and 
consequent, as in
(6) If every man is an animal, every man is alive. (255.3)
Both perfect and imperfect entailments require a necessary connection 
between antecedent and consequent –indeed, the sense of the consequent must 
be contained in the sense of the antecedent (283.37-284.8). The difference is 
not in the strength of the modal connection (255.12-13), but in its ground.
Given these deﬁ nitions, the thesis that some entailments are perfect 
amounts to the Formality Thesis9.

The dialectical background
Abelard’s discussion of perfect and imperfect entailments takes place in 
the section of the Dialectica entitled «Of Topics». That may seem surprising, 
since in Aristotle the topics are means for the discovery of valid syllogisms, 
rather than grounds for their validity10. However, by late antiquity it had 
become standard to conceive of the Topical maxims as axioms on which the 
validity of arguments might rest. In De Topicis Differentiis Boethius deﬁ nes 
a maximal proposition as a «maximal, universal, principal, indemonstrable, 
and known per se proposition, which in argumentation gives force to 
arguments and to propositions»11. For example, the maxim
(7) Whatever is present to the genus is present to the species
«supplies force to» the argument below and «makes [it] complete from 
without» (1188B-C):
consequences, it is an eternal truth (279.18). But if man and animal did not exist, then 
(as will be explained later in this essay) there would be no locus differentia and hence 
no Topical grounding. So the fact that man is species of animal cannot be the cause of 
the entailment (consecutio) but only its proof (probatio) (265.10-12). This suggests 
that what distinguishes perfect inferences from imperfect ones is a special epistemic 
character: their validity can be known independently of all knowledge about the world.
10 For this view of Aristotle’s Topics, see J. ALLEN, «The Development of 
Aristotle’s Logic: Part of an Account in Outline», in J. J. CLEARY – W. C. WIANS (eds.),

the Commentaries on Aristotle’s and Boethius’ «Topics», Philosophia Verlag, Munich – 
Vienna 1984, p. 23. A contrasting view understands Aristotelian topical maxims as 
quasi-logical laws that ground the validity of the inferences to which they are applied:

Topiques», in Aristotle on Dialectic: The Topics (Proceedings of the Third Symposium 
Aristotelicum), Oxford University Press, Oxford 1968, pp. 166, 174. But Aristotle does 
not seem to think that the acceptability of the particular syllogisms that fall under a 
topic depends on the acceptability of the general rules he gives; if he did, it would be 
difﬁ cult to make sense of the fact that he often acknowledges counterexamples to the 
maxims (e.g. at Top. 115b14, 117a18, 117b14, 121b30, 123b17, 124b19, 128b6).

(8)  Every virtue is advantageous. Justice is a virtue. Therefore, 
justice is advantageous.
Commentators have wondered how the maxim here can play the role 
Boethius assigns it, of supplying force to the argument and completing it 
from without, when (8) has the form of a valid categorical syllogism12. But 
the problem only arises if we assume that valid categorical syllogisms are 
distinguished from other forms of arguments by the fact that they require 
no external validation. Boethius shows no sign of accepting this view.
Sten Ebbesen claims that for Boethius as for Galen, «every inference 
owes its cogency to an axiom»:
The implication of the Boethian theory would seem to be that 
all proof proceeds, implicitly or explicitly, by instantiation and 
detachment and, as some medievals saw, that a categorical syllogism 
is not anything sui generis, as it depends on a law of inference of 
the same type as the ones that licence inferences involving other 
relations than plain predication13.
It is not clear that Boethius himself accepts all these implications. But 
eleventh and twelfth-century logicians, whose main sources for syllogistic 
theory were the works of Boethius, embrace them explicitly. In his 
Dialectica, Garlandus Compotista says that the theory of Topics is prior 
to the theory of categorical and hypothetical syllogistic, and all syllogisms 
are ratiﬁ ed by topical maxims (per maximam propositionem sillogismus 
approbatur)14. For instance, the syllogism
(9)  Every animal is a substance. Every man is an animal. Therefore, 
every man is a substance.

(10)  that which is universally attributed to the whole is [also 
universally attributed] to the part (quod universaliter attribuitur 
toti, et parti)15.
More generally, «categorical syllogisms are aided by the Topics from the 
whole and from the part and from an equal» (114.18)16.
The early twelfth-century works on the Topics collected in Logica 
Modernorum17 seem to follow Garlandus in taking all syllogisms to be 
validated by topical maxims. The Introductiones dialectice Berolinenses, 
for instance, take all syllogisms in the mood Barbara to be licensed by the 
following topical maxim:
(11)  If something is predicated universally of something, then if 
something else is predicated universally of the predicate, that 
same thing is predicated universally of the subject18.
Abelard’s picture of the Topics is largely taken over from this 
Boethian tradition. The function of a Topic, according to Abelard, is to 
confer inferential force on an entailment by grounding it in a real relation 
among the things to which its terms refer (256.35-257.1). For example, 
the conditional «if it is a man, it is an animal» is justiﬁ ed by the Topic 
from species, since man is a species of animal, and we know that genus 
necessarily applies to species (257.4-5). Following Boethius, Abelard 
takes a Topic to have two components: a locus differentia and a maxima 
propositio. The locus differentia (henceforth Differentia) is «that thing in 
the relation of which to something else the soundness of the entailment 
consists» (ea res in cuius habitudine ad aliam ﬁ rmitas consecutionis 
15 Ibid., 92.29.
16 Garlandus was anticipated in this view by Abbo of Fleury (945-1004) and other 
early commentators on the Boethian Topics (see N. J. GREEN-PEDERSEN, The Tradition 
of the Topics, pp. 144, 152). Green-Pedersen summarizes the pre-1100 works by 
saying that they take the Topics to be an «[…] ‘underlying logic’ which shows or 
explains why the arguments are valid» (p. 160). See also E. STUMP, Dialectic and Its 
Place in the Development of Medieval Logic, Cornell University Press, Ithaca 1989,

Medieval Philosophy, op. cit., p. 277.

consistit, 263.7-8). Although the Differentiae are things, not relations, 
they count as Topical Differentiae only insofar as they stand in relations to 
other things19. In the example, the Differentia is man, which stands in the 
species relation to animal. The maxima propositio (henceforth maxim) is a 
general proposition justifying an inference from an antecedent proposition 
containing a term for the Differentia to a consequent proposition containing 
a term for the thing to which it is related. In the example, the maxim is 
«of whatever the species is predicated, so is the genus» (de quocumque 
praedicatur species, et genus, 263.18).
Abelard’s strikingly original move is to insist that some entailments do 
not stand in need of topical grounding at all ([…] quia ita in se perfectae sunt 
huiusmodi inferentiae ut nulla habitudinis natura indigeant, nullam ex loco 
ﬁ rmitatem habent, 256.34-5). Perfect entailments, he says, do not «take their 
truth […] from the nature of things» (256.21-2). A sign of this independence 
from things, Abelard claims, is that perfect consequences remain true 
in «whatever terms you substitute» (255.32-3), whereas an imperfect 
consequence «depends on the nature of things» and does not «remain true in 
any terms whatsoever, but only in those which preserve the nature of the entail-
ment» (356.8-10). For example, the entailment in «if it is man, it is animal» 
can be destroyed by replacing «man» or «animal» with «stone» (356.15-19).
Therefore those consequences are correctly said to be true from the 
nature of things of which the truth varies together with the nature of 
things. But those [consequences] of which the construction preserves 
its necessity equally in any things at all, no matter what relations 
they have, take their truth from the construction (complexione), not 
from the nature of things… (256.20-23)
This is all that later medieval writers typically say about the distinction 
between formal and material consequence: formal consequences hold «in 
all terms». But Abelard cannot stop here, for as we have seen, the dominant 
view at the time he is writing –and a view he explicitly attributes to Boethius 
and Porphyry (257.32-258.13)– is that categorical syllogisms and other 
perfect entailments are grounded in Topics. A proponent of such a view 
could grant that syllogisms preserve validity in all substitution instances, 
and maintain either that
19 GREEN-PEDERSEN, The Tradition of the Topics, p. 167.

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY 
49
1.  for each instance, there is a Topic grounding the entailment in 
some speciﬁ c relation that holds between the things it concerns, or 
that
2.  there is a single Topic that grounds all of the instances in some 
very general relations that hold between things.
Abelard offers arguments against both approaches (258-262 in his 
treatment of inferences, 352-365 in his treatment of conditionals). It is a 
measure of the success of these arguments, I think, that they do not get 
repeated: it becomes customary in later medieval manuals to infer from 
an inference’s being good «in all terms» to its being good «in virtue of its 
construction» and not in virtue of the nature of things. But as we have seen, 
Abelard cannot take this inference for granted. Indeed, he does not even 
think that it is unrestrictedly valid. He claims that the consequence
(12) If it is alive, it is alive,
which certainly holds in all substitution instances, is not perfect in its 
construction (ad inferentis constructionem): one would have to add the premise 
«[…] and everything that is alive is alive» (255.19-27)20. Evidently, then, there 
is more to perfection than mere preservation of validity «in all terms».
Abelard makes this point explicitly in his discussion of the hypothetical 
syllogisms. Boethius had taken certain instances of what we now call 
«afﬁ rming the consequent» to be valid by virtue of «the nature of the 
things, in which alone these propositions can be asserted»21. For example, 
in the inference
(13) If it is not a, it is b; but it is a; thus it is not b,
Boethius claims, the major premise can only be true when the terms a and 
b are contraries, like «day» and «night». But when a and b are contraries, 
20 This means that the one-premise conversion inferences necessary for the 
reduction of second- and third-ﬁ gure syllogisms to the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure cannot count as 
perfect. It seems odd that the validation of second- and third-ﬁ gure syllogisms, which 
are perfect in Abelard’s sense, should require the use of an imperfect inference. Does 
Abelard ever discuss this issue?

traduzione, Logicalia; testi classici di logica, Paideia, Brescia 1969, II.ii.4-5.

JOHN MACFARLANE
and it is a, then it follows that it is not b. Hence the inference is valid for 
all substitution instances in which the premises are true. In fact, Abelard 
thinks Boethius’ claim that «if it is not a, it is b» can only be true when a 
and b are contraries is simply wrong: «if it is not a, it is b» can be true, he 
notes, when a is «animal» and b is «non-man» (499). But he goes on to 
say that, even if Boethius were right that a and b had to be contraries, and 
thus that no formal counterexample to the inference could be given, this 
fact would not show that such inferences are syllogisms (and hence perfect 
entailments):
Even if it were possible, whenever the consequent were afﬁ rmed, 
necessarily to afﬁ rm the antececent from any property whatever 
–nevertheless there would be no form of syllogism in which, the 
consequent having been afﬁ rmed in this way, one could afﬁ rm the 
antecedent, or the antecedent having been denied, one could deny 
the consequent, since the entailment of a syllogism is supposed to 
be so perfect that no relation of things pertains to it. (502.19-25).
To say that an entailment is «perfect» is to say that our knowledge of its 
validity is completely independent of our knowledge of «the nature of 
things». Even if Boethius were right that (13) held in all terms for which 
the premise could be true, that would not be something we could know 
without knowing something about «the nature of things» –the relations 
of contraiety between a and b. An entailment that holds in all terms, then, 
need not be good in virtue of its construction.
Abelard’s arguments that syllogisms are perfect entailments
Let us now consider Abelard’s arguments for the claim that syllogisms 
do not have Topical grounding. Recall that there are two ways in which 
one might oppose Abelard’s claim. First, one might argue that the 
validity of each individual syllogism is grounded in a particular relation 
between things (the local strategy). Second, one might argue that there is 
a single, very general relation between things that grounds the validity of 
all syllogisms in a particular mood (the global strategy). Abelard shows 
that neither approach will work. In my discussion, I will consider only 
categorical syllogisms, though Abelard brings similar considerations to 
bear on hypothetical ones.

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY 
51
The local strategy
Given a particular categorical syllogism, the obvious place to look for 
a Topical Differentia is in the middle term. For example, in the syllogism
(14)  All animals are alive. All men are animals. Therefore, all men 
are alive.
one might naturally take «animal» to be the Differentia and apply the Topic 
«from the genus», with the maxim «whatever is predicated of the genus is 
also predicated of the species». But as Abelard points out, this Topic would 
only explain the entailment from the second premise to the conclusion, not 
the entailment from both premises together (258.14-17; cf. 356.4-11).
Even this kind of Topical grounding will be impossible when 
syllogisms have false or accidentally true premises, for example:
(15)  Every body is colored. But everything sitting is a body. 
Therefore, everything sitting is colored (260.18-27).
In such a syllogism, «none of the propositions by themselves necessarily 
imply the conclusion» (260.19-20). For there is no real relation in the nature 
of things that could license the transition from either of these premises by 
itself to the conclusion22. Body, for instance, is not the genus of sitting 
thing, nor is colored thing the genus of body23. The only relation between 
terms to which we might appeal here is the relation of predication: colored 
is universally predicated of body, and body of sitting thing (cf. 259.1-9). 
But «A is universally predicated of B» might taken to express either
(a)  that A is asserted of all B (secundum vocum enuntiationem), or
(b)  that in the order of things, A is true of all B (secondum rerum 
cohaerentiam) (353.10-12; cf. 329.19-35).
22 Similar considerations lead Abelard to claim that «if man is a species of stone, 
then if [something] is a man, it is a stone» is good in virtue of its construction (312). It 
could not take its necessity from «the nature of things», because in the nature of things 
man is not a species of stone. (312-3).
23 Abelard says at 285.20-29 that «if it is body, it is colored» is only accidentally 
true.

52 
JOHN MACFARLANE
If it means merely (a) that A is asserted of all B, then it clearly cannot 
ground a necessary entailment from «every C is B» to «every C is A»:
For who would concede that if «stone» were asserted universally 
of «man» in some assertion, whether true or false, the consequence 
which follows [i.e., «if every stone is an ass, then every man is 
an ass», 353.5] would be true? This is why we can assert «stone» 
(or anything else we like) of «man», but our assertion, which is 
manifestly false, confers no truth on the consequence. (353.15-19)
If, on the other hand, the relation «A is universally predicated of B» means 
that A is true of all B, then it is of no use in syllogisms with false premises, 
such as
(16)  All men are stones. All stones are asses. Therefore, all men are 
asses (353.5).
Nor is it of any use when it is merely accidental that A holds of all B, since 
entailment must be necessary (cf. 362.30-1). There are some categorical 
syllogisms, then, for which no local topical maxim can be found. And once 
we accept that one syllogism in Barbara holds in virtue of its construction, 
we might as well accept that all do (since all have the same construction).
The global strategy
If the validity of categorical syllogisms depends on a Topical maxim, 
then, it must be a maxim that captures the dependence of the conclusion 
on both premises. Syllogisms in Barbara, for instance, might be thought to 
depend on the rule:
(17)  If B is predicated of A universally and C is predicated of B 
universally, then C is predicated also of A universally24,
24 I have used schematic letters to make the principle clearer. Abelard uses 
pronouns: «si aliquid praedicatur de alio universaliter et aliud praedicatur de praedicato 
universaliter, illud idem praedicatur et de subiecto universaliter» (261.14-16). There 
is a corresponding principle for hypothetical syllogisms: «si aliquid infert aliud et id 
quod inferat existat, id quoque quod infertur necesse est existere» (261.25-6).

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY 
53
where «predicated of» is taken secundum rerum cohaerentiam. Might (17) 
be a Topical maxim that gives syllogisms in Barbara their inferential force?
Abelard’s strategy here is to argue that (17), while perhaps a true 
rule (regula), is not a Topical maxim, because it lacks a corresponding 
Differentia (261.34-5, 265.25-266.2)25. The argument that (17) lacks a 
Differentia is basically the same as the argument (rehearsed above) that 
particular syllogisms lack a Differentia. The Differentia would have to 
be some thing (res) that is predicated universally of some term in the 
conclusion. The only obvious candidate is the middle term (B). But the fact 
that B is predicated of all A could at best explain the entailment from one 
premise of the syllogism to the conclusion (from «every B is C» to «every 
A is C»), not the entailment from both premises to the conclusion. And it 
explains this only if B is predicated of all A truly and necessarily: that is, 
only if A and B stand in some beeﬁ er relation than mere predication –say, 
genus and species (362.26-31). This will not be the case for all syllogisms 
in Barbara.
Why should it matter whether or not (17) has a corresponding 
Differentia and is thus a genuine maxim? Here Abelard is not as explicit 
as he might have been, but I think we can reconstruct his reasoning. He is 
trying to show that syllogisms are grounded in their construction alone, 
not in «the nature of things». Apparently, he takes the fact that syllogisms 
do not depend on any genuine maxims to be sufﬁ cient grounds for this 
claim. Thus, although he does not deny that (17) is true if and only if the 
syllogism
(18) All A are B. All B are C. Therefore, all A are C.
is valid26, he denies that this equivalence shows that our knowledge of the 
syllogism’s validity depends on how things are in the world. In order to 
25  STUMP, Dialectic and Its Place, p. 96; GREEN-PEDERSEN, The Tradition of the 
Topics, p. 197.
26 In this respect, (17) fares better than an alternative regula, (CS*): «If B is 
predicated of A universally, then if C is predicated of B universally, then C is predicated 
also of A universally» (si aliquid praedicatur de aliquo universaliter, tunc si aliud 
praedicatur de praedicato universaliter, et de subiecto, 352.31-3). (17) and (CS*) are 
not equivalent, because the law of exportation fails in Abelard’s logic. In fact, Abelard 
argues, (CS*) and the corresponding regulae for other syllogistic moods have many 
false instances (358.34-362.17).

54 
JOHN MACFARLANE
understand Abelard’s reasoning here, we need to understand why he thinks 
that only a genuine Topical maxim –one with a Differentia– can ground the 
entailment in «the nature of things».
I propose that Abelard is thinking along the following lines. A Topical 
maxim gives a rule for inference that is based on its Differentia: that is, 
on some thing (res) in the world27. The inferential force (vis inferentiae) 
which a maxim brings to an imperfect inference comes from the relation in 
which the Differentia stands to a term in the conclusion of the inference (ex 
habitudine quam habet ad terminum illatum, 256.36-7). For example, in the 
valid consequence «if it is man, it is animal», the inferential force comes 
from the relation (species) in which the Differentia (man) stands to animal. 
The Differentia, then, is the thing (res) in the nature of which the validity 
of imperfect inferences is grounded28. A regula without a Differentia, then, 
although it might still be thought to ground the validity of inferences, could 
not ground it in «the nature of things», as a maxim does.
To modern eyes, this reasoning appears to make an unwarranted 
assumption: that the totality of facts about «the nature of things» is 
exhausted by facts of the form
(19) A is F, or
(20) A stands in the relation R to B.
Given this assumption, it follows from (17)’s lack of a Differentia that (17) 
is not a fact about «the nature of things» and must therefore depend for its 
truth on something else: the construction or form of the syllogism, the way 
27 GREEN-PEDERSEN, The Tradition of the Topics, p. 167. In the consequence «if it 
is man, it is animal», the locus differentia is man; when Abelard calls the Topic «from 
species», giving the relation in which the Differentia stands to something else, he 
is saying «from where the locus comes» (unde sit locus, 264.5-34). Green-Pedersen 
conjectures, plausibly, that Abelard insists that the Differentia be a thing and not 
the relation itself because the latter approach would make the relations (e.g., genus, 
species) into «independent realit[ies]» and contradict his nominalism (p. 168).
28 Cf. 255.7-9, on the consequence «if every man is animal, every man is alive»: 
«These inferences, although they are imperfect in the construction of the antecedent, 
nonetheless most often take their necessity from the nature of things, just as with [the 
consequence] which we put down earlier from animal to alive, since the nature of 
animal, in which as a substantial form alive inheres, never allows animal itself to exist 
without life».

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY 
55
it is put together in thought and language. But if we relax the assumption 
and count as facts about «the nature of things» facts with more logical 
complexity, such as
(21) A, B, and C stand in the relation Q, or
(22) not both:{ (all A are B and all B are C) and not (all A are C) }, 
or even
(23) for all A, B, and C: A, B, and C stand in the relation Q,
then there is no longer any reason to think that (17) is not a fact about «the 
nature of things», and consequently no reason to think that syllogisms in 
Barbara do not depend on facts about the world: more general facts, to be 
sure, than most Topically grounded inferences, but no less facts about «the 
nature of things». Granted, the entailment in a categorical syllogism cannot 
depend on the real relation of one thing to another; but might it not depend 
on some more complex feature of the world?
This question would become acute for Kant –for whom «the nature of 
things» consists of just the kind of complex, generalized relational facts 
Abelard does not consider (e.g., the laws of Newtonian science)– and even 
more pressing for Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, whose new logical 
notation allowed the question to be raised in a more explicit way. But 
Abelard doesn’t answer it. He is not even in a position to ask it. In order 
to do so, he would have to reject the broadly Aristotelian assumption he 
inherits from his sources and shares with all of his contemporaries, that 
all facts about the world can be described by predicating «something of 
something» (ti kata tinos)29. Given that assumption, Abelard is right to 
deny that syllogisms depend for their validity on facts about the world.
Indeed, the same reasoning that leads Abelard to this conclusion 
should lead him to accept the inference
(24) A is east of B. B is east of C. Therefore A is east of C.
29 «According to Abelard, if a statement of the form xRy is true, then what makes 
it true is nothing but individual subjects and their monadic properties.» J. E. BROWER,

of Metaphysics, 51 (1998) 623.

JOHN MACFARLANE
as valid in virtue of its construction30. For suppose the premises were false. 
What would be the Differentia? Since the inference is not valid in virtue of 
B’s relation to something else, Abelard would reason, it must not be valid 
in virtue of «the nature of things».
This point reveals the extent to which Abelard’s arguments for the 
formality of syllogisms are unavailable to us today. Abelard would have to 
concede that (24) is valid in virtue of its construction, while
(25) A is a donkey. Therefore, A is an animal.
is valid in virtue of the nature of donkeys. No modern advocate of the 
Formality Thesis, I take it, would make a principled distinction between 
these two cases. Similarly, as we have seen, Abelard takes syllogisms in 
Barbara to be valid in virtue of their construction, while denying the same 
status to
(26) If A then B. If not B, then not A.
or
(27) A is alive. A is alive.
Again, his views about the basis for the Formality Thesis –views we do not 
share– would make a distinction of principle where we see none.
Conclusion
Unlike later medieval logicians who make a distinction between 
formal and material consequence, Abelard explains why it is important to 
distinguish between perfect and imperfect entailments. He argues that the 
dominant view, on which all inferences are grounded in topical maxims, 
cannot be sustained, and that we must recognize some inferences as not 
needing external grounding. This is the ﬁ rst argument for the Formality 
Thesis of which I am aware.
Abelard’s arguments seem to have been persuasive: the majority of 
Abelard’s twelfth-century successors distinguish between «arguments 
30 I am not aware of any passages in which Abelard discusses such inferences.

 
ABELARDʼS ARGUMENT FOR FORMALITY

which rest upon loci [Topics] (locales) and those that are valid by their 
form (complexionales)»31. The distinction persists in the thirteenth century 
and is a likely ancestor of the fourteenth-century (continental) distinction 
between formal and material consequence32. But we no longer ﬁ nd 
arguments for the Formality Thesis that would support the distinction. The 
reason, perhaps, is that there is no longer a concerted opposition. After 
Abelard, it is taken for granted that valid inferences divide into those 
whose validity can be attributed to their structure and those whose validity 
depends on their terms and the nature of the things to which they refer.
It is tempting for contemporary advocates of the Formality Thesis to 
point to fourteenth-century logicians as predecessors. But if I am right about 
the philosophical basis of the medieval distinction, they should not do so. 
We cannot accept the premises of Abelard’s argument for the Formality 
Thesis, so if we are going to accept some version of the Formality Thesis 
ourselves, it will have to be on other grounds33.

Boethius’ Logics
Boethius left twelfth century philosophers with three different logics, a 
procedure for ﬁ nding an argument to answer any given question, a puzzle, 
and a problem. The logics are those for categorical and hypothetical 
syllogisms and for his reworking of Cicero’s account of the Stoic 
indemonstrables. The procedure is given in his account of the topics and 
the puzzle is to reconcile this account with what he says in his treatments of 
categorical and hypothetical syllogisms. The problem is to ﬁ nd a place for 
certain familiar propositional inferences given that such inferences have no 
place in any of Boethius’ logics.
Boethius sets out the logic of categorical syllogisms in De Syllogismo 
Categorico1 (DSC). It corresponds to Aristotle’s exposition of non-modal 
syllogisms in Prior Analytics 1-7, supplemented with the account of the 
indirect ﬁ gures developed, according to Boethius, by Theophrastus and 
Eudemus. He deﬁ nes a syllogism in DSC as2:
[…] oratio, in qua positis quibusdam et concessis aliud quoddam, 
quam sunt ea, quae posita et concessa sunt, necessario contingit per 
ipsa, quae concessa sunt.
This is not quite the deﬁ nition given in the Prior Analytics which with 
the recovery of Boethius’ translation of the work in the ﬁ rst half of the 
twelfth century became standard in mediaeval logic. Boethius’ deﬁ nition 
adds to Aristotle’s the requirement of concession and while he himself 
probably intended nothing much by it3, the addition allowed Abaelard to

make a distinction crucial for him between arguments and conditionals. 
Unlike Aristotle, although his examples are always given in the form of 
arguments, Boethius formulates the moods of the categorical syllogism as 
conditional propositions. For example barbara4:
Si A in omni B fuerit, et B in omni C fuerit, A terminus de omni C 
praedicabitur, id est: Omne iustum bonum est. Omnis uirtus iustum 
est. Omnis igitur uirtus bonum est.
Like Aristotle Boethius employs letters to formulate the moods of the 
syllogism and replaces them uniformly with general terms in his examples. 
Unlike Aristotle he offers a justiﬁ cation for the practice, telling us that it is 
required in order to achieve generality and avoid the possibility of error5. 
In DSC Boethius’ calls these schemata for syllogisms complexiones6 and 
characterises them as having a form7 which in his commentary on Cicero’s 
Topics he explicitly contrast with their component propositions as the matter 
of syllogisms drawing an analogy in both works to the relationship between 
the structure of a building and the materials from which it is constructed8.
Categorical syllogisms in all three ﬁ gures are alike in that nothing in 
addition to their premisses is required to prove the conclusion but the moods 
of the secondary ﬁ gures are imperfect in contrast to the perfect direct moods 
of the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure, which Boethius tells are called «indemonstrables»9, 
because of the way in which their premisses are presented10:
[…] perfectus syllogismus est, cui ad integram probatamque 
conclusionem ex superius sumptis et propositis nihil deest […]; 
imperfectus syllogismus est, cui nihil aeque ad perfectionem deest, 
verumtamen in his quae in propositionibus sumpta sunt, aliqua desunt.
What is required to show that the conclusions of the secondary ﬁ gures 
follow from their premisses is provided entirely by the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure, the 
principles of conversion, and reduction to impossibility11.

The second logic left by Boethius to the middle ages is the account 
of the hypothetical syllogisms which he sets out in De Hypotheticis 
Syllogismis12 (DHS). So far no ancient parallel for most of this material has 
been discovered13 but Boethius’ remarks on it suggest that it is an attempt 
to formulate an account of the logic of the conditional and disjunction in 
Peripatetic terms14. Thus, he claims, though without giving any hint in 
DHS of how to do this, where there is any doubt as to the truth of the 
conditional premiss of a hypothetical syllogism it may be proved with a 
categorical syllogism. The various forms of hypothetical syllogism do 
not themselves, however, require anything further to guarantee that their 
conclusion follows from their premisses, though a proof by reductio and 
the afﬁ rmation of the antecedent is required to show that an argument by 
denying the consequent holds15:
Just as in his account of the categorical syllogism Boethius formulates 
hypothetical syllogisms schematically using letters for general terms since, 
as I have argued extensively elsewhere, he has no notion of a propositional 
content which might be substituted into the antecedent or consequent of a 
simple conditional to yield a more complex conditional16. Rather he limits 
himself to ﬁ ve classes of conditional, one simple, three compound, and a 
mediate form consisting of pairs of simple conditionals, distinguishing for 
each form in each class two different arguments –afﬁ rming the antecedent 
and denying the consequent– where there is a syllogism in virtue the 
structure of the propositions (complexio propositionum)17. 
Thus all the instances of the schema «Si est A, est B, est A; ergo est 
B» are valid hypothetical syllogisms as are all instances of «Si est A, non 
est B, est A, ergo non est B» but these two argument schemata are not

presented by Boethius in DHS as themselves instances of a more general 
propositional schema for afﬁ rming the antecedent. 
Boethius also claims that conditionals of the form «Si non est A, est 
B» are true only when A and B are both exclusive and exhaustive and so 
support afﬁ rming the consequent and denying the antecedent, not, however, 
in virtue of the structure of the propositions but rather, he says, in virtue of 
the terms, or the nature of things18.
[…] hic quoque […] dicendum est secundum quidem ipsius 
complexionis ﬁ guram nullum ﬁ eri syllogismum; secundum terminos 
uero in quibus solis dici potest, necesse esse, si A fuerit, B non esse.
In DHS Boethius also provides a logic for disjunction, but only simple 
disjunction, presented in exactly the same way as his logic for conditionals 
with letters standing for general terms. A given form of simple disjunction 
is, according to Boethius, equivalent to the conditional whose antecedent is 
the opposite of the ﬁ rst disjunct and whose consequent is the second. Simple 
disjunctions with both disjuncts afﬁ rmative thus support four inferences, 
two in virtue of the complexio and two in virtue of the properties of the 
terms disjoined, whereas the three other forms of disjunction support only 
the two forms of disjunctive syllogism.
Boethius provided the middle ages with a method for discovering 
arguments with his account of topical inference. In his commentary on 
Cicero’s Topica he introduces the theory which he later summarised in De 
Differentiis Topics (DT) where he follows the classiﬁ cation of the topics 
given by Themistius as well as that provided by Cicero and proposes a 
reconciliation of them. Boethius’ commentary was, it seems, little used in 
the middle ages and the puzzle which I mentioned above is discussed rather 
in connection with DT. It is, however, already clear in the commentary and 
perhaps even more puzzling as it appears there. Cicero offers in his Topics 
a recipe for answering questions by ﬁ nding an argumentum, that is to say 
a reason bringing conviction where something was in doubt, and tells us 
that a locus, or topic, is where such a reason is to be sought, it is a sedes 
argumenti. Boethius comments that every argumentum is presented in an 
argumentatio, that is to say in a syllogism or an enthymeme, and so as 
propositions. In DT he gives a more general and technical deﬁ nition19:
18 DHS 2.3.6, for «rerum natura» see II.2.4.
19 Boethius, De Differentiis Topicis (DT), PL 64, 1174C.

 
ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
63
[…] uis sententiae ratioque ea quae clauditur oratione cum aliquid 
probatur ambiguum, argumentum uocatur.
The role of the locus, he tells us in both works, is to provide a general 
principle, a so called maximal proposition, which in some way contains the 
propositions which appear in the syllogism solving the question that we are 
interested in20: 
Maximas igitur, id est uniuersales ac notissimas propositiones, ex 
quibus syllogismorum conclusio descendit.
In DT we are again given a rather more technical deﬁ nition21:
Ac sicut locus in se corporis continet quantitatem, ita hae 
propositiones quae sunt maximae, intra se omnem uim posteriorum 
atque ipsius conclusionis consequentiam tenent, et uno quidem 
modo locus, id est argumenti sedes, dicitur maxima principalisque 
propositio, ﬁ dem caeteris subministrans. 
A maximal proposition, Boethius notes, may be included in a syllogism 
or, it will turn out much more importantly, may in some way provide the 
argumentation with its strength from the outside22:
[…] aliae uero in ipsis quidem argumentationibus minime 
continentur, uim tamen argumentationibus subministrant.
Just what Boethius intends by this is not at all clear. His characterisation 
of maximal propositions and his examples suggests that an externally 
posited maximal proposition somehow provides the premisses for the 
argument. The maximal proposition «Of what the deﬁ nitions are different 
the substances are different» thus offers us a way of proving that two items 
are distinct by showing that they have different deﬁ nitions. Boethius’ 
example of an argumentum descending from this maximal proposition is23:

CHRISTOPHER JOHN MARTIN
A jealous man is one who laments the happiness of others, 
a wise man does not lament the happiness of others; 
therefore a jealous man is not wise. 
That is to say an argument which we could if we wished recast as 
an instance of camestres. The puzzle is to understand exactly what role 
Boethius supposes the maximal proposition to play in the argument given 
that he has insisted, as we have seen, that nothing is needed apart from the 
truth of the premisses to guarantee the truth of the conclusion in this or any 
other mood or form of categorical or hypothetical syllogism. 
In both ITC and DT on the other hand, Boethius gives the principles 
of afﬁ rming the antecedent (posito antecedenti comitari quod subsequitur) 
and denying the consequent (perempto consequenti perimi quod antecedit) 
as maximal propositions for the loci ab antecedenti and a consequenti 
from which are drawn the argumenta which prove the conclusion in 
instances of these argument forms. In his detailed discussion of Cicero’s 
remarks on these loci, with the locus a repugnantibus, as those which 
are most properly used by dialecticians, however, there is no mention of 
maximal propositions24. This is perhaps not surprising since the argument 
forms in question are the Stoic indemonstrables of which Cicero gives the 
extended list of seven. It is Boethius’ reworking of these which is the third 
logic he bequeathed to the middle ages. Cicero formulates the ﬁ rst three 
types of indemonstrable in terms of their general deﬁ nitions which may 
be interpreted as characterising a relation between predicates, as in the 
account given in DHS, just as easily as a relation between propositional 
contents. Boethius does indeed interpret them in this way and gives, for 
example, the conditional premiss of the ﬁ rst type of indemonstrable in the 
form «si hoc est, illud est» rather than «si hoc, illud». He goes on to add to 
the Stoic meteorological impersonal «si dies est, lux est», his own favourite 
«si homo est, animal est», the paradigmatic simple conditional of DHS.
As I have shown elsewhere, the absence of propositional negation in 
Boethius’ logic is illustrated by his rewriting of a version the third Stoic 
indemonstrable given by Cicero25. The argument which according to

ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
65
Cicero is drawn from the locus a repugnantibus has for its ﬁ rst premiss 
the negation of a copulative conjunction with ﬁ rst conjunct afﬁ rmative and 
second negative, the second premiss is the ﬁ rst conjunct, and the conclusion 
the negation of the second. Boethius rewrites the ﬁ rst premiss by replacing 
the copulative conjunction «et» with the conditional conjunction «si». In 
this rewritten form he construes both the preposed negation and that of the 
consequent as predicative. The preposed negation acts on the consequent 
negation to produce, in effect, an afﬁ rmation, and a true conditional. 
The premisses of the fourth to seventh modes of indemonstrable are 
given by Cicero with demonstrative pronouns apparently functioning 
as propositional variables but while Boethius repeats them in this form 
he shows no understanding of the propositionality of the connectives26. 
He explains that the negated copulative of modes 6 and 7 hold only of 
exclusive and exhaustive opposites, as do the disjunctions of modes 4 and 
5, but treats it as special form of connection which despite its appearance 
is not produced by applying propositional negation to a copulative 
conjunction. There is thus nothing here to contradict his rejection in his 
longer commentary on De Interpretatione of propositional negation and of 
the copulative conjunction as proposition forming27.
The Discovery of Propositionality
The logicians of the twelfth century seem to have ignored Boethius’ 
reinterpretation of the Stoic indemonstrables, and their great achievement 
in logic was to understand the connectives that appear in them, as the Stoics 
did, propositionally. This achievement brings with it, however, the problem 
of properly characterising the logic of the propositional connectives in 
propositional terms.
Propositional negation appears for the ﬁ rst time in the middle ages, as 
far as I know, in the Dialectica of Garland written at the end of the eleventh 
or beginning of the twelfth century. In this work Garland, writing in the 
millieu of Abaelard’s master Roscelin of Compiegne, presents a strenuously 
anti-realistic account of logic adding, he tells us, to the rules given by 
Boethius and Aristotle the results of his masters’ and his own research. 
26 His presentation is entirely syntactical, see ITC, 1136D-1137A.
27 See MARTIN, «The Logic of Negation in Boethius», p. 284.

66 
CHRISTOPHER JOHN MARTIN
In his account of the negation of simple and quantiﬁ ed categorical 
propositions Garland follows Boethius in maintaining that the negative particle 
is applied to the predicate to signify its separation from the subject with no 
hint that there is an alternative, propositional, account. The same is true of 
his exposition of the logic of composite conditionals where he again follows 
Boethius and gives, for instance28: «Si est homo, cum sit animatum, est animal, 
sed cum sit animatum non est animal; ergo non est homo» as an example of 
denying the consequent. In his treatment of conditionals, however, in setting 
out one of the sophisms which are the peculiarly characteristic feature of his 
work Garland argues that the conditional «Si est homo, est albus» is true since29:
Si est falsa sua negativa: non si est homo, est albus, vera est si est 
homo est albus - nam talis negatio, scilicet ubi preponitur non, 
dividit verum et falsum cum sua afﬁ rmatione.
Referring to this move a little later Garland brieﬂ y discusses the 
claim that a proposition formed by preposing the negative particle in this 
way to a conditional rather than that obtained by negating the consequent 
is properly the «negative» of the original «afﬁ rmative» conditional. He 
suggests that the issue may be resolved by construing «Si est homo, non est 
albus» as meaning «if human holds of something, it does not follow for this 
reason that it is white» and so as a conditional proposition dividing truth 
and falsity with the original conditional and equivalent to the categorical 
proposition «non: si est homo, est albus»30. He does not notice that such a 
construal invalidates instances of modus ponens with conditionals of this 
form as their hypothetical premiss. 
Garland does, however, clearly recognise negation as propositional 
operation and it appears once more in his Dialectica in a delightfully 
complicated sophism where he argues31:
Homo est asinus. Utrum? Aut non est rudibilis, aut est asinus; sed 
est rudibilis. Utrum? Aut non est non falsa ista propositio omnis 
homo est rudibilis, aut vera est ista que dicit: homo est rudibilis; 
sed ista propositio est non falsa: omnis homo est rudibilis. Utrum?

29 Garlandus, Dialectica, pp. 133-134.
30 Ibid., pp. 135-136.

ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
67
Aut non est non vera ista propositio non aut non est homo aut est 
rudibile aut est non falsa: omnis homo est rudibilis […] 
Garland follows Boethius closely in his treatment of the topics but 
locates it, as the scientia inveniendi, before his accounts of both the 
categorical and hypothetical syllogism, which together for him constitute 
the scientia iudicandi. He notes furthermore that we may say that a maximal 
propositions grounds the resolution of a question since a syllogism is proved 
with a maximal proposition32. He does not, however, mention maximal 
propositions in his treatment of categorical and hypothetical syllogism.
In other works from the beginning of the twelfth century topics are 
associated with the moods of the categorical and the various forms of the 
hypothetical syllogism. In the texts published by Yukio Iwakuma as the 
Introductiones Dialecticae artis secundum magistrum G. Paganellum and 
the Introductiones dialecticae <secundum Wilgelmum>33, which Iwakuma 
associates with Abaelard’s other master, William of Champeaux, we ﬁ nd 
for the ﬁ rst time the short list of topics which, as I have argued elsewhere, 
seems to be derived from Boethius’ account of the relative extensions of 
general terms in his Introductio ad Syllogismos Categoricos34. One of these 
twelfth century Introductiones, Secundum Wilgelmum, deﬁ nes a locus as a vis 
argumenti35 and in both there are new topics corresponding to various logical 
operations employed by Boethius in developing his account of categorical and 
hypothetical syllogisms. For example the locus a pari per contrapositionem36:
Maximam propositionem: si vera est universalis afﬁ rmativa, vera est 
sua conversa per contrapositionem. Assume: sed vera est ista omnis 
homo est animal. Quare vera est sua conversa per contrapositionem 
omne non animal est non homo.
Such principles, which are almost always in these texts called rules 
(regulae) rather than maximal propositions, are given for each of the various 
forms of conversion. In addition the locus a subiecto and a praedicato are 
cited as the sources of the rules associated with the conditionalised forms

of the moods of the categorical syllogism. Thus for barbara in the form of 
a conditional with a categorical antecedent and conditional consequent37:
Agendum est de illa quae constat ex categorica et hypothetica. In illa 
categorica probat hypotheticam. […] Probat enim illam aliquando 
ex vi praedicati, et tunc dantur hae regulae. Si aliquid praedicatur 
de alio universaliter, tunc si aliud praedicatur de praedicato 
universaliter, illud idem praedicatur de subiecto universaliter. 
We are also provided with various rules drawn from the locus ab 
antecedenti and a consequenti to prove compound conditionals, for 
example contraposition, versions of transitivity, and more complex forms 
such as «if something entails a hypothetical, then if something else follows 
from the consequent of that hypothetical, it may be substituted for it in the 
compound hypothetical»38. The examples presented in these texts like the 
sophisms in Garland’s Dialectica show a considerable logical sophistication 
and skill in manipulating complex propositions. The Introductiones do not, 
however, have anything to say about the nature of inference in general and 
for that we must turn to Peter Abaelard’s Dialectica the work in which he 
sets out the logicial novelties for which he became notorious in the ﬁ rst 
decade of the twelfth century in Paris.
Abaelard’s Logical Principles
Abaelard insists in his Dialectica and other works that the dividing 
opposite of any given proposition is formed by negating it as a whole and 
that this truth-functional opposite should be represented by preposing 
the negative particle to the proposition. He distinguishes the operation of 
propositional negation, iterable without limit, which he calls destructive 
negation, from the application of the negative particle to the predicate of 
an afﬁ rmation, forming what he calls its separative negation, to signify 
the separation of the predicate from the subject, a proposition which is a 
contrary of the original rather than its contradictory. Separative negation 
is not iterable and if their subject term is empty both an afﬁ rmation and its 
separative negation are false. Abaelard also insists, explicitly contradicting 
37 Ibid., II.5, p. 70.
38 Ibid., I.9.10, p. 108.

 
ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
69
Boethius, that the copulative conjunction «et» combines two propostions 
to form a single proposition which may be negated with destructive 
negation39.
Abaelard’s understanding of these two propositional operations 
is clear in his treatment in his Dialectica of Boethius’ catalogue of 
hypothetical syllogisms and in his acceptance of a special case of what we 
now call de Morgan’s rule. He investigates the possibility of interpreting 
the «hypothetical» components of Boethius’ compound conditionals as 
temporal propositions, true just in case both components are true40, and 
canvases various suggestions as to how the negation of such propositions 
might be represented with the negative particle applied to only the second 
component. In the end, however, he despairs of a solution41:
Quem <sc. Boetium> tamen fortasse de destructione earum, 
si attentius inspiciamus, nullo modo in quibusdam defendere 
possumus, sed emendare. 
The example given by Boethius and repeated by Garland thus becomes 
in Abaelard’s presentation of the hypothetical syllogism: «Si est homo, cum 
est animatum est animal; sed non cum est animatum est animal; ergo non 
est homo»42. Where the scope of the preposed «non» is the whole of the 
following compound temporal proposition.
In his account of hypothetical propositions Abaelard introduces 
propositional disjunctions as equivalent to the conditionals whose 
antecedents are the propositional opposites of the ﬁ rst disjunct and whose 
consequents are the second disjunct. Abaelard’s account of the conditional 
is intensional and so the same holds for disjunction with the consequence 
that a necessary condition for the truth of an Abaelardian propositional 
disjunction is that the disjuncts are exhaustive. His account of copulative 
conjunction is, on the other hand, truth-functional and so de Morgan’s 
Rule does not in general hold. It does hold, however, as Abaelard notes, 
where the conjoined propositions exhaust all possibilities for a given kind 
of subject. In particular we may argue by contraposition from the truth of

Abaelard treats Boethius’ compound conditionals as propositions in 
which the principle connective is conditional but whose components are 
temporal conjunctions because his theory of the conditional is intensional. 
Indeed it is hyper-intesional, a relevantistic theory of the sort which we 
now classify as connexive and like other relevantistic theories does not in 
general allow a conditional with a categorical antecedent and conditional 
consequent to be true. As we will see, Abaelard holds that such conditionals 
are true in certain special cases but the examples given by Boethius are not 
of this kind.
Abaelard’s theory of the conditional is found in his Dialectica in the 
treatise on the topics which unlike Garland he places after his discussion 
of the categorical syllogism but before that of the hypothetical syllogism 
since he holds that the topics are the source of one kind of true conditional 
but not of syllogisms. Abaelard and his followers the Nominales were 
notorious, indeed, in the twelfth century for solving our puzzle by rejecting 
it, maintaining that syllogisms, whether categorical or hypothetical have 
no need of support from the topics44. Abaelard’s reasons for insisting 
on this also provide him with a solution to the problem of the proper 
characterisation of propositional inferences but as we will see that this 
solution itself is somewhat problematic.

ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
71
Abaelard’s general discussion of inference and conditional propositions 
is striking in that he is at pains to distinguish between the necessity which 
must connect the premisses and conclusion of a valid argument from the 
necessity which is required to connect the antecedent and consequent of a 
true conditional. For an argument to be valid it must, Abaelard agrees, be 
necessarily truth preserving but for this all that is required is that it is not 
possible for the premisses all to be true and the conclusion false at the same 
time. For a conditional to be true on the other hand, according to Abaelard, it 
must be such that in addition to it’s not being possible for the the consequent 
to be false when antecedent is true, the sense of the antecedent must also 
contain that of the consequent45. A true conditional is thus what we would 
now characterise as an analytic truth and so if we identify logical with 
analytic truth, Abaelard’s position is that logical truth requires more than is 
required for valid inference. He argues for this distinction by invoking the 
principles of connexive logic to provide him with rejection rules to which he 
appeals to show that certain connections between the terms of propositions, 
or between whole propostions, which certainly guarantee the necessity 
required for valid argument, cannot guarantee the truth of the corresponding 
conditional. There can thus be no deduction theorem for Abaelardian logic46.
Abaelard characterises the connection which holds between the 
antecedent of a true conditional and its consequent as inferentia, which 
we may translate as «entailment». The weaker sort of necessity required 
for validity produces conditionals which are not true but which, according 
to Abaelard, nevertheless have «maximal probability»47. His project in the 
treatise on the topics in his Dialectica is to determine just which topics 
provide us with entailments. The list of candidates is drawn from that 
provided by Boethius rather than from the new short list but Abaelard adds 
to it the loci a praedicato, a subiecto, and several others including those 
which correspond to relations between whole propositions rather than 
between their terms48.
A conditional expresses an entailment according to Abaelard just in 
case the truth of the antecedent requires (exigit) that of the consequent 
45 See e.g. Abaelard, «Super Topica Glossa», Ed. by M. DAL PRA, Pietro 
Abaelardo: Scritti Logici, La Nuova Italia, Florence 1969, 2nd ed., pp. 205-330, 309.

and this is so just in case the sense of the antecedent contains that of the 
consequent. This condition may be met simply by the construction or form 
of the antecedent guaranteeing that if it is true then so is the consequent, 
in which case the entailment is, he says, perfect49. Alternatively it may be 
guaranteed to hold by a topical principle, a maximal proposition which 
provides the vis inferentiae, Abaelard’s new deﬁ nition of a locus50, the 
warrant, that is, that the character of the antecedent and consequent is such 
that if the former is true then so is the latter, in which case the entailment 
is imperfect51. 
Abaelard explains this distinction in terms of substitution52. There is 
absolutely no logical difference for him between perfect and imperfect 
entailments. They are equally necessary but their necessity is in the one 
case guaranteed by their complexio, and in the other by what we would 
probably call a conceptual, or perhaps a metaphysical, truth. Perfect 
entailments are such that they hold for all uniform substitution of general 
terms while imperfect entailments hold only for the subsitution of general 
terms or of propositions related in a particular way. Neither Abaelard, nor 
anyone else that I know of in the middle ages, characterises complexional, 
or formal truth, in terms of the uniform substitutablity of propositional 
variables. Thus, according to Abaelard53:
[…] si ita proponatur: si omne animal est animatum et omne animatum 
est animatum, omne animal est animatum perfecta quoque est 
secundum complexionem inferentia. Quod quidem inde patet quia 
ex se tantum, non ex natura terminorum, haec inferentia perfecta 
est, quod, qualescumque terminos apponas, siue cohaerentes siue 
remotos, nullo modo cassari ualet consecutio. […] Caeterae quoque 
uerae consequentiae, quarum inferentia ex rerum natura pendet, non 
in quorumlibet terminorum rebus uerae consistunt, sed in his tantum 
quae naturam eius consecutionis seruant.
True conditionals such as «si Sortes est homo, est animal» thus rely on 
fact that human is species of animal for the support of the locus a specie

53 Ibid., pp. 255-256.

 
ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH

with its maximal proposition that of whatever a species is predicated so is 
its genus. 
Despite, however, characterising perfect entailments in his introductory 
remarks as those which hold for all uniform substitution of general terms and 
repeating this claim later without suggesting that there are any exceptions 
Abaelard goes on to remark that the conditional «si <omne animal> est 
animatum, <omne animal> est animatum» is not perfect since54:
[…] quamuis certum sit idem sine se ipso non posse consistere 
non est tamen inferentia complexionis perfecta, ubi idem ad 
sui positionem simpliciter sequitur, nisi et ipsum in se contineri 
demonstretur per adiunctam antecedenti propositionem quae est: 
omne animatum est animatum.
Abaelard’s discussion the loci drawn from Boethius’ lists which he 
considers worthy of investigation as of particular concern to logicians 
produces the result that of those loci which provide general principles 
governing the relationship, or as he says habitudo, between the kinds of 
things signiﬁ ed by the subject and predicate terms of the antecedent of a 
simple conditional and those signiﬁ ed by the subject and predicate terms 
of the consequent only those which have to do solely with the nature of 
the thing in which we are interested can provide a warrant for an imperfect 
entailment. Such conditionals express, he says, a law of nature (lex naturae) 
and a natural consecution (consecutio naturalis)55. 
An imperfect entailment thus holds where the habitudes which relate 
the terms of the antecedent and consequent have to do appropriately with 
the deﬁ nition or deﬁ nitional components of a natural kind. «If Socrates 
is human being, then he is an animal» is an imperfect entailment but «If 
Socrates is a human being, then he is not an ass» is not, nor, surprisingly, 
according to Abaelard, is «If Socrates is a mortal rational animal, then he 
is a human being»56.
As I remarked above Abaelard insists that no locus is needed to 
guarantee that the conditionalisation of a categorical or hypothetical 
syllogism is true. It is, however, crucial for him that the conditionalisation 
is formulated in the appropriate way. The versions we have seen given in 
54 Ibid., p. 255.
55 Ibid., p. 280. 
56 Ibid., pp. 331-332.

74 
CHRISTOPHER JOHN MARTIN
the Introductiones are compound conditionals with categorical antecedents 
and conditional consequents but as I noted Abaelard holds that in general 
such conditionals are false. The only propositions of this form which are 
true, he insists, are those which have as their categorical antecedent a 
proposition stating that a topical relationship holds which would warrant 
the truth of the consequent in a topical proof of it. So for example «Si 
animal est genus hominis, si est homo, est animal» is true57 but all the 
conditionals given as instances of the moods of the categorical syllogism 
in the Introductiones are false58. 
As well as insisting that such conditionals are false Abaelard argues 
that the attempt by their proponents to assign them a locus fails because 
the locus needed and the maximal proposition drawn from it would have 
to warrant the whole compound conditional59. If that locus were a thing, 
its assignment would thus locate a feature of the subject and / or predicate 
of the antecedent categorical which would warrant the truth of the whole 
compound of which it is the antecedent. In general, however, Abaelard 
argues, the only loci available to do this are those a praedicato and a subiecto 
but these cannot do the job since the truth of a simple categorical, save in 
the special circumstances mentioned, cannot entail that of a conditional.
The conditional formulation of the syllogism which Abaelard does 
accept uses the copulative conjunction «et» to combine the premisses of 
the syllogism to form the antecedent of a conditional with the conclusion 
as its consequent60. He thus cannot accept the principle of exportation 
which would allow him to export one of the antecedent conjuncts to form 
an equivalent conditional with categorical antecedent and conditional 
consequent61. Since the antecedent of Abaelard’s conditionalised syllogisms 
is a compound of two propositions it does not have a single subject or 
predicate which might provide a thing as locus to guarantee the truth of 
the conditional, and indeed, as we have just seen Abaelard holds that such 
conditionals do not require the aid of a locus of any sort. 
In addressing the question of why Boethius claims that loci do support 
syllogisms and offers examples which purport to show this Abaelard 
57 Ibid., p. 282.
58 Ibid., p. 352.
59 Ibid., pp. 354-364.
60 Ibid., pp. 253-254.
61 Ibid., p. 359.

 
ABAELARD ON LOGICAL TRUTH 
75
suggests that what he had in mind was perhaps that the loci concerned 
warrant an enthymematic inference which could then used to support the 
claim that a given syllogism is valid. To justify this suggestion he introduces 
a crucial principle for his logic in both its general and particular form62:
Nam ubi simplex ualet inferentia, qui<s> non magis compositam 
recipiat? Potest quoque ex simplici necessario probari composita. 
Si enim uerum est: si omnis homo est animal, omnis homo est 
animatus et ueram necesse est esse syllogismi inferentiam, hanc 
scilicet: si omnis homo est animal et omne animal est animatum, 
omnis homo est animatus Quicquid enim sequitur ad consequens, 
et ad antecedens. Duae uero illae simul propositiones ad quamlibet 
ipsarum antecedunt.
Here we have, stated for the ﬁ rst time, I think, in European logic both 
the general principle of strengthening the antecedent, or monotonicity, and 
the particular case of conditionalised simpliﬁ cation, as well as an appeal 
to transitivity. Abaelard does not indicate what status these principles have 
but we must assume that he regards them as logical truths. Just what kind 
of logical truths, however, is not immediately obvious.
As I noted above, Abaelard holds that in addition to the loci which 
are res, and the habitudes which they support, there are also loci and 
maximal propositions which warrant entailments holding between whole 
propositions. The locus ab antecedenti and a consequenti, Abaelard insists, 
must indeed be understood in this way if we are to be able to understand the 
logic of conditional proposition. The locus ab antecedenti is, however, he 
notes, entirely empty, since someone who does not accept that «p entails q» 
will not be convinced by its being pointed out to him that «p» is antecedent 
to «q» and an appeal to the maximal proposition that where the antecedent 
is posited so is the consequent63. Also drawn from the loci ab antecedenti 
and a consequenti, however, are the principles of contraposition and 
versions of transitivity64. 
In addition to these Abaelard holds that equivalence of propositions is 
a topical relationship65:
62 Ibid., pp. 260-261.
63 Ibid., p. 365.
64 Ibid., pp. 364-369.
65 Ibid., p. 270.

76 
CHRISTOPHER JOHN MARTIN
Secundum autem totas antecedentes propositiones locus consistit 
cum dicitur: si omnis homo est animal, omne non-animal est non-
homo; si nullus homo est lapis, nullus lapis est homo; si (quia 
Socrates est homo Socrates est animal), et (quia non est animal, 
non est homo). Tota enim praecedens propositio toti consequenti, 
secundum hoc quod ei aequipollet, comparatur.
Note that like repetition all of these conditionals hold for all subsitutions 
of terms and Abaelard could certainly associate repetition with the locus a 
pari if he wished to do so. Unfortunately he does not say any more about 
the conversion of quantiﬁ ed categorical propositions or indeed provide 
any reason for characterising syllogisms as perfect and complexional 
while conversion is imperfect and local. The reason is perhaps that as far 
is logic is concerned it does not matter. The logical status of an imperfect 
entailment is precisely the same as that of a perfect entailment. Both are 
necessary in precisely the same way. 
Nowhere, as far as I know, does Abaelard classify the principles of 
conditional simpliﬁ cation. Given what he says about repetition and his 
remarks on propositional loci, it is hard, however, to suppose that he 
would not classify it too as imperfect and local even though holds for all 
substitution of terms. But again it doesn’t really matter since he clearly 
supposes that it is logically true in just the same way as «si est homo, 
est animal’ is logically true as are all instances of contraposition and 
transitivity. Because he thinks this, however, he has left himself with no 
room for escape from the arguments which would be directed at his logic 
during his last decade in Paris66.

LE CARACTÈRE FORMEL DE LA LOGIQUE EN TANT QU’ARS
De nos jours, il y a souvent des résistances à qualiﬁ er toute la logique 
de formelle. Jonathan Barnes, dans Truth etc.1, relève que l’une des raisons 
de ces résistances réside dans la confusion des termes ‘symbolique’ 
et ‘formelle’ utilisés pour décrire les systèmes de logique développés à 
partir du XXe siècle. Je crois qu’il s’agit d’une confusion terminologique 
commune, non seulement chez les non-logiciens, mais aussi chez certains 
logiciens, comme on peut d’ailleurs le constater en lisant la plupart des 
manuels d’introduction aux systèmes de logique symbolique. 
Il est possible de voir une conséquence, parmi d’autres, de l’attitude qui 
consiste à identiﬁ er logique formelle et symbolique dans le choix, répandu 
depuis quelques années, d’attribuer l’appellation de logique informelle à 
l’analyse de l’argumentation, dans l’idée que «les encadrements théoriques 
de la logique axiomatique»2 ne sont pas adéquats pour servir de « fondement 
à une analyse de la pratique argu mentative »3. Ceci, à mon avis, a généré 
davantage de malentendus terminologiques, et comporte le risque de 
conduire à des contradictions ; car il est évident que, si « l’analyse des 
sophismes »4 appartient au champ recherche de la logique informelle, avec 
pour but la détection d’erreurs dans des cas concrets d’argumentation, il 
faut nécessairement faire référence à une certaine forme (qui peut toutefois 
être appelée ‘structure’, ‘modèle’), choisie comme critère de distinction 
entre un bon et un mauvais argument. 
Aucune analyse qui se dit logique ne peut faire abstraction de son 
caractère formel, c’est-à-dire d’un caractère universel et organisé selon 
un certain ordre donné à une certaine matière. Nous pouvons dire, donc, 
une fois distingué entre ‘formel’ – qui spéciﬁ e que la logique s’occupe

des formes d’inférence – et ‘symbolique’ – qui spéciﬁ e qu’à l’intérieur 
de l’étude des formes d’inférence, il est fait recours à des symboles dotés 
d’une et d’une seule signiﬁ cation, aﬁ n d’éviter les ambiguïtés des langages 
naturels –, que toute la logique, de l’Antiquité à nos jours, est formelle.
On qualiﬁ e donc de formelle la logique d’Aristote ainsi que celle de 
Thomas d’Aquin, alors qu’elles ne sont pas construites sur la base d’un 
langage symbolique, mais sur des langages naturels, d’une part le grec, 
de l’autre le latin. Je ne rentre pas dans la question épineuse de savoir 
si toute inférence valide l’est en vertu d’une forme logique ; j’aimerais 
rester à un niveau à la fois plus général et plus fondamental : d’où vient 
ce caractère formel de la logique ? Et est-ce que cela implique qu’il existe 
une logique formelle universelle? La réponse négative à cette deuxième 
question ressortira au fur et à mesure de l’argumentation proposée en 
soutien à la réponse à la première question, qui, d’ailleurs, ﬁ gure dans le 
titre de cet exposé. 
Mon propos est de montrer, par le biais de références à quelques 
Commentaires de saint Thomas aux ouvrages d’Aristote, que ce caractère 
formel de la logique provient de sa constitution en tant qu’ars – là où 
‘ars’ est la traduction latine du mot grec ‘techne’, qui possède les traits 
d’universalité et d’ordre. Le texte de référence pour le sens du mot ‘techne’ 
est le premier chapitre du Livre A de la Métaphysique d’Aristote; pour le 
lien explicite entre forme et techne, je signale le passage du livre Λ du même 
traité5, où Aristote précise que, normalement, ce qui est déterminé par une 
forme ne peut subsister en dehors de la substance composée, « comme par 
exemple la forme de la maison, à moins que par forme on entende techne ». 
Le philosophe grec insiste même dans la Rhétorique sur le fait que toute 
techne a affaire à l’universel et non au particulier6 : « aucune techne ne se 
borne au particulier : ainsi, la médecine ne cherche point ce qui est propre 
à la santé de Socrate ou de Callias, mais ce qui convient à tel ou tel en 
général, et à telle ou telle maladie7. Car c’est là ce qui constitue la techne, 
attendu que le nombre des matières particulières est inﬁ ni, il est impossible 
5 Aristote, Met Λ 3, 1070a13-15. Saint Thomas connaît et commente ce texte en 
in Arist Met Λ, l. 3 n. 7-8 (In duodecim libros Metaphysicorum Aristotelis expositio, 
éd. M. R. CATHALA – R. M. SPIAZZI, Marietti, Torino – Roma 1971, 2ª ed).
6 Aristote, Rhet I 2, 1356b30-35.
7 On remarque une différence entre ce texte et celui de la Métaphysique en ce qui 
concerne l’exemple de la techne médicale : ici, Aristote, voulant souligner le caractère 
universel de n’importe quelle techne et donc aussi de la rhétorique, considérée 
relativement aux cas particuliers, ne fait aucune référence au but du technikos médecin

de les renfermer dans les limites d’une science. De même, la rhétorique 
ne s’arrête point à ce qui est probable pour un particulier, pour Socrate ou 
pour Hippias, par exemple. Elle ne s’occupe que de ce qui paraît tel à tous 
les hommes en général, et par là elle ressemble encore à la dialectique ». 
Le texte central pour ma recherche sera le Prologue du Commentaire de 
Thomas d’Aquin aux Seconds Analytiques d’Aristote8, car nous y trouvons 
une introduction à ce qu’est la logique, qui la caractérise justement comme 
ars. Les premières lignes de ce Prologue vont nous offrir du matériel 
utile pour tirer au clair dès le début ce que veut dire ars; à son tour, le 
début du Commentaire à l’Ethique à Nicomaque9 nous aidera à préciser 
sa nature de «certa ordinatio rationis». Nous pourrons de la sorte revenir 
au commentaire aux Seconds Analytiques, aﬁ n de déﬁ nir la nature de la 
logique en tant qu’«ars artium», et son caractère formel. 
1. Ars : certa ordinatio rationis
Thomas d’Aquin ouvre son commentaire aux Seconds Analytiques 
par les mots suivants : « Sicut dicit Aristoteles in principio Metaphysicae, 
hominum genus arte et rationibus vivit ».
Le renvoi explicite au début de la Métaphysique rend clair le fait que 
la notion d’ars évoquée ici correspond à celle de techne décrite par Aristote 
au sein du processus de connaissance comme le passage de l’individuel 
de se servir des règles générales ainsi établies pour les appliquer au cas particulier ; ce 
qui est explicite dans la Métaphysique (Met A 1, 981a18-20) quand est exprimée une 
objection possible à l’efﬁ cacité de la techne par rapport à l’expérience : « Car ce n’est 
pas l’homme que guérit le médecin, sinon accidentellement, mais Callias ou Socrate, 
ou quelque autre individu qui se trouve appartenir au genre humain ». Il considère 
important de le rendre explicite aﬁ n de ne pas donner l’impression d’être intéressé à 
l’universel en lui-même, comme son maître. On peut ainsi dire que la techne est pensée 
pour l’universel, mais que le technikos qui l’apprend doit exercer sa phronesis aﬁ n 
d’appliquer la techne aux cas singuliers.

à l’universel saisi par de multiples expériences du même type10. Nous 
relevons donc d’emblée le trait d’universalité qui doit caractériser la 
logique; le trait relatif à l’ordre est quant à lui présent dans la formulation de 
la déﬁ nition d’ars que saint Thomas propose dans son Prologue, à savoir : 
« nihil enim aliud ars esse videtur, quam certa ordinatio rationis, quomodo 
per determinata media ad debitum ﬁ nem actus humani perveniatur ». 
En fait, cette déﬁ nition ne dérive pas de la Métaphysique : Aristote 
n’y donne pas de déﬁ nition de techne, mais se concentre sur son origine 
(γίγνεται), c’est-à-dire sur l’expérience, et sur le processus par lequel il 
est possible d’atteindre une telle connaissance universelle. Saint Thomas, 
pour sa part, conformément aux canons rhétoriques et pédagogiques d’une 
introduction, cherche à susciter la docilitas en celui qui écoute11 : il offre par 
conséquent une description-déﬁ nition d’ars qui semble avoir des liens avec 
la déﬁ nition de techne comme systema que plusieurs témoins, tels Philon 
d’Alexandrie, Galien et Sextus Empiricus, mais aussi l’un des scholiastes 
byzantins du grammairien Denys le Thrace, font remonter aux Stoïciens. 
Comme exemple, on peut prendre la double formulation du pseudo-
Galien : « la techne est un système – une mise ensemble (σύστημα) – de 
compréhensions exercées ensemble (συγγεγυμνασμένων) vers un but 
utile parmi ceux qui se trouvent dans la vie ; ou bien ainsi : la techne 
est un système – une mise ensemble (σύστημα) – exercé ensemble 
(συγγεγυμνασμένον) de compréhensions qui ont une relation vers un 
unique but»12. Le rapport entre l’occurrence du mot latin ordinatio dans la 
déﬁ nition de saint Thomas et celle du mot grec ‘σύστημα’ dans le passage 
de Galien est intensiﬁ é par la présence du participe ‘συγγεγυμνασμένον’ ; 
car qu’il se réfère aux compréhensions – comme dans la première 
version – ou directement au σύστημα, puisqu’il contient la préposition 
‘syn’ – ‘avec’ – comme le mot ‘σύστημα’ lui-même, cela met l’accent sur 
l’idée d’ensemble de parties organisées, fruit d’un exercice (grâce au verbe 
‘γυμνάζομαι’) et, pourrait-on dire, d’une régularité. 
 Il est d’ailleurs possible non seulement de rapprocher le mot latin 
‘ordinatio’ du mot grec ‘σύστημα’, mais aussi de reconnaître dans certaines

11 Thomas d’Aquin, in Arist De Anima.
12 Pseudo-Galien, Deﬁ nitiones medicae 7 (Vol. XIX K p. 350): « τέχνη ἐστὶ

τῷ βίῳ. ἢ οὕτως· τέχνη ἐστὶ σύστημα ἐκ καταλήψεων συγγεγυμνασμένον ἐφ’ ἓν 
τέλος τὴν ἀναφορὰν ἐχόντων ».

formulations une même référence à une certaine ﬁ n («πρός τι τέλος»), 
vers laquelle l’organisation est orientée. Le philosophe péripatéticien 
Aspasius, au début de son commentaire à l’Ethique à Nicomaque13, fait 
des remarques intéressantes à propos du mot ‘techne’, en relevant sa 
plurivocité (« λέγεται δὲ τέχνη παρ’ αὐτοῖς τριχῶς », « ‘techne’ est dite 
par eux de trois manières » ) ; ce qui explique que le mot ‘techne’ est 
employé dans un sens générique (« ‘techne’ est dite le genre de toutes les 
technai »14, c’est-à-dire des technai théorétiques, pratiques et poïétiques) 
au commencement de l’Ethique à Nicomaque, alors que dans le livre VI 
de ce même traité il est employé stricto sensu (« ἰδίως ») pour décrire 
uniquement ce qui a trait à la production. Par rapport au sens générique 
du terme, Aspasius admet que « quelqu’un pourrait déﬁ nir ce que l’on 
appelle techne comme un ensemble organisé de pensées qui amènent 
à un seul but » (« ὁρίσαιτο δ’ ἄν τις τὴν οὕτω λεγομένην τέχνην 
σύστημα ἐκ θεωρημάτων εἰς ἓν τέλος φερόντων »). Il est évident 
qu’avec ce «quelqu’un» il veut indiquer les Stoïciens, même s’il change 
l’expression typiquement stoïcienne ‘ἐκ καταλήψεων ’ en quelque chose 
de plus péripatéticien comme ‘ἐκ θεωρημάτων’. Le mot ‘σύστημα’ est 
toutefois encore là, avec sa valeur de rassemblement organisé, auquel a 
été explicitement donné une orientation vers un but unique. En retournant 
au texte de saint Thomas, on remarque quelque chose de semblable. 
J’avais déjà suggéré la possibilité d’un rapprochement entre ‘σύστημα’ et 
‘ordinatio’, terme utilisé par saint Thomas dans sa déﬁ nition à l’intérieur 
de l’expression ‘certa ordinatio rationis’ ; mais si l’on passe de son in Arist 
APo à in Arist EN, on a conﬁ rmation du lien entre ces deux formulations 
prises dans leur totalité. Souvenons-nous que celle de saint Thomas se 
poursuit de la manière suivante : « quomodo per determinata media ad 
debitum ﬁ nem actus humani perveniatur ».  
« Sicut Philosophus dicit in principio Metaphysicae sapientis est 
ordinare » : ainsi le Docteur Angélique ouvre-t-il son commentaire, en 
expliquant ces mots par le fait qu’il est propre au sage d’ordonner15 et en

l’ordre, en particulier de connaître l’ordre qui subsiste entre les choses, alors 
que les facultés sensibles n’ont que la capacité de connaître quelque chose 
« absolute », c’est-à-dire chaque chose de manière séparée, et non dans son 
lien avec les autres choses. Avant de considérer les différentes manières 
dont la raison entre en relation avec l’ordre, saint Thomas distingue deux 
types d’ordre qui peuvent être relevés dans les choses : l’un est celui des 
parties par rapport au tout, l’autre est celui des choses par rapport à un 
but ; or c’est ce dernier qui est jugé le plus important (« principalior »), à 
savoir celui des choses par rapport à un but (« ordo rerum in ﬁ nem »). Nous 
trouvons donc dans ces lignes d’ouverture d’in Arist EN la raison pour 
laquelle dans le Prologue d’in Arist APo saint Thomas a tenu à préciser la 
nature ﬁ nale de cette certa ordinatio que l’ars dénote16. Mais dans la suite 
d’in Arist EN, il nous aide aussi à comprendre pourquoi dans in Arist APost 
il a voulu indiquer qu’il s’agit d’une « certa ordinatio rationis », sous-
entendant ‘humanae’17 ; ici, il me semble, nous avons une contribution 
importante et originale de la part du Docteur Angélique. « Ordo autem 
– distingue saint Thomas – quadrupliciter ad rationem comparatur » ; 
toutefois, avec la première distinction il met au clair que la raison n’est 
pas responsable de n’importe quel type d’ordre ; par exemple, l’ordre des 
choses naturelles (ordo rerum naturalium) est quelque chose que « ratio 
non facit, sed solum considerat ». De cette manière il ﬁ xe des limites 
au pouvoir de la raison humaine, tout en lui reconnaissant une plasticité 
particulière, qu’il manifeste à travers les trois distinctions suivantes : 
« alius autem est ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu, […]. 
Tertius autem est ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in operationibus 
voluntatis. Quartus autem est ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in 
exterioribus rebus, quarum ipsa est causa, […] »18. La capacité de la raison 
humaine à connaître un ordre dont elle n’est pas responsable, lorsqu’elle 
16 Cf. Summa Theologiae I, q. 103, a. 2 ad 2:  « Ad secundum dicendum quod 
philosophus loquitur de ﬁ nibus artium, quarum quaedam habent pro ﬁ nibus operationes 
ipsas, sicut citharistae ﬁ nis est citharizare; quaedam vero habent pro ﬁ ne quoddam 
operatum, sicut aediﬁ catoris ﬁ nis non est aediﬁ care, sed domus. Contingit autem 
aliquid extrinsecum esse ﬁ nem non solum sicut operatum, sed etiam sicut possessum 
seu habitum, vel etiam sicut repraesentatum, sicut si dicamus quod Hercules est ﬁ nis 
imaginis, quae ﬁ t ad eum repraesentandum ».
17 Il y a dans d’autres textes l’expression ‘divina ordinatio’.

actes de la main (manus actus).

devient active, « considerando », devient aussi productive (‘facit’) d’un 
ordre qui peut concerner soit ses propres actes, c’est-à-dire le domaine 
logique, sur lequel nous allons nous arrêter dans le prochain paragraphe, 
soit les opérations de la volonté, c’est-à-dire le domaine de l’agir, de la 
praxis, soit enﬁ n ses opérations productives, c’est-à-dire le domaine de la 
poiesis. Ne s’agit-il pas là du développement de l’idée de techne présentée 
par Aristote au début de Métaphysique A1 et éclaircie par Aspasius dans 
le texte cité ? Ce passage de « non facit, sed solum considerat » au triple 
« considerando, facit » ne veut-il pas exprimer l’idée d’Aristote selon 
laquelle « la techne apparaît (γίγνεται) lorsque d’une multitude de notions 
issues de l’expérience se dégage un seul jugement universel applicable 
à tous les cas semblables »19 ? Après tout, Aristote voulait souligner que 
le processus de connaissance de l’homme ne peut atteindre un certain 
degré d’abstraction qu’après avoir reconnu un certain type de relation de 
ressemblance entre les choses, qui avaient été distinguées par la vue. La 
limite ou l’enracinement au niveau du réalisme que saint Thomas veut ﬁ xer 
avec le « non facit, sed solum considerat », laisse tout de même à la raison 
la liberté de s’exprimer avec une grande plasticité pour donner sa propre 
organisation aux connaissances qui dérivent de ses propres actes, ou bien 
des actes de sa volonté, ou encore de sa capacité productive, de manière 
à produire différentes sciences ou artes20, à savoir celles de la logique 
(autrement dite rationalis philosophia), de la moralis philosophia ou des 
artes mechanicae21. 
19 Aristote, Met Α 1, 981a5-7, traduction TRICOT modiﬁ ée, dans Aristote, 
Métaphysique, tome 1, livres A-Z, traduction et notes par J. TRICOT, Vrin, Paris 2000.
20 C’est saint Thomas lui-même qui utilise le mot ‘scientia’ au lieu d’ars : « Et 
quia consideratio rationis per habitum scientiae perﬁ citur, secundum hos diversos 
ordines quos proprie ratio considerat sunt diversae scientiae ». Aristote, toujours dans 
la Métaphysique A 1, souligne d’ailleurs explicitement qu’au niveau du processus de 
connaissance, à cause de leur caractère universel, il n’y pas de distinction entre techne 
et episteme. Leur différence est par contre relevée dans le livre VI de l’Ethique à 
Nicomaque et concerne la nature de leurs objets, contingente pour l’une, nécessaire 
pour l’autre. 
21 Il faut préciser que saint Thomas mentionne aussi les sciences qui dérivent du 
premier type d’ordre, celui que la raison « non facit, sed considerat » : il s’agit des 
sciences théorétiques. Cela soulève une question quant à une sorte de chevauchement 
de différents ordres : même si l’objet de connaissance a en lui-même un ordre qui n’est 
pas le résultat de la raison, la constitution d’une connaissance en science demande le 
rôle actif (facit) de la raison elle-même. Peut-être que c’est pour cela que la logique est 

84 
GIULIA LOMBARDI
Revenons donc à notre texte d’in Arist APost, notamment à la première 
partie de la formule déﬁ nitoire « certa ordinatio rationis », pour arriver 
enﬁ n à préciser la nature d’ars de la logique. Parmi les trois mots, prenons 
d’abord ‘ordinatio’ et remarquons la différence avec le mot ‘ordo’ utilisé 
en in Arist EN : une explication possible peut être trouvée à partir de la 
présence du sufﬁ xe ‘-tio’ qui en général donne aux substantifs de dérivation 
verbale la référence à une action dans son résultat22 ; ainsi, l’ordinatio est la 
structure ordonnée qui ressort d’un certain type d’ordre. En outre, d’après 
saint Thomas23, l’ordinatio est l’ordo pris abstracte (en opposition avec 
concretive); or ceci rappelle la manière dont Aristote fonde la techne ; ainsi 
donc, si l’on associe abstracte à universaliter ou formaliter, on pourra trouver 
conﬁ rmation du caractère universel, voire formel, de n’importe quelle ars. 
Passons au mot ‘rationis’. Grâce à la distinction en types d’ordre 
avec lesquels la raison est en relation, il est maintenant clair que l’ajout 
de « rationis », qui n’a pas de correspondant dans la formule grecque, sert 
à limiter la classe des résultats d’un ordre à ces trois types que la raison 
«considerando facit» (parmi lesquels il y a l’ordre d’où provient la logique), 
parce que la totalité de la formule déﬁ nitoire explique (« enim ») ce qui 
précède, à savoir « ad actus humanos faciliter et ordinate perﬁ ciendos 
diversae artes deserviunt ». La diversité des actes humains ainsi que la 
diversité correspondante des artes24, c’est justement ce que nous venons 
placée par saint Thomas – à la suite de Boèce – à l’intérieur des sciences théorétiques, 
avec une fonction précise, à savoir « adminiculum quoddam ad alias scientias […] 
prout ministrat speculationi sua instrumenta, scilicet syllogismos et difﬁ nitiones et alia 
huiusmodi, quibus in scientiis speculativis indigemus » (Super De Trinitate, pars 3, 
q. 5, a. 1 ad 2) et « ipsa docet modum procedendi in omnibus scientiis » (Super De 
Trinitate, pars 3, q. 6, a. 1 ad 13).
22 Cet élément renforcerait d’ailleurs le parallèle avec le mot grec systema, 
puisque ce dernier contient lui-même un sufﬁ xe, -ma, qui porte aussi la valeur de 
résultat d’une action, en l’occurrence de la mise ensemble ; voir, par exemple, pragma, 
comme résultat d’une praxis, d’une action.
23 Voir, par exemple, Thomas d’Aquin, II Sent., d. 9, q. 1, a. 1 ad 2 : « Ordo potest 
sumi dupliciter : vel secundum quod nominat unum gradu tantum, sicut qui sunt unius 
gradus, dicuntur unius ordinis ; et sic ordo est pars hierarchiae ; vel secundum quod 
nominat relationem quae est inter diversos gradus, ut ordo dicatur ipsa ordinatio ; et 
sic sumitur quasi abstracte, et sic ponitur in deﬁ nitione hierarchiae ; primo autem modo 
sumitur concretive, ut concretive, ut dicatur ordo unus gradus ordinatus ».
24 A propos de la pluralité des artes, voire technai, que l’être humain, à la 
différence des autres animaux, est capable d’apprendre et d’exercer, voir Galien,

85
de relever dans le passage d’in Arist EN. Je voudrais faire aussi quelques 
remarques à propos des adverbes ‘faciliter’ et ‘ordinate’, qui se répètent 
deux fois dans la suite du texte, aﬁ n de souligner le type de contribution que 
toute ars peut apporter à l’accomplissement de n’importe quel acte humain. 
Nous avons sufﬁ samment vu ce qu’il en est d’ordinate : c’est justement 
parce que l’ars « n’est rien d’autre que certa ordinatio rationis » qu’elle 
contribue à accomplir ordinate certains actes humains ; l’adverbe faciliter 
évoque l’idée d’un habitus, étant donné que l’ars, voire la techne, a déjà 
été considérée par Aristote comme l’une des vertus intellectuelles. Il s’agit 
d’une facilité acquise, après l’exercice répété d’actes qui présupposent 
un effort, et donc une certaine difﬁ culté, comme saint Thomas le relève 
dans les termes suivants25 : « ex consuetudine efﬁ citur aliquid facile et 
delectabile quod prius erat difﬁ cile : et hoc est signum habitus generati, 
scilicet delectatio operis ». Rappelons que la facilité recherchée ne l’est 
pas pour elle-même, mais justement pour concentrer davantage les efforts 
sur le but qu’on veut atteindre. 
Il nous reste encore à analyser l’adjectif ʻcertaʼ ; il y a en premier 
lieu la question de la qualiﬁ cation qu’il est censé donner. La concordance 
faite dans l’apparat critique de la première édition de la Léonine avec un 
passage de la Summa Theologiae26, où saint Thomas déﬁ nit la lex comme 
Adhortatio ad artes addiscendas 1, 1-9 (Galien, tome II, Exhortation à l’étude de la 
médecine. Art médical, texte établi et traduit par V. BOUDON, Les Belles Lettres, Paris 
2002). J’ai consacré quelques notes à ce sujet dans « Logos e techne. Claudio Galeno e 
Clemente Alessandrino, sulle basi formative necessarie alla perfezione dell’uomo » in 
F. CARDERI – M. MANTOVANI – G. PERILLO (a cura di), Momenti del logos. Ricerche del 
“Progetto LERS” (logos, episteme, ratio, scientia) in memoria di Marilena Amerise e 
Marco Arosio, Edizioni Nuova Cultura, Roma 2012, pp. 123-158.
25 Voir, par exemple, le passage suivant, Thomas, in III Sent., d. 33, q. 1, a. 2 ad 
2 : « ex consuetudine efﬁ citur aliquid facile et delectabile quod pius erat difﬁ cile : et 
hoc est signum habitus generati, scilicet delectatio operis » (« par l’habitude une action 
qui était difﬁ cile à réaliser devient facile et délectable, le signe de l’acquisition d’un 
habitus étant en effet le plaisir à accomplir l’activité», trad. dans J.-B. ÉCHIVARD, Une 
introduction à la philosophie. Les proèmes des lectures de saint Thomas d’Aquin aux 
œuvres principales d’Aristote, vol. 2, Science rationnelle et philosophie de la nature,

26 Thomas d’Aquin, Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 90, a. 4 co: « Unde promulgatio

potest colligi deﬁ nitio legis, quae nihil est aliud quam quaedam rationis ordinatio ad 
bonum commune, ab eo qui curam communitatis habet, promulgata ». Je voudrais 
aussi signaler  Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 88, a. 5 co :  « Et ideo ipsa ordinatio actuum 

86 
GIULIA LOMBARDI
« quaedam ordinatio… » pourrait nous amener à prendre ‘certa’, ici, 
comme un synonyme du ‘quaedam’ que l’on trouve dans la Summa : de 
cette manière, l’idée que l’ars serait alors «une certaine mise en ordre» 
laisserait ouvert le choix entre une variété d’ordinationes rationis, et 
notamment, d’après in Arist EN, les trois types que nous avons abordés, 
à savoir « est ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu », « est 
ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in operationibus voluntatis», «est 
ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in exterioribus rebus, quarum ipsa 
est causa, […] ». Toutefois, si l’idée d’un sens de ‘certa’ comparable à 
l’adjectif indéﬁ ni ‘quaedam’ est très séduisante, elle ne correspond pas 
à l’usage que saint Thomas en fait normalement, qui est plutôt celui de 
qualiﬁ er quelque chose comme étant certain, sûr, déterminé, clair. Mais 
qu’est-ce que cela veut dire ? Que l’ars est une mise en ordre précise en 
ce sens qu’il n’y en a qu’un type ? Cela risque de n’être pas cohérent avec 
l’idée de saint Thomas que l’être humain est capable d’acquérir une variété 
d’artes, et que cette variété, comme nous venons de le voir, est basée sur 
la variété d’ordres que la raison est capable de donner à différents actes 
humains. Il y a cependant aussi la possibilité que ce ‘certa’ ne serve pas à 
préciser en quantité l’ordinatio, mais à en déﬁ nir le caractère bien établi 
à partir d’une distinction bien établie des règles27. L’adjectif est utilisé 
avec ce sens-ci dans d’autres textes de saint Thomas28 pour marquer la 
cuiuscumque virtutis in servitium Dei est proprius actus latriae. Manifestum est 
autem ex praedictis quod votum est quaedam promiss/io Deo facta, et quod promissio 
nihil est aliud quam ordinatio quaedam eius quod promittitur in eum cui promittitur. 
Unde votum est ordinatio quaedam eorum quae quis vovet in divinum cultum seu 
obsequium ».
27 Voir, par exemple, Thomas d’Aquin, Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 104, a. 4 co: 
« Respondeo dicendum quod, cum lex sit quasi quaedam ars humanae vitae instituendae 
vel ordinandae, sicut in unaquaque arte est certa distinctio regularum artis, ita oportet 
in qualibet lege esse certam distinctionem praeceptorum, aliter enim ipsa confusio 
utilitatem legis auferret. Et ideo dicendum est quod praecepta iudicialia veteris 
legis, per quae homines ad invicem ordinabantur, distinctionem habent secundum 
distinctionem ordinationis humanae ».
28 Thomas d’Aquin, Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 49, a. 5 ad 2 : « Particularia 
autem operabilia, in quibus prudentia dirigit, recedunt praecipue ab intelligibilium 
conditione, et tanto magis quanto minus sunt certa seu determinata. Ea enim quae 
sunt artis, licet sint singularia, tamen sunt magis determinata et certa, unde in pluribus 
eorum non est consilium, propter certitudinem, ut dicitur in III Ethic. Et ideo quamvis 
in quibusdam aliis virtutibus intellectualibus sit certior ratio quam prudentia, tamen 

 
LE CARACTÈRE FORMEL DE LA LOGIQUE EN TANT QUʼARS 
87
différence entre l’ars, qui porte sur l’universel, et la prudentia, qui porte 
sur le particulier : toutes les deux correspondent à une mise en ordre, mais 
dans un cas, puisque les choses-mêmes sont « determinata et certa », 
elle aussi est « certa » ; alors que dans l’autre, les choses étant « varia et 
incerta », la mise en ordre ne peut pas trouver en elle-même une régularité ; 
c’est pour cela que l’homme « bene ratiocinativus » est capable de mettre 
en lien l’ars acquise et la prudentia, de manière à appliquer les principes 
universaux aux cas particuliers.
Ces remarques à propos de la déﬁ nition d’ars et de ces deux adverbes, 
faciliter et ordinate, doivent nous permettre de montrer comment tout ce 
discours préalable servait à saint Thomas pour caractériser la logique.
1. La logique, ars artium
Saint Thomas ouvre son Prologue d’in Arist APo avec une référence à 
l’ars et à sa valeur pour l’identité de l’homme par rapport aux autres 
animaux, dont il se sert pour proposer une introduction à la logique ;29 la 
raison, qui a un rôle de direction dans n’importe quelle ars, est capable de 
donner un ordre à ses propres actes, ce dont résulte l’ars logique. Car la 
raison, dans sa partie intellective (intellectiva pars), est en mesure de 
réﬂ échir sur elle-même : « et haec ars est logica, id est rationalis scientia » 
– dira saint Thomas à la ﬁ n du raisonnement – « quae non solum rationalis 
est ex hoc, quod est secundum rationem, quod est omnibus artibus commune, 
sed ex hoc, quod est circa ipsum actum rationis sicut circa propriam 
materiam ». L’explication de l’appellation «rationalis», qui, effectivement, 
semble de prime abord redondante, est intéressante, car le caractère rationnel 
de la logique est déjà mis au clair par le fait même qu’elle est une ars et, par 
conséquent, une « certa ordinatio rationis ». Mais la logique a quelque 
chose de différent des autres artes : la raison n’y est pas seulement engagée 
dans le rôle ordinateur – d’où provient ordinatio rationis – mais aussi, en 
ses actes, dans le rôle de matière qui doit être ordonnée, ce qui explique 
ad prudentiam maxime requiritur quod sit homo bene ratiocinativus, ut possit bene 
applicare universalia principia ad particularia, quae sunt varia et incerta ».
29 Il vaut la peine de rappeler que les commentateurs néoplatoniciens fournissaient 
une introduction à la logique d’Aristote avant de commenter les Catégories, voir par 
exemple l’Isagoge de Porphyre.

88 
GIULIA LOMBARDI
justement l’appellation « rationalis scientia »30. Mais revenons en arrière, 
pour suivre de près l’argument qui amène à reconnaître la logique comme 
ars de la raison : « Si igitur ex hoc, quod ratio de actu manus ratiocinatur 
adiventa est ars aediﬁ cativa vel fabrilis, per quas homo faciliter et ordinate 
huiusmodi actus exercere potest, eadem ratione ars quaedam necessaria 
est, quae sit directiva ipsius actus rationis, per quam scilicet homo in ipso 
actu rationis ordinate, faciliter et sine errore procedat. Et haec ars est 
logica, idest rationalis scientia ». La raison, répétons-le, est capable de 
réﬂ échir sur ses propres actes. Or, par la réﬂ exion sur les actes de la main, 
la raison est déjà capable de produire une ordinatio, c’est-à-dire une ars : il 
s’agit de l’une des artes produites par un ordre du troisième type selon le 
schéma d’in Arist EN, comme l’architecture, grâce à laquelle l’homme peut 
procéder avec ordre et facilité – on a donc ici la deuxième occurrence du 
couple d’adverbes ‘ordinate’ et ‘faciliter’. Par conséquent, et d’autant plus 
qu’elle part de la réﬂ exion sur elle-même, la raison sera obligée – saint 
Thomas parle en termes de nécessité – de produire une ars qui donne un 
ordre aux actes de l’homme, c’est-à-dire – et voici la troisième occurrence 
du couple d’adverbes –, qui en rend l’exécution facile et ordonnée, mais 
aussi – voici l’élément nouveau – « sine errore ». Cette ars, c’est justement 
la logique, de la même façon que dans in Arist EN il a été indiqué à propos 
du premier type d’ordre que la ratio « considerando facit ». Il y a sans doute 
un ordre naturel de la raison que la raison même peut arriver à connaître 
(« considerando ») ; mais la mise en ordre, l’ordinatio, qui correspond à la 
logique, c’est le résultat de l’ordre possible que la raison trouve aﬁ n de 
rendre l’exécution de ses actes facile et sans erreur. La question que nous 
pouvons poser concerne justement l’ajout d’une troisième locution 
adverbiale, « sine errore », à « ordinate » et « facile » : pourquoi, lorsque 
saint Thomas se réfère soit à n’importe quelle ars, soit au cas particulier des 
30 Il est ici évident que ars et scientia sont utilisés de manière synonyme ; mais il 
y a aussi des passages où saint Thomas veut marquer une distinction, comme le suivant, 
Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 57, a. 3 ad 3 : « Ad tertium dicendum quod etiam in ipsis 
speculabilibus est aliquid per modum cuiusdam operis, puta constructio syllogismi 
aut orationis congruae aut opus numerandi vel mensurandi. Et ideo quicumque 
ad huiusmodi opera rationis habitus speculativi ordinantur, dicuntur per quandam 
similitudinem artes, sed liberales; ad differentiam illarum artium quae ordinantur ad 
opera per corpus exercita, quae sunt quodammodo serviles, inquantum corpus serviliter 
subditur animae, et homo secundum animam est liber. Illae vero scientiae quae ad 
nullum huiusmodi opus ordinantur, simpliciter scientiae dicuntur, non autem artes ».

 
LE CARACTÈRE FORMEL DE LA LOGIQUE EN TANT QUʼARS 
89
artes productrices, n’utilise-t-il que le couple adverbial « ordinate » et 
« faciliter », tandis que dans le cas de l’ars de la logique, il ajoute aussi 
«sine errore» ? Cela veut-il dire que le fait de procéder selon la vérité ne 
concerne que la logique, alors que les autres artes peuvent procéder dans 
l’erreur ? Assurément non, puisque sans la vérité parmi les buts, il ne peut 
s’agir d’une ars ! Je crois que pour comprendre le sens de ce « sine errore » 
nous pouvons demander de l’aide à l’un des pères de la logique 
contemporaine, Gottlob Frege, notamment lorsqu’il relève que la tâche 
propre de la logique est « de découvrir les lois de l’être vrai »31. Cette 
remarque semble bien en ligne avec le rôle que saint Thomas, dans son 
Commentaire au De Trinitate de Boèce, attribue à la logique par rapport aux 
sciences spéculatives dont le but est justement le vrai32 : « Res autem, de 
quibus est logica, non quaeruntur ad cognoscendum propter se ipsas, sed ut 
adminiculum quoddam ad alias scientias ». Dans un passage suivant du 
même commentaire, là où saint Thomas aborde la question de l’ordre à 
suivre pour l’apprentissage des disciplines (sciences ou artes) et donne la 
raison pour laquelle il faut commencer par l’étude de la logique, il dit « quia 
aliae scientiae ab ipsa dependent, in quantum ipsa docet modum procedendi 
in omnibus scientiis »33 ; certes, pour que la logique puisse enseigner le 
modus procedendi dans toutes les autres sciences, elle doit être construite de 
manière à permettre d’apprendre la façon de procéder « sine errore ». Mais 
qu’est-ce que cela veut dire ? Je crois que cela a trait au caractère, si l’on 
peut dire, spécialement universel de la logique, qui en fait une ars artium. 
Mais il est important de préciser d’emblée que cette universalité ne fait pas 
que la logique contient les autres artes : dire que la logique est ars artium 
ne signiﬁ e pas qu’elle est l’ars architectonique34 relativement aux autres. 
31 G. FREGE, « The thought: A Logical Inquiry », Mind, LXV-259 (1956) 289-311: 
« The word “true” indicates the aim of logic as does “beautiful” that of aesthetics or 
“good” that of ethics. All sciences have truth as their goal; but logic is also concerned 
with it in a quite different way from this. It has much the same relation to truth as 
physics has to weight or heat. To discover truths is the task of all sciences; it falls to 
logic to discern the laws of truth. […] Rules for asserting, thinking, judging, inferring, 
follow from the laws of truth ».

dicit quod in omnibus artibus vel virtutibus hoc communiter est verum, quod ﬁ nes

artium vel virtutum, quae sunt sub principalibus. Quod probat per hoc, quod homines

GIULIA LOMBARDI
Pour le formuler différemment : nous avons vu que toute ars se constitue 
par des règles générales à partir d’expériences similaires. Cette universalité 
est nécessaire pour saisir le pourquoi de l’objet que l’on veut connaître. 
Mais celui qui a appris et exerce une ars n’est pas reconnu comme artifex 
par l’application conséquente et indiscriminée de ces règles ; celle-ci peut 
même causer de graves erreurs. Pensons, par exemple, à la médecine : il faut 
exercer la prudentia (phronesis en grec) pour juger les cas particuliers. Par 
contre, dans le cas de l’ars qu’est la logique, une fois que l’artifex a compris 
le pourquoi et a établi les « determinata media » pour arriver « ad debitum 
ﬁ nem », il peut procéder en suivant les règles sans risquer de tomber dans la 
faute, sine errore35. C’est pour cette raison que j’ai attribué à la logique un 
caractère spécialement universel, puisque, comme les autres artes, elle se 
constitue de manière universelle, mais à la différence des autres, elle peut 
aussi procéder de manière universelle. Pour cela, elle peut être considérée 
modus operandi, ou comme saint Thomas l’indique in in Arist APo, « ars 
artium » ; dans cette tâche, il faut que la logique ait davantage un caractère 
universel, voire formel. Et le fait de lui reconnaître cette tâche ne me semble 
pas contraposé au constat que fait J.-B. Échivard quand il commente 
justement ce passage d’in Arist Apo et la formule « ars des arts» : «Thomas 
ne parle pas de “forme”  universelle de la raison »36. C’est exact, il n’en 
parle pas, parce que, justement, il n’existe pas de forme universelle de la 
raison ; s’il est vrai que l’ordre des choses naturelles n’est pas propre à la 
raison, celle-ci est toutefois capable d’organiser ses actes en leur donnant 
une certaine forme qui de par sa nature est universelle et adéquate à une 
certaine matière, aﬁ n que sa réalisation procède de manière facile et 
ordonnée. La raison est capable de réﬂ échir sur elle-même, mais pas de 
manière absolue et totale, sinon il ne s’agirait pas de la raison humaine et la 
logique s’identiﬁ erait avec la sophia. Or nous savons que cela n’est pas le 
cas pour saint Thomas, ni d’ailleurs pour Aristote, qui se distingue de son 
maître en niant justement l’identiﬁ cation de la dialectique avec la 
persequuntur, id est quaerunt, illa, id est ﬁ nes inferiorum artium vel virtutum gratia 
horum, idest propter ﬁ nes superiorum. Litera autem suspensiva est, et sic legenda: 
quaecumque sunt talium sub una quadam virtute... in omnibus utique architectonicarum 
ﬁ nes ».
35 La méthode actuelle des tables de vérité peut constituer un bon exemple: en sa 
qualité de mécanique, elle résume les trois attributs – exprimés chez saint Thomas de 
manière adverbiale – à savoir le fait d’être facile, ordonnée et sans erreur.

philosophie. Par contre, nous pouvons nous appuyer sur des textes du 
Docteur Angélique pour lui attribuer l’idée qu’une variation de la forme est 
possible à l’intérieur d’une ars et, donc, à l’intérieur de la logique ; nous 
trouverons de la sorte la réponse à la deuxième question posée au début de 
ce travail. Ainsi, dans le commentaire à la Physique d’Aristote37, aﬁ n de 
rendre clair que les animaux, à la différence des humains, procèdent dans 
leurs opérations selon un principe naturel et non selon l’intellect (per 
intellectum), saint Thomas montre qu’il leur manque la possibilité de varier, 
qui caractérise ce qui provient de l’intellect et, ajoute-t-il, de l’ars : « omnis 
enim hirundo similiter facit nidum, et omnis araneus similiter facit telam, 
quod non esset si ab intellectu et arte operarentur » ; pour expliquer en quoi 
consiste cette variation, il fait référence à la capacité de l’artifex de varier la 
forme qu’il juge en tant qu’objet de son ars: « omnis enim hirundo similiter 
facit nidum, et omnis araneus similiter facit telam, quod non esset si ab 
intellectu et arte operarentur: non enim omnis aediﬁ cator similiter facit 
domum, quia artifex habet iudicare de forma artiﬁ ciati, et potest eam 
variare »38. De nouveau, si cela vaut pour l’ars en général, cela vaut a 
fortiori pour l’ars artium, la logique. Nous pouvons ainsi voir même les 
différents systèmes de la logique contemporaine comme une variation de la 
forme sur la base de la matière choisie, avec en commun un même but. 
Mais, comme je l’ai indiqué dans l’introduction, je ne veux pas rentrer dans 
la question de la forme logique et, par voie de conséquence, de la matière 
logique. Dans l’étude proposée ici, j’ai voulu me concentrer sur un sens plus 
large de ‘forme’, qui correspond à celui d’ars, ainsi que nous pouvons le 
relever dans le livre Λ de la Métaphysique d’Aristote. Dans les textes de 
saint Thomas que j’ai cités tout au long de ce travail, le rapprochement entre 
forme et ars reste implicite, mais ses attributs, notamment, celui de 
l’universalité et de l’ordre, sont bel et bien présents. Ces textes ont, de fait, 
montré l’aspect universel et ordonné de n’importe quelle ars, et plus 
particulièrement de l’ars logique.
37 Thomas d’Aquin, in Arist Phys, lib. 2, l. 13, n. 5.
38 Cf. aussi Thomas d’Aquin, De potentia, q. 6, a. 1 ad 12: « Ad decimumse-
cundum dicendum, quod ars divina non totam seipsam explicat in creaturarum 
productione; et ideo secundum artem suam potest alio modo aliquid operari quam 
habeat cursus naturae; unde non sequitur quod si potest facere contra cursum naturae, 
possit facere contra suam artem: nam et homo artifex potest aliud artiﬁ ciatum facere 
per suam artem contrario modo quam prius fecit ».

LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES 
SYLLOGISMES SOPHISTIQUES SELON ROBERT KILWARDBY
Introduction 
L’étude des difﬁ cultés que pose à Robert Kilwardby l’analyse 
logique des syl logismes sophistiques permet de suivre l’émergence d’une 
interrogation théorique sur la forme et la matière syllogistiques. On y 
voit comment les discussions sur la démarcation entre les arguments 
matériellement et formellement sophistiques dans les Réfutations 
sophistiques, déjà très élaborées au moment où démarrent les premiers 
commentaires aux Premiers Analytiques, y jouent un rôle décisif1. 
De nombreux spécialistes de la logique aristotélicienne, héritiers de 
Jaeger et naturellement enclins à une approche formelle de la logique, 
distinguent deux sens de « syllogisme ». Il s’agit de rendre compte de 
l’existence d’inférences nécessaires, parfois appelées par Aristote 
syllogismoi, qui ne suivent manifestement pas les modes et les ﬁ gures 
syllogistiques des Premiers analytiques : on les trouve dans les Topiques, 
les Réfutations sophistiques, et dans certains passages des Premiers 
analytiques eux-mêmes, pour lesquelles on parle volontiers de «syllogisme 
au sens large». On traduit alors parfois syllogismos par «déduction»2, par 
opposition au «syllogisme au sens strict» ou « syllogisme » tout court. 
Cette distinction, sinon cette double traduction, n’est pas sans fondement, 
puisqu’Aristote appelle « syllogismes » des arguments qui ne sont pas en

2 Voir par exemple la traduction du terme syllogismos par J. BRUNSCHWIG 
au début des Topiques (100a25-27): « un raisonnement déductif est une formule 
d’argumentation dans laquelle, certaines choses étant posées, une chose distincte de 
celles qui ont été posées s’ensuit nécessairement », Les Belles Lettres, Paris 2002, 
p. 1 ; voir également G. STRIKER, Aristotle’s Prior Analytics, Book 1, Oxford 2009, qui 
choisit «  deduction » mais utilise ponctuellement «  syllogism ».

modes et ﬁ gures, et parfois, au contraire, les contraste avec les syllogismes3. 
Elle se fait néanmoins au mépris d’une déﬁ nition quasi identique du 
« syllogisme » dans tous les textes précités, ainsi que dans la Rhétorique4. 
Pour les commentateurs médiévaux, comme pour les exégètes tardo-
antiques, l’Organon a un auteur, Aristote, il a une cohérence interne 
de principe, et la critique génétique n’est pas encore à l’ordre du jour. 
Aussi tous les syllogismi sont-ils des syllogismes, l’absence de mise en 
forme syllogistique effective dans le texte aristotélicien étant considérée 
comme un non problème. C’est le cas dans les ouvrages de philosophie 
naturelle dont l’étude systématique commence de manière concomitante 
à celle des Premiers analytiques et des Topiques, où l’on reconstitue 
systématiquement les syllogismes sous-entendus par Aristote : la théorie 
du syllogisme démonstratif est spontanément perçue (et, au besoin, ré-
instaurée) comme la logique sous-jacente de la science. Il en est de 
même dans les ouvrages logiques : on reconstitue des raisonnements en 
« Barbara » et autres « Darii » dans les Topiques, et, ce qui nous intéresse 
ici au premier chef, dans les Réfutations sophistiques. Dans le même 
temps, le modèle alexandrin de divisions des syllogismes à l’aide du 
couple matière-forme transmis par « Alexandre »5 commence à saturer 
3 Voir J. BARNES, (« Proof and the Syllogism », in E. BERTI (ed.), Aristotle on 
Science: The Posterior Analytics, Padua 1981, pp. 17-60) qui explique avec raison que 
sans cette distinction le programme de réduction de tous les arguments valides aux 
syllogismes n’aurait pas de sens.
4 Pour les Topiques, voir note 2 supra. Premiers analytiques 24b17-22 : « le 
syllogisme est un discours, dans lequel certaines [choses] étant posées, quelque chose 
d’autre que celles-ci en résulte nécessairement par le seul fait de celles-ci. Par le seul 
fait de celles-ci : je veux dire que c’est par elles que le résultat est obtenu ; à son 
tour, l’expression “c’est par elle que la conséquence est obtenue” signiﬁ e qu’aucun 
terme étranger n’est en sus requis pour produire la conclusion nécessaire», trad. J. 
TRICOT, Vrin, Paris 2001, pp. 4-5 (légèrement modiﬁ ée) ; Rhétorique 1356b15-18 : 
« de l’existence de certaines choses, il résulte – à cause d’elles – une chose différente et 
distincte d’elles, du seul fait que ces choses-là existent soit de manière universelle, soit 
dans la plupart des cas, c’est ce qu’on appelle là un syllogisme et ici un enthymème », 
trad. P. CHIRON, Flammarion, Paris 2007, p. 129 ; Réfutations sophistiques 168a25: 
« La déduction (= syllogismos) s’effectue à partir de choses posées de telle façon 
qu’elles entraînent nécessairement l’assertion d’une chose différente d’elles, mais 
qui résulte d’elles », trad. L. A. DORION, Aristote, les Réfutations sophistiques, Vrin,

déﬁ cients dans les Réfutations sophistiques, puis pour toute enquête 
s’intéressant à la déﬁ nition du syllogisme et de la forme syllogistique 
après la « redécouverte »6 des Premiers analytiques. 
C’est ainsi que naît le problème spéciﬁ que que nous souhaitons 
aborder ici : après le commentaire de l’Anonymus Cantabrigiensis au 
Réfutations sophistiques, situé au tournant des XIIe et XIIIe siècles7, un 
Seconds analytiques inspirés des commentateurs tardo-antiques et particulièrement de 
Philopon, voir l’étude de S. EBBESEN, Commentators and Commentaries on Aristotle’s 
Sophistici Elenchi : a Study of Post-Aristotelian Ancient and Medieval Writings on 
Fallacies, Leiden 1981, vol. II, pp. 233-530, en particulier pp. 346-347 et vol. III, 
pp. 4-7), et une série de publications du même auteur, notamment, « Analysing 
Syllogisms or Anonymous Aureliensis III, the (presumbably) Earliest Extant Latin 
Commentary on the Prior Analytics and its Greek Model », CIMAGL, 37 (1981) 1-20,

on Analytica posteriora and Sophistici elenchi » (CIMAGL, 60 (1990) 113-120), parue

202 et « Anonymi Parisiensis Compendium Sophisticorum Elenchorum: The Uppsala 
Version », CIMAGL, 66 (1996) 253-312.
6 On sait que la syllogistique assertorique a été continûment transmise au Moyen 
Âge par les opuscules de Boèce et que les Premiers analytiques étaient déjà connus 
à l’époque d’Abélard. Ils ont eu une réception très intéressante au XIIe siècle, pour 
laquelle Ch. Martin a récemment fait des hypothèses d’une grande pertinence (« “They 
had added not a single tiny proposition” : The Reception of the Prior Analytics in the 
First Half of the Twelfth Century », Vivarium, 48 (2010) 159-192). Mais cela ne veut 
pas dire qu’il faille considérer l’apparition d’une exégèse complète et systématique des 
Premiers analytiques au tournant des XIIe et XIIIe siècles comme un non-événement. 
On a tendance à relativiser l’importance des débuts d’une lecture systématique du texte 
des Premiers analytiques dans l’histoire de la logique, en insistant sur l’importance 
des opuscules boéciens, lorsqu’on considère que l’essentiel des Premiers analytiques 
consiste dans la syllogistique assertorique (livre I, chap. 1 à 7) et, parfois, modale (I, 
chap. 8-26), à laquelle on reconnaît tout de même une réception spéciﬁ que au XIIIe 
siècle. C’est précisément cette conception qui est écartée ici. Il s’agit au contraire de 
montrer l’importance d’une lecture globale des Premiers analytiques (y compris la 
ﬁ n du livre I et tout le livre II) comme porteurs d’une théorie du syllogisme à laquelle 
contribuent de manière notoire les Réfutations sophistiques.

Aristotelian Tradition: The Reception of Aristotle’s Works on Logic and Metaphysics in the 
Middle Ages, à paraître en 2017. Ce « Barbara  sophistique » apparaît pour la première fois, 
à notre connaissance, dans ce commentaire, et il est repris dans toute la tradition ultérieure.

JULIE BRUMBERG-CHAUMONT
certain nombre de paralogismes dans les commentaires aux Réfutations 
sophistiques sont reformulés dans des arguments qui suivent les modes et les 
ﬁ gures syllogistiques, tout en étant parfois décrits comme « formellement 
déﬁ cients ». L’exemple typique est, pour le paralogisme de l’accident, le 
« Barbara sophistique » : « omne aes est naturale ; omnis statua est aes ; 
ergo omnis statua est naturalis », présent dans l’Anonymus Cantabrigiensis.
Nous avons choisi de nous concentrer ici sur les ouvrages logiques 
de Robert Kilwardby dont les thèses servent de référence aux auteurs de 
sa génération, tels Albert le Grand, et de matrices pour la production de 
nouveaux problèmes dans la génération suivante8. L’enquête s’appuie sur 
des textes dont l’authenticité n’est pas mise en question, tels le commentaire 
aux Premiers analytiques, aux Topiques, et le De Ortu scientiarum, 
auxquels s’ajoute le commentaire aux Réfutations sophistiques, qui n’a pas 
été attribué de manière déﬁ nitive. 
1. Arguments formellement et matériellement sophistiques
Au début des Topiques (I, 1), Aristote distingue parmi les raisonne-
ments éristiques 1)  les raisonnements qui sont des syllogismes mais partent 
de prémisses apparemment admises, 2) les raisonnements qui ne sont que 
des apparences de syllogismes mais partent de prémisses véritablement 
admises, 3) les raisonnements qui sont des apparences de syllogismes et 
partent de prémisses apparemment admises, et 4) les paralogismes en un 
sens qui est propre aux Topiques, qu’on retrouve aussi dans les Seconds 
analytiques: ce sont les raisonnements syllogistiques qui partent de 
prémisses apparemment propres à une science donnée, mais qui lui sont 
en fait extrinsèques. Nous laissons ce sens de « paralogisme » de côté ici. 
Cette classiﬁ cation a été universellement interprétée par tous les 
commentateurs anciens, médiévaux et contemporains à partir de la 
distinction entre la matière et la forme : les raisonnements de type 1 sont 
matériellement éristiques, tandis que ceux de type 2 et 3 sont formellement 
éristiques.
8 Voir notamment les commentaires aux Réfutations sophistiques anonymes 
(Incerti Auctores) édités par EBBESEN en 1977, que nous évoquons plus loin en 
conclusion, le commentaire de Simon de Faversham aux Réfutations sophistiques, le 
commentaire de Boèce de Dacie aux Topiques.

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
97
La façon dont on comprend la typologie des arguments éristiques 
des Topiques instrumente à son tour la manière dont le classement des 
syllogismes sophistiques est interprété dans les Réfutations sophistiques. 
Celle-ci dépend également de la manière dont la première phrase du traité 
est lue, selon l’interprétation que l’on donnera du kai/et : 
De sophisticis autem elenchis et (kai) de his qui videntur quidem 
elenchi, sunt autem paralogismi sed non elenchi dicemus (Sophistici 
Elenchi, AL VI/1-3, p. 5).
Ce qui peut se traduire selon que le kai / et est compris comme un kai 
épéxégétique ou comme une conjonction (« numeraliter » dans l’exégèse 
médiévale) : 
Traitons maintenant a) des réfutations sophistiques et b) des 
[arguments] qui ont l’apparence de réfutations mais sont des 
paralogismes et non des réfutations.
Ou bien par : 
Traitons maintenant des réfutations sophistiques, c’est-à-dire des 
arguments qui se présentent comme des réfutations, mais qui sont 
en fait des paralogismes et non des réfutations (Les Réfutations 
sophistiques, trad. L.-A. Dorion, p. 119).
L’interprétation «numeraliter», comme une conjonction, du « kai 
/ et », couplée avec l’introduction du couple matière-forme, induit la 
classiﬁ cation suivante : a) les syllogismes matériellement sophistiques, 
mais syllogistiques tout de même (les arguments de type n° 1 des 
Topiques), et b) les raisonnements formellement éristiques qui sont des 
apparences de syllogismes (les arguments nº 2 et 3 des Topiques), appelés 
« paralogismes » dans les Réfutations sophistiques en un sens distinct de 
celui des Topiques I, 1.
Il s’agit d’une interprétation spontanée, qu’on retrouve, par exemple, 
dans l’introduction de Jacques Brunschwig à sa traduction des Topiques9 
ou dans le commentaire de L.-A. Dorion aux Réfutations sophistiques10. 
Elle est typique d’une conception moderne de la notion de forme logique

en ce qu’elle présuppose naturellement qu’un défaut de matière n’entraîne 
pas nécessairement la corruption de l’être syllogistique du raisonnement, 
la forme étant «indifférente» au contenu avec lequel on la remplit, tandis 
qu’un défaut de forme implique nécessairement que le raisonnement ne 
peut plus être un syllogisme.
Ce présupposé pose un problème à nos maîtres du XIIIe siècle, pétris 
d’hylémorphisme aristotélicien, où l’union de la forme et de la matière 
est une « composition essentielle » dans laquelle l’absence d’un des deux 
composants, aussi bien la matière que la forme, entraîne la non-existence 
du composé. Ils sont en outre fortement inﬂ uencés par l’interprétation 
d’Avicenne, qui fait entrer la matière dans la déﬁ nition des composés 
hylémorphiques dont la forme ne peut être séparées de la matière, fût-
elle une matière « générale ». Ces notions s’appliquent au composé 
hylémorphique qu’est le syllogisme, en dépit du fait qu’il est considéré 
comme un artéfact. Non seulement un composé doit avoir une matière et 
ne peut persister si sa matière est « corrompue », s’il n’a plus de matière du 
tout, mais il doit avoir en outre une matière qui soit un substrat adapté à sa 
forme, si ce n’est son substrat propre, comme dans le cas des êtres naturels. 
D’un autre côté, il existe une équivalence spontanée, héritée des 
commentateurs tardo-antiques, entre les notions de prémisses fausses 
et celle de prémisses sophistiques. La notion de fausseté est elle-même 
rattachée, quoique de manière implicite, à la notion de déﬁ cience : une 
prémisse sophistique est une prémisse fausse, et, par conséquent une matière 
déﬁ ciente pour la forme syllogistique. C’est notamment pour répondre à 
ce problème que Robert Kilwardby va donner au syllogisme simpliciter, 
une matière, les « lettres » elles-mêmes, les « termes transcendants » 
selon la terminologie médiévale. Reste à savoir si ce dispositif permet de 
répondre à la difﬁ culté précise posée par le respect des modes et des ﬁ gures 
syllogistiques par des arguments formellement déﬁ cients : sont-ils tout de 
même des syllogismes simpliciter ? 
Quelques clariﬁ cations sur la notion de « matière du syllogisme » 
s’imposent d’abord.
2. Matières du syllogisme
On peut dégager au moins deux acceptions distinctes de la notion de 
« matière du syllogisme » :

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
99
[Sens 1] Une notion, dont témoigne Ammonius, est celle de « matière 
des propositions ». Il s’agit d’un sens technique de « modalité matérielle », 
qui caractérise les relations entre les choses signiﬁ és par les termes de 
la proposition (relations nécessaires, impossibles, contingentes). Se sont 
agrégées à ce sens des modalités aléthiques et épistémiques. Dans les 
discussions sur la classiﬁ cation des arguments déﬁ cients, c’est le critère 
aléthique qui a été privilégié : les arguments matériellement déﬁ cients sont 
les arguments partant de prémisses fausses11 ; ils sont en outre éristiques 
puisqu’ils se donnent l’apparence du vrai. C’est parfois ce sens que prend 
la « matière du syllogisme ». Un exemple typique d’un syllogisme qui 
pèche par la matière est alors le syllogisme « quoniam » des Analytiques 
II, 2 et 4, ou bien le syllogisme « seulement-matériellement-déﬁ cient » des 
Topiques et des Réfutations sophistiques. 
[Sens 2] Parfois la matière du syllogisme n’est pas rabattue sur la 
matière de la proposition mais elle est considérée comme la proposition 
elle-même, comme proposition, indépendamment de sa matière. C’est ce 
deuxième sens de matière qui est en jeu quand Robert Kilwardby attribue 
au syllogisme simpliciter une matière qui lui est propre et qui ne peut faillir. 
Parfois encore la matière du syllogisme est une notion plus vague 
et correspond au contenu concret dans la forme syllogistique du fait du 
remplacement des « lettres » par des termes concrets. Ce dernier sens de 
matière est spéciﬁ quement lié à l’idée que l’usage des lettres dans les Premiers 
analytiques permet d’étudier la forme indépendamment de toute matière.
3. Le syllogisme simpliciter comme un composé de forme et de matière 
dans le commentaire aux Premiers analytiques
La position de Robert Kilwardby sur la forme et la matière du syllogisme 
est très claire dans le prologue de son commentaire aux Premiers analytiques 
(ca. 1240). Le logicien anglais s’y interroge sur la nature du syllogisme 
11 Sur cet amalgame du sophistique et du faux, voir la classiﬁ cation des arguments 
en fonction des modalités aléthiques dans la tradition tardo-antiques de l’Organon long, 
qui sera repris dans la tradition arabe, où les prémisses des argument dialectiques sont 
à moitié vraies ou à moitié fausses, mais plus vraies que fausse, les rhétoriques plus 
fausses que vraies, les sophistiques fausses mais apparemment vraies et les poétiques 
tellement fausses qu’elles n’ont pas même l’air vraies. Voir le tableau proposé par 
EBBESEN, Commentators and Commentaries, vol. I, p. 91.

pur et simple (simpliciter) et sur sa capacité à être le sujet d’une science, 
et plus précisément celle des Premiers analytiques. Une fois établi que le 
syllogisme pur et simple est une réalité sufﬁ samment constituée en soi, dotée 
de sa bonitas propre, pour être objet d’une science, la question est de savoir 
si le syllogisme pur et simple est l’objet des Premiers analytiques. Plusieurs 
objections sont avancées. Une objection nous dit qu’un genre n’a pas d’être 
séparément de ses espèces, que le syllogisme pur et simple est le genre 
des syllogismes démonstratifs et dialectiques, donc que le syllogisme pur et 
simple n’a pas d’existence séparée. Il ne peut ainsi être l’objet des Premiers 
analytiques, qui portent sur un syllogisme qui possède un être distinct du 
syllogisme dialectique et démonstratif, c’est-à-dire un syllogisme dans une 
matière transcendante, comme dans ces termes « A » et « B » et non dans 
une matière probable ou une matière nécessaire12. Une autre objection nous 
dit que puisque les autres livres portent sur le syllogisme contracté dans une 
matière donnée, il apparaît que les Premiers analytiques ne portent pas sur 
le syllogisme simpliciter mais sur la forme du syllogisme.
La réponse de Kilwardby se concentre d’abord sur ce dernier point : 
Contre ceux qui disent qu’Aristote traite seulement de la forme du 
syllogisme13 : il déﬁ nit en effet au début [des Premiers analytiques] la 
proposition et le terme en vue du syllogisme et ceux-ci sont ensemble 
les [composants] matériels pour le syllogisme. De même il déﬁ nit 
le syllogisme pur et simple, mais celui-ci ne revient pas seulement 
à la forme du syllogisme. Bien que le syllogisme pur et simple dont 
s’occupent les Premiers analytiques soit donc une forme relativement 
au syllogisme dialectique et au syllogisme démonstratif, il n’apparaît 
pourtant pas qu’il faille dire que le livre des Premiers analytiques 
porte uniquement sur la forme, mais plutôt qu’il considère aussi bien 
la forme que la matière du syllogisme en général14.

probabili neque in materia necessaria », Expositio Egidii Romani super libros priorum 
Analeticorum Aristotelis cum textu euisdem, Venetiis 1499, f. 2rb. 
13 C’est la position de l’anonymous Aurelianensis III, un commentaire incomplet 
aux Premiers Analytiques de la ﬁ n du XIIe siècle, le premier connu à ce jour. Voir le 
prologue dans l’édition partielle de EBBESEN, « Analysing Syllogisms or Anonymus 
Aurelianensis III », Repr. in Greek-Latin philosophical interactions, vol. 1, op. cit., pp. 
171-187) et l’édition à paraître de Ch. THÖRNVISQ-THOMSEN.

syllogismi. Defﬁ nit enim in principio propositionem et terminum propter syllogismum 

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
101
La réponse à l’objection précédente est la suivante : 
Il faut dire que le syllogisme pur et simple n’est pas véritablement 
un genre pour [les syllogismes] dialectique et démonstratif, puisque 
le genre se divise véritablement par les différences formelles 
qui, lui advenant, constituent véritablement les espèces. Mais les 
syllogismes dialectique et démonstratif ne sont pas constitués 
par des différences véritablement formelles qui adviendraient au 
syllogisme pur et simple, mais plutôt par des différences matérielles. 
Le syllogisme pur et simple est donc quelque chose de constitué 
en acte formellement en amont [des syllogismes] dialectique et 
démonstratif. Il fait abstraction de ces derniers selon son être en 
ce sens qu’il est possible d’en avoir une connaissance certaine et 
d’en donner un exemple dans des termes communs en lesquels ne 
sont ni le syllogisme dialectique, ni le syllogisme démonstratif. S’il 
était véritablement un genre il ne serait pas véritablement quelque 
chose de constitué dans l’être en amont de ceux-ci et il ne serait pas 
possible d’avoir une connaissance certaine de quoi que ce soit à son 
propos en dehors de son instanciation dans un syllogisme spécial, 
dialectique ou démonstratif15.
Le De Ortu scientiarum (ca. 1250) précise que la matière du syllogisme 
simpliciter est comme la matière intelligible des objets mathématiques, 
et omnia hec sunt materialia syllogismo. Item deﬁ nit syllogismum simpliciter sed 
syllogismus simpliciter non dicit solum formam […] quamvis ergo syllogismus 
simpliciter de quo agitur in Prioribus sit forma ad syllogismum dialectium et 
demonstrativum, tamen non videtur esse dicendum quod liber Prioribus sit tantummodo 
de forma sed magis considerat tam formam quam materiam syllogismi in genere », 
Expositio Egidii Romani super libros priorum Analeticorum, f. 2rb.
15 « Dicendum quod syllogismus simpliciter non est vere genus ad dialecticum 
et demonstrativum quia vere genus dividitur per formales differentias per quas ei 
advenientes constituuntur vere species. Sed dialecticus syllogismus et demonstrativus 
non sunt constituti per differentias vere formales syllogismo simpliciter adveninentes 
sed magis per differentias materiales magis. Et ideo syllogimus simpliciter est actu et 
formaliter constitutum in esse ante syllogismum dialecticum et demonstrativum. Et ideo 
abstrahit eis secundum esse in tantum quod potest aliquid certiﬁ cari et exempliﬁ cari 
de ipso in terminis communibus in quibus neque ﬁ t dialecticus syllogismus neque 
demonstrativus. Si autem (éd.: ante) esset vere genus tunc non esset aliquid vere 
(éd.: consideratum) constitutum in esse ante ipsos neque posset tunc  certiﬁ cari de 
syllogismo simpliciter aliquid nisi manifestato syllogismo speciali ut in dialectico vel 
demonstrativo », Expositio Egidii Romani super libros priorum Analeticorum, f. 2rb.

différente de la matière des différents cercles matériels qui peuvent être 
réalisés sur son modèle16.  
Toute la discussion de Kilwardby présuppose un « principe 
hylémorphique » clairement formulé dans le commentaire aux Topiques 
qui lui est attribué.
4. Le principe « hylémorphique » dans le commentaire aux Topiques
À propos des syllogismes seulement matériellement éristiques, qui 
sont des syllogismes, Robert Kilwardby envisage l’objection consistant à 
dire que si la matière est fautive la forme ne peut subsister, pas plus que 
le composé : les syllogismes matériellement éristiques ne pourraient donc 
pas être des syllogismes. C’est exactement la thèse qui sera condamnée 
à Oxford en 1277 sous l’égide de Robert Kilwardby: « le syllogisme qui 
pèche par la matière n’est pas un syllogisme »17. 
16 « Quia istae differentiae ratiocinationum ex propriis [i. e. pour le syllogisme

parte materiae […] et forma ratiocinationis eadem est in omni materia, ideo oportuit 
logicam tradere tractatum de modo ratiocinandi in genere prout abstrahit ab omni 
materia propria vel communi, ad quam videlicet respiceret tam demonstrator quam 
dialecticus ratiocinari volens. Eadem enim est forma syllogistica in utraque materia, 
scilicet in necessaria et probabili. Nota tamen quod non ita abstrahit haec forma quod 
determinetur de ipsa sine omnimoda materia, quia hoc esse non posset. Sed sicut 
mathematica abstrahuntur a materia physica tantum et nihilominus ipsa habent suam 
materiam intelligibilem […] sic forma syllogistica et omnino ratiocinativa abstrahitur 
a forma communi et propria, id est probabili et necessaria. Habet tamen secum 
quandam materiam simpliciorm quae est intra utramque dictam, scilicet tres terminos, 
duo extrema et medium unum ex quibus connectuntur duae propositiones. De forma 
autem syllogistica et omnino ratiocinativa in libro Priorum Aristotelos determinetur, 
ubi ponuntur semper tres termines constituentes duas propositiones, sed tales qui 
abstrahant a materia probabili et necessaria », De Ortu scientiarum, éd. A. G. JUDY,

LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
103
La réponse ne consiste pas à remettre en question le principe 
hylémorphique évoqué, auquel Robert Kilwardby souscrit pleinement, mais 
à dire que le syllogisme simpliciter a une matière essentielle qui ne peut 
faillir. Il va plus loin en disant que les matières des syllogismes dialectiques 
et démonstratifs leur sont accidentelles en tant que syllogismes : 
On s’interroge, en septième lieu, sur le fait qu’[Aristote] indique 
que [le syllogisme éristique] est un syllogisme même s’il pèche par 
la matière. Cela semble faux puisque tout composé de forme et de 
matière est tel que si la matière ou la forme fait défaut le composé fait 
défaut, et ceci parce que chaque forme n’appelle pas n’importe quelle 
matière mais celle qui lui est propre : c’est ainsi que le syllogisme qui 
se fait à partir d’une [prémisse] fausse, ou de deux fausses, n’est pas 
un syllogisme parce qu’en ce cas la matière fait défaut. 
Il faut répondre que la matière essentielle dans le syllogisme consiste 
dans les trois termes et les deux propositions, et que si cette matière 
fait défaut, le syllogisme ne subsiste pas. 
Il y a, selon un autre mode, une matière accidentelle du syllogisme 
c’est-à-dire les trois termes et les deux propositions considérées 
selon la disposition que les propositions sont admises, vraies et 
nécessaires, et si cette matière fait défaut, il peut bien il avoir alors 
un syllogisme, et cela parce que cette matière est accidentelle18.
Ce texte est remarquable car le « principe hylémorphique » y est 
clairement exprimé : une forme ne peut être réalisée dans n’importe quelle 
matière, mais seulement dans la matière qui lui est appropriée, de sorte 
18 « Septimo queritur super hoc quod innuit sillogismus esse [i. e. le syllogisme 
éristique] etsi sit pecatum in materia. Hoc enim videtur falsum quia unumquodque 
compositum ex materia et forma sic se habet quod si ﬁ at defectus vel in materia vel in 
forma, erit defectus in composito, et hoc quia quelibet forma non appetet quamlibet 
materiam, set sibi propriam […] tunc quod sillogismus ex falsis vel ex falso non 
sit sillogismus et hoc quia ibi est peccatum in materia. Et dicendum quod materia 
essentialis in sillogismo sunt tres termines et due propositiones ; et si defectus in 
ipsa materia non manet sillogismus. Alio modo <materia> sillogismi accidentalis 
scilicet tres termini et due propositiones sub istis dispositionibus quod propositionibus 
sint probabiles, vere et necessarie, et si sit defectus in ista materia bene tunc potest 
sillogismus esse, et hoc quia hec materia accidentalis », In Librum Topicorum, éd. O. 
WEIJERS, « Le commentaire sur les Topiques attribué à Robert Kilwardby », Documenti 
e Studi sulla tradizione ﬁ losoﬁ ca medievale, VI (1995) 107-143, pp. 132-133.

que si cette matière fait défaut, la forme fait défaut, ainsi que le composé. 
Plus précisément, la matière du syllogisme au sens 2 est essentielle, tandis 
que la matière du syllogisme aux sens 1 est accidentelle. La thèse n’est 
pas que la matière au sens 1 est accidentelle à l’égard du syllogisme 
simpliciter, ce qui serait banal, mais qu’elle est accidentelle à l’égard d’un 
syllogisme donné dont elle est la matière. Lorsque cette matière fait défaut, 
le syllogisme reste un syllogisme en vertu de la matière au sens 2, qui lui 
confère l’être-syllogisme. La matière du syllogisme simpliciter est ainsi 
comme « sous-jacente » au syllogisme concret et elle se substitue à la 
matière concrète si celle-ci fait défaut.
5. Le « Barbara sophistique » dans les Premiers analytiques
Revenons à présent à l’analyse des arguments sophistiques qui suivent 
une combinaison syllogistique utile dans le commentaire aux Premiers 
Analytiques. Robert Kilwardby envisage l’argument qu’ils pourraient être 
considérés comme un contre-exemple au premier mode de la première 
ﬁ gure au prétexte que le Barbara sophistique conclurait du dici de nullo à 
partir du dici de omni. On sait en effet que dans un syllogisme le faux ne 
peut suivre du vrai. Si on peut produire un cas où une paire de propositions 
vraies donne une proposition fausse, comme Aristote lui-même le fait dans 
sa discussion sur la syllogistique modale, on doit exclure la combinaison 
en question. On sait également qu’une combinaison est non conclusive si 
aussi bien une proposition que son contraire peut suivre, comme dans le cas 
de la combinaison d’une majeure universelle afﬁ rmative et d’une mineure 
universelle négative dans la première ﬁ gure (Anal pr I, 4). La réponse de 
Robert Kilwardby consiste à dire que le dici de omni suit toujours, du moment 
qu’une conception sufﬁ samment abstraite de la relation de prédication est 
adoptée, et que le Barbara sophistique n’est pas un contre-exemple puisque 
le vrai suit bien du vrai. Le fait que la conclusion ne puisse être vraie que si 
le prédicat est considéré comme se prédiquant par accident du sujet19 n’est 
pas un problème, étant admis contrefactuellement que toutes les statues sont 
19 C’est par accident – en vertu de sa composition matérielle hic et nunc, et non 
de son essence – que la statue est « naturelle », parce qu’il se trouve qu’elle est faite en 
cuivre. Elle ne le serait pas si elle était faite en plastique, pour peu que le plastique soit 
considéré comme une matière « artiﬁ cielle » ou si elle était elle-même faite d’artéfacts, 
comme dans une accumulation d’Arman. L’important ici est que ce n’est pas en tant 
que statue qu’elle est naturelle.

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES

faites en métal, car la prédication impliquée dans le dici du dici de omni 
fait abstraction de la nature de la prédication, naturelle ou accidentelle20. Le 
Barbara sophistique est bien un syllogisme simpliciter en Barbara : 
Un doute peut être soulevé à propos du premier mode [de la 
première ﬁ gure]. Il semble en effet que cette combinaison est inutile 
puisqu’on trouve des termes qui donnent l’inhérence « dans tout » 
ou « dans aucun » […] comme dans le cas « Tout bronze est naturel, 
la statue est en bronze, la statue est naturelle ». Il faut dire que ce 
cas ne vaut rien, puisqu’il s’agit ici de la forme syllogistique dans 
une matière commune, qui est dégagée des matières probables, 
nécessaires et apparentes, de sorte que la forme dont il s’agit ici 
peut non seulement se trouver dans les syllogismes dialectiques et 
démonstratifs, mais aussi dans les sophistiques. C’est pourquoi il 
faut dire que la conclusion est bien obtenue, c’est-à-dire « toute 
statue est naturelle », selon l’artisan de ce livre, ou bien, si ce 
n’était pas le cas, il lui faudrait refuser la première ﬁ gure. La 
forme [de cet argument] est bonne selon lui et elle n’est pas exclue 
de la forme syllogistique telle que traitée ici. Pour le prouver, il 
faut savoir qu’il y a un double syllogisme, c’est-à-dire celui dont 
la nécessité est locale, dans lequel à partir de la majeure ou de la 
mineure la conclusion suit nécessairement, et il s’agit du syllogisme 
dialectique ou démonstratif ; l’autre syllogisme est celui dont la 
nécessité est celle de la combinaison uniquement, qui est causée 
20 Ici Robert Kilwardby prend manifestement position dans un débat sur la 
relation entre dici de omni et transitivité de la prédication, qu’elle soit essentielle ou 
non, dont l’Anonymous Cantabrigiensis se faisait déjà l’écho au début du XIIIe siècle 
à propos du « Barbara fallacieux » : « De huiusmodi tamen habetur controversia. 
Quidam enim non dicunt has maximas esse ‘Quicquid de praedicato praedicatur, et de 
subiecto’ ‘Quicquid a praedicato removetur, et a subiecto removetur’, immo falsas has 
dicunt, sed per adiectionem, posse ﬁ eri veras, sic sc.: ‘Quando aliquid de aliquo ut de 
subiecto <praedicatur>, quicquid de praedicato praedicatur ut de subiecto, de subiecto 
praedicabitur ut de subiecto’, ‘Quando alterum praedicatur de altero ut de subiecto, 
quicquid removetur a praedicato ut ab extraneo removetur a subiecto ut ab extraneo’. 
Alii dicunt has veras ‘Quicquid praedicatur de praedicato, praedicatur de subiecto’ 
‘Quicquid removetur a praedicato, removetur a subiecto’, nec in aliquibus terminis – 
sive extranee sive non extranee sumptis – posse inveniri instantiam. Nam cum naturale 
praedicetur de aere et aes de statua, naturale etiam praedicatur de statua, sic ‘Omnis 
statua est naturale’ vel sic ‘Quicquid est statua est naturale’, non sic autem ‘Omnis 
statua est naturalis’, et cum artiﬁ ciale removeatur ab aere, removebitur etiam a statua, 
sic ‘Nulla statua est artiﬁ cialis’ », éd. S. EBBESEN, à paraître 2016.

JULIE BRUMBERG-CHAUMONT
par la disposition correcte des termes et des propositions les uns 
par rapport aux autres, et il est commun au syllogisme dialectique, 
démonstratif et sophistique ; c’est de ce syllogisme et de cette forme 
que nous traitons ici. L’artisan des Premiers analytiques traite 
abstraitement le syllogisme et, de même, l’être-prédiqué, dans les 
propositions syllogistiques de sorte qu’il fait abstraction de l’être 
par soi ou de l’être par accident, raison pour laquelle il concède 
les prédications accidentelles. Quand on argumente ainsi en disant : 
« Tout bronze est naturel, la statue est en bronze, etc. », on dira 
que la conclusion est seulement vraie par accident, sans aucunement 
invalider la forme de l’argument21.
La solution de Kilwardby consiste ainsi à faire de tout argument 
une réalité gigogne : toit syllogisme est double puisque qu'il y a un 
syllogisme simpliciter sous-jacent à tout syllogisme concret. Ce dernier 
demeure un syllogisme dont la conclusion est obtenue formellement, en 
vertu de la combinaison seule, et ainsi en vertu du principe du dici de 
21 « Forte dubitatur de primo modo. Videtur enim quod sit inutilis coniugatio quia 
est reperire terminos omni et nulli inesse […] quod autem nulli inesse patet hoc : “ Omne 
aes est naturale, statua est aes, statua est naturalis ”. Et dicendum quod instantia nulla 
est, hic enim determinetur forma syllogistica in communissima materia, quae abstrahit 
a materia probabili et necessaria et apparenti, unde forma quae hic determinatur non 
tantum inveniri potest in dialecticis et demonstrativis, sed etiam in sophisticis. Unde 
dicendum quod sequitur conclusio, scilicet “ omnis statua est naturalis ” secundum 
artiﬁ cem huius libri, vel si non, neganda est prima secundum ipsum ; forma enim bona 
est secundum ipsum, et non excluditur a forma syllogistica hic determinata. Ad huius 
evidentiam sciendum quod duplex est syllogismus, scilicet ille cuius necessitas est 
localis, ubi ex maiori vel minori necessario sequitur conclusio, et talis est syllogismus 
dialecticus vel demonstrativus ; et alius est cuius necessitas est complexione tantum, 
hoc causata ex debita complexione terminorum ad invicem et propositionum, et talis 
est communis syllogismo dialectico, demonstrativo et sophisticos, et talis syllogismi 
necessitas et forma hic determinatur. Artifex igitur libri Priorum abstrahit syllogismum 
et similiter esse predicatum in propositionibus syllogisticis unde abstrahit illud 
esse ad esse per se et esse per accidens et ita concedit praedicationes accidentales. 
Unde cum sic arguatur : “ Omne aes est naturale, omnis statua est aes, ergo etc. ” 
diceret quod conclusio non est vera quamvis per accidens, numquam autem formam 
arguendi negaret », Robert Kilwardby, Expositio Egidii Romani super libros priorum

omni, même quand sa matière est sophistique. Par conséquent les Barbara 
sophistiques sont parfaitement syllogistiques et non formellement 
déﬁ cients.
Cette analyse du Barbara fallacieux n’est pas maintenue pas Robert 
Kilwardby dans le De Ortu scientiarum, et elle n’est généralement pas 
celle adoptée dans les décennies suivantes. 
6.  L’analyse des arguments matériellement et formellement éristiques 
dans le De Ortu scientiarum. 
Le De Ortu scientiarum offre d’abord une analyse de la typologie des 
arguments éristiques en fonction de la forme et de la matière qui ne permet 
pas vraiment de rendre compte du cas du «Barbara sophistique», pourtant 
mentionné. Comme dans la tradition antérieure des commentateurs tardo-
antiques, Robert Kilwardby prend comme exemple d’un raisonnement 
éristique qui pèche par la forme un raisonnement qui suit une combinaison 
inutile – il est en effet dans la première ﬁ gure avec une prémisse en A et 
l’autre en E, avec une conclusion en E, qui part de prémisses vraies pour 
aboutir à une conclusion fausse. Il prend comme exemple de syllogisme qui 
pèche par la matière un argument qui suit une combinaison syllogistique 
dont la majeure est apparemment admise. Comme exemple d’argument 
à la fois matériellement et formellement éristique, il choisit un argument 
qui suit la même combinaison inutile que la première fois mais dont une 
prémisse est fausse22. 
22 « Et iste [i. e. le syllogisme éristique] revera multis modis est. Aut enim 
non facit quod deberet. Ille autem facit quod non deberet introducit propositionem 
vel conclusionem falsam ad faciendum habitum falsum, quod non deberet facere 
ratiocinatio. Et iste est tribus modis, secundum Aristotelem in I Topicorum, quia aut 
peccat in forma tantum, scilicet quando consequentia non tenet, ut : omnis homo est 
animal, asinus non est homo, ergo non est animal ; aut in materia tantum, scilicet 
quando consequantia bona est sed aliqua praemissarum est falsa et improbabilis, quae 
tamen apparet probabilis, ut : omnis statua est naturalis, ﬁ gura Herculis est statua, 
ergo est naturalis – prima quae est falsa et improbabilis potest apparere per fallaciam 
accidentis sic : omnis statua est aes, et omne aes est naturale, ergo omnis statua est 
naturalis – aut peccat in materia et in forma, ut : omnis homo est animal, risibile non 
est homo, ergo non est animal. Minor est falsa et improbabilis. Potest tamen videri 
alicui probabilis per fallaciam accidentis sic : nullum proprium est homo, risibile est 
proprium, ergo non est homo […] », De Ortu scientiarum, p. 174.

JULIE BRUMBERG-CHAUMONT
Robert Kilwardby nous dit ensuite que les treize fallacies, qu’elles 
soient in dictione ou extra dictionem, pèchent par la forme23, ce qui 
n’est guère cohérent avec les propos précédents, puis conclut de manière 
exagérément optimiste en afﬁ rmant qu’il s’est sufﬁ samment expliqué sur 
les arguments qui pèchent par la forme ou la matière. 
Il ne nous dit donc pas comment analyser le « Barbara sophistique » 
du point de vue du couple matière forme. Or c’est un point crucial pour un 
auteur qui considère que la forme du syllogisme simpliciter réside dans la 
combinaison utile, tandis que sa matière est constituée par les propositions 
formées de lettres. 
La réponse arrive beaucoup plus loin. Il s’agit alors d’expliquer 
pourquoi, même si le syllogisme dialectique et le syllogisme sophistique 
relèvent de la même science et du même traité, la dialectique et les Topiques, 
il a fallu traiter spéciﬁ quement du syllogisme éristique. Une raison est 
que le syllogisme éristique se produit de manières plus nombreuses que 
le raisonnement qui suit une combinaison inutile, qui pèche par la forme, 
ou que le pseudépigraphème, le paralogisme scientiﬁ que qui pèche par 
la matière. C’est que le syllogisme éristique pèche à la fois par la forme 
et par la matière et qu’il pèche par la forme de deux façons, soit qu’il 
est en conformité (modiﬁ catio) seulement vocale et non réelle avec le 
syllogisme, comme c’est le cas de la fallacie de l’accident, soit qu’il suit 
une combinaison inutile24. L’exemple n’est plus le Barbara fallacieux à 
propos de la statue, mais un « Darii fallacieux » à propos des bains : 
Le paralogisme scientiﬁ que ne pèche que par la matière et la 
combinaison inutile que par la forme. Mais l’argument éristique est 
dit tel parfois parce qu’il ne fait pas ce qu’il est censé faire, parfois 
parce qu’il fait ce qu’il n’est pas censé faire, et il pèche soit par la 
forme, soit par la matière, soit par les deux. Parmi ceux qui pèchent par 
23 « De his modis in Elenchi agitur, quia de eo qui peccat in forma in illa parte ubi 
agitur de locis sophisticis in dictione et extra dictionem, ibi enim agitur de apparenti 
syllogismo, et hic est qui peccat in forma […] », De Ortu scientiarum, p. 174. 
24 La notion de modiﬁ catio désigne ici la disposition syllogistique en général ; 
c’est une notion technique propre à la tradition latine des Réfutations sophistiques, où 
asyllogizatoi est traduit une fois par immodiﬁ cati (voir SE 168a21, Aristoteles Latinus 
6:1-3, 15). Il s’agit d’un passage, au début du chapitre 6 à propos de la réduction de tous 
les paralogismes à l’ignorance de la réfuation, où Aristote enjoint de d’abord vériﬁ er 
si les arguments ne sont pas assyllogizatoi, c’est-à-dire, non concluant nécessairement, 
puis de vériﬁ er s’ils respectent la déﬁ nition du syllogisme. 

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
109
la forme, certains sont dépourvus de conformité syllogistique réelle, 
mais non vocale, d’autres de conformité à la fois réelle et vocale. Dans 
l’exemple : « Toute eau est naturelle, quelque bain est d’eau, donc 
quelque bain est naturel », il n’y a pas de défaut dans le mode vocal, 
mais seulement dans le mode réel. Mais si l’on dit : « Toute eau est 
naturelle, aucune sécheresse n’est de l’eau, donc aucune sécheresse 
n’est naturelle », l’argument pèche également quant à la conformité 
vocale puisque la mineure est négative dans la première ﬁ gure25.  
Le Darii fallacieux appartient aux arguments formellement éristiques, 
comme c’est le cas, nous l’avons vu, de toutes les fallacies, qu’elles 
soient in dictione ou extra dictionem. Mais il possède tout de même une 
conformité (modiﬁ catio) syllogistique sur un plan vocal. Il y aurait donc 
une clause supplémentaire sur le mode réel, et pas seulement vocal, pour 
la démarcation des syllogismes, clause qui est absolument nécessaire pour 
pouvoir rendre compte des fallacies qui suivent une combinaison utile 
tout en péchant par la forme. Mais comment est-elle compatible avec ce 
qui a été dit précédemment de la forme et de la matière du syllogisme 
simpliciter, où la signiﬁ cation des termes, pourtant nécessaire pour pouvoir 
juger de l’existence d’une disposition réelle et pas seulement vocale, ne 
doit pas être prise en compte ? Une doctrine comparable, quoiqu’exprimée 
de manière plus tranchée, apparaît dans le commentaire aux Réfutations 
sophistiques attribué à Robert Kilwardby. 
7.  Le commentaire aux Réfutations sophistiques attribué à Robert 
Kilwardby
Ce commentaire utilise la même solution que celle mise en œuvre dans 
le De Ortu scientiarum, c’est-à-dire la distinction entre la conformité réelle 
25 « Paralogismum enim disciplinae tantum in materia peccat ; inutilis coniugatio 
tantum in forma ; sed litigiosus aliquando dicitur quia non facit quod deberet, aliquando 
quando facit quod non deberet, et iste peccat tum in materia tum in forma tum utraque. 
Et qui peccat in forma aliquando caret modo syllogistico reali tantum, aliquando 
vocali et reali, verbi gratia : omnis aqua est naturalis, sed aliquod balneum est aqua, 
ergo est naturale. Hic nullus est defectus in  modiﬁ catione vocali sed reali tantum. Sed 
si sic dicatur : omnis aqua est naturalis, nulla siccitas est aqua, ergo nulla siccitas est 
naturalis, peccatum est etiam in modo vocali, quia minor est negativa in prima ﬁ gura », 
De Ortu scientiarum, pp. 189-190.

et vocale. L’auteur26 considère en effet que toutes les fallacies pèchent contre 
la forme du syllogisme. Il prend comme exemple la fallacie de l’accident, 
laquelle suit une combinaison utile selon les Premiers analytiques. Il faut 
donc trouver une solution. Celle-ci apparaît au cours de la réponse à un 
certains nombres de dubitationes dans le prologue.
L’auteur s’interroge sur la possibilité d’une science du syllogisme 
sophistique et s’il s’agit de la logique. Un argument contra consiste à dire 
que la logique s’occupe du syllogisme et de ses parties et que le syllogisme 
sophistique n’est ni une partie de syllogisme ni un syllogisme. L’auteur 
y répond et défend un sens dans lequel le syllogisme sophistique est un 
syllogisme, de sorte qu’il entre dans l’objet de la logique, et un sens en 
lequel il pèche par la forme et n’est pas un syllogisme. Le premier sens se 
rapproche de la description du syllogisme simpliciter du commentaire aux 
Premiers analytiques, puisque l’argument formellement éristique suivant 
une combinaison syllogistique possède les propositions et les termes en 
tant que propositions et termes à titre de matière, et le premier mode de la 
première ﬁ gure à titre de forme. En revanche, il n’est pas un syllogisme si 
le mode réel est pris en compte :
Il faut dire que le syllogisme sophistique est un syllogisme, ce qui 
peut se comprendre de la façon suivante : parmi les syllogismes, 
certains pèchent par la matière, d’autres par la forme, et d’autres 
26 Pour l’attribution du commentaire contenu dans le ms. Paris, BnF, lat. 16619 à 
Robert Kilwardby voir O. LEWRY (« Robertus Anglicus and the Italian Kilwardby », in 
A. MAIERÙ (éd.), English Logic in Italy in the 14th and the 15th Centuries, Bibliopolis, 
Napoli 1982, pp. 33-52, p. 38), qui utilise des arguments philosophiques, stylistiques 
et doctrinaux. Nous ne pouvons discuter ici dans les détails la question de l’attribution, 
mais nous sommes réservés sur les arguments doctrinaux dans la mesure où le 
prologue contient des éléments de doctrines dissonant par rapport à ceux contenus 
dans le commentaire aux Premiers analytiques et au De Ortu scientiarum. Il s’agit 
en particulier de l’idée que les syllogismes dialectiques scientiﬁ ques et sophistiques 
ne sont pas des variations matérielles du syllogisme simpliciter et de la thèse selon 
laquelle ils en sont des espèces (différant formellement) destinées à être prise en 
charge dans des traités distincts (ce qui va exactement à l’encontre de ce que dit le 
De Ortu scientiarum). Il y a d’autres dissonances. Une hypothèse toujours ouverte est 
qu’il pourrait s’agir d’un commentaire « patchwork », comme c’est le cas d’un autre 
manuscrit contenant des commentaires de Robert Kilwarby, le ms. Oxford, Bodleian 
Canonici misc. 403, et que le prologue viendrait d’un autre texte. L’auteur en serait un 
auteur fortement inﬂ uencé par Robert Kilwardby, avec des positions divergentes sur 
certains points.

encore par les deux. Le syllogisme qui pèche par la matière est un 
syllogisme, comme l’afﬁ rme clairement Aristote dans plusieurs 
passages. Mais le syllogisme qui pèche par la forme comme «Toute 
eau est naturelle, le bain est d’eau, donc le bain est naturel», est bien 
un syllogisme car on retrouve d’une certaine manière en lui toute la 
nature du syllogisme. Il possède en effet la matière requise pour un 
syllogisme, trois termes et deux propositions et il possède aussi la 
forme : il est en effet dans la première ﬁ gure. En lui les trois termes 
sont en effet disposés de telle sorte que le premier inhère dans tout le 
moyen terme et le moyen terme dans tout le troisième, et quand il en 
est ainsi, on est dans la première ﬁ gure comme le dit  Aristote dans 
les Premiers analytiques. On est en outre dans le premier mode : 
les prémisses sont en effet afﬁ rmatives universelles et la conclusion 
universelle afﬁ rmative. Il n’en demeure pas moins que la conformité 
syllogistique est double, vocale ou réelle. La conformité vocale 
s’observe ici, de sorte qu’il y a bien une combinaison syllogistique 
en ce qui concerne le son vocal, je veux dire dans le syllogisme qui 
pèche par la forme. Il appert donc que le syllogisme sophistique est 
une espèce du syllogisme, et qu’ainsi l’objection précédente n’a plus 
d’objet. Quand Aristote dit ensuite que le syllogisme sophistique 
n’est pas un syllogisme, il veut dire que ce n’est pas un syllogisme 
dont la combinaison existe sur un mode réel27. 
La même solution apparaît plus loin, à propos de la distinction des 
genres d’argumentations dans les Réfutations sophistiques, laquelle 
27 « Dicendum quod syllogismus sophisticum sillogismus est et hoc habet sic intelligi : 
Sillogismis sophisticis quidam peccat in materia, quidam in forma, quidam in utrumque. 
Sillogismus peccans in materia est sillogismus, sicut plane vult Aristoteles in pluribus locis. 
Sillogismus autem peccans in forma ut iste “omis aqua est naturalis, balneum est aqua, 
ergo balneum est naturale” sillogismus est, quia in eo tota natura sillogismi quodammodo 
reperitur. Habet enim materiam sillogismo debitam ut tres terminos et duas propositiones, 
similiter autem et formam. Habet enim primam ﬁ guram. Hic enim disponuntur tres terminos 
ita quod primum inest omni medio et medium omni <tertio>, et quando ita est, tunc est 
prima ﬁ gura, ut dicit Aristoteles in libro Priorum. Est etiam ibi modus prime ﬁ gure. Sunt 
enim premisse universales afﬁ rmative et conclusio universalis afﬁ rmativa.Verumptamen 
modus in sillogismo duplex est, scilicet vocalis et realis. Vocalis autem hic reperitur 
unde tota complexio sillogismi quantum est ex parte vocis – dico <tum> in sillogismo 
peccante in forma. Patet ergo quod sillogismus sophisticus species est sillogismi et ita perit 
oppositio prius facta. Cum enim dicit Aristoteles inferius quod sillogismus sophisticus non 
est sillogismus ipse intendit quod non est sillogismus cuius complexio est modus realis»,

inclut les syllogismes éristiques. L’auteur précise qu’il semble y avoir 
une contradiction puisque, d’un côté, le syllogisme éristique n’est pas 
un syllogisme, étant un syllogisme apparent, mais, d’un autre côté, il 
appartient aux argumentations, et doit être un syllogisme, puisqu’il n’est 
ni une induction, ni un enthymème, ni un exemple. La réponse consiste 
à dire que le syllogisme est double et que le syllogisme éristique est un 
syllogisme du point de vue de la réalisation vocale, mais pas du point de 
vue de la réalisation réelle28. 
L’auteur du commentaire maintient les fallacies qui suivent une 
combinaison utile au sein des syllogismes en s’appuyant sur une conception 
syntactique de la forme syllogistique dans laquelle les parties matérielles sont 
les termes concrets eux-mêmes pris en tant que termes, indépendamment 
de leur signiﬁ cation, comme de simples séquence sonores qui n’exigent 
que le respect de la substitution uniforme vocale. Le double syllogisme 
n’est plus le syllogisme simpliciter et probans, mais le syllogisme réalisé 
vocalement ou réellement. Il donne ainsi un sens très affaibli à l’afﬁ rmation 
d’Aristote selon laquelle les arguments formellement sophistiques sont 
des syllogismes apparents : ce n’est pas qu’ils sont apparemment des 
syllogismes sans en être, mais ils sont réellement des syllogismes dans 
la mesure seulement où ils en ont l’apparence sonore ou visuelle. Il ne 
nous dit pas en outre clairement ce qu’est une conformité réelle : est-
il exigé, par exemple, dans un syllogisme en Barbara, que le prédicat 
se dise de tout le sujet avec vérité, ou que la prédication soit seulement 
uniforme des prémisses à la conclusion, quelle que soit la valeur de vérité 
des propositions ? Enﬁ n la question demeure de savoir si les arguments 
formellement éristiques possédant une combinaison syllogistique sur un 
plan purement vocal sont des syllogismes simpliciter ou non. 
L’auteur ne se prononce pas directement sur cette dernière question. 
Il semble entretenir une conception du syllogisme simpliciter assez 
profondément différente de celle qu’on a pu lire dans le commentaire aux 
Premiers analytiques de Robert Kilwardby. Il dit en effet explicitement que 
les différences qui s’ajoutent au syllogisme simpliciter pour constituer les 
28 « Sillogismus enim duplex est secundum duplicem eius perfectionem. Habet 
enim perfectionem in modo duplicem scilicet vocalem et realem. Unde sillogismus 
apparens et non existens non est sillogismus quoad ad perfectionem realem et est 
existens sillogismus quantum ad perfectionem vocalem », Liber Elenchorum, ms. 
Paris, BnF, lat. 16619, f. 3va12-16.

 
LA FORME SYLLOGISTIQUE ET LE PROBLÈME DES SYLLOGISMES 
113
syllogismes dialectiques, scientiﬁ ques et sophistiques sont des différences 
diviseuses formelles à l’égard de celui-ci, et des différences constitutives 
matérielles des trois syllogismes, qui les différencient entre eux. Elles 
ne sont donc pas des différences matérielles du syllogisme simpliciter, 
thèse qui est considérées comme la «marque de fabrique» d’une théorie 
proprement kilwarbienne29. 
Cet usage assez peu orthodoxe des notions de différences constitutives 
et diviseuses pourrait peut-être s’expliquer de la façon suivante : en se 
voyant adjoindre les déterminations ‘sophistiques’, ‘dialectique’ et 
‘scientiﬁ que’ le syllogisme simpliciter devient autre substantiellement, 
i.e. il cesse d’être, précisément, simpliciter. En revanche les différences 
‘sophistiques’, ‘dialectique’ et ‘scientiﬁ que’ ne différencient les trois 
syllogismes que matériellement puisqu’ils ont une forme commune. Ceci 
ne peut avoir de sens que si le syllogisme simpliciter n’est considéré que 
comme la forme commune que les syllogismes concrets partagent, à l’instar 
du genre qui ne subsiste pas en dehors de ses espèces, et non comme une 
réalité logique auto-subsistante à part des syllogismes concrets eux-mêmes, 
tel qu’observé dans le commentaire de Robert Kilwardby aux Premiers 
analytiques. Il n’est d’ailleurs plus question dans notre commentaire des 
« lettres » comme matière transcendante du syllogisme simpliciter. 
29 « Sed tunc queritur cuiusmodi differentie sunt differentie predicte, scilicet 
necessarium, probabile et sophisticum. Et videtur quod sint differentie materiales 
silligismi. Per hec enim dividitur sillogismus penes materiam propositionum que sunt 
eius principia materialia. Quod autem sint formales, videtur sic. Illa que diversiﬁ cant 
speciem in tractatibus separatis habent determinari ; que autem non diversiﬁ cant 
speciem sed solum materiam debent determinari in eodem tractatu. Unde si ista essent 
materialia respectu sillogismi, in eodem tractatu determinasset Aristoteles de hiis. Nunc 
autem de hiis in diversis tractatibus determinat, et ideo videtur quod sint differentie 
formales. Et dicendum quod possumus istas differentias considerare dupliciter, aut in 
se, et sic sunt quedam forme, vel in comparatione ad sillogismum, et sic dupliciter : aut 
enim in comparatione ad sillogismum simpliciter, et sic sunt differentie formales. Cum 
enim adveniunt ad sillogismum simpliciter, ipsum informant. Vel possunt comparari 
ad silllogismos per eas constitutos, et sic sunt materiales. Faciunt enim diversitatem 
materialem diversitatem <esse> istorum trium sillogismorum ad invicem : probabilis 
scilicet, necessarii et apparentis », Liber Elenchorum, ms. Paris, BnF, lat. 16619, f.

Conclusion
Les difﬁ cultés posées par l’héritage kilwardbien sont diversement 
reçues. Une option, explorée dans la génération suivante, a consisté à 
réviser la description initiale de la matière et de la forme du syllogisme 
simpliciter en y ajoutant des clauses supplémentaires portant sur la manière 
dont les termes concrets doivent remplacer les lettres des syllogismes 
simpliciter. C’est ce qu’on observe dans le premier commentaire aux 
Réfutations sophistiques édité par Sten Ebbesen en 1977, daté des années 
127030. Les clauses sont, pour les termes, l’unité de signiﬁ cations, et pour 
les propositions dans leur ensemble, l’uniformité de prédication, de sorte 
que les arguments formellement déﬁ cients qui suivent vocalement une 
combinaison utile ne sont pas des syllogismes simpliciter. La discussion 
menée dans ce commentaire met particulièrement bien en relief la difﬁ cile 
question du statut théorique des «lettres» comme matière, question qui 
n’avait pas été abordée par Robert Kilwardby. N’étant pas des variables 
mises pour des items, mais des «lettres d’attente» (dummy letters), c’est-
à-dire des termes, dotés d’un contenu sémantique, quoique général, elles 
sont à l’interface de la forme et de la matière. L’anonyme précise en effet 
qu’elles appartiennent à la forme du syllogisme simpliciter, pour laquelle 
le seul respect du mode et de la ﬁ gure ne saurait sufﬁ re, tout en relevant 
de la dimension matérielle de celle-ci. On peut considérer les clauses sur 
l’unité et la conformité venues enrichir la conception kilwardbienne du 
syllogisme simpliciter comme une tentative, précisément, pour délimiter 
le contenu sémantique des termes transcendants. Il reste bien général, 
puisqu’indifférent à telle ou telle signiﬁ cation individuelle. Mais il va au-
delà d’une simple stipulation préalable sur la nature des termes concrets 
substituables – par exemple : « pas de termes équivoques » – qui s’en 
tiendrait au plan d’une sémantique formelle, sans pouvoir prendre en 
charge l’éventail des ambiguïtés et des variations sémantiques intra-
argumentatives préjudiciables à la validité de l’inférence syllogistique, 
telle que, précisément, la fallacie de l’accident31.

31 Ockham emploie cette méthode qui consiste à exclure certains types de termes 
dans la déﬁ nition du syllogisme, méthode qui ne peut fonctionner pour des cas très 
complexes comme celui du Barbara sophistique dans le paralogisme de l’accident.

Il s’est sans doute trouvé à l’époque des commentaires logiques 
de Robert Kilwardby des maîtres qui, ﬁ dèles à la fois à la conception 
kilwardbienne du syllogisme simpliciter et à la distinction entre conformité 
et réalisation vocale et réelle, ont dû déﬁ nir le syllogisme simpliciter 
uniquement sur un plan vocal, pour pouvoir soutenir que les fallacies 
formellement déﬁ cientes qui suivaient une combinaison utiles étaient tout 
de même des syllogismes en tant que syllogisme simpliciter. C’est en effet 
une position qui est attestée dans les commentaires aux Topiques du groupe 
« parisien » (auquel aurait appartenu Albert le Grand) de l’époque, édités 
partiellement par Green-Pedersen, position qui y est mentionnée pour 
y être critiquée. C’est aussi le point de départ de la discussion d’Albert 
le Grand dans son commentaire aux Réfutations sophistiques, dont la 
position renverse la proposition kilwardbienne. Elle fait en effet clairement 
l’équivalence entre matière vocale et matière apparente. Ce n’est pas que 
les arguments sophistiques ont réellement l’apparence de syllogismes : 
ce n’est que’apparemment qu’ils sont des syllogismes, en vertu d’une 
disposition syllogistique apparente, vocale. Il en résulte que toutes les 
fallacies formellement déﬁ cientes, même quand elles ont l’air d’être 
Mais ce n’est pas un problème pour Ockham puisqu’il considère, contre certains 
logiciens (en fait tous ceux des générations précédentes) que ce types d’arguments 
sont des syllogismes du premier mode de la première ﬁ gure parfaitement acceptables : 
« quattuor modi primae ﬁ gurae tenent in omnibus terminis, nec refert utrum sumatur 
sub terminus substantialis vel accidentalis, quale quid vel hoc aliquid, sive quantum, 
sive aliquid […] dummodo per primam propositionem denotetur praedicatum vere dici 
vel removeri ab omni illo de quo dicitur subiectum et per secundam propositionem 
denotetur illud quod prius fuit subiectum non aequivoce acceptum dici de assumpto, 
et postea in conclusione illud qui fuit praedicatum in prima dici vel removeri de illo 
praecise quod fuit subiectum in secunda propositione. Ex isto sequitur quod tales 
syllogismi sunt boni ‘omne coloratum est, omne album est coloratum, ergo omne 
album est’; ‘omne animal est homo, omnis asinus est animal, omnis asinus est homo”; 
Et ideo errat Magister Abstractionum assignando praedictis syllogismis fallaciam 
accidentis cum isti syllogismi regulentur per dici de omni et sint evidentes. Similiter 
tales syllogismi sunt boni nisi aequivocatio impediat ‘omnis homo continetur in genere 
substantiae, album est homo, igitur album continetur in genere substantiae’ […] et 
ceteri huiusmodi, in quibus volunt aliqui moderni assignare fallaciam accidentis, 
nescientes naturam syllogismi nec fallaciam accidentis. Advertendum est tamen quod 
numquam syllogismus est regulatus per dici de omni vel per dici de nullo quando 
aliquis terminus aequivocus sumitur », Somme de Logique III/1 (traité du syllogisme),

THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE?
1. Introduction
According to what can be described as the classical, ‘textbook’ account 
of logic, the quintessential objects of logical investigation are the forms of 
arguments, which are typically understood as corresponding to argument 
schemata. Here is a passage which nicely illustrates the general idea:
We say that (1), (7) and (8) [examples of arguments previously 
given] have a particular form in common, and that it is this form 
which is responsible for their validity. This common form may be 
represented schematically like this:
A or B
Not A
--------
   B
These schematic representations are called argument schemata. 
The letters A and B stand for arbitrary sentences. Filling in actual 
sentences for them, we obtain an actual argument. Any such 
substitution into schema (11) results in a valid argument, which is 
why (11) is said to be a valid argument schema1.
A little further:
Logic, as the science of reasoning, investigates the validity of 
arguments by investigating the validity of schemata. For argument 
schemata are abstractions which remove all those elements of 
concrete arguments which have no bearing on their validity2.

(In this passage, schematic letters take the place of sentences, but they 
can of course also take the place of terms, such as in «Every A is B, and 
every B is C. So Every A is C.») Elsewhere3, I have referred to this view 
as the ideology of ‘logical hylomorphism as we know it’ (LHAWKI), and 
argued that it is a dogmatic and essentially misguided conception of the 
nature of logic. One of my strategies to criticize LHAWKI was to engage 
in a project of ‘conceptual genealogy’4 so as to unveil the substantive and 
often contentious assumptions made along the way in the history of logic, 
leading to the establishment of LHAWKI as the received view about logic. 
Clearly, against this background, investigating the historical paths leading 
to the association of the form of an argument to a schema is of the utmost 
relevance, and this will be the topic of this paper.
In the ﬁ rst half of the paper, I review a speciﬁ c chapter in these 
developments: the transformation from ﬁ gure to mood as that which is 
viewed as corresponding to the form of a syllogism. I start with the absence 
of hylomorphic concepts in Aristotle’s logical texts, and then discuss the ﬁ rst 
applications of hylomorphism to arguments with the ancient commentators, 
the equivocal understanding of the form of a syllogism (between ﬁ gure and 
mood) in Latin medieval authors of the 12th and 13th centuries, and the 
establishment of a schematic understanding of the form of arguments in 
general, as exempliﬁ ed by Buridan’s treatise on consequence, in the 14th 
century5. However, in the second half of the paper, I also show that, in the 
same treatise, Buridan himself makes extensive use of syllogistic ﬁ gures 
for logical theorizing, in particular in the fourth book dedicated to modal 
syllogistic. Hence, contrary to what the textbook passage above seems to 
suggest, investigating schemata is certainly not the only way to study the 
validity of arguments in a systematic way: in the particular case of modal 
syllogistic, ﬁ gures offer a very convenient vantage point, for reasons to be 
explained in due course.

THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE? 
119
The upshot is thus that the LHAWKI ideology is mistaken in 
circumscribing logic to the study of schemata. In turn, this suggests that the 
widely endorsed, quasi-metaphysical view that the form of an argument 
simply is the underlying schema is not nearly as straightforward as it 
might be thought; in certain cases, other aspects of arguments seem to be 
equally qualiﬁ ed to play the role of ‘forms’ and be the object of logical 
investigation – syllogistic ﬁ gures in particular6.
2. From ﬁ gure to mood
As is well known, the father of logic and the father of hylomorphism 
is not the father of logical hylomorphism. Nowhere in his logical writings 
does Aristotle apply the form-matter distinction to logical objects such as 
arguments. True enough, the theory of syllogistic presented in the Prior 
Analytics presupposes something like a schematic understanding of 
arguments, in particular for Aristotle’s method of proving the invalidity 
of a syllogistic mood by providing a counterexample: a ‘model’ in which 
the premises are true and so is the contradictory of the putative conclusion. 
However, the only reference to something like the form or matter of an 
argument, and an oblique one at that, is to be found in the Physics and in 
an almost identical passage in the Metaphysics, where he seems to suggest 
that the premises are the material cause of the conclusion.
Some centuries later, however, the ancient commentators such as 
Alexander of Aphrodisias, Ammonius, Simplicius and others, made 
extensive use of the hylomorphic framework in their commentaries on the 
Prior Analytics7. The earliest such applications that we are aware of are 
those in Alexander’s commentary on the Prior Analytics:
6 Following Corcoran («Schema», in E. ZALTA (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia 
of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schema/, 2012), on the present 
understanding of ‘schema’, a syllogistic mood counts as a schema, but not a syllogistic 
ﬁ gure. In personal communication, John MacFarlane points out that, on a broader 
understanding of schemata, syllogistic ﬁ gures may also count as schemata.
7 Barnes offers an extensive overview of applications of hylomorphism to logic 
in the tradition of the ancient commentators, see J. BARNES, «Logical Form and 
Logical Matter», in A. ALBERTI (ed.), Logica, Mente e Persona, Olschki, Firenze 1990, 
pp. 1-119; J. BARNES, Truth etc., Oxford University Press, Oxford 2007, chap. 4.

120 
CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
The [syllogistic] ﬁ gures are like a sort of common matrix: by ﬁ tting 
matter into them, it is possible to mould the same form in different 
sorts of matters. For just as things ﬁ tted into one and the same 
matrix differ not in form and ﬁ gure but in matter, so it is with the 
syllogistic ﬁ gures8.
For our purposes, it is crucial to notice that Alexander seems to view 
the form of a syllogism as corresponding to its ﬁ gure, not its mood. In 
the same text, he seems to suggest that the form of a valid syllogism is 
somehow related to its validity and reliability:
Combinations are called syllogistic and reliable if they do not alter 
together with differences in the matter –i.e. if they do not deduce 
and prove different things at different times, but always and in every 
material instance preserve one and the same form in the conclusion. 
Combinations which change and alter conﬁ guration together with 
the matter and acquire different and conﬂ icting conclusions at 
different times, are non-syllogistic and unreliable9.
The last remark can be read as suggesting that something like the mood 
of a syllogism is what corresponds to its form, as within each ﬁ gure there 
are valid as well as invalid moods. But generally speaking, the ancient 
commentators tended to associate the form of a syllogism to its ﬁ gure, at 
least in their explicit statements on the matter.
In early Latin medieval texts, references to the form and matter of 
syllogisms or arguments all but disappear completely, arguably due to the 
fact that Boethius does not make systematic use the hylomorphic framework 
in his writings on syllogistic10. Nevertheless, some of the gist of the logical 
hylomorphism of the ancient commentators is present in Boethius, for 
example in the distinction between propositionum complexio and rerum 
natura (e.g. HS II ii 5)11. Picking up from Boethius, Abelard’s distinction

between perfect and imperfect inferences in the Dialectica is very much 
in the spirit of the logical hylomorphism of the ancient commentators, but 
with no use of speciﬁ c hylomorphic terminology.
In contrast, in the only currently known commentary on the Prior 
Analytics from the 12th century, the so-called Anonymus Aurelianensis III 
(henceforth, AA III), the form-matter distinction is extensively applied to 
syllogisms, apparently under direct Greek inﬂ uence (as argued by Ebbesen 
and Thomsen Thörnqvist)12. But AA III adds a crucial element, which 
apparently is not to be found in the ancient commentaries: an equivocal 
(‘duplex’) understanding of the form and matter of syllogisms.
The form of a syllogism is understood equivocally, i.e. as the 
disposition of terms which is called its ﬁ gure, and the disposition 
of sentences, called its mood, and in both cases it is unique to each 
syllogistic type13.
Just as the form of a syllogism is equivocal, so is its matter, i.e. 
terms and sentences14.
Similar suggestions are found in the early 13th century anonymous 
treatise known as Dialectica Monacensis, and in Robert Kilwardby’s 
commentary on the Prior Analytics, dated circa 1230:
It must be noted that every totality is constituted of form and 
matter. As a syllogism is such a totality, it too must be constituted 
of form and matter. The matter of a syllogism is equivocal, namely 
proximate or remote. The remote matter are the three terms: such a 
trio of terms constitutes every syllogism, and it is impossible that it

(Presumably) Earliest Extant Latin Commentary on the Prior Analytics, and its 
Greek Model», Cahiers de l’Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin, 37 (1981) 1-20;

13 «Forma autem syllogismi duplex est, sc. dispositio terminorum quae ﬁ gura 
vocatur, et dispositio propositionum, quae dicitur modus, et utraque unica est ad omnia 
genera syllogismorum.» (EBBESEN, «Analysing Syllogisms», p. 14) The translations 
from Latin are my own, unless otherwise stated.
14 «Sicut autem forma syllogismorum est duplex, ita est materia duplex, scilicet 
termini et propositiones.» (EBBESEN, «Analysing Syllogisms», p. 15).

CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
be composed of more or fewer [terms]. The proximate matter are the 
three sentences. And just as matter is equivocal, so is the form [of a 
syllogism]. The terms must have a ﬁ gure, and it is the arrangement 
of the trio of terms which is produced by subjecting and predicating. 
And since three terms can only receive three arrangements in 
subjecting and predicating, and there are two premises, we can only 
have three ﬁ gures. Similarly, from the sentences comes the mood, 
namely quality and quantity, and this makes a syllogism. The mood 
is thus the disposition of the trio of sentences which pertains to 
quality and quantity15.
And thus we see in a syllogism an order in matter and form. For 
matter, as the term is its remote and unarranged matter, the sentence 
is truly its proximate and arranged matter. For form, as the ﬁ gure is 
the incomplete form in potentiality towards future forms, the mood 
is thus the ultimate, completing form of a syllogism16. 
In other words, according to these texts, there are two ways in which 
the form of a syllogism can be understood, just as there are two ways in 
which the matter of a syllogism can be understood: the form of a syllogism 
can be either its ﬁ gure or its mood, and correspondingly its matter can be

sillogismus sit quoddam totum, necesse est ipsum constare ex materia et forma. 
Materia autem sillogismi duplex est, scilicet propinqua et remota. Remota materia 
sunt tres termini: ex tribus enim terminis constat omnis sillogismus et impossibile

sunt. Duplici autem materie debetur duplex forma. Terminis enim ﬁ gura debetur. Et

Et quoniam tres termini non possunt recipere nisi triplicem ordinationem in

quia terminus est materia eius remota et indisposita, propositio vero est materia 
propinqua et disposita; in formis etiam quia ﬁ gura est forma incompleta et in potentia 
ad ulteriorem formam. Modus autem est forma ultima syllogismi completiva.» (quoted

2007, p. 57).

 
THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE?

either its terms or its sentences. According to the Dialectica Monacensis 
and Kilwardby, but not AA III, this follows from the fact that matter can be 
understood in two speciﬁ c ways, namely either as remote or as proximate. 
Kilwardby adds that the mood of a syllogism is its ultimate, completing 
form, while its ﬁ gure is its form in potentiality; this observation clearly 
anticipates the later prevalence of the schematic understanding of the form 
of arguments (schematic in the sense of viewing the form of an argument 
as corresponding to a schema).
It is not clear where this equivocal understanding of the form and 
matter of syllogisms is coming from. As we have seen, there is some 
ambiguity in how the ancient commentators talk about the form of a 
syllogism: they usually say explicitly that it corresponds to its ﬁ gure, 
but some of their observations also suggest that the mood of a syllogism 
might also be viewed as its form. Moreover, it all seems to indicate that 
the equivocal understanding is not to be traced back to Greek sources, thus 
it might well be an independent innovation. Indeed, to my knowledge, the 
distinction between materia propinqua and materia remota is common in 
Latin texts but is not to be found in Greek texts. At any rate, the equivocal 
understanding of the form and matter of syllogisms seems to have been a 
fairly widespread doctrine by the ﬁ rst half of the 13th century already, as 
attested by its presence in these texts. 
Regrettably, though, as long as we do not have a better grasp of 
the historical origins of the equivocal understanding of the form of a 
syllogism, we are missing an important piece of the puzzle. From the point 
of view of the project of ‘conceptual genealogy’ previously mentioned, 
the equivocal understanding of the form (and matter) of a syllogism is 
absolutely crucial: it represents the transition from the early non-schematic 
logical hylomorphism of the ancient commentators to the later schematic 
understanding of the form of arguments, syllogisms in particular.
By the end of the 13th century, the concepts of form and matter were 
being applied to arguments/consequences more generally, not only to 
syllogistic arguments, as can be seen in an illustrative passage by Simon 
of Faversham:
When it is said that «an animal is a substance; therefore a man is 
a substance is a good consequence» I reply that this consequence 
does not hold in virtue of form (ratione formae), but rather in virtue 
of matter. Because according to the Commentator on the ﬁ rst book 
of the Physics, an argument which is valid (concludens) in virtue of 

124 
CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
form must hold in all matter. This consequence, however, holds only 
for features which are essential […] and so this consequence is not 
formal (formalis)17.
It may well be that the gradual disappearance of the idea that the form 
of a syllogism corresponds to its ﬁ gure is related to the fact that, once the 
notions of form and matter are generalized to other kinds of arguments/
consequences, there is no obvious counterpart to ﬁ gures in non-syllogistic 
arguments. A syllogistic mood, by contrast, is simply a schema, a notion 
which can be generalized to arguments of all kinds18. In this sense, the 
gradual transition in the 13th century from the primacy of syllogistic 
arguments towards a more general conception of arguments, culminating 
in 14th century theories of consequence, may have been an important factor 
in the establishment of a schematic conception of the formal.
It is in Buridan’s treatise on consequence that one ﬁ nds the clearest 
medieval formulation of the schematic understanding of the form of an 
argument, which provides the basis for Buridan’s substitutional deﬁ nition 
of formal consequences:
A consequence is called formal if it is valid in all terms retaining a 
similar form. Or if you want to put it explicitly, a formal consequence 
is one where every proposition similar in form that might be formed 
would be a good consequence, e.g., «That which is A is B, so that 
which is B is A»19. (my emphasis)
17 «Et cum dicitur “Hic est bona consequentia: ‘animal est substantia, ergo homo 
est substantia’”, dico quod ista consequentia non tenet ratione formae, sed ratione 
materiae. Non tenet ratione formae quia secundum Commentatorem I Physicorum 
sermo concludens virtute formae debet tenere in omni materia; ista autem consequentia 
tantum tenet in essentialibus, et hoc propter identitatem naturae importatam in talibus 
per antecedens et consequens; et propter hoc consequentia ista non est formalis.»

18 Recall that, following Corcoran «Schema», for the present purposes a syllogistic 
mood counts as a schema, but not a syllogistic ﬁ gure.

propositio similis in forma quae formaretur esset bona consequentia, ut “quod est A est B; 

 
THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE? 
125
I say that when we speak of matter and form, by the matter of a 
proposition or consequence we mean the purely categorematic 
terms, namely, the subject and predicate, setting aside the 
syncategoremes atteched to them by which they are conjoined or 
denied or distributed or given a certain kind of supposition : we say 
all the rest pertains to the form20.
Thus, according to Buridan, the form of an argument is (at least 
partially) deﬁ ned by the syncategorematic terms occurring in it, while 
its matter corresponds to its categorematic terms. At ﬁ rst sight, this may 
appear to be an almost exact formulation of LHAWKI, as exempliﬁ ed 
by the textbook passage quoted above. There is however a fundamental 
difference: nowhere does Buridan say that the form of an argument 
(consequence) is that in virtue of which it is valid. He does say that formal 
consequences make their validity evident to us, but this has epistemic 
rather than logical import. Nevertheless, with Buridan we clearly no longer 
have an equivocal understanding of the form of an argument: it uniquely 
corresponds to what we now refer to as an argument schema, which in the 
case of syllogisms corresponds to syllogistic moods. 
3. Buridan on the ﬁ gures of modal syllogisms
Does this mean that Buridan does not attribute any usefulness to the 
concept of syllogistic ﬁ gure for logical theorizing? Here again the answer is 
negative. Unlike the authors of modern logical textbooks, in practice Buridan 
does not endorse the view that logic «investigates the validity of arguments 
by investigating the validity of schemata», at least not exclusively. In fact, 
the concept of syllogistic ﬁ gure plays a prominent role in particular in his 
analysis of modal syllogisms, as I will show now. The main technical reason 
ergo quod est B est A”.» (John Buridan, Tractatus de Consequentiis, Ed. by H. HUBIEN, 
Publications Universitaires, Louvain 1976, pp. 22-23, translation in John Buridan, Treatise 
on Consequences, transl. by S. READ, Fordham University Press, New York 2015, p. 68).
20 «Et dico quod in proposito, prout de materia et forma hic loquimur, per ‘materiam’ 
propositionis aut consequentiae intelligimus terminos pure categorematicos, scilicet 
subiecta et praedicata, circumscriptis syncategorematicis sibi appositis, per quae 
ipsa coniunguntur aut negantur aut distribuuntur uel ad certum modum suppositionis 
trahuntur; sed ad formam pertinere dicimus totum residuum.» (Buridan, Tractatus de 
Consequentiis, p. 30, transl. p. 74.).

126 
CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
for this is that focus on ﬁ gures allows the logician to keep track of the 
property of ampliation, which is a crucial property of modal sentences.
But before turning to modal syllogistic, the topic of the fourth book 
of Buridan’s treatise, we must attend to his deﬁ nition of the semantics 
of modal sentences as presented at the beginning of the second book, on 
consequences between modal sentences. Buridan’s understanding of the 
semantics of divided modal sentences differs from that of e.g. Ockham, 
and his results on modal syllogistic depend crucially on the exact details of 
the semantics he attributes to modal sentences. Here is what he says:
It should be realized that a divided proposition of possibility has a 
subject ampliated by the mode following it to supposit not only for 
things that exist but also for what can exist even if they do not. […] 
So the proposition ‘B can be A’ is equivalent to ‘That which is or 
can be B can be A’21.
In practice, the subject of a divided modal sentence functions for 
Buridan as a disjunctive term: for example, ‘A is necessarily B’ is equivalent 
to ‘That which is or can be A is necessarily B’.
Turning now to modal syllogisms, in the fourth book Buridan proves 
a number of general conclusions for modal syllogisms, usually resorting 
to ﬁ gures as the concept affording the suitable level of generality. True 
enough, the concept of validity remains tied to syllogistic moods, just as in 
the case of assertoric syllogisms, as Buridan himself points out:
When in the preceding conclusion I said or when I will say later, 
«is valid,», I always understand by «valid» not that it is valid in all 
combinations, but that it is valid in all moods which were claimed 
to be valid for assertorics22.
21 «[…] supponendum est quod propositio diuisa de possibili habet subiectum 
ampliatum per modum sequentem ipsum ad supponendum non solum pro his quae 
sunt sed etiam pro his quae possunt esse quamuis non sint. Unde sic est uerum quod 
aer potest ﬁ eri ex aqua, licet hoc non sit uerum de aliquo aere qui est. Et ideo haec 
propositio ‘B potest esse A’ aequiualet isti: ‘Quod est uel potest esse B potest esse A’.» 
(John Buridan, Tractatus de Consequentiis, p. 58, transl. p. 97).
22 «Et cum in dicta conclusione dixi uel dicam post ‘ualet’, semper ego per ‘ualere’ 
intelligo non quod ualeat in omnibus combinationibus sed quod ualeat in omnibus 
modis qui positi fuerunt ualere de inesse.» (John Buridan, Tractatus de Consequentiis, 
p. 115, transl. p. 143).

 
THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE? 
127
He will then investigate, for each of the syllogisms that are valid in 
the case of assertoric sentences, whether they also correspond to valid 
modal syllogisms, and of which kind. In other words: within the valid 
moods for assertoric syllogisms, which combinations of the modalities of 
necessity and possibility will also produce valid modal syllogisms? This is 
the general question. Now, rather than proceeding by an analysis of modal 
syllogistic moods, Buridan focuses on syllogistic ﬁ gures. As we shall see, 
this is a clever move, since what determines the properties of a modal 
syllogism besides its mood is the ampliation of its terms, which can be kept 
track of through its ﬁ gure, as some examples will illustrate. 
Let us start with his fourth conclusion:
Fourth Conclusion: In the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure with both [premises] of 
necessity or of possibility or one of necessity and the other of 
possibility there is always a valid syllogism to a conclusion of the 
same kind as the major [premise]23. 
These are evident by the dictum de omni et nullo. They are all perfect 
syllogisms or nearly perfect. For if the major [extreme] is explicitly 
expressed by a disjunction of the verb ‘is’ with the verb ‘can’, then 
if the minor [premise] is of possibility it will be clearly subsumed 
under the distribution of the major [extreme]; while if the minor is 
of necessity, the same is true, since that of possibility follows from 
that of necessity24.
In order to analyze this claim, let us introduce some notation to capture 
the ampliation/supposition of terms.
[ ]A : ‘A’ supposits for that which is necessarily A.
<>A : ‘A’ supposits for that which can be A.
23 «In prima ﬁ gura ualet semper syllogismus ex ambabus de necessario uel de 
possibili aut ex una de necessario et alii de possibili ad conclusionem talis modi qualis 
est maior.» (John Buridan, Tractatus de Consequentiis, p. 115, transl. p. 143).
24 «Haec sunt manifesta per dici de omni uel de nullo. Et sunt omnes syllogismi 
perfecti uel quasi perfecti. Si enim maior explicite exprimatur per disiunctionem 
huius uerbi ‘est’ ad hoc uerbum ‘potest’, tunc si minor ﬁ at de possibili erit manifesta 
sumptio sub distributione maioris; si autem minor ﬁ at de necessario, adhuc idem redit, 
quia ad illam de necessario sequitur illa de possibili.» (John Buridan, Tractatus de 
Consequentiis, p. 115, transl. p. 143).

128 
CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
*A : ‘A’ supposits for that which is A.
*<>A : ‘A’ supposits for that which is or can be A.
/ : any copula joining subject to predicate.
I will use ‘/’ to denote the copula connection, of any kind. Precisely 
because, at this point, the idea is to focus exclusively on ﬁ gures rather than 
on moods, no attention will be paid to the two kinds of copulas (afﬁ rmative 
or negative), nor to the quantity of the sentences, as these are two properties 
pertaining to mood. In other words, at this point we abstract away from 
quality and quantity, focusing exclusively on the mutual disposition of the 
terms which is what deﬁ nes the ﬁ gure of a syllogism. 
Thus, a generic modal categorical sentence of necessity is represented 
by:
*<> A/[ ]B
A modal sentence of possibility is represented by:
*<> A/<>B
A ﬁ rst-ﬁ gure syllogism with two premises of necessity becomes:
*<>A/[ ]B
*<>B/[ ]C
---------------
*<>A/[ ]C
In the conclusion, A and C simply maintain the ampliation they have 
in the premises, which can be immediately (almost graphically) perceived. 
As for the middle term B, it has different suppositions in the two premises, 
but not in a way that would block the conclusion, because the ampliation 
of B in the minor premise is subsumed under the supposition of B in the 
major premise: everything which is necessarily B is or can be B as well.
A ﬁ rst-ﬁ gure syllogism with two premises of possibility becomes:
*<>A/<>B
*<>B/<>C
---------------
*<>A/<>C

 
THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE? 
129
Here, a similar reasoning applies: the ampliation of B in the minor 
premise is subsumed under the supposition of B in the major premise, as 
what can be B a fortiori satisﬁ es the disjunctive clause of what is or can 
be B.
The mixed case follows by a similar reasoning. Let us use # and ^ to 
denote either one of the modalities; we then obtain:
*<>A/^B
*<>B/#C
---------------
*<>A/#C
As we have seen, both in the case of a minor premise of necessity and 
in the case of a minor premise of possibility, the ampliation of the minor 
middle term is subsumed under the supposition of the major middle term. 
So in the conclusion, C simply carries over the ampliation that it has in 
the major premise, which is thus determined by the modality of the major 
premise.
Let us now turn to the third ﬁ gure. Buridan states the following 
conclusion:
Sixth Conclusion: In the third ﬁ gure a conclusion of possibility 
always follows from two premises of possibility, and a conclusion of 
necessity from two [premises] of necessity, and a conclusion of the 
same kind as the major [premise] from one [premise] of necessity 
and the other of possibility25.
With two premises of possibility we have:
*<>A/ <>B
*<>A/ <>C
----------------
<>B/ <>C
25 «In tertia ﬁ gura semper ex ambabus de possibili sequitur conclusio de possibili, 
et ex ambabus de necessario sequitur conclusio de necessario, et ex una de necessario 
et altera de possibili sequitur conclusio modi similis modo maioris.» (John Buridan, 
Tractatus de Consequentiis, p. 116, transl. p. 144).

130 
CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES
Now, since clearly <>B/ <>C implies *<>B/ <>C (because the subject 
is read as a disjunctive term), we obtain:
*<>A/ <>B
*<>A/ <>C
----------------
*<>B/ <>C
For two premises of necessity, the conclusion is in ﬁ rst instance 
[  ]B/[  ]C, but this implies <>B/[  ]C, which in turn implies *<>B/[  ]C.
With mixed premises, we obtain:
*<>A/^B
*<>A/#C
---------------
^B/#C
Now, if ^ is either <> or [  ], as we have seen, in both cases it implies 
*<>B/#C, thus the conclusion is of the same modality as the major premise.
For the second ﬁ gure, the reasoning is slightly more complicated, as it 
involves indirect proofs, but the general strategy is similar.
The general idea is thus that the two terms in the conclusion carry 
over the ampliation they have in the premises to the conclusion. As for 
the middle term, some caution is required to ensure that, in the case of 
the ﬁ rst ﬁ gure, if it has different ampliations/suppositions in each of the 
premises, the supposition of the minor middle term is subsumed under the 
supposition of the major middle term. For the third ﬁ gure, the intermediary 
conclusions having <> or [  ] as the modality ranging over the subject 
then entail the more general conclusion with *<> as the subject’s modality. 
This reconstruction follows closely Buridan’s own reasoning to show the 
correctness of his general claims.
The main methodological point emerging from these considerations 
is that focus on ﬁ gures allows for a geometrical, quasi-algebraic approach 
to modal syllogisms, based on the position of the terms in the syllogism –
which is precisely what a syllogistic ﬁ gure is about– and their ampliations. 
And yet, syllogistic ﬁ gures are not schemata, and no reference is made 
to the so-called ‘logical terminology’, besides the ampliative effect of 
modal terms. Clearly, investigating the validity of schemata is not the 
only viable approach to investigate the validity of arguments, and in this 

 
THE FORM OF A SYLLOGISM: MOOD OR FIGURE? 
131
case the focus on ﬁ gures allows for a greater level of generality in the 
analysis.
True enough, and as remarked before, the case of syllogistic is rather 
special in that a syllogism has two distinctive properties, a mood and a 
ﬁ gure, whereas it is not immediately obvious what the counterpart of a 
syllogistic ﬁ gure would be for arguments in general. So the claim is not 
that the ‘ﬁ gure perspective’ should be adopted across the board for the 
analysis of the validity of arguments, but rather that, at least in the case of 
modal syllogisms, and coupled with the concept of ampliation, it offers a 
particularly fruitful vantage point for logical analysis.
4. Conclusion
Elsewhere26 I argued that schematic logical hylomorphism is a 
misguided doctrine, at least if it is meant to offer an account of that in 
virtue of which arguments are valid, entailing the view that validity is 
exclusively a matter of form. I also argued that this version of logical 
hylomorphism is based on a rather shaky conception of the metaphysics 
of arguments: it is a mereological hylomorphism which requires a unique, 
principled and sharp separation of the form of an argument from its matter 
–something that might simply be impossible to achieve, as the vexing and 
unresolved issue of the demarcation of logical constants suggests. This 
does not mean that focusing on schemata cannot be a fruitful approach in 
logical inquiry, and much progress in the history of logic has been made 
on the basis of the notion of schemata. But the schematic approach is best 
seen as an instrumental, pragmatically fruitful stance, not as providing 
answers to hard philosophical questions such as what warrants the validity 
of arguments.
In this paper, I began by reviewing the developments leading from 
the association of the form of a syllogism to its ﬁ gure with the ancient 
commentators to the association of the form of arguments in general to 
schemata, including syllogistic moods, in the 14th century with Buridan. 
But while Buridan relies on schemata to introduce the concept of formal 
consequence, in the same treatise he makes extensive use of syllogistic 
ﬁ gures for logical analysis, as discussed in the second half of the paper. 
26 DUTILH NOVAES, «Reassessing logical hylomorphism».

Buridan thus illustrates the general attitude in logic that I would like 
to recommend: one should adopt the perspective that is most suitable 
for the particular subject matter under investigation –in other words, 
a methodologically liberal stance. Schemata are not the only kinds of 
constructions relevant for logical analysis. For modal syllogisms, Buridan 
has shown that adopting the ﬁ gure-perspective is a particularly fruitful 
move.

PAUL THOM*
ANALYSING ARGUMENTS IN THE THIRTEENTH AND 
FOURTEENTH CENTURIES
Aristotle tells us that his investigations into the syllogism in the Prior 
Analytics fall into three parts, dealing respectively with the theory of 
syllogistic deduction, how to ﬁ nd a middle term so as to make a syllogism, 
and how to analyse a piece of discourse into syllogistic form1. I want to 
talk about this third part, the part that deals with analysis. I will argue 
that anyone who takes this part of the Analytics to be part of logic, must 
have a conception of logic that is partly non-formal, that Robert Kilwardby 
conceived of logic in this way, that he was aware of the difference in kind 
between analysis and deduction, that some of his successors weakened his 
concept of syllogistic form, that they conceived of some matters which 
Kilwardby dealt with under the rubric of analysis as better dealt with under 
the rubric of deduction, and that in extending the reach of formal logic in 
this way they no longer treated analysis into logical form as a signiﬁ cant 
part of logic.
Kilwardby devotes close and extended attention to difﬁ culties that 
arise in putting informal reasoning into syllogistic form. He poses and 
answers more than 30 detailed questions to these difﬁ culties. Many later 
question-commentaries displayed less interest in these chapters. Two of the 
thirteenth-century commentaries listed by Sten Ebbesen have no questions 
at all on the subject2. Simon of Faversham has only 3 questions –two about 
oblique syllogisms and one about reduplicated propositions3. Radulphus 
Brito shows greater interest in these matters, having 16 questions covering 
most of the Aristotelian material4.

My focus will be on Kilwardby’s procedure in reducing arguments 
to syllogistic form, with special attention to his treatment of arguments 
in which one or other of the terms is inﬁ nitated, i.e. is subjected to an 
unqualiﬁ ed term-negation. I will also brieﬂ y look at Kilwardby’s treatment 
of reduplicated propositions. Finally, I will try to draw out some general 
features of the development of logic in second half of the thirteenth and the 
early fourteenth centuries.
Kilwardby’ account of reduction to syllogistic form
Kilwardby’s treatment of this material is based on a strong conception 
of syllogistic form, and it maintains a clear demarcation between what is 
yet-to-be-syllogized and what exhibits syllogistic form. 
Reduction
The process whereby what is yet-to-be-syllogized gets expressed as a 
syllogism is, in Aristotle’s word, a process of analysis; Boethius’s word is 
reductio. Kilwardby describes the process in the following way:
a certain reduction of an utterance that is to be syllogized is made 
when it is syllogized in actuality, and this is when an utterance that 
is arranged in a confused and disorderly way has to be reduced 
subsequently to syllogistic form5.
The concept of ordering occupies an important place in Kilwardby’s 
view of the content of the Prior Analytics. He says that the ﬁ rst section 
of Book I, i.e. Chapters 1-26, has as its main concern the ordering of the 
5 Robert Kilwardby, Notule libri Priorum [henceforth, NLPri] Ms Firenze, 
Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [henceforth, BNCF] J.10.48, f. 49vb: «Et dicendum quod 
reductio sillogismorum est multiplex. Aut enim est oratio sillogistica actu sillogizata 
uel potentia tantum. Si potentia, sic ﬁ t quedam reductio orationis sillogizande in actu 
sillogizata, et hoc est quando oratio confuse et inordinate disposita est, et postea reduci 
debet in formam sillogisticam (talis autem est reductio que determinatur hic)» (A32-
33, dub. 1).  

 
ANALYSING ARGUMENTS IN THE THIRTEENTH 
135
middle term in relation to the extremes6. Thus he sees the theory of the 
syllogism (which is what is presented in those chapters) as being principally 
concerned with a type of ordering. It is not surprising, therefore, that he 
views the section of the book dealing with the application of that theory 
as showing us how to uncover or impose order in materials that are to-be-
syllogized. For, to understand something as a syllogism is to understand it 
as possessing a certain type of order. 
Kilwardby characterises the relationship between the yet-to-be-
syllogized and the syllogized in two different ways. What is yet-to-be-
syllogized is ‘potentially a syllogism’7. At the same time, in actualizing 
this potential, ‘we must … correct the way of taking <the terms> if they 
are taken in an inappropriate way’8. These seem to be antithetical activities: 
to actualise the potential that exists in something is to uncover something 
that is already latent in the thing’s nature, whereas to correct something 
is to replace something in it by something that initially was not in it. Its 
potentialities are internal to the thing, whereas corrections assume a standard 
that is external to it. The antithesis is real, but it is also inevitable given that 
to express something in syllogistic form is to interpret it. An interpreter 
certainly aims to ﬁ nd something within the object of interpretation that 
will make of it the kind of sense that is sought; but sometimes sense can 
be made of the object only by bringing it into alignment with an external 
standard. This double polarity is a general feature of the activity of 
interpretation, and therefore applies to the particular case where inferential 
material is interpreted syllogistically. Kilwardby shows an awareness of 
the interpretive nature of reduction to syllogistic form when he says that 
6 Kilwardby, f. 28ra: «In prima determinat sillogismorum generationem, in 
secunda, (cum dicit ‘Quomodo autem reducemus’) eorumdem reductionem. 
Ad generationem autem sillogismorum duo pertinent, scilicet ordinacio medii 
respectu extremorum et eiusdem inuencio. Ideo prima in duas. In prima determinat 
ordinacionem medii respectu extremorum, in secunda, (cum dicit ‘Quomodo autem 
idonei’), determinat eiusdem inuencionem.»
7 Kilwardby, f. 49vb: «Et dicendum ad primum quod si oratio que solum 
potentia sillogizata est debeat in formam sillogisticam reduci, necesse est illam 
formam sillogisticam prius cognosci. Sed illa non cognoscitur nisi per sillogismorum 
generationem» (A32-33, dub. 2).
8  Kilwardby, f. 51ra: «quasi diceret, secundum predicta documenta considerandum 
est terminos in reductione et corrigendum est eorum acceptionem si inconuenienter 
accipiantur» (A37, 49a10).

136 
PAUL THOM
the syllogism is ‘understood’ in the material to-be-syllogized9, adding that 
in the process of reduction we must not be misled into ‘accidental ways of 
understanding’ but must articulate the ‘essential comparison of the middle 
to the extremes’10.
Some modern writers take the process of putting something into 
logical form to be one of translation. Alex Oliver holds this view. When 
we put somehing into logical form, according to Oliver, we are simply 
translating pre-formal material into sentences of a given logic, with the 
aim of preserving some at least of the original sentences’ inferential 
properties11. By contrast, the process of reduction, as Kilwardby conceives 
it, sometimes requires that we re-order things and correct errors. Moreover, 
as we shall see, it sometimes requires that we suppress existing material 
and introduce new material. But, to change the order, to make corrections, 
deletions and additions –these are not the activities of a good translator. 
So Kilwardby presumably would not accept an Oliver-style account of the 
activity of reduction to syllogistic form.
Like all interpretation, reduction to syllogistic form aims to make 
a speciﬁ c kind of sense of its object, and it presupposes an interpreting 
scheme that is capable of endowing that kind of sense on an object of 
interpretation. In the present case the aim is to make rational sense of the 
object. The interpreting scheme, in general terms, is a theory of logic, 
and the reduction is a rational reconstruction. Speciﬁ cally, the logical 
theory that Kilwardby presupposes in commenting on these chapters is 
the Aristotelian theory of the syllogism, and it is assumed that rational 
discourse can be reduced to syllogistic form. 
The process of reducing an inference to syllogistic form cannot itself 
be seen as a formal inference. It is therefore appropriate that the expressions 
Kilwardby uses in describing this process (the expressions ‘introduction 
of order’, ‘essential understanding’, ‘actualisation of potential’, and 
9 Kilwardby, f. 50ra: «Sed minor huius sillogismi intelligitur in secunda 
propositione orationis dicte universaliter intellecte» (A32-33, dub. 5).
10 Kilwardby, f. 51rb: «Et dicendum ad primum quod talis diuersitas medii que 
est secundum obliquum et rectum non est nisi secundum accidentales modos 
intelligendi, et hec diuersitas non creat diuersitatem in comparatione essentiali medii 
ad extrema, et ideo talis diuersitas medii non impedit sillogismum» (A36-37, dub. 3).

‘correction’) are all distinct from the technical terms used by logicians to 
describe the relation between premises and conclusion in a valid inference 
(‘entailment’, ‘deducibility’, ‘syllogize’). The distinction demonstrates 
Kilwardby’s ﬁ rm resolve to maintain a conceptual space and a distinctive 
vocabulary for the yet-to-be-syllogized. He thought that the study of the 
syllogism formed the core of logic, but he knew that one essential part of 
that study was non-formal. 
Syllogistic form
The products of this process are inferences expressed in syllogistic 
form. In order to possess syllogistic form, an inference must contain 
nothing superﬂ uous and must omit nothing that is needed, so that there are 
two propositions, which are related in the due manner12 i.e. with one as a 
whole and the other a part13, with the whole stated before the part14, and 
with the propositions transcribed into predicative form15.
Kilwardby’s conception of syllogistic form relies on a traditional 
exposition of Aristotle’s deﬁ nition of the syllogism –in particular, he 
understands the Aristotelian requirement that in the premises some things 
are stated [positis in Boethius’s translation] to mean that the premises must 
be stated in ﬁ gure and mood, and that ﬁ gure and mood constitute the form 
of the syllogism16. But as his commentary continues, this conception is 
12 Kilwardby, f. 49va: «Consequenter determinat difﬁ cultatem siue errorem 
accidentem circa habitam reductionem. Et primo manifestat in terminis qualiter 
ﬁ t deceptio ex superﬂ uitate uel diminuitione» (A32, 47a22). Ibid.: «Non statim 
temptandum est tales orationes reducere antequam ﬁ at acceptio duarum propositionum 
debito modo se habencium» (A32, 47a28).
13 Kilwardby, f. 49va: «docet quomodo se debent habere propositiones, dicens 
quod altera ut totum, reliqua ut pars» (A32, 47a12).
14 Kilwardby, f. 50ra: «hic non est debita positio propositionum, illa enim que ut 
pars est primo ponitur, que autem est ut totum secundo, tamquam ipsa sub sua parte 
accipiatur» (A32-33, dub. 7).
15 Kilwardby, f. 50ra: «Si autem transferantur propositiones in predicatiuas sic, 
‘Omnis homo est animal et omne animal est substantia’, iam non est nisi peccatum 
unum contra sillogismum, scilicet indebita potitio propositionum» (A32-33, dub. 7).
16 Kilwardby, f. 28vb: «Et dicendum quod sicut ordo est in materiis – quedam 
enim est remota et indisposita, quedam autem propinqua et disposita – sic et in 
formis. Quedam enim forma materialis est et in potentia ad formam ulteriorem,

strengthened. In order for an inference to possess syllogistic form it is 
not enough that it be in some ﬁ gure and have some mood; it must also 
be in accord with the principles governing individual syllogistic ﬁ gures 
and moods17. For example, an inference in the second ﬁ gure must have 
a negative premise; and, since Aristotle tells us that all contingency-
propositions are afﬁ rmative in form, this means that no second ﬁ gure 
inference having a contingency-premise and an afﬁ rmative necessity-
premise possesses syllogistic form18.
Further requirements emerge elsewhere in Robert’s commentary. In 
his discussion of A28 he argues that third ﬁ gure inferences with a singular 
term as middle are not properly speaking syllogisms, because while they 
are in a ﬁ gure they are not in any mood19. Syllogistic mood, it seems, 
requires either universal or particular premises, not singulars. In a note 
on A9 he also excludes singular propositions from appearing in mixed 
necessity/assertoric ﬁ rst ﬁ gure syllogisms20.
quedam autem est ultima et completiua. Et sic inuenimus in sillogismo ordinem 
esse in materiis et in formis – in materiis quia terminus est materia eius remota et 
indisposita, propositio uero materia propinqua et disposita; in formis quia ﬁ gura est 
forma incompleta ens in potentia ad ulteriorem formam, modus autem est forma 
ultima sillogismi completiua. Et respondet incompletum in formis incompleto 
in materiis, scilicet ﬁ gura termino, et completum in formis completo in materiis, 
scilicet modus propositioni» (A4, dub. 3).

Inﬁ nite terms
In Chapter 32 Aristotle discusses ways in which we can be misled 
into thinking that an inference is syllogistic when it isn’t so. For example, 
we may take an inference to be syllogistic because its conclusion follows 
necessarily from its premises21. But it may not be so; and if not we will 
have to add any unstated premise that is needed, and delete any stated 
premise that is superﬂ uous, for a syllogism to come about22. As an example 
Aristotle cites the inference:
When a non-substance is destroyed, a substance is not destroyed; 
when a thing’s parts are destroyed, the thing is destroyed; so 
substance-parts are substances.
This might seem to satisfy the Aristotelian deﬁ nition of a syllogism, 
because its conclusion is different from its two premises and follows from them 
necessarily. But as against that, it cannot be a syllogism, because it derives an 
afﬁ rmative conclusion from premises one of which is negative, and because 
the conclusion contains a term (‘substance-part’) that is not in the premises23.
Kilwardby notes that there is a syllogism leading to the desired 
conclusion, namely:
21 Kilwardby, f. 49vb: «multociens ﬁ t deceptio eo quod putatur esse sillogismus 
qui non est, et hoc aliquando in orationibus necessariis quia enim necessitatem habent 
creditur quod sint sillogismi» (A33, 47b15). 
22 Kilwardby, f. 49va: «Ideo oportet si sui necessariorum omissum sit apponere, 
si quid autem superﬂ uum interrogatum auferre» (A32, 47a14).
23 Kilwardby, f. 50ra: «Consequenter dubitatur de suo exemplo ubi dicit 
conclusionem sequi sed propositiones deﬁ cere ut hic: Non substantia interempta 
non interemitur  substantia, sed partibus rei interemptis interimitur res, ergo partes 
substantie sunt substantie. Uidetur enim quod sit sillogismus, cum sit oratio in qua 
quibusdam positis etc.
Oppositum autem uidetur multipliciter. Et primo per hoc quod altera premissarum 
negatiua est et conclusio afﬁ rmatiua, quod non contingit in sillogismo. Adhuc 
quicumque terminus est in conclusione oportet quod sit in premissis, sed in dicta 
oratione est aliquis terminus in conclusione qui non est in premissis. Adhuc omnes 
termini premissarum preter medium inueniri debent in conclusione, sed sic non est in 
dicta oratione, quare non est sillogismus. Et hoc uerum est. 
Ad obiectum dicendum quod non est ibi recta dispositio terminorum et 
propositionum. Et ideo non conuenit ei difﬁ nitio silogismi licet concludat ex 
necessitate» (A32-33, dub. 4).

PAUL THOM
Things whose destruction leads to the destruction of a substance 
are substances; but the destruction of substance-parts leads to the 
destruction of a substance; so substance-parts are substances.
But the premises of this syllogism are not those of the given syllogism. 
The major premise here is an afﬁ rmation about things whose destruction 
leads to the destruction of a substance, whereas the original major was a 
denial about non-substances. The new minor premise, on the other hand, 
can be understood in the original minor, because whereas the original 
minor made a statement about the parts of things in general the new minor 
is about substance-parts in particular. 
Kilwardby proposes to turn the inference into a syllogistic argument 
leading from the original premises to the original conclusion in two stages. 
In the ﬁ rst stage, given that the desired conclusion is about substance-parts, 
he replaces the original minor premise (which is about things in general) 
with a premise whose subject is restricted to substance-parts. One might 
expect that he would also reformulate the negative major premise with 
an afﬁ rmative, given that the desired conclusion is afﬁ rmative. However, 
Kilwardby cannot do this, given that afﬁ rmatives are in general supposed 
not to follow from negatives. So he retains the major premise in its negative 
form. These two premises will lead by a second-ﬁ gure syllogism to the 
conclusion that no substance-part is a non-substance: 
When a non-substance is destroyed, a substance is not destroyed;
but when substance-parts are destroyed, a substance is destroyed;
so substance-parts are not non-substances24.
24 Kilwardby, f. 50ra: «Queritur igitur quomodo desunt ibi propositiones.
Et dicendum quod proprie premisse huius conclusionis ‘Partes substantie sunt 
substantie’ sunt due: ‘Quibus interemptis interimitur substantia, substantie sunt; sed partibus 
substantie interemptis interimitur substantia; ergo partes substantie sunt substantie’. Iste 
propositiones desunt in predicta oratione ad hoc quod immediate sillogizetur conclusio. 
Sed minor huius sillogismi intelligitur in secunda propositione orationis dicte uniuersaliter 
intellecte. Per prosillogismum autem sillogizatur sic, ex prima propositione posita in litera 
et minore subintellecta, in secunda propositione per secundam ﬁ guram: ‘Non substantia 
interempta, non interimitur substantia; partibus substantie interemptis interimitur 
substantia; ergo partes substantie non sunt non substantie’. Ex hoc autem et quodam uero 
coassumpto sillogizatur sic: ‘Que sunt et non sunt non substantie sunt substantie; sed partes 
substantie sunt et non sunt non substantie; ergo partes substantie sunt substantie’. Sic igitur 
patet quomodo ex prosillogismo sillogizatur et qualiter desunt propositiones et que, et quod 
oratio quam ponit quamuis sit necessaria non tamen est sillogismus» (A32-33, dub. 5).

In the second stage, Kilwardby’s aim is to get from the universal 
denial that no substance-part is a non-substance to the desired universal 
afﬁ rmation that every substance-part is a substance. To this end, he brings 
in what he calls the ‘true assumption’ that any being that is not a non-
substance is a substance. As it stands, the intermediate conclusion, that 
substance-parts are not non-substances, doesn’t mesh syllogistically with 
this assumption; so he reformulates that conclusion as ‘Substance-parts 
are beings that are not non-substances’. He is then able to deduce by a ﬁ rst 
ﬁ gure syllogism that substance-parts are substances. 
The whole analysis can be represented in the following way (where D 
stands for ‘thing such that a substance is destroyed when it is destroyed’, P 
for ‘substance-part’ and S for ‘substance’):
When a non-S is destroyed an S is not destroyed 
 
¨ (1) No non-S is a D
When a thing’s part is destroyed the thing is destroyed 
 
¨ (2) Every P is a D
 
 
No P is a non-S  ¨ Every P is a being that is a non-S
 
 
 
 
(3) Every being that is not a non-S is an S
 
 
 
 
Every P is an S
Figure 1. Reduction of ‘Every substance-part is a substance’ (Kilwardby)
The original premises (‘When a non-substance is destroyed, a 
substance is not destrotyed’ and ‘When a thing’s parts are destroyed the 
thing is destroyed’) are ﬁ rst reformulated as propositions (1) and (2). 
(The arrows indicate this process of reformulation.) (1) and (2) lead by a 
prosyllogism in Cesare to the intermediate conclusion ‘No P is a non-S’. 
This is reformulated as ‘Every P is a being that is not a non-S’. And this, 
together with Kilwardby’s extra assumption (3) leads by a syllogism in 
Barbara to the desired conclusion ‘Every P is an S’. 
This process involves two types of transformation, indicated 
respectively by arrows connecting statements, and by horizontal lines under 
premise-pairs. Transformations of the ﬁ rst type are strategic reformulations 
that are aimed at getting the inference into a format that can be handled 
by syllogistic theory. Those of the second type are formal transformations 
within syllogistic theory.

142 
PAUL THOM
Interesting here is the transformation of ‘No P is a non-S’ into ‘Every P 
is a being that is not a non-S’. The formal terms in which I have expressed 
this transformation might suggest that I am attributing to Kilwardby a 
formal logical rule to this effect. But this impression would be misleading. 
There doesn’t seem to be any body of logical theory in Kilwardby to which 
such a formal transformation would belong. I think he simply takes these 
two expressions as different formulations of the same proposition; thus 
this transformation is of the same general type as the initial interpretive 
reformulations of the original premises. 
One further feature of Kilwardby’s analysis must be mentioned. 
He presents the proposition (3) as a true assumption; but it looks like 
something more signiﬁ cant than that. It looks as if it ought to be part of a 
formal logical theory of negative terms. I don’t think it has this character 
in Kilwardby’s thought; but we will see that it, or something rather like it, 
does take on this character in the work of a later logician.
Reduplicative propositions
In commentaing on Aristotle’s Chapters 32-46 Kilwardby considers 
a number of difﬁ cult cases for the application of syllogistic theory to 
ordinary inferences. I will take his treatment of reduplicative propositions 
as representative. 
In Chapter 38, Aristotle considers the reduction to syllogistic form of 
inferences containing reduplicated propositions (i.e. propositions in which 
A is said to be B insofar as it is C). Kilwardby notes that reduplication 
appears to be a property of the proposition’s subject:
It appears as if reduplication is a property of the subject, because it 
bespeaks the cause why the predicate inheres in the subject25.
But he ﬁ nds reason to support Aristotle’s view that reduplication 
attaches to the proposition’s predicate:
Reduplication indicates the cause of the predicate’s inhering in 
the subject, but the relation of inherence begins from the predicate 
25 Kilwardby, f. 51vb: «Et uidetur subjecti, quia reduplicatio dicit causam entem 
in subiecto quare predicatum ei inest» (A38-40, dub. 1).

 
ANALYSING ARGUMENTS IN THE THIRTEENTH 
143
and ends in the subject, so reduplication is properly added to the 
predicate26.
He notes all of Aristotle’s examples of syllogistic reasoning with 
reduplicated terms. He also identiﬁ es some classes of such reasoning not 
mentioned by Aristotle, pointing out that there are such inferences with 
negative premises27, and that there can be syllogisms in all the ﬁ gures with a 
reduplication of the middle and the minor28. What he does not do is to provide 
any comprehensive account of the semantics of reduplicative propositions or 
of the logic of inferences containing them. He says that Aristotle doesn’t 
mean to teach the modes of syllogizing with reduplication, but only to show 
how reduction to terms is be done when reduplication is present29.
Later formal developments
The century following Kilwardby’s work saw huge changes in the 
way logic was studied in the Latin West. Three sorts of development are 
especially striking in the present context. First, the concept of syllogistic 
form as propounded by Kilwardby was loosened by dropping some of 
Kilwardby’s requirements. Second, greater interest was devoted to non-
syllogistic forms of inference. And third, the Aristotelian art of reducing 
pre-theoretic materials to syllogistic form played a decreasing role in the 
writings of logicians. 
26 Kilwardby, f. 51vb: «Reduplicatio autem […] signat causam inherencie, que 
quidem inherencia incipit a predicato et terminatur ad subiectum, et ideo additur 
predicato proprie» (A38-40, dub. 1).
27 Kilwardby, f. 51vb: «Et quod contingat palam est in exemplo sic: ‘Nullum 
eligendum est malum in quantum eligendum; omne bonum est eligendum; ergo nullum 
bonum est malum in quantum eligendum’. Hic iam facta est reduplicatio medii. Fit 
etiam reduplicatio minoris sic: ‘Nullum corpus in quantum egrum est sanum in 
quantum egrum; omne egrum est corpus in quantum egrum; ergo nullum egrum est 
sanum in quantum egrum’» (A38-40, dub. 3).
28 Kilwardby, f. 52ra: «Et dicendum quod in secunda ﬁ gura ﬁ eri potest minoris 
reduplicatio in minori propositione, sed non potest ﬁ eri reduplicatio medii. In tercia 
autem ﬁ gura econuerso ﬁ t reduplicatio medii sed non minoris» (A38-40, dub. 4).
29 Kilwardby, f. 51vb-52ra: «Et dicendum quod Aristoteles non intendit hic docere 
modos sillogizandi cum reduplicatione, sed tantum intendit quomodo in terminos 
facienda est reductio duarum propositionum ubi sumitur reduplicatio» (A38-40 dub.3).

With regard to the notion of syllogistic form, Ockham continued to 
maintain the traditional exposition of the Aristotelian deﬁ nition of the 
syllogism, according to which a syllogism must be in a ﬁ gure, but he 
allowed that the premises could be singular propositions30. Buridan widened 
the application of the concept of a syllogism even beyond the limits set by 
Ockham. He rejected the traditional gloss on Aristotle’s deﬁ nition of the 
syllogism, and with it the requirement that every syllogism be in one of the 
three ﬁ gures. He argued that, since we use the deﬁ nition of the syllogism 
in assessing which moods are syllogistic and which are not, the deﬁ nition 
cannot presuppose which moods are syllogistic; instead, we infer that 
a mood is syllogistic from the fact that its conclusion follows from its 
premises by virtue of a middle that is distinct from its extremes31. What 
makes a syllogistic inference valid is that a subsumption is made under a 
distributed middle term, whether that term occurs as a subject or predicate 
or whether it occurs as a part of a subject or predicate. Given his revised 
concept of a syllogistic inference and this test of validity, Buridan has a 
theoretical basis on which he can determine the validity or invalidity of 
syllogistic inferences containing oblique terms32. By contrast, Kilwardby’s

account of oblique terms requires him to reduce inferences containing 
them to one the Aristotelian syllogistic ﬁ gures.
With regard to non-syllogistic inferences, Ockham made a notable 
advance through his theory of exponible propositions. Ockham’s usage 
of the expression ‘expositio’ in this context is not the traditional one that 
denotes a kind of interpretation; rather, in his usage ‘exposition’ denotes 
a kind of logical consequence. An exponible proposition is one which, by 
virtue of its form, entails each of several exponents, whose conjunction 
in turn entails that proposition33. The exponents follow logically from the 
exponible proposition and it follows from them. In this respect the relation 
between the exponents and the exponible proposition differs from that 
between the premises and conclusion of a syllogism. For no syllogism, 
stated in its most general form, is such that the truth of its premises follows 
from the truth of its conclusion34.
Ockham states a rule for the validity of inferences containing exponible 
propositions. An exponible conclusion follows from two premises, one at 
least of which is exponible, if and only if every exponent of the conclusion 
(or the conclusion itself) follows from some exponents of the premises (or 
from an exponent of one premise together with the other premise)35. This 
points to another difference between these inferences and syllogisms. An 
inference such as Ockham describes may very well be from premises some 
of which are redundant –something that never happens in a syllogism stated 
sit totale praedicatum vel pars praedicati, vel totale subiectum maioris, vel pars 
subiecti.» See John Buridan, Summulae de Dialectica: an annotated translation, with 
a philosophical introduction by G. KLIMA (Yale University Press, New Haven 2001), 
§§ 4.3.6 and 5.8.1-5.8.4.
33 Ockham, Summa logicae II.11: «Et est sciendum, quod quaelibet categorica, 
ex qua sequuntur plures propositiones categoricae tamquam exponentes, hoc est 
exprimentes quid ista propositio ex forma sua importat, potest dici propositio 
aequivalens propositioni hypotheticae.»

‘some members of A are true’ should read ‘some members of Q are false’.) 
35 Ockham, Summa logicae III.i.65: «Pro quibus utendum est ista regula generali, 
quod quandocumque quaelibet exponens conclusionis vel ipsa conclusio sequitur ex 
aliquibus exponentibus praemissarum vel ex aliqua exponente unius praemissae et alia 
praemissa, semper est syllogismus bonus, et aliter non. Et ideo ad videndum, an talis 
discursus sit bonus vel non, oportet diligenter videre, quae sunt exponentes talium 
praemissarum et conclusionis et quomodo se habent secundum consequentiam ad 
invicem.»

in its most general form36. This feature of inferences containing exponible 
propositions can be illustrated as follows. Suppose an inference’s conclusion 
has two exponents, and that both of them follow from the ﬁ rst premise by 
itself no matter what the second premise is. Ockham’s rule is satisﬁ ed, but 
the inference has an irreducibly redundant premise. Surprisingly, however, 
Ockham calls inferences that satify his rule syllogisms (‘the syllogism 
is always good’). Perhaps he is using’syllogism’ here in a broad sense to 
cover all valid inferences from more than one premise. 
A proposition like ‘An ass is a non-man’ has as its exponents ‘An 
ass is something’ and ‘An ass is not a man’37. Thus, ‘What is something, 
but is not an X, is a non-X’ is true. This principle is reminiscent of 
Kilwardby’s principle that what is, but is not an S, is a non-S. But, unlike 
his predecessor, Ockham is able to put his principle to work in a systematic 
way, thanks to his rule for inferences containing exponible propositions. 
Thus, the inference ‘All men are reasoners, Brownie is a non-reasoner, so 
Brownie is a non-man’ is valid because the conclusion has two exponents 
(‘Brownie is something’ and ‘Brownie is not a man’), and the ﬁ rst of these 
is an exponent of the minor, while the second follows syllogistically from 
the major premise together with an exponent of the minor (‘Brownie is not 
a reasoner’).
There are many types of exponible proposition in Ockham’s logic. 
Reduplicative propositions are among them. A proposition ‘A insofar as 
it is B is C’ has the exponents ‘A is C’, ‘A is B’, ‘Every B is C’ and ‘If 
something is B it is C’ where this last proposition is understood to be the 
sort of conditional that links a lower to a higher term in the same category or 
two convertible terms38. Such propositions therefore, like those containing

inﬁ nite terms, are subject to Ockham’s general rule for inferences involving 
exponible propositions. For example the inference ‘Every A insofar as it is 
B is C, some D is an A, so some D insofar as it is a B is a C’ can be shown 
to be valid by Ockham’s analysis into exponents. The analysis will show 
that every exponent of the conclusion either is an exponent of the major 
or else follows from the minor together with an exponent of the major. 
The exponents of the conclusion are (1) ‘Some D is a C’, (2) ‘Some D is 
a B’, (3) ‘Every B is a C’, and (in a suitably strong sense) ‘If something 
is a B it is a C’. Now, (1) follows syllogistically from the minor (‘Some 
D is an A’) together with an exponent of the major (‘Every A is a C’). (2) 
follows syllogistically from the minor together with an exponent of the 
major (‘Every A is a B’). (3) and (4) are exponents of the major39. So here 
again Ockham has a way of reducing a class of inferences to formally 
valid inferences some of which are not syllogistic since they are inferences 
between an exponible proposition and its exponents. 
Conclusion
In the territory we have surveyed, Kilwardby’s formalizing ambitions 
were considerable –even heroic. He shared Aristotle’s faith in the possibility 
of reducing inferences with inﬁ nite or oblique terms, and with reduplicative 
propositions, to the standard syllogistic forms without developing new 
logics to deal speciﬁ cally with those types of term and proposition. 
The reductions he envisaged fall in the area of the application of a 
formal logical theory. In this non-formal part of logic, the general nature 
principale illo modo quo ab inferiori ad superius dicitur esse bona consequentia et 
quomodo dicitur quod ex uno convertibilium sequitur reliquum.»
39 Ockham, Summa logicae III.i.65: «Sicut ad videndum an iste discursus sit 
bonus ‘Omnis homo inquantum homo est risibilis, animal est homo, igitur animal 
inquantum hom est risibilis’ oportet videre exponentes maioris et conclusionis. Unde 
exponentes maioris sunt istae ‘Omnis homo est homo’, ‘Omnis homo est risibilis’, 
‘Si aliquid est homo ipsum est risibile’. Exponentes conclusionis sunt ipsae ‘Animal 
est homo’, ‘Animal est risibile’, ‘Omnis homo est est risibilis’, ‘Si aliquid est homo 
ipsum est risibile’. Nunc autem sequitur ‘Omnis homo est homo igitur animal est 
homo’. Similiter sequitur ‘Omnis homo est risibilis igitur animal est risibile’. Aliae 
duae exponentes conclusionis sunt exponentes maioris. Ex quo patet quod omnes 
exponentes conclusionis sequuntur ex antecedente et ita discursus est bonus.»

of the problem to be solved is this: how can certain pre-theoretic terms, 
propositions and inferences be adequately represented in a given logical 
theory. Solutions are arrived at through an art of interpretation not through 
techniques of deduction. 
Kilwardby’s successors no longer wanted to reduce inferences with 
inﬁ nite or oblique terms to Aristotelian syllogisms, but they succeeded in 
absorbing into the domain of formal logic some of what Kilwardby treated 
as a matter of interpretation. That was a gain. At the same time, the art of 
uncovering the formal deductions that can be found in informal discourse 
no longer played a major role in their presentations of logic. And this was a 
loss, because this is an art that every student of logic has to learn.

JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE
Introduction
The notion of ‘forma’ plays a variety of roles in medieval logic. An 
example of the use of ‘forma’ is the so called forma-materia device, as 
a way to analyse and establish the truth value of sophisma-sentences1. 
Furthermore, the concept of ‘forma’ plays an important part in medieval 
discussions on inference: an inference is often said to be valid in virtue of 
its ‘forma’. 
Besides having a use in logic, the concept of form of course also features 
prominently in the philosophical outlook of the Formalist movement2. 
One of its representatives, the Spanish Scotist, Petrus Thomae3 devoted 
a considerable effort on a thorough analysis of Scotistic terminology, and 
especially the concept of ‘distinctio formalis’. He wrote a short treatise 
called De unitate minori4, in which he analyses the concept of unity which 
is less than numerical. In this short tract the author discusses numerous 
arguments brought forward by others on speciﬁ c philosophical issues, and 
in his own replies to their accounts, he frequently refers to the ‘forma’ of 
an argument. 
In this contribution I will delve into the idea of ‘formalness’ as found 
in the work of the medieval logician John Wyclif. It is quite remarkable 
that the ‘realist’ Wyclif wants nothing to do with the so-called consequentia

materialis. Considering his adamant rejection of this particular, quite 
commonly accepted type of consequentia as a way to handle awkward 
kinds of inferences, we need to understand his conception of formality. It 
is interesting to brieﬂ y consider the treatise by Petrus Thomae as a prelude 
to Wyclif, because the former’s perspective on the forma of an argument 
resonates in Wyclif’s account.
As I hope to show, Wyclif’s notion of inference hinges on two 
separate foundations of logic. While his accounts of conditional and 
inferential expressions is expressed in terms of the logical truth-conditions 
of an inference, ultimately his analysis of the formalness or validity of 
inferences is based upon an ontological starting point, i.e., the ontology of 
the propositions. I shall ﬁ rst discuss his conception of inference featuring 
in his account of consequentia and that of conditional expressions. The 
most signiﬁ cant aspect of the latter is Wyclif’s critique of the distinction 
between consequentia formalis and consequentia materialis. In conclusion 
I shall brieﬂ y turn to the Logica Morelli, a work that was written later 
than John Wyclif’s, and which seems to return to an earlier conception of 
inference. 
For starters, let us ﬁ rst review the ways in which formality had come 
up in Syncategoremata treatises of the thirteenth century. 
1. ‘Matter’ and ‘form’ in the context of inference (consequentia)
1.1. The thirteenth century
For some time now, research has been done in the development of the 
distinction between formal and material consequences in logic5. While in

Consequences: with the edition of the Liber Consequentiarum, Bibliopolis, Napoli

the thirteenth century we already see indications of this type of distinction, 
the expressions consequentia formalis and consequentia materialis only 
became common lore in the fourteenth century.
In the thirteenth century, the nature of inference came up in Sophistaria 
treatises and Syncategoremata. The syncategorematic term ‘si’ was taken 
as a starting point for discussions about the nature of inferentiality. Most 
authors explained the meaning (consigniﬁ catio) of this expression in 
terms of a kind of causality. However, the nature of the causality involved 
was interpreted in different ways. Sometimes the authors highlighted the 
inferential function of ‘si’, whereas others were more inclined to include 
some kind of ontological causality in it as well.
One of the most problematic issues that worried the Syncategoremata 
authors was how they should deal with the standard description of a good 
inference, which implies that an inference is in order even if its antecedent 
is false, no matter what the consequent. And this in turn suggests that from 
an impossible antecedent anything at all follows (ex impossibili sequitur 
quidlibet). Thirteenth-century authors had two ways to cope with this 
outcome: one way was to qualify the notion of impossibility in such a way 
that in order to function as antecedent of an inference at all, the impossible 
in question must have some bearing on what is expressed in the consequent 
–in which case the rule was rejected–; others accepted the principle that 
from an impossible anything follows, but that it does not apply in every 
kind of inference6.
The former type of solution was suggested by authors like Peter of 
Spain, who rejected the ‘ex impossibili’ rule. There were others, such as 
Nicholas of Paris, who accepted it, but only in what were called ‘non-
natural’ consequences. In general the difﬁ culty of how to deal with ‘ex 
impossibili’ consequences was brought on by the authors’ commitment (to 
a greater or lesser degree, depending on the authors in question) to a system 
of logic that was mainly based upon the topical relationships between the 
terms featuring in antecedent and consequent of an conditional expression 
or inference.
The understanding that there could be such a thing as arguing from 
anything at all from an impossible antecedent, and, conversely, that a

necessary proposition could be argued for starting from any antecedent 
whatsoever, later on led logicians to identify an exceptional class of 
consequences, which became labelled as consequentia materialis. This 
strategy was adopted by people like Walter Burleigh and William of 
Ockham: the consequentia formalis was identiﬁ ed as a valid inference, 
the validity of which was based upon the semantic relationships between 
the terms featuring in is antecedent and consequent, whereas in material 
consequences such a relationship is absent. Thus they were able to 
accommodate the paradoxical cases of inference, i.e. inferences from an 
impossible antecedent and inferences to a necessary consequent, which 
were presumed to be valid as well, but not in the same way as consequentie 
formales7.
Before we proceed with Wyclif’s position on valid inference, we shall 
quickly consider some of Petrus Thomae’s remarks on ‘forma’.
1.2. Petrus Thomae on ‘forma’
The expression consequentia formalis was not the only one used 
in connection with the inferential relationships. As mentioned above, 
Petrus Thomae speaks about the forma to highlight a certain feature 
of an argument. In De unitate minori, the author puts forward a list of 
questions, which he deals with in the usual way by presenting arguments 
pro and con a speciﬁ c position. (Below I shall present two examples 
of how Petrus presents his case.) In order to recognise the signiﬁ cance 
of Petrus’s accounts in this connection (and Wyclif’s too, as we shall 
see later on), it is important that we ﬁ rst grasp what the notion of 
inferentiality involves. From what the author says we can gather that 
he takes inference to be a kind of true production of a conclusion from 
a (some) premise(s). So the notion of ‘true’ is a kernel ingredient, and 
requires serious attention.
Let us now turn to some of his examples. (1) In qu. 5, art. 3, the following 
syllogism is brought forward: whatever is truly real, is truly something 
7 For a general overview of the developments, see C. DUTILH NOVAES, «Medieval 
Theories of Consequence», in E. N. ZALTA (ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of

positive; now a privation and a negation are truly something real; therefore 
they are truly something positive8. After having presented this argument, 
Petrus responds to it by making a distinction between two ways of taking 
‘truly real’ (vere reale): in the ﬁ rst sense it is something positive, and in 
the second sense it is something that follows from something real, whether 
or not this thing itself is positive9. Petrus’s response to this argument is 
preceded by the phrase ‘ad formam’: as to the form, Petrus explains, it 
should be noticed that the major is true with regard to ‘truly real’ as taken 
in the ﬁ rst sense, but in this case the minor is not assumed under the major 
premise10. Hence he disagrees with the conclusion.
In the example just presented, the phrase ‘following from something 
real’ appears to be precisely the way to describe the relationship of 
inference. This particular conception in terms of ‘truly following’ is 
further explained by means of the generic concept of true production, as 
we can see in the second example. (2) In qu. 8, art. 4, we ﬁ nd the following 
argument: according to the Philosopher, Met. VII, c. 13, all that comes 
about, comes about by something similar, to which the Commentator notes, 
«Everything that is generated is generated by something similar in name 
and deﬁ nition»; therefore everything that is generated is generated by a 
univocal generation, and consequently no production is equivocal11. Later 
on Petrus replies to this syllogism: ‘ad formam’, he contends, the sayings 
of both Aristotle and the Commentator, should be understood as applying 
8 Petrus Thomae, De Unitate Minori, qu. 5, art. 3, ed. BOS, p. 42.985-986: «Quod 
vere est reale, vere est positivum; sed privatio et negatio sunt vere aliquid reale; ergo 
sunt vere aliquid positivum.»
9 Ibid., p. 42.988-990: «Respondeo: ‘vere reale’ aliquid potest dici, vel quia 
rem positivam dicit, et sic solum ens positivum est vere reale; vel quia veram rem 
sequitur, et sic quicquid sequitur veram rem aliquam potest dici vere reale, sive istud 
sit positivum, sive non.» For something non-positive, see below, p. 162.
10 Ibid., p. 43.995-996: «Ad formam: maior est vera de vere reali primo modo 
accepto; sed tunc minor non sumitur sub maiori.»
11 Ibid., qu. 8, art. 4, ed. BOS, p. 69.1876-1881: «Secundum Philosophum*, 
septimo Metaphysicae, capitulo <decimo> tertio, omne quod ﬁ t, ﬁ t a conveniente, 
ubi Commentator, commento trecesimo, ‘omne quod generatur, generatur convenienti 
nomine et ratione’; ergo omne quod generatur, generatur generatione univoca, et per 
consequens nulla productio est equivoca.» *Cf. Metaphysica VII, 13, 1038b23-27: 
«Amplius autem impossibile et inconveniens hoc esse substantiam, si est ex aliquibus, 
non ex substantiis esse, nec ex eo quod hoc aliquid sed ex quali. Prius enim erit non 
substantia et quale substantia et hoc, quod est impossibile.»

to natural generation, which proceeds from something that is speciﬁ cally 
the same to something that is speciﬁ cally the same12.
In both cases just mentioned (and many other examples can be found 
in this tract), the use of the phrase ‘ad formam’ applies, it would seem to 
me, to the shape or schematic form of the argument, i.e. the structure of the 
syllogism. We shall now consider Wyclif’s account.
2.  John Wyclif (1320-1384)13 on inference and conditionals
In Wyclif’s logic, the complicated issues surrounding the notion of 
‘formalness’ in medieval conceptions of logic takes an interesting turn. 
Wyclif is known for his tendency to reify all kinds of objects of thought. 
The ontological perspective that is so predominant in different parts of his 
logic also shines through in his discussion of inference.
Before we turn to the texts, a few preliminary remarks should be made. 
The premises of arguments of course are propositions, and the domain 
of propositions featuring in arguments is tied up with different kinds of 
certainty. In Wyclif’s account, premises are understood as expressing 
some state of affairs14. When it comes to the relationship of inference 
between propositions, the ontological status of what is expressed by these 
propositions acting as premises is decisive.
Wyclif’s conception of inference is brought forward inter alia two 
speciﬁ c sections of his Logic, viz. in the chapter on consequentiae and the 
one on conditionals.
12 Petrus Thomae, De unitate minori, qu. 8, art. 4, ed. BOS, p. 71.1951-1953: «Ad 
formam: dictum Philosophi et Commentatoris debet intelligi de generatione naturali et 
per se, et que procedit ab eodem specie et ad idem specie.»

JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE 
155
2.1. Consequentiae
In the thirteenth chapter of his Logic, Wyclif brings speaks about 
the good and formal consequence (consequentia bona et formalis)15. 
He gives one standard deﬁ nition only of the expression ‘consequentia’; 
a consequentia is a kind of relationship between an antecedent and a 
consequent, combined with an inferential expression, or an aggregate of 
an antecedent and a consequent, combined with an inferential expression16. 
Inferential expressions include words such as ‘ergo’, ‘igitur’, ‘ideo’, and 
‘quare’17. Unlike the author of Logica Morelli (to which we shall turn 
later), Wyclif does not give a separate deﬁ nition of a good and formal 
consequentia, but immediately presents twenty-two rules to identify them. 
On the face of it these rules seem to run parallel with the standard set 
presented by Ralph Strode, the anonymous author of Logica Morelli and 
others. It is useful to take a closer look at some of these rules, in order to 
ﬁ nd out what role the notion of formality plays in them.
The ﬁ rst rule Wyclif presents seems straightforward enough: a 
consequence is good and formal in which the consequent is formally 
understood in the antecedent. On the other hand, this description is somewhat 
circular, because of the occurrence of ‘formalness’ in deﬁ niendum and 
deﬁ niens. By way of explanation, Wyclif simply gives a few examples, 
one of which runs, ‘Peter is charitable; therefore, he is virtuous.’ The 
reason why this consequence ﬁ ts the bill is because the consequent ‘he is 
virtuous’ is understood in the antecedent18. Here it seems obvious to take 
the expression ‘formal’ as applying to a semantic relationship between the 
signiﬁ cata of the expressions used, such that being charitable implies being 
virtuous because being virtuous is part of what it means to be charitable. 
15 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica I, ed. DZIEWICKI, pp. 42ff.
16 Ibid., cap. 13, p. 43.2-5: «Consequencia est quedam habitudo inter antecedens 
et consequens, cum nota consequencie* [*ed. consequente]. Vel: consequencia est 
quoddam aggregatum ex antecedente et consequente cum nota consequencie.»
17 Ibid., p. 43.12-13: «Et sunt note consequencie ergo, igitur* [*ed. etc.], ideo et 
quare* [*ed. quia].»
18 Ibid., p. 43.6-12: «Ad cognoscendum que sunt consequencie bone et formales 
dantur 22 regule. Quarum prima est hec: Quelibet consequencia est bona et formalis in 
qua consequens formaliter intelligitur in antecedente; ut sic argumentando: Petrus est 
caritativus; ergo ipse est virtuosus, quia hoc consequens, ipse est virtuosus, intelligitur 
in hoc antecedente, Petrus est caritativus.» 

156 
JOKE SPRUYT
In the second and third rules, Wyclif’s take on the formal nature of an 
inference is slightly different. The second rule runs: any consequence is 
good and formal when the contradictory of the antecedent follows from the 
contradictory of the consequent. The following example is given: ‘A man 
is running; therefore an animal is running’, which, the author explains, is 
a good and formal consequence because it formally follows, ‘No animal is 
running; therefore no one is running’19. The corollary of this rule runs: any 
consequence is good and formal when the contradictory of the consequent 
formally conﬂ icts with the antecedent. Hence the following is in order, 
‘He understands everything; therefore he understands something’, because 
the proposition ‘He understands nothing’, i.e. the contradictory of the 
antecedent, conﬂ icts with ‘He understands everything’20. In these examples 
another condition for the formal validity of an inference is introduced, i.e., 
the logical relationship between the signa quantitatis contained in the 
propositions at issue.
In the fourth rule Wyclif returns to the semantic relationships between 
terms featuring in the propositions involved to explain the validity of a 
consequence: Whatever is antecedent to the antecedent, is antecedent to 
the consequent of the same antecedent. This rule vouches for the validity of 
an inference like, ‘Some man is sensing; therefore some body is sensing’, 
given the validity of the inference, ‘Some animal is sensing; therefore some 
body is sensing’. This argument is acceptable because the proposition, 
‘Some man is sensing’ can be antecedent to the ﬁ rst consequent, viz. ‘Some 
animal is sensing’, and therefore it can be antecedent to its consequent21. 
19 Ibid., p. 43.14-18: «Secunda regula est ista: Quelibet consequencia est bona et 
formalis quando ex contradictorio consequentis sequitur contradictorium antecedentis, 
ut: homo currit; ergo animal currit, quia sequitur formaliter: nullum animal currit; 
ergo nemo currit.»
20 Ibid., p. 43.19-23: «Tercia regula est ista: Quelibet consequencia est bona 
et formalis ubi contradictorium consequentis formaliter repugnat antecedenti, ut: 
omnia intelligit, igitur aliquid intelligit, quia ista repugnant: nihil intelligit et omnia 
intelligit.»
21 Ibid., p. 43.24-33: «Quarta regula est ista: Quicquid antecedit ad antecedens 
antecedit ad consequens. Hoc est sic intelligendum quod quelibet proposicio que 
antecedit ad antecedens potest antecedere ad consequens illius antecedentis, ut hic: 
aliquod animal sentit; ergo aliquod corpus sentit; et sic sequitur: aliquis homo sentit; 
ergo aliquod corpus sentit, quia iste propositio, aliquis homo sentit, potest antecedere ad 
hoc consequens prioris consequencie, scilicet aliquod animal sentit, et per consequens 
potest antecedere ad hoc consequens, aliquod corpus sentit.»

 
JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE 
157
The antecedence in question here is of course tied up with the semantic 
connection between the terms ‘man’, ‘animal’ and ‘body’.
The ﬁ fth rule Wyclif mentions is an account of the good formal 
inference a primo ad ultimum. This rule is to the effect that if you argue in 
a series of consequences from the ﬁ rst to the ﬁ nal proposition, and if in that 
sequence of inferences from the ﬁ rst to the ﬁ nal proposition the inferences 
are good and formal and not varied, then the entire inference from the ﬁ rst 
to the ﬁ nal proposition is good as well. The author also mentions a possible 
objection to the rule, by adducing the sophisma-sentence ‘No time is; 
therefore some time is’, which is argued for on the basis of the inferences 
in between, ‘No time is; therefore it is not day’, ‘It is not day; therefore 
some time is’; he counters this objection by explaining that this is not a 
formally good example of an argument a primo ad ultimum, because the 
inferences in between are varied22. He does not in this particular example 
explicitly pass any judgement on the formality and goodness of the 
inference. Instead he seems to be taking the absence of varied inferences 
in between as a condition that is separate from the formality and goodness 
of the inferences at issue.
In his sixth and seventh rules, Wyclif, explicitly refers to a ‘formal 
and good’ inference. The sixth rule simply states that from a universal 
to its subaltern particular an inference obtains (consequentia tenet), both 
afﬁ rmatively and negatively, like in, ‘Every virtue is good; therefore some 
virtue is good’, and ‘No charity is a vice; therefore some charity is not 
a vice’. The seventh rule mentions one condition for producing a ‘good’ 
consequence: to argue from a particular to its indeﬁ nite is good, both 
afﬁ rmatively and negatively, like in the example, ‘Some charity is a virtue; 
22 Ibid., p. 44.10-17: «Alia regula est ista: Quando argumentatur a primo ad 
ultimum, ubi omnes conseqencie intermedie sunt bone et formales et non variate, 
est consequencia bona. Et argumentatur a primo ad ultimum quando consequens 
prioris consequencie est antecedens posterioris consequencie, ut sic argumentando: 
Ordinata dileccio est, ergo caritas est; caritas est, ergo virtus est; virtus est; ergo 
bonitas est. Sed argumentatur contra istam regulam: nullum tempus est, ergo dies 
non est; dies non est, ergo* [*ed. et] aliquod tempus est. A primo ad ultimum: 
nullum tempus est; ergo aliquod tempus est. Ista consequencia non valet, et tamen 
argumentatur per regulam predictam. Ergo regula illa est falsa. Dicendum est quod 
consequencie intermedie sunt variate, quia plus ponitur in antecedente secunde 
consequencie quam fuit consequens prime consequencie. Ideo non argumentatur per 
regulam.»

therefore charity is a virtue’, and in the negative, ‘Some charity is not a 
vice; therefore charity is not a vice’23.
A ﬁ nal example in Wyclif’s exposé of rules is interesting here to take a 
look at, viz.: from the false follows a truth, but from a truth never formally 
follows something false. This rule is tied up with the famous principle 
‘ex impossibili sequitur quidlibet’, which Wyclif presents to us with the 
little verse: ‘From falsehoods a truth, from a truth nothing but a truth’. To 
illustrate this rule the author gives a few examples, such as, ‘Man is an 
ass; therefore God is’, and ‘No god is; therefore no world is’, or from the 
premise ‘No god is’, you could even conclude ‘A world is’, or anything 
you like. These inferences are all valid in virtue of the ‘ex impossibili’ rule, 
he says24. It is noteworthy that this rule is explicitly explained in terms of 
formaliter sequi, but as yet it only features in a negative way: arguing from 
something true to something false is never formally valid. 
What we has just been brought forward is not all Wyclif has to say 
on the issue of reasoning from impossible assumptions. In Logica II 
arguments ex impossibili implicitly come up for discussion again, this time 
in connection with an exposition of conditional sentences.
2.2. Conditional sentences and their truth conditions 
Before we discuss his views on validity in this connection, let us ﬁ rst 
consider what Wyclif has to say about conditional sentences in general.
23 Ibid., p. 44.18-27: «Alia regula est ista: ab universali ad suam particularem 
subalternam, tam afﬁ rmative quam negative, tenet consequencia. Afﬁ rmative, ut hic: 
quelibet virtus est bona; ergo aliqua virtus est bona; negative, ut hic: nulla caritas 
est vicium; ergo aliqua caritas non est vicium. Alia regula est: A particulari ad suam 
inﬁ nitam, tam afﬁ rmative quam negative, est consequencia bona. Ut: quedam caritas

2.2.1. General remarks about conditionals
Conditional sentences are comparable to syllogisms. (Incidentally, for 
Aristotle the syllogism is by deﬁ nition an implication.25) Yet they do have a 
few deﬁ ning characteristics of their own. In his words, «Every hypothetical 
proposition subordinated under a conditioned act26, is a conditional, like 
the following: ‘If you are a man, you are an animal’, as are the others, 
which are commonly called consequences»27.
It is interesting how Wyclif distinguishes conditionals from 
consequences. A consequence he deﬁ nes as «a relationship of truth between 
the consequent and the antecedent, which is included in the signiﬁ cate of 
every true conditional». Hence the expressions ‘ergo’, ‘ideo’, and ‘igitur’, 
and the like, «by connoting causation, posit a consequence that is erroneous 
in form nor matter»28.
Here we see again that inference is deﬁ ned in terms of ‘causation’. 
The thirteenth-century author of a Syncategoremata treatise, Johannes

26 The expression «sub actu condictionato» should be understood in an analogous 
way as in the pair «actus exercitus/actus signiﬁ catus». This distinction is often used 
to explain the difference between an expression that signiﬁ es something, like the 
noun ‘negatio’, and an expression that has a speciﬁ c function, such as ‘non’, which 
is not exactly said to signify, but instead to carry out a negation. In this case then the 
expression «actus condicionatus» refers to the function of a consecutive expression, 
such as ‘si’. See G. NUCHELMANS, «The Distinction ‘Actus Exercitus / Actus 
Signiﬁ catus’ in Medieval Semantics», in N. KRETZMANN (ed.), Meaning and Inference 
in Medieval Philosophy: Studies in Memory of Jan Pinborg, Kluwer Academic 
Publishers, Dordrecht 1988.

est talis: Si tu es homo, tu es animal, et cetere que vulgariter vocantur consequencie […].»
28 Ibid., p. 182.6-15: «[…] quamvis secundum vim vocis habitudo veritatis 
posterioris ad priorem sit consequencia (qualis est in signiﬁ cato cuiuscumque 
condicionalis vere) inter antecedens naturalis prius et suum naturaliter consequens. 
Et hinc patet quod differunt iste note consequenciarum, si, ergo, igitur, et forte omnia

coniuncciones ergo, ideo, igitur, et si que consimiles, connotando causacionen, ponunt 
consequenciam nec in materia nec in forma peccantem.»

Pagus clearly explains the meaning of the expression ‘cause’ in the 
description of inference: it pertains to the relationship of entailment 
between antecedent and consequent, and not to being29. Wyclif too hints 
at what kind of entailment he has in mind here. He says that conditionals 
do not posit a consequence that is erroneous in form nor matter (unlike 
consequences, that is), because the following is necessary: ‘If you 
are an ass, you can bray’30. In this particular example we can identify 
the relationship between antecedent and consequent with the kind of 
causation we have spoken of above, when we looked at the expression 
‘truly real’ as explained by Petrus Thomae. From the nature of one thing, 
i.e., something’s being an ass, truly follows its having the ability to bray. 
What follows from one thing, your ability to bray, is itself something 
positive. An example of something negative following from the same 
antecedent could be what is expressed in a consequent like, ‘Therefore, 
you are irrational.’
2.2.2. On different kinds of entailment
In the previous paragraph, Wyclif only indirectly shows us how he 
conceives of inferentiality. In what comes next, he is a bit more explicit. 
The expression si, the author tells us, sometimes stands for ‘because’, 
and sometimes expresses an absolutely necessary conditional truth. In the 
latter case he distinguishes between a conditionalised truth ut nunc, and a 
conditionalised truth obtaining for all eternal time31.

esse. Vel pro tempore eterno a parte post, ut si ego non sum, nichil fuit.»

 
JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE

This distinction between different kinds of conditionals features in the 
logic of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries too. In his discussion of 
the sophisma-sentence ‘Nichil est verum nisi in hoc instanti’, Matthew of 
Orléans, for example, distinguishes the consequentia ut nunc, which he 
explains as applying to a certain time, as opposed to something’s obtaining 
simpliciter, that is to say applying for any time whatsoever. Taken in the 
ﬁ rst way, the sophisma-sentence is false, because in that case it denotes 
the consequence for any time whatsoever32.
Wyclif’s deals with the conditional simpliciter in a similar manner as 
Matthew of Orléans does, but has his own way of describing the nature 
of these different kinds of conditionals. As an example of the conditional 
ut nunc, Wyclif presents the proposition, ‘If I am in Rome, the false is 
true’; this conditional is true. Its truth is explained in a remarkable way 
by Wyclif: it is a truth of a condition obtaining ut nunc, because, as he 
says, that I should now be in Rome is in conﬂ ict with eternal truth, unless 
anything follows33. The reason for this being the case is that my now not 
being in Rome is a true, negative state of affairs.
Although as such Wyclif’s reference to eternal truth is not surprising, 
given his views on proposition, it seems a bit out of place in this connection. 
What kind of truth is he referring to here? Or is he just talking about the 
truth-condition itself as an eternal truth? The label ut nunc suggests that we 
are dealing with contingency. Yet at the same time necessity is involved: 
my now not being in Rome is a true negative state of affairs, which is 
undeniable, and cannot be explained away.
With regard to the example just mentioned, then, two claims are made: 
ﬁ rst there is such a thing as a truth depending upon a condition obtaining

an Introduction and Notes by J. SPRUYT, E. J. Brill, Leiden − Boston − Köln 2001, III,

autem teneatur [sc.‘nisi’] consecutive, adhuc est duplex, quia hec dictio ‘nisi’ potest 
denotare consequentiam ut nunc vel consequentiam simpliciter. Si consequentiam 
simpliciter, tunc debeat quod falsa est, quia tunc denotat consequentiam pro quolibet 
tempore. Item. In consequentia simpliciter exigitur localis habitudo et illa duo non 
reperiuntur in hac ‘quicquid est verum est verum in hoc instanti’. Si autem denotat 
consequentiam ut nunc, tunc est vera, et est sensus ‘nichil est verum etc.’, idest si 
aliquid est verum pro tempore quod est nunc, est verum in hoc instanti. Et sic non 
denotatur consequentia respectu cuiuslibet temporis, sed respectu temporis quod est 
nunc.»

now, and second, from something which is impossible, and therefore false, 
viz. that I should now be in Rome, anything follows, among other things 
that the false is true. (Incidentally, in this particular example it is not any 
kind of impossibility he is talking about, but simply the impossibility of 
something’s being the case at the very moment it is not the case.)
The second type of conditional he talks about in this connection is a kind 
of conditionalised truth obtaining for all eternal time, e.g. ‘If God is, he wills 
the world to be’, or, as he explains, for an eternal time a parte post, e.g. ‘If I am 
not, nothing has been’34. These two are labelled as consquentiae per accidens.
After making yet another distinction between different kinds of 
consequentiae per accidens and giving some examples of conditionals 
that include a condition under a speciﬁ c form of the verb (subjunctive, 
imperative) and of propositions that imply a consequence35, Wyclif presents 
a division between three main types of truth of a conditional.
2.2.3. On the truth of conditionals
A conditional can be true in three different ways, namely simply and 
absolutely (simpliciter et absolute), per accidens, or ut nunc. The three 
kinds of true conditional have in common not only that they primarily 
signify truth36, but in general a true conditional is such that it is impossible 
that the truth is conditionally assumed unless its truth is conditionally 
deduced, and the other way round. And this is what is usually said that 
a consequence is true when it is impossible for the antecedent of this 
expression to thus primarily signify it is true unless its consequent is true37.

propositionalisme’», pp. 147-150.
37 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica II, cap. 8, ed. DZIEWICKI, p. 183.21-30: 
«Ex istis patet quod tripliciter condicionalis est vera: primo simpliciter et absolute, 
secundo per accidens, et tertio ut nunc. Et omnis condicionalis vera convenit in hoc 
cum qualibet, non solum quod primarie signiﬁ cat veritatem, sed quod impossibile est 
veritatem condicionaliter assumptam esse nisi sit veritas eius condicionaliter deducta, 
et econverso* [*ed. econtra]. Et hoc est quod principaliter solet dici quod signanter 
tunc est consequencia bona quando impossibile est antecedens illius sic primarie 
signiﬁ cantis esse verum nisi suum consequens sit verum.»

 
JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE 
163
The truth conditions of a conditional expression are connected with 
the notions of impossible and necessary. The latter is said in three ways, 
namely simpliciter, per accidens and secundum quid: a simply necessary 
truth is such that in absolutely no way whatsoever it cannot not be the 
case, a truth that is necessary per accidens is such that it conﬂ icts with the 
eternal order that for some given part of time what is expressed by it should 
not be the case, and while a truth that is necessary secundum quid is only 
the case temporarily, nevertheless it conﬂ icts with the eternal order that it 
should not be the case38. Correspondingly impossible is distinguished into 
per accidens and secundum quid: everything that is necessary per accidens 
or secundum quid can not-be, and likewise everything impossible per 
accidens or secundum quid can be39.
2.2.4. On the formality issue as such
In the next part of the chapter Wyclif identiﬁ es a number of rules that 
follow from the considerations he has just presented. What is remarkable 
in his account in general here is how the metaphysics of necessity and 
impossibility enter the scene, as we shall see below. The outcome of his 
account is also worthwhile to look at. Firstly, it clearly turns out that 
with regard to the formality issue, Wyclif disagrees with the well-known 
distinction between material and formal consequence. Secondly, he alludes 
to the failure of relevance issue, that was to become a domain of interest 
later on in the history of logic. And ﬁ nally, some light is shed on precisely 
what he takes a conditional sentence to be, that is, in terms of what exactly 
it is supposed to posit. Let us ﬁ rst look at the rules he presents.
38 This account of necessity is in accordance with Aristotle’s famous rule of De 
interpret. 9, 19a23-24: «That what is, is, when it is, and what is not, is not, when it is 
not, is necessary.» For a detailed analysis, see DE RIJK, Aristotle, Vol. II, pp. 286-288.
39 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica II, cap. 8, ed. DZIEWICKI, p. 183.31-41: 
«Et ita tripliciter dicitur impossibile et necessarium, scilicet simpliciter, per accidens 
et secundum quid. Simpliciter necessarium est quod de nulla potencia potest non esse. 
Necessarium per accidens est veritas quam ordinacioni eterne repugnat pro aliqua parte 
dati temporis eterni non esse. Et necessarium secundum quid quidem solum temporaliter 
est, sed legi eterne repugnat ipsum non esse. Et correspondenter de impossibile per 
accidens et secundum quid. Unde sicut omne necessarium per accidens aut secundum 
quid potest non esse, omne impossibile per accidens aut secundum quid potest esse.»

164 
JOKE SPRUYT
The ﬁ rst rule regarding true conditionals is the following: 
proportionally, just as a conditional is true, so it is necessary, and just as 
it is false, it is impossible, and the other way round40. To this the author 
adds that logicians only accept that a conditional is true if it is absolutely 
necessary. So it is not surprising, he continues, that this rule stays well away 
from any extension of the ‘necessity’ involved in the evaluations of true 
conditionals. By way of explanation, Wyclif lists a number of propositions 
that follow from a speciﬁ c interpretation of ‘necessary’ (incidentally, the 
implications he mentions seem to have to do with the kind of necessity 
attached to the antecedent or the consequent of the conditionals at issue): 
that from something absolutely necessary something necessary per 
accidens follows: e.g. from God is it follows that he wishes the world to 
be, and from this it follows that the world is, and in brief anything else that 
is contingently true. And from this it follows that everything in the future 
will necessarily come about. It also follows that a consequence can be 
posited about impossibles as well, because such an impossible can be true 
per accidens41. After coming up with some other confusions resulting from 
an incorrect take on necessity, he says that therefore we restrict the truth of 
a conditional to the absolutely necessary42.
The next rule he mentions, is that from anything that is false (whether 
insofar as it is signiﬁ ed, or insofar as it is a sign)43, a truth follows, but 
never the other way round. The second part of the rule is expressed in 
a peculiar way: Wyclif says that «Never from something true something 
40 Ibid., p. 184.1-3: «Ex istis patent quedam regule. Prima quod proporcionaliter 
sicut condicionalis est vera, sic necessaria, et sicut ipsa est falsa, sic impossibilis, et 
econverso* [*ed. econtra].»
41 Ibid., p. 184.4-14: «Communitas tamen sophistarum non admittit condicio-
nalem esse bonam nisi fuerit absolute necessaria. Ideo non mirum si regule eorum 
dissonant ab ampliantibus necessarium et impossibile. Nam ex absoluto necessario 
sequitur necessarium per accidens, ut ex deum esse sequitur ipsum velle mundum 
esse, et per consequens mundum esse; et breviter omne aliud verum, quantumlibet 
contingens. Ex quo sequitur quod omne futurum necessario eveniet, non quidem 
necessitate absolutam sed necessitate ex supposicione. Sequitur eciam quod 
consequencia sit ponibilis et de impossibilibus, cum talis impossibilis per accidens 
potest esse vera.»
42 Ibid., p. 185.18-20: «Dimissis ergo istis usque ad ultimum casum, ﬁ at restriccio 
veritatis condicionalis ad absolute necessariam.»
43 As he explains later on, a sign is true when its primary signiﬁ cate is the case at 
some time; see below, note 48.

 
JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE 
165
false follows on the part of reality (ex parte rei), to the extent that it is false, 
because to any such extent, it is simply not the case»44.
2.2.5. On the expressions ‘true’ and ‘false’
Wyclif then enters into a quite detailed description of how to take 
this particular rule, by looking at what precisely is involved in the use 
of the expressions ‘true’ and ‘false’. First of all, as a corollary of the rule 
he just mentioned, he puts forward that a contingent falsehood (falsum 
contingens) can be true, and consequently it can be necessary in a certain 
way. So in truths per accidens, not only from something false something 
true follows, but something necessary will be false and something true will 
be impossible45. From his examples we can gather that he means to say that 
truth per accidens is such that it can change, owing to the change of the 
conditions which happen to be true per accidens. For it can be necessary 
that a stone has killed Socrates, but this can be impossible later on, after 
the stone has been destroyed (because in that case the stone is not there 
any more). And a similar account applies in ‘Something false will be true’, 
and ‘That which at one time is not, will at another time be’, for if this 
is now, then ‘this is’ is false, and if that is, then ‘that is’ is true. Nor is it 
deceitful that if this will then be false or impossible, then that will be, 
because exactly the opposite follows46.
All these cases of change from truth to falsehood and vice versa, 
lead Wyclif to talk about the concepts of ‘nature’ and ‘false’ themselves. 
What exactly is going on when something true changes into something 
44 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica II, cap. 8, ed. DZIEWICKI, p. 184,16-19: 
«Secundo patet ex falso, tam signo quam signato, sequi verum, sed numquam ex vero 
sequi falsum ex parte rei pro mensura pro qua est falsum. Pro omni enim tali mensura, 
ipsum non est.» Once again we are confronted with the idea of ‘truly following’, as 
outlined above, p. 155.
45 Ibid., p. 184.19-23: «Potest tamen falsum contingens esse verum, et per 
consequens necessarium aliquo modo. Unde in talibus que sunt per accidens, nedum 
ex falso ﬁ et verum, sed necessarium erit falsum et verum erit impossibile.»
46 Ibid., p. 184.23-20: «Hoc enim potest esse necessarium iste lapis occidit 
Sortem, et hoc potest esse impossibile post corrupcionem lapidis. Idem ergo in re est, 
falsum fore verum et illud quod aliquando non est aliquando fore, quia si hoc nunc non 
est, tunc hoc esse est falsum, et si illud est, tunc illud esse est verum. Nec est color, si 
hoc tunc erit falsum vel impossibile, quod tunc erit, cum oppositum sequitur.»

166 
JOKE SPRUYT
false? What does it tell us about the ontological status of a falsehood and 
falsehood? Wyclif sides with a point of view brought forward by others, 
who say that what is true is false because what is at one time the case, 
at another time is not the case. Hence it does not follow: this is false or 
impossible, therefore it is not the case; but it does follow that for some 
period in time it is conﬂ icting that that should necessarily be the case. 
However, something is not true and false together at the same time. And in 
this way something false follows from something true, as from, God wills 
the day of judgement to be, follows that it [i.e., the day of judgement] is, 
which is false until now, but true at the time in which it is the case47.
From this explanation it would appear that for Wyclif, the truth of 
what is expressed in a premise must be an ens possibile, even though it 
might not be the case at a given point in time. The only kind of premise 
which cannot be true in any way at all is an impossible simpliciter. In the 
case under consideration, Wyclif takes the antecedence and consequence to 
apply to states of affairs that are or are not the case at a given point in time. 
This also ties in with his remark that a sign is true if its primary signiﬁ cate 
is the case at some time48.
The next two rules Wyclif deals with are the two problematic cases, 
viz. of arguing from something impossible, and of arguing to something 
necessary. It is worthwhile to consider what he has to say carefully, because 
his explanation and examples clearly reveal the author’s ontological 
perspective on inference.
47 Ibid., p. 184.31-41: «Unde aliqui dicunt quod <si> verum converteretur in 
falsum et impossibile, et ipsum falsum habebit esse possibile vel impossibile. Alii 
autem dicunt quod verum est falsum, quia quod pro uno tempore est, pro alio non 
est. Unde non sequitur hoc est falsum vel impossibile; ergo non est; sed bene sequitur 
quod pro aliqua mensura repugnat necessario illud esse. Non tamen simul et semel est 
verum et falsum. Et sic ex vero sequitur falsum; ut ex deum velle diem iudicii esse, 
sequitur illum esse, quod adhuc est falsum sed in tempore suo verum. Et illud reputo 
esse probabile.»
48 Ibid., p. 185.5-6: «Ego autem voco signum verum si suum signiﬁ catum 
primarium est aliquando.» The primary signiﬁ cate of a proposition is identiﬁ ed with 
the state of affairs expressed in that proposition, e.g. the primary signiﬁ cate of ‘Sortes 
est homo’ is Sortem esse hominem. The primary signiﬁ cate is distinguished from the 
secondary signiﬁ cate of a proposition, which in the case just mentioned would be 
Sortem esse animal.

167
2.2.6. The two paradoxical principles
The sixth rule concerning conditional sentences Wyclif mentions here 
is the ‘ex impossibili’ rule: «From anything simpliciter impossible follows 
any conclusion that can be drawn, just as from any antecedent follows 
whatever can be assigned absolutely necessary.» He gives an example of 
the ﬁ rst rule: if it is impossible that you are an ass, you could only be an 
ass if God did not exist, because if the former could be the case together 
with the fact that God exists, then it can be this way, and so it would not 
be impossible for the consequent to be the case49. Via this modus tollens, a 
reductio ad absurdum, it is claimed that it cannot be true at the same time 
that God exists and that you are an ass.
In a ﬁ nal paragraph on the rules he has just presented, Wyclif concludes 
with the corollary of ‘ex impossibili’ rule, viz. that every good inference 
posits that God is. The necessities are chained to each other in such a way 
that if one is posited, it is impossible that the other should be destroyed, 
just as if one impossible is posited, anything else that can be concluded 
formally follows from it50. The ultimate standard for proving these two 
rules is that they follow from the description of a good consequentia 
he had given earlier51, which is tied up with his idea of truly following. 
What Wyclif’s analysis and examples of these two problematic principles 
demonstrate, in my opinion, is ﬁ rst, that by ‘impossibility’ he means a state 
of affairs that simply cannot be the case, that is, something that totally 
clashes with the eternal truth that God exists. If that truth should not be the 
case, then anything, i.e., any state of affairs could be the case too. The latter 
49 Ibid., pp. 185.36-186.2: «Sexto patet quod ex omni simpliciter impossibili 
sequitur quodlibet concludendum, sicut ex omni antecedente sequitur quodlibet 
absolute necessarium assignandum. Si enim possibile est te esse asinum, non potest 
esse quod tu es asinus nisi deus non sit, quia si posset esse cum hoc quod deus sit, tunc 
potest sic esse, et per consequens non est impossibile sic esse; quod tamen datum est. 
Et eodem modo probatur secunda pars regule.»
50 Ibid., cap. 8, p. 186.3-11: «Septimo patet quod omnis talis consequencia ponit 
fomaliter deum esse, et econverso* [*ed. econtra]. Et per consequens necessitates 
sunt sic concathenathe quod posita una, impossibile est quod reliqua destruatur, sicut, 
posito uno impossibili, formaliter sequitur quidlibet concludendum. Si enim quelibet 
talis ponit aliqualiter esse, utputa veritatem signiﬁ catam primarie per eandem, sequitur 
quod quelibet talis ponit primam veritatem esse, ex qua posita, sequuntur due partes 
residue.»
51 See above, p. 157.

168 
JOKE SPRUYT
is a necessary consequence of such an impossibility. Conversely, whatever 
state of affairs might be the case, it cannot possibly lead to the destruction 
of the truth that God exists. So the formal validity of an inference is not just 
connected with the kind of disputational necessity as found in Aristotle52, 
but ultimately resides in a necessary order of the world as willed by God. 
In the previous section, we considered Wyclif’s take on the two 
paradoxes of implication. However, he also sets out to counter the 
common objections against the two controversial rules. These objections 
are interesting to consider, because Wyclif’s response to them indicates yet 
again what his perspective on the nature of inferentiality involves. Let us 
consider these objections and Wyclif’s responses to them one by one.
2.3. Wyclif’s defense of the principles
His ﬁ rst criticism is that according to the «old» rules of logic, no 
conditional posits anything, so from none of them would follow that God 
is. And by the same token, something impertinent would only follow from 
an impossible materialiter; this is what the old rules of logic claim, adding 
that from something impertinent never follows something necessary, 
except materially. Thirdly, many necessities are such that they can not-be; 
because otherwise there would not be an order between them; but if one 
truth is posited, whatever possible truth will be posited53. 
In all three of these objections, the most problematic feature of 
the deﬁ nition of a good consequence appears to be that it can include 
propositions that do not seem to have anything to do with each other. In 
other words, the arguments all relate to the idea that entailment only applies 
to propositions that are relevant to each other on the basis of semantic 
52 For a discussion of Aristotle’s account of semantic or dispositional necessity 
in connection with the ascription of truth-alues to statements about future contingents,

53 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica II, cap. 8, ed. DZIEWICKI, p. 186.14-
21: «Sed contra illud argumentatur primo per hoc quod iuxta antiquas regulas, nulla 
condicionalis quicquid ponit; ergo non ex qualibet sequitur Deum esse. Secundo sic: 
nunquam, nisi materialiter, sequitur impertinens ex impossibili, sicut antique regule 
sumant, addentes quod nunquam sequitur necessarium nisi materialiter ex impertinenti. 
Tercio: multe necessitates possunt non esse, quia aliter non esset ordo inter illas; sed, 
posita una veritate, poneretur quelibet veritas possibilis.»

relationships between the terms involved. In the logic of someone like 
Peter of Spain, there is no room for irrelevance between propositions of an 
inference, because he takes the deﬁ nition of consecutio in terms of causa 
consequendi to express a topical connection between the different terms 
of the proposition. That is why Peter only accepts one kind of case of 
something following from an impossible, viz. if what is said to follow is an 
outcome of the semantic relationships between the terms in the antecedent 
and the consequent54.
Contrariwise, Wyclif thinks there is no reason whatsoever to reject the 
rules as they stand, nor to modify them in such a way as to make room for 
what would qualify as exceptional cases of good inferences. To be sure, 
he partially agrees with the old qualiﬁ cation of a conditional, i.e., that it 
does not posit anything, but assumes that this statement means something 
different than what the opponents of the two ‘problematic’ rules seem 
to think: on Wyclif’s own account, no conditional containing contingent 
extremes (‘extremes’ in this case applies to the propositions involved in the 
inference) posits the other extreme. For example, it is not necessary that 
on the assumption that if you are running you are moving, that either you 
are running or you are moving. However, such a conditional does posit its 
primary signiﬁ catum and all of its causes55, i.e., its (ontologically based) 
truth-conditions.
As to the second objection to the rule ‘ex impossibili’ rule, arguing 
that from an impossible something impertinent can only follow something 
materialiter (as opposed to formaliter, that is), Wyclif explains what it 
means to be ‘impertinens’; in this description Wyclif’s conceptualisation 
of inferentiality is highlighted again. Our author’s response to the objection 
at issue is that nothing is simpliciter impertinent to something necessary 
or impossible, because it conﬂ icts with everything in such a way that it is 
impossible to assign anything whatsoever to it, and everything that is in 
such a way necessary follows from anything. These are the two ways in

55 Iohannes Wyclif, Tractatus de logica II, cap. 8, ed. DZIEWICKI, p. 186.23-30: 
«Ad primum dico quod assumptum non est regula, cum obliquat a veritate. Verumtamen 
cum antiqua sentencia communis non sit in toto falsa, intelligitur isto modo: nulla 
condicionalis de contingentibus extremis ponit alterum illorum; ut non oportet si tu 
movearis te currente quod vel curras vel movearis, quelibet tamen talis condicionalis 
ponit suum primarium signiﬁ catum et omnem eius cuasam.»

which a proposition is called ‘pertinent’ to another, one either because it is 
antecedent to it, or because it conﬂ icts with it. In a word, if A is pertinent to 
B because it follows from B, by the same token B is pertinent to A because it 
is antecedent to it. Pertinence then is a relation of sameness (equiparantia) 
that can be equally founded in antecedence as it can in consequence56. 
In his response to the ﬁ nal argument, Wyclif explicitly addresses the 
nature of formalness involved in the relationship of entailment, and why it 
will not do to talk about material consequences. He explains that it is just as 
incoherent to have a good consequence that is not good in form, as it would 
be to have matter without form; this is to say that inference is inference 
owing to form, and even matter is what it is owing to form. The standard of 
truth and the form by which any other conditional obtains, he says, is the 
following: if of two truths one is impossible to be without the other, then if 
one is, the other is too. Of course one can still make a distinction between 
different forms of argument, viz. substantial, syllogistic, enthymematic 
inferences and inductions, because some inferences obtain that are called 
formal, but they are not called material57. Clearly, the ‘form’ he is talking 
about here is the shape, or the schema of the argument. But no matter what, 
it always comes down to the principle just mentioned: a consequence can 
only be good if it at least obtains according to that form. And this means 
that in order to assess the formal goodness of any inference of logic, it is 
enough that it is an inference and that, from what the primary signiﬁ cates 
of its antecedent and its consequent have demonstrated, it is impossible for 
the one to be without the other58.
56 Ibid., p. 186.31-40: «Ad secundum dicitur quod nichil est impertinens simpliciter 
necessario vel impossibili, cum omni tali impossibili repugnat quodlibet assignandum, et 
omne sic necessarium sequitur ad quidlibet. Et ex istis duobus modis dicitur proposicio 
pertinens alteri: vel quia antecedit ad illam, vel quia repugnat illi. Si enim A est pertinens 
B quia sequitur ad B, per idem B est pertinens A quia antecedit ad A, cum pertinencia sit 
relacio equiparancie eque fundabilis in antecedentia sicut in consequencia.»

JOHN WYCLIF ON THE FORMAL NATURE OF INFERENCE 
171
It now has become quite clear that for Wyclif, unlike the authors of the 
thirteenth century, some logicians of the fourteenth (inter alios John Buridan 
and William of Ockham)59, the expression consequentia formalis indeed 
refers to a logically valid inference, the validity of which is explained in 
terms of the truth condition of the inferential sign ‘si’ only: a consequentia 
formalis is such that the antecedent cannot be true without the consequent, 
and that is it. Wyclif does not need an extra type of inference, i.e., the 
consequentia materialis, because for him, entailment is tied up with being 
in some way or another, and any kind of being, even matter, is what it is 
due to a form (as in forma dat esse). Only impossibilia simpliciter are such 
that they clash with any kind of being whatsoever, and as such they cannot 
possibly be the case. And ultimately, and quite in line with this view, the 
‘ex impossibili’ rule seems to account, in negative terms, for the causal 
connection between antecedent and consequent in entailment.
3. Concluding remarks: rehabilitating the consequentia materialis
If we compare John Wyclif’s account of the formalness of inference 
with what was said about the consequentia formalis earlier on, we can 
see a change in the meaning of the word ‘formal’: from an expression 
more speciﬁ cally tied up with the semantic relationships between linguistic 
expressions (a way in which it was indeed also used by Wyclif, in the 
chapter on consequences, see above p. 157), it has now acquired a use for 
the relationship between propositions as such, viz. the form by which an 
inference is an inference.
However, that is not to say that the original distinction between 
consequentia formalis and consequentia materialis disappeared altogether. 
The paradoxes of implication continued to put logicians on the alert, like 
the author of the Logica Morelli. This ﬁ fteenth-century treatise60, written in 
bonitatem formalem cuiuscumque consequencie logice quod sit consequencia; 
et, demonstratis primarie signiﬁ catis per suum antecedens et suum consequens, sit 
impossibile hoc esse nisi hoc sit.»

the tradition of John Buridan and Ralph Strode, once again recognises (or 
continues to recognise) a difference between these two kinds of inference. 
It is the consequentia formalis which is the default, so to speak: this one is 
described as a good consequence to which the expression ‘formal’ applies, 
because what is expressed in the consequent is formally a part of the 
understanding of what is expressed in the antecedent. The consequentia 
materialis is the odd one out: it is only there to explain the ‘ex impossibili’ 
rule, and the rule ‘ad quodlibet necessarium’.

WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
A 14th-CENTURY DISCUSSION OF LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE
 
Validity
This paper is concerned with problems of deﬁ nition and classiﬁ cation 
of types of valid consequences in the late 14th century1. I will examine the 
discussion of consequences in Peter of Mantua’s Logica (early 1390s) and 
focus on his original way of understanding certain familiar distinctions (ut 
nunc and simpliciter validity; material and formal validity). His theory 
of consequences is an original account that combines elements from the 
English tradition and from the Continental tradition in one eclectic model2. I

Martin for his willingness to discuss at length inseparability and logical consequence 
in medieval logic, and for many insightful comments on the main ideas of this paper. 
All shortcomings are my own. 
1 I shall not deal with parallel issues arising in earlier phases of medieval logic 
that are the object of original discussions, notably in the 12th century by Peter Abelard, 
and in the 13th and early 14th century by Robert Kilwardby and John Duns Scotus.
2 The only existing study of Peter of Mantua’s theory of consequences, to date, is an 
excellent article by M. BERTAGNA, «La dottrina delle conseguenze nella Logica di Pietro 
da Mantova», Documenti e studi sulla tradizione ﬁ losoﬁ ca medievale, 11 (2000) 459-495. 
The article discusses at length some of the distinctions I examine in this paper, leaving 
untouched the issue of latitudo which is what my analysis primarily aims at. A crucial 
point where I also depart from Bertagna’s work is the choice of textual basis. His paper is 
based on one of the two early printed editions of Peter’s Logica that came out in Venice 
in 1492, and does not take into account the manuscript tradition altogether (see f. 3 below 
for bibliographical references). The texts I discuss here, by contrast, are derived from a 
systematic investigation of the manuscript tradition. Although the resulting text is not yet 
in the form of a critical edition, some conclusions can already be ﬁ rmly established: among 
them the fact that a long section at the beginning of the treatise of consequences in all six 
manuscripts of the Logica is entirely missing from the early printed editions. That section 
contains better versions of the deﬁ nitions discussed by Bertagna. The latter might be (i) 
interpolations, (ii) belong to an alternative version of the text absorbed at some stage of the 
transmission by the main version, or (iii) the outcome of an effort of correction in a text that 
contained obvious repetitions and alternative formulations of the same arguments.

RICCARDO STROBINO
shall discuss some fundamental ideas about validity and form, and propose 
an explanation for Peter’s contention that formal validity comes in degrees3. 
The structure of Peter of Mantua’s treatise on consequences has two 
clearly identiﬁ able parts. The ﬁ rst part contains a set of deﬁ nitions (valid 
consequence in general; ut nunc valid consequence; materially valid 
consequence; formally valid consequence) and classiﬁ catory distinctions 
(ut nunc/ut semper, material/formal) along with a number of objections and 
clariﬁ cations. The second part contains a list of general rules and special rules, 
some of which are discussed at great length, and occupies the by-far largest 
portion of the text. I shall be concerned in this paper with the ﬁ rst part only.
At the opening of the treatise Peter gives his deﬁ nition of a valid 
consequence (consequentia bona):
[Validity] A <valid> consequence is a rational or conditional propo-
sition between whose principal parts [i.e. antecedent and consequent] 
there is a relation such that it is impossible for the contradictory of 
the consequent to be the case along with the antecedent, without 
introducing a new signiﬁ cation for one or more terms4.

WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
175
Validity in general is understood in terms of the impossibility of 
the conjunction of the antecedent of a consequence and the negation of 
its consequent, under the implicit assumption that categorematic terms, 
i.e. all terms that are not logical constants, signify as they ordinarily do 
(if they do not signify as they ordinarily do, because a new imposition 
has been made that changes their ordinary signiﬁ cation, then the 
consequence may no longer be valid: in such a case, one would need 
to look at the new signiﬁ cation of the term(s) and establish whether 
the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent is 
impossible or not). 
Thus, Peter’s deﬁ nition assumes that the following holds for any 
consequence Φ of the form ‘p; therefore q’ (rationalis) or ‘if p, then q’ 
(conditionalis):
Ф  is valid      iff     ¬◇(p  ⋀ ¬q) 
(Val)
Ф is a valid consequence if and only if the conjunction of its antecedent 
and the negation of its consequent is impossible. Now, there are three 
fundamental reasons why such a conjunction of two propositions may 
turn out to be impossible. Either (i) the ﬁ rst conjunct (the antecedent) is 
impossible, or (ii) the second conjunct (the negation of the consequent) 
is impossible, or (iii) they are both possible, if taken separately, but 
incompatible with each other:
(i)   ¬◇p    iff    ¨¬p  
(ex impossibili quodlibet)
(ii)  ¬◇¬q  iff    ¨q  
(necessarium a quolibet)
(iii) ◇p, ◇¬q,    but         ¬◇(p  ⋀ ¬q) 
In the rest of the paper, I will refer to cases (i)-(ii) as cases of trivial 
validity, and to case (iii) as a case of genuine validity5. 
est quod non potest contradictorium consequentis sine nova termini vel terminorum 
signiﬁ catione stare cum antecedente eiusdem». 
All texts discussed in the paper are the result of the author’s preparatory work for 
a critical edition.
5 Similarly, in the next section, cases (iv)-(v) will count as trivial, and case (vi) 
as genuine. The distinction between trivial and genuine validity is the only case in 
which I am going to use conceptual vocabulary that Peter himself does not makes 

176 
RICCARDO STROBINO
First distinction: ut nunc and simpliciter
What does ‘impossible’ exactly mean in this context? The answer 
to this question marks the first division between types of valid 
consequences according to Peter of Mantua6. One way is to read 
impossible as impossible per accidens, the other is to read impossible 
as impossible simpliciter. Impossible per accidens propositions 
are propositions that are impossible after a certain moment in time, 
but were possible before that moment, like ‘Adam did not exist’ 
(assuming that Adam actually came into existence at some point). 
Impossible simpliciter propositions are, by contrast, propositions that 
are impossible at all times, like ‘A human being is a donkey’ or ‘God 
does not exist’7. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the notion of 
necessity which can accordingly stand either for necessity per accidens 
or for necessity simpliciter.
Thus, the impossibility of the conjunction of the antecedent and 
the negation of the consequent of a valid consequence can be either 
unconditional, as in cases (i)-(iii) above, or relativized to some time. 
In the latter case, the antecedent and the negation of the consequent 
are neither impossible in their own right nor in principle incompatible 
with each other, but rather one of the following obtains: either (iv) 
the antecedent is impossible per accidens or (v) the consequent is 
necessary per accidens (or the negation of the consequent is impossible 
per accidens, which is the same) or (vi) they are both possible, if taken 
separately, but incompatible with each other from a given time on (i.e. 
not unconditionally): 
use of. I introduce the distinction beetween trivial and genuine validity to reﬁ ne the 
criterion of justiﬁ cation for a ranking of degrees of (formal) validity, which will be 
introduced below. Besides, I believe the distinction is useful in its own right to avoid 
the conceptual confusion that sometimes arises in connection with the distinction 
between material validity and formal validity which one might be easily tempted to 
take as a surrogate of the former.
6 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 85va: «Consequentiarum alia bona 
<ut> nunc, alia bona ut semper». 
7 These are standard examples of propositions that are usually taken to be 
metaphysically impossible.

 
WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
177
(iv) ¬◇i p    iff    ¨i ¬p  
(ex impossibili per accidens 
 
quodlibet ut nunc)
(v) ¬◇i¬q  iff     ¨i q  
(necessarium per accidens a 
 
quolibet ut nunc)
(vi) ◇ p, ◇¬q,    but       ¬◇i(p  ⋀ ¬q) 
According to whether the impossibility in question is of one kind or of 
the other, the ﬁ rst distinction that Peter introduces is a distinction between 
ut nunc valid consequences, as in (iv)-(vi), and ut semper or simpliciter 
valid consequences, as in (i)-(iii). The ﬁ rst class is explicitly deﬁ ned in 
the treatise, while the second class is not, although its deﬁ nition de facto 
coincides with the deﬁ nition of a valid consequence, if we implicitly take 
the relation of incompatibility between the antecedent and the negation 
of the consequent to hold at all times. Peter deﬁ nes ut nunc validity as 
follows:
[Ut nunc validity] An ut nunc valid consequence is a rational 
or conditional consequence such that it is no longer possible for 
the contradictory of its consequent to be the case along with its 
antecedent without introducing a new signiﬁ cation for the terms, 
although at some time it was possible for the opposite of the 
consequent to be the case along with its antecedent8.
A theory that accounts for ut nunc valid consequences relies on 
the fundamental assumptions that the past cannot be modiﬁ ed (nulla 
potentia est ad preteritum), and that a false claim about the past cannot 
possibly be turned into a true claim (per nullam potentiam potest 
veriﬁ cari).
The table below summarizes the ﬁ rst division with the six cases in 
which a consequence is said to be valid.

Second distinction: material and formal
The second distinction that Peter introduces is only internal to the 
class of consequences that are valid ut semper (or simpliciter)9. Those 
are always either materially valid or formally valid. Now, what is it for a 
consequence to be materially valid or formally valid? It is for it to be valid 
and to satisfy an additional condition. Such a condition has to do with how 
consequences having the same form as the original behave with respect to 
validity, that is to say whether they, too, are valid or not.
It is in ﬂ eshing out this distinction that Peter gives his original 
contribution to the theory of consequences in the late 14th century. His 
account combines elements both from the English and from the Continental 
tradition10. Before getting to it, however, let us look at the deﬁ nitions.
9 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 85vb: «Sed consequentiarum simpliciter 
seu ut semper quedam est formalis quedam est materialis».
10 For a comprehensive list see BERTAGNA, «La dottrina delle conseguenze», 
pp. 489-490, ff. 52-53. Sufﬁ ce it to note that by English tradition one should understand 
here a variegated and fairly large group of authors and texts from the early 14th century 
to the second half of the 14th century (including Walter Burley, the Consequentie 
secundum modum Oxonie, Richard Ferrybridge, Ralph Strode only to mention a few 
names). By Continental tradition one should understand a narrower group of auhtors 
mainly active in Paris: most notably John Buridan, who seems to be the originator of 
that tradition and whose inﬂ uence later in the century came to be remarkable in the rest 
of Continental Europe, especially through the works of other “Parisians” like Albert of 
Saxony and Marsilius of Inghen.

 
WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
179
[Material validity] A simpliciter material consequence is a 
rational or conditional proposition (i) between whose principal 
parts there is a relation such that it was, is and will be impossible, 
without introducing a new signiﬁ cation for one or more terms, for 
the contradictory of the consequent to be the case along with the 
antecedent (or one that can be converted with one such proposition 
without introducing a new signiﬁ cation), and (ii) such that it is not 
the case that any proposition having the same form is or may be 
valid without introducing a new signiﬁ cation11.
Material validity is understood as validity plus the condition that at 
least one consequence having the same form as the consequence under 
evaluation be invalid. 
Φ is materially valid  iff
(i) Φ is valid 
(Val)
and
(ii) there is a Ψ such that Ψ has the same form as Φ, and Ψ is not 
valid  
¬(SF)
If we call (SF) the requirement of validity under sameness of form with 
respect to a given consequence Φ (i.e. the condition that all consequences 
having the same form as Φ be valid), then the deﬁ nition of material 
validity is obtained by simply adding to the general deﬁ nition of validity 
the condition that (SF) be not satisﬁ ed, which I express as ¬(SF).
The deﬁ nition of formal validity, by contrast, is obtained precisely by 
adding (SF) itself to the general deﬁ nition of validity:
[Formal validity] A simpliciter formal consequence is a rational 
or conditional proposition (i) between whose principal parts there 
is a relation such that it was, is and will be impossible, without 
introducing a new signiﬁ cation for one or more terms, for the 
11 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 85vb: «Consequentia materialis 
<simpliciter> est propositio rationalis vel conditionalis (i) inter cuius partes principales 
est talis habitudo quod non potest contradictorium consequentis sine nova termini vel 
terminorum signiﬁ catione stare cum antecedente eiusdem nec potuit nec poterit, vel 
que potest esse convertibilis sine nova impositione cum una tali, (ii) cui non valet vel 
valere potest <quelibet sibi> similis in forma sine nova impositione».

RICCARDO STROBINO
contradictory of the consequent to be the case along with the 
antecedent (or one that can be converted with one such proposition 
without introducing a new signiﬁ cation), and (ii) such that any 
proposition having the same form is or may be valid without 
introducing a new signiﬁ cation12.
In other words,
Φ is formally valid  iff
(i) Φ is valid 
(Val)
and
(ii) for all Ψ, if Ψ has the same form as Φ, then is Ψ valid 
(SF)
In the deﬁ nition of formal validity, Peter’s wording in Latin is somehow 
loose, because instead of requiring that all consequences with the same form 
as the original be valid tout court (as is shown in the above reconstruction), 
the second clause requires that they be or may be valid, which seems to allow 
for a scenario in which they are not. If we were to take this seriously, the 
theory itself would lose much of its appeal and interest, as the criterion would 
not give a univocal way to identify the class of formally valid consequences 
(in fact those putative formal consequences would just turn out to be material 
consequences, because whenever (SF) is not satisﬁ ed, then if a consequence 
is valid, it is so only materially). I believe the text should be taken to mean 
that any potential consequence having the same form as the original is valid. 
The potest in the deﬁ nition of formal validity is not there to mean that a 
consequence with the same form as the original may or may not be valid. The 
inaccurate formulation is most likely an effect of deriving the deﬁ nition of 
formal validity from the deﬁ nition of material validity by removing the sign 
of negation from the second clause cui non valet vel valere potest quelibet 
sibi similis in forma to obtain the rather unsettling cui valet vel valere potest 
quelibet sibi similis in forma. How the passage should be read, if the theory 
must make sense at all, seems to be straightforward.
12 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 85vb: «Consequentia formalis 
<simpliciter> est propositio rationalis sive conditionalis (i) inter cuius partes principales 
est talis habitudo quod non potest contradictorium consequentis sine nova impositione

que potest esse sine nova impositione convertibilis cum una tali, (ii) cui valet vel 
valere potest quelibet <sibi> similis in forma sine nova terminorum signiﬁ catione».

181
Third distinction: trivial and genuine
A third distinction, which does not occur in the text but is nonetheless 
useful to understand the picture at a higher level of generalization, is the one 
between what I have called trivial consequences and genuine consequences. 
The distinction cuts across both ut nunc and simpliciter consequences, and 
within the latter class, across both material and formal consequences. In 
other words, there are both trivial and genuine ut nunc consequences; there 
are both trivial and genuine material consequences; and there are both trivial 
and genuine formal consequences. Trivially valid consequences are valid 
consequences that are such either because their antecedent is impossible 
(ut nunc or simpliciter, and in the latter case, either because it expresses a 
metaphysical impossibility or because it expresses a formal contradiction) 
or because their consequent is necessary (ut nunc or simpliciter, and in the 
latter case either because it expresses a metaphysical necessity or because 
it expresses a formal tautology)13. Genuinely valid consequences are valid 
consequences that are such because the conjunction of their antecedent and 
the negation of their consequent is impossible (ut nunc or simpliciter) but 
neither is their antecedent impossible nor their consequent necessary (in 
none of the three aforementioned senses, i.e. ut nunc, metaphysically or 
logically). The impossibility of the conjunction of the antecedent and the 
negation of the consequent depends in this case on some kind of genuine 
relation between the terms involved in the two propositions that makes the 
consequent inseparable from the antecedent. 
Now, when there is a genuine relation between the terms occurring in 
the antecedent and in the consequent such that having the former without 
the latter is impossible, the relation itself may be of different sorts. As we 
shall see shortly, the claim that (formal) validity comes in degrees can be 
satisfactorily explained if it is connected with the idea of classifying the 
types of relations that may hold between the terms in the antecedent and 
in the consequent and rank them according to some plausible criterion of 
increasing (or decreasing) strength.
13 Standard examples are identity statements and their negations. For instance 
‘Tu differs a te’ (‘You differ from yourself’) counts as a paradigmatic case of 
formal contradiction, because it denies a true identity statement, and not merely as a 
metaphysically impossible proposition like ‘A human being is a donkey’ or ‘God does 
not exist’.

The reasons why the distinction between trivial and genuine validity 
applies to both ut nunc and simpliciter valid consequences are obvious once 
we deﬁ ne trivial cases as those in which the impossibility of the conjunction of 
the antecedent and the negation of the consequent depends on the impossibility 
of one of the two conjuncts (i.e. either the antecedent is impossible, or the 
consequent is necessary and hence its negation is impossible), and genuine cases 
as those in which the impossibility depends on the intrinsic incompatibility 
between the antecedent and the negation of the consequent, or equivalently on 
the inseparability of the consequent from the antecedent.
The table below brings together the distinction from the ﬁ rst section (ut 
nunc and simpliciter) and the distinction from the second section (material 
and formal), and lists all types of valid consequences, while making the 
reason of their type of validity explicit:

There are six types of trivial consequences. They are such either by 
virtue of their antecedent being impossible, or by virtue of their consequent 
being necessary. If this is the case only from a given time on, before which 
the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent was 
not impossible, then we are talking about ut nunc valid consequences. 
If, by contrast, the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the 
consequent is impossible at all times, then we are talking about simpliciter 
valid consequences. In the latter case, according to whether the requirement 
expressed by (SF) –i.e. the validity of all consequences having the same form– 
is satisﬁ ed or not, we will have formal or material consequences, respectively. 
Below is a list of paradigmatic examples for each category, taken from 
Peter’s discussion:

God does not exist; therefore, you are disputing
 
Nullus Deus est; ergo, tu disputas
(2) 
You differ from yourself; therefore, a stick stands in the corner

Form under scrutiny
One of the features of the ‘dialectical context’ in the ﬁ rst part of Peter 
of Mantua’s treatise is the presence of several objections and remarks 
concerning sameness of form and validity. It is in this context that his 
reception of elements from both the English and the Continental 14th-
century tradition on consequences becomes evident in its originality. The 
English tradition tends to privilege a characterization of formal validity 
that appeals to the requirement that the meaning of the consequent be 
understood or contained in that of the antecedent (this being the reason 
of the former’s inseparability from the latter). Continental authors, by 
contrast, have a notion of formal validity that focuses exclusively on the 
syntactical structure of arguments and conditional statements (formally 
valid consequences are those that are valid in all terms). As a result, a 
paradigmatic case on whose evaluation the two traditions will strongly 
disagree is that of inferences like
(10) A human being is running; therefore, an animal is running.
 
Homo currit; ergo animal currit
Both traditions would agree that this is a valid consequence because 
the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent is 
impossible. But they would evaluate differently the sense in which it is said 
to be valid. English authors would claim that it is formally valid because 
the consequent is understood in the antecedent. Continental authors would 
claim that it is materially valid because an invalid consequence of the 
same form can be exhibited, which implies that the above consequence is 
not valid in all terms (it can be turned into a formally valid consequence, 
however, by adding to the antecedent the premise ‘All human beings are 
animals’).
Peter of Mantua’s move consists in bringing together these two 
traditions and combining essential elements of both in a new original 

 
WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
185
account15. The spirit of his model can best be captured by the following 
description: fundamentally Continental with an English notion of form. It is 
fundamentally Continental because the distinction between formal validity 
and material validity is grounded on whether a consequence is valid in all 
terms or not. Formally valid consequences are, on Peter’s account, those that 
remain valid for all uniform substitutions of categorematic terms, under the 
assumption that form is preserved; materially valid consequences are those 
that remain valid only for some uniform substitution(s) of categorematic 
terms (i.e. not for all), under the assumption that form is preserved. The 
difference with the Continental approach lies in what should count as 
form. And it is with respect to this central notion that Peter brings in a 
decisive element from the English tradition. In the above example, form 
for Continentals exclusively depends on the syntactical features of the 
proposition. This is why 
(11) A human being is running, therefore a piece of wood is running
 
Homo currit; ergo lignum currit
can qualify as a counterexample against the formal validity of (10), and is 
supposed to show us, in Continental terms, that (10) is just materially valid 
(as is (11), for that matter). 
Peter, however, explicitly rejects this view. According to him, the form 
of a consequence is not merely determined by syntactical features, like 
the type and position of logical constants that occur in it. His notion of 
form is what I shall call a thick notion of form. In addition to syntactical 
features, which remain necessary to determine the form of a consequence, 
there is another factor that needs to be taken into account, namely the type 
of relation holding between terms in the antecedent and in the consequent 
(notably, between the two subject terms and between the two predicate 
terms)16. Between such pairs of terms there may or may not be a connection. 
15 The point is extensively discussed and convincingly argued for in the 
conclusion of BERTAGNA, «La dottrina delle conseguenze», pp. 488-495.
16 We shall assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a consequence of the form ‘if p, 
then q’ or ‘p; therefore, q’ can be analyzed in the most basic case as ‘if A is B, then C is 
D’ or ‘A is B; therefore C is D’, where A, B, C, and D are terms, and that the relations 
we are primarily interested in are those between pairs A-C and B-D, respectively. The 
analysis varies in function of the quality and quantity of the propositions in question 
and of the presence of certain logical constants (such as exceptives, exclusives and the 

186 
RICCARDO STROBINO
If there is no connection, the terms are said to be irrelevant (impertinentes); 
if there is a connection, the terms are said to be relevant (pertinentes), and 
there is also a connection (consecutio) between antecedent and consequent.
The thick notion of form used by Peter instead of the merely syntactical 
notion of form used by Continentals is the result of supplementing the 
latter with considerations about the semantics of the terms involved (to 
put it otherwise, one might think of it as a the result of systematically 
importing topical relations in the process that leads to determining the 
form of a consequence). And such considerations are precisely what lies 
at the core of the English notion of formal validity. Leaving aside the 
case of syllogistic inferences, which does not tell us much given that they 
are regarded by both traditions as paradigmatic cases of formally valid 
consequences17, the watershed between the two is represented by the way 
in which we are supposed to evaluate inferences like (10) and (11).
In addition to providing a justiﬁ cation for the claim that afﬁ rmative 
conditional statements involving, for instance, hierarchically subordinated 
and superordinated terms are formally valid (not just materially valid 
as Continentals would claim), Peter’s account has another effect: by 
deﬁ nition it makes consequences that have a formal contradiction as their 
antecedent or a tautology as their consequent formally valid (not just 
materially valid as English authors would claim). Thus, the modiﬁ cation 
of the notion of form operated by Peter results in a partial rearrangement 
of what counts as materially valid and what counts as formally valid for 
the two traditions. Just as some consequences that are materially valid for 
Continental authors turn out to be formally valid for Peter (in agreement 
with the English tradition), so some consequences that are materially valid 
for English authors turn out to be formally valid for Peter (in agreement 
with the Continental tradition). An example of the ﬁ rst type are inferences 
like (10); an example of the second type are inferences like (2) and (5).
like). We shall not go into details here for lack of space, but it may be useful to keep 
in mind that the conditions for each type of inference are ordinarily laid down and 
discussed in the contexts where general rules and special rules of consequences are 
presented.
17 Syllogistic inferences are not a good test because they satisfy two distinct 
criteria. As a result, even if they are regarded by both traditions as formally valid, it is 
because of different reasons. They are valid in all terms (under uniform substitution of 
categorematic terms) and the conclusion is contained or understood in the premises.

 
WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
187
Degrees of formality (latitudo)
There is yet another aspect, however, that makes Peter’s views on 
consequences interesting. His redeﬁ nition of the notion of form, achieved 
by supplementing the syntactic criteria with considerations about the 
relations between pairs of corresponding terms in the antecedent and in 
the consequent, results on the one hand in making certain consequences 
formally valid that would otherwise have turned out to be just materially 
valid on the Continental account. But it also makes formally valid certain 
consequences that are trivially valid and whose formal features make all 
consequences having the same form valid, as in the case of consequences 
with a contradictory antecedent or a tautological consequent. Therefore, 
the class of consequences that count as formally valid according to Peter’s 
revised notion of form will contain members that are quite heterogeneous 
in nature: conditional claims about genuinely inseparable terms as well as 
conditional claims that are trivially valid without exhibiting any connection 
whatsoever between antecedent and consequent18.
A series of objections and remarks that are put forward in the text 
after the deﬁ nition of formal validity seems precisely to address this sort 
of concern. Two of them prove to be of particular interest. First, against his 
own proposed deﬁ nition of formal validity, Peter considers the objection 
that such a deﬁ nition would vouch for inferences with no connection 
between premises and conclusion (a point the English tradition would have 
been sensitive to):
This consequence is valid ‘A human being is not a human being; 
therefore a goat is disputing’, and yet there is no relation (habitudo) 
between antecedent and consequent, because every relation which 
is a consequence is a connection; but there is no connection in that 
proposition [sc. ‘A goat is disputing’], for it is about terms that are 
irrelevant to [the terms occurring in] ‘A human being is not a human 
being’; therefore, from the latter to the former there is no connection 
(consecutio) nor relevance (pertinentia)19.
18 This is just as true of material consequences, too: some are trivial and some are 
genuine. But Peter does not seem to attend to the fact that this sort of heterogeneity is 
not an exclusive feature of the class of formally valid consequences.
19 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 86va: «Item hec consequentia est bona 
‘Homo est non homo; ergo, capra disputat’ et tamen nulla est habitudo inter antecedens 

188 
RICCARDO STROBINO
An objection of this sort only makes sense from the perspective of a 
theorist who believes that it is wrong to associate the notion of a formally 
valid consequence with cases in which there is no relation or connection 
whatsoever between antecedent and consequent. Second, in the context of 
another objection raised primarily as a pretext for examining more closely 
the claim that form is determined exclusively in function of the syntactical 
features of a consequence (a claim which will be later categorically 
rejected), Peter gives the standard example of consequences that have 
the same form according to Continentals (but not according to his own 
criterion), and makes the following point:
This consequence is valid ‘Terms are individually arranged in the 
same way in one [consequence] as in the other, the quantity, quality, 
and supposition are the same, and any property or mode of signifying 
a term has in one consequence, [the corresponding term in] the other 
has the same; therefore, they have the same form’20. The above 
consequence holds according to those who assume that the form of a 
consequence is determined only with respect to the aforementioned 
[criteria]. They claim that the following consequences have the 
same form: ‘A human being is running; therefore, an animal is 
running’ and ‘A human being is running; therefore, a piece of wood 
is running’21.
How can Peter effectively deal, at one and the same time, with the 
concerns of Continentals about sameness of form, and those of the English 
tradition about the absence of a genuine connection in certain kinds of 
formal consequences (the trivial ones)? As for the Continental objection, 
he simply discards it by putting forward his own revised deﬁ nition of 
et consequens, quia omnis habitudo que est consequentia est consecutio; sed nulla est 
consecutio illius propositionis, quia est de <terminis> impertinentibus ad illam aliam 
‘Homo est non homo’; ergo illius ad aliam nulla est consecutio nec pertinentia».
20 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 86va: «Est similis terminorum 
discretio in una sicut in alia, similis qualitas, quantitas, suppositio, et qualiscumque 
proprietas alicuius termini est in una seu modus signiﬁ candi talis est in alia; igitur, ille 
sunt similium formarum».
21 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 86va: «Tenet consequentia apud eos 
qui ponunt formam consequentie attendi solum penes illa iam nominata, qui dicunt 
has consequentias esse similium formarum: ‘Homo currit; igitur animal currit’, ‘Homo 
currit; igitur, lignum currit’».

189
form, which enables him to argue that Continental counterexamples to 
consequences he regards as formally valid are merely putative, because 
in fact they do not satisfy the requirement of sameness of form once this 
notion is understood according to the new deﬁ nition:
To solve this difﬁ culty, we shall assume ﬁ rst that the formality of a 
consequence is determined with respect to (i) the mutual relevance 
of the terms occurring in the consequent and in the antecedent, (ii) 
their properties and (iii) order. Hence it is clear that the following are 
not consequences with the same form ‘A human being is running; 
therefore, something capable of laughter is running’, ‘A human 
being is running; therefore, a piece of wood is running’, because the 
relevance of the terms is not the same22.
In this passage Peter makes it clear that it is not merely in terms of 
syntactic features that the form of a consequence is determined, but also 
by taking into account the relations holding between the terms of the 
antecedent and those of the consequent. In particular one must look at 
the relation between the two subject terms and at that between the two 
predicate terms in the antecedent and in the consequent. The relations 
holding between the terms of those two pairs are an essential part of the 
form of a consequence. This becomes especially relevant when it comes 
to evaluating sameness of form, for it is a necessary condition for any 
consequence Ψ having the same form as Φ that the relations between the 
terms in Φ be preserved by the terms in Ψ. The above point is therefore 
a piece of criticism leveled against an insufﬁ cient characterization of the 
notion of form which Peter intends to replace with his own thick notion, by 
requiring that all bits of information concerning the relations between pairs 
of terms be taken into account.
As for the objection against the heterogeneity of the class of formally 
valid consequences, and in particular against the idea of including in that 
class consequences that exhibit no relevance or connection between the 
terms in the antecedent and those in the consequent, Peter responds by 
22 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 86va: «Sed pro istorum solutione 
accipitur primo quod formalitas consequentie attenditur penes terminorum pertinentiam 
consequentis et antecedentis ad invicem, et proprietatem <et ordinem>. Ex quo patet 
quod iste non sunt consequentie similes ‘Homo currit; igitur risibile currit’, ‘Homo 
currit; igitur lignum currit’ quia non est similis terminorum pertinentia».

190 
RICCARDO STROBINO
putting forward an elusive claim about the fact that formal validity admits 
of a range of degrees (habet latitudinem).
Secondly, we shall assume that the formality of a consequence comes 
in degrees and that one consequence is more formal than another23.
No explanation is given to substantiate this contention. But if we try to 
spell out the claim that formality comes in degrees, a plausible explanation 
could be given in the following way. All formally valid consequences are 
valid, and formally so, that is to say the conjunction of their antecedents and 
the negations of their consequents is impossible, and any consequence having 
the same form is such that the conjunction of its antecedent and the negation 
of its consequent is impossible. Yet, one might be inclined to think that some 
are valid in a stronger sense than others, despite their being all formally 
valid (i.e. despite the fact that they both satisfy the two conditions for formal 
validity). For instance, a consequence having an explicit contradiction as its 
antecedent or a tautology as its consequent is certainly valid (trivially so), and 
no consequence having the same form will fail to be valid (any consequence 
having the same form will have by deﬁ nition an explicit contradiction as its 
antecedent or a tautology as its consequent). But the pairs of terms involved 
would, most likely24, have no relevance to or connection with one another. 
Consider, by contrast, a consequence that is formally valid because of the 
genuine inseparability of the terms involved. That consequence will be valid 
and any consequence having the same form will also be valid, just as in the 
previous case, but there will be in this case an additional element, namely a 
connection between the terms. And from here one could take the argument 
even further. Not only the existence of a relation of consecutio between 
terms (or, better, a consecutio between pairs of corresponding terms: subject-
subject or predicate-predicate) may justify a higher position in the ranking for 
a consequence of this sort as opposed to consequences exhibiting no relation 
whatsoever, but even within the category of consequences exhibiting such 
23 Peter of Mantua, Consequentie, Ms O, f. 86va: «Accipitur secundo quod 
formalitas consequentie habet latitudinem et una consequentia est magis <formalis> 
[reading formalis with BLM instead of similis in O] alia».
24 Consider cases like ‘Homo est non homo; ergo animal est non animal’ or 
‘Homo est asinus; ergo homo est animal’. Peter does not discuss such examples, but 
it seems that he would nonetheless be committed to regarding them both as cases of 
formally valid consequences. 

 
WHAT IS FORM ALL ABOUT? 
191
relations, one might be inclined to distinguish between stronger and weaker 
degrees of formal validity according to the type of relation involved. For 
example one might want to take a consequence whereby two terms stand in 
the species/genus relation to be stronger than one whereby two terms stand 
in the subject/proprium relation25. 
In the case of (trivially) formally valid consequences having 
either explicit contradictions as their antecedents or tautologies as their 
consequents, the validity of consequences of the same form is guaranteed 
by the fact that the latter will have by deﬁ nition antecedents or consequents 
with the same logical structure, if they are to preserve the form of the 
original. Likewise in the case of (genuinely) formally valid consequences. 
For what is it after all for a consequence to have the same form as a valid 
consequence exhibiting a particular kind of relation between suitable pairs 
of terms? It is for that consequence to exhibit in turn the same kind of 
relation between the corresponding pair of terms occurring in its own 
antecedent and consequent. If the original consequence was valid in virtue 
of a relation holding between its terms, then by deﬁ nition any consequence 
with the same form will be valid in virtue of the same relation. 
The relations between pairs of terms preserved by consequences 
sharing the same form may be of different types. At least two are explicitly 
identiﬁ ed in the context of Peter’s discussion, namely relations between 
terms and their constituents (i.e. terms that belong to the same predicamental 
line26) and relations between terms and non-constituent inseparable terms. 
In the case of a constituent relation, the inseparability of two terms is a 
result of the genuine inconceivability of one without the other, whereas in 
the case of a non-constituent relation27, the inseparability of the two terms 
is only a form of strict inseparability: the two terms are such that one can in 
fact never be taken apart from the other, but it is not the case that one cannot 
be conceived without the other. In the second case there is no containment 
of sense; in the ﬁ rst case there is. Moreover, containment of sense entails 
25 The examples used here make sense against the backdrop of an Aristotelian 
theory of predicables, which in some form or another is presupposed by all the 
accounts I have been discussing. However, nothing prevents the same considerations 
put forward here from applying to theories that allow for other privileged relations 
between types of terms.
26 Expressing, in other words, deﬁ nitional connections.
27 Or any other inseparable accident, to keep the Aristotelian (broadly construed) 
leitmotif going.

192 
RICCARDO STROBINO
strict inseparability but not the other way around. For this reason, the class 
of formally valid consequences associated with the ﬁ rst notion and the 
class of those associated with the second notion may plausibly be taken to 
represent degrees of formal validity of different strength.
In sum, there are at least three senses in which a consequence may be 
formally valid. All senses satisfy the deﬁ nition of formal validity, but they 
do so in three different ways, or in virtue of three different reasons. The 
reason may be either (i) a merely syntactic feature of their antecedent or 
(ii) a merely syntactic feature of their consequent, without there being any 
relation between the terms, or (iii) a genuine relation holding between the 
terms. In the latter case, at least two types of fundamental relations seem to 
stand out as natural candidates: containment of sense and strict inseparability 
(associated in this context with an underlying theory of predicables).
In Peter’s work there is no explicit attempt to draw distinctions 
between degrees of material validity, but the above line of reasoning might 
apply to that class of consequences at least in one signiﬁ cant respect. The 
distinction between genuine and trivial validity offers a way to rank the 
cases in which there is a connection between antecedent and consequent 
above the cases in which no such connection exists (material consequences 
that are trivially valid), although it should be kept in mind that even when 
such a connection exists (material consequences that are genuinely valid) 
this is not the case unconditionally but rather only for some substitution(s) 
of terms. 
Thus, the claim that formal validity comes in degrees can best be 
clariﬁ ed if we look at the variety of relations that may hold between terms 
in the antecedent and in the consequent. It is a classiﬁ cation that relies 
ﬁ rst on the distinction between the existence or non-existence of a relation 
between the terms, which sets trivial consequences apart from genuine 
ones (the latter being stronger than the former), and secondly, when such 
a relation exists, on its strength. The second parameter applies only to 
the class of formal consequences that are genuinely valid. The stronger 
the relation, the higher the degree of formal validity. The following table 
shows how different notions of «following from» can be classiﬁ ed in order 
to achieve an informal characterization of the latitudo (range of degrees) of 
validity for a logical consequence, based on the idea that different notions 
of inseparability may govern the connection between terms occurring in 
the premises and in the conclusions of a valid inference.

Conclusion
The account of logical consequence we can extract from Peter of 
Mantua’s theory of consequentie brings together with originality the two 
main trends developed in 14th-century discussions. It combines elements 
of the English tradition, notably the idea that formal validity is grounded 
on the intuition that the sense of the consequent should be understood 
or contained in that of the antecedent, with elements of the Continental 
tradition, notably the idea that formal validity means validity in all terms 
under sameness of form. As one might expect, given that the deﬁ nitions 
differ in the two traditions, the class of materially valid consequences 
and the class of formally valid consequences will not coincide but merely 
overlap. Peter’s account offers an original way to look at the distinction 
by supplementing the Continental account with a revised notion of form. 
His approach changes quite signiﬁ cantly the spirit of the original project 

194 
RICCARDO STROBINO
by appropriating the idea of relevance (pertinentia) between the terms 
featuring in the antecedent and in the consequent. By looking at the types 
of relations between the terms, we can make sense of Peter’s claim that 
formal validity admits of a range of degrees, and that some consequences 
are more formal (or formally valid) than others.
I have argued that at the lowest level in the ranking are formal 
consequences that are trivially valid, i.e. those consequences that are 
valid either because their antecedents are contradictions or because 
their consequents are tautologies. Above those are formal consequences 
that are genuinely valid. The characteristic of such consequences is that 
they are formally valid because of a relation holding between the terms 
in their antecedents and their consequents. According to the type of 
relation in question, we will either have, at an intermediate level, genuine 
formal consequences in which the consequent is strictly inseparable 
from the antecedent, or we will have, at the highest level, genuine formal 
consequences in which the consequent is conceptually inseparable from 
the antecedent. The reason of the internal division is that conceptual 
inseparability (or containment of sense) entails strict inseparability but 
not the other way around. Consequences that satisfy the requirement of 
conceptual inseparability are therefore those that deserve the crown.

II. Formal Semantics: Issues and Strategies


STEN EBBESEN*
HABITUDINES LOCALES1
13th-Century logic was never «formal» quite in the sense in which 
modern logicians talk of «formal logic». But there was an awareness that 
one characteristic of logic was that one ought to distinguish between a 
theoretic variant (logica docens) and an applied one (logica utens)2, and 
that the entities dealt with in pure logic are not real in the same sense as the 
objects of the natural sciences. In short, that pure logic is about the structure 
rather than about the matter of the arguments of applied logic. About the 
middle of the century it became common to describe logical objects with 
the Avicennian formula intentiones secundae (adiunctae primis) or simply 
as intentiones, though any number of qualiﬁ cations could be added to the 
formula.
The same conceptual framework was used to describe the objects of 
the sub-disciplines of logic. Thus there would be a dialectica docens and 
a dialectica utens3, and the core elements of dialectic would be a certain 
class of intentiones. Not everybody was equally good at keeping theoretic 
and applied logic apart, and not everybody had a developed theory of the

intentiones of logic. One who was good at keeping things apart and did 
have a developed theory was Boethius of Dacia (ﬂ oruit ca. 1270-1275). 
Unfortunately, we only have one of his question commentaries on the 
Organon, but fortunately the one that has survived, his Quaestiones super 
librum Topicorum, is a very mature work –actually, it seems to be a second, 
revised edition4.
In this article I will present some striking features of Boethius of 
Dacia’s theory of the nature of dialectic5. This must function as a stand-in 
for his general theory of logic, which must have shared central features with 
his theory of this particular sub-discipline. True, there are a few statements 
about the subject of logic in the extant œuvre, but the information that «the 
way of knowing and its variants by means of which the various entities are 
known or grasped form the subject of logic»6 by no means sufﬁ ces for a 
reconstruction of the details of his views about logic in general.
A central term in Boethius of Dacia’s theory of dialectic is habitudo 
localis. In the course of this article I shall try to convey an impression of 
what he thought such a «local habitude» is, and at the end of the paper 
I shall investigate the origin of the term. I render localis as ‘local’, but 
‘topical’ would also have done. The adjective indicates that the habitude is

is stated on p. XXV of the edition.

PEDERSEN’s The Tradition of the Topics, pp. 228-230. While I do not disagree with his 
analysis, the focus of mine is different from his. For general descriptions of Boethius

one connected to the loci/τὀποι of dialectic. A habitude is roughly the same 
as a relation, but only roughly. According to the Oxford English Dictionary 
(2nd ed.), this sense of the word is obsolete; the last occurrence quoted in 
the dictionary is from Berkeley and dated 1732. However, I propose to 
revive the use of ‘habitude’ to render the medieval technical term habitudo.
Unsurprisingly, the very ﬁ rst question in Boethius of Dacia’s 
commentary on Aristotle’s Topics is «Whether dialectic is a science» 
(Utrum dialectica sit scientia). Here is his determination7:
The correct answer is that dialectic is a science –a science that provides 
knowledge about how to argue constructively or destructively for or 
against the attribution of any predicate whatsoever in any matter 
whatsoever on the basis of probable signs which habilitate the 
subject to participate in the predicate without necessitating this (as 
will appear below). So, in spite of the fact that a conclusion reached 
by means of a dialectical syllogism is not as such known but only 
believed in and not necessary, yet the art through which one knows 
how to syllogize dialectically on the basis of probable signs is a 
science and both certain and necessary.
In the answer to the ﬁ rst ratio in contrarium, he makes clear that it is 
dialectica docens that is a genuine science, genuine knowledge8:
Dialectica docens proceeds from necessary principles, but dialectica 
utens (i.e. dialectic applied to do a job) proceeds from probable 
<assumptions>, for in so far as it is applied to do a job, it is applied 
to some special matter and syllogizes on the basis of probable signs 
belonging to that matter. This is why dialectic produces opinion and 
not certain knowledge about speciﬁ c things.
7 Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top. I.1.25-32, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN – PINBORG, 
p. 12: «Solutio: Dicendum est quod dialectica est scientia qua scitur quomodo 
quodlibet praedicatum est construendum et destruendum in qualibet materia ex 
signis probabilibus, quae habilitant subiectum ad participationem praedicati et non 
necessitant, sicut patebit inferius. Unde, licet conclusio per dialecticum syllogismum 
conclusa in quantum talis non sit scita sed opinata et non necessaria, ars tamen per quam 
scitur dialectice syllogizare ex signis probabilibus est scientia certa et necessaria.»
8 Ibid. I.1.38-44, p. 13: «dialectica docens procedit ex principiis necessariis, sed 
dialectica utens, seu secundum quod applicatur ad opus, tunc applicatur ad aliquam 
materiam specialem, quam syllogizat ex signis probabilibus illius materiae. Et ideo 
dialectica de rebus specialibus facit opinionem et non certam scientiam.»

STEN EBBESEN
To the objection that dialectic cannot be a science because it is about 
none of the standard sorts of entity (natural, mathematical, divine, moral), 
Boethius replies9:
Dialectic is about a sort of entity, viz. the way in which a thing can 
be known by means of probable <assumptions> and signs of the 
thing in question, and this way of knowing is a sort of entity in an 
extended sense of the word ‘entity’, even though it is none of the 
entities on which you base your argument.
The promise to elucidate the somewhat obscure talk about «probable 
signs» in the ﬁ rst quotation, above, is redeemed in question 210:
It should be understood that it belongs to the dialectician as such 
to consider the structural traits (rationes) that accrue to things, 
i.e. those common intentions that are the foundations of the local 
habitudes (habitudines locales) by means of which the dialectician 
corroborates his arguments, i.e. the intentions of genus and species, 
cause and effect, relatives, contraries, etc. And since, obviously, 
those intentions are found in all things, […] the result is that 
dialectic is a common science and that the dialectician can argue 
in every discipline and every matter. However, as those common 
intentions from which the dialectician derives his arguments are 
not the cause of the conclusions which he concludes in speciﬁ c 
sciences, but <mere> signs, the dialectician cannot have certain 
knowledge about such conclusions, but <just> opinion. For without 
9 Ibid. I.1.52-56, p. 13: «dialectica est de aliquo ente, scilicet de modo quo 
cognosci potest res per probabilia et signa illius rei, et iste modus cognoscendi est 
aliquod ens extenso nomine entis, licet sit nullum entium ex quibus tu arguis.»
10 Ibid. I.2.25-42, pp. 14-15: «intellegendum est, quod dialecticus per se habet 
considerare rationes, quae rebus accidunt, videlicet istas communes intentiones, 
in quibus fundantur habitudines locales, per quas dialecticus suas argumentationes 
conﬁ rmat, scilicet intentionem generis et speciei, causae et effectus, relativorum, 
contrariorum et ceteras tales intentiones. Et quia istae intentiones in omnibus rebus 
sunt, ut de se patet […] ex hoc contingit quod dialectica est scientia communis et quod 
dialecticus potest arguere in omni arte et in omni materia. Quia tamen istae communes 
intentiones ex quibus dialecticus argumenta sua sumit non sunt causa conclusionum 
quas concludit in scientiis specialibus, sed signa, ideo dialecticus de his conclusionibus 
certam scientiam habere non potest, sed opinionem. Sine causis enim non est scire, sed 
sine eis bene contingit opinari.»

 
HABITUDINES LOCALES 
201
causes one cannot know, but it is perfectly possible to entertain an 
opinion without them.
The intentions are not causes of conclusions because intentions are 
not constituents of real things. There is an order: (1) things (res) with their 
ways of being (modi essendi), (2) common intentions, (3) local habitudes11:
First comes the thing itself, second the common intention founded on 
things, third the local habitude. And because of various ways of being (or 
various natures) of the thing, the thing contains various common intentions 
and local habitudes, which are signs of various dialectical consequences12 
from this thing to those things and from other things to this thing.
At ﬁ rst glance, this passage might seem to make the intentions internal 
to things in the same way that the modi essendi are, but this is not what 
Boethius wants to say. In question I.5 he discusses what is the cause of 
entailment in (1) Socrates is a man, therefore he is an animal and (2) 
Socrates is white, therefore he is not black. The cause of entailment in (1) 
is not the habitude of species to genus and genus to species, but the fact 
that man is inseparable from animal, and similarly with (2) the cause is not 
the common intention of contrariety and the local habitude of contrary to 
contrary, but the fact that white and black are incompossible. De facto, the 
relevant intentions and habitudes always accompany their things, but they 
are separable in thought13:
11 Ibid. I.7.17-22, p. 28: «primo est res ipsa, secundo est ipsa communis intentio 
fundata in rebus; tertio est habitudo localis. Et propter diversum modum essendi 
(sive propter naturas diversas rei) habet res in se diversas communes intentiones et 
habitudines locales, quae sunt signa diversarum dialecticarum consequentiarum huius 
rei ad illas res et aliarum rerum ad hanc rem.»
12 ‘Consequences’ here means «relations of following», which, however, in 
medieval terms is a habitudo rather than a relatio. Hence my choice of the clumsy 
loan-translation.
13 Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top. I.5.67-78, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN – PINBORG, pp. 22-
23: «licet enim res signiﬁ catae per hoc quod est ‘album’ et ‘nigrum’ numquam sint sine 
communi intentione contrarietatis et sine habitudine locali contrarii ad contrarium, 
ipsa tamen natura rerum et ipsa habitudo localis non sunt idem, sed sunt aliud et 
aliud. Circumscripta per intellectum communi intentione et habitudine locali contrarii 
ad contrarium a rebus signiﬁ catis per hos terminos ‘album’ et ‘nigrum’, adhuc esset 
consequentia bona ‘hoc est album, ergo non est nigrum’, eo quod naturae istarum 
rerum incompossibiles sunt. Et ex hoc apparet, quod communis intentio et habitudo 
localis contrarii ad contrarium non sunt causa huius consequentiae, quia illud non est 
causa, quo ablato adhuc remanet effectus.»

STEN EBBESEN
Although the things signiﬁ ed by ‘white’ and ‘black’ never are 
without the common intention of contrariety or without the local 
habitude of contrary to contrary, the nature of the things and the local 
habitude are not identical, but distinct. If, as a thought experiment, 
we were to pretend that no common intention or local habitude of 
contrary to contrary were connected to the things signiﬁ ed by the 
terms ‘white’ and ‘black’, ‘This is white, therefore it is not black’ 
would still be a good consequence, because the natures of those 
things are incompossible. This shows that the common intention 
and the local habitude of contrary to contrary are not the cause 
of this consequence, for what can be removed with the effect still 
remaining is not a cause.
Why is it permissible to counterfactually disregard the intentions and 
habitudes? Obviously because they are entia rationis, and not intrinsecally 
linked to things the way the things’ modi essendi are. So obviously that 
Boethius of Dacia did not feel he had to make a point of the fact.
Now, the «ways of being» or «properties» which are the real 
counterparts of the intellect’s intentiones, play a central role not only in 
Boethius of Dacia’ attempt to anchor dialectic in reality, but also in his 
attempt to do the same to grammar, and he was perfectly aware of this. 
In his Questions on Priscian Major, more commonly known as Modi 
Signiﬁ candi, he repeatedly points out the parallelism between the way 
the building blocks of grammar, the «ways/modes of signifying» (modi 
signiﬁ candi) and the dialectician’s local habitudes are derived from real 
properties14. In qu. 19 he directly asks «whether the dialectician derives his 
local habitudes and the grammarian his ways of signifying from the same 
real properties» (utrum eaedem in re sint proprietates a quibus dialecticus 
accipit habitudines locales et grammaticus modos signiﬁ candi). The 
answer is a qualiﬁ ed «Yes»: some intentions and habitudes and some ways 
of signifying share a foundation in the same property, as is the case with 
the dialectician’s universal and the grammarian’s mode of signifying of an 
appellative noun. Other items in the tool-boxes of the dialectician and the 
grammarian cannot be matched the same way.
The parallelism between grammar and dialectic may then be depicted 
as follows:
14 See in particular Boethius Dacus, Modi Signiﬁ candi, qu. 17-19, ed. PINBORG, 
pp. 62-71.

 
HABITUDINES LOCALES 
203
(1) proprietates in re ¨ (2) modi intelligendi ¨ (3) modi signiﬁ candi
(1) proprietates in re ¨ (2) intentiones communes ¨ (3) habitudines 
locales
The transition from (1) to (2) is where the ﬂ exibility of the human 
mind shows itself, as it may interpret the same property correctly in 
more than one way and apply the resulting understandings for different 
purposes. The items labelled (3) are the fundamental primitive terms of 
the respective disciplines. The grammarian «teaches how to express an 
intended conceptual content of the mind in congruous speech, irrespective 
of subject matter»15, and he does so by formulating rules that spell out 
which combinations of ways of signifying will produce congruity. 
The dialectician «teaches how to argue dialectically, i.e. on the basis of 
probable <assumptions>» and as such it is a special science, «but as this 
dialectical way of arguing is common to just any matter and all things […] 
in this respect dialectic is a common science»16. Boethius does not say 
much about maxims except that they corroborate (conﬁ rmant) arguments17, 
but he would probably have agreed that they are the dialectician’s rules, 
which spell out how a good dialectical argument may be structured. As 
Radulphus Brito was to say in the 1290s18:
15 Ibid., qu. 7.106-108, p. 32: «Docet ergo grammatica modum exprimendi 
conceptum mentis intentum per sermonem congruum in omni materia».
16 Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top. I.2.18-24, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN – PINBORG, p. 
14: «dialectica quantum ad scibile, quod ipsa docet, est scientia specialis; docet enim 
aliquod scibile speciale sicut modum arguendi dialectice sive ex probabilibus. Quia 
tamen iste modus arguendi dialectice communis est omni materia et omnibus rebus, 
[…] secundum istum modum dialectica est communis scientia.»
17 Thus Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top. II.6.13-20, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN –PINBORG, 
p. 120: «idem in re est dignitas, communis animi conceptio et maxima propositio; sed 
dicitur dignitas propter suam evidentiam […] Communis animi conceptio dicitur quia 
communiter quilibet intellectus, nisi fuerit febre ignorantiae inﬁ rmus, sibi consentit. 
Dicitur autem maxima propositio propter suam maximam potestatem quam habet in 
omnibus aliis conﬁ rmandis.»
18 Radulphus Brito, Quaestiones super libro Topicorum Boethii, qu. II.2, Ed. by 
N. J. GREEN-PEDERSEN, Cahiers de l’Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin, 26 (1978) 
1-92, pp. 26-27: «Et dico quod locus maxima et differentia maximae differunt, sicut 
satis visum est, quia maxima est propositio explicans habitudinem termini ad alterum, 
ut visum est. Sed differentia maximae est habitudo termini ad terminum ut conﬁ rmans 
argumentum. Modo ista differunt sicut explicans et explicatum.»

204 
STEN EBBESEN
A maxim is a proposition that explicates the habitude of one term to 
another […], but a difference of a maxim is the habitude of one term 
to another in so far as it corroborates an argument. Now these two 
differ in that one is explicating, the other what is explicated.
A key feature of the dialectician’s habitudes is their relational 
character19:
As those common intentions are relational (respectivae), because 
one belongs to a thing as compared to another thing and vice versa 
–for the intention of genus does not belong in an absolute way to 
some thing, but in so far as it is compared to another thing, of which 
it is the genus, and similarly with all other intentions– therefore the 
local habitudes, which are founded on those common intentions, 
are relative (respectivae), for a local habitude is never founded 
on something in an absolute way. And because a habitude is just 
that of one thing to another, therefore consequence is founded on a 
habitude.
Notice that Boethius avoids the use of the word relatio. He clearly did 
not want the habitudes to be burdened with all the problems that attach to 
the relations of Aristotle’s Categories.
But if habitudes and intentions are derived from real properties, 
how can the dialectician avoid being involved in metaphysical 
considerations, and how can he, without straying into the domain 
of metaphysics or natural science use his understanding about the 
habitude of contrary to contrary to form an argument of the type: ‘This 
is hot, therefore this is not cold’? And he certainly must not trespass 
on the grounds of other sciences. Boethius of Dacia understood the 
Aristotelian theory of science to imply that there must be watertight 
bulkheads between any two sciences, unless one be a subordinate of 
19 Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top., Prooemium, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN – PINBORG, 
pp. 202-210, pp. 10-11: «Et quia illae communes intentiones sunt respectivae, quia 
una debetur rei in comparatione ad aliam et e converso – intentio enim generis non 
competit alicui rei absolute, sed in comparatione ad alteram rem, cuius est genus, et 
eodem modo dicendum est de omnibus aliis – ideo habitudines locales, quae fundantur 
in illis communibus intentionibus, respectivae sunt; numquam enim habitudo localis 
in aliquo absolute fundatur. Et quia habitudo non est nisi unius ad alterum, ideo in 
habitudine fundatur consequentia.»

the other, and similarly between science/knowledge and belief. This 
fundamental principle is neatly summed up in a sentence that he repeats 
on several occasions20:
Nullus artifex potest concedere aliquid vel negare nisi ex principiis 
suae scientiae.
No specialist can concede or deny anything except on the ground of 
the principles of his own science.
Boethius of Dacia’s solution of apparent violations of the principle is 
that several sciences may well be mastered by one and the same person, 
but he just should not mix up his role as a metaphysician with his role as a 
dialectician, for instance. Qua dialectician he may take over some insights 
that he has reached as a metaphysician, but he could not possibly have 
reached those insights by doing dialectic. The theme is a recurrent one in 
Boethius’ works.
Thus in question 27 of book I on the Topics he asks whether it is 
the dialectician’s task to establish the division into ten categories. Since 
Aristotle introduces the tenfold division in Topics I.9, this might seem to 
be the case. But no21:
Qua dialectician, the dialectician only considers categorial things 
per accidens and distinguishes between them, in order that based 
on the things and their properties he may grasp the local habitudes 
and the intentions themselves, the maxims, axioms and common 
conceptions of the mind, all of which he considers per se, but the 
things themselves only per accidens.
Just in case my readers start to wonder whether Boethius is not here 
introducing a dangerous multiplicity of objects for the dialectician to 
20 Here quoted from Boethius Dacus, Quaestiones De generatione et corruptione,

21 Boethius Dacus, Quaest. Top. I.27.26-31, ed. GREEN-PEDERSEN –PINBORG, p. 72:

distinguit, ut ex rebus et earum proprietatibus cognoscat habitudines locales et ipsas 
intentiones, maximas propositiones, dignitates et communes animi conceptiones; et 
haec omnia per se considerat, res autem ipsas per accidens.»

STEN EBBESEN
study, he elsewhere makes clear that he considers ‘maxims’, ‘axioms’ and 
‘common conceptions of the mind’ to be referentially equivalent22.
The importance of the nullus artifex principle is spelled out even 
more clearly in question I.4 on the Topics, where it is asked whether a 
dialectician can study any speciﬁ c thing (utrum dialecticus consideret rem 
specialem). The answer, of course, is a «No!», though with qualiﬁ cations23:
It is not the dialectician’s job qua dialectician to contemplate speciﬁ c 
things, for any speciﬁ c thing, be it mathematical, natural or divine, 
pertains to some specialist together with everything whatever that is 
in any way an attribute of that thing. As such, it is the dialectician’s 
proper job to contemplate those common intentions and local 
habitudes by means of which he corroborates his arguments, but 
because those common intentions and local habitudes do not 
have their foundation anywhere but in things, for this reason the 
dialectician can in some way and per accidens contemplate the 
natures of speciﬁ c things. However, he does not do this in his capacity 
of dialectician but in so far as he is simultaneously a philosopher. 
It thus results that when actually presenting an argument the 
22 See ibid. II.6.13-20, p. 120, quoted in note 17, above.
23 Ibid. I.4.15-42, pp. 17-18: «Dicendum quod dialecticus secundum quod 
dialecticus per se res speciales considerare non habet; omnis enim res specialis sive 
sit mathematica sive naturalis sive divina pertinet ad aliquem artiﬁ cem specialem, et 
omnia, quaecumque attri buuntur illi rei, quicumque fuerit ille modus attributionis. 
Dialecticus autem per se habet considerare illas communes intentiones et habitudines 
locales, per quas argumenta sua conﬁ rmat. Et quia istae communes intentiones et 
habitudines locales non fundantur nisi in rebus, ideo dialecticus aliquo modo habet 
considerare naturas rerum specialium per accidens. Hoc autem non facit in quantum 
dialecticus, sed in quantum simul cum hoc est philosophus. Ex hoc apparet, quod 
dialecticus arguens debet esse dialecticus et philosophus. Debet enim esse dialecticus, 
ut possit considerare communes intentiones et habitudines locales, per quas suum 
argumentum conﬁ rmat, et probabilitatem sua rum propositionum, quas adducit. Sed 
philosophus debet esse, ut sciat naturas rerum, quae signiﬁ cantur per terminos, utrum 
scilicet sibi debeatur talis communis intentio vel alia. Si enim ignoraret naturam huius 
rei, quae per hoc quod est ‘homo’ signiﬁ catur, et naturam huius rei, quae per hoc quod 
est ‘animal’ signiﬁ catur, non posset scire, quod ei, quod est homo, debetur intentio 
speciei et non generis, et ei, quod signiﬁ catur per hoc quod est ‘animal’, intentio 
generis et non speciei. Unde cum dialecticus sic arguit ‘Socrates est albus, ergo non est 
niger’, nullo modo posset scire hoc esse bonum argumentum, nisi sciret naturas rerum, 
quae signiﬁ cantur per hos terminos, esse incompossibiles et esse tales, quod positio 
unius in aliquo subiecto est remotio alterius ab eodem».

dialectician must be both a dialectician and a philosopher. He must 
be a dialectician in order to be able to contemplate the common 
intentions and local habitudes by means of which he corroborates 
his argument, and the probability of the premisses that he adduces, 
but he must be a philosopher in order to know the natures of the 
things signiﬁ ed by the terms <in his argument>, whether, that is, 
such or such an intention matches them. For if he did not know the 
nature of the thing that is signiﬁ ed by ‘homo’, and the nature of the 
thing that is signiﬁ ed by ‘animal’, he could not know that it is the 
intention of species, and not of genus, that matches man, or that it 
is the intention of genus, and not of species, that matches what is 
signiﬁ ed by ‘animal’. So when the dialectician argues ‘Socrates is 
white, therefore he is not black’, he would have no way to know that 
this is a good argument unless he knew that the natures of the things 
signiﬁ ed by those terms are incompossible and such that positing 
one of them in some subject entails the removal of the other from it.
In spite of Boethius of Dacia’s constant moving forth and back between 
the pure dialecticus docens and dialecticus utens, the main point is clear, 
I submit. Pure dialectic is a science about such common intentions as 
contrariety and such and local habitudes as that of contrary to contrary. 
Apart from syncategoremes, names for these relational entia rationis and 
some other logical words, like ‘is predicated’, the axioms and theorems 
of a dialectician’s science may not contain anything but placeholders like 
‘whatever’. As soon as you replace a ‘whatever’ with a word with genuine 
content, you are leaving the sphere of dialectic and only get the right result if 
you know about the thing signiﬁ ed by the word you use in your instantiation.
Boethius of Dacia does, however, leave an inconsistency which he 
could easily have weeded out. In the passage just quoted, he assigns to the 
dialectician as such the ability to judge the probability of the premisses of 
a dialectical argument. But that presupposes the sort of knowledge about 
the terms of an actual argument that the dialectician is not supposed to have 
qua dialectician. This slip was to have unfortunate consequences.
A generation after Boethius of Dacia, Radulphus Brito in question 
I.19 of his Questions on Aristotle’s Topics asks «Whether dialecticus utens 
can judge the truth of propositions framed in speciﬁ c terms»24. In the 
24 Radulphus Brito, Quaestiones super Topica Aristotelis, qu. II.19, Ms Paris,

determination he mentions two views, both of which he rejects: (1) that 
there is no way a dialectician can judge the truth of such propositions, (2) 
that an artifex mixtus can do so25:
Others say that someone who is a mixture of a dialectician and a 
specialist can judge the truth of propositions framed in speciﬁ c 
terms, for in his capacity of dialectician he knows about second 
intentions, and in his capacity of specialist he knows about the 
terms, and thus someone who is a mixture of a dialectician and a 
specialist can know about and judge the truth of propositions framed 
in speciﬁ c terms.
View (2) is Boethius of Dacia’s and leaves pure dialectic free to say 
nothing about any actual thing. Radulphus could have adopted view (2) 
and rectiﬁ ed Boethius of Dacia’s slip by denying (3) that a dialectician 
as such can judge the probability of premisses containing categorematic 
terms. Instead he chose to reject (2) and support (3), although in a rather 
woolly fashion26:
The dialectician cannot properly judge the truth of propositions 
framed in speciﬁ c terms, but he can estimate their truth
Admittedly, Radulphus links the dialectician’s ability to estimate the 
truth-value of such propositions to his being the sort of dialectician that, 
Radulphus thinks, Aristotle has in mind in his Topics, namely one «who 
deals with the dialectical syllogism with a view to its use and application»27. 
25 Radulphus Brito, Quaest. Topica Arist., qu. II.19, Ms Paris, BnF, lat. 11132, 
f. 18rB: «Item alii dicunt quod artifex mixtus ex dialectico et artiﬁ ce speciali potest 
iudicare veritatem in propositionibus factis in terminis specialibus, quia in quantum 
est dialecticus cognoscit intentiones secundas, sed in quantum est artifex spe cialis 
cognoscit terminos; et sic artifex mixtus ex dialectico et alio artiﬁ ce speciali potest 
cognoscere et iudicare verita tem in propositionibus specialibus.»

propositionibus factis in terminis specialibus aestimare.»

This still leaves the way open for him to operate with a pure dialectic 
and a pure dialectician, but he seems not to have been really interested 
in Boethius of Dacia’s quest to reserve a place for disciplines that do not 
care about content. Part of the explanation may be that his own theory of 
intentions links second intentions rather strongly to real things –but that is 
not a matter I can discuss here. 
I know of no later author who either follows in Boethius of Dacia’s 
footsteps or even polemicizes against him. It looks as if he was a lone wolf.
Appendix. The origin of the term habitudo localis.
The word habitudo is fairly common in 13th-century logic, and often 
it is little but a stylistic variant of relatio28, but it is particularly common 
in contexts in which the author has reasons to avoid importing all the 
problematic properties of Aristotelian relatives. Thus people will speak 
about the habitudo of accidents to substances and the habitudo that links 
each sense of an analogous term to the common core29. Similarly, in a 
p. 2: «Ulterius intellegendum est quod differenter determinatur hic de loco et in Topicis 
Aristotelis, quia hic determinatur de loco secundum suam essentiam, sed in Topicis Aris-
totelis quantum ad sui usum et applicationem, ut applicatur ad terminandum problemata de 
quattuor praedicatis. Et propter hoc apparet quare hic vocantur loci et in libro Aristotelis 
considerationes, quia in Topicis Aristotelis determinatur de eis quantum ad suum usum et 
applicationem, et ‘consideratio’ magis nominat illud quod est in usu et applicatione; sed hic 
vocantur loci quia hic determinatur de eis quantum ad eorum essentiam.»
28 E.g., Petrus de Alvernia, Quaestiones super Metaphysicam, qu. V.27, Ms 
Cambridge, Peterhouse 152, f. 181rB-vA, Oxford, Merton 292, f. 295rB: «Dicendum 
quod relationem necesse est esse ens. Et hoc apparet primo sic: quando illud ex quo 
causantur alia quaedam entia secundum quod huiusmodi oportet esse aliquod ens; 
sed ex ipsa relatione causantur alia quaedam entia, puta actio et passio, situs, habitus, 
quando et ubi. Omnia enim ista consistunt in relatione unius ad alterum, vel saltem 
derelinquuntur {-itur codd.} ex tali relatione vel habitudine. Quare manifestum est 
quod relatio est aliquod ens.»

by S. EBBESEN, DSL – Gad, Copenhagen 1977 (Corpus Philosophorum Danicorum 
Medii Aevi VII), pp. 270-271: «ubicumque aliqua duo analogice continentur sub 
aliquo tertio posterius habet deﬁ niri per habitudinem ad prius, sicut accidens deﬁ nitur 
per habitudinem ad substantiam, et sanum in urina vel diaeta per habitudinem ad 
sanitatem animalis. Syllogismus autem dialecticus non deﬁ nitur per habitudinem ad 
demonstrativum, nec e converso.»

conjunctive proposition, et may be said to express a habitudo that links the 
conjuncts30. In a discussion of whether inherence is essential to accidents, 
Radulphus Brito on one occasion carefully distinguishes habitudo from 
relatio, making the former the genus of the latter31:
<Ratio principalis> Item, inhaerentia est relatio, quia est habitudo 
quae dicitur ad alterum; sed relatio non est de essentia accidentis; 
probatio quia octo sunt genera accidentis absoluta; ergo inhaerentia 
non est de essentia accidentis.
<Ad rationem> Ad aliud, cum dicitur quod inhaerentia non est de 
essentia accidentis, et etiam <quod> sit quaedam relatio et quaedam 
habitudo, dico quod duplex est habitudo: quaedam est ad aliud 
tamquam ad terminum, et talis est relatio; alia est habitudo ad aliud 
sicut ad subiectum, et illa est de ratione essentiali accidentis. Ideo etc.
The special habitudines that are local habitudes have a history that 
goes back at least to Abelard. Admittedly, he does not say habitudo localis, 
but he does talk of the habitudo between man and animal which possesses 
an inferential force and is the locus from a species32:
Locum ergo generaliter deﬁ nientes vim inferentiae dicimus. Veluti 
cum talis proponitur consequentia: ‘si est homo, est animal’, 
‘homo’, cuius habitudo ad ‘animal’ vim inferentiae tenet, locus 
dicitur, cumque ‘homo’ ad ‘animal’ utpote species ad genus suum 
sese habeat, locus ipse a specie assignandus est.
The ﬁ rst appearance of the complex term habitudo localis that I know 
of is in Abbreviatio Montana33, which is supposedly from the middle of the 
30 Incerti Auctores, Quaest. SE, qu. 815.122-128, ed. EBBESEN, pp. 292-293: «Si 
enim quaeratur utrum ʻdeus est et tu es asinus’ non dicendum quod illa vera est propter 
hoc quod altera pars huius [est] assertionis vera est, scilicet deum esse, nam absolute 
non asseritur deum esse, sed sub habitudine ad te esse asinum, quae quidem habitudo 
signiﬁ catur per notam copulationis, et quia deum esse sub tali habitudine falsum est, 
ideo totam copulativam iudicamus esse falsam.»

12th century, but it is a remarkable fact that none of the other texts printed 
in De Rijk’s Logica Modernorum II.1 uses the term. Nor does it occur in 
such works from the ﬁ rst half of the 13th century as Tractatus Monacenses34 
or Summa ‘In omni doctrina’35. It resurfaces about the middle of the 13th 
century in the Topics commentary of Nicholas of Paris36, and then became 
a standard term in texts on dialectic.
Abelard’s use of habitudo in this context has nothing of the appearance 
of a novelty –one gets the impression that he is using a well-established 
term. Yet it is not found in the earliest published commentary on De 
topicis differentiis, the late 11th- commentary work that goes under the 
title of Primum oportet37, and the only occurrence of the word in Manlius 
Boethius’ De topicis differentiis38 is not in a relevant context, while it is 
quite absent from his commentary on Cicero’s Topics. 
Old Boethius is, nevertheless, the original source of the medieval 
logicians’ use of habitudo in dialectic. In his translation of Porphyry’s 
Isagoge, σχέσις is rendered habitudo, and most importantly, this happens in 
a passage dealing with the relation of an intermediary species to its superior 
genus and its inferior species. Such a species has two habitudines, one to 
the inferior and one to the superior item in the genus-species hierarchy, 
whereas a highest genus or a lowest species has only one habitudo39:

Quae vero sunt in medio, eorum quidem quae supra ipsa sunt, erunt 
species, eorum vero quae post ipsa sunt, genera. Quare haec quidem 
duas habent habitudines: eam quae est ad superiora, secundum 
quam species ipsorum esse dicuntur, et eam quae est ad posteriora, 
secundum quam genera ipsorum esse dicuntur. Extrema vero unam 
habent habitudinem; nam et generalissimum ad ea quidem quae 
posteriora sunt habet habitudinem, cum genus sit omnium id quod 
est supremum, eam vero quae est ad superiora non habet, cum sit 
supremum et primum principium; specialissimum autem unam habet 
habitudinem, eam quae est ad superiora quorum est species, eam vero 
quae est ad posteriora non diversam habet, sed etiam individuorum 
species dicitur (sed species quidem individuorum velut ea continens, 
species autem superiorum velut quae ab eis continetur).
This is indubitably the main source of the habitudo localis, but the 
adoption of the term may also have been facilitated by the fact that it 
occurs a couple of times in Boethius’ commentary on the Categories. He 
thus says that some think up and down do not belong under quantity, rather, 
they think they are habitudines, or in Greek: σχέσεις, deﬁ ned by a relation 
to our heads and feet, respectively40:
Sed quidam volunt non esse quantitatis quod sursum dicitur et 
deorsum sed potius habitudines, quas Graeci σχέσεις vocant: 
quae enim pars ad caput nostrum est, hunc sursum vocamus; quae 
pars pedibus subiacet, illa deorsum dicitur; quocirca secundum 
habitudinem quandam quodammodo ad nos ipsos relata sursum 
deorsumque praedicamus.

This seems to be in accordance with the standard use of the term 
σχέσις among Boethius’ Greek contemporaries, who appear to use the 
word about all sorts of external properties –Aristotelian relations, position 
in time and space, etc.
Later, when dealing with relations, Boethius stresses that genuine 
relatives owe their «convertible» predicability to some habitudo. By saying 
«A child is the child of his parent, and a parent is the parent of his child» 
we explicate a habitudo and a comparatio and a continentia utrorumque, 
as it were. By contrast, if we say «When the sun is above the earth it is 
day, and when it is day the sun is above the earth» we do not point to any 
habitudo, but just to a consequentia, i.e. that day and sunlight invariably 
follow each other41:
Aliam vero attulit causam prorsus gravem: ait enim proprium 
esse hoc relativorum, non secundum suam nuncupationem sed 
secundum aliquam habitudinem, eodem modo converti. Qui enim 
dicit «cum sol est super terram, dies est, et cum dies est, sol est 
super terram» nullam habitudinem monstrat sed tantummodo 
consequentiam ostendit. Consequitur enim super terram solem 
esse cum dies est, et cum sol super terram cursus agat, diem 
esse; cum vero aliquis dicit «ﬁ lius patris ﬁ lius, pater ﬁ lii pater», 
habitudinem et comparationem et quodammodo continentiam 
utrorumque declarat. Atque hoc quoque in alia quavis relatione 
spectare licet. Quocirca, quoniam omnia ad aliquid secundum 
quandam ad se invicem habitudinem continentiamque dicuntur, 
secundum continentiam quoque et habitudinem eorum conversio 
facienda est, qua in re nos quoque graviter dicentis Iamblici 
auctoritati concedimus.
This suggests that to Manlius Boethius a habitudo is something 
only incomplex items can possess, not propositions, and this view about 
σχέσεις may be one he has taken over from Iamblichus (see the end of 
the quotation), but it does not seem to have been standard doctrine. John 
Philoponus, a younger contemporary of Boethius’, uses σχέσεις both of 
relational quasi-properties of substances and of the relations between the 
constituent propositions of a syllogism42.

Nor were the medievals to follow Boethius in denying that propositions 
could be the bearers of habitudes. Thus, in a sophisma from the 1270s 
or thereabouts, the author says that the conjunction ‘if’ exercises the 
act of consecution and expresses the habitude of the antecedent to the 
consequent43. About 1250/60 Robertus de Aucumpno had proposed to 
see the habitudes involved in dialectical syllogisms as a formal trait of 
such syllogisms (though primarily linked to the terms involved, one would 
presume)44, and towards 1280 Simon of Faversham even says that the form 
of a syllogism simpliciter is the necessary habitude between the premisses 
and the conclusion together with the unity of the middle term with the 
τι, ὡς αὐτὸς ὑποκατιὼν λέγει, σχέσεις τινές εἰσι μόνον καὶ οἰκείαν ὑπόστασιν 
οὐκ ἔχουσιν, ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἄλλαις κατηγορίαις τὸ εἶναι ἔχουσιν.» Id., In Aristotelis 
Analytica Priora commentaria, Ed. by M. WALLIES, Reimer, Berlin 1905 (CAG, 13.2), 
pp. 259.29-260.2: «ἐπειδὴ οὖν, φησί, δέδεικται ὅτι αἱ ποιοῦσαι τὸν συλλογισμὸν

τὰς προτάσεις περὶ ἑκατέρου τμήματος ἐρωτήσαιμι.»

Cambridge, Peterhouse 206, f. 134rB, and Paris, Mazarine 3489, f. 1rA-B (minor

nullam formam argumenti addit super syllogismum, et ideo non est obliquitas alia 
contra demonstrationem ratione formae quam contra syllogismum simpliciter, nulla 
enim habitudo reperitur in re quae sit formalis respectu argumenti, quia non est in 
re habitudo nisi huius causae ad hunc effectum vel huiusmodi, habitudo autem 
ratione causae eadem est cum habitudine syllogismi simpliciter, particularitas autem 
superaddita est potius ratione materiae quam formae, non sic autem est de syllogismo 
dialectico, habitudo enim intentionum et intentiones formales sunt respectu rerum.» 
Similar statements are found in several Topics commentaries from about the middle of 
the 13th century, as pointed out by GREEN-PEDERSEN, The Tradition of the Topics, p. 255. 
For a good example, see his «Text 8» (Lisboa-Robert), p. 360: «Est enim illatio duplex: 
una quae causatur ex qualitate et quantitate propositione et ordine earundem, et haec 
determinatur in libro Priorum; alia est quae causatur ex habitudine terminorum, quae 
habitudo vocatur locus, et haec determinatur in libro Topicorum. Quare manifestum est 
quod dialecticus syllogismus novam formam addit ultra syllogismum simpliciter. Ideo 
doctrina de syllogismo dialectico et syllogismo simpliciter sunt doctrinae separatae. 
Demonstrativa vero ultra principia syllogismi simpliciter solummodo addit principia 
ex quibus ﬁ t illatio, scilicet materialia principia, non enim addit principia quae sunt 
rationes inferendi.»

extremes. Syllogistic ﬁ gure or mode are given the less important status of 
condiciones materiae45.
However, in spite of such apparent deviations from Manlius Boethius’ 
usage, there is no doubt that he is the Latin world’s source for this 
philosophical term.

ad 100b25sq.: «Ulterius notandum quod forma syllogismi est habitudo necessaria

SF (the author of the ﬁ rst set of questions in Incerti Auctores, Quaestiones super 
Sophisticos Elenchos), who composed his work a few years before Simon, would 
beg to differ (qu. 11.39-45, ed. EBBESEN, pp. 25-28): «Ex hiis accipio quod forma 
syllogismi simpliciter sit consequentia syllogistica fundata supra uniformem 
comparationem medii ad extrema sub debita quantitate et qualitate, unde forma 
syllogismi non est habitudo terminorum, sed est aliquid in habitudine. Et ideo 
intellege quod unitas termini, uniformis comparatio medii ad extrema, modus et 
ﬁ gura sunt dispositiones materiales ad formam syllogismi simpliciter.» Notice, 
however, that Simon and the anonymous speak of different types of habitudo. The 
latter’s consequentia syllogistica corresponds to the former’s habitudo necessaria 
praemissarum ad conclusionem, but the two disagree about the status of the 
relationship of the middle to the extremes.

ARISTOTLE’S FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION AND ITS 13th-
CENTURY RECEPTION
In the ﬁ rst chapter of the Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle puts forth the 
claim that human language is necessarily ambiguous ; for it is a usual fact of 
human communication that linguistic expressions represent different things 
in different communication-contexts. Given the unavoidable ambiguity 
of human language, Aristotle’s approach to ambiguity in general –and to 
equivocation in particular– aims at recognizing and avoiding or resolving 
linguistic ambiguity. The particular linguistic situation that Aristotle has in 
mind in the Sophistical Refutations, as well as in the Topics, is the dialectical 
joust. In both treatises Aristotle gives the respondent a considerable number 
of tricks/tests that can help him to unveil and resolve the questioner’s 
ambiguous uses of language. This, of course, entails the respondent’s 
capacity of recognizing two fundamental intentions in the questioner’s 
mind –the intention of deceiving and the intention that lies behind his use 
of words. There are thus two features that make the approach to ambiguity 
in Aristotle’s dialectic fundamentally pragmatic1: ﬁ rst, the questioner’s 
intention as determining the meaning that expressions have in different 
acts of communication; and second, the respondent’s recognition of those 
meanings and intentions as necessary for avoiding and resolving ambiguity.  
After having claimed in the ﬁ rst chapter of the Sophistical Refutations 
that the most common and natural cause of a sophistical refutation is 
the unawareness of the unavoidable ambiguity of language2, Aristotle

1 By «pragmatic» I mean the Gricean sense of an intimate link between, on the 
one hand, the interlocutors’ intentions of communicating and their recognition of each 
others intentions, and on the other hand the determination of meaning and the efﬁ cacity 
of human communication; see e.g. P. GRICE, «Utterer’s Meaning and Intentions» and 
«Utterer’s Meaning, Sentence-Meaning, and Word-Meaning», in Studies in the Way 
of Words, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA 1989, pp. 86-116 and 117-138.

is only a limited number of articulate utterances that can be used in order to represent

ANA MARÍA MORA-MÁRQUEZ
introduces in the fourth chapter six possible sophistical refutations that 
depend somehow on this ambiguity –refutations depending on equivocation, 
amphiboly, accent, composition, division and form of the expression3. 
Aristotle illustrates equivocation with three sophistical arguments. 
The ﬁ rst one depends on the equivocation of the verb μανθάνειν, which 
represents both the use of knowledge and the acquisition of knowledge; the 
second one depends on the equivocation of τὰ δέοντα, which represents both 
what must be because it is good and what must be because it is inevitable; 
and the third one depends on the equivocation of the participle ὁ κάμνων, 
which represents both he who is ill now and he who was ill in the past4. 
an unlimited number of objects: «For since it is impossible to argue by introducing 
the actual things under discussion, but we use names as symbols in the place of the 
things, we think that what happens in the case of names happens also in the case of 
the things, just as people who are counting think in the case of their counters. But the 
cases are not really similar; for names and a quantity of terms are ﬁ nite, whereas things 
are inﬁ nite in number; and so the same expression and a single name must necessarily 
signify a number of things.» Aristotle, Sophistical Refutations (hereafter, SE) 1.165a3-
17 (transl. E. S. FORSTER, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA 1955, p. 13).

showing the exhaustivity and mutual exclusivity of this list, but a deduction at least as 
old as Galen was supplied in the commentary tradition of this passage, a deduction to 
which I shall come back later. See also S. EBBESEN, Commentators and Commentaries

4 «Arguments such as the following are based on equivocation: “Those who know, 
learn; for it is those who know the use of the letters that learn what is indicated to them”. 
Here “learn” is equivocal, meaning “understand by using knowledge” and “acquire 
knowledge”. Or again, “Evils are good, for what must exist is good, and evils must 
exist”. Here “must exist” is used in two senses; it means “what is necessary”, which is 
often true of evils (for some evil is necessary), and we also say that good things “must 
exist”. Or again, “the same man is seating and standing and is a sick man and restored 
to health; for it is the man who stood up that is standing, and it is he who was recovering 
his health that is restored to health, but it was the man who was seated that stood up and 
the man who was sick that was recovering”. For that “the sick man” does such and such 
a thing or has such and such thing done to him, has not one meaning only but at one

Some lines later he adds that equivocation and amphiboly can happen in 
three ways. First, when the same expression –simple or composed– properly 
(κυρίως) represents several things, as in the case of the nouns «eagle» 
(ἀετός) and «dog» (κύων)5; then, when it is a regular practice to use an 
expression in a way that differs from its most common use; ﬁ nally, when 
some words signify only one thing when they are taken by themselves, but 
they produce an ambiguous sentence when they are taken together, as in the 
case of ἐπίσταται γράμματα. However, it must be noted that contrary to 
the medieval reading of this chapter Aristotle claims neither that these three 
modes should be mapped onto the three examples given above, nor that they 
amount only and exclusively to a typology of equivocation6. 
As regards the resolution of equivocation, it should be stressed that for 
Aristotle the burden of resolution lies on the respondent of the dialectical 
exchange. Hence, in chapter 19 of the Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle 
gives the respondent instructions on how to react before a questioner who 
is exploiting equivocation: i) if the equivocation is in the conclusion, but 
the conclusion is not the contradictory of what is to be refuted, then there 
is no refutation and therefore there is no need to resolve the equivocation; 
ii) but if the equivocation is in the conclusion, and there is refutation, then 
the respondent should argue that the questioner did not deny the same thing 
that was claimed in the premise; iii) now, if the equivocation is in one 
of the questions, the respondent should not reply simply yes or no, but 
time means “the man who is now sick”, and at another time “the man who was formerly 
sick”.» Aristotle, SE 4.165b30-166a6 (transl. FORSTER, p. 19).
5 κύων, for instance, can represent a dog, a dogstar and a Cynic philosopher.
6 Cf. Aristotle, SE 4. 166a14-21. This is rather a typology of ambiguity covering 
both equivocation (ﬁ rst two cases) and amphiboly (last case). The ﬁ rst two cases can be 
related to a division of nominal expressions in the Rhetoric: «A word in its prevailing 
and native meaning and metaphor are alone useful in the lexis of prose. A sign of this 
is that these are the only kinds of words everybody uses; for all people carry on their 
conversations with metaphors and words in their native and prevailing meanings.» 
Aristotle, Rhet. 3.1404b31-37 (transl. G. A KENNEDY, in On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic 
Discourse, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2007 p. 199). Thus, the ﬁ rst two cases 
seem to make reference to the «native» meaning of a word and to its metaphorical 
meanings, while the third case seems to make reference to syntactic ambiguity. For a 
discussion of the relation between this passage in the Sophistical Refutations and the 
notion of «metaphor» in the Rhetoric, see SCHREIBER, Aristotle on False Reasoning, pp. 
179-185. For a more general study of the Aristotelian notion of metaphor, see J. KIRBY, 
«Aristotle on Metaphor», American Journal of Philology, 118 (1997) 517-554.

he should stress that the question has different meanings and ask for a 
resolution of the equivocation; iv) nevertheless, if he fails to notice the 
equivocation in the question, it is possible to wait until the conclusion in 
order to ask for a resolution of the equivocation7. On the other hand, in 
the Topics Aristotle gives the respondent a number of tests that he can 
apply to expressions so as to unveil equivocation, for instance: i) to check 
whether their different uses have different contraries; ii) to check whether 
they have different contradictories; iii) to check whether they fall under 
different categories of predication; iv) to check whether they belong to 
different genera; and v) to check whether they have different deﬁ nitions8. 
Consequently, the resolution of equivocation depends on the respondent’s 
capacity of recognizing that the questioner has shifted the expression’s 
meaning, and it is recommended only when there is a risk of linguistic 
misunderstanding9. It is completely natural that the same word has different 
meanings; the problem arises when equivocal words produce ambiguous 
premises and fallacious ways of convincing through arguments.
Notwithstanding, for most medieval commentators of the Sophistical 
Refutations, the passage SE 4.166a14-21 introduces a typology of equivocation 
that can be mapped onto the examples that Aristotle gives in the passage SE 
4.165b30-166a6, and they remarkably focus on the equivocation of simple 
words rather than on the equivocation of expressions irrespective of whether 
they are simple or composed. But, along the lines of Aristotle’s concern with 
sophistical arguments rather than with equivocal words, they also discussed 
extensively the problem of what can be inferred from ambiguous statements. 
They also devoted a great deal of attention to the problem of how to produce 
statements with equivocal words so as to assure that their truth-value can be 
univocally determined. Now, the solutions that they give to this last problem 
are not explicitly found in Aristotle’s works but come from the late ancient 
interpretative traditions of Aristotelian dialectic. 
My aim in the pages to follow is to present the different ways in which 
13th-century Arts masters deal with the problem of inference from ambiguous 
statements. I shall ﬁ rst introduce the 13th-century deﬁ nitions of fallacy and 
7 Aristotle, SE 19.177a9-32.
8 Unveiling and resolving equivocation is the second of the four dialectical tools 
that Aristotle introduces in Topics I.15, together with the recollection of premises, the 
discovery of differences and the perception of likenesses.  
9 See e.g. Top. I.18.

of equivocation; I shall then present the typology of equivocation put forth 
by these authors; thereafter I shall present two cases that were used in their 
discussions on inference from ambiguous statements, cases that are closely 
connected to the question of resolution of equivocation in a disputational 
context. I shall conclude by showing that towards the end of the 13th 
century a group of masters presents us with a solution where the speaker’s 
intentions and the listener’s recognition of these intentions play a more 
important role than they did in their predecessors. Consequently, I shall 
claim that their approach to equivocation –albeit considerably different in 
important respects– is closer to Aristotle’s approach in that they put back 
on the listener the burden of disambiguation.
Fallacies and equivocation in the 13th century 
The aim of a sophistical disputation (disputatio) is to produce an 
apparent knowledge by means of a sophistical locus10. There are thirteen 
sophistical loci: six depending on the expression (in dictione) and seven 
outside of the expression (extra dictionem). The medieval tradition is more 
concerned with fallacies than with refutations, even if the notion of fallacy 
does not prevail in the Aristotelian treatise itself. A fallacy is then both the 
deceit caused by an apparent knowledge and the cause of this deceit –the 
sophistical locus itself. 
Any fallacy in the sense of sophistical locus involves both the cause 
of the appearance (causa apparentiae) and the cause of the non-existence 
or the cause of the non-validity of the argument (causa non existentiae vel 
causa falsitatis). 
The fallacies depending on the expression are produced because we 
represent several things with the same word or sentence –because of the 
multiplicity of signiﬁ cation of one and the same expression. Thus, the 
unity of the expression is the cause of the appearance, and the multiplicity 
of signiﬁ cation is the cause of the non-validity of the argument (causa 
non existentiae). This multiplicity can be actual, potential, or apparent 
(fantastica). Equivocation and amphiboly depend on the actual multiplicity 
of the expression. Accent, composition and division depend on its potential 
10 See also S. EBBESEN, «The Way Fallacies were Treated in Scholastic Logic», 
Cahiers de l’Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et Latin (CIMAGL), 55 (1987) 107-134.

multiplicity. And form of the expression depends on its apparent multi-
plicity. The source of this division of multiplicity is explicitly attributed 
by some authors to a certain Alexander, but a similar deduction of the six 
fallacies in dictione, based on the actual, potential or apparent multiplicity 
of the expression can be traced back at least to Galen (2nd century AD)11. In 
his De captionibus, Galen supplies the deduction of the types of refutation 
depending on the expression that Aristotle mentions, but does not make 
explicit, in the passage 4.165b27-30 of the Sophistical Refutations. Galen 
tells us that the multiplicity of the expression is the vice (κακία) that causes 
a sophistical refutation depending on the expression. This vice can be 
actual (ἐνεργείᾳ), potential (δυνάμει) or only apparent (φαντασίᾳ), and 
it can befall a word or a sentence. Thereafter, the deduction goes exactly 
as it goes in the 13th-century, except that for Galen the deduction concerns 
types of sophistical refutation, and not types of fallacy. 
Summing up, there is equivocation (aequivocatio) when the same word 
(dictio) actually signiﬁ es two or more different things ; and the fallacy of 
equivocation corresponds to the apparent knowledge that we acquire when 
we are not able to make a distinction between the diverse signiﬁ cates of 
one and the same term in an argument12.
Types of equivocation  
According to the 13th-century interpretation of the passage SE 
4.166a15-23, Aristotle gives there a division of equivocation into three 
11 Galen, Capt., cc. 2-3, pp. 3-4; for a detailed account of Galen’s deduction, see 
EBBESEN, Commentators,  pp. 78-87.
12 See e.g. Peter of Spain, Tractatus. Called afterwards Summulae logicales, ed. 
and intr. by L. M. DE RIJK, Van Gorcum, Assen 1972, pp. 98:5-99:20: «[…] alio autem 
modo fallacia dicitur causa sive principium illius deceptionis. […] in qualibet fallacia 
isto secundo modo sumpta duplex est principium sive duplex causa, scilicet […] causa 
apparentiae […]; alia causa […] est […] causa non existentiae, quod idem est, sive 
causa falsitatis. Causa apparentiae in qualibet fallacia est quod movet ad credendum 
quod non est […] causa falsitatis est quod dacit creditum esse falsum. Et quia ista 
duo principia sive istae duae causae sunt in qualibet fallacia, ideo oportet quod sint 
in aequivocatione […] causa apparentiae […] est unitas dictionis eiusdem simpliciter 
[…] causa falsitatis […] diversitas rationum vel rerum signiﬁ catarum. Aequivocatio 
est cum diversae rerum rationes in eodem simpliciter nomine uniuntur. […] Fallacia 
aequivocationis est deceptio causata in nobis ex impotentia distinguendi diversas in 
eodem nomine rationes simpliciter.»

different types that can be mapped onto the three examples of ambiguity 
that he gives in the passage SE 4.165b30-166a6. Authors from the period 
generate this typology in two different ways. In the ﬁ rst one, common in 
British authors, equivocation results from one term that represents several 
things; but a term can represent several things by itself or in conjunction 
with another term; if by itself, this can be either properly or derivatively, so 
that we have the ﬁ rst and second type; if in conjunction with another term, 
then we have the third type13.
Continental authors reject this deduction, because it would entail that 
in the third type the term is not actually, but only potentially, equivocal. 
They provide instead another deduction of the same typology according 
to which equivocation stems from a term actually signifying several 
things; but this can be either because of its signiﬁ cates or because of its co-
signiﬁ cates (e.g. co-signiﬁ cation of time); if because of its signiﬁ cates, this 
can be either properly or derivatively, so that we have the ﬁ rst and second 
type; if because of its co-signiﬁ cates, we have the third type14. 
The three types of equivocation are illustrated with the three sophistical 
arguments taken from the passage SE 4.165b30-166a6 as follows:
13 See e.g. William of Sherwood, Introductiones in logicam. Einführung in 
die Logik, Ed. by H. BRANDS – C. KANN, Felix Meiner, Hamburg 1995, at p. 170: 
«Est ergo aequivocatio eiusdem dictionis diversa signiﬁ catio. Et hoc potest esse 
tripliciter, aut quod dictio signiﬁ cet de se plura aut ex coniunctione eius cum alio. 
Et primum dupliciter scilicet quod proprie signiﬁ cet plura aut transumptive.» And 
Robert Kilwardby, Commentarium in Sophisticos Elenchos, Ed. by S. EBBESEN, in 
CIMAGL, 67 (1997) 152-169, at p. 152: «Pars prima habet tres secundum tres modos 
aequivocationis, primo enim ponit orationem in qua est aequivocatio ex principali 
signiﬁ catione dictionis, secundo cum dicit et rursus ponit orationem in qua est 
aequivocatio ex eo quod dictio signiﬁ cat plura non principaliter, sed unum principaliter 
et aliud transumptive; tertio cum dicit amplius ponit orationem in qua est aequivocatio 
eo quod dictio per se signiﬁ cat unum solum et coniuncta alii signiﬁ cat plura.»
14 See e.g. Peter of Spain, Tractatus (ed. DE RIJK, p. 105:14-20): «Ratio diversitatis 
[…] est in hoc quod aequivocatio ﬁ t tripliciter. Quia quod dictio plura signiﬁ cet, aut 
est ex signiﬁ catione aut ex consigniﬁ catione, […] si est ex signiﬁ catione, tunc ea quae 
signiﬁ cantur aut de pari […] aut per prius et posterius; […] si ex consigniﬁ catione, 
sic est tertius.» And Nicholas of Paris, Notulae super librum Elenchorum, Ed. 
by S. EBBESEN, in CIMAGL, 67 (1997) 169-179, at p. 173: «[…] modus proprius 
aequivocationis causatur aut a parte signiﬁ cati, sic sunt duo primi; aut consigniﬁ cati, 
et sic tertius. Si a parte signiﬁ cati, dupliciter: vel aequaliter signiﬁ cati, sic est primus 
modus; vel per prius et posterius, et sic est secundus[…]».

a) When a term has several signiﬁ cations that are equally proper:
Example:  
Quicumque sunt grammatici discunt;
 
 
 
scientes sunt grammatici; 
 
 
 
ergo scientes discunt.
Here «discunt» is equivocal for using a discipline and acquiring a 
discipline. 
Some authors (e.g. Peter of Spain) also illustrate this type with the 
noun «canis» and the following argument : 
Example (a’): 
Omnis canis est latrabile;
 
 
 
sed quoddam marinum animal est canis;
 
 
 
ergo quoddam marinum animal est latrabile.  
b) When a term represents several things, one primarily and the 
others derivatively: 
Example:  
Omne expediens est bonum;
 
 
 
malum est expediens;
 
 
 
ergo malum est bonum.
Here «expediens» is equivocal for the necessity that can be in bad 
things and the one that must be in good things. Medieval interpreters 
discuss this type of equivocation as a case of analogy15. 
c) When a term represents only one thing by itself, but several things 
when it is joined to another term:  
Example:   
Quicumque sanabatur sanus est;
 
 
 
laborans sanabatur;
 
 
 
ergo laborans sanus est.
Here «laborans» is equivocal, because the present participle can 
represent both what is the case now (with a predicate in the present tense, 
such as «sanus est») and what was the case in the past (with a predicate in 
the past tense, such as «sanabatur»).

ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION 
225
The validity of «Canis est, ergo latrabile est»
A common question raised in 13th-century commentaries on the 
Sophistical Refutations is whether an equivocal term like «canis» represents 
its signiﬁ cates conjunctively or disjunctively16. From Robert Kilwardby’s 
introduction to the question, it seems likely that the question arises from 
a confrontation with chapter 8 of Aristotle’s De interpretatione17. In this 
chapter, Aristotle seems to establish an equivalence between «a cloak is 
white», «a horse and a man is white» and «a horse is white and a man is 
white», where «cloak» has been given as a name to both man and horse18. 
This could be interpreted as entailing an equivalence between «cloak» and 
«man and horse» (or in medieval terms between «canis» and «latrabile et 
marinum et caeleste»). What is far from clear, though, is the logical import 
of this equivalence. For Aristotle is not saying that the afﬁ rmation «a cloak 
is white» entails that «a man is white» and «a horse is white» are both true at 
the same time so that both of them can be inferred from «a cloak is white». 
16 For other discussions of this problem, see S. EBBESEN, «Can Equivocation 
be Eliminated ?», Studia Mediewistyczne, 18 (1977) 103-24; ID., «Is “canis currit” 
Ungrammatical? Grammar in Elenchi Commentaries», Historiographia Linguistica, 7 
(1980) 53-68; and C. MARMO, Semiotica e linguaggio nella scolastica, Istituto Storico 
Italiano per il Medio Evo, Roma 1994, chapters 5.1-5.3.
17 Kilwardby’s commentary on the Sophistical Refutations is perhaps the ﬁ rst 
(partially) edited extant witness of this question. The question he raises is: «Habito quod 
una dictio possit signiﬁ care plura, quaeritur an signiﬁ cet omnia illa sub disiunctione vel 
sub copulatione.» And his second argument against signiﬁ catio sub disiunctione refers 
explicitly to Int. 8: «Item hoc patet per Aristotelem in libro Perihermeneias. Dicit enim 
quod si tunica imponatur ad signiﬁ candum hominem et equum, et dicatur “tunica est 
alba”, qui sic dicit aut dicit quod homo est albus et equus est albus, aut nihil dicit; sed 
non dicit nihil; ergo dicit haec duo coniuncta per copulationem.» Robert Kilwardby, 
Comm. in SE (ed. EBBESEN, p. 156). See also Albert the Great, Liber I Elenchorum t. II 
c. II (ed. P. JAMMY, Alberti magni expositio sophisticorum elenchorum, C. Prost, Lyon 
1651, vol. 2, pp. 539-542).
18 Aristotle, Int. 8.18a18-27 (transl. J. L. ACKRILL, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1963, 
pp. 49-50): «But if one name is given to two things which do not make up one thing, 
there is not a single afﬁ rmation. Suppose, for example, that one gave the name “cloak” 
to horse and man; a cloak is white would not be a single afﬁ rmation. For to say this is 
no different from saying a horse and a man is white, and this is no different from saying 
a horse is white and a man is white. So if this last signiﬁ es more than one thing and 
is more than one afﬁ rmation, clearly the ﬁ rst also signiﬁ es either more than one thing 
or nothing (because no man is a horse). Consequently it is not necessary, with these 
statements either, for one contradictory to be true and the other false.»

226 
ANA MARÍA MORA-MÁRQUEZ
On the contrary, he is claiming that «a cloak is white» is not susceptible of 
truth-determination because it represents both «a man is white» and «a horse 
is white», which is not the same as saying that it is equivalent to «a man is 
white and a horse is white». «A cloak is white» is a multiple statement and as 
such it should not be granted as true or false19. Consequently, nothing should 
be inferred from it. It is therefore with good reason that medieval interpreters 
wonder about the logical import of the equivalence between «canis» and 
«latrabile et marinum et caeleste», and more importantly about the logical 
import of the conjuction in «latrabile et marinum et caeleste».  
Kilwardby explains the conjunction by saying that an equivocal term 
represents its signiﬁ cates conjunctively, without accepting that representing 
them conjunctively amounts to their actual conjunction. Accordingly, he 
also rejects the validity of the inference «Canis est, ergo latrabile est». In 
order to explain what it is for the equivocal term to represent its signiﬁ cates 
conjunctively without this entailing their actual conjunction, he tells us that 
the equivocal term is something between a universal whole and an integral 
whole, in that it shares certain features with both of them20. 
As regards its similarity with an integral whole, Kilwardby tells us that 
the equivocal term represents actually all its signiﬁ cates, because when it 
is uttered different people can take it as representing different things at the 
same time21, just as different people can focus on different parts of a house, 
for instance when they are watching it from different viewpoints.
19 Cf. Aristotle, SE 17.175b39-176a19 (transl. FORSTER, p. 95): «If one does not 
make two questions into one, the fallacy which depends on equivocation and ambiguity 
would not exist either, but either refutation or absence of refutation. For what is the 
difference between asking whether Callias and Themistocles are musical and asking 
the same question about two people with the same name? For if one indicates more 
things than one, one has asked more questions than one. If therefore it is not correct to 
demand simply to receive one answer to two questions, clearly it is not proper to give 
a simple answer to any equivocal question, even though the term is true of all of the 
subjects, as some people claim that one ought. […] If therefore one must not give one 
answer to two questions, it is obvious that neither should one say «yes» or «no» where 
equivocal terms are used; […]»
20 Robert Kilwardby, Comm. in SE (ed. EBBESEN, p. 157): «[…] dictio aequivoca 
signiﬁ cat plura et sub copulatione. Verumtamen notandum est quod dictio aequivoca 
uno modo participat naturam totius integralis, alio modo naturam totius universalis; 
unde est quasi quoddam totum medium inter totum universale et totum integrale.»
21 See Robert Kilwardby, Comm. in SE (ed. EBBESEN, pp. 157-158): «Naturam 
autem totius integralis habet in hoc quod sicut totum integrale simul actu continet in se

 
ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION 
227
As regards the limits of its similarity with universal terms, Manlius 
Boethius had already pointed out in his De divisione that the resolution 
of an equivocal term should not be confused with the determination of 
universal terms : 
But since some things are equivocal, others univocal, and univocals 
are precisely the things we assume for the cutting up of genera 
whereas with equivocals there is division only of the signiﬁ cation, 
it must ﬁ rst be determined what is univocal and what equivocal, lest 
we be deceived into resolving an equivocal name into signiﬁ cant 
spoken sounds as though into species22. (transl. MAGEE, p. 17)
Both the equivocal term and the generic term are more universal than 
their parts, but the genus is more universal both as regards nature and 
predication, while the equivocal term is so only as regards predication. 
Thus, the equivocal term shares some logical features with universal terms, 
without being more universal in nature than its parts. Hence, it cannot be 
displayed into its parts as a genus is into its species (for instance, «animal» 
is displayed into «man» by means of the speciﬁ c difference «rational»)23. 
But the equivocal term behaves as a universal term in that, just as the 
omnes suas partes […] si ergo aliquis proferat “canis currit” simul et semel et in eodem 
instanti percipiunt Socrates et Plato diversa signiﬁ cata […]»
22 Manlius Boethius, De divisione, critical edition, translation and commentary by 
J. MAGEE, Brill, Leiden 1998, at pp. 16:24-18:1: «Sed quoniam alia sunt aequivoca, alia 
univoca, et quae sunt univoca ipsa in generum suscipimus sectiones, quae vero sunt 
aequivoca in his divisio sola signiﬁ cationis est, videndum prius est quid sit univocum 
quid aequivocum ne, cum ista fefellerint, aequivocum nomen quasi in species ita in 
signiﬁ cativas voces resolvamus.»
23 Manlius Boethius, De divisione (ed. MAGEE, pp. 10:32-12:15): «Secundum 
se autem divisionis huiusmodi differentia est. Differt enim divisio generis a vocis 
divisione quod vox quidem in proprias semper signiﬁ cationes separatur, genus non in 
signiﬁ cationes sed in quadam a se quodammodo creatione disiungitur, et genus semper 
speciei propriae totum est et universalius in natura, aequivocatio vero universalior 
quidem signiﬁ cata re dicitur tantum voce, non etiam totum est in natura. Illo quoque 
a vocis distributione dividitur, quod nihil habent commune praeter solum nomen quae 
sub voce sunt, quae vero sub genere collocantur et nomen generis et deﬁ nitionem 
suscipiunt. […] Generis vero apud omnes eadem divisio distributioque permanet, 
unde ﬁ t ut vocis quidem divisio ad positionem consuetudinemque pertineat, generis ad 
naturam, nam quod apud omnes idem est natura est, consuetudinis vero est quod apud 
aliquos permutatur.»

universal term, it does not allow downward entailment. Hence, just as 
«Animal est, ergo homo est» is not valid, in the same way «Canis est, ergo 
latrabile est» is not valid either24. And this is because both the universal 
and the equivocal term are applicable to all their parts, but without positing 
their actual conjunction. 
In the second half of the century, the Incertus SF –the author of an 
anonymous commentary on the Sophistical Refutations– answers the 
question whether an equivocal term represents its signiﬁ cates conjunctively 
or disjunctively, by saying that although the equivocal term represents 
actually all its signiﬁ cates, it is neither equivalent to their conjunction 
nor to their disjunction25. It is noteworthy that this does not amount to 
rejecting Kilwardby’s solution; for strictly speaking they both agree on 
the fact that the equivocal term is equivalent to neither the conjunction 
nor the disjunction of its signiﬁ cates, at least insofar as inference from 
an ambiguous statement is concerned. Accordingly, for the Incertus SF 
the inference «Canis currit, ergo latrabile currit» is not valid, because the 
antecedent has an equivocal subject, a statement with an equivocal subject 
is not an unity, and therefore its truth or falsity cannot be determined 
without a disambiguation of its subject26. 
24 Robert Kilwardby, Comm. in SE (ed. EBBESEN, pp. 158-159): «Item, nomen 
aequivocum habet in se naturam totius universalis in hoc quod sicut totum universale 
secundum suam substantiam totam est in qualibet sui parte, ita vox aequivoca secundum 
se totam est in quolibet signiﬁ cato per ipsam, […] In dictione autem aequivoca non est 
ita, immo quodlibet signiﬁ catorum signiﬁ catur per totam vocem, et in talibus non est 
praedicta propositio intelligenda, quia hoc modo participat dictio aequivoca naturam 
totius universalis […] Sicut igitur a toto universali ad suam partem non tenet processus 
afﬁ rmando, similiter nec tenebit a toto aequivoco ad aliquod suorum signiﬁ catorum.»

vel hoc vel hoc, sed signiﬁ cat hoc hoc hoc, […]»
26 Incertus SF, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 47 (ed. EBBESEN, p. 103:63-72): «[U]nitas 
simpliciter <non> reperitur in hoc antecedente quod est “canis currit”, quia sicut

ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION 
229
At the time of Incertus SF’s commentary there is a development of 
the discussion ; for commentaries of the period commonly raise the further 
question whether it is possible to resolve an ambiguous statement at the 
time of its utterance by means of the adjunction of a qualifying term to the 
equivocal term27. In other words, since it is now generally accepted that 
«canis est, ergo latrabile est» is not a valid inference, the question becomes 
whether «canis quadrupes est, ergo latrabile est» is valid or not. 
The question actually raised in the question-commentaries of the second 
half of the century is whether an equivocal term can be disambiguated by 
means of the adjunction of another term, so that a statement containing it 
is susceptible of truth-value. This amounts to asking whether it is possible 
that the speaker produces a univocal statement, even though it contains an 
equivocal word. The adjunction of a disambiguating term, in turn, can be 
either immediate –as in «canis quadrupes»– or mediate –as in «Canis est 
quadrupes». Incertus SF’s position is that the equivocal term cannot be 
disambiguated by a mediate adjunction –by a predicative adjunction; for 
in «Canis est quadrupes», «est cuadrupes» is predicated of «canis», so that 
it is only true if «canis» stands for a dog, but it would be falsely attributed 
to the constellation and to the sea-animal. And in any case, in order to 
determine the truth-value of the statement, it is necessary to determine 
what the subject-term «canis» stands for28. 
Nevertheless, Incertus SF accepts that the signiﬁ cation of «canis» can 
be restricted to only dogs by the immediate adjunction of a qualiﬁ cation 
–for instance, by the immediate adjunction of «quadrupes» as in «canis 
quadrupes». Consequently, he claims that it is possible to determine the 
force of the expression (virtus sermonis), irrespective of whether it is from 
ratione, et sic illud antecedentem non habet unitatem, et ideo huiusmodi consequentia 
est distinguenda et universaliter omnis consequentia ubi antecedens non est unum et 
consequens est unum est distinguenda; sed ita est in proposito quare et cetera.»

is Alive», Synthese, 40 (1979) 43-70.
28 Incertus SF, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 55 (ed. EBBESEN, p. 127:29-38): «Dico ad hoc 
quod quicquid sit de determinatione immediata, dico quod determinatio mediata non 
tollit aequivocationem […]; sed in talibus propositionibus in quibus est praedicatum 
pertinens subiecto pro aliquo eius signiﬁ cato cadit distinctio, sicut patet hic “canis 
currit”: li currit enim non competit nisi pro uno signiﬁ cato, tamen ista est distinguenda, 
quare in talibus tales determinationes non terminant aequivocationem termini 
aequivoci. Et hoc patet per rationem quia aliquid tale quod ei attribuitur mediate, non 
attribuitur ei ut idem sed ut praedicatum habens rationem alterius extremi.»

the part of the speaker or from the part of the listener –«canis» can be 
absolutely narrowed by the adjunction of «quadrupes», so as to produce 
a univocal statement that contains «canis quadrupes» as a subject29. 
However, he claims not to have a good logical reason to support his 
position, except for an argument of authority that he takes from Manlius 
Boethius. In De divisione, M. Boethius puts forth the statement «Canna 
romanorum sanguine sorduit», where the term «canna» can represent both 
a river and a reed. M. Boethius disambiguates (determinat) the statement 
by adding a qualiﬁ cation to the term «canna» –the demonstrative pronoun 
«hic», as in «Hic canna Romanorum sanguine sorduit»30. The adjunction 
of «hic» makes that «canna» cannot be taken to represent a reed, for 
«canna (reed)» is a feminine noun and «hic» a masculine demonstrative. 
However, Incertus SF remains silent about the fact that M. Boethius also 
accepts a qualiﬁ cation in the predicate as another way of disambiguating 
the statement, as for instance in «Canna Romanorum sanguine plenus 
fuit».
At any rate, Incertus SF’s position is that the equivocal term according to 
its force actually represents all the signiﬁ cates to which it has been imposed, 
unless its signiﬁ cation is narrowed by the adjunction of an immediate 
29 Incertus SF, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 55 (ed. EBBESEN, pp. 127:51-128:65): «[E]t 
ideo sic in proposito loquendo de termino aequivoco secundum virtutem sermonis 
dicendum est absolute quod determinatur et non solum secundum usum utentis. Quod 
patet quoniam recipimus hanc veram “canis latrabilis currit”, sed si de virtute sermonis 
non determinaretur li canis, tunc incompossibilia et contradictoria importaret, […] Et 
ideo dicendum quod potest determinari.»
30 Manlius Boethius, De divisione (ed. MAGEE, p. 46:18-25): «Dividitur 
qualibet adiectione quae terminet, vel generis vel casus vel alicuius articuli; ut cum 
dico “Canna Romanorum sanguine sorduit” et calamum demonstrat et ﬂ uvium, 
sed dividimus sic: articulo quidem, ut dicamus “hic Canna Romanorum sanguine 
plenus fuit”; vel genere, ut “Canna Romanorum sanguine plenus fuit”; vel casu vel 
numero, in illo enim singularis tantum est, in illo pluralis, et de aliis quidem eodem 
modo.» Note that just some lines before M. Boethius also puts forth the possibility 
of disambiguation through deﬁ nition; cf. Id., De divisione (ed. MAGEE, p. 46:14-18): 
«Dividuntur autem signiﬁ cationes aequivocarum secundum aequivocationem unius 
particulae orationum deﬁ nitione, ut cum dico “homo vivit” intellegitur et verus 
intellegitur et pictus; dividitur autem hoc modo: “animal rationale mortale vivit”, 
quod verum est, “animalis rationalis mortalis simulatio vivit”, quod falsum est.» Note 
also that in both cases what is at stake is not the disambiguation of the equivocal 
term per se, but rather the disambiguation of the whole statement so as to univocally 
determine its truth-value.

 
ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION

qualiﬁ cation, just as the authorities show31. Hence, «Canis est, ergo latrabile 
est» is not a valid inference, but «Canis quadrupes est, ergo latrabile est» is 
valid, because the truth-value of the antecedent can be univocally determined 
through the adjunction of «quadrupes». If we allowed the statement «Canis 
est» to be a case of semantic opacity because of equivocation –a statement 
where the truth-value of the statement cannot be determined because of the 
equivocation of «canis»–, we could also claim that Incertus SF’s treatment of 
the situation is along the lines of formal semantics, in that it makes the value 
of «canis» depend on the value of «quadrupes», so as to make it possible to 
interpret «Canis quadrupes est» as univocally true32. It is noteworthy, though, 
that this is not strictly speaking an Aristotelian concern. Although Aristotle 
accepts indeed the possibility for the respondent to unveil equivocation 
through some tests such as substitution of the deﬁ nition, he is not concerned 
with the absolute determination of a statement’s truth-value. And this is 
perhaps the reason why this question is not raised in earlier commentaries 
–e.g. Kilwardby’s and Albert’s– which are more concerned with the faithful 
interpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine than with exhausting the discussion 
of a logical problem.  
Incertus SF represents the second stage of a discussion that takes a 
more pragmatic turn towards the end of the 13th century33. For there is a 
group of commentators who reject Incertus SF’s treatment of the problem 
of inference from ambiguous statements and who instead take a position 
that is closer to Aristotle’s pragmatic approach to equivocation in the 
31 Incertus SF, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 55 (ed. EBBESEN, p. 128:60-79): «Et ideo 
dicendum quod potest determinari. […] sed cum ei additur aliquid quod natum est ei 
convenire pro uno signiﬁ cato, tunc auctores utuntur eo pro uno signiﬁ cato, ut patet in 
auctoribus iam adductis. Et ideo si ex alio non potest accipi probatio signiﬁ cationis nisi 
ex usu auctorum, nec impositionis, tunc dicemus quod est ratio impositionis termini 
aequivoci quod imponitur ad signiﬁ candum omnia signiﬁ cata cum per se accipitur 
sine determinatione […] cum autem sumitur cum aliqua determinatione tali, signiﬁ cat 
tantum illud unum; nec est alia ratio quaerenda nisi quod sic utuntur auctores.»
32 Formal semantics, however, has been concerned with referential opacity, as it 
is for instance the case in quantiﬁ ed statements or in statements that contain relative 
pronouns. But we can see, I believe, the case of «Canis quadrupes est» as an extreme 
case, where the referential opacity is primarily caused by the equivocation of the subject.

Sophistical Refutations. These authors are Radulphus Brito, Thomas of 
Wyk and the Anonymus Pragensis. 
To the question whether an equivocal term represents its signiﬁ cates 
conjunctively or disjunctively, they answer, just as the Incertus SF, that it 
does not represent them in either way, even though it actually represents all 
of them at the same time because of its several impositions34. They also agree 
that the question about the validity of the inference «Canis est, ergo latrabile 
est» cannot be answered with either yes or no, because one ought not give 
a simple answer to a multiple question35. The inference «Canis est, ergo 
latrabile est» is ambiguous, because the antecedent has an equivocal subject, 
and the validity of an inference depends on the truth of the antecedent, a truth 
that cannot be determined precisely because the antecedent is ambiguous. 
Hence, along the lines of Aristotle’s advice, they propose not to give a yes or 
no reply, but to make explicit the antecedent’s ambiguity36. More interesting,

though, is their position as regards the resolution of ambiguous statements; 
for, contrary to Incertus SF, they reject the idea that the adjunction of a term 
–whether mediate or immediate– can determine the signiﬁ cate of an equivo-
cal term so as to make the statement univocal. 
It is their position that an equivocal term represents actually and at 
the same time all the signiﬁ cates on which it was imposed every time 
it is uttered. However, they reject the idea that there can be an absolute 
disambiguation of the equivocal term –a disambiguation that does not result 
from the determination of a speciﬁ c signiﬁ cate from the part of the listener. 
The signiﬁ cates of an equivocal term cannot be narrowed by adjunction 
absolutely –simply through the adjunction of a qualifying term– because 
the equivocal word, whenever it is uttered, represents by its very essence 
and actually all of its signiﬁ cates37. Nonetheless, the speaker can make 
clear her intended signiﬁ cate with a qualiﬁ cation of the equivocal term, so 
that the listener, by virtue of his charitable understanding (i.e. because he 
wants the act of communication to succeed), can take the term to represent 
the signiﬁ cate that is coherent with the qualifying term38. Therefore, we 
[…] modo omnis consequentia multiplex est distinguenda; ergo talis consequentia est 
distinguenda, et debemos dicere quod pro uno signiﬁ cato est vera et pro alio falsa […]»
37 See e.g. Thomas of Wyk, Fallaciae (ed. EBBESEN, p. 141): «Intelligendum est 
etiam quod terminus aequivocus non potest contrahi per mediatum nec immediatum 
adiunctum, quia contractio proprie est communis potentia repraesentantis multa, et hoc 
per aliud magis determinatur; sed in termino aequivoco nulla signiﬁ catio est communis 
quae contrahi possit, […] terminus aequivocus actualiter et non potentialiter respicit 
sua <signiﬁ cata>, ideo in aequivocis non est proprie contractio. Verumtamen sic 
dicendo «canis latrabilis» virtute huius expressi pertinentis ad alterum signiﬁ catum 
termini aequivoci inducitur intellectus audientis magis <ad> apprehendendum unum 
signiﬁ catum quam aliud. Verumtamen de virtute sermonis non coartatur ad unum 
signiﬁ catum tantum, sed omnia adhuc repraesentat.»
38 Anonymus Pragensis, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 16 (ed. MURÈ, p. 88): «Ad hoc dicendum: 
cum quaeritur utrum aequivocatio possit determinari per adiunctum, potest intelligi 
dupliciter: vel de virtute sermonis vel de bonitate intelligentis. Si quaestio quaerat utrum 
aequivocatio determinetur per adiuncta virtute sermonis, dicendum quod non; et huius 
ratio est, quia in secundo huius dicit Philosophus: si dicatur “Coriscus est musicus” 
distinguenda est; et si dicatur “hic Coriscus est musicus”, adhuc est distinguenda; et 
tamen hic est determinatio, scilicet “hic”. […] Sed quantum est de bonitate intelligentis, 
dicendum quod determinatio distinguit terminum aequivocum; et huius ratio est, 
quoniam illud est possibile de bonitate intelligentis, quo accepto, nulla repugnantia

could suppose that to the question whether «Canis quadrupes est, ergo 
latrabile est» is a valid consequence, they would answer that, despite the 
adjunction of «quadrupes», the question is still multiple, unless «cannis» in 
the antecedent is disambiguated in a way that could go like this: 
Speaker: Is «Canis quadrupes est, ergo latrabile est» a valid 
inference?
Listener: That depends on what is the signiﬁ cate of «canis». It is 
neither a constellation nor a sea-animal, right?
Speaker: Right!
Listener: Ok, then it is a valid inference.
Thus, the determination of the antecedent’s truth-value and the 
determination of the inference’s validity cannot result from a formal 
semantic analysis of the antecedent. They can only result from a 
collaborative determination that depends partly on the listener’s recognition 
of the speaker’s intended value. I also submit that their position is closer 
to Aristotle’s general attitude towards equivocation in his dialectical 
treatises, even though their analyses rely heavily on the notion of linguistic 
imposition, a notion that is alien to the Aristotelian treatises themselves.
Is «Laborans sanus est» to be disambiguated? 
I would like to ﬁ nish with the discussion of another problem regarding 
resolution of equivocation –the one related to the question of whether the 
sentence «Laborans sanus est» ought to be disambiguation39. The problem 
est de bonitate intelligentis.» See also Radulphus Brito, Quaest. sup. SE, q. I.17 (ed. 
EBBESEN, pp. 213-214): «Dico tamen duo ad istam quaestionem: primo quod terminus 
aequivocus de virtute sermonis non potest contrahi ad alterum signiﬁ catum solum per 
aliquam determinationem sibi adiunctam; secundo dico quod de bonitate intelligentis 
potest contrahi vel determinari per aliquam determinationem sibi adiunctam. Primum 
declaratur sic: quia omne illlud quod est determinabile per aliud est in potentia ad illud 
per quod determinatur, sicut dicendo “homo albus” “homo” ibi determinatur per “albus” 
quia est in potentia ad albedinem; modo terminus aequivocus non est in potentia ad 
sua signiﬁ cata […] Secundo declaratur sic: quia aliquis potest intelligere terminum 
aequivocum pro uno signiﬁ cato ita quod non pro alio, et ita potest ipsum intelligere sumi 
pro illo signiﬁ cato ita quod non pro alio, et sic de bonitate intelligentis potest contrahi ad 
alterum eius signiﬁ catum per aliquam determinationem adiunctam sibi.»

ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION 
235
lies, ﬁ rst of all, in the nature of the present participle «laborans»; for it is 
not evident at all whether it is equivocal, and if so, why it is equivocal. 
The problem arises from the description of the third type of equivocation 
that we ﬁ nd in British authors such as Robert Kilwardby and William of 
Sherwood, according to whom there is equivocation of the third type 
when a term represents only one thing in itself, but many when it is joined 
to another term. The paradigmatic example that is given is the present 
participle «laborans», which can co-signify both the present and the past 
when it is joined to a verb in the imperfect tense, but only the present when 
it is taken by itself. But according to the standard deﬁ nition, equivocation 
takes place when a term has several signiﬁ cates actually and in itself, and 
not when it has one actually and in itself and several potentially (and only 
actually in the context of a statement). Kilwardby and Sherwood go about 
this objection by stressing that the action denoted by the present participle 
is primarily found in present things, but that because of its adjunction to a 
verb in the imperfect tense, the present participle can derivatively denote an 
action in the past. Therefore, the statement «Laborans sanus est» does not 
need to be disambiguated, because the present participle with the present 
tense of a verb retains its main co-signiﬁ cate –the present40.

ANA MARÍA MORA-MÁRQUEZ
Nicholas of Paris and Peter of Spain give another description of the third 
type of equivocation, which eludes the problem in Kilwardby and Sherwood’s 
description. According to Nicholas and Peter, equivocation of the third type 
happens when a term has several co-signiﬁ cations actually and in itself, as it 
is the case of the present participle, which actually denotes the present, the 
past and the future41. This is more or less the description adopted by Incertus 
SF42, the Anonymus Pragensis43, Thomas of Wyk44 and Radulphus Brito. 
41 Nicholas of Paris, Not. sup. lib. Elench. (ed. EBBESEN, p. 173): «Ad aliud 
dicimus quod sicut dicit Priscianus participia praesentis temporis confundunt omne 
tempus, praesens sc. praeteritum et futurum. Unde secundum confusionem aequivoca 
sunt et tempora diversa consigniﬁ cant de se. Dicimus ergo, cum sic dicitur “laborans 
sanabatur”, li laborans ab illo verbo “sanabatur” non accipit consigniﬁ cationem 
plurium temporum; aut si accipit, non accipit in quantum signum sive signiﬁ cans, ex 
quo causatur aequivocatio, sed forsitan accipit modum supponendi, et ita ut supponens 
et non ut signiﬁ cans habet ab illos consigniﬁ cationem plurium temporum, a se vero 
habet ut sit signum et non ut supponat.» Cf. Priscian, Institutiones XI.VII.25.
42 Incertus SF, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 53 (ed. EBBESEN, p. 119:200-220): «Et ideo 
falsum dicunt quando ponunt quod in tertio modo aliquid signiﬁ cet unum de se et habet 
aptitudinem ad aliud ex adiunctione […] et haec ratio potest haberi a Commentatore. 
Et iterum cum dicunt quod participium desinens in -ans vel in -ens de se est praesentis 
temporis et ex alio habet quod sit praeteriti, hoc falsum est, quia secundum Priscianum 
tale participium signiﬁ cat praesens confusum, quod quid congregatum est ex praeterito 
et futuro, quare pro omni potest accipi […] Et ideo dicendum quod haec “laborans 
sanus est” distinguenda est sicut et alia, cum li laborans per se signiﬁ cet utrumque 
tempus actu ex impositione, sicut ostendunt rationes primo adductae.»
43 Anonymus Pragensis, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 19 (ed. MURÈ, p. 96): «Ad istam 
quaestionem dicunt aliqui quod ista propositio “laborans sanus est” non distinguitur, 
et huius rationem assignant, quia li laborans praesens tempus designat <actu> et 
praeteritum designat in potentia, et non tenetur pro ipso praeterito nisi cum sibi additur 
determinatio praeteriti temporis, cum dicitur laborans sanabatur; sed cum dicitur 
“laborans sanus est” tenetur pro praesenti, ideo non est distinguenda. Sed haec positio 
non valet, quia <si> iste terminus importaret praesens actu et praeteritum in potentia,

ARISTOTLEʼS FALLACY OF EQUIVOCATION 
237
On the one hand, all these authors reject the description of the third type of 
equivocation in terms of the adjunction of another term for two main reasons: 
ﬁ rst, because it entails that the ambiguity of «Laborans sanabatur» stems 
from the verb «sanabatur» and not from the equivocal term «laborans», since 
what produces the multiplicity of signiﬁ cation is the imperfect tense; second, 
because if «laborans» were not actually equivocal, but only potentially, it 
would not be equivocal at all; for equivocation requires the actual multiplicity 
of signiﬁ cation. On the other hand, to the question about the need of 
disambiguating the statement «Laborans sanus est», they reply with the 
afﬁ rmative: ﬁ rst, because irrespective of the tense of the verb, «laborans», 
because of its imposition, always denotes the past and the present; second 
because this multiple co-signiﬁ cation, which belongs to the very essence of 
«laborans», cannot be narrowed by the adjunction of an accidental predicate45. 
Radulphus Brito stresses in addition to this that the resolution needed 
here is not a resolution of ambiguity due to amphiboly, but a resolution 
of ambiguity due to equivocation. He stresses this because of a problem 
that was discussed at least from Nicholas of Paris onwards. If multiple 
co-signiﬁ cation of time is a cause of equivocation, why the same is not the 
case for the multiple co-signiﬁ cation of number, of case or of gender? The 
British tradition considers a term like «episcopi» as equivocal, because 
it can represent both the nominative plural and the genitive singular, so 
that the statement «Isti asini sunt episcopi» is ambiguous because of 
the equivocation of case and number of «episcopi». In the Continental 
tradition, on the contrary, case and number are not causes of equivocation, 
so it is wrong to consider «episcopi» as an equivocal term46. Nicholas and 
adiuncto, sicut supponitur in ratione, sed “laborans” duo tempora consigniﬁ cat, praesens 
et praeteritum. Utrumque sibi conceditur ex impositione, diversimode tamen, quia praesens 
tempus sibi conceditur ubicumque ponitur respectu cuiuscumque verbi, aliud sibi conceditur 
respectu verbi convenientis. Unde non est imaginandum quod unum habeat ex se et aliud trahat 
ex adiuncto, et secundum hanc imaginationem procedunt rationes ad hanc quaestionem.»
45 See e.g. Anonymus Pragensis, Quaest. sup. SE, q. 19 (ed. MURÈ, p. 96): «Ideo 
dicendum quod haec propositio “laborans sanus est” distinguenda est: cuius ratio est, 
quia posita causa per se, ponitus effectus per se; sed causa per se distinctionis est 
quod “laborans” importat duo tempora, […] ; ergo quaecumque dictio sibi coniugatur, 
semper haec duo tempora signiﬁ cat, nam accidentale non transmutat essentiale; sed 
impositio est essentialis in termino et additio […] est accidentalis; ergo non potest tolli 
signiﬁ catum eius per illius termini additionem […]»

discussion of the case «episcopi».

Brito provide us with the following explanation: While co-signiﬁ cation of 
number, case and gender are causes of the constructibility of a term with 
another term so as to produce a grammatical sentence, co-signiﬁ cation 
of time is not the cause of grammatical constructibility. The syntactic 
multiplicity of terms with a multiple co-signiﬁ cation of number, gender, 
etc., is the cause of fallacies due to amphiboly or to form of the speech 
and not the cause of fallacies due to equivocation. The ambiguity of the 
sentence «Laborans sanus est» does not stem from a syntactic multiplicity 
of the sentence, but from the semantic multiplicity of «laborans» that comes 
from its multiple co-signiﬁ cation of time. Hence, the sentence needs to be 
disambiguated as a case of equivocation, and not as a case of amphiboly47. 
And just as in the case of «Canis currit», this disambiguation cannot 
be due to the adjunction of a predicate as «sanus est». Incertus SF would 
probably agree that the sentence can be disambiguated by the immediate 
adjunction of a term to the equivocal term, as in «Laborans nunc sanus est». 
A solution that cannot be accepted by the Anonymus Pragensis, Thomas 
of Wyk and Radulphus Brito, as it was shown in the case of the inference 
«Canis est, ergo latrabile est».
In conclusion, the Anonymus Pragensis, Thomas of Wyk and 
Radulphus Brito put forth an analysis of the fallacy of equivocation that 
is remarkably Aristotelian –and pragmatic– in that the disambiguation 
of a statement containing an equivocal term can only be the result of a 
collaborative effort between the interlocutors ; effort that fundamentally 
includes an inference by the listener about the intended meaning of the 
speaker.
47 See e.g. Radulphus Brito, Quaest. sup. SE, q. I.19 (ed. EBBESEN, pp. 224-225): 
«Omnis oratio in qua est aliquod multiplex est distinguenda […] multiplicitas quae 
est in oratione ex parte dictionis absolute consideratae est multiplicitas secundum 
aequivocationem; modo dicendo “laborans sanus est” in ista oratione est multiplicitas 
ex parte dictionis absolute consideratae et secundum se […] si enim aliqua dictio 
habeat diversos modos signiﬁ candi respectivos qui sint principium referendi ipsam ad 
aliam dictionem, tunc habet esse multiplicitas amphibolica, […] ibi est multiplicitas ex 
parte temporis; modo tempus non est modus signiﬁ candi respectivus qui sit principium 
uniendi unum constructibile cum alio constructibili; et ideo ista est distinguenda 
secundum aequivocationem. Tertium declaratur, quia tertius modus aequivocationis est 
quando aliqua dictio secundum se signiﬁ cat unum, coniunctum autem alteri signiﬁ cat 
plura; […] et si ex coniunctione modi signiﬁ candi cum signiﬁ cato <laborans> importat 
plura; ergo etc. […] numerus et persona vel casus vel genus non propter hoc redditur 
talis dictio aequivoca.»

1. Introduction
TAXONOMY MATTERS: ARISTOTLE. If the interest an author takes in a subject 
can be measured at all, the educated guess would be that it is commensurate 
with the attention he devotes to it. It thus seems a fair assessment to say 
that –when handling sophistical topics– classiﬁ catory issues were a matter 
of great concern to Aristotle. For one thing, he discussed at length and 
eventually discarded at least one competing classiﬁ cation of fallacies 
according to which these are to be differentiated depending on whether they 
aim at the thought or at its verbal expression1. For another, he remarkably 
engineered his own taxonomy. An all-embracing genus, the ignorance of 
what a refutation is2, encompasses two comprehensive species –one dwelling

1 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi, Ed. by D. ROSS, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1958, 
10, 170b 12-16: «οὐκ ἔστι δὲ διαϕορὰ τῶν λόγων ἣν λέγουσί τινες, τὸ εἶναι 
τοὺς μὲν πρὸς τοὔνομα λόγους, ἑτέρους δὲ πρὸς τὴν διάνοιαν· ἄτοπον γὰρ τὸ 
ὑπολαμβάνειν ἄλλους μὲν εἶναι πρὸς τοὔνομα λόγους, ἑτέρους δὲ πρὸς τὴν 
διάνοιαν, ἁλλ’ οὐ τοὺς αὐτούς [contrary to what some say, there is no distinction 
between arguments aiming at the word and arguments that aim at the thought. In fact, it 
is absurd to think that arguments aim either at the word or at the thought and that they are 
not the same]». The issue is brilliantly discussed in M. HECQUET-DEVIENNE, «La pensée 
et le mot dans les Réfutations sophistiques», Revue philosophique, 2 (1993) 179-196. 
2 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 6, 169a 18-21: «πάντες οἱ τ<ρ>όποι πίπτουσιν εἰς 
τὴν τοῦ ἐλέγχου ἄγνοιαν, οἱ μὲν οὖν παρὰ τὴν λέξιν, ὅτι ϕαινομένη ἀντίϕασις, 
ὅπερ ἦν ἴδιον τοῦ ἐλέγχου, οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι παρὰ τὸν τοῦ συλλογισμοῦ ὅρον [all 
fallacies fall under the ignorance of what a refutation is. Those depending on expression 
because the contradiction –which is the distinctive feature of refutation– is apparent 
only; the others because they violate the deﬁ nition of the deduction]». Cf. Aristotelis

on language, the other not3– whose twelve subsets4 account for all kinds of 
failures to meet either one of the two requirements a refutation ought to 
meet in order to do its job, which is to establish a real contradiction by 
means of a genuine deduction5. Aristotle even set himself to prove (both by 
way of induction and deduction) that his sixfold division of fallacies which 
have to do with expression is exhaustive: no fallacy involving linguistic 
features has been neglected and none falls outside those he mentioned6.
sophistici elenchi 6, 168a 17-20: «ἢ δὴ οὕτως διαιρετέον τοὺς ϕαινομένους 
συλλογισμοὺς καὶ ἐλέγχους, ἢ πάντας ἀνακτέον εἰς τὴν τοῦ ἐλέγχου ἄγνοιαν, 
ἀρχὴν ταύτην ποιησαμένους· ἔστι γὰρ ἅπαντας ἀναλῦσαι τοὺς λεχθέντας 
τρόπους εἰς τὸν τοῦ ἐλέγχου διορισμόν [apparent deductions and refutations must 
be classiﬁ ed either the way we did or be reduced to the ignorance of what a refutation 
is, which we acknowledge as their origin. In fact, it is possible to show that all the 
aforesaid fallacies neglect one aspect <or another> of the deﬁ nition of the deduction]». 
3 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 4, 165b 23-24: «τρόποι δ’ εἰσὶ τοῦ μὲν ἐλέγχειν 
δύο· οἱ μὲν γάρ εἰσι παρὰ τὴν λέξιν, οἱ δ’ ἔξω τῆς λέξεως [there are two ways of 
refuting: one has to do with expression, the other is independent of it]». As is well 
known, Aristotle’s classiﬁ cation of fallacious reasoning rests upon the alternative 
whether linguistic features play a role or not. Here λέξις means everything that has 
to do with the way we talk about things: written or spoken words may be equivocal 
(homonymy, ﬁ gure of speech and accent exploit their ambiguous features), turns of 
phrase may be equivocal too (amphiboly, composition and division –on the other 
hand– take advantage of their syntactical arrangements).
4 Equally distributed within and outside verbal expression: «ὁμωνυμία, 
ἀμϕιβολία, σύνθεσις, διαίρεσις, προσῳδία, σχῆμα λέξεως [homonymy, amphiboly, 
composition, division, accent, form of expression]» (Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 4, 
165b 24-27) and «παρὰ τὸ συμβεβηκός, […] τὸ ἁπλῶς ἢ μὴ ἁπλῶς ἀλλὰ πῂ ἢ 
ποὺ ἢ ποτὲ ἢ πρός τι λέγεσθαι, […] τὸ παρὰ τὸ ἑπόμενον, […] τὸ παρὰ τὸ <τὸ> 
ἐν ἀρχῇ λαμβάνειν, […] τὸ <τὸ> μὴ αἴτιον ὡς αἴτιον τιθέναι, […] τὸ τὰ πλείω 
ἐρωτήματα ἓν ποιεῖν [the fallacy of accident; the fallacy in which an expression is 
either said without qualiﬁ cation or not without qualiﬁ cation but with some qualiﬁ cation 
related to manner, place, time or relation; the fallacy of assuming the point to prove; 
the fallacy that states that something is cause without it being one; the fallacy that ask 
multiple questions as one]» (Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 4, 166b 21-27) respectively. 
5 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 1, 164b 27-165a 3: «ὁ μὲν [165a] γὰρ συλλογισμὸς 
ἐκ τινῶν ἐστι τεθέντων ὥστε λέγειν ἕτερον ἐξ ἀνάγκης τι τῶν κειμένων διὰ 
τῶν κειμένων, ἔλεγχος δὲ συλλογισμὸς μετ’ ἀντιϕάσεως τοῦ συμπεράσματος 
[deduction occurs when something new is necessarily involved by what has been 
previously stated. The refutation is a deduction which contradicts what has been 
presented as a conclusion]». 
6 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 4, 165b 28-29: «τούτου δὲ πίστις ἥ τε διὰ τῆς 
ἐπαγωγῆς καὶ συλλογισμός [This can be proved by both induction and deduction]».

TAXONOMY MATTERS: ARISTOTLE’S COMMENTATORS. By Galen’s time, the 
topic was popular enough for him to pride himself on having successfully 
dealt with the rationale behind Aristotle’s claim for completeness whilst other 
interpreters had failed to explain it7. Commentators will not forget Galen’s 
lesson and the issue will be addressed as a matter of routine by Byzantine and 
Latin scholars alike. Especially the latters placed considerable emphasis on 
the issue of exhaustiveness and spared no effort in order to describe in detail 
the architecture of Aristotle’s classiﬁ cation. Actually, from the very start, 
Latin commentators stressed the fact that Aristotle’s taxonomy is a coherent, 
principle-ruled, derivational system8. They also spent considerable time 
7 Galeni de captionibus in dictione, Ed. by S. EBBESEN, Commentators and 
Commentaries on Aristotle’s Sophistici elenchi, Brill, Leiden 1981, II, pp. 6.22-7.4: 
«τῶν οὖν ἐξηγησαμένων [7] αὐτὸν οἱ μὲν οὐδ’ ἐπεχείρησαν ταῦτ’ ἀκριβῶσαι τὸν 
προσήκοντα τρόπον, οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἔτυχον. ἡμεῖς δὲ πειραθῶμεν, οὐκ  Ἀριστοτέλους 
ἕνεκεν οὐδ' ὡς τῷ λόγῳ βοήθειάν τινα πορίζοντες, ἀλλ’ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν [some 
commentators did not even try go give a precise account of Aristotle’s way, others did 
not succeed. Let’s try, neither for Aristotle’s sake nor for the sake of the text, but for 
ourselves]». Galen managed at best to keep only half of his promise. As far as I know, 
no one – Valentina di Lascio excepted – has ever fulﬁ lled the other half and delivered the 
real McCoy, that is the key to understand Aristotle’s « proof through syllogism ». That 
she did in a remarkable essay, namely «The Theoretical Rationale behind Aristotle’s 
Classiﬁ cation of the Linguistic Fallacies in the Sophistical Refutations», Logical analysis 
and history of philosophy, 15 (2013) 55-89.
8 Four texts from early Latin literature will illustrate the point. 1. «ignorantia 
elenchi dicitur esse principium et origo omnium fallaciarum, […]. Ad quam quidem 
ignorantiam omnes redargutionis species rediguntur [we say that the ignorance 
of what a refutation is is the principle and the origin of all fallacies [...]. In fact, all 
their species come down to the ignorance of what a refutation is]» (Anonymi summa 
sophisticorum elenchorum, Ed. by L. M. DE RIJK, Logica Modernorum, vol. I, Van 
Gorcum, Assen 1962, p. 416.16-18). 2. Anonymi Aurelianensis I commentarium in 
Sophisticos elenchos, Ed. by S. EBBESEN, Cahiers de l’Institut du Moyen-Âge Grec et 
Latin (CIMAGL), 34 (1979) 162.27-163.6: «convenienter facta est superius fallaciarum 
divisio, ergo aut sic est dividendum apparentes syllogismos, ut supra divisimus, 
aut reducendum omnes in ignorantiam elenchi, ut scilicet dicamus quod in omni 
paralogismo est ignorantia elenchi et omnes fallacia sub illa specie est coartandum. 
[163] Non autem dico quod illi qui primam tenant divisionem sic debeant dividere, sed 
his, id est ab his, est reducendum omnes fallacias sub ignorantia elenchi. Vel his, id 
est secundum hos, qui faciunt hanc, id est constituunt ignorantiam elenchi principium 
omnium fallaciarum, id est quasi genus omnium [the division Aristotle introduced by 
the words “ONE MUST EITHER DIVIDE APPARENT SYLLOGISMS THIS WAY” has been correctly 
established as we did. “OR ONE MUST SUBSUME THEM ALL UNDER THE IGNORANCE OF WHAT

trying both to single out each acknowledged kind of fallacious reasoning and 
to list its various moods or subsets. Accordingly, the question «in how many 
varieties a given fallacy comes (quot modis varietur)» received at least as 
REFUTATION IS”, that is: as if we said that every paralogism has to do with the ignorance 
of what a refutation is and that one must subsume every fallacy under ignorance as 
one of its species. I do not claim that those who accept the ﬁ rst classiﬁ cation have 
to make a division according to the second classiﬁ cation, but “THOSE”, that is: they 
must subsume every fallacy under the ignorance of what a refutation is; or “THOSE”, 
that is: for those “WHO DO THAT”, that is: those who make the ignorance of what a 
refutation is the principle of all fallacies altogether, as if it were the genus of them 
all]». 3. Anonymi Aurelianensis II de paralogismis, Ed. by S. EBBESEN, CIMAGL, 16 
(1976) 77.20-21: «omnia genera fallaciarum ad hanc tamquam ad unum genus reduci 
possunt [all the kinds of fallacy may be reduced to the fallacy of the ignorance of what 
a refutation is as if it were their only genus]». 4. Anonymi fallacie londinenses, Ed. 
by L. M. DE RIJK, Logica modernorum, vol. II, Van Gorcum, Assen 1967, p. 672.4-
8: «fallacia secundum ignorantiam elenchi est deceptio proveniens ex obmissione 
aliquorum quae observanda sunt in descriptione elenchi. Et secundum hoc non aliqua 
tresdecim fallaciarum. Unde Aristoteles docet reducere omnes alias fallacias ad hanc 
fallaciam [the fallacy of the ignorance of what a refutation is is a deception that arises 
when one of the requirements to be satisﬁ ed according to the refutation’s deﬁ nition 
has been neglected. In this respect, the ignorance of what a fallacy is does not belong 
to Aristotle’s thirteen kinds of fallacies. This is why Aristotle advises that all other 
fallacies be reduced to the fallacy of the ignorance of what a refutation is]». That 
being said, taxonomic expediency did not prevent Latin authors from raising problems 
about the fact that ignorantia elenchi seems to be both inclusive of and included in 
the distinction between fallacies that dwell on verbal expression and fallacies who do 
not, in so far as Aristotle ranked it amongst the latters. Peter of Spain, for instance, felt 
the need to address the issue: «ﬁ eri quidem solet duplex distinctio ignorantie elenchi, 
secundum quod est una specialis de tredecim fallaciis, et secundum quod est generalis 
ad quam omnes tredecim fallacie reducuntur [as far as ignorance of what a refutation 
is is concerned, a double distinction is usually made, according to which ignorance of 
what a refutation is is both particular and general. Particular in so far as it is one of the 
thirteen fallacies and general in so far as it is the fallacy to which all others may be 
reduced]» (Petri hispani portugalensis tractatus, Ed. by L. M. DE RIJK, Peter of Spain 
(Petrus Hispanus Portugalensis). Tractatus called afterwards Summule logicales, Van 
Gorcum, Assen 1972, VII, p. 180.5-7). As did the anonymous author of the Fallaciae 
ad modum Oxoniae, Ed. by C. R. KOPP, Köln Universität, Köln 1985, p. 128, Albert 
the Great (Alberti magni expositio sophisticorum elenchorum, Ed. by P. JAMMY, C. 
Prost, Lyon 1651, p. 887a), Giles of Rome in his Expositio super libros elenchorum, 
Venetiis per Bonetum Locatellum, 1496, 18vb 28-34 and Anonymus agdavensis in 
his Quaestiones super Sophisticos elenchus, Ms Anger, Bibliothèque municipale, 418

much attention as the question «what the fallacy itself is (quid sit)»9. Moreover, 
Westerners resorted to speciﬁ c devices in order to solve classiﬁ catory puzzles. 
Besides the inherited opposition between Form and Matter which was much 
used to tell apart sophisms whose mistake is to jeopardize either the identity 
of their subject matter or the compelling form of their entailment10, the most 
sophisticated tool –and the more innovative too– they developed along the 
way was the distinction to be made between the way an argument goes 
wrong and the way it fools us. On that ground, they differentiated between 
what they called a causa apparentiae (what gives an argument a respectable 
appearance) and a causa defectus or non existentiae (the reason why –despite 
looking good– it is defective or fails to imply its conclusion)11. All of which 
9 In fact, more often than not, the two questions went hand in hand, as is illustrated 
time and again by the use of formulaic repetitions. Cf. e.g. Anonymi Cantabrigiensis 
commentarium in Aristotelis sophisticos elenchos, Ms Cambridge, St John’s D.12, f. 
85rb («dicatur quid sit aequivocatio, quid fallacia secundum aequivocationem, quot 
modis habeat ﬁ eri [it ought to be explained what homonymy is, what the fallacy of 
homonymy is and in how many varieties it comes]», f. 86rb («circa hanc fallaciam 
considerandum quid sit amphibologia, quid fallacia secundum amphibologiam, et quot 
modis habeat ﬁ eri [about this fallacy one must take into account what amphiboly is, 
what the fallacy that dwells on amphiboly is and in how many varieties it comes]»), f. 
87va («videndum est ergo quid sit compositio, quid divisio, quid fallacia compositionis, 
quid fallacia divisionis, quot modis ﬁ ant istae fallaciae [we have to consider what 
composition is, what division is, what the fallacy of composition is, what the fallacy 
of division is and in how many varieties they come]»), f. 88vb («circa hanc fallaciam 
considerantdum erit quid sit ﬁ gura dictionis, quid fallacia secundum ﬁ guram dictionis, 
et quot sunt huius fallaciae modi [about this fallacy one must take into account what 
ﬁ gure of speech is is, what the fallacy that dwells on ﬁ gure of speech is and in how 
many varieties it comes]»), f. 89va («videndum est quid sit accidens, quid fallacia 
secundum accidens, quot modi paralogismorum ﬁ ant secundum hanc fallaciam [we 
have to consider what accident is, what the fallacy of accident is and how many kinds 
of paralogisms occur according to it]»).
10 The literature on «logical form» vs. «logical matter» is both extensive in 
quantity and varied in quality. Besides J. BARNES, «Logical Form and Logical Matter», 
in A. ALBERTI (ed.), Logica, Mente e Persona, Olschki, Firenze 1990, pp. 16-39, 
which is quoted at every turn, a sensible introduction to the problem is to be found 
in S. EBBESEN, «The Way Fallacies were Treated in Scholastic Logic», CIMAGL, 55 
(1987) 107-134.
11 The early Dialectica monacensis makes the distinction very clearly when 
tackling the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech: «fallacia autem ﬁ gurae <dictionis> est 
deceptio proveniens ex similitudine dictionis cum dictione, vel etiam ex diversitate 
signiﬁ catorum vel consiginiﬁ catorum. Heae enim sunt causae ipsius moventis, scilicet 

244 
LEONE GAZZIERO
makes perfect sense, notably for two reasons: ﬁ rst of all, Aristotle makes it 
causa apparentiae ex parte signi et causa falsitatis ex parte signiﬁ cati vel consigniﬁ cati 
[the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech arises because of the similarity between expressions 
and the diversity between the things these signify or cosignify. Two are, in fact, the 
causes that bring about fallacies of this kind, that is: a cause which accounts for their 
deceptive appearance, which has to do with words, and a cause which accounts for their 
falsehood, which has to do with the things these words signify or cosignify]» (Tractatus 
de sophistica argumentatione (Dialectica monacensis), Ed. by DE RIJK, Logica 
Modernorum, II, p. 579.9-13). Along the same lines, Peter of Spain established two 
sets of synonymous expressions, which will become pretty standard in later literature: 
«principium autem motiviun sive causa apparentiae in qualibet fallacia est quod movet 
ad credendum quod non est. Principium vero defectus sive causa falsitatis est quod 
facit creditum esse falsum [the cause or the principle which produces the deceptive 
appearance in every fallacy is what leads someone to believe what is not the case. 
The principle of the ﬂ aw or the cause which accounts for the fallacy’s falsehood is 
what is actually responsible for the falsehood of what one is led to believe]» (Petri 
hispani portugalensis tractatus VII, p. 98.13-16); further, in a digression, he shrewdly 
remarks: «in aequivocatione principium motivum ab unitate dictionis sumitur et 
principium defectus a parte rerum signiﬁ catarum [in the case of fallacies of homonymy, 
the principle that accounts for the deception has to do with single words which mean 
more than one thing, whereas the principle of the ﬂ aw has to do with the things the 
ambiguous word signiﬁ y or cosignify]» (p. 122.5-7; cf. p. 128.13-15 for a similar point 
concerning the fallacy of accent). The distinction itself will be successful enough to 
serve as a structuring factor in commentators’ questioning, as is most clearly the case 
in the Summa Lamberti, Ed. by F. ALESSIO, La Nuova Italia, Firenze 1971, VII, where 
the very same questions are asked about any given family of fallacies, namely what 
are its causa apparentiae, its causa defectus and its modi: cf. e.g. «sequitur de fallacia 
accentus circa quam videndum est quid sit accentus, et quid fallacia accentus, quae 
causa apparentiae, quae causa falsitatis in ipsa, et quot sunt modi paralogizandi in ipsa 
[the fallacy of accent is discussed next and one must consider what accent is, what the 
fallacy of accent is, what causes its deceptive appearance, what accounts for its falsity 
and in how many ways it leads to draw a false inference]» (p. 166.1-4); «sequitur de 
fallacia ﬁ gurae dictionis circa quam videndum [169] est quid sit ﬁ gura dictionis et quid 
fallacia ﬁ gurae dictionis, quae causa apparentiae, quae causa falsitatis et quot modi 
paralogizandi sunt in illa fallacia [the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech is discussed next and 
one must consider what ﬁ gure of speech is, what the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech is, 
what causes its deceptive appearance, what accounts for its falsity and in how many 
ways it leads to draw a false inference]» (pp. 168.43-169.3); «in paralogismis qui ﬁ unt 
secundum accidens semper oportet tria reperiri: secundum rem, substantiam et accidens 
assignatum vel attributum, ideo videamus prius quis terminus debeat dici generaliter res 
subiecta, quis accidens et quis attributum et per hoc videbitur quid sit accidens; postea 
videndum est quid sit fallacia accidentis, quae causa apparentiae, quae causa falsitatis 
et quot modi paralogizandi sunt in ea [in fallacies of accident one always need to ﬁ nd

clear from the start12 that his main concern with sophistic arguments is not so 
much that they are poor arguments but rather that they manage not to appear 
so13. Secondly and foremost, their place in Aristotle’s classiﬁ cation depends 
on the way this illusion works: for instance, «homonymy», «amphiboly» and 
out three things: what is ascribed or attributed according to the thing, the substance and 
the accident. Therefore, let’s consider ﬁ rst which term generally deserves to be called 
a subject, which one deserves to be called an accident or an attribute. This way, we 
will ascertain what accident means here. One has to consider next what the fallacy of 
accident is, what causes its deceptive appearance, what accounts for its falsity and in 
how many ways it leads to draw a false inference]» (p. 173.28-35); «sequitur de fallacia 
consequentis, circa quam videndum est quid sit consequens, quid fallacia consequentis, 
quae causa apparentiae, quae causa falsitatis et quot sunt modi paralogizandi in ea [the 
fallacy of consequent is discussed next and one must consider what consequent is, what 
the fallacy of consequent is, what causes its deceptive appearance, what accounts for its 
falsity and in how many ways it leads to draw a false inference]» (p. 195.8-11). 
12 Cf. Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 1, 164a 20-26: «περὶ δὲ τῶν σοϕιστικῶν 
ἐλέγχων καὶ τῶν ϕαινομένων μὲν ἐλέγχων, ὄντων δὲ παραλογισμῶν ἀλλ’ οὐκ 
ἐλέγχων, λέγωμεν ἀρξάμενοι κατὰ ϕύσιν ἀπὸ τῶν πρώτων. ὅτι μὲν οὖν οἱ μὲν 
εἰσὶ συλλογισμοί, οἱ δ’ οὐκ ὄντες δοκοῦσι, ϕανερόν. ὥσπερ γὰρ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν 
ἄλλων τοῦτο γίνεται διά τινος ὁμοιότητος, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων ὡσαύτως ἔχει 
[we will discuss the sophistical refutations, that is, refutations which appear to be 
so while they are not, being paralogisms instead. As beﬁ ts the natural order, we will 
begin with what come ﬁ rst. That some deductions are really what they seem to be, 
while others only looks like deductions, is evident. As it happens in other matters, 
this arises from similarity. And this is the case with arguments as well]».
13 Albert the Great will stress the fact that where there is no such appearance there’s 
no fallacy involved either: «si causam apparentiae non haberet, non deciperet [where 
nothing produces a deceptive appearance, there is no deception either]» (Alberti magni 
expositio sophisticorum elenchorum, p. 850b 52-53). A similar point is made by Giles 
of Rome: if a bad argument does not appear to be sound, it is not a fallacy (cf. Aegidii 
romani expositio super libros elenchorum 58vb 47-48: «dubitaret forte aliquis, quia 
videtur hic nullam esse fallaciam, nullam enim videtur habere apparentiam [one might 
be perplexed, for no fallacy seems involved here, since there is no deception]»). Simon 
of Faversham will do the same: «paralogismus enim secundum quamlibet fallacia 
debet apparere bonus syllogismus, aliter non falleret; ergo oportet quod quaelibet 
fallacia habeat aliquid quod faciat ipsam apparere esse bonum syllogismum [whatever 
the fallacy involved, a paralogism has to look like a sound deduction, otherwise it 
would not be deceitful. Therefore, any fallacy whatsoever needs something that makes 
it looks like a sound deduction]» (Simonis de Faverisham quaestiones novae super 
libro elenchorum, Ed. by S. EBBESEN – T. IZBICKI – J. LONGEWAY – F. DEL PUNTA –

«ﬁ gure of speech» all involve a double meaning14, but they are not deceitful 
in the same way15. And this is indeed why they are distinct fallacies: they 
may well share the same causa defectus, but –their causa apparentiae being 
different– they are different. This is of course a pretty strong claim, but it is 
not at all an unusual one in medieval literature16. A typical example is to be 
found in the views of Anonymus salmaticensis-ﬂ orentinus, who is strongly 
committed to the idea that the reason why a fallacy does not look like one 
14 This is openly stated in Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 6, 168a 23-25: «τῶν μὲν 
γὰρ ἐν τῇ λέξει οἱ μέν εἰσι παρὰ τὸ διττόν, οἷον ἥ τε ὁμωνυμία καὶ ὁ λόγος καὶ ἡ 
ὁμοιοσχημοσύνη [some fallacies that have to do with expression depend on a double 
meaning, as –for instance– homonymy, amphiboly and ﬁ gure of speech]».
15 This is precisely the way Anonymous cordubensis explains why the three 
are different fallacies, that is, on account of their different principia apparentiae. 
Since «fallaciae distinguuntur penes principia apparentiae, ipsarum fallaciarum 
diversarum necesse est esse diversa principia [fallacies are told apart mostly by the 
principles that account for their deceptive appearance, for different fallacies must 
have different principles]» (Anonymi Cordubensis quaestiones super sophisticos 
elenchos, Ed. by S. EBBESEN, Incertorum auctorum quaestiones super sophisticos 
elenchos, G.E.C. Gad, Copenhague 1977, q. 820, p. 306.10-11), «ad hoc dicitur quod 
principium apparentiae proprium aequivocationis per quod distinguitur a quolibet 
loco sophistico est unitas vocis incomplexae secundum materiam et formam. Ex hoc 
enim patet distinctio eius a fallacia amphiboliae quoniam in amphibolia est unitas 
vocis complexae, hic autem vocis incomplexae […]. Distinguitur autem a ﬁ gura 
dictionis quoniam in ﬁ gura dictionis non est unitas vocis incomplexae secundum 
substantiam vocis, sed solum secundum similitudinem terminationum [The answer 
to that is: the principle which both accounts for the deception peculiarly associated 
with homonymy and allows to tell homonymy apart from any other fallacy is the 
material and formal unity of the single word which happens to be ambiguous. 
It is thereby evident why the fallacy of homonymy differs from the fallacy of 
amphiboly, in so far as the unity involved is alternatively the unity of a single 
expression (homonymy) or the unity of a complex expression (amphyboly) [...]. 
The fallacy of homonymy also differs from the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech, for in 
the latter the unity involved is not the unity of a single expression according to its 
substance, but rather the unity according to the similarity between words because 
of their ending]» (Anonymi Cordubensis quaestiones super sophisticos elenchos, q. 
820, p. 307.24-35).

is both its most important and its most distinctive feature17. Another good 
example is Simon of Faversham, for whom what produces the illusion that a 
fallacy is a sound argument is the very thing that makes it the fallacy it is. In 
Simon of Faversham’s words, the causa apparentiae is to perform a double 
function, that is, on the one hand, it makes it possible to tell good arguments 
from bad ones and, on the other hand, it sets any given fallacy apart from any 
other18.
WHEN TAXONOMY FAILS: A CASE STUDY. Sure enough, Aristotle and 
medieval commentators alike allowed for occasional overlaps between 
families of fallacies19. After all, no stretch of imagination is required to 
17 It is plain that, in the Anonymous’ eyes, sophistical appearances are not only 
utterly important but that they also make all the difference in taxonomical matters: 
Anonymi salmaticensis-ﬂ orentini quaestiones super Sophisticos elenchos, Ed. by 
S. EBBESEN, Incertorum auctorum quaestiones super Sophisticos elenchos, q. 82, 
p. 189.25-33: «in fallacia nihil est prius causa apparentiae, cum ex ipsa ratio fallaciae 
accipitur […]; a causa enim apparentiae sumitur ratio fallaciae in se et distinctio eius 
ab omnibus aliis [in a fallacy nothing takes precedence over the cause that accounts 
for its deceptive appearance, since it is the very thing that makes a given fallacy the 
fallacy it is [...]; as a matter of fact, the cause that accounts for a fallacy’s deceptive 
appearance accounts also for both its being the fallacy it is and the way it differs from 
any other fallacy]».

p. 151.27-29: «illud est causa apparentiae in aliqua fallacia quod facit ipsam esse 
fallaciam et quod facit ipsam esse distinctam ab omnibus aliis [in any fallacy the cause that 
accounts for its deceptive appearance is the very thing that makes it a fallacy and makes it 
differ from any other fallacy]». Furthermore, Simon of Faversham will identify the causa 
apparentiae with the formal principle of the fallacy itself: «sicut entia distinguuntur 
per suas formas ita distinguuntur fallaciae per suas causas apparentiae. Causa enim 
apparentiae in qualibet fallacia est quid formale. Et ideo fallacia quae habet causam 
apparentiae distinctam est fallacia distincta [just as things differ because of their forms, 
fallacies too differ because of the causes that account for their deceptive appearance. In 
fact, such causes are their formal element. Therefore, two fallacies that have not the same 
cause that account for their deceptive appearance are different]» (Simonis de Faverisham

fancy nasty quibblers trying more than one trick at a time or clumsy people 
rambling when reasoning in their heads. But such trespasses are so gross 
that they are not much of a threat to the integrity of Aristotle’s division. 
That being said, other entanglements are of a more serious nature and 
may possibly lead to the conclusion that a structural revision of Aristotle’s 
taxonomy is in order, but –then again– such crossings are vouched for by 
Aristotle himself: the ﬁ rst examples that spring to mind are –of course– the 
inclusion of the fallacy of consequent within the fallacy of accident and the 
symmetry between the fallacies of composition and division20. Medieval 
authors provided nice, even funny examples of fallacies open to more than 
one interpretation21. Still, some crossovers are neither trivial nor supported 
by the text. The one I wish to investigate will turn out to be both disruptive 
and ill inspired.

are to be solved by means of a division; when they turn on division, then they are to be

Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1976, II, 24, 1401a 25-26 where Aristotle mentions both 
as one fallacy rather than two: «ἄλλος τὸ <τὸ> διῃρημένον συντιθέντα λέγειν ἢ 
τὸ συγκείμενον διαιροῦντα [another fallacy consists in asserting conjointly what is 
separated and separately what is conjoined]»).

fallacies open to more than one solution should be to everybody’s liking: «quicumque sunt 
episcopi sunt sacerdotes; isti asini sunt episcopi; ergo isti asini sunt sacerdotes [all bishops 
are priests; theses asses are bishops (these asses belong to the bishop); therefore, these

2. Anomalies and random variables 
STATING THE PROBLEM: A STRANGE QUESTION AND AN EVEN STRANGER 
ANSWER. When Medieval Latin commentators asked an odd question, this 
is usually the sign that either they lacked a piece of information or they 
were facing an anomaly in processing available data. When their answer 
proves to be at odds with the basic tenets of a theory they otherwise seem 
to grasp pretty well, one had better start looking for both. The question 
I’ll be using as a Freudian slip of sorts is very odd indeed and it took the 
form of a dilemma: «whether the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech is a linguistic 
fallacy or not». The answer is even more telling, since no reader in his 
right mind would admit, let alone accept that a sophism depending on the 
shape of words may be independent from expression rather than related to 
it. And yet this is precisely the claim whose grounds I am going to discuss. 
For once, the deﬁ cit in information is not directly related to the status of 
the Aristotelian corpus bequeathed to the Latins over the centuries. It has 
more to do with the fact that no ancient scholium or excerpt had been 
handed down –via Boethius, James of Venice or the Arabs– about the 
most thought-provoking piece of argument Aristotle introduced in order to 
illustrate what ﬁ gure of speech is and how it works, namely the so called 
«Third Man». The anomaly is an occasional (albeit very widespread) 
mismatch between fallacies of accident and fallacies of ﬁ gure of speech, 
which easily qualiﬁ es as one of the most peculiar episodes in the history of 
Aristotle’s Latin exegesis.
THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT VS THE FALLACY OF FIGURE OF SPEECH. As a 
number of interpreters, both ancient and modern, have suggested22, the 
22 Anonymi glosae in Aristotelis Sophisticos elenchos, Ed. by DE RIJK, Logica 
Modernorum, I, p. 214.20-22: «notandum quod “accidens” dicitur hic predicatum, sive 
de se tantum sive de alio predicetur, sive sit substantiale sive accidentale [it should 
be noted that “accidens” means here predicate, whether it is predicated of itself or 
of something else, whether it is essential or accidental]»; cf. p. 214.10: «secundum 
accidens, idest secundum praedicatum [“secundum accidens”, that is to say predicate 
related]». Anonymi summa sophisticorum elenchorum, p. 356.7-10: «“accidens” 
enim ibi largo modo accipitur, scilicet pro quolibet predicato, sive accidentale sit 
sive substantiale [“accident” is taken here in a broad sense and means any predicate, 
whether accidental or essential]». Anonymi parisiensis compendium sophisticorum 
elenchorum, Ed. by S. EBBESEN – Y. IWAKUMA, CIMAGL, 60 (1990) 88.19-22: «accidens

sunt, et quod in propositione subicitur subiectum dicatur, non debet mirum videri si eius

LEONE GAZZIERO
fallacy of accident’s name does not imply that only accidental features 
are involved. As it is the case elsewhere in Aristotle’s corpus23 and as it 
is demonstrated by his own choice of examples24, «accidens» means here 
much the same as «predicate» tout court, that is: without restriction. As its 
deﬁ nition goes25, the fallacy of accident leads to believe that what is said 
praedicatum accidens appelletur [Aristotle calls here “accidens” the predicate. Since 
the subject and the accident are relative and the subject is said to be underlying, it does 
not come as a surprise that its predicate is called “accidens”]». Anonymi cantabrigiensis 
commentarium in Aristotelis sophisticos elenchos, 89vb 17-18: «accidens in hac 
iunctura locutionis “fallacia secundum accidens” dicitur praedicatum sive ipsum sit 
accidentale praedicabile sive substantiale [“accidens” within the expression “fallacia 
secundum accidens” means predicate, whether it is something predicated accidentally 
or essentially]»; cf. 89vb 4-5: «dicitur accidens omne praedicabile sive accidentale 
sive quod non <est> accidentale sive substantiale [we call “accidens” everything 
that may be predicated, either accidental or non-accidental, that is to say essential]».

same as “predicate”]». Modern scholars who hold the same view are, amongst others,

as well as in Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 7, 169b 4-6. Likewise, συμβεβηκός and 
κατηγορούμενον are synonyms in Aristotelis analytica posteriora, Ed. by W. D. ROSS, 
Clarendon Press, Oxford 1949, I, 4, 73b 8-10.
24 There can be no doubt that being a man is an essential feature of the individual 
man (cf. Aristotelis sophistici elenchi, 5, 166b 33-36) or that being a ﬁ gure is an 
essential feature of any given ﬁ gure, a triangle for instance (cf. Aristotelis sophistici 
elenchi 6, 168a 40 - 168b 4).

τῷ συμβεβηκότι ὑπάρχειν. ἐπεὶ γὰρ τῷ αὐτῷ πολλὰ συμβέβηκεν, οὐκ ἀνάγκη 

 
«UTRUM FIGURA DICTIONIS SIT FALLACIA IN DICTIONE» 
251
of a predicate may be also said of its subject and vice versa26. As a result, 
fallacies of accident occur when one is unable to determine beforehand 
what belongs to both (the subject and the predicate) and what belongs 
πᾶσι τοῖς κατηγορουμένοις καὶ καθ’ οὗ κατηγορεῖται ταὐτὰ πάντα ὑπάρχειν 
[fallacies of “accident” occur when a predicate whatsoever is believed to belong in the 
same way to a thing and to something that is predicated of it. Since many attributes are 
predicated of the same thing, it is not necessary that all the attributes belong both to the 
thing and to all of its predicates]».
26 Medievals acknowledged that the fallacy of accident goes both ways, as 
the following ﬁ ve examples make it pretty clear. Anonymi summa sophisticorum 
elenchorum, p. 356.1-8: «secundum accidens ergo ﬁ unt paralogismi, ut dicit Aristoteles, 
quando quodlibet similiter fuerit assignatum inesse rei subiectae et accidenti, id est 
praedicato, et e converso, id est quando idem assignatur convenire accidenti sive 
praedicato, quod inest et rei subiectae [as Aristotle says, fallacies of accident occur 
when something whatsoever is similarly said to belong both to the underlying thing 
and to the accident, that is to say to the predicate, or – the other way round – when 
it is said to ﬁ t the accident, that is to say the predicate, to which it belongs, and the 
underlying thing]». Anonymi cantabrigiensis commentarium in Aristotelis sophisticos 
elenchos, 89vb 19-21: «ut dicatur fallacia secundum accidens deceptio proveniens ex 
omissione \habitudinis/ unius praedicabilis ad aliud sive praedicati ad subiectum sive 
subiecti ad praedicatum [what we call the fallacy of accident is a deception which 
arises from disregarding the relation of one predicate to the other, whether this relation 
is the predicate’s relation to the subject or the subject’s relation to the predicate]». 
Anonymi fallacie londinenses, p. 669.6-9: «fallacia secundum accidens est deceptio 
proveniens ex obmissa habitudine praedicati ad subiectum, vel econverso, quia 
haec fallacia provenit tam ex obmissa habitudine subiecti ad praedicatum quam ex 
obmissa habitudine praedicati ad subiectum [the fallacy of accident is a deception 
which arises from disregarding the relation either of the predicate to the subject or 
of the subject to the predicate, for such a fallacy arises as much from a neglected 
relation of the subject to the predicate than from a neglected relation of the predicate 
to the subject]». Guillelmi de Montibus (?) fallaciae, p. 16.1-7: «incidit autem haec 
fallacia in argumentatione quandoque aliquid assignatur subiecto quod non potest 
assignari praedicato vel e converso. Est enim fallacia secundum accidens deceptio 
proveniens ex omissa habitudine praedicati ad subiectum vel e converso [such a 
fallacy occurs in arguments which ascribe to the subject what cannot be ascribed to 
the predicate and vice versa. As a matter of fact, the fallacy of accident is a deception 
which arises from disregarding the relation either of the predicate to the subject or 
of the subject to the predicate]». Anonymi salmaticensis-ﬂ orentini quaestiones super 
Sophisticos elenchos, q. 84, p. 194.24-31: «accidens est aliquo modo idem subiecto de 
quo dicitur et aliquo modo non, et sic sumitur accidens in fallacia accidentis, ut dicit

quod inest praedicato denotatur inesse subiecto, ut “homo est animal, sed animal est

exclusively to either one (alternatively the subject or the predicate)27. 
As far as such determination depends rather on states of affairs than on 
names, one may safely assume that fallacies of accident have little –if 
anything at all– to do with linguistic considerations. Moreover, even when 
such considerations have been forced upon them, fallacies of accident 
verged on homonymy rather than on ﬁ gure of speech28. Which is one 
 genus, ergo homo est genus”; alio modo ex eo quod illud quod inest subiecto denotatur 
inesse praedicato, ut “Socrates est homo, Socrates est individuum, ergo homo est 
individuum”; et sic duo modi principales sunt [the “accident” is, in a way, the same as 
the thing it is predicated of and, in another way, it is not. As the Commentator has it, 
this is how “accident” has to be understood in the fallacy of the same name and how its 
moods have to be assigned therein. One arises from the fact that what is attributed to 
the predicate is meant to be predicated of the subject as well, as in: “man is an animal, 
but animal is a genus, therefore man is a genus”. Another arises from the fact that what 
is attributed to the subject is attributed to the predicate as well, as in: “Socrates is a 
man, Socrates is an individual, therefore man is an individual”. This is why there are 
two main moods of the fallacy of accident]».
27 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 7, 169b 3-6: «<169a 22: ἡ δ’ ἀπάτη γίνεται> 
τῶν δὲ παρὰ τὸ συμβεβηκὸς διὰ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι διακρίνειν τὸ ταὐτὸν καὶ τὸ 
ἕτερον, καὶ ἓν καὶ πολλά, μηδὲ τοῖς ποίοις τῶν κατηγορημάτων πάντα ταὐτὰ 
καὶ τῷ πράγματι συμβέβηκεν [in fallacies of accident the deception arises from the 
incapacity to distinguish what is the same and what is different, what is one and what 
is many, as well as from the incapacity to tell which predicates have the same attributes 
as their subjects]».
28 Although they should have known better –and some of them actually did, 
as argued at length in a forthcoming paper in Acta philosophica: «Exempla docent. 
How to Make Sense of Aristotle’s Examples of the Fallacy of Accident (Doxography 
Matters)»– Latins brought the fallacy of accident and the fallacy of homonymy 
together on the grounds of a variation in the supposition of the middle term observed 
in tokens of both types. Cf. Anonymi summa sophisticorum elenchorum, p. 294.10-

more reason Latin commentators should have kept them apart, since they 
ordinarily took very seriously the difference between homonymy and form 
of expression, whose «actual» and «imaginary» polysemy they opposed 
in line with a tradition that –under «Alexander»’s patronage– goes back 
to Galen through Michael of Ephesus and James of Venice29. To make a 
(very) long story short, homonymy is tantamount to using one word with 
multiple meanings30, while ﬁ gure of speech occurs when using different

ﬂ orentinus, Simon of Faversham, Anonymus G&C 611-II, Duns Scotus and Radulphus 
Brito especially deserve to be mentioned, for they emphatically underscored such a 
difference. For the sake of brevity, I will only quote Simon of Faversham’s Quaestiones

multiplicitas [the fallacy of homonymy especially differs from the fallacy of ﬁ gure 
of speech, for the multiple meanings are not dissimulated by a single word but by 
a similarity between words. In so far as the multiple meanings involved in ﬁ gure 
of speech are not dissimulated by one word only, we call its multiplicity “phanta-

pretty much the same way, this is likely to confuse people about what those 
things are and how they stand with respect to each other.
STATING THE PROGRAM. After addressing the problem of why the fallacies 
of accident and of ﬁ gure of speech do not belong together, we may turn 
our attention to the rather fortuitous chain of events that brought the two 
together. In other words, it is time to ask the question: if fallacies of ﬁ gure of 
speech depend on linguistic features to such an extent that there is no point 
in assuming that they do not resort to language itself one way or another, 
how come then medieval authors repeatedly asked themselves «utrum ﬁ gura 
dictionis sit fallacia in dictione», which I’ll translate without much concern 
for literality: «whether or not the form of expression, as a source of fallacious 
reasoning, depends on expression»? Anonymus salmaticensis-ﬂ orentinus33, 
ἄρρεν θῆλυ ἢ τὸ θῆλυ ἄρρεν ἢ τὸ μεταξὺ θάτερον τούτων, ἢ πάλιν τὸ ποιὸν 
ποσὸν ἢ τὸ ποσὸν ποιόν, ἢ τὸ ποιοὐν πάσχον ἢ τὸ διακείμενον ποιοῦν, καὶ 
τἆλλα δ’ ὡς διῄρηται πρότερον [fallacies of ﬁ gure of speech occur when what 
is not the same is said in the same way; for instance, when something masculine is 
designated by means of an expression which is rather feminine, or when something 
feminine is designated by means of an expression which is rather masculine, or 
when something neuter is said by means of an expression which is alternatively 
rather masculine or feminine; or –again– when a quality is said by means of an 
expression which looks like a term for a quantity or when a quantity is said by means 
of an expression which looks like a term for a quality; or –again– when an action is 
said by means of an expression which looks like a term for an affection or when a 
state is said by means of an expression which looks like a term for an action; and so 
forth according to the division previously made]». Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 7, 
169a 29-35: «τῶν δὲ παρὰ τὸ σχῆμα διὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα τῆς λέξεως. χαλεπὸν 
γὰρ διελεῖν ποῖα ὡσαύτως καὶ ποῖα ὡς ἑτέρως λέγεται (σχεδὸν γὰρ ὁ τοῦτο 
δυνάμενος ποιεῖν ἐγγύς ἐστι τοῦ θεωρεῖν τἀληθές, μάλιστα δ’ ἐπίσταται 
συνεπινεύειν), ὅτι πᾶν τὸ κατηγορούμενόν τινος ὑπολαμβάνομεν τόδε τι, 
καὶ ὡς ἓν ὑπακούομεν [as far as fallacies of ﬁ gure of speech are concerned, the 
deception arises from the similarity among expressions. In fact, it is difﬁ cult to 
tell apart things said in the same way and things said differently (he who is able to 
do this is almost on the verge of discovering the truth, all the more so will he be 
able to answer advisedly), for we trust everything predicated of something else to 
be an individual thing and we understand it as being one]». This is a very strong 
philosophical point in its own right and a very wise lesson at that: as a matter of 
course, language by itself teaches us next to nothing about how the world is. Since 
we talk about different realities as if they were just the same, we simply cannot 
trust words to tell them apart.

Anonymus pragensis34, Duns Scotus35, Radulphus Brito36, John Buridan37 and 
Marsilius of Inghen38 even devoted entire questions of their commentaries to 
the problem. How they came to think of the question as a sensible one to ask 
is a puzzle worth solving. Sten Ebbesen39, Irène Rosier-Catach40 and Andrea 
Tabarroni41 have gone a long way in helping us understand more about the 
34 Anonymi pragensis, q. 28, pp. 64.8-66.14 asks the question in a slightly 
different form: «consequenter quaeritur utrum fallacia ﬁ gurae dictionis habeat 
principium apparentiae ex parte vocis [the question arises next whether the origin of 
the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech has to do with verbal expression]».
35 Ioannis Duns Scoti quaestiones super librum elenchorum Aristotelis, q. 37, 
pp. 437.1-443.6: «utrum ﬁ gura dictionis sit locus in dictione [whether the fallacy of 
form of expression is a fallacy depending on expression]».
36 Not only Radulphus Brito asked the question, but he came as close as one 
can get to give the right answer: «cum dicitur “illa fallacia non est in dictione cuius 
causa apparentiae sumitur ex parte rei”, verum est. Et cum dicitur quod fallacia ﬁ gurae 
dictionis est huiusmodi, falsum est, immo sumitur ex similitudine dictionis cum 
dictione, vel in modo appellandi vel in concretione vocum. Et cum dicitur quod ista 
ﬁ t quando unum praedicamentum commutatur in aliud, verum est; sed hoc non est 
per similitudinem sumptam ex parte rei, sed [119] per similitudinem dictonis cum 
dictione, quae sumpta est ex parte vocis; et si commutatur unum praedicamentum in 
aliud per similitudinem sumptam ex parte rei, tunc magis habet esse fallacia accidentis 
[it is true to say that when the cause accounting for a fallacy’s deceptive appearance 
has to do with how things are, then the fallacy at hand is not a fallacy depending on 
expression. Nevertheless, if one says that such is the case of form of expression, he is 
wrong. On the contrary, what causes its deception has to do with the similarity among 
expressions, either through the way these expressions designate things or through their 
verbal morphology. Besides, if one says that the fallacy of form of expression occurs 
when a shift between categories occurs, he is right, but this does not happen because 
of a similarity between things, rather because of a similarity between expressions. If 
the shift between two categories is brought about by a similarity between things, then 
such an argument is rather a fallacy of accident]» (Radulphi britonis quaestiones super 
sophisticos elenchos, qu. 32, pp. 118.38-119.4).

problem and related issues (namely, the shifting association of the Boethian 
inherited fallacy of univocation and –in turn– homonymy, ﬁ gure of speech 
and accident). As for today, I would like to add a new element to the picture. 
In order to do so I will follow a promising thread in an early –possibly the 
earliest– collection of quaestiones on Sophistici elenchi, whose author –a 
Parisian master of the 1270s– S. Ebbesen dubbed Anonymous cordubensis 
after the cordovan library where survives the only manuscript of his work. 
3. Anonymus C
SACRA PAGINA. Anonymi cordubensis quaestiones super sophisticos 
elenchos, q. 834, 352.14-353.28: «Consequenter quaeritur utrum ﬁ gura 
dictionis sit fallacia in dictione. Et quod non videtur: omnis fallacia cuius 
principium apparentiae est a parte [353] rei et non a parte vocis est fallacia 
extra dictionem et non in dictione; ﬁ gura dictionis est huiusmodi; quare et 
cetera. Maior patet, quia secundum Alexandrum ex hoc dicuntur fallaciae 
in dictione quia principium apparentiae habent a parte vocis, et fallaciae 
extra dictionem quia principium apparentiae habent a parte rei. Minor 
declaratur, nam ex eo quo ratio fallaciae sumitur ex sua causa apparentiae, 
et in quolibet modo fallaciae manet ratio fallaciae, necesse est in quolibet 
modo cuiuscumque fallaciae manere eandem causam apparentiae. Nunc 
in tertio modo ﬁ gurae dictionis non est principium apparentiae a parte 
vocis, ut patet ibi: “Coriscus est alter ab homine, ergo est alter a se”, 
“Coriscus” enim et “homo” nullam convenientiam habent. Quare ibi causa 
apparentiae erit a parte rei [next the question arises whether the form of 
expression, as a source of fallacious reasoning, depends on expression. 
This appears not to be the case. Any fallacy whose appearance has factual 
rather than verbal grounds is a fallacy independent of expression rather 
than a fallacy depending on it[a]. Such is the case of <the fallacy of> form 
of expression. This is why, etc. The major premise is obvious, since –
according to «Alexander»[b]– fallacies, which depend on expression, are 
so called because of the verbal nature of what produces their illusion; on 
the other hand, fallacies, which do not depend on expression, are so called 
because of the factual nature of what produces their illusion. The minor 
premise is thus to be explained: since a fallacy is what it is on account 
of what produces its illusion and what makes it the fallacy it is remains 
the same throughout its modes[c], it is necessary that what produces its 
illusion remains the same in whichever variety a given fallacy comes. 

258 
LEONE GAZZIERO
Now, in the third mode of fallacies that depend on form of expression[d], 
what produces the illusion does not depend on words, as it becomes clear 
through this example[e]: “Coriscus is other than man; thus he is other than 
himself”[f]. As a matter of fact, the expressions “Coriscus” and “man” have 
no resemblance at all. This is why what produces here the illusion will be 
factual in nature]». 
Notulae. [a] «OMNIS FALLACIA CUIUS PRINCIPIUM APPARENTIAE EST 
A PARTE REI ET NON A PARTE VOCIS EST FALLACIA EXTRA DICTIONEM ET NON 
IN DICTIONE». I.e. any fallacy whose illusion or (deceptive) appearance 
depends on the things we say rather than on the way we talk about them 
falls outside expression. Anonymus cordubensis holds fast to what was 
at that time a commonplace. As a matter of fact, as early as the Anonymi 
glosae in Aristotelis Sophisticos elenchos, p. 205.7-9 and p. 213.27-29 
the association between in dictione and a parte vocis, on the one hand, 
and extra dictionem and a parte rei, on the other hand, appears to be 
taken for granted. As it will be afterwards: cf. Anonymi summa sophis-

[b] «SECUNDUM ALEXANDRUM». As he already did in quaestio 820 
(p. 306.4-9) on this very issue, Anonymus C appeals here to the authority of 
what was believed to be Alexander of Aphrodisias’ exegesis of Aristotle’s 
Sophistici elenchi. The reference made to «Alexander» is merely a way of 
reproducing the traditional alternative, with a peculiar twist nonetheless, 
for the Anonymous is about to misapply it in his attempt to show –against 
Aristotle42 and, one might add, against exegetical common sense– that 
«form of expression» is a sophistic trick which does not depend on 
linguistic expression rather than one which exploits it to its advantage. 
[c] «IN QUOLIBET MODO FALLACIAE MANET RATIO FALLACIAE». Such continuity 
is quite understandable and reﬂ ects the fact that –as a general rule– fallacies 
related to the same family are to be solved in one and the same way43. It is 
nonetheless about to backﬁ re and become a rather strong argument against 
Anonymus cordubensis view. As a matter of fact, the same consideration 
may be put forward to prove the opposite, as an interesting development in 
a relatively close text is to show: «sed illud non videtur omnino esse verum, 
quia ratio fallaciae sumitur a principio apparentiae. Si igitur sit fallacia una 
in quolibet modo, oportet principium manere unum in quolibet modo; et 
cum in ﬁ gura dictionis principium apparentiae sit unitas vocis secundum 
qualitatem sub qua latent plura, cum similis modus appellandi non 
necessario habeat similitudinem vocis, non est hoc sufﬁ ciens ad principium 
in hac fallacia [but this does not appear to be entirely true, since a fallacy is 
what it is on account of what produces its illusion. Now, if a fallacy is the 
same throughout its modes, what makes a fallacy what it is will necessarily 
be the same in each mode. Further, given that what produces the illusion in 
a fallacy of the form of expression is the qualitative unity of words which 
happen to stand for multiple things, in so far as similar designations are 
not necessarily expressed in the same way, this is not enough to cause that 
particular fallacy]» (Anonymi salmaticensis-ﬂ orentini quaestiones super 
Sophisticos elenchos, q. 76, p 173.40-46 ; cf. q. 74, pp. 169.22 - 170.31). 
[d] «IN TERTIO MODO FIGURAE DICTIONIS». Anonymus C refers to the 
well-known confusion between a «this something» and «what qualiﬁ es it 
as the something it is» («ex mutatione quale quid in hoc aliquid»). Since

A.J. Smith, «TODE TI in Aristotle», The Classical Review, 35, 1921, 
p. 19 the issue has been widely studied. Two essential readings deserve 
a special mention: J. Kung, «Aristotle on Thises, Suches and the Third 
Man Argument», Phronesis, 26, 1981, pp. 207-247 and S. Ebbesen, «Hoc 
aliquid - Quale quid and the Signiﬁ cation of Appellatives», Philosophia, 
5-6, 1975-1976, pp. 370-392.
[e] «UT PATET IBI». What follows is very much the linchpin of Anonymus 
C’s argument, which he regarded himself as the most substantial piece of 
evidence in order to prove that this mode of ﬁ gura dictionis may be set 
apart from the others and be removed –so to speak– from within the sphere 
of language. 
[f] «CORISCUS EST ALTER AB HOMINE, ERGO EST ALTER A SE». What we have 
here is a distinguished argument in an abridged form. The missing premise 
–which is to be supplied from Aristotelis sophistici elenchi, 5, 166b 33– 
being: «Coriscus est homo [Coriscus is a man]». 
LECTURA. This is hardly the most memorable piece of Aristotelian 
scholarship the Latin Middle Ages left us, but it is most certainly a text that 
has the qualities of its faults. Three deserve to be pointed out in particular: 
1.  One of Anonymus C’s assumptions rests on an apocryphal source: 
the Latin version of a commentary by Alexander of Aphrodisias 
whose original greek version, if it ever existed, was long lost. 
2.  Anonymus C built his case on an example –«Coriscus est alter ab 
homine, ergo est alter a se»– which is both as Aristotelian as it gets 
and remarkably out of place. 
3.  Anonymus C hammered home his view by stating that «homo» and 
«Coriscus» bear no discernible similarity. 
PARERGA. Before taking up point two, which is by far the most 
important, a few words will sufﬁ ce to explain why one may leave aside 
issues one and three: 
1.  It is true that Anonymus C trusted an authority which we know 
today is not the one he thought it to be. However, it doesn’t really 
matter whether he took so basic a principle of Aristotelian doctrine 
as the distinction between paralogisms in dictione and extra 
dictionem –directly– from Aristotle or –indirectly– from Pseudo-
Alexander. Furthermore, the enigma of the «Latin Alexander» has 
been brilliantly solved by Sten Ebbesen, who has proved that the 

 
«UTRUM FIGURA DICTIONIS SIT FALLACIA IN DICTIONE» 
261
alleged Latin fragments of a lost Greek commentary by Alexander 
of Aphrodisias are, in fact, a set of scholia James of Venice drew 
from Micheal of Ephesus’ commentary on Aristotle’s Sophistici 
elenchi44. 
3.  It is also true that Anonymus C’s morphological speculations are 
completely beside the point. For one thing, he must have known 
very little Greek in order to miss the fact that, while «homo» and 
«Coriscus» do not bear any resemblance, Κορίσκος  and ἄνθρωπος 
do have the same form of expression. For another, he must have 
had very peculiar linguistic notions in order to believe that one may 
explain anything about what happens in his own language because 
of what happens in another. However, since the argument is an 
aristotelian example of the fallacy of accident45, it would reach its 
conclusion whatever the morphology of the words involved.
TRANSLATION MATTERS. When it comes to the second issue we 
encountered, it is an entirely different story. In fact, treating the «Coriscus 
other than himself» argument as a fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech provides us 
with a lead as to how and why accidens ended up playing a key role in 
a discussion whose focus is ﬁ gura dictionis, a different type of fallacy 
altogether. Since Anonymus cordubensis is far from being an isolated 
case, there’s only one plausible explanation for the consensus Latins 
reached over this particular issue, which is that the connection between the 
«Coriscus other than himself» argument and the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech 
was hinted at in Aristotle’s text itself. When Latin scholars rediscovered 
Aristotle’s Sophistici elenchi –that is, about the time of Peter Abelard, 
Thierry of Chartres and Adam of Balsham (mid-XIIth century)– it was by 
and large through Boethius’ translation46. Not only did Boethius take a few

which is, anyway, all Aristotelis sophistici elenchi, 22, 178b 36 - 179a 10 has 
to offer– the agument aims at inferring the existence of a third man (a τρίτος 
ἄνθρωπος precisely) besides man himself (παρ’ αὐτὸν) and individual 
men (καὶ τοὺς καθ’ ἕκαστον). Even if Aristotle’s main concern is to 
explain how to avoid the «Third man» rather than to recount the argument 
itself, one can be reasonably sure that the decisive move is to bring about 
the idea that the universal is on a par with the particulars whose universal 
it is, for –as Aristotle says in 179a 4-5– «οὐτὸ ἐκτίθεσθαι δὲ ποιεῖ τὸν 
τρίτον ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ τὸ ὅπερ τόδε τι εἶναι συγχωρεῖν [setting apart 
does not produce the “Third Man”, rather the admission that <what is set 
apart> is an individual thing]». All of which makes excellent sense, given 
that Aristotle thought that –no matter how dire the consequences– being 
wrong about which is which between particulars and universals is an easy 
mistake to make and, more to the point, a mistake we cannot easily avoid 
because of what can only be described as a fact of language. In fact, not 
only is it most natural to assume that everything we say refers to something 
that exists49, but such delusion is all the more likely to occur when talking 
about substances, as one can easily draw from a well-known passage of 
Aristotle’s Categories50, where the way we name things is held responsible 
49 Aristotelis sophistici elenchi, 6, 168a 25-26: «σύνηθες γὰρ τὸ πάντα ὡς τόδε 
τι σημαίνειν [we usually speak of everything as though it were an individual thing]»; 
cf. 7, 169a 33-34: «πᾶν τὸ κατηγορούμενόν τινος ὑπολαμβάνομεν τόδε τι [we 
trust everything predicated of something else to be an individual thing]». 
50 Aristotelis Categoriae, Ed. by R. BODÉÜS, Les Belles Lettres, Paris 2001, 5, 
3b 10-18: «πᾶσα δὲ οὐσία δοκεῖ τόδε τι σημαίνειν. ἐπὶ μὲν οὖν τῶν πρώτων 
οὐσιῶν ἀναμϕισβήτητον καὶ ἀληθές ἐστιν ὅτι τόδε τι σημαίνει· ἄτομον γὰρ 
καὶ ἓν ἀριθμῷ τὸ δηλούμενόν ἐστιν. ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν δευτέρων οὐσιῶν ϕαίνεται μὲν 
ὁμοίως τῷ σχήματι τῆς προσηγορίας τόδε τι σημαίνειν, ὅταν εἴπῃ ἄνθρωπον 
ἢ ζῷον· οὐ μὴν ἀληθές γε, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ποιόν τι σημαίνει, - οὐ γὰρ ἕν ἐστι τὸ 
ὑποκείμενον ὥσπερ ἡ πρώτη οὐσία, ἀλλὰ κατὰ πολλῶν ὁ ἄνθρωπος λέγεται 
καὶ τὸ ζῷον. οὐχ ἁπλῶς δὲ ποιόν τι σημαίνει, ὥσπερ τὸ λευκόν· οὐδὲν γὰρ 
ἄλλο σημαίνει τὸ λευκὸν ἀλλ’ ἢ ποιόν, τὸ δὲ εἶδος καὶ τὸ γένος περὶ οὐσίαν τὸ

refers to an individual thing. As far as primary substances are concerned it is true and 
undisputable that each refers to an individual thing, for what we refer to is something 
particular and one in number. As for the secondary substances, on the other hand, 
they seem to refer to an individual thing, as when we say “man” or “animal”, on 
account of the form of denomination (τῷ σχήματι τῆς προσηγορίας). Yet, this is 
not true, for they rather signify something that is such and such. In fact, the subject 
is not one, as in the case of primary substances; in fact, man and animal are said

for this confusion: the form of appellatives being roughly the same in all 
cases, it is not by means of a linguistic analysis that one shall settle whether 
a given name refers to a particular or to a universal thing. Be that as it may, 
Boethius’ translation of «καὶ ὅτι ἔστι τις τρίτος ἄνθρωπος παρ’ αὐτὸν 
καὶ τοὺς καθ’ ἕκαστον» was to change the game altogether, since it sounds 
«et quoniam est quis tertius homo A SE ET AB UNOQUOQUE», which is as literal 
as it gets, except for the fact that Boethius translated as if his Greek model 
read αὐτὸν  instead of αὑτὸν51. As a result, Latin commentators understood 
the expression tertius a se as if it meant either diversus a se (different from 
himself) or alter a se (other than himself), which –as far as I know– they did 
without exception52. Such understanding proved fatal for the «Third man». 
of many things. That being said, secondary substances do not mean a quality tout 
court, as white does. As a matter of fact, white means just a quality, whereas species 
and genus have more to do with a determination of the substance, they rather signify 
what qualiﬁ es a given substance as the substance it is]». For all practical purposes, the 
σχῆμα τῆς προσηγορίας is synonymous with the σχῆμα τῆς λέξεως of the fallacy 
of the same name: προσηγορία is the denomination according to a certain name (the 
term occurs in Aristotle’s deﬁ nition of παρώνυμα in chapter one of the Categories: 
«παρώνυμα δὲ λέγεται ὅσα ἀπό τινος διαϕέροντα τῇ πτώσει τὴν κατὰ τοὔνομα 
προσηγορίαν ἔχει, οἷον ἀπὸ τῆς γραμματικ ῆ ς ὁ γραμματικὸς καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς 
ἀνδρείας ὁ ἀνδρεῖος [we call paronym things that are named after something else 
through a ﬂ exion of the name of the latter: for instance, grammarian is named after 
grammar and brave after bravery]» (Aristotelis Categoriae, 1, 1a 12-15). Both notion 
and their relation have been thoroughly dealt with by F. Ildéfonse, «Ta skhêmata tês 
lexeôs», in M. S. CELENTANO – P. CHIRON – M.-P. NOËL (eds.), Skhèma/Figura. Formes 
et ﬁ gures chez les Anciens. Rhétorique, philosophie, littérature, Editions Rue d’Ulm/
ENS, Paris 2004, pp. 143-157. 
51 Since it is more than likely that the oncial letters of his manuscript lacked 
diacritical marks, it does not come as a surprise that Boethius got the breathing wrong.

To make another long story short, this is how the argument was reﬁ ned out 
of existence: Latin commentators just lost sight of the «Third man» as an 
argument and resorted to those they had at hand in order to make sense of 
what they read. As it happens, they had the good fortune and the ﬂ air to 
ﬁ nd a perfect match in Aristotle’s discussion of the fallacies of accident. 
As true to the text as Boethius allowed them to be, they were brought to 
take the «tertius a se» apart from the «ab unoquoque». Instead of thinking 
of them as two clauses of one and the same conclusion («there is a “third 
man” beside man and individual men»), Latin commentators considered 
the «tertius a se» and the «ab unoquoque» as two different conclusions («a 
given man is other than himself» and «he is other than any other man»). 
Therefore, if there are two conclusions instead of one, there are also two 
arguments rather than one. This split issue became the standard story and 
we ﬁ nd it repeated time and again in the XIIIth and XIVth centuries53. If the 
second line of reasoning, which stipulates that a man differs from any other 
(«ab unoquoque»), is usually treated as a mere repetition of the ﬁ rst, whose 
conclusion is that a man differs from himself («a se»)54, Latin commentators 
displayed sometimes an uncanny ingenuity. The palm of sophistication goes 
to Anonymus bavaricus who most of the time rates as an average, run-of-
the-mill commentator. On this occasion, nevertheless, he outdid himself

(and everybody else in the process). As a matter of fact, not only did he pull 
two arguments out of his sleeve where there was only one to begin with, 
but he also managed to match them perfectly with the ﬁ rst and the second 
example Aristotle offered of the fallacy of accident55. If symmetry is the seal 
of truth, seldom two wrongs came so close to make a right.
EPILEGOMENA. Whether in its more subtle formula or in its ordinary 
capacity, the appeal of this solution was immensely strong. While nothing 
in Aristotle’s words pointed in its direction, the association of the «Third 
man» and the «Coriscus other than himself» sophism proved so successful 
that more than one Latin reader believed he found it in Aristotle’s text 
itself. Around 1280, Simon of Faversham –who was neither the ﬁ rst nor the 
last to do so56– quoted Aristotle himself as the ﬁ nal authority on the issue: 
55 Anonymi bavarici lectura super librum Elenchorum, p. 88: «Primus paralogismus 
formatur sic: “ab homine Coriscus est alter; Coriscus est homo; ergo, alter a se”. 
Conclusionem solum ponit cum dicit: “ET QUONIAM QUIS”: id est, aliquis est homo tertius 
a se et paralogyzetur sicut dictum est. Tunc ponit alium cum dicit: “Coriscus est alter a 
Platone et Plato est homo, ergo alter ab homine”. Conclusionem ponit cum dicit “ET AB 
UNOQUOQUE” [the ﬁ rst paralogism goes like this: “Coriscus is other than man; therefore 
he is other than himself”. Aristotle states the conclusion only: “ET QUONIAM QUIS”, that 
is to say: some man is other than himself, and the paralogism is argued for as it has 
been said. Then he brings about the other paralogism: “Coriscus is other than Socrates; 
Socrates is a man; therefore Coriscus is other than man”. Aristotle states the conclusion 
when he says: “ET AB UNOQUOQUE”]». NOTA BENE: «ab homine Coriscus est alter; Coriscus 
est homo; ergo, alter a se» is none other than the ﬁ rst fallacy of accident Aristotle 
discussed at the beginning of chapter 5 of Sophistici elenchi (quoted above, note 45); 
while «Coriscus est alter a Platone et Plato est homo, ergo alter ab homine» –apart from 
the fact that Plato has replaced Socrates– is pretty much the same as the second fallacy 
of accident Aristotle discussed right after the ﬁ rst we just mentioned: «ἢ εἰ Σωκράτους 
ἕτερος, ὁ δὲ Σωκράτης ἄνθρωπος, ἕτερον ἀθρώπου ϕασὶν ὡμολογηκέναι διὰ 
τὸ συμβεβηκέναι οὗ ἔϕησεν ἕτερον εἶναι, τοῦτον εἶναι ἄνθρωπον [otherwise, if 
Coriscus is other than Socrates, since Socrates is a man, they pretend that it has been 
admitted that he is other than man because of the fact that man is predicated of Socrates 
and Coriscus is said to be other than Socrates]» (Aristotelis sophistici elenchi 5, 166b 
33-36).

«Philosophus dicit, secundo huius, quod hic est ﬁ gura dictionis: “Coriscus 
est alter ab homine; ergo, Coriscus est alter a se” [says the Philosopher, in 
the second book <of the Sophistici elenchi>, that we have here a case of 
fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech: “Coriscus is other than man ; therefore he is 
other than himself”]»57. It would not be historically accurate to say that the 
collapse of the Latin «Third man» brought alone the fallacy of accident and 
the fallacy of ﬁ gure of speech together. That said, the exegetical anomaly 
it turned out to be soon became the single strongest reason in favour of this 
unlikely association. At any rate, it proved compelling enough to make 
Latin commentators wonder wether some fallacies of form of expression 
fall outside expression itself and to persuade some of them that, contrary to 
all expectations, this may well be the case.
57 Simonis de Faverisham quaestiones novae super libro elenchorum, q. 19, 
p. 148.17-18. As is well known, a distinctive feature of the Latin tradition of Aristotle’s 
tract was its division in two books: the ﬁ rst ends at 16, 175 where the second begins. 
This division is –in all probability– a Latin invention, for there is no trace of it in 
Aristotle nor in the Greek and Byzantine tradition. That being said, it is far from 
arbitrary. As a matter of fact, the ﬁ rst ﬁ fteen chapter of Aristotle’s work’s focus is upon 
sophistic objectives (metae) and techniques (fallaciae). From chapter 16 on, Aristotle’s 
attention turns to the ways we can counter or neutralize sophistic arguments.


SIMO KNUUTTILA*
SCOTUS’S FORMAL SEMANTICS OF MODAL NOTIONS 
Duns Scotus introduced the notion of logical potency or possibility, 
which he discussed in various parts of his philosophical and theological 
treatises. Even though he did not write any separate study of this concept, 
it had a considerable inﬂ uence on philosophy and logic in the fourteenth 
century and later. In this paper I would like to pay attention to the logical 
layer of Scotus’s modal theory. I am particularly interested in his view that 
logical modalities are what they are independently of whether God exists 
or not and how this idea is related to Scotus’s assumption that the realm 
of intelligibility, which is not limited by anything but logical possibility, is 
actually inﬁ nite and cannot be other than it is.
1. Modal Metaphysics
In his modal metaphysics, Scotus famously makes use of a model of 
divine psychology in which various acts are separated by the instants of 
nature; that is, they are distinguished from each other conceptually but 
not temporally. This ﬂ exible tool is employed in a pragmatic rather than a 
systematic way. Scotus says, for example, that in the ﬁ rst instant of nature 
God understands itself as such and in the second instant everything that 
might be created, giving this collection an objective being as the object 
of understanding (esse intelligibile)1. The content of the actually inﬁ nite 
aggregate of understandable objects is said to have esse possibile with 
respect to divine power2. Scotus’s approach to intelligible possibilities 
is propositional in the sense that he describes them as what is meant by

complexes or propositions. In describing the logical potency which forms 
the basic level of all possibilities, Scotus writes:
This potency is a modus of a composition of intellect, and it is caused 
by the disposition of the terms of the composition, namely, that they 
are not repugnant. And though there often is a corresponding real 
potency in reality, it is not an essential part of the nature of this 
potency. In this way it was possible that the world will exist before 
its creation, if there was an intellect forming this composition ‘The 
world will exist’3. 
The possibility of what is expressed by the proposition ‘The world 
will exist’ exempliﬁ es Scotus’s notion of being which, in its most general 
sense, refers to everything to which to be is not repugnant4. The possibilities 
associated with a real activating power are called metaphysical or real 
possibilities, and are formally based on the logical potency or compatibility 
between the meanings of the terms used in the description of possibilities. 
The coherence of a proposition requires, of course, that the terms signify 
things which might be5.
Contrary to what some of Scotus’s followers assumed, he did not mean 
that God’s thought is required for the truth of true possibility propositions.

Scoti Opera Philosophica 6, ed. by R. ANDREWS et al., The Franciscan Institute, St. 
Bonaventure 1997, IX.1-2, n. 18 (514). This is meant to be an explanation of that notion 
of possibility in Aristotle which is not based on a potency. Many thirteenth-century 
authors refer to this conception in deﬁ ning divine omnipotence as a power to actualize 
what is not contradictory; see J. SCHMUTZ, «Qui a inventé les mondes possibles?», in 
J.-C. BARDOUT – V. JULLIEN (eds.), Les mondes possibles, Presses Universitaires de 
Caen, Caen 2006, pp. 9-45.
4 Scotus argues, for example, that when Aristotle says that in research into things 
one should ﬁ rst ask whether it is before asking what it is, this ‘whether it is’ (si est) 
should be not taken to refer to actual existence but to being as that to which existence is 
not repugnant. See Ordinatio IV.1.2, n. 8; L. M. DE RIJK, «Einiges zu den Hintergründen 
der scotischen Beweistheorie: die Schlüsselrolle des Sein-Könnens (esse possibile)», 
in A. ZIMMERMANN (ed.), Kölner Universität im Mittelalter, Miscellanea mediaevalia 7,

SCOTUS’S FORMAL SEMANTICS OF MODAL NOTIONS 
271
On the contrary, he says in many places that what is possible is possible 
because of itself, not because of something else. (See below.) Logical 
potencies or possibilities as compatibilities of meanings are not entities and 
have no kind of existence, but are like norms for any complex formed in 
understanding or realized by a power. Scotus’s assumption of the objective 
being of all coherent combinations in divine intellect did not mean that 
God created their logical possibility or is otherwise their source. This is 
not required because they are formally coherent by themselves. However, 
he believed that because the logical potency is not a power of existence, 
there is no path from logical possibilities to actuality except through the 
activating power of an existing being6. 
Possibilities are structured on the basis of the relation of compossibility. 
For each non-necessary possible state of affairs, its denial is also 
possible with respect to the same time, though not compossible. Logical 
impossibilities are parasites in the order of possibilities, being incompatible 
combinations between possible ingredients. Such combinations lack logical 
potency and consequently represent absolute nothingness7. The systematic 
role of compossibility in Scotus’s modal considerations is shown by his 
characterizing logical potency or possibility as non-incompatibility between 
the terms8. In his identity view of predication, the compatibility between 
signiﬁ cant units means their being simultaneously predicable of the same 
subject, so that the result does not represent the nothingness of impossibility9. 
Scotus explains his idea of possibility and truth by stating that at one 
instant of nature propositions about logically contingent things are present 
in the divine intellect without a truth value and at another instant the divine 
choice makes a number of propositions true; namely, those which express 
things included in divine providence pertaining to the actual world10. This

corresponds to his general view of the psychology of intellection, according 
to which propositions are understood as being neutral before they are 
understood as being true or false. Understanding the truth is a separate act 
about the relation between the proposition and what it signiﬁ es11. Antonie 
Vos and some others following him have stressed that God chooses those 
propositions to be true which express the states of affairs to be realized 
in the actual world, without making other propositions true with respect 
to possible worlds12. Scotus did not use the term ‘possible world’ and no 
medieval thinker developed anything like a systematic theory of various 
relations between possible worlds, which is typical of the possible worlds 
semantics of the last century. In spite of this, there are some similarities. 
According to possible worlds semantics, modality could be understood as 
multiplicity of reference with respect to alternatives, and this was a central 
idea in Scotus’s theory as well13. 
knowledge of the contingent complex, because the terms are not the cause of such 
truth because then it would be immediately true. Therefore the divine intellect has a 
neutral cognition of such terms before an act of the will, that is, the choice of the actual 
providence. […]  And so contingents of this kind are true because their truth is ﬁ rst 
caused by an act of the divine will. It is not the case that because these contingents 
are true, the will wills them to be true, but rather the reverse is the case. And therefore 
when the truth caused in a complex of such terms is determined by an act of will, then 
the divine intellect ﬁ rst knows one part of a contradiction of contingents to be true.»

13 Many late medieval thinkers, such as Scotus, Ockham, and Buridan, distanced 
themselves from traditional interpretations of Aristotle’s modal syllogistic and other 
received views of necessity and possibility. While the modal paradigms criticized, most 
typically the frequency model for necessity and possibility, were derived from ancient 
philosophy, the new concepts associated with the idea of modality as alternativeness were 
for the most part medieval, ﬁ rst suggested by some twelfth-century ﬁ gures and further 
developed in late medieval times, after the less innovative thirteenth-century Aristotle 
reception. Some elements of late medieval modal insights were embedded in Leibniz’s 

 
SCOTUS’S FORMAL SEMANTICS OF MODAL NOTIONS 
273
Scotus’s remarks on neutral propositions were associated with his 
theological view of why the actual world is as it is. One set of possibility 
propositions is true because of God’s decision to create the actual world. 
This choice could have been otherwise and correspondingly the contingent 
truths could be other than they are. Scotus states about alternative 
providential plans:
God contingently predestinates whom he predestinates and he 
may not predestinate that person, not both simultaneously nor 
successively, but both separately, in an instant of eternity. (Ord. 
I.40, n. 5, Ed. Vat. VI, 310)
If ‘Socrates will be beatiﬁ ed’ is contingently true, ‘Socrates will not 
be beatiﬁ ed’ would be true if the divine providential plan were different. 
It would not be true in a Leibnizian counterpart world, but it could be true 
in relation to an alternative of the actual world. It is also interesting that 
both alternatives are about the same possible person, not about separate 
counterparts as in Leibniz’s possible worlds or in Lewis’s parallel universes.
The basic structure of Scotus’s modal metaphysics can be summarized 
as follows. The actual world is a state of affairs which obtains. There is a 
complete set of propositions which are true about the contingent things in 
the actual world and an inﬁ nite number of possibility propositions which 
are not true about it. For each temporally deﬁ nite proposition p, the terms 
of which are not incompatible, there is a possible state of affairs S such that 
if S had been actual, p would have been formally true. The same holds for 
the conjunctions of propositions which are compossible. This is the kernel 
of the formal semantics of modality in Scotus. The assertoric part of a 
possibility proposition is formally true about the actual world or would be 
true if the world were different in a relevant way.  
philosophy of possible worlds and known through it by later writers, but otherwise these 
developments were hardly mentioned in philosophical works until the middle of the last 
century, when many scholars began to investigate medieval logic and semantics, including 
modal logic and modal theories. This interest was stimulated by the lively discussion of 
modalities in the 60s and 70s and also, but not only, by the observation that, as distinct 
from ancient theories, there were some similarities between the philosophical assumptions 
of medieval theories and Kripkean possible worlds semantics, most obviously the 
association of the meaning of modal terms with the idea of simultaneous alternatives.

2. The Actually Inﬁ nite Content of Intelligibility
In arguing for the inﬁ nity of divine omniscience, Scotus explains that 
when an omniscient intellect thinks about all thinkable things, the content 
of this act consists of an actually inﬁ nite number of intelligible things. His 
main interest is to shed light on the intensive inﬁ nity of divine knowledge, 
and he thinks that this kind of inﬁ nity is required by the actual quantitative 
inﬁ nity of the content of the faculty: 
Are there not […] inﬁ nite intelligibles and are these not actually in 
an intellect which actually understands everything? Therefore the 
intellect which actually understands all things at once is inﬁ nite […]
There can be no end of things which are potentially inﬁ nite, taking 
one after the other. If all these things are actually simultaneous, they 
are actually inﬁ nite. But intelligibles are like this with respect to a 
created intellect, as is clear, and in you [God] all things, which are 
intelligible for a creature successively, are actually simultaneously 
understood. Therefore there are there actually inﬁ nitely many things 
understood. (De primo principio IV.9, n. 68)14 
Beginning from the Aristotelian notion of potential inﬁ nity, which was 
the standard concept in natural philosophy of his time, Scotus moves to the 
actual quantitative inﬁ nity which he regards as not inconsistent in itself15. 
The intentional correlate of the divine intellect, the realm of what can be 
understood, is actually inﬁ nite and the same for any omniscient intellect, 
since the intellect is a power of grasping what is intelligible, and this is 
necessarily what it is for any intellect16. 
The idea of the inﬁ nite totality of what can be understood was used by 
Scotus in many places, one of these being his account of human psychology 
in the hypostatic union. Aquinas and Scotus follow Peter Lombard in

assuming that the cognitive capacities of Christ were as perfect as possible. 
According to Aquinas, Jesus Christ had three sorts of knowledge: the beatiﬁ c 
vision of God’s essence as a grace-based perfection, the infused knowledge 
of things in the world which in principle can be naturally known, and the 
standard human knowledge through abstraction from the phantasms. Christ 
saw the essence of God, as far as this was possible for a ﬁ nite mind, and 
all things in the created world through participation in the divine light in 
the beatiﬁ c vision. As for the infused knowledge, Aquinas states that the 
soul of Christ knew everything in the Word, that is, in the second person of 
the Trinity, which was the divine part of the hypostatic union. The infused 
knowledge which the intellect received from the Word was partially the 
same as the ﬁ rst knowledge, but Aquinas treated this as the perfection of 
the human passive intellect, which was activated by immediate divine 
causation. Christ’s habitual infused knowledge made him omniscient about 
things in the created order. He was not fully omniscient, however, since he 
did not have knowledge of God’s unrealized possibilities. Aquinas believed 
that ontological possibilities were determined by the essence of God and 
that God could have created things quite different from the actual ones. 
These unrealized metaphysical possibilities are not known to created ﬁ nite 
minds, which have only partial knowledge of God’s inﬁ nite essence17.
Deviating from Aquinas, Scotus argued that, apart from the immediate 
vision of the Godhead, the soul of Christ saw in the Word everything the 
omniscient Word saw, i.e., all facts about the actual world and its history 
as well as the actually inﬁ nite number of unrealized possibilities. This 
epistemic optimism was based on the view that possibilities are expressed 
by non-contradictory propositions which are similarly intelligible to 
any intellect. The statement that Christ could actually see in the Word 
everything the Word saw may be understood in two different ways: 
One way of understanding this is that the soul of Christ has one 
vision about the Word as the primary object and about all objects 
which shine in the Word as secondary objects, these secondary

objects being not separately attended to. It does not follow that 
an inﬁ nite act is required to found these attentions, because they 
are merely potential, and so no actual inﬁ nity is assumed since the 
object is not actual. In a second way it can be taken to mean that 
that there is a proper vision of each object and therefore an inﬁ nite 
number of actual visions is simultaneously received from the Word 
as a cause. This second way demands that something inﬁ nite is 
assumed, which seems to contradict many authoritative opinions of 
the philosopher and saints18.
Is the knowledge of inﬁ nite possibilities present in the soul in one act or 
several acts? While not arguing for the actually inﬁ nite number of separate 
acts in the human intellect of Christ, Scotus assumes that there might be an 
actually inﬁ nite number of simultaneous acts in a ﬁ nite intellect, if they are 
directly caused by a divine power. He wonders why should there be any 
limit, if there may be several simultaneous acts or simultaneous distinct 
aspects in one act. A third possibility is that the Christ may see in the Word 
everything he wants to see as in a mirror –while the whole content is not 
simultaneously actual, he always has access to the inﬁ nite knowledge in the 
Word. This is the view which Scotus seems to regard as most probable19.
Scotus’s somewhat surprising considerations of Christ’s knowledge 
show his interest in the conception of actual inﬁ nity, which he mostly 
treated as part of his idea of the intensive inﬁ nity of divine attributes. The 
assumption of inﬁ nite things in esse intelligibile is part of the theological 
model of God’s eternal choice between possible alternatives. When the 
basic criterion of the ways things could be is their consistent description, 
their number at this level is obviously inﬁ nite. As all possibilities are 
knowable by divine omniscience, their being known is best guaranteed by 
assuming that they form an actually inﬁ nite totality20. Such a totality could 
be formed by one and the same proposition as inﬁ nitely multiplied, but 
Scotus’s idea is, of course, that the propositions are different and express 
the inﬁ nity of the various ways things could be.

3. The Source of Possibility
Scotus says that when God thinks about something which could 
become actual, it is possible formaliter ex se and principiative through 
God. The latter qualiﬁ cation refers to its being produced in esse intelligibile 
by divine omniscience and then becoming included in esse possible with 
respect to divine omnipotence. These formulations are understood by 
some recent commentators as follows. Fabrizio Mondadori argues that 
the formal aspect of the possible is not dependent on God, but possibility 
is predicated of something which is apparently a thought in God’s mind. 
Tobias Hoffmann argues, like Mondadori, that Scotus denies that God is 
responsible for giving things the possibility of being. While possibilities do 
not depend on God in this sense, only God can initiate the eidetic natures of 
creatures of which possibility is predicated. If God did not exist, there would 
be no eidetic natures and thus no possibles to be considered. Richard Cross 
follows this interpretation21. According to the alternative interpretation, 
God is responsible for the objective being of esse intelligibile and esse 
possibile but not what they are22. 
Even though Scotus does not formulate his views as clearly as one 
might hope, he clearly did not make logical possibilities dependent on 
divine intellect in any way. Let us consider the example of the possibility 
of the world without God which Scotus discusses in many places, 
assuming that nothing exists and that there is then an intellect formulating 
a proposition which states that a world is possible. This proposition is said

to be true; similarly, what is afﬁ rmed by the proposition ‘The world will 
exist’ is said to be possible. No God is needed here23. In one variant of these 
arguments, Scotus adds that if God will be later, this is irrelevant for the 
logical possibility:
If, before the creation of the world, there was not only no world but 
also, per incompossibile, no God (although he began by itself exist 
and was then capable of creating the world), and if there had been 
an intellect before the world forming this ‘The world will exist’, it 
would have been possible because the terms are not incompatible, 
not on the basis of a principle in a possible being or a corresponding 
active principle, and in this case ‘The world will exist’ would not 
have been possible because of God’s potency but, formally speaking, 
because of the potency which was the non-incompatibility of these 
terms, although this non-incompatibility was also accompanied by 
an active potentiality with respect to this possibility. (Ordinatio 
I.7.1 n. 27, Ed. Vat. IV, 118-119)
Explicating the view that what a proposition expresses is possible if 
the terms are not incompatible, Scotus compares this formal possibility 
with potency based possibilities. He argues that propositional formal 
possibilities can be said to be possible by the potency derived from the 
compatibility of terms, without attention to potencies as powers. Elsewhere 
he calls this formal potency a logical potency.
In explaining the formal truth of a proposition, Scotus, as mentioned 
above, says that when a proposition is formed by an intellect, there is a 
formal truth or falsity in the act, depending on whether it conforms with 
things or not, independently of whether the proposition is asserted or not. 
Formal truth or falsity applies to any apprehensive act of combining or 
dividing signiﬁ cative terms24. Objective truth or falsity belongs to these 
complexes as asserted or denied. Formal truth as a relation of conformity 
between a cognitive representation and reality pertains to a small part 
of the representations expressed by compatible complexes which are 
formally possible, the majority of these being expressed by formally false

propositions. Similarly, a conceptually necessary proposition is said to be 
per se known independently of whether the subject understands that it is 
per se known25. The same holds for modal propositions in general; the 
formal modality qualiﬁ es a proposition on the basis of the logical potency 
or impotency, independently of whether anyone attends to the compatibility 
or incompatibility of the meanings of terms.
An omniscient intellect immutably knows everything that can be 
signiﬁ ed by the combinations of compatible terms and provides them with 
an ontological status as the objects of understanding. Having this image in 
mind Scotus often speaks about possibilities as divine thoughts. Because 
of God’s eternal act of thinking, the meanings of all consistent propositions 
occur in intelligible being necessarily, because the divine intellect is not 
free, and they form an actually inﬁ nite realm of possible representations 
of how things could be. This part of Scotus’s modal theology had many 
followers, such as Mastrius. It is also the view of Leibniz who distances 
himself from other interpretations: 
The late Jacob Thomasius […] made the apt observation […] that 
one ought not to say, with some Scotists, that the eternal truths 
would subsist, even if there were no intellect, not even that of God. 
For it is, in my opinion, the divine intellect which makes the eternal 
truths real, although his will has no part in it. Whatever is real must 
be founded in something existent. It is true that an atheist may be 
a geometer, but if there were no God, there would be no object of 
geometry, and without God there would neither be anything existent 
nor anything possible26.
Treating possibilities as divine thoughts played an important role in 
Scotus’s theological creationism. While these reiﬁ ed possibilities had an 
objective being as a consequence of the intensively inﬁ nite attributes of 
the metaphysically simple and perfect divine entity, they were formally 
possible by themselves and not by divine activity. All interpreters seem to 
agree with this picture. Divided opinions concern the question of whether 
Scotus assumed that the objects of God’s thought are formally possible 
by themselves or vice versa. The abstract question of the ﬁ rst origin of

SIMO KNUUTTILA
modalities is not directly relevant for understanding Scotus’s modal 
semantics, to be sure, but it is of some interest that Scotus would have 
not accepted the view of Leibniz just quoted. Formal possibilities and 
impossibilities receive some kind of objective existence when there is any 
intellect whatsoever which forms a proposition, but the possibilities or 
impossibilities which are expressed by the propositions are not constituted 
by them. If these are the meanings of the propositions, should they be 
actual in order to be called possible? 
The terms of esse intelligibile and esse possibile are used in Ordinatio 
I.43 as part of Scotus’s answer to Henry of Ghent’s theological arguments 
about whether the reason for being impossible is derived from God or other 
things. Scotus explains that while possibilities can be discussed as having esse 
possibile with respect to divine power, this status is derived from their being 
ﬁ rst understood and having a being in esse intelligibile in divine thought:
An object is not primarily possible because of the potency by 
reason of which it [God] is understood to be omnipotent, but by the 
divine intellect which ﬁ rst produces it in intelligible being, and the 
intellect is not formally the active power by which God is said to be 
omnipotent, and when a thing is produced in such a being, namely 
intelligible, by the divine intellect in the ﬁ rst instant of nature, it has 
by itself a possible being in the second instant of nature because it 
is not formally repugnant for it to be and it is formally repugnant 
for it to have a necessary being by itself. (Ordinatio I.43, n. 14, Ed. 
Vat. VI, 358) 
These possibilities are formaliter possibilities by themselves and 
principiative by the intellect because their objective being is caused by the 
divine act of production27. 
Scotus assumes that the basic level of divine modal knowledge can be 
described as an actually inﬁ nite and complete set of understood propositions 
which express the possible ways things could be. When the divine 
combinatory art ﬁ lls the area which is ﬁ xed by these conditions, everything 
that is formally possible receives a minor intentional existence as an object 
of God’s mind. If such an inﬁ nite knowledge did not exist, even then one 
could say that if any of these propositions is formulated, it would express a 
possibility, and if it is a possibility proposition, it would be true.

4. Formal Modality  
When Scotus discussed the omniscient divine or human mind, he found 
it convenient to deal with possibilities in a formal way instead of describing 
what they are. This was also the part of his theory which proved to be 
inﬂ uential. In this approach, possibilities are primarily deﬁ ned as logical 
possibilities which are expressed by propositions the terms of which are 
not mutually exclusive and to which being is not repugnant in this sense. 
If the terms are incompatible, the propositions express impossibility, and if 
their denials are incompatible, they express necessity. Because this structure 
pertains similarly to divine and human intellect, possibilities are treated as if 
in the eternal instant. Questions of time and power are discussed separately 
and do not belong to the essence of the formal theory, except that singular 
contingency propositions can be treated as temporally deﬁ nite. The semantics 
of contingency propositions is spelled out with respect to the actual order in 
which they are true, but could be false, or are false, but could be true. 
A special feature of Scotus’s theory is that he often operates with the 
idea that there is an actually inﬁ nite number of ways in which things could 
be. An inﬁ nite mind is needed for knowing them all simultaneously, but this 
mind does not decide what belongs there and what does not. The reason 
for the assumption of actual quantitative inﬁ nity in Scotus is the idea of 
the completeness of the realm of intelligibility. It includes all the ways 
things could be. Their being knowable through possibility propositions is 
conceptually prior to their being known, and they are exhaustively known 
through an actually inﬁ nite number of different possibility propositions. 
I don’t comment on the philosophical problems associated with the 
assumption of actual inﬁ nity of intelligibility. It is a historically interesting 
part of an attempt to explain how the realm of logical possibilities is ﬁ xed 
independently of divine omniscience. In Scotus’s metaphysical theism, the 
eidetic content of signiﬁ cative units and their combinations are primarily 
understood by divine intellect, but this takes place necessarily with respect 
to the complete realm of what might be. This has existence only when it is 
understood, but it is not constructed by understanding it28.
28 That the possibilities are what they are is called a brute metaphysical fact in

Formal or logical modality is discussed here as a non-temporal matter. 
The modalities relevant in discussing nature and action need a reference 
to time and power, and this is the next step in Scotus’s theory, in which 
the formal theory is regarded as basic. This was an inﬂ uential model 
in the fourteenth century. The theory of modal syllogistic and modal 
consequences was developed at the level of logical modalities, and the 
theories of power, time, and natural modality were treated separately, 
using the formal theory as a normative background. There were some 
areas in which logical modalities and natural or otherwise conditionalized 
modalities were treated in interplay. In theology, the distinction between 
God’s absolute and ordained power was understood as partially analogous 
to that between logical and natural modalities, and this was even more 
inﬂ uential in natural philosophy and its interest in investigating the 
principles of natural philosophy secundum imaginationem, by assuming 
contrafactual and logically possible cases in order to see what followed29.

by way of a disjunctive sentence or a conjunctive sentence, that is in 
scholastic terms, a descent can be done disiunctim, but not disiunctive 
nor copulative:
Suppositio personalis confusa tantum est acceptio termini pro 
quolibet, quod signiﬁ cat ex impositione vel naturaliter proprie, sub 
quo virtute istius acceptionis licet ﬁ eri descensum ad sua singularia 
per propositionem de disiuncto extremo et non per propositionem 
disiunctivam nec copulativam. Sic supponit praedicatum in ista 
propositione “Omnis homo est animal”, sub ipso enim licet ﬁ eri 
descensum ad eius supposita per propositionem de disiuncto 
extremo et non per propositionem disiunctivam nec copulativam. 
Unde bene sequitur “Omnis homo est animal, ergo omnis homo est 
illud vel illud animal”, ita quod hoc totum disiunctum “illud vel 
illud animal” est veriﬁ cabile de isto termino “homo” sumpto cum 
distributione signiﬁ cative accepto1.
He then adds a longer passage in which he criticizes the view of 
«some» who add to this deﬁ nition «vel copulatim», that is, that the relev-
ant descent can be done by way of a sentence with a disjunct extreme

or with a conjunct extreme. This addition, however, is superﬂ uous accor-
ding to Albert2.
This view criticized here by Albert is clearly that of Thomas Maulfelt 
who deﬁ nes merely confused supposition thus, that a descent can be done 
by way of a sentence with a disjunct (and conditionalized) extreme or 
with a conjunct extreme. (The clause «condicionatim = de condicionato 
extremo» need not concern us here.) Thomas for his part states that the 
deﬁ nition which only comprises a descent by way of a sentence with a 
disjunct extreme is insufﬁ cient, indeed false3.
The case for Thomas’s addition of the clause «vel copulatim» to the 
deﬁ nition of merely confused supposition is the analysis of the sentence 
«Sortes differt ab omni homine» which does not allow a descent under 
«homine» disiunctim, but only copulatim, since Socrates is this man or that 
man or that man etc., but he is not this man and that man and that man etc. 
This is faithfully reported by Albert4.
So we have Albert’s view that a definition such as that of Thomas 
comprises more than needed, and Thomas’s view, that a definition 
such as that of Albert is insufficient. As a matter of fact, the definition 
of suppositio confusa tantum given by Albert in his Logica seems to 
be the common one. It is to be found in this or that way in, e.g., 
William of Ockham5, John Buridan6, Marsilius of Inghen7, John of

Holland8. For chronological reasons Maulfelt’s target seems to be 
Ockham.
Surprisingly enough, however, Albert in his Sophismata holds the 
very view he criticizes in the Logica. In the introduction to the section on 
terms like «differt» in the second part of the Sophismata, Albert says that 
deﬁ ning merely confused supposition in terms of a descent by way of a 
sentence with a disjunct extreme is insufﬁ cient. Rather one needs to add 
«or with a conjunct extreme»9. So here he adheres to the view of Maulfelt10. 
The crucial passage runs:
Dico, quod communiter auctores non sufﬁ cienter deﬁ niunt 
suppositionem confusam tantum deﬁ nientes eam sic, quod 
suppositio tantum est, virtute cuius sub termino sic supponente 
valet descendere ad eius supposita per propositionem de disiuncto 
extremo, sed oportet addere “vel de copulato extremo”, quo addito 
suppositio confusa tantum est sufﬁ cienter deﬁ nita. Modo, licet in illa 
propositione “Omnis homo differt ab omni homine” non possit ﬁ eri 
descensus sub isto termino “homine” ad eius supposita disiunctim, 
tamen valde bene copulatim11.
If the Logica Alberti and the Sophismata Alberti would have been 
handed down to us anonymously, we certainly would assume that they 
were composed by two different authors. But there is not the slightest 
doubt regarding the authenticity of these two works, indeed they are the 
most important and most famous works of Albert’s in the ﬁ eld of logic. So 
given the identity of the author, it follows that Albert has changed his mind 
on these matters.

I must confess, however, that I have not yet any convincing idea 
regarding why, when and in what direction this change of mind of Albert’s 
took place.
In the introduction to my edition of the Logica Alberti, I have argued 
that there are two redactions of the Logica, the ﬁ rst dating from the ﬁ rst 
half of the 1350s, the second dating from 1360, and that the Sophismata are 
composed after the ﬁ rst and before the second redaction of the Logica12.
By the way, since then I even got inclined to assume a third redaction 
of the Logica in between, so that we had a ﬁ rst redaction without any 
treatise on dialectical consequences, that is on the Topics, a second one 
with such a treatise at the very end of the whole work, that is in Treatise 
VI after the Insolubles and Obligations, and ﬁ nally a third redaction with 
that treatise on the Topics incorporated into Treatise IV on Consequences. 
The assumption of such a third redaction is also indirectly corroborated 
by an extant anonymous Logica clearly dependent on Albert’s which is 
incomplete and scattered in two manuscripts preserved in Prague13.
Regarding the Sophismata, Mischa von Perger and I have seen now 
almost all known manuscripts and prints, and in all of these witnesses, the 
pertinent text is quite the same, as was already noted.
The tradition of the Logica, however, has some surprising peculiarities 
in this respect: The Erfurt manuscript, Codex Amplonianus Quarto 242, 
which represents the ﬁ rst redaction, has «per propositionem de disiuncto 
extremo vel de copulato extremo», that is, Maulfelt’s view, and has no trace 
at all of the passage «Nec valet, quod aliqui addunt “vel copulatim”»14:
Suppositio personalis confusa tantum est acceptio termini pro 
quolibet, quod signiﬁ cat ex impositione vel naturaliter proprie, 
[pro] <sub> quo virtute illius suppositionis [licet] potest ﬁ eri

So here the Logica does agree with the Sophismata regarding merely 
confused supposition. The Leipzig manuscript (= L), containing the third 
redaction, and dated from 1381, has the deﬁ nition «per propositionem de 
disiuncto vel copulato extremo» together with the «Nec valet»-passage, 
what yields of course an incoherent text15. Quite the same is true of the 
print of 1522 (= X), but the editor Pietro Aurelio Sanudo apparently has 
tried to save the passage, e.g. by omitting «vel copulato extremo» in the 
deﬁ nition and by adding «secundum quosdam», so that the incoherence 
with the «Nec valet»-passage is not that manifest16. By the way, in the 
margin, Sanudo refers to Peter of Mantua as a supporter of the «vel 
copulatim»-view, Maulfelt apparently being unknown to him.

The presumably oldest manuscripts of the Logica, however, viz. Paris, 
BnF, lat. 14715, Pommersfelden, Schlossbibliothek 236, and Prague, 
NK, IV. G. 417, unanimously have the deﬁ nition with only «de disiuncto 
extremo» and the «Nec valet»-passage. By the way, this very passage is 
also edited from six manuscripts and the early print as an appendix to 
Stephen Read’s paper of 1991 on Albert of Saxony vs. Thomas Maulfelt18.
So it seems that the Sophismata text is stable, whereas the Logica text 
is not19. Perhaps this means that the Sophismata antedate the Logica, and 
also, that in the course of the development of the Logica, the Maulfelt-
view has been abandoned by Albert. This does not ﬁ t well, however, with 
the fact that in the Sophismata there are clear references to the Logica, but 
that there are none in the opposite direction, apart from a single implicit 
17 See Albert von Sachsen, Logik, op. cit., pp. LXX-LXXIV, nos. 21, 24, 27. Cf., 
e.g., also Paris, BnF, lat. 18430, f. 18va-b.

19 In his Quaestiones circa Logicam, qu. 17, ad rationem 5am, Albert only says that 
in ‘Sortes differt ab omni homine’ the term ‘homine’ stands non distributive. If this 
meant confuse tantum, there would be a further conﬂ ict with his determinate view. But 
presumably non distributive means immobiliter (in the sense of not allowing a descent 
to a conjunction of sentences) and covers both determinate and merely confused 
supposition. See M. J. FITZGERALD (ed.), Albert of Saxony’s Twenty-Five Disputed 
Questions on Logic, Brill, Leiden – Boston – Köln 2002, pp. 238-239, § 311, and 
p. 244, § 321 (Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, 79), with a 
text not completely correct, however.

reference in only some of the witnesses (viz. at the end of ch. III.10 on 
sentences with «incipit» and «desinit»)20.
Now, it is true, of course, that there is a logically relevant difference 
between the passages at stake in the Logica and in the Sophismata, since in 
the former the example used is the singular sentence «Sortes differt ab omni 
homine», whereas in the latter it is the universal sentence «Omnis homo 
differt ab omni homine». By the way, this very difference is sometimes 
explicitly stated in the relevant tradition, e.g. in Marsilius of Inghen or 
in the ﬁ rst Berlin-text (edited in the appendix below) under the name of 
a certain Hoklem21. But with Albert, it is the proper deﬁ nition of merely 
confused supposition that is primarily called into question.
Regarding the singular sentence «Socrates differs from every man», 
there are the following views: For Maulfelt, the term «man» has merely 
confused supposition in the sense of a descent to a conjunct extreme 
(copulatim), because the following inference holds: «Socrates differs from 
every man, therefore Socrates differs from this and this and this man» and 
so on for every single man. The consequent is true as well as the antecedent, 
because Socrates is not this man and this man and this man and so on, but 
rather this man or that man or that man and so on, as was already stated 
above (see also the second Berlin-text edited in the appendix below)22.
For Albert, as a Maulfelt-critic, however, this is not a case of merely 
confused supposition, but rather of determinate supposition, what implies 
a descent to a disjunctive sentence (disiunctive as opposed to disiunctim). 
So according to Albert, it follows that Socrates differs from this man, or 
Socrates differs from this man, and so on. Since all but one part of this 
disjunction are true, the disjunction itself is true, the false part being the one 
where «this man» refers to Socrates himself (for the logical details I refer to 
the ﬁ ne studies by Stephen Read, Christoph Kann, and Hartmut Brands)23.

Some light on this 14th century discussion, even though unfortunately 
not on the problem found in Albert of Saxony24, is shed by an interesting 
miscellaneous manuscript on logic dating from the ﬁ rst half of the ﬁ fteenth 
century, viz. Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Ms. lat. 
fol. 206, a paper manuscript of some 330 folios, partly dated from 1433 
(f. 152ra), with references to Rostock (f. 165ra) and Lübeck (f. 290rb). 
Our problematic sentence «Sortes differt ab omni homine» is treated as 
a sophisma twice in it (see below). About the ﬁ rst half of this manuscript 
is ﬁ lled by John Dorp’s Commentary on Buridan’s Summulae25. Another 
part, e.g., deals with some of Albert of Saxony’s Sophismata26. And several 
parts are commentaries on Marsilius of Inghen’s parva logicalia27.
The two parts relevant for my purpose here are an anonymous 
commentary on Marsilius of Inghen’s Suppositiones, ff. 287ra-300vb, and an 
anonymous commentary on Marsilius’s Consequentiae, ff. 311ra-320vb. The 
sophisma «Sortes differt ab omni homine» does occur in both of those works, 
the ﬁ rst occurrence is on ff. 294va-295va, the second one on ff. 318vb-319va.

«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE»

The very nature of a sophisma consists in there being good reasons for 
considering the sentence at stake as being true, as well as for considering 
it as being false. In our case, the ﬁ rst intuition, presumably, will be that 
the sentence is false, because there is one man from whom Socrates does 
not differ, namely Socrates himself. On the other hand, Socrates is not 
identical with every man, so it is true that he differs from every man.
Exactly these points are nicely stated at the beginning of the ﬁ rst 
sophisma (f. 294va-b). Disproof: Socrates differs from every man, 
Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates differs from himself. The consequent 
is impossible, the minor sentence is true, so the major sentence will be 
false; but that is precisely the sophisma.
The proof is given by way of the interpreting sentences (exponentes): 
Socrates exists, and every man exists, and Socrates is not every man; 
therefore Socrates differs from every man.
The response, at the end, states that the sophisma is true, as is shown 
by the interpreting sentences just quoted. The disproof is rejected, because 
the term «man» in the sophisma is not distributed. And this is indeed the 
crucial point here, viz. «every» as a part of the predicate «every man» 
versus «every» as a quantiﬁ er of the predicate «man».
In between it is stated that the ablative following the verb «differt» 
has confuse distributive supposition, as long as no other distributive sign 
does prevent this, because in that case, the supposition would change to non 
distributive. And here occurs a reference to a certain Hoklem who is reported 
to say that when a further distributive sign is added, the supposition changes 
from confuse distributive to determinate, if the sentence is a singular or an 
indeﬁ nite one, or to merely confused, if the sentence is a universal one. 
So in the sophisma «Sortes differt ab omni homine» the term «homine» 
has determinate supposition according to this Hoklem, since it is within 
the scope of two distributive signs in a singular sentence, viz. the negation 
(semantically) included in «differt» and the universal quantiﬁ er «omni».
I take «Hoklem»28 to be a misspelling of «Ockham», and the reference 
could be to his Summa Logicae, part I, chapter 7429. By far better, however, 
the passage at the end of column 295ra is matched by Marsilius of Inghen’s 
16th rule of suppositions30.
28 Further occurrences of this name are, e.g., on ff. 289va, 296ra, 296rb.

In the second sophisma there is one argument (at the end of col. 319rb) 
saying that the resulting sentences from the descent, called descendentes 
here, are false and that, as a consequence, the sophisma itself is false. In 
support for this, it is claimed that the term «man» in the sophisma has merely 
confused supposition, because it is within the scope of two distributive 
signs, and that, as a consequence, the descent must be disiunctim. But since 
Socrates is this or this or this man, he does not differ from this or this or this 
man, and so the sophisma is false.
In responding to this argument the Anonymous refers to two views 
(opiniones), the ﬁ rst ascribed to Magister Thomas Maulvelt31, the second 
to Biridanus, Mercilius et alii moderni loyci.
The first opinion, attributed to Maulfelt, is not well stated, since 
the crucial copulatim-point is missed. It is said that according to 
Maulfelt the term «man» has merely confused supposition, but that the 
descent must not be disiunctim, as the previous argument suggested, 
but otherwise. The following descent, however, is not a copulatim 
one, but such that the disjunct term is outside the scope of «differs», 
viz. preceding it rather than following it, as in the argument which is 
rejected here.
The second view, attributed to Buridan, Marsilius, and further 
modern logicians, is presented thus that the term «man» in the sophisma 
does not stand in merely confused supposition, but rather in determinate 
supposition. Accordingly they say that not always merely confused 
supposition results, when two distributive signs affect the same term, but 
only when this term is distributed, what, however, is not the case with 
our sophisma.
So this source clearly distinguishes the Maulfelt-view on the one 
hand, and the view of Buridan and Marsilius on the other. To the former, 
we may add the Albert of the Sophismata Alberti and Peter of Mantua, 
to the latter we may add Ockham, the Albert of the Logica Alberti, 
and John of Holland32 who is closely following the Logica Alberti, as 
is shown by his editor Egbert Bos33. It must be noted, however, that 
Buridan explicitly says that the term «homine» in the sentence «A 
31 The spelling here seems to be ‘Maulvelvelt’, perhaps (but rather unlikely) 
‘Mauwelvelt’. Cf. also f. 290va.

«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE» 
293
differt ab omni homine» has merely confused supposition34, so that his 
mention among the supporters of the determinate view seems not to be 
correct.
Albert of Saxony is not even mentioned here by name but, as we have 
shown, he exempliﬁ es both ways of dealing with such sophismata. It would 
be natural to assume that Albert of Saxony’s change of mind in this respect 
is due to the intellectual milieu at Paris in the 1350s. But again, the details 
are unfortunately completely unknown. And scarcely known are also the 
details of times and places of Maulfelt’s teaching and writing as well as of 
the reception of his ideas, although he seems to be the crucial ﬁ gure in this 
particular debate.

HARALD BERGER
Notandum, quod sophisma est motum, ut videantur suppositiones 
terminorum et etiam, qualiter praesens sophisma et aliae propositiones 
de ly “differt” habeant exponi. Ut igitur habeatur notitia expositionum 
propositionum <talium>, ideo de hoc movenda sunt in sequentibus 
sophismata.
Unde duplex est propositio de hoc verbo “differt”, quaedam est pure 
afﬁ rmativa, ubi nulla ponitur negatio expresse seclusa negatione inclusa in 
hoc verbo “differt”, exemplum ut haec “Sortes differt a Platone”. Sed alia 
est propositio negativa de hoc verbo “differt”, ubi expresse ponitur negatio 
praecedens hoc verbum “differt”, exemplum dicendo “Sortes non differt a 
se”.
Et illarum propositionum de ly “differt” quaedam sunt praesentis 
temporis, quaedam sunt de hoc verbo “differt” praeteriti vel futuri temporis. 
Et secundum hoc aliter et aliter propositiones de ly “differt” exponuntur.
Notandum secundo, quod duo sunt modi exponendi propositionem 
afﬁ rmativam de hoc verbo “differt”: Unus modus est, quod debeat exponi 
per duas propositiones solum, sic quod prima exponens sit positio subiecti 
cum hoc verbo “est” secundo adiacente, secunda debet esse negativa, in 
qua removetur praedicatum a subiecto. Et sic ista “Sortes differt a Platone” 
deberet exponi sic “Sortes est et Sortes non est Plato”. Secundum istum 
modum haec esset vera “Sortes differt a chimaera”, quia exponeretur sic 
“Sortes est et Sortes non est chimaera”, quae exponentes sunt verae.
Sed ille modus non est communis, ideo est alius modus, quod 
propositio afﬁ rmativa de ly “differt” debeat exponi per tres exponentes, in 
quarum prima est positio subiecti et in secunda positio praedicati cum hoc 
verbo “est” secundo adiacente et tertia debet addi, ubi sit remotio praedicati 
de subiecto, sicud patuit in expositione sophismatis. Et sic illa esset falsa 
“Sortes differt a chimaera”, et hoc consonat dicto Philosophi dicentis, quod 
alietas et differentia non est nisi rerum existentium. Modo chimaera nihil 
est, igitur etc.
Sed propositiones de hoc verbo “differt” praeteriti vel futuri temporis 
debent similiter exponi per tres exponentes, nisi quod addatur aliquod 
restrictivum identitatis, sic quod in exponente et exposita denotetur idem 
tempus. Ideo ista “Sortes differebat a Platone” debet sic exponi “Sortes 
aliquando fuit et Plato tunc fuit et Sortes <tunc> non /295ra/ fuit Plato, 
igitur Sortes differebat a Platone”. Similiter dicatur de futuro.
Sed propositio de hoc verbo “differt” negativa, ubi ponitur expresse 
negatio praecedens hoc verbum “differt”, communiter debet exponi per 

 
«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE» 
295
unam disiunctivam compositam ex partibus contradicentibus partibus 
copulativae, per quam exponebatur propositio afﬁ rmativa de hoc verbo 
“differt”. Et hoc <est> verum, si subiectum in negativa sit terminus 
singularis vel terminus communis distributus. Exemplum, ut “Sortes non 
differt a Platone”, quae exponitur per hanc disiunctivam, scilicet “Sortes 
non est vel Plato non est vel Sortes est Plato, igitur”, ubi partes istius 
disiunctivae contradicunt partibus copulativae propositionis afﬁ rmativae 
de hoc verbo “differt”. Sed si subiectum in negativa sit terminus 
communis non distributus, tunc non oportet, quod partes disiunctivae 
sint contradictoriae, sed sufﬁ cit, quod prima et ultima exponens sint 
subcontrariae partibus copulativae. Exemplum dicendo “Homo non 
differt ab animali”, quae sic exponitur “Homo non est vel animal non est 
vel homo est animal, igitur”, ubi partes disiunctivae sunt subcontrariae 
partibus copulativae propositionis afﬁ rmativae de hoc verbo “differt”, et 
sic de aliis.
Item notandum, quod ablativus sequens hoc verbum “differt” 
supponit confuse distributive, dummodo regatur ab isto verbo mediante 
[propositione!] <praepositione> “a” vel “ab” [etc.] <et> si sit terminus 
distribuibilis et non superveniat aliquod signum impediens.
Dicitur primo “dummodo regatur”, quia dicendo sic “Homo et asinus 
differunt specie” ly “specie” non distribuitur, quia si sic, tunc propositio 
esset falsa, quia valeret tantum “Homo et asinus omni specie differunt”, 
quae est falsa, quia stat, quod homo et asinus conveniant in specie 
accidentali, sic quod uterque sit niger, igitur. Etiam hic “Genus est, quod 
praedicatur de pluribus differentibus specie” ly “specie” non distribuitur. 
Similiter in ista “Homo a bruto differt anima rationali” ly “anima rationali” 
non distribuitur, quia alias haec esset falsa “Homo ab asino differt anima 
rationali”, quia valeret tantum “Homo ab asino quacumque anima rationali 
differt”, quae manifeste est falsa.
Dicitur notanter “si non superveniat aliquod signum impediens”, quia 
si superveniat aliquod signum distributivum in propositione singulari vel 
indeﬁ nita, tunc supponeret determinate, ut dicit Hoklem, sed in propositione 
universali supponeret confuse tantum. Ideo in sophismate ly “homine” stat 
secundum eum determinate propter duo signa distributiva cadentia super 
eundem terminum, [super! super!] <scilicet> ly “omni” et “differt”, quae 
se mutuo impediunt. Et quod hoc verbum “differt” distribuit<ur>, hoc est 
ratione negationis inclusae, quae expresse ponitur in tertia eius exponente, 
et illa negatio est negans.

296 
HARALD BERGER
Diceres: Tunc negat copulam et sic illa esset negativa “Sortes differt 
ab omni homine”. Respondetur, quod <solum> negat /295rb/ copulam in 
una suarum exponentium, sicud patet in tertia exponente.
Per hoc patet responsio ad sophisma dicendo, quod sophisma sit 
verum, ut patuit per eius exponentes.
Ad rationem in contrarium dicitur, quod bene probaret verum, si ly 
«homine» in sophismate distribueretur. Modo patet ex dictis, quod non 
distribuitur.
<Sequitur immediate, sed aliquid deesse videtur:>
Item arguitur: Sophisma non potest exponi per quattuor <!> exponentes, 
quia peccatum est ﬁ eri per plura, quod aeque bene potest ﬁ eri per pauciora, 
sed duae exponentes <Aliquid deest!>.
<Aliquid desse videtur!>
Sed contra: Sic sequeretur bene “Sortes differt ab omni homine, ergo 
<Sortes> differt ab isto homine et Sortes differt ab isto homine et sic de 
aliis”. Consequentia videtur tenere a toto in quantitate ad suas partes, sed 
consequens est falsum, quia est una copulativa, cuius una pars est falsa, 
scilicet ista “Sortes differt ab isto homine” demonstrando Sortem.
Secundo sic: Ab eo, quod nihil est, nihil differt ex dictis, sed nihil est 
omnis homo, igitur nihil differt ab omni homine, igitur etc.
Tertio: Sequeretur bene “Sortes differt ab omni homine, igitur ab 
omni homine differt Sortes”. Consequentia tenet per Aristotelem secundo 
Perihermeneias “Nomina et verba transposita idem signiﬁ cant”. Sed 
consequens est falsum, quia sequeretur “Sortes ab omni homine differt, 
igitur Sortes a se ipso differt”. Consequentia tenet a superiori distributo ad 
inferius.
Quarto sic: Sequitur “Sortes differt ab omni homine, ergo Sortes differt 
ab isto homine vel isto homine et sic de aliis”. Consequentia tenet, quia 
ly “homine” videtur stare confuse tantum propter duo syncategoremata 
distributiva cadentia super ipsum et sic valet descensus disiunctim. Sed 
consequens est falsum, quia sequitur “Sortes differt ab isto homine vel isto 
homine, igitur Sortes non est iste homo vel iste homo”. Consequentia tenet 
ab exposita ad unam exponentium, sed consequens est falsum, quia eius 
contradictorium est verum, scilicet “Sortes est iste homo vel iste homo”.
Quinto sic: Sequitur bene “Sortes differt ab omni homine, igitur Sortes 
ab aliquo homine differt”. Consequentia tenet per regulam “Nomina et 
verba transposita” et hic servantur proprietates logicales, sed consequens 
est falsum, quia Sortes a nullo homine differt. Probatur, quia Sortes non 

 
«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE» 
297
differt ab [aliquo] <alio> quam a ligno, igitur Sortes a nullo homine differt. 
Consequentia tenet, quia ex opposito consequentis sequitur oppositum 
antecedentis, quia [sequeretur] <sequitur> “Sortes ab aliquo homine 
differt, igitur Sortes differt ab alio quam a ligno”, quia quilibet homo est 
aliud quam lignum. Sed antecedens probatur, scilicet “Sortes non differt 
ab alio quam a ligno”, quia detur oppositum eius, scilicet “Sortes differt ab 
alio quam <a> ligno”, modo ista est falsa, ut patet per eius exponentes sic 
“Sortes est et aliud quam lignum est et Sortes non est aliud quam lignum”, 
quae est falsa, igitur et prima.
Sexto sic: Respondens est asinus, igitur sophisma falsum. Antecedens 
probatur: Omnis homo vel asinus est asinus, respondens est homo vel 
asinus, igitur respondens est asinus. Maior est vera, similiter minor pro una 
parte disiuncti. Conﬁ rmatur ultimo <!>: Omne animal, si est rudibile, est 
asinus, respondens est animal, si est rudibilis, igitur respondens est asinus. 
Consequentia in Darii.
Ad primum respondetur /295va/ negando istam consequentiam 
“Sortes differt ab omni homine, igitur Sortes differt ab isto homine et 
Sortes differt ab isto homine”. Et non est locus a toto in quantitate, quia in 
ista “Sortes differt ab omni homine” ly “homine” non distribuitur, modo 
totum in quantitate est terminus communis distributus.
Ad secundum dicendum, quod si debeat consequentia valere, tunc 
debe<a>t sic argui “Ab eo, quod nihil est, nihil differt, sed nihil est omnis 
homo, igitur nihil differt ab eo, quod est omnis homo”. Modo hoc totum 
est verum.
Ad tertium dicitur, quod ista regula “Nomina et verba transposita” 
intelligitur, si serventur proprietates logicales, scilicet quod maneant 
eadem suppositio, restrictio et sic de aliis. Modo hic variatur suppositio, 
quia in sophismate ly “homine” stat determinate, ut est dictum, et in ista 
“Sortes ab omni homine differt” ly “homine” stat distributive.
Ad quartum dicitur, quod sub ly “homine” non debet descendi 
disiunctim, quia non supponit confuse tantum, sed determinate. Sed in 
ista “Omnis homo differt ab omni homine”, ibi ly “homine” stat confuse 
tantum.
Ad quintum dicitur negando consequentiam istam “Sortes non differt 
ab alio quam a ligno, igitur a nullo homine differt”. Et si dicitur “ex opposito 
consequentis” etc., respondetur, quod non [sequeretur] <sequitur>, quia 
arguitur a non distributo ad distributum, quia ly “aliud quam lignum” in 
antecedente non distribuitur et tamen distribuitur in consequente, igitur etc.

298 
HARALD BERGER
Ad ultimum dicitur et <similiter ad> conﬁ rmationem distinguendo 
maiorem: Vel est una hypothetica, et sic argumentum non est in Darii, 
quia maior non est universalis. Vel est una categorica, tunc plus est 
praedicatum minoris quam sit subiectum distributum maioris et ergo non 
valet consequentia etc.
/318vb/ … Sortes differt ab omni homine.
Pro istius sophismatis declaratione notandum est primo, quod 
propositiones de ly “differt” sunt duplices, quaedam enim sunt afﬁ rmativae, 
in [qua] <quibus> nulla ponitur negatio expresse, aliae vero sunt negativae, 
in quibus ponitur una negatio ante ly “differt”. Exemplum primi, ut “Homo 
differt ab asino”, exemplum secundi “Homo non differt ab animali”.
Consequenter considerandum est, quod tam afﬁ rmativae quam 
negativae propositiones de ly “differt” sunt in multiplici differentia, 
quaedam enim sunt de copula praesenti, quaedam de copula praeterita, 
quaedam de copula futura.
Notandum consequenter, quod de expositione propositionis afﬁ rmativae 
/319ra/ de ly “differt” de copula praesenti duplex est opinio: Nam una dicit, 
quod quaelibet talis exponenda est per unam copulativam bimembrem, in 
cuius prima parte est positio subiecti, id est prima exponens debet esse 
una propositio, in qua afﬁ rmatur hoc verbum “est” secundum adiacens de 
principali subiecto, in secunda vero parte debet esse remotio praedicati 
principalis a subiecto principali, id est secunda exponens debet esse una 
propositio, in qua principale praedicatum negetur de principali subiecto. 
Verbi gratia “Homo differt ab asino” isto modo sic exponitur “Homo est 
et homo non est asinus, igitur homo differt ab asino”. Et secundum istum 
modum exponendi ista esset vera “Homo differt a chimaera”.
Est tamen alia opinio verior et communior opinione iam dicta dicens, 
quod propositio afﬁ rmativa de “differt” de copula praesenti debet exponi 
per copulativam trimembrem, cuius prima pars est positio subiecti et 
secunda pars positio praedicati et tertia pars debet esse una propositio, 
in qua removetur principale praedicatum a principali subiecto. Verbi 
gratia, secundum istum modum exponendi “Homo differt ab asino” sic 
exponitur “Homo est et asinus est et homo non est asinus, igitur homo 
differt ab asino”. Et secundum istam opinionem ista falsa est “Homo 
differt a chimaera”, ex quo secunda pars exponentis falsa esset. Quod ista 
opinio sit verior opinione prima, patet satis ex verbis Philosophi decimo 
Metaphysicae, ubi dicit, quod inter ens et non ens non est differentia 

 
«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE» 
299
neque identitas. Secundum istius expositionis exigentiam potest negativa 
exponi per disiunctivam trimembrem, cuius quaelibet pars contradicit 
parti correspondenti [parti] copulativae. Sed istud solum veritatem habet, 
si huiusmodi propositiones afﬁ rmativae et negativae sint singulares vel 
de subiecto communi distributo, quia si essent de subiecto communi non 
distributo sed particularisato, tunc potius partes disiunctivae deberent 
esse subcontrariae ad partes copulativae, sicud satis claruit ex secunda 
parte Consequentiarum capitulo de “differt”. Non tamen hoc stante, quod 
haec expositio sit bona quantum ad propositiones de praesenti, ipsa tamen 
non valet in propositionibus de futuro seu de praeterito, quia in possibili 
casu staret exponentes esse veras exposita existente falsa. Exempli gratia, 
ponatur casus, quod Sortes cras praecise habeat esse et quod Plato post 
cras praecise habeat esse, sic quod in nullo tempore Sortes et Plato simul 
sint. In isto casu verum erit dicere «Sortes erit et Plato erit et Sortes 
non erit Plato”, ut notum est cuilibet debite inspicienti casum. Et sic 
exponentes essent verae et tamen exposita esset falsa, scilicet “Sortes 
differet a Platone”, cuius causa est [hoc] <haec>, quia ad hoc, quod 
aliqua propositio de futuro sit vera, requiritur, quod aliquando [habet vel 
habuit vel] habebit unam sibi correspondentem veram. Sed sic non est de 
illa propositione, scilicet “Sortes differet a Platone”, ex quo alietas seu 
differentia non cadit nisi inter entia simul existentia, sed iam istae duae 
res, scilicet Sortes et Plato, numquam erunt entia simul existentia, igitur 
Sortes non differet a Platone.
Propter istud communes expositores circa expositionem propositionis 
de praeterito vel de futuro dicunt, quod in expositione talium propositionum 
addendus est aliquis terminus, qui debet importare identitatem temporis, 
pro quo prima pars veriﬁ catur. Verbi gratia illa propositio “Sortes differet 
a Platone” sic debet exponi “Sortes erit et Plato tunc erit et Sortes tunc non 
erit Plato, igitur Sortes differ<e>t a Platone”. Modo illa secunda exponens 
est ita falsa secundum casum positum sicud exposita.
Consequenter notandum est, quod sicud saepe antedictum est, tunc 
duo signa distributiva super unum terminum cadentia non derelinquunt 
ibi suppositionem distributivam, sed suppositionem determinatam vel 
confusam tantum.
Istis sic notatis inferuntur aliqua correlaria, primum: Arguendo a 
propositione [ab] <de> hoc verbo “differt” afﬁ rmative ad quamlibet 
suarum exponentium est bona consequentia et formalis. Sed si propositio 
de “differt” fuerit negativa, consequentia non valet. Patet correlarium, quia 

300 
HARALD BERGER
propositio de “differt” afﬁ rmativa exponitur per unam copulativam, ut 
dictum est, sed a tota copulativa ad quamlibet eius partem /319rb/ est bona 
consequentia. Sed propositio de “differt” negativa exponitur per unam 
disiunctivam, sed arguere a tota disiunctiva ad quamlibet eius seu aliquam 
partem non valet, igitur correlarium verum.
Secundum correlarium, quod si una exponentium propositionis 
negativae de “differt” fuerit vera, tunc illa propositio de “differt” est vera, 
sed hoc non sufﬁ cit ad propositionem afﬁ rmativam de “differt”. Patet 
correlarium, quia propositio negativa de “differt” exponitur per unam 
disiunctivam, modo ad veritatem disiunctivae sufﬁ cit alteram eius partem 
esse veram. Sed secunda pars correlarii patet, quia propositio afﬁ rmativa 
de “differt” exponitur per copulativam, modo ad veritatem copulativae non 
sufﬁ cit veritas unius partis.
Correlarie sequitur tertio et responsatur ad sophisma, quod sophisma, 
prout proponitur, est verum. Patet per eius exponentes, quia debet sic 
exponi “Sortes est et omnis homo est et Sortes non est omnis homo, igitur 
Sortes differt ab omni homine”. Modo quaelibet pars [exponentium] 
<exponentis> est vera, igitur sophisma verum.
[Item] <Contra> arguitur: Ab illo, quod [non] <nihil> est, [non] <nihil> 
differt, sed nihil est omnis homo, igitur nihil differt ab omni homine et 
per consequens Sortes non differt ab omni homine. Ambae consequentiae 
notae sunt et similiter minor patet ex terminis, sed maior patet per dictum 
Philosophi decimo Metaphysicae dicentis, quod inter non ens et ens non 
cadit differentia. Unde dicit ibidem “Neque non ens enti neque non ens non 
enti est idem vel diversum”.
Respondetur negando consequentiam, quia si deberet valere, deberet 
sic inferri “Ab illo, quod nihil est, nihil differt, sed nihil est omnis homo, 
igitur nihil differt ab eo, quod est omnis homo” et non sic deberet inferri 
“igitur nihil differt ab omni homine”. Et sic etiam concedo, quod Sortes 
non differt ab eo, quod est omnis homo, cum nihil sit, quod sit omnis homo. 
Sed tamen illam aeque bene concedo, quod Sortes differt ab omni homine.
Item arguitur: Si sophisma esset verum, tunc bene sequeretur “Sortes 
differt ab omni homine, igitur ab omni homine Sortes differt”. Tenet 
consequentia per dictum Philosophi secundo Perihermeneias “Nomina et 
verba transposita idem signiﬁ cant”. Sed consequens est falsum, igitur <et> 
illud, ex quo sequitur falsitas consequentis. Patet, quia si Sortes ab omni 
homine differt et cum Sortes met sit homo, tunc Sortes a se ipso differet, 
quod est absurdum dicere.

 
«SORTES DIFFERT AB OMNI HOMINE» 
301
Respondetur negando consequentiam. Ad dictum Philosophi <dico>, 
quod non est universaliter verum, sed debet sic moderari, quod nomina et 
verba transposita idem signiﬁ cant, dummodo ibi non ﬁ t variatio suppositionis, 
ampliationis etc. Modo hic ﬁ t variatio penes suppositionem, quia in 
antecedente ly “homine” stat determinate et in consequente distributive.
Item arguitur: Si sophisma esset verum, sequeretur, quod bene 
sequeretur “Sortes differt ab omni homine, igitur Sortes differt ab aliquo 
homine”. Consequens falsum, ut patet per eius exponentes, igitur <et> 
illud, ex quo sequitur. Probatur tamen consequentia, quia bene sequitur 
in simili “Sortes videt omnem hominem, igitur Sortes videt aliquem 
hominem”. Etiam ex aliquo alio probatur consequentia, quia ibi arguitur 
a toto in quantitate ad suam partem, eo quod “omnis homo” est totum in 
quantitate in ordine ad ly “aliquis homo”.
[Ibi?! 
dicitur] 
<Respondetur> 
negando 
consequentiam. 
Ad 
similitudinem dico, quod non est simile de propositionibus datis, quia 
in ista “Sortes videt omnem hominem” ly “hominem” supponit confuse 
distributive, sed ita non est in illa “Sortes differt ab omni homine”. Ad 
conﬁ rmationem dicitur, quod ibi non arguitur a toto in quantitate ad suam 
partem, ex quo ly “homine” in antecedente non distribuitur, sed potius stat 
determinate.
Item arguitur: Descendentes sophismatis sunt falsae, ergo etc. 
Assumptum patet, quia ly “homine” in sophismate supponit confuse 
tantum, ex quo super ipsum cadunt duo signa distributiva et per consequens 
sub eo debet descendi disiunctim sic “igitur Sortes differt ab isto homine 
vel ab isto homine”. Modo descendentes illae falsae sunt, quia Sortes est 
iste homo vel iste homo etc., igitur Sortes non differt ab isto homine <vel 
ab isto homine> etc.
Respondetur uno modo, quod ly “homine” in sophismate supponit 
confuse tantum, ut dicit magister Thomas [Maulvelvelt!? Mauwelvelt?] 
<Maulvelt> in suis Suppositionibus. Sed illo stante /319va/ non debet 
descendi sub ly “homine”, sicud dictum est, quia alias contingeret arguere 
a non distributo ad distributum, quare <?> consequentia non valet. Sed 
debet sic descendi tunc sub ly “homine” “igitur Sortes ab isto homine vel 
ab isto homine et sic de aliis differt”37.
37 This is not a faithful report of Maulfelt’s view! Thomas rejects descensus 
disiunctim, but accepts descensus copulatim. But the point made here is rather that the 
disjunct extreme is outside the scope of «differt».

302 
HARALD BERGER
Aliter respondetur secundum aliam opinionem, scilicet Biridani, 
Mercilii et aliorum modernorum logicorum, quod ly “homine” in 
sophismate non supponit confuse tantum, sed determinate. Consequenter 
dicunt, quod non semper causatur suppositio confusa tantum, quando duo 
signa distributiva cadunt super unum terminum, sed quando duo signa 
distributiva cadunt [super unum terminum] distributive circa terminum 
distributum. Sed sic non est in proposito. Et quae sit causa huius, [dicta] 
<dictum> est in Suppositionibus.
Item arguitur: Si sophisma esset verum, maxime ex eo, quod ly 
“homine” supponeret determinate, sed hoc consequens est falsum. Falsitas 
probatur, quia si sic, maxime <ex eo>, quod duo signa distributiva mutuo 
se impedientia caderent super ipsum, sed hoc non. Patet, quia si sic, 
maxime <ex eo>, quod ly “differt ab” haberet vim distribuendi, sed hoc 
non. Patet, quia si sic, maxime <ex eo>, quod in ly “differt ab” includeretur 
negatio, sed hoc non. Patet, quia vel illa negatio in eo inclusa esset negatio 
inﬁ nitans aut negatio negans. Nullum istorum potest dici: Non inﬁ nitans, 
quia ibi nullum ponitur iniﬁ nitatum, nec etiam negans, quia si sic, tunc 
caderet super copulam propositionis et per consequens sophisma esset 
propositio negativa, quod est contra conclusionem praedictam modernorum 
logicorum.
Hic dicunt quidam, quod in ly “differt ab” includitur negatio neganter 
tenta cadens super copulam propositionis, sed istud non videtur posse 
[subcistere!] <subsistere> propter causam tactam in argumento.
Dicunt igitur alii moderni aliter sic, quod in ly “differt ab” includitur 
negatio negans, non tamen cadens super copulam propositionis. Et hoc 
posset probari ratione tali, quia ut [eri] <heri> dicebatur, tunc propositio 
afﬁ rmativa de “differt ab” exponitur per copulativam trimembrem, cuius 
primae duae exponentes sunt afﬁ rmativae et ultima negativa. Modo

SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE. ELEMENTS 
OF A CONTEMPORARY THEORY OF SUPPOSITION
Introduction
In recent years, a number of important studies in medieval philosophy 
have convincingly shown that those we would call pragmatic considerations 
according to today’s trends in philosophy of language and linguistics, were 
also at the core of the concerns in medieval logic and semantics. The works 
of Irène Rosier-Catach1, only to mention one remarkable example, have 
shown that medieval theories of language, far from being limited to strictly 
syntactic or semantic analyses, crucially involved elements of what we 
would call speech act theory as well as a notion of meaning which resorted 
to the identiﬁ cation of the intentions lying behind a speaker’s utterance.
This latter analogy has encouraged a natural comparison with Grice’s 
theory of meaning and communication2 and also with post-Gricean 
«radical» pragmatic or contextualist approaches to utterance meaning3. 
Frédéric Goubier and Nausicaa Pouscoulous4 have recently shown how 
the medieval debate concerning the notion of virtus sermonis, especially 
as approached in a well-known statute published in 1340 by the Faculty

of Arts of the University of Paris, closely resembles the contemporary 
debate around the so-called semantics/pragmatics distinction. As «a clear 
denunciation of a certain logical approach to language», the statute –the 
authors argue– comes very close to Grice’s approach for not relying solely 
on the conventional meaning of words and sentences, but resorting by 
contrast to the intentions behind an author’s using of a certain expression 
in a given context, when trying for example to interpret a sentence which, 
taken in its literal meaning (that is, de virtute sermonis), would have 
been clearly false, but with which the author was clearly trying to convey 
something true.
Not only: Goubier and Pouscoulous argue that some of the precepts 
contained in the Parisian statute go even beyond Grice’s own (quite 
conservative) concept of semantics and can be better understood in analogy 
to much more radically pragmatic theories of meaning, like the inﬂ uential 
contextualist approach advocated by François Recanati5.
Following the directions of such researches, I wondered whether an 
analysis in terms of post-Gricean pragmatics could help to shed light on one 
of the central and much discussed ﬁ elds in medieval logic and semantics, 
i.e. medieval theories of supposition. 
In the same spirit of the cited works, in the present paper I will argue 
in favour of the analogy between Ockham’s supposition theory and one 
very speciﬁ c and peculiar approach in post-Gricean Pragmatics, that of so-
called Default Semantics6 (DS). 
The purpose of this work will be very limited. I will restrict myself to a 
little portion of Ockham’s theory of supposition, i.e. his theory of supposition 
proper, and will leave aside the much more complex theory of the modes 
of personal supposition. Also, I will pursue my analogy only with respect 
to the treatment that DS proposes with respect to one important distinction 
in contemporary theories of reference, i.e. Donnellan’s distinction between 
referential and attributive uses of deﬁ nite descriptions7. 
My aim is to show that the general strategy advocated in DS to cope 
with this kind of semantic issue comes very close to Ockham’s strategy

to distinguish the readings of a proposition by the possible modes of 
supposition of its terms. My hope is that such an analogy could eventually 
be illuminating with respect to the general question of what medieval 
theories of supposition were aimed at.
To begin with, I must show my hand and make it explicit that, when 
talking of Ockham’s supposition theory, I indeed refer and endorse one 
pretty speciﬁ c and by no means uncontroversial interpretation of such 
doctrine, which is the one advocated in several papers and in her book 
on the formalization of medieval logic by Catherina Dutilh Novaes8. I 
will then start my argument with a brief exposition of Dutilh Novaes’ 
interpretation. Such exposition is intended to focus only on some main 
points which are worth emphasizing for the development of my proposed 
comparison.
Before putting to focus this interpretation of supposition theory, I 
want to stress a rather unessential, but likely illuminating point of contact 
between medieval theories of supposition and Gricean pragmatics. Such 
point is historical and has to do with the genesis of both these doctrines. 
According to Dutilh Novaes:
There is abundant textual evidence to the effect that supposition 
theories were developed in close proximity to the doctrine of 
fallacies; this suggests that supposition theories are particularly 
suitable for dealing with semantic ambiguities and ﬂ uctuations of 
meaning –in sum, with problematic cases. But this seems to be all 
too often forgotten9.

Now, it is also often forgotten that one of Grice’s original motivations 
for the development of his theory of conversational implicatures was to show 
that some non sequitur in philosophical enquiries are due to an illegitimate 
application of common strategies among Oxford ordinary language 
philosophers. In his 1961 paper «The causal theory of perception»10, Grice 
shows that one common objection against his variant of such theory is 
indeed fallacious, insofar as it focuses on the oddity and inappropriateness 
of certain statements of perception like: 
(1) That looks red to me. 
Which Grice himself regards as appropriate translations of ordinary 
statements involving undue references to sense-data. According to Grice, 
such objection is misguided, as it confuses pragmatic aspects of the 
meaning of such sentences with strictly semantic ones11. A statement like 
(1) may well be odd, but from this fact it by no means follows that the 
statement is false or senseless.
I continue to believe that a more or less detailed study of the way we 
talk, in this or that region of discourse, is an indispensable foundation 
for much of the most fundamental kind of philosophizing12. 
In a sense, then, it can be claimed that both supposition theory and 
Gricean pragmatics find their birth in an attempt to avoid fallacious 
arguments in philosophical investigations. As I have noticed, 
however, this point is largely tangential to my main argument and I 
have mentioned it only as an opening to the idea that, insofar as both 
theories originate from analogous concerns, a comparison between 
supposition theories and contemporary pragmatic theories can reveal 
to be in fact fruitful.

1. Ockham’s Supposition Theory in the interpretation of Dutilh Novaes
The relation of supposition is one which holds between terms and the 
things they stand for. In a sense it is close to the contemporary notion 
of reference. However, such assimilation has been strongly contested by 
Dutilh Novaes13. As a preliminary remark, however, I think it is worth 
noticing that also another relation in traditional medieval semantics, that 
of signiﬁ cation14, is one which takes into account the same relata15. What 
differentiates the two relations is the fact that while the latter relation, 
relative to a proposition, is an a priori and context-invariant meaning-
conferring relation between words and things, the former is rather a 
matter of how subject and predicate terms are used in speciﬁ c contexts of 
utterance:
Yet it is one matter to assign certain terms to certain things, so that a 
language may be set up in the ﬁ rst place; this is the contribution of 
signiﬁ cation. It is quite another matter to actually use that language 
to talk about things; this is explained by supposition16. 
Such consideration shows that, even though one agrees that supposition 
theories are best analysed as logico-semantic doctrines of the contribution 
of subject and predicate terms to the overall meaning of propositions, 
nonetheless the analyses provided by such doctrines should be seen as 
inscribed in a more general understanding of semantics as providing a 
theory of utterance meaning (i.e. a theory aimed at delivering the truth-
conditions of the intended proposition expressed by a sentence as used in 
a speciﬁ c context), rather than as an analysis of sentence meaning alone17. 
The notion of a logico-semantic analysis of utterance meaning can 
seem a bit weird at ﬁ rst glance, but I will show that it is perfectly manageable 
13 Especially in her book Formalizing. 
14 Cf. DUTILH NOVAES, Formalizing, pp. 18-20.
15 At least when the term is used referentially and to suppose for what it signiﬁ es, 
i.e., according to Ockham, when it is taken in personal supposition.

LUCA SBORDONE
also in the light of the assumption of some contemporary approaches to the 
semantics/pragmatics interface. 
I have already mentioned that, according to Dutilh Novaes, Ockham’s 
doctrine of supposition is not to be equated with a modern theory of 
reference. This is because theories of reference usually are intended to 
develop semantic methods to uniquely pick up referents for referential 
terms or descriptions. In Dutilh Novaes’ interpretation, supposition theories, 
by contrast, are best seen as tools for determining the range of possible 
readings which a proposition can have, with respect to the interaction 
between the possible supposita of its subject and predicate terms18. In this 
respect, rather than a theory of reference, Ockham’s supposition theory is 
best seen as theory of propositional meaning, or –as Dutilh Novaes puts 
it– a «program of propositional hermeneutics»19.
One point which is particularly stressed by Dutilh Novaes, is that 
such hermeneutics is not to be intended as relying on the intuitions of the 
interpreter, but as a matter of syntactic and semantic rules which can be 
applied and combined to obtain the possible readings of a proposition. 
Such rules are entirely mechanic and deterministic, and give rise by means 
of computation to the possible interpretations for ambiguous propositions. 
This is why she also refers to Ockham’s theory of supposition as a kind of 
algorithmic hermeneutics20. 
The point is worth stressing, since if on the one hand we are faced with 
a theory of utterance meaning (which, as such, relies on both semantic and 
pragmatic ingredients of meaning), on the other hand there is the claim that 
Ockham’s supposition theory is neutral with respect to the actual process of 
identiﬁ cation of the speaker’s intended referent of a certain expression, a 
process which –especially in cases of ambiguity– is at least partially guided by 
pragmatic factors21. What is claimed is only that the supposition machinery, 
once fed with the input of a sentence, splits out its possible readings, 
according to Ockham’s assumption that «propositio est distinguenda»22. 
In this sense, supposition theory are not really comparable to 
contemporary theories of reference, which are typically aimed at providing

SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE 
309
rules for discriminating once and for all the actual referent (suppositum) of 
a given term (and accordingly, the truth-conditions of a given proposition). 
By contrast, «theories of supposition seem to embrace semantic ambiguities 
as their very reason to exist»23. The only job performed by the supposition 
machinery is then that of generating legitimate semantic representations 
of a proposition (including blatantly false readings, since the truth-value 
is not what is at stake at this stage of semantic analysis), and of excluding 
illegitimate readings, by means only of a very limited set of syntactic and 
semantic rules. To borrow a terminology from contemporary semantics, 
we could say that supposition theory is intended to make explicit the 
«semantic potential»24 of a given proposition. 
A further point which is worth stressing is the following: although in 
Ockham’s supposition theory we are faced with a kind of propositional 
ambiguity, Dutilh Novaes points out very clearly that such ambiguity is 
neither lexical nor, strictly speaking, semantic, but rather «it is best described 
as contextual ambiguity»25, i.e. as a kind of pragmatic ambiguity. That is to 
say: one should not postulate two (or more) different meanings for a term 
allowing for multiple supposita, as if there were actually two different lexical 
entries corresponding to the same word. By contrast, the range of possible 
supposita is determined only with respect to different propositional contexts, 
while the picking up of the speaker’s intended suppositum is entirely a matter 
of his/her intentions and is out of the object of supposition theory.
Turning to the theory of supposition proper, it is well known that 
Ockham distinguishes between personal, simple and material supposition. 
A term is said to have personal supposition when it supposits for one 
of its signiﬁ cata, and with the additional clause that it is also «taken 
signiﬁ catively»26. This means that the term picks up its referent as what it 
directly signiﬁ es and not, so to speak, accidentally. 
If a term such as «noun» supposits for the term «noun» insofar 
as «noun» is a noun, then the term is taken signiﬁ catively. But if

LUCA SBORDONE
«noun» supposits for «noun» because they are equiform strings, 
then it is not taken signiﬁ catively. In both cases it supposits for 
one of its signiﬁ cata, but in the former case it does so incidentally, 
because the string «noun» happens to be one of the signiﬁ cata of 
itself (since «noun» is a noun)27. 
One crucial aspect of this deﬁ nition is that the notion of a term «taken 
signiﬁ catively» is «essentially a pragmatic notion, related to the attitude of 
the interpreter/speaker vis-à-vis the term; it is after all the interpreter who 
takes or does not take the term signiﬁ catively»28.
Nonetheless, the supposition machinery does not determine whether 
a term is taken signiﬁ catively or not, which is an entirely unpredictable 
pragmatic feature of the utterance interpretation, but it only gives exact 
semantic rules to determine, for example, what it is for a term in a 
proposition to suppose personally. The same holds for simple and material 
supposition, where respectively a term supposits for a term of second 
intention (an occurrence of a concept) or for a term of second imposition 
(an occurrence of a name). One propositional context does not necessarily 
force a kind of supposition, but it simply makes it possible to determine the 
various supposita of the terms in accordance with their nature (as terms of 
ﬁ rst imposition and intention, second imposition, or second intention). The 
possible readings of a proposition are then simply got in a combinatorial 
way: 
[…] given the three kinds of terms (ﬁ rst imposition and intention, 
second imposition, second intention) and the two terms of a typical 
categorical proposition, there are nine possible propositional 
contexts. In each of these contexts, the rules allow for the 
(mechanical) determination of the possible kinds of supposition for 
their terms29. 
However, from the point of view of the interpretation, the kinds of 
supposition are not regarded as on equal footing. Given that a term having 
personal supposition signiﬁ es its suppositum directly and not per accident, 
Ockham states that personal supposition is indeed prominent and always

SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE 
311
possible. Personal supposition is then the most salient supposition, and for 
this reason it is the default supposition: 
A term has personal supposition when it stands in a sentence for 
what it signiﬁ es. Personal supposition is in many ways the default 
supposition for Ockham…30 
And more explicitly: 
The primacy given to personal supposition can be explained by the 
fact that personal supposition is the signiﬁ cative supposition, the 
kind of supposition in which the term plays its «default» role of 
directing one’s attention to the things it signiﬁ es31. 
Finally, the main points useful to the development of my own proposal 
can be summed up as follows:
Ockham’s Supposition Theory (OST) in Dutilh Novaes’ 
interpretation: 
1.  is a logico-semantic theory of propositional (utterance) meaning; 
2.  is not aimed at determining the supposita for a given term in a 
proposition, but rather at distinguishing the range of its possible 
supposita and, accordingly, at generating the possible readings of 
ambiguous propositions;
3.  is formal, insofar as the rules for the modes of supposition proper 
are entirely semantic (they only depend on the ontological kind 
of an object for which a term supposits) and such rules are in 
principle formally speciﬁ able. Moreover, OST is mechanic insofar 
the possible readings are generated algorithmically by means of 
combinatorial application of such rules.
4.  is intentional insofar as the determination of different kinds of 
suppositions ultimately relies on the recognition of speaker’s 
intended referent for a given term.

5.  has a notion of default or preferred interpretation which is anchored 
to personal supposition. Such default status of personal supposition 
derives from pragmatic considerations. However, semantically 
such pragmatic factor constrains the range of possible readings by 
always allowing the reading based on personal supposition. 
2. Referential ambiguity in contemporary semantics
Let us leave aside for a moment all medieval things, and turn to 
contemporary semantic issues. Contemporary theory of meaning and 
of reference are faced with similar, although of course not overlapping, 
problems of ambiguity of referential expressions. What I have in mind is a 
distinction (explicitly) introduced in 1966 by Keith Donnellan32. The main 
point made by Donnellan against Russell’s and Strawson’s treatments of 
deﬁ nite descriptions is the following.
There are two ways in which a deﬁ nite description (i.e. a singular 
denoting expression of the form «The F») can be used: 1) referentially or 
2) attributively. 
To clarify, let’s think of an example. Imagine a situation in which A 
and B are in the Sistine Chapel in Rome. In such situation, A utters (2):
(2) The painter of this room was a genius. 
According to Donnellan, a proposition like (2), involving the deﬁ nite 
description «the painter of this room» can be interpreted in two ways:
(2.1) The painter of this room, whoever he/she is, was a genius;
(2.2) Michelangelo was a genius.
In the former case, we have an occurrence of what Donnellan refers to 
as the attributive use of a deﬁ nite description, while in the latter we have 
a referential use. 
The difference between the two readings is easy to spell out: while 
in the attributive use the description is intended to refer to whoever is 
32 DONNELLAN, «Reference and deﬁ nite descriptions».

 
SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE 
313
the painter of the Sistine Chapel and says of him/her that he/she was a 
genius, in the referential use A has in mind and picks up a speciﬁ c referent, 
Michelangelo, and intentionally refers to him.
In the [attributive] case the deﬁ nite description might be said to occur 
essentially for the speaker wishes to assert something about whatever 
or whoever ﬁ ts that description; but in the referential use the deﬁ nite 
description is merely one tool for doing a certain job-calling attention 
to a person or thing-and in general any other device for doing the 
same job, another description or a name, would do as well33. 
According to Donnellan, Russell’s account of deﬁ nite description 
holds for the attributive case, but not for the referential one, while 
Strawson’s view, even though it acknowledges the existence of referential 
uses of deﬁ nite descriptions, however «goes too far in this direction»34 and 
is unable to cope with the equally legitimate attributive reading of deﬁ nite 
descriptions. 
Donnellan points out that whether a description is used attributively 
or referentially is not something which can be determined before such 
description has been used. By contrast, both Strawson and Russell seem 
«to make a common assumption here about the question of how deﬁ nite 
descriptions function: that we can ask how a deﬁ nite description functions 
in some sentence independently of a particular occasion upon which it is 
used»35, while «[i]n general, whether or not a deﬁ nite description is used 
referentially or attributively is a function of the speaker’s intentions in a 
particular case»36.
To clarify the theoretical importance of distinguishing between the 
two uses, Donnellan asks us to focus on some speciﬁ c cases, like the ones 
involving misdescription. One of Donnellan’s notorious examples is the 
one of the man drinking Martini:
Suppose one is at a party and, seeing an interesting-looking person 
holding a martini glass, one asks, «Who is the man drinking a 
martini?» If it should turn out that there is only water in the glass,

36  Ibid., p. 297.

LUCA SBORDONE
one has nevertheless asked a question about a particular person, a 
question that it is possible for someone to answer. Contrast this with 
the use of the same question by the chairman of the local Teetotalers 
Union. He has just been informed that a man is drinking a martini 
at their annual party. He responds by asking his informant, «Who is 
the man drinking a martini?» In asking the question the chairman 
does not have some particular person in mind about whom he asks 
the question; if no one is drinking a martini, if the information is 
wrong, no person can be singled out as the person about whom the 
question was asked37. 
In a situation in which a speaker asks the question about the man 
holding a Martini glass in his hands, and even though the hearer is aware 
of the fact that the man is indeed not drinking Martini, but only water, 
the speaker can nevertheless succeed in (though mistakenly) referring to 
that person. The same of course does not work if the description is used 
attributively, since in this case the condition of someone being the (unique) 
man drinking Martini in the room is a precondition for the referential 
expression to be satisﬁ ed and accordingly for the utterance to be felicitous.
If we come back to our previous example, it turns out that there is 
then a third possible reading, namely one in which the speaker mistakenly 
thinks of the Sistine Chapel that it has been painted by, say, Raffaello. In 
such situation he utters (2), with the intention to say (2.3):
(2.3) Raffaello was a genius.
In such a situation, assuming that the hearer has enough knowledge 
to disambiguate A’s referential intention (e.g. assuming that B knows that 
A thinks of Raffaello that he is the painter of the Sistine Chapel), B can 
successfully interpret (2) as (2.3). 
The case of misdescription is then illuminating as it points out that 
while for attributive uses of deﬁ nite descriptions the proposition involving 
such description would be obviously false or at least not truth-evaluable 
(as in the case where there is no man drinking martini in the room), the 
same does not hold when the description is used referentially. We can 
successfully pick up the referent of a description even if the description is 
empty (no one ﬁ ts the description) or if it is mistaken (someone else ﬁ ts 
the description).

A huge literature has arisen concerning Donnellan’s distinction. I will 
drop the details of this debate, due to space limitations. What I want to 
stress is only the fact that in my view such kind of ambiguity of referential 
expressions, mutatis mutandis, resembles very closely the kind of questions 
at stake in medieval theories of supposition. 
But, which kind of ambiguity is the one between referential and 
attributive uses of description? Well, Donnellan is quite cautious about 
this. He explicitly denies that it can be the case of a lexical ambiguity (as 
if there were two different meanings of the word «the»), and seems also 
not to be willing to talk of semantic ambiguity. Rather, he hints to the 
possibility that it could be a kind of pragmatic ambiguity, but does not 
develop such option38.
Kripke39, by contrast, argues that Donnellan’s argument does not 
reject Russell’s analysis. The main point against Donnellan’s view is 
methodological. First, Kripke rejects Donnellan’s claim that his analysis 
does not lead to the postulation of semantic ambiguity, as inconsistent with 
Donnellan’s general line of arguing. Then, he proposes to follow Grice’s 
Modiﬁ ed Ockham Razor which states that «senses are not to be multiplied 
beyond necessity»40.
In this spirit, he proposes a Gricean analysis of the referential/
attributive distinction. According to Kripke, the unitary (i.e. not ambiguity-
postulating) Russellian analysis should be maintained and the entailed 
attributive reading be regarded as the «semantic reference» of deﬁ nite 
descriptions. The referential reading, on the other hand, can be regarded as 
a more complex «speaker’s referent», obtained from the semantic referent 
by means of general pragmatic (Gricean) principles of conversation. 
Kripke’s argument is however misguided, as it rests on the assumption 
that if two truth-conditionally distinct analyses of a given proposition 
can be provided, we are left with only two options: either one should 
postulate semantic ambiguity, or the more general meaning has to be 
regarded as the semantic meaning while the more speciﬁ c one has to be 
seen as obtained from the semantic meaning by means of conversational 
implicatures.

However, as it has been convincingly shown in the last thirty years, 
such Gricean dichotomy can hardly be maintained, as it rests on the dubious 
assumption exempliﬁ ed by Gazdar’s slogan that «pragmatics = meaning 
minus truth-conditions»41.
Another way to look at this kind of phenomena is following by contrast 
the so-called «semantic underdeterminacy» view. According to this view, 
advocated among others by scholars within the paradigm of Relevance 
Theory and truth-conditional pragmatics42, a rigid distinction between 
semantics and pragmatics cannot be advocated, as there is extensive 
evidence that pragmatic phenomena play a crucial role in the determination 
of the very propositional (i.e. semantic) content of given sentences. 
Consider the following examples:
(4) I’ve had breakfast.
(5) I’ve nothing to wear.
(6) The old king died and a republic was declared.
In the examples above, the semantic content of the sentences clearly 
underdetermines the propositional meaning, since pragmatic elements have 
to be integrated in the logical form for the complete, intended proposition to 
be expressed. So cases like (4) and (5) would express respectively an obvious 
truth and a blatant falsity, if the semantic representation is not expanded 
to allow the contextually relevant (temporal or quantiﬁ cational) restriction 
to enter into the determination of what is said43. Analogously, in the case 
of (6) the encoded meaning of the connective «and» underdetermines the 
intended proposition, which in most contexts clearly conveys a temporal 
and causal relation between the two events. 
The debate on semantic underdeterminacy is very broad and articulated, 
and a number of different paradigms have been proposed between the two 
41 G. GAZDAR, Pragmatics: Implicature, Presupposition and Logical Form, 
Academic Press, New York 1979, p. 2.
42 This tradition originates in the works of Ruth Kempson, Jay Atlas and Stephen 
Levinson.
43 It is worth noticing that «what is said» is a technical notion introduced by GRICE 
in his Studies and extensively discussed and criticized by, among others, RECANATI, 
Literal Meaning

 
SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE 
317
extremes of theorists claiming that pragmatic effects on truth-conditional 
content can in fact be semanticized44 and scholars who argue that there is 
no limit to such kind of pragmatic contribution to the semantic layer. The 
debate is still open. 
François Recanati, among others, (one of the advocates of the radical 
pragmatic view) has proposed that also sentences involving referential/
attributive ambiguity have to be regarded as semantically underdetermined 
rather than semantically ambiguous45. Such a move makes it possible to 
treat this distinction in a pragmatic way, without at the same time calling 
into account the very speciﬁ c phenomenon of conversational implicature. 
In such picture we have three basic levels of meaning: one level of sentence 
meaning (i.e. conventional meaning of the words and sentence structure), 
what is said (i.e. a technical notion for utterance literal meaning) and what 
is communicated. 
According to Recanati: 
When a sentence can be used to communicate two different things in two 
different contexts or classes of contexts, the difference can be treated 
in three different ways, corresponding to the three different levels of 
meaning. It may be treated as a superﬁ cial, pragmatic difference at 
the third level only. On this view, what is communicated, but neither 
what is said nor the linguistic meaning of the sentence, varies from 
one context to the other. The difference between the referential and 
the attributive uses of descriptions is such a superﬁ cial difference 
according to the Implicature Theory, whereas the Ambiguity Theory 
ascribes the difference between the two readings to the deepest level: 
it considers it as a difference between two senses of the sentence-type. 
[…] but there is also a third [possibility]: to ascribe the difference 
to the second level, by considering it as a difference between the 
propositions literally expressed, without rooting this difference in a 
genuine ambiguity at the ﬁ rst level46. 
44 E.g. in the framework of DRT (H. KAMP – U. REYLE, From Discourse to 
Logic, Kluwer, Dordrecht 1993) or in the so called indexicalist approaches (cf., e.g., 
J. STANLEY, Language in Context: Selected Essays, Oxford University Press, Oxford 
2007).

Studies, 56 (1989) 217-249.

318 
LUCA SBORDONE
According to such proposal, the referential/attributive distinction is 
to be grounded at the level of «what is said», which is the level at which 
unconscious pragmatic processes enter into the determination of the full 
propositional form. This view seems intuitively appealing, as it rejects both 
the rather unpleasant Ambiguity and the Implicature view. However, it is 
semantically not as much palatable, since at the same time it frustrates any 
attempt to predict and manipulate the semantic potential for propositions 
involving linguistically underdetermined referential expressions.
Moreover, from the point of view of the methodological opponents 
to Donnellan’s view (those who, like Kripke, argue that a methodological 
principle of parsimony has to be always privileged in semantic theories), 
there is also a further problem with such analysis: as it stands, the analysis 
avoids the multiplication of senses arising from the ambiguity view, insofar 
as it conforms to Grice’s Modiﬁ ed Ockham’s Razor. However, even though 
it does not multiply senses, such proliferation is simply shifted to the upper 
layer of the levels of meaning. Instead of one (semantic) or two (semantic 
and pragmatic) levels of meaning, in Recanati’s view we are left with three 
different levels, a picture which is hardly sustainable for a theory aiming 
to have psychological plausibility with respect to the actual process of 
utterance interpretation.
Kasia Jaszczolt has recently proposed a completely different 
approach to semantic underdetermination and to the referential/attributive 
distinction47. As the details of her paradigm of Default Semantics would 
lead us too far from the limits of the present paper, I will only present the 
theory very sketchily and then brieﬂ y turn to her analysis of the referential/
attributive distinction.
In DS there is no room for different levels of meaning. According to 
DS, the postulation of different layers follows from the bad assumption 
of a primacy of the syntactic representation or logical form over other 
sources of meaning48. By contrast, a unitary semantic representation can be 
reached once we acknowledge that different sources of meaning, including 
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information, have to be regarded as 
on equal footing and all contributing to the same single level semantic 
47 The theory has been presented in several papers and systematized in JASZCZOLT, 
Default Semantics. 
48 Ibid., pp. 19-25.

representation49. Such is called «merger representation» and is claimed to 
be a thought-like theoretical object, one which is not as ﬁ ne-grained as 
propositions or thoughts but which is perfectly suitable for singling out 
only those aspects of thoughts which are truth-conditionally relevant50. The 
principle of compositionality of meaning is then preserved, but moved so 
to speak one level higher, at the level of merger representations and, in the 
spirit of truth-conditional pragmatics, is regarded not as a simple semantic 
compositionality, but as a sort of very liberal semantico-pragmatic principle 
of compositionality51. 
Merger representations are formal structures based on the formalism 
of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). DS relies on three main 
principles: 
1.  Parsimony of Levels (PL): «Levels of senses are not to be 
multiplied beyond necessity»52.
2.  Primary Intention (PI): «The primary role of intention in 
communication is to secure the referent of the speaker’s 
utterance»53. 
3.  Degrees of Intentions (DI) - «Intentions allow for degrees»54.
DS takes intentionality of mental states as one of the possible sources 
of meaning of acts of communication, entering into composition and 
contributing to the merger representation. Intentionality in DS means 
something like referentiality55, in accordance with the PI principle. Also, it 
allows for degrees. This means that possible readings of a sentence involving 
referential expressions can be semantically generated and put on a scale of 
salience. The strongest intentionality is as well the default intentionality and 
it gives rise to so-called cognitive defaults, i.e. default which can be traced 
back to intentions of the underlying mental states according to PI.

320 
LUCA SBORDONE
DI, on the other hand, which is a result of the assumed basic 
«referentiality» of linguistic expressions, enters in the assignment of 
referents in cases of presupposition, anaphoric links, deﬁ nite descriptions, 
in accordance with PI.
Let’s consider our example (2). I noticed that we have three possible 
readings for such proposition:
 
(2.1) was a genius (a)  
a = Michelangelo
(2.2) was a genius (a’)  
a’= Raffaello
(2.3) ∃x (Painter of the Sistine Chapel (x) & ∀y(Painter of the Sistine 
Chapel (y) à y = x) & was a genius (x)).
According to DS, we should not postulate semantic underdeterminacy 
in cases like (2). Underdeterminacy has to be called into account only 
in situations in which it is cognitively relevant, that is «in the situations 
where the addressee reasons from genuinely underspeciﬁ ed or ambiguous 
premises»56. 
In other words, in addition to saying that underspeciﬁ ed 
semantic representation is not normally a cognitively real level 
of utterance processing, I am saying that even theoretically it 
need not be discerned very often57. 
By contrast, DS postulates that it is cognitively much more plausible 
to consider that only one interpretation will be selected, and that we can 
resort to the principles of PI and DI to generate the possible readings of 
such propositions, putting them on a scale of salience going from the 
default reading (the one involving the strongest intentionality), through 
the referential reading with dispersed intentionality (the mistaken use of 
description) towards the reading involving the weakest intentionality (the 
attributive reading). The merger representations for such three readings are 
as follows.

Like in the case of Discourse Representation Structures of DRT, in the 
ﬁ rst line we ﬁ nd variables for discourse markers, and in the following lines 
we have discourse conditions. These are given as formulas of classic ﬁ rst-
order predicate logic, and the subscripts refer to the sources of meaning 
for each single element (with CD = Cognitive Default, CP1 = Conscious 
Pragmatic Inference and WS = Word meaning and Sentence structure)
As it is clear, the shift of referentiality of the subject terms, together 
with the combination with the intended referent for the demonstrative 
noun phrase «this room», generate the possible readings for propositions 
involving referential expressions. Moreover, such process of generation of 
possible readings, although to a larger extent integrating pragmatic factors, 
eventually gives rise to a perfectly treatable, clear and formal semantic 
representation. Also, insofar as it is rooted in the formalism of DRT, which 
relies on a construction algorithm, there is hope that an algorithm can be 
built also for DS, even though DS is at present far from such result.
In conclusion, it seems to me that the overall strategy used by DS to 
deal with cases of ambiguity in the uses of referential expressions comes 
really close to the machinery of Ockham’s supposition theory, at least 
as it is presented in Dutilh Novaes’ interpretation. The analogies can be 
sketched as follows:
1.  In both cases we are faced not with sentence-types, but with 
utterance meaning in speciﬁ c contexts of use. Accordingly, in 

 
SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF REFERENCE 
323
both cases we have a single-level rich semantics which integrates 
pragmatic factors.
2.  In both cases we rely on a small set of semantic rules (Ockham) or 
procedures (DS), which are able to generate possible readings for 
sentences involving referential expressions. Such rules/procedures 
are quite similar in nature as they only state that, given the 
difference in intentio behind a term, it can shift its referential import 
(in medieval terminology, it can supposit for something different 
from its default supposition). Also, it is from the combination of 
possible supposita (i.e., in DS, of possible intentions of mental 
states) from subject and predicate terms (at least in declarative 
sentences) that the legitimate, truth-conditionally distinct readings 
are generated. 
3.  In both theories, although the outcome of the semantic machinery 
is a logico-semantic representation, the identiﬁ cation of the 
speaker’s intentions is at the basis of the distinction between the 
possible readings.
4.  In both cases, we have a scale of salience among the possible 
readings, one that goes from the default reading (which is also 
the most referential reading) to the much dispersed and accidental 
readings. Furthermore, given point (3), in both cases the default 
reading is exactly the one which (in medieval terminology) is 
aimed to «directing one’s attention to the things it signiﬁ es»58. 
And the similarities, I think, could be further spelled out. 
Conclusions
What I believe is the crucial merit of such analogy is that it shows that 
ambiguity of propositions including referential expressions is a pervasive 
phenomenon. Contemporary treatments of such phenomenon are usually 
very different from the one of DS, as they focus either on the construction 
of a semantic machinery as to picking up a unique referent (as in theories 
of reference) or on the pragmatic discussion about the context-sensitivity 
of referential expression. 
58 DUTILH NOVAES, «An intensional interpretation», p. 386.

324 
LUCA SBORDONE
By contrast, DS and supposition theory both start from the 
acknowledgment of such ambiguities (even though, of course, the very 
kind of ambiguities which is worth to be taken into account considerably 
changed through the centuries), and offer a non-trivial machinery to 
generate the possible readings of ambiguous propositional forms, one 
which is semantic and formal but crucially involves implementation of 
pragmatic elements in the semantic representation.
Dutilh Novaes wrote: 
In truth, theories of supposition have proven to be extremely 
resistant to comparisons with modern semantic theories. In fact, it 
is probably not an overstatement to say that we still do not know 
exactly what theories of supposition were supposed to accomplish59. 
Paul Vincent Spade claimed that the theory of supposition is among 
those medieval semantic theories which
seem to have sprung full-grown from the head of Zeus –without 
explanation, without motivation, without preparation, without 
anything to help us ﬁ gure out what was really going on60. 
I think I could have come across a contemporary semantic theory, which 
is by no means resistant to comparison with Ockham’s supposition theory, 
but that by contrast comes incredibly close to this medieval doctrine. My 
hope is that such comparison with a modern semantic theory (for which, 
instead, we know exactly what it is supposed to accomplish) may help to 
shed a bit of light on the rationale behind medieval theories of supposition.

Jerónimo Pardo on the formality of the expository syllogism
1. Jerónimo Pardo and the terminist analysis of syllogisms
The logical work of Jerónimo Pardo (Medulla Dyalectices, printed in 
Paris in 1500 and, posthumously, in 1505) is an excellent window into 
the problems, notions and techniques characteristic of terminist (more 
speciﬁ cally, Buridanian) analysis of language1. The choice of a quaestio-
like structure and the use of sophismatic propositions to test the logical 
doctrines make this work not merely an exposition of theories and 
techniques, but a vivid discussion of a number of crucial issues.
Chapter IX «De sillogismi» has the added interest of bearing 
witness to the application of the terminist notions and techniques to a 
well established theory, Aristotelian syllogistic, which provides a testing 
ground for the terminist tools. Throughout the chapter Pardo examines 
apparent counterexamples to the Aristotelian theory of the syllogism (and 
to its novel medieval extensions), and he uses the theory of the properties 
of terms to overcome the difﬁ culties.
Among the different counterexamples to syllogistic theory, Pardo deals 
with a group of well-known trinitarian paralogisms2. The complexity of

the theological discourse about the Trinity (one indivisible divine essence 
which is identical to three distinct divine persons), which stimulated the 
development of the theory of suppositio on theological demands, now 
provides to the logician a very interesting framework for putting terminist 
logic to the test. I will concentrate on this group of counterexamples, in 
order to see how Pardo assesses, as a logician, the notions and distinctions 
that were introduced to solve problems in the theological domain.
On the other hand, I will focus exclusively on the expository 
syllogism3. Syllogisms with a singular middle term are not just another 
instance among the collection of counterexamples to syllogistic doctrine: 
the interest of this family of counterexamples goes beyond syllogistic, and 
reaches general questions about the nature of singular terms and the logical 
analysis of propositions which contain them. In particular, trinitarian terms 
with their peculiarities help to raise crucial questions about singular tems 
and discrete supposition.
In what follows I will present Pardo’s analysis of the threat that singular 
trinitarian terms pose to the formality of expository syllogism. My interest 
is more doctrinal than historical: I am looking for an understanding of the 
terminist conception of logical form (what can count as a formal element 
for a terminist logician, and what kind of tools they have developed for 
the analysis of logical form). In addition, Pardo’s pages on the expository 
syllogism not only offer a general inquiry into the terminist understanding 
of the logical form of singular syllogistic premises, but they contain a lucid 
exposition of the limits of a non-formalised analysis of logical form.
The chapter is structured in two main parts. In the ﬁ rst of these, I will 
give a brief introduction to put the discussion in context: ﬁ rst, I will present 
the problem of the formality of expository syllogism; second, I will outline 
the main features of the semantics of trinitarian terms and the logical device 
that was designed to solve trinitarian paralogisms (namely, the construction 
of new artiﬁ cial propositions to effect the logical analysis of syllogistic 
premises). After that, the core of the chapter will deal with Pardo’s analysis 
of this device: ﬁ rst, I will present his arguments concerning the logical

properties of these new propositions; second, I will examine his arguments 
concerning the suitability of the new propositions for the analysis of the 
formal validity of expository syllogisms.
2. The formality of the expository syllogism
When late-medieval terminist logicians incorporated syllogistic theory 
as a part of the theory of consequentiae, they wanted to highlight the formal 
character of syllogistic consequences. Because of his Buridanian heritage, 
this is Pardo’s concern as well: in the chapter «De sillogismi», syllogism is 
presented as a species of consequentia formalis, and the counterexamples 
(substitution instances of valid syllogisms) are discussed as threats to the 
formality of syllogistic inference4.
Let us take a standard example of an expository syllogism:
(1) Socrates est animal,
 
Socrates est homo,
 
ergo homo est animal.
And let us, following Pardo, form a substitution instance by replacing the 
original categorematic terms with trinitarian terms:
(2) Iste Deus est Pater,
 
iste Deus est Filius,
 
ergo Filius est Pater.
Aristotle had grounded the validity of syllogisms on the nature 
of the predicative relations that are expressed by means of universal 
propositions. But singular premises do not seem to follow the rules 
of universal predication. The standard account of the validity of an 
expository syllogism relies instead on a pair of metaphysical principles 
concerning sameness and difference. For an afﬁ rmative proposition, 
4 Pardo inherits from Buridan the substitutional account of formal validity: «Dico 
autem illos syllogismos tenere gratia forme qui in nullis terminis habent instantiam 
consimili forma et ordinatione praemissarum et conclusionis». Johannes Buridanus, 
Summulae de dialectica, Lib. V, cap. 3.

328 
PALOMA PÉREZ-ILZARBE
the principle is: «Quaecumque uni et eidem sunt eadem, inter se sunt 
eadem»5.
The principle of sameness shows immediately the validity of syllogism 
number 1. But, in the trinitarian example, this regulative principle fails: 
sameness is not transitive in the case of the relations between the divine 
essence and the divine persons. Then, if a syllogism is valid whereas a 
substitution instance is not, it follows that the ﬁ rst one is not formally valid.
Facing this kind of problem, one option is to choose to preserve the 
formality of syllogistic inference at the price of restricting the scope of 
Aristotelian logic: Aristotelian logic is not applicable to the trinitarian 
domain, so the Trinity is not a source of possible substitution instances6. Yet 
another option is developing the logical tools that will allow to incorporate 
the semantic peculiarities of trinitarian terms as further elements of the 
logical form of an inference7.
3. The new logical analysis of syllogistic premises
Brieﬂ y, the peculiar ontology of the Trinity, for which non-transitive 
relations of sameness hold, imposes some peculiarities on the semantic

S. KNUUTTILA, «Generality and identity in late medieval discussions of the Prior 
Analytics», Vivarium, 48 (2010) 215-227.
6 A “logic of faith” is proposed in this case, specially designed for the trinitarian 
domain. Examples of this line of thought are the Centiloquium theologicum, the 
De modo predicandi ac syllogizandi in divinis, and some passages in Holcot’s 
commentary on the Sentences. See H. GELBER, Exploring the Boundaries of Reason:

JERÓNIMO PARDO ON THE FORMALITY

properties of trinitarian terms. On the one hand, a term with a unique 
signiﬁ cate can have a potential multiplicity of supposita. But, on the other 
hand, the fact is that the term does not supposit for all these in the same 
way. A distinction is usual between what can be taken to be different levels 
of supposition. First, an immediate supposition (suppositio immediata) 
derives from the original term’s imposition to signify, but second, a 
mediated supposition (suppositio mediata) derives from the ontological 
connections between this primary signiﬁ cate and other things which are 
the same as it. For example, the term “essentia divina”, which signiﬁ es the 
divine essence, supposits in an immediate way for the divine essence, and 
supposits in a mediated way for the Father, for the Son and for the Holy 
Spirit.
This distinction of the two levels of supposition was then transferred 
to the analysis of syllogism: it grounds a distinction between two degrees 
of universality. Distribution is one of the terminist tools that allows us to 
formulate the Aristotelian regulative principles dici de omni and dici de 
nullo in semantic terms: the principles are understood as a requirement 
that the middle term is distributed. But the multiplicity of supposition 
introduced by the trinitarian ontology raises a question about the scope of 
the distribution which is required for a syllogism to be valid. Given that 
there are two levels of supposition, does the requirement that the middle 
term be distributed reach only the immediate supposita or also the mediated 
supposita of the term? For a syllogism to be ruled by the dici de omni, a 
complete distribution for all supposita is required (distributio completa), in 
contrast with an incomplete distribution for just the immediate supposita 
(distributio incompleta).
Now, in order to reach all supposita in the analysis of logical form, a 
metalinguistic device has been designed: complete distribution is expressed 
by means of the circumlocution “omne ens quod est”. The syncategorem 
“omnis” is not sufﬁ cient to make explicit the strongly universal logical 
form that is required for a syllogism to be ruled by the dici de omni. In view 
of the trinitarian counterexamples, the logical form of “omnis essentia 
divina est Pater” has to be rendered by a complex expression “omne ens 
quod est essentia divina est Pater”.
In contrast with the sycategorem “omnis”, which distributes for the 
immediate supposita, the device “omne ens quod est” is aimed at reaching 
the two levels of supposita. The difference between the level of immediate 
supposita and the level of mediated supposita is erased by the action of the 

330 
PALOMA PÉREZ-ILZARBE
categorematic term “ens”, whose ability to suppose for every thing has the 
effect of extensionalising the analysis. The complex expression “ens quod 
est essentia divina” reaches all the things of which “est essentia divina” can 
be truly said, independently of the original imposition to signifying.
This framework, which allows us to solve a number of counterexamples 
to syllogisms with a common middle term, can also be applied to expository 
syllogisms. Given that syllogisms with trinitarian terms fail to be governed 
by the rules of sameness and difference, a solution lies in extending the 
principles dici de omni and dici de nullo to any kind of syllogisms. But, 
in order to be governed by these principles, singular premises must be 
converted into de omni premises, and this is done precisely by means of the 
circumlocution “ens quod est”.
The valid form of an expository syllogism is not, therefore, this one:
(3) Iste A est C,
 
iste A est B,
 
ergo B est C.
But this one:
(4) Omne est quod est iste A est C,
 
omne ens quod est iste A est B,
 
ergo B est C.
Pardo accepts this strategy as a solution to the counterexample8. 
But next he offers an analysis and assessment of the new metalinguistic 
expression “omne ens quod est iste A est C”. This new proposition is 
8 MD 140va: «Sed quia conveniens est non negare sillogismum expositorium 
formatum ex terminis divinis, alie regule accipiende sunt per quas sillogismi 
expositorii regulari dicantur, et possent poni illa duo principia, scilicet per dici de 
omni et dici de nullo. Per dici de omni pro sillogismis expositoriis afﬁ rmativis, per 
dici de nullo pro sillogismis expositoriis negativis. Diceretur ergo secundum hoc ad 
primum sillogismum tactum, scilicet: hec essentia divina est pater, distinguendo aut 
illa propositio accipitur in sensu de omni aut non. Si sic, dico quod bene est regula 
de omni et sillogismus ille regulatur per dici de omni, quia sensus maioris est iste: de 
quocunque verum est dicere quod est hec essentia divina verum est dicere quod est 
pater, et in minori dico de aliquo puta de ﬁ lio quod est hec essentia divina, ergo in 
conclusione de eodem debeo dicere quod est pater; et tunc sicut conclusio est falsa ita 
et maior».

not only assessed as a tool to save the formal validity of the expository 
syllogism, but it is also taken by itself as an object of logical analysis. 
I will treat separately both sides of Pardo’s analysis: ﬁ rst, his arguments 
concerning the logical properties of this new kind of proposition (more 
speciﬁ cally, concerning the quantity of the metalinguistic proposition and 
the supposition of the subject); and second, his arguments concerning the 
role of this propositional structure in the validity of syllogisms.
4. The logical properties of “omne ens quod est iste A est B”
This kind of structure, in which a singular subject term is determined 
by a universal syncategorem, immediately raises the question about the 
quantity of the proposition and about the logical properties of its subject 
term. Is it a singular or a universal proposition? Does the subject have 
discrete supposition (as corresponds to a singlar term), or is it distributed 
by the universal syncategorem? Pardo explores two alternative answers 
before giving his own response. His pages offer a thorough investigation 
into the nature of singular terms and into the effect on supposition theory 
of the peculiar semantics of trinitarian terms.
4.1. Singular but distributed subject term
Pardo’s colleague in Paris Petrus Rouauld is the advocate of an 
ingenious ﬁ rst answer. On the one hand, he is certain that a singular term 
cannot have but discrete supposition, and the proposition containing it 
cannot be but a singular one. On the other hand, he accepts that, in order for 
the syllogism to be valid, it is required that the subject is distributed. The 
combination of these two requirements (the discrete supposition demanded 
by the singularity of the subject term, and the distribution required for 
the validity of the syllogism) leads him to introduce a new species of 
supposition: suppositio discreta distributiva. The phrase “omne ens quod 
est” is thus interpreted as a complex syncategorem which has an effect on 
discrete supposition.
The consistency of the “ens quod est” device with the theory of 
the properties of terms seems to require, then, a subdivision of discrete 
supposition. Actually, this is what this solution offers: a complete chart of 

332 
PALOMA PÉREZ-ILZARBE
different kinds of discrete supposition, depending on the signs that affect 
the singular term. In parallel with the subdivisions of personal supposition 
for common terms, discrete supposition can be plainly discrete (discreta 
simpliciter), when no sign is affecting the singular term, but it can also 
be discreta distributiva (when the new syncategorem “omne quod est” is 
added), it can be determinata (when “aliquid quod est” is added) and confusa 
tantum (when the term follows mediately the distributing syncategorem)9.
This solution combines two achievements. On the one hand, 
concerning syllogistic theory, it translates the rule of predication into the 
semantic idiom of supposition and distribution, in a way that does not go 
against the nature of expository syllogism. For the syllogism to be valid 
it must be governed by the dici de omni; therefore, at least one premise 
must be equivalent to a de omni proposition. But this does not mean in this 
account that the premise turns out to be universal. This rather means that, 
the premise remaining singular, its singular subject is distributed.
On the other hand, concerning terminist logic in general, this solution 
incorporates the new metalinguistic device into the semantic framework of 
the properties of terms, by ﬁ nding a speciﬁ c place for the new propositions: 
there is room for new kinds of singular propositions, according to the new 
species of discrete supposition, effected by the complex syncategorems 
“omne quod est”, “aliquid quod est”10.
9 MD 140vb: «Unde oppinatur quattuor esse species suppositionum discretarum: 
est quedam simpliciter singularis, quedam determinata, quedam confusa tantum, quedam 
confusa et distributiva. Discreta simpliciter est terminus discrete supponens cui nullum 
additur confusionis signum aut determinationis, ut cum dicitur: Sortes currit. Sed discreta 
determinata est terminus discrete supponens cui additur signum particulare, ut si hoc nomen 
a signiﬁ caret simpliciter et immediate essentiam divinam, tunc hec propositio negaretur: 
a non potest communicari multis, sicut et hec: essentia divina non est communicabilis, 
et tamen hec bene concederetur: aliquid quod est a non potest communicari, sicut et hec: 
aliquid quod est essentia divina non est communicabilis, ut patet, non ergo videtur propter 
quid una concedatur et alia negetur nisi quia ly a supponit utrobique discrete (cum sit 
nomen proprium supponens) sed in prima supponit discrete simpliciter et in alia discrete 
determinate. Sed suppositio discreta confusa tantum est terminus supponens discrete qui 
mediate sequitur signum distributivum afﬁ rmativum, ut cum dicitur: omne quod est deus 
est a. Sed discreta distributiva est cum tali termino discrete supponenti praeponitur signum 
universale, ut dicendo: omne quod est a est deus».
10 There is a technical difference between the use of “omne quod est” and the use 
of “omne ens quod est”, which can be ignored in the present context: see my «Late 
medieval trinitarian syllogistics», pp. 248-250.

 
JERÓNIMO PARDO ON THE FORMALITY 
333
However, Pardo critically examines this peculiar understanding 
of singular terms. He does so on two grounds: on the one hand, he asks 
whether the nature of singular terms is being respected after all; on the 
other hand, he asks about the power of the device “ens quod est” as a tool 
for the analysis of logical form.
Concerning the nature of singular terms, Pardo is convinced that 
signiﬁ cation has priority over supposition: singular terms are singular 
because they have been imposed to signify a unique thing, or because 
they signify a unique thing by ostension. This means that a singular term 
resists by it own nature (repugnat) to be taken for several things. If we 
take “a” to be the proper name of a unique thing, there is no room for 
this term to be taken for all its signiﬁ cates in different ways, no matter 
which signs are added. The addition of a universal sign does not change 
this nature. It is inconsistent, thefore, to speak of a distributed discrete 
supposition11.
Pardo emphasises an important point: it is not the linguistic level 
which determines the logical properties of propositions and terms (the 
mere presence of a sign does not give the term a distributed supposition, 
for example); it is the cognitive level which does so. Language is just a 
tool: logical form has to do with the different ways in which things can be 
thought (with the help of this tool).
Concerning the power of the device, Pardo denounces the insufﬁ ciency 
of this tool even inside the new frame of the subdivision of discrete 
supposition. Supposing that this frame is accepted, three new species of 
singularity are obtained by adding the “quod est” to the singular term in 
11 MD 140vb-141ra: «Sic enim arguo: non propterea aliqua debet dici suppositio 
distributiva quia subiecto addatur signum universale, igitur declaratio non est sufﬁ ciens. 
Antecedens patet, quia si a imponeretur ad signiﬁ candum aliquam animam singularem, 
sic dicendo: omne quod est a est in corpore platonis, tunc ly a non distribueretur 
discrete, immo tam discrete supponeret sicut si dicerem a est in corpore platonis. Quod 
patet ex eo quia tantum ei repugnat accipi pro pluribus posito illo signo sicut eo ablato, 
ergo non magis distribuitur propter additionem signi quam non apposito signo. Et 
conﬁ rmatur, quia iste denominationes: distributiva, determinata, confusa tantum, non 
dicuntur aliqui termino convenire propter solam additionem alicuius signi, sed quia 
signo addito intellectus mediante eo tanquam instrumento accipit illum terminum pro 
omnibus suius signiﬁ catis copulative vel disiunctive et sic de aliis, sed in proposito ita 
est quod repugnat intellectum accipere ly a aliquo illorum modorum eque bene sicut 
si dicerem a est in corpore platonis, ergo tam discrete supponit signo non addito sicut 
addito».

334 
PALOMA PÉREZ-ILZARBE
the required way. But, would it be possible to express the plain singularity 
by means of the circumlocution “quod est”? It seems that if no sign of 
quantity was added, then plain singularity would be obtained.
For example, in “ens quod est hec essentia divina est Pater”, the 
subject seems to have plain discrete supposition. But in this framework, 
the contradictory of this singular proposition should be: “ens quod est hec 
essentia divina non est Pater”. Pardo objects that the two contradictories 
can be true at the same time. Despite the ingenious way of combining 
distribution with singularity, this problem reveals that the potential 
multiplicity of supposita of trinitarian terms has not been correctly 
integrated into the new framework of discrete supposition12.
4.2. Common subject term
Pardo turns then to the opinon of another, more famous, colleague of 
his at the University of Paris: John Mair. Concerning the quantity of “omne 
ens quod est hec essentia divina est Pater”, Mair has no doubt that the 
proposition is universal, because the subject is not a singular but a common 
term (despite the singular appearance).
This answer belongs to a completely different way of accounting for 
the multiplicity of supposita of trinitarian terms: the fact that the term “hec 
essentia divina” can supposit for a multiplicity of things sufﬁ ces for it 
to be a common term. The criterion for distinguishing between singular 
and common terms is not the number of signiﬁ cates, but the number of 
supposita. When peculiar ontological relations take signiﬁ cates and 
supposita apart, some unexpected results are bound to obtain.
A ﬁ rst corollary is that this opinion sets an exception to the rule 
according to which a singular term can be constructed by adding a 
demonstrative pronoun to a common term. This rule is broken when 
the term signiﬁ es something which is at the same time one and several 
12 MD 141ra: «Item sic arguo: iste modus non salvat quin due contradictorie sint 
simul vere, nam capio istas duas: ens quod est hec essentia divina est pater, ens quod 
est hec essentia divina non est pater, sunt contradictorie cum subiectum supponat in 
utraque simpliciter discrete secundum illum modum (sicut dicendo: omne ens quod 
est hec essentia divina est pater, subiectum supponit distributive discrete), quia ei 
non additur aliquod signum universale vel particulare sed solum singulare. Et ita iste 
modus relinquitur propter istas rationes».

 
JERÓNIMO PARDO ON THE FORMALITY 
335
things. In other words, “essentia divina” cannot be singularised by the 
“hec”13. The important consequence is that the logical form of a singular 
proposition goes beyond the presence or absence of a demonstrative 
pronoun. “Hec domus est bona” does not have the same logical form 
as “hec essentia divina est Pater”, since they differ in quantity: the ﬁ rst 
is singular and the second is indeﬁ nite. Again, when trinitarian terms 
are involved, the pure linguistic level is not sufﬁ cient to set the logical 
form14.
The device “ens quod est” is always the tool that brings the ontological 
peculiarities into the logical level. But the “ens quod est” does not serve 
in this second solution to exhibit a new singular logical form, which is 
more ﬁ ne-grained than the plain singularity. It serves instead to exhibit 
the universal logical form which was hidden under the appearance of 
singularity.
But then there follows a second awkward corollary: singular 
propositions cannot be constructed with trinitarian terms (and therefore, 
expository syllogisms cannot be constructed either). Pardo does not want 
such a limitation, so he has to ﬁ nd a way to preserve the singularity of the 
term “hec essentia divina”.
13 MD 141ra: «Contra istum modum dicendi essent alique instantie. Prima 
est: quelibet propositio indeﬁ nita per additionem signi singularis potest ﬁ eri 
singularis, hec enim est una conditio propositionis indeﬁ nite, quod ex additione 
signi singularis relinquitur una propositio singularis. Sed ista est indeﬁ nita: 
essentia divina est pater, ergo per additionem signi singularis ad subiectum ﬁ t 
una propositio singularis, et per consequens ista est singularis: hec essentia divina 
est pater. Ad hanc instantiam respondetur quod illa propositio vera est si ille 
terminus sit singularisabilis, modo dico quod ly essentia divina non est terminus 
singularisabilis, et hoc provenit quia signiﬁ cat talem rem que non solum est una res 
sed etiam plures et quelibet earum seorsum, ideo ex parte signiﬁ cati accidit quod 
non possit ille terminus singularisari».
14 MD 141ra-rb: «Secunda instantia est quia tunc contradictio non esset oppositio 
formalis. Patet, quia iste due non contradicerent formaliter: hec domus est bona hec 
domus non est bona, cum in simili forma darentur propositiones non contradicentes, 
videlicet iste due: hec essentia divina est pater, hec essentia divina non est pater. Ad 
hanc instantiam respondetur quod ille non sunt similes forme, ex eo quod quantitas 
(que ex parte forme contradictionis se tenet) non est similis in utrisque».

4.3.  Singular subject term at the language level, common subject term in 
the metalanguage
Pardo proposes a different criterion for distinguishing singular from 
common terms, one that does not threaten the possibility of constructing 
singular propositions with trinitarian terms. He turns to the distinction 
between the two “levels” of supposition: although the term “essentia divina” 
supposits for a multiplicity, it does not supposit for all these things in the 
same way. One suppositum is more closely related to signiﬁ cation: the term 
supposits immediate for the thing that it has been imposed to signify. The rest 
of the supposita are not there by the original imposition but by ontological 
connections: the term supposits mediate for the things which are the same as 
the immediate suppositum. Then, according to Pardo, singularity has to be 
determined by the immediate suppositum only: the existence of a multiplicity 
of mediated supposita does not prevent the term from being singular15.
Now, granted that the term “hec essentia divina” is genuinely singular, 
Pardo turns his attention to the quantity of the metalinguistic proposition 
“omne ens quod est hec essentia divina est Pater”. And here is the important 
difference between Pardo’s view and the ﬁ rst opinion. According to that 
opinion, “hec essentia” is a singular term and the preﬁ x “omne ens quod 
est” is a syncategorem which makes the term have a distributive discrete 
suppositon. Pardo interprets differently the metalinguistic expression: 
there is no special quantiﬁ er which is acting on the singular term. There 
is instead a new categorematic term “ens quod est hec essentia divina”, 
which is affected by the usual universal syncategorem “omnis”. This has an 
interesting effect on the logical properties of the metalinguistic proposition.
Pardo’s criterion for singularity (singularity has to be determined 
by the immediate suppositum only) can be applied to the metalinguistic 
expression “ens quod est hec essentia divina”. As this term immediately 
supposits for a multiplicity, it is a common, not a singular term16. The 
15 MD 141rb: «Ideo omnibus hiis inspectis et consideratis preter dicta in principio 
huius capituli, aliter michi videtur dicendum, supponendo illum communiorem modum 
dicendi quod terminus non propterea debet negari singularis quia supponat pro pluribus 
nisi supponat pro illis pluribus immediate, ideo si ly a imponatur ad signiﬁ candum 
hanc essentiam divinam, est terminus discretus, quia licet supponat pro patre et ﬁ lio et 
spiritu sancto non tum immediate sed mediate».
16 MD 141va: «Tum dico quod non est simile de ly a et de hoc composito ens quod 
est a, istud enim complexum ens quod est a est terminus communis et non ly a. Hoc 

 
JERÓNIMO PARDO ON THE FORMALITY 
337
reason why it supposits this way is that the term “hec essentia divina” is 
not apt to singularise the term “ens”. Again, a traditional rule is broken: not 
every singular term singularises the common term to which it is added, but 
only singular terms that supposit for a unique thing17.
The potential multiplicity of supposita, which does not convert the 
term “hec essentia divina” into a common one (because of the distinction 
between levels of supposition), has nevertheless an effect on the logical 
properties of the metalinguistic expression “ens quod est hec essentia” 
(because of the neutrality of the term “ens” with respect to these levels).
As a consequence, the extensionalisation of the analysis, which was so 
useful when considering language, becomes harmful on the metalinguistic 
level: the term “ens” has the effect of erasing the distinction between 
two levels of supposition that the theologians had carefully drawn. Thus, 
when the syllogistic premise is analysed by means of the circumlocution 
“ens quod est”, its quantity gets changed: although the syllogistic premise 
“hec essentia divina est Pater” is a singular proposition, the metalinguistic 
proposition which allegedly renders its logical form “omne ens quod est 
hec essentia divina est Pater” is a universal proposition, not a singular one. 
The result of Pardo’s treatment of trinitarian singular terms is a 
mismatch between the language which is analysed and the metalanguage 
that is used to make the analysis. Pardo has encountered one of the 
shortcomings of Latin as a tool for logical analysis: at least in the case of 
trinitarian singular terms, a natural language seems to be unable to render 
the logical form of the syllogistic premises. The multiplicity of supposita 
which is peculiar to the term “haec essentia divina” was taken to be a 
formal element of the syllogistic premise, and the device “ens quod est” 
was designed to make explicit this ingredient of the logical form. Although 
this is achieved, other logical properties are lost on the way. This has an 
effect on the adequacy of this tool for the analysis of syllogistic validity.
sic ostendo, quia ly ens quod est a supponit immediate pro pluribus, scilicet pro patre 
et ﬁ lio et spiritu sancto, non sic ly a».
17 MD 141va: «Et si dicas: omnis terminus discretus singularisat terminum 
communem cui additur, respondeo terminus discretus qui tam mediate quam immediate 
supponit pro uno et non pro pluribus divisive singularisat terminum communem cui 
additur, non autem terminus singularis qui supponit mediate pro pluribus. Ideo ly a 
seu ly essentia cum mediate supponat pro pluribus non oportet ut restringat ly ens, cui 
convenit supponere pro illis pluribus etiam immediate».

PALOMA PÉREZ-ILZARBE
5. The “quod est” device as a tool for logical analysis
Pardo notices that the metalinguistic propositions that make explicit 
some of the elements of logical form do not manage to preserve all the 
relevant logical properties. He points out that, if the “quod est” device is 
used to analyse the premises of an expository syllogism with divine terms, 
the metalinguistic result is not an expository syllogism but a syllogism 
with a common middle term18. For example:
(5) Hec essentia divina est Pater,
 
Filius est hec essentia divina,
 
ergo Filius est Pater,
(6) Omne ens quod est hec essentia divina est Pater,
 
Filius est ens quod est hec essentia divina,
 
ergo Filius est Pater.
Given that “ens quod est hec essentia divina” is a common term, 
the metalinguistic syllogism conforms to the pattern of the usual Darii 
mood. But, according to Pardo, the connection between the analysed 
proposition and the analysans proposition must be of logical equivalence. 
This requirement is not met in the case of singular terms such as “hec 
essentia divina”, because the analysans proposition does not preserve the 
singularity of the proposition analysed. This means that the requirement 
for an expository syllogism to be valid is not met: the premise does not 
convert into a de omni proposition. This makes every expository syllogism 
with trinitarian terms invalid after all19.
Pardo reports an attempted solution that makes use of the distinction 
between essential divine terms (essentiales) and personal divine terms 
(personales). An essential singular term supposits immediate for a 
unique thing but mediate for a plurality of things. A personal singular 
term supposits for a unique thing both mediate and immediate. When a 
18 MD 141va: «Et si contra ista obiiciatur, quia si ista essent vera sequeretur quod 
sic arguendo non esset sillogismus expositorius: omne ens quod est hec essentia divina 
est pater, ﬁ lius est ens quod est hec essentia divina, ergo ﬁ lius est pater. Respondeo 
concedendo quod non est sillogismus expositorius, sed est sillogismus factus in darii».
19 MD 141va: «Et si dicas, quid ergo dicendum ad illum sillogismum: hec essentia 
divina est pater, ﬁ lius est hec essentia divina ergo ﬁ lius est pater, respondeo: ponitur 
conditio ad bonum sillogismum expositorium quod maior inferat unam de omni, quia 
illa maior non infert unam de omni, ideo non est [bonus] sillogismus expositorius».

 
JERÓNIMO PARDO ON THE FORMALITY 
339
syllogism is constructed with a personal singular term as its middle term, 
the metalinguistic proposition that renders the de omni sense of the major 
premise is still a singular one. For example, “hic Pater non est Filius”, says 
Pardo, is analysed as “omne ens quod est hic Pater non est Filius”, which 
is singular because there is no multiplicity of supposita20.
But Pardo realises that the problem is not solved but deferred, since the 
mismatch between the proposition analysed and the analysans proposition 
is reproduced at the meta-metalevel. For example, if “ens quod est hic 
Pater” is a singular term, it forms an expository syllogism whose validity 
has to be established by ﬁ nding a de omni reading of the major premise. 
Given that the singular term at the metalinguistic level “ens quod est hic 
Pater” has a multiplicity of mediated supposita, the meta-metalinguistic 
premise that might try to render the de omni sense will eventually contain 
a common, not a singular term: “ens quod est ens quod est hic Pater”21. The 
neutralising effect of the term “ens” acts on supposition sooner or later.
In the end, Pardo seems obliged to accept Burdian’s conclusion: the 
formality of syllogistic inference is only saved if the device “ens quod est” 
is introduced at the language level22. This simply reveals, in my opinion, 
one of the limits of Latin as a tool for logical analysis.
20 MD, 141va: «Responderet fortasse aliquis concedendo quod duplices

6. Conclusion
In sum, Pardo is confronted with a problem about the scope of a 
certain analysis of logical form. On the one hand, he is in principle open 
to the possibility of applying traditional logic to the analysis of trinitarian 
discourse. This is a sign of Pardo’s conception of the nature of logic. Logic 
cannot be separated from ontology and epistemology: logical form does 
not belong to language by itself, but it depends on how things are and how 
we know them.
But, on the other hand, Pardo’s ﬁ nal verdict against expository trinitarian 
syllogisms concerns the inability of a certain tool to analyse logical form 
in the required depth. The language of supposition and distribution seems 
to have been well adapted to the peculiarities of trinitarian terms, but the 
Latin which is used to make this logical form explicit is not sufﬁ cient to 
preserve the ﬁ ne-grained distinctions that theologians had introduced. 
Perhaps a fully artiﬁ cial language is required, one that has the resources to 
express levels of supposition, which the “ens quod est” cannot express23.
 adversarios ﬁ dei, sed dicendum est quod non tenent tales sillogismi quando maior non 
est regula de omni, quod non potest ﬁ eri nisi quando maior infert unam de omni, et quia 
illa maior non infert unam de omni ideo non est bonus sillogismus. Si autem capiatur 
ista maior: omne ens quod est essentia divina est pater, bene poterit ﬁ eri sillogismus et 
hoc est forte quod quidam voluerunt dicere quod tales consequentie non sunt formales 
nisi subiectum determinetur per ly ens quod est».

III. Natural or Ideal Language?


ALLAN BÄCK∗
ARISTOTELIAN PROTOCOL LANGUAGES
An alternative approach to the history of philosophy –one that 
takes the aim of opening up the discipline seriously– would treat both 
Western and non-Western philosophy as the regional inﬂ ections of a 
global phenomenon1. In what follows I shall illustrate this approach by 
showing how Islamic and Latin Aristotelians inherited the same project, 
of constructing an ideal, protocol language but focused on developing 
different aspects of it. 
Plato urges us to speak so as to chop reality up at the joints. Along 
these lines, Aristotle himself develops an ideal, protocol language, mostly 
on an ad hoc basis. He invents terms for character traits when Greek does 
not have them; he legislates away certain ways of talking in his doctrines of 
paronymy and unnatural predication; he uses some very unusual syntactic 
structures in presenting his logical analysis of the statement. 
I shall look brieﬂ y at how Aristotle develops an ideal protocol 
language, an artiﬁ cial language isomorphic with the world and its 
structure. His project has two main stages: subtraction and addition. 
First, starting from natural language and its common ways of speaking, 
as he is wont to do in his endoxic method, he prunes away those ways of 
talking that he ﬁ nds erroneous and misleading, as he does with unnatural 
predication. Second, after observing the phenomena and developing his 
theory, he adds terms to the pruned vocabulary, as he does for items in 
the categories. 
Aristotle’s project was continued in medieval times. In general, the 
Latin medievals tended to focus more on the subtraction; the Islamic 
philosophers more on the addition. Both groups were concerned with 
semantic questions such as which terms to allow into the philosophical 
languages as to accord with reality. However, the Islamic philosophers also 
modiﬁ ed its syntax while the Latin medievals seem not to have done so too

much. I cannot give a full account here, but can offer only a few examples 
mostly concerning paronymy and predication. 
Aristotle takes terms signifying abstract paronyms to have fundamental 
ontological importance. In contrast, he parses away those signifying 
concrete paronyms. Likewise Anselm and Ockham worry over which 
paronyms, the abstract or the concrete ones, should be retained, and which 
eliminated, when speaking strictly. Islamic philosophers like Al-Fārābī and 
Avicenna did likewise. Yet they also tended to worry much more explicitly 
than their Latin counterparts over the translation of Aristotle’s texts: how to 
express the same philosophical concepts in Greek and in Arabic, especially 
on account of how much Arabic differs from Greek grammatically. They 
did so by using in Arabic the verbal inﬁ nitive, the maṣdar, to make the 
language of paronymy reﬂ ect the reality more clearly. They also did so 
in their treatments of the statement, by modifying how ordinary Arabic 
expresses the copula and the quantiﬁ ers. 
How philosophically interesting are these issues? I shall end by 
comparing them to some current doctrines.
I. Aristotle’s Protocol Language Project
Aristotle discusses paronymy in his Categories. 
Whatever differ by inﬂ ection are called paronyms: They have their 
appellation in virtue of the name, as the grammatical [man] from 
grammar and the brave [man] from bravery2. 
As paronyms are called by names, they are real objects, not expressions3. 
The basic object is signiﬁ ed by an abstract name, like ‘grammar’ or 
‘whiteness’; the derivative object by a concrete name, like ‘white’ or 
‘grammatical’. Aristotle uses the masculine singular deﬁ nite article here 
2 Aristotle, Cat. 1a12-5, my translation. Ackrill translates thus: «When things get 
their name from something, with a difference of ending, they are called paronyms: 
Thus, for example, the grammarian gets his name from grammar; the brave get theirs 
from bravery».
3 In this way, paronymy, like homonymy and synonymy, is a relation between 
objects. Cf. J. L. ACKRILL, Aristotle’s Categories and De Interpretatione, Oxford 
University Press, New York 1963, pp. 72-73.

345
(e.g., ‘oJ grammatikov"’) to indicate that the derivative term signiﬁ es a man. 
Thus paronyms are two objects referred to by two grammatically related 
terms4. In terms of Aristotle’s theory of categories, the abstract, base term 
refers to an item in a non-substantial category, while the concrete, derivative 
term normally refers to a substance having that item. E.g., ‘white’ names 
the substance having whiteness, while ‘whiteness’ names the quality. ‘The 
dog is white’ is true, while ‘the dog is whiteness’ is false. In contrast, the 
(essential) predication of a species of a genus in any category requires 
that non-derivative terms be used. Thus Aristotle says that ‘whiteness is a 
color’ is true, while ‘whiteness is colored’ is false5. 
This doctrine conﬂ icts with Greek as with Arabic and Latin grammar. 
Abstract terms are not basic grammatically and are usually derived from 
more concrete terms. Rather, Aristotle is making a logical point, about 
which expressions signify directly and primarily existing objects and which 
do not. Other expressions are «inﬂ ections» of these primary ones. Ordinary 
language confuses: it takes as primary «what is primary and evident to us» 
and not what is so in itself6. Boethius makes this point too7. 
Accordingly, in his Metaphysics Aristotle calls items like the white 
compounds8. ‘The white’ does not name a simple being but rather the 
complex of the quality whiteness in an individual substance. For the white 
to exist, it must exist as a white substance. But then the substance is being 
added on to whiteness, the white itself. Aristotle then is rejecting the talk of 
‘the white’ as ontologically basic; what are basic are its abstract paronym 
whiteness and the individual substance.
Aristotle is well aware of departing from common usage, in taking an 
abstract paronym like whiteness as basic and its concrete paronym, the white 
as derivative. Nevertheless, reality requires us to depart from ordinary ways 
of speaking and to admit only the abstract paronyms into the accidental 
categories. He makes the point explicitly for the category of quality9:
4 ‘Inﬂ ection’ here is meant to be taken in a general sense. Cf. Anonymous, 
Commentary on Aristotle’s De Interpretatione, Ed. by L. TARÁN, Meisenheim am Glan, 
Verlag Anton Hain 1978, 2,10-3,5.

9 Elsewhere I have argued that Aristotle intends his point about quality to apply 
to all the accidental categories. 

346

Those stated above are the qualities, while the qualia are those said 
paronymously in virtue of these or in some other such way from 
these. In most cases, even nearly in all, they are said paronymously, 
like ‘white [man]’ from ‘whiteness’, and ‘grammatical [man]’ from 
‘grammar’, and ‘just [man]’ from ‘justice’, and likewise for the other 
cases. In some cases on account of there not being available names 
for the qualities it is not possible for them to be said from them 
paronymously. For example the runner or boxer…Other times, even 
when the name is available, the quale said in virtue of it is not said 
parony mously. For example, the good man is so called from virtue…10. 
The qualities are then admitted to have being in their own right; 
the qualia are not but are only compounds reducible to their more basic 
elements.
Qualities belonging to the category are usually signiﬁ ed by abstract 
terms; not they but names of their associated qualia, derived paronymously 
from them, are predicated of a subject, in the category of substance. 
Aristotle notes two types of exceptions: one where the ordinary language 
has no name available; another where the available name obscures the 
connection. An instance of the ﬁ rst type is the concrete paronym «boxer», 
which has no name for its abstract paronym, natural boxing-ability; an 
instance of the second is the concrete paronym good, which is the quale 
for the quality named by ‘virtue’ (ajpo; th'" ajreth'" oJ spoudai'o")11. 
So here ordinary language is inadequate or its grammar misleads. In 
developing his own position Aristotle develops a technical vocabulary that 
departs from common usage12. In this sense, at least, Aristotle’s thought 
is developmental: starting from ordinary language, he is creating his 
technical language so as to make clear what is really going on. He proceeds 
by eliminating respectable, endoxic ways of talking that do not match up 
with reality and then by introducing new, contrived ways of talking to ﬁ ll 
in the gaps: methods of subtraction and addition. This type of constructing 
an ideal language is semantic, in the sense that Aristotle wants to admit 
only terms that refer directly (or, if indirectly, that can be parsed away) to 
objects in re.

Aristotle makes reforms also of a syntactic type, by subtracting some 
grammatically respectable construction and then adding on some new ones. 
For instance, he legislates away unnatural predication and introduces the 
strange ‘uJpavrcei’ (‘belongs’) structure of predication. Aristotle wants his 
logical subjects to be substances and not accidents. He says that individual 
subjects should not be predicated, even while admitting that we commonly 
do this:
It is clear that some beings are naturally said of no beings. For nearly 
every perceptible is such as not to be predicated of anything except 
per accidens (katav sumbebhkov"). For we say that the white [thing] 
is Socrates, and the one who is approaching is Callias13. 
Aristotle admits that in ordinary discourse singular (terms) are 
predicated, but must be then «predicated per accidens»14. He gives 
examples like ‘the white (thing) is Socrates’, where a name signifying a 
primary substance is predicated of a paronymous expression derived from 
the name of a quality, ‘whiteness’15. But this way of talking does not match 
reality:
One must look for truth from the realities. It holds thus: since there 
is something itself that is predicated of another not per accidens –I 
mean by per accidens as when we sometimes say that that white 
(thing) is a man, this not being similar to our saying that the man 
is white: for he is not white as being something different, while 
the white (thing) [is a man] because being a man has happened to 
white– thus some are such as to be predicated per se16.
Aristotle reafﬁ rms the doctrine of unnatural predication in discussing 
substance. In Categories 2 he characterizes a singular substance as what 
13 Aristotle, An. Pr. 43a32-6, my translation; cf. Aristotle, Soph. El. 179a39-b2; 
Ammonius, In De Int. 53,22-8.
14 Likewise Simplicius, In Cat. 51,13-8, admits that ‘Socrates is Socrates’ is 
a true predication, but denies it to be an instance of the ‘said of’ type. Instead, he 
analyzes it as an instance of the name’s being predicated synonymously of Socrates, as 
opposed to the predication of «one thing of another».
15 ‘The white’ sometimes means ‘whiteness’, but it cannot do so here, for 
‘whiteness is Socrates’ is false.
16 An. Po. 81b22-9, my translation, which differs signiﬁ cantly from Barnes’ here.

is neither in nor said of a subject17. Then, likewise, the name of a singular 
substance would not be able to be predicated of a subject in those ways 
too. He says that in one sense the subject or substratum (upokeimevnon) 
is substance, for everything else is predicated of it, and it is predicated 
of nothing18. Aristotle claims often that a name of a singular substance 
is not predicated of anything19. That is, it is not predicated in the ways 
that Aristotle wants to recognize in his protocol language: ‘being said 
of’ or ‘being in’. Still he does not deny that such predications may occur 
in ordinary speech. He just wants to eliminate them from his technical 
language:
For it is possible to say truly that the white [thing] walks and that 
that large [thing] is a log, and again that the log is large and that the 
man walks. But to speak in the former and to speak in the latter way 
are different. For when I say that the white [thing] is a log, then I 
say that that to which being white happens (sumbevbhke) is a log, 
but the white [thing] is not as a subject for the log: for neither being 
white nor being just which is something white did something come 
to be a log, so that it is not <a log> except as per accidens (katav 
sumbebhkov"). But when I say that the log is white, not that some 
other thing is white, and to that [thing] being a log happens, as when 
I say that the musical [thing] is white (for then I say that the man, 
to which being musical happens, is white), but that the log is the 
subject, just what also came to be <white>20 as it is not something 
different from just what is a log or from some log. If it is necessary 
to legislate, let speaking in this way be to predicate, and speaking 
in that way not to predicate at all, or to predicate not simply but to 
predicate per accidens (katav sumbebhkov"). The predicate is like 
the white (thing), while that of which it is predicated is like the log21. 
In Aristotle’s examples of unnatural predications, the subject 
expression is not even a simple name. Rather, ‘white’ is the concrete 
paronymous term.

20 This is added by the translators as implicit in the text, and it does not make that 
much difference. But note how statements of form ‘S is’ are avoided.
21 An. Po. 83a1-18, my translation; cf. 81b25-9.

 
ARISTOTELIAN PROTOCOL LANGUAGES 
349
A statement like ‘the white is a log’ fails on two grounds: ﬁ rst, a 
paronymous term is used, that strictly does not name anything; if such a 
term be taken loosely, e.g., to name whiteness, either it amounts to saying 
that whiteness is a log, which is false or meaningless, or that whiteness 
provides a substratum or subject in which a log can inhere. But Aristotle 
denies that accidents provide such a substratum. Consequently he would 
not want to call sentences like ‘the white is musical’ or ‘the white is a log’ 
predications at all22. Second, as a primary substance is neither in nor said of 
anything, so too its name should not be predicated of anything. 
While eliminating such «unnatural» predications, Aristotle adds on 
some abnormal ways of talking that match his theory. Even in stating 
propositions of the form ‘every S is P’, he uses a strange word order, as his 
commentators, Greek and otherwise, remarked23. The fundamental form 
that Aristotle gives has the form, ‘e[sti a[nqrwpo"V’ (‘(there) is a man’). In 
a statement de tertio adiacente where the ‘is’ is «additionally predicated», 
Aristotle uses the same, strange word order with the new predicate’s being 
inserted as a qualiﬁ er: ‘e[sti divkaio" a[nqrwpo"V’ which might as well be 
translated as ‘(there) is a just man’ as ‘a man is just’24. I have suggested 
that Aristotle does this because he wants to have every use of the copula 
‘e[stin’ make an assertion of existence25. Be that as it may, in any case, 
Greek commentators like Ammonius found the word order strange enough 
to comment upon that and reformulate the sentences.
Aristotle also introduces, especially in his syllogistic, the unusual 
‘uJpavrcei’ (‘belongs’) construction, as in ‘P belongs to every S’. Perhaps 
he does so in order to make the syllogistic structure more evident via chains 
of the ‘belonging’ relation. Perhaps he has also the motive to insist (?) upon 
a single predication relation in logic despite having some predicates being 
said of a subject while other predicates being in a subject and despite his 
doctrine that being is said in as many ways as there are categories26. In any 
event, the point here is that he has introduced a new syntactic construction.
This new construction may have spurred developments in logical 
theory. In ancient Greek, ‘uJpavrcei’ has other meanings besides ‘belongs

to’. Its literal sense is ‘be there at the beginning’. Hence ‘uJpavrcei’ came 
to mean ‘really exist’, and Aristotle uses it in this sense27. Too, it does 
mean ‘belong to’, in the sense of ‘subsist’ or in the more prosaic sense of 
‘ownership’28. In many of these senses ‘uJpavrcei’ does not serve merely to 
couple, but also to make a claim of existence.
For Ammonius, like Plato, ‘is P’ and ‘is not P’ both require an existing 
subject. He himself speaks of «the reality (u{parxi") signiﬁ ed by ‘is’»29. 
Taking ‘u{parxi"’ in the sense of ‘reality’ as was done in late Greek, gives 
a ‘uJpavrcei’ construction likewise a realist connotation: ‘P belongs to S’ 
suggests that S is real in some relation to P. At any rate, Islamic philosophers 
like Avicenna took it thus.
Thus, although Aristotle begins his theorizing from the endoxi, 
ordinary ways of speaking, he is willing to depart from them, both 
semantically and syntactically, once he thinks that he has grasped the truth, 
both by subtracting some of them and by adding on new ways of talking. 
Islamic philosophers and the Latin medievals accepted these modiﬁ cations 
of ordinary language: paronymy and restrictions on predication. In what 
follows I shall focus on some new modiﬁ cations that they made, both 
syntactic and semantic. 
II. Philosophical language in Islam
Many Islamic philosophers defended and developed the theory of 
Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who had held that all human beings 
have a common mental language of thought, while having differing spoken 
languages signifying those thoughts30. Those like al-Fārābī accordingly 
saw quite different roles for logic and grammar:

Grammar shares with it [logic] to some extent and differs from it 
also, because grammar gives rules only for the expressions which 
are peculiar to a particular nation and to the people who use the 
language, whereas logic gives rules for the expressions which are 
common to all languages31. 
In this it is hard to see philosophers uncritically reﬂ ecting the structure 
of their language games, just as those like Richard Rorty have charged. 
Rather, al-Fārābī makes claims that may well be embraced by a cognitive 
scientist or a linguist today:
That is to say, the thoughts all men understand when expressed in 
their different languages are the same for them. The sense-objects 
which those thoughts are thoughts of are also common to all. For 
whatever individual thing an Indian may have a sensation of– if the 
same thing is observed by an Arab, he will have the same perception 
of it as the Indian32.
Unlike their Greek predecessors, Islamic philosophers regularly 
discussed the different ways in which different languages would express the

Quarterly, 4 (1957) 228,8-10 [trans, p. 233]. Cf. «AI-Fārābī’s Paraphrase of the 
Categories of Aristotle», Ed. and transl. by D. M. DUNLOP, Islamic Quarterly, 4 (1958) 
172,28-173,8 [transl. p. 187, § 9]: «What we have mentioned exists in all languages, 
and it is possible to ﬁ nd the like of it in the existing Arabic language. For the experts 
in Arabic call the short syllables ‘movent’ letters, and the long syllables and what 
resembles them they call asbāb or ‘cords’. What can be combined their language of 
both kinds of syllables they call autād (pegs). Then they combine some of these with 
others and make of them measures greater than these, by which they measure their 
metrical expressions and discourses, e.g., fa̔ūhun, mufā̔īlum, mustuf̔ilun. If this is 
so, then every expression can be measured by a long or short syllable or a combination 
of both. Syllables are the smallest of the parts by which expressions can be measured, 
and the combination of them is greater than they are. These things in the expressions 
are like the cubits among the lengths.» See W. WRIGHT, A Grammar of the Arabic 
Language, Vol. II, 3rd ed., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1967, § 358.

same claims. Since they held to objective standards of thoughts mirroring 
the realities of the world, they could look at the conventions of different 
natural languages and judge them as being more or less adequate and 
perspicacious33. If their indigenous language(s) did the job well, they used 
them. But, if they did not measure up, they felt free to use the conventions 
of another language or to make up new structures to express the truths. 
Al-Fārābī does just this when he discusses the names of the categories: 
they have conventional names in various languages and the technical ones 
reserved for the elite philosophers. He notes that Greek does not give these 
technical names well:
In Greek there may come about something strange, namely that 
there might be a name signifying a category and a species abstracted 
from its subject, where the subject is not named by it insofar as that 
species is made present to it by a name derived from the name of 
that species –but rather by a name derived from the name of another 
species, like ‘excellence’ in Greek. Thus the quale for the quality 
excellence does not use ‘excellent’ as would be done in Arabic. 
Rather there is said ‘diligent’ [spoudai'o"?] or ‘desirous’34.
Here Arabic can do better than Greek to reveal to relationship between 
the paronyms: Aristotle had ‘good’ and ‘virtue’; Arabic has ‘excellent’ and 
‘excellence’.
The Islamic philosophers began their discussions often by working 
from the Greek legacy. The case of paronymy illustrates this. As we have 
seen, in discussing paronymy Aristotle inverts the grammatical order: 
for him, although logically the abstract paronym like whiteness is basic 
and the concrete paronym like the white, derivative, grammatically, the 
paronymous term ‘whiteness’ is not basic but derives from ‘white’. But for 
the philosopher, ordinary language misleads: what is primary and evident 
in it is least primary and evident in itself. 
33 ZIMMERMANN, Al-Fārābī’s Commentary and Short Treatise, p. 
XLIV: 
«[…] since the inventors of different languages had endeavored to capture the same 
logical structures in different ways some could be expected to have been more 
successful than others from case to case; and that where the grammatical conventions 
of a given language failed to arrange for the display of the logical structure of thought 
with optimum perspicuity it was the logician’s task to amend them.»

The Greek grammarians had already discussed such derivative terms, 
which they too called «paronymous». In explaining how to generate the 
derivative forms from the basic ones, they had to make many classes 
and exceptions (here sufﬁ xes are added onto the roots or verb stems35). 
Dionysius Thrax speaks of prototypes and derivatives of nouns. Priscian 
divides the grammatically derivative terms into the inchoative, meditative, 
ﬁ gurative, desiderative, diminutive, etc.36 
The Greek commentators on Aristotle also classiﬁ ed expressions 
signifying Aristotle’s paronyms37. Like some grammarians, they took the 
inﬁ nitives as indeclinable names and as the basic form from which other 
expressions were «inﬂ ected»38. Here the philosophy has inﬂ uenced the 
grammar: the former determines which of the two paronymous things is 
basic, while the latter then shows how to make names up for the other 
paronymous thing. 
The Islamic philosophers and grammarians inherited these doctrines. 
They then needed to apply them to Arabic. Grammatically, Arabic forms 
derivative terms much more systematically and regularly than Greek does: 
from trilateral or quadrilateral roots. Arabic grammarians derived names 
not from these roots but from the maṣdar, the verbal noun39. The maṣdar 
is not as basic morphologically as the trilateral and quadrilateral roots of 
Arabic but comes quite close. Indeed, perhaps these grammarians took the 
maṣdar as basic because their grammatical theory was following the later 
Greek theory, which was in turn following logical or philosophical theory

more than ordinary language40. That is, perhaps they used the maṣdar as 
the equivalent of the verbal inﬁ nitive in the later Greek grammatical theory, 
itself inﬂ uenced by logic and philosophy41. 
Now, because of the regularity of derivations in Arabic, those like 
al-Fārābī saw Arabic to have a much better ﬁ t than Greek in the case 
of expressing the doctrine of paronymy: the maṣdar is basic not only 
grammatically but also logically, with the other forms, verbal and nominal, 
deriving from it. In contrast, in Greek terms derivative in meaning often 
have no morphological connection, as with Aristotle’s example of ‘good’ 
and ‘virtue’ mentioned above. 
Al-Fārābī inherited this tradition of the maṣdar, but not uncritically. 
He discusses complications about what derives from what: the maṣdar 
itself has different types42. He sees some making the mistake of taking the 
concrete paronym as a verb because it derived from a maṣdar, a verbal 
inﬁ nitive43. However, he himself apparently makes the mistake of thinking 
that a Greek copula derives from a maṣdar in the same way that mawjūd 
does in Arabic, so that both mawjūd and e¤stin are nouns:
40 Perhaps not Aristotelian: taking the inﬁ nitive as the basic form might appeal 
to a neo-Platonist…

pp. XXVIII-IX, on the formation of Arabic words; p. XXXIX: «But for semantic rather

that the inﬁ nitives of simple verbs are ordinary nouns, and that verbs were supposed 
to derive from their inﬁ nitives, Al-Fārābī takes Aristotle’s statement that ‘has colored’ 
and ‘colored’ were predicated paronymously to mean that verbs and participles were 
derivative words.»
42 Al-Ḥurūf. 71,12ff. 
43 Al-Fārābī, In De Int., p. 35, ed. KUTSCH – MARROW, p. 42: «in no way is a 
derived noun a verb, inﬂ ected or uninﬂ ected. It is, above all, the Arabic language 
which suggests this idea. The Arabs, lacking a distinct verb-formation for the present 
tense, have put the derived noun in the place of the verb signifying the present time. 
Hence it would not occur to a grammarian of any language possessing a verb which 
signiﬁ es the present time to think of derived nouns as signifying the present time or 
any time whatsoever. People get afﬂ icted with this view just because a verb which 
signiﬁ es the present time is lacking».

We ﬁ nd the same situation in all languages. We ﬁ nd that there are 
hyparctic verbs which signify the present, future and past times. We 
also ﬁ nd that a noun which derives from the inﬁ nitive [maṣdar] of 
the hyparctic verb and which, like other derived nouns, does not 
signify a time is employed, like the hyparctic verbs, as a copula in 
statements whose predicates are nouns. This noun is represented by 
the word mawjūd in Arabic, in Greek by estin and ōn, in Persian 
by ast and hast, and by corresponding expressions in the other 
languages44.
So al-Fārābī does make some mistakes in his cross-linguistic 
comparison; he is generally thought not to know much about some of the 
languages that he discusses, like Greek and Sogdian. 
Al-Fārābī also allows for an intermediate level of names, where the 
paronymous term, derived from the true name of the item in the categories, 
is used in place of it. So we might use ‘noble’ instead of ‘nobility’, even 
though ‘nobility’ names the quality whereas ‘noble’ names only the nobility 
present in an unnamed subject45. Aristotle does the same thing at Posterior 
Analytics 83a36-b12 –and gives himself ‘white’ and ‘grammatical’ as 
instances of items in the category of quality46. Abstract terms tend not to 
be used much in ordinary language or even in the dialogues of Plato. Still, 
analyzing precisely what is being said in statements about the noble and 
the grammatical becomes much easier in the technical language of the 
philosopher proper.
Following Fārābī, Avicenna notes the varieties of the forms of the 
maṣdar in Arabic too. He says that sometimes the maṣdar does not have a 
special expression but instead just uses an absolute name, as with ‘motion’ 
[taḥarruk]. So sometimes the maṣdar is the basic form grammatically; 
sometimes it is not. Avicenna says also: «Likewise the sense that the 
paronymous name signiﬁ es is the sense of the maṣdar»47. He seems here 
to identify the maṣdar with the abstract paronymous term. In that case, the 
concrete paronymous term as well as the verb would be derived from the 
maṣdar. For he says that a derived name has an indeﬁ nite or undetermined

subject48. This agrees with its being a compound, just as the grammatical is 
some subject having grammar.
Avicenna has further complaints about the logical adequacy of Arabic, 
though. One concerns the need for there being, at least implicitly, a subject 
for the verbal inﬁ nitive. A maṣdar like ‘being whitened’ assumes that there 
is something becoming white. But then the maṣdar is not something simple 
but rather composite. Here, if the maṣdar is taken as basic, «the Arabic 
language is a hindrance…»49. 
Again, Avicenna says, if maṣdars name real, simple things, why are 
there not maṣdars also for substances and not only for accidents? This last 
point perhaps concerns Avicenna’s philosophy more than Aristotle’s: while 
Aristotle denies that a substance has an abstract paronym, Avicenna needs 
one to talk about substantial quiddities in themselves, like humanity and 
horseness. 
Comparing Farsi and Arabic, Avicenna says that different languages 
take different structures as primary but this does not concern the 
logician although it can make translation difﬁ cult50. So he says that the 
maṣdar is derivative logically regardless of how it is thought to function 
grammatically51. For him, the absolute abstract name of the quiddity in 
itself seems to be basic: grammar, horseness, rationality.
Spurred on by grammatical differences between Greek and Arabic, 
Islamic philosophers and translators focused also on the best way to express 
certain syntactic structures in a technical language. I shall continue to use 
the example of the statement. 
Like the Greek commentators, those like Fārābī and Avicenna discuss 
the strange word order in Aristotle’s formulations of statements and 
consider how to express them in Arabic. As Arabic lends itself to such 
strange grammatical contortions about as easily as Greek, the Arabic 
translation of On Interpretation does not have this problem as much as an 
English translation does52. However Avicenna ﬁ nds problems with Arabic

verbs expressing the logical syntactic structure of the statement. If the verb 
precedes the subject noun in the sentence order, the verb itself may or 
may not express a complete statement. That depends on whether there is, 
or there is not, a subject noun following it. But then it becomes hard in 
Arabic to express Aristotle’s claim that a verb by itself does not make a 
statement. Again, unlike Greek, Arabic has no special verbal form for the 
present tense. 
Avicenna ﬁ nds Arabic to have greater difﬁ culty in expressing the 
logical structure of negative statements. Accordingly he spends some effort 
to determine which constructions in Arabic do and which do not express 
the logical forms of denials discussed by Aristotle53. Sometimes he ﬁ nds 
Arabic unable to express these forms clearly, in particular with universal 
denials54. Still the difﬁ culties do not look that great.
Matters come to a head over the copula. Expressing Aristotle’s 
doctrines about being presented a great challenge. The metaphysical 
doctrine of being could be expressed satisfactorily by using kuwn or wujūd. 
However the logical doctrine has the problem that Aristotle treats the 
copula as a separate element in the sentence. For instance Aristotle allows 
for the subject term, the copula, or the predicate term to be negated. But 
Arabic does not have an explicit word for the copula, the ‘is’ of predication, 
and has both nominal and verbal sentence forms. The verbal form has the 
copula combined with the verb. The nominal form has just a sequence 
of nouns, with a pronoun often inserted between subject and predicate or 
an initial particle like inna, which also might have a pronoun like ‘huwa’ 
inserted55. 
So Arabic has a big problem with the Greek copula. In seeking to 
render Aristotelian philosophy into Arabic, the translators had to ﬁ x 
on some word corresponding to ‘is’. They needed to have an explicit, 
tripartite structure of subject-copula-predicate. In Arabic neither a 
verbal nor a nominal sentence does that. Aristotle had already suggested 
parsing verbal sentences into ones with a tripartite structure: ‘Socrates

‘huwa’ in Arabic nominal sentences.

walks’ becomes ‘Socrates is walking’56. In this way the simple statement 
will always have the form ‘subject-copula-predicate’. For Aristotle’s 
logic the Arabic translators needed a sentence with such a tripartite 
structure. They followed Aristotle’s hint of reducing verbs like ‘walks’ 
to the structure copula-predicate. This eliminates the verbal sentence 
form in favor of the nominal. The translators settled on a nominal 
sentence form having mawjūd as its predicate with the main predicate 
being expressed in an accusative of respect, so as to get the form, ‘S (is) 
existent (as) a P’57. All this was not elegant or even colloquial Arabic. 
Yet, given the philosophical goal of expressing truths in whichever 
linguistic conventions displayed them accurately, this was hardly an 
issue. 
This translation might be thought to produce a change in logical 
doctrine. For it translates the copula ‘ejstin’ as ‘existent’. Then afﬁ rmative 
sentence forms would make an explicit existence claim. But, so I have 
suggested elsewhere, even if ordinary Greek does not do so, Aristotle 
has the doctrine too. So, perhaps inadvertently, the translation keeps to 
Aristotle’s original conception, of ‘is’ asserting existence. However al-
Fārābī does not have this conception, although Avicenna does. This shows 
that the Islamic philosophers were not trapped in their logical doctrines by 
grammar of their language.
Accordingly, al-Fārābī discusses how the Arabic language has a 
structure different from other (mostly Indo-European) languages58. 
It has no distinctive word serving as an «expression of existence» or 
copula. For in the (nominal) Arabic proposition, a deﬁ nite noun serving 
as subject is followed by an indeﬁ nite name (the predicate complement), 
56 Metaph. 1017a27-30; Int. 20a3-15.
57 Less frequently with the verbal sentence using kāna. Cf. Al-Fārābī’s 
Introductory Sections, Ed. and transl. by D. M. DUNLOP, 272, 2-6, transl. p. 280: «These 
and what stands in their place are called existential vocables since they are used to 
signify the existence of a thing in relation to another and to connect the predicate with 
the subject of predication, as when we say Zaid exists (ujadu) going away’, when he 
is (kāna) going away. These existential vocables are employed as connectives when 
the predicate and the subject of predication are both names we wish to signify the 
three tensest as when we say Zaid was (kāna) eloquent, Zaid will be eloquent’, Zaid 
is eloquence».

as in «the man just». Al-Fārābī says that this holds both for the Arabic 
people and for the Arabic grammarians59. He goes on to say that in 
Arabic (nominal) denials would then be expressed as «the man not 
just» and «Zayd not walking». He points out that in the other languages 
such statements would be the metathetic afﬁ rmation, ‘man is not-just’ 
and ‘Zayd is not-walking’, as Aristotle says in On Interpretation60. 
Al-Fārābī notes how different languages –Arabic, Persian, Syriac, 
Greek, and Soghdian– have copulae in different grammatical types of 
statements, mostly the nominal and verbal ones61. He goes on also to 
discuss the verbal proposition having a verb with a pronominal subject 
afﬁ xed to it62.
Al-Fārābī again is distinguishing the technical language from ordinary 
language63. His technical word for the copula, mawjūd, he says, has been 
transferred from common usage of the people where it means ‘found’64. 
Unlike Greek, Arabic does not have a special word for the copula and so 
does not reveal clearly the logical structure of statements: 
Ever since its imposition there was not in Arabic an expression 
substituting for the hasta in Farsi and for the estin in Greek, 
and for the like in the rest of the languages. This [expression] is 
necessarily needed in the theoretical sciences and in the logical art. 
From the beginning when philosophy had been transferred to the 
Arabs, the philosophers –who discourse in Arabic, and who make 
their interpretations from concepts in philosophy and in logic with 
the language of the Arabs, and who do not ﬁ nd, in the language of 
the Arabs ever since it was imposed an expression by which they

At p. 37 (ed. KUTSCH – MARROW, pp. 46,9-20) he takes ‘Zaydun mawjūdun ̔ādilan’ 
as a proper sentence –which it is not in normal Arabic; cf. ZIMMERMANN, Al-Fārābī’s 
Commentary and Short Treatise, pp. XLIV-V; likewise for the negative forms proposed 
by Al-Fārābī–, p. 98, n. 2. Cf. Aristotle, Int. 10; An. Pr. 51b33-4; 52a24-6.

63 Thus Al-Fārābī, al-Ḥ urūf, § 81, ed. MAHDI, p. 115,13-14, distinguishes the use 
in the theoretical sciences from the common use.

translated the passages where estin is used in Greek, and the hasta in 
Farsi– made a substitute for those expressions in the passages where 
the rest of the peoples use them65.
The point here is that Al-Fārābī is ﬁ rst distinguishing what is true from 
what is stated easily in Arabic. The idea is that in this case the grammar of 
Arabic is less transparent than the ideal, mental language, and that Persian 
or Greek comes closer to that ideal. Likewise, he says, the common people 
speak (in Arabic) of the ‘non-existent’ inaccurately and ﬁ guratively, saying 
it is ‘wind’ and ‘dust’66. Moreover, he says, ordinary Arabic confuses the 
existent in potency with the existent in act67.
Al-Fārābī goes on to discuss the use of ‘huwa’ in constructing sentences 
in Arabic. He extends the grammatical use of the maṣdar  to signify what is 
logically although not necessarily grammatical the base form from which 
paronymous inﬂ ections are made. So too, in discussing paronymy, he takes 
‘humanity’ and ‘manhood’ as maṣdar  for ‘man’. When he makes up names 
for items in the categories, their essences and paronyms, he is clear that he 
is extending the notion of the maṣdar  analogously68. So too then here. For 
here he goes so far in rejecting the natural forms of Arabic for the copula 
so as to make ‘huwīya’ the maṣdar  for huwa69.
More than Al-Fārābī, Avicenna insists upon mawjūd making an 
assertion of existence70. He agrees with Al-Fārābī that Greek is better than 
Arabic in displaying the logical structure of the tripartite proposition (of 
form ‘S is P’)71. He goes on to discuss Farsi and three different ways of 
expressing the copula in Arabic72. 
Avicenna uses mawjūd in the late Greek sense of huparxis where its 
appearance in predicate position always makes an assertion of reality, a 
predication of existence. Thus for him a statement de tertio adiacente, like 
‘Zayd is just’, has two predicates: of ‘existent’ and of ‘just’. Avicenna is 
explicit about these truth conditions: ‘Zayd is just’ asserts both that Zayd

361
exists and that ‘just’ belongs to Zayd73. So a simple afﬁ rmation of tertium 
adiacens requires two causes of truth: existing and having the additional 
predicate stated. A simple denial then has two ways of being true: deny 
either the existence claim or the further attribution. Avicenna understands 
this and gives disjunctive truth conditions: «Zayd does not exist (as) just’ 
–is true in all cases but one. So it is true when he is non-existent, and 
tyrannical, and mixed, both in potency, and not in potency, and it is false 
when he is just»74.
Thus those like al-Fārābī and Avicenna were aware of the differences 
between Arabic and other languages like Greek and Farsi in a sophisticated 
way. In this doctrine of paronymy we have an instance of Islamic 
philosophers distinguishing the objective truth of philosophy and the ideal 
technical language of logic from the conventions of a particular culture 
and the grammar of its language. In their analyses of the statement they 
were conscious of how different languages express them differently and 
wrestled with the issue how best to present the statement in an idealized 
technical language. They selected, deliberately and self-consciously, those 
grammatical structures that they judged best to reﬂ ect the realities. They 
do seem to have made mistakes, as Fārābī did with the copula. But their 
method looks sophisticated. 
III. An Artiﬁ cial Latin
The Latin West also received Aristotle’s corpus, at ﬁ rst the only 
partial vetus logica along with a few commentaries mostly by Boethius 
and grammars like the one by Priscian. The texts available themselves 
posed problems for understanding paronymy. Priscian says that a concrete 
derivative term like ‘grammaticus’ signiﬁ es a substance since it can have 
adjectival modiﬁ ers, as with ‘sapiens grammaticus’. Yet he also says that 
‘grammaticus’ is an adjective and signiﬁ es a quality75, the grammatical, that 
is, grammar (grammatica). In Categories 1 Aristotle says that two things 
are paronyms when one gets its name from the other, as the grammatical 
does from grammar, the abstract paronym. The medievals generally took 
73 Ibid. 84,6-7.
74 Ibid. 84,6-10.
75 Priscian 58.24; 55.6 in Grammatici Latini, Ed. by KEIL.

362 
ALLAN BÄCK
him to hold that, as each thing belongs to only one category, so too a term 
signifying such a thing can signify only one category76. Then ‘grammaticus’ 
could not signify both a substance and a quality as Priscian suggests. 
So then, do names of concrete and abstract paronyms signify the same 
thing? To what do concrete derivative terms refer? Do they signify a new 
type of entity, the concrete paronym, which is somehow at once substance 
and quality? Commenting on Categories 1, Boethius says that the concrete 
paronym participates in the abstract paronym77. This does not solve the 
question but only raises further ones: for instance, do names for these 
correlative abstract and concrete paronyms signify two different entities 
plus a further relation, say, of having? Or is the same thing just being 
described in different ways?
Working on such problems in his De Grammatico, Anselm more 
or less gets to Aristotle’s solution –despite not having such texts as 
Posterior Analytics I and Metaphysics VII.4-6. The concrete paronym 
is a complex of the abstract paronym being in an individual substance. 
Thus ‘the grammatical’ signiﬁ es a human being having grammar. Such 
derivative terms function at best as abbreviations: ‘white’ signiﬁ es ‘having 
whiteness’ and ‘grammatical’ ‘having grammar’78. Such terms can be 
discarded from the ideal, common mental language. It retains names for 
individual substances and abstract paronyms and their relation of ‘being 
in’ or ‘having’. 
This solution accounts for Anselm’s startling pronouncement, that 
‘grammaticus est grammatica’ [‘the grammatical is grammar’] is true 
strictly speaking79. As D. P. Henry puts it, ‘grammaticus’ signiﬁ es precisely 
grammatica but appellates or names man80. That is, ‘grammaticus’ signiﬁ es 
the quality grammar. It appellates or stands for things presently existing in 
re, namely, for the quality grammar, with the added feature of being in 
a presently existing subject. Still it just means grammar. A grammatical 
person is just one of the places where grammar is present. Anselm is 
helped to this conclusion by the common, endoxic habit, even in Aristotle, 
76 Cf. Anselm, De Grammatico, Trans. by D. P. HENRY, The De Grammatico of

of referring to items in accidental categories by derivative terms like ‘the 
grammatical’81. 
Still, to hold that grammaticus just is grammar violates the common 
way of speaking. Anselm recognizes this.
S[tudent]. Because anyone who understands the name «expert-in-
grammar» [grammaticus] knows that «expert-in-grammar» signiﬁ es 
man and expertise-in-grammar [grammatica]. And yet, if with this 
assurance I were to speak in public and to say
(i) (A) useful expertise is expert-in-grammar
or
(ii) This man has expert-in-grammar,
Then not only would the experts-in-grammar be furious but even 
the unlearned would jeer82. 
At the end of De Grammatico 16, the Teacher likewise ends up 
afﬁ rming that grammaticus is a quality, namely grammatica, in the sense 
allowed by Aristotle in the Categories. Like the Student, he is well aware 
that people do not speak in this way ordinarily. But he just does not care:
For if even the experts-in-grammar say one thing in accordance with 
the form of words and another thing in accordance with the nature 
of things, then it ought not to disquiet us that the dialecticians write 
in one way about words with respect to the fact that they signify, and 
in conversation [usu loquendi] use them in another way with respect 
to the fact that they are appellatives83.
In ordinary language ‘grammaticus’ signiﬁ es the substance having the 
quality of grammar. In the ideal language it signiﬁ es the quality grammar, 
or, more precisely its concrete paronym. As the Teacher goes on to say 
more technically, ‘grammaticus’ signiﬁ es the quality per se and the literate 
human being per aliud84.

ALLAN BÄCK
Peter King argues, against those like Henry, that, when Anselm 
writes «quo res ipsa usu loquendi appellatur», he does not mean «the 
customary usage». For Anselm has said that we normally do not mean 
the substance when we say, for example ‘the white’ in regards to a 
horse85. Yet often we do: ‘I’ll have the white’ when ordering wine; «The 
few, the proud, the Marines!». We are identifying substances via their 
accidental attributes. As we have seen, in a language like Greek or Latin 
it is even easier than in English to take adjectives substantively–and the 
Aristotelian tradition and Anselm did so. What Anselm says there is only 
that it is not customary usage to say ‘grammar is a grammarian’ or ‘a 
grammarian is grammar’.
Thus Anselm followed the orthodox Aristotelian line, of taking the 
abstract paronym to be basic and respectable in the ideal language. He 
too eliminates from it the concrete paronym, by parsing it away as an 
abbreviation for the compound, of the abstract paronym being in the subject, 
the individual substance. While a simple term, such as one signifying an 
abstract paronym, can signify only one category, a complex term, such as 
one signifying a concrete paronym, can signify more than one category, in 
different modes86. 
Still Anselm seems not to want to subscribe fully to constructing an ideal 
language, «[r]ather, Anselm wants to analyze and order the ambiguities of 
natural language while retaining it and its nuances»87. As Marilyn Adams 
says, «it is not part of Anselm’s goal to reform usage: that is already given, 
ﬁ xed centuries ago in the texts themselves»88. Still, Anselm seeks to clarify 
improper usage and develop skills for construing texts.
Later on, Ockham explicitly embraced a program of constructing a 
protocol language. He seems to seek to construct a conventional language 
directly reﬂ ecting the structure of the mental language, which in turn reﬂ ects,

and indeed comes from, the real order of the world89. Thus he contrasts 
what holds de virtute sermonis and secundum proprietatem sermonis from 
ordinary usage, even that in Scripture. In the latter way, Ockham says, 
Timothy I.6 may say that God has justice, but strictly speaking that claim is 
false; rather, as Anselm says in Monologion 16, God is justice90. Ockham 
has the mental language containing both abstract and concrete terms in 
the category of quality. The abstract terms, like ‘whiteness’, signify the 
qualities themselves. The concrete terms, like ‘white’, signify individual 
substances primarily and qualities secondarily, since, as Aristotle says, a 
paronym like the white is a complex, the substance having whiteness91. 
By keeping both terms in the mental language Ockham is implying 
that the concrete term cannot be parsed away as abbreviating the complex, 
the whiteness in the substance. Perhaps Ockham keeps both in order to 
explain the doctrine of the Eucharist92.
However, Ockham also admits a technical use of abstract terms 
common in philosophy but not in ordinary or Scriptural speech93. On this 
use, an abstract term is equivalent to a complex expression consisting of its 
concrete counterpart and a syncategorematic term, ‘qua’ or ‘necessarily’. 
Here it can be parsed away: 
For there are certain abstract nouns, or can be made up (ad placitum 
instituentium), which include equivalently some syncategorematic 
terms or some adverbial determinations, or something else, such 
that the abstract term in signifying is equivalent to a concrete or

another term taken with some syncategorematic term or some other 
expression or expressions... For if that abstract (noun) ‘humanity’ 
is equivalent in signifying to the whole, ‘a man insofar as he is a 
man’ or ‘a man in virtue of the fact that he is a man’, ‘a man runs’ 
would be true, and ‘humanity runs’ false, just as ‘a man insofar as 
he is a man runs’ is false. Similarly, if ‘humanity’ is equivalent to 
the whole, ‘a man by necessity’, so that the expres sion ‘humanity’ 
is substituted for the whole, ‘a man by necessity’, ‘humanity is 
a man’ would be false, just as ‘a man is a man by necessity’ is 
false, for no man is a man by necessity but only contingently, 
and in the same way ‘humanity is white’ would be false, just as 
‘a man is white by necessity’ is false. And in such a way it can 
be established, whenever it is wanted, that a concrete term and 
an abstract term do not signify distinct things nor sup pose for 
distinct things, and still the predication of one of the other is false 
without qualiﬁ cation, and what is predicated of one is not what is 
predicated of the other94.
Ockham is proposing that ‘S-ness is P’ be understood as ‘S qua S 
is P’ or as ‘S is P by necessity’. The ﬁ rst is a reduplicative proposition, 
while the second is a modal one. Ockham seems to favor the ﬁ rst proposal, 
namely to analyze propositions containing abstract terms reduplicatively. 
His reference to Avicenna bears this out95. For Avicenna uses ‘S qua S’ as 
equivalent to ‘S-ness’96. Ockham takes the explicit step, which is perhaps 
implicit in Avicenna, of reducing talk about S-ness to talk about S qua 
S. For him, ‘S qua S’, or ‘S per se’, taken reduplicatively, has the same 
reference as ‘S’. The reduplicative analysis turns out to be equivalent to 
the modal one, once the exponible reduplicative proposition is reduced 
to its truth conditions97. By citing the authority of Aristotle and Avicenna, 
94 Ockham, Summa Logicae I.8,8-32, pp. 29-30. J. WEINBERG, A Short History of 
Medieval Philosophy, Princeton University Press, Princeton 1967, p. 82, claims that 
Walter of Mortagne used qua formulations in giving a theory of universals. Ockham’s 
theory thus had Latin medieval antecedents.

96 Avicenna (Ibn Sina Latinus), Metaphysics, V.1. The connection of reduplication 
to a modality like necessity is strongly suggested by the tradition which characterizes a 
mode as determining, or commenting upon, the relation of the predicate to the subject, 
since a qua phrase does this too. Cf. Ammonius, In De Int. 214,25; 215,14-6.

Ockham hints that the mistake of his contemporaries was to reify abstract 
terms, which were originally used only as conceptual shorthand98. 
Ockham’s account has the advantage over Anselm’s of giving the 
concrete and the abstract predications different truth values on occasion. 
Thus ‘Socrates is whiteness’ would be false since ‘Socrates is necessarily 
white’ is false even though ‘Socrates is white’ is true. As with Anselm, 
Ockham might admit that ‘grammaticus est grammatica’ is true, strictly 
speaking, if it be true that the grammatical is necessarily grammatical 
or is grammatical insofar as it is grammatical. In one sense, where ‘the 
grammatical’ refers to a human being who happens to be grammatical, it is 
false. Yet, in another sense, where ‘the grammatical’ refers to a substance 
only so long as it is grammatical is might be thought true99– although, as 
Ockham says that ‘a man is necessarily a man’ is false, it is doubtful that 
he would agree.
It is not clear how far Ockham wants to use this method of reducing 
abstract to concrete terms. Avicenna means it to apply to all abstract terms, 
as for him these name quiddities in themselves, be they substantial like 
‘horseness’ or accidental like ‘whiteness’. But Ockham wants to keep 
both ‘whiteness’ and ‘white’, as well as the syncategorematic terms, in 
his mental language. But given this reduction the mental language would 
have redundancy. Does he hold then that the philosophical language differs 
from the mental language? Or is he just recognizing a philosophical use of 
abstract terms, but not the correct philosophical use? In that case, he would 
be introducing the reduction in order to eliminate the abstract «formalities» 
of those like Scotus.
Moreover, when discussing the category of quality, Ockham wants 
concrete and not abstract names for the categories and the items in them: 
98 E. A. MOODY, The Logic of Ockham, Russell & Russell, New York 1935, 
pp. 203-204: «What Ockham insists on, is that in such propositions we are not making 
a statement about an abstract form that is distinct from individuals, or, in the instance 
adduced, from the man called Socrates; all we are doing, says Ockham, is to afﬁ rm 
that something is true of Socrates which is also true of every man that exists, or of any 
man that existed in the past, or that might exist in the future, with the further indication 
that Socrates is a man».

ALLAN BÄCK
not quanditas but quando; not albedo but albus100. In his commentary on 
the Categories Ockham says that he won’t discuss at this point why the 
abstract name should be rejected101. That is, he is avoiding discussing the 
passage where Aristotle states that items in the category of quality are the 
abstract and not the concrete paronyms: «these, then…are qualities, while 
those called paronymously because of them or called in some other way 
from them are qualiﬁ ed [qualia]»102. 
However Ockham insists, perhaps with the hopes of making his own 
approach respectable in terms of the tradition, that he and Aristotle share 
the same view. Now Aristotle does hold that for a quality to exist it must be 
in an individual substance and not exist separately103. Nevertheless he holds 
that the item in that subject is the quality and not the quale. So Ockham 
departs from Aristotle’s treatment of paronymous terms. Perhaps they still 
reach the same metaphysical conclusion: only the concrete paronyms are 
in re; the abstract paronyms of quality do not exist by themselves but exist 
only in a subject. But even so… If Ockham wants both the abstract and 
the concrete term in the mental language why does he not address this 
issue? It is not surprising that his contemporaries thought that Ockham was 
heterodox in his treatment of the categories104. 
In practice Ockham proceeds to consider the equivalence of abstract 
and concrete terms on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes he holds them 
to be synonymous, other times not. The result depends upon whether

‘Socrates is whiteness (or: grammar)’ on similar grounds.

or not one is a different thing than the other (est alia res)105. If it turns 
out that quantities, relations and ﬁ gures are reduced to substances, then 
statements like ‘substance is quantity’, ‘substance is length’ and ‘quality 
is quantity’ would be true –and the terms would become synonymous so 
as to match the facts. Ockham thinks that for Aristotle and Averroes ‘man’ 
and ‘humanity’ are synonymous, even though he himself offers the general 
method of Avicenna to distinguish them106. He seems inclined to identify 
them himself, in all cases except for the Son of God. Here philosophical 
analysis has to make room for theological truth107.
For Ockham the protocol language has to ﬁ t the facts, both natural 
and theological. For them he seems willing to forsake his general logical 
project of reducing abstract terms to concrete terms. Surely this project 
would have had attractions for a nominalist and for Ockham’s razor. Yet 
the Incarnation requires different signiﬁ cations and referents for ‘man’ and 
‘humanity’; the Eucharist a real distinction of substances and qualities. 
Scientiﬁ c elegance has given way to requirements of revelation108. 
In general, the Latin medievals did not worry much about changing 
the syntactic structures of the language. To be sure, they spent a lot of effort 
making certain that how they talked matched up with (the theory about) 
how the world really is. But they did so more by eliminating certain ways 
of talking, say, the abstract paronym reduced to the concrete one, than by 
adding on new ways of talking –although, to be sure, Anselm might be 
thought to be doing this to some extent when he allows for ‘a grammarian 
is grammar’ to be well-formed and true.
I have found nothing comparable in scale to the introduction of new 
syntactic structures like the one for the copula into Arabic. What changes 
there are seem just to continue the doctrines already in Greek philosophy. 
Thus the Latin translation of On Interpretation by Boethius has a 
correspondingly strange word order for categorical propositions, which 
Boethius, following Ammonius, likewise reformulates109. There did appear 
105 Summa Logicae I.6.49-50; 58; 69.
106 Ibid. I.6.15-45.
107 Ibid. I.7.55-67; 148-9; I.8,41-2.

ALLAN BÄCK
some strange word orders, in order to make the scope of operators like 
‘not’ and ‘promise’ clear. But these doctrines once again already appear in 
Aristotle in summary form110. 
IV. General Observations
In moving from an ordinary to a technical language, the Latin 
medievals tended to focus more on the subtraction; the Islamic ones on 
the addition. Problems of translation pushed Islamic philosophers like 
al-Fārābī to invent far more new terms than their Latin counterparts. 
The varying differences of grammatical structures prompted the Islamic 
philosophers to more syntactic innovations than their Latin counterparts.
I admit that the Latin medievals invented some terms: ‘personalitas’ 
seems to be one. Yet most of their philosophical vocabulary seems to have 
been inherited from the Greeks and Muslims: even ‘reality’ and ‘ipseity’. 
Perhaps their method was more to change the meaning of the terms that 
they appropriated, as with ‘suppositio’.
The Latin medieval approach looks a lot like Quine’s method later on. If 
you are using an expression, you are committed, ontologically, to admitting 
as real that to which it refers and signiﬁ es unless you can parse it away111. 
Thus Anselm parses away the derivative term and banishes the concrete 
paronym from the ontology. For instance, strictly  the grammarian does not 
exist; rather a human being having grammar exists. Again, Ockham offers 
a way to parse away the absolute term and banish the abstract paronym, 
although he restricts the method due to extra-logical concerns. So we have 
here Quine’s parsing project. We have also his method of semantic ascent, 
of moving from the objects to the words purporting to refer to those objects. 
The ontological dispute becomes a logical one, about what language is 
required for talking adequately about the world.
What philosophical worth does this Aristotelian project of constructing 
an ideal language have? The project, after all, continues today among 
the ideal language philosophers like Frege and Russell. Philosophers are 
immersed in oceans of words; we can get lots of shipwrecks there. We have

Studia Logica, 36.4 (1977) 381-406, p. 381.

the pitfall of assuming that the way we talk «cuts reality up at the joints», 
as Plato had it. But not all substantive terms need refer to a distinct entity: 
this is the ‘Fido’-Fido fallacy having Berkeley as its progenitor, where 
every word is assume to have a unique referent. The world need not have 
the structure of substance and attribute, just because simple declarative 
sentences have a similar structure of subject and predicate. Perhaps the 
Aristotelians fell into this trap: even Aristotle’s own project of trying to 
render all deductive reasoning into syllogistic form looked hopeless from 
the start. 
Nevertheless, philosophers and scientists in the past were not that 
naïve as those like Wittgenstein and Richard Rorty have it: they recognized 
that some ways of talking mislead us. Certainly with Aristotle the program 
of constructing an ideal language was well in hand. It continued on in 
philosophy as well as in science. The right notation matters greatly: think 
of arithmetical science using Roman numerals as opposed to one using 
the so-called Arabic numerals. The truth makers of grammatically simple 
claims need not be simple at all; nor need they resemble their corresponding 
statements. Getting the right vocabulary, the right concepts, and the right 
syntax matters. Think of describing combustion in terms of phlogiston or 
in terms of oxidation, Feynman diagrams... 
We get a similar doctrine in Chinese thought. Confucius too stresses the 
importance of speaking correctly: the famous doctrine of the rectiﬁ cation 
of names. At times he goes so far as to insist that all problems can be solved 
with correct expression112. But this seems silly: don’t facts determine the 
truth?
This doctrine is not as implausible as it sounds. People argue about the 
morality of abortion. If we could describe accurately what an abortion is, 
the debate would cease. If, strictly speaking, an abortion is ‘removing an 
unwanted lump of tissue’, it is morally permissible; if it is ‘the removal of 
a human being from her life support’ it is murder. Surely though we have 
to know the facts in order to get at the right description. 
But how to get the right notation? By starting with how we talk, 
critiquing it, reﬁ ning it, and then augmenting it, with an effort to free 
ourselves from local customs. The Aristotelians have this method. We 
haven’t a better or a different one.

FORMAL ELEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE. 
SHERWOOD’S SYNCATEGOREMATA REVISITED
Introduction 
The main contribution that the Middle Ages made to the formal 
analysis of natural language came in the form of two crucial aspects of 
mediaeval logic, namely the theory of supposition and the treatment of syn-
categorematic words. The analysis of syncategorematic words is of 
particular relevance for historians of logic as well as of linguistics. There 
are three main reasons for this:
(1) Syncategorematic words brought about their own literary genre 
which appeared and became important in the 13th century.
(2) Syncategorematic words represented a ﬁ eld of advanced logic 
in which the theory of supposition and other subjects dealt with in 
introductions to logic were presupposed.
(3) Syncategorematic words have received little attention from 
modern researchers in comparison with the other main areas of mediaeval 
logic.
Among the extant treatises on syncategorematic words, William of 
Sherwood’s text is of particular interest. His contemporary Roger Bacon, 
in a frequently quoted remark, praised him as «wiser than Albert [the 
Great]»1, and, more recently, Klaus Jacobi conﬁ rmed this judgement 
by emphasizing that Sherwood performed his analyses more precisely

than any of his contemporaries2. Sherwood’s treatise, which seems to 
be preserved in only two manuscripts, was ﬁ rst published in a critical 
edition by Reginald O’Donnell in 1941. This edition was followed in 
1968 by the well-known English translation by Norman Kretzmann, 
which also contained additional critical and explanatory comments. 
Since then, the exploration of mediaeval logic in general and of tracts on 
syncategorematic words in particular has progressed considerably. Due to 
these circumstances and due to the fact that no German translation of any 
treatise on syncategorematic words had existed up to that point, we decided 
to take up William of Sherwood’s text again. The result of our research is 
a completely new edition of Sherwood’s Syncategoremata with a German 
translation and an analytical commentary3. 
In this paper, we will start by making some introductory remarks on 
the basic distinction between categoremata and syncategoremata, as well 
as on the literary genre of the tracts on syncategorematic words. This is 
followed by a brief overview of the structure and the content of William 
of Sherwood’s treatise. On this basis, we will conclude by presenting 
some exemplary passages from Sherwood’s text that are either easier to 
understand, or suggest a revised interpretation, when our editorial decisions 
and our translation are taken into account. A side issue of our paper is the 
distinction of formal and material elements of speech in relation to the 
mediaeval concept of syncategorematic words4. While this distinction is

not as easy to grasp as it might seem at ﬁ rst glance, it can nevertheless be 
helpful to get a better understanding of syncategoremata and vice versa.
Categoremata and Syncategoremata 
A suitable idea of what syncategorematic words actually are can 
best be based on an explanation of their counterparts, the categorematic 
words. Categoremata are usually described as words that have a context-
independent signiﬁ cation. From an Aristotelian point of view, words like 
«man» or «chair» evoke by themselves an image in the mind of a person 
who hears them5. They are signs of things. In order to be a sign of an object, 
categoremata do not need to be in a propositional (or any other kind of) 
context; the mere pronunciation and understanding of such words, classically 
regarded as the material elements of speech, disclose their signiﬁ cation. In 
contrast, syncategoremata –such as «every», «not», «if» and other words 
of this kind usually classiﬁ ed as formal elements of speech– obviously 
work in a different way. When they are heard in isolation, they do not 
evoke any image in the mind of the listener. They do not signify anything 
when expressed independently of any linguistic context. However, when 
they occur in a linguistic context, as for example in the proposition «Every 
man is running», syncategorematic words take on a signifying function 
that depends on their being combined with categorematic words or terms –
in contrast to totally non-signifying expressions, as for example in the case 
of an arbitrary sequence of syllables which does not have any signifying 
function. Considered semantically, syncategoremata have an intermediate 
role for which the term consigniﬁ catio is used. Consigniﬁ catio, however, 
does not represent a precise and uniﬁ ed conception in the tradition that 
is relevant here. Therefore, syncategoremata considered as consignifying 
signs are often described as words having an undetermined or indeﬁ nite 
signiﬁ cation, not an actual but rather a virtual signiﬁ cation, etc6. Apart

CHRISTOPH KANN, RAINA KIRCHHOFF
from the semantic characteristics outlined so far, categoremata and 
syncategoremata have also been distinguished by a syntactic criterion 
since the time of Aristotle: categorematic words can function per se as the 
subject or predicate in a proposition. A typical example is the proposition 
«A man is running» (homo currit). In Latin it consists of two categoremata, 
noun and verb. In contrast, syncategorematic words require combination 
with a suitable set of categorematic words in order to form a proposition.
The doctrine of syncategorematic words (and in a complementary 
form, also of categorematic words) is essentially a mediaeval enterprise. 
The basic concepts and core assumptions of the doctrine, however, can 
be traced back to Aristotelian and Platonic ideas, combined with the 
Augustinian concept of the sign7. The term syncategorema itself seems to 
originate from the late ancient grammar tradition; it appears for the ﬁ rst 
time in Priscian’s Institutiones grammaticae where, however, it is regarded 
as a genuinely logical term:
Partes igitur orationis sunt secundum dialecticos duae, nomen 
et verbum, quia hae solae etiam per se coniunctae plenam 
faciunt orationem, alias autem partes “syncategoremata”, hoc est 
consigniﬁ cantia, appellabant8.
Thus, according to Priscian, categorematic parts of speech are the noun 
and the verb, and syncategorematic parts are all other types of words, i.e. 
conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, interjections, etc. While in Priscian we 
already meet the two criteria for syncategorematic words presented above, 
namely the semantic and the syntactic one, in ancient times and in the early 
Middle Ages, the semantic view predominated. Words were considered in 
isolation and with a focus on their representational or signiﬁ cative function. 
Thus, syncategorematic words could only be regarded as imperfect or 
[213 sq.]. For an investigation of the different semantic approaches to the linguistic 
function of syncategoremata see R. KIRCHHOFF, Die Syncategoremata des Wilhelm von 
Sherwood, E. J. Brill, Leiden – Köln – New York 2008, pp. 137-163.

volume on the medieval syncategoremata tradition contain rich information about its 
ancient presuppositions.

deﬁ cient words. To become aware of their actual linguistic function 
required a reﬂ ection on their propositional embedding. This «contextual 
approach», as De Rijk called it9, became predominant some hundred years 
later, in about the middle of the 12th century, once the entire Aristotelian 
Organon had been translated into Latin. The analysis of fallacies became 
important for theological discussions at this time, and, as a consequence, 
Aristotle’s Sophistici Elenchi, among other works, received special 
attention. The theory of supposition and the analysis of syncategorematic 
terms increased, and both became important branches of mediaeval logic. In 
the syncategoremata treatises, however, we do not ﬁ nd a semantic analysis 
of the full range of conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs etc. as might be 
expected with regard to the Priscianian passage. Rather, the logicians of the 
12th century conﬁ ned their interest to those words that are most relevant for 
logical purposes and played an important role in the analysis of fallacies. 
In the exploration of such sophistici termini10, semantic aspects were no 
longer predominant. Instead, the authors clearly focussed their interest on 
the syntactical features of the syncategoremata, which were regarded as 
most important for the logical properties of propositions and the validity 
of inferences. Concerning the word omnis, for example, the interest in the 
question of signiﬁ cation vanished. Instead, the authors investigated how 
it actually works in a proposition like omnis homo currit. They aimed at 
clarifying the syntactical function of the syncategorema and its inﬂ uence 
on the involved categoremata (here homo and currit) –a precondition for 
the analysis of the truth-conditions of propositions and of the validity of 
inferences. The characteristic selection of syncategoremata and the typical 
analysis of syntactical aspects, i.e. their function or ofﬁ cium11 (in contrast 
to their signiﬁ catio), become evident in Sherwood’s work which, in itself, 
is representative for this shift from semantics to syntax and, at the same 
time, to what one might call formal features of language.

Syncategoremata tracts in the 13th century: content and structure 
Apart from Sherwood’s treatise, we know ﬁ ve further texts on 
syncategorematic words dating from the 13th century12. With respect to 
their structure and content, these can be roughly assigned to a Paris and an 
Oxford tradition as usually distinguished since De Rijk’s research13. The 
treatise which is probably the most recent of these tracts and which was 
apparently written by Robert Bacon between 1230 and 1240, reveals the 
closest afﬁ nities to Sherwood’s work. Further authors of syncategoremata 
treatises include Johannes Pagus, Peter of Spain, Nicholas of Paris and 
Henry of Ghent, the alleged author of the most recent known tract, which 
dates from the 1360s. Afterwards, this ﬂ ourishing investigation into 
syncategorematic words ceased. Apart from Walter Burley’s Tractatus 
syncategorematum, written between the end of the 13th and the beginning 
of the 14th century, we ﬁ nd similar analyses only as parts of broad-based 
compendia, such as the Summa logicae of William of Ockham.
In the ﬁ ve texts mentioned, more or less the same groups of words 
were investigated. The essential presuppositions and intentions of the 
tracts on syncategorematic words –especially concerning the role of 
syncategoremata in the treatments of fallacies– imply that the range of 
words which were focussed on in the 13th century differed from those 
words which had ranked among syncategorematic words earlier. While, for 
example, prepositions are only marginally considered, verbs like incipit/
desinit and differt or nouns like inﬁ nita, omnis or quisque were added 
because of their particular syntactical functions and the difﬁ culties which

arise in logical analysis due to those words. An expression like «begins 
to be white» (incipit esse albus), for example, can –according to some 
logicians of this time– be resolved into the phrase «is now white and has 
earlier not been white», while the correlating expression «ceases to be 
white» (desinit esse albus) can be resolved into the phrase «is now white 
and will afterwards not be white». Thus, the verbs incipit/desinit have the 
virtue of negation, which is an important feature of the propositions or 
inferences in which they occur14.
Thus, syncategorematic terms in this tradition can neither be identiﬁ ed 
with the so-called indeclinabilia or partes indeclinabiles15 nor with logical 
operators in the modern sense of the word –an attitude we sometimes 
encounter in recent research. By identifying them with logical operators, 
however, we would only refer to a subclass of the syncategorematic words 
actually considered; neither the verbs incipit and desinit, for example, nor a 
preposition like praeter would be included. Furthermore, we have to notice 
that in many cases one and the same word can be used as a syncategorema 
as well as a categorema. Sherwood makes this distinction between 
categorematic and syncategorematic uses, dependent on the relevant 
propositional context, for the words omnis, totus, inﬁ nita, qualislibet, solus, 
tantum, est, necessario and incipit/desinit. For instance, in the proposition 
omnis homo currit the word omnis is used as a syncategorema, while in 
mundus est omne it occurs as a categorema16. Furthermore, the word est 
is considered in all syncategoremata treatises, independent of whether the 
author regards it as a syncategorematic word or not. This question has been 
intensively discussed by Sherwood and his contemporaries –a dispute in 
which he himself represents the denying part. In some treatises, est was

analysed within the context of composition and division, i.e. the afﬁ rming 
or negating combination of subject and predicate within a proposition. 
One reason for this might be that Aristotle had already noticed its special 
semantic nature. Thus, the investigation of the word est with regard to its 
syncategorematic use has a considerable tradition.
Thus, identifying the syncategorematic words investigated in 
our tracts with the formal elements of speech is not as trivial as often 
assumed. The modern dichotomy of material and formal elements of 
speech seems to ﬁ t with the mediaeval dichotomy of categoremata 
and syncategoremata only in a tentative manner. A related issue to be 
recognized here is that mediaeval logicians conﬁ ned their interest to 
natural language; they aimed neither to transform expressions of natural 
language in any delimited logical language nor to rigidly dissociate 
formal and material elements17.
In addition to content, i.e. the range of words investigated as 
syncategoremata, the structure of the ﬁ ve relevant treatises also reveals 
close similarities. Usually, ﬁ rst a short introduction is given, in which the 
reader is informed about the general distinction between categorematic and 
syncategorematic words and the etymology of the term syncategorema. 
Then the syncategorematic words considered in the tract are successively 
analysed.
Considering the inner structure of the chapters of a treatise –in other 
words, the passages that are dedicated to the single syncategorematic 
words– we ﬁ nd the following general pattern:
(1) In a ﬁ rst introductory step, information about the signiﬁ cation of 
the investigated syncategorema is given.
(2) Secondly, the author presents some main characteristics of the 
word in question: for example, an analysis of different uses, in particular 
the distinction between syncategorematic and categorematic uses of the 
word, or general information concerning its function.
(3) Thirdly, the author gives examples, usually sophismata, by means 
of which the syncategorematic uses of the word as well as rules determining 
17 Nevertheless, mediaeval logic should not be regarded as a mere fragmentary 
anticipation of putative superior successors but rather as an enterprise of its own 
merits and advantages; cf. KIRCHHOFF, Die Syncategoremata, pp. 7 sq., and G. KLIMA, 
«Approaching Natural Language via Mediaeval Logic», in J. BERNARD – J. KELEMEN 
(eds.), Zeichen, Denken, Praxis, Wien 1990, pp. 249-267.

its logical function can be illustrated. In this context, a detailed analysis 
follows, especially of ambiguities resulting from formal features –as there 
is multiple quantiﬁ cation– or from the shift of the scope of quantiﬁ ers or 
negations occurring in a proposition18.
This outline indicates that at least two traditions meet here: the two 
more theoretical aspects (i.e. semantics, different uses and function), which 
regard the syncategorematic words in isolation from any propositional 
context, point to the ancient roots. The third aspect (i.e. analysis of 
sophismata), however, which makes up the core of each chapter, is clearly 
the result of the second tradition, which arose from the analysis of fallacies 
and which is of a more practical kind. Here a syncategorematic word is 
only considered inasmuch as it is part of a proposition and it is analysed 
with regard to its ability to change the truth-conditions of this proposition 
or the validity of inferences drawn from it. While the ﬁ rst aspect is 
chieﬂ y concerned with semantic issues and the second aspect leads to the 
distinction of what we can call material and formal features of language, 
it is mainly the third aspect that essentially contributes to formal features 
aimed at determining the truth-conditions of propositions.
William of Sherwood’s Syncategoremata
Sherwood considers 24 syncategoremata. Each of them is examined 
in a more or less detailed way in a separate chapter. While the amount 
of words regarded by Sherwood can be seen as representative of tracts 
on syncategorematic words, the sequence of their examination is much 
more unique and reveals a certain level of systematisation. Sherwood 
initially considers the distributive signs or rather begins by examining 
those which are combined with the (logical) subject of a proposition and 
relate the subject to the predicate. Within this group, he starts with the 
afﬁ rmative ones: omnis, totum, inﬁ nita, qualislibet, uterque and numeral 
words (decem); subsequently, the negative signs nullus, nihil and neutrum 
are considered. Following the distributive signs, exceptive and exclusive 
words are investigated: praeter, solus and tantum. In the middle part of 
the treatise, several syncategorematic words that are related directly to the 
composition or division of the subject and the predicate are analysed: the 
18 For this general pattern cf. KIRCHHOFF, Die Syncategoremata, pp. 134-137.

382 
CHRISTOPH KANN, RAINA KIRCHHOFF
words est and non and the modal adverbs necessario and contingenter. 
This part is followed by the treatment of words which are connected 
grammatically to the predicate of a proposition, such as the auxiliary 
verbs incipit and desinit. At the end of his text, Sherwood analyses the 
connectors si, nisi, quin, et, vel, an, ne and sive, which relate propositions 
to each other19. 
Editorial criticism and improvement
Besides the commentaries by Jacobi (1980) and Kirchhoff (2008), 
the most important works dealing with Sherwood’s treatise are the ﬁ rst 
edition by O’Donnell (1941) and the ﬁ rst translation with commentary 
by Kretzmann (1968). The O’Donnell edition is based on the only two 
known manuscripts (Oxford and Paris)20. However, it seemed to us that this 
edition is improvable in many aspects –concerning various transcriptional 
deﬁ ciencies and partly distorting omissions, but also problematic 
punctuation and division into paragraphs. Kretzmann’s English translation, 
which is based on O’Donnell’s edition, establishes a new setting of 
chapters and paragraphs. The detailed commentary gives systematic and 
historical comments and also makes some suggestions for corrections of 
the Latin text. Nevertheless, translation and commentary remain seriously 
improvable –quite often due to their dependency on O’Donnell’s edition21. 
In the detailed commentary of our new edition we comment on problems of 
the transcription, the translation, the organization of the text, Kretzmann’s 
commentary and on more recent research. In order to give an idea of our

n. 107, 114, 115; p. 458, n. 127, etc. Even the order of chapters and paragraphs remains 
controversial in a few cases; cf. N. KRETZMANN, William of Sherwood’s Treatise on 
Syncategorematic Words, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1968, p. 43, n.

editorial work, we will present instances of transcription improvements, of 
corrections of text and punctuation, as well as of the few conjectures we 
made. Finally, we will give an example of revised translation (independent 
of editorial puzzles).
Example 1: transcriptional deﬁ ciencies
First of all, we want to focus on readings that are at variance with 
the manuscripts. Many of these mistakes are more or less evident, as for 
example O’Donnell’s reading Ly contra etiam poterat, which obscures 
the meaning as well as the syntactical structure and must be corrected 
into Ly contra etiam peccat22. But there are also other instances that 
might cause doctrinal misunderstanding. In the passages concerned with 
the categorical proposition, O’Donnell repeatedly reads categorematica 
instead of categorica23. There are also less obvious mistakes, which require 
a few more introductory remarks. We conﬁ ne ourselves to a subtle case of 
particular interest, quoted here in O’Donnell’s version:
Sed videtur quod omnis conjunctio habeat conjungere inter orationes, 
quia proponit prius quamdam orationem in qua sunt omnes partes 
orationis praeter conjunctionem et dicit quod, si conjunctio addatur, 
necesse est aliam orationem sequi. Sed intellige quod Priscianus 
intelligit hoc modo […]24. 
At this point we stumble across the missing subject of proponit and 
the lacking reference of prius. Kretzmann translates the quia sentence as 
follows: «for one ﬁ rst propounds a certain expression»25. As a look into the 
manuscripts conﬁ rms, however, the abbreviation O’Donnell transcribes as 
prius ought to be read as Priscianus so that the passage becomes: […] quia 
proponit Priscianus quamdam orationem […]26. The name Priscianus, 
which also occurs in the subsequent sentence of the text, is abbreviated 
22 R. O’DONNELL, «Syncategoremata magistri Guillelmi di Shireswode», Me-
diaeval Studies 3 (1941) 58; KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, 
p. 50.1.

26 KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 182.21.

384 
CHRISTOPH KANN, RAINA KIRCHHOFF
in a similar manner here and elsewhere, and Priscian actually presents 
a proposition of the mentioned type (namely in qua sunt omnes partes 
[…]) in his Institutiones grammaticae27. Thus, in our revised reading 
the problem of prius vanishes, and the puzzle of the missing subject of 
proponit is solved.
Example 2: omission of words or phrases
O’Donnell’s text repeatedly omits single words, phrases or even 
sentences. Sometimes the result is only a little odd, but can nevertheless be 
understood, while in other cases the sense is obscured –for example when 
a logically relevant word like non28, a subordinate clause, an apposition 
or a conclusion29 is left out. As an example of a missing word or phrase 
of doctrinal relevance we chose a passage in which Sherwood, discussing 
the copula est as a tertium adiacens in the proposition Socrates est homo, 
explains the concept of the propositio conversa. For example, «Some 
animals are men» and «every man is an animal» are converse propositions. 
In O’Donnell’s edition we read:
Sed videtur adhuc quod, quando “est” est tertium adiacens, non sit 
ibi praedicatum, sed solum compositio ut hic: homo est animal, 
quia in eius conversa ly animal subicitur tantum. Quia ergo converti 
sit facere de subjecto praedicatum, debemus dicere quod omnes 
propositiones haberent idem praedicatum, quia, si praedicetur 
alterum verbum, convenit resolvere ipsum in suum participium et in 
hoc verbum “est”, ut homo currit, hoc est, homo est currens […]30.
Kretzmann translates as follows: 
But still it seems that when “is” is a third ingredient (tertium 
adjacens) it is not the predicate but rather the composition alone, as 
27 Cf. Priscian, Institutiones grammaticae XVII, 12. Priscian here names the 
proposition idem homo lapsus heu hodie concidit as an example for an oratio, which 
includes all parts of speech except the conjunction: «en omnes insunt partes orationis 
absque coniunctione, quae si addatur, aliam orationem exigit.»

cf. also p. 263, n. 275.
29 Cf. ibid., p. 229, n. 62; p. 255, n. 223; p. 257, n. 243; p. 266, n. 293; p. 268, n. 
304; p. 276, n. 346; p. 285, n. 384; p. 324, n. 539.
30 O’DONNELL, «Syncategoremata», p. 71.

 
FORMAL ELEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE 
385
in “a man is an animal”, since in the converse of it only “animal” is 
the subject. Therefore, since to be converted is to make a predicate 
of a subject, we ought to say that all propositions have the same 
predicate, for if another verb [than “is”] is predicated it is permissible 
to resolve it into its participle and the verb “is”. For example, “a 
man runs” –i.e., “a man is running” […]31.
The argumentation here remains entirely incomprehensible: the quia-
ergo sentence is not a conclusion of the preceding phrase nor can the fact 
that converti est facere de subiecto praedicatum be regarded as arguing 
in favour of what follows. A look into the manuscripts conﬁ rms that 
some additional words, inserted here in square brackets, are missing in 
O’Donnell’s text, so that the whole passage can be completed as follows:
Quia ergo converti sit facere de subiecto praedicatum, debemus 
dicere, quod [ly animal praedicabitur. Item sic esset dicere, quod] 
omnes propositiones haberent idem praedicatum, quia, si praedicetur 
alterum verbum, convenit resol vere ipsum in suum participium et in 
hoc verbum “est” […]32.
Now, having integrated the missing words, the point becomes entirely 
clear: The quia ergo sentence is supplemented and completed; the item sic-
phrase indicates the beginning of another argument.
Example 3: problem of punctuation
Punctuation sometimes has serious effects on the interpretation. In 
many cases, where we had to modify O’Donnell’s punctuation, the text 
became more perspicuous, and in several cases a passage even changed 
its meaning completely33. An example of the importance of precise 
punctuation as relevant for an adequate understanding of the text can be 
taken from the chapter concerning the word sive. Here the sophisma «Be 
it a man or something white, it is an animal» (sive homo sive album sit,

leading to misinterpretation in Kretzmann and Jacobi cf. KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William 
of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 332, n. 581; for another example of mistaken 
punctuation leading to misinterpretation in Kretzmann cf. ibid., p. 299, n. 436.

CHRISTOPH KANN, RAINA KIRCHHOFF
animal est) is analysed. It is presupposed (positum), that only a white ass 
exists and no other animal. In the proof, the proposition is understood in 
such a way that the words ‘man’ and ‘white’ refer to concrete individual 
beings. And it is stated that, with regard to the positum, ‘white’ and ‘ass’ 
are the same (album idem est cum asino), so that the proposition «Be it a 
man or something white, it is an animal» is true. According to Sherwood, 
however, the proposition would only be true if the concept «man» and 
the concept «white» generally implied the attribute «animal». But since 
this is not the case, the proposition is false. So –following Sherwood– an 
adequate understanding of a proposition of this type has to be different 
from that suggested in the probatio. The supposita of the two terms ‘man’ 
and ‘white’ are considered only to the extent that they participate in the 
universal nature of humanity (humanitas) or whiteness (albedo), and this is 
what Sherwood actually does. In detail, Sherwood analyses the sophisma 
in the following manner: 
Dicendum quod prima34 falsa […], quia licet album nunc sit idem in 
re cum ly asinus, tamen respectu conditionis est divisim; non enim 
solum respicitur pro eo quod nunc est album, sed indifferenter pro 
quocumque. Secundum hanc regulam termini positi sub conditione 
non stant determinate, sed simpliciter35.
Kretzmann’s translation:
It must be said that the ﬁ rst [proposition] is false […], since although 
“white thing” is in this case the same as “ass” as regards the 
[corresponding] real thing, nevertheless it is so divisively in respect 
of the condition, for [the condition] has to do (respicitur) not only 
with what is white in this case but indifferently with anything [that 
is white]. In accordance with the rule regarding a term placed under 
a condition [the term “a white thing”] stands not determinately but 
simply36.
Actually, the ﬁ rst point to be considered here is not a problem of 
punctuation but of transcription: the phrase album […] tamen respectu 
34 Prima refers to the sophisma Sive homo sive album sit, animal est that occurs 
at the beginning of the paragraph.
35 O’DONNELL, «Syncategoremata», p. 93.
36 KRETZMANN, William of Sherwood’s Treatise, p. 158.

 
FORMAL ELEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE 
387
conditionis est divisim makes sense neither in the Latin text nor in 
Kretzmann’s translation. We assume that we should read diversum 
instead of divisim, so that the sense becomes: the term album is the same 
(idem) in re as asinus, but something different (diversum) regarding the 
condition37. Having corrected this type of mistake, however, the point still 
remains unclear. Regarding the last two sentences, beginning with non 
enim, the reader wonders what could be meant by the phrase secundum 
hanc regulam. In fact, no rule occurs in the preceding text. The problem 
vanishes, however, if we modify punctuation, i.e. omit the full stop behind 
quocumque, which misleadingly interrupts the sentence, and insert a colon 
behind secundum hanc regulam. This phrase then points to what follows, 
and the crucial passage can be read in this way:
Non enim solum respicitur pro eo, quod nunc est album, sed 
indifferenter pro quocumque secundum hanc regulam: Termini 
positi sub conditione non stant determinate, sed simpliciter38.
Nicholas of Paris, in his tract on syncategorematic words, explicitly 
mentioned such a rule39, a fact that conﬁ rms our correction.
Example 4: conjectural emendation
Another point exempliﬁ es the few conjectures we made in the Latin 
text. The relevant passage is part of the analysis of the sophisma «every 
man necessarily is an animal» (omnis homo de necessitate est animal). 
Four cases are distinguished with regard to different functions and 
constellations of the two syncategoremata involved, i.e. the quantiﬁ er 
37 KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 212.11. 
Additionally, it should be noted that album and asinus obtain the same semantic level 
what is obscured by O’Donnell’s text; cf. ibid., p. 212.10.

quod ipsum est, est verum quod animal est.»

omnis and the modal operator necessario. The ﬁ rst differentiation concerns 
the word omnis, which can divide (or distribute) with respect to speciﬁ c 
parts or to numerical parts. If, for instance, in the proposition «every man 
is running» (omnis homo currit) the word omnis divides for speciﬁ c parts, 
homo refers only to actually existing men. In contrast, if omnis divides for 
numerical parts, homo refers to all possibly existing men40. The second 
differentiation concerns the scope of the two syncategoremata. The ﬁ rst 
syncategorema can include the second one, and vice versa. Accordingly, 
we get the following four cases:
(1) omnis understood as dividing for numerical parts
 
 (1a) The quantiﬁ er includes the modal operator: «Of every 
existing man is true: he is necessarily an animal» => «Socrates 
necessarily is an animal»
 
 (1b) The modal operator includes the quantiﬁ er: «Necessarily is 
true: every existing man is an animal»
(2) omnis understood as dividing for speciﬁ c parts
 
 (2a) The quantiﬁ er includes the modal operator: «Of every 
habitually existing man is true: he necessarily is an animal» => 
«Socrates (as a habitual part of man) necessarily is an animal»
 
 (2b) The modal operator includes the quantiﬁ er: «Necessarily is 
true: every habitually existing man is an animal»
The crucial passage occurs at the end of the analysis:
Si autem li omnis dividat pro partibus secundum speciem et includat, 
sic est vera; et si includatur, similiter et signiﬁ cat primo modo quod 
haec sit necessaria: homo habitualiter in omni supposito suo est 
animal; secundo quod haec sit necessaria: homo habitualiter in 
Sorte est animal, et sic de aliis. Sed si ibi est, dicit esse habituale41.
First it has to be noticed, that in the penultimate sentence primo 
and secundo have to be exchanged. This means that the ﬁ rst paraphrase 
applies to the case in which the quantiﬁ er includes the modal operator, 
40 For the introduction of this differentiation cf. KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of 
Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 6

which is quite obvious42. The main difﬁ culty, however, occurs in the last 
sentence. Kretzmann translates: «But the “is” there indicates conditional 
being.43» This certainly ﬁ ts quite well with the text: in his treatment 
of the word est, Sherwood maintains that the distinction of two modes 
of dividing of omnis corresponds to two modes of signiﬁ cation of est. 
Therefore, in the proposition ‘every man is an animal’ (omnis homo est 
animal), for example, est signiﬁ es actual being if omnis divides with 
respect to numerical parts, but est signiﬁ es habitual being if omnis divides 
with respect to speciﬁ c parts44. However, in his commentary Kretzmann 
writes:
Something like this is probably what is intended here, but this does 
not literally translate the Latin, which in O’Donnell’s edition reads 
“Sed si ibi est”45.
The problem is that the well-ﬁ tting sentence we read in the translation 
simply is no translation of the Latin version, and a convincing suggestion 
for conjecture is missing. Kretzmann proceeds:
I ﬁ nd P difﬁ cult to decipher at this point (I have not seen O). It is not 
at all clear that the ﬁ rst two words are to be read as “Sed si”.
This is a remark we could approve of. Kretzmann further explains that
it seems at least possible to read them as “Sortes etsi?” in which 
case the sentence might be translated as “Although [the discrete 
name] “Socrates” occurs there, it indicates conditional being”46.
But this is still not convincing, because, amongst other reasons, 
Sherwood does not contrast conditional being and individuals (represented 
by concrete names) anywhere in the Syncategoremata. Furthermore, in the 
ﬁ rst chapter of his treatise, Sherwood mentions that if omnis divides with 
respect to speciﬁ c parts in the proposition omnis homo currit, then the word

homo refers to speciﬁ c parts, i.e. for the habitually existing Socrates, Plato 
etc., and not for the actually existing ones. Thus, we should not assume 
that several chapters later Sherwood regards it as a problem that a proper 
name refers to a habitually existing thing. Furthermore, even without this 
reference to the ﬁ rst chapter, the proposition is not in line with the context 
of the analysis. Thus, the passage remains obscure.
In our approach to this problem, we ﬁ rstly do not agree with the 
reading of the ﬁ rst abbreviation as Sortes. And secondly our suggestion of 
improvement is to change the si in the text into similiter. The meaning of 
the revised proposition then becomes: «But similarly, there, “is” signiﬁ es 
habitual being» (Sed similiter ibi “est” dicit esse habituale) –a reading 
which is completely in line with the context and with Sherwood’s intention 
alike47.
Example 5: puzzle of translation
Up to here, we have presented mistakes in O’Donnell’s edition that 
clearly led to problems in Kretzmann’s translation. But there are also 
several cases in which we regard this translation improvable –regardless 
of underlying transcriptional or editorial corrections. One passage of this 
kind occurs in the analysis of the sophism omnis homo et alius homo sunt. 
Sherwood offers two ways of understanding this proposition, which can be 
paraphrased as follows:
(a) For every man holds: (he exists) and (another man exists).
 (b) (Every man exists) and (someone, who differs from every man, 
exists)48.
Sherwood’s analysis starts as follows: 
Dicendum, quod distributio potest includere copulationem et 
relationem huius dictionis “alius”, et sic probatur, et sic vera est; vel 
e converso, et sic improbatur, et sic falsa est49.
47 KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 128.18; cf. 
p. 291 sq., n. 414.

49 KANN – KIRCHHOFF, William of Sherwood. Syncategoremata, p. 14.19-22.

 
FORMAL ELEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE

Kretzmann translates:
It must be said that either [a] the distribution can include the 
copulation and relation of the word “another”, in which case it is 
proved and true; or [b] vice versa, in which case it is not proved 
and false50.
In his commentary he writes:
Although “copulation” is a technical term in the doctrine of the 
properties of terms […], it seems most likely that “copulation” and 
“relation” here designates the function of “another” as “distribution” 
designates the function of “every”51.
Since the word alius is a relativum, it evidently designates a relatio. 
But it does not make good sense to assume that it also designates a copulatio 
as its function –actually not a single author of a syncategoremata tract 
associates such a (syncategorematic) function with alius. The problem 
vanishes, however, if we interpret copulatio in the sense of the proper 
function of the copulative conjunction et. In fact, this copulative function 
is one of the two chief meanings of copulatio (besides that of a property of 
a term). As our paraphrase makes clear, in case (a) the distribution includes 
the copulation (that is: the word et or, even better, its logical power), 
while in case (b) the copulation includes the distribution. Therefore, the 
translation should be modiﬁ ed into 
«It must be said that either [a] the distribution can include the 
copulation (of the word ‘and’) and (can also include) the relation of 
the word ‘another’ […]» 
–a reading that simply separates copulationem from huius dictionis “alius”.
Concluding remarks
Our short survey of the syncategoremata tradition and of our editorial 
enterprise should give an idea of how the 13th century treatment of 
50 KRETZMANN, William of Sherwood’s Treatise, p. 29.

syncategorematic words was organized, how it can be traced back to earlier 
ideas or theories, and how it contributed to the formal analysis of language. 
Concerning the relationship of syncategorematic words and formal 
elements of speech, we had to point out that the distinction of material 
and formal elements coincides with the distinction of categoremata and 
syncategoremata only in a tentative manner. Nevertheless, the distinction 
of material and formal elements can help to clarify the meaning and the 
functions of these words within the modern framework of semantics and 
syntax, and to analyse the special features of the quite different types of 
words that have been subsumed under the notion of syncategoremata. 
An outstanding example of the relevant mediaeval tradition and the 
related issues is the treatise by William of Sherwood. In focussing on 
Sherwood’s text, its structure and contents, we intended to shed some light 
on the particular difﬁ culties regarding its interpretation that are caused 
by shortcomings in the hitherto existing research which motivated the 
project to produce a new edition, translation and commentary. Though 
being seriously indebted to the pioneering works of O’Donnell and 
Kretzmann, we nevertheless hope to have demonstrated the necessity of 
a revised version. Generally speaking, we have tried to make clear the 
extent to which the syncategoremata tradition in general and Sherwood’s 
text in particular offer a promising ﬁ eld of research when it comes to the 
dichotomy of matter and form in human language, both from a historical 
and a systematic point of view.

OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS, SYNONYMY AND 
MENTAL LANGUAGE
1. Mental language and the role of nominal deﬁ nitions
It is often said –and indeed I have said it myself on occasions– that 
the primary object of logic for Ockham is mental language. Yet this is 
only a way of speaking. Mental language was not literally given as an 
object of inquiry for Ockham1. Logic in his view is intended to provide 
tools for discriminating truth from falsehood in propositions formulated 
in some natural language like Latin or Greek. It is expected, saliently, to 
help develop a good aptitude for responding sharply to arguments and for 
distinguishing between proper and improper modes of speech, «which is 
absolutely necessary», Ockham says «for all those who study the sayings 
of others»2. Strictly speaking, Ockham’s logical investigations primarily 
have to do with natural language. As a logician, he strives to deal with such 
linguistic phenomena as predication, semantic composition, ambiguity, 
general terms, tensed verbs, adverbs, prepositions, and… synonymy 
(among others).
It is in order to account for such phenomena –and to avoid being 
misled by them– that Ockham introduced a theoretical hypothesis about 
human cognition: the mental language hypothesis. And he put forward a 
number of empirical claims about how this mental language is structured,

how its basic components enter the mind, how thoughts are produced, 
how they are assented to and so on, logic as a science being developed 
by him as a semantical theory for this hypothesized mental language. 
The connection with natural languages is secured in this framework by 
two sorts of devices. First, there is the notion of linguistic imposition 
and subordination: spoken units are supposed to inherit the signiﬁ cation 
of the underlying mental units that they are conventionally associated 
with3. Second, such pragmatic phenomena as the requirements of brevity, 
elegance or grammatical congruence are supposed to account for structural 
discrepancies between spoken or written discourse and the hypothesized 
mental language4.
Nominal deﬁ nitions (deﬁ nitiones quid nominis), which will be my 
focus in this paper, have been seen by Paul Vincent Spade and several other 
commentators in the seventies and eighties as one of those pragmatical 
devices through which Ockham’s mental language was connected with 
natural languages (in the modern sense of the phrase)5. The idea thus 
attributed to Ockham was the following. A given human thinker can form 
a complex phrase in her internal mental language, and then strike a simple 
spoken word which she conventionally subordinates to that complex phrase. 
The complex mental phrase in such a case would be the genuine nominal 
deﬁ nition of this simple external word, and conversely the external word 
would be nothing but an abbreviation for the corresponding deﬁ nition. 
In this picture, the simple word and its deﬁ nition are taken to be entirely 
3 This theory of conventional subordination is much more far-reaching than is 
usually thought. Since subordination is supposed to be accomplished by the original 
impositor of a word rather than by its subsequent users, Ockham is led to a strong 
form of linguistic externalism. More on this in C. PANACCIO, Ockham on Concepts,

synonymous with each other, and this was taken to be what is standardly 
going on in nominal deﬁ nitions according to Ockham.
Since Ockham is very explicit that connotative terms all have 
nominal deﬁ nitions6, it saliently followed that simple connotative terms 
were relegated to conventional languages and that no simple connotative 
concept was to be admitted in mental language. As I have argued on 
various occasions, this consequence, however, runs head on against 
Ockham’s considered tenets about connotative terms and mental language. 
The fact is that he did acknowledge simple connotative concepts in his 
mental language, that he had good reasons for this, and that, as I have 
tried to show, he could do it without inconsistency7. The role of nominal 
deﬁ nitions in Ockham’s theory, therefore, must be reconsidered, as well 
as their connections with the corresponding simple connotative concepts. 
This is something I have dealt with in a previous book on Ockham8. My 
suggestion, roughly, is that nominal deﬁ nitions have an ontological role to 
play in Ockham’s approach: a nominal deﬁ nition unfolds the meaning of the 
deﬁ ned term by making it perspicuous what individual things are referred 
to by it either directly or connotatively. The term ‘white’, for example, can 
be deﬁ ned, say, as ‘a substance having a whiteness’, this nominal deﬁ nition 
making it perspicuous that ‘white’ directly signiﬁ es substances (because 
the term ‘substance’ occurs in recto –i.e. in the nominative case– within the 
deﬁ nition) and obliquely –or connotatively– refers to whitenesses (because 
the term ‘whiteness’ occurs in obliquo –i.e. as a grammatical complement– 
within the deﬁ nition).
The one point I wish to develop further in the present context is the 
matter of synonymy, which still seems to be controversial. I have argued 
in this regard for three interpretative thesis: (1) Ockham’s conception of 
nominal deﬁ nitions does not require them to be synonymous with their 
deﬁ nienda; (2) they usually cannot be synonymous with their deﬁ nienda; 
6 See SL I, 10, OPh I, 36: «Nomen autem connotativum est illud quod signiﬁ cat 
aliquid primario et aliquid secundario. Et tale nomen proprie habet deﬁ nitionem 
exprimentem quid nominis […]».

CLAUDE PANACCIO
and (3) Ockham explicitly acknowledges on at least one occasion that 
nominal deﬁ nitions and their deﬁ nienda are not always synonymous9. 
From a semantical point of view a connotative term for Ockham as I 
understand him is not a mere abbreviation for its nominal deﬁ nition. He 
does accept the possibility of abbreviations in conventional language 
admittedly10 –and surely such abbreviations, when they occur, are totally 
equivalent semantically with the corresponding abbreviated phrases–, 
but my contention is that this is not in general the situation we have with 
nominal deﬁ nitions. This claim having recently been challenged on the 
basis of detailed textual counterevidence11, I need to revisit the matter and 
this is what I aim to do in this paper.
The point is of some importance for a correct understanding of both 
what nominal deﬁ nitions are for Ockham and how mental language is 
supposed to work. The reason why Spade and others thought that no simple 
connotative concept is to be admitted in Ockham’s mental language is that 
they credited him with the following three theses:
(T1) All connotative terms have nominal deﬁ nitions;
(T2) There is no synonymy in mental language;
(T3) A nominal deﬁ nition is always synonymous with its deﬁ niendum.
From which it followed that simple connotative terms and their 
nominal deﬁ nitions could not coexist in Ockham’s mental language. Since 
there is no apparent reason to ban nominal deﬁ nitions from mental language 
(why after all couldn’t the mind assemble such complex phrases?), what 
had to go were the simple connotative concepts, and Ockham’s program, 
consequently, was understood as a (doomed) reductionist attempt to 
deﬁ ne all connotative concepts in terms of non-connotative (or absolute) 
ones along with syncategoremata. Now Ockham’s endorsement of T1 
is straightforward as we have seen12, but the other two theses are more 
doubtfully attributed to him. My main focus here will be on T3, which, I 
think, he rejected and for good reasons. But ﬁ rst I will say a word about T2.

OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
397
The ascription of T2 to Ockham rests upon his acceptance of the 
principle that «there is no plurality in the mind corresponding to a multitude 
of synonymous spoken names»13. Yet as Martin Tweedale has remarked 
some twenty years ago, Ockham’s formulation of this principle only 
excludes from mental language the synonymy of names (nomina)14. And 
names are normally simple terms. Ockham’s idea is that no two distinct 
simple mental concepts are synonymous with each other within any given 
mind. This leaves open the possibility that two complex mental phrases 
should turn out to be synonymous after all and –more relevantly for us– that 
a simple mental term and a complex mental phrase should turn out to be 
synonymous with each other. A correct understanding of Ockham’s theory 
of mental language requires, then, that we should be clear about what sort of 
synonymy, if any, is deemed to be possible in this mental language.
David Chalmers has directly addressed the point in his contribution to 
the Cambridge Companion to Ockham in 1999. Chalmers argued there that 
Ockham in the end is committed to accepting all three kinds of synonymy 
in mental language15: synonymy between distinct complex phrases, 
synonymy between simple terms and complex phrases, and even (despite 
Ockhamʼs own denial) synonymy between distinct simple terms. My own 
view is that Chalmers is right on all three counts although his argument 
for the latter kind of synonymy is unconvincing as it stands. Let me brieﬂ y 
review his reasoning in each kind of cases16.
13 Quodl. V, 9, OTh IX, p. 513: «[…] multitudini nominum synonymorum in voce 
non correspondet pluralitas in mente.» [Engl. transl. A. J. FREDDOSO – F. E. KELLEY, 
William of Ockham. Quodlibetal Questions, Yale University Press, New Haven 1990, 
p. 429]. See also SL I, 3, OPh I, p. 11: «[…] nominum synonymorum multiplicatio 
non est propter necessitatem signiﬁ cationis inventa, sed propter ornatum sermonis 
vel aliam causam consimilem accidentalem, quia quidquid per omnia synonyma 
signiﬁ catur posset per unum illorum exprimi sufﬁ cienter, et ideo multitudo conceptuum 
tali pluralitati synonymorum non correspondet».

his Ontological Parsimony», Dialogue, 31 (1992) 431-444.
15 See D. CHALMERS, «Is There Synonymy in Ockham’s Mental Language?», in 
P. V. SPADE (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Ockham, Cambridge University Press, 
Cambridge 1999, pp. 76-99.
16 The division of the matter in terms of the three kinds of synonymy is mine. Chalmers’ 
own ternary division rests upon the kind of arguments he resorts to (from logical equivalence, 
from efﬁ ciency, or from conceptual change). The two divisions ultimately coincide since 
each one of Chalmers’ arguments speaks in favour of a particular type of synonymy.

398 
CLAUDE PANACCIO
Case 1: In favour of accepting synonymy among complex mental 
expressions, Chalmers argues –correctly, it seems to me– that such 
phrases as ‘man with (cat or dog)’ and ‘(man with cat) or (man with dog)’ 
should be treated by Ockham both as synonymous with each other and as 
corresponding to distinct mental units17.
Case 2: In favour of synonymy between a simple concept and a 
complex mental phrase, he remarks that there is no reason to exclude the 
possibility of mental abbreviations, especially when we deal with complex 
mental phrases that are used repeatedly18. Although Chalmers does not 
mention it, Ockham himself seems indeed to allow for such a possibility 
in a few passages19.
Case 3: In favour of synonymy among distinct simple concepts, 
Chalmers resorts to conceptual change: two distinct concepts, he thinks, 
could gradually change their meaning until they ﬁ nally drift into synonymy 
while nevertheless remaining distinct20. This is much less decisive, though: 
it is far from clear that a concept can change signiﬁ cation in Ockham’s 
semantics while remaining the same21. On the other hand, however, I don’t 
see how Ockham could exclude the possibility that two numerically distinct 
concepts be caused in the mind of a given person by different individuals 
17 CHALMERS, «Is There Synonymy», pp. 77-78.
18 Ibid., pp. 84-86.
19 See in particular Quaest. in libr. Phys. 6, OPh VI, p. 410, and Exp. In Perih., 
Prooemium 6, OPh II, p. 358, along with the analysis I proposed of these passages in 
PANACCIO, Ockham on Concepts, pp. 32-33.
20 CHALMERS, «Is There Synonymy», pp. 82-84.
21 To be exact, a concept certainly can signify different things at different times, 
according to Ockham, if we take ‘to signify’ in its narrowest sense, according to which 
‘horse’, for example, signiﬁ es only presently existing horses (see SL I, 33, OPh I, 
p. 95). This is probably the sense Ockham has in mind when he writes that «if [a] 
concept were to change its signiﬁ cation, by that fact alone it would happen that the 
[subordinated] spoken word would change its signiﬁ cation» (SL I, 1, OPh I, p. 8: «[…] 
si conceptus ille mutaret signiﬁ catum suum eo ipso ipsa vox, sine nova institutione, 
suum signiﬁ catum permutaret»). [Engl. transl. M. J. LOUX, Ockham’s Theory of Terms. 
Part I of the Summa Logicae, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, IN 1974, 
p. 50]. But the sense of ‘to signify’ which is of interest in assessing synonymy is the 
wider one, according to which ‘horse’, for example, signiﬁ es all past, present, future 
and even possible horses. In other words: two terms can be said to be synonymous 
only if they signify the same individuals as one another at all times and in all possible 
worlds. It is not clear to me how a concept could change its signiﬁ cation in that sense 
for Ockham.

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
399
of the same species without the person noticing the coincidence. Suppose 
for example that I ﬁ rst meet a horse and form in a typically Ockhamistic 
fashion an (absolute) concept that signiﬁ es all possible horses and nothing 
else22, and that afterwards I meet a very different horse without mentally 
connecting it with the previous one. The concept I would form in the 
second instance would also signify all possible horses and would thus be 
perfectly synonymous with the former one. Those two, however, will be 
kept distinct in my mind if, as I have argued elsewhere, two conceptual 
episodes within a given mind can be seen as tokens of the same concept 
within Ockhamism only if they both belong to a single causal chain of acts 
and habitus ultimately going back to a single original episode of concept 
acquisition23.
The upshot is that none of the three kinds of synonymy can legitimately 
be banned from Ockham’s mental language, although the third one (which 
is, as far as I can see, the only one he wanted to exclude) would certainly 
require further discussion. Our present interest, however, is on nominal 
deﬁ nitions and their deﬁ nienda, and our discussion, consequently, must 
focus on cases of type 2. Assuming, as I claim to have shown in previous 
publications24, that there are simple connotative concepts in Ockham’s 
mental language, and assuming, along with Chalmers, that a complex 
phrase and its abbreviation can coexist in Ockham’s mental language and 
that if they do, they are utterly synonymous with each other, the question 
we now have to address is the following: Can simple connotative concepts 
be seen as mere mental abbreviations for their nominal deﬁ nitions in 
Ockham ? If the answer was yes, Ockham’s theory would be threatened by 
the same predicament than in Spade’s interpretation: all simple connotative 
concepts –including all relational ones– would be mere abbreviations 
and should consequently be logically dispensable. Which as a matter of 
principle they are not. This is the question I will now turn to:  Is Ockham 
committed to thesis T3 above, namely that nominal deﬁ nitions are always 
synonymous with their deﬁ nienda?
22 An absolute species concept, for Ockham, can be acquired on the basis of a 
single encounter. See e.g. Quodl. IV, 17, OTh IX, p. 385: «[…] conceptus speciei 
potest abstrahi ab uno individuo.» See on this PANACCIO, Ockham on Concepts, 
pp. 10-11.

2. Are nominal deﬁ nitions synonymous with their deﬁ nienda?
The occasion for revisiting the point is provided to me by a recent 
paper in which the Italian scholar Fabrizio Amerini elaborately argues that 
simple connotative terms are semantically synonymous with their nominal 
deﬁ nitions for Ockham, although they can occur as distinct items in his 
mental language25. I do agree, unsurprisingly, with the latter point: simple 
connotative concepts and their nominal deﬁ nitions do coexist as distinct 
items in Ockham’s mental language (and as we have seen in the discussion 
of T2 above, they could do so even if they were synonymous with each 
other). I have to dissent from Amerini, however, on the other point (which 
is actually the main thesis of his paper): as I understand Ockham, not only 
is he not committed to T3 but he in fact explicitly rejects it.
2.1. Synonymy
The ﬁ rst thing we need to clarify, obviously, is what we mean by 
semantic synonymy. This is a point, I think, where Amerini and I can agree 
on the basis of what Ockham explicitly says in Summa logicae I, 6. He 
distinguishes there between two senses of ‘synonymy’. According to the 
narrower one, two terms are synonymous with each other when all users 
intend to use them for the same things; but this is not, Ockham immediately 
adds, the sense he uses himself26. In the second –and favoured– sense two 
terms are synonymous if and only if they both signify exactly the same 
things under exactly the same modes, so that nothing is signiﬁ ed by one of 
them under a certain mode (e.g. primarily or connotatively or negatively) 
which is not signiﬁ ed by the other one under the same mode, whether the 
speakers are aware of this or not27.
25 AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy».
26 SL I, 6, OPh I, p. 19: «Stricte dicuntur illa synonyma quibus omnes utentes 
intendunt simpliciter uti pro eodem, et sic non loquor hic de synonymis». Ockham here 
excludes this sense only from the discussion he is then pursuing (about concrete and 
abstract terms), but I know of no other context where he favours it.
27 Ibid.: «Large dicuntur illa synonyma quae simpliciter idem signiﬁ cant omnibus 
modis, ita quod nihil aliquo modo signiﬁ catur per unum quin eodem modo signiﬁ cetur 
per reliquum, quamvis non omnes utentes credant ipsa idem signiﬁ care […]» Note 
that contrary to what is sometimes said, synonymy is not deﬁ ned by Ockham in terms 

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS

This deﬁ nition is readily applicable to pairs of simple synonymous 
terms, which is probably what Ockham primarily had in mind when he 
coined it. Yet it can be extended to the other two sorts of cases28. Applying 
it ﬁ rst to the relation between two complex phrases, what we get is what 
Ockham says himself about the particular case of two nominal deﬁ nitions 
being semantically equivalent to each other if and only if anything which is 
signiﬁ ed in some mode or other by a part of one of the two is also signiﬁ ed 
under the same mode by a corresponding part of the other one29. In such 
cases, the two complex phrases could differ from each other in some of 
their parts, but they would nevertheless be synonymous if any given part of 
one of them should be synonymous with a corresponding part of the other 
one (one of them, for instance, could have ‘petra’ where the other one has 
‘lapis’ since ‘petra’ and ‘lapis’ are themselves synonymous according to 
Ockham)30.
It is less clear what synonymy between a simple term and a complex 
phrase should amount to, as in the case that primarily interests us here of 
a connotative name and its nominal deﬁ nition. Presumably it would have 
to be something like this: A simple term T is synonymous with a complex 
of the subordination of the two synonymous phrases to the same concept. If it was, 
synonymy between two mental phrases would be excluded by mere deﬁ nition since 
mental phrases are not themselves subordinated to concepts. Ockham’s deﬁ nition, by 
contrast, has no such consequence. Subordination to the same concept is a sufﬁ cient 
condition for Ockhamistic synonymy, but not a necessary one.
28 That Ockham himself is ready to speak of synonymy between two complex 
phrases comes out, for instance, from his discussion of ‘principia prima’ and ‘principia 
immediata’ in SL III-2, 14 (OPh I, p. 529). His conclusion in this particular case is 
that despite being convertible with each other, the two phrases are not synonymous 
(«non sunt termini synonymi») because they do not have the same nominal deﬁ nitions, 
but synonymy, as it seems, would not have been excluded by the mere syntactical 
complexity of the phrases involved.
29 See SL I, 10, OPh I, pp. 35-36: «[…] proprie loquendo unius nominis habentis 
deﬁ nitionem exprimentem quid nominis est una deﬁ nitio explicans quid nominis, 
sic scilicet quod talis nominis non sunt diversae orationes exprimentes quid nominis 
habentes partes distinctas, quarum aliqua signiﬁ cat aliquid quod non eodem modo 
importatur per aliquam partem alterius orationis» (with my italics). What is suggested 
here is that two distinct complex phrases might be seen as constituting the ‘same’ 
nominal deﬁ nition if they do not differ from each other by the signiﬁ cation of any one 
of their corresponding parts.
30 Ockham gives ‘petra’ and ‘lapis’ as examples of synonymous terms in Quodl. 
V, 8, OTh IX, pp. 510-511.

CLAUDE PANACCIO
phrase C only if whatever is signiﬁ ed by T under some mode is signiﬁ ed 
by some part of C in a corresponding way; and conversely, whatever is 
signiﬁ ed in some way or other by a part of C is signiﬁ ed by T under some 
corresponding mode. I will leave it open at this point what exactly the 
correspondence should be between the modes under which something is 
signiﬁ ed by the term T and how it is signiﬁ ed by a part of the complex 
phrase C. This has to be a bit complicated. For example whitenesses 
being obliquely signiﬁ ed by the simple term ‘white’ corresponds to their 
being signiﬁ ed by a term which occurs in an oblique case in the complex 
deﬁ nition ‘a substance having a whiteness’. Only if there was such 
systematic correspondences all across the board between everything that is 
signiﬁ ed by a part of a nominal deﬁ nition and everything that is signiﬁ ed 
under some mode or other by the deﬁ niendum, would the two of them be 
synonymous. 
The only alternative account I can think of for what synonymy could be 
between a simple term and a complex phrase would require that the global 
signiﬁ cation of the complex phrase C should leave out somehow some of 
the signiﬁ cates of some of its parts. On this approach, ‘white animal’ for 
example might signify (or connote) only the animals that are white and the 
whitenesses of these animals even if taken separately ‘animal’ signiﬁ es all 
animals and ‘white’ signiﬁ es all white things and connotes all whitenesses. 
The simple term T would then be synonymous with C if and only if it 
signiﬁ es and connotes the same individuals as C taken as a whole with no 
requirement that everything which is signiﬁ ed or connoted by the parts of 
C should also be signiﬁ ed or connoted by T. As far as I can see, however, 
this account ﬁ nds no support in Ockham’s texts. On the contrary, if the 
global signiﬁ cation of complex phrases was conceived of along these lines, 
the strict semantic equivalence of two complex phrases with one another 
would not require that everything which is signiﬁ ed by any part of one of 
these should be signiﬁ ed under the same mode by some corresponding part 
of the other one, as Ockham does require31. ‘Rational animal’, for example, 
would turn out to be synonymous with ‘rational man’, and this is something 
Ockham would reject, I am quite sure, precisely because, although the two 
of them cannot but supposit for the same things (men namely), something 
is signiﬁ ed by a part of the former (‘animal’ in this case) which is in no way 
signiﬁ ed by any part of the latter –the non-rational animals namely. But if 
31 See the text quoted in n. 29 above.

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
403
‘rational animal’ and ‘rational man’ are not synonymous with each other, 
this means that the global signiﬁ cation of complex phrases (including all 
their connotations) should not leave out any of the signiﬁ cates of their 
parts, as claimed by the account we are presently discussing.
Furthermore, the basic general notion of signiﬁ cation that is at play 
here should certainly incorporate the standard Augustinian idea that a sign 
‘brings to mind’ whatever it signiﬁ es32. But if the concept of ‘animal’ when 
taken alone brings to mind all animals, it is mysterious how it could fail 
to do so when it is accompanied by some other term such as ‘rational’ or 
‘white’. It seems natural to think, on the contrary, that given its structural 
composition a complex phrase such as ‘white animal’ directs the mind 
somehow towards all animals and all white things (although, of course, 
it cannot normally supposit for –or stand for– all animals and all white 
things).
I conclude that in order to be synonymous with each other for 
Ockham, a simple term T and a complex phrase C must of course primarily 
signify the same individuals (that is: they must be able to stand for the 
same things when they are taken in personal supposition), but they must 
be such, in addition, that anything which is signiﬁ ed by a part of C should 
also be signiﬁ ed in some corresponding way by T, and conversely. My 
contention is that although they usually satisfy the ﬁ rst condition, nominal 
deﬁ nitions and their deﬁ nienda normally do not satisfy the second one, and 
consequently are not synonymous with each other within the Ockhamistic 
framework. This is the claim, I take it, that Amerini disagrees with.
Amerini, by the way, distinguishes between epistemic synonymy and 
semantic synonymy, and he is ready to grant that a deﬁ niendum and its 
nominal deﬁ nition are not epistemically synonymous with each other for 
Ockham in the sense that their epistemological functions could be different 
(the nominal deﬁ nition, for example, might activate by epistemic association 
some other concept that is not normally activated by the corresponding 
deﬁ niendum)33. This is an interesting and intriguing distinction, to be sure, 
32 See Augustine, De Doctrina Christiana II, 1: «Signum est enim res, praeter 
speciem quam ingerit sensibus, aliud aliquid ex se faciens in cogitationem venire» 
(with my italics). That Ockham’s understanding of signiﬁ cation incorporates this 
Augustinian idea of ‘bringing something else to mind’ (aliud facere in cognitionem 
venire) is clear from his discussion of the notion of sign at the very beginning of the 
Summa logicae (SL I, 1, OPh I, pp. 8-9).
33 See AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 381.

CLAUDE PANACCIO
but I will leave it aside here. My focus will be exclusively on semantic 
synonymy, which is what we disagree about, Amerini and I, and this is 
purely a matter of what is signiﬁ ed by the nominal deﬁ nition and by its 
deﬁ niendum, and in what ways. Amerini argues at length that they are 
semantically synonymous with each other for Ockham, which is what I want 
to deny. Interestingly enough, Amerini offers precise textual arguments for 
his interpretation and I must therefore consider the relevant passages in 
some details. As I understand them, however, none of them supports the 
proposal that nominal deﬁ nitions are synonymous with their deﬁ nienda for 
Ockham. This is what I will try to show in the remaining of this paper, by 
concentrating –for reasons of space– upon the three main groups of texts 
quoted by Amerini in support of his reading.
2.2. Convertibility
First, Amerini strikingly claims the following:
[…] there is at least one place where Ockham indisputably asserts 
the full semantic convertibility between a connotative simple term 
and its nominal deﬁ nition, by stressing their completely identical 
mode of denotation, connotation, and supposition34.
The corresponding footnote in Amerini’s paper actually mentions two 
passages, both from the Ordinatio, one of which is only referred to while 
the second one, presumably more important, is extensively quoted.
Here is the ﬁ rst one:
And thus whenever a deﬁ nition is given by recourse to some extrinsic 
cause, this deﬁ nition is only a nominal deﬁ nition. This is proved in 
the following way: a deﬁ nition and the deﬁ ned term are convertible 
with each other, so that the deﬁ ned term can always be inferred from 
the deﬁ nition by a formal consequence, and conversely. But if such 
a deﬁ nition [i.e. the deﬁ nition by recourse to an extrinsic cause] 
was a real deﬁ nition [quid rei], the deﬁ nition could not formally be 
inferred from the deﬁ ned term, nor conversely, because it would 
34 Ibid., p. 384 (with my italics).

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
405
simply be possible that this thing be made without this extrinsic 
cause, at least by divine power […]35.
What is under discussion here is a case where a term is deﬁ ned with 
reference to some extrinsic cause, such as: ‘An eclipse is a privation of light 
on the moon due to the interference of the earth’. Such a deﬁ nition, Ockham 
says, is always a nominal deﬁ nition, since if it was taken to be a description 
of what the thing really is, it would fail to be formally convertible with the 
deﬁ ned term (because any real thing could happen to have been produced 
by God alone without the help of any given extrinsic secondary cause). 
The point is that if the term ‘eclipse’, for example, is taken to be formally 
convertible with the complex phrase ‘a privation of light on the moon due 
to the interference of the earth’ (as is required if the latter is a deﬁ nition of 
the former, whether a nominal or a real one), then that can only be because 
it is part of the nominal meaning of the term ‘eclipse’ that the privation of 
light that it refers to should be caused by the interference of the earth: If the 
same real phenomenon was caused by God alone (as Ockham takes it to be 
possible), it would simply not be called an ‘eclipse’.
It is true, then, that Ockham in this passage asserts the full convertibility 
of the nominal deﬁ nition with the deﬁ ned term, at least in the kind of case 
he is then considering. Yet two things are to be noted. First –and foremost– 
full convertibility in such cases is not said, or even suggested, to require 
full synonymy. Nowhere in this passage nor in the surrounding pages does 
Ockham account for the convertibility of deﬁ niendum and deﬁ nition «by 
stressing their completely identical mode of denotation, connotation, and 
supposition» as Amerini claims. The point is just that all eclipses are 
privations of light on the moon due to the interference of the earth, and that 
conversely every privation of light which is caused in this way is an eclipse, 
and that this is analytically true. No reference is made by Ockham in this 
context to the modes of signiﬁ cation of the terms involved. Synonymy is 
simply not at stake here.
35 Ockham, Ord. Prol., q. 5, OTh I, p. 171: «Et ita semper quando deﬁ nitio datur 
per aliquam causam extrinsecam, illa deﬁ nitio est exprimens quid nominis tantum. 
Hoc probatur: quia deﬁ nitio et deﬁ nitum convertuntur, ita quod semper consequentia 
formali contingit inferre deﬁ nitum ex deﬁ nitione, et e converso. Sed si talis deﬁ nitio 
exprimeret quid rei, non inferretur formaliter deﬁ nitio ex deﬁ nito, nec e converso, quia 
simpliciter posset illa res ﬁ eri sine illa causa extrinseca, saltem per potentiam divinam» 
(with my translation and italics).

406 
CLAUDE PANACCIO
Second, that full convertibility is not accounted for by synonymy in 
Ockham’s view is conﬁ rmed by the fact that his argument in this passage 
presupposes that not only nominal but also real deﬁ nitions should be fully 
convertible with their deﬁ nienda. The point of the argument is that if the 
relevant complex phrase (along with its reference to an extrinsic cause) was 
taken to be a description of the real thing out there, then it would fail to 
satisfy a crucial requirement of real deﬁ nitions, that of full convertibility 
namely. When correctly construed, real deﬁ nitions are considered by 
Ockham as fully convertible with their deﬁ nienda, just as much as nominal 
deﬁ nitions are. But real deﬁ nitions, as Amerini readily admits, are not in 
general synonymous with their deﬁ nienda36. An absolute term such as 
‘man’, for example, has no connotation whatsoever; yet it does have a real 
deﬁ nition –‘rational animal’, say, which must at least connote rationalities. 
Full convertibility, then, does not require synonymy for Ockham, and the 
passage from the Ordinatio quoted above provides no support for the notion 
that nominal deﬁ nitions should be semantically synonymous with their 
deﬁ nienda. Synonymy, admittedly, entails convertibility, but not the reverse.
I now turn to the second passage that Amerini quotes in support of his 
claim that Ockham stresses the ‘completely identical mode of denotation, 
connotation, and supposition’ of a simple connotative term and its nominal 
deﬁ nition37. It is also from the Ordinatio, but from nowhere around the 
previous one, being found in Distinction 2, question 4 rather than in the 
Prologue. Here it is:
To the ﬁ rst of these, I say a deﬁ nition and the deﬁ ned are never the 
same thing […] But this notwithstanding, they supposit for the same 
thing –and indeed for precisely the same thing. Neither is anything 
signiﬁ ed primarily and principally by the one expression unless it is 
signiﬁ ed by the other. Nor is anything extrinsic connoted by either 
of them38.
36 See AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 383: «It is 
known that there are texts where Ockham argues for the non-synonymy between an 
absolute simple term and its real deﬁ nition.» Amerini refers the reader to SL I, 10 for 
an instance of such texts.
37 AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 384 (especially 
n. 12).
38 Ord., dist. 2, q. 4, OTh II, p. 130: «Ad primum istorum dico quod numquam 
deﬁ nitio et deﬁ nitum sunt eadem res […]; hoc tamen non obstante pro eadem re 
supponunt et praecise pro eadem re; nec aliqua res signiﬁ catur primo et principaliter 

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
407
This comes closer to what Amerini is looking for since it does compare 
the signiﬁ cation and connotation of a deﬁ nition with that of the deﬁ ned term. 
But note ﬁ rst that while Ockham does say that they both primarily signify 
the same, he does not say that they connote the same. What he says instead 
is that none of them connotes anything extrinsic («nec aliquid extrinsecum 
connotatur per alterum eorum»). This leaves open the possibility that one 
of them should connote something intrinsic that the other one does not 
connote. And this is in fact what Ockham has in mind. Let me explain.
Contrary to what is required by Amerini’s use of it, this passage is 
actually not about nominal deﬁ nitions at all. It is about real deﬁ nitions. 
Ockham there is in the course of discussing the problem of universals. 
The kind of deﬁ nitions he is considering in this context are the deﬁ nitions 
of substances by genus and difference, such as ‘man is a rational animal’, 
and those are real rather than nominal deﬁ nitions. What Ockham says is 
two things: (1) that everything which is primarily signiﬁ ed by ‘man’ is also 
primarily signiﬁ ed by ‘rational animal’, and vice versa (in other words : 
every man is a rational animal, and every rational animal is a man); and 
(2) that neither ‘man’ nor ‘rational animal’ connote anything extrinsic. The 
latter point is to be understood against the background of his general theory 
of real deﬁ nitions. Strictly speaking, such deﬁ nitions, he says in the Summa 
logicae, express the total nature of the thing without connoting anything 
extrinsic to that thing39. This is not to say, however, that ‘man’ and ‘rational 
animal’ are synonymous with each other. Indeed ‘man’ is an absolute term, 
not a connotative one, and consequently it does not connote anything either 
extrinsic or intrinsic, while ‘rational animal’ on the other hand does connote 
something, but something intrinsic to men, their rational souls namely40.
The passage quoted by Amerini, consequently, has no bearing upon 
whether simple connotative terms are synonymous or not with their 
nominal deﬁ nitions, since it is neither about connotative terms nor about 
per unum quin signiﬁ cetur per reliquum; nec aliquid extrinsecum connotatur per 
alterum eorum» (transl. and italics are by P. V. SPADE in Five Texts on the Mediaeval 
Problem of Universals, Hackett Publ. Co., Indianapolis IN 1994, p. 134).
39 SL I, 26, OPh I, pp. 84-85: «Deﬁ nitio exprimens quid rei dupliciter accipitur 
[…] Aliter accipitur hoc nomen ‘deﬁ nitio’ stricte, et sic est sermo compendiosus, 
exprimens totam naturam rei, nec aliquid extrinsecum rei deﬁ nitae declarans».
40 See SL I, 26, OPh I, p. 85: «Talis est ista deﬁ nitio hominis ‘animal rationale’ 
vel ista ‘substantia animata sensibilis rationalis’. Nam istae differentiae ‘animata’, 
‘sensibilis’, ‘rationalis’ supponunt pro homine, quia homo est rationalis, animatus et 
sensibilis, tamen important partem hominis […]» (with my italics).

408 
CLAUDE PANACCIO
nominal deﬁ nitions, but about absolute terms and real deﬁ nitions (which, 
as Amerini accepts, are not synonymous with each other)41. Two terms ‘F’ 
and ‘G’ are convertible with each other if and only if all Fs are Gs and all 
Gs are Fs –and they are formally convertible if and only if this holds in all 
possible worlds where something is either F or G. In Ockham’s vocabulary, 
this requires of course that ‘F’ and ‘G’ should primarily signify the same 
things, but is does not require that they should connote the same things 
(as shown, by the case of ‘man’ and ‘rational animal’). Convertibility, 
therefore, does not require full synonymy.
2.3. Sameness of signiﬁ cation
A second group of texts on which Amerini relies are those where 
Ockham says that a deﬁ nition and its deﬁ niendum typically ‘signify the 
same’, such as the following one from the Summa logicae: «However 
despite the fact that a deﬁ nition and what is deﬁ ned are not really 
the same, what they signify is really the same»42. Yet saying that the 
deﬁ nition and the deﬁ niendum signify the same does not usually mean 
in Ockham that they are synonymous with each other. It merely means 
in most contexts that they primarily signify the same thing, but they 
could very well secondarily –or obliquely– connote different things. The 
proof of this is that the passage I just quoted (which is one of those 
Amerini invokes) is not speciﬁ cally about nominal deﬁ nitions, but about 
deﬁ nitions in general, including real deﬁ nitions. This passage is drawn 
from chapter 22 of Summa logicae III-3, which bears upon deﬁ nitions 
in general, while the distinction between real and nominal deﬁ nitions 
is only introduced by Ockham in the following chapter43. The quoted 
passage, consequently, is supposed to apply to real deﬁ nitions as well 
as to nominal deﬁ nitions and, as we have seen, real deﬁ nitions are not 
synonymous with their deﬁ nienda.
41 See above n. 36.
42 SL III-3, 22, OPh I, p. 680: «Tamen non obstante quod deﬁ nitio et deﬁ nitum 
non sint idem realiter, tamen signiﬁ cant idem realiter».
43 See the beginning of SL III-3, 23, OPh I, pp. 681-682: «Viso in generali quid est 
deﬁ nitio, videndum est quot modis dicatur, ponendo scilicet aliquas distinctiones de 
deﬁ nitione. Est autem una distinctio talis, quod deﬁ nitionum quaedam exprimit quid 
rei et quaedam quid nominis.»

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
409
Indeed, Ockham would even say on occasions that two terms signify 
entirely the same (signiﬁ cant omnino idem) but still would not want to say 
that they are synonymous, as he explicitly does with ‘ens’ and ‘unum’44 
and with ‘pater’ and ‘ﬁ lius’45. This is not of course the same kind of case as 
with deﬁ nitions and their deﬁ nienda, but such passages clearly show that 
not even ‘signifying entirely the same’ implies synonymy for Ockham. A 
fortiori, merely ‘signifying the same’, which is a weaker semantic relation 
for him, does not either.
2.4. Nugatio
The third group of texts I want to look at has to do with the question 
of ‘nugatio’, which is in the medieval logical vocabulary, a kind of 
inappropriate redundancy. An important part of Amerini’s argument rests 
on Ockham’s treatment of nugatio in his Commentary on the Sophistical 
Refutations46. This is entirely relevant because nugatio typically occurs, 
Ockham thinks, when a term is replaced by its nominal deﬁ nition in 
certain kinds of contexts. Ockham takes it, for example, that the nominal 
deﬁ nition of ‘concupiscence’ (concupiscentia) is ‘an appetite for pleasure’ 
(appetitus delectationis)47. Now some philosophers, he remarks, sometimes 
correctly speak of a ‘concupiscence for pleasure’, but if we replace the 
word ‘concupiscence’ by its nominal deﬁ nition in such a phrase, the result 
is the inappropriately redundant expression ‘an appetite for pleasure for 
pleasure’, which is a typical case of nugatio.
44 See Quodl. IV, 7, OTh IX, p. 334: «Similiter ‘ens’ et ‘unum’ signiﬁ cant omnino 
idem et supponunt pro eodem et tamen haec est vera ‘unum est passio entis’, et haec 
falsa ‘ens est passio entis’; et hoc quia isti termini ‘ens’ et ‘unum’ habent diversam 
descriptionem quid nominis» (with my italics).
45 See Quaest. in libr. Phys., q. 25, OPh VI, p. 461: «[…] illa nomina ‘pater’ et 
‘ﬁ lius’ signiﬁ cant omnino idem, et tamen haec est falsa ‘ﬁ lius est pater’» (with my 
italics). The point is that ‘pater’ primarily signiﬁ es fathers and connotes children 
while ‘ﬁ lius’ primarily signiﬁ es children and connotes fathers, so that anything which 
is signiﬁ ed either primarily or connotatively by one of them is also signiﬁ ed either 
primarily or connotatively by the other one, yet they are not synonymous with each 
other because they do not signify the same things under the same modes.

CLAUDE PANACCIO
Ockham wants to say that according to Aristotle –and this is a solution 
he obviously endorses– those philosophers who use a phrase such as ‘a 
concupiscence for pleasure’ are only apparently led to nugatio, because 
they can legitimately resist the substitution of the nominal deﬁ nition for 
the deﬁ niendum in such a context. The passage where Ockham explains 
the point is one I had stressed myself in support of my own interpretation48, 
since, as I read it, this passage explicitly says that a term and its nominal 
deﬁ nition do not entirely signify the same49 and that this is why they are 
not substitutable for each other in all contexts. This is a crucial text for the 
present discussion; here it is:
[…] they seem to commit a nugation but they don’t if their opponents 
have not asked from the beginning to be granted the following 
principle, namely that a name and its deﬁ nition entirely signify the 
same and that one can be substituted for the other and that whatever 
can appropriately be added to one of them can appropriately be added 
to the other one –as it was said to be the case for the term ‘double’ 
and its deﬁ nition– and by straightaway deriving the nugation, as if it 
was entirely certain that the said principle was true, while however 
it is not true (cum tamen non sit vera) although it seems to be true; 
and thus they apparently get a nugation, but not really50.
The imagined context is that of a disputatio where somebody uses 
a phrase such as ‘a concupiscence for pleasure’ and some opponent then 
48 PANACCIO, Ockham on Concepts, pp. 70-71.
49 As we have seen in section 2.3 above, signifying entirely the same is not a 
sufﬁ cient condition for synonymy, but surely it is a necessary one: any two phrases 
which do not entirely signify the same are not synonymous for Ockham.
50 Sup. Elench. I, 20, sect. 5, OPh III, p. 133: «Hic ostendit [Aristoteles] quomodo 
non vere sed tantum apparenter ducitur quis ad nugationem, dicens quod videntur 
facere nugationem, non tamen faciunt, si opponentes non petant in principio sibi dari 
illam propositionem, scilicet quod nomen et sua deﬁ nitio idem omnino signiﬁ cent et 
quod loco unius possit alterum poni et quod quidquid convenienter additur uni potest 
convenienter addi alteri –sicut dictum est quod ita sit de duplo et sua deﬁ nitione–, 
sed statim inferunt nugationem quasi omnino sit certum quod praedicta propositio sit 
vera, cum tamen non sit vera quamvis videatur esse vera; et ita apparenter ducunt ad 
nugationem et non vere» (with my italics). I want to thank Heine Hansen for having 
suggested to me that «si […] non petant in principio» is better translated in this context 
by «if [they] have not asked from the beginning» than by «if [they] do not commit a 
petition of principle» as I had originally done.

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS

claims that this person is committed to a nugatio since ‘an appetite for 
pleasure’ is the accepted nominal deﬁ nition for ‘concupiscence’. What 
Ockham takes Aristotle to be saying about such cases is that the argument 
of the opponens is not good, because it implicitly assumes a false principle, 
namely that a nominal deﬁ nition and its deﬁ niendum signify entirely the 
same and are substitutable for each other in all contexts. Ockham here, as 
I understand him, denies that a nominal deﬁ nition is synonymous with its 
deﬁ niendum.
Amerini, on the other hand, thinks otherwise. His claim is that although 
my reading of this passage is the most natural, there is another possible 
interpretation, which, he says, he is inclined to adopt. He reads the end of 
the passage («[…] quasi omnino sit certum quod praedicta propositio sit 
vera, cum tamen non sit vera […]») as saying not that the principle is not 
true, but only that it is not entirely true:
An interpreter however, Amerini writes, might resist such a reading 
[mine, that is –C. P.] and take the text as saying, more blandly, that it 
is not entirely true that a term and its deﬁ nition signify the same thing 
because we could ﬁ nd at least one case in which such a proposition 
is not true. In this case, such a proposition is not (entirely) false, but 
true, although not entirely (i.e. not always) true51.
In ‘quasi omnino sit certum quod praedicta propositio sit vera’, the 
adverb ‘omnino’, according to this reading, should qualify ‘vera’ rather 
than ‘certum’ as I had understood it.
This seems quite implausible to me. First, if ‘omnino’ had qualiﬁ ed 
‘vera’ rather than ‘certum’ –which is already a bit stretched from a purely 
grammatical point of view–, Ockham would certainly have repeated it 
in the clause that immediately follows and he would have written «cum 
tamen non sit omnino vera». And it does not seem to me, furthermore, 
that he would have been happy with the idea of such a principle being 
neither entirely true nor entirely false. Connecting ‘omnino’ with ‘certum’, 
by contrast, is grammatically quite natural and it makes perfect sense 
doctrinally speaking. What Ockham means to say is that the opponens 
in the imagined situation uncritically assumes the synonymy principle 
as if it was entirely beyond suspicion, which is why this same opponens 
51 AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 395.

CLAUDE PANACCIO
‘straightaway’ (statim) derives the nugation. Ockham unqualifyingly 
asserts then that the principle is not true («cum tamen non sit vera») and 
not that it is not completely true or partially true or sometimes true and 
sometimes false.
Amerini purports to defend his reading of these lines by pointing to 
another chapter of Ockham’s commentary on the Sophistical Refutations 
which is dedicated to the avoidance of nugatio52. Ockham there explains that 
although the substitution of the deﬁ nition for the deﬁ niendum is harmless in 
most contexts, it should not be accepted in contexts where the deﬁ ned term 
is taken along with some other term that occurs within its nominal deﬁ nition:
[…] it is not legitimate to substitute the deﬁ nition for the deﬁ ned 
term when the latter is taken or conjoined with that by which it 
is deﬁ ned, in the same way that it is legitimate if the term is not 
conjoined with that by which it is deﬁ ned53.
In ‘concupiscence is a vice’, for example, there is no problem in 
replacing ‘concupiscence’ by ‘appetite for pleasure’. But this is not so in the 
phrase ‘a concupiscence for pleasure’ precisely because the term ‘pleasure’ 
occurs in the nominal deﬁ nition of ‘concupiscence’. Thus nugatio is 
generally avoided if one refrains from the illegitimate substitution of the 
deﬁ nition for the deﬁ niendum in such contexts.
As I understand it, this development comforts my interpretation. 
Ockham explicitly rejects in this chapter the principle that a deﬁ nition 
can always be substituted for its deﬁ niendum. Yet if the two of them were 
synonymous, they should always be substitutable for each other (at least 
when taken in personal supposition)54. Since there are contexts where they 
are not, we can safely conclude that they are not synonymous for Ockham.
52 Sup. Elench. II, 16, OPh III, pp. 296-305.
53 Ibid., sect. 4, OPh III, p. 300: «[…] non est licitum ponere deﬁ nitionem loco 
deﬁ niti quando sumitur seu copulatur cum illo per quod deﬁ nitur, sicut est hoc licitum 
si non copuletur cum illo per quod deﬁ nitur.»
54 Obviously, even synonymous terms are not always substitutable to each other 
when taken in material supposition: ‘petra’, for example, cannot be replaced salva 
veritate by ‘lapis’ in ‘petra is a feminine word’ even if the two of them are strictly 
synonymous. But Ockham in Sup. Elench. II, 16, discusses only cases where both 
the deﬁ niendum and the deﬁ nition are taken in personal supposition and if they were 
synonymous, they should be substitutable to each other in all such contexts since 
whatever is signiﬁ ed by one of them would then be signiﬁ ed by the other one, and 
under the same mode.

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
413
Amerini relies on the following –somewhat convoluted– passage for 
his own reading:
Secondly it is to be noted that the Philosopher does not mean to 
say that a name does not signify the same when it is taken within a 
complex phrase and when it is taken outside of a complex phrase, 
if we use ‘to signify’ properly. But he means that it does not signify 
the same in such a way that just as it is legitimate and ﬂ awless to 
substitute the nominal deﬁ nition of a relative term for that term 
when it is not taken along with its correlative […], it is in the same 
way legitimate and ﬂ awless to substitute the nominal deﬁ nition for 
this relative term when it is conjoined with its correlative […]55.
Amerini interprets Ockham here as saying that in some contexts the 
term signiﬁ es the same as its deﬁ nition and that in some other contexts it does 
not signify the same. Which leads to the conclusion that in most contexts a 
connotative or a relative term is indeed synonymous with its deﬁ nition56. 
What Ockham is telling us, according to Amerini, is that «the role –nominal 
or adjectival– played by a term can modify the signiﬁ cation of the term so that 
the intersubstitutability [of deﬁ nition and deﬁ niendum] no longer holds»57.
As I understand the quoted passage, however, this is precisely what 
Ockham takes Aristotle to be denying58. And this denial is entirely in 
55 Sup. Elench. II, 16, OPh III, pp. 298-299: «Secundo notandum est quod non 
est intentio Philosophi dicere quod nomen non signiﬁ cat idem, positum in oratione et 
extra orationem, proprie loquendo de signiﬁ care. Sed intendit quod non signiﬁ cat sic 
idem, ut sicut, sine vitio, loco nominis relativi non sumpti cum suo correlativo, est 
licitum ponere suam deﬁ nitionem exprimentem quid nominis […] sic quando nomen 
relativum coniungitur suo correlativo, sit licitum, sine vitio, loco illius nominis ponere 
suam deﬁ nitionem exprimentem quid nominis […]».
56 The quoted passage speaks only of ‘relative’ terms such as ‘double’ or ‘father’, 
for which there normally exists a correlative (respectively ‘half’ and ‘child’ for 
example). But Amerini is right to think that what is said here should hold mutatis 
mutandis for connotative terms in the wide sense, of which relative terms are but a 
special case (see Sup. Elench. II, 16, OPh III, p. 301). Ockham holds indeed that a 
relative term cannot be completely deﬁ ned without its correlative (see SL III-3, 26, 
OPh I, p. 690; In Porph. 2, OPh II, pp. 31-32; and Quodl. VI, 24, OTh IX, pp. 673-
678). Such a term being conjoined with its correlative, then, is just a special case of a 
connotative term being conjoined with that by which it is deﬁ ned.
57 AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 401.
58 The ﬁ rst sentence of the passage quoted in n. 55 above is quite explicit about this.

414 
CLAUDE PANACCIO
line with Ockham’s own treatment of signiﬁ cation in the proper sense as 
something which is normally not modiﬁ ed by the propositional context (by 
contrast with supposition). No wonder, then, that Amerini sees a problem 
of consistency between the thesis he attributes to Ockham (namely, that 
the syntactical role of a connotative term can modify its signiﬁ cation) 
and Ockham’s ofﬁ cial doctrine that propositional context does not 
modify signiﬁ cation59. The problem actually is not with Ockham but with 
Amerini’s reading of the passage quoted above. What Ockham is saying 
there is that the term does not change signiﬁ cation according to whether it 
is taken alone or within some complex phrase, but that this (unchanging) 
signiﬁ cation is such that it allows for the substitution of the deﬁ nition for 
the term in some contexts, but not in others. And the mere fact that there 
are contexts where he takes the substitution to be illegitimate, shows that 
he does not see the term and its nominal deﬁ nition as synonymous after all.
2.5.  Semantic differences between nominal deﬁ nitions and their 
deﬁ nienda
What the semantic difference is exactly between a given connotative 
term, whether spoken, written or mental, and its nominal deﬁ nition is 
something Ockham, admittedly, is not explicit about, but in order to round 
up the present discussion, let me brieﬂ y state what I think his doctrine 
would have to be on this matter60.
Take the term ‘father’. Its nominal deﬁ nition, according to Ockham, 
is something like ‘a sensible substance having engendered a child’61. Two 
59 See AMERINI, «William of Ockham and Mental Synonymy», p. 403: 
«Unfortunately, Ockham does not linger on how to reconcile the idea that a term always 
signiﬁ es the same thing wherever it is used with the idea that the nominal or adjectival 
role of the term can modiﬁ y its signiﬁ cation, at least with respect to the possibility of 
replacing the term with its deﬁ nition. This remains a philosophically problematic point 
in Ockham’s explanation of the ‘fallacy’ of nugation» (with my italics).
60 See also on this C. PANACCIO, «Connotative Concepts and Their Deﬁ nition in 
Ockham’s Nominalism», in J. BIARD – I. ROSIER-CATACH (eds.), La tradition médiévale 
des Catégories (XIIe-XVe siècles), Peeters, Leuwen 2003, pp. 141-155, and C. PANACCIO, 
Ockham on Concepts, pp. 89-93.
61 See e.g. SL III-3, 26, OPh I, p. 690: «Sed [relativum] complete non potest 
deﬁ niri sine suo correlativo; ut deﬁ niatur sic ‘pater est substantia sensibilis habens 
ﬁ lium’ vel ‘est animal habens ﬁ lium’. Et tali deﬁ nitione relativa mutuo se deﬁ niunt.»

 
OCKHAM ON NOMINAL DEFINITIONS 
415
points are of interest to us in this example. First, the phrase ‘sensible 
substances’ which occurs in the deﬁ nition primarily signiﬁ es all sensible 
substances while ‘father’ does not. So something is signiﬁ ed in a certain 
way by a part of the deﬁ nition, which is not signiﬁ ed in a corresponding 
mode by the deﬁ niendum. Second, the term ‘child’ occurs in the deﬁ nition 
of ‘father’62, but ‘child’ connotes the fathers, just as ‘father’ connotes the 
children; and surely ‘father’ does not connote the fathers (it primarily 
signiﬁ es them). So again, something is signiﬁ ed in a certain way by a part 
of the deﬁ nition, which is not correspondingly signiﬁ ed by the deﬁ niendum. 
‘Father’ and its nominal deﬁ nition, consequently, are not synonymous with 
each other. This result can be generalized to all cases where a deﬁ nition 
starts with a term which primarily signiﬁ es more individuals than the 
deﬁ ned term, and to all deﬁ nitions with a connotative term in them (which 
includes at least all deﬁ nitions of relative terms).
Connotative terms, in short, are not usually synonymous with their 
nominal deﬁ nitions for Ockham. They are not mere abbreviations for their 
deﬁ nitions. And the two of them have distinctive semantical roles to play 
in any language where they both occur, including mental language.
62 Correlative terms interdeﬁ ne each other for Ockham; see e.g. the passage 
quoted in the previous note.


ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS*
THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE IN 
WILLIAM OF OCKHAM AND JOHN BURIDAN
1. Introduction
The central theoretical role of mental language is to explain the 
intentionality of conventional languages. This thesis is usually accepted by 
medieval philosophers, and it follows from Aristotle’s De Interpretatione, 
I, 16 or at least from Boethius’ interpretation of it1. However, the idea of 
a mental language has been fully developed only in the XIVth century, by 
William of Ockham, as Claude Panaccio has shown in his seminal work2: 
Ockham was the ﬁ rst to apply the apparatus of supposition theory to 
mental sentences, thereby building a structured language in the mind, as 
opposed to isolated concepts, on the one hand, and to mental counterparts 
of conventional languages, on the other. 
It is of course not the same to say that a vocal word corresponds to a 
concept, and to say that a vocal sentence corresponds to a mental one, since 
the second claim, but not the ﬁ rst, requires a syntax in the mental realm. 
One solution is simply to apply the syntax of conventional languages 
(CL) to the mental language (ML). Don’t we do think in a conventional 
language, the very same language we speak? While this is probably part 
of the phenomenology of thought, it cannot be an answer to our question 
concerning the structure of the ML for two reasons. To begin with, it goes 
against the claim that ML is common to all human beings. Moreover, it 
is not compatible with one central explanandum that motivates the very 
notion of a ML: the explanation of the intentionality goes from ML to 
CL, therefore the suggested projection of the syntax doesn’t have the right 
direction. That is why Peter Geach’s suspicion, that Ockham «merely

ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
transfers features of Latin grammar to Mental»3 should be resisted, if the 
theory of a ML, or at least Ockham’s implementation of it, is to live up to 
its promises.
Geach’s criticism and John Trentman’s answer to it, comparing 
Ockham’s ML with «slightly old-fashioned ideal languages of twentieth-
century philosophers»4 may seem both a bit outdated now. There is a 
criterion guiding the description of ML in Ockham’s philosophy, and 
Geach’s charge doesn’t seem to be justiﬁ ed. However, the parallel with 
ideal languages suggested by Trentman is also far-fetched, the proposed 
criterion is not enough to fully determine the syntax of mental sentences. 
Some of the most able interpreters of Ockham have proposed different 
solutions to deal with this underdetermination, and (at least some of them) 
think that it prevents Ockham’s theory to fulﬁ ll all the expectations raised 
by the very project of a ML. I will examine two strategies, proposed by 
Marilyn Adams and Calvin Normore, to deal with this issue. My aim is to 
show that both proposals are wanting –and I hasten to say that I don’t have 
another way out of this quandary, if quandary it is.
2. Truth-conditional criteria
As I have already said, there is a criterion that allows us to devise a 
structure in the mental language that is not a result of a mere projection of 
features of a given conventional language: 
(T1) A feature e of a CL pertains to ML iff two sentences differing 
only in e have different truth-conditions. 
T1 offers a ﬁ lter to determine which features of CL are also features 
of ML. It avoids the mere projection from CL to ML, thereby responding 
to Geach’s worry. Notice however that T1 goes from CL to ML; just as the 
direction of explanation goes from ML to CL, the direction of recognition 
is the opposite. 
The only way to describe the structure of ML is to apply T1 to 
fragments of CL. Here is one of Ockham’s applications of this idea:

THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
419
The third thesis is that the common accidents of verbs belong to 
mental verbs. There are ﬁ ve such accidents, viz., mood, voice, 
number, tense, and person. For there are distinct spoken sentences 
differing only in such accidents, a difference because of which 
sometimes the one is true and the other is not […]5.
Consider the following sentences:
1. homo est animal.
2. homo est animalia. 
3. homo est albus.
4. homo est alba.
Applying T1 to 1-4, we will reach the results of the text quoted above: 
number, but not gender, belongs to the ML, since 1 and 2, differing only in 
number, have different truth-conditions, while 3 and 4 are true and false in 
precisely the situations, supposita congruitate. This ﬁ rst application of T1 
will identify bound morphemes as either part of the ML (number inﬂ exion) 
or not (gender inﬂ exion). It also applies to free morphemes, such as the 
syncategorems in the sentences below:
5. homo currit. 
6. omnis homo currit. 
Since 5 and 6 have different truth-conditions, and differ only by the word 
‘omnis’, this word ﬁ gures in the ML. This result is quite important to our 
quest, since it leads to the acceptance of syncategoremata in the ML. The 
introduction of syncategorems in ML takes on board a proper syntax for the 
mental realm: they are not content words, but have a structuring function, 
and are of course a crucial part of syntax.

ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
T1 can’t say that a word does not belong to the ML. Words are deﬁ ned 
as sounds paired with concepts, that is, with components of the ML6. If a 
sound were not to correspond to any concept, it would not be a word. T1 
has both positive and negative effects, so to speak, it can say that a certain 
feature belongs to the ML or not. We can see the negative effect in 3-4: 
there is no distinction of gender in the ML. The result is that the mental 
counterpart of ‘albus, -a –um’ has no gender, but of course it does exist. 
However, it cannot establish that a word corresponds to no concept –it 
wouldn’t be a word.
There is however a tension between this remark and the expectation 
that we could ﬁ nd in Ockham a fuller description of the structure of the 
ML. Consider the sentences below:
5. homo currit.
7. homo est currens. 
Since 5 and 7 have the same truth-conditions, one might expect that they 
correspond to a single mental sentence. What is the structure of their 
mental counterpart? As Adams has noted, T1 fails to answer this question7. 
The ﬁ rst thing to notice is that it doesn’t follow from Ockham’s texts that 
we have to choose between sentences with a copula as a tertium adiacens 
(such as 7) and sentences in which the verb is a secundum adiacens (such 
as 5) as representing the structure of the mental sentence.
[…] there is no need to posit such a plurality in the mind, since a 
verb is always equivalent in signiﬁ cation to, and synonymous with, 
the participle of the verb taken together with the verb ‘is’. And 
so just as synonymous names were instituted not because of any 
requirement of signiﬁ cation, but only for the sake of embellishing 
speech […], so, too, because spoken verbs and their participles 
were not instituted because of any requirement of signiﬁ cation or 
expressiveness, there is no such multiplicity of concepts in the mind 
corresponding to them8.

pluralitatem in mente, quia verbum semper et participium verbi suptum cum hoc verbo 

 
THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
421
Ockham says that there is no plurality of concepts corresponding to the 
distinction between 5 and 7, but not that one of them is the right representation 
of the mental syntax. Moreover, T1 could not say that a word in 5 or 7 has 
no counterpart in the mental realm, as we have already seen. 
But how could a mental sentence be neutral between 5 and 7? It either 
has a copula or not. The contrast between this case and 3-4 makes more 
striking the failure of T1: we can imagine a word without gender, but not 
a sentence neutral, so to speak, between the construction with a secundum 
adiacens, such as 5, and with a tertium adiacens, such as 7. We wanted 
more, as Paul Vincent Spade remarks. T1 says 
[…] no more than that spoken and written sentences with different 
truth conditions must correspond to mental sentences with different 
truth-relevant grammatical features –that is, with different truth 
conditions. That is so, but it is not what is wanted. It tells us which 
distinctions must be made in mental language, but it says nothing 
at all about how mental language makes them; it does not give us a 
single rule of mental grammar, but only what is to be accomplished 
by such rules9.
Adams also thinks that Ockham should have provided a criterion for 
us to describe the «mental grammar», and that he should have chosen 7 
over 5. She proposes the following supplementary criterion:
(T2) The mental language has a structure that makes the logical 
form of an expression fully explicit10.
This criterion will lead to choose 7 over 5, and it should be preferred:
Retaining the more complex in preference to the less complex 
structure makes the logical relations among the parts explicit and 
‘est’ in signiﬁ cando aequipollent et sunt synonyma. Et ideo sicut nomina synonyma non 
sunt inventa propter necessitatem signiﬁ cationis sed propter ornatum sermonis […] ita 
cum verba vocalia et participia sua non fuerunt propter necessitatem signiﬁ cationis nec 
expressionis inventa, ideo in mente non correspondet illis talis multitudo conceptum».

422 
ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
therefore preserves more inferences solely on the basis of logical 
form than retaining the less fully articulated expression will11.
We should be careful here, however. It is difﬁ cult to understand how 
ML can be made more or less explicit. On the one hand, it is not a concept-
script, it cannot be more or less explicit as a notation can be. On the other 
hand, it has exactly the features needed to the interpretation of CL sentences 
and to the explanation of their logical relations. Otherwise, we would have 
a feature of CL whose intentionality is not accounted for by some mental 
feature, which is impossible in Ockham’s framework. 
If the role of the ML is to explain the truth-conditions and the 
inferential patterns of sentences in CL, T1 is perfectly ﬁ t. It doesn’t seem 
that a criterion such as T2 is required. Every truth-relevant feature is 
present both in 5 and 7, and there is no reason to think that the time of 
evaluation, say, should be represented by an unbound morpheme, as in 7, 
instead of a bound morpheme, as in 5. In both cases, the thought is sensitive 
to this dimension of evaluation, and nothing else is needed. If we still feel 
uncomfortable with the underdetermination of the theory concerning the 
structure of the ML, we have to ﬁ nd another reason for our uneasiness. And 
there is another reason for it.
3. Mental language as Deep Structure
T1 reﬂ ects the idea that the ML should explain our capacity to think 
about the world and, at the sentential level, this capacity is captured by a 
truth-conditional criterion. We may want however more than that: ML should 
represent what is actually in our minds, and that seems to explain the need to 
ﬁ nd a «mental grammar». The parallel between this «mental grammar» and 
Deep Structure, or one version of it, has seemed evident to more than one 
commentator. Miko Yrjönsuuri, for instance, states the parallel quite directly:
Both in Chomsky’s discussion of seventeenth-century linguistics 
and in Ockham’s treatment of mental language, the main focus is 
precisely on the deep structures that appear in the mental language12.

(ed.), Representation and Objects of Thought in Medieval Philosophy, Ashgate,

THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
423
While some the constraints of Deep Structure are not met by Ockham’s 
theory, such as the need for transformation rules leading from the 
underlying mental reality to the «actual physical object»13, thinking of the 
ML as Deep Structure gives a clear motivation for the search for a mental 
grammar. If the ML is to represent the «underlying mental reality» of our 
thoughts14, it must a have a fully determinate structure. Deep structure is a 
representational level that plays an explanatory role in the understanding 
of a sentence not unlike that of the ML, and it may have a structure distinct 
from the one that the eyes, or the ears, can meet, which is also the case of 
ML – think of the mental counterpart of 3 and 4. The association between 
ML and Deep Structure, or a certain version of it15, is not far-fetched, and it 
may help us to answer why we wanted a more articulated structure. 
Unlike Adams’ suggestion, Deep Structure is not more or less explicit; 
it has the structure responding to certain theoretical ends, especially (at least 
in a version closer to Ockham’s concerns) an explanatory role accounting 
for the interpretation of sentences. The idea that truth-conditional criteria, 
13 «In the case of each of the sentences just discussed, the deep structure 
consists of a system of propositions, and it does not receive a direct, point-by-point 
expression in the actual physical object that is produced. To form an actual sentence 
from such an underlying system of elementary propositions, we apply certain rules (in 
modern terms, grammatical transformations).», N. CHOMSKY, Cartesian Linguistics, 
Cybereditions, Christchurch 2002 (1966), p. 75. Notice that this is the text in which 
Chomsky talks about «seventeenth-century linguistics» mentioned by Yrjönsuuri. The 
point is important, since there are different versions of Deep Structure, and we should 
not loose track of which version is aimed at; see note 15 below.
14 «It is sometimes possible to express the deep structure in a more explicit way, 
in the surface form, as when I reduce the above example [“Invisible God created the

visible’». But it constitutes an underlying mental reality –a mental accompaniment 
to the utterance– whether or not the surface form of the utterance that is produced 
corresponds to it in a simple, point-by-point manner.», CHOMSKY, Cartesian Linguistics, 
p. 74.
15 «When CL was published in 1966, the theory of UG looked quite different than 
it does now. At that time, and in a way that was similar to the Port-Royal grammarians 
discussed in the text, Chomsky hypothesized that languages are the same in their “Deep 
Structure” and differ in their “Surface Structure.” Deep Structures are ‘meanings’ 
and determine “semantic interpretation”, and Surface Structures are ‘sounds’ and 
determine “phonetic interpretation”. Deep and Surface structures are linked by 
“optional transformations”». J. MCGILVRAY, «Introduction for Cybereditions», in 
CHOMSKY, Cartesian Linguistics, p. 29.

such as T1, lead to the underlying mental reality of our thoughts is clearly 
articulated in a seminal paper by Gilbert Harman, that proposes a link 
between the Chomskyan project and the so-called Davidsonian program. 
Here is Harman’s description of the interpretation of a syntactically 
ambiguous sentence:
[…] when quantiﬁ ers appear in deep structure, ambiguity of scope 
becomes a form of syntactic ambiguity. The sentence
8. Jones believes someone to be a spy
may mean that there is someone in particular that Jones believes to 
be a spy or it may mean that Jones believes that there is at least one 
spy. On the new theory, this difference is reﬂ ected in there being two 
possible deep structures for (8): Roughly
9. (Someone x) (Jones believes (x is a spy)).
10. (Jones believes (Someone x) (x is a spy))16. 
The idea that syntactically ambiguous CL sentences correspond to distinct 
mental sentences is clearly exposed by Normore, so clearly that it is worth 
quoting at some length:
Expositio is a natural result of the recognition that the surface 
grammar of a sentence is not always a reliable guide either to its truth 
conditions or its inferential connections to other sentences. Once the 
distinction between surface grammar and deep or ‘logical’ grammar 
is recognized it isn’t surprising to ﬁ nd philosophers, particularly 
logicians, attempting to make the logical form of sentences explicit. 
Fourteenth century theorists were further encouraged in this by 
their realism about the language of thought. For example, Ockham, 
who discusses the matter at some length, seems to have thought 
that mental language contains no sentence whose surface grammar 
and logical form differ. Thus expounding or exposing a spoken or 
written sentence is just ﬁ nding a second equivalent complex spoken 
or written sentence whose structure mirrors that of the mental 
sentence to which the ﬁ rst is subordinated17.

THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
425
The argument can be presented as follows:
a. Sentences of a CL may be structurally ambiguous;
b.  It is possible to ﬁ nd an explanation of the semantics of such 
sentences;
c.  This explanation will lead to a more explicit representation of their 
readings in a CL (i.e., the expositio);
d.  The intentionality of CL sentences is explained by the subordination 
of their components to components of ML;
e.  By (c) and (d), the more explicit representation of the semantics 
of CL corresponds to the structure of the sentences of ML to 
which it is subordinated («Thus expounding or exposing a spoken 
or written sentence is just ﬁ nding a second equivalent complex 
spoken or written sentence whose structure mirrors that of the 
mental sentence to which the ﬁ rst is subordinated»).
Although (a)-(c) and (d) are true for Ockham, (e) does not follow. More 
precisely, the expositio of a sentence does not identify its mental structure. 
In many occasions Ockham talks about structurally ambiguous sentences 
and explains their semantics, in none of them does he say that there are 
mental counterparts with unambiguous structures corresponding to the 
each distinct reading. Let us take a look at such cases.
Ockham identiﬁ es three kinds of equivocation, as it is usually the 
case in the Middle Ages. The ﬁ rst kind concerns cases of ambiguity due 
to the multiple and unconnected senses of a word (quando aliqua dictio 
est aequivoca a casu)18. The second type of equivocation covers cases 
due to words with distinct, but connected meanings19. The third mode of 
equivocation corresponds to situations in which the sentential context allows 
a word to supposit for different things, without it having distinct meanings20. 
18 Ockham, SL III-4, 2, l. 48.
19 «Circa secundum modum aequivocationis est sciendum quod tunc est secundus 
modus aequivocationis quando eadem dictio primo et principaliter imponitur ad 
signiﬁ candum vel consigniﬁ candum aliquid vel aliqua, et secundario propter aliquam 
attributionem alterius rei ad primum signiﬁ catum imponitur ad signiﬁ candum aliud vel 
alia, ita quod in aliquibus propositionibus utimur illo vocabulo aliter quam primo erat 
institutum, et non in omnibus.», Ockham, SL III-4, 3, l. 1-8.
20 «Circa tertium modum aequivocationis est primo sciendum quod tunc est tertius 
modus aequivocationis quando aliqua dictio non accipitur pro diversis signifìcatis, sed 

426 
ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
This is the case, for instance, of sentences in which one extreme is of second 
imposition, so that the other one may supposit either personally or materially 
(e.g., in ‘man is a word’, ‘man’ may be taken in material or in personal 
supposition)21. If one considers it to be a case of structural ambiguity, or at 
least as a situation in which the ambiguity vanishes, once the «logical form» 
of the sentence is made explicit, then something is amiss with Normore’s 
argument, for the third mode of equivocation occurs in ML22. 
One may think that syntactically ambiguous sentences are cases of 
amphiboly only, and not of equivocation23. In the ﬁ fth chapter of the Summa 
Logicae III-4, dedicated to the ﬁ rst mode of amphiboly, the different 
readings of sentences are made explicit by paraphrases, pretty much 
as (c) in the argument above. Ockham says that the interpreter chooses 
the interpretation of underdetermined CL sentences24, and designates 
ex hoc solum quod alicui comparatur quod non plus pertinet ad primarium signiﬁ catum 
quam ad secundarium. Et iste modus non accidit  ex hoc quod vox potest signiﬁ care 
diversa, sicut contigit in duobus primis modis, sed ex hoc quod  eadem vox potest 
supponere pro diversis.», Ockham, SL III-4, 4, l. 1-8.
21 On Ockham’s theory of material supposition, see C. PANACCIO – E. PERINI-
SANTOS, «Guillaume d’Ockham et la Suppositio Materialis», Vivarium, 42 (2004) 
202-224.
22 «Et est notandum quod iste tertius modus aequivocationis potest reperiri in 
propositione pure mentali, quamvis duo primi modi non habeant locum nisi in signis 
ad placitum institutis.», Ockham, SL III-4, 4, l. 113-115.
23 Notice however that Ockham doesn’t seem to think much of this distinction; 
see Ockham, SL III-4, 7, l. 67-70.
24 «Et si quaeratur quare tales propositiones sunt distinguendae, de quibus 
dantur praedictae regulae, dicendum est quod sicut non potest dari ratio quare 
aliqua dictio est aequivoca nisi voluntas utentium, ita non potest dari aliqua ratio 
quare oratio est aequivoca nisi voluntas utentium. Et ideo quia diversi ex tali 
oratione prolata diversos seusus tales concipiunt, ideo talis oratio est distinguenda 
secundum amphiboliam, secundum doctrinam Boethii, in libro Divisionum, dicentis: 
In ambiguis uterque auditor rationabiliter se ipsum intellexisse arbitratur, ut cum 
dicit quis ‘audio Graecos vicisse Romanos’, unus potest inteIligere quod Graeci 
Romanos vicerunt, alius e converso. Ita est de talibus propositionibus, quod prolata 
hac propositione ‘scio quod omnis homo est animaI’, unus potest intelligere quod 
‘scio istam propositionem: omnis homo est animaI’, alius potest intelligere ‘scio de 
quolibet homine quod ipse est animal’», Ockham, SL III-4, 5, l. 122-135. Notice that 
the second and the third modes of amphiboly are not relevant to our concerns; see 
Ockham, SL III-4, 6, l. 3-6, for the second mode, and Ockham, SL III-4, 7, 2-11, for 
the third one.

the intended reading by ‘denotatur’25. Neither explanation requires an 
unambiguous mental sentence, in the interpreter’s or in the speaker’s mind, 
corresponding to the intended reading. Modal sentences provide another 
interesting example. Modal sentences sine dicto, i.e., sentences in which 
the modal component is a verb or an adverbial expression, can only be 
understood in sensu divisionis26. The sentence 
11.  creans potest non esse Deus
is true iff
12. hoc non est Deus
is true, the demonstrative in 12 suppositing for the subject of 1127. Although 
the sentences in the explanans and in the explanandum have different 
syntactical structures, there is no hint in Ockham’s text that 12 gives the 
structure of the mental sentence corresponding to 11. The expression is, 
again, ‘denotatur’28, that carries no psychological implication. Again, 
‘denotatur’ is used for modal sentences with a dictum, which can be 
understood both in sensu divisionis and in sensu compositionis, and 
therefore exhibit a structural ambiguity29.
25 Ockham, SL III-4, 5, l. 54-66. See also, e.g., SL II, 9, l. 11-38. Although ‘denotari’ 
is not usually the focus of attention of commentators, the few remarks that I could ﬁ nd 
about it do not explain it in terms of ML counterparts of CL sentences. See, e.g., E. 
KARGER, A Study in William of Ockham’s Modal Logic, Ph.D.  Dissertation, Berkeley

I could not ﬁ nd any textual evidence supporting Normore’s argument: 
when Ockham comes close to what could count as making «the logical form 
of sentences explicit», that is, when he examines structurally ambiguous 
sentences, he doesn’t make reference to unambiguous mental counterparts. 
There are different interpretations of CL sentences, but they do not 
correspond to distinct mental sentences whose structures are unambiguous. 
It seems wiser to adopt a solution proposed by Spade:
[…] a mental sentence involving equivocation in the third mode 
would be one the user of which has acquired a disposition to assign 
the equivocal term in the sentence one set of supposita, and also 
a disposition to assign it another set of supposita. On any given 
occasion either one of these sets may be actually assigned without 
the other30.
This interpretive solution seems closer to Ockham. Be that as it may, 
if Normore’s argument is correct, we should expect to ﬁ nd something 
analogous to Harman’s requirement in Ockham’s work. I could not ﬁ nd 
such texts.
Let us recap. T1 establishes that there are morphemes for each truth-
relevant aspect of sentences in CL, but it doesn’t provide a criterion to 
choose between morphemes, be they bound or free, having the same 
impact on the truth-conditions of sentences. That is why it doesn’t establish 
whether mental sentences always have a tertium adiacens or not. I can see 
no theoretical reason nor textual evidence to think that Ockham accepts 
a more strict principle such as T2. Even if we ﬁ x the lexicon, Ockham 
doesn’t seem to think that different mental structures correspond to each 
distinct reading of structurally ambiguous CL sentences, so the third mode 
of equivocation belongs to the mental realm, and structurally ambiguous 
modal sentences are not said to have unambiguous mental counterparts 
corresponding to the different readings they may have. Moreover, when he 
explains the truth-conditions of modal sentences sine dicto using sentences 
with quite different structures, he doesn’t say that he is explaining the 
structure of the underlying mental reality.

THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE

4. The Buridanian way
There is another way to get a more ﬁ ne-grained structure of the ML, 
but we will ﬁ nd it in John Buridan, not (or at least not as clearly) in William 
of Ockham. Buridan postulates a more articulated version of the ML, 
or, at least as far as the copula is concerned, he does think that the more 
articulated form corresponds to the mental sentence –he chooses 7 over 5. 
In sentences such as 5, the copula is implicit:
I say therefore that an atomic sentence must have a subject, a 
predicate and a copula. And those three are sometimes implicit in 
one single word, as when I say ‘tonat’, ‘pluit’ […] Sometimes, the 
subject is explicit, but the predicate and the copula are implied by a 
single word, as in ‘homo currit’ […]31.
To say that the predicate and the copula are implied is to say that they 
exist in the ML. But the reason why we have to choose the more articulated 
version of mental sentences has nothing to do with truth-theoretical criteria, 
such as T1 and T2, but rather with the layered structure of mental sentences. 
A mental sentence always has a copula as a tertium adiacens because it is 
formed by an operation that takes as input subsentential components and 
returns a truth-evaluable item; the copula corresponds to an operation of 
the intellect over other operations without which there is no propositio:
The combination of simple concepts is called a ‘mental expression’ 
(mentalis oratio) [and results from] compounding or dividing by 
means of the second operation of the intellect, and the terms of such 
an expression are the simple concepts that the intellect puts together 
or separates32.
31 «Dico igitur quod propositio categorica debet habere subiectum et praedicatum 
et copulam. Et haec tria aliquando in uno verbo implicita sunt, ut si dico “tonat”, 
“pluit” […] Aliquando autem subiectum est explicitum sed praedicatum et copula 
in eodem verbo implicata sunt, ut “homo currit” […]», Ed. by H. HUBIEN, Iohannis 
Buridani Tractatus de Consequentiis, Publications Universitaires – Vander-Oyez, 
Louvain – Paris 1976, cap. 8, pp. 411-417.

Press, New Haven 2001 [hereafter, Transl. KLIMA], p. 11; «Mentalis oratio vocatur 
simplicium conceptuum complexio componendo vel dividendo per secundam 
operationem intellectus. Cuius orationis termini sunt conceptus simplices quos 

430 
ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
The copula is called a «complexive concept», or rather different 
copulas such as ‘is’ and ‘is not’, being different ways to put together the 
concepts forming the sentences, are complexive concepts33. As a matter of 
fact, Ockham has the same thesis concerning the copula:
[…] the union of the extremes of a mental proposition is the 
syncategorematic concept of the copulative verb, i.e., the verb that 
joins the subject with the predicate34.
To see the copula as a second operation of the intellect, of course, is 
not at all uncommon in the Middle Ages35. The question is how it connects 
with the development of the idea of a ML. More precisely, we have to 
ask whether this claim gives us a more ﬁ ne-grained structure of mental 
sentences.
It is clear that, for Buridan, the answer is positive. A similar reasoning 
applies to Ockham, as has been suggested by Panaccio, that extends it to 
other mental syncategorems:
[…] the mental proposition is composed out of distinct units just as 
the spoken or written sentence is, and one of them corresponds to 
intellectus componit vel dividit». John Buridan, Summulae de Propositionibus, Ed. 
by R. VAN DER LECQ, Brepols, Turnhout 2005 [hereafter, Summ. Prop.], 1.1.6., p. 16, 
l. 6-9.

terminos mentales in formando propositiones mentales, et illi modi complectendi sunt

addit supra primam operationem». John Buridan, Summulae de Suppositionibus, Ed.

Quodl. V, qu. 8, l. 119-129, quoted at the note 8 above.
35 Abelard is a crucial author for this theory; see J. MARENBON, The Philosophy of 
Peter Abelard, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1997, pp. 180-181. Aquinas’ 
is a typical XIIIth theory, see A. KENNY, Aquinas on Being, Oxford University Press, 
Oxford 2002, pp. 56-57, and G. KLIMA, «Aquinas’ Theory of the Copula and the 
Analogy of Being», Logical Analysis and History of Philosophy, 5 (2002) 159-176.

 
THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
431
the copula. The same thing, moreover, must hold mutatis mutandis 
for the other syncategorematic logical acts such as negation, 
conjunction, quantiﬁ cation, and so on36.
This is a quite interesting point, and the extension Panaccio suggests for 
Ockham can be found in explicit terms in Buridan:
And so also the words ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if’, ‘therefore’, and the like 
designate complexive concepts that combine several propositions 
or terms at once in the mind, but nothing further outside the mind37.
In all those cases, «complexive concepts» give the structure of the sentence, 
even when they are not verbs. A complexive concept may take as input 
subsentential components and return a truth-evaluable item, or take as 
input sentences and return another sentence, i.e., another truth-evaluable 
item38. The result is a ML more structured than what we can get using 
T1. A more ﬁ ne-grained structure is not obtained, however, by a semantic 
argument tracking truth-conditions or inferential patterns, but by what we 
may call a noetic argument. 
This argument doesn’t seem to give us different mental structures 
for every structurally ambiguous CL sentence, that is, it doesn’t ﬁ t the 
idea behind Normore’s association between ML and Deep Structure. Let 
us a take a look at some cases in which we might expect an explanation 
36 PANACCIO, Ockham on Concepts, p. 153.
37 Transl. KLIMA, p. 234. «Et etiam istae dictiones ‘et’, ‘vel’, ‘si’, ‘ergo’ et 
huiusmodi designant  conceptus complexivos plurium propositionem simul vel 
terminorum in mente  et nihil ad extra». Sum. Supp. 4.2.3., p. 20, l. 8-10.
38 This is not an accurate description. The components out of which a molecular 
sentence (a hypothetical propositio, in medieval terms) is formed are not themselves 
sentences,  i.e., are not truth-evaluable items; see G. KLIMA, «John Buridan and the 
Force-Content Distinction», in MAIERÙ – VALENTE (eds.), Medieval Theories on 
Assertive and Non-assertive Language, op. cit., pp. 415-428. That doesn’t afect the 
main point of the argument, for it is still the case that the complexive concepts of the 
molecular sentence are higher order operations acting on lower order operations of the 
intellect. What is at stake in Klima’s paper is the distinction between the structuring of 
the propositio and the assertive force. The copula corresponds to the ﬁ rst aspect, not 
to the second one. On this point, see also P. PÉREZ-ILZARBE, «Complexio, Enunciatio, 
Assensus: the Role of Propositions in Knowledge According to John Buridan», in 
MAIERÙ – VALENTE (eds.), Medieval Theories on Assertive and Non-assertive Language, 
op. cit., pp. 404-406. 

432 
ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
of ambiguous mental structures in terms of unambiguous mental 
counterparts. Concerning distinctions in scope, Buridan follows the order 
of CL sentences, and therefore there is no particular role for ML39. Another 
example (that we may consider as a case) of ambiguity concerns sentences 
with appellative terms, such as 
13. album heri fuit albus.
13 means that what is presently white or what was white yesterday was 
black yesterday. Buridan has a clear explanation for this case: 
[…] we should note that appellative terms appellate differently with 
respect to verbs in the present or the future tense, or with respect to 
the verb ‘can’ or ‘possibly is’ […] the subject appellates its thing 
indifferently, in a disjunctive manner, covering the present time 
and the time of the verb, and this is also the case with supposition. 
Therefore, ‘A white [thing] yesterday was black’ is true if whiteness 
now pertains to the thing that yesterday was black, even if yesterday 
it did not pertain to it. And for this reason ‘A white [thing] yesterday 
was black’ is analyzed as: ‘What is white or yesterday was white 
was black yesterday’40. 
39 For Buridan, in modal sentences in sensu compositionis the mode is a predicate, 
and in sentences in sensu divisionis, the mode is a modiﬁ er of the copula. Since the 
predicate and the copula are different operations of the intellect, they correspond to 
distinct mental sentences, but this is not a case of ambiguous CL sentences signifying 
distinct and unambiguous mental sentences, for the written and spoken sentences have 
already different structures; Buridan, Tract. Cons., II, 2, 7-11; 16-18. For a different 
ambiguity in scope treated in the same way, see John Buridan,  Summulae de Practica 
Sophismatum., Ed. by F. PIRONET, Brepols, Turnhout 2004, [hereafter, Soph.] IV, p. 81, 
l. 20 - p. 82, l. 4. Since the structure of ML follows, in such situations, that of spoken and 
written languages, Joël Biard is right in his claim that Buridan «met constamment au 
premier plan le langage parlé.», J. BIARD, Science et Nature: La Théorie Buridanienne 
du Savoir, Vrin, Paris 2012, p. 111. 
40 Transl. KLIMA, pp. 880-881. «[…] termini appellativi differenter appellant 
respectu verbi praesentis temporis de inesse et respectu verbi praeteriti vel futuri 
temporis aut huius verbi ‘potest’ aut ‘possibile est’. […] subiectum appellat rem suam 
indifferenter modo disiunctivo pro tempore praesenti et pro tempore verbi, sicut etiam 
est de suppositione. Unde haec est vera ‘album fuit heri nigrum’ si ei quod heri fuit 
nigrum adiaceat nunc albedo, licet heri non adiacebat sibi. Propter quod exponitur 
‘album fuit heri nigrum’, id est ‘quod est album vel fuit album fuit heri nigrum’».

THE UNDERDETERMINATION OF MENTAL LANGUAGE 
433
There is no hint that, at the mental level, there is a sentence with only 
one reading, i.e., either that what is presently white was black yesterday or 
that what yesterday was white was black yesterday. 
Although it is certainly the case that the noetic argument allows a 
more articulated vision of mental sentences than T1, it does not fulﬁ ll the 
expectation that explaining semantic ambiguities «is just ﬁ nding a second 
equivalent complex spoken or written sentence whose structure mirrors 
that of the mental sentence to which the ﬁ rst is subordinated».
5. Conclusion
We have reached some modest, and mostly negative results. The 
ﬁ rst one is that the semantic criterion proposed by Ockham does not 
allow a complete identiﬁ cation of the structure of mental sentences. It’s 
in particular unable to say whether a mental sentence always have a 
copula or may be composed by a verb and predicate. While commentators 
have usually acknowledged this point, some have also seen it as ﬂ aw in 
Ockham’s theory. Two ways have been proposed to amend it. This ﬁ rst 
one has been suggested by Adams: ML should have the structure making 
«the logical form of an expression fully explicit». The application of this 
criterion, however, is not entirely clear, since the ML is not a notation 
that can be made more or less explicit. Another suggestion also considers 
that the ML should have the structure of a fully disambiguated language, 
but for a different reason: ML is associated with Deep Structure, whose 
construction is guided by semantic criteria. Normore has developed this 
second strategy quite explicitly. Following his lead, we should expect 
that structurally ambiguous sentences in CL correspond to distinct mental 
sentences. However, the texts in which Ockham deals with structurally 
ambiguous sentences give us no reason to think to every distinct reading 
of ambiguous CL sentences corresponds to a different mental structure. 
Moreover, Ockham does accept that the third mode of equivocation is 
present in ML. The second result is that we cannot extend Ockham’s theory 
to ﬁ nd truth-theoretical criteria able to give us a more ﬁ ne-grained structure 
of ML. It seems wiser to follow Spade: speakers have the disposition to 
make different interpretations of the same structure. 
There is however another way to get a more articulated view of the 
ML, that we can ﬁ nd quite clearly in Buridan, but also to a certain extent in 

434 
ERNESTO PERINI-SANTOS
Ockham. The idea applies neatly to the question whether a mental sentence 
has a copula as tertium adiacens or is composed by a predicate and a verb. 
The Buridanian answer is that a mental sentence is always composed by a 
copula as a third element of the propositio. This is so because the copula 
gives the sentence its unity –a copula is a second operation of the intellect, 
taking as input the extremes of the sentence and returning a truth-evaluable 
item. The reasoning can be extended to other syncategorems, that take as 
input sentences and return other sentences. We may call this latter strategy 
the noetic argument, as opposed to the semantic argument. Nevertheless, it 
cannot be extended to every semantic distinction, and, therefore, it won’t 
give as much structural distinctions in the ML as there are readings of 
sentences. On the one hand, some CL sentences considered by some to be 
structurally ambiguous –e.g., modal sentences apparently having divided 
and composed readings– are not thought to be so by Buridan. In such cases, 
there is no speciﬁ c role for mental sentences, whose syntax simply mirrors 
that of written and spoken ones. On the other hand, some ambiguous 
sentences, such as those involving appellative terms, have their semantics 
explained by Buridan without the suggestion that, at the mental level, there 
are unambiguous counterparts for each reading.
Again, the result is rather modest: we don’t have everything we might 
have expected from Ockham’s ML. More importantly, the different ways 
to determine the structure of the ML –the semantic argument and the noetic 
argument–, even if not incompatible, do not answer the same questions. 
Some of the things that one might have expected to get from the semantic 
side won’t ﬁ nd a response in the noetic strategy. And none of them will 
lead to a ML as a language whose semantics is «fully explicit», at least in 
Adams’ or Normore’s construals of this requirement41.

JEAN BURIDAN : UNE PHILOSOPHIE DU LANGAGE 
ORDINAIRE ?
La logique buridanienne comporte des aspects formels, mais elle 
repose fondamentalement sur toute une philosophie du langage. Comme 
toutes les logiques médiévales, sans doute ; un peu plus que d’autres, 
peut-être. Et dans ce cadre Jean Buridan accorde une grande attention au 
matériau linguistique : ordre des mots dans les propositions parlées, cas 
grammaticaux, etc. Peut-être est-ce parce que sa principale œuvre logique, 
les Petites sommes de logique, se présente comme un commen taire des 
Tractatus parisienses, traités qui s’inscrivent dans la tradition des manuels 
de logique élaborés à partir de Pierre d’Espagne. Mais cela même a déjà 
une signiﬁ cation théorique : alors qu’Albert de Saxe compose une logique 
modelée sur la Somme de logique ockhamiste, Buridan fait quant à lui un 
choix qui le conduit à partir du langage parlé et même de sa dimension 
phonique. 
Il existe déjà quelques études générales sur la philosophie du langage 
de Buridan1. On a aussi souvent étudié en détail sa théorie de la signiﬁ cation, 
sa théorie de la supposition, sa conception originale de l’appellation ou de

la supposition naturelle. Mais lorsqu’il présente les éléments fondamentaux 
du langage, Buridan considère celui-ci non seulement comme porteur de 
propriétés sémantiques, donc d’une fonction informative et cognitive, mais 
tout autant comme vecteur de communication entre plusieurs locuteurs. 
C’est ce second aspect que je voudrais reprendre pour voir comment il 
conduit à inﬂ échir quelques thèmes traditionnels. Je ne veux pas considérer 
ici telle ou telle procédure de formalisation mise en œuvre pour exhiber 
la structure sémantique latente, mais souligner l’ancrage dans le langage 
naturel, et même pour une part, l’usage ordinaire du langage. 
La ﬁ gure du destinataire
Un aspect de la théorie buridanienne du langage a souvent été étudié : 
la dialectique entre la norme et l’usage dans la constitution des relations 
sémantiques, supposition ou signiﬁ cation2. Lorsqu’il analyse la valeur 
par défaut du mot, la virtus sermonis, Jean Buridan insiste sur le fait que 
la supposition des termes est à considérer selon une certaine relation entre 
l’intention de l’auteur et le sens des termes tel qu’il est établi. Mais ce qui 
a été moins souligné, parce que c’est au second plan, et qui n’est pas moins 
important, c’est que Buridan s’installe dans une relation dialogique, au sens 
où il faut prendre en compte l’interaction entre le locuteur et un ou plusieurs 
interlocuteurs. Dans les Questions sur la Métaphysique, l’exigence de faire

sermonis and the Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction », Vivarium, 49 (2011) 214-239. 
Ce problème est généralement traité en rapport avec la position de Buridan concernant 
le statut du 29 décembre 1340. Sur cet aspect, qui fait l’objet d’âpres discussions, voir 
les contributions de W. J. COURTENAY, qui ont été reprises dans le volume Ockham and 
Ockhamism : Studies in the Dissemination and Impact of his Thought, Brill, Leiden-
Boston 2008. Voir aussi J. M. M. H. THIJSSEN, « Once Again the Ockhamist Statutes of

des distinctions de sens à propos de certaines propositions, est justiﬁ ée ainsi : 
« […] periret sepe disputatio et collocutio hominum ad invicem, quod tamen est 
inconveniens, cum orationes sint institue ad signiﬁ candum propter conferre ad 
invicem »3. Cet aspect dialogique est souligné par l’appel récurrent au schéma 
explicatif qui fait de la dispute obligationnelle le modèle de constitution de la 
valeur du mot. Dans le passage du Traité des suppositions qui examine la valeur 
des mots, ce modèle n’apparaît que dans l’énoncé de la «troisième opinion», 
celle à laquelle Buridan déclare adhérer. Elle pose que pour la supposition 
et pour la signi ﬁ cation (in supponendo vel signiﬁ cando), le son vocal n’a de 
valeur propre que par nous, ex nobis4 : « Unde per conventum disputantium, 
ut in obligationibus, sibi possumus imponere novam signiﬁ cationem et non uti 
communi eius signiﬁ catione […]5. »
Le passage est connu. Il suppose en premier lieu la convergence de 
l’idée boécienne d’institution des noms avec la notion d’imposition dans 
la théorie des obligations. Dans cette théorie des obligations telle qu’elle a 
été formulée au début du XIVe siècle, notamment avec le traité de Gautier 
Burley, parmi les six espèces d’obligations ﬁ gure l’institutio, qui est 
l’assignation d’un sens à un terme pour le temps de la dispute6. 
Ce n’est pas le seul endroit où Buridan met en avant un tel modèle 
pour penser les phénomènes sémantiques : dans les Petites sommes, c’était 
le cas dès le Traité des propositions, même si là Buridan semblait opposer 
les deux types d’imposition : 
vox signiﬁ cativa ad placitum aliquando est eiusdem signiﬁ cationis 
uno toto magno idiomate, ut «homo» vel «asinus» apud omnes

latinos. Aliquando autem pro aliquo pauco tempore imponitur ad 
aliquam determinatam signiﬁ cationem ex conventu et concordia 
disputantium, ut cum dicimus quod A sit homo, B animal, C lapis et 
huiusmodi, sicut saepe faciunt doctores et disputatores7.
Et déjà dans les Questions longues sur le Peri hermeneias, dans un passage 
sur lequel nous aurons à revenir : 
Modo ad placitum nostrum possumus inponere voces ad 
signiﬁ candum. Ymmo tu sepe inponis voces istas a, b, c, ad 
signiﬁ candum de novo et novas signiﬁ cationes. Ut in geometria 
dicimus quod trianguli unus angulus sit a, alius b, tertius c. Et in 
Priorum quod a sit predicatum et b subiectum, et ita de aliis8.
On en trouve aussi de nombreuses occurrences dans le chapitre 6 des 
Sophismes, qui traite de la signiﬁ cation à plaisir du mot9.
On interprète généralement ce modèle comme une accentuation du 
caractère radicalement arbitraire (et pas seulement conventionnel) de la 
signiﬁ cation10. Et c’est bien ainsi qu’il est utilisé dans le chapitre 6 des 
Sophismes où Buridan multiplie les analyses paradoxales destinées à 
montrer qu’on peut subordonner n’importe quel son vocal, simple ou 
complexe, à un concept. Mais ce faisant, on oblitère un peu une autre 
dimension de modèle, à savoir que la dispute suppose deux inter locuteurs, 
dont les échanges sont régis par certaines règles. Parler de dispute, ce 
n’est pas seulement dire que je peux donner n’importe quel sens à un son 
vocal, en fonction du concept auquel je le subordonne, il faut encore que 
le destinataire puisse répondre ou réagir à ma propo sition. Il faut qu’il

9 On pourrait peut-être se demander quelle est sa référence en la matière, puisque, 
pour autant que l’on sache, Buridan n’a jamais rédigé de traité sur les obligations. Le 
traité de Burley (1302), qui représente la théorie standard avant les développements 
propres aux Calculateurs d’Oxford, peut sans doute servir de point de repère, à moins 
que Buridan ne se réfère tout simplement à une pratique usuelle de la faculté des arts.

accepte, au moins par convention ou par jeu, ce que j’ai posé comme cadre 
de l’échange. Il est vrai que cet aspect est moins mis en avant, mais il sous-
tend l’argumentation. J’en indiquerai quelques manifestations.
En premier lieu, on peut mentionner la formulation même de la 
question 5 dans les Questions sur Porphyre, qui se place du point de vue 
du répondant : 
Consequenter quaeritur quinto utrum ista propositio «animal est 
genus», vel ista «homo est species» debeat concedi vel negari 
loquendo simpliciter sine aliqua determinatione vel distinctione11.
La première réponse, qui s’avérera insufﬁ sante et qui est antérieure à 
l’introduction de la notion de virtus sermonis, repose sur un choix inter-
prétatif de l’auditeur : 
Quaestio videtur prima facie statim esse soluta dicendo quod omnes 
accipientes istum terminum «homo» secundum suppositionem 
materialem debent istam concedere «homo est species» et omnes 
accipientes istum terminum «homo» secundum suppositionem 
personalem debent eam negare12.
Et la position ﬁ nale est à nouveau exprimée du point de vue du récepteur, 
même si évidemment il y a réciprocité entre la liberté du locuteur, sur 
laquelle l’accent est mis dans l’argumentation, et le choix interprétatif du 
récepteur :
Et ego statim respondeo quod numquam ad hoc virtus sermonis nos 
obligavit, immo aliquando debemus sermones recipere secundum 
proprios sensus eorum et aliquando secundum sensus improprios, 
ut parabolicos vel ironicos, vel alios etiam valde remotos a sensibus 
propriis13.
C’est bien sur le destinataire (maintenant lecteur plus qu’auditeur en vérité) 
que repose le jugement sans cesse reformulé sur la vérité d’un énoncé :

Et si legentes libros doctorum aliter reciperent sermones quam 
credant eos esse positos a doctoribus, ipsi essent protervi et dyscoli 
et non digni studere vel legere libros philosophorum14.
Une proposition est vraie ou fausse non pas en soi, non pas seulement 
si elle formulée (clause répétée par Guillaume d’Ockham, et qui est 
implicitement requise chez Buridan), mais encore pour celui qui la reçoit 
– quoi qu’il en soit ici de la valeur et du sens propre :
Et sic, cum dicimus propositionem esse veram de virtute sermonis, 
nos debemus intelligere per hoc quod ipsa esset vera recipienti eam 
secundum sensum eius proprium ; et cum dicimus propositionem 
esse falsam de virtute sermonis, debemus per hoc intelligere 
quod esset falsa recipienti eam secundum sensum proprium, licet 
simpliciter sit vera, quia recipimus eam secundum alium sensum, 
secundum quem est vera15.
Je ne veux pas suggérer que cette réception serait livrée à l’arbitraire 
– la liberté de l’interprétation est encadrée, et les possibilités inscrites dans 
l’énoncé même. Mais je veux souligner le rôle décisif du récepteur dans 
le processus interprétatif qui fait que l’énoncé sera en dernière analyse 
dit vrai ou faux : «[…] eadem propositio vocalis potest esse mihi vera et 
tibi falsa»16. La même afﬁ rmation se retrouve dans la 5e conclusion du 6e 
chapitre des Sophismes17, mais Buridan y franchit un pas supplémentaire 
en posant que la même proposition écrite (et il s’agit de la même instance 
singulière) peut être simultanément vraie pour moi et fausse pour quelqu’un 
d’autre :
14 Ibid., p. 145. C’est moi qui souligne (J. B.). On notera que le programme 
interprétatif concerne ici la philosophie et non plus seulement la théologie – la Bible et 
les Évangiles sont évoqués dans la phrase suivante.

16 Ibid., qu. 5, p. 145 ; «Unde ista propositio “homo est species” posita a 
Porphyrio est mihi vera, quia recipio eam secundum suppositionem materialem et sic 
designat mihi mentalem non falsam sed veram in mente mea ; sed forte est tibi falsa, 
quia non vis eam recipere nisi secundum sensum proprium, secundum quem designat 
tibi mentalem falsam» (ibid.) – je corrige le texte édité en suprimant une ligne répétée 
(J. B.).

[…] si scribatur in pariete quod homo est asinus, illa est falsa 
mihi, qui sum de isto idiomate, et est tibi vera, supposito quod tu 
sis de quodam idiomate alio in quo iste terminus «asinus» praecise 
signiﬁ cat idem quod signiﬁ cat nobis iste terminus «animal»18.
Rénovation permanente et négociation du sens
On ne peut rendre compte de la philosophie buridanienne du langage, 
telle qu’elle se déploie notamment dans les Sophismes, en soulignant 
seulement la radicalisation des expressions concernant l’arbitraire du 
signe. Assurément, celle-ci est réelle ; citons le cas posé dès le premier 
sophisme du chapitre 6 : « […] posito casu quod tu et alii ad placitum 
velitis mutare nomen tuum et imponere tibi hoc nomen “asinus”, tunc 
apparet quod haec cras erit vera et a te concedenda “tu es asinus” »19. Ce 
n’est qu’un exemple, les arguments sont multipliés pour attester qu’il est 
légitime de changer le sens. De telles hypothèses visent à établir, dans sa 
formulation spéciﬁ quement buridanienne, le rapport entre le langage et la 
structure sémantique conceptuelle qui lui donne sens et procure le moyen 
de son interprétation. Mais ce qui est décisif, ce sont les modiﬁ cations 
apportées à la notion d’impositio ou d’institution des termes.
La première consiste à détruire toute référence à une imposition 
originaire en temporalisant l’acte d’institution au cours de l’argumentation 
visant à légitimer les changements de noms : «[…] non apparet quod 
magis [nomina] debent signiﬁ care ad placitum eorum qui fuerunt quam 
eorum qui sunt, specialiter de rebus quae modo sunt»20. Certes, c’est un 
argument donné dans le cours de la probatio, non parmi les conclusions, et 
l’on verra qu’en un certain sens, Buridan rétablit l’idée d’une imposition 
première ; mais cet argument est signiﬁ catif, et l’imposition première ne 
sera aucunement une imposition primitive sur le modèle adamique. Même 
dans les conclusions, on observe une sorte de pluralisation de l’imposition. 
Ainsi, Buridan aime imaginer que la langue latine soit perdue : « […] 
ponendo quod per diluvium vel per voluntatem divinam, totum idioma 
latinum sit perditum eo quod omnes ipsum scientes sint corrupti […] »21. On

peut alors imaginer que des hommes (au pluriel : « novi supervenientes ») 
redistribuent complè tement les relations entre mots et concepts, par 
exemple qu’ils appellent «homo» la même chose que nous (qui parlons 
latin), mais « asinus » ce que nous appelons « animal »… La vérité et 
la fausseté, et même la nécessité et l’impossibilité des propositions s’en 
trouveraient trans formées. Supposons en effet que « homo est asinus » fût 
inscrite sur un mur et subsistât après le déluge, alors il s’agira pour les 
nouveaux venus d’une proposition nécessaire22.
Buridan admet donc la possibilité de nouvelles impositions, d’une 
rénovation du sens, pour reprendre une expression qui évoque Roger 
Bacon23. Le schéma paraît certes différent, en ce que, sans ignorer le rôle 
de l’interprète24, Bacon insistait surtout sur l’intention du locuteur. Mais 
l’intention du locuteur est tout aussi présente dans la logique buridanienne, 
on l’a vu avec la décision d’instaurer ou de modiﬁ er le sens. Jack 
Zupko a signalé un passage du traité sur les Catégories où sont déﬁ nis 
les « dénominatifs »25. Buridan y afﬁ rme que pour qu’un terme soit dit 
dénominatif, est requise une condition ex parte vocis, à savoir qu’un terme 
concret soit vocalement dérivé d’un abstrait (grammaticus de grammatica), 
mais il y a aussi une autre condition ex parte intentionis, à savoir que ce 
terme concret ait une appellation, c’est-à-dire ne se réfère pas seulement 
à quelque chose, mais connote en outre un accident ou une disposition 
de cette chose26. La façon de présenter ce point semble impliquer que 
l’appellation soit moins une propriété donnée du terme qu’elle ne reposerait 
sur l’intentio du locuteur qui utilise ce terme. 
Le phénomène de nouvelle imposition est abordé dans le cadre d’un 
échange, d’une convention entre le locuteur et le destinataire, et la procédure

extraneam dispositionem ultra istud pro quo supponit».

 
JEAN BURIDAN: UNE PHILOSOPHIE DU LANGAGE ORDINAIRE ?

est toujours à la fois individuelle et sociale ; plus exactement, elle implique 
une communauté : le mot a une signiﬁ cation dans un idiome commun, uno 
toto magno idiomate, par exemple pour tous les latins, apud omnes latinos27. 
Nous assistons donc à une reprise de l’idée de rénovation permanente, 
mais insérée dans une perspective plus collective. Outre la temporalisation 
notée plus haut, Buridan procède aussi à une communautarisation de la 
langue. Cela apparaît aussi bien dans les Questions sur le Peri hermeneias 
que dans les Petites sommes de logique. Nous avons déjà rencontré 
une tendance à parler de l'imposition du sens à la première personne du 
pluriel : il nous est possible de changer la signiﬁ cation. Cela ne désigne 
pas forcément une communauté déterminée, mais cela va contre le fait 
de réserver l’institution à un individu déterminé, soit à titre d’origine 
archaïque, soit comme détenteur d’un savoir fondateur. 
En vérité, Buridan n’écarte pas tout à fait la ﬁ gure du premier instituteur 
des noms, mais il la relativise au bénéﬁ ce d’une communauté qui établit 
la signiﬁ cation par convention, au delà même du modèle disputationnel. Il 
est bien en notre pouvoir, et cette liberté semble inaliénable, de modiﬁ er le 
sens des mots : 
[…] si utamur istis terminis « homo » et « asinus » materialiter, tunc 
concedendum est quod nobis possibile sit mutare signiﬁ cationem 
eorum et facere quod talis vocalis sit vera « homo est asinus »28.
Et au delà d’une convention temporellement limitée, comme dans 
le cas d’une dispute obligationnelle, il se peut agir de la création d’un 
véritable dialecte : « Sed etiam adhuc multi inter concordes possent 
fabricare ad placitum unum ydioma quo inter se uterentur, sicud patet de 
illis qui loquuntur inter se garganicum »29. La norme est bien celle d’une 
communauté linguistique : « Aliqua sunt nomina et verba signiﬁ cativa 
eorumdem et eodem modo uni toti magne communitate »30 ; « […] debet 
reputari vera si secundum signiﬁ cationem quam communiter habet in 
idiomate audientium et proponentium sit vera […] »31. La nature et

29 Qu. in PH I, qu. 3, p. 16. «Garganicum» renvoie sans doute à un dialecte ou 
bien à une forme d’argot (de jargon) au sein d’un groupe restreint de locuteurs.

JOËL BIARD
l’amplitude de cette communauté varie selon la situation interprétative 
considérée : groupe de savants rassemblés pour une dispute, communauté 
restreinte (de métier par exemple), ou communauté parlant une même 
langue « nationale ». Et l’interprétation doit considérer divers rapports 
à cette norme. Dans le cas de la lecture de textes théologiques ou 
philosophiques, l’intention de l’auteur, telle qu’on peut la déceler d’après 
certaines marques dans l’énoncé, ou bien en faire l’hypothèse à partir de 
l’intention générale, de la tradition, etc., peut prévaloir sur le sens usuel ; 
dans d’autres situations, l’usage commun au sein d’une communauté 
donnée sert de référence pour écarter, ou du moins relativiser, certains 
usages paradoxaux ou impropres32.
Ce qui se dessine par conséquent, c’est une dialectique entre une norme 
collective et la liberté de la modiﬁ er dans certaines conditions. Précisons.
La norme collective est parfois référée à une institution primitive, 
mais même dans ce cas-là, l’aspect collectif ne disparaît pas : « [mutare 
signiﬁ cationem] fuit in potestate primi inponentis illud ydioma vel primo-
rum inponentium, qui ad placitum suum talibus vocibus tales signiﬁ ca-
tiones dederunt »33. Nous avons donc une première institution, ou plus 
exactement une institution de référence, qui est collective plus qu’indi-
viduelle. La manifestation de cette capacité, c’est qu’une communauté 
restreinte peut établir des conventions de substitution (ou de complément). 
Sur cette base s’établit une relation dynamique avec la liberté individuelle 
du locuteur. Le locuteur individuel ne peut pas changer à sa guise les 
conventions : « Non est in potestate mea vel tua auferre vel mutare 
huiusmodi signiﬁ cationem communem »34. Si l’on compare avec Bacon, 
Buridan semble plus prudent. En vérité, il est plus efﬁ cace, car il tient 
compte de l’exigence de dialogue (que symbolise le modèle disputationnel). 
La liberté ne devient effective que par des règles. Il faut donc une règle, ou 
en l’occurrence une distribution du sens, qui serve de norme. 
C’est particulièrement net dans le chapitre 6 des Sophismes, où 
Buridan veut éviter de tomber dans le piège d’une dérive du sens ne 
laissant plus la possibilité de reconnaître la structure conceptuelle qui 
32 SL I, 7, 1, p. 71 : « Falsitas consequentis patet per communem usum loquendi » ; 
SL IX, c. 7, 6um soph., resp., p. 135 : « Sed videtur mihi secundum usum communem 
quod haec dictio “semper” fuit imposita ad distribuendum pro omni tempore […] ».

sous-tend tel ou tel énoncé. Ainsi, plusieurs arguments sophistiques sont 
récusés en vertu du principe selon lequel on ne doit pas juger de la vérité 
ou de la fausseté d’une proposition selon la vérité qu’elle aura ou qu’elle 
peut avoir, mais selon la signiﬁ cation qu’elle a actuellement, quam nunc 
habet35. Et cette assignation temporelle est aussi une assignation à telle ou 
telle communauté : « Tamen ego bene scio quod ista propositio “homo 
est asinus”, quam inter nos proponimus, est falsa et impossibilis et non 
vera […] »36.
Sans y revenir ici longuement, c’est l’ensemble de ce dispositif qui 
donne sens au passage maintes fois commenté sur la virtus sermonis, et à 
la prise de position de Buridan par rapport au statut de 1340. Certes, il y est 
question de l’interprétation des textes philosophiques (voire bibliques), et 
la question est celle de l’usage des auteurs non pas seulement par rapport à 
un lexique mais par rapport à des modiﬁ cations de référence selon l’usage 
propositionnel. La position défendue par Buridan se fonde néanmoins sur 
le dispositif que nous venons d’esquisser, par deux aspects fondamentaux. 
Premièrement, il n’y a pas de norme rigide préétablie, mais une certaine 
latitude d’interprétation en fonction de l’usage. Cet usage, selon une dualité 
qui sera importante pour toutes les discussions de la Renaissance, n’est 
pas au premier chef l’usage commun, et pas plus une convention locale 
explicite bien que Buridan fasse ici aussi appel au modèle disputationnel, 
mais en l’occurrence l’usage des auteurs, ceux que l’on interprète. Mais 
il faut, ici encore, être attentif à la relation complexe entre norme et 
usage, faute de quoi toute interprétation serait déréglée. Qu’il s’agisse 
de phénomènes linguistiquement seconds, comme les usages autoréfé-
rentiels, ou d’usages dérivés, métaphoriques ou poétiques, il convient de 
les référer à quelque chose comme une virtus sermonis. Cependant, ainsi 
que le souligne la 5e question sur Porphyre, c’est là une façon impropre de 
s’exprimer puisque les mots n’ont pas de valeur par eux-mêmes. Ce point 
est rarement remarqué par les interprètes qui traitent de ce problème37. Or 
il est décisif pour mesurer l’originalité de la position de Buridan et ne pas 
35 Voir SL IX, 2um soph., p. 120 : « […] numquam propositio […] debet dici 
vera vel falsa nisi secundum signiﬁ cationem quam ipsa et sui termini habent quando 
proponitur, et non secundum signiﬁ cationem quam potest habere vel forte habebit sed 
nondum habet […] » ; cf. 4um soph., p. 124 : « […] quando utimur istis terminis “homo” 
et “asinus” signiﬁ cative, utimur eis secundum signiﬁ cationem quam habent nunc ».

rabattre cette virtus sermonis sur des débats du XIIIe siècle38. Toutefois, 
si l’on n’oublie pas ce point essentiel, il est légitime de reprendre cette 
expression usuelle. Buridan a déjà expliqué qu’un discours (sermo) peut 
être pris en plusieurs sens (secundum plures sensus), mais que dans ce cas, 
l’un peut à bon droit être dit premier, principal ou propre, alors que les 
autres peuvent être dits secondaires ou impropres.
Ille enim sensus dicitur « primus » et « proprius », qui est secundum 
signiﬁ cationem primo et principaliter voci impositam. Et ille sensus 
dicitur « secundarius » vel «improprius» qui est secundum aliam 
signiﬁ cationem illi primae attributam aut propter similitudinem aut 
propter aliam habitudinem39.
Les sens secondaires semblent ici motivés par un rapport objectif de 
dérivation, ce que conﬁ rme l’exemple des usages analogiques de sanum. 
En vérité, il s’agit moins de se référer à des possibilités objectives inscrites 
dans la langue que de souligner une fois encore la liberté de l’utilisateur : 
licite possumus uti ea secundum signiﬁ cationem sibi primo et prin-
cipaliter institutam, vel secundum signiﬁ cationem similitudinariam 
vel metaphori cam, immo etiam secundum signiﬁ cationem contra-
riam signiﬁ cationi eius primariae, ut quando volumus loqui iro-
nice40.
Cette possibilité de dérivation ou d’écart ne concerne pas seulement l’usage 
de tel ou tel terme, mais aussi la phrase elle-même et sa construction :
Deinde etiam aliquando contingit quod non ﬁ t sensus proprius ex 
parte orationum, quamvis dictiones proprias sumantur, quia dictiones 
possunt simul construi diversis modis et diversis ordinationibus41.

théologie et arts du langage aux XIIIe-XIVe siècles», in N. BÉRIOU – J.-P. BOUDET –

On pourrait certes lire ce passage en y voyant seulement la 
reconnaissance de contraintes objectives de la langue, servant de point ﬁ xe 
aux usages dérivés. Je pense toutefois qu’il y a trop de conver gences avec 
les autres textes déjà vus pour ne pas entendre cette signiﬁ cation «primo 
et principaliter impositam» au sens que nous avons exposé plus haut, à 
savoir comme celle qui résulte d’une convention collective, en l’absence 
de modiﬁ cation explicite et consensuelle. 
Le cadre général est donc celui d’une négociation du sens entre 
un locuteur doté d’une liberté d’innovation et une contrainte de nature 
consensuelle au sein d’une communauté. Chacun de ces pôles est marqué 
par l’autre. La liberté formelle trouve sa limite dans l’exigence de 
compréhension que marque fortement le caractère dialogique du processus 
d’expression et d’interprétation. La contrainte n’est pas celle d’une 
institution intangible de laquelle on s’écarterait provisoirement, mais celle 
d’une norme collective révisable en droit.
Un langage pluriel
Dans ces conditions, on ne s’étonnera pas de voir transparaître chez 
Buridan le pluriel des langues. Je voudrais dans une dernière partie repérer 
ces émergences et tenter d’évaluer leur portée. Ce n’est pas surprenant 
dans la mesure où le XIVe siècle voit déjà s’accroître la réﬂ exion sur la 
pluralité des langues, ainsi que les pratiques de traduction ou de rédaction 
en langue vulgaire – on pense évidemment, dans le contexte parisien, à 
Nicole Oresme. Ici encore, on pouvait repérer de premières réﬂ exions 
dans la pensée anglaise du milieu siècle précédent, avec notamment Roger 
Bacon, insistant sur l’exigence de connaître plusieurs langues, en particulier 
pour comprendre la Bible. Il n’y a pas à ma connaissance de réﬂ exion 
équivalente chez Buridan, qui est et reste un logicien, un physicien, bref 
un homme pour qui la raison doit viser l’universel. En revanche, on voit 
poindre dans la théorie de l’imposition ou dans les analyses des variations 
de signiﬁ cation des termes des allusions répétées aux langues vulgaires. 
Ce qui soulève implicitement la question : de quel langage parle Buridan ? 
Quel est son objet d’analyse ?
Dans les textes que nous avons rencontrés, un certain nombre de détails 
orientent vers une conscience aiguë de la pluralité des langues, ou plutôt 
de la particularité de la structure langagière qui est prise comme matériau 

448 
JOËL BIARD
dans les œuvres logiques. C’est évidemment le cas dans les Sophismes. 
Je rappelle que la première conclusion du chapitre 6 se place dans le 
cas hypothétique où un déluge a détruit l’ensemble de la communauté 
linguistique, et, avec elle la pratique du langage qui y a cours42. Ce langage 
est le latin, mais celui-ci est désigné comme un «idiome», idioma. Et 
les nouveaux venus créent un langage dans lequel les termes signiﬁ ent 
sur la base d’une autre distribution des signiﬁ cations. Le latin est donc 
ici clairement traité non pas comme un langage privilégié, encore moins 
idéalisé, mais comme une langue parmi d’autres, même si le latin est la 
langue de l’enseignement43. Il ne s’agit donc pas d’une réﬂ exion concrète 
sur les langues, ou sur telle ou telle langue, il s’agit d’une conception du 
langage qui le pose d’emblée comme pluriel : « […] illa est falsa mihi 
qui sum de isto idiomate, et est tibi vera, supposito quod tu sis de quodam 
idiomate alio […] »44. Cette pluralisation des langues apparaît encore dans 
un passage où il est question de la grammaire positive, en tant qu’elle est 
présupposée par la logique : « […] ante logicam grammatica positiva bene 
primo addiscenda est, qua magister cum discipulo possit conferre, sive sit 
in lingua latina sive gallica, graeca vel hebraica, aut quacumque alia »45.
Cette pluralité est indexée d’un point de vue spatio-temporel : dans 
un autre passage, on imagine que tous les hommes ont disparu, sauf ceux 
qui sont actuellement à Paris46. Alors ils pourront convenir ensemble de 
nouvelles impositions et les enseigner à leur enfants47. De même, un certain 
nombre d’arguments évoquent un idiome inconnu de nous48.
Est-ce propre aux sophismes, qui semblent par principe prendre pour 
objet des propositions parlées ou, dans certains cas, écrites ? En vérité, la 
même tendance se retrouve dans les textes sur le traité De l’interprétation. 
42 Voir SL IX, c. 6, 1a concl., p. 117 : «[…] ponendo quod per diluvium vel per 
voluntatem divinam, totum idioma latinum sit perditum eo quod omnes ipsum scientes 
sint corrupti […]».
43 Voir Questions sur la Métaphysique VI, qu. 2, fº XXXIIIvb.
44  SL IX, c. 6, 5a concl., p. 118.
45 SL I, 1, 1, p. 11.
46 Voir SL IX, c. 6, 4um soph., p. 123.
47 Voir ibid. : « Tunc omnes possunt simul convenire in dicta signiﬁ catione et 
pueros suos docere de cetero illam signiﬁ cationem […] ».
48 Voir ibid., 7um soph., p. 127 : « Probo, quia possibile esset quod in alio idiomate 
nobis ignoto talis oratio vocalis “homo est asinus” signiﬁ caret omnino sicut nobis 
signiﬁ cat haec oratio “albedo est color” ».

 
JEAN BURIDAN: UNE PHILOSOPHIE DU LANGAGE ORDINAIRE ? 
449
Pour répondre à l’objection possible de l’arbitraire individuel (ad placitum 
meum vel tuum), Buridan précise que les termes sont signiﬁ catifs dans 
une communauté linguistique donnée : «Dico quod aliqua sunt nomina et 
verba signiﬁ cativa eorumdem et eodem modo uni toti magne communitati, 
ut voces latine omnibus latinis et voces gallice omnibus gallicis»49. À 
nouveau, le latin est mis sur le même plan que le français, comme langue 
de communication usuelle. Jean Buridan réfère clairement à ce cadre de la 
langue commune l’idée même de signiﬁ cation conventionnelle : 
Notandum est quod […] de vocibus signiﬁ cativis ad placitum 
nos vocamus consueta locutione illam vocem signiﬁ cativam que 
communitati alicuius ydyomatis inposita est ad signiﬁ candum 
secundum aliquam certam signiﬁ cationem et communiter notam 
illis de isto ydyomate50.
C’est encore conﬁ rmé dans le traité sur les propositions des Petites 
sommes de logique. En premier lieu, le traité insiste sur le fait que la logique 
doit commencer par le son51, et ce point de départ est lié à l’évocation de la 
dispute, dont nous avons vu l’importance à titre de modèle de l’imposition. 
Buridan insiste sur le fait que disputer, c’est une affaire de parole : « […] 
nam quia ut plurimum opus logicae exercetur per disputationem, quae 
quidem disputatio non potest esse sine sermone nec sermo sine voce, ideo 
aliquid expedit dicere de voce »52. Et c’est peu après que Buridan oppose 
la convention restreinte de ceux qui disputent (« aliquam signiﬁ cationem 
determinatam ex conventu et concordia disputantium »), à la signiﬁ cation 
conventionnelle au sein d’une langue (« eiusdem signiﬁ cationis in uno toto 
idiomate magno, ut “homo” vel “asinus” apud omnes latinos »)53.
Cette attitude repose sur un privilège de fait accordé au langage parlé, 
qui se trouve être sans équivoque à nouveau considéré comme l’objet 
49 Qu. in PH I, qu. 3, p. 16.
50 Ibid., qu. 2, p. 9.
51 Ce geste théorique prend le contrepied du début de la Somme de logique de 
Guillaume d’Ockham. On pourrait certes soutenir que c’est là l’effet de son objet 
propre, à savoir les Traités inspirés de Pierre d’Espagne. Mais un tel argument peut 
se retourner : l’important est la signiﬁ cation de ce geste qui consiste faire reposer la 
logique sur un commentaire de ces traités. Et les «contraintes» institutionnelles ne 
livrent évidemment pas cette signiﬁ cation. 
52 SL I, 1, 2, p. 12.
53 Ibid. 1, 5, p. 15.

JOËL BIARD
premier de la logique. Les Questions sur le Peri hermeneias vont loin en 
ce sens : 
Aristotiles in hoc libro solum fecit considerationem de vocalibus 
propter hoc quod oportet disputationes in loyca uti. Et quia etiam 
determinare de natura et consideratione conceptuum pertinet ad 
librum De anima vel ad librum Metaphysice, tunc restat loyco 
applicare voces conceptibus correspondentes ad arguendum debite 
et loquendum congrue54.
Ici encore, on pourrait dire que c’est propre au commentaire sur 
le traité De l’interprétation, de même que les remarques initiales des 
Petites sommes pourraient n’être dues qu’à la reprise scolaire d’un ordre 
traditionnel. Néanmoins, Buridan fait clairement du langage parlé le porteur 
privilégié des relations signiﬁ antes. Laissons ici les développements 
bien connus que l’on trouve ailleurs sur le signiﬁ é immédiat et le 
signiﬁ é ultime. Certes, le concept, signiﬁ é immédiat, est ce qui rend le 
son signiﬁ ant. Il ne s’agit pas d’ignorer non plus qu’une bonne partie du 
programme buridanien concerne l’agencement des concepts qui donnent 
sens au langage, les manières de concevoir les choses et les divers types 
d’arguments. Mais l’homme, zoon logikon, animal langagier, est ici un 
« animal vociférant » : « cum non possit proferri vox sine aliquo conceptu, 
vox omnis est signiﬁ cativa illius quod animal vociferans concipiat »55. Et 
cette puissance de produire des sons, de vociférer, c’est précisément ce 
qu’Aristote appelait la « langue » – on trouve alors le terme lingua – : « Et 
per “linguam” intendit virtutem vociferativam, quaecumque illa fuerit »56. 
Dans la Politique d’Aristote, l’homme en tant qu’animal politique doit 
être doué de parole non seulement pour exprimer ses émotions mais pour 
formuler et communiquer le juste et l’injuste. Le texte est connu, même si 
Buridan ne commente pas la Politique57. Toutefois, le terme vociferans ne 
se trouve pas dans la version latine de la Politique. En choisissant ce terme, 
Buridan souligne que l’homme porte la parole, et que telle est sa différence 
spéciﬁ que. Cette « vocifération » se fait bien dans le cadre d’un échange au 
54 Qu. in PH I, qu. 3, p. 16.
55 SL I, 1, 4, p. 14.
56 SL IV, 1, 2, p. 9.
57 Comme on sait, les Questions sur la Politique qui ont été attribuées à Buridan 
sont de Nicolas de Vaudémont.

 
JEAN BURIDAN: UNE PHILOSOPHIE DU LANGAGE ORDINAIRE ? 
451
sein d’une communauté donnée, même si elle est ici guidée par l’intention 
de signiﬁ cation et orientée vers le vrai, avant de l’être vers le bien. 
C’est le langage parlé (sermo), en tant qu’il est rationnellement réglé, 
qui est l’objet de la logique, comme l’indiquent encore les Questions sur 
Porphyre : « Logica enim dicitur a “logos” quod est sermo, et “lexis” 
quod est ratio, quasi scientia de sermone ratiocinativo »58. Dans un 
passage des Sophismes, Buridan fait même appel au langage quotidien. 
Il s’agit du sophisme « Haec copulativa est vera “Aristoteles disputat 
et Antichristus praedicat” ». La probatio repose sur la liberté d’utiliser 
conventionnellement n’importe quel laps de temps comme présent. Et sur 
cette base, le sophisme peut être concédé. Cependant, ce n’est pas l’usage 
courant.
Sed verum est quod nos loquentes communiter de nostris factis 
quotidianis non solemus uti magno tempore tamquam praesenti, 
sed parvo ad ponendum melius differentiam inter facta nostra priora 
et posteriora quantum ad tempus. Ideo sic propter consuetudinem 
[…] videtur nobis prima facie abominabile dicere quod Aristoteles 
disputat59.
Conclusion
En parlant de « langage ordinaire », je n’avais pas l’intention de rabattre 
la philosophie buridanienne du langage sur un courant de la philosophie 
contemporaine, qu’il s’agisse de Wittgenstein ou de théories plus récentes 
comme celle de Paul Grice. Mais il convient de souligner que Jean Buridan 
ne cherche aucunement à élaborer un langage expurgé de ses ambiguïtés 
sémantiques ; au contraire, attentif aux usages courants et aux situations 
conversationnelles au sein desquelles il se formule, il tente de les expliciter 
aﬁ n de mieux maîtriser les processus de communication.
58 Qu. Porph., qu. 1, p. 125. Or ce mot sermo est bien celui que l’on a dans la 
Politique pour caractériser le propre de l’homme ; voir Aristoteles latinus, Clavis : 
39-2, Politica, transl. Guillelmus de Moerbecka, I, 2,1253 a 14-18 : « sermo autem 
est in ostendendo conferens et nocivum, quare et iustum et iniustum, hoc enim ad alia 
animalia hominibus proprium est, solum boni et mali, iusti et iniusti et aliorum sensum 
habere: horum autem communicatio facit domum et civitatem ». 
59 SL IX, c. 7, soph. 5, p. 134. C'est moi qui souligne (J. B.).

JOËL BIARD
Bien entendu la sémantique buridanienne oscille, comme toutes les 
théories médiévales, entre une sémantique descriptive et une sémantique 
normative, selon la dualité soulignée par Claude Panaccio à propos de 
Guillaume d’Ockham lui-même60. Mais pour le maître picard, exhiber la 
structure conceptuelle sous-jacente à un énoncé oral ou écrit a toujours 
pour ﬁ nalité d’interpréter tel ou tel usage du langage, qu’il s’agisse de 
l’usage commun ou de l’usage des auteurs, et il ne le fait pas en suggérant 
des procédures de récriture mais bien plutôt en cernant le sens à partir 
de l’intention et de l’interprétation possible. Je n’ignore pas les aspects 
universalisants qui peuvent se trouver dans la logique buridanienne, mais 
je voulais souligner son ancrage dans le langage tel qu’on le parle ou qu’on 
l’écrit. Son aspect dialogique, ﬁ guré par le modèle disputationnel, souligne 
non seulement le rôle de l’intention du locuteur mais plus encore le rôle 
du récepteur dans un processus d’interprétation. Sur cette base se met en 
place une situation de négociation du sens qui procure un modèle, même 
dans les cas où l’un des pôles de cet échange est absent. Et dans ce cadre, 
la pluralité des langues prend toute sa place. Certes, on n’a pas de réﬂ exion 
concrète sur les différences de structure des langues, ou sur les questions 
de traduction. Mais l’afﬁ rmation de la particularité (donc de la pluralité) 
est le signe ultime que le matériau dont part le logicien, qu’il décrit et dont 
il fournit les règles d’interprétation est le produit d’un «animal vociférant»

NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN’S LOGIC
John Buridan’s introduction of the notion of non-normal proposi-
tions (propositiones de modo loquendi inconsueto) in his theory of 
the syllogism is a marked example of the influence of vernacular 
languages on the use of Latin in medieval logic and the regimentation 
of the language used. Classical Latin is an SOV language, in which 
the word order of the simplest sentence form is subject-object-verb, 
in contrast to the SVO order of the vernacular languages of the later 
Middle Ages. Buridan’s so-called non-normal propositions arise from 
deeming the normal order to be the SVO of the vernacular, and so 
taking SOV, where the object-term precedes the verb, to be non-
normal. In particular, introducing O-propositions of non-normal form 
permits conversion of normal O-propositions, meaning that all four 
propositions of the traditional square of opposition can be converted, 
thereby adding further possibilities to the theory of the assertoric 
syllogism.
1. Dante and the Accusative
In Prue Shaw’s 1995 edition of Dante’s Monarchia, we read:
Et nota quod argumentum sumptum a destructione consequentis, 
licet de sua forma per aliquem locum teneat, tamen vim suam 
per secundam ﬁguram ostendit, si reducatur sicut argumentum a 
positione consequentis per primam.
Reducitur enim sic: omne iniustum persuadetur iniuste: Cristus 
non persuasit iniuste: ergo non persuasit iniustum. A positione

consequentis sic: omne iniustum persuadetur iniuste: Cristus 
persuasit quoddam iniustum: ergo persuasit iniuste1.
This is part of Dante’s attempt to show that the Holy Roman Empire 
was part of God’s plan, to which Christ assented by being born under the 
Roman aegis. Dante is not known for his work on logic, but he appears here 
to be committing the fallacy of aﬃrming the consequent. However, the 
two occurrences of ‘consequentis’ are «corrections» by the editor. Ricci’s 
edition of 1965 has ‘antecedentis’ in both places, so that Dante is correctly 
reducing the argument to the ﬁrst ﬁgure –aﬃrming the antecedent, not the 
consequent2.
Indeed, Dante is arguing correctly in this passage, reducing second-
ﬁgure Camestres to ﬁrst-ﬁgure Barbara (sic). In fact, altering ‘antecedentis’ 
to ‘consequentis’ is not the only «correction» which Shaw makes in 
this passage. She notes that what she gives as «argumentum sumptum a 
destructione consequentis» reads diﬀerently in Ricci, viz: «argumentum 
sumptum ad destructionem consequentis». In defending her alterations 
to the text, Shaw translates «argumentum sumptum ad destructionem 
consequentis» as «the argument used to disprove or refute the consequent»3. 
But in her edition and translation, she realises that Dante is arguing from 
the denial of the consequent, rather than towards it:
All injustice is assented to unjustly   
PaM 
Christ did not assent unjustly  
 
neM 
therefore he did not assent to an injustice  
neP
Key 
n: Christ; M: assent unjustly; P: assent to injustice
1 Dante (Durante degli Alighieri), Monarchia, Ed. by P. SHAW, Cambridge 
University Press, Cambridge 1995, pp. 94-95: «And note that our argument, which is 
based on denying the consequent, although valid in its form by virtue of a common-
place, yet reveals its full force as a second ﬁ gure syllogism, if it is then reduced to the 
ﬁ rst ﬁ gure as an argument based on afﬁ rming the consequent. This reduction runs as 
follows: all injustice is assented to unjustly; Christ did not assent unjustly; therefore he 
did not assent to an injustice. Afﬁ rming the consequent, we get: all injustice is assented 
to unjustly; Christ assented to an injustice; therefore he assented unjustly».

NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN̓S LOGIC 
455
The argument is by Camestres, in the second ﬁgure.
Aristotle himself reduces Camestres to Celarent, in the ﬁrst ﬁgure, 
by simple conversion of the second premise and the conclusion, and then 
inverting the premises: 
 
PaM 
 
PaM 
 
MeS 
 
MeP
 
SeM © MeS © PaM © SaM  
 
SeP 
 
PeS 
 
PeS 
 
SeP
However, Dante reduces it to Barbara, by reductio per impossibile:
 
PaM 
 
PaM 
 
MaP
 
neM © naP © naM  
 
neP 
 
naM 
 
naP
He has to do so because the minor premise cannot be converted 
simply, for its subject is a singular term, and singular terms cannot appear 
as predicates. Moreover, it reduces to Barbara because Aristotle treats 
singular propositions as universals, so that the contradictory of, e.g., neM 
is naM. Barbara works by afﬁ rming the antecedent:
All injustice is assented to unjustly 
Christ assented to an injustice 
so he assented unjustly.
But was Shaw right to amend ‘ad destructionem consequentis’ to 
‘a destructione consequentis’? No: the construction ‘sequitur ad’ is 
commonly used by logicians in the fourteenth century to mean ‘follows 
from’. The Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources notes under 
the entry for ‘ad’: «as in CL [classical Latin], but used more extensively, 
like Fr. à, esp. in place of dat. or abl.»4. Consider, e.g., Burley’s statement 
of Suﬃxing:
«Quidquid sequitur ad consequens, sequitur ad antecedens»
4 R. LATHAM – D. HOWLETT, Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British sources, 
Oxford University Press, Oxford for The British Academy 1975.

456 
STEPHEN READ
This is not a fallacy. Burley clearly means ‘Whatever follows from the 
consequent follows from the antecedent’. In the very next line Burley writes:
«Quidquid antecedit ad antecedens, antecedit ad consequens»
Here, he clearly means ‘Whatever is antecedent to the antecedent is 
an tecedent to the consequent’. Thus Dante’s logic was impeccable, as was 
his expression of it. His syllogism in Camestres works by denial of the 
consequent (‘ad destructionem consequentis’), and is reduced to Barbara, 
which works by aﬃrmation of the antecedent (‘a positione antecedentis’).
What we see here is an inﬂuence of the vernacular on medieval Latin. 
For example, Burley and Ockham use the phrases «ex impossibili sequitur 
quodlibet» and «necessarium sequitur ad quodlibet», where the latter 
clearly means «the necessary follows from anything»5. Buridan uses «ad 
impossibile sequitur quodlibet» and «necessarium sequitur ad quodlibet» 
to mean that anything follows from the impossible and the necessary 
follows from anything. He writes:
Prima conclusio est: ad omnem propositionem impossibilem omnem 
aliam sequi et omnem propositionem necessariam ad omnem aliam 
sequi.
Clearly, he means: «from any impossible proposition any other 
follows, and any necessary proposition follows from any other». We ﬁnd 
this inﬂuence of the vernacular in many other places in the works of Burley, 
Ockham and Buridan. One of them concerns word order, and is used by 
Buridan to extend Aristotle’s account of the assertoric syllogism.
This confusion may also lie behind a puzzle that has beset successive 
translators of Buridan‘s Sophismata, concerning Buridan’s reasoning in 
the third sophism of ch. 8. Buridan writes:
Hoc probatur per syllogismo in primo modo tertiae ﬁ gurae sic: 
‘omnis homo currit; et omnis homo est asinus, prout positum erat;

igitur asinus currit’. Unde sit syllogismus ad impossibile, scilicet 
capiendo positionem adversarii cum aliquo vero, et sic inferimus 
conclusionem per consequentiam bonam, licet conclusio sit 
impossibilis. Ideo sic etiam in proposito est bona consequentia6.
What does Buridan mean by ‘syllogismus ad impossibile’? A 
natural thought is that he is referring to the syllogism per impossibile7. 
Consequently, Hughes renders it: «We argue in a reductio ad absurdum»8. 
Scott translates it as: «a syllogism to an impossible conclusion»9. Klima 
doesnʼt attempt a translation, retaining ‘syllogism ad impossibile’, but 
adds a foonote: «As Joël Biard remarks, it is unclear why the conclusion 
that a donkey runs should be regarded as impossible»10. But what Buridan 
presents is not a syllogism to the impossible, but from the impossible. 
Since the premises are impossible, the conclusion may also be impossible 
(‘licet conclusio sit impossibilis’), but it equally well may not be, as here.
2. Non-Normal Propositions
In the 14th Conclusion of Book I of his Tractatus de Consequentiis 
Buridan discusses simple and accidental conversion11. These conver-
sions were central to Aristotle’s demonstration of syllogistic consequence. 
Both here and in his Summulae de Dialectica, Buridan in troduces the 
notion of negative propositions in non-normal form, namely, where the 
predicate precedes the negation. This is a particularly extreme example 
of an increasing regimentation of Latin by medieval thinkers. By the late 
Middle Ages, Latin was no longer a language of everyday speech, though 
it was used as a lingua franca in intellectual and political circles. As such,

it evolved and took on aspects of the character of the new languages of 
everyday speech, French in particular. For example, the French deﬁnite 
article, ‘ly’, was co-opted into the Latin of logic texts in place of ‘iste 
terminus’ to indicate material supposition. ‘Iste’ and ‘ille’ were increasingly 
used as deﬁnite articles rather than demonstrative adjectives, and ‘talis’ 
replaced them in the latter role. And, as we’ve seen, ‘ad’ and the accusative 
came to replace the dative and ablative in many cases.
Moreover, the rather free word order of classical Latin (with a 
preference for subject-object-verb, SOV) was replaced by the subject-verb-
object order (SVO) of the vernacular languages. Matthew Dryer writes in 
The World Atlas of Language Structures Online:
SVO, now a common order in Europe and around the Mediter ranean, 
was less common in the past: on the one hand, there were SOV 
languages like Latin and Etruscan in western Europe; on the other 
hand, there were many VSO languages in what is now the Middle 
East, represented both by Semitic languages and by Egyptian12.
Such a changed word order underlay rules of consequence such as 
the rule that a universal aﬃrmative sign confuses the term immediately 
following it distributively and any term mediately following it merely 
confusedly. Similarly, that negation distributes any term following it that 
without it would not be distributed, and does not distribute anything that 
precedes it, as Buridan writes:
A negating negation distributes every common term following 
it that without it would not be distributed and does not distribute 
anything that precedes it13.
E.g., in ‘Every human is running’, ‘human’ has confused and distributive 
supposition and ‘running’ has merely confused supposition. Again, in ‘Some 
human is not running’, ‘running’ has confused and distributive supposition, 
while ‘human’ has determinate supposition and is not distributed.
More generally, in SaP, S is distributed and P is undistributed

in SeP (‘No S is P ’), both S and P are distributed
in SiP (‘Some S is P ’), both S and P are undistributed
in SoP (‘Some S is not P’), S is undistributed and P is distributed.
The standard way of negating a subject-copula-predicate proposi tion 
in Latin is to place a negation before the copula, e.g., Sortes est albus 
becomes Sortes non est albus. If we now place the predicate before the verb 
(and its negation), we obtain what Buridan calls the non-normal way of 
speaking (de modo loquendi inconsueto). For example, asinus is distributed 
in Quoddam animal non est asinus, but asinus is not distributed, he says, 
in Quoddam animal asinus non est. The latter is true if some animal is 
not some ass (‘some’ in English has a similar power of over-riding the 
distributive power of the negation) whereas the former is true only if 
some animal is not any ass. If we compare what Buridan writes here with, 
e.g., Boethius’ De Syllogismo Categorico we can see how Latin has both 
changed and become regimented. For Boethius’ normal way of writing 
the O-proposition is Quoddam animal asinus non est, with the negation 
after the predicate (with the verb). For example, in his De Syllogismo 
Categorico, we read14:
Boethius would not agree with Buridan that preﬁxing the predicate to 
the negation removes the distributing force of the negation. Nonetheless, 
the regimentation serves a useful purpose for Buridan in allowing him to 
convert O-propositions like ‘Some animal is not a donkey’. In conversion,

the subject and predicate exchange places, and the quantity is preserved in 
simple conversion, and changes in accidental conversion:
• 
Traditionally, I- and E-propositions convert simply: 
 
SiP converts to PiS and SeP converts to PeS
• 
 A-propositions convert to the corresponding I-proposition: SaP 
converts to PiS
• 
O-propositions don’t convert
But introducing non-normal O-propositions allows the conversion 
of O-propositions: SoP converts to PSo (Quoddam P S non est). E.g., 
Quoddam animal non est asinus (‘Some animal is not an ass’) converts to 
Quidam asinus animal non est (‘Some ass (some) animal is not’). Preﬁxing 
the predicate (animal) to the negation frees it from the distributing power 
of the negation, so that in PSo, S is not distributed, just as it wasn’t in 
SoP.
Aristotle’s great idea in his doctrine of the syllogism was that all 
consequence could be reduced to the pairwise deduction of successive 
conclusions. Buridan says that he understands Aristotle to mean by a 
syllogism a collection (in the ﬁnal analysis, a pair) of propositions from 
which a conclusion can be inferred15. Concentrating on the A, E, I and O 
forms, there are 48 possible pairs sharing a middle term in common, 16 in 
each of three ﬁgures: where the middle term is subject of one and predicate 
of the other; where it is predicate of both; and where it is subject of both. 
In the ﬁrst ﬁgure, the conclusion can be direct (where the subject of the 
conclusion was subject in its premise) or indirect (where the subject of the 
conclusion was predicate in its premise). The task Aristotle set himself was 
to distinguish those pairs of premises which yield a syllogistic conclusion 
from those which do not. Aristotle based his demonstration of validity on 
the so-called dictum de omni et nullo, essentially a deﬁnition of what it is 
to predicate one thing of another:
«we speak of ‘being predicated of all’ when nothing can be found of 
which the other will not be said, and the same account holds for ‘of 
none’». (Prior Analytics I 1, 24b28-30)
15 John Buridan, Tractatus de Consequentiis III i 4.

 
NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN̓S LOGIC 
461
The validity of the perfect syllogisms, namely, the direct syllogisms 
of the ﬁrst ﬁgure, is based on this deﬁnition, and that of the remaining 
syllogisms is reduced to those by conversion and reductio per impossibile, 
as we saw.
Buridan’s approach is very diﬀerent, in a way that laid the foundation 
for the theory of the syllogism in the traditional logic of the 18th and 19th 
centuries. At the start of the Treatise on Consequences, he cites the principles:
Whatever are the same as one and the same are the same as each 
other … Two things are not the same as each other if one is the same 
as something and the other is not16.
Lagerlund and King identify these principles as Aristotle’s dictum de 
omni et nullo17. But they are not. They are the medievals’ understanding of 
what Aristotle says in Prior Analytics I 6, under the epithet ecthesis, which 
became for the medievals «the expository syllogism». Bonaventure writes:
By the expository syllogism: for of necessity it follows, as is said 
in the Prior [Analytics] ‘this A is B, this A is C with the same 
demonstrated, therefore C is B’; and this syllogism is founded on 
the self-evident principle ‘whatever are the same as one and the 
same are the same as each other’18.
In the Questions on the Prior Analytics, Buridan makes it explicit that 
these principles are the expository syllogism:
16 Ibid.: «Quaecumque uni et eidem sunt eadem inter se sunt eadem […] 
Quorumcumque duorum unum est idem alicui cui reliquum non est idem illa non sunt 
inter se eadem». Citations in English from the Treatise on Consequences are from my 
translation (John Buridan, Treatise on Consequences, Transl. by S. READ, Fordham 
University Press, New York 2014).

also found in Aristotle’s De Sophisticis Elenchis at 168b32.

The aﬃrmative expository syllogism holds by the rule, ‘Whatever 
are numerically the same as one and the same, they are the same as 
one another’ […] the negative expository syllogism holds by the 
rule, ‘Whatever are the same as one another, one of them is diﬀerent 
from anything from which the other is diﬀerent’19.
The medievals’ interpretation of Aristotle’s method of ecthesis (setting 
out, or exposition) was that the term Aristotle introduces was a singular 
term. Aristotle writes in Prior Analytics I 6 (28a23-25):
The demonstration [of Darapti] can also be carried out […] by 
setting out. For if both terms belong to all S, and one chooses one 
of the Ss, say N, then both P and R will belong to it, so that P will 
belong to some R.
It has been a constant puzzle since ancient times whether the term 
‘N’ which Aristotle introduces here is a singular or general term. But as 
Alexander of Aphrodisias and many others have urged, it cannot be a 
general term, since then ecthesis would simply be an instance of Darapti 
itself, so the attempted demonstration of Darapti would be circular. Aristotle 
must have intended it to be a singular term, as he says ‘one of the Ss’, so 
that one of the Ss, N, is P and the very same S, viz N, is R. This connects 
the two premises: P and R are said of «one and the same thing». For the 
same reason, the middle term in a syllogism must be distributed, Buridan 
says in the 6th Conclusion of the Treatise on Consequence III i 4, so that 
the premises can be joined together eﬀectively. Provided one occurrence 
of the middle term is distributed, take an instance of the other, then the 
distribution will ensure that that instance is included and the premises 
relate to the same thing. Otherwise, Buridan writes:
[If] the middle is not distributed in either [premise] it is possible that 
its conjunction with the major extreme is true for one thing and its 
conjunction with the minor is true for another.
19 John Buridan, Questions on the Prior Analytics, Ed. by H. HUBIEN (unpubished): 
«Dicendum est quod syllogismus expositorius aﬃrmativus tenet per istam regulam 
“quaecumque sunt eadem uni et eidem in numero, illa sunt sibi invicem eadem” 
[…] syllogismus expositorius negativus tenet per istam regulam “quaecumque sibi 
invicem sunt eadem, a quocumque unum eorum est diversum” ab eodem reliquum est 
diversum».

 
NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN̓S LOGIC 
463
The 6th Conclusion of the Treatise on Consequence III i 4 gives a 
necessary condition for syllogistic validity: «no syllogism is valid in which 
the middle is distributed in neither premise». This is in marked contrast to 
Aristotle’s approach. To show premise pairs not to constitute syllogisms, 
Aristotle uses the method of counter-instances. That is, to show that 
a premise pair is not a syllogism, he gives a triad of terms to substitute 
for the extremes and the middle term such that, ﬁrst, the premises and a 
universal aﬃrmative coupling of the extremes are all true, and another 
triad such that the premises and a similar universal negative are all true. 
Hence, no particular negative can follow, in virtue of the ﬁrst triad, and no 
particular aﬃrmative in virtue of the second, and consequently no universal 
conclusion either, of which the particulars are subalterns. Aristotle does 
this systematically, but seriatim, for direct conclusions from every non-
syllogistic pair in each ﬁgure, that is, for 34 premise pairs. He does not 
actually complete the task for the absence of indirect conclusions in the 
ﬁrst ﬁgure.
In contrast, Buridan now has a general principle which will show the 
invalidity of all the cases of invalidity. He brings it all together in his 7th 
and 8th Conclusions, with reference back to the 2nd Conclusion:
Second Conclusion: no syllogism can be validly drawn from two 
nega tives … 
Sixth Conclusion: no syllogism is valid in which the middle is 
distributed in neither premise …
Seventh Conclusion: in every ﬁgure, if the middle was distributed in 
one of the premises there is always a valid syllogism by concluding 
to a conclusion of one extreme with the other extreme …
Eighth Conclusion: if the minor extreme was distributed in the 
premises a direct universal conclusion can be inferred, and if 
not, not; if the major extreme was distributed in the premises an 
indirect universal conclusion can be inferred, and if not, not; if the 
predicate of a negative conclusion was distributed in the premises 
the conclusion should be formed in the customary way of speaking; 
and if it was not distributed, then the conclusion should be formed 
by placing the negation after the predicate.
It should be noted that by these three conclusions, that is, the sixth, 
seventh and eighth, and by the second, the number of all the modes 

464 
STEPHEN READ
useful for syllogizing in any of the three ﬁgures both direct and 
indirect is made manifest.
Each of these Conclusions is proved by the ecthetic principle. 
Between them, they give necessary and suﬃcient conditions for inferring 
a conclusion from a pair of assertoric subject-predicate premises.
3. Non-Normal Syllogisms
As we noted, in each ﬁgure there are sixteen ways of linking premises 
of the four forms. The 2nd Conclusion shows that four moods in each ﬁgure 
are useless, namely, those with both premises negative. For the expository 
principles cannot adduce anything from premises both of which deny an 
identity. As Buridan points out, that Brownie is not A, not B, not C and so 
on does not allow us to infer anything about A, B or C, either aﬃrmatively 
or negatively. Brownie does not provide a suitable middle term if all we 
know of him is negative. Together with the verdict of the 6th Conclusion 
this rules out the eight pairs ee, ia, oa, oe, eo, ii, oi and oo in the ﬁrst 
ﬁgure. The other eight pairs can produce a conclusion, the six identiﬁed by 
Aristotle and two more (ao and io) with a non-normal conclusion:

At the end of SD 5.1.8, Buridan says that from the premises ie, we can 
also infer a non-normal E-proposition:
Some M is P, No S is M, so Every S (some) P is not.

 
NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN̓S LOGIC 
465
‘P’ is undistributed in the conclusion, just as it is in the major premise. 
However, this is true only if the E-proposition is expressed as ‘Every S 
(some) P is not’, where the predicate precedes the negation. The same 
reasoning also supports an inference to a non-normal E-proposition from 
ae in the ﬁrst ﬁgure, ie and oa in the second, and ae, ao and ie in the third. 
The additional ﬁrst-ﬁgure moods not recognised by Aristotle read:
Every M is P 
Some M is P
Some S is not M 
Some S is not M
So some S (some) P is not 
So some S (some) P is not
In each case, the conclusion is an O-proposition of non-normal form 
in which both S and P are undistributed, but M is distributed in the ﬁrst 
premise of the ﬁrst syllogism and in the second premise of both. So each 
satisﬁes the conditions of the 6th, 7th and 8th Conclusions.
The non-normal conclusions also convert to the indirect non-normal 
conclusion ‘Some P (some) S is not’. Moreover, whenever a normal 
O-conclusion (in, e.g., Ferio) can be inferred (in each ﬁgure), a non-normal 
O-conclusion also follows, as we noted previously, by the 10th Conclusion 
of Book I:
From every proposition containing a distributed term there follows 
in a formal consequence a proposition with the same term not 
distributed, the rest remaining the same.
As noted, the premises of Fapesmo and Frisesomorum also entail a 
non-normal E-conclusion:
Every M is P  
Some M is P 
No S is M  
Some S is not M 
So every S (some) P is not  
So every S (some) P is not 
We infer a negative conclusion from one negative premise; M is distributed 
in one premise; and the only term distributed in the conclusion (S) is dis-
tributed in the premise. P is not distributed in the conclusion, since it is 
outside the scope of the negation.
We can provide the same analysis of the second ﬁgure. Again, the 
2nd Conclusion rules out the premise pairs ee, eo, oe and oo. While the 6th 

466 
STEPHEN READ
Conclusion rules out the premise pairs aa, ai, ia and ii, where the middle 
term would not be distributed. The remaining eight pairs all produce at 
least one conclusion, though again two conclude non-normally:

The two moods Tifesno and Robaco (called Fitesmo and Boraco at 
Summulae de Dialectica 5.4.2-3) seem to be Buridan’s own invention. It is 
questionable whether they really diﬀer from Festino and Baroco, resulting 
simply from inverting the order of the premises and the order of the terms 
in the conclusion. The same is true of Camestre and Cesares. Buridan 
himself concedes as much at Summulae de Dialectica 5.2.1.
The genuinely new non-Aristotelian moods are those with a non-
normal conclusion:
Some P is not M 
Some P is M
Some S is M 
Some S is not M
So some S (some) P is not 
So some S (some) P is not
Once again, we infer a negative conclusion from one negative premise; 
M is distributed in one premise; and neither term is distributed in the 
conclusion. P is not distributed in the conclusion, since it is outside the 
scope of the negation. Although Tifesno and Robaco are not genuinely 
new, the iee and oae syllogisms are interesting: 
Some P is M  
Some P is not M 
No S is M  
Every S is M 
So Every S (some) P is not  
So every S (some) P is not

 
NON-NORMAL PROPOSITIONS IN BURIDAN̓S LOGIC 
467
Again, we infer a negative conclusion from one negative premise; M is 
dis tributed in one premise; and the only term distributed in the conclusion 
(S) is distributed in the premise.
In the third ﬁgure, the 2nd Conclusion rules out purely negative premise 
pairs. The 6th rules out purely particular ones, namely, ee, eo, oe, oo, ii, io 
and oi (oo is both purely negative and purely particular). That leaves nine 
useful premise pairs:

Once again one might suspect Lapfeton, Carbodo and Rifeson (called 
Fapemton, Bacordo and Fisemon at Summulae de Dialectica 5.5.2-3) of 
being an artiﬁcial fabrication. Nonetheless, the non-normal moods aee, 
aoe and iee are a counterexample to the standard result that there are no 
weakened moods in the third ﬁgure (and that only particular conclusions 
can be inferred).
How many syllogisms are there? This clearly depends on what counts as 
a syllogism. Buridan believes that Aristotle intended a (basic) syllogism to 
be any pair of assertoric syllogistic propositions which entails an assertoric 
syllogistic conclusion. On that account, Aristotle accepted 16 assertoric 
syllogisms, 6 in the ﬁrst ﬁgure (4 with a direct conclusion, 2 indirect), 4 
in the second and 6 in the third. The Theophrastian moods, Baralipton, 
Celantes and Dabitis, merely infer new conclusions from existing syllogistic 
pairs. Buridan extends the notion of an assertoric syllogistic proposition by 
admitting non-normal negative propositions. That means more syllogistic 
pairs yield a valid conclusion, resulting in 8 pairs in the ﬁrst ﬁgure, 8 in the 
second and 9 in the third. Hence Buridan accounts 25 assertoric syllogisms 
altogether. Why doesn’t Buridan consider possible syllogisms with non-

468 
STEPHEN READ
normal premises? –because nothing new can follow from weakening the 
premises, only the conclusions.
4. Conclusion
The vernacular languages brought about changes in the Latin used by 
medieval scholars. Among those changes were the increasing use of ‘ad’ 
and the accusative in place of the dative and ablative, and the adoption of 
the SVO word order in place of the SOV of classical Latin. Many medieval 
logicians adopted rules that depended on a ﬁxed SVO word order. Buridan 
in fact declared the traditional SOV order of syllogistic propositions to 
be non-normal (de modo loquendi inconsueto). In negative propositions 
of non-normal form, the predicate escapes the scope of the negation 
and so is not distributed by it. Using propositions of non-normal form, 
Buridan al lows conversion of O-propositions and the addition of further 
valid syllogistic forms. Buridan need only consider non-normal negatives, 
and non-normal conclusions, since the predicate is always undistributed 
in aﬃrmatives, and new cases only arise from weakening the conclusion, 
not the premises. Thus Buridan extends the range of syllogistic moods, 
admitting 25 valid moods.

BEYOND FORMALITY: THE ROLE OF THE DIALECTICAL 
CONTEXT IN MEDIEVAL LOGIC
1. The dialectical context
The formal aspects of Latin as it was used by the medieval logicians 
have often been remarked upon1. This formal or regimented language has 
provided a basis upon which modern logicians, who prefer to represent 
their logical inferences symbolically, can ﬁ nd common ground with 
medieval logic. Indeed, one could argue that the extent to which there is 
common ground between medieval and modern logicians is the extent to 
which the language and arguments of the former are as formal as those used 
by the latter. But the common ground only goes so far; as Ashworth notes, 
«modern attempts to draw precise parallels between medieval [logical] 
theories as a whole and the results of contemporary symbolic logic are 
generally doomed to failure, even though there are many fruitful partial 
correlations»2. Given that the aim of both medieval logic and modern 
logic –to isolate those inference patterns which are truth-preserving from 
those which are not, broadly speaking– are essentially the same, why is 
it that attempts to view the one through the spectacles of the other are so 
doomed3?

language used in medieval logic is the distinction between inferences 
which are formally valid (valid in virtue of the form of the argument, valid 
for all subject matter) and those are valid only materially (valid in virtue of 
the subject matter, valid for only some subject matter)4. Some materially 
valid inferences –such as certain types of enthymemes– can be turned into 
formal inferences5, while other inferences appear to be essentially material.
But even this distinction will only get us so far; there are inferences 
which are apparently taken as bona but which are valid neither in virtue 
of their formality nor in virtue of their matter. These are ones that take 
advantage of the fact that logic in the Middle Ages is an essentially agent-
based endeavor, hearkening back to its roots in dialectic and reﬂ ecting 
the fact that in order for there to be reasoning there must be a reasoner 
–and not only a reasoner, but also a reason for reasoning. When there is 
both reasoners (in the plural!) and a reason for reasoning, then there is 
a dialectical context, a reasoning context where more than one person is 
involved.
The central role of the performative aspects of ancient and medieval 
logic is neither well nor often recognized6. In fact, failure to recognize 
themselves be out of focus, lending everything viewed through them fuzzy. An 
example of an attempt to understand medieval logic via modern logic which was 
doomed for this reason is Karl Dürr’s attempt to formalize Boethian hypothetical 
syllogisms by blindly translating the Latin into symbolic notation interpreting the 
conditional both materially and strictly, and determining whether the results of the 
exercise are theorems of Russell-Whitehead’s system in Principia Mathematica or of 
Lewis and Langford’s Symbolic Logic (K. DÜRR, The Propositional Logic of Boëthius, 
North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam 1951). Dürr’s goggles allow him to 
see only a part of modern logic, and thus it is not surprising that his view of medieval 
logic through this small slice of modern logic is so utterly negative.

of Suppositio and Consequentia», Journal of the History of Philosophy, 50-3 (2012) 
339-364.
5 For example, the materially valid argument «All men are mortal, therefore 
Socrates is mortal» is valid in virtue of the matter of the argument, namely, the matter 
of Socrates; it can be turned into a formal argument with the addition of the presence 
«Socrates is a man». Other arguments cannot be modiﬁ ed so easily.

these aspects has often lead to miscategorization of medieval logic from the 
point of view of modern logic. In this paper we look at how the dialectical 
context, in addition to and above and beyond formality and materiality, 
affects the validity and invalidity of inferences. What we aim to show 
in this paper is that the dialectical context of certain types of inferences 
cannot be ignored, that it is essential to understanding why the inferences 
are acceptable, and that such an understanding cannot be done in terms 
of formality and materiality alone. As a result, any reconstruction of the 
inferences in terms of modern logic which does not address this dialectical 
context is indeed doomed to failure.
The majority of this paper is made up of illustrations of different 
ways in which the dialectical, multi-agent context can affect the validity 
of inferences. Many of which our illustrations fall under the broad 
category of “epistemic logicˮ, which is no accident; again Ashworth 
points out the salient fact, namely that in the Middle Ages «logic [...] had 
a straightforwardly cognitive orientation»7, and this cognitive orientation 
will play a large role in our explanation of why the dialectical context has 
such a signiﬁ cant effect on logic. Reasoning is a cognitive process and 
hence logic is inextricably epistemic8.
We have now referred to the ‘dialectical context’ a number of times 
without saying what we mean by it. In what follows we will clarify what we 
mean by this phrase by means of identifying features of logical discourse 
which (a) effect the types of inferences that are accepted as valid and (b) 
arise not from purely argument-based concerns, that is, features not of the 
arguments themselves (like formality and materiality) but from the context 
in which the arguments are made. These features all make up what we call 
the ‘dialectical context’, though they are by no means a complete list of all 
the aspects that are relevant to understanding medieval logic in a multi-
agent, dynamic context.
of (modern) logic is also stressed by Sundholm in a number of articles, cf., e.g., 
G. SUNDHOLM, «Inference versus consequence», in T. CHILDERS (ed.), Logica Yearbook 
1997, Filosoﬁ a Publishers, Czech Academy of Science, Prague 1998, pp. 26-36.
7 ASHWORTH, «Terminist logic», p. 147.
8 Cf. also S. KNUUTTILA: «Medieval authors generally did not operate with the 
conception of logical omniscience that is included in some modern theories… They 
treat the logic of epistemic notions from the point of view of factual attitudes», S. 
KNUUTTILA, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy, Routledge, London – New York 1993, 
p. 177.

The primary characteristic that all of the features share is that they are 
agent-based. The agents involved in logical reasoning are:
• 
 Using natural language: Because it is natural language, albeit a 
semi-formalized natural language, that is used for conducting 
reasoning, some inference patterns are licet on the basis of natural 
language usage.
• 
 Reasoning in time: Because inference is a process or activity, it has 
temporal duration.
• 
 Interacting with each other: Because dialectic involves reasoning 
with more than one agent, it is possible to draw inferences on the 
basis of the behavior of other people.
• 
 Limited in cognitive capacity: Inferences which are formally valid 
may be barred because they are beyond the cognitive abilities of 
the agents in question.
We look at each of these aspects in turn.
2. Proper and improper uses of natural language
When the object language and the metalanguage for reasoning are the 
same (or at least bear sufﬁ cient similarity to each other), then one is able 
to make, within that language, a distinction between proper and improper 
use of the language. In the context of logic and reasoning, this distinction 
goes back to at least Saint Anselm of Canterbury. Anselm distinguished 
the usus loquendi or the usus communi of a term from its usus proprie (cf. 
particularly his De grammatico)9; for example, properly speaking, facere 
non ‘to do not’ and non facere ‘not to do’ are not equivalent. However, 
commonly speaking, we often use them as if they are equivalent, and 
even when we employ words incorrectly, we are able to draw correct 
inferences. If we distinguish between the formal properties and the 
“natural” properties of language, we can distinguish the consequences 
of a sentence, some of which follow properly, some only according to 
common usage.

Abbatia, 1938-1961, 6 vols., Ed. by F. S. SCHMITT, vol. 1.

 
BEYOND FORMALITY 
473
Anselm took great pains to show how the usus proprie could be used to 
understand and explain the fact that even from the usus loquendi we are still 
able to correctly draw conclusions. Others who made the same distinction 
placed the priority differently; for example, John of Salisbury10 was often 
content to let the actual usage of terms drive his logical investigations11. 
John also, quoting Horace, points out that natural language changes over 
time: «Many words that are obsolete, will one day be resurrected, and 
many now highly esteemed will lapse from use»12. We will see more of the 
effects of time in the next section.
Distinguishing different ways that a term can be used in ordinary 
language is something many later logicians writing on knowledge and 
epistemic reasoning did. Gaetanus of Thiene (1387-1465) identiﬁ es four 
different ways that scire can be used, ranging from the ‘common’ (i.e., 
layman’s) usage through various levels of proper usage to the ‘most proper’ 
(propriisime)13:
1.  scire communiter: ‘to know is to believe ﬁ rmly, without hesitation, 
together with the fact that it is so’.
2.  scire proprie: ‘a mental grasp of anything true, and necessary 
without a danger that the opposite be the case’.
3.  scire magis proprie: ‘a mental grasp of anything by means of a 
demonstration, be it demonstratio quia or demonstratio propter 
quid, be it universal or particular’.
4.  scire propriisime: ‘a mental grasp of anything acquired by the 
most powerful demonstration, which is in some way different from 
a demonstratio quia’14.

should use others», John of Salisbury, The Metalogicon: A Twelfth-Century Defense of

In a similar vein, Paul of Venice, speaking of the ordinary usage of 
scire, says that «in general scire means nothing else than believe ﬁ rmly 
without hesitation and that together with the fact that it is the case»15, 
and then he distinguishes that from knowledge properly speaking, which 
accords with Gaetanus’s propriisime deﬁ nition. These different ways 
must be distinguished in order to determine which inferences involving 
knowledge ascriptions are valid or acceptable and which are not.
3. Temporal aspects
Reasoning or inferring is a process and as such is temporally extended. 
This affects the validity of arguments in both directions –it can cause both 
more and fewer arguments to be valid than are valid merely in virtue of their 
form or matter. On the ampliative side, we have as witness consequentiae 
ut nunc, consequences which are bona simply in virtue of the fact that 
either their antecedents are false or their consequents true, since it is then 
necessary per accidens that the antecedent cannot be true without the 
consequent being true. Burley when introducing the distinction between 
absolute and ut nunc consequences explicitly invokes the temporal aspect:
An absolute consequence is one that holds good for every time... An 
as-of-now consequence holds good for a determinate time and not 
always –e.g., ‘Every man is running; therefore, Socrates is running,’ 
since that conse quence does not hold good always, but only while 
Socrates is a man16.
Burley gives the following rule governing such consequences:
15 R. VAN DER LECQ, Paul of Venice on composite and divided sense, in A. MAIERÙ 
(ed.), English Logic in Italy in the 14th and 15th Centuries, Bibliopolis, Napoli 1982, 
pp. 321-330, p. 328.

«Consequentia simplex est ista, quae tenet pro omni tempore [...] Consequentia ut nunc 
tenet pro tempore determinato et non semper, ut: ‘Omnis homo currit, igitur Sortes 
currit;’ illa enim consequentia non tenet semper, sed solum dum Sortes est homo», 
Walter Burleigh, De Puritate Artis Logicae, Ed. by P. BOEHNER, Franciscan Institute, 
Bonaventure 1951, p. 1.

 
BEYOND FORMALITY 
475
In an as-of-now consequence, however, the antecedent cannot be 
true with out the consequent as of now, —viz., for the time for which 
the consequence holds good17.
Other consequences which are valid ut nunc include: «It is night, therefore 
you are reading», «It is day therefore, you are reading», and «It is night, 
therefore you are sleeping», assuming that you are in fact sitting here now 
reading these words. Such consequences are clearly not valid in virtue of 
their form, since they all share the simple form P"Q. They are also not valid 
in virtue of their matter, since there need not be any intrinsic connection 
between whether it is day or night and whether I am reading aloud or not; 
both of these matters are contingent and vary contingently with respect 
to each other. Thus, the explanation for the bonitas of such consequences 
must be located elsewhere, in accidental features of the world at the time 
of the evaluation of the consequence. From this, it is clear that the division 
of consequences into ut nunc and absolute is separate from the division 
of consequences into formal and material, the latter of which are both 
absolute. For example, while «All men are running, therefore Socrates is 
running» is valid only for such times as Socrates is a man; «All animals are 
running, therefore all men are running» is valid for all times, although it is 
only materially, not formally, valid.
Such consequences are not governed by the same rules as ordinary 
consequences, and thus also serve as witness to the restrictive side. Ockham 
points out that a simple consequence can be modalized with necessity, 
salve bonitas, but a consequence ut nunc cannot be18. 
The contingency and variation demonstrated by ut nunc consequences 
also causes a restriction in the acceptability of arguments in other contexts; 
speciﬁ cally, we show examples in obligational reasoning where this 
occurs. Because you can change posture while reading, sometimes sitting, 
sometimes perambulating, then it can be the case in the same argumentative 
context that both «If you are reading, then you are sitting» and «If you are 
reading, then you are walking» turn out to be good consequences (ut nunc) 
even though the entire time you are in fact reading, and the consequents

of the two are contrary. It is precisely to bar this fact that rules such as the 
following are introduced in obligationes:
Every response must be directed to the same instant19.
All responses must be directed to the same instant20.
The ﬁ rst is a constitute rule in Nicholas of Paris’s Obligationes, where-
as the second is a merely useful rule in Walter Burley’s. Both of these 
are designed to prevent the Respondent from being obliged to concede a 
contingent, irrelevant fact at one stage of the disputation and to deny it in 
another, or two concede two contraries.
Burley gives a related rule:
When a false contingent proposition concerning the present has 
been posited, one must deny that it is the present instant21.
That is, in the context of an obligatio, it can be legitimate to deny, 
without fear of contradiction, that «It is now» –a statement which many 
modern logicians think is self-fulﬁ llingly true!
It is also temporal aspects of language use, combined with his 
nominalist leanings, which cause Buridan to invoke an interval semantics 
for present-tensed propositions22. For Buridan, truth or falsity can only 
attach to existing things. Since by the time one has completed speaking a 
sentence, the beginning of it no longer exists, it cannot be the case that a 
sentence’s truth or falsity is evaluated at a single instant: For at any single 
instant, no spoken sentence exists in its entirety. (Note that this arises

speciﬁ cally in the context of speech: For a written sentence persists in its 
entirety through time, and hence the issue of it existing in its entirety at a 
single instant of evaluation is not problematic.)
4. Interaction between reasoners
Perhaps the most curious of the examples we consider arise from the 
fact that in a dialectical context, there is more than one person involved. 
Given that dialectical contexts are dynamic in nature –as the reasoning 
process unfolds, time moves on, and the truth values of sentences change 
(see § 3)– one or both of the participants can exploit this fact in the 
inferences themselves. In this section, we look at an example of epistemic 
reasoning involving reasoning about other people’s knowledge that occurs 
in Part 1, Treatise 22 of Paul of Venice’s Logica Magna, De scire et 
dubitare23. This treatise discusses the puzzle «whether something known 
by someone is uncertain to him or not known to him»24. On any naive 
account of knowledge and uncertainty, this hardly seems like a puzzle: The 
intuitive answer is ‘no’, because knowledge and uncertainty exclude each 
other. However, Paul advances a number of arguments that it is possible 
for something known to someone to also be uncertain to that person, as 
well as replies to each of these arguments, and in this exposition we see the 
curious relationship between the inferences being made and the inferrers 
making them.
The role of demonstration or justiﬁ cation in knowledge plays an active 
role in epistemic reasoning. Many of Paul’s inferences crucially rely on the 
dialectical nature of his presentation of a proof to the reader, and on the 
basis of this attributing knowledge to the reader; such inferences cannot be 
rendered in a monological setting and maintain either formal or material 
validity. Because proofs can function as appropriate demonstrations, Paul 
often ﬁ rst provides an argument or proof for a particular statement and 
then from this argument infer that you (i.e., the reader who has just read 
the argument) know the conclusion, since you are both considering it (it

and transl. by P. CLARKE, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1981.

non scitum eidem», ibid., p. 2.

is before your mind because you have just been reading about it) and you 
have a justiﬁ cation for it. In this way, it is possible to move from assertoric 
statements to ascriptions of knowledge when the proofs of the assertoric 
statements are made manifest. If we wished to speak symbolically, we 
could say that we are allowed to make use of a rule which says that Cϕ 
can be inferred if ϕ appears in an earlier step in the proof, and likewise we 
can infer Kϕ once we have demonstrated ϕ within a proof. These rules 
govern acceptable multi-agent dynamic inferences, without themselves 
being formally valid.
We now consider some speciﬁ c examples of this phenomenon. 
The third argument pro which Paul offers rests on the following two 
assumptions:
(1) I assume (a) that you know that A is one of the two 
propositions ‘God exists’ and ‘A human being is a donkey’, 
and (b) that one A is every A, and (c) that it is hidden from 
you which of the propositions is A, but (d) you know perfectly 
well that the proposition ‘God exists’ is necessary and the 
other, ‘A human being is a donkey’, impossible25.
(2) Every proposition you consider which you do not know to 
be true and do not know to be false is uncertain to you26. 
Paul asserts that, given the assumptions, the following inference is sound27:
This proposition is known by you (indicating the proposition ‘God 
exists’), and that proposition is A, therefore A is known by you28.
25 Tractatus de Scire et Dubitare, p. 3; «Et pono quod scias A esse alteram illarum 
‘Deus est’ et ‘Homo est asinus’, et quod unum A est omne A, et lateat te quae illarum 
est A, sed bene scias quod illa est necessaria ‘Deus est’ et reliqua impossibilis ‘Homo 
est asinus’», ibid., p. 2.
26 Ibid., p. 5; «Omnis propositio de qua consideras quam non scis esse veram nec 
scis esse falsam sit tibi dubia», ibid., p. 4.
27 It should be noted that Paul is not espousing the validity of the argument 
himself, but is rather asserting its validity as a devil’s advocate in the argument pro.
28 Tractatus de Scire et Dubitare, p. 5; «Haec est scita a te (demonstrando illam 
‘Deus est’), et illa est A, igitur A est scitum a te», ibid., p. 4.

 
BEYOND FORMALITY 
479
This looks very much like he is saying that the inference ‘KB, B = A, 
therefore KA’ is sound. Given that elsewhere he is quite emphatic that «the 
argument from one interchangeable term to the other with a preceding 
modal term is not acceptable»29, on what grounds could Paul expect the 
reader to accept what appears to be a patently false consequence?
The answer is grounded in the constructive nature of epistemic logic 
for Paul: We not only reason about knowledge in a static setting but our very 
act of so reasoning or inferring or proving can be used to create knowledge. 
By the presentation of proofs from one person to another, speciﬁ c mental 
states in the people involved are engendered, as a result of bringing a 
proposition to someone’s notice (notitia) or forcing them to consider it 
(consideratio). The reason the inference is sound, in this speciﬁ c context, 
is because it has been put forth to the reader, who is considering it and 
understands it, and once he considers and understands the premises, once 
the conclusion is put forward into his consideration, he will understand it 
and be forced to grant that it follows.
The next argument Paul puts forward also makes an implicit appeal to 
the fact that presenting a premise or an argument to another person causes 
that person to consider the propositions involved. He says that «it follows 
from the case supposed [the two assumptions] that A is uncertain to you»30 
because of the following argument:
Every proposition you consider which you do not know to be true 
and do not know to be false is uncertain to you; A is a proposition 
which you do not know to be true and do not know to be false; 
therefore A is uncertain to you31.
Formally speaking the argument is this:

and transl. by N. KRETZMANN, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1979, p. 147; 
«Verumtamen ab uno convertibili ad reliquum cum termino modali praecedente non 
valet argumentum», ibid., p. 146.

31 «Nam omnis propositio de qua tu consideras quam non scis esse veram nec scis 
esse falsam est tibi dubia; sed A est propositio quam non scis esse veram nec scis esse 
falsam; ergo A est tibi dubium», ibid., p. 4.

Premise 1: ∀X (CX ∧ ¬KTX ∧ ¬K¬TX " UX).
Premise 2: ¬KTA ∧ ¬K¬TA.
Conclusion: UA.
This argument is not formally valid; the second premise lacks the 
conjunction CA which would be required to derive the conclusion by 
universal instantiation and modus ponens. However, given that A is the 
topic of discussion in the current setting, it is not problematic for Paul to 
assume that the reader is considering A, thus allowing him to draw on that 
implicit assumption; the result is an argument which is truth-preserving 
even if not formally valid.
5. Limitations in cognitive capacity
In 13th-century treatments of the varieties of obligationes, it was 
standard practice to state the rule for irrelevant or impertinent propositions 
in factive, rather than epistemic, terms. For example, the general rule that 
Burley gives for irrelevant propositions indicates that true ones should be 
conceded and false ones denied:
One must reply to what is irrelevant in accordance with its own 
quality32.
Here, «in its own quality» can only be sensibly taken to refer to a quality 
or property of the irrelevant proposition itself, i.e., its truth value. It 
cannot refer to an epistemic relationship between the proposition and a 
reasoning agent, for that would not be something plausibly describable as 
the proposition’s ‘own quality’.
But this rule cannot be taken at face value, for otherwise the action 
of doubt would never arise in Burley-style positio, for given bivalence, 
every irrelevant proposition is either true or false, and thus either should 
be conceded or should be denied. But Burley includes examples where the 
correct response to an irrelevant proposition is to doubt it:
32 Walter Burley, Obligations, p. 375. This same rule is repeated verbatim as a 
special rule in the discussion of dubitatio, ibid., p. 410.

 
BEYOND FORMALITY 
481
Let this be posited: ‘You are in Rome or the king is seated.’ Next 
let ‘The king is seated’ be proposed. This is in doubt and irrelevant; 
therefore, one must respond by saying that one is in doubt33.
Such examples show that how he is really understanding the rules 
is in an epistemic sense. That is, a true irrelevant proposition should be 
conceded only if it is known to be true, etc. This emendation to the rules 
takes into account that the participants in an obligatio are not omniscient: It 
may very well be that Respondent not only doesn’t know whether the Pope 
is sitting, there is no way in practice that he could know. Thus, it would 
hardly be fair of Opponent to lay upon Respondent the charge of responding 
badly when Respondent doesn’t respond in accord with knowledge that he 
doesn’t possess.
This is not the only place where logical (non-)omniscience turns up in 
obligationes. Just as it isn’t fair to criticize Respondent for not knowing the 
truth value of contingent, irrelevant propositions, some later 14th-century 
authors also believed that you couldn’t criticize Respondent for failing to 
act in accord with consequences that he is not aware of. Such authors built 
epistemic clauses directly in to the rules. Richard Brinkley (3rd quarter of 
the 14th C) gives the following rules for pertinent propositions34:
Everything following from the positum proposed during the time of 
its positio and known to be such must be conceded.
Everything incompatible with the positum during the time of the 
positio and known to be such must be denied.
A consequence of adopting such rules, however, is to turn the 
disputation from a wholly public endeavor to a partly private one: Since 
the evaluation of the disputation depends on Respondent’s internal mental 
states, it is always possible for him to reply to any charge of responding 
badly by simply saying: «But I know that ϕ was relevant, and thus I treated 
it as irrelevant, and followed the appropriate rule for that», and there would 
be no way to determine whether he was lying.

SARA L. UCKELMAN
Lack of logical omniscience can also be used to block the acceptability 
of certain consequences, even if they may in fact be valid according to 
some truth-functional or modal account of logical con sequence. Peter of 
Mantua offers an example of a consequence where both the antecedent and 
the consequent express the same (contingent) proposition –and thus under 
any plausible interpretation of validity should be valid!– where someone 
might admit the antecedent without thereby being bound to admit the 
consequent, namely a consequence whose antecedent is in Latin but whose 
consequent is in Greek, e.g., «Homo currit, igitur ανθροπος τρεχι»35. For 
if one knows Latin but does not know Greek, then one may not recognize 
that the consequent is in fact a consequent of the antecedent, and could 
remain agnostic about it while accepting the antecedent or asserting it as 
true. It is on similar grounds that Buridan argues that from «You know 
that A and you know that if A then B» you are not entitled to conclude 
«You know that B», since even though you know both of the premises, 
you «nevertheless may perhaps fail to order them in a syllogism, or fail 
to see that the third follows from them»36. This example demonstrates the 
importance of consideration or attention when arguing or inferring in a 
real-world context.
With these examples, we conclude our tour through “dialectically”-
acceptable arguments in medieval logic.
6. Conclusion
This paper has, for the most part, been more exemplary than 
argumentative. Nevertheless, we have seen many examples of argument 
or inference patterns which are either rejected or accepted on the basis of 
characteristics which do not appear to have anything to do with formality or 
materiality, but rather directly tie to the nature of logic as an argumentative 
practice between multiple people. The scope of the examples is wide: they 
range from the late 11th century to the late 14th, and come from as disparate 
areas of logic as epistemic logic, obligationes, treatises on consequences, 
insolubilia, and even logical apologetics, thanks to John of Salisbury.

BEYOND FORMALITY

The depth and breadth of the examples shows that this is not an isolated 
phenomenon but rather a central and foundational aspect of logic and 
argumentation as it was practiced in the Middle Ages. Simply put: there is 
more to the validity of an inference than mere logical consequence37.

HOW NATURAL IS NATURAL LANGUAGE? 
SOME POST-MEDIEVAL DISCUSSIONS
The title of the Geneva symposium held in 2012 was «Formal 
approaches and natural language in medieval logic», and on the face of 
it this title suggests the distinction made by twenty-ﬁ rst century logicians 
between natural or ordinary languages and the formal language-systems of 
symbolic logic and mathematics1. However, the modern sense of «natural» 
was not that used by late medieval and post-medieval logicians. As we will 
see, various senses appear in their writings, but for our purposes the most 
important sense involves their distinction between natural signiﬁ cation 
and ad placitum signiﬁ cation, and only words with the latter kind of 
signiﬁ cation belong to such spoken languages as English and French. 
Accordingly, in this paper I shall discuss the distinction between natural 
and ad placitum signiﬁ cation and how it relates to views about the nature 
and origin of human language, in order to see how far these views would 
allow for the construction of a fully-ﬂ edged formal language, such as ﬁ rst-
order quantiﬁ cational logic. What power did logicians think we have over 
the languages we use? How far can we stipulate a signiﬁ cation for a term, 
and could the notion of an uninterpreted system have a role to play? In 
order to ﬁ nd some answers to these questions, I shall focus on selected 
post-medieval logicians, starting with Johannes Versor († after 1482), an 
eclectic author who drew on both Aquinas and Albertus Magnus2. From the 
ﬁ rst decades of the sixteenth century, I shall consider a group of men who 
studied and taught at the University of Paris, including Gaspar Lax (1487-
1560), his pupil Juan Dolz del Castellar (M.A. 1509), Fernando de Enzinas 
(† 1523), Juan de Celaya (ca. 1490-1558), John Major (1467-1550), and

Domingo de Soto (1494-1560). The latter, whose Summulae was ﬁ rst 
published in 15293, had a strong inﬂ uence on a later group of authors in 
the scholastic tradition, including the Jesuits Sebastianus de Couto (1567-
1639), Antonius Rubius (1548-1615) and Martinus Smiglecius (1564-
1618). Couto was the author of the Coimbra commentary on Aristotle’s 
Organon published in 1606, and as such was particularly inﬂ uential 
throughout the seventeenth century. 
Introduction
As a background to my discussion, we need to recognize that logic had 
an explicitly cognitive orientation: it was intended to help us distinguish 
truth from falsehood, and to enable us to reach knowledge of what was 
unknown on the basis of what was already known. Physics and metaphysics 
were the main goals, and logic tended not to be connected with mathematical 
reasoning and still less with the foundations of mathematics and purely 
abstract systems4. The result was a pragmatic approach whereby schemata 
such as syllogistic ﬁ gures were there only to be used as a guide to actual 
arguments in ordinary language. 
We also need to recognize that the study of logic began with the study 
of terms. As Versor, like many others, remarked, it is only when we have 
signiﬁ cant terms that we can proceed to construct propositions, and it is 
only when we have propositions that we can organise them in arguments5. 
As a result, discussions of language and its origins appear either in treatises 
on terms, or in commentaries on Peter of Spain’s initial distinction between 
the vox signiﬁ cativa naturaliter and the vox signiﬁ cativa ad placitum6, or in 
commentaries on Aristotle’s Peri hermeneias. Two passages of this work 
are particularly important: 16a3-5 which was read in Boethius’s translation 
3 Domingo de Soto, Summulae, Burgis 1529. Later editions were considerably 
changed.

as saying that spoken words are signs (notae) of concepts (passiones), and 
16a19-20 which was read in Boethius’s translation as saying that a nomen 
(name or noun) was a vox signiﬁ cativa secundum placitum. 
This organization meant that a discussion of regimented uses of 
language as found in discussions of sophismata and supposition theory 
would not feature in introductory material, given that the focus was on 
terms and not phrases and propositions. Moreover, logicians focused not 
on terms in general but on a restricted group of individual categorematic 
terms, since they assumed that language begins with the naming of physical 
objects, notably animals, and that syncategorematic terms, which enable us 
to construct phrases and sentences, are acquired secondarily. In one of his 
treatises on Terms, John Major noted that imposition could not begin with 
those categorematic terms that signify distant objects, and that it could not 
begin with syncategorematic terms, since these did not signify things, but 
only signiﬁ ed in some way (aliqualiter)7.
Categorematic terms are signs, and the basic semantic notion was 
signiﬁ cation, which was normally deﬁ ned in accordance with Peter of 
Ailly’s deﬁ nition: «to signify is to represent some thing, or some things, or 
in some way to a cognitive power by vitally changing it»8. Signiﬁ cation, 
then, is a psychological and causal notion that should not be confused with 
meaning. Because a sign is something that represents or makes known, 
a spoken term, whether a proper name or a common noun, can be a sign 
both of a concept and of an external object, but neither the concept nor the 
external object is properly described as a meaning, for a meaning is not 
an entity to which a word can be related. Particularly from the fourteenth 
century onwards, concepts or mental terms were also held to be signs, 
and the logicians I am concerned with often embedded their discussion of 
spoken and mental terms in a general classiﬁ cation of signs that embraced

a range of non-linguistic signs including smoke, footprints, divinely 
instituted sacraments, trumpet signals in battle, and the circle or bush 
outside a tavern9. 
Divisions of Natural Signs
Signs were divided into natural and ad placitum signs, and I shall 
begin with the former. Among Parisian logicians, one standard division 
of natural signs was three-fold. A sign could signify (1) naturaliter 
proprie, also called naturaliter formaliter, (2) naturaliter communiter or 
obiective, and (3) naturaliter ex instinctu naturae, also called naturaliter 
instrumentaliter10. Concepts, and only concepts, belong to the ﬁ rst group, 
since as forms they represent by virtue of what they are. The second group 
contains every created thing that exists, since everything is capable of 
causing a concept that represents that very thing. Domingo de Soto refused 
to regard this kind of representation as genuine signiﬁ cation11, and the later 
Jesuit logicians do not discuss it. In any case, we can exclude both the 
ﬁ rst and second groups from our investigation, as neither is relevant to 
the issue of spoken language. The third group consists of those signs that 
represent or make known something other than themselves by means of 
their effect on the cognitive powers of animals and humans, and insofar as

these signs are called instrumental, they relate closely to signs that signify 
ad placitum, for these too were classiﬁ ed as instrumental.
At this point, we need a further distinction between the sign as 
symptom or index and the sign as a symbol which is nevertheless produced 
naturally. The sign as symptom or index is a causal or concomitant effect 
of the thing signiﬁ ed, and the relationship between the two is an inferential 
one based on a real causal relationship. To say that smoke is a natural sign 
of ﬁ re is simply to say that causal and hence inferential relationships do 
exist between smoke and ﬁ re. The sign as symbol is something that has 
been intentionally produced in order to point the hearer to whatever it is a 
symptom of. A dog might bark in order to show that it is angry, a human 
being might groan in order to show that he is in pain, but neither the dog 
nor the human being controls the fact that that particular sort of sound is a 
symptom of anger or pain. As a result, both barks and groans, the standard 
examples of naturally signiﬁ cant utterances, might be naturally signiﬁ cant 
in two ways. They might be natural as mere symptoms or indices, or they 
might be natural as intentionally produced but not ad placitum. They were 
also natural in accordance with one standard criterion, that of being the 
same for all12, or at least, for all of the same species13. 
The discussion of these kinds of sign raised two linked problems that 
were discussed by Parisian logicians. The ﬁ rst problem had to do with 
the phrase «ex instinctu naturae» when used to apply, not just to voces 
as produced by humans and other animals, as was the case with Versor 
and others14, but to any kind of sign. Enzinas15 and Dullaert16 claimed that 
smoke and footprints signiﬁ ed naturaliter ex instinctu naturae yet it is not

regem, vestigium lupi lupum signiﬁ cat, et sub hoc modo comprehendo signiﬁ care 
seclusa impositione recordative».

clear what justiﬁ ed them in so doing, given the normal sense of «instinct». 
The second problem was whether groans and barks should be regarded as 
intentionally produced or as mere causal effects. Soto took up both issues 
when he argued that to signify as a natural instrument (signiﬁ care tanquam 
instrumentum naturale) was not properly called «to signify by an instinct 
of nature» because of the difference between smoke and groans. The latter 
are in some sense intentional since, unlike smoke and footprints, they have 
a natural purpose, a destinatio. Smoke is not instituted by nature to signify 
ﬁ re, since it is a mere effect of ﬁ re, but one can argue that groans are 
instituted by nature to signify pain, and to indicate the sufferer’s need for 
medicine17. Thomas de Mercado († 1575) argued that smoke and so on 
are merely natural phenomena, and that, unlike the case of groans, which 
are instituted by nature to represent, we need experience and reasoning 
(discursus) to interpret them18. Later Couto suggested that animal sounds 
were not intentional, and merely signify the effects that impel animals to 
produce those sounds. Thus a rooster’s crow is the natural effect of its 
pleasure at ﬁ nding food19. 
Interjections were also problematic: if I say «Ouch!», is that a natural 
sign, or is it ad placitum, given that a Frenchman might say «Aïe!»? 
Occasional reference was made to this problem, and Versor remarked that 
some interjections such as «eya» receive their signiﬁ cation by institution20. 
However, I shall leave all these issues aside, for it was generally agreed that 
inarticulate sounds such as animal noises and groans pointed to affections 
and passions rather than to concepts. As a result they did not form part of a 
genuine language, for that must be the product of the rational soul.
17 Domingo de Soto, Summulae, f. Vva: «Et hoc solet dici signiﬁ care ex instinctu 
nature. At revera differt inter fumum et gemitum. Nam fumus non est a natura institutus 
ut representet ignem, sed quia est effectus ignis representat ipsum. Sed gemitus, etsi 
representet inﬁ rmitatem tamquam effectus suam causa, peculiari tamen modo, quia 
ad hoc solum institutus est ut sit signum inﬁ rmitatis quasi invito inﬁ rmo, expostulet 
medicinam [...] Dicitur ex naturali destinatione, id est, ordinatio, ad differentiam fumi, 
vestigii, etc.».

491
Natural Signiﬁ cation and Spoken Languages
This leaves us with the question of whether the words that do form a 
language, or are part of a language, can be naturally signiﬁ cative in any 
robust sense. The simple criterion of being the same for all was of no help 
here, for it was recognised that a word that signiﬁ ed ad placitum could be 
the same for all21, and indeed, would have been before the destruction of the 
Tower of Babel22. In order to avoid this problem, Parisian logicians tended 
to reﬁ ne the criterion by stipulating that a term signifying naturally should 
signify the same to all in the absence of imposition, that is, without any 
original institution23. Other constraints could be added. The anonymous 
author of a commentary on the ﬁ rst and fourth parts of Peter of Spain’s 
Tractatus speciﬁ ed that for a vox to signify naturally it must signify the 
same to all those who have the use of reason and apprehend the sound 
correctly. Thus when a dog signiﬁ es joy to its master by barking, the fact 
that someone else mistakenly believes that the bark signiﬁ es anger does 
not prevent it from having natural signiﬁ cation24.
One can now ask two questions: ﬁ rst, is there any sense in which a 
word that is part of a language is natural, and second, can a spoken word

natural in that sense also be natural in the much stronger sense of revealing 
the nature of the thing spoken of through some kind of similarity to it? 
The arguments supporting an afﬁ rmative answer to the ﬁ rst question were 
founded on observations about what is natural to a human being, given 
the kind of thing we are. Following Aristotle, medieval and post-medieval 
logicians did agree that, as social animals, human beings have a natural 
need for communication, and they also agreed that the spoken word is not 
only natural to us but is the most ﬂ exible way of handling communication. 
Couto, Rubius, and Smiglecius, following Aquinas25, pointed out that these 
observations do not imply, as some had suggested, that the products of 
utterance are naturally signiﬁ cative, any more than the products of our 
hands are natural26. We have a natural ability to produce words and objects, 
but these products are artiﬁ cial. Couto and Smiglecius also rejected the 
argument that since animal noises are natural signs, human utterances must 
a fortiori be natural signs27. 
The second question, whether our words could be natural in the strong 
sense of somehow revealing the natures of the things spoken of, was 
not discussed by the Parisian authors, but was a concern for the Jesuits. 
The issue had been touched on by Aquinas in his commentary on the 
Peri hermeneias28, and was discussed at length by Henry of Ghent29 but 
gained new prominence in the sixteenth century, particularly through the 
rediscovery of Plato’s Cratylus and the commentary by Marsilio Ficino. 
Smiglecius considered two possibilities30. First, there is onomatopeia, 
by which tara tantara represents the sound of a trumpet, and coax the 
sound of a frog through similarity. Obviously there can only be a few such 
words. Second, there is the possibility of a similarity between the type of

sound produced in uttering the word and the properties of the type of thing 
referred to. Here Couto suggested that the word for lion might be taken 
to manifest majesty and terror, and the word for nightingale to manifest 
sweetness. Such supposed cases of natural signiﬁ cation were rejected by 
Couto31, and even more forcefully by Smiglecius32. The latter remarked 
that even the words instituted by Adam do not reveal natures, for they still 
exist in the sacred tongue of Hebrew, and no one has ever learned what 
they signify without being taught. 
Sebastian de Couto had a similarly matter-of-fact attitude to Adam’s 
language, for he remarked that the truest interpretation of Genesis was 
that Adam called the animals by the same names that were still used at 
the time of Moses, the supposed author of Genesis33. Here he may have 
been echoing Olivi, whose commentary on Genesis was published in 
1573 but attributed to Aquinas34. Nonetheless, while Couto displayed a 
healthy scepticism about most of the claims concerning the possibility of a 
language that was natural in any interesting sense, he did hold to the view 
that Adam’s position was a very special one, in that he received the gift of 
language by divine infusion, rather than by making his own choices, and 
he suggested that the same applied to other languages35. In his commentary 
on Aristotle’s Perihermeneias, the earlier German logician and theologian, 
Johannes Eckius, had expressed the same view more fully. He argued that 
after the destruction of the Tower of Babel, God had infused such languages 
as German into human beings, and that these languages can only be said 
to signify ad placitum if we regard God as the impositor, or if we say that 
they are as if they had been imposed36.

parte non sunt impositae ab aliquo primo impositore, sed is qui interfuit aediﬁ cationi

acceperunt a deo infundente voculas rerum Germanicas. Possunt tamen dici signiﬁ care 
ex impositione quia deus supplevit vicem imponentis, aut quia perinde signiﬁ cant ac si 
fuissent ab illis imposita ad signiﬁ candum».

E. JENNIFER ASHWORTH
While none of these authors held the strong view of natural signiﬁ cation, 
there was a weaker theory, held by Domingo de Soto and Rubius, whereby 
the signiﬁ cation of spoken language can be not only ad placitum but also 
natural in the special sense of being somehow appropriate to the things 
spoken of37. According to this view, to say that words signify ad placitum 
does not mean that they are instituted in an arbitrary and random way, for 
any institution must involve the use of human reason, and be motivated by 
knowledge of the things to be named. Adam’s initial institution of words 
was regarded as particularly important here, given that unfallen Adam was 
supposed to have perfect knowledge of essences. This moderate approach, 
which is that of Thomas Aquinas38, can be viewed as an attempt to reconcile 
two key texts. On the one hand, we have Aristotle’s deﬁ nition of the noun 
or name as a spoken sound that, in Boethius’s Latin translation, signiﬁ es 
secundum placitum; on the other hand, we have Adam’s naming of the 
animals in Genesis 2.19, and the claim that «whatsoever Adam called every 
living creature, that was the name thereof». This claim seems to have been 
construed as saying that a name signiﬁ es a ratio, a concept or Aquinas’s 
inner word, that corresponds to the essential nature of the thing spoken of, 
even though we may not fully grasp that nature, and even though the actual 
sound we choose is itself arbitrarily chosen. Through our words we carve 
up the world in the correct way, and we do so whether we speak Latin or 
French or any other language. 
Imposition and Authority
Apart from Soto, none of the Parisian logicians seem to have been 
interested in the claim that there was a special appropriateness about the 
37 Domingo de Soto, Summulae, f. Vvb: «Unde non dicitur terminus signiﬁ care 
ad placitum, quia ex mera voluntate, nulla ratione alliciente, fuerit impositus, cum 
impositores nominum ratione sumpta ex naturis rerum imponant nomina ipsa naturis

est nomen eius, id est, omne nomen quod Adam imposuit rebus, ipsum est quod 
earum nature maxime congruit)»; Antonius Rubius, Commentarii, p. 373B. See

words chosen by Adam, and still less were they interested in the claim that 
he received the gift of language by divine infusion. They did insist that a 
spoken sound requires initial imposition or institution before it becomes 
signiﬁ cant, but whether or not this was the work of Adam alone, or of 
several ﬁ rst impositors, all of whom were endowed with authority, or of 
entire communities, tended to remain an open question. Peter of Ailly 
had focused on imposition by a community, either as a whole or through 
someone with authority who acted on behalf of the whole community39, 
and Soto spoke of the state as an institution having the authority to impose 
signiﬁ cation40. Juan de Celaya added that being in a position of authority 
was not enough, for the community must accept the proposed institution. 
He gave the example of the Roman emperor Domitian who wanted a month 
named after him, but did not succeed in persuading the community to use 
the new word41. 
The insistence on the place of authority in the process of language 
formation was intended to preserve us from inﬁ nite mutability, as Versor 
had pointed out42. If everyone has the power to impose words as they please, 
we will never be able to understand one another. Versor’s contemporary, the 
Cologne Thomist Lambertus de Monte (†1499), argued at greater length 
that there were two kinds of ad placitum signiﬁ cation. One kind was at 
the pleasure of this person or that, and hence was variable and contingent. 
The other was at the pleasure of the ﬁ rst institutor, and this was ﬁ rm and 
invariable because it was based on knowledge of the things signiﬁ ed. 
Even though the ﬁ rst impositor no longer exists, his pleasure continues to 
exist virtually in the effects of his imposition, namely, the words that he 
instituted43.
39 Peter of Ailly, Conceptus, sig. a4vb wrote: «signiﬁ care ad placitum non est 
aliud quam institutio facta per voluntatem et per placitum alicuius totius communitatis 
vel alicuius habentis auctoritatem et gerentis vicem totius communitatis aliquid vel 
aliqua vel aliqualiter representare».
40 Domingo de Soto, Summulae, f. Vvb: «Autentica <institutio> est que ﬁ t a re 
publica vel ab habente auctoritatem eius, et virtute talis impositionis simpliciter dicitur

The general recognition that the ﬁ rst impositor need not be Adam, and 
that communities as a whole might play that role, allowed for the imposition 
of new words as time went on. It also allowed for the deposition (depositio) 
of words that had been instituted. Lax said that any word that could be 
imposed could also be deposed44, and Coronel remarked that kings and 
princes often deposed terms through laws and statutes45. Soto added that 
although a deposed term lost its signiﬁ cation at the moment of deposition, 
custom might allow it to stay in the memory for a few days46. 
A further issue was raised by the anonymous author of a ﬁ fteenth-
century commentary on Peter of Spain, namely what do we say if both the 
world and the Latin language are eternal? The author’s response allowed 
great ﬂ exibility. One could say that many terms may nonetheless have been 
imposed to signify by one individual, who would then have been the ﬁ rst 
institutor. After all, even if the Latin language existed from eternity, it need 
not be the case that every word existed from eternity. Alternatively, even if 
the word «homo» had always signiﬁ ed men, its signiﬁ cation could still be 
ad placitum, because it would signify at the pleasure of the Latin-speaking 
community. That is, it would signify by custom. Accordingly, a vox that 
signiﬁ es ad placitum can be deﬁ ned as one that signiﬁ es by the will of a 
ﬁ rst impositor or by voluntary usage or by custom47. 
huius et illius et illud est variabile et contingens. Aliud est placitum primi instituentis 
et tale placitum est ﬁ rmum et invariabile quia est fundatum in rerum proprietatibus que 
necessario conveniunt ipsis rebus et ergo ab eis sumit ﬁ xitudinem et ﬁ rmitatem quare 
voces signiﬁ cative ad placitum semper idem signiﬁ cant apud intelligentes illas. Et si 
dicatur primus impositor non est ergo vox non signiﬁ cat ad placitum suum. Probatur 
consequentia quia deﬁ ciente causa deﬁ cit et effectus. Dicendum quod quamvis prius 
impositor non sit formaliter et essentialiter est tamen virtualiter in suis effectibus, 
scilicet in vocibus signiﬁ cativis ad placitum eius signiﬁ cantibus».

Types of ad placitum signiﬁ cation
We now need to look more closely at the different types of ad placitum 
signiﬁ cation as they were analysed by Parisian logicians, since this will tell 
us a lot more about attitudes to language. Words signifying ad placitum 
were divided in accordance with three types of imposition48. The ﬁ rst group 
signiﬁ ed in accordance with formal or direct imposition. This occurs when 
a term is imposed to signify a particular object, and is used to signify that 
object. Soto used the example of proper names imposed by baptism or by 
reception into a religious order, but other logicians used common nouns. 
The second group of terms that signify ad placitum normally included 
those said to signify in accordance with indirect or consecutive imposition. 
This occurs when a word such as «man» comes to signify something 
representing a real man, for instance when we use it to refer to a painting. 
As Coronel pointed out in his discussion of improper signiﬁ cation, this 
case, which is based on a similitude, involves analogy49. Soto once more 
used a proper name, writing that «Mary» is imposed on the mother of God, 
but can come to signify her image, since this also represents the mother 
of God. Similitude is still involved in Soto’s example, but not all of the 
Parisian authors were concerned with similitude. A very different account 
of the second group was presented by John Major, who saw its members as 
involving the results of interchange between different linguistic groups. He 
mentioned the Saxons, the British, the Germans, and those from Picardy 
and Flanders whose French differs from that of Parisians50.
The third group of terms that signify ad placitum involved those that 
arose from customary imposition. This occurs when a term with primary 
imposition comes to be used in another sense and, according to John 
Major, is a useful way of extending our stock of words51. Some of the 
sic intelligi: Vox signiﬁ cativa ad placitum est vox que ad voluntatem primi instituentis, 
id est ex impositione actu facta, vel voluntario usu vel consuetudine signiﬁ cat aliquid 
scilicet vel aliqua vel aliqualiter […]».

examples given hardly seem to support this claim. Gaspar Lax and his 
follower Juan Dolz both used the case in which a particular utterance such 
as «man» (Lax) or the letter «a» (Dolz) makes people think of donkeys, 
and Celaya used the non-linguistic example of a dog whose appearance 
signiﬁ ed that a man was coming after it, an example that Soto rejected, as 
not involving imposition52. Enzinas also used a non-linguistic example, 
albeit one involving imposition. He instanced a bell that signiﬁ ed either a 
lecture or a meal, depending on the time. Soto’s examples were more to the 
point. He once more employed a proper name in his example of «Nero» 
used to signify a cruel man, and he also gave the example of the expression 
«snake in the grass» used to refer to a deceiver. Both examples obviously 
pertain to the use of metaphor.
In his further discussion of problems that arise in relation to ad 
placitum signiﬁ cation, Gaspar Lax appealed to customary imposition in a 
new way53. Asking whether teaching a language involved a new imposition, 
he raised the problem of Greek speakers who do not know the signiﬁ cation 
of the word «homo», though they may come to learn it.There are two ways 
of responding. One might say that the word was imposed once and for 
all for everyone, but that to know the signiﬁ cation you have to know the 
imposition. Alternatively, and this seemed to be his preferred option, one 
could say that the word was newly imposed for the Greeks, but only in 
the third way. The ﬁ rst impositor imposes in the ﬁ rst and second ways, 
and those who then hand the language on to others do so in the third way, 
through custom. Everyone has the authority to impose in the third way, 
and so the number of speakers of the language is multiplied. We might 
construe Lax as holding that, by some kind of association, we come to 
think of whatever it was that the ﬁ rst impositor intended to signify, and 
perhaps we might add that we intend to use the word as it was used by 
the ﬁ rst impositor, even if our knowledge of his intention and of the thing 
named is defective. 
Some logicians, including Major and Soto, added a fourth group of 
words signifying ad placitum that was composed of those that had received 
an inauthentic imposition: that is, an imposition of terms or indeed of 
complete propositions for use in disputations. This type of imposition 
was not regarded as worthy of further discussion, outside treatises on 
52 Domingo de Soto, Summulae, f. Vva-vb.

obligationes, for it was transitory, and not produced by anyone with 
genuine authority54.
Conclusion
I conclude that the discussion of how human language arises in 
treatises on terms, in commentaries on Aristotle’s Peri hermeneias, and 
in commentaries on Peter of Spain’s Summulae left little room for the 
discussion of a fully-ﬂ edged formal language, and none at all for the 
notion of an uninterpreted system. Certainly so far as the late scholastics 
were concerned this was partly due to the humanist-inspired emphasis on 
ordinary language as opposed to the elaborate formulations of some of the 
Parisian logicians who had treated Latin as a technical, almost artiﬁ cial, 
language, but it was also due to the cognitive orientation of logic, and to the 
frequent emphasis on the non-arbitrary nature of ad placitum signiﬁ cation. 
The category of inauthentic imposition could have allowed a discussion of 
formal languages, but no one I have read went down that road.
Additional note: the meaning of the phrase «ad placitum»
In the light of what has been said above, it seems to me that most 
translations of «ad placitum» in the literature are inappropriate55. The use 
of the word «arbitrary» is at odds with the frequent assumption that an 
impositor acts in accordance with reason and knowledge, and accordingly 
has a special authority. The use of the word «conventional» is even more 
inappropriate, given that a convention can only arise once words have 
been endowed with signiﬁ cation by their impositor or impositors. In his 
translation of Aristotle, Boethius may have taken secundum placitum to 
mean something like «according to what is agreeable», but it is clear that 
late medieval logicians take the phrase to mean «at the pleasure of the

tractatulus, f. 3rb-va; Domingo de Soto, Summulae, f. Vvb.
55 I am certainly not the ﬁ rst person to make this observation. See, e.g., T. S. 
MALONEY, Roger Bacon: The Art and Science of Logic, Pontiﬁ cal Institute of Mediaeval 
Studies, Toronto 2009, pp. XXIV-XXV.

impositor»56. Thus, in his commentary on Buridan’s Summulae, Johannes 
Dorp wrote: «a vox is not called signiﬁ cativa ad placitum because it signiﬁ es 
according to my pleasure or your pleasure or because it signiﬁ es at the 
pleasure of two or three, but because it signiﬁ es at the pleasure of a whole 
community or of someone having authority within a whole community»57.
What Gaspar Lax and John Major had to say about different types of ad 
placitum signiﬁ cation reinforces my belief that «ad placitum» should not 
be translated as «conventional». Conventions arise when the stock of terms 
instituted at the pleasure of an original impositor comes to be customarily 
accepted by groups of speakers and to be extended in various ways. These 
conventional terms are themselves only to be called «ad placitum» in an 
extended sense. A term that is handed on with its original signiﬁ cation has 
that signiﬁ cation from the pleasure of the original impositor or impositors, 
while a term that has some kind of extended signiﬁ cation is ad placitum 
only through its customary relationship to a term with direct ad placitum 
signiﬁ cation.

APPENDIX TO AN IMPOSSIBLE COVER
Careful observers will have noticed that the cover of this volume 
presents some strange features: the text of a medieval manuscript becomes 
a piece of formal notation. The attempt of this very modest appendix is 
to provide the reader with a key to understanding the rationale of the 
formal paraphrase. Thus, for each subdivision of the Latin text, I shall 
provide: ﬁ rstly, a transcription of the text of the manuscript; secondly, a 
translation into English of the transcribed sentence or clause; ﬁ nally, a 
brief explanation of the choices made in formalizing the relevant parts 
of the text. Since the explanation must be appendix-ﬁ t, it is of necessity 
short and, alas, incomplete1. In the present context, my hope is that the 
reader will at least appreciate the effort put into this divertissement and be 
indulgent toward its author.
The text is to be found in the discussion of one of a series of sophismata 
reported and explained in the late-13th-century treatise known as Opus 
puerorum2. In particular, it presents a fallacious argument to the conclusion 
that «the impossible is possible».

T1. Quod autem sit vera «impossibile est possibile» probatur. 
Translation. That «the impossible is possible» is true is now hereby 
proved.
Explanation. The sentence «the impossible is possible» is an indeter-
minate sentence. It can thus be taken either as a universally quantiﬁ ed 
sentence («all that is impossible is possible») or as an existentially 
quantiﬁ ed sentence («something that is impossible is possible»). The 
potential sophist who wants his or her interlocutor to accept the alleged 
proof of this claim is obviously trading on its indeterminateness. However, 
also in view of the following steps in the argument, I have tried to be as 
charitable as possible with the potential sophist and taken the weaker of the 
two readings, i.e. the existential one. 
What is quantiﬁ ed over in the sentence, thus understood? It must 
be items that can be sensibly said to be possible and impossible. One 
candidate are propositions3. Thus, the sentence can be construed as 
3 Given the framework here adopted, propositions are never timelessly true or 
false, but always true or false at a time (and in a world). A few illustrative examples 
will probably help. The proposition expressed by the sentence «The weather is cloudy 
in Geneva» is true at the present time in the actual world (today it is cloudy), but 
it is false at yesterday’s time in the actual world (yesterday it was sunny). Instead, 
the proposition expressed by the sentence «The weather is always cloudy in Geneva» 
is false at every time in the actual world, since in the actual world there is a time 
(yesterday) such that ‘The weather is cloudy in Geneva’ is false at that time: so, in the 
actual world it is not always the case that the weather is cloudy in Geneva. In other 
worlds, the proposition expressed by «The weather is always cloudy in Geneva» is 
true at some time: but if it is true at some time in a world, then it is true at all times 
in that world. Finally, the proposition expressed by the sentence «The sum of two 
and two is four» is true at all times in every world. Reference to times is required 
to make sense of the subsequent steps in the argument. Both alethic and temporal 
modal operators are here best suited, I think, to represent in formal terms the modal 
vocabulary of this sophisma. In any case, reference to both times and worlds need 
not imply any ontological commitment vis-à-vis entities of this kind. Metaphysicians 
who like ‘desert landscapes’ may very well take them as mere set-theoretic structures 
making up the semantic machinery of the formal language. For a technical as well 
as philosophical discussion of an «indexical» approach to mixed modality, cf. M. J. 
CRESSWELL, Entities and Indices, Kluwer, Dordrecht 1990, part III, especially ch. 15.

tantamount to «for some proposition q, q is impossible and q is possible»; 
in formulas, «∃q(¬Mq ∧ Mq)», where «M» stands for an operator of 
generic possibility operator4.
T2. Hæc est vera: «possibile potest esse impossibile vel ﬁ eri».
Translation: This is true: «the possible can be or become impossible».
Explanation. A possible formal rendering of the sentence put within 
quotation marks is «∃q (Mq ∧ (¬Mq ∨ F¬Mq))»5. In the follow-up of 
the argument a ﬁ rst proof is presented for the sentence «the possible can 
become impossible», corresponding to «∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq)». Indeed, the 
sentence «∃q (Mq ∧ (¬Mq ∨ F¬Mq))» is logically equivalent to «∃q (Mq 
∧ ¬Mq) ∨ ∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq))», which in turn may legitimately be inferred 
from «∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq)» using a rule of disjunction-introduction. 
Next to the formal rendering of the sentence, the reader will have 
noticed another curious piece of notation: «〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉». This is a two-
termed sequence indicating the world in which and the time at which the 
sentence is true: in this case, respectively, the actual world, denoted by 
«w@», and the present time, denoted by «tP». The symbol «⊨», put between 
the sequence and a formula, may be read as «veriﬁ es». Clearly, both «〈w@ 
, 〈tP〉〉» and «⊨» belong to the metalanguage in which semantic facts about 
formulas such as, for instance, «MFα» are stated6. The expression «〈w@ , 
〈tP〉〉 ⊨ MFα» (see infra T3), is thus saying that the two-termed sequence 
whose members are the actual world and the one-termed sequence of the 
present time veriﬁ es the formula «MFα». Equivalently, it says that the 
formula «MFα» is true in the actual world at the present time.
4 The operator «M» is here used as an operator of generic possibility, to be 
contrasted with «◊», operator of logical or metaphysical possibility. Similarly for «L», 
to be contrasted with «□». One may very well take them as equivalent: my usage 
here simply follows the stress put on the distinction by CRESSWELL – RINI, The World-
Time Parallel, pp. 10-12. By referring to generic possibility, one can stay clear of 
commitments concerning the speciﬁ c type of possibility involved.
5 «F» is a tense operator which can be read as «Sometime in the future it is the 
case that…». Furthermore, notice that the role of «potest» in T1 is played in the formal 
notation not by the modal operator «M», but by the existential quantiﬁ er.
6 A similar notation, with a brief account of the truth-conditions for the different 
types of formulas, can be found in CRESSWELL – RINI, The World-time Parallel, part I, 
especially ch. 2 and 3; part II, especially ch. 5 and 7.

T3. Probatio: Antichristum fore est possible, haec patet plano,…
Translation: Proof: it is possible that the Antichrist will exist, this is 
quite clear,…
Explanation. The formal rendering of the ﬁ rst premise of the argument, 
«Antichristum fore est possibile», is «MFα». As already pointed out, «M» 
is the generic-possibility operator and «F» the sometime-in-the-future 
tense operator. Finally, «α» refers to the proposition expressed by the 
sentence «the Antichrist exists». 
T4. … sed hoc post tempus Antichristi erit impossibile,…
Translation: …but this after the time of the Antichrist will be 
impossible…
Explanation. There are many ways to understand the «hoc» in T4. I 
take it to correspond to «Antichristum fore»7. T4 can be thus presented, 
as on the cover, as «for any t0: t0 > tA, 〈w@, 〈t0〉〉 ⊨ ¬MFα». There, new 
metalinguistic notation is introduced. In particular: ‘tA’ denotes what 
is denoted by the expression «the time of the Antichrist»; «>» denotes 
the relation of being later than holding between times; ﬁ nally, «t0» is a 
variable (of the meta-language) ranging over times, here picking out any 
time such that («:») it satisﬁ es the condition of being later than the time 
of the Antichrist. A partial justiﬁ cation for this premise is offered in the 
immediate follow-up.
T5. … quia post tempus Antichristi impossibile est futurum non 
esse; 8 
Translation: …because after the time of the Antichrist it is impossible 
that the Antichrist will not exist.
Explanation. There are a series of different possible readings of T5. 
Let me just say that I take it to mean that after the time of the Antichrist it is 
7 A full justiﬁ cation for this choice against some (however plausible) alternatives 
goes beyond the aim of this appendix. The reader will ﬁ nd a discussion of this point in 
Sophismata: histoire d’une pratique philosophique (cf. fn.1).
8 I understand this sentence as if an «Antichristum» were to be understood next 
to «futurum non esse».

 
APPENDIX TO AN IMPOSSIBLE COVER 
505
impossible that the Antichrist did not exist. The apparent conﬂ ict between 
this last formulation and what T5 says is due to the fact that the future tense 
of the clause «futurum non esse [scil. Antichristum]» here refers to a time 
which is future not relative to the time at which the impossibility holds, 
but relative to the time at which the assertion is made, i.e. relative to the 
present9. A proper understanding of the truth-conditions of this sentence 
will thus involve two times, the time after the tempus Antichristi and the 
present time. That is why the reader ﬁ nds on the cover the following: 
«for any t0 > tA, 〈w@, 〈t0, tP〉〉 ⊨ ¬M[tP]¬Fα». This notation is supposed to 
capture the idea that the truth-value of the formula «¬M¬Fα» in the actual 
world w@ at time t0 depends, in a way that can be suitably characterized, 
on the truth-value of the formula «¬Fα» in the actual world w@ at the 
present time tP. In particular, then, this means that at any time t0 after the 
time of the Antichrist it is impossible that it not be the case that, at some 
time which is future relative to the present, the Antichrist exists. This is 
tantamount to saying that after the time of the Antichrist it is impossible 
that the Antichrist did not exist, an idea which relies on the more general 
claim that, at any time, the past is necessary. 
Before moving on, a question still needs to be answered: why does 
T5 count as a justiﬁ cation for the preceding claim contained in T4 that 
after the time of the Antichrist it will be impossible that the Antichrist 
exists? It seems plausible to think that this is because of the background 
assumption that necessarily, the Antichrist exists only once10. With this 
assumption in place, it follows that at a time (any t0: t0 > tA) at which the 
Antichrist does not exist and at which it is true that the Antichrist existed, 
it is impossible that there is a later time t (i.e. a t such that t > t0) at which 
the Antichrist exists. For, suppose there is such a later time, call it t1: this 
would imply that the Antichrist exists twice (because t1 > tA), contrary to 
the supposition.
9 This reading is conﬁ rmed by the solution proposed in the Opus puerorum 
(§ 659), which makes appeal –to put it roughly– to the different time-frameworks 
relative to which the tenses of one and the same sentence may be evaluated.
10 I mean that necessarily, once the Antichrist has ceased to exist, then he or 
she cannot come into existence again. Thus «tA», for the sake of simplicity, can be 
understood as referring to the last instant at which the Antichrist exists.

T6. … ergo possibile potest ﬁ eri impossibile; 
Translation : …therefore the possible can become impossible.
Explanation. The ﬁ rst sub-argument of the fallacy has reached its 
goal: it has been (allegedly) proved that something possible can become 
impossible, in formal notation: ∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq)11. However, how is this 
to follow from the preceding steps? Let us brieﬂ y recapitulate the ﬁ rst two 
premises:
T3*:  
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ MFα
T4*:  
for any t0: t0 > tA, 〈w@, 〈t0〉〉 ⊨ ¬MFα
A possible way to justify the passage from T3*, T4*, on the one hand, 
to the sub-conclusion offered in T6, on the other, is by appealing to a rule 
for the introduction of the F-operator to the effect that if some time veriﬁ es 
a formula, then any earlier time veriﬁ es that same formula preceded by the 
F-operator12. In this way, from T4* one may infer13:
A1: 
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ F¬MFα
Then, by appealing to the rule of introduction of the conjunction, from 
T3* and A1 one gets:
A2:  
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ MFα ∧ F¬MFα
Finally, by appealing to the rule of introduction of the existential 
quantiﬁ er (generalizing from the formula in A2 by replacing «Fα» with the 
propositional variable «q»), one obtains the desired result:
T6*:  
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ ∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq)
11 Cf. supra fn. 5 and the explanation of T2.
12 Such a rule may look like this: for any formula ζ, for every world w, for every 
time t, for every time t’, if t > t’ and 〈w, 〈t〉〉 ⊨ ζ, then 〈w, 〈t’〉〉 ⊨ Fζ. This rule will 
qualify the system where it holds as a system that avoids certain complications linked 
to future contingents: in that system, what is true at a time within a given possible 
world is always determined.
13 The rule at fn.12 can be applied to T4* because of the fact that any t0 > tA will 
also be a t0 > tP, given that tA > tP.

T7: sed omnis propositio <vera> de futuro aliquando erit vera de 
præsenti,…
Translation: …but every proposition <true> of the future at some time 
will be true of the present…
Explanation. This statement, which (as I shall try to clarify elsewhere)14 
is just a consequence of the semantics of the F-operator, may be rendered 
as:
T7*  
 for any formula ζ, for any world w, for any time t, if 
〈w , 〈t〉〉⊨ Fζ , then, for some time t’ such that t’ > t, 〈w , 
〈t’〉〉⊨ζ
T8. <ergo> aliquando erit vera hæc «possibile est impossibile». 
Translation: …<therefore> at some time this sentence will be true: 
‘the possible is impossible’.
Explanation. This second sub-conclusion reached in T8 is different 
from what T2 said. Recall that in T2 the claim was that the possible can 
be or become impossible, rendered in formal notation as «∃q (Mq ∧ ¬Mq) 
∨ ∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq))». Now, on the basis of the second disjunct of the 
previous formula (obtained in T6), i.e.:
T6*:  
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ ∃q (Mq ∧ F¬Mq) , 
the argument moves (presumably through T7*) to:
T8* 
for some tP 〈w@ , 〈t〉〉 ⊨ ∃q (Mq ∧ ¬Mq)
However, moving from T6* to T8* through T7* implicitly presupposes 
one very bad fallacious step:
F1  
〈w@ , 〈tP〉〉 ⊨ F∃q (Mq ∧ ¬Mq)
This move corresponds to the passage from the claim that what is 
possible can become impossible (T6*) to the claim that it will be the case 
14 Cf. fn.1.

508 
PAOLO NATALI
that the possible is impossible. The fallaciousness of this step is captured, 
in the formalization, by the F-operator’s taking in F1 the largest scope. The 
source of the confusion is the ambiguity of the temporal indices implicitly 
associated with the different parts of the sentence «the possibile will be 
impossible». One way to make sense of this claim would be to understand 
it as «it will be the case that what is now possible is then impossible». 
Within an ‘indexical’ framework, that would correspond to something like:
F1* 
for some t: t > tP, 〈w@ , 〈tP, t〉〉 ⊨ F[t]∃q ([tP]Mq ∧ [t]¬Mq)
From F1* one could not conclude to T8*. But T8* is really what the 
sophist needs to make the last step.
T9. Sumendo ergo in illo tempore, tunc hæc est vera «possibile est 
impossibile»,…
Translation: So, take that time. This sentence is then true: «the possible 
is impossible».
Explanation. The argument now proceeds from T8* to the particular 
instance. A particular time tp is taken, for which the following holds:
T9* 
〈w@ , 〈t2〉〉 ⊨ ∃q (Mq ∧ ¬Mq)
T10. … ergo sua conversa erit vera, hæc scilicet «impossibile est 
possibile».
Translation: …therefore its converse will be true, namely this: «the 
impossible is possible». 
The conclusion is ﬁ nally arrived at, thanks to the commutativity of 
conjunction:
T10* 
〈w@ , 〈t2〉〉 ⊨ ∃q (¬Mq ∧ Mq)
A possible way to proceed beyond this step would then be to perform 
an illegitimate generalization from the particular time t2 to every time t15. 
This way, one would obtain a more general statement, probably better 
corresponding to the unrestricted statement of the aim of the proof presented 
in T1. I leave this further step to less charitable readers.
15 The generalization would be illegitimate because t2 was not arbitrarily chosen.

Conclusion
To conclude, I hope that this short appendix will help readers in 
carrying out their thoughts about this sophisma, even in the event that they 
came to prove the very arguments adduced for the reconstruction to be 
fallacious. May my possible mistakes neither be nor become impossible 
to repair16.
16 I should like to thank Laurent Cesalli, Paolo Crivelli, Frédéric Goubier, and 
Robert Michels for their kindness, their help, and their suggestions. The responsibility 
for any shortcomings the reader may ﬁ nd is, quite obviously, only mine.
