A structurally stable crystalline carbon allotrope is predicted by means of the ﬁrst principles
calculations. This allotrope can be derived by substituting each atom in diamond with a carbon
tetrahedron, and possesses the same space group Fd¯3m as diamond, which is thus coined as T-
carbon. The calculations on geometrical, vibrational and electronic properties reveal that T-carbon,
with a considerable structural stability and a much lower density 1.50 g/cm3, is a semiconductor
with a direct band gap about 3.0 eV, and has a Vickers hardness 61.1 GPa lower than diamond
but comparable with cubic boron nitride. Such a form of carbon, once obtained, would have wide
applications in photocatalysis, adsoption, hydrogen storage and aerospace materials.

Carbon is the element that plays a fundamental role for
life on Earth. As it can form sp3-, sp2- and sp-hybridized
chemical bonds, carbon has strong ability to bind itself
with other elements to generate countless organic com-
pounds with chemical and biological diversity, resulting
in the present colorful world. In nature, elemental car-
bon has three best-known allotropes, say, graphite, di-
amond and amorphous carbon. These forms have been
long studied, and their chemical and physical properties
are well disclosed nowadays. Since 1980s, people have
great interest in synthesizing new allotropes of elemental
carbon. The most successful examples include fullerenes
[1], carbon nanotubes [2], and graphene [3].
These
synthesized allotropes give rise to enormous scientiﬁc
and technological impacts in relevant areas of chemistry,
physics, materials and information sciences, leading to
many derivatives, devices and products. With advances
of synthetic tools, a variety of elusive carbon allotropes
such as one-dimensional sp-carbyne, two-dimensional sp-
sp2-graphyne, and three-dimensional (3D) sp-sp3-yne-
diamond, were also obtained or predicted (for review
see e.g. Refs. [4, 5]). Recently, an allotrope of carbon
has been obtained by compressing graphite with pressure
over 17 GPa, whose hardness is even larger than diamond
[6], while its structure is unknown so far. Several carbon
crystalline phases, e.g., monoclinic M-carbon [7] and bct
C4 carbon [8], were therefore proposed to simulate this
synthesized phase.
Moreover, there are still other ex-
perimental and theoretical eﬀorts paid on carbon (e.g.
[9, 10]). It appears that we might enter into the era of
carbon allotropes [5].
In this Letter, by means of the ﬁrst principles calcula-
tions we predict a new allotrope of elemental carbon that
has very intriguing physical properties. This structure
can be obtained by substituting each atom in diamond
by a carbon tetrahedron, forming a 3D cubic crystalline
carbon that possesses the same space group Fd¯3m as di-
amond. This form is thus dubbed as the T-carbon. The
calculated results show that T-carbon, kinetically stable
and with a much lower density 1.50 g/cm3, has a Vick-
ers hardness 61.1 GPa smaller than diamond (93.7 GPa)
but comparable with the cubic boron nitride. Electronic
structures reveal that it is a semiconductor with a direct
band gap around 3.0 eV. The possibility of hydrogen stor-
age in T-carbon is also examined.

Most calculations were performed within the density-
functional theory [11, 12] as implemented within the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [13, 14]
with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [15].
Both local density approximation (LDA) in the form
of Perdew-Zunger [16] and generalized gradient approx-
imation (GGA) developed by Perdew and Wang [17]
were adopted for the exchange correlation potential.
The plane-wave cutoﬀenergy is taken as 400 eV. The
Monkhorst-Pack scheme was used to sample the Bril-
louin zone [18], and a mesh of 8×8×8 k-point sampling
was used for the calculations. The geometries were opti-

mized when the remanent Hellmann-Feynman forces on
the ions are less than 0.01 eV/˚A. The calculations of
phonon spectra and electronic structures were performed
using Quantum-ESPRESSO package [19], where 8×8×8
k-mesh was used.
Inspired by the structural connection between methane
and tetrahedrane, where the latter can be obtained by
replacing each carbon atom in methane with a carbon
tetrahedron, we may construct, likewise, a new allotrope
of carbon by substituting each carbon atom in diamond
by a carbon tetrahedron, as indicated in Fig. 1. Luck-
ily, the stability of such a structure was veriﬁed and
optimized by the ﬁrst principles calculations.
In this
new structure, each unit cell contains two tetrahedrons
with eight carbon atoms, and the lattice constant is
about 7.52 ˚A. The three unit vectors are ⃗a = l/2(1, 1, 0),
⃗b = l/2(0, 1, 1) and ⃗c = l/2(1, 0, 1). The carbon atoms oc-
cupy the Wyckoﬀposition 32e (x, x, x) with x = 0.0706.
The lattice constant (l), equilibrium density (ρ), bond
length (d), cohesive energy (Ecoh), energy gap (Eg) be-
tween valence and conduction bands, bulk modulus (B)
and Vickers hardness (Hv) at zero pressure of cubic and
hexagonal diamond, graphite, M-carbon, bct C4, and T-
carbon are computed and summarized in Table I for a
comparison.
Note that all data presented here, apart
from the sources indicated, were obtained by ourselves
using the same method as the T-carbon, which can thus
be compared reasonably at the same level.
It is seen
that there exist two distinct bonds with length 1.502 ˚A
(intra-tetrahedron) and 1.417 ˚A (inter-tetrahedron) for
T-carbon, respectively, both of which are smaller than
those of diamond. There are also two diﬀerent bond an-
gles, 60◦in tetrahedron, and 144.74◦between two in-
equivalent bonds.
The former is much less than that
in diamond (109.5◦), implying that a strain exists in
T-carbon higher than that in diamond, which proba-
bly leads to the raise of the total energy. Indeed, our
calculations conﬁrm that the cohesive energy per atom
of the T-carbon is 6.573 eV, around 1 eV/atom smaller
than other forms of carbon at the GGA level, suggest-
ing that this structure might be less thermodynamical
stable against those allotropes at zero pressure. The re-
markable feature is that the equilibrium density (ρ) of
T-carbon is the smallest (1.50 g/cm3) among diamond,
graphite, M-carbon and bct C4. This is conceivable, be-
cause T-carbon, if compared with other forms of carbon,
has large interspaces between carbon atoms along cer-
tain directions (Fig.
1), and the volume per atom is
about twice larger than those of diamond, M-carbon and
bct C4, or 1.5 times larger than graphite, while its bulk
modulus is only 36.4% of cubic diamond. Owing to the
large interspaces between atoms, the hydrogen storage in
T-carbon may be expected. Our computations show that
it is indeed possible to store hydrogen molecules into the
T-carbon, and the gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen
capacities are calculated to be around 7.7 wt % and 0.12
Kg H2/l, respectively.
Similar to c-diamond, T-carbon has also three elastic
constants, C11, C12 and C44, which are calculated with
GGA to be 225 GPa, 141 GPa and 89 GPa, respectively.
With the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation [23], we can ac-
quire the bulk and shear modulus of T-carbon, say 169
GPa and 70 GPa, respectively.
The Vickers hardness
Hv of T-carbon is 61.1 GPa that is obtained from an em-
pirical formula [24] H(GPa) = 350[(N 2/3
e
)e−1.191fi]/d2.5,
where Ne is the electron density of valence electrons per
˚A3, d is the bond length, and fi is the ionicity of the

3
chemical bond in a crystal scaled by Phillips [25]. Fol-
lowing the same settings, the Vickers hardness of dia-
mond is obtained to be 93.7 GPa (in comparison to the
experimental value 96 ± 5 GPa). In this sense, T-carbon
is around 1/3 softer than diamond, and is comparable
with the c-BN (whose Hv is 64 GPa [24]). These above
features together with a much lower density suggest that
the T-carbon, once synthesized, might have broad appli-
cations.
Fig. 2 plots the total energy per atom against the vol-
ume per atom for the T-carbon, hexagonal diamond, cu-
bic diamond, graphite, M-carbon and bct C4 allotropes.
It can be observed that the total energy of T-carbon as
a function of volume per atom has a single minimum,
showing that the geometrical structure would be stable.
For a comparison, we also calculate the total energies per
atom for other allotropes of carbon, and observe that the
minimum total energy per atom of graphite is the low-
est, and the other allotropes bear higher minimum total
energies per atom, while that of T-carbon is the highest,
say -7.92 eV/atom, suggesting that T-carbon could be a
thermodynamically metastable phase against diamond,
graphite, M-carbon and bct-C4 allotropes.

of volume per atom for T-carbon, cubic diamond (c-diamond),
hexagonal diamond (h-diamond), graphite, M-carbon and bct
C4 allotropes.
To conﬁrm further the mechanical stability, the phonon
spectra of T-carbon are calculated, as shown in Fig. 3.
No imaginary phonon modes in T-carbon are found, im-
plying again the kinetical stability of T-carbon.
The
highest phonon frequency of T-carbon is about 1760
cm−1, larger than that of diamond (1303 cm−1). It is
instructive to note that there exists a wide direct band
gap (325 cm−1) of phonons between the frequency 739 -
1064 cm−1 at Γ point.

ble experimental observation, we also simulate the X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) spectra of T-carbon and c-diamond
with wavelength 1.54059 ˚A. The results are presented in
Fig. 4. Diﬀerent from diamond where the peaks of (111)
at 2θ = 43.94◦, (022) at 75.31◦and (113) at 91.51◦are
observed obviously, only one sharp XRD peak of (111) at
20.44◦with a strong intensity is seen for T-carbon, and
the peaks of (022) at 33.68◦, (222) at 39.72◦, (133) at
50.7◦, (115) at 61.35◦are negligibly small. This is very
similar to graphite, where a sharp XRD peak of (002) ap-
pears with several other small peaks. These features may
be helpful for identifying the T-carbon in experiments.

and c-diamond. The X-ray wavelength we use is 1.54059 ˚A.
Now let us look at the electronic structures and den-
sity of states (DOS) of T-carbon, as given in Fig. 5. One
may see that at the GGA level there is a direct band
gap 2.25 eV at Γ point, suggesting that the T-carbon is a
direct-band-gap semiconductor. From the DOS, the band
gap is also clearly indicated. To calculate the band gap
more accurately, the B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter,

4
Lee-Yang-Parr) exchange-correlation functional [26, 27]
is used.
The band gap of T-carbon is obtained to be
2.968 eV. We also note that the band gap of T-carbon
can be manipulated by doping, which would be useful for
photocatalysis. With the same method, the band gap of
c-diamond is calculated to be 5.799 eV, being comparable
with its experimental value 5.45 eV. In addition, the com-
putations on the projected DOS (PDOS) of each carbon
atom show that the PDOS for 2px, 2py and 2pz orbitals
are the same, much larger than that of 2s orbitals, illus-
trating that the wave functions of valence electrons in the
T-carbon are recombined, leading to extreme anisotropic
sp3-hybridized bonds. Particularly, the charge popula-
tion analysis reveals that the electron density around
the inter-tetrahedron bonds is much higher than that
on the intra-tetrahedron bonds, showing that the inter-
tetrahedron bonds are relatively strong, which are also
consistent with their short bond length, and can balance
the strain of the carbon tetrahedron cage, thereby mak-
ing the whole structure stable.

In summary, we have predicted a novel carbon al-
lotrope dubbed as T-carbon that has the same space
group Fd¯3m as diamond by means of the ﬁrst-principles
calculations. This new structure can be derived by sub-
stituting each atom in diamond with a carbon tetrahe-
dron, and its structural stability is checked and optimized
at both LDA and GGA levels. The calculations on the
mechanical and electronic properties of T-carbon show
that it is, with a much lower density and a bulk modu-
lus than diamond, a semiconductor with a direct band
gap about 3.0 eV. The Vickers hardness of T-carbon is
found 35% smaller than cubic diamond but comparable
with that of cubic boron nitride. The XRD pattern is
observed to have features similar to that of graphite.
The possibility of hydrogen storage in T-carbon is also
attested. Upon obtained, the amazing T-carbon would
have wide applications in photocatalysis, adsorption, hy-
drogen storage, and aerospace materials.
