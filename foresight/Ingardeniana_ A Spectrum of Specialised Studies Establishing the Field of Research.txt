INTRODUCTION 
Studies on different aspects of Roman Ingarden's Philosophy have been 
published during the last thirty years. They were meant partly to in-
vestigate the contribution of that thinker to phenomenological philoso-
phy, which was then dominant in WestemEurope, partly to arouse 
interest in a philosopher who was, at that time, practically unknown. 
The publication by the present editor of For Roman Ingarden: Nine 
Essays in Phenomenology, a Festschrift for his 65th birthday, marked the 
beginning of an interest in his thought. Subsequently, Ingarden has 
lectured abroad, and a number of his hitherto inaccessible Polish works 
have been made available, some translated into German and some even 
into English. This has led to further studies of his thought. 
However, the majority of the papers published have until now been 
mainly introductory. This volume offers for the first time a series of 
systematic studies in Ingardenian philosophy, which, it is hoped, will 
supply a general framework as well as a foundation for future research 
in this wide and difficult field. 
The volume contains, in addition, a part of the Oslo Lectures by In-
garden, given toward the end of his life. They are made public here for 
the first time in their original German transcription, corrected by the 
author himself; printed with this lecture is the only preserved letter of 
Ingarden to Husserl, written during an early stage in the former's philo-
sophical development. The lectures contain Ingarden's criticism of 
HusserI, enunciated within the context of Ingarden's clarification of the 
so-called 'phenomenological reduction'; and as such, they go beyond 
what was already known from the previously published correspondence 
between Ingarden and his master Husseri. The letter, written, on the 
contrary, at the early stage of Ingarden's development, shows criticism 
of the master in the perspective of the newly emerging intuition of a mind 
preparing in his own way to deal with the same issues. An English 
translation of the letter, made by Professor Helmut Gimdt, is published 
here for the first time.

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUK TION 
Vorlesung gehalten an der Universitiit Oslo, Oktober/November 1967 
ERSTE TEILAUSGABE DES ORIGINALTEXTES 
PHANOMENOLOGIE 
7. Vorlesung 
27 Oktober 1967 
Ich werde heute meinem Plane gemaB tiber die nattirliche Welt und die 
Generalthesis der nattirlichen Welt sprechen und dann tiber die soge-
nannte transzendentale phanomenologische Reduktion. Es ist zur Zeit 
Sitte, daB man sagt, es gibt zwei Reduktionen, namlich die eine ist die 
eidetische Reduktion und die andere ist eben diese 'transzendentale 
phanomenologische' Reduktion. Ich habe gesagt, es ist zur Zeit Sitte. 
Als ich noch in der Phanomenologie Anfanger war, sprach man in Got-
tingen nicht von zwei Reduktionen. Man sprach vor dem Jahre 1913, 
vor der Publikation der Ideen Husserls, im Allgemeinen von keiner 
eidetischen Reduktion, sondem bloB von der 'Einstellung' auf das Wesen, 
auf die 'Idee'. In den Vorlesungen von Husserl trat nattirlich das Wort 
'Reduktion' auch friiher auf, vor dem Jahre 1913. Aber erst nach den 
Ideen hat man die Frage nach der Reduktion wirklich diskutiert; doch 
sprach man fast ausschlieBlich von derjenigen Reduktion, die man 
'transzendentale' Reduktion nennt. 
In den Ideen 1 steht der Ausdruck 'eidetische Reduktion' nur ein 
einziges Mal, und zwar in der Einleitung (S. 4). An einigen anderen 
Stellen kann man nur erraten, daB es sich darum handelt. 
Spater habe ich diesen Ausdruck 'eidetische Reduktion' u.a. bei Max 
Scheler gefunden - und zwar in dem Sinne, daB er nicht bereit war, die 
transzendentale Reduktion mitzumachen, die eidetische Reduktion da-
gegen fand er noch sinnvoll. 
Beide Reduktionen sind unzweifelhaft zu berticksichtigen, weil Pha-
nomenologie doch eine Wissenschaft vom BewuBtsein sein solI, die sich 
von anderen Wissenschaften, welche sich auch mit dem BewuBtsein be-
schaftigen - vor allem von der Psychologie - wesensmaBig unterscheiden

solI. Und da, sagt man, gibt es zwei Unterschiede. Erstens, ist die Psycho-
logie eine empirische Wissenschaft von Realitaten, von Menschen, die 
dies und jenes erleben und psychisch-physische Realitaten sind. Die 
Phanomenologie dagegen ist keine empirische Wissenschaft, so wie sie 
von Husserl geplant wurde. Denn es gibt am Anfang der Ideen eine 
Stelle, wo Husserl sagt, wir konnten auch eine nicht-eidetische Phano-
menologie bilden, die sich auf Erlebnisse, BewuBtseinserlebnisse stiitzt, 
die dann aber Irrealitiiten heiBen. Eben dies ist der zweite Punkt, wo-
durch sich die Phanomenologie von der Psychologie unterscheidet. Die 
Psychologie beschaftigt sich mit Erlebnissen als AuBerungen eines realen 
psycho-physischen Individuums. Die Phanomenologie dagegen beschaf-
tigt sich mit Erlebnissen, die, wie man sagt, 'gereinigt' sind. Wovon? 
Von der Auffassung, daB sie Realitaten innerhalb der Welt sind. Um 
diese Reinigung vollziehen zu konnen, muB man besondere Mittel haben, 
besondere technische Mittel, - das ist die E1tOxi] und die 'transzenden-
tale' Reduktion *. Wenn man von den Tatsachlichkeiten und, sagen wir, 
Realitaten zu etwas kommen will, was nur zufallig Realitat ist, braucht 
man Boch etwas anderes, muB man namlich die Einstellung auf das Wesen 
vollziehen - und hier greift die zweite Reduktion ein, die eidetische Re-
duktion. Also das ist der Plan: Diese beiden Punkte sollen durch diese 
beiden Reduktionen irgendwie hergestellt, realisiert werden. 
Nun, ich werde mit der Reduktion anfangen, die sozusagen an zweiter 
Stelle steht, d.h. die eidetische. Man kann zwar Phiinomenologie be-
treiben ohne diese Reduktion, will man aber die Phiinomenologie als 
eine eidetische Wissenschaft betreiben, so muB man tiber die individu-
ellen Verlaufe des reinen BewuBtseins hinausgehen, und somit die eide-
tische Reduktion anwenden. Um sie zu erklaren, ist es notwendig, bei 
der Auffassung des Wesens bei Husserl anzukniipfen. Halten wir also 
zunachst in den Schriften Husserls eine Umschau. Erstens, gibt es ver-
schiedene Phasen der Auffassung des Wesens, und zweitens, gibt es auch 
verschiedene Auffassungen der Erlebnisse, die uns zu dem Wesen fiihren. 
Der erste Schritt wurde von Husserl in den 'Logischen Untersuchungen' 
vorgenommen. In der 2. und 6. Untersuchung ist von der 'Species' die 
Rede. 'Species' - das ist die ideale Qualitat, das ist das, was man hat, 
wenn man beim Vergleich von zwei weiBen Dingen sagt: ja, sie sind 
* In den Ideen I scheint es, daB Husser! diese beiden Ausdriicke promiscue verwendet, 
erst in der Krisis hat er diese beiden Funktionen deutlich unterschieden. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION

gleich weiB, - und zwar konnen sie es in Bezug auf ein bestimmtes Was, 
das Weiss, sein. Das 'Weiss' ist nicht das Individuelle, das eine oder das 
andere Ding, sondern es ist diese Species, die in den heiden verschiedenen 
Fallen identisch in Erscheinung tritt. Vom Wesen von Dingen, vom 
Wesen des Menschen wird da eigentIich nicht gesprochen. Es wird bloB 
auf diese Species hingewiesen, und das ist immer irgendeine einfache 
oder synthetische Qualitat. In den spateren Publikationen HusserIs er-
scheint in einem Moment das Wort 'Wesen', an stelle der 'Species'; neben 
dem 'Wesen' wird nicht mehr das Wort 'Species', sondern das griechische 
Wort 'Eidos' verwendet. Es ist von eidetischen Wissenschaften die Rede, 
insbesondere von der eidetischen Phanomenologie. Fragen wir uns, wie 
dieses 'Wesen' in den ersten Band der Ideen eingefiihrt wurde, so finden 
wir eine Reihe von ganz kurzen Behauptungen, die zum Teil nicht mit-
einander ubereinstimmen und die zusammen auch sehr wenig daruber 
sagen, was dieses We sen ist. 
Ferner war in den Logischen Untersuchungen als ein Pendant zu der 
'Species' auch von der Erfassung dieser Species die Rede, und sie hieB 
damals 'Ideation'. Ideation - das war dieser besondere Akt, in dem man 
diese Species erfassen konnte, eventuell wirklich erfaBte. In den Ideen 
verschwindet der Ausdruck 'Ideation', wird bloB manchmal in Paren-
these gesetzt, und ein anderer Ausdruck tritt auf: Wesensschau oder 
Wesenserschauung. EigentIich finden wir in den Ideen nur zwei nahere 
Bestimmungen davon, zunachst, daB diese Wesensschau wirklich ein an-
schaulicher Akt ist, daB sie wirklich Erschauung ist, - kein Gedanke, 
kein bloBes Denken, sondern 'Schauen'. - Dieses Wort 'Schauen' hat 
iibrigens Scheler sehr geliebt. - Das ist also der eine Punkt. Es ist gerade 
so 'Anschauung', wie die sinnliche Erfahrung. Doch ist es von der sinn-
lichen Anschauung verschieden, es ist auch von der immanenten Wahr-
nehmung des Individuellen radikal verschieden. Aber wie? Das wird 
nicht gesagt. An Beispielen sollen wir uns orientieren, daB wir wissen: 
Jetzt haben wir es mit der Wesenserschauung zu tun und nicht mit einer 
empirischen Erfassung dieser Farbe, von diesem Tisch zum Beispiel. Es 
muB da irgendeine andere Einstellung geben, und dann hekommt man 
erst die Erschauung. 
Spater, viele Jahre nach den Ideen, namlich im Jahre 1925, hat HusserI 
eine andere Theorie dazu in gewissem Sinne angebaut. Ich habe im Jahre 
1927 das Manuskript gesehen, es war ungefahr 30-40 Seiten. Auf dem 

4 
ROMANINGARDEN 
ersten Blatt stand mit blauem Bleistift geschrieben Variation 1925. Es 
wurde spiiter aufgenommen in das Buch, das nach dem Tode Husseds un-
ter dem Titel Erfahrung und Urteil erschienen ist. - Dort finden wir etwas 
mehr tiber diese, sagen wir, unmittelbare apriorische Erkenntnis, und es 
taucht auch dieser Begriff 'Variation' auf, als eine besondere Operation, 
die uns verhilft, das Wesen von etwas zu erfassen. Das ist also eine spiitere 
Auffassung, die mit einer neuen, bei Hussed in den Ideen noch nicht 
vorhandenen Auffassung der Ideation zusammenhiingt. Wir mtissen uns 
also damit begntigen, zu erfahren: Es ist Anschauung, es ist wesentlich 
verschieden von der Erfahrung irn engeren Sinne. 
Weiter wird noch etwas gesagt: Es wird bei der Wesenserschauung auf 
die Zufa1ligkeit verzichtet, - zufallig ist das Reale, das Tatsiichliche. 
Auch wird auf die Individualitiit des sen, was uns in der Erfahrung vor-
liegt, verzichtet, wenn wir zu dieser Anschauung iibergehen. Warum solI 
da auf etwas verzichtet werden? Nun, weil hier mit einer empirischen 
Erfahrung oder empirischen Anschauung angefangen wird, mit einem, 
sagen wir, individuellen Ding, und erst als ein Uberbau oder eine Trans-
formation dieser urspriinglichen empirischen Erfassung tritt etwas an-
deres ein, niimlich die "Ideation", die Wesenserfassung. Es muB auf et-
was verzichtet werden, was in der ersten Anschauung da war und in der 
zweiten gar nicht mehr vorhanden ist: eben diese Individualitiit, - die 
Individualitiit des zufalligen empirischen Dinges. 
Vnd dazu gehort jetzt die Theorie: Es gibt individueHe, tatsiichlich 
existierende Dinge, wirkliche Dinge, die eben als tatsiichlich sich vor 
aHem dadurch auszeichnen, daB sie zufallig sind. Zufallig worin? irn 
Sein? im Beschaffensein? Es gibt da gar keine Notwendigkeiten, scheint 
es, als Gegensatz zum Zufall. Nun, da sagt der Naturwissenschaftler: es 
gibt doch Notwendigkeiten, - es gelten ja doch die empirischen Gesetze, 
Kausalgesetze, die ganze Physik usw. Was ist denn das Zufallige, in dieser 
Welt, wo nichts zufallig ist? fragt man. Es ist doch alles eindeutig be-
stimmt durch die Lage der kausalen Bedingungen, unter welchen es zu 
etwas kommt, nicht wahr. - Da sagt Hussed: Ja, ja, das sind empirische 
Regelungen, die eben gerade zufallig sind - sie konnten doch ganz anders 
sein. Es mtiBte nicht so eine Welt sein, wie diejenige, in der wir leben, 
eine solche Welt, in der solche kausale Gesetze gelten. Das sind bloB 
Regeln, das sind keine strengen Gesetze. Vnd er sagt weiter: Zum Wesen 
des Individuellen gehort es, daB es auch anders sein konnte. Es ist freilich 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
5 
so, wie es da ist, aber es konnte doch zerschlagen werden, es konnte nicht 
braun, sondem rot sein, es konnte nicht so durchsichtig, sondem un-
durchsichtig sein usw. Es gehort eben zu seinem Wesen, daB es anders 
sein konnte. Vnd dann noch weiter: Zu dem empirischen Ding da ge-
hort es, daB es sich jetzt gerade hier befindet, gerade an dieser Stelle, -
aber es miiBte nicht unbedingt hier sein, es konnte dort sein, und es 
konnte in diesem Moment auch gar nicht da sein, - ich konnte ja z.B. 
mit dieser Bri11e dort hineingehen und sie unterwegs fallen lassen, sie 
wiirde zerbrechen und gar nicht mehr da sein, nicht wahr. Also zum 
Wesen des empirischen Dinges gehort es, daB es nicht so sein muj3, wie 
es ist, und daB es auch in einem anderem Raum und in einer anderen 
Zeit sein konnte, als es tatsachlich ist. DaB es tatsiichlich so ist und hier 
ist - dafiir sind die kausalen Gesetze verantwortlich,. sagt man. Aber es 
konnte doch ganz anders sein, nicht wahr, es brauchte nicht so zu sein. 
Ja, und jetzt kommt dieser Kontrast zwischen dem individuellen zu-
falligen Gegenstand, der anders sein konnte, irgendwo anders sein konnte 
und in einer anderen Zeit sein konnte - und seinem Wesen. Dieses Wesen 
ist gerade so, daB es dem Gegenstand vorschreibt so zu sein, oder ihm 
ermoglicht, anders zu sein. Man fragt sich: Nun, was ist mit diesem 
'Wesen', und zwar dem Wesen eines Dinges gemeint? Es kommt schon 
nicht mehr auf die Species an, auf eine besondere Qualitat, im Hinblick 
auf welche zwei Dinge z.B. rot sind. Es kommt auf das Wesen eines 
Dinges, eines Menschen oder eines Vorgangs an, - und zwar dieses in-
dividuellen Dinges da. Ja, was ist aber dieses Wesen? Das wird bei 
Husserl nicht eindeutig gesagt. Zunachst - und das wird bei Husserl 
unterstrichen - zunachst ist es das Was des Dinges, - also was es eigent-
lich ist. Dieses Wort 'Was' bei Husserl hat sich dann bei anderen Leuten 
zu einem besonderen Substantivum gestaltet, z.B. Max Scheler spricht 
immer von 'Washeiten'. - Wenn wir in der Geschichte der Philosophie 
weit genug zuriickgehen, finden wir etwas Ahnliches - das ist das ti, das 
ti einai von einem tode ti. Z.B. dieses Ding ist eine Brille, dessen ti ist 
'Brillheit' (wenn Sie das Wort erlauben); und das ist ein Tisch, - dessen 
ti ist eben 'Tischheit' usw. Es scheint, daB dieses Was immer generell ist, 
- aber es so11 in diesem Individuum verkorpert sein, nicht wahr. Einer-
seits dieses Etwas, was dieser Tisch zum Tische macht, - aber anderer-
seits diese 'Tischheit' generell verstanden, die es auch zum Tisch macht. 
Das scheint dieselbe Situation zu sein, wie einst bei Aristoteles, nicht 

6 
ROMANINGARDEN 
wahr, daB das Eine in dem betreffenden Ding se1bst, in dem tode ti, in 
dem Individuum irgendwie verk6rpert sein solI, und was zugleich to 
katholou ist, das heiBt 'Das-im-Allgemeinen'. Wenn wir dabei bleiben 
sollten, dann wurde es unversHindlich sein, warum ich die Auffassung, 
von der 'Variation' als Operation des Entdeckens des Wesens erwahnt 
habe. 
Doch gibt es eine andere Erklarung von HusserI uber das Wesen: Ein 
individueller Gegenstand ist nicht bloB uberhaupt ein individueller, ein 
dies da, tode ti, ein einmaliger, - er hat als in sich selbst so und so be-
schaffener seine Eigenart, seinen Bestand an wesentlichen Pradikabilien, 
die ihm als Seiendem zukommen mussen, wie er an sich se1bst ist, damit 
ihm andere, sekundare, zufallige Bestimmungen zukommen k6nnen. 
Also jetzt sieht die Sache ganz anders aus, es ist gar keine Washeit, - die 
Washeit, das ist bloB ein Moment, das ist die 'Tischheit', individuell 
oder nicht-individuell genommen. - Es ist demgegenuber ein Bestand 
von wesentlichen Pradikabilien, die ihm zukommen mussen, damit ihm 
andere, sekundare zukommen k6nnen. Also in dem Gesamtbestand des 
Dinges, d.h. eines individuellen Gegenstandes, ist jetzt eine merkwiirdige 
Scheidung vorgenommen worden. -
Nicht aIle Bestimmtheiten sind 
gleichwertig, kann man sagen, nicht jede Bestimmtheit ist in demselben 
Sinne verankert und - durfen wir ein anderes Wort verwenden - nicht 
in demselben Sinne fUr das betreffende Ding konstitutiv, - sondem es 
gibt welche, die sekundar, konsekutiv sind. Da genugt also nicht diese 
Ideation, die mich zur Species fiihrt, - es ist jetzt notwendig, zunachst-
mal das Was zu fassen und dann diese sogenannten wesentlichen Pradi-
kabilien zu entdecken, die eine besondere Rolle in dem ganzen Gegen-
stand ausuben. 
Nun, ich habe mir erIaubt, auf die Tradition zuruckzugreifen. Wenn 
ich die Metaphysik von Aristoteles studiere, kann ich mich schon etwas 
orientieren. Das Was an einem tode ti, - das ist das ti einai, was es ist, 
nicht wahr, und das habe ich 'Natur' genannt. Dnd das Andere, diese 
wesentlichen Pradikabilien, ist das poion eina; poion - wie ist das, was 
Tisch ist, wie ist das weiter bestimmt? Ja, es gibt viele Bestimmtheiten, 
die aIle zusammen dieses po ion ausmachen, aber jetzt muB eine Scheidung 
vorgenommen werden. Innerhalb dieses po ion mussen manche Bestimmt-
heiten als wesentlich und konstitutiv herausgewahlt werden, damit an-
dere als unwesentlich, zufalIig, sekundar oder konsekutiv davon abge-
schieden werden k6nnen. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
7 
Wofiir wesentlich - muB ich fragen - sollen diese Priidikabilien sein? 
W ofiir? Irgendetwas muB doch sozusagen diktieren, was dieses Grond-
legende und dieses Konsekutive ist. Nun, ich kann das nur in dem Sinne 
verstehen, daB Beides zu dem Wesen ziihlt, und sagen: Das Was, das ist 
das dirigierende Moment. Dieses Was bestimmt, welche andere, nicht 
das Was bildende Bestimmtheiten da hinzugehoren, so daB eine be-
stimmte innere Kohiirenz, eine innere gegenseitigeAbhangigkeit zwischen 
dem Was - dem ti - und einem Teil von poion - einem Teil von der Mit-
bestimmtheit - bestehen miiBte. Da muB es irgendwelche strenge Ab-
hangigkeiten geben, es muB etwas von dem anderen abhangen, es muB 
etwas in Bezug auf das andere unselbstandig sein, dam it es selbst exis-
tieren kann. 
Andererseits kann oder auch muB Verschiedenes aus dem betreffenden 
Gegenstand ausgeschlossen werden, denn sonst wiirde er sozusagen 'ex-
plodieren', wie HusserI sagte. Ein Tisch kann keine soIche Bestimmt-
heiten haben, wie sie z.B. fUr eine junge Dame charakteristisch sind, 
sondem er muB andere charakteristische Bestimmtheiten besitzen. Ein 
Tisch muB z.B. flach sein, sonst wiirde er nicht als Tisch dienen konnen. 
HusserI schreibt vor: Ein Tisch kann rond oder rechteckig sein, er 
kann aus Holz oder aus Stein sein usw., aber er muB doch eine ganz be-
stimmte Form haben: Der obere Teil muB flach sein und er muB im 
Raum horizontal stehen, denn sonst wiirde er nicht als Tisch dienen 
konnen. Also da beginnt eine Segregation sich zu vollziehen aus der 
ganzen Menge aller Bestimmtheiten, - eine Wahl dieser Bestimmtheiten, 
die in engerem Zusammenhang mit der 'Tischheit' stehen, und der an-
deren, die wandelbar sind, d.h. es kann sowohl Tisch sein, wenn er recht-
eckig ist, als auch dann, wenn er rond ist, als auch dann, wenn er ellip-
tisch ist usw. Es kann sowohl Tisch sein, wenn er aus Holz ist, als dann, 
wenn er aus Stein ist usw. Es gibt die mit dem ti zusammenhangenden 
konstanten Bestimmtheiten, - und es gibt andere Bestimmtheiten, die 
freilich im Einzelfall da sind, aber es ist Zufall, daB sie auch da sind, 
nicht wahr, sie miissen nicht da sein, sie sind eben variabel, sie konnen 
Verschiedenes sein. 
la, dann gibt es noch Fragen. Es ist tatsachlich so, daB dieser Tisch 
da aus Holz und rechteckig ist, - und weil er aus Holz ist, macht er diesen 
Radau, wenn ich darauf klopfe. Wenn er aus Gold oder Silber ware, 
wiirde das ganz anders klingen usw. Dieser Klang ist auch seine Be-
stimmtheit. - Es ist eine Tatsache, daB dieser Tisch gerade so ist, indem 

8 
ROMANINGARDEN 
er, dieser individuelle Tisch, da ist. Und da muB gefragt werden: Warum 
ist er gerade so? Warum sind alle diese variablen Momente da, aus denen 
dieser Fall nun realisiert worden ist? Nun, da ist die Antwort: Er ist 
deswegen so rechteckig usw., weil ihnjemand so gemacht hat, nicht wahr. 
Ursachen, Kombinationen von Ursachen, haben es ermoglicht, daB 
dieses Individuum in dieser Mannigfaltigkeit von Bestimmtheiten exis-
tiert. 
Wie solI es aber einem einfallen - wenn man mit diesem Tisch zu tun 
hat - daB die Tischheit konstitutiv ist, und daB sie dieses Flachsein, diese 
horizontale Stellung usw. vorschreibt, und daB die anderen Bestimmt-
heiten eben variabel sind? Nun, da sagt Husserl nach dieser ganzen 
Analyse, die bei ihm nieht steht, aber die er kennt: Ja, es gibt doch die 
Operation der 'Variation'. Ich halte die Tischheit fest, - und jetzt gibt 
es eine Operation, die ich in der Imagination ausfiihren kann - ich 
brauche mich nicht auf die Erfahrung zu stiitzen - namlich: Diese recht-
eckige Gestalt kann ausgewechselt werden, in eine mnde Gestalt, in eine 
elliptische usw., wie Sie wollen, - es wird noch immer Tisch sein. Wenn 
ich aber aus dieser flachen Oberflache Berge mache, dann wird er auf-
horen, Tisch zu sein, nieht wahr, - es wiirde eine Rekonstruktion yom 
Matterhorn sein. Also das sind diese Operationen der Variation und der 
Erfassung dessen, was konstant sein muB, wenn das betreffende Indivi-
duum, das betreffende Ding, Tisch usw., ist, dieses ti hat. 
Aber da kommt noch etwas hinzu. Dieses individuelle Ding existiert 
real und wandelt sieh. Es gab einen Moment, wo es aus verschiedenen 
Stiicken zusammengesetzt wurde, z.B. dieser Tisch: un ten ist Eisen, oben 
ist Holz, und es ist Tisch geworden und bleibt das stets. Es gibt zwar 
verschiedene Wandlungen in diesem Realen: Wenn es warmer wird, 
wird er etwas breiter, und wenn es kalter wird, zieht er sich zusammen. 
Wenn er alt wird, wird er nicht mehr so schon hell sein, sondern er wird 
schmutzig sein. Der Gegenstand wandelt sieh auf verschiedene Weise. 
Aber trotz dieser Wandlung in seiner Geschichte bleibt er doch dasselbe 
Ding, und zwar derselbe Tisch. Wie muB also dieses ti sein, das diese 
wesentlichen Pradikabilien vorschreibt? Ja, es muB so sein, daB es sich 
in den Wandlungen der Geschichte des betreffenden Dinges als identisch 
erhalt. Es muB so sein, wie es einst war. Wer spricht wiederum hier? Da 
spricht eben Aristoteles: Das to ti en einai - das ist das, was das Wesen 
yom Individuum konstituiert, nieht wahr ? 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION

Warum erzahle ich das so breit? Weil ich glaube, daB das, was in den 
Ideen iiber die sogenannte eidetische Reduktion gesagt wird, nicht aus-
reichend ist. HusserI sagt: Man muB auf die Individualitat verzichten. 
(Es ist eine besondere Schwierigkeit, was Individualitat heiBt, - aber das 
kann ich schon beiseite legen !). Und ich muB auf die Tatsachlichkeit 
verzichten. Ich muB auf die Seinssetzung als wirklich existierend ver-
zichten, - da ist diese Transformation, also das ist diese eidetische Re-
duktion. Es wird auf die Individualitat und auf die Tatsiichlichkeit ver-
zichtet. Aber dies ist noch viel zu wenig, ich kann dadurch noch nicht 
zu dem Wesen des Individuellen kommen. Denn ich muB noch dieses 
Was herausfinden, und ich muB mit Hilfe neuer Operationen, z.B. mit. 
Hilfe jener Variationsoperation, zu diesem Was die konstanten Mo-
mente entdecken, die da sein miissen, und die anderen, die da sein kon-
nen, - die muB ich aus dem Ganzen herauslesen. Also man muG sehr 
weit iiber das hinausgehen, was in den Ideen 'eidetische Reduktion' 
heiBt. 
NatiirIich, konnen wir sie noch auf doppelte Weise behandeln. Wenn 
wir ein individuelles Ding haben, dann ist sein We sen ebenso individuell, 
wie das Ding selbst, - das ist das, was HusserI in den Ideen 'Wesen in 
der Konkretion' nennt. Wenn ich feststellen solI, wie dieses individuelle 
Ding sein individuelles Wesen hat, so stehe ich vor der schwierigsten 
Aufgabe, die es iiberhaupt gibt, - wie ich da aus dem Ganzen dieses Was 
herausfinden solI. Warum kann es nicht, sagen wir, 'holzemes Ding' sein, 
das Was von diesem Gegenstand? Oder warum kann es nicht 'Eigentum 
der Universitat von Oslo' sein? Warum gerade Tisch? 
Dagegen, wenn ich schon diese Washeit habe, da kann ich schon 
versuchen, mit Hilfe der Variationsoperation und 'Konstantenopera-
tion', diese dazugehorigen komplementaren Momente in der Intuition 
herauszufinden, - das kann ich schon versuchen, mehr oder weniger auf 
die Gefahr hin, daB ich irren konnte - es besteht doch die Moglichkeit, 
daB es mir gelingen wird, diese zu finden. 
Aber"da bin ich schon iiber das Individuelle hinaus, da bin ich schon 
zu dem Punkt gekommen, woriiber HusserI sagt: Jedes Individuelle hat 
ein Eidos, das an sich, generell, zu erschauen oder erfassen ist. Ja, da 
bin ich nicht mehr bei dem Wesen in der Konkretion dieses Dinges da, 
sondem cia bin ich schon bei dem 'rein en' Eidos. Da befinde ich mich 
schon in einer ganz anderen Welt, nicht in der Welt der Individualitaten,

ROMAN INGAR DEN 
sondern in einer ganz anderen Welt, - die man platoniseh oder nieht-
platoniseh nennt, das ist ganz ega!. Da gibt es jetzt die 'Tisehheit tiber-
haupt', - nieht diese Tisehheit des individuellen Dinges, sondern Tiseh-
he it tiberhaupt. Und ob es eine Tisehheit gibt, die Tisehheit dieses Tisehes 
da, und bloB dessen Tisehheit, das ist eine groBe Frage. Existiert so etwas 
iiberhaupt? Wie Sie wissen, war das eine Frage, urn die man im Mittel-
alter sehr kiimpfte. Denn Duns Scott sagte: la, es gibt so etwas wie die 
ganz einmalige Wasbestimmtheit, ganz einmalige, nieht wiederholbare. 
Es konnte nieht ein anderes gerade dies sein; das Beispiel war 'Socratitas', 
das heiBt dieses ti einer bestimmten Person. la, da kann man schon 
eventuell Duns Scott zustimmen und sagen: Vielleieht gibt es so etwas 
wie Soeratitas, wie das, was Goethe konstituiert als Goethe, niimlieh den 
groBen Dichter Goethe, nieht seinen Sohn. Das ist das ganz Einmalige 
- haeccaeitas - gegeniiber welchem die versehiedenen Washeiten gestellt 
werden, die gerade generell sind, so wie Tisehheit, wie Rote usw. Das 
kann ieh aueh hier im Rahmen der Konkretionen sozusagen nieht her-
ausfinden, ieh muB es an sieh erfassen, ieh muB von dem Individuellen 
ganz abgehen, - ob es moglieh ist (vielleieht ist es nieht moglieh) das 
ist eine andere Frage. ledenfalls kann ieh dabei nieht bleiben, ieh muB 
mieh erst in einer anderen Welt befinden und besondere analytisehe an-
sehauliehe Operationen durehfiihren. 
Sprieht man z.B. tiber das BewuBtsein, so solI man doeh nieht tiber 
das BewuBtsein des Erlebnisses, das ieh gerade jetzt habe, spreehen, also 
nieht tiber das Wesen meines Erlebens in diesem Augenbliek, in diesem 
Fall, denn ob ieh darin diese haecceitas finden konnte, das ist eine sehr 
groBe Frage, aber ieh kann es doeh als BewuBtseinserlebnis iiberhaupt 
verfassen. Wenn ieh z.B. denke und wenn ieh dies oder jenes beobaehte 
und erfasse, so kann ieh an diesem als Beispiel ein Generelles irgendwie 
ersehauen, nieht wahr, das ist durehaus moglieh. Ieh glaube also, wenn 
man propagiert, - und das ist doeh bei Husserl natiirlieh ein Programm, 
das zu erfiillen ist! - daB man eine Wissensehaft yom BewuBtsein be-
treiben solI, die eine Wesenswissensehaft, eine 'eidetisehe' Wissensehaft 
ist, so wiirde ieh sagen: Nun, es ist schon, es ist vielleieht moglieh, dies 
zu tun, jedoeh nur in der Einstellung auf das Generelle, nieht wahr, auf 
das BewuBtsein iiberhaupt, die Wahrnehmung iiberhaupt. Und das 
maeht eben Husserl, das will er haben, das stellt er der Psyehologie 
gegeniiber, denn in der Psyehologie heiBt es: Herr X hat diese und jene 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
11 
sozusagen kausalen Eingriffe erlebt, und bei ihm ist dies und jenes pas-
siert, - einmal gerade dieses, ein anderes Mal wird es anders sein, nicht 
wahr. 
Wenn Sie mich nun personlich fragen: Glauben Sie an die Moglichkeit 
und an die Idee einer Phanomenologie als einer eidetischen Wissenschaft 
iiber das BewuBtsein? - so wiirde ich sagen: Ja, ich glaube, daB es als 
Programm moglich ist. Es ist sehr schwierig zu realisieren, aber trotzdem 
verstehe ich die ganze Operation, die mich dazu fiihrt, das zu analysieren 
und zu erschauen und die vorhandenen Abhangigkeiten von den ent-
deckten Momenten herauszustellen. Das wiirde ich glauben, - das kann 
ich verstehen, - daB es eine verniinftige, aber sehr schwierige, sehr Ge-
fahren ausgesetzte Arbeit ist. 
Undjetzt kommt die zweite Frage: das ist die transzendentale Reduk-
tion. Wiederum miissen wir mit der (wie Husserl es nennt) Welt der 
natiirlichen Einstellung oder mit der natiirlichen Welt anfangen, - mit 
dieser Welt, in der wir uns aIle befinden, d.h. Menschen, Tiere, physische 
Dinge, Vorgange usw. Husserl sagt: Ich als Person bin ein Teil, ein Ele-
ment eines Ganzen, das ich vOrlaufig Welt nenne. Ich gehore zu dieser 
Welt, ich bin von dieser Welt abhiingig. Wenn da solche oder andere 
Storungen sind, so konnte ich sofort verbrannt werden, das hangt 
lediglich von der Temperatur ab, nicht wahr. Und diese Welt - Husserl 
sagt relativ sehr wenig dariiber - zieht sich ins Unendliche im Raum und 
ins Unendliche in der Zeit, in die Vergangenheit und die Zukunft, und 
dann in den dreidimensionalen Raum - euklidisch oder nicht-euklidisch, 
das ist ganz egal - aber immer we iter. Dabei war ffir Husserl die Welt 
noch vie! kleiner als sie fiir uns jetzt ist, und zwar weil damals diese 
bewunderswerte Astronomie noch nicht existierte, noch nicht entdeckt 
war, diese ganz wahnsinnigen Entfernungen im Raum, die wir zur Zeit 
kennen. Husserl sagt: Nun, diese Welt, in der ich mich befinde, existiert 
fUr mich standig, ob ich es will oder nicht will, ob ich gerade auf passe 
oder nicht aufpasse. Wenn ich z.B. tief schlafe, kann ich nicht wissen, 
was los ist; wenn ich aber aufwache, ist die Welt schon da, - sie ist da 
als vorhandene noch bevor ich aufgewacht bin, nicht wahr. Sie ist immer 
da, wenn ich einschlafe, - und bleibt da, wenn ich schlafe, - ich wache 
auf in derselben Welt, wie gestern. 
Wenn ich mich frage: Gibt es so etwas phanomenal wie diese standige 
Selbstgegenwart einer realen Welt, einer realen Mannigfaltigkeit von 

12 
ROMANINGARDEN 
zusammenhangenden Dingen und Prozessen? - dann muBte ich sagen: 
Nun, ja, es ist so - ob ich es will oder nicht will, die Welt ist fUr mich 
da - und zwar liegt der Nachdruck nicht auf 'fiir mich', sondem auf 
dem'da'. 
Was sagt Hussed dann weiter? Es gibt eine Thesis jeder einzelnen 
Wahmehmung eines einzelnen Dinges. Wenn ich z.B. dieses Stuck Papier 
sehe und es betrachte und sage: ja, es ist auf der einen Seite beschrieben 
und auf der anderen Seite ganz weiB, - dann ist diese Operation des 
Wahmehmens, des Sehens so, daB sie am Korrelat mir den Charakter 
der Realitat irgendwie zeigt, der phanomenal ist, ein Phanomen, und 
subjektiv - ein so vollzogener Akt, daB ich - wenn man so sagen darf -
ganz sicher bin, daB dies da existiert. Das heiBt nicht, daB ich lange Zeit 
eine Uberzeugung davon habe, die sozusagen mir innedich gegenwartig 
ist, die in mir phanomenal da ist, sondem das Sichersein ist eben dieses 
von mir jetzt Erlebte. Wenn ich weiter feststelle: 'Es ist doch!' - dann 
vollzieht sich in diesem 'es ist doch' ein besonderer Akt der Zustimmung 
oder der Erfassung, der Feststellung, der Anerkennung - wie einst Bren-
tano sagte - der Existenz des sen da. Also in diesem Sinne ist dieser Akt 
- Hussed wiirde sagen - 'thetisch', - es ist eine Thesis in diesem Akt ent-
halten. Wenn nun fiir mich die ganze Welt, so wie auch dieses Stuck 
Papier, ist, ja da muBte ich sagen: Es gibt eine Generalthesis in mir, die 
sich auf die ganze Welt bezieht, nicht wahr, - und zwar ist diese Thesis 
nicht so, wie dieser Akt der Erfassung des Stucks Papier; - das hat be-
gonnen, hat gedauert - sl!-gen wir - so und so viel Sigmas, und ist ver-
schwunden, - diese Generalthesis ist aber bestandig. 
Bei dieser Generalthesis, die in meinem ganzen Leben bestandig sein 
solI, setzt nun die Operation der Reduktion ein. Es muB in der Thesis 
etwas passieren, etwas geandert werden oder nicht geandert werden. 
Wenn ich mich frage, was das ist, so muB ich personlich zunachst sagen: 
Ich weill es nicht. Ich kann zustimmen: Es gibt so etwas wie diesen the-
tischen Charakter meiner Wahmehmung, thetischen Charakter meines 
SchlieBens, z.B. von A schlieBe ich auf dies und dies. Vollziehe ichjedoch 
silindig einen solchen Akt, der nicht vergeht und mir irgendwie silindig 
gegenwartig ist? Kann ich es phanomenal aufzeigen, daB es wirklich 
so ist? Da weill ich nicht, wo ich das suchen solI. Ich leugne nicht, daB 
die Welt, in der ich lebe, diesen standigen Charakter der Realitat hat, 
des autonomen Seins, mit dem ich von Angesicht zu Angesicht verkehre. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTlON 
l3 
Aber solI ich da in meinem BewuBtsein, in meinem BewuBtseinsstrom 
so einen sich hinziehenden Akt der Annahme finden ? Das kann ich nicht. 
Es ist schwierig fiir mich, zu diesem gegenstandlichen Charakter der 
Realitat der ganzen Welt, in meinem BewuBtsein einen sozusagen stan-
digen AnnahmeprozeB zu finden. Ich gebe zu, es kann Momente geben, 
wo ich ausdrticklich den Akt der Feststellung vollziehe: Ja, die Welt ist 
doch da. Warum? Aus diesen oder anderen Grunden. Solche Akte 
kenne ich. Ich kann doch manchmal so etwas erleben wie Descartes 
unter der Einwirkung des basen Geistes, daB ich doch im Zweifel bin: 
Gibt es diese Welt, oder ist sie nur eine Illusion, eine konsequente Illu-
sion ? Nun, dann kann ich das irgendwie lasen: Nein, nein, das ist keine 
Illusion, sie - die Welt - ist doch da! Das verstehe ich, es gibt solche 
Phanomene - richtig oder nicht richtig, begrtindet oder nicht begrundet 
- es gibt solche Phanomene. 
SolI man das also so sagen, wie es im Texte bei Husser! steht? Er sagt: 
Es ist eine potentielle Thesis, die sich in eine aktuelle Thesis verwandeln 
darf, wenn ich gerade solche Geschichten wie mit dem basen Geist und 
dem Zweifel erlebe. 1st es eine potientielIe Thesis, und ist dies der Grund, 
weshalb ieh sie nicht in der Aktualitat finden kann? Husserl sagt dann, 
eine potentielle Thesis kann eben so behandelt werden wie die aktuelle 
Thesis. - Was 'potentielle Thesis' ist, weiB ich eigentlich nicht. Doch 
will ich nun nicht eine ziemlich schwierige Geschichte tiber die Maglich-
keit, tiber die Potentialitat entwickeln, urn zu verstehen, worum es sich 
eigentlich handelt. 
Aueh will ich nicht sagen, daB diese aktuelle Generalthesis bei Husserl 
eine schane Dichtung ist. Ich machte sagen, es ist sehr schwierig, das 
irgendwie zu fassen, zu entdecken, obwohl es vielleicht Wege gibt. Die 
standige Anwesenheit der Generalthesis erscheint uns so normal, daB 
wir es tiberhaupt nicht fassen, daB es so etwas gibt, nieht wahr? 
Sie kennen vielleicht den Namen eines sehr bedeutenden Psychiaters 
und Philosophen in Frankreich, Pierre Janet. Er hat insbesondere die 
sogenannte 'Psychasthenie' studiert, das ist eine Krankheit. Er spricht 
nicht von der Generalthesis, sondem er spricht yom 'sens de realite', 
also von einem gewissen Sinn der Realitat. Psychasthenie ist fUr ibn eine 
Transformation dieses Sinnes der Realitat, Sinnes fiir die Realitat, - das 
ist diese Krankheit, die bei einem Menschen, der daran leidet, bewirkt, 
daB fUr ihn die ganze Welt auf einmal gar nicht real ist. Die Welt spricht 

14 
ROMANINGARDEN 
ibn gar nicht als real an, - er hat den Sinn daffir verloren, diese Realitat 
zu fassen. Alles ist irgendwie Phantasmagorie, irgendwie keine Realitat 
an sich, sondern nur eine Phantasie. Ja, ich habe das nie in meinem Leben 
erlebt, war nie psychasthenisch und weill nicht, wie das in concreto aus-
sieht. Ich nehme an, daB Janet es auch nicht weiB, - das weill nur ein 
Kranker. Aber die Beschreibung - es gibt ein ganzes Buch dariiber, -
die Beschreibungen, die er da gibt, sind sehr iiberzeugend; sie sind so, 
daB man glaubt: Nun, es gibt vielleicht so etwas, so ein ganz merkwiir-
diges SichfUhlen in der Welt, daB die Welt den Charakter der Autonomie 
verloren hat; wir sind dann entsetzlich ungliicklich, wir haben gar keine 
Realitat mehr. - Vnd wenn wir sie haben, so wissen wir nicht, daB wir 
sie haben. Das, was sich bei uns wandelt von psychasthenischer Ein-
stellung zu normaler Einstellung, - das ist eben dies, was wir jetzt ge-
winnen, das ist eben diese Generalthesis. Das ist so etwas Selbstverstand-
liches, so alltaglich und so natiirlich, daB wir nicht wissen, daB wir das 
iiberhaupt haben. Erst in dem Moment wissen wir es, wo es verdorben 
wird. 
Einst hat unser Dichter Mickiewicz iiber das Vaterland gesagt, daB das 
Vaterland so etwas wie die Gesundheit ist: Man weiB, was es ist, wenn 
man es verloren hat. Vielleicht ist es mit dem Sinn ffir die Realitat ebenso, 
- man entdeckt erst dann, was das ist, wenn er ins Schwanken gekommen 
ist. Es ist nicht Potentialitat. Was das positiv ist, wie man das finden solI, 
das bleibt fUr mich das Problem. Doch bin ich nicht skeptisch in dem 
Sinne, daB ich sage: Es gibt keine Generalthesis. Es ist aber etwas ganz 
anderes als dieser Akt, in dem eine Realitatserfassung vollzogen wird, 
in dem Etwas aus der Welt herausgefaBt und festgestellt wird, was es ist. 
So miissen wir - sagt Husserl, - wenn wir nun in die transzendentale 
Phanomenologie kommen wollen, versuchen, gerade an diesem Punkte, 
der so unklar ist und doch irgendwie iiberzeugend, eine Wandlung durch-
zufUhren, eine Wandlung, die uns, wie Husserl sagt, das Gebiet einer 
ganz neuen Forschung eroffnet. Diese Wandlung ist eben die transzen-
dentale phanomenologische E1t0l" oder Reduktion. Vnd jetzt ist es sehr 
schwierig zu sagen, was diese Reduktion eigentlich ist. Husserl bedient 
sich da zunachst eines Vergleiches mit einer aus der Geschichte bekann-
ten Sache, - das ist der Zweifelversuch von Descartes, die 1. und 2. Me-
ditation von Descartes. Husserl sagt: Ja, ich werde mich dessen bedienen, 
urn Ihnen Zugang zu verschaffen, zu dem, was gemacht wird oder ge-

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
15 
macht werden muB, damit ich von der Generalthesis der natiirIichen 
Welt zu der phanomenologischen Einstellung und zum reinen BewuBt-
sein kommen kann. Bei Descartes war das ganz anders; er wollte einen 
Generalzweifel zu einem bestimmten Zweck durchfUhren, namlich um 
das absolut Sichere, das Gebiet des absolut Sicheren, Unbezweifelbaren 
zu finden. Das war, wie Sie alle wissen, das Cogito; der ganze Rest des 
Seins, verschieden vom Cogito - das war gerade bezweifelbar, ob es exis-
tiert oder nicht existiert. Da gibt es einen langen Weg, bevor Descartes 
es beweist, daB dieser Rest doch existiert, mit Hilfe Gottes usw. 
HusserI sagt dagegen: Mein Ziel ist nicht dieses, ich will nicht so ein 
Gebiet des absolut Sicheren, des absolut Unbezweifelbaren finden. Aber 
- und darauf werde ich noch spater zuriickkommen - ich zweifle, ob es 
wirklich so ist, daB dieses Problem des absolut unbezweifelbaren Seins 
fUr HusserI ohne Bedeutung ist. Er sucht gewiB ein Gebiet von indivi-
duellen Tatsachen zu finden, das uns friiher angeblich ohne diese Re-
duktion nicht zuganglich war, - das ist wahr. HierfUr konnte es zwei 
Motive geben - entweder: er mochte doch die Wirklichkeit des Geistes 
sehen, erfassen, - oder: er mochte auBerdem das Gebiet des Geistes als 
des letzt Unbezweifelbaren haben. Forschen wir nach, was unter die 
Klausel der Reduktion fallt als das Reduzierte, das Nicht-Absolute, 
dann fUhlen wir, es lauft doch darauf hinaus, daB das Bezweifelbare 
'reduziert' wird und das Unbezweifelbare als Residuum iibrigbleibt, 
namlich das reine BewuBtsein. 
Wie verhalt es sich aber mit diesem Zweifelversuch, mit dem HusserI 
operiert - als Versuch, zu dieser transzendentalen Reduktion Zugang zu 
finden? - J a, da sagt HusserI: Das ist so: Ich bin freilich davon iiber-
zeugt, daB die Welt da ist, aber ich werde an dieser Uberzeugung von 
nun an nicht festhalten. Diese Uberzeugung, daB die Welt da ist, setze 
ich 'auBer Aktion', ich 'klammere sie ein', und in der Klammer bleibt 
nunmehr die Welt mit dem Wirklichkeitscharakter. Dies ist eben jene 
£7tOXr, ! 
Eine Reihe von solchen Bildem werden benutzt: 'Einklammerung', 
'auBer Aktion setzen' usw. Alles, was da gesagt wird, ist metaphorisch. 
Dies kommt nicht nur in den Ideen vor, sondem auch in anderen Schrif-
ten von HusserI, spateren und friiheren, bis zum SchluB, bis zu der 
Krisis, wie sie zur Zeit vorIiegt (zu Lebzeiten HusserIs ist nur der erste 
Teil der Krisis erschienen). Die Frage nach dem, was diese Reduktion 

16 
ROMANINGARDEN 
ist, taucht immer wieder aufund Husser! macht immer wieder neue Ver-
suche, urn sie zu beschreiben, und immer wieder neue Versuche, urn die 
Wichtigkeit dieser Operation hervorzuheben, - im Grunde handeln beide 
Bande der Ersten Philosophie nur davon. 
Handelt es sich jedoch direkt urn die Beschreibung dessen, was da 
passiert, wenn ich diese Reduktion vollziehe, so bekommen wir von 
Husser! nur die Wendung: 'ja, es wird eingeklammert'. Nichts mehr. 
Fiir Husser! war diese Operation von groBer Bedeutung. Wer sie nicht 
nachvollziehen konne, der habe iiberhaupt keinen Zugang zur Philo-
sophie. Das war der Punkt des standigen Zwistes oder der jedenfalls nicht 
sehr guten Beziehungen zwischen Husser! und Miinchen, d.h. pfander 
usw. Husser! sagte immer: Pfander und die anderen da sind doch Psycho-
logen und keine Philosophen, sie haben keine Ahnung von der Philoso-
phie. Erst wenn man diese Einklammerung mitmacht, dann erst sind wir 
auf gemeinsamen Boden, und konnen wir urn Einzelheiten streiten. Ohne 
diesen Schritt, ist es keine Philosophie, - hochstens irgendeine Wissen-
schaft, positive Wissenschaft. Doch ist es nicht diese radikale Umwen-
dung, die gemacht werden muB, wenn uns iiberhaupt philosophische 
Probleme auftauchen sollen. Die Schwierigkeit ist auBerdem die, daB 
diese Einklammerung, dieses AuBer-Aktion-Setzen an die Generalthes,iS 
angekniipft werden solI, wobei gerade jene Schwierigkeiten auftauchen, 
die ich Ihnen eben zu skizzieren versucht habe. 
Man weill jedenfalls, was die Reduktion nicht ist. Es ist kein Zweifel, 
es ist kein Negieren der Existenz der Welt, es ist kein bloBes Sich-Denken, 
daB die Welt existiert oder nicht existiert. Beijedem Zweifel, sagt Husserl, 
hat man den Ansatz des Nicht-Seins, und das machen wir nicht mit, sagt 
er, von diesem Ansatz gehen wir bei der Reduktion nicht aus. Wir 
zweifeln nicht einen Moment daran, daB die Welt existiert, da die Gene-
ralthesis nach der Reduktion unverandert bleibt, - und doch hat sich 
alles verandert. Aber was und woran? An der Thesis sollte sich nichts 
verandem, nicht wahr? Ich habe natiirlich - wenn ich das sagen darf -
viele Versuche gemacht, urn doch zu verstehen, worum es sich fiir Husserl 
handelt. Denn das ist der erste Schritt, daB man 'ja' oder 'nein' sagt. 
Husserl hat doch verstanden, was er will: es ist keine Phantasie, es ist 
keine Dichtung, es ist doch irgendetwas da erforscht, entdeckt. So habe 
ich eine Zeit lang gedacht, es ist vielleicht das, was Husserl spater in den 
Ideen 'Neutralitatsmodifikation' nennt, z.B. wir haben einen Satz, eine 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTlON 
17 
Behauptung, sagen wir, den pythagoraischen Satz aus der Mathematik, 
doch ich habe keinen Beweis. Man hat mich diesen Satz gelehrt und hat 
gesagt: ja, es ist sicher wahr, also sei ruhig, es ist alles in Ordnung. Doch 
mochte ich mir das selbst ansehen, urn zu wissen: ist das richtig, oder 
ist das nicht richtig? Dann wiirde ich nicht mehr zweifeln, daB es wahr 
ist. Jetzt aber ziehe ich mich von der aktiven Annahme, daB es richtig 
ist, daB dieser Satz gilt, zuriick, 'neutralisiere' diesen Charakter des Wahr-
seins und diesen Charakter des Annehmens. So bekomme ich Satze, die 
keine Behauptungsfunktion haben. Sie wissen, wie ein groBer Gegner 
von Husserl, Bertrand Russell, hierzu Stellung genommen hat. Er sagte: 
Da haben wir einen Satz, und das ist noch kein Satz des Systems, noch 
keine Behauptung; wird es erst durch dieses Assertionszeichen f- vor 
den Satz nicht wahr, f-p, das ist schon Behauptung. Ohne dieses Zeichen 
sind es reine Satze - in philosophischem Sinne - es sind keine Thesen. 
Man kann also diese Behauptungsfunktion irgendwie neutralisieren. -
Pfander sagt, es gibt zwei Funktionen des 'ist': einerseits die Priidikats-
funktion 'A ist B', und andererseits die Behauptungsfunktion '! A ist B' 
- das Ganze also. Diese zweite Funktion, diese Behauptungsfunktion, 
kann man neutralisieren, und dann bekommt man 'Annahmen' in 
Meinongschem Sinne, reine Satze, Aussagesatze. - 1st es vielleicht so mit 
der phanomenologischen Reduktion, daB sie eine Neutralisierung der 
Generalthesis ist? Wenn das der Fall ware, wiirde es bedeuten, daB die 
transzendentale Reduktion die Generalthesis anderte, und Husserl 
konnte dann nicht sagen, es bleibt alles so wie es war, es wird nichts ge-
andert, es wird nichts modifiziert. Und es darf auch nichts modifiziert 
werden, denn diese Reduktion gibt mir doch erst den Zugang dazu, daB 
ich verstehen kann, was die Generalthesis ist: Sie ist doch eine Operation 
oder irgendwie eine Verhaltensweise des reinen Ich im reinen BewuBt-
sein. Bevor ich das entdeckt habe, kann ich nicht wissen, was das eigent-
lich ist. - Also es soIl alles dasselbe bleiben, und es solI auch das Korrelat 
desselben bleiben - das ist der Seinscharakter, Realitatscharakter der 
Welt, der phanomenale Charakter. Somit ist die Reduktion - in Husserl-
schem Sinne - keine Neutralitatsmodifikation. 
Ja, und nun wird es schwierig weiterzugehen. Ich glaube, man muB 
versuchen, das zu verstehen. Sicherlich ist es moglich, manche Schritte 
weiterzugehen als Husserl selbst getan hat. Vielleicht meinen Sie, daB 
meine Darlegung in gewissem Sinne auch metaphorisch ist, daB es nicht 

18 
ROMANINGARDEN 
direkt und streng erfasst ist, was ich Ihnen nun sagen mochte. Ich werde 
zunachst versuchen zu erzahlen, wie es eigentlich ist, wenn ich einen, 
sagen wir, Behauptungssatz schlicht als Behauptung aufsteIle. Ich nehme 
ausdriicklich eine effektive Thesis: Ich behaupte, daB z.B. auf diesem 
Tische dieses Ding da liegt. Ich behaupte, daB der groBe Fermatsche 
Satz richtig ist, es liegt bloB kein Beweis vor. In Situationen, die sehr 
gefahrlich sind, werden uns Fragen gesteIlt: Warst du damals an der 
Stelle? Hast du den Menschen gesehen, was hat er da getan? Der Betref-
fende steht als der Beklagte vor Gericht. Und ich muB bezeugen: Ja, ich 
habe es gesehen; er hat das und das getan. Da ist ein schlichter Vollzug in 
vollem Ernst: Es ist so! Was bedeutet dies? Ich vollziehe einen Akt, einen 
U rteilsakt. Ais Erstes, - und das wird vieIleicht wiederum eine Metapher 
fiir Sie - dieser Akt, den ich da voIlziehe, ist sozusagen zentral in meinem 
Ich verankert, aus dem Zentrum meines Selbst quillt es heraus. Und nicht 
nur, daB es aus meinem Zentrum heraus vollzogen wird, sondern mein 
Zentrum - das heiBt Ich - wird dabei personlich engagiert, es tut es selbst. 
Ais Niichstes: Wenn dies Urteil so personlich, ernst, schlicht vollzogen 
wird, so bedeutet das nicht nur, daB ich engagiert bin, daB ich es tue und 
daB es zentral aus mir herauswachst, - es bedeutet mehr. Ich bin engagiert, 
das heiBt, ich stehe dafiir ein: Es ist so! Ich stehe dafUr ein, das heiBt, 
mit mir faIlt und steht die ganze Sache; ich bin bereit, mich einzusetzen 
fUr das, was ich so voIlzogen habe. Ich ziehe mich auf gar keine Weise 
davon zuriick, ich distanziere mich nicht davon. Ich sage nicht: Ja, ich 
habe es gesehen, aber ich bin ganz unschuldig bei der ganzen Geschichte; 
ich weiB nicht, ob es so war, oder nicht so war. Nein, nein, ich weiB es: 
und ich behaupte dies. 
Wie ist es nun, wenn ich mir sage: 0 ja, ich weiB, der groBe Fermatsche 
Satz ist doch wahr. Sie wissen, Fermat schrieb eine Behauptung an den 
Rand eines Buches und sagte: 'Nun, den Beweis habe ich nicht geschrie-
ben, weil kein Platz da ist'. Und 200--300 Jahre lang haben die Mathe-
matiker das beweisen wollen; sie glaubten aIle, daB es richtig ist. Den 
Beweis gibt es nicht. Wenn ich mir das nun ansehe und sage: Ich weiB, 
daB es wahr ist, ich bin davon iiberzeugt, aber ich mochte doch den 
Beweis finden, - so distanziere ich mich zunachst von dem Akte, den ich 
vollziehe. Er hat das Zentrum meines Ich irgendwie verlassen, oder ich 
habe mich irn Vergleich zu ihm zUrUckgezogen, ich bin schon irgendwo 
anders mit meinem Zentrum, - obwohl ich noch behaupte, aber dieses 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
19 
Behaupten ist nicht so, daB ich dafiir einstehe, daB ich engagiert bin. lch 
habe mich von diesem Behaupten ein wenig zuriickgezogen. Nun kann 
leicht gesagt werden - und Husserl benutzt leider auch diese Wendung, 
von der ich glaube, daB sie nicht zutreffend ist -: Es vollzieht sich eine 
Spaltung im lnnem, namlich das lch, das behauptet, also die General-
thesis vollzieht, und das leh, das diese Einklammerung macht; das lch 
ist also in gewissem Sinne gespalten. Der Bine ist der V ollziehende, 
und der Andere ist der sich yom Vollzug irgendwie Zuriickhaltende, 
Zuriickziehende, seine Biirgschaft Verleugnende - Biirgschaft fUr die 
Echtheit des Urteils. leh glaube nicht, daB aIle Phanomenologen ge-
spalten sind, wenn sie diesen Akt innerlich vollziehen, daB es Einen gibt, 
der erlebt, und einen Anderen, der zuschaut, daB sie zwei Verschiedene 
sind, so daB die Einheit des leh verloren geht, - das glaube ich nicht. -
Nach meiner Auffassung ist die Einheitlichkeit des Ich erhalten geblie-
ben, aber das lch ist irgendwie nicht so kondensiert, so vereinfacht zu 
einem Akt; es ist fahig, zwei verschiedene Funktionen auszuiiben: das 
Vollziehen der Generalthesis und zugleich als zweiten Akt die gewisse 
Reservierung, eine Reserve, die man zu der ersten Thesis einnimmt, so 
daB Beides moglich ist. Dadurch hat das Ich irgendwie an Dimension 
gewonnen, es ist nicht diese letzte Spitze, sozusagen, des Ich, aus dem 
alles herausquillt. Mit einem neuen Wort mochte ich den Vorgang so 
umschreiben: leh solidarisiere mich nicht in der gleichen Weise mit der 
Generalthesis, wie ich mich solidarisiere, wenn ich sie schlicht vollziehe. 
Denn dabei gibt es noch nicht die beiden leh. Also, wenn das leh sich 
mit etwas solidarisiert, - das ist Thesis. Es vollzieht zentral die Thesis, 
ist vollig eins mit ihr, es braucht da keinen Akt der besonderen Solidari-
sierung. Man kann sagen, es ist der Fall der hochsten Solidarisierung. 
Sobald ich aber die Reduktion mache, siehe ich mich etwas von dem 
gerade von mir vollzogenen Akt zuriick. Die Solidaritat mit dem leh, 
das die Thesis vollzieht, ist schon nicht mehr vorhanden, - es ist eine 
Distanz da, es ist das Ansehen-wollen. 
la, ich bin sehr wohl davon iiberzeugt, daB das, was ich Ihnen darzu-
stellen versuchte, im Grunde sehr miserabel ist in Bezug auf das, was da 
zu beschreiben, was sich da bietet, urn entdeckt zu werden daB es keines-
wegs adaequat, aber metaphorisch gesagt ist. Aber mich personlich hat 
das doch an das Phanomen naher gebracht, das HusserI doch nicht aus 
der Luft gegriffen hat und das er doch viele lahre zu fassen suchte. In 

20 
ROMANINGARDEN 
diesem Sinne also wiirde ieh sagen, es sei moglieh, so etwas wie transzen-
dentale Reduktion zu vollziehen, - es sei verstandlieh. Ob es zweekvoll 
ist, ob diese Reduktion das leistet, was Husserl von ihr erhofft, und ob 
sie so unentbehrlieh ist, urn das reine BewuBtsein zu entdeeken, wie es 
Husserl glaubt, ja, das ist natiirlieh eine neue Frage. Wenn ieh sage: ieh 
versuehe zu verstehen, so bedeutet das noeh nieht: Es ist riehtig, es mull 
so gemaeht werden. Denn da gibt es groBe Unsieherheiten, was die Ef-
fekte des eehten Vollzugs einer transzendentalen Reduktion bzw. E7tOX,tl 
sind. Sie miissen beaehten, es handelt sieh nieht urn das, woriiber Husserl 
spater sagt: Ich klammere aIle Wissenschaften ein. Es kommt nieht auf 
die Wissenschaft an, noeh darauf wie. ieh mieh zu Wissenschaften ver-
halte. Fortan nehme ieh keinen naturwissensehaftliehen Satz mehr als 
Grund fUr meine Theorie in der Phanomenologie. Das ist leieht. Es 
handelt sieh aber urn eine erste prinzipielle radikale Wendung. Nun 
bin ich also ansehaulieh in dieser Welt da, - da ist der Saal, dann 
Oslo, das Meer, mein Vaterland usw. usw. Angesiehts dieser Welt, 
dieser selbst gegenwartigen Welt, solI ieh jene 'Reduktion' zu vollziehen 
versuehen. Und das solI erst diese Wendung hervorrufen. Ieh weiss nieht, 
ob ieh Husserl riehtig verstehe, aber ieh glaube, ieh miiBte in der Riehtung 
weitergehen, urn herauszufinden, was sieh da eigentlieh abspielt, wenn 
so eine Reduktion vollzogen wird. - Eine andere, eine vollig andere Saehe 
ist es - und da habe ieh schon einen Zweifel- ob sie wirklieh so bedeutend 
ist, wie Husserl meint, ob sie so leistungsfahig ist, wie Husserl meint, ob 
sie fiir die Philosophie so unentbehrlieh ist, wie Husserl meint. 
8. Vorlesung 
3 November 1967 
Meine Darnen und Herren. Ieh moehte Sie zunaehst urn Verzeihung 
bitten, wenn das, was ieh heute sagen moehte oder sagen werde, sehwierig 
oder nieht ganz klar sein wird. Denn die Probleme, urn die es sieh handelt, 
liegen sozusagen in der ganzen philosophisehen Problematik sehr weit, 
sie setzen versehiedene Analysen voraus und da ieh hier die Saehe kurz 
fassen muB, wird manehes noeh einer naheren Erklarung bediirfen, die 
ieh jedoeh momentan nieht geben kann. 
Was ieh heute behandeln moehte, sind im Grunde versehiedene Fragen, 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION

Fragen an Husserl, an den Text von Husserl, mit gewissen Perspektiven 
auf die Konsequenzen der Antworten auf diese Fragen. Es h~ndelt sich 
natiirlich wieder urn die transzendentale Reduktion, welche Husserl fUr 
entscheidend fUr die ganze Philosophie hielt. Er wuBte, daB ich kein 
Freund der Reduktion bin, und er war in unserer Korrespondenz viele 
Jahre sehr traurig, daB ich seine Forderung nach der DurchfUhrung der 
Reduktion nicht mitmachen konnte, wahrend er immer wieder die Be-
deutung der Reduktion betonte. Uber einige Jahre, zwischen 1928 und 
1933, zieht sich der Briefwechsel hin, Briefe von ihm, Antworten von 
mir, und da schreibt er immer ungef"ahr so: "Wenn Sie die transzenden-
tale Reduktion mitmachen, dann erst haben Sie den Weg offen zur 
Philosophie. Solange man das nicht tut, ist man nur an der Tiir der 
Philosophie; das ist noch keine Philosophie". 
Fiir ibn handelte es sich vor aHem in der Diskussion mit mir darum, 
daB ich - darauf werde ich heute auch eingehen - in einem Moment 
sagte: Nun schon, ich verstehe die Problematik, die sich eroffnet, sobald 
man den Weg geht, - nicht nur verstehe, sondem ich glaube (oder glaubte 
damals) iiberzeugt zu sein, daB das wirklich eine sehr wichtige Sache ist, 
die da im Gange ist, zurn Sprunge ansetzt. Aber ich dachte mir zugleich, 
daB diese Problematik, die sich dann eroffnet, wenn man den Weg der 
transzendentalen Betrachtung des reinen BewuBtseins einschlagt, und 
insbesondere wenn man die sogenannten konstitutiven Probleme behan-
delt, auf die ich noch zuriickkommen werde, - daB diese Problematik 
zunachst einer anderen Vorbereitung bedarf, - und zwar aufgrund einer 
Erfahrung, die ich selbst in meinem Leben gemacht habe. Nach meiner 
Doktorpriifung im Jahre 1918, als ich schon mit dem Examen und der 
Dissertation fertig war und selbstandig weiter arbeiten konnte, habe ich 
namlich mehrere Jahre versucht, eine Analyse des BewuBtseins und ins-
besondere der auBeren Wahmehmung durchzufUhren und die konstitu-
tiven Probleme zu behandeln. Mit den konstitutiven Problemen hatte 
ich mich schon mehrere Jahre vorher dank Husserl bekanntgemacht; das 
ganze Jahr 1916 habe ich fastjeden Tag iiber die konstitutiven Probleme 
mit Husser! gesprochen. Daher woHte ich diese Probleme weiter be-
handeln. 
Ich war davon iiberzeugt, daB die idealistisch klingenden Ergebnisse 
Husserls zu schnell erarbeitet worden waren, daB manche Tatbestiinde 
der weiteren Ausarbeitung bediirfen, da immer irgendetwas noch un-

22 
ROMANINGARDEN 
klar blieb. Vnd wenn man es kliirte, wenn man dann die Fragen priiziser 
stellte, so wiirde man doch zu einem ganz anderen Resultat kommen. Es 
waren ungefahr 4-5 Jahre, in denen ich versuchte, die verschiedenen 
Analysen der iiuBeren Wahmehmung durchzufiihren, so ungefahr 
zwischen 1918 und 1922. Ich kam zu der Uberzeugung, daB schon der 
Versuch des Entwurfs einer transzendentalen konstitutiven Problematik 
etwas voraussetzt, niimlich vor allem die Kliirung der gegenstiindlichen 
Struktur dessen, was da konstituiert wird, die Kliirung der formalen 
Struktur der Welt, die Kliirung des Sinnes der Existenz, des Seins, eine 
Ausarbeitung des Sinnes der Kategorien, Kategorien in Kantischem 
Sinne oder, wenn Sie wollen, in Aristotelischem Sinne. 
Ich begann somit formal ontologisch zu arbeiten. Vnd da sagte mir 
Husserl: Das ist eben falsch! - Sie sind Ontologe geworden, aber Sie 
sollten doch die Reduktion vollziehen, sich ins Wasser stiirzen, urn im 
FluB der konstitutiven Probleme die Leistung der Konstitution zu er-
fassen. Da werden Sie entdecken, daB die Ontologie doch ein gesperrter 
Weg ist, daB alles doch schlieBlich reduziert werden muB, dann zeigt es 
sich, daB die ganze ontologische Betrachtung eine verlorene Miihe ist! 
In diesem Sinne hat er mir immer wieder von der Wichtigkeit der trans-
zendentalen Reduktion geschrieben. Nicht nur die Briefe zeugen davon, 
sondem iiberhaupt die Entwicklung seiner Arbeit nach den Ideen I. Schon 
die Ideen II hat er nicht akzeptieren wollen, nachdem sie von Edith Stein 
redigiert worden waren. Dann nahm Landgrebe eine zweite Bearbeitung 
vor, die Husserl aber auch zuriickgewiesen hat: Nein, es ist nicht fertig, es 
ist nicht gut! In mehreren V ortriigen - das fing, so viel ich weiB, mit den 
sogenannten 'Londoner Vortriigen' an, dann kamen die 'Amsterdamer 
Vortriige', dann die 'Pariser Vortriige' - hat er immer wieder aufs neue 
und von Anfang an versucht, den Sinn und die Vnentbehrlichkeit der 
Reduktion aufzuzeigen. Augenscheinlich meinte Husserl, miiBte man 
doch dazu kommen, die Wichtigkeit und die Funktion der transzenden-
talen Reduktion und der transzendentalen Analyse anzuerkennen. Dann 
erst wiirde sich die ganz neue, echte philosophische Problematik eroff-
nen. SchlieBlich waren die Meditations Cartesiennes - auf Grund der 
Pariser Vortriige ausgearbeitet - abgeschlossen, sie wurden iibersetzt. 
Ich schrieb an Husserl, er solIe sie doch auf deutsch publizieren, sie waren 
doch in der Sprache fertig geschrieben. Aber Husser! schrieb nur: Nein, 
nein, das werde ich jetzt nicht publizieren. - Es ist nicht fertig, es ist in 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
23 
diesem Moment fUr das deutsche Publikum nicht publizierbar, es muB 
ganz aufs neue gemacht werden. So hat er seit der Pariser Zeit - das war 
1929 - bis ungefahr 1932-33, also beinahe fUnf Jahre, weiter gearbeitet 
und hat mir immer wieder geschrieben: Jetzt kommt mein Hauptwerk! -
Das ist die neue Bearbeitung der Meditations Cartesiennes, dachte ich. 
Aber sie kam doch nicht zustande. Voriges Jahr war ich in Louvain und 
wollte die Papiere dieser neuen Bearbeitung der Meditations Cartesiennes 
aufspiiren, denn ich war iiberzeugt, es gabe eine soIche. Deswegen war ich 
auch sehr verwundert, daB man im Jahre 1952 die alte Bearbeitung 
publizierte, die HusserI gar nicht publizieren wollte. Es hat sich jedoch 
gezeigt, daB die neue Bearbeitung gar nicht vorhanden war. Ich fand 
eine groBe Menge von Manuskripten, - etwa 50-60, jedes von etwa 20 
Seiten - die aus mehreren Jahren stammten. Jedesmal war die Behand-
lung eines Problems angefangen worden, ohne aber vollendet zu werden. 
Zur Vollendung einer einheitlichen Bearbeitung kam es nicht. 
Irgendwie, aus einem anderen Gesichtswinkel ist im Winter 1928/29 
die Formale und transzendentale Logik entstanden. Urspriinglich war 
dies eine von HusserI gehaltene Vorlesung, die er dann einige Monate 
vor seinem siebzigsten Geburtstag niedergeschrieben hat. Eine gelungene 
Arbeit, - aber nicht das, was er wollte, nicht das, was er von Anfang 
an, von der Prima Philosophia, von der natiirlichen Einstellung - iiber 
die Konstitutionsprobleme zu entwickeln versuchte. Es kam zwar 
die neue Problematik, des konstitutiven Ursprungs der logischen Ge-
bilde, die in einer urn mehrere Jahre alteren Vorlesung zuerst behandelt 
worden war, zu einer konsequenten Entfaltung und Bearbeitung. Die 
vorbereitenden Einzelarbeiten zu einer systematischen Entwicklung der 
transzendentalen konstitutiven Betrachtung von der richtigen Durch-
fUhrung der phanomenologischen Reduktion dauerten bis etwa zum 
Jahre 1934, aber die ersehnte systematische Bearbeitung kam nicht zu-
stande. 
Dann kam schlieBlich die letzte Phase mit der Entstehung der Krisis, 
wovon der erste Teil von etwa 100 Seiten, wie Sie wissen, vor dem Tode 
Husserls erschienen ist. Die Problematik, die da ersteht, hat mit einem 
Briefe Husserls an den 8. Internationalen KongreB in Prag angefangen. 
Er hat mir das selbst geschrieben. Und bei allen Wandlungen ist da auch 
dieselbe Grundidee: Man muB doch endlich auf iiberzeugende Weise 
darlegen: Wenn man die transzendentale Reduktion richtig durchfiihrt, 

24 
ROMANINGARDEN 
erst dann entwickelt sich die ganze Philosophie, und erst dann hat man 
das System der transzendentalen konstitutiven Probleme, und zwar bis 
zum SchluB. - Nun, leider wurde Husserl krank, die Krisis wurde nicht 
volIendet und ist auch zu Lebzeiten Husserls nicht mehr erschienen. 
Aber Vorarbeiten dazu befinden sich in Menge in Louvain. 
Ich mochte mich also mit dieser transzendentalen Reduktion etwas 
beschaftigen. Ich habe schon gefragt, was sie ist. Ob der Versuch, den 
ich da vor einer W oche gemacht habe, gelungen ist, - ob es richtig und 
im Sinne Husserls ist, wie ich die Sache verstehe, das weill ich nicht. Und 
leider kann ich mit ihm nicht mehr sprechen. Aber es ist ein Versuch, 
vielIeicht ist er richtig. Ich mochte meinerseits alIes unternehmen, um die 
Sache richtig zu verstehen, mich dann mit mir selbst auseinandersetzen, 
mit meinen eigenen Fragen, die ich dazu zu stelIen habe. 
Meine erste Frage ist nun diese: Wie kann ich das Problem hier in 
dieser Vorlesung am besten anfassen? SolI ich zunachst iiber die Reduk-
tion, iiber ihre Funktion und iiber ihre Konsequenzen sprechen? Oder 
soIl ich erst dariiber sprechen, was man, als den Standpunkt Husserls 
in den Ideen bezeichnet, den man kurz gesagt, 'transzendentaler Idealis-
mus' nennt? SolI ich die Reduktion entwickeln und dann den Idealis-
mus? Oder solI ich mit dem Idealismus anfangen und dann zu der Re-
duktion zuriickkehren? Wenn Sie die Ideen Ilesen, entdecken Sie nam-
lich, daB die Abschnitte, die man gewohnlich als die den sogenannten 
transzendentalen Idealismus Husserls in dieser Phase beinhaltende be-
trachtet, vor der Durchfiihrung der Reduktion auftreten. Und ferner: 
Die Ergebnisse, die einzelnen Behauptungen, welche in diesen Abschnit-
ten angefiihrt werden, dienen als Argument dafiir, daB die Reduktion 
durchgefiihrt werden karin. Das Wichtigste, aber, was die Durchfiihrung 
der Reduktion ermoglicht, ist im Grunde nichts anderes als die scharfe 
Scheidung zwischen dem reinen BewuBtsein und dessen Wesen einerseits 
und andererseits dem, was da dem BewuBtsein gegeniibersteht und ihm 
transzendent ist, also insbesondere der realen Welt. Man muB also zu-
nachst das Wesen des reinen BewuBtseins erfassen und dann sehen, daB 
dasjenige, was nicht reines BewuBtsein ist, dem reinen BewuBtsein im 
ontischen Sinne transzendent ist. Infolgedessen ist es moglich, die 
Reduktion durchzufiihren und die Sphare des reinen BewuBtseins fiir 
sich als Residuum, als dasjenige zu haben, was bleibt. Und auBerdem 
gibt es auch das Andere, das ist das Transzendente. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
25 
Oder ist es umgekehrt: MuB man zunachst die Reduktion vollziehen, 
damit sie uns erst das reine BewuBtsein enthiille? Solange wir 'natiirlich' 
eingestellt sind, haben wir noch nicht das reine BewuBtsein, sondem nur 
das psychische, das menschliche BewuBtsein. Was ist nun sozusagen die 
HoiInung Husserls, und was bildet den Zweck der transzendentalen Re-
duktion? Es ist eben - sagt Husserl doch selbst ganz genau im Text -
die Enthiillung eines neuen Seinsgebietes, und zwar eines Gebietes in-
dividuellen Seins. Was fiir ein Seinsgebiet ist es aber? Das Seinsgebiet 
des reinen BewuBtseins, meines reinen BewuBtseins, meines reinen Ich. 
Erst die Reduktion also soU mir iiberhaupt die Augen dafiir oiInen, was 
das reine BewuBtsein ist, sie soU mir das Wesen des reinen BewuBtseins 
zeigen. Nun, wenn ich schon weill, was es ist, dann weiB ich auch, was 
mir nach Vo11zug der Reduktion bleibt, und was das Transzendente ist, 
was ich da jetzt irgendwie durch Analyse des reinen BewuBtseins her-
vorbringen so11, diese Welt. Wenn ich es aber nicht weiB, kann mir dies 
die Reduktion selbst sagen? 
Ich habe es nun so gemacht - in diesem Gang - daB ich doch zuerst 
iiber die Reduktion gesprochen habe. Diejenigen Abschnitte, welche die 
idealistische Entscheidung Husserls in den Id~en enthalten, und die auch 
die Thesis iiber das reine BewuBtsein enthalten, habe ich zunachst bei 
Seite geschoben. Habe ich da Husserl gefalscht? Ja, in Bezug auf den 
Text von Husserl in den Ideen habe ich etwas verschoben. Aber - Husserl 
hat mir einst wahrend eines Gespraches selbst gesagt: "Natiirlich, wenn 
ich das schreiben sollte, so miiBte ich doch zunachst den Weg der Re-
duktion sehen. Tatsachlich ist aU das, was im Text der Ideen vor der 
Reduktion steht - iiber das BewuBtsein, iiber das Wesen, iiber die Welt 
- schon auf Grund der Reduktion gesagt worden". Nun, das ist also 
seine Erklarung iiber seinen tatsachlichen Gang der Betrachtung und im 
gewissen Sinne glaube ich, daB das richtig ist. Es muB so sein, wenn die 
Funktion der Reduktion wirklich die EroiInung eines Ausblicks auf ein 
neues Seinsgebiet sein soll, - Seinsgebiet des individueUen Seins zunachst, 
dieser sogenannten 'Irrealitaten', die dann eidetisch erfaBt werden. Es ist 
so richtig, ich habe also Husserl doch nicht gefalscht. Das ist doch der 
Sinn der Reduktion, daB sie das leistet bzw. leisten soU, und das hat 
Husserl mir selbst gesagt. 
Also werde ich jetzt so weiter verfahren, daB ich mich zuerst mit der 
Reduktion beschiiftige. Alle Bedenken, die ich dagegen habe, werde ich 

26 
ROMANINGARDEN 
Ihnen kurz andeuten. Und dann erst werde ich zu dem Standpunkt des 
Idealismus kommen, zur Beschreibung des sogenannten Idealismus von 
Husserl, wie er in den Ideen I zum Ausdruck kommt. Denn der Stand-
punkt des Husserlschen Idealismus in den Ideen ist nicht identisch mit 
dem Standpunkt, den Husserl spiiter als transzendentaler Idealist ein-
genommen hat - in den Meditations Cartesiennes, in der Formalen und 
transzendentalen Logik und auch nachher. In den Ideen I sind die Haupt-
thesen dieses Idealismus so formuliert, daB manche von ihnen auch 
spater ohne Anderung auftreten. Andere Behauptungen sind aber so 
formuliert, daB man bei dieser Formulierung noch bei dem sogenannten 
'Realismus' bleiben kann. Das ist zum Teil Formulierung der Argumen-
tation, der Thesis, zum Teil ist das auch in dem Sinn der einzelnen Be-
griffe verdeckt, die Husserl verwendet. Der erste Begriff, auf den es zu-
nachst ankommt, ist der Begriff der 'Setzung', den ich schon ganz am 
Anfang erwahnt habe und der zuerst so viel bedeutet als 'Im-Sein-An-
erkennen'. - Spater, also schon in den spaten zwanziger Jahren, in den 
Meditations Cartesiennes und in der Formalen und transzendentalen 
Logik ist das schon konsequent in einem anderen Sinne gemeint. Es 
kommt nicht so sehr auf 'Setzung', als auf'Stiftung' an, - die Welt wird 
'gestiftet'. Und damit andert sich jetzt der Sinn der Funktion jedes 
transzendenten Erkenntnisaktes. In jedem solchen Akte ist dieses Mo-
ment der Stiftung enthalten. AIle transzendenten Gegenstande werden 
von dem Jahre 1929 ab 'gestiftet', das heiBt, kurz gesagt, transzendental 
intentional geschaffen. 
Wenn ich hier tiber den 'transzendentalen Idealismus' von Husserl 
spreche, so geschieht das ausschlieBlich von dem Standpunkt aus, der 
in den Ideen I enthalten ist, und zwar genauer sogar nur in einem Teil 
der Ideen. Denn, wenn Sie die Ideen Ibis zum SchluB lesen, werden Sie 
sehen, daB, sobald Husser! die konstitutive Problematik entwickelt - die 
sogenannten Vernunftfragen, die 'Rechtsfragen' - sich da schon eine 
Problematik er6ffnet, die ihn dann spater zu einem idealistischen SchluB 
fiihrt. Dieser Weg ist da schon vorgezeichnet. Er wuBte in dem Moment, 
wo er das schrieb, daB ein Gebiet des reinen BewuBtseins vorliegt, welches 
in den Ideen I noch gar nicht behandelt wird, und zwar das ursprtingliche, 
das sogenannte 'innere' BewuBtsein, das BewuBtsein im FluB, wo es 
noch keine - wie muB ich das sagen? - konstituierten Erlebnisse gibt. 
In den Ideen wird zunachst lediglich dargesteIlt: Es sind im BewuBtsein 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
27 
Akte vorhanden, es sind alles Einheiten, BewuBtseinseinheiten. Es ist 
nicht dieser letzte FluB des BewuBtseins, der da behandelt wird, dieser 
wird auf eine bewuBte Weise zuriickgeschoben, und wird erst spater in 
den Vorlesungen zur Phiinomenologie des inneren ZeitbewujJtseins seinen 
literarischen Niederschlag finden. 
Jetzt aber zuriick zu den Fragen, die ich stellen will. Es besteht vor 
aHem fUr mich das folgende Problem: Was ist die Reduktion - struk-
turell ? 1st sie ein einzelner Akt, und zwar ein Akt, in dem sie voIlzogen 
wird, - und zugleich eine Entscheidung, ein Entschluss? Mit anderen 
Worten, ich vollziehe jetzt die Reduktion und entschlieBe mich daran 
festzuhalten. Warum solI ich daran festhalten? Nun, wei I ich erst dann 
eine Untersuchung nach der EinsteHung der Reduktion durchfUhren 
kann. Natiirlich, der Anfang der Reduktion - das ist ein Akt, das ist ein 
BeschluB. Aber wie ist das nun: Geht dieser EntschluB voriiber? Oder 
bleiben Spuren davon? Erhalt sich diese besondere Einstellung, die ich 
willentlich und mit einem Akt erzwinge ? Oder geht sie voriiber ? Welche 
'Auswirkungen' hat dieser Akt der Reduktion fUr mich selbst? Laufen 
meine Erlebnisse so ab, daB sie aIle in der Reduktion fungieren? Oder 
geht dies voriiber, kehre ich zu der natiirlichen Einstellung, die ich vor 
der Reduktion einnahm, zuriick? Ich weiB es nicht. Ich erinnere mich 
jedoch, wie schwierig es war, als wir damals, 1913 oder 1914, alle ver-
suchten, es zu tun. Wenn man das ganz ernst nimmt, wie junge Leute 
das gew6hnlich tun, so ist das wie ein Traum, in den man sich hinein-
versetzt. Man kehrt zuriick zum taglichen Leben, aber sobald man ar-
beitet, muB man diese Einstellung annehmen, sonst ware es falsch, sagt 
Husserl. Es scheint, daB der Effekt dieses Aktes der Reduktion in ge-
wissem Sinne ein Zustand ist. Nicht wahr? Es miiBte eigentlich ein Zu-
stand sein. Denn sonst miiBte man sich jeden Moment von Neuem 
sagen: Jetzt mache ich Reduktion, jetzt reduziere ich, jetzt ziehe ich mich 
zuriick usw. Dann ist also die Reduktion nicht als Akt zu verstehen, 
sondern als Wandel des BewuBtseins iiberhaupt, und zwar durch und 
durch. 1st es aber richtig, wenn ich 'durch und durch' sage? Nein, das 
ist nicht richtig. Es sollte eigentlich so sein. Aber Husserl selbst sagt: 
Nein, ich will die Reduktion, die ich da als Operation benutze, nicht so 
weit durchfUhren. Sie k6nnte so weit gehen, daB alles, mein ganzes Be-
wuBtsein, reduziert wird, alles in der Position 'der Einklammerung', oder 
besser des 'Einklammerns' verlauft. Ich voIlziehe freilich die Setzungen 

28 
ROMANINGARDEN 
der realen Welt, meiner Bekannten usw., aber trotzdem immer mit der 
Einschdinkung der 'Ausschaltung', ich ziehe mich etwas davon zuriick. 
Dieses Erlebnis des Sich-Zuriickziehens und auch die Erlebnisse, die ich 
auf meine Erlebnisse richte, immanente Wahmehmungen also, mit denen 
ich die Analyse des reinen BewuBtseins treiben solI, sind 'thetische' Akte. 
SoIlen sie auch reduziert werden? Nein, sagt Husserl, so weit geht es 
nicht. Das kann man tun, wenn man will. Aber ich will doch, sagt 
Husserl, gerade eine Wissenschaft vom reinen BewuBtsein treiben, - mit 
immanenten Wahmehmungen als thetischen Akten, und darauf gegriin-
deten Urteilen iiber meine Erlebnisse, die wiederum thetisch sein soIlen, 
aIles also 'thetisch'. Das Merkwiirdige ist nun: Ich bin in gewissem Sinne 
gespalten. Namlich das, was sich auf die transzendente Welt und auf 
Transzendentes iiberhaupt bezieht, ist reduziert, und da muB ich jene 
besondere SteIlung einnehmen, wenn es gelingen solI. Und zugleich muB 
ich sozusagen den Rest, das heiBt die wirkliche wissenschaftliche philo-
sophische Arbeit in der thetischen EinsteIlung, also ohne Reduktion 
durchfiihren. 
Die Situation ist jetzt kompliziert, nicht wahr? Denn einerseits habe 
ich zunachst die natiirliche Generalthesis der Welt; die wird reduziert, 
es wird Distanz dazu genommen, so als ob ich mir iiberhaupt verbieten 
wiirde, irgendetwas zu behaupten, zu Thesen zu fiihren. Zugleich solI 
sichjedoch wiederum eine Wandlung voIlziehen. Ich muB also meine auf 
meine Erlebnisse gerichtete immanente Wahmehmung, die Analyse des 
in ihr Gegebenen usw. wiederum ganz serios machen, namlich in der 
natiirlichen thetischen EinsteIlung. Dies wird doch von Husserl gefor-
dert, nicht wahr? Sonst kann er keine Phanomenologie als Wissenschaft 
treiben. 
Das ist also die erste Gruppe von Fragen, die sich auf die Struktur 
und auf die Funktion der Reduktion beziehen. Ich glaube, man muB 
Beides sagen: Es ist ein Akt, und es gibt mehrere solcher Akte, wenn 
man zuriickkehrt zu der Arbeit, und dann gibt es eine dauerhafte Ein-
steIlung. Wie dies moglich ist, das ist eine andere Frage. Das muB jeder 
bei sich selbst erfahren. 
Die zweite Frage - eine Frage, die sogleich ein Punkt des Streites sein 
wird, lautet: 1st die transzendentale Reduktion die unentbehrIlche und 
natiirlich hinreichende Bedingung jeder philosophischen Betrachtung? 
Oder ist sie nur eine Ubergangsphase einer philosophischen Betrachtung? 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
29 
Viele meiner Freunde, altere Freunde von mir, waren der Meinung: Nun 
schon, machen wir also diese Reduktion, und nehmen wir an, daB es uns 
gelungen ist, das reine BewuBtsein zu beschreiben, zu analysieren, die 
Funktionen der verschiedenen Erlebnisse zu erfassen, Leistungen zu er-
fassen, die durch diese Funktionen zustandekamen. SchlieBlich kommt 
der Moment daB wir schon wissen, was da in unserem BewuBtsein ge-
schieht, z.B. wenn ich diesen Saal sehe und ihn als Realitat annehme. 
Vnd so geht es weiter in Bezug auf die ganze Welt. Also habe ich das 
Erkennen der realen Welt analysiert, und zwar, sagen wir zunachst, der 
physischen Welt, urn die Situation zu vereinfachen. Ja, was dann? Da 
war ich die ganze Zeit mit der Analyse der Erkenntnisoperationen, der 
Leistungen, Erkenntnisleistungen beschaftigt. Es ist alles in gewissem 
Sinne Erkenntnistheorie, nur, daB sie auf dem Grunde des reinen Be-
wuBtseins und innerhalb des 1mmanenten behandelt wird. SolI ich nun 
einfach sagen: Nun, es ist mir gelungen zu zeigen, daB die Konstitution 
des physischen Dinges in diesen Wahrnehmungen rechtmaBig ist, und so 
ist es SchluB mit der ganzen philosophischen Problematik? Oder solI 
ich sagen: Nein, es ist nicht SchluB. Wenn die Erkenntnis der auBeren 
Wahrnehmung sich so abspielt und rechtmaBig ist, nun, was heiBt das? 
Das heiBt, daB das, was da in der Erfahrung festgestellt wird, wirklich 
so ist, wie es erfaBt wird. Nicht wahr? Vnd das SchluSergebnis lautet: 
Nun, es gibt eine Welt dieser Dinge, die in der sinnlichen Erfahrung 
analysiert wurden. 1st das so einfach zu machen? Oder sind da mehrere 
Komplikationen vorhanden? Jedenfalls fragt es sich: Ja, urn Gottes 
Willen, wozu haben wir diese ganze Analyse des reinen BewuBtseins 
betrieben - diese Analysen, wie das beim Erkennen verlauft, welche 
Funktionen da ausgetibt werden - ist das alles richtig oder unrichtig? 
J a, um zu wissen, ob die Welt wirklich ist und wie sie ist. - Das war 
eben, was uns bertihrte. Es eroffnet sich nach der ganzen Analyse das 
Postulat, eine metaphysische Entscheidung zu erzielen. Nicht wahr? 
Wenigstens eine ontologische Entscheidung - die Ontologien sind ja auch 
eingeklammert, wie es sich gezeigt hat. 1st also die Reduktion vielleicht 
nur eine notwendige Phase des Philosophierens? Vnd solI sie dann in 
einem Moment dem Aufheben unterliegen? Man muS sich doch einmal 
entschlieBen, tiber die Welt zu urteilen und dann Metaphysik zu treiben 
und Ontologie zu treiben, was urn so wichtiger ist, als ja die ganze pha-
nomenologische Analyse unter der Klausel der Reduktion doch eidetisch 

30 
ROMANINGARDEN 
getrieben wird. Sie wird nicht an Individuen, an gerade vollzogenen 
Wahmehmungen betrieben. Was ich am Ende erhalte, das ist, wenn es 
positiv ist, nur dies: Es ist prinzipiell moglich, daB eine in ihrem Wesen 
so und so verlaufende Erfahrung zu einem positiven Ergebnis fUhrt. 
Damit ist noch nicht gesagt, was ich faktisch tue, ob das wirklich eine 
Erfahrung ist. Nicht wahr? Damit ist auch noch nicht gesagt, womit ich 
es individuell in dieser Welt zu tun habe, ob es wirklich real und so be-
schaffen ist, wie es mir in individuo erscheint? In der Phanomenologie 
ist immer nur von einer moglichen Welt die Rede, - einer moglichen, 
realen Welt. Aber das interessiert mich letzten Endes gar wenig. Ich 
mochte doch wissen, wie diese Welt wirklich ist, in der ich noch lebe. 
Was war die Antwort Husserls? Ich weiB jetzt nicht genau, ob er mir 
das wirklich personlich gesagt hat oder ob ich das bei ihm nur gelesen 
habe. Es ist nicht notig, die Reduktion aufzuheben und auf die natiirliche 
Einstellung zUrUckzugreifen, und Metaphysik zu treiben, denn alles wird 
erledigt in der Analyse, die unter der Klausel der Reduktion durchge-
fUhrt wird. Die Reduktion solI eine, fUr jede Philosophie unentbehrliche 
und fUr immer unentbehrliche Bedingung eines Philosophierens iiber das 
Sein sein. Die in dieser Einstellung gewonnenen Ergebnisse losen alles, 
aIle Probleme auf, man braucht keine Metaphysik mehr. Denn in ge-
wissem Sinne ist die Entscheidung, die man auf diesem Gebiet erreicht, 
schon eine metaphysische Entscheidung. Und es ist natiirlich klar: Wenn 
die Losung transzendental-idealistisch ist, wenn Realitat nichts anderes 
als Korrelat einer unendlichen Mannigfaltigkeit von bestimmt geregel-
ten Wahrnehmungen und Gedankenoperationen ist, nun, dann kann 
man alles schon in der Analyse des reinen BewuBtseinsam Akt und am 
Korrelat tinden. Nur eines ist wahr, wie das die Neokantisten auch sagen, 
daB es eine unendliche Aufgabe ist. Aber der Effekt ist doch eindeutig. 
Das war also der andere strittige Punkt zwischen Husserl und manchen 
seiner alteren Schiiler. Denn die spaten Schiiler Husserls, d.h. seine 
SchUler aus der Freiburger Zeit, sahen schon keine Schwierigkeit darin, 
sie sind irgendwie in das ganze Fahrwasser der transzendentalen Phano-
menologie gekommen und waren iiberzeugt, es sei alles in Ordnung, und 
es sei auch nichts mehr zu machen. Das dauerte iibrigens nicht lange. 
Dann kam es zu einer Katastrophe in der Entwicklung der sogenannten 
Freiburger phanomenologischen Schule. Das war die Wirkung Heideg-
gers, der eine ganz andere Problematik eingefiihrt hat, welche fUr die 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTJON 
31 
jungen Leute dama1s besser verstandlich war und ihnen auch naher 
stand, weil er aus derselben Nachkriegs-Generation war und sich des-
wegen viel besser mit der Jugend, die aus dem Krieg zuriickkehrte, ver-
stand. Heidegger war auch sicher ein groBeres Rednertalent als Husserl. 
Komplikationen traten ein. Diejenigen Probleme, die friiher, infolge der 
Logischen Untersuchungen und des ersten Bandes der Ideen lebendig 
waren, sind eigentlich verschwunden. Hussed, der sich nach dem Kriege 
entschieden zu dem transzendentalen Idealismus bekannt hatte, kannte 
mit den neuen Schiilem keine Schwierigkeiten auf dem Gebiete der 
transzendentalen Reduktion. 1m Herbst 1927 kam ich zu Hussed - ich 
zitiere nicht ein Gesprach mit ihm, sondem mit einem SchUler, der 
Hussed damals sehr nahe stand, es war jedoch nicht Heidegger, - und 
ich stellte die Frage: Wie ist das mit der Konstitution? Gibt es da nicht 
ein Gebiet, das vor der Konstitution liegt? Und gibt es nicht auch Pro-
bleme, die vor der Konstitution problematisch behandelt werden 
miissen? - Da sagte er mir: Nein, alles ist konstituiert. Es gibt nichts, 
was nicht konstituiert ware. Alles ist Effekt einer Konstitution, und alles 
als solches geht in gewissem Sinne iiber die letzte urspriingliche imma-
nente Sphare hinaus. Alles ist konstituiert. Zu dem Nicht-Konstituierten, 
also zu dem, woraus diese ganze Konstitution sich entwickelt, bzw. sich 
entwickeln solI, kann man im Grunde nicht vordringen. So weit war 
das. 
Nichtsdestoweniger glaube ich, daB die Frage besteht: SolI die trans-
zendentale Reduktion und die transzendentale Analyse die letzte, die 
erste und letzte Operation in der Philo sophie sein ? Oder ist sie nur ein 
Weg, manche hochstwichtigen Probleme zu losen, urn dann mit dem 
Apparat, den man da gewonnen hat, doch zu den alten metaphysischen 
Problemen zuriickzukehren ? 
Ich habe das schon erwahnt und werde es kurz behandeln. Ich glaube, 
daB es als Operation zweiedei ist, die transzendentale Reduktion durch-
zufiihren und die positiven Wissenschaften bei den phanomenologischen 
Analysen 'auszuschalten'. Die Reduktion, die bei der Generalthesis der 
natiidichen Einstellung einsetzt oder sie irgendwie 'reduziert', bringt eine 
radikale Wandlung in der allgemeinen Einstellung und in der Behand-
lungsweise, hervor und dasjenige, was in den Ideen und sonst von Hussed 
mit Recht gefordert wird, daB man die positive Wissenschaft bei be-
stimmten Problemen der Philosophie und insbesondere bei allen richtig 

32 
ROMANINGARDEN 
fonnulierten erkenntnistheoretischen Problemen ausschalten muB, be-
deutet nur, daB man sich in der Philosophie auf gar keine positiv wissen-
schaftliche Behauptung berufen darf. Es heiBt nur dies, daB kein Satz 
der positiven Wissenschaft, also Naturwissenschaft, Geisteswissenschaft, 
Mathematik usw., dem man nichts vorzuwerfen hat, und fUr den die 
Physiker, Chemiker, Mathematiker usw. verantwortlich sind, vorausge-
setzt werden darf. Wir, Philosophen, bedienen uns des sen nicht als Vor-
aussetzung unserer Analysen. Reinach hat im Herbst 1913 in seinem 
Seminar das Problem der Bewegung gestellt. Er hat es in Zusammenhang 
mit den Paradoxien von Zenon, namlich dieses Problem mit Achilles und 
der Schildkrote usw. gebracht. Er wollte die Schwierigkeiten, die den 
Paradoxien zugrundeliegen, irgendwie iiberwinden. Er entwickelte selbst 
die Paradoxien viel weiter, als das Zenon gemacht hatte, und hat gesagt, 
das Achilles Paradoxon sei doch nicht zu iiberwinden, der Vorsprung des 
Tieres sei nicht annullierbar. Ja, das sagt im Grunde auch die Mathema-
tik. Natiirlich: die Reihe 1, t, i, ... usw. enthiilt keine Null. Der Vor-
sprung ware annullierbar, dies lieBe sich mathematisch so ausdriicken, 
daB es in der Reihe der Vorgange eine Null gabe, aber die gibt es eben 
nicht. Was war nun die Lehre Reinachs? Er hat diese These aufgestellt: 
Es sei falsch, daB ein Korper bei einer Bewegung in einem Moment -
und zwar in einem physikalischen Moment - in einem Punkt ist. Das 
sei falsch. Man muB annehmen, daB der sich bewegende Korper in einem 
Moment einen kleinen Abschnitt, eine kleine Strecke passiert. Diese 
These hat Reinach mehrere Monate verteidigt, dann hat er sie zuriick-
gezogen. Aber die erste Reaktion von meinem Freunde und Kollegen 
Professor Ajdukiewicz, der damals junger Doktor war und in der Mathe-
matik, Physik usw. weit fortgeschritten war, war die: Er sagte zu Reinach: 
"Herr Doktor, wie konnen Sie da so etwas behaupten? Es steht doch im 
Widerspruch mit der Axiomatik der Mengenlehre - in krassem Wider-
spruch! Kennen Sie nicht die Mengenlehre?" - Reinach antwortete: "Ja, 
es tut mir sehr leid, Herr Doktor, aber das ist Mathematik, und ich bin 
Philosoph. Ich darf nicht die Axiomatik der Mengenlehre voraussetzen. 
Vielleicht ist es sehr weise, aber in meinen Analysen darf das nicht an-
genommen werden". Es ist SchluB, aile positiven Wissenschaften werden 
ausgeschaltet. Ich meine, diese Forderung muB angenommen werden. 
Wir miissen uns sagen: Auch die schonste, die best begriindete Wissen-
schaft nehmen wir nicht als Prinzip, als Voraussetzung unserer weiteren 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
33 
Erwagungen an. Der Physiker und der Physiologe sagen, es geschieht 
dies und dies im Raum, namlich eine Welle oder ein kosmischer Strahl, 
und dieser Vorgang trifft den Endpunkt meines Nervs, und daraus ent-
steht dies und dies in dem zentralen Nervenapparat, und dann sehe ich 
rot, nicht wahr? Das behauptet man immer wieder, neue Entdeckungen 
auf diesem Gebiet sind gerade gemacht worden. Dann sagt der Phano-
menologe: Ja, das ist schon und gut, aber da haben Sie schon voraus-
gesetzt, daB physikalische Dinge iiberhaupt existieren. Damit haben Sie 
zugleich vorausgesetzt, daB die Erkenntnis der physikalischen Dinge 
rechtmaBig ist. Ja, wenn Sie das getan haben, so brauchen Sie nicht 
weiter zu philosophieren, es ist entweder ein Widerspruch, oder eine 
petitio principii - und SchluB. Und in dem Sinne glaube ich, ist es moglich 
und notwendig in gewissen Problemen der Erkenntnistheorie, namlich 
in der Erkenntniskritik, diese Reduktion, diese Ausschaltung der sogar 
schonsten positiven Wissenschaft zu vollziehen. - Aber das ist nicht das-
selbe und nicht so schwierig wie die Reduktion der Generalthesis der 
realen Welt in der natiirliche Einstellung. In der Anschauung muB jetzt 
etwas ganz Besonderes passieren, nicht wahr? 
Eine weitere Frage ist: Woraufsoll die transzendentale Reduktion, die 
phanomenologische Reduktion angewendet werden? Dies ist natiirlich 
bei Hussed gesagt worden. Namlich zunachst solI die Generalthesis der 
realen Welt reduziert werden. Deswegen habe ich ja gefragt, was die 
Generalthesis ist. Und Hussed hat selbst gesagt, und zwar in den Ideen, 
daB die Generalthesis kein Akt ist, kein U rteilsakt, sondern etwas, was 
irgendwie bestandig ist. Ja, wie solI ich jetzt die Reduktion auf diese be-
standig da seiende Stellungnahme (oder wie Sie das nennen wollen) an-
wenden? Ich habe versucht - durch Kontrast mit Phychastenie usw. -
das irgendwie aufzuklaren. Aber wie geht das zu? Wie kann dieser 
standige Zustand nun modifiziert werden? Vielleicht gelingt es. Aber 
diese Reduktion bezieht sich nicht nur auf die Generalthesis selbst, auf 
meinen Zustand, - sie bezieht sich auf das unter der Generalthesis Ste-
hende. Was ist das, was unter der Generalthesis steht? Das ist die Welt 
- ja, und da sagt Husserl: die Welt der natiirlichen Einstellung. Das soIl 
reduziert werden. Was solI da reduziert werden? Der Seinscharakter, das 
Korrelat zu der Generalthesis, der Seinscharakter der realen Welt, der 
Seinscharakter jedes Dinges, das ich wahrnehme? Das soIl irgendwie 
doch modifiziert werden. 

34 
ROMANINGARDEN 
Aber es kommt mir auf etwas anderes an: Wie weit reicht diese Welt? 
Was gehort zu dieser real en Welt? Es wird gesagt: die raumlich-zeitliche 
Mannigfaltigkeit von Dingen - und von Menschen und Tieren, mich 
auch eingerechnet. Gehort dazu auch das physikalische Ding, und zwar 
das, was wir heute dariiber wissen? Was HusserI wuBte, hat sich in-
zwischen verandert, nicht wahr? - Auf welchem Stand war damals, also 
vor 1913, die Theorie des Atoms? Die Borsche Theorie war schon da,-
vieles hat sich auf verschiedene Weise gewandelt, - und dann kam die 
Zerstorung des Atoms usw. - Gehort das auch zu der realen Welt der 
natiirIichen Einstellung? Und analog - wenn Sie an die Astronomie 
denken, an die Astronomie, die Astrophysik insbesondere, die verschie-
denen Theorien, was z.B. in unserer Sonne geschieht usw. Gerade hat 
irgendein Herr einen Nobelpreis dafiir bekommen - gehort das auch zu 
der natiirIichen Welt? Oder ist es nur Produkt eines weiteren Konstitu-
tionsvorgangs, das aber zu unserer Welt in gewissem Sinne nicht gehort? 
HusserI wollte das spater genauer bestimmen. Denn in der Krisis hat er 
an Stelle des Begriffes der 'natiirlichen Welt' doch einen anderen Begriff 
eingefiihrt, namlich den der Lebenswelt. Die Lebenswelt, das ist zwar 
auch die Welt in der natiirlichen Einstellung, - aber es ist doch nicht 
dasselbe, nicht so ganz ungenau gesagt, wie die natiirliche Welt. Denn 
es wird gesagt: die Lebenswelt - das ist das, was noch bleibt, wenn ich 
aIle Theorien beiseite schaffe, aIle Theorien sozusagen ausschalte, also 
die theoretische Physik, die Biochemie, die Mikrobiologie usw. Das soIl 
ich alles ausschalten. Aber das ist zugleich die Welt, in der wir leben, 
das ist die zweite Bestimmung; die Welt mit der wir hantieren - die ganze 
Technik gehort dazu, meine Technik auch. 1st es wirklich so, daB wir 
in einer Welt leben, eine Lebenswelt gemeinsam haben, in der die Atome 
nichts zu sagen haben, in der es noch keine Atome - keine Atomkeme 
gibt? Rechnen wir damit nicht in unseren Handlungen? Konnten wir 
unsere Technik aufbauen, ohne das zu beriicksichtigen? Ja, wenn man 
so einen 'Sputnik' baut, der von auBen her nicht verbrannt werden darf 
- ja, da muB er an der AuBenseite mit einer besonderen Substanz belegt 
sein, welche Strahlen verschiedener Art zuriickwirft. Er enthalt in sich 
eine groBe Menge hochst praziser Apparate, deren Konstruktion die 
Giiltigkeit der modemsten Ergebnisse der heutigen Naturwissenschaft 
voraussetzt. Ganze Zweige der hochleistungsHihigen Industrie sind im 
Zusammenhang damit entstanden und bereichem unsere Lebenswelt mit 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
35 
ihren Erzeugnissen. Dasselbe gilt in Bezug auf die modeme Biologie, 
Biochemie und deren praktische Anwendungen in der Medizin, in der 
Zootechnik usw. usw. Das alles ist etwas, was zu unserer heutigen Lebens-
welt gehort - in sHindigem Wandel begriffen. 1m Zusammenhang damit 
und in dem Sinne ist zunachst der Umfang dessen, woran die Reduktion 
angewendet werden solI, irgendwie unbestimmt. Spater, nach der Ein-
fiihrung der Reduktion, sagt Husserl freilich, daB die positiven Wissen-
schaften reduziert, 'ausgeschaltet' werden sollen. Aber jetzt frage ich: 
mit welchem Recht? Denn dieser ganze Bereich geht schon tiber die 
Generalthesis vieler von uns hinaus. Es muB ihn bei diesem ganzen Ver-
fahren etwas lei ten, wenn er, im Endeffekt, sagt, daB ich auch dies aus-
schalten solI. Was ist das? was ihn da leitet? - Husserl spricht von ver-
schiedenen 'Ausschaltungen', der Naturwissenschaften, der Geisteswis-
senschaften, Mathematik, Logik als formaler mathesis universalis. Dann 
sollen auch alle materialen Ontologien ausgeschaltet werden. Warum? 
Ja, das sind doch Wissenschaften, die ohne Reduktion durchgeftihrt 
wurden - und womit beschaftigen sie sich? Mit transzendenten Wesen. 
Und alle transzendenten Wesen sind eben nicht immanent. Aber wenn 
die fonnalen und materialen Ontologien ausgeschaltet wtirden, dann ist 
doch der Grund vieler phanomenologischer Entscheidungen fortgefallen. 
Es laBt sich dann das reine BewuBtsein von allen transzendenten Gebie-
ten nicht abscheiden. Es solI auch die Transzendenz Gottes ausgeschaltet 
werden. Dies alles hat mit der Generalthesis nichts zu tun. Es entscheidet 
die 'Transzendenz' im ontischen Sinne dem reinen BewuBtsein gegen-
tiber. Dann hat aber Husserl Schwierigkeiten: Wie steht es mit 'meinem' 
reinen Ich? Das reine Ich - ist doch kein Erlebnis, ist auch kein be-
standiges Datum im Erlebnisstrom, es ist ihm doch transzendent. SolI 
mein reines Ich auch unter die Klausel der Reduktion fallen? Da sagt 
Husserl: Nein, nein, das nicht, - das Ich gehort also zur Struktur des 
BewuBtseins. Dann zitiert er Kant und im Grunde auch Descartes. Ich 
sage das etwas anders: Jedes Erlebnis hat eine besondere Ich-Fonn, 
Form der ersten Person. AIle meine Erlebnisse sind 'Erste-Person-Erleb-
nisse'. - nicht Er-Erlebnisse und Sie-Erlebnisse, und Du-Erlebnisse, son-
dem Ich-Erlebnisse. Also an der Struktur liegt es, - obwohl das reine Ich 
kein Element des BewuBtseins ist; die Struktur des BewuBtseins weist 
eindeutig darauf hin, es ist nicht moglich anders zu verfahren als das 
reine Ich mit seinen reinen Erlebnissen absolut anzuerkennen. Das sind 

36 
ROMANINGARDEN 
also die Antworten Husserls darauf, was reduziert werden solI, der Reihe 
nacho So weit geht das, - also nicht nur die natiirliche Welt, auch ver-
schiedenes andere, auch die Gegenstande der Mathematik, der Logik, 
der formalen Ontologie usw., und Gott auch. 
Was leitet ihn da? Leitet ihn das Wesen des reinen BewuBtseins? Ja, 
aber das Wesen des reinen BewuBtseins solI doch erst vermittels der Re-
duktion entdeckt werden, nicht umgekehrt, - das habe ich schon nach 
H usserl gesagt. Wenn man dann sozusagen nachspiirt, wenn man schon 
weill, worin seine Ste11ung besteht, die man den transzendentalen Ideal-
ismus nennt, dann glaube ich, daB der Begriif, der da dirigierend ist, der 
zu der Abscheidung des sen fiihrt, was als das Residuum der Reduktion 
bleiben so11, der Begriff der ontischen Transzendenz ist. Deswegen habe 
ich hier die verschiedenen Begriife, erkenntnistheoretische Begriife, on-
tische Transzendenz-Begriife usw. unterschieden. Das ist die Entschei-
dung: immanent ist bloB dies, was reelles Element meines BewuBtseins 
ist, Element meines BewuBtseinsstroms, - immanent gerichtete Erkennt-
nisakte, BewuBtseinsakte sind solche, die sich auf etwas beziehen, was 
Element meines BewuBtseinsstromes ist, ree1ler Teil, reelles Bestand-
stiick dieses BewuBtseins. Und transzendent gerichtete - das sind die-
jenigen, wo das nicht stattfindet, das ist kurz gesagt. 
Ich erinnere: Die immanente Wahmehmung - das ist ein besonderer 
Akt von den immanent gerichteten Akten, namlich derjenige Akt, in 
dem eine unvermittelte Einheit zwischen dem Wahrgenommenen, mei-
nem Erlebnis und meiner immanenten Wahmehmung, meinem Wahr-
nehmen besteht. Das Wahmehmen meines Erlebnisses ist sozusagen auf-
gebaut auf dem Erlebnis, worauf das Wahmehmen gerichtet ist. Es ist 
relativ zu diesem wahrgenommenen Erlebnis, seinsunselbstandig. Es ex-
istiert nur dann, wenn das Erlebnis existiert, worauf sich die Wahr-
nehmung richtet. Wo das nicht stattfindet, also z.B. bei Erinnerungen 
an Erlebnisse des die Erinnerung vol1ziehenden Ich, ist schon diese Im-
manenz nicht vorhanden. Denn vergangene Erlebnisse bilden keine un-
vermittelte Einheit mit meinem Erinnem, nicht wahr, und mit der Re-
flexion in der Erinnerung auch nicht. Da sind schon Distanzen vorhan-
den. Streng immanent ist eigentlich nur das, was sich im Bereich des 
aktuellen Jetzt der immanenten Wahmehmung vollzieht - und wo das 
nicht stattfindet, dort ist schon Transzendenz. Das Transzendente in 
diesem Sinne - in diesem Sinne, daB es nicht zu meinem BewuBtsein-

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
37 
strom reell gehort, ist - jetzt kommen die anderen Begriffe der Transzen-
denz ins Spiel - nur durch Abschattungen, durch Erscheinungen gege-
ben, und es ist immer einseitig gegeben, - es ist immer in einem Wahr-
nehmen gegeben, das transzendierend ist uber das eigentlich Gegebene 
an der Vorderseite. Vnd was hinten ist, was im Innem ist, das ist nicht 
gegeben, es kann beim nachsten Schritt gezeigt werden. Also ich schneide 
den Apfel in zwei Teile und sehe, was im Innem ist. Aber das Innere 
ist nicht zu beseitigen, ich muB ins Vnendliche schneiden, es bleibt aber 
immer das Innere und die andere Seite. 
Es konnte passieren, daB nach 100 Jahren, wie Husserl sagt, alles ex-
plodiert, und es sich zeigte, daB es im Grunde gar keinen Apfel gab, und 
alles bisher Gegebene, das waren lediglich geregelte Tauschungen in ge-
wissem Sinne. Es ist nie sicher, absolut sicher, daB das existiert, was 
transzendent erkannt wird. Das absolut Sichere ist ausschlieBlich das 
eigene momentan wahrgenommene Erlebnis in seiner Existenz. In Bezug 
auf alles Andere kann prinzipiell Zweifel erhoben werden, das ist prinz i-
piell denkbar, - ja, und deswegen eroffnet es zunachst einen Ausblick 
auf neue Probleme. Da ist Descartes mit im Spiel, nicht wahr? Nur das 
immanent Wahrgenommene ist absolut selbstgegeben, nicht durch Er-
scheinungen, und es ist nicht einseitig gegeben, sondem voll, und es ist 
absolut gesichert in seiner Existenz. Das ist dieses Motiv, das Husserl 
diktiert, was ausgeschaltet werden solI, was reduziert werden solI, - das, 
was nicht absolut seinsmaBig notwendig ist, was sich aus der Struktur 
desselben Aktes oder deren Mannigfaltigkeit nicht ergibt. Die auBere 
Wahmehmung ist so strukturiert, daB sich aus dieser Struktur die Exis-
tenz des Wahrgenommenen nicht ergibt, es kann trotzdem, obwohl es 
wahrgenommen wird, nicht sein. Es ist sehr unwahrscheinlich, daB es 
es nicht gabe, - aber es kann doch nicht sein. Vnd als solches solI es eben 
der Reduktion verfallen. Da bleibt bloB das aktuelle reine BewuBtsein 
ubrig. 
Nun, es scheint, da haben wir sozusagen die Losung gefunden: Der 
dirigierende Begriff der Abgrenzung des reinen BewuBtseins von allem 
Anderen - ist zunachst der Begriff der ontischen Transzendenz und dann 
diese Begriffe der erkenntnistheoretischen Transzendenzen, die wir in 
Bezug auf das Einseitige usw. erfassen. Warum aber verwendet Husserl 
die beiden Transzendenzbegriffe, die er freilich zwar inhaltlich - wie das 
aus dem Obigen deutlich hervorgeht - auseinanderhalt, aber termino-

38 
ROMANINGARDEN 
logisch nicht voneinander abgrenzt. Konnte er sich nicht mit dem on-
tischen Begriff zufrieden stellen? Diese Transzendenz entscheidet ja iiber 
die rein sachliche Differenz zwischen BewuBtsein und Nicht-BewuBtsein. 
Urn aber zu wissen, daB etwas - wie z.B. das materielle Ding, von dem 
ja Hussed expressis verbis dies behauptet - so wesensverschieden von 
dem BewuBtsein ist, daB es kein 'reelles Bestandstiick' von demselben 
ist und sein kann, muB man doch wissen, was dieses Etwas und insbe-
sondere welchen Wesens es ist. Wie kann man aber - von Husseds 
Standpunkt aus - so etwas wissen? Auf Grund der Erfahrung bzw. der 
Ergebnisse der positiven Wissenschaft. Ja, aber darauf konnte sich 
Hussed nur vor der Durchfiihrung der Reduktion berufen. Sobald aber 
die Reduktion durchgefiihrt wird, muB all dieses Wissen iiber das ontisch 
Transzendente 'eingeklammert' werden, man darf sich nicht darauf be-
rufen. Das Fundament der Scheidung zwischen BewuBtsein und Nicht-
BewuBtsein und damit mindestens der Grund der Reichweite der Re-
duktion ist hinfallig geworden. Man muB gewissermaBen alles aufs neue 
anfangen. Aber wie? Oder solI man das Wissen iiber das Wesen des 
Transzendenten auf dem ontologischen Wege gewinnen. Zuniichst 
scheint es, daB dem wirklich so ist, die Ontologie im Hussedschen Sinne 
sei dazu berufen, uns das apriorische Wissen iiber das Wesen (bzw. iiber 
die Idee) der Gegenstiinde zu lief em. Ja, aber die Ontologien verfallen 
doch auch der Reduktion, man darf sich also nach der Reduktion auf 
sie nicht berufen. Die Situation iindert sich also nicht im mindesten. Auf 
Grund der Einsicht in das Wesen eines Gegenstandes darf man also auf 
dem transzendental reduzierten Boden nicht behaupten, daB dieser Ge-
genstand dem BewuBtsein gegeniiber ontisch transzendent ist. Es muB 
also ein anderer Weg gesucht werden. Er er6ffnet sich - wie es scheint -
wenn man auf die Berufung auf das We sen (die Idee) dieses Gegenstandes 
verzichtet und sich nach der Weise seiner Gegebenheit in entsprechenden 
Edebnissen befragt. Dieser Weg schliigt Hussed tatsiichlich ein und er 
bringt ihn zu den von mir hier auseinandergesetzten erkenntnistheore-
tischen Begriffen der Transzendenz. Von da aus, durch die Analyse z.B. 
der iiuBeren Wahmehmung, kann man wissen, daB das physische Ding 
im erkenntnistheoretischen Sinne 'transzendent' ist, also mit seinen Be-
schaffenheiten iiber das in der jeweiligen Wahmehmung Gegebene hin-
ausreicht. Von da aus, wenn man schon weiB, was ein 'reelles Bestand-
stiick' des Erlebnisses bildet bzw. bilden kann, k6nnte man auch ent-

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
39 
scheiden, was - wenn es iiberhaupt existierte - kein 'reelles Bestandstiick' 
des Erlebnisses bilden kann. 
Nun, auf diese Weise wiirde es sich klaren, warum Husserl zwei Trans-
zendenzbegriffe verwendet und gewissermaBen zwischen ihnen schwankt. 
Das bedeutet noch nicht, daB auf dem neu eingeschlagenen Wege schon 
aIle Schwierigkeiten iiberwunden sind. Denn es gilt auch hier: man muB 
wissen, was zum We sen des reinen BewuBtsein gehort, urn die Reduktion 
richtig durchzufiihren, aber erst die Reduktion solI uns den erkenntnis-
maBigen Zugang zur Erfassung des reinen BewuBtseins seinem Wesen 
nach ermoglichen, sie kann uns erst zu entscheiden erlauben, was reelles 
Bestandstiick des reinen BewuBtseins ist, und was nicht, sie kann also 
erst die Entscheidung iiber die Reichweite ihrer selbst ermoglichen. 
MiiBte man nicht sagen, daB die Reduktion selbst sozusagen zuerst nur 
probeweise durchgefiihrt wird und erst im Laufe der Betrachtung nach-
kontrolliert wird und auch den Sinn und die Reichweite der Anwendung 
des Begriffes der ontischen Transzendenz festlegt? 
Sagen wir, daB der Begriff eines 'reellen Bestandstiickes' des reinen 
BewuBtseins festgelegt ist. 1st aber damit bereits entschieden, was denn 
ein solches 'Bestandstiick' des Erlebnisses jeweils bildet? Mit nichten. 
Denn erstjetzt steht vor mir die Frage: Was ist das, was in der immanen-
ten Wahmehmung erfaBbar ist? Was ist das wirklich immanent Ge-
gebene, und zwar so Gegebene, daB es sicher ist, daB es ein reelles Be-
standstiick meines momentanen Erlebnisses ist? Was gehort zu der Ein-
heit des Erlebnisses? Also das wahrgenommene Ding gehort nicht dazu 
- das ist transzendent, sagt Husserl. Und die Ansicht, die ich von dem 
Ding habe? Nun, die ist nicht physisch, - aber ist sie schon ipso facto 
ein Element des BewuBtseins? Die Ansicht, die ich habe, ist nicht das 
wahrgenommene physische Ding, sie ist das, was ich erlebe, wenn ich 
das betreffende Ding wahmehme; entscheidet dies aber, daB sie ein 
reelles Bestandstiick der Wahmehmung ist? Da sie in ihrem Gehalt Farb-
elemente enthalt, wiirde Brentano sie vielleicht 'ein physisches Phano-
men' nennen. Es ist bekannt, daB Farben nach Brentano 'physische 
Phanomene' und nicht 'psychische Phanomene' sind. Psychisch sind nur 
diese intentionalen (Intention habenden) Erlebnisse; dagegen physische 
Phanomene - das sind Farben, Tone usw. usw. Aber die physischen 
Phanomene sind doch nichts Physisches, nichts Materielles im Sinne der 
Physik, der N aturwissenschaft. Und das sagt Brentano. Er ist im Grunde, 

40 
ROMANINGARDEN 
sagen wir, kritiseher Realist. Dasjenige aber, was er 'Farbe' nennt, sind 
niehts anderes, als besondere, qualitative Momente, die in der Wahr-
nehmung als konkrete Bestimmtheiten (Eigensehaften) des wahrgenom-
menen farbigen Dinges, z.B. des weiBen Papiers oder des grauen Anzugs, 
gegeben sind. DaB es so etwas wie eine 'Ansieht' gibt, die sowohl von 
dem farbigen Ding, als von dem Akt des Sehens versehieden ist, weiB 
Brentano iiberhaupt nieht und es ist nieht sieher, ob er sie zu den 'phy-
sisehen' Phanomenen, oder zu dem Psyehisehen reehnen wiirde. Aber 
schon seine 'physisehen' Phanomene bilden sozusagen ein Zwischending 
zwischen dem realen und materiellen Ding und dem 'psyehisehen Pha-
nomen', die das Psyehisehe bilden. Warum wiirde aber Brentano iiber 
z.B. die visuellen Ansichten nicht sagen, daB sie 'psyehisehe Phanomene' 
sind? Weil sie keine 'intentionalen', eine Intention in sieh bergenden 
Phanomene sind. So werden aueh wir sagen miissen, eine Ansicht ist 
nieht 'BewuBtsein', nieht 'Erlebnis'. Husserl sagt zwar friiher 'Abschat-
tung ist Erlebnis' (ldeen 1), aber aueh er wiirde nieht sagen, 'Absehattung' 
sei ein 'intentionaler Akt'. Sie ist ein 'Erlebtes', sie wird von demjenigen, 
der einen Akt der Wahrnehmung vollzieht, 'erlebt'. Entscheidet dies 
aber, daB sie ein 'reelles Bestandstiiek' des Erlebnisses ist, oder daB sie 
die Grenze, die dureh 'reelle Bestandstiieke' des Erlebnisses gezogen 
sind, schon iibersehreitet ? 
Da muB ieh auf das hier schon friiher Besproehene zuriiekgreifen. 
Eine 'Ansicht von' hat in ihrem Untergrund eine Mannigfaltigkeit von 
Empfindungsdaten, die mit den qualitativen Bestimmungen des wahr-
genommenen Dinges nieht identiseh sind. Es sind ftieBende Daten, die 
ieh edebe, von denen ieh niehts weiB, wenn ieh Dinge sehe, aber die doch 
fiir mieh irgendwie da sind und die mich in meiner Verhaltensweise be-
stimmen, und die aueh bestimmen, was ieh eigentlich sehe und hore und 
wie ieh es sehe. Sie sind nieht physiseh, sind keine physisehen Realitaten. 
Hussed sagt von ihnen ganz deutlieh: Die jetzt von mir gehabten ftieBen-
den Sinnesdaten sind reelle Bestandstiieke des Erlebnisses. 
Nun, ieh habe sehr viele Stunden mit Hussed zusammen verbraeht, 
und ieh stellte immer wieder die Frage - 1st das wirklieh 'BewuBtsein' -
dieser rote Fleck da an der Peiipherie meines Bliekfeldes ? 1st das Erleb-
nis? Hat es eine leh-Struktur? 1st es Vollzug eines Aktes? 1st es ein 
Wissen von etwas? Hussed sagte mir: Eins kann ieh Ihnen zugeben: 
Das Empfindungsdatum ist nieht ieh-lich, es ist ieh-fremd. Ein Akt ist 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
41 
ich-lich. - Jemand hat mich verbessert, es sollte 'ich-haft' heiBen; aber 
'ich-lich' ist ein origineller Ausdruck Husserls. - Akt, BewuBtseinsakt, 
das Meinen, das Denken, das Wahmehmen - das alles quillt aus meinem 
Ich, und ich bin daran nicht nur beteiligt, sondem ich lebe damit, - ob-
wohl ich nicht mit dem Akte identisch bin. Aber der rote Fleck, an der 
Peripherie oder hier im Zentrum, alles, was sich im Blickfeld andert -
das ist etwas davon vollig Verschiedenes. Husserl hat das auch zugege-
ben: Sie sind ich-fremd und doch hat er weiter behauptet, sie sind Be-
standteile, reelle Bestandstiicke des BewuBtseins. Warum? Da sagte mir 
Husserl: Ja, den ken Sie, daB solche Flecke selbst sozusagen in der Welt 
spazieren? GewiB nicht! Daraus folgt aber nicht, daB sie mit einem Akt 
des Sehens oder Tastens so verbunden sein sollten, daB sie mit ihm 
ein Ganzes bilden und dessen ree11er Bestandteil sein wiirden? Oder 
anders gesagt: Sind die erlebten Empfindungsdaten, die ich irgend-
wie empfange und von denen ich - indem ich sie empfange - doch ein ge-
wisses Wissen habe - sind sie seinsunselbstandig in Bezug auf meinen 
Akt des Wahmehmens? Denn ich miiBte sagen: BewuBtseinsakte sind 
in Bezug auf die Empfindungsdaten nicht seinsunselbstandig. Ich kann 
Akte vollziehen ohne die Empfindungsdaten zu haben. Die Empfindungs-
daten andem sich auf verschiedene Weise, - trotzdem vollzieht sich der 
Wahrnehmungsakt als ein Ganzes fiir sich .... Oder ist es vielleicht um-
gekehrt? 1st es so, daB die Empfindungsdaten seinsunselbstandig sind, 
daB sie also nur dann existieren, wenn es ein erlebendes Ich gibt, wenn 
es ein Erleben von ihnen gibt? Das miisste jetzt nachgewiesen werden, 
es ist aber noch nicht nachgewiesen worden. Die Behauptung, daB sie 
'reelle Bestandstiicke' des BewuBtseins sind, wiirde entschieden werden, 
ohne daB man weiter gefragt hatte. 
Nach Husserl umfaBt das reine BewuBtsein Akte, Empfindungsdaten 
und auch die auf diesen Empfindungsdaten aufgebauten Sinneinheiten, 
das heiBt die 'Ansichten von'. Zwar gibt es, wie eine genauere Analyse 
zeigt, verschiedene Typen oder Stufen dieser Ansichten, die mehr oder 
weniger iiber die zugrundeliegenden Empfindungsdaten hinausgehen 
oder durch sie erfiillt werden. Schon im Jahre 1914 habe ich mit Husserl 
und unter Husserls EinfluB gesehen, daB es da viele 'Schichten' solcher 
immer hoher konstituierten Ansichten gibt. Die Tatbestande, die da vor-
liegen, sind sehr kompliziert und es ist unmoglich, sie hier zu entwickeln. 
Aber in Bezug auf aile konstitutiven Schichten der 'Ansichten' ist die-

42 
ROMANINGARDEN 
selbe Frage zu stellen, ob und inwiefem sie 'reelle Bestandstiicke' des 
BewuBtseins sind, und bei allen diesen Ansichtenschichten miiBte man 
diese Frage verneinen so lang nicht erwiesen ist, daB sie alle in Bezug auf 
das Erleben seinsunselbstandig sind; aber dies wurde bisher nicht er-
wiesen. 
SchlieBlich stoBen wir auf Folgendes: Das ist das vermeinte Ding, das 
erscheinende Ding, wenn man diese Ansichten erlebt - in natiirlicher 
Einstellung, nun, da ist z.B. diese Uhr, sie zeigt halb acht, sie ist ein 
physisches Ding, ein Werkzeug. Undjetzt fiihre ich die Reduktion durch. 
Dann bleibt diese Uhr, diese reale Uhr, weiter im Blickfeld, obwohl ich 
die Reduktion vollzogen habe. Husserl sagt, es bleibt alles, wie es war, 
es flillt nichts fort. Aber das Ding selbst habe ich reduziert, darf dariiber 
nichts aussagen. Was bleibt, was mir noch zuganglich ist; ist das Phiino-
men der Uhr, und zwar Phanomen nicht im Sinne dieser oder jener An-
sicht, sondem der Sinn dieser anschaulich bzw. wahmehmungsmaBig 
vermeinten Uhr, derselben Uhr, die ich seit 20 lahren trage. Das ist der 
aus einer groBen Mannigfaltigkeit von Erfahrungen, die ich auf Grund 
dieser Uhr gehabt habe, irgendwie resultierende Sinn, der vermeint wird, 
und der dem Realen zugeschrieben wird, auf dieses Reale aufgelegt wird, 
das angeblich existiert bzw. als existierend sich mir gibt. Ob es wirklich 
existiert, weiB ich zunachst nicht, - das darf ich auch nicht sagen, vor 
allem da ich die phanomenologische Reduktion durchgefiihrt habe. Aber 
eins weiB ich: So ein Vermeintes habe ich - 'Vermeintes', das ist nicht 
selbst real, sondem nur als real vermeint, das Vermeinte, das ist das, was 
HusserI das Ding-Noema nennt, das ist 'Ding im Anfiihrungszeichen', 
wie Husserl sagt, - das ist das Cog ita tum als solches, vermoge welches 
ich mit der realen Welt zu tun habe. Das Cogitatum, sagt HusserI ganz 
ausdriicklich, ist unabtrennbar von meinem Erleben, insbesondere von 
meinem Wahmehmen, von der ganzen Mannigfaltigkeit, in der es sich 
konstituiert hat. Das Cogitatum bildet irgendeine Einheit mit dem Cogi-
tare, - zwar nicht diejenige Einheit, die zwischen Akten -und Akten be-
steht - und auch nicht diejenige Einheit, die nach HusserI angeblich 
zwischen Ich und den Empfindungsdaten, Ich und den Ansichten besteht. 
Es ist transzendent, es ist kein Stiick von mir, - und doch als Sinn ist 
es in gewissem Sinne auch Teil von dem ganzen Erleben. Es gehort dazu, 
sagt man. Wenn man nun dem nachgeht, wie ein bestimmtes Cogitatum 
im FluB des BewuBtseinsstroms sich konstituiert, also wenn man von 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
43 
der Geschichte der Erkenntnis dieser Uhr eine Erfahrung macht, dann 
sieht man, daB dieses Vermeinte, dieser doch gegenstiindliche Sinn dieser 
Uhr sich stiindig in gewissem Sinne wandelt. Je reicher meine Erkenntnis 
ist, desto mehr bereichert sich und wandelt sich der Sinn des vermeinten 
Gegenstandes. Diese 'Sinne', die gegenstiindlichen Sinne, die noema-
tischen Sinne, - das sind doch Bildungen meiner Erfahrung. Sie sind 
empfindlich in Bezug auf das, was ich gerade erlebe und wie ich da dabei 
denke und schlieBe, welche Analysen und welche syntetischen Bildungen 
dabei entstehen. Der noematische Sinn ist von mir in hohem MaBe ab-
hiingig: Je nachdem, wie ich erfahre, wie ich dariiber meine, modifiziert 
sich das Vermeinte, obwohl es vor allem davon abhiingig ist, welche 
Mannigfaltigkeiten von Empfindungsdaten mich bedriingen und wie sie 
aufeinanderfolgen. Dem gegeniiber scheinen die physischen Dinge selbst 
von mir, von meinem bewuBtseinsmiiBigen Verhalten, unabhiingig zu 
sein *. 
Alles zusammen genommen, also: der intentionale Akt, die Emp-
findungsdaten, die sich darauf aufbauenden Ansichten (Abschattungen) 
verschiedener Stufen und die gegenstiindlichen Sinne (das Ding-Noema) 
- all das gehort zum reinen BewuBtsein, und gehort zu dem Residuum, 
das erhalten bleibt, wenn wir die Reduktion durchgefiihrt haben. 
Sie sehen, im Laufe der Entwicklung der Husserlschen Phiinomeno-
logie wandelt sich der Sinn des BewuBtseins. Denn zuniichst, als Husserl 
sozusagen noch Schiiler von Brentano war, - und das war er noch in den 
Logischen Untersuchungen - war fiir ihn 'BewuBtsein' natiirlich das 
psychische Phiinomen, - das war also das, was Intention in sich enthiilt, 
was somit in dies em Sinne 'intentional' ist. Das andere war 'physisches 
Phiinomen'. - Dann ist aber etwas geschehen, was Husserl zur Anderung 
des BewuBtseinsbegriffes gebracht hat. Und zwar sicher war es vor den 
Ideen, vor dem Jahre 1913, wahrscheinlich niimlich in den Jahren 1905-
1908, als Husserl die groBen Analysen der Wahrnehmung, der wahrge-
nommenen Zeit und des wahrgenommenen Raumes durchfiihrte. Da hat 
sich der Begriff des BewuBtseins gewandelt und umfaBt in der Folge fast 
alles, woriiber gesprochen werden darf, auch das, was angeblich ontisch 
transzendent ist; denn das Cogitatum ist doch nicht 'immanent', aber 
* Wie darf ich aber nach Vollzug der phanomenologischen Reduktion noch zwischen 
'Ding-Noema' (noematischem Sinn), also dem Cogitatum, und dem 'Ding selbst' unter-
scheiden? 

44 
ROMANINGARDEN 
es gehort nach HusserI irgendwie notwendig zu der Ganzheit des Er-
lebnisses. HusserI sagt: NatiirIich, zwischen Cogitatum und Cogitatio 
besteht eine andere Einheit, als diejenige zwischen Akt und Akt, es 
ist aber doch eine Einheit. Wenn wir iiber dieses so mannigfache und 
in seinem Aufbau komplizierte Feld des reinen BewuBtseins, das sich 
als das Residuum nach dem Vollzug der phanomenologischen Reduk-
tion ergab, nachdenken, so rallt uns ein, daB da ein vollig anderes Prin-
zip der Abgrenzung dessen, was das reine BewuBtsein ist, auftaucht, 
als es dasjenige war, das vor der Reduktion zur Abgrenzung zwischen 
BewuBtsein und Nicht-BewuBtsein diente. Denn friiher war das die 
ontische Transzendenz im Gegensatz zur Immanenz. Was ontisch 
transzendent war, gehorte nicht zum BewuBtsein und verfiel der Reduk-
tion. Und jetzt wird nicht nach dem, was ontisch 'transzendent' oder 
nicht-transzendent ist *, gefragt, sondem nach dem, was noch mit dem 
BewuBtseinsakt in einer Einheit besteht. Dabei werden noch verschiedene 
derartige 'Einheiten' einander gegeniibergestellt, obwohl keine von ihnen 
von HusserI befriedigend geklart und prazisiert wurde. Und gerade das 
Auftauchen dieses neuen Abgrenzungsprinzips und die dabei belassenen 
Elemente analysieren, die auf dem BewuBtseinsfelde auftreten, Akte, 
Erlebnisse, Empfindungsdaten und -felder, Ansichten verschiedener 
Unklarheiten machen uns stutzig und erschweren es uns, eine Stellung 
dieser Auffassung des reinen BewuBtseins gegeniiber einzunehmen. 
Wir miissen aber zunachst zur Kenntnis nehmen, daB uns ein solches 
Residuum bleibt, also nach Vollzug der phanomenologischen Reduk-
tion erhalten ist. Und jetzt - sagt uns Husserl - sollen wir da die 
Stufe, gegenstandliche Sinne usw. Das also miissen wir analysieren, und 
dann die Zusammenhange sowie die Abhangigkeiten finden und u.a. da-
nach fragen, nach welchem Verlauf von Akten, Empfindungsdaten und 
Ansichten sich so ein gegenstandlicher Sinn aufbaut ('konstituiert'). 
Weiter miissen wir nachforschen: Geschieht das alles vemunftmaBig, 
* Man miiBte vielleicht behaupten, daB jede obere konstitutive Schicht der jeweils niederer 
Schicht gegeniiber (ein wahrgenommener Gegenstand als so1cher (Ding) im Gegensatz zu 
der Mannigfaltigkeit der Ansichten, eine Ansicht im Gegensatz zu der zugrundeliegenden 
Mannigfaltigkeit der Empfindungsdaten) transzendent ist und zwar im ontischen Sinne. 
Diese Transzendenz muB anerkannt werden, da man sonst zugeben miiBte, daB im Bereich 
des - soweit verstandenen - 'BewuBtseins' lauter Widerspriiche effektiv bestehen (wie 
das z.B. Hegel behauptet hat, der iiber den Begriff der ontischen Transzendenz nicht 
verfiigt). 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
45 
rechtmiiBig? Da eroffnen sich die - so von Hussed in den Ideen I ge-
nannten - 'Rechtsfragen' der Konstitution. Konstitutionsprozesse sind 
- wiirde Hussed sagen - keine rein mechanischen oder kausalen Vor-
giinge, es herrscht iiberall Sinn, vemiinftige Motivierung oder auch 
Widerstreit, iibera11 Nachdenken, iibera11 Erwiigen usw. Es muB gezeigt 
werden, wann alle diese Operationen vemiinftig sind und zu einem po-
sitiven giiltigen Ergebnis fUhren. Zu diesem Zwecke brauchen wir nicht 
die reale Welt, die Physik zu verwenden. Hier, auf dem Felde des reinen 
BewuBtseins, haben wir alles, was wir notig haben. 
Ich versuche darzulegen, wie Hussed das sah und wie er das auch be-
hauptete. Ich darf aber nicht verschweigen, daB in mir die Frage ent-
steht, ob es wirklich so ist, daB da alles so zusammenhiingt und eine 
Ganzheit bildet. Ich weiB: Wenn ich sage: Dinge sind keine Ansichten, 
Dingansichten, materielle Dinge sind keine Empfindungsdaten und sind 
nicht Akte, nicht Bestandteile, reelle Stucke der Akte, der Edebnisse 
selbst, sondem sie sind 'ich-fremd', - dann habe ich groBe Schwierig-
keiten, was ich mit all dem machen sol1. Alles Physikalische ist schon 
'drauBen', und damit beschiiftigt sich die Physik usw. Die Aufgabe der 
Phiinomenologie besteht darin, die Akte se1bst zu analysieren. Da kann 
ich nun entscheiden: 1st das absolute Realitiit, absolutes Sein - oder 
nicht? Was solI ich aber mit den Ansichten machen? Was sol1 ich mit 
den gegenstiindlichen Sinnen machen? Das ist, meiner Ansicht nach, 
kein BewuBtsein. BewuBtsein in meiner Analyse ist nur das AktmiiBige 
und das Ich; es ist bewuBt dadurch, daB es aktmiiBig durchlebt wird. 
Aber die Farbenflecke, die Ansichten von Dingen, der verrneinte Sinn? 
- Die Frage geht sehr weit. Die Begriffe sind auch 'Sinne' und Siitze 
und ganze Theorien sind ebenfa11s 'Sinne'. - Nun, wenn ich sage, daB 
das a11es 'BewuBtsein' ist, dann komme ich auf den psychologistischen 
Standpunkt zurUck. Aber was solI ich damit machen? 1st das ein selb-
stiindiges Sein, unabhiingig von mir und von der realen Welt? Oder ist 
es ein Ergebnis einer Konfrontation zwischen zwei Realitiiten, zwischen 
mir und der realen Welt? So wie ich das z.B. beim literarischen Kunst-
werk sage, beim Bild: Physisches Fundament existiert fUr sich, von mir, 
von meinen Edebnissen seinsunabhiingig. Dagegen das Bild, das 
sich auf diesem Fundament aufbaut, braucht zu seiner Existenz zwei 
seinsautonome Gegenstiindlichkeiten: das physische Fundament und 
mich, den Betrachter, - sonst ist es nicht faBbar, es ist in seinem Sein 

46 
ROMANINGARDEN 
irgendwie auf mich und auf das Reale relativ. 1st es nicht ebenso mit 
dem noematischen gegenstandlichen Sinn? 
Es ist sehr schwierig, dies weiter darzulegen und zu begriinden. Aber 
das ist die andere Losung, wo ich kein Idealist bin und doch fast aIle 
positiven Analysen von Husserl annehme. - Nur, daB ich hier und dort 
manche neue Fragen stelle, in der Hoffnung, daB dies oder jenes doch 
irgendwie geandert werde. Aber es gibt natiirlich Akte, es gibt Empfin-
dungsdaten, es gibt Ansichten, es gibt Sinne, gegenstandliche Sinne, und 
es gibt Gegenstande, d.h. besser Dinge, es gibt Realitaten. Vnd aus 
diesem Ganzen muB der ganze ProzeB des Erkennens herausgearbeitet 
werden, und zwar ohne die Berufung auf die Realitiit. 
9. Vorlesung 
10 November 1967 
Die Zeit, die ich noch habe, d.h. heute und das nachste Mal, mochte ich 
noch zwei Problemen widmen, namlich einer Reihe von Fragen, even-
tuell Vorwiirfen irn Zusammenhang mit der transzendentalen Reduktion 
bei Husserl, und dann der Konsequenz, d.h. dem transzendentalen 
Idealismus in der Gestalt, wie er sich uns in den Ideen von Husserl dar-
stellt. Ich werde mich auf Darstellung und deren Ausdeutung beschran-
ken - hochstens noch einige Fragezeichen dem Ergebnis hinzufiigen. 
Heute werde ich mit den Bemerkungen zu dem Idealismus vielleicht nur 
anfangen. Dagegen mochte ich fiir die Reduktion noch etwas mehr Zeit 
haben. 
Die erste Frage ist: Was hat Husserl erhofft, verrnoge der Reduktion 
zu erreichen? Und die zweite Frage, die damit irn Zusammenhang steht: 
Was leistet die transzendentale Reduktion? Hat sie die Hoffnung von 
Husser! erfiillt, und kann sie sie iiberhaupt erfiiIlen? Urn es gleich zu 
sagen: Es scheint, daB die Reduktion in der Gestalt, in welcher sie in 
den Ideen I dargestellt wurde, nicht zu dem Zwecke ausreicht, zu dem 
sie dienen sollte. Es ist nicht verwunderlich, daB Husserl spater mehr-
mals versuchte, die Reduktion aufs neue anzugreifen, urn sie irgendwie 
besser oder ausfiihrlicher darzusteIlen, weil er doch zu der Uberzeugung 
gekommen war, daB in der ganzen Darstellung noch etwas erganzungs-
bediirftig war. Freilich das, was mir ein gewisses Manko zu sein scheint 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
47 
- praktisch freilich nicht, aber theoretisch - das hat er spater doch nicht 
mehr beriihrt. 
Also was hat HusserI erhofft? Das ist kurz gesagt: Entdeckung, Ent-
hiiIlung - urn es Heideggerisch zu sagen - des transzendentalen reinen 
BewuBtseins, - und zwar zunachst des BewuBtseins im Sinne des inten-
tionalen Aktes, des ErIebnisses. Nach HusserIs Auffassung geht aber 
dieser Akt mit einer Mannigfaltigkeit von Empfindungsdaten oder - wie 
er sich auch ausdriickte - hyletischen Daten zusammen und bildet mit 
ihnen eine gewisse Einheit. So sollen auch diese Daten vermoge der 
Reduktion zur Entdeckung gebracht werden. Aber das ist nicht alles, 
was entdeckt werden solI. Denn es kommt noch etwas hinzu, was ich 
friiher erwahnt habe, und zwar das sogenannte Cog ita tum oder das 
Noema, oder das Vermeinte, - wie es vermeint ist, das soU auch entdeckt 
werden. Am Hintergrund der Mannigfaltigkeiten von ErIebnissen, Emp-
findungsdaten, Ansichten bzw. Abschattungen solI entdeckt werden, was 
das Letzte ist, das Vermeinte als solches. Das solI also verrnoge lediglich 
jener sogenannten Ausschaltung oder Einklammerung, oder eines Sich-
nicht-Solidarisierens mit dem VoIlzug der Generalthesis entdeckt werden. 
Nicht mehr solI gemacht werden, - bloB dieses. Beim VoIlzug der Ge-
neralthesis in Bezug auf die auBere Welt solI noch etwas geleistet werden 
oder nicht geleistet werden: Das ist dieses Sich-Zuriickziehen, dieses 
Sich-irgendwie-Distanzieren von dieser Thesis selbst, - aber sie solI doch 
da sein. 
Dieses 'Vermeinte' - das muss man beachten - ist etwas, wovon Hus-
serI sagt, es sei unzertrennlich von dem Akt und eventuell von den Emp-
findungsdaten. Es ist nichts separat fUr sich Existierendes, obwohl es -
und das ist jetzt die Frage - doch dem Akte selbst und den Empfindungs-
daten transzendent ist. Dies ist sehr geHihrIich zu sagen. Transzendent 
ist zunachst das wahrgenommene Ding, also das als Raumliches, Phy-
sisches usw. Gegebene. Wenn ich nun die Reduktion durchfUhre, bleibt 
alles anscheinend als dasselbe we iter bestehen, und doch ist es schon 
Noema. Was ist eigentlich transzendent? Das Ding selbst? Ja. Und das 
Noema - das Verrneinte als solches? Danach ist jetzt zu fragen, das ist 
noch zu erwagen. Aber jedenfalls ist es etwas irgendwie im Verhaltnis 
zu dem Akt selbst und zu den Empfindungsdaten, und auch zu den Ab-
schattungen durchaus Neues, - das Vermeinte als solches. 
Es ist eine merkwiirdige Auffassung dieser ganzen Situation. Denn 

48 
ROMANINGARDEN 
zunachst scheint es, daB es zwei verschiedene Seinsgebiete gibt: Das eine 
ist die reale Welt, dem BewuBtsein iiberhaupt transzendent und das An-
dere, das reine BewuBtsein. Dann wird das eingeklammert, die transzen-
dente Welt ist irgendwie als nicht vorhanden zu rechnen, und doch irgend-
wie mitzunehmen. Es bleibt doch eine Dualitat in dem, was noch geblie-
ben ist, eine ganz besondere Art Dualismus, und zwar Dualismus in einer 
Einheit zugleich, weil man sagt: Zu jedem Akte gehort das Noema, und 
das Noema bzw. das Vermeinte, das Cogitatum, ist von dem Akt nicht 
abzutrennen. Und dann wird das alles so gemacht, daB es doch zu einer 
Gestalt von Monismus kommt - trotz des Dualismus, trotz der Trans-
zendenz, und zwar der Moglichkeit von zwei Transzendenzen, des Dinges 
selbst und des vermeinten Dinges - des Dinges 'im Anfiihrungszeichen', 
wie Hussed auch sagt, d.h. des Vermeinten. 
Was kann aber diese Reduktion wirklich leisten? Die Reduktion - das 
ist nichts anderes als eine gewisse - urn es lateinisch zu sagen - reservatio 
mentis in Bezug auf die Existenz und das Sosein, wie das auch manche 
sagen, des zur Welt Gehorenden, insbesondere des realen Dinges. SolI 
das jedoch schon ausreichen, urn etwas zu entdecken? Die Akte, die Er-
lebnisse, die irgendwie mit diesen Akten verbundenen Empfindungs-
daten? Ja, gemaB der alten Tradition, die auch fiir Hussed gar nicht 
fremd ist, - war nicht sein geistiger Vater Franz Brentano? Brentano 
wiirde sagen: Was solI da entdeckt werden? Zunachst sollen die psychi-
schen Phanomene entdeckt werden. Was braucht man dazu, urn das zu 
entdecken? Ja, die ganz gewohnliche Reflexion muB man haben. Das 
aber ist etwas mehr und etwas anderes als lediglich die 'Reduktion'. Also 
abgesehen von der Reduktion muB noch etwas Neues, namlich das Re-
flektieren, anders gesagt die immanente Wahmehmung, vollzogen wer-
den, - sie selbst ist durch den Vollzug der Reduktion allein noch nicht 
da. In diesem Sinne zeigt es sich, daB das Wichtigste, was da zu ent-
decken ist, mittels der Reduktion nicht entdeckbar ist. Man muB einen 
wirklich neuen Akt vollziehen, nicht nur den schon bestehenden redu-
zieren. Wir miissen also dann die immanente Wahmehmung vollziehen; 
selbstverstandlich, wiirde HusserI sagen, miissen wir das tun. Ich habe 
diese Frage einst in Royanmont gestellt - das war 1957, so ein kleiner 
KongreB der Phanomenologen - und da sagte man mir damals: Nun ja, 
Hussed dachte, daB natiidich das eine mit dem anderen zusammengeht, 
es ist ganz natiirIich, daB wir da diese Reflexion vollziehen. Vie11eicht

49 
aber ist es doch nicht das Ergebnis der Reduktion selbst. Reicht aber 
wiederum die Reflexion dazu aus, wn die reinen Erlebnisse wahrzuneh-
men, zu erfassen? Nein, dazu reicht sie nicht aus, da braucht man auch 
die Reduktion. Denn wenn man nur reflektiert, so wie ich hier jetzt tue, 
wenn ich auf meinen Gedanken reflektiere, - so ist das Gegebene in 
dieser Reflexion mein psychisches Verhalten, ich selbst als ein Mensch; 
psychisches Verhalten, d.h. meine BewuBtseinsverUiufe, die bei der nor-
malen Auffassung Phanomene sind, aber zugleich Symptome meiner 
Seele, meines Geistes und auch meines Leibes natiirlich, - sie sind Symp-
tome von etwas, was in mir als in einem Ganzen passiert, und als solche 
sind sie doch irgendwelche Elemente des realen Menschen und des wei-
teren der realen Welt. 
Die normale tagliche Reflexion bringt mich nicht von selbst zwn reinen 
BewuBtsein, zu meinem reinen Erlebnis. Ich muB die Reduktion zu Hilfe 
nehmen. Da meint Husserl: Wenn ich einmal die ganze reale Welt re-
duziert habe, und ich als Mensch mit meinen psychischen Tatsachen zu-
sammen zu dieser Welt gehore, dann geniigt schon diese Reduktion, daB 
ich nicht nur die auBeren Dinge als das Vermeinte nehme, sondem auch 
mich selbst mit meinen Erlebnissen, also mit Erlebnissen als Symptome 
von meinem Selbst. Aber das wird dann so gesagt: Ich als Mensch mit 
meinen psychischen Tatsachen, mit meinen physiologischen Tatsachen, 
mit meinen Beziehungen zu der auBeren Welt, also kausalen Beziehungen 
- das ist alles 'im Anfiihrungszeichen', das ist das Vermeinte. Schon. 
Aber nun solI ich in dem Vermeinten oder aus dem Vermeinten irgend-
wie das reine Erlebnis von mir selbst herausfassen, das reine BewuBtsein 
aus diesen - wie HusserI sagt - 'Auffassungen' sozusagen herausschalen, 
wobei nicht unbeachtet bleiben darf, daB dieses Erlebnis gerade Symp-
tom meiner psycho-physischen Situation ist. Da geniigt es wiederum 
nicht zu sagen, daB ich Mensch bin und daB meine Erlebnisse Symptome 
meiner psycho-physischen Organisation sind. Es geniigt nicht zu sagen: 
Es wird reduziert. Es mull dieser Charakter der Realitat und der Charak-
ter des Hineingehorens in eine konkrete Welt, der Verflechtung in aIle 
moglichen, verschiedenen kausalen Beziehungen, in denen ich gerade 
stehe, und endlich das Geprage der 'Menschlichkeit' meiner Erlebnisse 
von der 'BewuBtmaBigkeit' dieser Erlebnisse abgehoben werden, damit 
das BewuBtsein aus allen diesen Charakteren 'abgeschalt', 'gereinigt' 
werde. Es geniigt nicht, Distanz davon zu nehmen. 

50 
ROMANINGARDEN 
Husserl sagt an einer Stelle, daB all dies schon nicht immanent ist -
dieser Realitatscharakter, dieses als realer Vorgang in die ganze Welt 
Verwoben-Sein. Sobald ich mich also auf das Immanente konzentriere, 
faIlt das Nicht-immanente fort. Geniigt aber die Reduktion, daB es dann 
von selbst zu der Konzentration auf das Immanente kommt? Ich muB 
doch irgendwie das Immanente vom Nicht-immanenten unterscheiden 
kannen. - Ja, wie solI ich wissen, was ich da tun solI? Von selbst fallen 
jene Charaktere gar nicht ab, sondern ich muB das reine BewuBtsein von 
ihnen abschalen, sie von ihm irgendwie abnehmen oder entwerten. Da 
hilft weder die Reflexion - denn die Reflexion nimmt natiirlich alles mit 
- noch die Reduktion, wei! ich ihr zufolge nur weiB, das Reale sei nur 
als das Vermeinte zu nehmen, es sei irgendwie in Frage zu stellen. Es 
miissen also verschiedene Charaktere*, die bloBen Realisierungscharak-
tere, aber auch der Charakter des sen, daB das Erlebnis Element eines 
realen Menschen, Symptom von Vorgangen ist, die in dessen Gehirn 
geschehen, irgendwie beseitigt oder sozusagen entkraftet werden. Wie 
solI man das aber machen? Diese Aufgabe bereitet 'gewisse Schwierig-
keiten fiir Leute, die in die Phanomenologie hereinkommen wollen. Ich 
kann das gut verstehen. Nach meiner Habilitation kam ich nach Lem-
berg, wo Twardowski der Meister war. Er war Brentanist, sein ganzes 
Leben lang war er im Grunde deskriptiver Psychologe, obwohl er sich 
fUr einen Philosophen hielt. Seine Schiiler haben mich damals immer 
gefragt: Nun, was ist das 'reine BewuBtsein'? 1st es dasselbe, wie mein 
individuelles psychisches BewuBtsein - oder ist es ein anderes BewuBt-
sein ? - Da ist man versucht, den Leuten zu sagen, es sei dasselbe, nur 
sei es irgendwie mit einer Menge von Charakteren umkleidet. Nach den 
Texten in den Ideen scheint es, daB dies bei Husserl auch so gedacht wird, 
daB das originelle reine BewuBtsein durch gewisse Auffassungen sozu-
sagen beschattet wird, die fortfallen sollen, sobald man die Reduktion 
gemacht hat. 
Damals war ich iiberzeugt, daB es so bei Husserl tatsachlich ist, daB 
immer derselbe Kern, ein BewuBtseinskern, da ist und daB an ihm nur 
diese verschiedenen Charaktere, wie gewisse Schalen auftreten. Aber 
* Husser! verwendet den Ausdruck 'Auffassung'. Dieses Wort priijudiziert aber, daB die 
Quelle dieser 'Auffassung' irn transzendentalen Subjekt liegt, was auf dieser Stufe der 
Betrachtung nicht einmal suggeriert werden darf. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
51 
doch gibt es spater, nach den Ideen, bei Hussed manche Stellen, die das 
in Frage stellen, als ob dieses reine BewuBtsein doch als BewuBtsein et-
was ganz anderes ware, als nur das gereinigte psychische BewuBtsein. Es 
gibt solche Stellen in der Krisis und auch in manchen nach dem Kriege 
publizierten Schriften Husseds. Das ist aber nicht ganz klar. Insbeson-
dere, wenn ich z.B. hore, daB der Strom des reinen BewuBtseins doppel-
seitig unendlich ist, und daB sozusagen im Verlaufe dieses Stroms Kon-
tinuitat besteht. In Bezug auf mein psychisches BewuBtsein ist das nicht 
wahr. Ich schlafe jeden Abend ein und wenn ich ganz gut schlafe, habe 
ich gar kein BewuBtsein. Ich schlafe einfach, ich traume nicht. Es gibt 
da also sHindig, jeden Tag oder jede Nacht, Unterbrechungen. Auch 
wenn ich nachmittags etwas miide bin, schlafe ich wiederum ein. Manch-
mal kann es auch passieren, daB ich wahrend der Stunde, in der ich vor-
trage, schlafe. Wenn es z.B. halb drei nachmittags ist, kann ich wahrend 
eines Gespraches einschlafen. 
Und dann, wie kann ich sagen, daB ich ein sich nach riickwarts un-
endlich erstreckendes BewuBtsein habe. Ja, ich kann sehr weit zuriick-
reichen, aber dann verschwimmt alles, wird ausgeloscht. Bis zu meinem 
zweiten Lebensjahr kann ich zuriickkehren, aber we iter zuriick weiB ich 
unmittelbar aus meinem Leben nichts, was ich weiB, ist nur Ubediefe-
rung. Es gab das Jahr 1893, in dem ich geboren wurde, sagt man mir; 
friiher gab es irgendeine Zeit, eine Welt, aber das ist fUr mich bloB Ge-
danke, edernte Geschichte, das ist kein Edebnis. Was aber vor mir in 
der Zeit liegt, das ist ganz unklar, gliicklicherweise oder ungliicklicher-
weise. Kann ich diese Unendlichkeit der Zeit annehmen - wie Hussed 
behauptet - und zwar die Unendlichkeit der edebten Zeit, nicht der be-
rechneten Zeit oder der astronomischen Zeit, oder auch der historischen 
Zeit. 
Wenn man dies nicht konstruiert, sondern vermutet, daB bei Hussed 
irgendwelche Intuitionen zugrunde lagen, dann, glaube ich, muB man 
die Sache ganz anders stellen und fragen: 1st dieses reine BewuBtsein 
wirklich mit meinem psychischen BewuBtsein identisch? Bestreitet man 
diese Identitat, so kommt man in Schwierigkeiten mit der Reduktion 
und der Reflexion, in wie weit sie es namlich vermogen, uns zu diesem 
anderen BewuBtsein zu iiberfUhren. 
Etwas anderes wird nun in Betracht gezogen, was meiner Ansicht nach, 
Hussed mittels der Reduktion zu entdecken gelungen ist. Das ist namlich 

52 
ROMANINGARDEN 
das Folgende: Sobald ich die Reduktion in Bezug auf die,Umwelt von 
mir, auf die reale Welt, auf die Generalthesis der Welt durchfiihre, bringe 
ich mir zum ersten Mal zurn BewuBtsein, daB ich nicht schlechthin mit 
Dingen zu tun habe, die ich wahrnehme, sondern, daB ich mit Dingen 
zu tun habe, die durch 'Abschattungen' erscheinen, welche ich mir 'nach 
Vollzug der Reduktion' zurn BewuBtsein bringe, obwohl die Abschat-
tungen nicht das Ding selbst sind. 
Eines wird sicher auf diesem Wege ermoglicht: Das ist der Ubergang 
vom Ding zurn Vermeinten, zurn vermeinten Ding, vom Ding zurn Ding-
sinn, Dingnoema. Ich nehme diesen Tisch wahr, ich bin in einer normalen 
Situation, so wie ich in der natiirlichen Einstellung lebe, habe ich mit 
Dingen zu tun, die mir direkt gegeben, selbst gegeben sind, obwohl ver-
mittels der Abschattungen, wie Husserl sagt, der Ansichten. Moge fol-
gende Wendung erlaubt sein: Yom intentionalen Objekt meiner Wahr-
nehmung weiB ich in natiirlicher Einstellung nichts, es ist mir nicht zu-
ganglich. Wenn ich sage: Ich sehe diesen Saal, ich sehe da meine Be-
kannten und ich ziehe mich dann von der Generalthesis irgendwie zuriick, 
dann kann ich auch sagen: Ich weill nicht, ob das, was ich da sehe, Wirk-
lichkeit ist. Aber eins weill ich doch, daB sich mir etwas als Wirklichkeit 
phanomenal zeigt. Dieses Sich-phanomenal-Zeigen dessen, was da ist, 
entdecke ich vermittels der Reduktion. Ich konnte dies vielleicht auch 
ohne besondere Methode erlangen, aber wenn man es methodisch er-
fassen will, und das mochte Husserl eben erreichen, so muB diese Ope-
ration durchgefiihrt werden, die er transzendentale Reduktion nennt. 
Da wird es wirklich enthiillt, wir werden darauf aufmerksam, daB es so 
etwas wie Erscheinung von etwas, eine Ansicht von etwas gibt, und zwar 
nicht nur in einem Zeitmoment, sondern auch in der Wandlung. Wenn 
ich z.B. diesen Saal sehe und sehe, es ist derselbe Saal, den ich vor einer 
W oehe gesehen habe, oder in dem ich vor einem Jahr auch Vortrage 
gehalten habe, - dann ziehe ich mich auf die Position der Reduktion 
zuriick, und bringe mir zurn BewuBtsein, wie sich der Sinn dieses Saales 
langsam wandelt. Sagen wir, er hat jetzt fiir mich die sogenannte 'Be-
kanntheitsqualitat' an sich, friiher hatte er das nicht. Als ich hier vor 
einem Jahr zurn ersten Mal einen Vortrag hielt, geschah es am Tage, urn 
11 Uhr vormittags, und ich war fest iiberzeugt, daB das Licht durch 
dieses Fenster fiel. DaB der Saal auch elektrisch beleuchtet war, merkte 
ich gar nicht. Der Saal hatte damals einen ganz anderen Sinn fiir mich 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
53 
als jetzt. Ich hatte z.B. nieht gesehen, daB da rote Wande sind und daB 
diese Ziegel aus der Mauer heraustreten. Denn ich war auf das Thema 
konzentriert, das ieh vorzutragen hatte, und ich war in einer ganz fremden 
Gesellschaft, so daB ich den Saal selbst nieht sah. Also Sie sehen, der 
Sinn dessen, was ich gesehen habe, wandelt sich im Laufe meiner 
Erfahrung. Und zwar ist diese Wandlung des Sinnes in jeder neuen 
Phase der Wahrnehmung eine andere Wandlung, als die Wandlung 
der Dinge, die da sind, - ihre physische Wandlung ist etwas vollig an-
deres. 
Auf diesem Wege also, sobald ich die Reduktion vollzogen habe, ent-
decke ich nicht nur das Vermeinte als solches, sondern auch besondere, 
eigentumliche, neue, nicht in der realen Welt sich abspielende Vorgange, 
Verwandlungen des Sinnes, des Vermeinten als solchen. Da gebe ich also 
zu, daB hier die Reduktion wirklieh leistungsHihig ist, daB sie mir dieses 
Gebiet entdeckt, - das Gebiet dessen, was einst Brentano 'physische 
Phanomene' nannte, obwohl es nicht nur physische Phanomene sind, 
denn es sind auBerdem - ich nehme ja meine Bekannten wahr, ich lebe 
mit ihnen zusammen - auch fremde psychische Phanomene vorhanden. 
Damit war bei Brentano die Sache schon beendigt, und er sagte im Geiste 
des kritischen Realismus: Das Wirkliche - das sind die physischen 
Dinge; und die physischen Phanomene - das sind Illusionen, das sind 
Phantome in gewissem Sinne. Und Hussed sagte: Ja, ja, das sind eben 
die Phantome, mit denen wir uns beschaftigen mussen, damit wir erfah-
ren konnen, wie aus diesen Phantomen sich hier der Sinn der Welt, der 
Sinn der realen Welt ergibt, wie ich da zu dieser Welt einen Zugang 
gewinne. 
Ich bekomme also infolge der Reduktion ein reiches Material von 
Phanomenen, von sehr komplizierten, oft zusammengewachsenen Pha-
nomenen, aus denen ich alles herauslesen und sie analysieren muB. Mag 
das erst einmal getan sein. Hussed hat uns den Weg gewiesen - ich glaube 
in einer Weise, wie niemand sonst in der Philo sophie - er hat gezeigt, 
wie der Sinn des Vermeinten, das Vermeinte, das Ding 'im AnfUhrungs-
zeiehen', wie er sagt, sich selbst in den Mannigfaltigkeiten von Abschat-
tungen prasentiert, in den Mannigfaltigkeiten von Ansichten, wie ich 
lieber sagen mochte. Hussed hat, meiner Ansicht nach, als erster diese 
Abschattungen, diese Ansichten in ihrer Mannigfaltigkeit wirklich analy-
siert, so daB wir nicht mehr im Dunkeln wandeln; wir wissen den Weg 

54 
ROMANINGARDEN 
zu verfolgen, bis zu den Empfindungsdaten, zu den 'hyletischen Daten' 
zuruck. 
Wiederum entsteht die Frage: Leistet dies die Reduktion, daB ich 
nicht nur das Vermeinte entdecke, also das gegenstandliche Noema, son-
dern auch die Abschattungen, und genauer, die Abschattungen verschie-
dener Schichten, daB ich also mehr oder weniger in den Vorgang der 
Objektivation Einblick gewinne, wenn dieser Ausdruck verstandlich ist. 
Da muB ich sagen: Nein, nein, das wird nicht durch die Reduktion selbst 
entdeckt. Man muB, wie Hussed auch selbst behauptete, auf eine be-
sondere Weise 'reflektieren', und zwar nicht auf meine Akte, sondern 
auf den phanomenalen Hintergrund reflektieren, aus dem das Venneinte 
als solches entspringt. Das ist wiederum eine ganz besondere Operation, 
und es ist zugleich auch eine andere Art, die 'Reduktion' anzuwenden, 
nach einem in gewissem Sinne ganz anderen Prinzip. Man kann sagen, 
wenn man das analysiert, daB eine Reihe von Reduktionen durchzufiih-
ren ist, damit man erst in das komplizierte Material des Erlebten im 
flieBenden ursprunglichen BewuBtsein eindringt. Jetzt wird das Imma-
nente und das Transzendente nicht nach demselben Prinzip, wie fruher, 
geschieden. Das Transzendente, das erste Transzendente, die reale Welt, 
ist schon nicht mehr da, es ist schon eingeklammert, es ist nur die Welt 
der Sinne, insbesondere der Dingsinne geblieben. Wenn ich mich mit 
einem besonderen Ding, das ich wahrnehme, beschaftige und mich frage, 
wie nehme ich eigentlich dieses Vermeinte wahr, oder besser: Wie habe 
ich dieses Vermeinte? - Was ist an diesem Vermeinten? - ja, dann 
komme ich auf diese Sachen, von denen ich schon fruher bei der Analyse 
der Wahrnehmung gesprochen habe: Das Vermeinte wird zurn Teil in 
erfiillten Qualitaten und zum Teil in nicht erfiillten Qualitaten gezeigt. 
Es gibt, wie Hussed sagt, anschauliche Intentionen. Das, was ich da vor 
mir sehe, das weist mich auf den Hintergrund, auf das Innere, weist mich 
auch manchmal auf das Psychische, das Fremd-Psychische hin. Das von 
mir in erfiillten Qualitaten Gesehene scheint durch diese Erfiillung der 
Qualitaten, die mich da bedrangen, sozusagen bewahrheitet zu sein, 
scheint begriindet zu sein. Dagegen das, was da alles noch zum Vennein-
ten gehi);t, das Innere, die Hinterseite, das Fremd-Psychische - das wird 
leer, obwohl doch phanomenal vermeint; und die Erfahrung lehrt: Wenn 
ich das Ding von der anderen Seite sehe, wenn der betreffende Herr sich 
zu mir umkehrt, dann zeigt sich die vermeinte Hinterseite oft doch ganz 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
55 
anders, als sie frtiher war. Also es ist ein anderes Geltungsgewicht dessen, 
was sich uns da von dem Venneinten an der Vorderseite zeigt, als dessen, 
was da bloB leer mitgegeben, mitvenneint wird. Das Geltungsgewicht des 
ersten tiberwiegt das Gewicht des zweiten - und was das zweite postuliert, 
das ist schon nicht sicher, das kann doch irgendwie anders sein, das er-
fordert eine Verifizierung im weiteren Verlauf der Erfahrung. Also Vor-
sicht! Glauben wir nicht alles, was wir angeblich sehen! Vnd ja, jetzt 
fiihren wir aufs neue die Reduktion durch, jedoch nicht mit Rticksicht 
darauf, daB es prima facie ontisch transzendent ist, sondem mit Rtick-
sicht darauf, daB es 'transzendent' im erkenntnistheoretischen Sinne ist, 
das heiBt, daB es nur venneint und nicht gesehen wird, nicht auf erftillte 
Weise gegeben wird. Also aIle unerfii1lten QualiHiten, die ich dem wahr-
genommenen Dinge zuschreibe, die 'klammere' ich ein, 'schalte' ich aus, 
- und da bleibt mir von dem vollen venneinten Ding, genauer gesagt yom 
Sinn des vollen Dinges, nur ein Teil, und das andere ist eine noch zu 
verifizierende Intention. Da mache ich also die Reduktion zum zweiten 
Mal, nicht in Bezug auf die Generalthesis, sondem in Bezug auf die 
Geltung dessen, was in der Wahmehmung nur mitvermeint wird. la, ich 
ziehe mich bei dieser zweiten Reduktion weiter zurtick und ich bringe 
mir zum aktuellen BewuBtsein die bis jetzt nur schlicht erlebten Ansich-
ten, Abschattungen, also z.B. nur die 'perspektivischen Verktirzungen'. 
An der Vorderseite gibt es auch nicht-erfiillte Qualitaten, obwohl sie 
besser erftillt sind, als diejenigen, die der Hinterseite zugedeutet werden. 
Wenn ich eine rote Kugel sehe, so sind die Hinterseite und das Innere 
dieser Kugel nur mitvenneint, fast leer venneint auf Grund dessen, was 
ich da in erfiillten Qualitaten sehe. Aber, wenn ich mich auf die Vorder-
seite, auf die Ansicht der Vorderseite reduziere, so bemerke ich noch et-
was Merkwtirdiges, was die Maler entdeckt haben: Die Kugel sehe ich 
rot, ganz einheitlich rot, und dazu sehe ich sie glatt und lichtspiegelnd. 
Da frage ich mich: la, sehe ich wirklich, daB sie so einheitlich rot ist? 
Wenn ich genau hinsehe, bemerke ich: Hier ist es heller, dort ist es 
dunkler, dort tritt ein Reflex auf, da ist ein Licht usw. Die einheitliche 
Farbe des Dinges als solche ist auch nieht voll erfiillt, sie ist lediglich 
anschaulich venneint. Es ist die Frage, ob ich das wirklich richtig ver-
meine, ob diese Venneinung der einheitlichen Farbe durch die erfiillten 
Qualitaten, also die verschiedenen Abschattungen der Farbe begrtindet 
ist. In der nonnalen, nicht reduzierten Wahmehmung ist das nattirlich 

56 
ROMANINGARDEN 
vermeint als giiltig. Ich sage zu jemandem: Gibt mir diese rote Kugel da! 
Und man gibt mir die 'rote' Kugel. Ich sage nicht: 'diese vielfarbige' 
Kugel, das wiirde man vielleicht nieht verstehen, man wiirde mir dann 
vielleicht eine ganz andere Kugel bringen, die eben wirklich vielfarbig 
ist. So, wie man z.B. Krawatten mit vielfarbigen Flecken kauft. 
Ich muB also eine neue Reduktion durchfiihren - nieht nur in Bezug 
auf die Hinterseite, sondem auch auf die Vorderseite, auf diese verein-
heitlichte einzige Farbe, - dieses, was hier wiederum nicht voll erfiillt ist. 
Wenn man das ganz genau macht und konsequent durchfiihrt, dann 
zeigt es sich, daB bei normaler Wahmehmung, wo ich auf Dinge einge-
stellt bin, sehr viele verschiedene Schichten von verschiedenen Typen 
von Ansichten vorhanden sind, - irnmer mehr und mehr erfiillt, je weiter 
ich zum Untergrund zuriickgehe. Und irnmer weniger enthalten sie dann 
Intentionen, intentionale Momente, anschauliche Intentionen. Je mehr 
anschauliche Intentionen die jeweilige Ansichten-Schicht enthalt, desto 
mehr 'fraglieh' scheint sie zu sein und veranlaBt uns zum Vollzug einer 
'Reduktion'. Mehrere solcher Reduktionsschritte muB man dann voll-
ziehen. Alle diese Vorkehrungen liegen in erster Linie nicht im Rahmen 
der Entdeckung des reinen BewuBtseins, sondem vielmehr im Rahmen 
einer Entdeckung immer neuer Phanomene, die zunachst im Hinter-
grund irgendwie verborgen zu sein scheinen und die man zu Zwecken 
einer Erkenntnistheorie analysieren muB. 
Eine neue Reduktion und eine neue besondere 'Reftexion' bezieht sieh 
nieht auf Akte, sondem auf die Untergriinde der Ansichten, bis man zu 
dem kommt, was die Englander 'sense data' nennen und was bei Husserl 
'hyletische Daten' genannt wird. Da scheint es wiederum, daB ich so-
zusagen eine Kombination von Flecken bekomme, die fiir sich ein Ganzes 
bilden; sie bilden z.B. den Untergrund einer Ansieht von der Kugel. 
Wenn ich diese intentionalen Momente, diese intendierten Farben nur 
reduziere und dahinter sehe, so zeigt es sich, daB es wiederum eine be-
sondere Auffassung gibt, und zwar einen Ganzheitscharakter, der inner-
halb des ganzen Feldes verschiedener Flecke, besondere Farbenerschei-
nungen als zusammengehorig von dem Rest des Feldes abscheidet und 
ihnen Einheit verleiht. Diese Erscheinungsganzheit, von uns empfunden, 
bildet den Untergrund einer Ansicht, die von uns erlebt die Kugel zur 
Gegebenheit bringt. Es fragt sieh aber, ob und wenn ja, worin dieser 
Ganzheitscharakter einer Mannigfaltigkeit von ftieBenden Farbendaten 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
57 
begrtindet ist. 1m Allgemeinen gibt es gar keine Konturen, welche dies 
in manchen Hillen bewerkstelligen. Manche Maler verwenden derartige 
Konturen, urn eine Ansicht eines Dinges mit technischen Mitteln zu re-
konstruieren, aber andere brauchen gar keine Konturen, sondem legen 
Flecke, Flecke, Flecke nebeneinander. Dann ist es die Frage, was diese 
Einheitsbildungen innerhalb des Feldes begrtindet bzw. ermoglicht. Hat 
das seinen Grund in den Farbendaten selbst, oder ist dies lediglich von 
den empfindenden Subjekt als eine Einheitsauffassung aufgeworfen. Da 
ist also wiederurn eine 'Reduktion' zu vollziehen, d.h. diesen Einheits-
oder Ganzheitscharakter 'einklammem' und zugleich zu dem Empfin-
dungsdatenfeld refiektiv zurtickkehren. Es zeigt sich aber beim behut-
samen Erfassen dieses Feldes, daB da die Rede von Empfindungsdaten 
unkorrekt ist, was zuerst Bergson sich zurn BewuBtsein gebracht hat, 
obwohl er hier auch die Zeitform des Pluralis verwendet. Es ist aber nicht 
eintonig, und deswegen spricht Bergson von einer 'continuite heterogene'. 
Dies scheint wahrend einiger Zeit stabil zu sein, sich als identisches Ganze 
zu erhalten. Aber dieser Konstanz und Stabilitatscharakter kann in Frage 
gestellt werden. 1st er im Gehalt des Empfindungsdatenfeldes gentigend 
begrtindet oder ist er nur eine von dem empfundenen Subjekt aufge-
worfene Auffassung? So ist zunachst dieser 'Konstanz'- und Stabilitats-
charakter wiederurn zu 'reduzieren', einzuklammem und es muB ver-
sucht werden, nicht in dem Gegenwartsmoment des Empfindens zu ver-
harren und sozusagen den Wandel, den FluB des Geschehens der Zeit 
(des Dauems) zu tibersehen und zu dem ursprtinglichen ZeitfiuB, zu der 
reinen, im unaufborlichen Werden begriffenen Dauer zurtickzukehren 
und mit dem sich immer neu gebarenden Jetzt zu fiieBen und korrelativ 
den fiieBenden, werdenden Strom der ursprtinglichen Daten in seinem 
standigen Wandel zu erfassen. Dann ist man Zeuge des sen, wie gewisse 
Daten aktuell werden, die Kulmination der Aktualitat erlangen und dann 
in die retentionalen Modifikationen tibergehen und sich als das soeben 
Vortibergehende mit den neuen aktuell werdenden verschmelzen. Da 
kommen wir zu dem letzten FluB der Daten, aber zugleich gibt es inner-
halb dieses Stroms das empfindende und sich auch anders verhaltende 
Ich, aus dem jetzt Akte, Intentionen in sich enthaltende Akte hervor-
quellen und in diesem ganzen Strom gewissermaBen pulsieren. Wobei 
das Auftreten dieser Akte und ihre Funktionen fUr die Gestalt des 
fiieBenden Stromes der Daten nicht irrelevant sind. Es gibt also eine ganze 

58 
ROMANINGARDEN 
Reihe von Reduktionsschritten, in denen immer das 'eingeklammert' 
wird, was nur vermeint ist, oder nicht letztens 'erfiillt' wird und den 
Ausgangspunkt eines Riickganges zu dem bildet, was mehr und mehr er-
fiillt, mehr und mehr urspriinglich 'erlebt' oder nur 'empfangen' wird. 
Es ist also nicht nur die erste Reduktion, die die Generalthesis reduziert, 
zu vollziehen, sondern immer neue Reduktionen in Bezug auf das nur 
Vermeinte in jedem eventuellen neuen, tieferen Niveau der Erfahrung. 
All das, was ich da zuletzt sagte, wiire fUr Husser! gar keine Neuigkeit. 
Er hat dieses ganze Gebiet selbst erforscht und selbst groBe Entdeckun-
gen gemacht, ohne aber darauf hingewiesen zu haben, daB da neue und 
andere Reduktionen vorhanden sind. In dem II. Bande der Ersten Philo-
sophie hat er dieses ganze Problemgebiet betreten, es gibt dort sehr kom-
plizierte Situationen, die ich hier nicht auseinandersetzen kann. 
Ein Problem mochte ich doch mit einigen Siitzen andeuten: MuB man 
den Strom des reinen BewuBtseins im FluB der Zeit nehmen, in der ur-
spriinglichen Zeit? Es zeigt sich, daB die intentionalen Akte selbst, die 
sich zuniichst als Einheiten im FluB irgendwie abgrenzen, selbst im FluB 
erst werden, oder selbst einen besonderen FluB hinter sich haben, so 
daB man dann diese Einheitlichkeit des Aktes in der echten letzten Re-
flexion, die auf sich selbst gerichtet ist und sich im Durchleben vollzieht, 
wiederum 'reduzieren' muB, da gefragt werden kann, ob sie, voll erfiillt, 
letztlich begriindet ist. Hier kommt man letzten Endes zu dem, was 
Bergson la duree pure genannt hat und was er z.B. in den V ortriigen in 
Oxford unter dem Titel 'Perception du Changement' behandelt hat. 
Dieses Gebiet, das auch von Husser! entdeckt und in vielen hochst wich-
tigen Untersuchungen durchforscht worden ist, bildet das Thema der 
tiefsten philosophischen Probleme, aber auch die Quelle der groBten 
Schwierigkeiten, die zu iiberwinden sind. Ais ein schwieriges Problem 
ergibt sich die soeben erwiihnte Situation, in welcher sich zeigt, daB in-
tentionale Akte selbst in der urspriinglichen Dauer im Werden begriffen 
sind und in diesem flieBenden Werden nur Einheitsbildungen sich ent-
wickeln: Sie zeichnen sich dann in dem urspriinglichen FluB als Ein-
heiten, als Ganzheiten abo Urn aber diese Einheitsbildung der Akte - die 
letzte Genese der Akte im reflektiven Durchleben zu erschauen und die 
ReichmiiBigkeit dieser Genese zu durchforschen, muB man - nicht nur 
einfach in der urspriinglichen Zeit den FluB selbst, sondern bereits einen 
Akt - also eine iiber den kontinuierlichen FluB hinausragende Einheit

haben. Auf diesen Tatbestand bin ich einst (1916) bei der kritischen Vor-
bereitung zu Bergsons Intuitionstheorie gestoBen und habe auch dama1s 
mit Husserl dariiber gesprochen. Es zeigte sich, daB Husserl iiber die da 
drohende Gefahr gut unterrichtet war. Er sagte nur: "Ja, es droht da 
ein teufiicher Zirkel". Wie aber dieser Zirkel zu losen bzw. zu vermeiden 
ist - das habe ich damals und spater von Husserl nicht erfahren. 
A11e diese in neuen, noch zu bestimmenden Sinnen, verschiedenen 
'Reduktionen' sind hilfreich bei allen sich eroffnenden Analysen. Sie sind 
aber nie allein zu vo11ziehen, sondem mussen immer mit neuen Re-
fiexionsoperationen zusammengehen. Dann eroffnet sich wirklich das 
komplizierte, weite, mehrstufige Feld des reinen BewuBtseins, wenn das 
uberhaupt nur 'BewuBtsein' ist. 
Dann noch ein paar kleinere Probleme, die ich hier in einigen Satzen 
erledigen mochte: Husserl postuliert, daB die transzendentale Reduktion 
auf verschiedene Wissenschaften angewendet werden solI. Es ist ziemlich 
klar, daB die Naturwissenschaft nicht vorausgesetzt werden darfund daB 
dasselbe die Mathematik betrifft. Aber Husserl geht dann weiter und 
sagt, man darf auch die Logik, die mathesis universalis nicht voraussetzen. 
Sie wissen, bei Husserl sind die Logik und die formale Ontologie sozu-
sagen zwei Spiegelbilder, die streng zueinander gehoren. Also es ist nicht 
nur die Logik in der Sphare der Satze, der Sinne, in der Sprache, sondem 
auch irgendwie die formale Struktur der Welt als solche zu 'reduzieren'. 
Zuerst kommt es hier auf die Logik an. Die Phanomenologie solI doch 
eine 'strenge' Wissenschaft sein. Wenn wir fragen, was zu einer strengen 
Wissenschaft gehort, so muB man in erster Linie anfiihren: Naturlich 
geh6rt dazu eine regelrecht durchgefiihrte Erfahrung, eine Interpretation 
der Erfahrung, - und dann verschiedene Denkoperationen, logische 
Operationen, das SchlieBen, Vergleichen usw. Das a11es solI ich 'reduzie-
ren'. Was heiBt reduzieren? Das heiBt, daB ich mich der Anwendung der 
logischen Gesetze enthalte. Ich muB die Ste11ung einnehmen, indem ich 
mich frage: 1st die ganze Logik wahr oder falsch? 1st sie richtig, oder 
ist sie ein Phantasma des verriickten Menschen, der sich so eine Logik 
ausgedacht hat? Wenn ich das nicht entscheiden darf, so fragt es sich: 
Kann ich eine Wissenschaft aufbauen, wenn ich keine logischen Opera-
tionen vollziehe? Husserl selbst hat natiirlich viele logische Operationen 
vo11zogen, sonst k6nnte er keine Bucher schreiben. Er muBte aufpassen, 
daB er sich nicht wiederholte, daB sich alles konsequent entwickelte, daB 

60 
ROMANINGARDEN 
in dem Ganzen eine logische Ordnung herrschte. Hussed sagt da: Was 
fiir uns eigentlich wichtig ist, das sind lediglich die logischen Axiome, 
nicht die ganze Logik mit ihren komplizierten Operationen. Denn die 
Phanomenologie solI eine nur deskriptive Wissenschaft sein, sie braucht 
nicht und solI auch nicht schlieBen, Schliisse ziehen, - sie solI beschrei-
ben. Was wir da brauchen, nun, das sind vielleicht die logischen Axiome, 
z.B. der Satz des Widerspruchs. Dieses Prinzip kann man logisch ver-
stehen, man kann es auch ontologisch verstehen. Es gab bekanntlich be-
reits bei Aristoteles diese verschiedenen Deutungen. Hussed sagt: Nun, 
das ist leicht, - Axiom ist intuitiv einsichtig. An einem Beispielsfall 
konnen wir seine Geltung jedesmal aufs neue einsehen, zur Intuition 
bringen. Das logische Axiom wird dann nicht nur rein gedanklich ver-
meint, sondem wir haben dann den betreffenden Seinszusammenhang 
der sich ausschlieBenden widersprechenden Sachverhalte zur schlichten 
Gegebenheit gebracht. So ist die Antwort von Husserl. Also kann man 
die Phanomenologie als eine deskriptive Wissenschaft treiben, man muB 
nur aufpassen, daB keine Widerspriiche auftreten. Und wenn sie drohen, 
dann muB man sich das Prinzip wieder anschaulich machen und am in-
dividuellen Fall erschauen. 
Ich mochte das nicht speziell weiter entwickeln, aber ich sehe da eine 
Gefahr. Ich bin etwas skeptisch: Kann man sich wirklich an einem in-
dividuellen Fall das Widerspruchsprinzip anschaulich machen? Das ist 
wiederum ein groBes Thema, das ich hier nicht entwickeln m5chte. Ich 
fiirchte jedoch, daB wenn man konsequent die Logik ausschaltet, sich 
daraus eine Gefahr fiiI die Phanomenologie als Wissenschaft ergibt. Wie 
kann man sie dann betreiben? Ich weill das momentan nicht, aber die 
Antwort Husserls scheint mir nicht befriedigend zu sein. 
Schwieriger ist etwas anderes. Husserl sagt namlich: Nicht nur die 
mathesis universalis als eine formale Wissenschaft, sondem auch die ma-
terialen Ontologien sol1en 'reduziert' werden. Das bringt jedoch die Ge-
fahr mit sich, den Grund der phanomenologischen Reduktion selbst zu 
unterminieren. 
Was veranlaBte Hussed zu der Durchfiihrung der Reduktion? Was 
war das Motiv? Es war die Scheidung zwischen dem (ontisch) Transzen-
denten und dem Immanenten. Er sagte: Ja, so etwas wie ein physisches 
Ding kann seinem Wesen nach nicht reelles Bestandstiick des BewuBt-
seins sein. So ist sein Wesen, daB es sozusagen in das BewuBtsein nicht 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
61 
eindringen kann, es bleibt immer auBerhalb desselben. Spater wiederholt 
sich diese Behauptung, bei der Aufstellung des Idealismus kommt sie 
sehr scharf zum Ausdruck: Nichts, was nicht ErIebnis ist, kann mit 
einem ErIebnis in Einheit zusammen sein, in Einheit d.h. so, daB es mit 
ihm eins ist. So ist das Wesen des Transzendenten, daB nichts aus der 
Welt in den Strom des BewuBtseins hineingefiigt werden kann. Nichts, 
was transzendent ist, kann, seinem Wesen nach, das BewuBtsein oder 
irgendetwas im BewuBtsein kausal bedingen. So ist auch das Wesen des 
BewuBtseins, daB es nicht von auBen her kausal bedingbar ist. Das 
Wesen der Vorgange, die in der transzendenten Welt vorgehen, ist es, 
daB sie das, was im BewuBtseinsstrom auf tritt, nicht kausal zu bedingen 
oder zu verandern vermogen. 
Schalten wir jedoch aIle Ontologien aus! Es ist doch einerseits Onto-
logie des BewuBtseins und andererseits Ontologie der realen Welt, des 
Physischen usw., der kulturellen Gebilde usw., die da in Betracht gezo-
gen werden. In Bezug auf das Erste wiirde HusserI sagen: Nun gewiB, 
das schalten wir aus, das betrifft das Immanente, genauer etwas, dessen 
Wesen selbst immanent ist. HusserI unterscheidet zwischen immanenten 
und transzendenten Wesen. Die verschiedenen Ergebnisse, die wir bisher 
in Bezug auf das BewuBtsein verwendet haben, konnen wir also aus-
schalten, denn wir kommen nach der Reduktion doch noch darauf zu-
ruck. Wir konnen nunmehr bewuBt, absichtlich und korrekt die ent-
sprechenden Analysen des Immanenten durchfiihren und das Wesent-
liche aus dem konkreten Material herausschalen. Husserl sagt: Ja, da 
schale ich eben das Reine aus dem zunachst als psychisch AufgefaBten 
heraus. 
Lassen wir das zu. Nichtsdestoweniger ist der Grund dessen, was uns 
erIaubt hat, die Reduktion durchzufiihren, jetzt selbst unterminiert und 
so ist auch die Scheidung zwischen BewuBtsein und Nicht-BewuBtsein 
durch die Ausschaltung der materiellen Ontologien in Frage gestellt und 
muBte nach der bereits vollzogenen Reduktion aufs neue erwogen wer-
den. Denn alles, was tiber das Wesen des physischen Dinges und uber 
die materielle Welt ontologisch behauptet wurde, ist durch den Vollzug 
der Reduktion der Welt-Ontologie zu etwas geworden, worauf man sich 
nicht berufen darf - also auch dann nicht, wenn die Grenze zwischen 
Welt und BewuBtsein gezogen werden sol1- insbesondere, wenn also die 
ontische Transzendenz der materiellen Welt dem reinen BewuBtsein ge-

62 
ROMANINGARDEN 
geniiber entschieden werden soIl. U nd die Entscheidung ist flir die Durch-
flihrung der Reduktion unentbehrlich. Ais ich HusserI z.B. das Buch Das 
literarische Kunstwerk schickte, forderte er von mir: Sie miissen doch die 
Ontologie des Kunstwerks zUrUckstellen, wenn Sie zu einer letzten Ent-
scheidung kommen wollen. Sie miissen Ihre Ergebnisse der Reduktion 
unterziehen und eine konstitutive Betrachtung des literarischen Kunst-
werks auf dem Boden des reinen BewuBtseins durchflihren. - Sachlich 
ware dagegen nichts zu sagen. Aber bei mir handelte es sich nicht urn 
die letzte Abgrenzung zwischen dem literarischen Kunstwerk und dem 
es erfassenden BewuBtsein. Ich habe auch nicht versucht, das We sen des 
BewuBtseins z.B. aus dem Gegensatz zwischen ihm und dem Kunstwerk 
zu bestimmen. Gerade darum geht es jedoch bei HusserI, wenn er ver-
mittels der transzendentalen Reduktion den Zugang zum reinen BewuBt-
sein gewinnen will. Die Auffassung dieses BewuBtseins, wie sie sich bei 
HusserI seit den Ideen anzeichnet, ist gerade der strittige Punkt, von 
dessen Betrachtung man einen neuen Zugriff zur Behandlung des trans-
zendentalen Idealismus bei HusserI finden konnte. HusserI sagt, daB zurn 
reinen BewuBtsein sowohl Akte als Empfindungsdaten, als auch An-
sichten und die Dingnoemata hinzugerechnet werden sollen. Demgegen-
iiber entsteht der Gedanke, daB es vielleieht ganz anders ist. Vielleieht 
bilden das BewuBtsein im strengen Sinne nur die intentionalen Akte und 
gar kein Vermeintes, gar keine Ansichten, oder Empfindungsdaten. Das 
muB man aufs neue durchdenken. Aber in diesen Vorlesungen kann ieh 
dies nicht weiter entwickeln. 
Ieh komme jetzt zu der letzten Frage, die ich noeh zu besprechen habe : 
HusserI behauptet: Wenn ich zunaehst natiirlieh eingestellt bin, da lebt 
in mir irgendwie die Generalthesis der natiirlichen Welt, und als Korrelat 
dessen ist das Phanomen des Real-Seins. Die materiellen Dinge, die 
Mensehen, die ganze Umgebung, - die Welt iiberhaupt gibt sieh mir im 
Charakter des Realseins. Das ist fiir mieh etwas ganz Se1bstverstand-
liches, so selbstverstandlieh und so angeblich klar, daB ieh am Ende nieht 
weiB, was es eigentlieh ist. Ja, das (angeblich) Evidente ist immer das 
Dunkelste. HusserI sagt: Damit ich klar weiB, was Realitat oder Real-
Sein eigentlieh ist, muB ieh zunaehst die Reduktion durehfiihren, und 
erst danaeh entdeeke ieh das Phanomen der Realitat oder des Real-
Seins. Das Vermeinte im Sinne des als Real-Vermeinten solI also ver-
moge der Reduktion geklart werden. Und ieh habe zugegeben, die Re-

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
63 
duktion ennoglicht es mir, daB ich von den Dingen zu dem Vermeinten 
und weiter zu dem vermeinten Sein, zu der vermeinten Realitat iiber-
gehe. Aus dem Sinngehalt des Vermeinten als solchem solI sich der Sinn 
des Real-Seins ergeben. 
Ich mochte mich nicht naher mit der Frage beschaftigen, ob sich durch 
die Reduktion nichts geandert hat in dem Beschaffensein der Dinge (ge-
nauer gesagt: in dem Sinn dieses Beschaffenseins), von denen ich wahr-
nehme, daB sie rot sind, daB sie hart sind, daB sie sUB sind usw. Denn 
es scheint, daB nach der Reduktion die Phanomene, das Phiinomen des 
Rotseins, des Hartseins usw. erhalten bleiben und ich kann sie mir zur 
deutlichen Erschauung bringen. Aber wie ist das mit dem Sein, mit dem 
Real-Sein und mit dem Sinn des Real-Seins ? 
Andert sich an dem Sinn der Realitiit nichts, wenn ich die Reduktion 
vo11zogen habe? Ich kann mich in die Position eines Psychastenikers in 
gewissem Sinne zuriickversetzen. Der arme Psychasteniker ist ungliick-
lich deswegen, weil er nicht glauben kann, daB das, womit er verkehrt, 
wirklich ist. Vnd ich bin ein kiinstlicher Psychasteniker in gewissem 
Sinne, ich mache es absichtlich, daB ich nicht a11es so naiv hinnehme, 
was als real gegeben wird, - denn ich habe die Reduktion durchgefiihrt. 
Hat sich an dem Phanomen des Real-Seins denn nichts geandert? Hus-
serI sagt: Nein, die Generalthesis ist geblieben, ich habe mich nur etwas 
von ihr zuriickgezogen. 
Ich muB jetzt an die vielen Diskussionen zwischen HusserI und seinen 
Schiilem denken, die immer wieder gerade dies als das Peinlichste emp-
funden haben, daB das Realsein als Realsein durch die Reduktion in 
seinem spezifischen Charakter, in seinem Sinn modifiziert wird. Da haben 
wir z.B. den Streit zwischen HusserI und Frau Conrad Martius. HusserI 
sagt: Das Reale ist nicht selbstandig, das ist irgendwie nur vermeint, nur 
intentional. 1m Gegensatz zum BewuBtsein hat es kein absolutes Wesen, 
es ist in Bezug auf das BewuBtsein nicht unabhiingig, d.h. daB es ohne 
das BewuBtsein nicht sein kann. Frau Conrad Martius sagt: Was ist das 
Grundphanomen des Real-Seins? Das ist, wie sie es nannte, 'Seinsauto-
nomie'. HusserI war sehr gegen diese Auffassung. Es ist sogar zu einem 
gewissen Bruch zwischen ihm und Frau Conrad-Martius gekommen. 
Der Realitat Autonomie zuzuschreiben - sagte HusserI - das ist eine 
absurde Verabsolutierung der Realitat. Autonom im echten Sinne ist nur 
das reine BewuBtsein, - jedoch alles, was sich im BewuBtsein konstituiert, 

64 
ROMANINGARDEN 
ist nicht autonom, es ist gerade seinsabhangig, es kann in sich selbst kein 
Seinsfundament haben. Wir konnen natiirlich fragen: 1st es nicht so, daB 
Husserl die Reduktion wirklich vollzogen hat und daB die schlechten 
SchUler es nicht zu tun vermochten? Husserl meinte, sie hatten es doch 
nicht verstanden, wie man die Reduktion richtig vollziehen solI. Viel-
leicht, aber wenn dem so ist, dann frage ich: Wird das Phanomen der 
Realitat, urn das es sich handelt, nicht doch durch Reduktion irgendwie 
modifiziert? Denn z.B. fiir Frau Conrad-Martius ist es nicht moglich zu-
zugeben, daB die Realitat in Bezug auf die Wahmehmung seinsabhangig 
ist. Sie spricht auch von einer anderen Transzendenz als alle, die hier 
bisher besprochen wurden, von einer Transzendenz, die sie fUr we sent-
lich fiir die Realitat halt. Und zwar fiihrte sie den Begriff der 'realen 
Transzendenz' ein, indem sie sagte: Kein BewuBtseinsakt, keine BewuBt-
seinsoperation vermag irgendetwas an dem Realen zu andem, kann es 
weder vemichten noch schaffen, kann es weder blau machen noch hart 
machen usw. Die Realitat ist untangierbar durch meine BewuBtseins-
operation, - so autonom, so unabhangig ist sie. Diese 'reale Transzen-
denz' ist sozusagen eine existentiale Transzendenz, sie setzt, wie es scheint, 
die ontische Transzendenz voraus. 
Die letzte Frage ist also, wie es da mit der Wandlung oder Nicht-
Wandlung des Phanomens des Seins steht, wenn man die transzendentale 
Reduktion wirklich vollzogen hat. 
Besteht die Gefahr daB das Phanomen der Realitat durch die Reduk-
tion geandert wird, so kann ich sie nicht und darf ich sie nicht durch-
fiihren. Denn sie brachte eine gewisse VerHilschung in der Analyse der 
Realitat. 
Das sind also alles nur Fragen. Vielleicht kann man diese Fragen so 
beantworten, daB man in der transzendentalen Reduktion alles in Ord-
nung Hinde und daB wir sie durchfiihren diirfen und sol1en. Aber alle 
Bedenken, die ich selbst und meine Kollegen und Freunde ofters er-
hoben haben, sind es doch wert, daB man sie durchdenkt. Und darauf 
wollte ich hier nur hinweisen. 
Was ist aber das Ergebnis der Durchfiihrung der transzendentalen 
Reduktion? Es gibt unzweifelhaft sehr viel Gutes. Vor aHem die sehr 
reichen und wirklich wertvollen Analysen des BewuBtseins und der ver-
schiedenen Gestaltungen des BewuBtseins, die Husserl, und nicht nur 
Husserl, durchgefiihrt hat und die im Vergleich mit den vorphanomeno-

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
65 
logischen Analysen einen reellen Fortschritt bedeuten. Vielleicht waren 
sie gerade nur auf diesem Wege zu erreichen. Oder vielleicht hat die Re-
duktion uns wenigstens verholfen, all das zu entdecken. Es gibt aber 
unter dem allen noch ein besonderes Ergebnis, namlich dasjenige, was 
man so kurz und nattir!ich vieldeutig unter dem transzendentalen Idealis-
mllS von Husser! versteht. Ich m6chte noch aIle jene Behauptungen kurz 
zusammenfassen, die aIle zusammen die besondere Theorie von diesem 
Idealismus bilden; ein Standpunkt fiir Husser! so wichtig und so heilig, 
daB er fast bereit war, die Freundschaft aufzulosen, wenn man in diesem 
Punkte nicht mit ihm zusammenging. Vnd tatsachlich ist es zwischen 
ihm und manchem seiner nahen Schtiler doch am Ende zum Bruch ge-
kommen. 
Nun ist die Sache die, daB der sogenannte 'transzendentale Idealismus' 
auch in einem historischen ProzeB befangen war, daB er sich im Laufe 
der fast 30 Jahre, in denen Husser! noch weiter daran gearbeitet hat, also 
von ungefahr 1910 an bis zu seinem Tode, noch auf verschiedene Weise 
gewandelt hat. Ich beschdinke mich hier auf die Darstellung seines 
Standpunktes, wie er in den Ideen I angedeutet wurde. Das bedeutet, ich 
beschranke mich auf den transzendentalen Idealismus, wie er sich auf 
die reale Welt bezieht. Denn bei Husser! ist in den Ideen I noch kein 
voller, umfassender Idealismus da. Ich habe in einer Abhandlung, die 
einige Monate nach dem Tode Husser! im Polnischen publiziert wurde, 
gezeigt, daB Husser! in den Logischen Untersuchungen noch kein 'Idealist' 
war, obwohl er bereits Phanomenologe war. - In den Ideen list er -
wenn Sie mir das Wort er!auben - noch Halb-Idealist, und zwar in dem 
Sinne, daB nicht alles als intentionale Leistung verschiedener Konstitu-
tionsprozesse behandelt wird. 
Die Ideen I bestehen aus vier Abschnitten. Der erste Abschnitt, un-
geflihr 40 Seiten, behandelt das Wesen und die Wesenserkenntnis. Er 
dient als Einleitung zur Phanomenologie, die als eine 'eidetische' Wissen-
schaft, d.h. Wissenschaft tiber das Wesen des BewuBtseins, behandelt 
und entwickelt werden solI. Man muBte also zunachst etwas tiber das 
Wesen wissen. Diese Auffassung des Wesens und der Wesenserkenntnis 
ist in einem wesentlichen Punkte dieselbe, wie diejenige, welche Husser! 
frtiher - vor den Ideen - vor allem in den Logischen Untersuchungen ver-
treten hat. Sie ist sozusagen 'realistisch' vermeint. Das heiBt: 'Wesen', 
eidiJs, ideale Gegenstandlichkeiten existieren autonom. Sie werden also 

66 
ROMANINGARDEN 
nieht 'gestiftet' oder geschaffen, wie dies in der spateren Sprache Husserls 
ausgedruckt wird, sie sind nicht nur Phanomene, identisch vermeinte 
Gegenstandlichkeiten, die aus konstitutiven Prozessen hervorgehen. Sie 
werden rein ontologisch behandelt - wenigstens in der sieh andeutenden 
Thesis: Es gibt so etwas! Das ist ganz deutlich fUhlbar, wenn man den 
ersten Abschnitt der Ideen I mit den darauf folgenden Abschnitten ver-
gleicht, wo die Lehre von dem reinen BewuBtsein und der transzenden-
talen Reduktion durchgefUhrt wird. Ich habe wahrend der Phanomeno-
logen-Tagung in Royaumont aus den Kreisen des Hussed Archivs in 
Louvain vernommen, daB der erste Abschnitt der Ideen aus einem alteren 
Manuskript, als der Rest der Ideen I stammt, und daB er dann bei dem 
Verfassen der .Ideen ohne jede Andeutung den Ideen beigefUgt wurde. 
Das mag natiirlich historisch stimmen und interessant sein, aber es be-
kraftigt nur die Behauptung uber den Vnterschied des prinzipiellen 
Standpunktes bei Husserls betreffs der eidos im Vergleieh mit der Auf-
fassung der realen Welt. 
1m Zusammenhang mit dem angedeuteten Charakter der Wesensauf-
fassung steht eine ganz bestimmte Idee der Wahrheit bei Husseri. Diese 
Idee der Wahrheit tritt am SchluB des ersten Bandes der Logischen Unter-
suchungen auf. Da wird die Logik auf eine besondere Weise aufgefaBt 
und mit einer streng realistisch verstandenen Theorie der Wahrheit in 
Beziehung gebracht. Als ich zehn Jahre nach meinem Doktorat zu 
Hussed nach Freiburg kam, hat er mieh eines Tages gefragt: "Was lesen 
Sie mit Ihren Studenten im Seminar"? "Ich habe Verschiedenes getan. 
Vnter anderem habe ich den ersten Band der Logischen Untersuchungen 
mit meinen Studenten durchgenommen." - "Ach, wozu machen Sie das? 
Das ist doch alles am Ende nicht richtig - diese ganze Theorie der Wahr-
heit, diese ganze Theorie der Satze als idealer Gegenstandlichkeiten. Ich 
habe schon langst eingesehen, daB dies alles falsch ist." So ungefahr hat 
er sieh damals ausgedriickt. Das sieht man aber nieht in den Ideen I. 
Man ersieht es erst aus der im Jahre 1929 publizierten Transzendentalen 
und formalen Logik. Das Wort 'ideale Gegenstandlichkeiten' ist zwar 
geblieben, aber die idealen Gegenstandlichkeiten wurden da gerade so 
'gestiftet', wie es Hussed damals sagte, wie die realen. Es gehort nur eine 
andere Mannigfaltigkeit von intentionalen Erlebnissen bzw. Operationen 
dazu, wenn man sogenannte ideale Gegenstandlichkeiten 'schafft', als 
bei Operation en welche zu realen Gegenstandliehkeiten fUhren. 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
67 
Wenn man in Bezug auf den ersten Band der Logischen Untersuchungen 
Husserl den Vorwurf machen konnte, daB er da 'Platoniker' sei, so kann 
man ihm diesen Vorwurf in Bezug auf die spiitere Phase, also auf die 
Formale und transzendentale Logik nieht machen. Ich glaube iibrigens, 
daB Husserl auch in der ersten Phase kein Platoniker war, wei! die so-
genannte Ideenlehre von Plato, so beriihmt sie auch ist, tatsiichlich nur 
ein erster Anfang einer Theorie ist. Es sind lediglieh verschiedene litera-
risch gefaBte Erziihlungen von den Ideen, die doch streng gefaBt nieht 
haltbar sind. Das Einzige, was Husserl in der Phase der Logischen Unter-
suchungen mit Plato verbindet, ist die Behauptung: Es gibt zwei ver-
schiedene Seinsgebiete, das Reale und das Ideale. In den Ideen list das 
Ideale als Seinsautonom erhalten geblieben, dagegen die reale Welt wird 
im Sinne des transzendentalen Idealismus gedeutet. In der Formalen und 
transzendentalen Logik werden schon beide Seinsgebiete als in Erlebnis-
sen konstituiert aufgefaBt. Beide werden 'gestiftet'. In den Ideen list 
Idealismus also auf die Sphiire der Realitiit der Welt beschriinkt, - und 
es besteht kein 'Idealism us' in Bezug auf die Idealitiit und Seinsautono-
mie der idealen Gegenstiindliehkeiten. 
Ich werde jetzt den sogenannten transzendentalen 'Idealismus' in eine 
Reihe von Behauptungen zusammenfassen, von denen einige gar nicht 
so 'idealistisch' klingen und nur im Zusammenhang mit den iibrigen Be-
hauptungen diesen Charakter annehmen. Fast alle diese Behauptungen 
wurden hier bereits angegeben. Es handelt sich also jetzt urn eine Zu-
sammenfassung. 
Die grundlegende Scheidung ist natiirlich die zwischen Immanentem 
und Transzendentem, und zwar im ontischen Sinne verstanden; das 
Transzendente ist das, was kein reelles Bestandstiick des Erlebnisses ist. 
Die zweite These lautet: Das Real-Dingliche ist dem reinen Wahrneh-
mungsbewuBtsein gegeniiber transzendent, - transzendent, weil es seinem 
Wesen nach kein reelles Bestandstiick des Erlebnisses sein kann. Die 
beiden Thesen als solche sind im Grunde gar nicht 'idealistisch'. Sie 
lauten vielmehr wie objektive Feststellungen iiber zwei Seinsgebiete, die 
zuniichst gleieh real, gleich existierend, seinsmiiBig gleichwertig zu sein 
scheinen. Bei naiver Einstellung - besonders bei naiver vorphilosophi-
scher Einstellung - hat dabei diese Sphiire des Transzendenten in der 
Seinsautonomie eine gewisse Prioritiit, wiihrend das BewuBtsein irgend-
wie sekundiir, nicht so selbstiindig in Bezug auf das Reale, aber doch 

68 
ROMANINGARDEN 
gleich real zu sein scheint. Also ist die reale Welt in ihrer Existenz sozu-
sagen 'stiirker', und das BewuBtsein ist irgendwie schwacher, wenn Sie 
mir erlauben, das so bildlich zu sagen. Und dann, sagt Husserl, sobald 
man den ganzen Tatbestand nach Vol1zug der transzendentalen Reduk-
tion analysiert, kehrt sich die Sache urn; die reale (transzendente) Welt 
ist das Sekundare, gewissermaBen Abgeleitete von dem reinen BewuBt-
sein. 
Worin bestehen nun die Schritte, die zu dieser neuen Auffassung 
ruhren, daB namlich das Ursprtingliche, wirklich Absolute das BewuBt-
sein ist, daB aber das Andere - die reale Welt - nicht mehr diesen Seins-
charakter hat? Man flingt wiederum mit gewissen Behauptungen an, die 
man ohne Zogem annehmen kann: Das reale Ding und alles Reale wird 
erfahren, wird erkannt in Abschattungen, in Ansichten, in Erscheinun-
gen und zeigt sich als das Identische in diesen Erscheinungen. Das Be-
wuBtsein dagegen zeigt sich uns nicht in Erscheinungen, sondem wird 
ohne diese Erscheinungen immanent, gewissermaBen direkt schlicht er-
lebt; es ist absolut selbst da. Das ist eine Behauptung tiber die verschie-
denen Gegebenheitsweisen des Realen und des BewuBtseins, - verschie-
dene Gegebenheitsweisen oder verschiedene Erkenntnisweisen, wenn Sie 
wollen. Das ist also eine erkenntnistheoretische Behauptung, die sich 
aus der Analyse des Wahmehmungsvorgangs ergibt. Und hierin steckt 
ohne Zweifel etwas Wichtiges. Das reine BewuBtsein 'schattet sich nicht 
ab', 'das Reale' 'schattet sich ab', sagt Husserl. 
Nun tritt eine ganz merkwtirdige Verschiebung ein, ein Ubergang zu 
einer ganz anderen Auffassung, als ob Gegebenheitsweise und Seinsweise 
dasselbe waren. Dies geschieht bei Husserl ohne eine besondere Erwa-
gung. Sob aId er von einem Gegenstande gezeigt hat, daB er anders ge-
geben wird, anders erkannt wird, stellt Hussed ohne weiteres fest, daB 
er anders existiert. Da erhebt sich gleich die Frage, ob dies richtig ist. 
Denn die erste Feststellung ist erkenntnistheoretisch und die zweite da-
gegen ontologisch oder besser metaphysisch. Wenn man sinnlich wahr-
genommen wird, existiert man auf eine ganz andere Weise, als dann, 
wenn man immanent erfahren wird. Darin liegt der Grund dessen, daB 
Hussed so schockiert war, wenn jemand behauptete, daB die reale Welt 
gerade so gut wie das reine BewuBtsein existiert. N ein, nein, das ist eine 
Verfalschung, sagt Hussed, das ist eine Verabsolutierung. Warum? Ja, 
weil doch das Eine in Abschattungen gegeben wird, und das Andere 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTlON 
69 
immanent, direkt, absolut wahrgenommen wird. Der Unterschied in der 
Gegebenheitsweise ist irgendwie bei Hussed mit dem Unterschied in der 
Existenzweise so verbunden, daB die Feststellung des ersten fUr ihn das 
intuitiv einsehbare Argument ffir die Behauptung des zweiten zu sein 
scheint. 
Eine weitere Thesis solI nun kliiren, in welchem MaB das Reale anders 
ist als das reine BewuBtsein. Hussed sagt ungefahr: Wissen Sie, die 
iiuBere Wahrnehmung ist doch ein transzendierendes Edebnis - das habe 
ich schon dargelegt, - es hat so eine Struktur, daB sich aus ihr das not-
wendige Sein des Wahrgenommenen nicht ergibt. Es k6nnte alles so 
verlaufen, wie es tatsachlich verlauft, und das Wahrgenommene - besser 
gesagt das reale Ding, das da wahrgenommen wird - konnte doch trotz-
dem nicht existieren. Worin liegt der Grund dieses 'konnte es nicht exis-
tieren'? Er liegt darin, daB die Wahmehmung partiell ist, daB sie mehr 
vermeint als in ihr voll erfUllt gegeben wird und auch gegeben werden 
kann. Sie ist eine in dem Wahrgenommenen Liicken lassende Wahmeh-
mung. In dem Wahrgenommenen bleiben unausgefUllte Unbestimmt-
heitsstellen stehen, die in anderen Wahrnehmungen derselben Dinge be-
seitigt werden k6nnten, aber nicht beseitigt werden miissen. Die iiuBere 
Wahrnehmung gleicht dem Versuch, irgendetwas von auBen her zu fas-
sen, aber das Fassende ist nicht so konstruiert, daB das GefaBte nicht doch 
entschliipfen und iiberhaupt ganz illusioniir sein k6nnte. 
In der immanenten Wahmehmung von meinem momentanen Erleben 
ist die Situation ganz anders. Hier ist das Wahmehmen aufgebaut iiber 
dem Wahrgenommenen, und zwar so, daB es dem Wahrgenommenen 
gegeniiber seinsunselbstandig ist; es ist nur ein Etwas des ganzen zu-
sammengesetzten Erlebnisses des Wahrgenommenen und des Wahr-
nehmenden was sich nur abstraktiv hervorheben liiBt. Das immanente 
Wahrnehmen konnte nicht sein, wenn es das immanent Wahrgenom-
mene nicht giibe. Ich habe bereits referiert: Zwischen dem immanent 
wahrgenommenen Erlebnis und dem wahrnehmenden Erlebnis besteht 
eine, wie Husserl sagt, 'unvermittelte Einheit'. D.h. es gibt keine Ver-
mittlung der Abschattungen usw., es gibt keine Unbestimmtheitsstellen, 
es gibt gar kein bloB Vermeintes, also leer Vermeintes. Ihrer Struktur 
wegen verbiirgt die immanente Wahrnehmung die Existenz des eben 
wahrgenommenen Erlebnisses. Es k6nnte nicht so sein, daB die imma-
nente Wahmehmung existieren und das immanent Wahrgenommene 

70 
ROMANINGARDEN 
nieht existieren wiirde. Dies ist dureh die Struktur des Erlebnisses selbst 
ausgeschlossen. Ganz anders also, als dort, bei der auBeren Wahrneh-
mung, wo es wesensmaBig so ist, daB die Struktur des Wahrnehmens zu-
laBt, in gewissem Sinne erlaubt, daB das, was da wahrgenommen wird, 
nieht existiert, - obwohl alles sonst unverandert verlauft. 
Worauf erklart Husserl: la, sehen Sie, das wahrgenommene Erlebnis 
existiert notwendig, - es ist Wider sinn zu denken, daB das wahrgenom-
mene Erlebnis nieht existiert, wenn es wahrgenommen wird. Und es ist 
nieht widersinnig zu denken, daB das wahrgenommene Ding nieht exis-
tiert, obwohl ieh es wahrnehme. Husserl geht sogar weiter: Wenn ieh 
andere Mensehen wahrnehme, und zwar mieh in das fremde Psyehische 
einfiihle, so entdeeke ieh ein zweites reines leh, einen zweiten BewuBt-
seinstrom in gewissem Sinne. Ieh gewinne einen Einbliek in das, was bei 
dem Anderen erlebnismaBig passiert. - So wird die Einfiihlung bei Hus-
serl verstanden. Es ist nieht die Lippssehe 'Einfiihlung'. Es kann sein, daB 
es diesen anderen Mensehen gar nieht gibt und daB es gar keine Erleb-
nisse von ihm gibt. Dagegen mein Einfiihlen, wenn ieh es zugleieh noeh 
immanent erlebe, muG notwendig existieren, wenn ieh es erlebe. Es wiirde 
in den Ideen I ausdriieklieh festgestellt, daB die anderen Iehs gerade nieht 
existieren konnten, obwohl sie wahrgenommen werden. (Spater in den 
Meditationen andert sieh die Problemlage wesentlieh in der 5. Medita-
tion. Da werden die anderen Iehs, die alter ego, in das Problem der Kon-
stitution der realen Welt mit hineingezogen). 
Aus der Struktur der versehiedenen Erkenntniserlebnisse selbst ergibt 
sieh also wiederum ein Seinsuntersehied: Das Eine existiert notwendig, 
das Andere zufallig. In welcher Beziehung notwendig und in welcher 
Beziehung zufallig? Etwas muB immer in Bezug auf etwas anderes not-
wendig bzw. zufallig sein. Notwendig ist das Sein des BewuBtseins in 
Bezug auf das immanente Wahrnehmen. Zufallig dagegen ist das reale 
dingliche Sein in Bezug auf das auBere sinnliehe Wahrnehmen, - es muB 
nieht bestehen, wenn das erfassende BewuBtsein existiert. 
So gefaBt seheint dieser Satz riehtig zu sein. 1m Grunde ist er nieht 
weit entfernt von dem Standpunkt Descartes in den Meditationen, mit 
dem indessen wesentliehen Untersehied, daB bei Husserl die Analyse der 
versehiedenen Strukturen des BewuBtseins wesentlieh weiter durehge-
fiihrt wurde und damit aueh der Satz selbst eine Begriindung erlangt, die 
es bei Descartes nieht gibt. Es besteht wirklieh ein Untersehied der 

PROBLEME DER HUSSERLSCHEN REDUKTION 
71 
Struktur und - wenn Sie das Wort erlauben - ein Unterschied der Leis-
tungsrahigkeit der auBeren Wahrnehmung einerseits und der Leistungs-
rahigkeit der immanenten Wahrnehmung andererseits. Das kann man 
also zugeben. Es gibt hier aber zwei Punkte, auf die noch hingewiesen 
werden muB. Erstens, kann man die Notwendigkeit der Existenz des 
wahrgenommenen Erlebnisses zugeben, wenn man weill, daB das im-
manente Wahrnehmen existiert. Wenn es existiert und wenn ein anderes 
Erlebnis in ihm immanent wahrgenommen wird, dann existiert unzwei-
felhaft auch das wahrgenommene Erlebnis wirklieh. Ja, woher weiB ieh 
denn aber, daB mein immanentes Wahmehmen existiert? Die Frage 
habe ieh schon beriihrt, - da muB ich, wie es scheint, ein neues, sozu-
sagen eine Stufe hoher sich abspielendes Wahrnehmen haben, aus dem 
sich dann ein unendlicher Regressus ergibt, falls man die Existenz des 
Durchlebens nicht zugibt, was aber Husserl nicht tut. 
Das sind vielleicht schwierige, aber jedenfalls einleuchtende Thesen 
tiber das Erkennen, die man annehmen kann. Ob d.ie Welt existiert, kann 
bezweifelt werden. Ob die gerade jetzt von mir erlebten wahrgenomme-
nen Erlebnisse existieren, kann nicht bezweifelt werden - das ware Wider-
sinn. Aber das hat noch nichts zu tun mit dem Idealismus, - das ist eine 
erkenntnistheoretische Frage. Es ist vielleicht wirklieh so, daB wir nicht 
sieher sein konnen, in aller Erkenntnis der Welt, daB sie doch so ist und 
daB sie ist, - es bleibt immer nur eine Annaherung. Es konnte doch eines 
Tages passieren, daB es anders ware. 
Der zweite Punkt liegt darin, daB die Behauptung Husserls tiber die 
Notwendigkeit der Existenz des reinen BewuBtseins und der Zufalligkeit 
der realen physischen Dinge (Welt) zwar unzweifelhaft sich aus der hier 
rekonstruierten Analyse der Erkenntniserlebnisse ergibt, aber in letzter 
Fassung so formuliert wird, daB dieser Seinsunterschied auf diese Er-
lebnisse nicht relativiert wird. Und dann gewinnt er den Charakter eines 
Unterschiedes, der einerseits in dem Wesen des Realen als solchem, an-
dererseits in dem des reinen BewuBtseins fundiert ist. Damit beginnt aber 
diese Behauptung zweifelhaft zu werden und erfordert eine andere, nicht 
erkenntnistheoretische Begrtindung.

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
Two publications of Roman Ingarden deal directly and exclusively with 
ethical problems: 'An Inquiry into Moral Valuesq (this is almost an 
exact record of one of his lectures on ethics held at the lagiellonian 
University in 1961/62) and Ueber die Verantwortung 2 (an extended ver-
sion of his lecture delivered at the International Philosophical Congress 
in Vienna in 1968). There are two more essays closely connected with 
those problems: 'Remarks on the Relativity of Values' (Uwagi 0 wzglfd-
nOSei wartoSez) 3 and 'What We Do Not Know about Values' (Czego nie 
wiemy 0 wartosciach); though they are devoted to the general theory of 
value, many considerations in them refer to the moral values. The way 
in which Ingarden approached ethics, its subject and aims, allows us to 
include his considerations on ontology and epistemology to the recon-
struction on his ethics. To those materials there may be added several 
chapters from the book The Controversy about the Existence of the World 4 
and two articles: 'Man and His Reality' (Czlowiek ijego rzeczywistosc) 5 
as well as 'Man and Time' 6. As to the above-mentioned lectures, only 
one of them was authorized and published by the author. 
In Ingarden's whole scientific output, some special groups of ethical 
problems may be distinguished: (1) strictly ethical problems, such as 
man's moral activity, moral values, the so-called virtues and imperfec-
tions; (2) a larger group, connected with the general theory of value; 
here belong the problems of ethics considered as the theory of moral 
values discussed on the ontological basis (the way of existence of values, 
their formal structure, etc.); 0) strictly ontological problems, as the basis 
of problems of moral values; (4) considerations on philosophical an-
thropology, more or less closely linked with ethical problems (they 
contain many suggestions as questions and solutions of ethical prob-
lems). 
The above-mentioned groups of ethical question, are narrowly inter-
twined - as those ethical considerations have here a special orientation.

on ethics) ethics should consider human activity in view of the possibility 
of realization of moral values. And the realization of moral values re-
quires - as a necessary condition - certain features of the structure of 
the world and of human consciousness. Those matters have been largely 
discussed in the book Ueber die Verantwortung. Many conditions have 
been listed there which must be fulfilled so that it is possible to speak 
about man's responsibility at all. Such problems as freedom and neces-
sity, identity of the acting subject, occurrence of causal relations in the 
world or in relatively isolated systems - are discussed on the basis of 
philosophy and the results find application in Ingarden's investigations 
on ethics. 
Ingarden has not worked out the whole of ethics. Therefore, in order 
to reconstruct his ideas on the subject, it is sometimes necessary to look 
for analogical problems discussed fully in his works on aesthetics. 
I. PLACE OF MORAL VALUES AMONG OTHER VALUES 
On the general theory of value, Ingarden represents the point of view 
of axiological pluralism: there exist many kinds of values and it cannot 
be decided beforehand whether they have anything in common or 
whether they are absolutely different, whether their mode of existence 
and the formal structure are the same in all cases or not. There has not 
been established hitherto any special method of classification and ranging 
of values of different kinds. Therefore, making a suggestion in this 
matter, Ingarden introduces a restriction that it is only a preliminary 
proposition which will probably have to be changed according to further 
analyses. The preliminary list of values is to be found in the essays en-
titled 'Remarks on the Relativity of Values' 7 and 'What We Do Not 
Know about Values'. 8 The groups of values mentioned there are as fol-
lows: (1) vital values (related with utilitarian, economical and pleasure-
producing values); (2) culture values (especially cognitive, aesthetical and 
social values); (3) moral values. Thus the moral values form a separate 
group. Ingarden stands in opposition to a widely spread opinion that 
the moral values can be treated as sort of utilitarian or social values, 
and that they can be reduced to man's estimations and norms of customs 
and habits approved by a given society. For instance, an act which seems 
to be harmful from the point of view of society need not be thereby an 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
75 
act charging the man with a moral blame; on the other hand, an act 
highly positive in its results has not always a moral value. 9 The moral 
values are autonomous: their formal structure and way of existence are 
of special character. However they have something in common with 
other values: they belong to the human reality, to the world created by 
man beyond his biological necessities. Ingarden discusses those problems 
in the article 'Man and His Reality'. This article does not deal directly 
with moral problems but with their bases and the background against 
which they occur. The author presents here a conception of man as a 
being able to create values, responsible for their persistence and aug-
mentation. The most important feature distinguishing man from other 
creatures is not so much his faculty to change his reality and become 
independent of it (this is a very important but secondary phenomenon) 
as his ability to create a fully new reality which once created persists 
and forms an essential element of the world. There belong here works 
of art, scientific theories, philosophical and theological systems, lan-
guages as the way for recording and transmitting of thoughts, states, 
institutions, systems of law, money and so on. If man suddenly missed 
all that, his reality would not only become poorer but his life would stop 
being a natural human life. It is characteristic that man in the course 
of his development did not satisfy himself to produce merely the practical 
tools but started to produce goods not necessary from the biological 
point of view: they are indispensable for his psyche, they are a mani-
festation of his spiritual forces and they enrich his world as well. If man 
reduced his activity to the satisfaction of his biological needs and to the 
facilitation of his life, he would miss the reason for his life to be taken 
care of. "Would the abundance of food, sensual pleasure and comfort 
attach us so much to life as to make it worth while facing all its troubles, 
dangers and sufferings ?" 1 0 
The reality created by man affects and forms him. This reality includes 
also such values as goodness, beauty, justice, truth - hence the moral 
value too. Ingarden makes it clear, however, that this does not mean 
that those values are being created by man. It can only be stated that 
man may reach them through the reality created by himself. The good, 
in the moral sense, manifests itself through the created reality and also 
needs the creation of that reality to get - as Ingarden puts it - its em-
bodiment. Therefore if man did not create that reality, proper for human 

76 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
being, there would not be any truth, good, beauty, justice - there would 
not be any values. By embodying, augmenting and serving them, man-
kind reaches its proper, full humanity. Man 'mediates between the world 
of nature and the world of values'. Neither of those two worlds gives 
man full satisfaction, in neither of them man feels at home. He creates 
a new reality because the physical and biological world does not satisfy 
all his needs. That new reality opens for him such perspectives as he 
could not foresee and is not able to reach. 
It is therefore to assume, that creation of a new reality - the world of 
culture - is the moral duty of man. Its existence and development form 
the necessary conditions for the existence and development of moral 
values. The refusal to support and develop culture threatens man with 
the loss of his specific human features. Thus all creative work, the par-
ticipation in and contribution to the development of the spiritual culture, 
the augmentation of such goods as art or science have the moral char-
acter. It can be considered as the most general condition of human moral 
behaviour (in his further considerations on ethics Ingarden does not 
return to that condition). Let us keep it in mind as we find here the 
reference to human society. In this relation, though the moral values are 
different from the others and their existence is autonomous, they are 
linked with and - what is more - depending upon the other values: if 
there were no other values in the world of man there could not be any 
moral values either. Ingarden will return to that matter many times, it 
will recur as a question what relations and conditionings occur between 
values of different kinds. 
II. THE SUBJECT OF MORAL VALUES 
Ingarden attaches much importance to the specific character of moral 
values. He refers to it in his article 'What We Do Not Know about 
Values', while analysing it in the more detailed way in his lectures on 
ethics. To have an insight into what this peculiarity consists of, one must 
realize what is the bearer of moral values, what are the conditions of 
their occurrence, what is their formal structure and their way of exis-
tence. All those problems are closely linked with one another. Ingarden 
assumes that perhaps not only values of different kind but even some 
varieties of values of the same kind may have different formal structures 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
77 
and different ways of existence. Let us start with the matter of the bearer 
of moral values. To find the solution one must consider what sort of 00-
jects exclude the possibility for moral values to occur, what objects are 
doubtful in this respect, what allow the occurrence of moral values; 
finally Ingarden proposes to set a list of objects which are always con-
nected with moral values.!2 
One thing can be undoubtedly stated, that material objects cannot 
possess moral values (material things can possess some values but not 
any moral ones). Ingarden calls them after Scheler - goods. Some of 
them serve man's biological needs, his pleasures and so on, they are the 
so-called material goods; the others are spiritual goods as scientific 
works, works of art and so on covering his spiritual needs. Moral values 
are to be sought in the sphere of the personal values, man's deeds, acts 
of will, resolutions, decisions. The essential question here is what can be 
the subject of moral values in a human being. It is obvious that not 
everything in man can be included here. There must be excluded not 
only the physical side of man but also some of his psychic qualities, and 
in addition not all the personal values are moral values. Ingarden takes 
into consideration the possibility that the bearers of moral values can 
be various according to the kind of value; it may be a person, personal 
properties, acts of will, or it is possible that the bearer of moral values 
is to be sought in a combination of all those elements.!3 Moral values 
are probably most closely related with personal values. In Ingarden's 
considerations we can find clear suggestions that the quality, intensity, 
and height of moral values depend on the character of personal values 
which are their foundation and condition. He discusses those matters 
in a close relation with the conception of man which he sketches 
while considering the subject of pure consciousness and its form in the 
book The Controversy about the Existence of the World, and in the essay 
'Man and Time' (discussing two different ways of experiencing time and 
their practical consequences), as well as in his book Ueber die Verant-
wortung (chapter vln: 'The Substantial Structure of Person and the 
Responsibility'). The question of the bearer of moral values, in this case 
a human person, is especially important here because in his formal-
ontological considerations on the general theory of value (comp. 'What 
We Do Not Know about Values') Ingarden states that a value is not self-
contained in relation with its carrier. Therefore the qualities of that ob-

78 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
ject (more precisely: the subject serving as a bearer of value) cannot be 
meaningless for the qualitative determination of value. 
In his conception of the human person, Ingarden stands in opposition 
both to psychologistic and positivistic approach (confining a person to 
a 'bundle of experiences' and reducing the subject to a sum of psychic 
states) as well as to Husserl's transcendental idealism which assumes that 
the subject, the so-called 'pure ego', is being constituted in acts of con-
sciousness, in a stream of experiences. It is indispensable to distinguish 
many layers and sides in a human person, to assume the existence of one 
identical root, i.e. an 'ego' or subject. Ingarden distinguishes the stream 
of experiences from the pure subject, and also man's nature from change-
able experiences. Man's nature is a constant factor endowed with forces 
which only sometimes and often unexpectedly are manifested in experi-
ences, making a man able to undertake acts and fulfil them surpassing 
common abilities. Finally, he distinguishes the human person formed 
on the basis of all those elements. 14 Some connections between those 
elements are of consequence for the way of treating ethical problems. 
The subject of acts, the pure 'ego' plays an important role in the struc-
ture of the human person. The subject is the source of experiences; they 
are not independent, they are determined by the subject. As a matter of 
fact, " ... the 'ego' need not manifest itself in acts, it need not experience 
anything, but only by doing so it fully realizes its proper essence, and 
only in experiences it gains its proper form of existence." 15 The exper-
iences, however, are not something accidental to the subject, they rep-
resent 'the fulfilment of its proper way of existence'. 16 The subject may 
exist without any experiences (e.g. when sleeping, in states of uncon-
sciousness), but then it is in a paralysed state. Its accomplishment lies 
in its conscious life, in its self-recognition included in each conscious 
experience. That self-recognition enables the subject to perform acts 
characteristic of a human person, without which it could not develop 
itself according to its individual nature. Finally Ingarden states that the 
consideration of responsible acts should not be restricted only to the 
sphere of the pure 'ego' and pure experience. There must be respected 
also the real acting in the real world - the real man with his determined 
character. 17 Let us add that under an 'act' Ingarden understands not 
only the behaviour manifested in psycho-physical processes but also the 
inner acts, e.g. acts of love or hate, contempt or admiration, humility, 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
79 
repentance, obstinacy, etc. Those inner and outer acts fonn at the same 
time the man's 'ego'. "The final inner structure of the subject (its soul 
or spirit) depends on inner acts it has managed to accomplish. The sub-
ject creates itself in a way by its acts, and, at any rate - transfonns it-
self." 18 
Those considerations suggest that Ingarden's point of view oscillates 
between two hypotheses: all what constitutes man, whoever he becomes 
in the course of his life, is rooted in his nature because all his experience 
bears the stamp of the qualitative detennination of his nature; on the 
other hand, as far as acts fonn the subject, one can assume that a new 
factor is introduced from outside into man's personality. Due to this fact, 
man is not confined only to develop the elements rooted in his nature 
but he may actually fonn himself, his personality and his moral char-
acter. Ingarden does not distinguish the mentioned factor in 'The Con-
troversy over the Existence of the World' but only in Ueber die Verant-
wortung where he points out the effects of acts on man's personality. 
Let us stress the role of the subject of consciousness: it is the basis of 
the unity of a person and a leading factor, it penneates all man's quali-
ties, the powers of his soul and its nature, everything that gets manifested 
in acts of man's consciousness and acts of conscious behaviour. The 
subject is the actual executor of acts, the carrier and doer of acts of will, 
it decides itself about everything. However if it is unable to decide and 
yields to some forces of the soul, as it were, against its will - it is respon-
sible for it. 19 Let us note another factor connected with the structure of 
consciousness which Ingarden calls 'nature'. In his paper 'Man and 
Time' he puts it in opposition to variable experiences and psychic states 
and processes as well as to man's psychic and physical features. Nature 
is a constant qualification detennining 'the whole of myself as a man', 
it is specific and unique, different with every man. 20 Human nature is 
unchangeable all one's life; due to it man feels himself in spite of 
all changes occurring in him. It is extremely difficult to get to know one's 
own nature as well as that of anybody else. What we recognize of other 
people and of ourselves are only certain characteristics of human be-
haviour. 21 Therefore we usually detennine the characteristics of human 
nature through one's behaviour. 
Ingarden stands in opposition to such a way of approaching man's 
characteristics, because they derive from his nature. He says that a man 

80 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
is not malicious because he teases people and hurts them but he does 
so because he is malicious. Someone is not stupid because he does not 
understand some simple problems of life and theory, but he does not 
understand them because he is stupid. Someone is honest not because 
he does not swindle and steal, but he behaves like that because he is 
honest. "What he is in his deepest essence existing beyond his experiences 
he manifests himself as such in his acts and experiences,' getting through 
them more or less exact self-recognition and the final shaping of his 
soul." 22 The shape and course of experiences seem to depend upon the 
features of the soul and its actual state ( ... ) "The richer the soul is and 
the greater its inner powers, the more diversified, lively and intensive is 
its stream of consciousness, the greater tension it has and the better is 
the self-recognition gained by the subject on the basis of current exper-
iences. Thanks to that, the inner structure of a person getting crystal-
lized in one soul is growing the more harmonious." 23 Thus between the 
soul of man,24 the pure subject, the stream of consciousness and the 
human person getting crystallized on their foundation, there is not only 
the relation of existential heterarchy, but also the relations of functional 
dependence. 2s The existence of the subject, a constant basis of ex-
periences and the identity of the human person - this is one of the 
conditions to be established by Ingarden later on while listing the 
conditionings of moral acts. 
Let us refer also to the article 'Man and Time', where Ingarden presents 
almost the same conception of man's consciousness, intertwining it with 
the problem of the relation of man to time. He discusses there two dif-
ferent ways of experiencing time, one of them builds man ·and innerly 
integrates him, the other destroys and ruins him. As the basis of the first 
experience Ingarden introduces the conception of person assumed in his 
'Controversy ... ', whereas the other way of experiencing time is the con-
sequence of the conception of man as a 'bundle of experiences' in which 
there is no single core of human person, and where the personality is 
being formed by a changeable stream of experiences. In the first case -
man feels himself as something more stable in relation to his changeable 
experiences - in the other one -:- as being constituted in the course of his 
experiences. The latter attitude to one's ego is being set against the other 
one not only as a radically different one, excluding the former, but also 
resulting in negative, disastrous moral consequences. 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
81 
In his considerations Ingarden does not respect the possibility that in 
different periods of his life man can experience the passing time in dif-
ferent ways, and that not always the latter way of experiencing time is 
so destructive, and the former so constructive. He does not pay atten-
tion to the fact that human experiences are not only the result of one's 
nature and one's special character but they are under the impact of outer 
events and as such they can break man's nature and sometimes trans-
form it radically. 
III. PERSONAL VALUES AND MORAL VALUES 
Ingarden states that the subject of moral values in man are personal 
factors, that moral values may belong to the person getting crystallized 
during his life (the human person being a certain value in itself), that 
they can be found in man's acts, decisions and conduct. Not all the 
personal values are moral values. Ingarden mentions some personal 
values which are not moral yet, though closely linked with moral values 
(such as happiness, freedom, independence, intelligence, etc.); some of 
them may be treated as the conditions for the occurrence of moral values, 
others are indifferent on that score. 
Some reflection included in the article 'Man and Time' may be inter-
preted as a discussion of conditions which determine the appearance of 
moral values in man, though Ingarden does not introduce explicitly those 
problems. Sometimes we have the impression as if moral phenomena 
were the main problem of the paper whereas the considerations on the 
two ways of experiencing time were only a pretext to raise the problem 
of man and his behaviour. 
After all it is striking how much importance Ingarden attaches to the 
so-called self-knowledge in shaping man's personality, in reaching a 
higher level of inner integration (the lack of self-knowledge causes the 
disintegration of man's personality). When man finds occupations to 
make time pass, when he concentrates himself on what he is doing so 
as to forget himself - time kills him, crushes and annihilates him. In such 
a case man "leaves aside himself to serve other purposes." 26 Thus the 
"abiding by oneself in all possible states of joy or despair" is the condi-
tion to avoid emptiness and a necessary factor for man's development. 
An 'empty' man, directed exclusively outside is not yet morally bad (as 

82 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
one is tempted to assume) just like a man who is innerly rich and directed 
inside is not necessarily good. The problem gets however a special im-
portance at the time of trial. In the first case the difficulties cause the 
inner breakdown as one does not find in oneself enough strength to en-
dure, to oppose the evil. Therefore self-knowledge can be considered as 
a personal value being a base and condition of at least some moral 
values, such as faithfulness to ideals, self-mastery and endurance at the 
time of trial. This value facilitates man's inner integration and harmony 
which function assimilates it to moral values. In his lectures on ethics 
Ingarden points to inner integration of man as to the value approaching 
the field of moral problems. The inner harmony is conditioned by the 
many-sided development of man's powers, by the versatility of his in-
terests and activities, by the depth of his emotional and intellectual file: 
it is opposed to superficiality, to inability to experience deeper emotions. 
Other values, and at the same time the conditions for occurrence of 
moral values are to be found in the achievement of inner power, in the 
inner 'strength' of man. "To stay at someone's self - that is not only to 
enrich someone's self-knowledge in various circumstances, but also to 
master oneself in the struggle with the adversities of fate, with one's own 
conflicts, with the problems of life, it is to build oneself as a constantly 
increasing inner power. It is to rely on oneself and one's own existence." 27 
Man's strength gets increased by the fulfilment of acts with the sense of 
full responsibility and absolute conviction of their justness; by accom-
plishing voluntary acts, in spite of resistance and conventions, acts in 
which one's 'ego' is most fully manifested. When man is weak, he is un-
able to solve practical problems which require moral decisions. If man 
gets lost in meaningless trifles, if he cannot concentrate and undertake 
an effort, if he betrays his own self - then he gets crushed, the passing 
time destroys him and by little he becomes 'nothing'. 28 Man is a force 
- says Ingarden - which builds itself, multiplies and overgrows itself if 
he can only concentrate and does not get distracted. 29 The question is 
about the personal value connected with psychic strength, sometimes 
linked with physical strength and man's resistance. Analysing such a 
value as courage, Ingarden states that a man physically weak breaks 
down in difficult situations because his system does not serve him well, 
thus he is not to be blamed and does not execute any moral acting. 30 
Therefore we find here the conditioning of some moral values not only 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
83 
by man's psyche, his character and personal values but also by his phys-
ical constitution. The ability of perseverance and concentration, the 
possibility to undertake an effort, faithfulness to one's self - these are 
the personal qualities in which man's strength gets most fully manifested. 
A man must have the necessary strength to perform a moral act, to do 
something that is good or bad. He must also have strength to contradict 
the inner forces which are strange to him and which he does not approve. 
In his lectures on ethics Ingarden speaks about the qualitative individ-
uality and uniqueness as a value in itself. When a man keeps his indi-
viduality - he keeps his freedom; he loses it when he becomes like a 
mechanism surrendering to the command of the moment, when he him-
self is not the source of his decisions. However, this value of individ-
uality is not of an absolute character, it involves the danger of a too 
excessive attachment to oneself, which attitude results in the lack of 
freedom. In his conclusions on the relation of man to time, Ingarden 
says that man can persist and be free only when he devotes himself to 
produce goodness, beauty and truth. Then, and only then, he exists 
fully.31 
From other personal values Ingarden mentions (in his lectures on 
ethics) freedom i.e. undertaking decisions conforming with one's own 
conviction (he deals with this subject while discussing the conditions of 
a moral act), intelligence (especially with some moral values this condi-
tion is indispensable) - when it is necessary to recognize the values, to 
be able to foresee the effects of one's own acts and to plan the ways of 
their realizations; with this there is linked an inner criticism which is in 
opposition to the inner dogmatism, the independence of thinking, of 
decisions and acting. Ingarden speaks here also about the value of hap-
piness (which, although not being the condition of moral values, is closely 
linked with them) because there exist the merited happiness and the hap-
piness to which man has no right - e.g. in the sphere of Eros. From the 
'Controversy ... ' one can also infer that the care for one's inner develop-
ment is a value closely linked with the moral sphere (in his lectures on 
ethics, Ingarden speaks about the many-sided development and about 
the depth of interests); it is this very development of the inner character 
that makes man fully human. 32 
The question is whether this development occurs spontaneously or 
whether man must strive for it, whether the development of some po-

84 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
tentialities of his nature belongs to moral duties, is subject to responsi-
bility or whether it lies beyond the sphere of moral acts and presents only 
one of 'natural' personal values. There still remains here a large margin 
of problems connected with negative moral values. Ingarden points to it 
in his lectures on ethics. Negative features are certain qualities estimated 
negatively from the moral point of view: the weakness of character is 
not the same as the lack of strength, intellectual dullness is not merely 
the lack of intelligence, dishonesty is not only the lack of honesty, and 
so on. It can be added that many personal values constituting the basis 
for moral values may be, at the same time, the basis of both negative and 
positive values - the already mentioned strength of man, the ability of 
persistence, inner development, inner integration, etc., all that may spin 
around the moral positive or negative values (when man serves the evil). 
The consideration of all these characteristics of man, though of special 
type, not of moral nature yet, involves many problems which cannot be 
fully discussed here. Some of those characteristics are considered as 
values because of their contribution to the occurrence of other values, 
on account of their being a constitutive element of moral values, as well 
as on account of the possibility to be developed is such a way as to in-
tensify some other values. It may be doubtful if man's individuality, 
uniqueness, qualitative specifity are to be considered as values. If all that 
belongs to the structure of consciousness, if everybody possesses all those 
individual qualities within the framework of human nature, can this be 
called a separate value? Such an approach to the problem reveals many 
unexplained assumptions, such as the fact that man's individuality may 
be annihilated or intensified ('Man and Time'), that the special character-
istic feature of man's nature may be more or less distinct, that it may be 
stressed or suppressed, etc. From Ingarden's examples we may infer that 
all those features considered as personal values must have their own 
proper dimension and that they must occur in common with some other 
factors to be considered as values. 
IV. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MORAL VALUES 
In his lectures on ethics, according to his methodology, Ingarden men-
tions a number of man's qualities called traditionally virtues, generally 
accepted as moral qualities. They may be treated as different kinds of 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
85 
moral values. They are as follows: justice, courage, ability for taking re-
sponsibility, honesty, fidelity, modesty, inner submissiveness, mercy, al-
truism, disinterestedness, self-control; and their negatives, i.e. faults: 
injustice, cowardice, avoiding responsibility, dishonesty, treachery, ex-
aggerated ambition, conceit, haughtiness, selfishness, indifference to-
wards other people's sufferings, mercenariness, lack of self-control, 
wickedness. 
What are those virtues and faults? On the basis of what principles are 
they considered as moral values? Those questions can be answered only 
after a proper analysis of the mode of existence and of the formal struc-
ture of moral values. Ingarden does it in his lectures on ethics and also 
in 'What We Do Not Know about Values'. 
At the beginning some terminological problems must be cleared up: 
Ingarden separates a moral value from a moral conduct. The latter is 
value-creative because it is the source of moral values. It fulfils some 
special conditions to be discussed later. The final factors for the occur-
rence of moral values are: The decision of a conscious subject concerning 
the undertaking of a determined conduct and the acceptance or non-
acceptance of one's own behaviour. But the formal conditions alone are 
insufficient to determine what the value is. Ingarden's attitude in ethics 
is definitely antiformalistic. It is not a set of formal conditions that de-
cides if something is a value or not but a special qualitative determina-
tion differentiating kinds of values and particular species of values within 
a kind. Since Kant's times formalism has become a master of ethical 
considerations. Some traces of formalism Ingarden finds even in Scheler's 
conception of moral values though the latter wanted to oppose himself 
to Kant and create 'material ethics'. 33 Scheler, while defining what a 
moral behaviour is, puts forward two conditions, and namely: An action 
is morally positive if a proper estimation of values not belonging to the 
category of morality has been taken into account and if in a possible 
conflict between values the higher one has been chosen. Thus the moral 
value of human behaviour occurs when a man, having the choice among 
some values (which are not of moral character), chooses the higher one. 
This implies the existence of some other than moral values, and also a 
certain hierarchy among them, recognizable for man. If we know that 
the given value is lower than another one and when we choose the lower 
one, our conduct is morally negative. "A morally positive conduct does 

86 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
not introduce any new separate value, it is only the right 'vorziehen', as 
Acheler puts it - it means the preference of the value A to the value B 
and its realization even in unfavourable circumstances".34 For Ingarden 
this condition is insufficient. When we make a choice between two util-
itarian values, e.g. when we choose between two projects of the regula-
tion of a river, from which the one is advantageous for the building of 
electricity works and the other is moreover favourable for agriculture, 
and when we choose the latter - after Scheler's conception, our conduct 
would be morally valuable. In opposition to this Ingarden states that such 
a choice has nothing to do with moral conduct as it has no impact on 
the subject making the choice, it does not render the subject any better. 35 
By the way it is worth while noting that Ingarden leaves out that con-
dition while listing the conditions of the moral behaviours. 36 That con-
dition, however, seems to be particularly important. The reflex of the 
accomplished act on the person, on the acting subject, on human nature, 
making the man himself better or worse - this is something very charac-
teristic of moral behaviours, of the values belonging to this sphere. 
So, after Ingarden, the formal conditions alone are not enough for the 
occurrence of moral values. A moral value has a specific qualitative de-
termination which decides that the given value is of this or other species, 
e.g. that it is justice, faithfulness, courage, etc. There exists something 
common which characterizes all moral values in the opposition to other 
values, e.g. aesthetic or utilitarian ones. This problem will get clearer in 
the light of Ingarden's considerations on the formal structure of moral 
values ('What We Do Not Know about Values'). Values - moral ones 
included - are not of independent existence, it means that they always 
belong to something. Thus they are not objects and as such, according 
to Ingarden's results of ontological analyses, they cannot be subjects of 
properties. If they are not objects perhaps are they a sort of relation be-
tween objects or are they some properties or qualities of objects? In-
garden states that none of those propositions can be maintained. Values 
must be finally considered as particular characteristics of quite different 
nature and linked with the objects in a completely different way than 
any other properties. 
There are perhaps such values which consist in a certain relation be-
tween one determinate object and another or between a subject and an 
object, but this is certainly not the case with moral or aesthetic values.37 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
87 
They are neither relative nor relational. 38 They are absolute. 'Charm', 
'grace', 'nobleness', are not relations. In everything that exists one may 
distinguish some form, matter and mode of existence. When values are 
concerned there is also to be distinguished a special moment, not en-
countered anywhere else, and namely their 'valuableness' (Wertigkeit) 
which implies the difference between the form of value and the form of 
object which is not a value itself .. In this 'valuableness' of values we may 
distinguish a certain 'height', different in various cases, the 'positiveness' 
or 'negativeness' of values, and also - after Hartmann - their 'strength'. 
Moreover, the valuableness of values includes a certain moment, namely 
the 'obligatoriness', which means that the values ought to exist. This 
obligatoriness of existence depends upon the kind of value: it is different 
in the case of moral values and different in the case of aesthetic or util-
itarian values. 39 As concerns the moral values their obligatoriness is ab-
solute to such an extent that the neglect of their realization results in 
realization of a negative moral value, i.e. the evil. The valuableness of 
moral values depends upon the valuableness of other values because 
both the obligatoriness of moral values and those values themselves are 
conditioned by some other value. Ingarden makes a restriction that this 
characteristic of the valuableness of values has nothing to do with the 
relativity - the question is here in a tight intertwining of different values 
qualitatively determined. Some examples can be found in the consider-
ations (presented in the lectures on ethics) on particular values: to de-
termine a given moral value such as justice, courage, honesty, etc., we 
must unavoidably refer to a number of other values of moral character 
or of different kinds. 
That matter is extremely complicated and raises many theoretical 
doubts. If a moral value is absolute in its obligatoriness and if it contains 
in itself a qualitative determination deciding about its valuableness (e.g. 
'justiceness' of justice, as Ingarden puts it), there suggests itself a con-
clusion that it is a value itself, independently of the existence or non-
existence of any other values. But such a conclusion would go too far 
in the light ofIngarden's considerations. And further on: the realization 
of a certain value occurs only when it is being realized for the purpose 
of the realization of another value: thus, that other value would include 
again in itself the postulate of being realized in view of still another one. 
The only way out of this vicious circle seems to be to admit that a value 

88 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
has a definitive qualitative determination and to assume, at the same 
time, that it is not this determination alone that decides about the value 
but a number of intertwined factors which may be distinguished in the 
structure of the value and which are functionally interrelated. 
Thus, value has a special form which does not occur within any other 
being. If it belongs to something, being both existentially derivative and 
not self-contained, if it cannot appear otherwise than as a moment under-
lain by a number of other moments it 'belongs' to the object in a different 
way than any other property. Because it qualifies the object, it makes 
it valuable, it causes the object to be distinguished by a peculiar 'dignity' 
raising it over other objects deprived of value. 
Ingarden assumes that the moment deciding about the structure of 'a 
value is its matter (i.e. its qualitative determination); it decides about the 
height of value, the way of its existence and of its being conditioned by 
the object to which it belongs. This thesis has been developed and com-
mented in his lectures on ethics. The moral valuableness of an act is 
finally determined by the qualitative determination and not by the set 
of conditions indispensable for an act to be moral. For instance, about 
justice he says: "Justice as such is a certain qualitatively specified de-
termination of the value of a certain decision or conduct." 40 Therefore 
the moral value should be sought in qualitative determinations of human 
acts not in the formal conditions. 
v. THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF MORAL VALUES 
Ingarden stands in opposition to all the theories which consider moral 
values as subjective or relative and according to which there is neither 
good nor evil in the human world: there exist only human estimations 
and conventionally accepted norms. Valuations are derivative from 
values, they have a sense only as far as there exist values. Also the norms 
functioning in social life have a sense only as far as they are formulated 
with respect to values, and their obligatory character. We appraise a 
certain conduct as positively valuable from the moral point of view be-
cause it fulfils certain conditions and is distinguished by the given species 
of valuableness of a special qualitative determination (e.g. honesty is 
characterized by 'honestiness' just like the real green is characterized by 
'greenness'). Even the utilitarian or vital values which are of relational 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
89 
character cannot be fully reduced to the subjective reactions of the sub-
ject. If we say, for instance, that a certain plant is nutritious for a certain 
kind of animal, this means that it possesses a determined nutritive value, 
thanks to which it gets a new peculiar qualification, i.e. value. If we say 
that a special conduct is good or bad, we say so with respect to some 
special characteristics of this conduct and not because of the arbitrary 
decision of the estimator. One of the proofs for the existence of moral 
values is human conscience - a psychic anxiety felt when, estimating our 
own conduct, we get convinced that it was unjust, dishonest, etc. If we 
considered the rightness of our estimation to be a fiction, an arbitrary 
invention, we should not feel any anxiety and the compensation for in-
justice or harm would be an action deprived of every sense. Only be-
cause we find values (and do not invent them) there may arise the problem 
of justice or injustice of our behaviour, that of honesty or dishonesty of 
our conduct, etc. 
Representing the point of view that moral values are objective, In-
garden does not, however, ascribe to them the mode of existence similar 
to that of things; moreover, the mode of existence of values is different 
from that of objects (beings) of any kind, because values are neither real 
nor ideal nor purely intentional objects. The goodness is real, but not 
in the same way as, for instance, this table here. Values are anchored 
in what is real, but their reality is not the same as the reality of human 
psyche or that of bodies. If moral values were purely intentional beings 
or if they were derivative from human estimations, people could not be 
called to account, rewarded or punished, and a great deal of human 
actions would be unjustified. Ingarden manifests here his rationalistic 
attitude (significant for the constructing of ontology) also with regard to 
moral problems (the structure of the real world which is the background 
of moral actions is also rational). Just as the world has its rational struc-
ture, so the human behaviours, socially approved, do not occur arbi-
trarily, casually, disorderly. After this approach, the values in their ob-
jective existence acquire a postulate of rationality of human behaviours. 
Ingarden realizes the tremendous difficulties connected with the defence 
of the objective existence of values. He says that man is keen on the reality 
of values, that we would like to recognize them as such. What is more, 
in the human world the values function as real, and it is proved by the 
fact that man fights for values and is able to die for them. There are a 

90 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
lot of human behaviours which would be irrational or quite absurd if 
the values were recognized as nonexisting, being only a fiction of human 
mind. 
The way of existence of value is relatively independent of the way of 
existence of the bearer of that value. If a value, for instance, is a value 
of something that exists really, it does not mean necessarily that the 
value itself is a real one. If a value is linked with something that is an 
intentional being, it does not mean that the value itself is an intentional 
being either. It is also probable that values exist in various ways, depend-
ing on their kinds, depending on their matter (qualitative determination), 
according to Ingarden's thesis that the basic moment of a value is its 
matter which determines the way of its existence and the height of value. 
Moral values exist perhaps in another way than aesthetic or utilitarian 
values. "The aesthetic value of an aesthetic object (let us remember that 
it is an intentional object - M.G.) as well as the utilitarian values of a 
tool, are in their role of qualifying their bearers conditioned in another 
way than a moral value." 41 Because a moral value has as a basis of its 
existence exclusively the object it qualifies, while an aesthetic value and 
an utilitarian one have as a basis of their existence both the properties 
of their bearers and the subjects (in the case of aesthetic values there is 
concerned a subject perceiving in an aesthetic attitude a work of art, in 
the case of utilitarian values the question is of a subject using a tool). 
Thus, after Ingarden, moral values are set exclusively in the subject 
which is their bearer, in opposition to other values, which have their 
basis of existence both in their bearers and in the perceiving subject. 
Does it mean that a moral value is absolute in that sense that it is depen-
dent upon nothing but the subject (its acting, its personality)? Ingarden's 
suggestions follow this direction although some considerations may be 
mentioned which seem to admit the participation of some extra-subjec-
tive factors in the constitution of moral values. The considerations in 
question concern mainly justice. 
To determine the way of existence of moral values, two questions 
should be taken into account: the way of existence of the bearers of 
values and the way in which values are founded in the objects they 
qualify.42 Supporters of the axiological relativism tend to assume that 
values are founded in something else beside their bearer; they assume 
that if an object is real, the values qualifying it are also real. On the 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
91 
other hand they assume that if values are founded not only in the object 
- the bearer of values - but also in something else, their connection with 
the object is somewhat 'looser', the values are relative then. Ingarden 
challenges those assumptions. There are some arguments for the view 
that values - at least some of them - exist in another way than their 
bearers. For instance, the moral values qualifying human acts and re-
alized in the course of human life are not the objects persisting in time, 
changing, developing, though their bearers are of such character (e.g., 
honesty, disinterestedness, heroism - though they occur in changing 
human acts - they themselves exist in another way, they do not sink into 
the past once an act and its consequences have ceased to exist, they do 
not change). 
The moral value of a given act originates at the moment of its accom-
plishment 43 - at that moment a man gains a merit or becomes guilty. 
There are also such moral values (connected with man's character, his 
talent, skills, knowledge or experience) which get annihilated at the mo-
ment of death of the man who is their bearer. Such are the facts; the 
question of the mode of existence of moral values concerns their exis-
tence from the moment they emerge to the moment they become anni-
hilated. Ingarden asks: "Should they be considered as changeable and 
transient in time like everything that is real - or should they be recog-
nized as something not submitted to change in time in its mode of exis-
tence? Does the value of an act pass in the same way as the act itself 
( ... ) or does it last when the act is over?" 44 
This problem is closely linked with the question of the bearer of moral 
values (as we have seen, Ingarden takes into consideration three possi-
bilities: it is the human person, his acts and behaviour, or an act of will). 
If it is an act or an activity that is the bearer of value, the question arises 
whether the value perishes when the act is done. Does the value of a 
person get annihilated with the death of the man? Does the value of a 
decision, of an act of will exist only at the moment of the decision? 
Though a definite answer to those questions cannot be given in the present 
state of analyses, it seems probable that values have the character of 
extra-temporal persistence. This is, after Ingarden, the condition of re-
sponsibility: if a man is responsible for his act this is because the value 
of that act does not pass with the moment of its accomplishment, it is 
more lasting. The trace of a merit or a guilt remains in man, i.e. the trace 

92 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
of something that is positively or negatively valuable. Who has com-
mitted a crime or a heroic act remains a criminal or a hero, and only 
under this condition does a reward or a punishment have any sense. The 
condition of bearing responsibility is that one is identical with the man 
who has committed the crime and that the value of the given act con-
tinues to exist. 
To determine the special mode of existence of moral values, Ingarden 
refers to the thesis that it is the 'obligatory' character of values that is 
specific for them, that one cannot say that they exist but rather that "they 
are valid" (Lotze) or that they "ought to exist" (Rickert). 45 As a result 
of the critical estimate of this view (one cannot speak of the validity or 
obligatoriness of something that does not exist), Ingarden states that this 
obligatory character may be ascribed to values in a special sense. The 
fact that the moral values exist, introduces a new state of things which 
is in itself a realization of a positive value. But when Scheler states that 
the existence of a positive value is already a positive value, he goes too 
far: after Ingarden, no new value emerges then but "the valuableness of 
a realized value includes in itself, as it were, the existence of the value, 
or putting it better, it has in this existence one of its foundation, therefore 
it has its source not only in the very matter of the value, but also in the 
fact of its realization." 46 Thus the view concerned here seems to be that 
a certain value is a moral one not only because it possesses a certain 
matter, i.e. qualitative determination, but also thanks to the fact that it 
has been realized, that a 'command', a 'duty' or an obligation has been 
fulfilled. Therefore a moral value exists only and as far as it is realized 
in a real act or a person. 
vI. CONDITIONS OF MORAL CONDUCT 
Ingarden makes a preliminary list of conditions which must be fulfilled 
for human conduct to be included in the sphere of moral behaviours; 
these are at the same time the conditions of the realization of values 
commonly called virtues.47 Are those conditions satisfactory or only 
necessary? This question can be answered, after Ingarden, only when 
some particular analyses have been carried out. It may tum out that a 
certain conduct does not fulfil those conditions; in this case this does 
not mean that the conduct does not belong to the sphere of moral be-

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
93 
haviours; perhaps if it were possible to find similar examples, something 
in those conditions should have to be changed. This is a preliminary list 
including what is most obvious when the foundations of human moral 
behaviours are concerned. Ingarden formulates the six basic conditions 
of moral behaviour, and namely: 
(1) Participation of a conscious subject in acting, which means that a 
conscious subject must manage its conduct and recognize some facts as 
well as values. This requires the existence of both a subject of acting and 
its consciousness. Where there is no consciousness one cannot speak of 
a moral conduct. Neither is a conduct to be estimated morally when a 
man is mentally diseased, when his consciousness becomes dissociated, 
when he has no feeling of identity and of the unity of himself as an acting 
subject. In moral behaviour there must be made a conscious choice of 
a certain conduct. 
(2) Conduct of a conscious subject, understood in a large meaning of 
this word as inner or outer behaviour. In a particular case it will be an 
action introducing some changes in the world. Here belongs, as one can 
suppose, the 'inner act' discussed in the article 'Man and Time'. The ex-
amples analyzed by Ingarden seem to admit the following interpretation: 
the moral values are realized not only in an outer action but also when 
man undertakes a decision only for himself, when he makes a resolution, 
e.g., when he decides to be faithful to his ideals. However, if Ingarden 
assumes that various moral values may be linked with various sides of 
man, one must ask whether this condition is valid for all values, whether 
in the case of a value found in a person, the value in question emerges 
in an action of the subject (more generally, in his behaviour)? It is pos-
sible that a moral value emerges when an action of the subject takes 
place, when he takes a decision, when he changes his attitude, when he 
gets moved, when he becomes conscious of something, when he experi-
ences an inner struggle, etc. Ingarden speaks of a psychic action, e.g. 
when one is forgiving something which act has a moral value. The psychic 
behaviour occurring here is not always linked with a psycho-physical 
one (sometimes merely a certain action is given up, e.g. an act of ven-
geance planned before). Undoubtedly, various moral values fulfil this 
condition in various ways. For instance, speaking about honesty, In-
garden says that though honesty is a feature of a person belonging to 
the so-called features of character, if it had never been manifested in an 

94 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
exterior behaviour of a man there would be no reason to ascribe it to 
him.48 And one may ask if it is only the manifestation of certain moral 
values that depends on external situations, if it is not also their very ex-
istence that is conditioned by the external, casual circumstances? 
(3) In a moral conduct there must be involved some values. They may 
be of different kinds, i.e. vital, economical, cultural, or also moral. For 
instance, in justice there is the question of assigning some goods to some-
one; in courage one aims at the realization or protecting of some vital 
values (e.g. life), of utilitarian or cultural ones (if a man persisted in his 
opinions in spite of a physical or a psychical danger, not having in view 
any values, such a conduct would be nonsensical, it would have no char-
acter of moral behaviour, there would be no real courage then, at best 
its semblance, if anything, or venturesomeness). 
(4) The assumption of responsibility for the undertaken conduct. If 
someone's conduct has the appearance of courage but it has taken place 
under conditions in which the man is not responsible for it, the moral 
value in question, i.e. courage, has not been realized. There is no merit 
in that man's action. With the idea of responsibility there is linked a 
recognition of some merit or guilt (followed by punishment); a respon-
sible conduct affects its author in a positive or a negative way. The 
question of responsibility has been considered by Ingarden in a pretty 
detailed way.49 He treats this phenomenon more comprehensively than 
only in the aspect of moral values. What conditions must be fulfilled for 
responsibility to be spoken of at all, for a man to be made responsible 
for his behaviour and conduct? Ingarden seeks those conditions in the 
structure of the world and in that of man's psyche, of his conscious life. 
To personal conditions there belong, among other things, the identity 
of the acting subject in time and his freedom; on the other hand, there 
is decisive the structure of the world (as far as it admits any changes and 
provides a possibility for a free act of man). If the world were ruled by 
determinism there would be no real freedom and one could say that man 
is responsible for his acts (because he would be acting under the force 
of circumstances). 
On the one hand, Ingarden speaks of responsibility as a condition of 
moral behaviour in general, and on the other hand, he treats it as one 
of moral values (virtues).50 There may be distinguished four situations 
in which responsibility manifests itself: (a) someone bears responsibility 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
95 
for something, he is for something responsible; (b) someone takes re-
sponsibility for something; (c) someone is called to account for some-
thing; (d) someone acts with responsibility. 51 Here one may speak of 
responsibility as a fact: a man is responsible because he is called to ac-
count, he gets rewarded or punished, he feels qualms of conscience or 
an inner satisfaction at the accomplished act. One may also speak of re-
sponsibility as a value: when a man, feeling responsible for his decisions 
and acts, performs them in such a way as to be ready to accept all the 
consequences of them and when he really accepts them. 
(5) The freedom of decision and conduct. A man must be free in his 
decisions and conduct; if he acts under force he does not accomplish 
any moral act. This is, at the same time, a condition of responsibility. 
If one is to be responsible for his conduct he must have the possibility 
to back out of an undertaken action, he must have a free choice in every 
moment. The freedom itself is considered as a value belonging to the 
sphere of personal values. 
Ingarden analyses in his lectures the sense of the concept of freedom. 
In philosophy and ethics there dominates a negative concept of freedom: 
as a freedom from something, from the causal determination, from low, 
from social norms; in the intellectual sphere a freedom from dogmas, 
superstitions, authorities. Besides, freedom may be distinguished as a 
well known phenomenon of everyday life. It is therefore necessary to 
detect the phenomenon of a real freedom of man and differentiate it 
from the feeling of freedom as well as from the conditions indispensable 
for man to be free. 
For Ingarden man's freedom does not lie in the want of determination, 
freedom does not mean being free from the external conditioning; free-
dom which has any importance in the moral sphere is not a freedom from 
necessities forced on someone by the external world. In his acting man 
must take the world into consideration. Every situation gives many pos-
sibilities of acting; man's decisions and acts should be a reasonable re.., 
action to what happens in the world. Ingarden says that to postulate 
man's independence of the situation in which his action is to take place 
is an ontological and moral mistake. 
The question of freedom and responsibility is closely connected with 
that of the structure of the world. If we assume after Laplace that the 
world is one consistent system of causal relations and that every event 

96 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
is determined by the previous state of the world we must acknowledge 
that in a world constructed like that there is no place for real acting, no 
place for freedom. Ingarden represents another point of view: the world 
is a unity of systems relatively isolated; the decision of the subject to 
undertake an act is not determined by the state of the whole world but 
it is confined within a given (relatively independent) system. Acts of de-
cisions are determined by a certain arrangement of states of things oc-
curring in man's environment and by a certain arrangement of facts oc-
curring in his psyche. The problem if the will is free is to be discussed 
in another way: as a matter of fact, it is not the question if the will is 
free (because the will is always partly determined) but the question is if 
it is my own will and if I mean something in the world as a subject of 
acts. The outer and inner determination always exist within certain 
limits, beyond those limits there may be some place for my own will. 
Man is partly determined by the world but, at the same time, not every-
thing that occurs in him is determined. After this conception, there is 
good reason for attributing to man the freedom of action and responsi-
bility. Thus man becomes one of such wholes, one of the systems rela-
tively isolated from the rest of the world: he allows reactions with the 
outer world, he is partly determined but, at the same time, he is himself 
a source, of changes he introduces into the world. 
The source of decisions and the basis of responsibility is the 'ego', the 
person. The person is the source of both making up one's mind and up-
holding the decision in the course of action. Ingarden supposes that one 
of the conditions of moral acts is disinterestedness of conduct (however, 
he does not state unhesitatingly that this is the case with all kinds of 
moral values). An obvious condition of the occurrence of moral values 
is the existence of the bearer of those values, i.e. the person. 
Are those conditions satisfactory? Ingarden does not judge it be-
forehand. A definite solution of these questions could be obtained only 
after a thorough analysis of possibly many different moral values. Apart 
from the fulfilling of these conditions the moral conduct is characterized 
by a special qualitative determination '(discussed above) which makes a 
given conduct, e.g. just, brave, honest, faithful. 
From this there may be inferred a conclusion concerning the way of 
cognition of moral values: they are given finally in experience, of course 
in a specific one, i.e. in a moral experience, in an experience of values. 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
97 
Just as it is impossible to learn an aesthetic value, e.g. the beauty of a 
given work of art, by merely enumerating the formal conditions fulfilled 
by it and one must perceive and experience that beauty, so is the case 
also with moral values; for example, it may be stated beyond every doubt 
that a given conduct fulfils the conditions of a moral conduct yet, at the 
same time, it is deprived of the specific qualitative determination that 
would make it morally valuable. Such are the consequences of the 'ma-
terial' ethics. Therefore studies on a large scale should be undertaken to 
investigate the experience of moral values and to determine the specific 
reactions-responses to various values belonging to a determined group 
(of this response to values Ingarden speaks after Hildebrandt in 'What 
We Do Not Know about Values'). Could the reaching of that specific 
experience alone enable us to see which of the experiences in question 
are valid and which are illusive? 
VII. THE FOUNDA TION THE MORAL VALUES HAVE IN THE 
PROPER TIES OF AN OBJECT 
The problem of the foundation the moral values find in the objective 
states of things belongs to the most essential questions concerning values 
and it implies important methodological consequences; the way of posing 
those problems suggests the direction of investigating the particular 
ethical problems and presents an analogy with the way of approaching 
similar problems in aesthetics. As aesthetics has been elaborated by In-
garden in a much more detailed way, it may supply some hints and be 
of use to explain some questions which have not been finally explained 
in the sphere of ethics. The fundamental statement here is that values 
are not self-contained in relation to the object they qualify. The value 
therefore - as it has been already said - exists if, and as far as there 
exists an object which "can meet the existential heterarchy of the value 
by supplying it, as a foundation, with such properties as would be suf-
ficient for the embodiment of a certain quality of value." 52 This is a 
complementary factor which removes the existential heterarchy of value, 
supplying, at the same time, a necessary condition for the actual emer-
gence of a value of a given quality (matter). It is therefore necessary to 
find an answer to the question what this factor really is, to make sure, 
at the same time, if a value really qualifies an object. This problem is 

98 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
especially important in the sphere of values - moral and aesthetic ones 
- because there exists a commonly known phenomenon of illusion; there 
is the danger of accepting illusionary values, the danger of 'experiencing' 
the values which do not really exist. There arises therefore the question 
if a value given in experience has a sufficient foundation in the object 
which seems to be its bearer. It is known that what is given in experience 
as disinterestedness, faithfulness, honesty, may have in reality the qual-
ifications morally negative; what causes delight is not always really 
beautiful; what causes our moral approval need not always be approv-
able. With the acceptance of the thesis that values have their foundation 
in the properties of an object, it is possible to find a test enabling us to 
determine if something which appears in experience as a value (moral 
or aesthetic one) is of such a character in reality. To make sure - In-
garden says - if a value has a satisfactory and, at the same time, an 
indispensable foundation in an object, there must be found in this object 
those properties which, while occurring in it, imply the appearance in 
reality of a given quality. Two questions are here concerned: first of all, 
one must know what kind of properties of an object must be realized 
for it to be a satisfactory foundation for a value of a certain quality 
(matter). In other words, there must be sought here "a necessary and, 
at the same time, a satisfactory correlation between a certain selection 
of properties of a possible bearer of values and the values of a determined 
quality." 53 If one accepted the thesis that there is no necessary correla-
tion between the qualities then the conclusion should be also accepted 
that the appearing value has no effective foundation in the object which 
underlies it. Such a standpoint, after Ingarden, would be unjustified. But 
the acceptance of the point of view that values in every case have their 
foundation in an object would be unjustified as well. This question needs 
some -detailed analyses to state in the case of occurrence of values what 
properties (if any) of the corresponding object entail their occurrence 
and are related to them in a necessary way. The next question would be 
if the object changes the matter of value or annihilates this value. Those 
analyses may lead to the answer to the question "if and to what an equip-
ment of the object there corresponds a given value, what necessary and 
satisfactory conditioning in those properties it requires and can be sat-
isfied in its requirement." 54 
Another methodological postulate is an investigation of these prob-

ROMAN INGARDEN'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY 
99 
lems in the case of particular objects: works of art as to aesthetic values, 
and moral facts as to ethical values. Such analyses would be of impor-
tance for the construction and enrichment of a positive knowledge of art 
and morality. 
The method of finding the properties of an object which is a bearer 
of values and of stating the necessary connection and relations between 
them is applied by Ingarden fully in his analyses concerning aesthetical 
values. This direction of investigations has also been followed in the 
fragments of ethics worked out by him. In particular, there has been laid 
out a perspective of investigating the laws of co-occurrence of different 
ethical values and of their co-realization. In some cases some values can 
be realized simultaneously, in other cases they exclude one another - the 
realization of one value makes impossible the realization of another one, 
etc. It happens that in order to realize one value one must destroy an-
other one. It can also occur that one value cannot be realized without a 
previous realization of another one. This problem is very important for 
the investigation of values of one kind (e.g., moral values of different 
varieties) as well as of values of different kinds (e.g. is this always the 
case that what is good in the moral sense is at the same time useful ?) 
As an example of a detailed research of moral problems may serve the 
analysis of justice. Justice is usually treated as a social value par excel-
lence; such an attitude goes too far, after Ingarden, because it is possible 
to pass a judgement in a just way and it would be unjust in itself, and 
vice versa. The mistake does not mean injustice here because justice as 
a moral value is linked directly with the motivation of the decision, 
whereas the fact that justice takes place in the proceedings of human 
interactions has a secondary character. It is also assumed that justice is 
a social virtue because for its realization at least two persons are needed 
for goods to be divided between them. But Ingarden states that I myself 
may be a partner beside someone else and what is more I myself can be 
an object and a subject of justice. I can evaluate and judge myself, and 
give a verdict on myself. Then, though I am the only partner of justice, 
there comes to the opposition between the 'ego' accomplishing the act 
of justice and the 'ego' identical with the person who is being judged. 
There exist many kinds of inner conflicts and in them there occur deci-
sions of moral character. An act objectively just need not be, at the same 
time, an act subjectively just, and vice versa (i.e. an act objectively just 

100 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
may be subjectively unjust, when the motive of action is not the accom-
plishment of an act of justice but vengeance, comfort, business, etc.). A 
moral value gets realized by a just act if it is both objectively and sub-
jectively just. It implies therefore some determined personal values: 
ability of foreseeing the effects of an act, recognition of a given situation 
and therefore intelligence, impartiality, etc. Further conditions for a just 
act to be a moral value are disinterestedness of the person performing a 
just act, the exclusion of compulsion, freedom of decision, and readiness 
to take up responsibility for the decision, etc. 
VIII. MORAL VALUES IN AN ETHICAL SITUATION 
The considerations on Ingarden's ethical researches may be completed 
with an attempt at a new explanation of the elements of his theory. It 
seems useful from the methodological point of view to devise a model of 
an ethical situation. 5 5 Thanks to this device a greater methodological 
clearness may be achieved (systematization and schematization of 
elements, determination of the superior whole, insight into the con-
nections between the distinguished elements) and a facilitation in deter-
mining the subject of ethics as a science. 
Let us take as a starting point the graphic schema on p. 101 presenting 
the 'ethical situation'. 
The proPer subject of research in ethics may be an ethical situation, 
consisting of three essential elements: the acting man, his acts and the 
results of those acts. Some determinate conditions are necessary for an 
ethical situation to occur, otherwise the above mentioned elements (re-
ally existing) acquire a different, not ethical meaning (e.g. an abnormal 
man cannot be author of a morally valuable act). Those elements of the 
situation get their proper ethical meaning only in determinate condi-
tions, moreover (and first. of all, because those conditions are only in-
dispensable and not sufficient) with reference to a determinate system of 
values considered as a reference system (those elements get a morally 
valuable character by their reference to and connection with values; if 
values were considered as fictions all problems of morality would come 
down). 
Ethics should also consider what in detailed researches is given di-
rectly, intuitively and really: actual activity. This activity involves the

Changes in the real world, realization of good or evil, taking of 
responsibility, changes in personality 
conditions, the values and the basic elements (together with derivative 
elements, such as ability of acting on the part of the subject, measures 
taken for realization and the model of attempted changes). Thus the 
problems of morality are being considered with reference to concrete 
reality. Ingarden writes on that subject: "In the matter of bearing or 
taking responsibility I cannot confine myself to the pure 'ego' and to 
the pure experience. It must be a real acting in a real world; the whole 
man with his definite character must be taken into consideration. Only 
the reality of an act permits us to speak of responsibility of its author 
at all. The accomplishment of an act is conditioned in two ways: (1) by 
the real circumstances in which the act takes place (real causes in the 
world) and (2) by the acting human nature shaped at the moment of the 
act (where the body has also an influence on the course of the act)." 56 
There is still one problem, which I think should be considered here. 

102 
MARIA GOLASZEWSKA 
One could think that Ingarden's theory has an individualistic shade, that 
it takes too little into consideration the social character of moral values. 
Ingarden's theses seem not to deny that social aspect of morality. Firstly, 
he does not deal with the genesis of moral values (where, as it seems, the 
social aspect is most obvious); secondly, Ingarden himself considered 
his work as only a preliminary investigation of those problems from the 
ontological point of view, whereas more detailed investigations and 
analyses must lead necessarily to the sphere of social reality, as man's 
acts - and also ethical qualifications of those acts - take place in a social 
environment. In most cases they concern the community (they are di-
rected to the community, the changes refer to the community, and be-
sides the community estimates those acts as to their moral quality).

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY* 
Ingarden was one of the closest and most devoted disciples of Edmund 
Husserl. 1 But this does not mean that he submitted completely to his 
teacher's thinking. It is characteristic of the 'phenomenological school' 
and at the same time to a much lesser degree tragic that Hussed did not 
have disciples who were willing to continue directly on his path. There 
were times, when Hussed was rightfully stating "Phenomenology, that 
means myself and Heidegger"; there were times when Hussed expressed 
his sadness about Ingarden's philosophical disagreements with him; 2 
and there were times, close to the end of Husserl's life, when he wrote 
about his concern that 'philosophy is in jeopardy' and that only a con-
centration on its historical aspects would be able to save it. 3 From a 
broader perspective, Heidegger and Ingarden are among the most 
prominent offspring from Hussed's phenomenological 'school' which 
taught all its many students that one could not learn the phenomeno-
logical method from books and that one should return 'to the objects 
themselves' (zu den Sachen selbst), so that one can learn to see, observe, 
describe, and analyze nature's phenomena without prejudice. 
Max Scheler, Moritz Geiger, and Nicolai Hartmann called Hussed's 
method one-sided because of its primarily subject-related interpretation 
of phenomena. Geiger even proposed in 1914 that Hussed's phenom-
enology of action (Aktphiinomenologie) be supplemented with a phenom-
enology of the object (Gegenstandsphiinomenologie). But it is Heidegger 
who still in his Sein und Zeit (1927) repeats the slogan of Hussed's phe-
nomenology: zu den Sachen selbst. The object (Sache) is not to be under-
stood as a static thing, but rather as a phenomenon which establishes 
its existence as a logical object (Gegenstand) only through the manner 
of its identity with itself and the particular perception by the observing 
individual. The individual perceives the object always as a subject by 
taking regress to the analysis of the 'intentional acts' performed by the 
perceiving individual's consciousness. Husserl's primary concern has al-
ways been to show that phenomenology has overcome the division be-

tween the existing object and the perceiving subject. For Husserl the 
action of the interpreting individual and the existence of the object hav.e 
been interrelated so that an immense new field of activity was opened 
by the phenomenological approach to philosophical studies. 
Husserl, who was a disciple of Franz Brentano, moved in his intellec-
tual development from the descriptive and empirical psychologism of his 
teacher to a transcendental phenomenology with idealistic leanings to-
ward neo-Kantianism. Husserl's idealism is to be understood as a dis-
trust in the prevalence of theoretical constructs. His philosophy is di-
rected against the self-confidence of psychologistic positivism which 
manifested itself in the mechanics, that were thought to be governing 
the elements of the imagination, and in the theory of archetypal images 
(Abbilder) which was to solve the problem of cognition (Erkenntnis) 
Hussed sees in the 'intentional act' (intentionaler Akt) an act of individ-
ual perception which constitutes itself in direct relation to the evidence 
available to the observing subject. Without the observing subject's search 
for meaning, the observed object will not fulfil the observer's expectation 
for meaning. Therefore, the objects are not conceived as objective objects 
within a transcendental framework but, rather, the objects are subjec-
tively perceived by the observer as fulfilling certain characteristics which 
can be 'recognized' (erschaut) directly (unmittelbar) through the ob-
server's individual 'intentional act' of perception which establishes the 
meaning of the specific object. 
The emergence of Husserl's phenomenology has to be understood 
primarily as a polemic reaction against positivism (mostly associated in 
those days with the philosophy of David Hume), and only secondarily 
against the dogmatic outgrowths from neo-Kantianism. Husserl claimed 
that his phenomenology was 'the real positivism' which would lead via 
his 'reduction' back to the objects as they present themselves as indepen-
dent phenomena to the observer. Husserl's phenomenological or 'tran-
scendental reduction' (transzendentale Reduktion), therefore, abolishes 
all pre-established ideas about an object so that the pure phenomenon 
can be studied without prejudice. Husserl's phenomenological reduction 
does intentionally not seek to establish another dogmatic system. It 
rather tries to investigate the richness of the available phenomena with 
a neutral method. The result of such a method cannot be a clear-cut and 
dogmatic system but instead an inventory of perceived examples of evi-

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
107 
dence which leads, in the last consequence, to the question of the tran-
scendental subjectivity (transzendentale Subjektivitiit) as the source for 
all meaning. Husserl wanted to be an honest philosopher, for him hon-
esty had to manifest itself in the acceptance of a transcendental phenom-
enology which constantly referred itself to Kant. Furthermore, Husserl 
insisted to bring the idea of transcendental philosophy to a full and 
universal completion by surpassing Kant's dissolution of the contrast 
between realism and idealism through his more direct observation of the 
phenomena themselves. 
Ingarden followed Husserl's thinking to this point, and he made the 
problem of idealism and realism the center of his philosophical writings 
even though Husserl never considered this problem a major issue. As 
early as 1918 Ingarden decided that he could not accept Husserl's tran-
scendental idealism because it seemed no longer to cover satisfactorily 
the 'eidetic' phenomenology and especially the closely related problem 
of ontology. Consequently, Husserl's transcendental phenomenology 
was declared with all respect to be prejudicial and inadequate. From 
now on the 'problem of the existence of the world' became Roman In-
garden's major philosophical concern. 4 Ingarden's disagreement with 
Husserl on this subject is profound. He considered his own method "as 
the methodically exclusively correct approach to the problem" 5 and 
henceforth the disagreement between both philosophers concerning the 
problem of idealism and realism, transcendence and immanence, essence 
of an object and empirical experience of an object by an individual has 
deepened considerably, especially since we do not know in detail what 
the third volume of Ingarden's major work on this subject offers as an 
answer to this question. One observation is certainly correct at this time, 
namely that Ingarden has mapped the course for the philosophical in-
vestigation of the idealism-realism problem. The first results are already 
beginning to show in interdisciplinary systems approaches to the question 
of ontology. 
The groundwork for Ingarden's more analytical and therefore typ-
ically philosophical major work was laid already in early publications 
like the article 'Essentielle Fragen' 6 and in the more descriptive but 
nevertheless philosophical masterwork Das literarische Kunstwerk. 7 Lit-
erature and the work of art in general playa most significant role in In-
garden's philosophy and aesthetics. For him the work of art contains 

108 
HANS H. RUDNICK 
'purely intentional objects' which do not have a direct equivalent in the 
world of reality. The literary work exists as 'fiction' with no objective 
reality in itself nor in the observer. The characteristics of 'fiction' keep 
the literary work of art in limbo between the identity with itself and the 
limited intersubjective variants of its meaning. The work of art exists in 
a quasi-reality which is called by Ingarden the 'heteronomy of being' 
(Seinsheteronomie). In his effort to explain this heteronomy of being as 
it reveals itself in the literary work of art, Ingarden presents a funda-
mental-ontology (Fundamental Ontologie) which in a larger context is 
designed to solve the dispute about the existence of the world on the 
basis of the fundamental structures of all objects and the fundamental 
relations that can be established by an observer of an object. Ingarden 
proceeds to submit all philosophical terms, which are generally accepted 
by other philosophers, to a thorough eidetic analysis since he rejects 
Husserl's transcendental reduction as circular. Ingarden favors the eidetic 
reduction which rests all its insights on the evidence of the objects in the 
world in which the observer lives. 
Therefore, Ingarden's major philosophical concern remains directed 
toward the larger problem of idealism and realism. What makes Ingarden 
a major aesthetician is his epistemological concern which applies itself 
to the heteronomous structure of the literary work of art. Ingarden 
decided that an investigation of the literary work with its fictitious char-
acteristics would offer the most rewarding answers to his larger concern. 
The route which Ingarden was determined to take was intended to lead 
him via the work of art to ontology, that larger network of meaning 
which would constitute its reality on the basis of clearly observable 
evidence. 
To take such a work-orientated road toward the philosophical inter-
pretation of meaning in our modem world is not surprising even if it 
might at first sight seem so. Husserl, who was a mathematician rather 
than a philosopher as far as his education was concerned, seems to have 
directed his students' attention accidentally toward the function of lan-
guage in his Cartesian Meditations. Ingarden's response to Husserl's 
thoughts on this subject seems indicative of this influence. 8 Other Husserl 
students like Heidegger and Hans Lipps have also based an important 
portion of their philosophical premises on a special study of language. 
Every one of these thinkers has recognized that all human insight and 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
109 
all processes of thought are obtained from within the framework of the 
universality of language. Language is the linguistic tool with which the 
schematization of the experience of the world can be attained. Language 
thus becomes the focus of philosophical attention; and phenomenologists 
take frequent recourse to an etymologically interpretative and figura-
tively descriptive approach to meaning in order to illustrate the inten-
tional acts of artistic language which reflect the broader anonymous 
intentions underlying the otherwise inaccessible 'life-world' (Lebens-
welt). 
Because of Ingarden's primary interest in the problem of realism and 
idealism, his analyses of literary language given in The Literary Work 
of Art are actually only of secondary importance from the philosopher's 
point of view. Ingarden is really searching for 'ideal and autonomous' 
notions which he finds to be revealing their existence in the nature of 
the language used in a literary work of art. Ingarden investigates the 
actual and potential range of a word's meaning,9 and he describes the 
intersubjective identity of the sentence and its ontic foundation of 
being 10 with the objective of proving the existence of 'ideal notions'. He 
thinks that only in this way the language of the literary artwork with 
its basic similarities as a means of communication and its differences as 
to its function can establish a corresponding conciseness of language as 
contained in the 'scientific report'.l1 For Ingarden, there is no other 
way to save the language of the literary work of art from sheer subject-
ivism. 
Ingarden follows Husserl when he speaks of the multi-Iayeredness of 
the literary work. The layers are sound, meaning, presented objects, and 
schematized opinion. 12 However, Ingarden uses Husserl's strata system 
against Husserl's own transcendental idealism by claiming autonomy of 
being not only for the world of objects but also for the logical constructs 
even though the logical constructs as intentional acts do vary with regard 
to the observer's ability of awareness as Husserl had already pointed out. 
Ingarden disregards Husserl's modifying statement since he relies 
strongly on the assumption that the literary work of art is not only a 
phenomenological entity but at the same time an ontological entity 
which reveals 'purely intentional objectivations' (rein intentionale Gegen-
stiindlichkeiten) characterizing the abstract essence of an object within the 
framework of its concrete existence. In his The Controversy about the 

110 
HANS H. RUDNICK 
Existence of the World Ingarden distinguishes modes of being from 
moments of being. 13 Again we find the familiar division into four major 
groups in each instance. The modes of being refer (a) to the absolute and 
timeless being, (b) to the ideal being, (c) to the time-related real being, 
and (d) to the purely intentional, the potentiality of, being. 
There are four mutually exclusive components of being, (a) the au-
tonomy of being and the heteronomy of being, (b) self-sufficiency of 
being and absence of self-sufficiency of being, (c) independence of being 
and absence of independence of being, and (d) originality of being and 
derivation from being. As indicated above, the components of each pair 
are considered to be mutually exclusive because of the rules of ideal 
ontological composition which seem to determine a priori how the mo-
ments of being have to be structurally arranged. Another important 
factor in this system is the structure of the time sequence which is also 
governed by the events that constitute the structure of being. However, 
at this point it appears not advisable to speculate about the ultimate 
framework of Ingarden's epistemological phenomenology as it may 
present itself in the still not completely published The Controversy about 
the Existence of the World. It is better to focus our attention on The 
Literary Work of Art because in this work Ingarden's well-developed 
ideas about the nature of literature and aesthetics are illustrated in an 
exemplary fashion. 
In The Literary Work of Art Ingarden wants to demonstrate that the 
literary work of art is an 'intentional object' created by an artist. Such 
an intentional object is considered to be the model of a material object 
as it exists in the reality of the world. Here lies already the profound 
difference to HusserI who considered even material objects as intentional 
objects because they were given their existence through the perception 
of the observing individual. Such an interpretation, which negates any 
existence of material objects to the perception of man, is considered by 
Ingarden as a grave error. 14 Ingarden wants to show that the work of 
art is a schematized entity created by an artist with the intention that 
the work of art will become an object of aesthetic pleasure for the ob-
server. The observer, on the other hand, has also to contribute important 
parts of his experience of life to the interpretative process. The observer 
has to perform the 'concretization' (Konkretisation) which relates the 
abstract intentional object created by the artist to the material object of 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
111 
which it is a model. The aesthetic object, therefore, contains three major 
constituents. Firstly, there is the existence of the material object in na-
ture; secondly, there is the creating artist's abstracted model of the 
material object, the so-called intentional object; and thirdly, there is the 
recreating observer who reduces in his mind through his own concretiza-
tion the abstract model of the material object, which has been created 
by the artist, back to the original object in nature. 
The only really independent entity in this system is the material world. 
It has its own reality, whereas the intentional object, the work of art, is 
from the beginning of its existence removed from this reality by the 
creative act of the artist. The observer, in his effort to understand 
the work of art, will then have to use all his experience in order to 
relate the intentional object to the material object in the concretization 
process. 
If the operation of the concretization process is examined closely, it 
is still obvious that Ingarden's primary concern about realism and ide-
alism shines through. For Ingarden the literary work of art refers to a 
given reality. It is the observer's task to concretize the model which it 
represents into concrete reality. It is also obvious at this point why In-
garden cannot accept Husserl's transcendental idealism which does not 
pennit such a direct relation to the material object. On the other hand, 
it should also be pointed out that in spite of Ingarden's strong rejection 
of Husserl's transcendental idealism, he never adopted empiricism, ma-
terialism, or neo-positivism; the latter of which he always vehemently 
attacked, while he kept his opposition to the others mostly silent, but 
obvious enough for those who wanted to see. 
In all of Ingarden's philosophy of art three basic premises will always 
recur. Firstly, it will continually be stated that the work of art is an in-
tentional object. Secondly, the work of art will always be divided into 
'strata' (Schichten). Thirdly, the observer, listener, or reader will have 
to perfonn the concretization process in order to relate the intentional 
object to the material object. The work of art itself as an intentional 
object has no independent existence with relation to concrete reality. But 
the work of art is by itself autonomous. As soon as the question of reality 
arises, the work of art as an 'artifact', is an intentional object created 
by an artist. The work of art as intentional object has its basis in the 
material object of which the work of art is a model created by an indi-

112 
HANS H. RUDNICK 
vidual. The work of art, therefore, cannot be an ideal object with con-
sistent qualities which are so typical for the definition of geometrical 
objects like the circle. 
The literary work of art contains the most elaborate stratification of 
all works of art in Ingarden's system. If the strata should be neglected 
during the concretization process, incorrect interpretations of the rela-
tion of the work to reality will occur with the result that a wrong meaning 
will be attributed to the work of art by the observer since the basic re-
lation which "constitutes" the bond between the macrophysical idea of 
the material object and the microphysical idea of the intentional object 
has been misrepresented. 
Ingarden posits that there are four strata in a literary work of Art: (1) 
the sound of the words, (2) the meaning of the sentences which has been 
established by combining words (The layer of meanings), (3) the repre-
sented objects themselves as they are shown in the work of art by the 
artist (The layer of represented objects), (4) the schematized aspects of 
the objects presented by the artist in the work of art (The layer of sche-
matized views). Rene Wellek claims 15 that Ingarden has divided the lit-
erary work of art into five strata. The fifth stratum is supposed to be 
the stratum of 'metaphysical qualities' comprising 'the sublime, the 
tragic, the terrible, the holy'. However, Ingarden has emphatically and 
repeatedly rejected the existence of a fifth stratum in his system. The 
metaphysical qualities do not belong to the basic structure of the literary 
work. They emerge too rarely from the world of intentional objects in 
order to be incorporated into the strata system. 16 The distortion of In-
garden's strata system originating from Wellek's interpretation is still 
evident in a recent publication 17 in which the metaphysical qualities are 
explained as a fifth stratum with only reference to Wellek. 
Ingarden's strata can be grouped into two pairs of related levels which 
not only refer to the semantic, but also to the formal aspects of meaning. 
The first relation is the sound-meaning relation, and the second is the 
object-meaning relation. In both cases a step from a smaller unit to a 
larger context is taken. This fourfold strata system, as found in Ingarden's 
work, attributes a particular form, or better, an ontology to every work 
of art; it allows the work of art to become a structured intentional object 
for the observer. Such a system is also flexible enough to allow for the 
specific multiplicity of structural arrangement which makes one work of 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
113 
art so very different from any other (even if it should deal with the same 
subject), and it also allows the multiplicity of varying degrees of under-
standing which express themselves in several observers' concretizations 
of the same work. Every stratum contributes to the autonomous whole 
of the entire work. The 'polyphony' of all four strata determines the 
aesthetic value of the work of art. The artistic achievement can be read 
from the interaction of the strata, the more organic the structure of 
the work is, the more artistically and aesthetically valuable will it be 
judged. 
The first stratum, the stratum of sound, is a very fundamental com-
ponent of literature even though we do not generally read aloud. How-
ever, the importance of sound becomes apparent when we look at lit-
erature before it became associated with the written or printed word. 
Literature was once sung or recited by bards; and the sound of a word, 
of a line, or a sentence was very significant for an effective presentation. 
Literature was mainly epic verse poetry in those days, and the importance 
of sound as a vehicle of communication would be equal to the role of 
sound in a radio play in our days. The most relevant characteristics of 
the sound stratum are rhythm and rhyme, which compose the specific 
linguistic traits of every literary work of art. 
The most important of all strata is the second stratum which relates 
to the meaning of sentences, because this stratum is the condition for 
the existence of the literary work as a whole, and also the condition for 
strata three and four which develop their specific quality on the basis 
of the stratum of meaning. The units of meaning established in the verbal 
network of sentences determine whether a work is historical, naturalistic, 
symbolic, etc. The arrangement and form of the sentences also deter-
mines whether a work's content can be clearly established. This kind of 
clarity does not exclude the ambiguity of figurative language as undesir-
able in the literary work. The obscurity of figurative statements may have 
been intended by the artist and will therefore be accepted as an essential 
characteristic of literary language. The literary sentence does not follow 
the rules of logical argumentation as they are used exclusively in sci-
entific language and objective reports. Literary language makes subjec-
tive quasi statements which are specifically different from the logic of 
scientific statements. Consequently, statements, wishes, orders, and 
questions in literature are in reality only quasi-statements, quasi-wishes, 

114 
HANS H. RUDNICK 
quasi-orders, and quasi-questions since literature is not the real world 
but 'fiction'. 
The third stratum of the represented objects plays an important role 
in the establishment of meaning within the context of the literary work. 
It also determines what Ingarden calls the 'metaphysical qualities' of a 
literary work of art, namely whether a work's character is primarily 
tragic, comic, charming, etc. The sequence of the represented objects has 
a definite influence on the range of meaning, not only limited to the 
sentence, paragraph, and chapter, but extending to the entire literary 
context. The richness of meaning can be contained or expanded just as 
much as the author wishes. The artist establishes the larger context of 
meaning in the third stratum. Here he maps the strategy of his discourse 
with the observer. He organizes a sequence of objects and events, which 
has a dominating effect on the resulting meaning. The order of the se-
quence of objects and events determines the particular meaning in a work 
of art. The author of the intentional work of art has to construct his 
representative objects in a series of aspects since the reader will not al-
ways understand the artist's strategy of meaning in every instance. There-
fore, the message of the work of art will be coded for the reader from 
the perspective of different aspects, with the assumption that the reader 
will understand the implied purpose and thusly find also access to those 
related aspects which previously remained obscure. 
According to phenomenological principles, an object can never be de-
scribed satisfactorily merely from one perspective. Many perspectives, 
one next to the other, will be able to supply the closest descriptions pos-
sible. In the real world, the multiplicity of aspects is incorporated in one 
particular unit of meaning which we perceive as the material object. In 
the literary world, the multiplicity of aspects does not converge with the 
same intensity on the intentional object. The artistic imagination fore-
shortens the perspective toward the material object, consequently many 
vital characteristics of the material object have to be neglected by the 
artist, which later have to be filled in during the concretization by the 
observer. The intentional object has to remain piecework because of the 
artist's foreshortening. 
The apparent 'piecework' is, however, not really as incoherent as it 
may seem. The fourth stratum, concerning the schematized aspects of 
the objects presented, makes the observer close the lacunae which the 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
115 
third stratum has largely left unexplained. In the fourth stratum the ob-
server performs the reduction from the intentional object to the material 
object. The observer uses the 'ficticious area of operation', which the 
third stratum has offered him, as the 'area of orientation' (Orientierungs-
raum). From this basis the observer begins his concretization. He applies 
his own experience, which he has gathered during his lifetime, in order 
to fill in those lacunae which the literary work has left open. Only through 
this personal and interpretative engagement by the observer will any 
meaningful access to the work of art be found. 
Such personal access to the work of art does not guarantee an exhaus-
tive understanding of the work of art. The work of art will present itself 
from different aspects to the observer since the observer himself uses a 
particular perspective in his approach. Especially since the observer's 
own experience differs to a degree intellectually and educationally from 
the experience of other observers, the moment of the observation of the 
intentional object plays also an important part with regard to the validity 
and depth of the concretization. Even though Ingarden allows a certain 
range as to the depth of concretization, the process of concretization is 
by far not an arbitrary procedure to which the observer submits the 
work of art. The work of art is understood to be a polyphonous entity 
consisting in the case of the literary work of art of four strata. All strata 
are interrelated, they support each other in such a way that they present 
the observer with a 'schema', or less philosophically, with a pattern, 
which will direct the course of the concretization despite the apparent 
lacunae. 
Abstractly speaking, all human experience is essentially the same, dis-
regarding all the different aspects and possibilities which will provide an 
individual with experience. The individual must gather experience since 
otherwise he would not be able to exist in his environment. The degree 
of differing experience found in observers depends not only on the age 
of the observer, but also on the degree to which he has been able to ab-
stract concrete events into abstract experience. The creative artist ad-
dresses himself directly to this analytical process which is constantly 
performed by every individual. The artist tries to help make the observer 
more aware of the gathering of such 'abstract' experience. The artist tries 
to make the observer more sensitive to experience and thereby heighten 
the level of awareness. 

116 
HANS H. RUDNICK 
The 'concretization' involves the observer's experience in order to fill 
in the lacunae contained in a literary work of art. How to relate the 
intentional object to the material object is predetermined by the artist 
through the schema which is concretely established by the objects rep-
resented in the work of art. The artist has prearranged a pattern with 
gaps, which may puzzle the observer, but at the same time the observer 
is encouraged to apply his experience, which he shares with all other 
human beings, in order to fill these lacunae. The artist has already 
mapped the course of the concretization through the form of the art-
work and the succession of the objects contained in it. The schema of 
interpretation has been pointed out, the observer must only be willing 
to submit himself to the communication with the work of art through 
the provided schema. The observer is encouraged to commit himself to 
the work of art, and it invites him to concretize since it lays its nature 
open (paral halten) to scrutiny. 
In such a system the problem of subjectivity and objectivity attains a 
new dimension in the area of the evaluation of literature. The close inter-
relation between the literary work of art and its observer during the 
concretization process makes the procedure of gaining experience from 
a literary work of art visible in the creative giving and taking which has 
to occur between the observer and the intentional object. If the concret-
ization is not correct, the aesthetic judgment will also be incorrect. The 
literary work is an intersubjective object which is concretized by ob-
servers on an individual or monosubjective basis. For this reason there 
will have to occur differing aesthetic judgments concerning a literary 
work of art. However, this is not to be considered as a weakness in In-
garden's system, but rather eloquent proof of the flexibility of his system. 
The observer cannot judge the aesthetic value of a work of art as such, 
he can only judge the work of art on the grounds of his personal con-
cretization. 
Ingarden's sensitive and most adequate literary theory denies the di-
vision of the work of art into form and content. For him the artwork is 
an organic unity which draws its life from the 'polyphonous' interrelation 
between all four strata on the one hand, and from the concretization of 
the particular intentional object through the observer on the other. In-
garden also rejects the view of some Russian formalists (e.g. Tomashev-
ski) that poetic language is just an artistic variety of common speech. He 

ROMAN INGARDEN'S LITERARY THEORY 
117 
stresses that artistic language is specifically different from the language 
of science and common speech. The language of art has a principle of 
its own, the figurative language, which presents itself to the observer in 
the artwork and demands concretization from him. 
As a philosopher, Ingarden has never distracted his reader from his 
argument by giving more than a bare minimum of concrete references 
to actual literary works of art. He knew that real meaning lies behind 
the cramped and superficial adherence to the obvious and the concrete. 
Real meaning lies in the essence which is merely disguised by the ma-
terial object. The schema which speaks in a language of its own to the 
observer through the presented objects in the work of art is the real es-
sence of an artwork's meaning. The schema has to be discovered by 
every observer at the very moment when he encounters the work of art. 
Meaning speaks only to the observer through the particular schema con-
tained in the work of art. The observer can concretize the covert meaning 
by applying his own experience to the represented objects. The resulting 
meaning will be more than just a particular finding that is valid merely 
for the certain concrete situation in which it is first experienced. Reality 
has many aspects, but what counts is the ability of the observer to see 
them within context and perspective. Only then will a useful meaning 
be reached which is valid beyond the fleeting circumstances of particulars. 
In this sense Ingarden is also a metaphysical philosopher who denies 
skepticism and relativism. He is above all, however, an epistemological 
phenomenologist who tries to provide an answer to the idealism-realism 
problem. He has applied his strata system and his concretization process 
to literature, music, architecture, and film. He has suffered during the 
most creative years of his life continuous interference, threats, and ha-
rassment from the Nazis and later from dogmatic Communists. Twice 
in his life he was, for political reasons, not allowed to teach, even though 
Ingarden had never challenged any political powers. He stoically faced 
the political storms of his lifetime, and he wisely weathered them be-
cause of his prudence and wisdom. The work of this outstanding thinker 
has not yet reached its full impact. Since the publication of Das litera-
rische Kunstwerk in 1931, literary theory and aesthetics have been en-
riched by a workable and ambitious system which grants literature a 
well-reasoned autonomy from all other utterances of human communi-
cation. It is hoped that in the future further findings inspired by Ingar-

den's thinking will provide additional insight into the nature of lit-
erature.

INGARDEN'S PHASES, BERGSON'S DUREE REELLE, 
AND WILLIAM JAMES' STREAM: METAPHORIC 
VARIANTS OR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CONCEPTS 
ON THE THEME OF TIME 
"Time is the first and fundamental form, the 
form of all forms, the presupposition of all 
other connections capable of establishing 
unity." 
Edmund Husserl 
1. TEMPORALITY (CZASOWOSC, ZEITLICHKEIT) AS THE 
PRIMAR Y FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
It was not by chance or accident that the problem of time was one among 
the myriad of problems to which Roman Ingarden addressed himself. 
In his incessant search for a discerning delineation of the world as it is 
mediated through our consciousness he simply could not elude the lived 
experiences of time. Irrespective of whether the objects of this world 
were enduring in time, whether they were processes or events, and 
whether their mode of existence was absolute, temporal, ideal or purely 
intentional, Ingarden, a phenomenologist like his mentor Husserl, had 
to conceive of them as constituted in the temporal phases of our con-
sciousness. 1 These objects, he concluded, are but instances of perceived-
ness (Wahrgenommenheiten) in the flowing present (die fliessende Gegen-
wart), grasped and retained through the lived experience, such as an act 
of judgment, enjoyment, observation and the like. In other words, In-
garden's concern with time was an essential part of his overall ontolog-
ical and phenomenological inquiry into the contents of our conscious-
ness. 
In this study I shall consider Ingarden's treatment of time-conscious-
ness of intentional objects and refer to the time of other objects only in 
passim. It should be observed at the outset that even though Ingarden 
does offer a series of perceptive definitions of this issue, his is not an 
original view on time if judged against the background of the enormous 
literature on this subject. Prior to considering this problem on his own 
he had two alternative positions: the empirical and the transcendental.

JOHN FIZER 
If he had chosen the first he would have had to treat time, its duration, 
change and the order of its sequence only in terms of measurable quanta 
and thereby to reject the very essence of its transcendental character as 
well as to give it up as the immediate object of philosophical reflection; 
and in choosing the second he had to willy-nilly adhere to the position 
that held duration as a transcendental unity of apperception. Yet, unlike 
the followers of these two approaches to time, Ingarden came to dis-
tinguish sharply between the phenomenon of the representation of time 
and ontically real time, or between the synthetic presentification (Ver-
gegenwartigung) of these temporal modalities in our consciousness 
(praetecitum, praesens et futurum) and what Husserl calls all temporal 
transcendencies concerning existents. 
Departing from the fundamental phenomenological axiom that the 
'givenness of the object' is to be achieved through the 'givenness of its 
appearing' in our consciousness, Ingarden concluded that it was through 
consciousness or, it might be better to say, through the all-enveloping 
unity of all the experiences of a stream of experience that we become 
.cognizant of the phenomenological and eventually its correlate, mathe-
matically ideal or immanent time. Through its intentional acts our con-
sciousness progresses from the accomplished to the accomplishable, and 
hence from past to future. The experience of the actual 'now' receives a 
continually fresh content or, as Husserl observed, to an ever new point 
of duration, is continually 'annexing itself' a new impression and that 
impression continuously transforms itself into retention, and this con-
tinuously into modified retention, and so forth. Therefore, conscious-
ness, suspended in the 'actual now', is also steeped in the retentional and 
protentional continua, and conversely time is graspable only for him who 
is there, at the present moment, creating (sinnbildende) and imparting 
(sinngebende) sense to the ever-changing stream of phenomena. Outside 
these acts there is no experience of time. Ergo, consciousness in insepar-
able from temporality. It binds consciousness with consciousness, one 
noesis with another, and thereby is its essential form. Each perceptive 
act by which consciousness constitutes itself sinks back in time together 
with the object in the appearance, be it that of an extra-temporal or 
enduring object, event or process; be it consciousness of something ex-
ternal or internal or even consciousness of consciousness. It follows that 
consciousness is always time-consciousness operating in accordance with 

INGAR DEN , BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
123 
the following 'self-evident laws' of temporality: (1) fixed temporal order 
is that of an infinite, two-dimensional series; (2) two different times can 
never be conjoint; (3) their relation is a nonsimultaneous one; (4) there 
is transitivity, i.e. to every time belongs an earlier and a later time. 2 
Time-consciousness, being directed at something (Gerichtetsein auf et-
was), is always to be comprehended in conjunction with this something 
in the appearance. In 'this something' in the appearance Ingarden dis-
tinguishes three basic types of objects. These are: (1) objects enduring 
in time, (2) processes, and (3) events. 3 These objects are localized in their 
own spatiotemporalities as well as in our particular Lebenswelt that 
encompasses our immediate experience. The enduring objects which exist 
to the full extent of their being with all the properties that pertain to 
them tend to last beyond the fliessende Gegenwart and thus retain their 
'identity'. Our experience of time in regard to enduring objects is pred-
icated upon their continuously changing and mutually incompatible 
states. Even though these objects retain their identity in the ever new 
present, passing from state to state, they "lose successively all those 
properties that belong to the past states and retain only those that are 
indispensable to the occurrence of variant states." 4 It is in this sense that 
they go through 'history'. In this category to be singled out as a type 
in itself is a living individual and particularly a living human person 
which is "something more than and something different from the sum 
of the events and processes taking place in it .... This more ... is the basis 
and in part the only source of both the generically determined way in 
which the vital discourse between the living individuum (a human being 
especially) and its environing world is conducted. This 'more', the basis 
of behavior, forms not only the essential core of the individuum, but also 
what persists in it that survives in spite of all the vicissitudes of time and 
the destructive power of history .... Only when this core ... suffers decay 
and annihilation does the given individual succumb to disintegration 
and destruction." 5 Unlike enduring objects in time, processes are both 
temporally extensive aggregates of phases and absolutely non-recurrent 
temporal objects. They cannot be contained in one instance, since by 
their very mode of existence they transcend every 'now' that is a part 
of their temporal totality. In the continuous transcience of their phases 
"(1) one and only one phase is always actual; (2) one new phase after an-
other is always becoming actual; (3) an actual phase is continuously 

124 
JOHN FIZER 
losing its actuality and a new phase, just then oncoming, is becoming 
actual; (4) in the instant that the then actual phase occurs, the phases 
antecedent to it are already extinct (more accurately, they are no longer 
actual), but have existed previously, while the phases subsequent to it 
are not yet in existence, but are going to exist (will be actual); (5) in that 
instant when the last phase attains actuality, the process has already 
passed. But not every process has to have a final phase."6 Events, on 
the other hand, do not occur through phases and do not require 'syn-
thetic presentification' to constitute themselves. They "appear at once as 
a ready creation, coming into existence and vanishing from it as if in one 
sweep." 7 They are often the end result of processes. In living experience 
all three types of objects are to be understood as moments in the flux. 
Yet, in terms of the ultimate nature of this experience, we must distin-
guish in it at all times, as Husserl observed, "consciousness (flux), ap-
pearance (immanent object), and transcendent object (if it is not the 
primary content of an immanent object)." 8 
2. TIME AND PURELY INTENTIONAL OBJECTS 
From the various intentional objects I choose to consider here only 
works of art and particularly of literary creation. In contrast to other 
temporal objects, an object of art has its own modus existentiae and thus 
its own spatiotemporality. Unlike enduring objects, processes and events 
which are self-dependent and autonomous, artistic and aesthetic objects 
are heteronomous, derivative and contingent. They do not possess an 
essence o/their own. "All their material determination, formal moments, 
and even their existential moments, which appear in their contents, are 
in some way only ascribed [to them], but they are not embodied in 
them .... " 9 
Specifically, the work of creative art is, as an intentional object: (1) 
multi-stratal, (2) structurally unified, (3) harmoniously polyphonous, (4) 
fictitious or quasi-true, (5) temporally extensive from beginning to end 
and hence multi-phasal, (6) schematic with undetermined places in prac-
tically all of its strata, (7) at variance with its aesthetic concretion, (8) 
more comprehensive in its aesthetic becoming than in its artistic readi-
ness (Parathaltung), and (9) grounded both in its material substance and 
its signification as well as in the creative acts of its author and perceiver. 1 0 

INGARDEN, BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
125 
Due to this ontological and structural complexity of the work of cre-
ative art, it is therefore logical to posit three different possibilities of time 
experience about it and in it. 
First, it can be conceived as an enduring object with all the attributes 
thereof. Its intentionality could be bracketed for the time being or ex-
cluded from the lived experience. In this case the work of literary art as 
a purely spatiotemporal fact will exist in the flux of our consciousness 
like any other object enduring in time. It will outlast individual moments, 
will remain identical through succeeding ones, and will progressively 
suffer modifications in its material endowment. Of course, a fundamental 
objection could be made that in this bracketed mode it is not a work of 
art but merely another variant of the physically enduring object. To this 
I may answer that the intentionality of the object prior to its unveiling 
(enthiillte) is to be assumed by us. Hence, the actual unveiling is pred-
icated upon our intentionality toward the intentional object. As long as 
there is no such unveiling, we are not in a position to fully experience 
its intentional nature. At the same time, due to the fact that the work 
of literary art is to be read, we cannot simply lump it together with un-
intentional objects. In our perception, for example, we do distinguish 
between the vase on the table as an existentially self-dependent object 
and the work of literary art next to it, which we have not yet had a chance 
to read, as a potentially heteronomous and contingent object. As long 
as its intentionality remains unfulfilled (unerfiillt), this work is to be re-
garded as an enduring object in statu expectandi or, as Ingarden says, 
at readiness. It seems to me that this view agrees with the following 
observation of HusserI: HusserI classifies 'all cultural objectivities', in-
cluding literary art (he refers to Goethe's Faust and Raphael's Madonna), 
that are intended to be experienced in a special way, as 'irreal objectivi-
ties'. A book, for example, is produced by men and intended to be read: 
"It is already a determination of significance .... This mental sense which 
determines the work of art, the mental structure as such, is certainly 
'embodied' in the real world, but is not individualized by this embodi-
ment." 11 The experience of time in this case will be similar to that of 
the enduring objects. 
Second, as an artistic object, with all its schematically presented struc-
tural components, it exists simultaneously (zugleich). None of its com-
ponents, presented in different temporal phases, exists earlier or later. 

126 
JOHN FIZER 
They are all there at once. "Das Werk se1bst ist somit in der Richtung 
von seinem 'Anfang' bis zu seinem 'Ende' kein zeitlich sich entfaltendes 
und ausgedehntes Gebi1de." 12 Its beginning, middle and end, or its be-
fore, now and after, are given at the same time. It is only when these 
simultaneously given phases are perceived that they appear in an orderly 
temporal sequence (Aufeinanderfolge). There is, however, a substantial 
difference between their and the concrete temporal continuum. While 
there is always an explicit phase of 'now' in the latter which achieves the 
particular existential actuality by itself and which cannot be shifted back-
ward or forward, the continuum of artistic phases rests upon all the 
components in question and thereby might not have such a 'now'. Each 
phase with the exception of the first one contains in itself (a) moments 
which are based outside themselves, i.e., in moments of the previous 
phase, (b) moments which have no basis in the previous phase, and (c) 
moments which constitute the basis for the oncoming phase. It is in this 
sense that each 'previous' phase exists or may exist simultaneously with 
each subsequent phase of the work. In sum, the 'temporal sequence' of 
the literary work is not to be compared or confused with the one in 
which the work exists as an enduring object. In the 'sequence' of artistic 
phases the 'now' can be shifted in accordance with the work's artistic 
necessities or aims. Thus the actual continuum of phases (A--+B--+C--+ 
--+ D--+ ... N) in literary art may be (a) preserved in its unilinear progession 
(a--+b--+c), or (b) inverted (c--+a--+b, b--+c--+a, a--+c--+b), (c) amplified 
(+a--+ +b--+ + c, +c--+ +a--+ +b), (d) reduced in duration ( -a--+ -b--+ - c, 
- c--+ -a--+ -b), or (e) all these together. In brief, it may be intentionally 
manipulated. The contingency of phases upon the writer's creative act 
renders the work of literary art internally dynamic. Ingarden observed: 
"Das Vorhandensein der 'Aufeinanderfolge' der Phasen des Werkes hat 
zur Folge, dass jedes Werk eine bestimmte Entfaltungslinie und irn 
Zusammenhang damit eine innere Dynamik hat." 13 Thus the factor 
which detennines the 'orderly sequence of phases' in literary art is the 
'order of foundation' 'die Ordnung der Fundierung) of the phases rather 
than the order of their occurrence and disappearance in time (die Ordnung 
des Entstehens und Vergehens in der Zeit). 14 
Third, in the literary work as an aesthetic object time again assumes a 
substantially different character. 15 Unlike the artistic object whose com-
ponents exist simultaneously, the aesthetic object emerges in phases that 

INGARDEN, BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
127 
necessarily follow each other and which exist serially one after the other 
in our experience, i.e. in their experienced presentification. Due to our 
'living memory' (das lebendige Gediichtnis), presentification includes 
past and present phases. The phases that follow appear in it either "als 
leere Zeitschemata, die eher bloss gedacht werden und uns nicht phano-
menal gegenwartig sind" or "schweben uns unter der Gestalt nur nebel-
haft sich anzeigender Qualitaten der Zeitphasen vor." 16 Past and future 
phases participate in this 'extended present' in a limited way and contain 
only those elements which add in some way to the 'vividness' of the 
current presentification. This means that the past phases in the aesthetic 
duration are necessarily shorter than they were originally. Their phe-
nomenologicallongevity (Lange) depends upon both the object in ques-
tion and the psychological condition in which the living memory occurs, 
i.e. upon the intensity of our emphatic participation in the 'life' of the 
work. Seized by the dynamic presentification of the emerging aesthetic 
object, we cease to discern its temporal moments, we ourselves become 
subject to its dynamic process, and only when the whole process reaches 
its end do we synoptically recreate its course. By that point, however, 
the aesthetic object is no longer in statu nascendi but rather an object 
of our retentive momory. Time in recollection becomes 'time perspec-
tive'. Now the temporal sequence is experienced as something static or 
atemporal. "In einem statischen Erfassen erschauen wir die 'erstarrte' 
Dynamik des Vorganges. Sie erscheint in einer synthetischen, konden-
sierten Gestaltqualitat. Wir erfassen dann vielleicht ihre specifische 
Eigenheit am deutlichsten, fiihlen dann aber das Pulsieren des sich dy-
namisch entwickelnden V organgs nicht mehr, zittern nicht mit in den 
Phasen der Spannung, folgen nicht dem Wechsel des Tempos und der 
Kulmination des Vorgangs." 1 7 In sum, the experience of time is con-
siderably different during and after the reading of the work. During the 
reading the presentification of the aesthetic object is, to use St. Au-
gustine's terminology, mostly praesens de praesentibus with some mod-
icum of praesens de praeteritis, while after the reading it is mostly the 
latter. 
The synthetic nature of presentification poses yet another question: 
What happens to the past phases once they are 'integrated' with the 
'flowing presence' (die fiiessende Gegenwart) in which an aesthetic con-
cretion takes place? Does this content (objects, meanings, aspects, etc.) 

128 
JOHN FIZER 
remain the same or does it alter in any way? Ingarden believes that the 
integration of past and present phases exposed them as a rule to mutual 
influences and hence changes and modifications. Ergo, aesthetic pre-
sentification of the intentional object is a temporal cycle within which 
past and present exist dialectically rather than unidirectionally. It is for 
this reason that past phases can either assume new significance or lose 
it completely, can be enriched with new elements or freed from 'super-
fluous' details. In sum, as Ingarden observed, "in dieser sich phanomenal 
konstituierender Vergangenheit sind die vorkommenden Ereignisse und 
Vorgange gar nicht ein fiir aIle Male 'fertig' und unabandedich." 18 Thus 
the proverbial dictum that there is nothing one can do about his past is 
"die sprachliche Inkorrektheit." 19 Aesthetic qualifications of the artistic 
object are possible due to the thematic flexibility and open structure of 
past phases. At the same time this does not mean that the ever new 
present in which they appear alter them radically. Should this be the case, 
we thus would not have a sense of time continuum. Zeno's paradox 
would indeed become true. 20 In representative cases retention of past 
phases is not seriously impeded by fantasy, the facticity of the present 
moment or expectation. As Hussed observed, "phenomenologically 
speaking, the now-consciousness that is constituted on the basis of a 
content A changes continuously to a consciousness of the past, while at 
the same time an ever new now-consciousness is built up. With this trans-
formation (and this is part of the essence of time-consciousness) the self-
modifying consciousness preserves its objective intention." 21 [italics J. F.J 
In brief, it is this objective intention that preserves the essential identity 
of past phases. 
When applied to various literary genres, presentification as a synthesis 
of past and present phases becomes different structurally. For example, 
in the perception of lyrical poetry the two-dimensional time perspective 
extending toward the past and the future is replaced by the unidimen-
sional 'now' without retention and protention. Its aesthetic object exists 
in this 'now' in its totality rather than in its serial protraction. The per-
ceiver of this object must practically cut himself off from past and future 
in order to seize it, must literally drown himself (das vollige Sich-Ver-
senken) in the poem's imaginative now (in das Jingierte Jetz des Ge-
dichts).22 
All this brings us to the conclusion that the work of literary art as an 

INGARDEN, BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
129 
artistic and aesthetic object is transcended both in respect to the con-
scious acts through which we cognize it and in respect to the multiple 
phases through which it assumes its phenomenological modus existen-
tiae. 23 
3. CONCEPT OF PHASES IN RETROSPECT 
Ingarden's concept of phases stands in close relation to Husserl's phe-
nomenology of internal time-consciousness. There are, of course, sub-
stantial differences between the two, inasmuch as both philosophers held 
different views as to the existence of the real world. 24 If I understand 
Husserl's transcendental subjectivity correctly, the real world is, accord-
ing to this philosophy, "the product of pure, totally self-sufficient and 
self-reliant consciousness." According to Husserl, in the dichotomy of 
the world versus pure consciousness the priority of the latter assumes 
a metaphysical character and thus posits the total dependence of the real 
world upon it. "The objective world," Hussed wrote, "which exists for 
me, which was and will be for me and which with all its objects can be, 
derives from me its sense and its entire existential value which it holds 
for me as a transcendental T." 25 Out of this fundamental assumption, 
i.e. absolute intentionality of consciousness, emanates Husserl's notion 
of time and temporality. On the other hand, as I observed earlier, In-
garden assumed the possibility of the existence of the real world with 
its varied multiplicity of the objects in it independent of pure conscious-
ness. Moreover, in addition to pure consciousness he believed in the 
existence of empirical consciousness with different degrees of intention-
ality oscillating between total passivity and total activity. 26 In passive 
consciousness, we might say that we swim along with everything that 
surrounds and penetrates us without being aware of ourselves of the 
process (noesis) and the object (noema) of our cognition. Here, in this 
type of consciousness, we are to assume that the degree of intentionality 
is nil and that we are unable to create purely intentional objects. In active 
consciousness, the degree of intentionality is high and therefore we not 
only seize the world but also impregnate it with inner sense and value. 
Here our consciousness creates purely intentional objects of art, i.e. 
creates reality dependent upon itself. 
In his analysis of time and phases Ingarden frequently refers to Berg-

130 
JOHN FIZER 
son's theory of duration.27 His lack of explicit criticism of this theory 
might imply that Ingarden agreed with it. In my view Ingarden's and 
Bergson's theories differ both specifically and substantially. This differ-
ence originates out of their varying epistemological and ontological po-
sitions. Like Heraclitus, Bergson postulates an absolute variability of 
being and hence man's inability to establish a correlation between its 
constancy and change. Ingarden, on the other hand, assumed like HusserI 
and endlessly searched for a structural constancy of the real and phe-
nomenal worlds. 28 Bergson's thesis concerning the ceaseless fluidity of 
our inner life, very much like the ancient 'tVXVt(X pEi, prevented him, 
from its exact discernment. Since ultimate reality is permanently in flux, 
in becoming it "cannot be expressed in the fixed terms of language," 29 
it "cannot receive a fixed form or be expressed in words without be-
coming public property," 30 it "cannot be represented by symbols de-
rived from extensity." 31 All we can say is that this 'inner life' endures 
or succeeds. How do we know this? We know it through feeling, through 
intuition. In a dream, for example, when our organic functions are re-
laxed, when the circle of external objects surrounding our ego is re-
moved, when we no longer measure duration, we intuit the internal flow, 
the internal interpenetration of its successive phases, we do indeed feel 
duration or time. Therefore, time is the primary quality of the inner flow 
of man's elan vital. Specifically, pure duration is 'a continuous or quali-
tative multiplicity' ('une multiplicite de fusion ou de penetration mutu-
elle') which melt themselves into one another and out of which grows 
our ego. Since it cannot be quantified or materialized, it cannot be 
measured. However, there is what Bergson calls 'a homogeneous time' 
for which quantitative categories of space are used. This time is used in 
astronomy, physics, etc. Yet it is the "illusory form of a homogeneous 
medium" rather than pure duration. Science "cannot deal with time" 32 
because it situates its objects in space, i.e. in the realm of simultaneities 
where there is no duration. Pure duration or pure heterogeneity is mutual 
externality without succession. Duration is quality, space quantity. They 
cannot be comprehended through one and the same representation. Du-
ration divorced from spatial externality can be contemplated by pure 
vision or pure self-consciousness. 
Ingarden's treatment of time does precisely what Bergson is against, 
i.e. he reflects upon the temporal stream of consciousness and locates 

INGAR DEN , BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
131 
in it its structural components. Hussed also utilized a whole series of 
diagrammatic schemes and mathematical formulae (e.g. the recollection 
of the succession is rendered as [(A - B) - (A - B)']', or the continuity of 
retentions as Rp(s). P(s), etc.). In their penetrating analysis Hussed and 
Ingarden temporalized space and geometrized time. 
There is, to be sure, a superficial affinity between Bergson's duree 
reelle and Ingarden's phases, namely that in the intuition of time past, 
present and future are given to us as an immediate datum, as an inter-
penetrating continuum. But that is where the affinity begins and ends. 
Bergson refuses to distinguish in the datum its three temporal modalities 
and refuses to discuss them in terms of the presentifical objects. Ingarden, 
on the other hand, sees objects in the context of their existential moments 
and duration in terms of its varying modes of existence - in brief, in their 
dialectical relationship. For Bergson there seem to be no temporal ob-
jects (events and processes) which begin and terminate both objectively 
and phenomenologically; no purely intentional objects which have 
both externality and temporal succession. All objects seemed to him 
to be extra-temporal, changing without ever succeeding, existing with-
out ever enduring. 33 Apprehensive of relating duration to space, i.e. 
apprehensive of the 'homogeneous time' in which duration is related to 
external reality, Bergson proposed to reverse our stream of conscious-
ness, to float it backwards and thus divorce ourselves from the praesens 
de praesentibus, from futurity, from space, and thus, as Proust would 
say, the "recherche du temps perdu." In the active withdrawal from a 
forward-striving movement we have a chance to return into the depth 
of ourselves, into the life that has been, in which there is no coercive 
necessity of spatial things but freedom and pure vision. "To call up the 
past in the form of an image, we must be able to withdraw ourselves from 
the action of the moment, we must have the power to value the useless, 
we must have the will to dream .... But even in [man] the past to which 
he returns is fugitive, ever on the point of escaping him, as though his 
backward turning memory were thwarted by the other, more natural, 
memory, of which the forward movement bears him on the action and 
the life." 34 This then clearly suggests that in Bergson's speculation about 
time Husserl's notion of 'presentification' (Vergegenwartigung) would 
have to be replaced by 'pastification'. In fact, according to Bergson, there 
is hardly such a thing as the perception of the present. As he says, "prac-

132 
JOHN FIZER 
tically every perception is already memory. Practically we perceive only 
the past, the pure present being the invisible progress of the past growing 
into the future." 35 Therefore, the most we can say about the present is 
that it is an immediate past. The rest remains in the dark. 
It seems to me that at this point Bergson no longer offers a perceptual 
or ideational cognition of duration but postulates a program of mystical 
'oughtness'. Unlike Georges Poulet, I would not regard him as "a phi-
losopher of memory" but rather as a promoter of the past. Needless to 
say, Ingarden's position on the same issue was free from any theological 
tendency. Bergson's theory of duree reelle brings res extensa and res 
cogitans to a complete rupture, while Ingarden's theory of time attempts 
to unite them in uno expressio. 36 
Finally, there is still another concept which is fundamental to Ingar-
den's and Bergson's theories of time. This concept is stream of con-
sciousness. As a phenomenologist, Ingarden treats reality as it occurs 
immediately in our conscious experience. Logically this treatment com-
prises three distinct yet functionally integrated phenomena - ego, cog-
itation or noesis, and cogitata or noema. A description of one neces-
sarily implies a description of the other two. It is through cogitation, 
according to Ingarden, which functions as a stream of consciousness 
(strumieh swiadomosci), that we, as tightly built conscious monads, 37 
become aware of our identity, 'acquire self-knowledge', establish contact 
with the external world, partake in the intersubjective processes and 
events, and finally reflect upon the essences of the true eidos situated in 
the various realms of existence. Stream of consciousness emanates out 
of the pure subject, out of the centrum of our essence, i.e. out of our 
soul which plays a dominant role in the hierarchy of our structure. 38 
Without the soul we "would become a naked skeleton, an abstraction, 
a disfigured and incomprehensible torso, unable to exist." 39 
What is this stream of consciousness? It is a continuously enveloping 
process of particular and mutually interpenetrating psychic experiences 
in their becoming. The 'cross section' of the presentified past stream 
(static position) as well as comparison of its succeeding phases (dynamic 
states) reveals the distinct particuliarity of its individual components 
occupying a set of relations with each other and with those in preceding 
and succeeding phases. The fusion of these components into a homogene-
ous process depends upon the existential moments of the experienced 

INGAR DEN , BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
133 
object and upon the primordial unity (pierwotna jednosc) of our intend-
ing consciousness with it. In brief, the past and present components of 
the stream yield, in spite of their incompletion, becoming, interdepen-
dence, interpenetration and fusion, to our reflective discernment and 
definition. At the same time this stream is not merely a conglomerate 
or a mosaic of multiple ready-made elements but an organic whole. 
Bergson's view of the stream or, as he called it, 'continuous flow' 
(Matter and Memory, p. 193), does in some way resemble that ofIngarden 
in that it concerns itself with duration as lived by our consciousness 
rather than with personal duration, the same for everything and for 
everyone, an indifferent void, external to all that endures. For Bergson, 
however, the inner stream is synonymous with the duree reelle 40 which 
is the same thing as pure spiritual memory, pure vision or pure -self-
consciousness, experienced as an immediate unity with no discerning 
temporal beginning and end, a continuity of becoming, a present which 
is always beginning again. In brief, it is the antithesis to the 'specious 
present' and 'presentified space' of Ingarden's temporal phases. Here 
time and space are mutually exclusive, while according to Ingarden they 
are mutually coextensive phenomena. 
One finds a somewhat closer affinity in Ingarden's view of time with 
that of William James, even though James wrote his major work several 
decades prior to the emergence of phenomenology.41 To be sure, his 
Principles of Psychology reveal a remarkable closeness to the core con-
cepts of phenomenology. For example, his differentiation among the 
several constituents of the 'phenomenal Self' (the material, social, spir-
itual self and the pure Ego) stands in close proximity to the phenomenol-
ogical distinction between empirical and transcendental egos; 42 his con-
cept of 'fringes and horizons' had been adopted by HusserI himself; 43 
his crediting of consciousness with 'selective attention and of deliberate 
will' to the phenomenological concept of intentionality; 44 and his qual-
ification and restriction of the introspective method in psychology to the 
concept of epoche. 45 But, as far as our topic is concerned, James' theory 
of the stream of consciousness or thought is central to both HusserI's 
and Ingarden's discussion of time. 
Like Ingarden, James agreed that we cannot intuit duration and tem-
poral extension devoid of all sensible content, i.e. we cannot sense 'empty 
time'.46 Intuition of time or time consciousness is necessarily object-

134 
JOHN FIZER 
consciousness, which constitutes itself through the stream of our psychic 
life. As he said, "duration and events together fonn our intuition of the 
specious present with its content.,,47 Acts of consciousness, retaining 
lingerings of old objects on the one hand and reaching for the oncoming 
of new ones on the other, provide us with a sense of duration and con-
tinuity. The stream of consciousness is in an endless process of comple-
tion. It is not "a string of bead-like sensations and images," all separate 
and complete, but a 'synthetic datum' of the past and future, near and 
remote experiences, always mixed in with our knowledge of the present 
thing. Therefore, the past is to be comprehended through the present. 
But what is the present? In an absolute sense it is "an altogether ideal 
abstraction, not only never realized in sense, but probably never even 
conceived of by those unaccustomed to philosophic meditation." 48 It 
can "never be a fact of our immediate experience."49 Yet, while there 
is no 'pure present', there is, James observed, an extended or 'specious 
present', i.e., that "short duration of which we are immediately and in-
cessantly sensible" 50 and which varies in length from a few seconds to 
probably not more than a minute. It "stands permanent, like the rainbow 
on the waterfall with its own quality unchanged by the events that stream 
through it." 51 This 'specious present' seems to have 'a rearward and a 
forward-looking end' or a fringe which allows us to look back into the 
past or ahead into the future. However, looking only backward or for-
ward may "easily decompose the experience and distinguish its beginning 
from its end." 52 
James' notion of the 'specious present' 53 or 'duration block' 54 is close 
to several of Hussed's ideas such as 'temporal modes of appearance',55 
'present enduring actuality' and 'the actual now'. Accordingly, that 'en-
during actuality' does not sink into the past but is retained for a while 
'in primary memory' 56 and, 'having just been present' (James' 'not quite 
yet' or 'a penumbra of mere dim memory'), it continues to be a part of 
immediate memory. 
Like the phenomenologists,57 James assumes a quasi-spatial dimen-
sion of time experience when he speaks of the 'element of voluminous-
ness' 58 or the feeling of extensity of our sensations. As we have seen, 
Bergson rejects the very idea of conceiving of duree reelle as also having 
a spatial dimension. 
While the Jamesian and Bergsonian concepts, i.e. stream of conscious-

INGARDEN, BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
135 
ness and duree reelle, respectively, have been widely accepted as general 
psychological and philosophical insights into the mysteries of our mind, 
Ingarden's concept of phases has not yet had this privilege. 59 However, 
it is my feeling that Ingarden's concept, especially as applied to literary 
art, is an improvement. on both James' and Bergson's views inasmuch 
as it stresses the intentional arrangement and thus quasi-temporal nature 
of phases. Failing to differentiate between intentional and non-inten-
tional objects, neither James nor Bergson could adequately describe the 
causal relationship and interdependence of phases in the literary struc-
ture. They leave us with the impression that phases in this structure do 
not differ from those in any other structure. When looking at literary 
art from their vantage points, we could easily come to a false impression, 
as many creators and scholars already have, namely that literary events, 
processes, themes and the like unfold in accordance with the same on-
tological dicta as they do in the 'real world'. Yet, as we know, even in 
those works in which there is supposedly an intention to suspend cre-
ative intentionality and thus submerge in passive becoming, such as, for 
example, Joyce's Ulysses, the temporal phases do not correspond to 
those in the real world. Like the entire creation, they are manipulated, 
even if only subliminally, by the creator's mind. Therefore, creative 
reproduction of a dream or of passive observation of the backward or 
forward-floating stream of consciousness is ipso facto an intentionally 
reconstructed artistic noema which possesses its own duration and its 
own existential and aesthetic value. Ingarden describes precisely the 
differentia specifica between objective/intersubjective and intentional 
times of the autonomous and intentionally contingent worlds. In sum, 
Bergson's, James' and Ingarden's positions on time reveal some resem-
blances as well as some substantial differences in terminology, methods, 
and depth of intellectual penetration. These differences are to be related 
to Bergson's 'vitalism', James' 'radical empiricism', and Ingarden's phe-
nomenology.

temporal existence and becomes potentially accessible to all men in its original identity."

15 Ingarden distinguishes between artistic and aesthetic objects and thereby artistic 
and aesthetic values. The first comprises only those constituents of the work that are 
manifestly there (in actualitate) and the second those that are there explicitly, implicitly 
and potentially (in potentieller Bereitschaft). The second converts the artistic schemes into 
relatively completed images via concretion and fills the undetermined places with material 
which corresponds to the work's aesthetic goal. Hence artistic analysis aims at as exact a 
description of the work's structure as it is explicitly given. All the complementary and non-
complementary derivatives that emerge in one's perception under the impetus of the artistic 
dotum are to be suspended in this type of analysis or bracketed by epoch!!. Aesthetic analysis, 
on the other hand, describes the work as it constitutes itself in a living experience, i.e., as 
it unfolds and completes itself in the perceiving consciousness. An aesthetic object is there-
fore always the artistic datum plus the complementary creative addenda. This does not 
mean, however, that aesthetics investigates nothing but 'monosubjective' experiences of 

INGARDEN, BERGSON AND WILLIAM JAMES 
137 
art perception. Aesthetic concretion is not to be confused with the subjective conditions 
in which it occurred. Here 'psychological', as opposed to phenomenological, research 
"plays merely an auxiliary role ... and per se is neither a research of the literary work nor 
ofits concretion .... " (Roman Ingarden, 'Psychologism and Psychology in Literary Schol-
arship', New Literary History V (1973-74) 221.)

19 Idem. 
20 On this point I feel Ingarden's view stands some correction. While it might be appli-
cable to certain groups of people, it is inapplicable to others. The psychologists studying 
modes of human behavior have pointed out that people direct their psychic energies dif-
ferently. Some do indeed preserve and modify past experience through current perceptive 
acts, but others constantly obliterate their past and literally live in the unidimensional 
present. Others divorce themselves from both past and present and live entirely in the 
future. Conventional language refers to them as conservative, traditional or expedient, 
visionary, etc. One may object to this criticism by saying that, except in psychopathology 
(retroactive and general amnesia), there is no such thing as complete absence of retentive 
memory. Perhaps it is true in an absolute sense, but in real life situations the intentional 
acts of different people are oriented toward the past, present or future, if only to a degree. 
As Johannes Volkelt conjectured, this orientation "emanates out of fundamental human 
predispositions." (Zeitschrift for Asthetik S (1913) 209.)

23 By transcendence Ingarden means the following: "No component of the real world -
whether a thing or any of its properties, or an event or a process - constitutes an actual 
part of the conscious experience in which it is given; and conversely, no element of that 
experience constitutes an actual part of that which is given in it as an object to the ex-
periencing subject." (Time and Modes of Being, op. cit., p. 13.) 
24 Ingarden stated: "Husserlian transcendental idealism is one of the most profound and 
significant attempts to solve the controversy between idealism and realism in contempo-
rary philosophy. To avoid misunderstanding, I must immediately note here that it seems 
very improbable to me that the solution proposed by Husserl is correct." (Time and Modes 
of Being, p. 9.)

37 "It seems that the stream of experiences, subject, soul and personality of the person 
is nothing else than certain moments or aspects of a tightly built conscious being, the so-
called monad." (Spar ... , Vol. II, p. 523.) 
38 Ibid., p. 520. The problem of schematism and 'undetermined places in it' is in my 
opinion genetically related to what James called 'aching gaps' in the stream of conscious-
ness. ("In all our voluntary thinking there is some topic or subject about which all the 
members of the thought revolve. Half the time this topic is a problem, a gap we cannot 
yet fill with a definite picture, word or phrase, but which ... influences us in an intensely 
active and determinate psychic way. Whatever may be the images and phases that pass 
before us, we feel their relation to this aching gap. To fill it up is our thought's destiny." 
Principles of Psychology, Vol. I, p. 259). Ingarden, on the other hand, assumes that sche-
matism of literary works results from two basic situations: (a) essential disproportion be-
tween the lexical means of representation and the object intended, and (b) conditions of 
the aesthetic perception of the literary work. I hold that the genesis of schematism must 
be sought in our stream of consciousness. See my 'Schematism: Aesthetic Device or Psy-
chological Necessity' in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism XXVII/4 (1969) 417-
423, and Ingarden's reply to it - 'Letters Pro and Con', ibid., XXVIII/4 (1970) 451-52. 
39 Idem. Ingarden also refers to the soul as an essential core that "survives in spite of all 
the vicissitudes of time and the dialectic power of history. This kind of essential core of a 
living individuum, and particularly of man, precludes neither the appearance in the in-
dividuum of systems, properties and states that are produced as a result of the processes 
that occur in it, nor the constitution of the respective processes as objects peculiar to it, 
with it as their ground .... When this core suffers decay and annihilation does the given 
individual succumb to disintegration and destruction." (Time and Modes of Being, p. 143.) 
40 To William James' claim that Bergson borrowed this concept from him and Ward, 
Bergson replied: "The theory of the inner stream or rather of the duree reelle ... could 
not have been due to the influence of Ward, for I knew nothing of the philosopher, nor 
even his name, when I wrote the Essai sur les donnees immediates de la conscience .... I 
hasten to add that the conception of the duree reelle developed in my Essai coincides on 
many points with James' description of the stream of thought .... But if one examines the 
texts one will easily see that the description of the "stream of thought" and the theory of 
the duree reelle have not the same significance and cannot spring from the same source. 
The first is a critique of the idea of homogeneous time as one finds it among philosophers 
and mathematicians." (Revue philosophique IX (1905) 229-30.) 
41 James borrowed a few key 'phenomenological' concepts from Carl Stumpf, founder of 
experimental phenomenology. The most important of these is Stumpf's differentiation be-
tween phenomena and functions (Erscheinungen und psychische Funktionen). 
42 Principles of Psychology, New York, 1890, Vol. I, Ch. X. However, James failed to 
define the role of the pure ego in the overall scheme of our consciousness. He thought that 
"the parts of experience hold together from next to next by relations that are themselves 
parts of experience" and thus do not need any extraneous, transempirical, connective sup-
port. Hence he differs from the phenomenologists who assumed an active role for the 
transcendental ego in the unification of conscious experiences. David Bidney observed. 
"From the perspective of phenomenology James' empiricism is not radical enough."

43 Husserl wrote: "W. James was alone. as far as I know. in becoming aware of the phe-
nomena of horizon - under the title of 'fringes' - but how could he inquire into it without 
the phenomenologically acquired understanding of intentional objectivity and of implica-
tion?" (The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Northwestern

45 By this I do not want to create the impression that James was a forerunner of phenom-
enology. For his views on time he relies upon the opinions of many British and continental 
thinkers. among them James Mill. S. H. Hodgson. Herbart. Wundt. Dietze. E. P. Clay. 
Lazarus. Paul Janet. Kollert. Mehner. Stevens and Mach. James was still heavily oriented 
toward objectivism and scientism or. as Husser! would say. toward 'irrelevant opinions' 
(sachferne Meinungen). Unlike the phenomenologists. he constantly looked for the phys-
iological correlates of our mental experiences. including the experience of time. He wrote: 
"We must suppose that this amount of duration is pictured fairly steadily in each passing 
instant of consciousness by virtue of some fairly constant feature in the brain process to 
which the consciousness is tied. This feature of the brain process. whatever it may be. must 
be the cause of our perceiving the fact of time at all." (Principles ...• Vol. I. p. 630.)

phenomenologically do not even refer to Ingarden's definition.

critique, que Roman Ingarden (eleve de Husserl a Gottingen de 1912 a 
1914, et a Fribourg apres 1916) a fait de la philosophie bergsonienne de 
la vie, est une occasion pour comprendre les liaisons entre ces deux 
courants, qui, a premiere vue, semblent decidement opposes 1. La phe-
nomenologie de Husserl, en tant que doctrine de la 'reduction eidetique', 
s'oppose a la philo sophie bergsonienne de "['elan vital", au fur et it mesure 
que l"eidos' s'eloigne du profond "bathos" et s'eleve sur Ie flux de la vie. 
C'est la naturellement un scheme 'scolastique' partiel comme tout scheme 
et destine a un depassement dans Ie milieu de la culture franco-allemande, 
meme au temps de l'ecole husserlienne de Gottingen. En eifet, 1a distance 
entre ces deux courants semble raccourcie si l'on considere les ressem-
blances entre les 'donnees immediates de la conscience' de Bergson (1889) 
et Ie 'inneres Zeitbewusstsein' de Husserl (1904-1905), entre les moments 
de l' 'elan originel de la vie' et les Erlebnisse, dans Ie flux de la vie con-
sciente 2. D'apres Ie temoignage de Spiegelberg, a l'occasion d'une con-
ference tenue par A. Koyre, en 1911, au Cercle de Gottingen, pour y 
exposer la philo sophie de Bergson, Husserl aurait affirme: "Les vrais 
bergsoniens, c'est nous!" Plus tard, Ie chef de l'ecole phenomenologique 
a de nouveau confirme ses rapports les plus stricts avec Ie bergsonisme 3 • 
Pourquoi done les phenomenologues seraient les "vrais" bergsoniens? 
Dans cette attribution de verite, il y a une certaine pretention de per-
fectionner les donnees immediates de la conscience (Bergson) par une 
nouvelle et plus vraie determination des donnees de l'analyse mathema-
tique et logique (Husserl). L'expression 'vrai bergsonien', pour un phe-
nomenologue, ne repond done pas seulement a une hermeneutique ob-
jective du bergsonisme, mais plutot a un developpement naturel de la 
theorie de l'intuition dans les cadres de 1a mathesis universalis. L'intuition 
bergsonienne de l' elan vital se charge d'une nouvelle valence, par la 
participation intuitive del'intelligence a la vie, et atteint vraiment l'ab-

MARIO SANCIPRIANO 
solu - comme Ie veut Bergson - dans l'interiorite, car on se connait en 
soi-meme, et on connait Ies choses par Ia meme aptitude a se poser it 
I'interieur des phenomenes. L'intuition husserlienne de son cote est, elle 
aussi, un acte par Iequella conscience se met immediatement en rapport 
avec Ies choses; mais Ia conscience phenomenologique dispose en plus 
d'une suspension du jugement existentiel et naturel (epoche), et se per-
fectionne dans une dimension intellectuelle (noesis) par l'intention qui se 
rapporte it l'objet connu (noema). 
II ya donc quelque chose de commun, it l'origine, entre Ia philosophie 
de Bergson et celIe de Husserl; mais l'intellectualisme du dernier est 
destine it expliciter et it developper dans son hermeneutique, ce qu'il y 
a deja d"intellectuel' ou de Iogique dans I'anti-intellectualisme de Berg-
son. II est alors evident qu'ici l'on ne doit pas considerer comme "vrai 
bergsonisme" ce que la pensee de Bergson fut dans sa realite historique, 
mais plutot ce qu'elle aurait dil etre si elle avait developpe sa doctrine 
zu den Sachen selbst, et si elle avait uni l'intelligence et Ia vie, par cette 
categorie d'unite transcendantale, dont toute sa speculation n'a jamais 
explicite l'exigence. Et c'est precisement ce manque d'un usage Iogique 
de Ia categorie d'unite que Ingarden - en eleve de Husserl- reproche a 
Bergson, comme nous allons voir tout a I'heure dans Ia demiere partie 
de Ia presente conference. Les phenomenologues, donc, eux-memes at-
tentifs au cours des Erlebnisse et finalement reintegres (apres Ia suspen-
sion purificatrice de l' epoche) dans la Lebenswelt (monde de Ia vie) sem-
blent affirmer paradoxalement que Bergson a eu Ie tort de n'etre pas 
assez 'bergsonien'. Mais je ne veux pas souligner cette paradoxale criti-
que, qui ressemble plutot a une dispute entre amoureux et par Ia meme 
a une manifestation d'amour, sans dire qu'en eifet Ies points extremes 
de ces deux theories s'attirent et, en meme temps, se repoussent, par une 
sorte de magnetisme bipolaire ou par une schellingienne philosophie de 
I'identite entre Ia nature (bathos) et I'esprit (eidos). Or, comme ces points 
extremes se rejoignent, il est possibile de prouver que Ia phenomenologie 
eidetique, elle meme se developpe dans la direction d'une philosophie de 
Ia profondeur et de la vie. Pour cela, Husserl peut se rencontrer avec 
Bergson, non seulement par Ie developpement du bergsonisme en tant 
que philosophie theoretique (dans ce cas c'est Bergson qui va a Ia ren-
contre de Husserl); mais encore par l'accueil du dynamisme vital et du 
devenir temporel dans les structures memes de l'interiorite transcendan-

tale (et cette fois c'est Hussed qui va a la rencontre de Bergson) par la 
recherche de la Lebenswelt 4 . 
Ce developpement a eu, en France, son expression existentielle dans 
la pensee de Merleau-Ponty, qui a etudie la philosophie de Bergson et 
qui a insere Ie temps vecu dans Ie cog ito cartesien. II y un developpe-
ment analogue en Italie, dans la philosophie de Enzo Paci, qui a reconnu 
Ie rapport de l'inter-subjectivite vivante dans I'ego transcendantal, vecu 
en premiere personne en chacun de nous. Vne fois de plus l'eidos et 
l' elan vital tendent a se completer reciproquement, car Ie 'vrai' berg-
sonisme ne peut rester anti-intellectualiste, devant accuellir dans les mo-
dules de la mathesis universalis les phenomenes vitaux, tandis qu'en 
meme temps les structures de l'evolution creatrice s'ouvrent, en suivant 
necessairement certaines lignes de reproduction et obeissant a un plan 
logique general qui en assure Ie developpement dans la meme ouverture. 
Tout cela n'a pas ete seulement suggere par la derniere philosophie 
de Husserl: mais aussi par l'epilogue de l'ecole. II faut bien se souvenir 
d'Ingarden, a qui, en 1917, Edith Stein ecrivait: "Ich habe in der letzten 
Zeit immer neue St6sse von Manuskripten geordnet und bin eben jetzt 
auf das Konvolut 'Zeitbewusstsein' gestossen. Wie wichtig die Sachen 
sind, wissen Sie ja am besten: fUr die Lehre von der Konstitution und 
fUr die Auseinandersetzung mit Bergson und, wie mir scheint, auch mit 
andern, z.B. Natorp". 5 
Si en 1917 il y avait une entente entre R. Ingarden et E. Stein pour 
resoudre les problemes de la constitution a la lumiere du bergsonisme, 
on peut comprendre la reference de la philo sophie d'Ingarden a la re-
alite du 'moi' individuel, qui n'est pas Ie "unbeteiligter Zuschauer" (spec-
tateur impartiel) de sa propre vie, mais qui vit vraiment dans sa concrete 
experience. Ingarden, "critique de Bergson", a peut-etre de Berg-
son meme a opposer a l'idealisme transcendantal de Husserl (ou plutot 
d'une certaine phase de la theorie de Husserl) une nouvelle philo sophie 
plus attentive aux exigences de la vie et de l'objectivite reelle (variable) vis 
a vis de l'objet ideal de la Wesenschau de Husserl (immuable). 
Deja a l'epoque de G6ttingen (1914), Ingarden proposait a Husserl ses 
etudes sur la duree pure, dont Ie maitre reconnaissait l'analogie "mit der 
urspriinglichen erlebten Dauer"; l'importance de cette approche d'In-
garden avec la phenomenologie est reconnue par Ie meme philosophe 
polonais, qui en ce temps la pensait a deux "Hauptthemen": Ie berg-

144 
MARIO SANCIPRIANO 
sonisme et l'idealisme. "Meine wissenschaftlichen Gespdiche mit Husserl 
kreisten urn einige Hauptthemen, die mir aus verschiedenen Grunden 
wichtig waren. Einerseits waren es Fragen, die mit meiner Bergson-
Arbeit in Zusammenhang standen, anderseits aber Probleme, die den 
Idealismus Husserls betrafen" 6. A ce propos, nous allons considerer la 
critique d'Ingarden du bergsonisme. On connait son idee a propos de 
l'idealisme transcendantal et sa resistence au solipsisme: il s'oppose aussi 
au vitalisme, mais il compose en harmonie l'analyse des structures ob-
jectives et Ie courant des experiences vitales 7. Meme dans Ie domaine Ie 
plus proche au 'subjectif' -Ie domaine de l'art - Ingarden recherche une 
objectivite ideale dans la structure intentionnelle, et se demande si l'ou-
vrage de l'artiste appartient aux objets ideaux immuables ou a une ob-
jectivite reelle qui peut etre transformee tout en gardant son autonomie 
d'etre (seinsautonom) en rapport avec Ie sujet de la connaissance 8 . 
La confirmation d'une philosophie de la vie dans l'ecole phenomeno-
logique, en sens creationiste, nous l'avons aussi d'apres Ie recent ouvrage 
d'une eleve d'Ingarden: Anna-Teresa Tyrnieniecka, Eros et Logos, Es-
quisse de phenomen%gie de l'interiorite creatrice (1972). Dans la specula-
tion de Madame Tymieniecka, il y a, a peu pres, quelque chose du "vrai" 
bergsonisme des phenomenologues, qui remonte a l"essor createur' et 
qui illustre "une pousse interieure vers Ie depassement non seulement des 
limites que Ie monde fixe comme cadre a notre experience, mais avant 
tout des moules que nous nous sommes forges nous memes et que nous 
perpetuons passivement comme les formes de notre participation au 
monde, a autrui, a notre propre interiorite" 9. Madame Tymieniecka 
reeoit de Valery Ie meme conflit contre Ie monde des "moules" qui pre-
existent a l'invention creatrice, conflit qui s'apaise par une activite libre 
et spirituelle, coneue comme Ie seul moyen possible de reconciliation de 
l'antagonisme entre la quete de la perfection ideale et celIe de la vie 10. 
Chez Husserl c'est de la meme faeon que s'effectue Ie passage de la phe-
nomenologie comme description de formes statiques et ideales a la con-
stitution originaire du monde de la vie 11. N'y a-t-il pas ici du "vrai berg-
sonisme"? Mais il faut, tout de meme, considerer aussi les differences 
entre la pen see de M.me Tyrnieniecka et la couche bergsonienne. Car, 
meme chez M.me Tymieniecka, la conscience constitutive agit, dans la 
rigueur de sa propre logique interieure; meme si a ce contexte s'oppose 
la conscience creatrice pour effectuer les transformations dans une faeon 

INGAR DEN ET LE 'VRAI' BERGSONISME 
145 
libre et originaire. A l'activite constitutive de la conscience, qui n'est ni 
la seule ni Ia supreme, s'oppose donc la/onction creatrice. 
Mais enfin les points extremes de la phenomenologie et de la philosophie 
de Ia vie s'eloignent et Ingarden oppose sa critique originelle a la philo-
sophie de Bergson. Dans son essai sur Intuition und Intellekt bei H. 
Bergson, Ie philosophe polonais accuse Ie fran~ais d'un relativisme lie 
a une interpretation pragmatiste. Les categories d'unite et de qua/iti? se-
raient relatives, et meme la perception exterieure serait organisee seule-
ment pour I'action. S'il n'y a plus que l'ecoulement, I'ecoulement - dit 
Ingarden - sera meme quelque chose de constant. Et alors il doit pre-
supposer la categorie d'unite qu'il pretend recuser. Dans son analyse des 
categories, Ie philosophe polonais se rapporte a I'unite implicite dans 
Ia repetition des phenomenes evolutifs 12. L'idee de repetition ne va pas 
sans celles d'identite et d'unite: "Admettons, ecrit Ingarden, que nous 
ayons une intuition pure et que nous puissions saisir immediatement Ie 
flux. reel de la conscience. II n 'y a alors selon lui (Bergson) plus de schemes, 
I'aspect statique est elimine. Etant donne l'identification des categories 
et des schemes, il n'y a donc ni forme, ni qualite, ni etat, il n'y a absoIu-
ment rien qui soit constant. Tout est flux ou mieux, il n'y a plus ici qu'un 
ecoulement perpetuel, une continuite de nuances perpetuellement nou-
velles. Mais non, il n'y a meme pas ecoulement, car l'ecoulement serait 
quelque chose de constant, ce dont, dans Ie cas de saisie absolue de la 
conscience dans la duree pure, il ne saurait etre question." 13 
Ingarden pense qu'on devrait conclure qu'il n'est meme plus possibile 
de saisir la "duree pure", car cette demiere se dissout dans Ie devenir et, 
avec elIe, se dissout la structure de fa conscience, la structure par excellence, 
celIe qui appartient a la conscience en tant que telle, et qui constitue Ie 
fondement permanent de la possibilite de toute saisie 14. 
En phenomenologie, a mon avis, il faut se demander quelle est la racine 
du "moi fondamental" de Bergson, sinon l' "identisches Ich" de Hussed, 
car Ie sujet ou demeure "fondamental" en soi et pour soi, ou s'evanouit 
dans Ie chaos d'une multiplicite d'experiences. Et bien, la critique d'In-
garden, se rapporte vraiment a la racine profonde du bergsonisme et pose 
encore la demiere question de la philosophie transcendantale: 'D'ou la 
constitution de la forme temporelle?' Et encore: 'D'ou l'elan originel de 
Ia vie?' Cette critique se rapporte a une unite originelle et fonciere qui 

146 
MARIO SANCIPRIANO 
depasse Ie flux des Erlebnisse: elle tend a comprendre la forma fiuens', 
une et ideale, sans s'arreter a la multiplicite du 'jiuxus formarum'. 15 
En effet Ingarden pose la question si la "duree pure" est independante 
de n'importe quelle forme categoriale, et dit en particulier: "So war fUr 
mich vor allem die Frage interessant, ob die duree pure bzw. die sich in 
ihr volIziehenden urspriinglichen Ergebnisse wirklich - wie Bergson be-
hauptet - von jeder 'Form', und insbesondere von jeder kategorialen 
Form frei sind und ob sie dabei in urspriinglichen Sinne zeitlich oder, 
wenn man so sagen darf, dauernd sind. Anderseits war fUr mich zweifel-
haft, ob Ie temps also - in Husserls Sprache : die konstituirte Zeit -
wirklich schon eine Raumstruktur aufweist (Bergson sagt ja oft direkt 
Ie temps homogene ou l'espace), eine Struktur die nach Bergson fUr die 
intelIektuelIe Auffassung charakteristisch und eben damit auf die Hand-
lung relativ sein solI." 16 
Le sens originaire (ursprunglich) du temps dans la structure des phe-
nomenes, non pas Ie simple commencement et la suite: voila la tache du 
phenomenologue, qui distingue Ie temps subjectif et relatif (psycologi-
que) du temps "constitue", qui se manifeste de trois fa~ons: (1) Ie temps 
constitue reel, mais tout de meme qualitatif; (2) Ie temps physique quan-
titatif et "spatial" et (3) la duree reelle des experiences vitales, se fondant 
comme les notes dans une meIodie. II ne s'agit pas de la somme d'instants 
successifs; mais de l'originaire Urstiftung de la realite temporelle (ur-
sprunglicher Zeitf/uss). La structure du temps (konstituirte Zeit) ne peut 
pas etre relative, car elle repond vraiment a des formes categoriales. 
J'ajouterais qu'ici il ne s'agit pas seulement d'une "conscience constitu-
tive" du temps, mais aussi d'une ouverture de la conscience creatrice sur 
Ie 'possible', car Ie temps meme est ouvert sur l'avenir, c'est a dire sur 
les possibilites futures, dans une dynamique intentionelIe, qui envisage 
la realite du monde possible, ainsi que les possibilites du monde reel. 
Ingarden conclut que Bergson n'a pas fait un bon usage de la tbeorie 
de l'intelligence, en relativisant les categories: meme si sa tbeorie du 
mecanisme cinematografique de la pen see peut exercer une fonction d'ex-
plication de certaines illusions mecanistes; et en ce sens cette tbeorie 
peut etre acceptee. De la meme fa~on Ingarden defend la tbeorie de l'es-
sence, que l'on ne peut soumettre a un radical changement sans que 
l'identite de l'objet en resulte aneantie. Cette identite est une categorie 
formelle qu'on ne peut relativiser et a laquelle l'unite est immanente: 

INGARDEN ET LE 'VRAI' BERGSON IS ME 
147 
d'apres Ingarden 1'unite peut se distinguer en effective, essentielle, fonc-
tionelle et harmonique. 
J'ajouterai qu'i1 y a une unite de toutes ces unites, qui est it 1'origine 
et au bout intentionne1 de la conscience, et c'est l'unite pure. Cette unite 
profonde et originaire qui appartient au domaine de la conscience trans-
cendantale est precisement it l'interieur de la "Zeitbewusstsein": elle n'est 
pas un simple element de la serie temporelle, mais constitue l'arche me-
tatemporelle, qui rend possible l'ordre de la succession. Elle est l'unite 
du temps, qui se realise dans tous les temps. Cette unite est done tran-
scendante, comme unite pure, et transcendantale comme principe d'uni-
fication de l'experience. Mais cela nous renvoie it une envergure meta-
physique que la phenomenologie peut bien annoncer, mais non rejoindre.

11 Bergson oppose 1a multiplicite distinte de l'espace a 1a penetration reciproque de la 
duree pure: "Dans les deux cas, experience signifie conscience; mais dans Ie premier, la 
conscience s'epanouit au dehors, et s'exteriorise par rapport a e1le meme dans l'exacte 
mesure oil elle apen;oit des choses exterieures les unes aux autres; dans Ie second elle rentre 
en e1le, se ressaisit et s' approfondit" (E. Bergson, L 'intuition philosophique [1911]. 'Oeuvres', 
PUF, Paris, 1959, p. 1361). 
12 En revision du bergsonisme, plusieurs auteurs arriventjusqu'a l'application des catego-
ries mathematiques aux phenomenes vitaux. Selon D'Arcy Wentwort Tompson -lui aussi 
critique de Bergson -Ies formes ne sont pas seulement Ie produit d'une invention libre et 
creatrice de la part de la nature et n'exc1uent point une approche avec Ie modele-mathemati-
que; c'est-a-dire que la matiere vivante est susceptible de recevoir, par approximation, une 
loi numerique meme dans la continuelle variation des formes. II se refere a Haton de la 
Goupi1liere qui dit: "on a souvent l'occasion de saisir dans la nature un refiet des formes 
rigoureuses qu'etudie 1a geometrie" (D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, On Growth and Form, 
University Press, Cambridge [1917], 2me edit. 1959, vol. II, p. 1030). Thompson se sou-
vient aussi de Bergson: "M. Bergson repudiates, with peculiar confidence, the application 
of mathematics to biology". Le meme auteur reproduit une affirmation de 1a bergsonienne 
Evolution creatrice: "lei Ie calcul a prise, tout au plus, sur certains phenomenes de destruc-
tion organique. De 1a creation organique, au contraire, des phenomenes evolutifs qui con-
stituent proprement 1a vie, nous n'entrevoyons meme pas comment nous pourrions les 
soumettre a un traitement mathematique" (Bergson, Evol. creat., 20). En ltalie les etudes 
de V. Volterra et d'autres auteurs ont de plus en plus developpe l'application de 1a matM-
matique aux sciences biologiques, meme dans Ie calcul des probabilites.

DIE FUNKTION DES 
KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS IN EINEM 
'STUDIUM FUR DIE SEELENMALER' 
Die phiinomenologische Studie einer Erziihlphase in M. C. Wielands 
'Geschichte des Agathon' 
"So seltsam es klingt, so gewiss ist es doch, dass die Krafte der Einbil-
dung dasjenige weit iibersteigen, was die Natur unseren Sinnen darstellt: 
... sie erschafft eine neue Natur, und versetzt uns in der Tat in fremde 
Welten, welche nach ganz andem Gesetzen als die unsrigen regiert 
werden." Seine Phantasie, berichtet Wielands Agathon, sei nicht zuletzt 
durch die prachtige Schilderung Pindars, "bald zurn Gastmahle der 
Gatter, bald in die Elysischen Taler, die Wohnung seliger Schatten", 
versetzt worden. 1 Ubertragt man Agathons Beobachtung in die Begriffs-
sprache Roman Ingardens, so spricht man von Wahmehmungsakten des 
Bewusstseins, die sich bei der Lektiire eines literarischen Kunstwerks 
einstellen. Christoph Martin Wieland lasst den HeIden in seinem Roman 
Geschichte des Agathon von Kraften der Einbildung berichten, die eine 
eigengesetzliche Welt schaffen und dasjenige weit iibersteigen, "was die 
Natur unseren Sinnen darstellt." Roman Ingarden definiert diesen Vor-
gang in seinen Untersuchungen iiber die Grundstruktur und Seinsweise 
des literarischen Kunstwerks 2 als intentionale Bewusstseinsakte, die 
die im literarischen Kunstwerk potentiell enthaltene fiktionale Welt zur 
anschaulichen Erfassung bringen. Beide Termini, obgleich ihre theore-
tische Begriindung voneinander verschieden ist, versuchen zu erklaren, 
wie eine durch Worte entworfene fiktionale Welt im Bewusstsein des 
Lesers entsteht. Weder Wielands durch 'Krafte der Einbildung' er-
schaffene 'neue Natur' noch Ingardens zur Anschauung kommende 
Gegenstandlichkeiten sind mit Sachverhalten in der empirischen Welt 
zu verwechseln. Bei beiden Begriffen, Einbildungskraft und Bewusst-
seinserfassungsakte, geht es urn zwei Dinge: die durch den Dichter rein 
intentional geschaffene und im literarischen Werk 'als Moglichkeit und 
Anspruch' 3 enthaltene fiktionale Welt; und die Konkretisation dieser 
Welt durch intentionale Bewusstseinsakte des lesenden Subjekts.

menologische Reduktion erreichten Kategorien, die Ingarden in seiner 
'Wesensanatomie' des literarischen Kunstwerks herausgearbeitet hat, 
auf eine Erzahlphase in Wielands Agathon angewendet werden k6nnen. 
Dieses bewusst gemachte Erfassungserlebnis soIl zeigen, wie die raum-
zeitliche Struktur in einem dichterischen Gebilde, das vom Dichter rein 
intentional entworfen wurde, im Bewusstsein des Lesers entsteht. Zum 
Schluss der Analyse sollte damit auch die Frage beantwortet sein, ob die 
Kunstabsicht des Autors einzusehen ist, ob sie gelungen scheint. 
Ingarden teilt sein abstrakt gefasstes Strukturgebilde des literarischen 
Kunstwerks in verschiedene Schichten auf, denen er spezifische Bewusst-
seinsakte zuordnet. In Wahrnehmungsakten nimmt ein subjektives Be-
wusstsein W ortzeichen, W ortlaute und sprachlautliche Gebilde h6herer 
Ordnung wahr. In Bedeutungserfassungsakten richtet es sich auf die 
Erfassung von Wortbedeutungen und Bedeutungseinheiten der verschie-
denen Stufen. Phantasiemassiges Erschauen bringt die dargestellten 
Gegenstandlichkeiten und Situationen zur Anschauung. Da die Erfas-
sungserlebnisse vielschichtig und kompliziert sind, kann das anschauende 
Subjekt ein Werk nur in 'perspektivischer Verkurzung' erleben, so dass 
einige Erkenntnis- oder Erlebnisakte zentral im Bewusstsein vollzogen 
werden, andere hingegen nur mitvollzogen oder miterlebt. Fur die an-
schauliche Erfassung der fiktionalen Welt ist die Schicht der dargestellten 
Gegenstandlichkeiten das Wesentliche.4 
Es ist zwischen Gegenstanden zu unterscheiden, die als Korrelate 
eines nominal oder verbal entworfenen Sachverhaltes entstehen und 
gegenstandlichen Kategorien der materialen Welt ahnlich sind, und den 
Gegenstandlichkeiten. Gegenstandlichkeiten bedeuten alles das, was 
beim Lesen eines literarischen Textes thematisch erfasst wird, wie Ge-
schehnisse, Personen, Dinge, Zustande. Die dargestellten Gegenstand-
lichkeiten haben Unbestimmtheits- oder Leerstellen, da zum Beispiel 
raumliche und zeitliche Verhaltnisse nur als Ausschnitt oder gerafft dar-
gestellt werden k6nnen. Diese Unbestimmtheitsstellen werden erst in 
der Konkretisation ausgefiillt, das heisst, sie werden durch phantasie-
massiges Erleben eines subjektiven Bewusstseins aktualisiert. "Dabei 
gehen die konkret erlebten Ansichten unvermeidlich uber den schema-
tisierten Gehalt der paratgehaltenen Ansichten im Werke selbst hinaus, 
indem das blosse Schema in verschiedener Hinsicht durch konkrete 
Elemente ausgefiillt wird." (362) 5

Bewusstsein orientiert sich in der fiktionalen Welt mittels eines Orien-
tierungsmediums. Dieses kann in einer oder in mehreren Personen, in 
gegenstandlichen Situationen oder im Ich eines allwissenden Erzahlers 
liegen, der sich im Akt des Erzahlens konstituiert. Durch das Orientier-
ungsmediurn gesehen oder erlebt, erschliessen sich Raumlichkeit und 
Zeitlichkeit im thematischen Zusammenhang des Hauptgeschehens. Die 
raurnlichen Verhaltnisse einer gegenstandlichen Phase entstehen durch 
lokale Zeichen, die allgemeine oder individualisierende Ansichten ent-
werfen, und der zeitliche Horizont erschliesst sich durch temporale 
Zeichen. Dargestellt wird das, was die Zeit erfiillt, nicht jedoch die Zeit 
selbst. Temporale Zeichen konnen sich auf die empirische Zeit beziehen 
und enthiillen dann eine chronologische Geschehensfolge, die oftmals 
als zusammengefasst oder -gerafft dargestellt wird. Wird das Geschehen 
jedoch in das Innere eines Orientierungsmediums verlegt, enthiillt sich 
der zeitliche Horizont als erlebte Zeit, und es bedarf dann keiner tem-
poralen Zeichen, urn den zeitlichen Horizont abzugrenzen. 
Nicht alle von Ingarden phanomenologisch untersuchten und begriff-
lich bestimmten Schichten, die die Wesensstruktur des literarischen 
Werkes ausmachen, werden in dieser Studie beriicksichtigt. Es wird 
lediglich vorgefiihrt, wie Raum- und Zeitstruktur entstehen und wie die 
wechselnden Orientierungsmedien dazu beitragen, eine kurze gegen-
standliche Erzahlphase als anschauliches Ganze entstehen zu lassen. 
Die mimetische Substanz der zur analysierenden Szene in Wielands 
Roman ist einfach: Agathon findet unverhofft die schone Danae wieder. 
Dieses vollkommenste Modell aller Vorziige des weiblichen Geschlechts, 
"wenn man die strenge Tugend ausnimmt" (114), hatte er durch den 
Sophisten Hippias in Smyrna kennengelernt und sie als Inkarnation 
seines Begriffs von idealischer Vollkommenheit schwarmerisch und hin-
gebend geliebt. Wie die kluge Danae noch wahrend der uneingeschrank-
ten Verzauberung ihres Geliebten bereits befiirchtete, hatte er sie trotz-
dem verlassen, weil "nicht sie selbst, sondem (die) idealische Vollkom-
menheit der eigentliche Gegenstand seiner Liebe" (266) gewesen war. 
Nachdem seine Seele "aus einer Uberfiillung mit Vergniigen" (268) her-
aus zur Wirklichkeit erwacht war, horte er plotzlich "die Stimme der 
Tugend" (269) wieder. Als Hippias dann auch noch "endlich das Ge-
heimnis des wahren Standes der schonen Danae" (280) preisgegeben 

152 
IRMGARD KOWATZKI 
hatte, glaubte Agathon sich "von ihrem Charakter und moralischen 
Werte betrogen." (271) Denn Danae war von der beriihmten Aspasia 
von Milet in "die Kunst der Galanterie oder der weiblichen Sophistik" 
(120) eingefiihrt worden und nacheinander die GeHihrtin des Alcibiades 
und des jiingeren Cyprus gewesen. Beider Grossziigigkeit hatte sie "in 
den Stand gesetzt, ihre einzige Sorge sein zu lassen, wie sie auf die an-
genehmste Art leben wollte." (123) 
Der raumzeitliche Hintergrund der fiktionalen Welt, wie er sich bis zu 
Beginn der Episode stabilisiert hat, solI nun veranschaulicht werden, so 
dass sich das punktuelle Geschehen des Sich-Wiederfindens der Lieben-
den in die Orientierungsebene des Hauptgeschehens einordnen Hisst. 
Nach seiner heimlichen Flucht aus Smyrna hatte Agathon sich "in den 
Zirkel des Privatlebens" (468) zurUckgezogen, urn sich mit Wissenschaft 
und bildender Kunst zu beschaftigen. Wie schon des ofteren befand er 
sich eben jetzt auf dem Landgut seines Freundes Kritolaor. Er und sein 
Freund hatten sich an einer Jagd beteiligt und waren dabei "von einem 
Ungewitter iiberrascht" (471) worden. Die Grenzen des fiktionalen 
Raums, aus dem heraus Agathon und Kritolaos in den Blickpunkt 
riicken, bleiben unscharf. Denn der Erzahler, der sich hier im Akt des 
Erzlihlens konstituiert und als Orientierungszentrum dient, obgleich er 
die dargestellten Gegenstlindlichkeiten oftmals vom Blickpunkt Agath-
ons und des Kritolaos aus anvisiert, liefert nur sparsame lokale Zeichen, 
die ganz allgemeine Raumtypen zur Schau stellen. Die Freunde irren 
durch einen Wald, und als sie endlich da herausgefunden haben, finden 
sie sich in einer Gegend wieder. In dieser unbestimmbaren offenen Weite 
erscheint ein einsames Landhaus als der einzige Ort, "wohin sie ihre 
Zuflucht nehmen" (471) konnen. Doch dieser zunlichst rein nominal 
entworfene Gegenstand erscheint sogleich unter Mitschwingen einer 
ganz bestimmten emotionalen Bedeutsamkeit: das Haus sieht "einem 
verwiinschten Schlosse" (472) lihnlich. Die Rliurnlichkeiten in dem Land-
haus werden dann zunlichst wieder ganz allgemein vorgestellt. Die 
Freunde kommen "vor dem liussersten Tor" (472) des Hauses an und 
werden in einen Saal genotigt, der nur dadurch zu einer individualisieren-
den Ansicht wird, dass seine Wlinde als mit einigen Gemlilden ausgeziert 
erwlihnt werden. Sogleich jedoch entsteht ein zweiter Raurn, und zwar 
durch das Auftauchen einer Sklavin, von der berichtet wird, dass sie 
nach Ansichtigwerden der Fremden "hastig dem Zimmer ihrer Ge-

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 153 
bieterin" (472) zuHiuft. Durch ihren Ausruf: "Und wer meinen Sie wohl, 
meine Gebieterin, ... dass unten im Saal ist?" (472), kommt ausserdem 
ein zweites Stockwerk in den Blick, und dieses wiederum liisst eine Treppe 
mit erscheinen. 
All die hier gegebenen lokalen Zeichen vermitteln allgemeinste Um-
risse und haben nur die Funktion, die diumlichen Verhiiltnisse in dieser 
Szene iiberhaupt erst einmal zu konstituieren. Doch sie enthalten ge-
niigend anschauliche Elemente, aus denen sich geschlossene Innenraume 
strukturieren lassen. Denn mit Tor, Saal, Zimmer und Gemalden ent-
stehen Wiinde, und die Anordnung von Saal und Zimmer als unten und 
oben macht eine Treppe ansichtig. Das Zimmer der Dame wird durch 
ein Sofa, auf das sie beim Horen des Namens Agathon ohnmiichtig 
zuriicksinkt, als private Sphiire ausgewiesen, wiihrend der durch Ge-
miilde geschmiickte Saal einen mehr formellen Anstrich hat. Durch diese 
sparsam entworfenen Gegenstiinde verfiigt der Erziihler geschickt iiber 
die disparaten riiumlichen Verhiiltnisse im Schloss. Er stellt sie als ge-
rafften Raum zur Schau, und doch so, dass sich die Raumverhiiltnisse 
zu einem anschaubaren Ganzen fiigen. 
Ebenso gibt er eine zeitlich geraffte Darstellung der chronologischen 
Abliiufe des Geschehens, und auch hier bedient er sich nur allgemeiner 
Zeitangaben. Die im Wald herumirrenden Freunde wissen "eine geraume 
Zeit" (471) nicht, wo sie sind. Sie finden sich dann 'endlich' aus dem 
Wald heraus. Trotzdem vermitteln diese beiden Zeitangaben Ansichten 
aufeinanderfolgender Zeitphasen. Von dem Augenblick an jedoch, wo 
das geheimnisvolle Landhaus erwiihnt ist, konstituiert sich Zeitlichkeit 
fiir die Freunde vornehmlich als durch den inneren Sinn erlebte Zeit, so 
dass die zeitfiillenden Erlebnisse nicht als liickenlos aufeinanderfolgende 
Phasen dargestellt zu werden brauchen. Wiihrend Agathon und Krito-
laos den Weg bis zum iiussersten Tor des wie ein verwiinschtes Schloss 
aussehenden Hauses zuriicklegen, sprechen sie iiber die geheimnisvolle 
Bewohnerin. Einmal im Innem des Landhauses, erfahren sie die Auf-
merksamkeit der Bediensteten, die sie auf ihre Bitten hin eingelassen 
haben. Sie werden gastlich bedient, und Agathon versinkt in Betrachtung 
einiger Gemiilde an der Wand. Auch als die Sklavin nun zum Orien-
tierungsmedium wird und der Erziihler voriibergehend verschwindet, 
bleiben die dargestellten Zeitphasen weiterhin erfiillt, das heisst, indivi-
duell erlebt, und die hier und da eingeftochtenen Zeitangaben beziehen 

154 
IRMGARD KOW ATZKI 
sich nur auf dieses Erleben. Die Sklavin namlich, die Agathon "einige 
Minuten" mit grosser Aufmerksamkeit angestarrt hat, verliert sich "auf 
einmal aus dem Saale" und eilt "hastig dem Zimmer ihrer Gebieterin 
zu" (472). Nachdem jene dann aus einer Ohnmacht aufgewacht ist und 
mit der Sklavin spricht, kommt sie als "die schone Danae" zur Ansicht 
und wird damit auch gleich zum Orientierungsmedium. Und weiterhin 
konstituieren sich die einander ab16senden Zeitphasen als erfiillte Zeit. 
Auf Danaes Ohnmacht folgt ein aufgeregter Dialog mit der Sklavin; 
nach diesem W ortwechsel befindet sich Danae in heftigster Gemiitsbe-
wegung, im Streit mit einander bekampfenden Tendenzen. Davon be-
richtet nun wieder der Erzahler, weil Danae vollig den Abstand zu sich 
selbst verloren hat, und er bemerkt, dass 'eine Erzahlung alles dessen, 
was in ihrem Gemiite vorging", etliche Bogen ausfiillen wiirde, "wiewohl 
es weniger Zeit als sechs Minuten einnahm." (474) 
Zur gleichen Zeit wird auch Agathon im Saale unten von heftigen 
seelischen Bewegungen bedrangt. Wahrend Danae in Ohnmacht raUt, 
heftig mit der Sklavin redet, immer aufgeregter wird, steht Agathon vor 
einem ganz bestimmten Gemalde, das ihn in unbeschreibliche sich stei-
gernde Verwirrung versetzt. Er glaubt, "es fUr das namliche zu erkennen, 
vor welchem er in einem Gartensaale der Danae oft Viertel stun den lang 
in bewundernder Entziickung gestanden" (476) hatte. Auch sein Gemiit 
ist nun durch widerstreitende Empfindungen beunruhigt. Wie Danae 
wird er zunehmend verwirrter und aufgeregter. 
Die beiden Liebenden haben sich zur gleichen Zeit, obwohl raumlich 
voneinander getrennt, in den gleichen Zustand hochster Agitation hin-
eingesteigert. Was sie noch trennt, ist ein Teil ihres Bewusstseinsinhalts, 
der sie die seit Agathons Flucht individuell erlebten Reaktionen auf diese 
Trennung noch einmal, und zwar in wenige Minuten zusammengedrangt, 
erleben lasst. Dieser Sachverhalt ist als innere Zustande der beiden vor-
gefiihrt. In Danaes Herzen kampfen Liebe, Stolz und Tugend urn den 
Vorrang, als sie nicht mehr daran zweifelt, dass Agathon in ihrem Hause 
ist. Agathon hingegen ist bemiiht, den Widerspruch zwischen dem 
Wunsch, die Dame des Hauses moge Danae sein, mit dem Wunsch, sie 
moge nicht Danae sein, zu losen, bis schliesslich das Verlangen nach der 
Geliebten aIle nicht miteinander zu vereinbarenden Empfindungen in 
sich aufhebt. 
An diesem Punkt miissen szenische Anordnung und Befindlichkeit der 

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 155 
Hauptpersonen fiir die Dauer eines Erzahlereinschubs durchgehalten 
werden. Die Konstellation ist wie folgt: 1m Saale unten stehen Agathon 
und Kritolaos, dieser neugierig, was sich hinter dem aufgeregten und 
ungeduldigen Verhalten seines Freundes verbirgt; jener nicht imstande, 
seiner Aufregung Herr zu werden oder seine Ungeduld zu ziigeln. 1m 
Zimmer eine Treppe hoher sitzt Danae auf ihrem Sofa und ringt darum, 
ihre Liebe zur Tugend vor dem Verlangen nach Agathon zu schiitzen. 
Hier drangt sich plotzlich der Erzahler ein, doch nicht in der Rolle 
des Erzahlers. Die hat er zugunsten des Mitspielers im fiktionalen Ge-
schehen aufgegeben. Zugleich bringt er einen fiktiven Leser mit, den er 
auffordert, sich urn eine asthetische Einstellung zu bemiihen, wenn er in 
dem sich gleich enthiillenden Geschehen aktiv mitwirkt. Dies hat er zu 
sagen: Selbst wenn Agathon im Verlauf des Geschehens nicht wie ein 
Held handelt, ja selbst wenn Danae ihren weiblichen Stolz vergessen 
sollte, ware eine Beurteilung dieser unkonventionellen Verhaltensweisen 
"vermoge der moralischen Begriffe" (477) nicht angebracht. Kein Mora-
list, also, nur der Leser, der "schonen See len glaubt" (477), kann diesem 
Agathon und dieser Danae die Menschlichkeit zugestehen, die allen ge-
sellschaftlich vorgeschriebenen Verhaltensweisen iiberlegen ist: Sie 
denken nicht "wie gewohnliche Leute" (477) und handeln so, wie sie 
handeln, weil sie sind, was sie sind. 
Wahrend dieses Exkurs' hat der Erzahler den schwer atmenden 
Agathon, der mit pochendem Herzen dem Sklaven gefolgt ist, in das 
Vorgemach der unbekannten Dame transportiert. Kritolaos, obgleich 
das nicht erwahnt wird, ist dem Freund zur Seite geblieben. Hier beginnt 
die eigentliche Wiedersehens-Szene. "Die schone Danae erwartete, auf 
einem Sofa sitzend, ihren Besuch mit so vieler Starke, als eine weibliche 
Seele nur immer zu haben fahig sein mag, die zugleich so zartlich und 
lebhaft ist, als eine solche Seele sein kann." (477) Dieser Sachverhalt, die 
schone Danae auf einem Sofa sitzend, verweist sogleich darauf, dass 
Danae der Tiir zugewandt ist, und es ist nun eine ganz bestimmte Danae, 
die sich als Ansicht aufdrangt. An sich vermittelt das Adjektiv 'schon' 
nur den Typus einer Ansicht. Hier jedoch formt es zusammen mit dem 
Namen 'Danae' den Bedeutungskomplex 'die schone Danae', den man 
durch Kenntnis der vorhergegangenen Handlung sogleich als innere An-
sicht aktualisieren kann: Danae ist die schonste der weiblichen So-
phistinnen, hatte, "die Grossen und die Wei sen der Republik in ihren 

156 
IRMGARD KOWATZKI 
Ruhestunden" (121) ergotzt, und ihre Wirkung auf Agathon ist immer 
noch so stark, dass dieser in eben diesem Augenblick vor Erwartung 
zitternd vor der Tiir zu ihrem Zimmer steht. Die schone Danae ist 
ausserdem, wie man sogleich mitvermeint, die Frau, die Agathon ge-
liebt hat und von ihm verlassen und verletzt worden ist. Ferner weiss 
man, dass sie als die geheimnisvolle Schlossdame seit langer Zeit bereits 
in volliger Weltabgeschiedenheit lebt. 
Was ausser dem Sofa, auf dem sie sitzt, in ihrem Zimmer steht, bleibt 
ungesagt. Es bedarf auch keiner Priizisierung der sie umgebenden Riium-
lichkeit. Denn diese an sich rein schematisierte Ansicht, das Sofa als ein-
ziges nominal entworfenes Zeichen flir ein Zimmer zu gebrauchen, hat zu-
sammen mit dem aktualisierten Bedeutungskomplex 'die schone Danae' 
ausreichende Suggestivkraft. Die Unbestimmtheitsstellen in der Ansicht 
des Zimmers lassen sich mit einer emotional und sinnlich verdichteten At-
mosphiire ohne Miihe ausflillen, obgleich kein genauer Sachverhalt 
nominal entworfen oder verbal intendiert worden ist. An dieser Stelle, 
die ein unmittelbar bevorstehendes passioniertes Geschehen verspricht, 
mischt sich der Erziihler schnell noch einmal ein, urn ein zweites Mal an 
die von ihm vorher bereits empfohlene iisthetische Einstellung zu ge-
mahnen. "Aber was in ihrem Herzen vorging, mogen Leserinnen, welche 
im Stande sind sich an ihre Stelle zu setzen, in ihrem eigenen lesen." (477) 
Er hatte vorher das Leserpublikum ganz allgemein angesprochen. "Hier 
ist es, wo wir mehr als jemals zu wiinschen versucht sind, dass dieses 
Buch von niemand gelesen werden m5chte, der keine schonen Seelen 
glaubt." (477) Jetzt richtet er sich jedoch ausdriicklich an seine Leserin-
nen. Da diese, wie er annimmt, Danaes Geflihle nachempfinden konnen, 
will er besonders sie vor der Gefahr bewahren, dass sie moralisch werten. 
Er tut das, indem er auf seine im vorhergegangenen Satz vorgenommene 
leicht ironische Erwiihnung von 'weiblichen Seelen' anspielt. Danaes 
Seele hat zwar Stiirke, gibt er zu, aber die kann sich doch nur als zwar 
schone, immerhin jedoch als Schwiiche iiussern. Da er bereits weiss, dass 
diese Schwiiche siegen wird, sollen auch seine Leserinnen keine Stand-
haftigkeit erwarten, wo keine moglich wiire. Danaes Gemiitszustand ist 
dazu iiusserst labil, gibt er zu verstehen. Denn die ganz allgemein ge-
fahrdete Konstitution der weiblichen Seele ist bei ihr durch Temperament 
und besondere Verwundbarkeit gesteigert. Ihre Seele ist "zugleich so 
ziirtlich und lebhaft" (477) als eine weibliche Seele nur sein kann. 

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 157 
Bisher hat der Erzahler Danaes inneren Zustand so mitgeteilt, wie er 
ihn verstanden wissen will. Durch diese Schilderung hat er sie jedoch in 
Nahstellung geriickt, und er kann nur noch naher an sie heranfiihren, 
wenn er in ihr Bewusstsein eindringt. Das tut er, ohne jedoch Danae 
zurn Orientierungsmediurn zu machen. Er teilt ihren Bewusstseinsinhalt 
einfach mit und macht ihren Gemiitszustand als gespannt verharrend, 
wenn auch in einem hochst labilen Gleichgewicht, einsichtig. "Sie wusste, 
dass Agathon einen Gefahrten hatte." (477) Der Freund wird erst jetzt 
wieder erwahnt, denn nun ist er fUr Danaes Betragen funktionell wichtig 
und wird von ihrem Bewusstsein aus anvisiert. "Dieser Umstand kam 
ihr zustatten; ... " (477) Auch dieser Sachverhalt ist noch so allgemein 
vorgestellt, dass man nur fliichtig daran denkt, 'dieser Umstand' konnte 
etwas mit einem Verhaltensmuster zu tun haben, urn das sich Danae 
bemiiht. Noch im gleichen Satz jedoch, der damit zwei verschiedene in-
tentionale Sachverhalte entwirft, die auch durch zwei verschiedene Ori-
entierungsmedien vermittelt werden, umkreist der Erzahler das Bewusst-
sein Agathons. " ... aber Agathon befand sich wenig dadurch erleichtert." 
(477) Jetzt wird die Ansicht von Agathons Befindlichkeit wieder dyna-
misch. Zuletzt hatte er mit pochendem Herzen und schwer atmend im 
V orgemach der Danae gestanden, und da steht er nun noch immer. 
Danaes und Agathons GefUhlsspannung hat sich so intensiviert, dass 
diese Gefiihle jetzt die einzigen noch erfassbaren Gegenstandlichkeiten 
sind. Die Trennungswand, die als Gegenstand vorgestellte Tiir, muss nun 
endlich fallen. 
"Die Tiir des V orzimmers wurde ihnen von der Sklavin eroffnet." 
(477) Diese rein faktische Mitteilung, durch den Erzahler gegeben, fUhrt 
einen Augenblick lang von Agathons Bewusstsein weg. Wahrend durch 
das Pronomen 'ihnen' zusammen mit der sich offnenden Tiir der Freund 
Kritolaos ansichtig wird, losen sich diese Ansichten doch schnell wieder 
auf. Denn durch die nun offene Tiir ist ein neuer raurnlicher Horizont 
entstanden, der Danae zum Mittelpunkt hat, und der wird sogleich von 
Agathons Perspektive aus abgemessen. "Er erkannte beim ersten An-
blick die Vertraute seiner Geliebten; ... " (477) Das temporale Zeichen 
'beim ersten Anblick' sagt etwas iiber seine Blickrichtung aus. Er muss 
die Augen unverwandt auf die sich offnende Tiir gerichtet haben, denn 
sein Erkennen der Sklavin geschieht momentan. Dadurch entsteht zu-
gleich auch etwas Neues in seinem Bewusstsein, was durch das nominal 

158 
IRMGARD KOWATZKI 
entworfene 'seine Geliebte' intendiert ist. Er muss sich wohl in diesem 
Augenblick seiner genossenen Liebesfreuden und seiner immer noch 
verlangenden Liebe zu Danae wieder bewusst sein. Denn die Sklavin, 
die er erkannt hat, erkennt er nicht als irgendeine Sklavin, sondern als 
'die Vertraute seiner Geliebten'. Und diese nominal entworfene Geliebte 
wird durch die Verbindung mit dem Possessivpronomen 'seine' als die 
wieder und immer noch Geliebte erkennbar. " ... und nun konnte er nicht 
mehr zweifeln, dass die Dame, die er in einigen Augenblicken sehen 
wiirde, Danae sei." (477) Agathon befindet sich in einem merkwiirdigen 
zeitlosen Zustand. Die fiktionale Wirklichkeit seines 'Hierseins' und das 
Wissen, nur durch eine kleine Veranderung seiner Blickrichtung wirk-
lich vor Danae zu stehen, vermischen sich mit der Vergegenwartigung 
seines durch sie in der Vergangenheit erlebten Gliicks. Dieser Zustand 
hat nur Danae, sich selbst und die Gegenwartigkeit der Liebe zum In-
halt, die sowohl Vergangenheit als auch Zukunft bedeutet. Sprachlich 
wird die zeitlose Prasenz der Liebe durch das Temporaladverb 'nun' ver-
mittelt. Die 'nun' - plotzlich und ausschliesslich - erlangte Gewissheit 
enthiillt zugleich, dass Agathon noch bis zu dem Augenblick gezweifelt 
hatte, ob er Danae sehen wiirde, obgleich er nichts anderes gewiinscht 
hatte. Auch das Modalverb 'konnte' - 'nun konnte er nicht mehr zwei-
feIn' - verweist auf einen ganz bestimmten Sachverhalt. Da das Zweifeln 
aufgehort hat, kann sich Agathon nur noch mit der Gewissheit des 
Wiedersehens beschaftigen, so dass Wunsch und Gegenwunsch nun end-
lich in Gewissheit und Zustimmung aufgehoben sind. 
Diese seelischen Ereignisse, zuerst yom Erzahler mitgeteilt, werden 
anschliessend durch Ansichten vorgestellt. Agathon bemiiht sich darum, 
Haltung anzunehmen. "Er raffte seinen ganzen Mut zusammen, indem 
er zitternd hinter seinem Freunde Kritolaos her wankte." (477-78) Dieser 
Versuch scheint jedoch nur dadurch - und auch nur halbwegs - zu ge-
lingen, dass er seinen inneren Zustand irgendwie neutralisiert. Denn er 
stellt sich vor, er trete der vielbesprochenen geheimnisvollen und ihm 
unbekannten "Dame" des Hauses gegeniiber. Diese schizophrene Be-
wusstseinsoperation lasst sich an dem vorhergehenden Satz, "dass die 
Dame, die er in einigen Augenblicken sehen wiirde, Danae sei", erken-
nen. Er denkt zuerst an ein Bekanntwerden mit der 'Dame', und erst 
dann verbindet er den Begriff 'Dame' mit der Geliebten Danae. Durch 
das temporale Zeichen 'in einigen Augenblicken' ist auch angedeutet, 

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 159 
dass Agathons Erleben wieder auf die Wirklichkeit bezogen ist. Dieser 
durch den Temporalsatz erstellte Bezug zur fiktionalen iiusseren Wirk-
lichkeit wird durch die individualisierende Ansicht von der geoffneten 
Tiir verstiirkt. 
In die raumzeitliche Sphiire zuriickversetzt, bewegt sich Agathon nun 
physisch auf Danae zu. "Er sah sie - wollte auf sie zugehen - konnte 
nicht - heftete seine Augen auf sie - und sank, yom Ubermass seiner 
Empfindlichkeit iiberwiiltigt, in die Arme seines Freundes zuriick." (478) 
Es gelingt ihm also keineswegs, die Heldenrolle durchzuspielen. Die An-
strengung, der es bedarf, Mut zu fassen, zeigt sich in seinen Bewegungen. 
Er wankt, er wankt sogar zitternd, hinter Kritolaos einher. Das 'Uber-
mass seiner Empfindlichkeit' ist syntaktisch und auch visuell veran-
schaulicht. Kurze Siitze, abgehackt aneinandergereihte Sachverhalte, 
durch Bindestriche verbunden, zeugen von Agathons Anstrengung, die 
Motornerven unter Kontrolle zu bekommen .. Er erkennt Danae, ohne 
sie erst anzusehen. Er will auf sie zueilen, doch sein Korper gehorcht ihm 
nicht. Ais er dann seine Augen auf sie heftet, wird er so von seinem 
Gefiihl iiberwiiltigt, dass er nur noch in die Arme des Freundes zuriick-
sinken kann. Das Verb 'zuriicksinken' veranschaulicht die Vedinderung 
in der Position der Freunde zueinander. Agathon war hinter Kritolaos 
einhergewankt. Er muss ihn durch sein Zueilen auf Danae iiberholt 
haben, so dass jener nun bereit steht, den zuriicksinkenden Freund auf-
zufangen. 
Hier ist eine Summierung der bisher verwandten lokalen und tempo-
ralen Zeichen. Drei nominal entworfene Gegenstiinde bleiben ffir die 
Konstituierung der Raumverhiiltnisse rein funktional: das Sofa in 
Danaes Zimmer, das Vorzimmer, und dazwischen die Tiir. Mittels 
der beiden durch die Tiir getrennten oder auch verbundenen Riiumlich-
keiten bildet sich der raumzeitliche Horizont, in dem sich die Wieder-
sehensepisode abspielt. Die Tiir als der Gegenstand, der Danae und 
Agathon noch trennt, wird abwechselnd durch beider Perspektiven an-
visiert. Danae, auf ihrem Sofa sitzend, schaut auf die Tiir von innen. 
Agathon, im V orzimmer stehend, schaut auf die Tiir von aussen. Die 
Riiumlichkeit kann als 'innen' und 'aussen' zur Ansicht kommen, weil 
Agathon aus einem unbegrenzten Aussenraum erst an das Tor des Land-
hauses, dann in das Landhaus, dann in das Vorzimmer gekommen war, 
Danae hingegen sich in einem als Zimmer entworfenen, also einem ge-

160 
IRMGARD KOWATZKI 
schlossenen Innenraum befindet. Diese Raumverhaltnisse stabilisieren 
sich als Ansicht, nachdem Agathon sich endlich im Vorzimmer zu Danaes 
Zimmer befindet. Von da an werden ausser der bereits zur Schau ge-
stellten Tiir und dem Sofa keine raumlichen Zeichen mehr gegeben. Doch 
auch Tiir und Sofa haben fUr das sich entfaltende 'Geschehen nur noch 
eine Funktion. Die Tiir ist das aussere Zeichen der Trennung. Sie wird 
geoff net, damit die Trennung aufgehoben ist. Danach verfliichtigt sie sich 
als Ansicht, wohingegen das Sofa als Ansicht bestehen bleibt. Denn auf 
dem Sofa wird sich spater eine zartliche Wiedersehensszene entwickeln. 
Es behalt als Ansicht seine Funktion. 
Die chronologische Zeitabfolge der Episode wird nur durch das Sich-
Fortbewegen der Darsteller innerhalb des dargestellten raumlichen Be-
wegungshorizonts vermittelt. Denn die einzige nominale Zeitangabe, 
namlich dass Agathon die Dame 'in einigen Augenblicken' sehen wird, 
bezieht sich nicht auf ein Geschehen, das sich an ein anderes Geschehen 
anschliesst, hat also nichts mit einem empirischen Zeitablauf zu tun. 
Doch der sparsame Gebrauch von diumlichen und temporalen Angaben 
Uisst auf das Kunstwollen des Autors schliessen. Alles, was an Wesent-
lichem geschieht, was als Sachverhalt entworfen oder als Ansicht vor-
gestellt und als Gegenstandlichkeit erfassbar wird, spielt sich als erlebte 
Zeit im Innem der Hauptdarsteller abo Daher konnen im intentionalcn 
Nachvollziehen dieser Szene auch keine zeitlichen Liicken entstehen, 
denn im Ablauf der inneren Zeitlichkeit gibt es keine notwendige chrono-
logische Folge von Ereignissen. Und erlebte Zeit hat ontische Prioritat 
vor chronologischer Zeit, weil sie im innem Sinn der Zeitlichkeit ge-
griindet ist. Was sich dem Leser als Bewusstseinsinhalt der Hauptperso-
nen aufdrangt und sich als Geschehen im Raum intentional aktualisieren 
lasst, sind mehrdimensionale zeitliche Begebenheiten, die aussere und 
chronologische sowie die innere und erlebte Zeit. 1m intentionalen Nach-
vollzug der fiktionalen Episode bleiben Orientierungsebene sowie zeit-
liche Kontinuitat gewahrt, und das Geschehen treibt gradlinig und un-
unterbrochen auf einen Kulminationspunkt zu. 
Doch zuriick zur fiktionalen Handlung. Welchen Effekt hat das Wie-
dersehen auf Danae? Als Agathon im Vorzimmer bei ihrem Anblick 
'von seiner Empfindlichkeit iiberwaltigt' in die Arme des Freundes zu-
riicksinkt, hat sie bereits ihre Ohnmacht iiberstanden. Dem unhelden-
haften Agathon gegeniiber kann Danae also immer noch unbewegt auf 

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 161 
ihrem Sofa sitzen bleiben. Doch ohne dass es der Erzahler ausdriicklich 
vermeint, sieht man fOrmlich, dass Danaes Unfahigkeit, sich beim An-
blick Agathons zu riihren, gefiihlsbedingt ist. Wo Agathon die Sinne 
schwinden, erlebt sie eine momentane physische Uihmung. Der voraus-
gegangene Streit des Herzens mit dem kiihlen Kopf ist hiermit zwar fiir 
einen winzigen Augenblick aufgehoben, nicht jedoch entschieden. Als 
sie Agathons Reaktion auf ihren Anblick endlich bewusst erfasst, ent-
scheidet sich der Kampf endgiiltig und diesmal zugunsten ihres Herzens. 
Sie lasst sich nun ganz einfach iiberwaltigen. "Auf einmal vergass die 
schone Danae alle die grossen Entschliessungen von Gelassenheit und 
Zuruckhaltung, welche sie mit so vieler Miihe gefasst hatte." (478) Nun 
wird auch klar, wie Danae die Anwesenheit von Kritolaos zu nutzen 
gedacht hatte. Die Anwesenheit des ihr Fremden sollte sie zwingen, Ge-
lassenheit und Zuruckhaltung zu spielen. Das Bemiihen urn diese Rolle 
mag gross gewesen sein. Doch beim Anblick des iiberwaltigten Agathon 
ist es ganz selbstverstandlich, dass auch sie sich gehen lasst, und zwar 
ganz plotzlich, 'auf einmal'. "Sie lief in zartlicher Bestiirzung auf ihn zu, 
nahm ihn in ihre Arme, liess dem ganzen Strom ihrer Empfindungen den 
Lauf, ohne daran zu denken, dass sie einen Zeugen hatte, der iiber alles, 
was er sah und horte, erstaunt sein musste." (478) 
Hier kommt die Sphare von Danaes so geruhmter Weiblichkeit zur 
vollen Ansicht, und nun ist sie die einzige noch erfassbare Gegenstand-
lichkeit, auf die der Erzahler schon vorbereitet hatte. Dieser schiebt sich 
hier fast unmerklich wieder in den Vordergrund, denn er ist nun der 
einzige, der iiber Danaes Verhalten berichten kann, da diese nur noch 
hingebendes Empfinden ist. 1m Gegensatz zu Agathon, dessen Reaktion 
sich stockend und nur ruckweise bis zum Uberwaltigtsein gesteigert hatte, 
das ihn dann sogar von Danae weg in die Armedes Freundes zuriick-
sinken liess, zeigt Danae ungehemmtes Hinstromen auf Agathon zu. 
Agathon hatte sie angeschaut, wollte auf sie zugehen, konnte nicht, 
heftete seine Augen noch einmal auf sie, sank zuruck; alles immer wieder 
begonnene und abgebrochene Bewegungen. Sie hingegen lauft ganz ein-
fach auf ihn zu, schliesst ihn in die Arme. Und nun stromen Empfindun-
gen ungehemmt von irgendwelchen nicht zur Sache der Liebe gehoren-
den Erwagungen. Die Empfindungen werden erst einmal vom Erzahler 
entworfen und werden dann anschaulich gemacht. Sie kommen auch 
dadurch als ungehemmte Gegenstandlichkeit zur Ansicht, dass sie mit 

162

einem Strom, der ungehemmt seinen Lauf nimmt, verglichen werden. 
Agathon sank "vom Ubermass seiner Empfindlichkeit iiberwaltigt" 
in die Arme seines Freundes. Danae lasst "dem ganzen Strom ihrer 
Empfindungen den Lauf". Durch die Zuordnung des Wortes "Emp-
findungen" zu Danaes Gefiihlsgestimmtheit und des Wortes 'Empfind-
lichkeit' zu Agathons, wird noch einmal - abgesehen von den entworfe-
nen intentionalen Sachverhalten vorher - die unterschiedliche Verhal-
tensweise der beiden Liebenden verdeutlicht. Agathons Empfindlichkeit 
ist ein Offensein nach aussen hin, und die Anfechtungen, denen er von 
aussen her· begegnet, steigern den Zustand der Empfindlichkeit grad-
weise. Danaes Empfindungen sind in ihrem Innern beschlossen, und erst, 
nachdem die Abgeschiedenheit von der Aussenwelt durchbrochen ist, 
konnen die Empfindungen verstromen, und sie verstromen ungehemmt. 
Der dritte Spieler in dieser Szene hat bis zu diesem Punkte seinen 
Eigenwert verloren, und er wird nur durch seine Funktion in bezug auf 
die Handlung mitvermeint. Nachdem jedoch das Bewusstsein Agathons 
durch Ohnmacht ausgeschaltet ist, Danaes ganzes Sein nur noch in dem 
geliebten Gegeniiber existiert, kann Kritolaos durch den Erzahler wieder 
zur Ansicht gebracht werden, ohne das Geschehen urn die zwei Lieben-
den zu staren. Der Erzahler gibt also in nicht ernst gemeinter Entriistung 
zu bedenken, dass Danae durch ihr Verhalten die Grenzen des gesell-
schaftlich Erlaubten iiberschreite, "ohne daran zu denken, dass sie einen 
Zeugen hatte, der iiber alles, was er sah und horte, erstaunt sein musste." 
"Uber alles, was er sah und horte." Bis zu welchem Mass die schone 
Danae sich ihren Gefiihlen iiberlasst, evozieren noch einmal diese verbal 
entworfenen Sachverhalte. Es entsteht eine schone Danae, die den in 
den Armen seines Freundes liegenden Agathon mit heftigen Liebesbe-
zeugungen und zartlichen Ausserungen wieder zurn Leben zu erwecken 
sucht. In dieser Szene liefert der Erzahler nur ein temporales Zeichen, 
'auf einmal', und das auch nur urn vorzustellen, wie spontan sich Danae 
ihren Gefiihlen hingibt. Eine Raurnlichkeit wird nur dadurch ansichtig, 
dass Danae auf Agathon zulauft, also eine Strecke im Raurn zurUcklegt. 
Doch es bedarf im Bereich 'schoner Seelen', in dem der asthetisch ein-
gestellte Leser sich befindet, wenn er bisher im Sinne des Erzahlers mit-
gespielt hat, keiner zeitlichen oder raumlichen Orientierung. Denn hier 
haben die Begriffe Zeit und Raurn keine Berechtigung. 
Durch diese Analyse, scheint mir, ist die Interpretation des Befundes: 

DIE FUNKTION DES KONSTITUIERENDEN BEWUSSTSEINS 163 
was leisten Erzahlerhaltung, perspektivischer Wechsel, linguistische 
Zeichen, vorgestellte Bedeutungen, Sachverhalte und Gegenstandlich-
keiten, was die Raum- und Zeitstruktur - bereits vorweggenommen. Die 
wenigen raumzeitlichen Daten sind in diesem "Studium fUr die See1en-
maIer" (476) fUr die Konkretisierung des in dieser Szene vorgefUhrten 
emotionalen Geschehens vollig angemessen. Denn die innere oder ideale 
Zeitlichkeit, wie sie als erlebte Zeit durch Empfindungen, Vorstellungen, 
Bilderreihen, Erinnertes, etc., an- und ausgefUllt wird, bedarf nur der 
Durchhaltung einer Orientierungsehene wegen ab und zu raumzeitlicher 
Daten. Das kiinstlerische Anliegen Wie1ands wird hier einsichtig: Die 
Kette von Ursache und Wirkung des Geschehens muss an jedem Punkt 
kontinuierlich bleiben, so dass alles, was geschieht, Resultat und Wirkung 
eines inneren Zustandes ist. Fur den Leser wird anschauendes Erkennen 
durch diese Verkniipfung von Ursache und Wirkung in der Darstellung 
des Geschehens moglich. 
Von hesonderer asthetischer Wirkung ist der diumliche Aufbau der 
Szene. Agathon kommt aus einem unbestimmten offenen Aussenraum 
in einen Innenraum, der sich immer mehr nach innen zu konzentriert, 
his er zum Schluss auf das Zimmer der Danae gewissermassen vollig 
'verinnerlicht' ist. Diese Bewegung nach innen ist der Situation des 
Agathon an dies em Punkt seines Erlebens analog. Ausserdem scheint 
Wielands Forderung, Vorstellung und Empfindungen sollten lehrreich 
sein, indem sie vergniigen, das Zusammentreffen also des Didaktischen 
mit dem Vergniiglichen, durch diese Szene besonders lebhaft vorgefUhrt 
zu sein.

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART AND 
A SUBJECT OF 'SPECIFIC AESTHETICS' 
A Contribution to Ingarden's System of Aesthetics 
1. INGARDEN'S GENERAL THEORY AND ITS EXTENSION 
BY 'SPECIFIC AESTHETICS' 
The investigations on museum exhibition, if carried out in a traditional 
way, should be considered as another kind of descriptive science, dealing 
with purely factual material and having rather practical purposes. In 
fact, most of the works we usually find in museological literature have 
the character of more or less detailed reports on particular museum-
exhibition solutions and deal mainly with technological problems. In the 
Cracow scientific centre, however, the same subject matter has acquired 
a different, purely theoretical shape, being developed in close relation 
to aesthetics, precisely to the theory of structure and theory of cognizance 
of the work of art (including painting, sculpture, architecture and liter-
ature), the sources of which have been found in the fundamental works 
by Roman Ingarden.l Hence, a new branch or trend in theoretical 
museology that has been proposed, became - to some extent - a con-
tinuation of Ingarden's thought.2 Having applied the essentials of In-
garden's aesthetics as a kind of 'model investigation', new theoretical 
museology became, in tum a contribution to Ingarden's works, mainly 
by extending the original range of investigation into the field that has 
been left untouched by Ingarden himself. 3 
The connection between museological investigations and Ingarden's 
system of aesthetics are mainly the result of inspirations that have been 
found within that system, strictly speaking in the methodological ap-
proach and cognitive attitude Ingarden has proposed for the analyses 
of the work of art, as well as by the results obtained by him. In fact, it 
is Ingarden's system of aesthetics (mostly his ontology of the work of 
art and the theory of its cognizance) that was the main source of indica-
tions, according to which a new interpretation of the subject matter in 
museum expositiology (as we may call that discipline) has been developed. 
According to that approach, museum exhibition could be interpreted

as a specific type of cultural product (a sui generis type of work) showing 
close analogies to the work of art as well as to those of scientific liter-
ature, in other words as a work within which the elements of architec-
ture, architectonic arrangement of space and colour, of illustrative paint-
ing or graphic art, of sound, and those of scientific literary works become 
fused into an organically united whole. 
Besides, due to the connections with Ingarden's investigations on the 
formal structure of works of art, it was possible to distinguish within the 
structure of the exhibitions works, specific components of its form, the 
so-called (following Ingarden's terminology) 'moments' and 'strata' 
(Momente, Schichten), etc., as well as the sets of qualities, thanks to the 
presence of which 4 particular variants of exhibition are constituted. 
Consequently, the investigations on museum exhibition became auto-
matically incorporated into the sphere of philosophy, as a new chapter 
of specific aesthetics 5. 
Simultaneously, the traditional range, as well as the traditional ap-
proach towards the problems of museum exhibition have been largely 
expanded. Museological dissertations which originally had (and still 
have) the character of historical, sociological, or even purely techno-
logical works, and which have been limited to factographic reports or 
critical reviews, have retained evidently their previous position and most 
of their validity, however they received an essential supplement and theo-
retical support in the analyses of exhibition form, of its spatial and 
colouristic arrangement, semantic structure and functional effectiveness. 
Having interpreted museum exhibition as the work of special category, 
it was necessary to point out all its characteristics by which it distinctly 
differs from particular kinds ('species') of art (e.g. from non-scientific 
'applied' art, trade exhibition, etc.) and from scientific works (e.g. sci-
entific textbooks supplied by graphic illustration). In this respect, it has 
been found that the most characteristic, if not specifically essential fea-
ture of all museum exhibitions appears to be the type of complexity 6 the 
main character of which may be observed in all cases but which gives 
an immeasurable multitude of detailed variants to be recorded in part-
icular types of solutions. 
Due to this typically heterogeneous structure, particular categories of 
'pure' and 'applied' art may be considered - in regard to museum ex-
hibition works - as their potential 'elementary' components. Indeed, 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
167 
every museum exhibition originates from their fusion. The way in which 
such fusion comes into being (especially, all possible variants of such 
fusion), determines the constitution of particular 'species' of museum 
exhibition, their stylistic features, aesthetically valid qualities, artistic 
character and functional determinations. 
It should be noted that all variants, which maybe reckoned here, are 
independent from the thematical subject to which their content is de-
voted, since their differences are 'rooted' in the formal structure only 
and in those of its detailed function. 
Scientific-informatory function of museum exhibitions, their role as a 
mediwn of information (first of all of scientific information), the kind of 
information transmitted, is the second essential moment, by which these 
exhibitions may be distinguished from any type of 'pure' and of non-
scientific 'applied' art, i.e. that which engages only the means of aesthetic, 
e.g. space-and-colour composition, stylistic features etc. for non-scien-
tific or even non-artistic purposes (in reference to the last case, e.g. for 
trade advertisement, for everyday-life information, for political and 
social purposes, etc.), being essentially apart from autonomically under-
stood aims and contents. 
However, being fully 'applied' (or, 'programmed') as a work closely 
related to art, due to its function, museum exhibition must fulfil some 
additional conditions which never occur in art. Strictly speaking, mu-
seum exhibition represents this single case among the works in which 
architectonics are included (its analogy being only to scientific illustra-
tion, lacking of aesthetic character) in which the so-called scientific 
universe 7 is visually represented: the 'universe' which can never be iden-
tified with the sphere of material things, factual events or processes, but 
should be understood always as (a) an interpretation of the real world 
or (b) as a purely abstract construction totally created by science irre-
spectively, whether in an aprioric way (e.g. in mathematics) or on the 
basis of empirical experience - and this way is novel to the world. 
This unique situation becomes in its effect the decisive moment, ac-
cording to which the character ('essence') of the 'world' which isfactually 
represented 8 in museum exhibitions becomes established. An exhibition, 
in particular its illustrative elements, can therefore never be interpreted 
as an 'absolutely true' imitation, a mechanical 'reprint' or 'reproduc-
tion', 'restoration', etc. or the real world (e.g. in a natural history mu-

, 
168 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
seum, of a determined section of natural landscape); however such re-
productions are often intended to be done and - in museological criticism 
- are often considered as 'true' and scientifically correct. In fact, all 
representations we find in museum exhibitions, even among the most 
'naturalistic' ones (e.g. the natural-history dioramas) show nothing more, 
but some degree of similarity ('likeness') to the reality, being at the same 
time deliberately influenced by the scientific approach, in which the re-
ality they 'depict' becomes specifically deformed. 9 In particular it is 
never necessarily demanded to reproduce in exhibition representations 
(e.g. in exhibition illustrative painting, graphic and dioramas) the ap-
pearances of real objects (following Ingarden's terminology: die Ansich-
ten - understood as momentary 'views' of things). In some cases of 
special kinds of exhibition subject matter it is not demanded even to 
reproduce anything real at all: in these cases an exhibition becomes a 
clarification of purely conceptual constructions, intellectual objects ap-
plied in sciences as different proposals, 'models' the structure of which 
has little or even no correspondence to empirical-sensual evidence. 
Hence, in the case (a), when - according to the type of the object - an 
exhibition signifies ('points at') some objects belonging to the sphere of 
the real world (in particular, material things and individual processes or 
events which happened, or are happening in real time), the picture of this 
world which appears factually in exhibitions, bears inevitably the traces 
of deformation characteristic to the given scientific discipline, its meth-
odology etc., however is neither absolutely 'free' in deforming things -
so that it is fully acceptable and often becomes a rule in the sphere of 
art - nor is identifiable with falsehood. This type of deformation, essen-
tially connected with museum scientific representations, appears as an 
integral part of visual interpretations in scientifically-perceptive attitude 
towards the real world and its elements; in other words, it becomes the 
'way of seeing things' characteristic especially for all sciences concerned 
with the registration, classification, description and typization of facts. 
It becomes a factor, the function of which is to illustrate not as the real 
world 'looks like', but rather, what and how particular sciences 'say' 
about its elements, or what are the products of scientific experience of 
the given reality. In case (b), when the exhibition's subject has the char-
acter of 'creative constructions' (ontologically: of ideal objects or their 
mutual relations), e.g. mathematical objects, hypotheses built on the 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
169 
basis of empirical evidence, different kinds of scientific models never oc-
curring in their exact shape in the real world (e.g. models constructed 
by recent biology and physics), the objects which are represented factu-
ally in exhibition works (those which are factually painted, drawn or 
carved in a given material), are merely plastic 'visualizations' of the 
content (usually, being formulated verbally in origin as descriptive def-
initions of ideal objects), 'deduced' in their external shape from the given 
conceptual constructions, without any 'study of nature'. Sometimes, 
however, the data originating from the observation of real things may 
be applied in such representations accessorily, as a practically useful 
material for depicting abstract, purely intellectual constructions. In these 
cases, factual pictures of these constructions 'borrow' the elements from 
the real world (mostly those of shape or momentary views of things); 
however, this 'borrowing' is nothing but a technical means used in mu-
seum illustration. Consequently, factual contents of such representa-
tions must be 're-formulated' (or transformulated) in the process of 
perception; it must be understood in the terms of the contents signified. 
Most of the accessorily added qualities of factual representations must 
be in these cases postponed by the perceiver, others must undergo spe-
cific generalization, etc. According to the type of representation and to 
the application of elements 'borrowed' from real objects, the process of 
'transformulation' of the factually represented objects may be diverse. 
2. A DIFFERENTIATION OF THE OBJECTIVE TYPES 
OF 'REALISM' 
It is clear therefore, that the realism by which museum exhibitions (in 
particular its illustrative elements, paintings or dioramas for instance) 
are characterized, is - from the formal-semantic point of view - essen-
tially different from all other types of 'realism', especially from that which 
is encountered in the works of 'pure' art, in particular in those provided 
with a distinct 'literary subject' .10 Its concept must be interpreted rather 
widely. Analogically, very broad limits should be applied towards the 
concept of truthfulness (descriptive correctness) of this realism. Strictly 
speaking, the realism and truth of museum-exhibition representations 
are not demanded to mean any absolute accordance between all proper-
ties of factually represented objects and the properties of the objects 

, 
170 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
signified by the representations. Scientific realism and scientific correct-
ness does not mean necessarily full accordance between the proper-
ties of factual representations and the objects which have been once used 
as their real 'models'.ll In all these cases there is only some minimum 
of accordance needed, but this minimal accordance (in various cases 
different!) must be fulfilled strictly; if the representations applied in 
museum exhibitions as scientific illustrations lack in fulfilling it, their 
scientific value is automatically out of question. One may ask what this 
minimum is or should be. Speaking generally, it consists in the accor-
dance of the content of the definitions, descriptions, etc. of the given sci-
entific objects or of real things being the objects of scientific research, 
which have to be clarified by means of museum-exhibition means (mostly 
by those of museum pictorial representation) and that portion of prop-
erties of the factually represented objects, which is functioning in this 
clarification. Besides that, all other criteria of truth, which are normally 
applied to non-scientific works (e.g. 'likeness' to something real, subjec-
tive 'truth' of the 'creative 1', truth understood as sincerity, etc.) may be, 
of course, valid too; however this validity seems to be neither absolute 
nor inevitably necessary and is usually considered as an accessory mo-
ment. The circumstance that museum exhibition often represents objects 
being merely derivatives of abstract scientific thinking is the main cause 
that exclusive application of purely aesthetic or artistic criteria of truth 
and correctness become in their cases unsatisfactory or even absurd. 
This is the cause too, that most of the conventions applied for instance 
in scientific drawing (that we usually find in scientific papers as a sup-
plement to the text), and which in scientific practice are qualified as 'the 
only true way of depicting things' - in morphological sense first of all-are 
essentially different from most of the conventions applied in art. Hence, 
mechanical 'borrowing' of forms and styles from act into museum il-
lustration often leads to misunderstanding and dis information. On the 
other hand, one cannot say that museum illustration represents some 
autonomous, fully isolated region. It is from many sides influenced or 
inspired by artistic means of representation; however in all cases when 
museum representations are from the scientific point of view qualified 
as correct, those influences are strongly disciplined and introduced ex-
tremely carefully. 12 
The possibility of correct understanding of the content that is 'coded 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
171 
into' factually represented objects, scenes, quasi-events, etc., irrespective 
of whether they are 'realistic' or 'non-realistic' in the popular sense, in 
other words the possibility of reconstructing from them their own 
thematica1 programme (that one, which is usually formulated in the ex-
hibition's guide-book) is the only moment on which the evaluation of 
the exhibition's informative capacity should be founded. However, then 
in art provided with some 'literary contents' (e.g. in genre-painting, etc.) 
the objects factually depicted in the works may be taken autonomically, 
i.e. without any verification from real life: present or past (even in the 
so-called 'historical' paintings: every artist choosing a 'historical' subject 
for his work, e.g. 'Napoleon at Waterloo' can create his own characters 
of the depicted event: his own 'Napoleon' and his own 'Waterloo' and 
no authenticity of the factually depicted event is demanded) - here, in 
scientific exhibition such verification becomes of the first importance, 
however, as we have just said, not necessarily in terms of radical re-
alistic or naturalistic conventions. If it happens, then, that some genuine 
works of art become sometimes applied in a museum exhibition as ele-
ments of scientific illustration (i.e. not as works of art that are presented 
in an art-gallery for artistic reasons only), their scientific background 
must be tested first of all. Many recent historical exhibitions (e.g. that 
in the Waterloo Hall in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam or that in the 
War Museum in Warsaw) may be quoted as good examples of such ap-
plication. Analogically, creating the works of scientific illustration for 
definite exhibitions (i.e. according to the given guide-book) and making 
them at the same time genuine works of art is on the same principle 
possible. E.g. Murals designed recently for the Smithsonian Institution 
(Washington D.C.) by Jay Matternes, being from a scientific point of 
view palaeontological restorations, may serve as nearly classical exam-
ples of such achievements. Independently from their scientific and di-
dactic values, they represent the class of real masterpieces of composition, 
colour and painting technique. 
One may say in conclusion that in the analyses of museum exhibitions, 
scientific illustration, three 'sides' or 'spheres of objects' should be dis-
tinguished: some of them being the integral part of these works, the 
others on the contrary being external to them. (1) The objects being the 
source or 'model' of the factually depicted world, in other words all what 
is 'borrowed' by the artist from the world external to the illustrative 

, 
172 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
work and applied (always under more or less modified shape) in con-
structing factually depicted things. To draw or paint one single object, 
the artist may use a single 'model' only, as well as a whole set of them 
(in the last case there is always an essential question about their selection 
or about the selection of their properties 'borrowed' from them during 
the reproductive-creative process). Being external to the work of sci-
entific illustration and the things depicted in it, the 'models' may belong 
either to the real world (in this case the artist drawn, paints or models 
'from nature') or to an imaginary-conceptual one, for instance that of ab-
stract-geometrical forms. It is nearly a rule that in depicting objects being 
representations ('visualizations') of scientific definitions (ontologically: 
general objects), the factually depicted things are of heterogeneous (real-
conceptual) origin. (2) Factual representations taken in their own prop-
erties only, in other words all what wefactually perceive in the exhibition-
illustrative work without completing it by anything from 'outside' (in 
particular by the data of our own sensual experience). If for example, 
a factually depicted 'horse' is provided with some deformations never 
existing in nature, it should be taken with all these deformations, irre-
spective of their meaning, source, etc., in other words just so, as it is 
concretely drawn, painted or modelled in some given material. This way, 
a drawn 'horse' will be provided always with a black 'outline', will be 
always 'flat' (will have only one 'side'), a modelled 'horse' will have a 
texture characteristic to the material in which it has been carved (plaster, 
bronze, genuine horse skin), etc. 13 (3) The objects signified by factual 
representations, usually belonging to the sphere of 'scientific universe' 
and only in some special cases to the real world, given in direct, sensual 
experience. In scientific museum illustration these objects should not be 
identified with the so-called 'concretions' (in Ingarden's terminology) at 
least, in the absolute sense. In practice they are constituted rather on the 
grounds of such concretions and often vary from them essentially in the 
contents. 
Distinguishing these three 'spheres of objects' makes, of course, the 
analysis of works or museum illustration extremely complicated. In 
order to 'decipher' the type of structure in particular cases one must 
take all possible mutual relations between these three sides and to find 
out which of them 'fits' to the given example. Taking into consideration 
that particular works may additionally vary in their contents, may be 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
173 
provided with specific kinds of 'deformations' introduced consciously as 
the factor indicating about the way in which the objects signified by 
factual representations should be interpreted (in some cases those sig-
nified objects are identical with the 'models' applied by the artist for 
making factual representations), the total number of possible variants, 
sub-variants and 'species' in museum illustration is really immense. 
3. THE INFORMATIVE AND AESTHETIC FUNCTION OF THE 
FORMAL STRUCTURE OF MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS 
The results obtained allow preliminary statements to be formulated 
concerning the formal structure of museum exhibition works as well as 
those of their informative and aesthetic function. 
One may say namely that the type of structure of every exhibition 
work as well as the type of its informative capacity is determined by a 
combination of the following factors: (I) by the category of the objects 
which are factually represented or factually presented in the exhibition 
work. The difference between presentation and representation is deter-
mined by the way in which the objects which are put on display are given 
to our perception. Original specimens (i.e. minerals, fossils, historical 
costumes, etc.) are presented, because the physical thing we find in dis-
play is identical with the object that should mean or illustrate something 
else. The same minerals, fossils, etc. are represented when the material 
things we find in display (which are factually presented there) are not 
identical with the objects which have an illustrative function; in the case 
of representation it will be only a material foundation of the factually 
depicted object, which is presented in display: a piece of board covered 
with paint or a piece of plaster carved in a special way. We must abstract 
many of the properties of the factually presented thing if we want to 
reach (to 'see') the factual representation. This non-identity between 
the factually presented objects and factual representations - obvious in 
any case of drawing or painting - occurs to the same extent in all kinds 
of three-dimensional representations (sculptures, models, 'preparates' of 
things), i.e. where the material fundament of the representation and the 
represented object must be distinguished with precision. (2) By the 
category of the objects which are signified ('pointed at') by the presenta-
tions or representations. It is possible, for instance, that an original 

174 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
specimen, say, a piece of coal, limestone or anything else, factually pre-
sented in display represents something, what is not identical with itself 
(it may be, even an object not belonging to the category of things, e.g. a 
process - of petrification, for instance).14 It may, of course, in some 
special cases represent itself too; it could be said that in such cases the 
factually presented objects 'point at' themselves: factual presentation of 
something becomes at the same time a signification. There are many 
possibilities of this kind, all of them characterizing different types of 
museum display. (3) By the category of objects being creative basis, or 
source (especially: 'model', in the popular meaning) of the factual pres-
entations or representations. For instance a restoration of a dinosaur 
or of an Etruscan temple, if made under the form of a 'realistic' painting 
may have its source not only in the properties of authentic fossils, but 
- of course as additional ones - in some properties of different recent 
things too 'adjusted' to the restoration as non-contradictory, scientif-
ically allowable (hypothetical or even less than those) features. Conse-
quently the restoration becomes in its structure highly heterogeneous, it 
combines the elements originating from many different sources or 
'models'. 
Each of these principal factors (1, 2, 3) may present the following 
number of possible situations, precisely: 
A. When an exhibition (especially its illustrative elements: paintings, 
graphics, drawings, models or dioramas) may signify: 
I. Objects of the category of things: 15 
(1) Real objects (e.g., individual specimens of minerals, fossils, his-
torical costumes, etc.). 
(2) General objects originated from generalization of real things (e.g. 
species in descriptive-classifying sciences, in biology lor instance). 
(3) General objects originated as pure scientific constructions (e.g. 
mathematics) built without any support of empirical evidence. 
II. Objects of the category of events: 
(1) Individual events which happened in real time (e.g. somebody's 
death, a battle etc.). 
(2) Types of events, considered independently from time in which

they usually occur (e.g. freezing ofliquids taken as a general phenomenon 
of transition from the liquid into the solid state, which can be concretized 
at any time and in different kinds of physical substances). 
III. Objects of the category of processes.' 
(I) Individual processes, which appeared (or are still happening) in 
real time (e.g. the evolution of man, pollution of the atmosphere, ex-
tinction of particular species of animals, etc.). 
(2) General types of processes, taken independently from the moments 
in which they really took place or might have taken place, even more, 
independently from any real time at all; considered only in their expan-
sion in time, rhythm (type of rhythm), speed (type of speed, general 
degree of speed) etc., in other words by all those features due to which 
they are characterized as processes of particular classes (e.g. fission of 
cell, work of heart, etc.). 
IV. States of being of different types of things.' 
(I) The states of being of material things (e.g., the state of fossiliza-
tion of definite specimens - or of any kind of fossils - the degree of their 
destruction, deformation, etc.). 
(2) The states of being taken as such, irrespectively from the material 
subject or individual things in which they may be noticed (e.g. the state 
of fossilization, taken independently from the objects which are fossil-
ized; defined as such and comparable with other states in which material 
things may be found, i.e. in the state of decay, state of refrigeration, state 
of freshness after death or in the state of life). 
V. Individual properties of things, events and processes and sets of such 
properties, however not interpreted as 'generalized objects'. In most 
cases: groups of properties, selected as definienda if particular systematic 
classes of things, by which particular real things (specimens) are recog-
nized as representatives of those classes. 
B. The above mentioned objects may be signified by factual representa-
tions or presentations of: 
(I) Real things (individual objects presented originally in display or rep-

, 
176 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
resented by any kind of illustrative means, even by presentation of some-
thing else, applied in the function of an illustrative object). 
(a) In the case of presentation: Real things may be used as significa-
tions of themselves only. Presentation has therefore rather a limited 
range of application. As significants may be used here exclusively original 
specimens, since the application of any kind of 'accessory' exhibits (the 
facsimile ones, for instance) means automatically representation. The 
'facsimile' could be used in these cases only, when the exhibitions were 
devoted to museum-exhibition technology, for in that case the 'facsimile' 
objects become original exhibits. In other words, in the case of presenta-
tion the objects put on display can never imitate anything else. 
(b) In the case of representation, the signification may be executed by 
means of (1) original specimens, used as illustration of something else, 
especially of the objects belonging to a different category, e.g. that of 
processes, events, etc. or the objects of the same category, but taken in 
a past phase of being, no more actual when the object put on display is 
given (e.g. when a preparate of a plant represents the same specimen of 
that plant, but alive; in this case all properties of the factually presented 
object, determining its actual state of death and deterioration must be 
therefore dropped or re-formulated during the process of perception: 
'understood in another way'). (2) By more or less 'realistic' models, 
sculptures, etc. in other words three-dimensional representations, used 
as illustration of objects different from themselves. (3) By objects de-
picted (in drawings, paintings, photography, etc.), in other words rep-
resented illusorically and not present in display in origine, even not as 
material 'facsimile' things. In that case, the object presented in display 
is of the category of work of illusionistic art, the shape of which is not 
identical with the shape of the objects represented through it (i.e. it is 
a case contrary with that of the representation through sculpture, when 
the shape of the material fundament of the work art is identical with 
that of the object represented in it factually). 
(2) Factually realized processes: (a) 'actualized', real processes differing 
from genuine ones by their origin only, however identical with 
authentic ones (those 'from nature') in respect to their properties, 
(b) more or less realistic 'model' processes, applied as illustration of 
authentic ones, however differing from the genuine ones not only in their 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
177 
ongm but also in many properties too (usually in their scale, speed, 
rhythm, frequency and in the sort of material basis on which genuine 
processes are performed in nature). 
c. Factual representations, precisely, the objects represented factually 
in the exhibition works, may have their source or foundation: 
(1) In direct observation of real things, events or processes. Particular 
cases which may be enlisted into this group are additionally differenti-
ated: 
(a) according to the type of objects selected for observation or to the 
group of their properties which are taken into account when the rep-
resentation is constructed. 
(b) according to the type and degree of 'likeness' between the factually 
represented objects and those that have once been used as their real 
'models' from nature. 
(2) In the analysis of scientific descriptions, notions, etc., formulated 
verbally. The representations is in this case a strict 'translation' of ver-
bally formulated contents into visual form. The degree of generalization 
in such descriptions is consequently the main factor, by which the final 
form of the representations is constituted, for each property of described 
objects must find its correspondent symbol (shape, colour) in their visual 
image. In consequence, the representations of this kind are built up as 
conglomerates of different 'iconic symbols'. It is a rare case, of course, 
when scientific representations are resulted by such translations only; 
in practice, the translations of verbal descriptions become more or less 
components in representations based generally on different kinds of 
sources, thus becoming heterogeneous in their structure. 
(3) In real objects, factually put on display. This case should be regarded 
in a special way, since such real objects functioning as illustrative ele-
ments rarely act alone. In most cases they become components in ex-
hibition works of complex structure, those namely, where real elements 
cooperate with depicted ones (in dioramas, for instance, and all kinds 
or recently designed types of exhibitions being derivatives of traditional 
musewn dioramas: those for instance from the new fossil hall in the 
Musewn of Natural History in London).

It is evident that mutual combinations of all the cases presented within 
the groups A, Band C, with all their second-degree variants and sub-
groups give as a result an enormous number of possible solutions. It 
should be noticed, however, that not all of the whole amount of theo-
retically determinable cases may be considered as logically correct. Math-
ematical reckoning gives a higher number of combinations than that 
which is definitively acceptable as right; some of the cases (especially 
when the factor of source is taken into consideration) evidently show 
contradictory structure. On the other hand, the full evidence of all these 
incorrect solutions is of great importance, as well as the consciousness 
of the mechanism as a result of which they emerge, for the practice in 
exhibition design does not give absolutely sure measures of how to avoid 
mistakes in this regard, being based mostly on intuition and technolog-
ical factors. 
The reckoning of all possible variants within the pattern of presenta-
tions and representations gives an impulse for designing the outlines of 
two independent systems of classification, embracing all types of exhibi-
tion works. Each of these systems is spread on its own level of aspects 
and applies its own set of determining factors, leading in the consequence 
to formation of two parallel 'rows' of systematic units. Both systems 
originate, however, from the analyses of the same objects. 
I. The first system is founded on the factors determining the type of 
formal structure of the exhibition works, as well as that of their function 
(or functions, if they are more than one). 
The category of presentations or representations, recorded in par-
ticular cases of exhibitions, especially the relations between the factually 
represented objects and their significations are the leading motives in 
this point. Besides, the first system is intended to include the determi-
nants applied in traditional typology of the works of art, according to 
which different types and 'species' of art are distinguished. However, 
since in the field of museum works the so-called 'typical' species of art 
(e.g. graphic art, painting, sculpture, etc.) constitute only a part of all 
solutions, the rest of them being of highly complex character and het-
erogeneous origin (the dioramas of particular kinds, etc.), the final list 
of 'types' according to which particular examples of museum exhibitions 
might be classified is evidently much larger than that normally applied 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
179 
in the theory and history of art. It would not be possible to quote here 
the whole list of the systematic units that have been obtained. As a frag-
mentary illustration, how rich and how complex it is, would illustrate 
perhaps sufficiently, if we mention that according to the factor of mutual 
correspondence between different elements of source ('models' in the 
popular sense) and the properties of factually represented or presented 
objects, four general types of restorations have been established, all of 
them applied mostly in science and historical museums, as the represen-
tation of the past. According to typological categories within the group 
of 'dioramic' exhibitions, six general 'species' of dioramas and semi-
dioramas have been recorded (each of them dividing into a great number 
of sub-types and further, into variants, determined mostly after stylistic 
and semantic features), all of them applied in museums of natural his-
tory, ethnography, archaeology and in historical museums. 
4. INTERPRET A TION OF THE AFORE-SKETCHED INQUIR Y 
WITH REFERENCE TO AESTHETICS 
The aim of this system was to give answers to the following questions: 
(1) how the works or museum exhibitions are built in particular solutions 
and what is the scale of their differentiations. As it has been already said 
it is a classical question of 'Ingardenian type': according to it the works 
or museum exhibitions become clarified in the categories of phenome-
nological theory of the works of art structure. Consequently, the works 
of museum exhibition become incorporated into traditional field of 
aesthetic investigations. (2) What are - in the same regard - the relations 
between the works of museum exhibition and the works of 'pure' and 
'applied' art; in particular, what is the scale of these relations. This 
question, however inspired by Ingarden's system too, lies in regard to 
its subject rather than outside it. In his research, Ingarden concentrated 
first of all on the works of art, i.e. those ones the reasons and 'programme' 
of which are purely artistic (including even the so-called 'marginal' types 
of art, mostly extravagant in character). Consequently the comparisons 
between art and non-art occupied only a little of his attention and if they 
really did, they were applied mainly as a means for clarification of the 
essence of art. In our analyses, on the contrary, the crucial moment is 
reverse: we are starting with the analyses of typically non-artistic works 

, 
180 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
(those showing only some likeness or genetical affinity to art, but lacking 
in dominating artistic programme) and try to clarify their structure by 
comparison with art, especially with those works of art which are sup-
posed to be (or which really are) their inspirations or direct 'models'. 
(3) What are the relations of the exhibitions' content: to the real world 
and - on the other hand - to the so-called 'scientific universe'; hence, 
what is the full scale of relations of museum exhibitions to the products 
of pre-scientific, sub-rational thought and purely sensual attitude, as 
well as that of typically scientific derivatives. This problem, however, in 
its formulation being 'modelled' after the standards of Ingarden's rea-
soning, is rather a novelty to his system of aesthetics, mostly because the 
problem of the origin (in particular, sources in 'nature' understood as a 
'model' and evidence) of the works of art is not taken into consider-
ation. As it has been already said, in the case of any works devoted to 
scientific information - on the contrary to art - it becomes one of the 
most important ones. It is clear therefore that in the investigations on 
museum exhibition it must have been analysed necessarily. 
Besides the purely cognitive aims, the first system was intended to have 
practical purposes too. It was supposed to offer possibilities of being 
applied as a sort of a 'key', by means of which any given example of 
exhibition design could be classified in respect to its formal correctness. 
Especially the possibility of detecting mistakes, e.g. inconsequences 
in the exhibition's logical structure was in this respect of great import-
ance. 
II. The second system of classification was also intended to embrace the 
whole field of museum exhibitions; however, in opposition to the first, it 
was subordinated to the problem of aesthetical factor and its role in 
establishing the exhibition's external shape. 16 
Two questions were of great interest at this point: (1) the mode and 
degree of 'aesthetization' of the exhibition's form, presupposed in the 
programme of design (2) factual impression and effectiveness of the ex-
hibition on the perceiver. 
The starting point for that system consisted in the statement that any 
museum exhibition must be subordinated to the rules of spatial and 
colouristic composition or, at least, may be analysed in terms of these 
rules. No exhibition can be, in other words, aesthetically indifferent, ir-

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
181 
respectively from the program that constitutes its foundation (in par-
ticular that determining its thematical background). 1 7 It is practically 
impossible to design any exhibition which would be completely 'purified' 
from aesthetically valid (positive or negative) qualities and from stylistic 
features. Even these exhibitions which resulted from radically un-aes-
thetic or anti-aesthetic programmes are in some specific way aesthetically 
valid and aesthetically effective, however most negatively. 
Furthermore, it should be stressed that the presence of these aestheti-
cally valid determinants is independent of the category of the subject 
matter understood in the sense of the exhibit material which is put on 
display. Aesthetic 'activeness' of museum exhibitions is not, in other 
words, a feature by which only displays devoted to art or beauty and 
those displaying masterpieces are characterized; conversely, it appears 
as an intrinsic inevitable qualifying moment (however in different mod-
ulations and with different intensity) in all kinds of exhibitions, even in 
those the subject of which has nothing to do with art and in displays 
in which 'ordinary' or even 'ugly' things are presented. Hence, the pop-
ular standpoint, according to which one tries to ignore sometimes the 
fact of inevitable aesthetic determinations of museum exhibitions, in 
particular, by which one neglects its role in exhibitions; e.g. those devoted 
to natural sciences and technology (both disciplines being especially far 
from the problems of art !), should be rejected as evidently wrong. 
Within the second system of classification, five general situations have 
been distinguished: (l) when the function of the aesthetic factor results 
from cultural, social or traditionally-historical inspirations, leading in 
consequence to decorativism and 'historism' in the solutions; (2) when 
the aesthetic factor is neglected or deliberately rejected; (3) when com-
position of form and colour, spatial arrangement of exhibition elements 
achieves autonomic function and are not connected with the scientific-
informative side of displays; (4) when composition of form and colour 
are strictly involved in the informative function, becoming a 'tool' of 
scientific information; and (5) when aesthetic moment is two-functional, 
i.e. is applied as a means of scientific information and simultaneously 
becomes a factor on the grounds of which purely artistic, emotionally-
valid or even 'metaphysical' contents are constituted. Museum exhibi-
tion, however primarily devoted to science, achieves thus a character 
which enables us to compare it with works of art sensu stricto. IS 

182 
JERZY SWIECIMSKI 
Due to the presence of aesthetic qualities, museum exhibitions achieve 
an aspect of novelty for inquiry and give rise to an unforeseen approach. 
Their scientific contents and traditional, informative function retains 
namely their character of leading factors, however they coincidently lose 
their position of something that is of single importance. The analyses of 
scientific exhibitions, especially when made in the aspect of aesthetic 
qualities, lead straight to the statement that every exhibition, besides its 
main scientific content which is, so to say, 'officially programmed' for 
it, presents always some amount of marginal contents, being always of 
various kinds and differing in their distinctness (that is the reason why 
they are so often neglected!) are factually of special meaning. Their 
effectiveness appears namely at the moment when the perceiver gets in 
the first, direct contact with an exhibition and when the latter is rather 
seen by him than understood, in other words, when the exhibition is en-
countered solely as a spatial-and-colouristic 'phenomenon' given in pre-
intellectual, sensually-emotive (and creative !) perception. The results of 
this phase of perception usually determine the course of further under-
standing of the scientific content, delivered by the exhibition's narrative 
and illustrative media, causing the final effect of perception to become 
positive or negative. Exhibitions, which 'at the first glance' are aestheti-
cally dull, unattractive, usually become unattractive scientifically too; of 
course, if we exclude the category of professional visitors who come to 
the museum with 'ready made' concepts of their own and are interested 
rather in selected specimens they want to see than in an exhibition as a 
whole. In the analyses of aesthetic side and aesthetic function of museum 
exhibition one should possibly exclude the perceptive attitudes of sci-
entists or any other kind of professionals who are rather untypical vis-
itors. One may even say these visitors do not need the exhibition at all: 
in fact, most of recent exhibitions are 'addressed' rather to the 'laymen' 
of different kinds. 19 
The non-scientific contents, being sometimes of purely aesthetic type 
(i.e. constituted on different qualities of 'beauty' or 'ugliness' of the ob-
jects put on display or of the exhibition taken as a whole) or of a deeper 
and reflective character (i.e. built on the ground of emotive characters 
of display) are the main cause of the fact that even typically 'scientific' 
exhibitions, e.g. those in biology, become 'active' on a broader range 
than that offactographic, strictly intellectual information, thus achieving 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
183 
a position very close to 'pure' art. Consequently, traditional partition 
which has been built apodictically between the museums of science and 
those devoted to humanities,20 has largely disappeared. Moreover, the 
term 'science museum' achieves in this way a new interpretation of its 
traditional meaning.21 
The two above-mentioned systems of classification have been designed 
as basic ones. Considered as a part of the whole investigation programme, 
they have been intended to constitute its foundations only. Their range 
is but general too; however based on facto graphic material, they did not 
lead to a detailed monography of all museum solutions that have ever 
been completed, but to a construction of a schematic 'framework' within 
which a monography of this kind might have been built at a suitable 
time.22 
The final scale of varieties recordable among museum solutions may 
be grasped on these conditions only, if two more factors were added to 
the general, 'structural' systematics: (1) the one of the historical time and 
(2) the factor of the specifications of the cultural milieu within which 
particular museum exhibitions are 'born' and reach their final shape, 
stylistic character, etc. Reaching these moments and furthermore - the 
rules, according to which the process of development of various exhibi-
tion types are performed - are of great cognitive as well as practical 
values. This field of investigation, however, is more distant from the 
problems of aesthetics, showing close affinities (first of all methodologi-
cally) to history of art.

tions in science museums, especially those of natural history, with marginal penetration 
only toward the problematics of Art Galleries.

logy'), understood as another chapter of detailed aesthetics have been carried out after In-

supervision.

scientific illustration and to museum exhibition as a sui generis work of scientific informa-
tion. (In Polish, with an English summary.) 
6 This type of complexity is specific as, although within the field of the works of art one 
can find examples of heterogeneous and complex origin (e.g. the works of stage decoration, 
some extremal 'species' of recent painting or sculpture, etc.), their complexity is never of 
the type which is encountered among exhibition works. The differences are mostly in the 
semantic structure of the latter works, as well as in their composition. 
7 See: John Wild, 'Man and His Life-World'; in the For Roman Ingarden - Nine Essays 
in Phenomenology, ed. Tymieniecka, s'Gravenhage, 1959, Nijhoff. The author applies in 
his essay the term of 'scientific universe'. Jerzy Swiecimski, 'Scientific Information Function

iana, vol. III, 1974. Ed. T. A. Tymieniecka, Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-
Holland. 
S The objects called here as factually represented ones (see, remarks below, in the main 
text) are those which are concretely seen in the painting, drawing, graphic work etc., and 
which are determined by the properties reckoned within the image only, i.e. without any 
'completing data', the perceived may add to them (for better understanding) from his own 
experience of the real things observed in the real world. In other words, if we intend to 
grasp these representations in origine, we have to take them irrespectively from any veri-
fication in nature: just so as they are drawn, painted or carved. Factually represented ob-
jects cannot be confused with their significations e.g. with real objects about which the 
work of art 'says'. This distinction is of special importance if one wants to testify the cor-
rectness of a scientific illustration work. In practice it happens rather often, that the prop-
erties of the objects signified by factual representations are confused with that what is 
formulated in the drawing or painting. (In a popular meaning, if we say, that a drawing 
'represents' a horse, we usually think about some real horse, not about the flat figure - a 
drawn one - which however labelled: 'a horse' shows but some degree of visual likeness 
only to the real object it signifies.) Confusing the properties of the factually represented 
object with those of its signification lead always to wrong evaluation of the representation's 
informative value. 
9 In scientific illustration, a great many deformations result from conventions and are 
accepted as correct interpretations of reality. Consequently, a factually represented object, 
to be understood in its contents in a proper way, must be interpreted in regard to those 
conventions, known in most cases to specialists only. See: J. Razowski and J. Swiecimski, 
'Ilustracja aparatow genitalnych owadow w publikacjach naukowych' (illustration of gen-
ital armatures of insects in scientific publication), Acta Zoologica Cracoviensia, Vol. XVI, 
No. 17, 1971. (In Polish with an English summary.) 
10 One of the most prominent types of this realism is represented by the Czechoslovak 
museum-artist, Zdenek Burian. Another type of scientific realism is represented by Jay 
Matternes, an artist from the Smithsonian Institution. The murals by Matternes are es-
pecially interesting because of the 'tapestry-like' style. Deliberate lack of 'air perspective', 

MUSEUM EXHIBITION AS A WORK OF ART 
185 
flatness of the composition, strict limitation of impressionistic effects give the works a 
specific air of scientific objectivity, although most of the objects represented (Matternes 
depicts mainly palaeontological restorations of extinct vertebrate species) are highly hypo-
thetical. 
liOn this ground the so-called 'morphological realism' is constituted. It is characterized 
by reckoning 'morphological properties' only, i.e. those which are important as determi-
nants in scientific definitions of the signified objects. In practice the pictures, although 
based on material 'models' (in most cases on series of specimens) signify general systematic 
units: species, subspecies, etc., e.g. in biology. 
12 In Poland for instance, museum illustration is strongly influenced by the style of Polish 
posters. One may say, not always with positive results, in regard to the clarity of scientific 
content which is often 'blurred' by over-attractive graphic form. 
13 By representations of general objects the choice of artistic form is, of course, always 
larger than in signifying ('depicting') individual, real things. 
14 I say, they are only of the category of things, because they not always are things in the 
sense of material objects. The 'species' (in the biological sense) for instance is not, how-
ever formally it shows an essential structure of things.

17 Programs based on positivistic or 'scientistic' sources generally neglected the role 
of aesthetic moment at all, limiting all aesthetic questions to 'subjective illusions' of the 
perceiver. Thus the tendency of interpreting aesthetics by the representatives of these trends 
in psychological measures rather than in ontological ones. See: R. Ingarden, Z badah nad 
jilozojia wspolczesnq (From the investigations on the recent philosophy), Warszawa, 1963 
(in Polish). 
18 This situation, however it may seem obvious, is in practice rather often neglected. 
Museum exhibitions, especially in science museums, are often designed as if they were 
addressed to specialists only. For the broader public they are completely 'hermetic'. Ex-
positions of two-functional character are rather rare indeed, however all of them should 
be evaluated as those of the highest quality. 
19 See the articles devoted to the programme of recent museum exhibitions, in Museum 
(Unesco Publications). 
20 In museologicalliterature we often find the terms: 'science museums' and 'art galleries'. 
These terms, although extremely popular are very far from precise. Their inadequacy 
becomes clear if we take for example archaeological exhibitions, where masterpieces of art 
are put on display 'on equal rights' with quite unartistic ('ordinary') things, e.g. some tools, 
objects of everyday life, etc. Besides, many 'art galleries' are at the same time museums of 
science, since the collections do not present 'just masterpieces put on display', but are 
arranged according to some scientific order. The term 'art gallery' appears to be rather 
traditional and descends from the time when museums of art were really nothing more 
than art collections. 
21 'Science museum' should be understood consequently as a museum devoted to knowl-
edge, irrespectively of its thematic character. The term: 'art gallery' should be preserved 
to those displays only, where the works of art do not illustrate any scientific idea or state-
ments, but are simply put on display as individual masterpieces, or are subordinated to 
some non-scientific order.

22 It is very doubtful, however, if such a monography may be written at all. Even such 
works like that by Roberto Aloi: Musei-Architettura-Technica, being intended as syntheses 
of the recently designed museum exhibitions, are written in a form which is far from com-
plete. It is indicated even in the title of Aloi's book, 'Esempi' (Examples). 

AUGUSTIN RISKA 
LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK 
OF ROMAN INGARDEN 
In striking contrast to the influential streams of his time, Roman In-
garden's philosophy of language and logic is clearly anti-positivistic in 
its nature. While the syntactic ideology of the Vienna Circle was achieving 
its high peak and the successful mathematical logic of Russell, Hilbert, 
G6del and Tarski did not even admit a dissenting voice in the traditional 
field of philosophical logic, Ingarden published his masterpiece, The 
Literary Work of Art, 1 which contains a full-blooded theory of language, 
and he also launched an attack against a positivistic interpretation or 
misrepresentation of logic and its role in philosophy.2 Moreover, his 
criticisms of the contemporary mathematical logic were supplemented 
by his pioneering work in the theory (and logic) of questions, 3 and by 
his treatments of hypothetical propositions,4 among other of his positive 
contributions. It is true - and the inspection of his bibliography reveals 
it - that Ingarden was not primarily a logician, not even a philosopher 
of language. His concerns with logic and language are part of a greater 
plan: the phenomenological reconstruction of philosophy via ontolog-
ical structural analysis - in particular the analysis of works of art. Such 
a tremendous task asks for an analogue of Aristotle's Organon. Ingarden 
inherited portions of a phenomenological Organon from his teacher, 
Husserl, and other leading members of the phenomenological move-
ment, especially A. Pfander. 5 Yet this heritage was not accepted un-
critically. In the Preface to The Literary Work of Art, Ingarden explains 
his disagreements with Husserl, aiming in particular at his Formale und 
transzendentale Logik.6 Therefore Ingarden was compelled to fill out the 
gaps, whether genuine or not, as he went along. He also had another 
source to consider: the intense logico-methodological awareness, strong-
ly present in Polish thinking since the victorious entry of Brentano's 
student K. Twardowski into Polish philosophical circles. Although In-
garden's criticism of positivistic logic is directed against its alleged

led to the mutual benefits of both parties involved. Ingarden's equip-
ment has apparently been enriched by mirroring the, technically highly 
qualified, precise apparata ofS. Lesniewski, L. Chwistek, T. Kotarbinski, 
A. Tarski, K. Ajdukiewicz, etc., while at the same time his warning 
voice might have forced them to examine more carefully the foundational 
problems of their enterprise. 7 
Let us, however, set aside the historical reconstruction of the relation-
ship between Ingarden and other relevant thinkers of his time, and con-
centrate our effort, rather systematically, on the main lines of Ingarden's 
views on language and logic. Although we shall start with the problems 
of language, logical aspects will be the focal point of our investigation. 
I. LANGUAGE AS A TOOL FOR ONTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
The standard point of departure for exhibiting Ingarden's theory of lan-
guage is his famed The Literary Work of Art. Now, after a recent ap-
pearance of his opus magnum in English, it is not necessary to expose 
its lines to a general English reader. Yet, there remains a lot to do in 
studying Ingarden's life work (including his later essays which explicitly 
deal with the problems of language 8), in locating it within the diversified 
stream of the philosophy of language in our century, and in exhibiting 
its features of originality, dependence and influence. 
The general schema which seems to underlie Ingarden's conception 
of language is his idea of language as an objective, stratified structure. 
Language is something objective in its syntactic aspects which comprise, 
besides the traditional grammatical categories of word, sentence, com-
plex sentence, etc., also the category of the word sound. 9 In addition, 
language is also objective in its semantic aspect. In other words, lin-
gustic meanings are, according to Ingarden, certain intersubjective, 
non-mental (non-psychic, non-subjective) entities, represented or 'ex-
ternalized' by their corresponding sounds or graphic expressions. To 
strengthen this point, Ingarden tenaciously fights several opponents: 
(a) psychologists of the 19th century tradition, who regard linguistic 
meanings and logical inferences as mental, psychological, and thus sub-
jective, entities ; (b) positivistic nominalists, especially those of the 
'physicalistic' sort; (c) Husserl's view of linguistic meaning as an ideal 
or, eventually, irreal objects, although he approaches this gently and 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGAR DEN

respectfully. The campaign against the psychologists, started earlier by 
G. Frege and Husser! and in Poland continued by Twardowski, Luka-
siewicz, and others, was almost over; on the other hand, nominalistically 
colored 'syntactism' in its physicalistic variant had been in vogue, waiting 
for R. Carnap's Logische Syntax der Sprache (1934) to give it the final 
touch. Ingarden was not blindfolded by the verification (verifiability) 
principle and the reduction of the meaning aspects of language to the 
sophisticated syntactic ones (to put it in vulgar terms: mere ink-marks 
on the paper).10 The subject matter investigated by him so thoroughly 
- the literary work of art - in itself resists such a treatment (unlike the 
mathematical, logical or physical sources and paradigm-cases of the 
neopositivists), although it can be assumed that without proper philo-
sophical perspectives Ingarden might have followed a formalistic path, 
it la the Russian Sklovskij. 
The painful disagreement with his esteemed teacher is of a different 
sort: widely known in the literature as the controversy between idealism 
and realism. 11 Ingarden appears to find a way out of this dilemma - at 
least in the analysis of a literary work of art - by putting an emphasis 
not on real or ideal objects but on 'pure intentional objects' which be-
came the centre of attention. Finding a neutral ground (which always 
remotely reminds me of Russell's 'neutral monism', empiriocriticism, or 
some interpretation of neo-Kantian forms) on a consistent phenome-
nological basis, Ingarden sets forth the third vertical level in the structure 
of the literary work of art, and, practically, in the semantic dimension 
of language called 'represented objectivities'. The existence of this di-
mension - termed in the contemporary semantic terminology as the 
realm of denotata, designata or referents - suggests a clear-cut case of 
the referential theory of meaning. 12 This point could be neatly visualized 
through the famous triangular scheme:

meaning (sense)--------------_+object represented 
As stressed by Ingarden, meaning (also: sense - no Fregean distinction 

190 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
between these two notions) plays the central role. It is a mediator or 
link between the linguistic expression (its sound, syntactic aspect) and 
the object (s) represented by it. Linguistic meaning is thus somewhat 
responsible for the constitution of a pure intentional object (its referent 
or denotatum); it is the determinator of the pure intentional object. In 
fact, the identity of an object is here guaranteed by the identity (syn-
onymy) of meaning. Such a descent from the mere linguistic world 
(levels one and two) to the world of pure intentional objects (the third 
level) is not accompanied by meticulously scrutinizing particular rules 
or sets of rules which would govern the ways of co-ordinating or binding 
entities from the above levels in both vertical and horizontal directions. 
Ingarden is neither interested in producing a well-articulated metalan-
guage in the style of Carnap or Tarski, nor in a painstaking scrutiny of 
the rules of the game. His approach is architectonic and descriptive, 
though in an essential, not factographic, sense. If he is stating the ne-
cessity of a one-to-one correspondence between particular meanings and 
their external 'expressions', in addition to discussing the problems of 
synonymy and homonymy, he may sound like a devoted Fregean and 
early Wittgensteinian reformer of language, who is permeated by the 
spirit of an 'ideal', unambiguous and clear-cut language. However, his 
remarks on Leibnizian 'ars combinatoria' or Fregean 'Begriffssprache', 13 
formulated in the context of discussing the role of terminological con-
ventions and stipulative definitions, would indicate the restrictive impact 
of such techniques which are efficient in closed scientific areas, but not 
in intuitively rich and vivid domains. 
There is a very important concept in Ingarden's theory of meaning, 
both from the semantic and phenomenological viewpoints. This is his 
intentional directional Jactor. 14 The intentional directional factor is a 
distinguished component in the meaning (sense) of a word. In addition, 
since sentences and their complexes are constructed out of words, its 
importance continues in the sense of sentences and higher linguistic 
complexes as well. The intentional directional factor is clearly present 
in the meaning of names (nominal meaning); in a modified version it 
partakes of the meaning of finite verbs (verbal meaning); and eventually 
it plays a role in the meaning of some functional words. 15 From the 
phenomenological standpoint we encounter a central issue: the projec-
tion leading from a linguistic entity (its sound plus meaning) toward its 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
191 
intended object; or perhaps the direction for such a projection which 
results in the constitution of the intentional object. Of course, this can 
be translated in the semantic jargon, and the closest candidates for such 
a translation would be 'designation', 'denotation', or 'reference'. All 
these terms stand for a relation which holds or ought to hold between 
a meaningful linguistic entity and the object(s) represented by it (using 
the word 'represented' in a very loose sense). As we know from the rich 
semantic literature, this semantic counterpart of the intentional direc-
tional factor (provided that it actually is its counterpart) is heavily loaded 
by very difficult problems, even antinomies. 16 Ingarden bypasses two 
subtle distinctions: (i) Frege's double aspect of meaning in the broader 
sense - 'Bedeutung' and 'Sinn'; (ii) Carnap's differentiation between 
L-determinate and non-L-determinate expressions. 17 According to 
Carnap, an L-determinate expression is an expression (designator) the 
extension (represented object, in Ingarden's terminology) of which could 
be found or determined just by the semantic rules of the language system 
(hence, the intentional object would be determinable solely by logical 
means; in an a priori manner). Ingarden appears not to be worried about 
the logical or non-logical (factual) determination or construction of the 
intentional object. To him the projection from the linguistic expression 
to its intended object is guaranteed primarily by the material content of 
the nominal (verbal) meaning - to speak only about the meaning of 
words - plus the formal content, and, perhaps, the two remaining ex-
istential aspects. 
This general observation may force us to look more carefully at the 
very basis of Ingarden's system. At the cross section of his ontology and 
theory of language, one finds the preference given to ontological as-
sumptions which seem to mold the basic linguistic material before the 
language can rush to help them to shape up. Language which is being 
sought as a tool servicing the ontology has already been dressed by its 
master, in a self-evident way. Remember, Ingarden distinguishes formal, 
existential, and material ontology; this division oflabor is then reflected 
in the basic elements of nominal meaning (to begin with). One could 
critically claim that the concept of material content, formal content and 
existential characteristic and position have been postulated and imposed 
upon the meaning of linguistic expressions in a manner of a Procrustean 
bed. But similar objections could be raised, for instance, against 'de-

192 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
notation' and 'sense' of G. Frege and A. Church, or against Carnap's 
'extension' and 'intension'. Indeed, the adherents of the 'use-in stead-
of-meaning' formula could capitalize on this point. Certainly, Ingarden 
is not questioning the legitimacy or usefulness of his basic categories 
which had been scrutinized and transmitted from one philosophical 
generation to another until they became the fundamentals in the phe-
nomenological creed. As a result, the above 5 elements of meaning (in-
cluding the pivotal one: the intentional directional factor) are accepted 
as given, as an 'essential fact' in the description of linguistic entities. 
Naturally, one must decide in each particular case what these elements 
are and how they behave. 
In the discussion of another important distinction within the nominal 
meaning, that of the potential and actual components (taking as an ex-
ample the word 'square'), Ingarden makes, perhaps surprisingly, another 
categorial addition. The nature of potentiality compells him to introduce 
into the scheme 'ideal concept'; although otherwise he tried to eliminate 
the Husserlian realm of idealities from his repertoire. The ideal concept 
of an object seems to be a source, a deep well, out of which the actualized 
portion of the nominal meaning has been drawn. The remainder of the 
concept will be left untouched. Portions of this remainder - the source 
of the potential stock of the nominal meaning - will be again brought 
to the open, thus enriching especially the material content of the nominal 
meaning. Nonetheless, the ideal concept of our object appears to be rich 
enough to permit the constitution of different meanings related to one 
and the same object. The dependence of meaning upon the full content 
of the ideal concept in question requires therefore the following modifi-
cation of the above referential triangle:

(The arrows indicate relations of various kinds, to be specified.) In the 
case of a name, the word sound and the meaning assigned to it compose 
together something that could be called 'linguistically immanent' - a 
completely given isolated word of a special category (here: name). The 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
193 
intentional object stands outside what is 'linguistically immanent', and, 
hence, it is 'transcendent' in this regard. But so is the ideal concept of 
the intentional object: standing outside both the name and its intended 
object, it is transcendent too, with regard to both of its partners. Ingarden 
warns us not to identify meaning with the ideal concept; 18 however, if 
the above schema is valid, the ideal concept appears to be the main 
source of constituting the meaning of a word which in turn determines 
the constitution of the intentional object. Since the talk about intentional 
objects keeps us on neutral ground, uncommitted as to the decision 
whether the intentional object is real or ideal,19 the ideal concept does 
not enjoy ontological priority; it does not transitively determine objects 
whatsoever as ideal. However, if there is such an ideal concept at all (as 
Ingarden cautiously expresses it), then it is the rich vein out of which 
the actualized content of the nominal (or other) meanings are to be ex-
tracted. One may wonder whether it is necessary at all to make this 
double distinction between actual and potential components which once 
refers to the linguistic meaning only, yet at another time to the relation 
between the meaning and its corresponding ideal concept. If all potential 
components of a nominal meaning are identical with those contained in 
the corresponding ideal concept, and there is no potential component 
in the ideal concept which would not be contained in the nominal 
meaning, then there is no need for maintaining the ideal concept be-
cause the same job will be done by the meaning. To cut off ideal con-
cepts could, however, mean the loss of the bridge between the realm of 
consciousness and the realm of linguistic meaning. Without such a 
bridge, the human activity of assigning particular meaning to a certain 
word sound, explicating the assigned meaning by virtue of definition or 
other means, etc., might undermine its theoretical basis and justifica-
tion.20 
In an important paragraph 38 of The Literary Work of Art, while 
discussing the distinctions between the determination of a real object 
and that of the intentional object, Ingarden notices that a real object is 
inexhaustibly 'given' by an infinite number of properties. On the other 
hand, the represented (intentional) object of the literary work of art is 
conveyed by a finite number of sentences (more precisely: by their in-
tentional correlates, i.e. states of affairs). However, since there is a two-
fold determination of the represented object by the relevant sentences 

194 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
and the relevant nominal expressions occurring in them, the represented 
objects potentially contain infinitely many characteristics. Nevertheless, 
only a finite portion of these characteristics is positively circumscribed 
via corresponding meaning units. Therefore, the represented (inten-
tional) object is not a full-blooded individual, but only a schematic one: 
left with many unqualified, open positions, the 'spots of indeterminacy'. 
Sometimes it is possible to fill out such spots by "strictly circumscribed 
manifolds of possible completions," 21 but the actual context of the liter-
ary work of art - and not the reader (hearer, etc.) - determines how far this 
can go. No doubt the potential stock may tremendously enrich the ex-
pressive power of a linguistic text, in particular a text of the work of art. 
If one takes into account another distinction referring to the material 
content of the nominal (and other) meaning - the distinction between 
constant and variable components - the situation becomes even more 
complex. Then semantics dealing with intersubjective meaning units of 
different kinds (nominal, verbal, sentential, etc.) will not preclude the 
infinitely rich content of these units. Such a content results from defi-
nitional, inferential and other dependencies between the meaning units. 
Human consciousness can operate only with a finite number of meaning-
constituting acts, but its products seem to be infinitely rich and thus 
competing with the inexhaustibility of real objects. If this is the case, the 
represented (intentional) object which is constituted via relevant meaning 
units, may also be inexhaustible. Then it would possess a double face: 
one, the 'schematic', bearing the marks of the limited human mind and 
its finite linguistic tools; the other, which parallels an unaccessible Sphinx 
living in real objects. The 'pragmatic' way of constituting intentional 
objects by virtue of the relevant meaning units is thus a selective process 
employing a limited number of means which are intended to pertain to 
the distinguished features of the object. If such a constitution is success-
ful, the intentional object emerges as a full, closed individual: the open, 
'unsaturated' positions, the spots of indeterminacy, shall not spoil the 
game. It appears that the ideal concept, being the first link in our last 
schema, is coming out of the picture; the most it can do is to provide a 
background for meaning-constitutions. 
Let us now summarize Ingarden's theory of meaning in a more formal 
fashion. We have to account particularly for the central role which the 
category of sentence holds in it. 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
195 
II. A SEMI-FORMAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INGARDEN'S 
THEOR Y OF MEANING 
Although Ingarden is aware of the fact that "the truly independent 
linguistic formation is not the individual word but the sentence," 22 he 
first treats the category of an isolated word. The reason for this is that 
word is "the simplest - if not the original - linguistic formation .... " 23 
An additional reason may be his claim that words have characteristic 
sounds,24 but there is no such thing as a sentence sound. A sentence is 
pronounced as a combination of word sounds, and the way this is done 
will produce special effects with regard to rhythm, tempo, melody, emo-
tional quality of the utterance, etc.; indeed, what matters is the articula-
tion of particular word sounds (regarded as types, not tokens). This 
feature is transferred to complexes of sentences as well. 
A. The Category of Word 
There is no strictly formal definition of word in Ingarden's theory. It is 
understood that the common sense and an elementary grammatical 
analysis helps us to distinguish one word from another. Compound 
phrases, e.g. descriptions, and anything short of a complete simple sen-
tence can be considered as words. 
Words are divided into: (a) those with full meaning; (b) syncategore-
matic (functors). 
Among (a) nominal expressions (names) and finite verbs are to be dis-
tinguished. This leads to a distinction between nominal meaning and 
verbal meaning. Let us use abbreviations: N for names, V for finite verbs, 
F for functional words. These abbreviations (and others which will be 
introduced in the course of our investigations) will be utilized in the 
schemata below. 
In general, the meaning of a word which is isolated from its sentence-
context is given by the following elements: 
(i) 
intentional directional factor: 
(ii) material content: 
m 
(iii) formal content: 
f 
(iv) existential characterization 
}. 
(v) existential position (location) . e 
If the word is a member of a sentence or complex of sentences, then an 

196 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
additional element joins the previous ones: 
(vi) apophantic-syntactic aspect: 
syn 
It is due to the intentional directional factor i that a name N is 'referring' 
toward an intentional object o. By regarding i as a relator which depends 
upon the other elements, and incorporating the word sound phs (derived 
from 'phonetic stratum' or Kung's 'phonemic structure') into the schema, 
the whole situation can be expressed symbolically as follows: 
N: {phs; i (m,f, e, syn)} 
t 
o 
It is possible that in concrete cases syn or e are empty. The arrow be-
tween i and 0 represents something like a reference-relation. 
The intentional directional factor i requires further specifications. It 
can be "single-rayed 
d 
. 
I

etermmate y 
multira ed.

mdetermmately. 
If single-rayed, it refers unequivocally to exactly one object; take as an 
example the phrase 'the center of the Earth'. If it is multirayed, it refers 
to several objects, and this is done either in a determinate way (e.g., 'my 
three sons'), or in an equivocal, indeterminate way (e.g., 'people'). To 
satisfy this distinction, which leads to the separation between individual 
and general names, we could add characterizations (one), (manyJ, 
(manyv) - where the subscript c stands for 'constant' or 'determinate', 
and v for 'variable', 'indeterminate' - to the right of the arrow (i.e., (one), 
(manyv), (many c)). Another important specification of i will result in an 
insertion of two factors into the brackets to the right of the sign i. In 
the material content m of the nominal meaning constant (c) and variable 
(v) components are to be distinguished (for instance, 'to be red as fresh 
blood' = c; 'to be colored' = v). These symbols and the symbols for actual 
(act) and potential (pot) will be put into the brackets to the right of the 
symbol i. The combinations of both distinctions characterize the pos-
sible ways of i's referring to the intentional object o. 
i (c, act), 
i(v, pot). 
The former case means that the intentional directional factor i is con-
stant and actual (e.g. the expression 'the centre of the Earth'), while the 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
197 
latter means that i is variable and potential (an example, 'a table'). The 
object, the centre of the Earth (not only intentional, but also real), is 
characteriz·ed merely by constant components of the material content m, 
and, moreover, in an actualized fashion. On the other hand, it is not 
clear which table is the intended object, and so the multirayed and in-
determinate projection via such i is based on variable components of the 
material content m. In this case, the intentional object table is not un-
equivocally given, and the potential characterizations must be actualized 
before a one-to-one relation between the meaning and the intended ob-
ject can be established. 
Intentional directional factor i and material content m are closely 
connected, and, as a matter of fact, i depends upon m more than on 
other factors. The material content m qualitatively describes the inten-
tional object. As Ingarden puts it down, the quality of the intentional 
object is completely determined by the material content which 'assigns' 
to it certain material characteristics and, thus, together with the formal 
content f of the nominal meaning, 'creates' the object. 25 Because of this 
strategic importance, the factors c, v, act, pot, previously appended to i, 
could be now assigned to the material content m in a simplified way. By 
combining symbols for constant (c) and variable (v) with the symbol m, 
we can get the following expression: m (cj ' Vk), where the subscripts j 
and k range over natural numbers. If the place occupied in the schema 
by Vk is empty, this means that there is no variable component in m, and, 
hence, the corresponding i is constant and actualized (i.e., it is either 
single-rayed, or multirayed but determinate). The presence of even a 
single variable Vk indicates that i is variable and potential. How many 
constant components are necessary to guarantee an actualized and con-
stant i? This remains an open question the answer to which must be 
given in each specific case. If we want to simplify the symbolism, we can 
append the subscripts c and v to m, so that the presence or absence of 
v will determine the nature of the factor i. Then it will suffice to use two 
schemata which seem to represent what Ingarden had in mind in talking 
about nominal meaning. 
(1) 
N: {phs; i (me> f, e, syn)} 
t 
o 

198 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
(2) 
N: {phs; i (mev, j, e, syn)} 
! 
o 
Schema (1) stands for the cases in which the factor i is constant and 
actual. This holds for the individual nominal expressions, such as 'the 
centre of the Earth', 'the table on which I am presently writing', but also 
for the plural nominal expressions, such as 'my three sons'. Schema (2) 
stands for the situations characterizing general nominal expressions: 
here the factor i is variable and potential (examples - 'the centre of a 
planet', 'a table', etc.). In schema (2) it is not necessary to qualify the 
arrow, because it is automatically the multirayed and indeterminate 
characterization (manyv) which here takes place. The factor syn is elim-
inated if the nominal expression is taken in isolation, out of its sentence-
context. However, in compound nominal (descriptive) expressions, like 
'the centre of the Earth', the partial expressions 'the centre of .. .', 'the 
Earth', are also syntactically connected. The seman tical counterpart of 
this feature might be incorporated in the meaning of the entire expres-
sion. It appears that Ingarden assigns such a job to the formal content. 
Remarkably,proper names are treated by him as falling under the schema 
(1). It is done in such a way that the only (and, of course, constant) com-
ponent of m is given by the very assignment of the name to the (real or 
fictitious) object referred to. This self-reflective use of the proper name 
in characterizing its own material content reveals the assumption that 
proper names have denotation but no connotation (to put it in Mill's 
old terminology). In the case of real objects, the ostensive correlation 
between a proper name and its corresponding individual object will do 
the job. However, an example of a fictional, intentional object like 
Hamlet shows a need of considering not only various descriptions of 
such an object, but also the existential factors e. 
The examples used and the entire structure of the nominal meaning 
suggest that one deals here with a kind of semantics and logic of terms. 26 
Terms, and not predicates, express here various characteristics or prop-
erties of objects. These characteristics are hierarchically ordered with an 
increasing degree of generality. Ingarden's variables v are general terms 
- species and genera of an Aristotelian classificatory system. Constants 
c are terms of lower degree, not necessarily the terms of the lowest level. 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGAR DEN

'To be red' is a constant with regard to the variable 'to be colored', and 
also perhaps as to the variable 'to have a shape'. It is always a problem 
how to satisfy the sufficient and necessary conditions for the individ-
ualization of the object in question, without using the principle of in-
discemibles in infinite domains, because then it would be practically im-
possible to communicate and determine anything. 
Everyone who is acquainted with linguistic, logical and ontological 
problems of meaning, synonymy, denotation, definition, etc., knows 
how complicated these issues are. Let us recall e.g. Russell's theory of 
description and also his theory of types which was further developed by 
F. Ramsey, L. Chwistek and A. Church. It could also be instructive to 
compare Ingarden's theory of word meaning with C. I. Lewis' concep-
tion, mentioned above, especially because of Lewis' sensitivity to modal 
aspects. Another suitable candidate for a comparison would be K. 
Ajdukiewicz, a distinguished Polish logician, who further developed S. 
LeSniewski's theory of syntactic (actually: semantic) categories.27 
In order to clarify some of the last theoretical remarks, let us analyze 
Ingarden's example of a nominal compound expression, 'the smooth 
red sphere'. This expression has a form of Russell's definite description 
and could be dealt with according to the recipes given by Russell and 
other authors. If we, however, stick to Ingarden's proposal, we may 
notice the following. The above expression consists of four individual 
words, of which three are nominal words ('smooth', 'red', 'sphere') and 
one, the definite article 'the', is a functional word. Although two of the 
words are adjectives, they are treated as nominal words, on par with 
nouns. If taken in isolation, the general noun 'sphere' has its own meaning 
which can be elucidated by proper substitution in our schema (2), taking 
the factor syn as empty. By specifying mev, we would use a finite number 
of variables (general terms; 'generic essences'), like VI = 'colored', V 2 = 
'extended', V3 = 'limited', V4= 'having a surface', etc., just as few avail-
able constants ('eidetic singularities', in Husserl's sense), for instance, 
c 1 = 'being three-dimensional', c 2 = 'having all points on the surface 
equally distant from its centre', etc. Some of these terms, for example, 
c2 , are formulated in an awkward way, but this is the price paid for 
operating with mere terms and no sentences at this point. 28 It is to be 
noted that for the same reasons we are not giving a definition of the 
word 'sphere', although C2 prepares a good ground for it. How do we 

200 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
know that the variables and constants employed for the meaning speci-
fication of the word 'sphere' are relevant at all? Why do we hit upon 
the most relevant ones without a tremendous trial-and-error search 
among thousands of them? Naturally, this has something to do with 
our understanding of the language used, but also with our comprehen-
sion of Euclidian geometry, populated by ideal objects, such as spheres, 
cubes, cones, and the like. We can recognize something as a sphere if 
we see it in our visual field, even without being able to give a precise 
explicit definition of it. Our specification of mcv pertaining to 'sphere' 
keeps i indeterminately multirayed, because it will not 'refer' to one and 
only one object in the realm of objectivities (whether ideal, real, or purely 
intentional). Ingarden 'nominalistically' requires that the single-rayed 
factor i projects either a concrete individual, be it a thing, a person, or 
a well-specified state, part or action of a concrete individual. 29 This 
strict requirement of providing a sufficient and necessary condition for 
the individuation of objects (whatever their nature), may be imposed 
upon an ostensive definition, but not on a definition in general, unless 
the notion of individuation is so broad that it covers 'generic essences', 
such as 'sphere' or 'spherical'. Then the only condition for i being single-
rayed would be that it projects something which is numerically one in 
an unequivocal way. If this is the case, the, ideal, object sphere could be 
'projected' by a single-rayed i, provided that the meaning specification 
of the word 'sphere' is consistent and complete. Perhaps our example, 
'sphere', is misleading, because there is an ideal object behind it. More-
over, the meaning specification of the word 'sphere' must take into ac-
count the existential factors e which would determine the sphere as an 
ideal object in a different way than particular instances of sphere. None-
theless, the question of individuality requires a very sensitive, non-
arbitrary framework in which it must be studied and settled. I do not 
know whether Ingarden realized the vast scope of this problem. 
Coming back to our example, the meaning of the adjectives 'smooth' 
and 'red' must also be specified separately, before everything merges into 
a compound meaning corresponding to the expression 'the smooth red 
sphere'. Furthermore, the definite article is responsible for the magic 
twist creating the single-rayed i that projects the well-specified individual 
object (whatever its nature), the smooth red sphere. The meaning spec-
ification of 'smooth' and 'red' will not determine any individual Smooth-

ness or Redness, and to consider some The-ness, which would correspond 
to the functional word 'the', sounds quite ridiculous (at least, in Ingar-
den's account). 
As a result of the meaning specification, the following obtains:

The slants divide words for which the meaning specification was done. 
All the meaning factors are tacitly assumed. The diagram shows that, 
although the three nominal components of the expression are general, 
the entire expression is individual. The ostensive function of the definite 
article is concealed, but crucial for the assignment of the single-rayed i 
to the whole expression. Functional words F, according to Ingarden, do 
not have, as a rule, an intentional directional factor i. There are, how-
ever, exceptions, such as the words 'this', 'that', 'the'. It is likewise with 
the material content ofF. 30 Unfortunately, Ingarden's theory of functors 
is very fragmentary; unlike Lesniewski's and Ajdukiewicz's conception 
of functors as a part of their theory of syntactic (semantic) categories. 
Now, let us make a final remark on the result of our analyzed example. 
With the help of schema (2), the meaning specifications of the words 
'smooth', 'red', and 'sphere' were given. Each specification led to the 
projection of many objects (indeterminately). But then the three meaning 
specifications merged into a new one, subordinated under our schema 
(I). We know almost nothing about the rules of such a merger, except 
that the variables occurring in the previous meaning specifications have 
been somehow cancelled out. A traditional diagram, with circles rep-
resenting sets of objects which are distributively referred to by the cor-
responding general terms, might help us to see the situation. The object, 
which is projected by the expression 'the smooth red sphere', lies in the 
intersection of all three circles. It is assumed that there is exactly one 
object in the intersection - our intended one. Indeed, we have no guar-
antee that in reality there is exactly one object which is both spherical, 
red and smooth. We can intend to have only one such object - and the

use of the definite article puts then a stamp on this intention - but, of 
course, one may intend to constitute even impossible or inconsistent ob-
jects, a la centaurs or round squares. 
Another remarkable thing happened in the course of our meaning spec-
ification: our key expression, 'sphere', has been horizontally extended, 
to the left, by the adjectives 'red' and 'smooth', substituting their meaning 
(together with phs) for some variables occurring in mcv of 'sphere'. For 
instance, the constant 'red' replaced VI ('colored'), and the constant 
'smooth' removed a bit of variability - to express it metaphorically -
from V4 ('having a surface'), changing it into 'having a smooth surface'. 
As we see, the concepts of constant and variable are pretty vague; as 
vague as the relations between general terms expressed in ordinary lan-
guage. In a type-theoretical ordering of general terms (concepts), byas-
signing level 0 to the most specific terms (concepts), one could explicate 
at least some necessary conditions for determining constants and vari-
ables. For instance, any specification of a term from level n (variable) 
by a term from level k, where k < n, could be considered as an employ-
ment of a constant. However, 'red' is a specification of 'colored', but it 
is not quite clear whether it is also a specification of 'extended'. Thus 
it appears that we know what is a constant when we successfully reach 
an individual object via corresponding meaning specification. Obviously, 
such an ex post knowledge of constants would completely defeat the 
purpose. 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
203 
As regards the distinction between actual and potential meaning com-
ponents, one encounters an additional complication. On the one hand, 
potentiality somehow squares with the variability, on the other, real 
objects are infinitely rich in aspects, properties, etc., while the purely 
intentional objects are left with limitless spots of indeterminacy. Put 
together, the so-called unfulfilled properties of real objects, or the spots 
of indeterminacy characterizing an intentional object, suggest the oc-
currence of an unlimited number of 'genuine' variables (i.e., unspecified 
general terms) in the material content of any nominal expression. To 
save the applicability of our schema (1), we are compelled to disregard 
these 'genuine' variables and consider only those which have been ex-
plicitly formulated. Taking our previous example, the word 'sphere', its 
material content would be given, say, by: 
i.e., by a finite number of constants and variables, and not by: 
where j and k stand for finite or infinite natural numbers. If we accept 
the latter as the more adequate representation of the situation, then the 
realm of potential stock splits into two parts: (i) the explicitly given 
variables (in our case: Vi to V4); (ii) the implicitly assumed, perhaps 
infinitely many variables (in our case, those represented by three dots 
and Vk as the last member) which are left completely open. Actualization, 
i.e., the 'substitution' of constants for variables would then refer to part 
(i), and only indirectly to (ii). To individualize an object would thus mean 
to catch it in a strategically suitable net of variables and then to look 
through each hole what kind of fish we have caught. 
However, one must bear in mind that constants and variables are again 
linguistic expressions - terms - having their own meaning. Their meaning 
specification, by using our schemata (1) and (2), could produce extremely 
complicated structures, nested within each other. As in the theory of 
definition, the meaning components are not like a heap of gravel, but 
a system of interconnected entities constituted by the acts of conscious-
ness and left afterwards to bear their own destiny. Ingarden correctly 
considers meaning as an organic unity, resulting from the merger of its 
components. Unfortunately, the ways, regulations and rules of such a 

204 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
merger remain obscure. A little more light will be cast on the issue by 
turning the attention toward the central category of sentence. 
B. The Category of Sentence 
In a customary way, Ingarden classifies sentences into assertive (de-
clarative), interrogatory, imperative, optative, etc. This classification is 
based on differences between purely intentional correlates of sentences. 
According to Ingarden, "every sentence - even the absurd and the am-
biguous one - has its own purely intentional correlate." 31 The purely 
intentional correlate of a declarative sentence is the intentional state of 
affairs (abbreviation: s). Problem 32 is the purely intentional correlate of 
an interrogative sentence; and command is the one pertaining to an 
imperative sentence. As in the case of purely intentional objects 0, pro-
jected by nominal expressions, the transition from the purely intentional 
correlate of sentence to an objective (real, ideal, merely possible, etc.) 
correlate - state of affairs, for declarative sentences - transcends the 
mere meaning of the sentence in question, asking for the additional 
information. What is involved is the 'mode of existence' of such a cor-
relate. Taking only declarative sentences, a distinction is drawn between: 
(a) pure affirmative propositions; (b) assertive propositions or judg-
ments; and (c) quasi-judgments (characteristic for the sentences found 
in the literary work of art). 
Pure affirmative propositions have only purely intentional correlates, 
without any commitment to their truth or falsity, which is a matter of 
judgment as a specific cognitive (subjective) operation. The sentence, 
'This dog is brown', if regarded as a pure affirmative proposition, would 
not project, by virtue of its meaning, any objectively existing, real state 
of affairs, but only its purely intentional correlate s. 
On the contrary, to make an assertive (also: judicative) proposition 
means to judge, i.e., to project not only its purely intentional correlate 
(which has a dependent, heteronomous ontic status), but also further -
the objectively existing state of affairs. Ingarden complains about the 
fact that there is no sign in colloquial speech for distinguishing pure 
propositions and judgments, and proposes to use Frege's and Russell's 
sign of assertion '1-', if necessary. Accordingly, I- 'Los Angeles is in 
California' would mean that whoever formulates this proposition is at 
the same time asserting its truth, pushing his way from the purely in-

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
205 
tentional correlate of this sentence to the corresponding real (objectively 
existing) state of affairs. 
The difference between pure affirmative and assertive Gudicative) 
propositions can also be expressed by a reference to the existential ele-
ments e of meaning, which are now stretched to the meaning of a sen-
tence: in a pure affirmative proposition there is an existential charac-
terization, but no location. We must be careful to distinguish the pure 
affirmative proposition from a false assertive Gudicative) proposition. 
Let us use the following example of a false judicative proposition: I- 'Los 
Angeles is in Massachusetts'. Here the existential position is determined, 
but, according to Ingarden, 'without power', i.e., without projecting the 
corresponding (assumed) real state of affairs. And we must also distin-
guish it from a negative existential proposition Gudgment), such as I-
'There are no centaurs', which is claimed to be true. 
Finally, the third category of declarative sentences is recognized by 
Ingarden - the category of quasi-judgment. This category plays a tre-
mendously important role in the analysis of the literary work of art. 33 
Quasi-judgment is a declarative sentence that is 'more' than a pure af-
firmative proposition (projecting only the purely intentional correlate), 
and 'less' than an assertive Gudicative) proposition which is accompa-
nied by a claim to truth, and therefore by a projection from the purely 
intentional correlate further to objectively existing state of affairs. If in 
a novel, there is a sentence: 'Mr. Jones murdered his wife', such a sen-
tence is a quasi-judgment. The projection goes here beyond the purely 
intentional correlate, but it does not reach any objectively existing, real 
state of affairs; it only simulates such a state of affairs, pretends to con-
stitute it. In a similar way, one can speak about quasi-question, quasi-
command, or quasi-evaluation. If we wish to use a symbol for quasi-
judgment, a modified version of the assertion sign 'ql-' would be suit-
able; however, such a sign is redundant if we know that our sentence 
occurs in the context of a literary work of art. 
The abovementioned classification of declarative sentences presup-
poses the concept of truth and falsity. Of course, Ingarden does not 
accept Fregean Truth and Falsity as 'referents' of declarative sen-
tences. 34 Truth is not a component of the purely intentional correlate 
of sentence, and it is not a component of the objectively existing state 
of affairs either, although it is somehow responsible for making the 

206 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
transition from the former to the latter. Since truth and falsity are here 
only agents acting behind the scene, let us tum attention to the visible 
actor, performing on the scene: the purely intentional state of affairs s. 
In order to deal with it, we have to look at the manner in which the 
meaning components of the sentential meaning contribute to the pro-
jection, constitution or 'creation' of s. 
Since verbs are distinctive contributors to the constitution of a sen-
tence, it is now time to characterize verbal meaning. Ingarden analyzes 
finite verbs (verbum jinitum), such as 'writes'. The analysis follows the 
familiar lines of treating the nominal meaning, but our schemata (1) and 
(2) cannot be applied in a straightforward way. Material and formal 
contents are present in the meaning of a finite verb, but not the (nominal) 
intentional factor i. However, there exists a substitute for it: the verbal 
intentional directional factor which is pointing, not toward the activity, 
happening or occurrence elucidated by the material content of the finite 
verb, but 'backward', toward the agent (subject) or patient (object) of the 
activity. By omitting the introduction of too many new symbols, let us 
condense the diagrammatic representation of the situation in the fol-
lowing fashion.

The broken arrow which leads from the verbal expression to the agent 
of action (wagon) or to the bearer (rose) of a given property, represents 
the verbal intentional directional factor. In the second example, the 
predicative phrase 'is red' fulfills a similar 'verbal' role like the verb 
'passes by' in the first, although they also significantly differ. Both ex-
amples are regarded as pure affirmative propositions, with s as their 
corresponding purely intentional correlates. Such s is a compound entity 
and the object 0 is embedded in it as its core. The object 0 is codetermined 
by two helpers: one is the functor ('a', in the first; 'this', in the second 
example); the other is the verb 'passes by' and the verbal predicative 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
207 
phrase 'is red', respectively. We can represent the structure of both states 
of affairs s as follows: 
s=<o,a>, 
s=<o,P>, 
where a stands for 'activity' 
where P stands for 'property' . 
Neither a nor P are projected by their corresponding verbal phrases in 
the way ° is projected by the nominal expressions. This shows that the 
verbal phrases are incomplete, unsaturated, unless connected with some 
nominal expressions, the referents of which are carriers of properties and 
agents or patients of activities, performances or occurrences. Of course, 
our examples grasp the structure of very simple categorical (subject -
predicate) affirmative sentences and their intentional correlates. The sit-
uation is more complicated for richer simple sentences, and especially 
for compound sentences. 35 
Let us now go back to the previous example, 'the smooth red sphere'. 
After rephrasing it in a sentential form, 'This sphere is red and smooth', 
we get an expression with different meaning: schemata (1), (2) will still 
be applicable to its nominal component, 'sphere', 'this sphere', but not 
to the whole sentence. Moreover, the phrase 'is red and smooth' is a 
verbal predicative expression endowed by a verbal meaning, and thus 
also with 'backward' pointing verbal intentional directional factor. The 
general terms, 'red', 'smooth', have, as before, their nominal meaning 
(variable and potential); however, as parts of the predicative phrase, they 
will not be able to project any independent object. The whole verbal 
predicative phrase needs namely a completion by the nominal expression 
which occupies the subject position in the categorial sentence. The key 
word in the predicative phrase, 'is', has in general various meanings, but 
here it is a functor which cements the nominal - verbal development of 
the sentence and helps to projects, where s= <o,p>. Ifwe take Ingarden's 
metaphorical formulations, such as 'opening of a self-enclosed object', 
'the surmounting of the subject and predicate', into account, we must 
now look closer at ° and p as the components of s. In fact, here we have 
two properties, PI (red) and P2 (smooth), assigned positively to o. How 
do they determine sphere as our object o? Ingarden accepts the Aris-
totelian - scholastic distinction of substance and attributes, but he also 
gives credit to the empiricist critique of substance. Instead of 'substance', 
he then uses the word 'carrier'; meant as an analogue of the notion of 

208 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
substance in ontological, but not metaphysical, sense. There is a carrier-
'element' in the intentional object 0 and this 'element' is projected in a 
two-fold way: one, by virtue of one of the components ofm (e.g., 'sphere-
ness'); the other, through the formal content of the nominal expression. 
The latter, "the carrier of the properties of the purely intentional object 
as such," 36 has an ontological priority. It is this carrier which holds 
properties like red or smooth in our example. Both the carrier and the 
properties (attributes, accidents) are ontically dependent, if taken sep-
arately, but together they produce an ontically independent individual. 
Obviously, the object 0 is not regarded as a 'dummy', waiting for the 
properties relations, actions, etc., in order to be dressed, i.e., determined. 
In addition, Ingarden claims that when we explicitly talk 'about one of 
the properties of an object (say, sphere), all the object's properties are 
potentially, implicitly cointended. This seems to be a very bold claim. 
As an anti-psychologist, Ingarden certainly does not buy the old as-
socianism of Hume and Mill: the appearance of one 'idea' (of redness, 
e.g.) would not activate the appearance of other related 'ideas'. In ad-
dition, there is also his declaration about the inexhaustible richness of 
real objects qua real objects, and about the limited, finite determination 
of an intentional object, marked by many spots of indeterminacy. How 
should we then understand the above cointention? Apparently not in a 
sense of a primary intentional act the scope of which would here compel 
us to postulate a kind of a superhuman consciousness. The other alter-
native is that the coin tent ion is a result of the so-called derived inten-
tionality which has been loaned to the intersubjective meanings of lin-
guistic expressions, once they had been established by the users of the 
language in a more or less consistent manner. Yet, there is a hidden 
danger: what if the meanings - the intersubjective offsprings of inten-
tional acts of human consciousness - behave as Frankensteins, unleashed 
and beyond control? Fortunately, they do not act on their own, because 
every change in them is again due to some act of human consciousness! 
One way out would be just to register all the sentences in which a 
certain nominal expression, such as 'sphere', occurs; predominantly in 
the subject position. By virtue of the sentences we would thus register 
all the projected states of affairs in which our object-carrier, sphere, is 
embedded, or, as Ingarden puts it, is 'ensnared', 'caught as in a net,.37 
If this is what is meant under cointention, then the rule is quite obvious: 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
209 
look at all possible sentences in which the name of the object in question 
occurs, and the determinants which you find there, except the one on 
which you focus your attention (i.e., redness, in our· case), will be what 
is cointended. The trouble is with the phrase 'all the properties of...'. 
Should we not cautiously say: 'all the intended properties of...'? Yet 
how do we know which are the intended properties if we have lost track 
of what had been programmed into the meanings of linguistic expressions 
employed? 
As regards the determination of real objects (as real, not as 'intended 
real objects' or 'also intended'), Ingarden played around with assigning 
to such an object, for all properties, either the property p or its negation 
non-p, but never both at the same time. Being backed by the Aristotelian 
principles of contradiction and excluded middle (as well as by the two-
valued logic), this idea naively runs into two major obstacles: (a) the 
collapse of the purely combinatorial treatment of state-descriptions, wit-
nessed by the necessity of introducing so-called meaning postulates; 38 
(b) Russell's paradox, showing the impossibility of the set of all sets; and, 
hence, if properties are treated extensionalistically, of the set of all prop-
erties as welL 
It is conceivable and plausible that properties are interconnected; 
some of them are dependent upon each other, others independent. This 
presupposes a knowledge of various relations between properties. Some 
of these relations may be grasped on an a priori basis, but perhaps the 
majority of them can be handled only a posteriori. Unfortunately, In-
garden seems to give no clue in this regard. So it happens that we en-
counter similar problems in the analysis of compound nominal expres-
sions, such as 'the red smooth sphere', as well as in scrutinizing related 
sentences like 'The sphere is red and smooth'. It is not difficult to reveal 
the common troublemaker: potentiality (variability, implicitness). Never-
theless, Ingarden provides us with such rich and original insights and 
conceptual distinctions that the stimulation overshadows technical dif-
ficulties and shortcomings. 39 
Ingarden recognizes other traditional classifications of sentences; in 
fact, several of them. One is the division of (declarative) sentences into: 
assertive, problematic, and apodeictic (necessary). Another, on which his 
interests dwell more, is the famous distinction between categorical, hy-
pothetical (conditional) and disjunctive sentences. However, this topic 

210 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
takes us into the midst of Ingarden's concerns with the foundation of 
logic. 
III. INGARDEN'S EXCURSIONS INTO LOGIC 
As emphasized, Ingarden was not a logician in the contemporary mean-
ing of the word 'logic'. Also he did not write his Logical Investigations 
or Formal and Transcendental Logic, and was largely dependent upon 
Hussed, Pfander, and others, for a 'logical machinery'. The study of 
formal inference and entailment, as it seems, had not greatly attracted 
his interests. Consequently, his logic is a continuation of linguistic, and 
in particular, semantic analyses. It is to his credit that he always accepted 
semantics; without waiting for the appearance of Tarski's celebrated 
breakthrough in the theory of truth.40 Of course, Ingarden's semantics 
suffers for overlooking Frege's theory of sense and denotation which has 
proven itself as a landmark in the current semantic scene.41 Therefore, 
Truth and Falsity, as the Fregean denotata of declarative sentences, have 
not been turned into Ingarden's intentional, or other, correlates of sen-
tences. On the contrary, two postulated truth-values (and their relatives 
in many-valued logics) are vigorously disapproved of in a theory which 
had replaced them by non-Fregean states of affairs. 42 This may be wit-
nessed by Ingarden's repeated attacks on logical atomistic use of 1 and 
o as symbols standing for Truth and Falsity, respectively. One can under-
stand Ingarden's anger in the context of his disapproval of the 'pan-
syntactic' or 'physicalistic' interpretation of such conventional symbols, 
but why is it necessary to go to the opposite extreme? As every student 
of logic today knows, I and 0 (or whatever other suitable symbols) are 
handy and useful objects in dealing with truth-functional connectives, 
in evaluating well formed formulae, and in many other standard oper-
ations in extensional, but also other, logics. The puzzle of material im-
plication (conditional), which aggravated Ingarden so much, is being 
treated quite satisfactorily in literally hundreds of standard logical text-
books. On the other hand, Ingarden put his fingers into a really accute 
. question of the adequacy of material implication with regard to the 
ordinary and scientific employment of implication or entailment.43 His 
recipe for handling this issue is consistent with the treatment of the con-
ditional sentence (of the form 'if p, then q', where 'p' and 'q' are sen-
tential variables) as an organic whole. Ingarden opposes the common 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
211 
view that the antecedent ('p') and consequent ('q') can be logically evalu-
ated in isolation from the whole conditional sentence, and that the value 
of this sentence is dependent exclusively on such isolated evaluations and 
their possible combinations. His proposal is thus of a Gestalt type, in-
stead of a standard atomistic one. On this view, the functor 'if ... , then 
---', in its truth-functional definition, loses its key role, which can be 
recaptured by tightly cementing 'if' with the antecedent (and thus with 
its state of affairs), and 'then' with the consequent (and the respective 
state of affairs). It is hard to comprehend syntactic-semantic categories 
under which such expressions as 'if p', 'then q' could be subsumed. In 
addition to making many interesting points, Ingarden also touches upon 
the open problem of counterfactuals and subjunctive conditionals (his 
terms: modus potentialis or irrealis), and the relevance between the 
meanings of antecedence and consequent. Had he introduced some sym-
bolic apparatus and inferential schemata (logical theses) which would 
implicitly explicate the sense of his proposed implication, a competitive 
theory of implication might have been established. What actually hap-
pened is only the clarification of the ground. 
Ingarden's treatment of universal and existential sentences, starting 
from categorial ones, reveals some surprising features. First, he is not 
willing to accept the customary translation of the universal affirmative 
categorical sentence 'All S are P' (i.e., sentence of the kind A) into a 
quantified sentence 'for all x, if x is S, then x is P' (where 'is' represents 
the relation of class membership; or just the positive predication of the 
properties Sand P, respectively). This is caused, not so much by his 
principle of multiple denotation (according to which, general terms do 
not refer to classes of objects, but - in a multirayed and indeterminate way 
- distributively to each individual member of the class), but rather by 
his misunderstanding of the whole issue. Such a 'nominalistic' treatment 
does not preclude quantification over term variables for which individual 
terms can be substituted. Another doubtful point is the translation of 
particular sentences (1,0). 'Some S are P' is translated by him into 'There 
is such S that S is P', or, symbolically: '(ES) is P'. This sentence appears 
to lose its subject, because '(ES)' is regarded as a functor to which a 
quantifierless proposition is being appended. The term S is general, if 
not refer to classes of objects, but - in a multirayed and indeterminate way 
wise it fails to be a term altogether (being a part of a functor). All the 

212 
AUGUSTIN RISKA 
troubles may be caused by a non-standard symbolism that is hard to 
square with the customary one. 
Ingarden is positively at his best while analyzing interrogatory sen-
tences and questions (problems) as their intentional correlates. His study 
Essentiale Fragen 45 deserves to be a classic in the field of the logic of 
questions. The area is too rich to be treated comprehensively, so that we 
confine ourselves to the bare minimum. It is true that the essay is dom-
inantly of ontologico-epistemological nature. Fine conceptual distinc-
tions between idea, ideal quality, individual object, its nature and es-
sence, predicative proposition, absolute and relative characteristic, etc., 
have been outlined; to a great extent in discussing the results of Jean 
Hering's essay dealing with similar issues.46 Nevertheless, the formula-
tion of basic problems and the results of subtle analyses are of great im-
portance for the logic of questions. The very subject matter of the essay 
- essential questions - are questions of the kind "What is it"? of "What 
is x"? (where 'x' is a variable standing for individual or general terms -
concepts). Ingarden recognizes the problem of correctly and incorrectly 
stated questions, equivocal and unequivocal questions, etc. He also dis-
tinguishes four characteristic points: (a) the unknown; (b) the known part; 
(c) the objective ('problem'); and (d) presupposition of a question. For the 
question 'What is it'?, (a) the unknown is an individual object as con-
stituted by its individual nature; (b) that what is known is an individual 
object, ostensively conceived by virtue of a schema; (c) the objective is 
an establishment of identity between that which is known and the sought 
value of the unknown; (d) the presupposition encompasses the general 
assumption that every individual object is constituted by its individual 
nature, and such a minimal knowledge of the known part of the question 
that enables us to point unequivocally toward what is sought. 4 7 The 
answers of the essential questions can provide us with a sufficient knowl-
edge of an object in its essence. The questions asking for the nature of 
an object (,What is the nature of it'?) or its essence ("What is the essence 
of the object x"?) are to be distinguished from the essential questions, 
as a kind of meta-questions. Ingarden does not analyze them. No doubt, 
all these subtle problems would require an adequate translation into the 
current language employed in the field of the theory of questions.48 Ob-
viously, here we have to wait for future contributions, focused, in full 
or in part, on Ingarden's work in the area.

IV. SUMMARY 
I have tried to explicate some of the key notions in Ingarden's theory 
of language and to outline his occasional glances at the riches of logic. 
Ingarden's life work is - as he himself might put it - an organic unity, a 
grand scaled polyphonic structure. To separate one piece of such an 
edifice from the rest of it, means to run a grave risk of misrepresentation 
and misinterpretation. I have been aware of this danger, pointing out 
the necessity of analyzing the topics, such as theory of meaning, language 
and logic, in the entire context of Ingarden's work. There is another 
methodological problem we must be concerned with: should an inves-
tigator authentically follow Ingarden's own language and technique, or 
could one impose upon the text studied what is regarded as the 'current 
fare'? Evidently, the answer may be different for a strictly historical 
study, and different for a systematic or comparative investigation. Al-
though the present essay is not an historical one, I have attempted to 
maintain Ingarden's own theoretical and terminological style. It is my 
conviction that the explication of Ingarden's views must pay respect to 
his way of putting things before other conceptual and linguistic apparata 
are imposed upon it. It may be tempting to someone, who is at home in 
Chomsky, structural linguistics, modal logics, logical analysis of natural 
languages it la R. Montague, J. Katz, D. Davidson, or the British late-
Wittgensteinians, to apply his favorite jargon. However, I think that a 
self-restraint is advisable at first. 
Finally, it is remarkable how the two giants who jointly fought psy-
chologism of the late 19th century - Frege and Husserl- originated such 
different and powerful streams in contemporary logical, linguistic and 
epistemological thinking. According to my view, these streams actually 
complement each other if one approaches them sensitively and with a 
good will. This is the ideology by virtue of which I try to understand 
and evaluate Ingarden's work, or at least some of its aspects.

5 A. Pfander is one of the most quoted authors in Literary Work. His Logik, 3rd ed., M. 
Niemeyer, Tubingen, 1963 (first published in Jahrbuch for Philosophie IV (1921)) seemed 
to have provided Ingarden with very efficient tools. See also my article 'The 'A priori' in 
Ingarden's Theory of Meaning', Analecta Husserliana III (1974) 138-146. 
6 This work of Husserl (recently translated in English by D. Cairns; M. Nijhoff, The 
Hague, 1969) was published in 1929, while Das literarische Kunstwerk had been close to 
its printing stage. 
7 This may be a justified claim, even if Polish logicians do not give credit to Ingarden for 
such stimuli. Perhaps they regarded Ingarden's excursions into logic and language as being 
out of the main stream (from their standpoint). Ingarden was especially annoyed by the 
silent reception of his 'Essentiale Fragen'. Some logicians later elaborated logics of ques-
tions without acknowledging the source of their inspiration. In particular this might refer 
to K. Ajdukiewicz. See below, note 48. 
8 Some of them have been included in vol. IX of his Philosophical Works, entitled Z teorii 
jezyka ijilozojicznychpodstaw logiki, PWN, Warszawa, 1972. 
9 As known, the level of the word sound is the first stratum to be analyzed in the poly-
phonic structure of the work of art. The word sound is a bearer of the corresponding 
linguistic meaning which is to be investigated as the second, but central, stratum in such 
a structure.

14 In Polish: wskaznik kierunkowy; in German: der intentionale Richtungsfaktor; in 
English also terms like 'projector', 'index', 'vector', 'pointer', could be used. 
15 Names, finite verbs and functional words (functors, using Lesniewski's terminology) 
are the three basic categories of words. The nominal meaning - the paradigm case - is 
composed of 5 elements: (i) intentional directional factor; (ii) material content; (iii) formal

content; (iv) existential characterization; (v) existential position. See Literary Work, par.

16 Let us mention the classical antinomy of the name-relation, the history and reconstruc-
tion of which is given in R. Carnap, Meaning and Necessity, 2nd en!. ed., The University 
of Chicago Press, 1956, 3rd chap. 
17 G. Frege, 'Dber Sinn and Bedeutung', Zeitschrift.fUr Philosophie und philosophische 
Kritik 100 (1892) 25-50; R. Carnap, op. cit., 2nd chap. Ingarden could dismiss Carnap's 
distinctions as holding only in a formalized (syntactically and semantically constructed) 
language; while, he, Ingarden, is concerned with an ordinary, everyday language, partic-
ularly the language of a work of art. Frege, however, analyzed and gave examples from 
an ordinary German, only aiming at the clarification and idealization of language, es-
pecially the language of mathematics. 
18 Literary Work, par. 18, especially pp. 96-97; a critique of the Logical Investigations 
period of Husserl. 
19 G. Kling regards such a decision as a metaphysical issue, distinguishing it from the 
ontological question of the constitution of the intentional object by virtue of the corre-
sponding linguistic meaning; see his 'Ingarden on Language and Ontology', p. 21Of. 
20 In the logical theory of language, the emphasis on human agent as a manipulator with 
linguistic meaning and linguistic entities in general, points toward the establishment of 
logical pragmatics. Logical pragmatics, as viewed by R. Carnap, R. M. Martin or R. 
Montague, is not a branch of psychology of language, although the psychological aspects 
of using a language in a speaker-hearer relation may be incorporated in it as a legitimate 
subject matter of investigations.

22 Op. cit., par. 11, p. 46. 
23 Op. cit., par. 9, p. 35. 
24 The word sound ('Wort/aut'), or, as G. Kling suggests, phonemic structure of a word, 
as opposed to the mere physical sound, concrete phonic material ('Lautmaterial'), is the 
type-bearer of its corresponding meaning. By virtue of a conventional correspondence 
between the word sound and its meaning, the hearer's attention should be oriented to-
ward the meaning (and thus to the intentional object). Ingarden contends that the meaning 
cannot exist without its word sound. Does it, however, mean that each and every nominal 
component of meaning must have its word sound? 
25 Literary Work, par. 15a, p. 67. 
26 C. I. Lewis' theory of meaning, as exposed in his 'The Modes of Meaning', in L. Linsky 
(ed.), Semantics and the Philosophy of Language, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Ill., 
1952, pp. 50--63, comes to mind. Lewis' prodigal use of four aspects of meaning was crit-
icized by A. Church in Journal of Symbolic Logic 9 (1944) 28-29. A similar criticism could 
be applied against Ingarden's theory. 
27 Since the nature of the present paper does not allow for the treatment of all these issues, 
we can only refer to pertaining bibliographical sources. 
28 In a formalized language, this would amount to using no formulae of predicate logic, 
unless these are preceded by, say, a lambda operator or Russell's symbol for 'all such 
entities which .. .'. Such famous devices turn an expression of sentence-category into an 
expression of term-category. 
29 It would be interesting to carefully compare Ingarden's position with 'reism' or 'som-
atism' of T. Kotarbiilski. Obviously, Ingarden could not share Kotarbiilski's materialism, 
and criticizes heavily Kotarbiilski's position for various other reasons. See Z teoriijezyka ... ,

'0 istnieniu i strukturze dziela literackiego', Studia Filozojiczne, 1958, no. 3, pp. 121-164. 
30 Functors fulfill various functions in the linguistic context. Ingarden divides functors 
into: (a) purely functional: 'and', 'thus', 'since', 'however'; (b) materially functional: 'be-. 
hind', 'afterwards', 'beside', etc. The latter, as, e.g., in the context 'a chair beside the table', 
possess a material content too, codetermined by the contents of the words 'chair' and 
'table'. 
31 Literary Work, par. 22, p. 143. 
32 Problems or questions were studied by Ingarden in 'Essentiale Fragen'; see below, 
notes 45-48. 
33 Literary Work, par. 25 and 26. 
34 He admits briefly that the word 'truth' could mean, among other things, 'the purely 
intentional correlate of a true judicative proposition' (Literary Work, par. 52, p. 301), but 
not in a literary work of art. Various concepts of truth were analyzed by him in 'Des 
differentes conceptions de la verite dans l'art', Revue d'esthetique, II no. 2 (Paris, 1950), 
pp. 162-180. See also his Polish articles in Studia z estetyki I (PWN, Warszawa, 1966), 
pp. 395-464. 
35 Ingarden did not elaborate a semantic theory of compound sentences in the style of 
Frege. Whereas Frege in 'aber Sinn und Bedeutung' carefully studied dependent clauses, 
Ingarden explored complexes of sentences which have something in common (e.g., the 
same subject). See Literary Work, par. 23, 24. 
36 Literary Work, par. 20, p. 119. 
37 See his important formulations in Literary Work, par. 24, p. 157; particularly: "the 
ontic range of an object reaches precisely as far as the total manifold of the states of affairs 
that 'refer' exclusively to it." 
38 R. Camap, op. cit., p. 222ff. 
39 It is a pity that Ingarden was not more concerned with the category of relation, though 
he recognized its importance in the time of Peirce, Russell, Whitehead, and others. Like-
wise, the category of action is treated by him in merely an intuitive way, lacking the analytic 
precision of some contemporary writers on this theme. Let us mention the contributions 
of D. Davidson, G. von Wright, A. Goldmann, and others. 
40 This theory is recognized by Ingarden as an important contribution which has not, 
however, solved the main problems: see '0 sqdzie warunkowym' (On hypothetical prop-
osition), in Z teorii j({Zyka ... , p. 304, also p. 239. Ingarden complains that the Polish lo-
gicians expressed no interest in par. 22,25 and 26 of Literary Work, where his conception 
of truth is exposed. 
41 In the Polish literature, Frege's influence seems to be less strong than in the Anglo-
Saxon philosophy of language. It may be due to the prevalence of the Brentano-Twardowski 
line, continued by Lesniewski, Ajdukiewicz, Kotarbiitski, Tarski, etc. J. Pelc, ed., Semio-
tyka Polska 1894-1969 (PWN, Warszawa, 1971) is a good, representative anthology that 
demonstrates the above claim. Ingarden, as a Husserlian, has not been included. 
42 In spite of the attempts to establish so-called non-Fregean denotata of sentences, truth-
values as denotata of sentences have entertained a victorious entry into the semantic 
battlefield. They are simple, unburdened by the compound structure of a state of affairs, 
and do their job efficiently. 
43 When Ingarden wrote his lectures 'Analiza zdania warunkowego' Analysis of a hypo-
thetical sentence) (1935) and 'Zagadnienie budowy sqdu warunkowego' (The question of 
the structure of a hypothetical proposition) (1936), only strict implication of C. I. Lewis 
had challenged the all-embracing power of material implication (as the standard 'if..., 

LANGUAGE AND LOGIC IN THE WORK OF INGARDEN 
217 
then ---' truth-functional connective which is false only if the antecedent is true and the 
consequent false). Ingarden was familiar with the notion of strict implication. Obviously, 
'strenge Implikation' ofW. Ackermann (1956) and 'relevant implication' of A. R. Anderson 
and N. D. Belnap (developed in the early sixties) are much later products of a similar and 
highly technical tendency to successfully replace the too liberal material implication by a 
more suitable candidate. The German version - out of which the paper 'The Hypothetical 
Proposition', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 18 (1957-58), was made - was 
prepared in 1956, but from the old sources. Zee Z teoriijf{Zyka ... , pp. 260--325; especially

specialist in the field. In his essay, 'Przegl~d niektorych zagadnien logiki pytan' (A review 
of some problems of the logic of questions), Studia Logica XVIII (1966) 105-131, Kubinski 
explicitly gives credit to Ingarden and states that "a detailed analysis of the logic of ques-
tions contained in Essentiale Fragen is an interesting task facing a historian of Polish logic 
in the period between the wars" (p. 109). He also stresses that K. Ajdukiewicz devoted 
six pages in Logiczne podstawy nauczania (Logical foundations of teaching) (1934) to the 
theory of questions - nine years after the appearance of Essentiale Fragen. Yet, it is also 
true that Ajdukiewicz was concerned with questions much earlier; see the abstract of his 
lecture, '0 intencji pytania "co to jest P''' (On the intention of the question 'What is P' ?),

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MATHEMATICS 
ABsTRAcr. At the beginning of the present century a series of beautiful but threatening 
paradoxes were discovered within mathematics, paradoxes which suggested a fundamental 
unclarity in traditional mathematical methods. These methods rested on the assumption 
of a realm of mathematical idealities existing independently of our thinking activity, and 
in order to arrive at a firmly-grounded mathematics different attempts were made to for-
mulate a conception of mathematical objects as purely human constructions. It was, how-
ever, realised that such formulations necessarily result in a mathematics which lacks the 
richness and power of the old "platonistic" methods, and the latter are still defended, in 
various modified forms, as embodying truths about self-existent mathematical entities. 
Thus there is an idealism-realism dispute in the philosophy of mathematics in some respects 
parallel to the controversy over the existence of the experiential world to the settlement of 
which Ingarden devoted his life. The present paper is an attempt to apply Ingarden's 
methods to the sphere of mathematical existence. This exercise will reveal new modes of 
being applicable to non-real objects, and we shall put forward arguments to suggest that 
these modes of being have an importance outside mathematics, especially in the areas of 
value theory and the ontology of Art. 
1. TOWARDS A PHENOMENOLOGICAL ONTOLOGY 
OF MA THEMA TICS 
According to their reaction to the mathematical paradoxes philosophers 
of mathematics divided themselves into several conflicting 'schools'; 
each school based itself on one or other dogmatic notion of what is 
truly given in mathematics, and then attempted to derive the whole of. 
pre-established mathematics from this.given core, or to 'salvage' as much 
as was possible, dismissing what could not be absorbed as the result of 
unclear mathematical thinking. Some groups of philosophers even found 
themselves committed to a programme for the creation of a completely 
new mathematics, since they dismissed all that had gone before as 
through and through unacceptable; hence there arose radically alter-
native universes of mathematical objects, in conflict with the universe of 
'standard'mathematics. 
A phenomenological philosophy of mathematics would not, of course, 
seek to become just one further school with its own particular notion of 
what is given and its own particular methods of derivation. It is the es-

BARRY SMITH 
sence of phenomenology to be open to all modes of givenness, and hence 
it must somehow enable the development of an all-embracing account 
of mathematics. With respect to this account each dogmatic school will 
're-appear' as a special case resulting when we adopt a particular 'adum-
brative' attitude with regard to the totality of mathematically given data. 
A phenomenological philosophy must recognise, in particular, that every 
species of mathematical object, whatever its mode of givenness in actual 
mathematical practice, has its own determinate mode of existence (this 
being true even in the case of objects postulated by mathematical works 
subsequently proved inconsistent). Hence the phenomenologist's uni-
verse of mathematical objects must be all-inclusive. With respect to this 
universe each particular school of mathematical activity is seen as having 
an effective commitment only to one or other possible 'sub-universe'. 
In his masterpiece on The Controversy about the Existence of the World! 
Ingarden has provided us with a framework within which this all-em-
bracing philosophy of mathematics can be developed at the level of a 
sophisticated ontology. Ingarden's phenomenological analyses of what 
is involved in the givenness to consciousness of objects possessing the 
various different modes of being, reveal the presence of 'existential mo-
ments'. In virtue of its possession of a particular combination of exis-
tential moments an object is distinguished as having real being, ideal 
being, intentional being, and so on. For example, if we confine ourselves 
to candidate real objects, we can say that what distinguishes a given real 
apple from a merely thought or intended apple is the moment of self-
existence possessed by the former; the latter exists as a mere fiction, 
having no immanent qualities and no being-status of its own, for it is 
existentially 'dependent' upon the given intention, with the retraction of 
which it ceases to have any existence. What is involved here is a dichotomy 
between 'autonomous' and dependent or 'heteronomous' objects, and 
this is the first pair of existential moments distinguished by Ingarden. 2 
The second pair concerns the existential 'source' of an object. For ex-
ample, if we consider a block of stone out of which a sculptor intends 
to create a particular statue, the virgin block is given as having an exis-
tential source which is extrinsic to the sculptor, but this is not the case 
with regard to the finished statue. We say that the block has the moment 
of existential 'originality' relative to the sculptor whilst the statue has 
the opposite moment of existential 'derivation'. That we can distinguish 

HISTORICITY, VALVE AND MA THEMA TICS 
221 
this notion of relative originality implies the possibility of an absolutely 
original being, i.e. a being which owed its existence to no other object or 
objects. Such a being would be primordial and permanent, containing 
within itself the guarantee of its own existence. Developed religions award 
this sort of absolutely original status to God, and Ingarden notes 3 that 
dialectical materialism attributes the same status to matter. 
Ingarden's philosophy of the real world consists in the systematic in-
vestigation of all possible interrelations of these and other moments dis-
tinguished as applicable to reality as a whole and to the monad of pure 
consciousness in which this reality has its reflection, in such a way that 
we shall be able to determine once and for all and without prejudice the 
nature of the relation of dependence which holds between the two. Many 
emptily possible combinations of moments fall away as incoherent or in 
conflict with the results of 'formal' and 'material' ontology, and In-
garden's arguments demonstrate that only those combinations which 
survive exhaustive phenomenological analyses are possible 'solutions' to 
the problem of the existence of the world. But the 'impossible solutions' 
continue to have a role to playas indices of the different more or less 
dogmatic attitudes which it is possible to take up with regard to this 
controversy, amongst which are, for example, absolute realism and 
Husserlian subjective idealism. Each such attitude corresponds, on this 
level of generality, to one or other possible manner of reflectively in-
habiting the real world.4 We can now proceed to develop our 'all-em-
bracing' philosophy of mathematics by carrying out for the universe of 
mathematical objects just that exposure of all the different possible com-
binations of relevant existential moments which Ingarden carried out for 
the real world in its relation to pure consciousness. 
2. MATHEMATICAL EXISTENCE 
There is an important difference between the real world and the universe 
of mathematical objects. The former is homogeneous, its objects all 
possess the same (real) mode of being, whilst the world of mathematical 
objects seems to admit certain modal partitions. The mode of existence 
appropriate to the natural numbers, for example, does not seem to be 
appropriate to transfinite (ordinal and cardinal) numbers. In general, as 
we leave the 'central core' of standard mathematics (finite number theory, 

222 
BARRY SMITH 
Euclidean geometry, etc.) we seem to encounter changes in the mode of 
givenness of the objects with which we deal, and these changes can have 
a correlate ontological significance. Hence an adequate phenomenology 
of mathematics must refrain from prejudgments to the effect that the 
mathematical world be considered as an ontologically homogeneous 
whole. At this stage, in fact, we must recognise the existence not only of 
objects (such as 1, 2, 3) which are directly given as possessing the mo-
ments of autonomy and originality, but also of objects (such as i, j, k 
within Hamilton's theory of quatemions) which are given as enjoying a 
merely heteronomous, derivative existence. This implies at least a dualist 
ontology, i.e. one which distinguishes two (possibly empty) object-regions 
as follows: 
autonomy 
originality 
heteronomy 
derivation. 
However there seems to be no a priori reason why the limit of existential 
originality should coincide in the mathematical universe with the limit 
of heteronomy; thus the moment-combinations: 
autonomy 
derivation 
and 
heteronomy 
originality 
present themselves as corresponding to possible being-modes for math-
ematical objects. Plausible cases of the former would be arithmetical 
fractions (t, i-, t, etc.) which are given as enjoying an autonomous ex-
istence alongside the natural numbers, but which are also given as non-
original since they owe the source of their existence to the discovery of 
an adequate conception of them as ordered pairs of natural numbers, 
corresponding to the discovery of an adequate method of representation. 
The moment-combination 
heteronomy 
originality 
is, however, dismissed by Ingarden as impossible.5 This is because the 
dependence of heteronomous objects upon intentional acts implies that 
such objects cannot possess the moment of originality relative to con-
sciousness. Nevertheless certain philosophers of mathematics have at-

HISTORICITY , VALUE AND MA THEMA TICS 
223 
tempted to affirm that mathematical objects possess this sort of being-
status. Such philosophers believe that mathematical objects enjoy a 
merely fictional existence, but they wish to stress a distinction between 
"natural" fictions and those which are in some sense arbitrary and con-
trived. Here they point to the difference in creative freedom which is 
experienced between e.g. writing a novel and developing an extension of 
standard mathematical set theory. 6 This doctrine of "objectivism without 
objects" 7 can be accounted for within our framework by exploiting a 
distinction, recognised by Ingarden 8, between the existential 'founda-
tion', the existential 'source' and the existential 'basis' of an object. The 
autonomy/heteronomy opposition depends upon the existential founda-
tion of an object, i.e. upon the manner in which it is maintained in ex-
istence, an autonomous object being one which 'founds' itself. Similarly 
the moment-pair originality/derivation is a matter of existential source. 
Existential basis is explained as follows: 9 "something which has its own 
existential basis in itself is as if it could afford to be founded in itself," 
i.e. the object is, although heteronomous, in some sense intrinsically 
stable and self-contained. Such an object is, we shall say, existentially 
'self-basic', and we shall introduce the dichotomy: 'self-basis'/,artifici-
ality' as a new pair of existential moments. 10 
This means that our ontology of mathematics now embraces a four-
region universe of objects as follows:

A central core of ideal and eternal mathematical objects is surrounded 
by a sphere of autonomous derived objects brought into being from out 
of the central core, effectively by way of adequate definitions. More or 
less fragmentarily attached to these internal spheres are regions of het-
eronomous objects, some of which are given as intrinsically stable, whilst 
others are given as artificial inventions brought into being for particular 
mathematical purposes. The remotest of these heteronomous regions 
give way to an empty nothingness, i.e. to that area which has not yet 
been conquered by mathematicians in the sense of being made accessible 
to 'concretisation,l1 via chains of definitions and proofs.

3. TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHIES OF MATHEMATICS 
Traditional schools of mathematical thought, platonism, intuitionism, 
formalism, psychologism, etc. are included as special cases within our 
phenomenological philosophy in the same way that traditional positions 
with respect to the idealism-realism dispute were included in the meta-
philosophy which Ingarden puts forward in The Controversy about the 
Existence of the World. Each traditional conception of the universe of 
mathematical objects can be correlated with one of the (at this stage, 
fifteen) emptily possible specialisations of the four region ontology which 
we have outlined above: four one-region ontologies (monisms), six du-
alisms, four troilisms and a single four-region ontology.12 We must also 
recall that within the different adumbrative attitudes which correspond 
to each of the traditional schools, the mathematical universe which re-
sults appears truncated when compared to the all-inclusive mathematical 
universe which is embraced on the level of phenomenological reflection. 
For example, 'platonists' do not recognise as existent what they regard 
as "unacceptable" intuitionistic objects, and the same holds in general 
for each school with regard to the objects of those schools with which 
it is in conflict. At this level of investigation the precise nature of each 
such 'truncation' can be only emptily indicated, sub-universes being 
'small' or 'large' according to the relative extent of their commitment; 
further determinations must await the analyses of a 'material ontology' 
of mathematics. 13 
Monistic philosophies of mathematics (one-region ontologies) 'impose' 
a single mode of being throughout their mathematical universe. Such 
philosophies fall into four categories corresponding to the four possible 
moment-combinations so far distinguished. 
(i) 
autonomy 
originality. 
Corresponding to platonistic philosophies of mathematics this category 
implies the affirmation that all mathematical objects are ideal and eter-
nal, discovered and not invented, transcendent entities. Where our actual 
congress with mathematical objects leads us to question the ideal, eternal 
existence of mathematical objects which this doctrine implies - perhaps 

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MATHEMATICS 
225 
because particular objects appear to have been brought into being by cre-
ative mathematical activity - platonists argue that this appearance is 
merely the result of an epistemological inadequacy on our part; this sort 
of difference in mode of givenness corresponds, they claim, to nothing 
on the side of the object itself. In general platonist philosophies allow 
for the existence of 'large' mathematical universes since the self-existence 
of mathematical objects implies that the mathematician has at his dis-
posal powerful methods, such as the law of excluded middle and the 
method of impredicative definition, which are unavailable when objects 
are conceived as merely human creations. Platonism is not, however, 
incompatible with a restricted mathematical universe. Pythagoreanism, 
for example, holds that only finite numbers and possibly sets exist in the 
required platonistic sense and that other candidate mathematical objects 
do not exist in any sense. 
(ii) 
autonomy 
derivation. 
Many philosophers of mathematics have held that mathematical objects 
are autonomous but that they owe the source of their existence to some 
realm of being extrinsic to mathematics. The logicism of Frege and 
Russell, for example, holds that mathematics is reducible to logic, and 
this seems to amount, in our terminology, to the characterization of 
mathematical objects as derived from purely logical objects. Materialist 
philosophy of mathematics, on the other hand, argues that material ob-
jects constitute the sphere of (relative) originality from which mathe-
matical objects are derived. 14 Finally we can consider those varieties of 
formalism which hold, in effect, that the status of mathematical objects 
is derivative from that of concrete configurations of 'meaningless' math-
ematical symbols.

The intuitionism of Brouwer and the Dutch school requires mathemat-
ical objects to be constructible in an ideally conceived sequence of 

226 
BARRY SMITH 
mental acts or "intuitions" occurring at discrete quasi-temporal inter-
vals by analogy with acts of counting out loud. 15 In comparison with 
platonist mathematics this results in a 'small' mathematical universe. 
Intuitionism amounts to a commitment to mathematical objects as het-
eronomous ('mental mathematical constructions') and as derivative, 
having the source of their existence in the ideally conceived mathemat-
ical intuition. The intuitionists also clearly believe that their construc-
tions possess the moment of existential self-basis; they claim that the 
mathematics which results from their programme reveals 'mental archi-
tecture' with an intrinsic value of its own "which it is difficult to define 
beforehand, but which is clearly felt in dealing with the matter," 16 i.e. 
in actually engaging in intuitionistic mathematics. This claim also finds 
some extrinsic support in the fact that intuitionistic logic (a logic within 
which it is impossible to derive, for example, the laws of excluded middle 
and of double negation) has been shown to have an elegant and 'natural' 
formalisation. 17

The final type of monistic ontology corresponds to the commitment 
which is implicit in the statements of those who see mathematics as a 
matter of arbitrary human conventions, an 'anthropological phenom-
enon' 18 with regard to which we are free at every stage. 19 
Having considered each of the four possible species of mathematical 
monism we shall have space here, with regard to the six possible dualisms, 
to mention only two particular cases which have played an important 
role within the tradition.

Weak realism consists in a commitment to the existence of only 'some' 
mathematical objects as independent of our thought activity.20 The re-
maining, derived objects in the mathematical universe exist as mere 
fictions. For example, Kronecker's statement "God made the natural

ment of the (relative) originality of the natural numbers and of the het-
eronomous and artificial derivation of all other mathematical objects.

The dualist formalism of Hilbert 21 consists in the argument that whilst 
all mathematical objects enjoy a merely derivative existence relative to 
certain configurations of mathematical symbolism (formal systems), 
nevertheless we must distinguish in our derived universe between Real-
elemente which are purely finitistic mathematical objects, and peripheral 
Idealelemente, the latter being purely instrumental aids to the smoother 
achievement of mathematical results, which have meaning only in so far 
as they concern Realelemente. Hilbert would admit only those Ideal-
elemente which -were 'self-basic' in the sense that he wished to restrict 
admissable 'instrumental aids' to those whose underlying formal system 
had been proved consistent using purely finitistic methods. Godel's in-
completeness theorem showed however that the carrying out of this 
programme was an impossible task, and this might be taken as suggesting 
that for a sufficiently powerful mathematics non-self-basic objects can 
never be excluded. 22 
4. HISTORICITY 
The existential moment of 'actuality' concerns the concrete temporal 
presence of an object in the full totality of its being, the dichotomy 
actuality/non-actuality is then conceived as embodying the phenom-
enological content of the scholastic opposition between objects which 
exist and those which merely pertain or subsist. We can now represent 
the four modes of being distinguished by Ingarden as follows: 
A. 
B. 
Absolute (Timeless) Being 
of, for example, God. 
Ideal (Extratemporal) Being. 
autonomy 
originality

In the present paper we are concerned with non-actual objects, i.e. with 
modes Band D; but our consideration of mathematical existence has 
revealed the importance of distinguishing modes of being 'between' the 
two extremes of ideal and purely intentional being which Ingarden, with 
some reservations,25 put forward as together exhausting the sphere of 
the non-actual. 
The intervening modes belong to eidos which do not have the existen-
tial permanence and primordiality of Ingarden's pure idealities; they 
possess a factor of historicity in their being and not merely at the level 
of our knowledge of them as is the case with true idealities. Arising at 
determinate points in time our 'historical' eidos can undergo specific 
types of evolutionary development and they can also, in some cases, be 
destroyed. We can represent the situation as follows: 
Purely Ideal Being 
(Extratemporal). 
Derived Ideal Being 
of autonomous historical eidos 
Stable Intentional Being 
of heteronomous historical eidos 
Unstable (Purely) Intentional Being

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MATHEMATICS 
229 
The recognition of dimensions of historical eidos alongside the realm 
of purely ideal being does not effect the validity of Ingarden's argu-
ments 26 that only the existence of purely ideal concepts and essences 
can account for the intersubjective identity and individuality of inten-
tional objectivities and in particular, for example, of linguistic meanings. 
Indeed, since the constitution of historical eidos is itself effected only 
through intentional objectivities of this kind it follows that the eidos 
themselves depend for their existence upon that of pure idealities. Thus 
commitment to historical eidos is not an 'alternative' to platonism, and 
this is the root of the failure of HusserI's attempts 27 to produce a con-
stitutive phenomenology of eidetic experience without resort to platonic 
entities of any kind. The nature of HusserI's failure is interestingly re-
vealed by a consideration of the philosophy of mathematics which is 
implicit in HusserI's idealism. The works of Becker 28 and Kaufmann 29 
can be interpreted as demonstrating that a truly 'HusserIian' mathemat-
ics would be a counterpart of Brouwerian intuitionism; in particular it 
would have a 'small' universe within which uncountably infinite math-
ematical objects would be unattainable. 30 Gadamer 31 has expressed the 
Ingardenian, realist argument that "mathematical objects cannot be 
conceived as the result of human activity, that enumerating is not the 
origin of number. It seems impossible to admit that all logical and math-
ematical entities would depend upon the interrelations among meanings" 
as is implied by the idealism of HusserI for which "the transcendental 
ego has no ontological but only a rational claim." 32 
HusserIian mathematical philosophy is therefore seen to be inade-
quate,33 however Ingarden's over-sharp formulation ofa dichotomy be-
tween purely ideal and purely intentional being seems to commit him 
to an equally inadequate monistic platonism. In the next section an at-
tempt is made to develop a via media between the two. 
5. CONTENTUAL MATHEMATICS 
The bringing into being of a derived mathematical object is a double 
achievement of consciousness. The mathematician must first form a con-
ception of the given object, and he must then find a way of communi-
cating his conception. This communication can be achieved only through 
the medium of a pre-understood mathematical language whose 'nominal 

230 
BARRY SMITH 
meanings' 34 have determined references to pre-given mathematical ob-
jects (ultimately the latter must be autonomous individuals of the central 
directly-given mathematical core). The mathematician must contrive to 
order his symbols in such a way that the intention to these pre-given 
references can be effected only 'through' an intervening noematic layer 
of 'higher-order' objects (within which in particular his own newly-
created object finds its place), just as the word and sentence-meanings 
are determinately ordered within a literary work in such a way that they 
can be properly understood only when intention of them results in the 
constitution of a (noematic) stratum of objects 'represented' within the 
work.35 A 'concretisable' ordering of mathematical symbols constitutes 
a mathematical work; the publication of such a work endows the objects 
represented within it with a truly objective (intersubjectively identifiable 
and freely accessible) existence. 36 
A derived mathematical object, once brought into being by a mathe-
matical work, is either autonomous or heteronomous depending upon 
the manner in which it is maintained in existence. In the former case the 
object is such that, to a consciousness which has adequately concretised 
the defining work, it is thereafter given as purely ideal, i.e. it comes to 
have the same direct mode of givenness as the central core mathematical 
objects. Therefore there is a sense in which, once concretised, derived 
autonomous objects do not require mathematicians' conscious activity 
to maintain them in existence; they fall into the passive, received dimen-
sion in such a way that their existence cannot be brought into question. 
(A possible quasi-platonist 'solution' to the problem of the existence of 
the mathematical world would consist in a demonstration that all math-
ematical objects can receive a representation in a mathematical work 
which is concretisable in such a way that its objects come to be endowed 
with this direct mode of givenness.) 
In the case where a derived mathematical object is given as heteron-
omous, however, this is beca~se the chain of definitions and proofs 
which must be followed if we are to achieve an adequate concretisation 
of the appropriate mathematical work and therefore also of its higher 
object stratum, does not have the required 'inexorability'. The created 
object, if concretised at all, does not in any case achieve direct givenness 
and thus it continues to depend for its existence upon the activity of 
mathematicians in bringing to life the noematic layer in which it rests. 

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MA THEMA TICS 
231 
Such an object is said to require a double existential foundation, (i) in 
the transcendent structure which is the mathematical work 37 and (ii) in 
the acts of consciousness of those who successfully concretise this work. 
In order to remain in existence, therefore, a created object relies upon 
there being some 'justification' for the continued concretisation of its 
defining work; otherwise it 'sinks and fades into oblivion'.38 In the case 
where this justification is fully intrinsic to the work (is a matter of aes-
thetics) we say that the object is self-basic; otherwise, e.g. where there is 
a merely pragmatic justification for the concretisation of the work, the 
object has the moment of artificiality. 
In the case of heteronomous derived objects we can never attain a 
direct mode of givenness of the object itself; all we can ever achieve is 
a 'frail' concretisation of the noematic layer of its defining work. In his 
investigation of the concretisation of literary works 39 Ingarden shows 
that there are manifold differences between concretisations effected by 
different individuals at different times, and that these differences can 
endow the work with a sort of 'life'. This applies also to mathematical 
works, in particular to 'creative' mathematical works, i.e. those which 
effect the ontogenesis of heteronomous mathematical objects.40 As In-
garden points out, "one can speak of the 'life' of a work in a two-fold 
and, in both cases, figurative sense: (1) the work 'lives' while it is ex-
pressed in a manifold of concretisations; (2) the work 'lives' while it 
undergoes changes as a result of ever new concretisations formed by 
conscious subjects." 41 These latter changes in 'the work itself' need not 
involve actual alterations in the text of the work, (although important 
hidden features of a mathematical work, brought to the surface in con-
cretisations, may be incorporated in successive editions); a creative math-
ematical work can evolve 'in itself' also imperceptibly, as the concretisa-
tion-possibility of the identical work changes from one generation of 
mathematicians to the next. A given mathematical community in its 
simple apprehension of the work is not conscious of the fortuitousness 
of an 'accepted' concretisation of the work, nor is it aware "of those 
points in which it materially and necessarily differs from the work, nor, 
finally, of the concretisation as something to be contrasted to the work 
itself." 42 As a result the mathematical community "absolutises the given 
concretisation, identifies it with the work, and in a naive way directs 
itself intentionally to the work thus intended. Everything that pertains 

232 
BARRY SMITH 
to the content of the given concretisation is then ascribed to the work" 43 
- and becomes further absolutised e.g. in the mathematical text-books 
produced by the given mathematical community. The 'material points 
of difference' between a concretisation and the transcendent identical 
structure which is the work itself hinge on the fact that the creative math-
ematical work is, like the work of literature, a 'schematic formation'; 44 
it possesses 'loci of indeterminacy' some of which must be 'filled in' with 
alien contents imported by consciousness in its efforts to concretise the 
given work.45 Only in virtue of such an importation can the noematic 
layer 'held in readiness' within the work be brought to actualisation.46 
The mode of existence of created and heteronomous mathematical ob-
jects as schematic then has important mathematical consequences, for 
loci of indeterminacy conceal potential mathematical ambiguities which 
can be drawn out in subsequent mathematical research; indeterminacy 
can, most especially, conceal the fact that the work is inconsistent. This 
implies a certain 'provisionality' with regard to every created mathemat-
ical object as intended within a given absolutised concretisation (pro-
visionality is in fact an existential moment of such objects, parallel to 
the moment of fragility which is possessed by real objects). The presence 
of this moment follows from the fact that candidate properties of het-
eronomous objects revealed in new concretisations are always dependent 
for their acceptance upon particular historical reactions of the mathe-
matical community. Some of these different possible reactions lead to 
the effective destruction of one region of objects in the mathematical 
universe in favour of new regions embodying more subtle distinctions 
and having a more determinate concretisability. Lakatos47 has ably 
characterised all the different types of such reaction and has emphasised 
that their co-existence makes of creative mathematics a 'dynamic de-
velopment'. For him however this 'development' signifies the evolution 
of conflicting linguistic frameworks 48 having no ontological significance. 
Lakatos fails to recognise that language forms merely one existential 
foundation of mathematics, and therefore that adequate concretisation 
of mathematical language depends upon the constitution by conscious-
ness of sui generis mathematical objects. The difficulty has been to re-
concile the ontological aspect of mathematics with its 'heuristic' char-
acter as revealed by Lakatos. It is the argument of the present paper that 
such a reconciliation, leading to a truly contentual (inhaltliche) mathe-

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MATHEMATICS 
233 
matics can be effected by exploiting the notion of historical eidos; but 
if historical eidos are objects which come into being merely as a result 
of our mathematical activity then such a conception might make of cre-
ative mathematics nothing more than a gratuitous game or ritual 49 with, 
at best, a merely pragmatic value. In particular we can ask how this 
'activity' can be a matter of reason when, just as is the case with regard 
to literary creative activity, there is no suggestion of a pre-existent domain 
against which our 'results' can be tested. Its rationality, we suggest, con-
sists in the fact that the intentional objects which it brings into existence 
must be 'stable' entities with respect to which thought as such finds itself 
particularly 'at home'. Such intentional eidos are not, like Ingarden's 
purely intentional objects, confined to the noematic layer of one partic-
ular work as this receives its manifold of concretisations,50 for their 
being is such that they can float free and play a part in other areas of 
mathematics and within new creative mathematical works. 
This mode of being is not confined to the objects of creative mathe-
matics, we can distinguish other areas in which stable intentional eidos 
are brought into being and with regard to the totality of all such eidos it 
might be appropriate to develop a theory of 'intellectual aesthetics' 51 
whose role would be as necessary supplement to direct Wesensschau in 
the laying bare of the eidetic universe. As applied, in particular, to math-
ematics such a theory would make explicit those evaluative criteria and 
objectives which are at present only unreflectively and unsystematically 
brought to bear in actual mathematical practice. It is these criteria and 
objectives which, stumblingly, and via the continual excision of false-
starts under the pressure of criticism, lead to the constitution of stable 
intentional eidos and to the growth of the mathematical universe which 
they co-constitute. 
6. ART, VALUES, AND ONTOLOGY 
Ingarden developed a full and adequate conception of the 'purely in-
tentional object' through his investigation of the work of literature, and 
the question can be raised whether the conception thus developed can 
be applied indiscriminately to all areas of intentional being as Ingarden 
assumed. For him a purely intentional object is not a 'genuine creation' 
but rather a case of arbitrary properties being merely 'assigned' to an 

234 
BARRY SMITH 
illusory correlate of particular intentional acts. 52 This mode of existence 
is certainly appropriate to, say, the characters of a minor novel; for here 
we do have nothing other than illusory nuclei to which determinate 
properties are assigned by the given work and whose existence consists 
purely in their being intended within adequate concretisations of the 
work. But the arbitrariness of this kind of 'assignation' of properties 
does not seem to be present in all aesthetic objects. 53 There are different 
'degrees' of arbitrariness, encapsulated in our notion of the (relative) 
existential self-basis of an object. As we distinguished stable created 
mathematical eidos which "float free from their defining work," so we 
must recognise the existence of self-basic literary eidos, particular char-
acters, atmospheres, 'metaphysical qualities', 54 etc., which are so con-
stituted that they survive, historically, to enjoy a stable (although het-
eronomous) existence independently of the work which brought them 
into being. Hamlet, for example, enjoys the moment of existential self-
basis relative to what we might call the post-Shakespearean conscious-
ness; he has become an eidetic component in our thinking.55 
Art in general and literature in particular thus have the function of 
creating stable experiential eidos. A similar function is attributed, e.g. 
by Grabau,56 to works of existential philosophy such as, for example, 
Heidegger's Sein und Zeit. Grabau criticises Heidegger's conception of 
this work as revealing purely ideal structures which are "conditions for 
the possibility of experience as such." Grabau argues, in effect, that all 
such 'experiential universals' are created intentional eidos. Thus he com-
pares Heidegger's notion of Sein zwn Tode with William James' con-
ception of a 'moral equivalent of war', claiming that both are invented 
constructs "in terms of which energies which could find other discharges 
... are organised and given direction." 57 If "to view one's life under the 
construct of Heidegger's theory of death perhaps lifts it from the level 
of the chaotic to that of the significant," 58 then we would argue that 
such would be the case for those relative to whom the corresponding 
experiential eidos possessed the existential moment of self-basis. 
Such 'experiential' historical eidos effectively 'mediate' between the 
realm of human experience and the realm of purely ideal concepts and 
essences in that it is the existence of pure idealities which give an inter-
subjective meaning to those e.g. aesthetic and philosophic works through 
which we can concretise particular historical eidos. 

HISTORICITY, VALUE AND MATHEMATICS 
235 
Commitment to a dimension of mediating historical eidos can also 
'reconcile' a platonistic conception of the value-pantheon 59 with the 
dominion of different and sometimes conflicting systems of value-eidos 
over different civilisations. A derived, heteronomous system of value-
eidos is adopted by a given civilisation should a stage arise in its moral 
development when the eidos-system has acquired the moment of exis-
tential self-basis relative to the civilisation as a whole. The given histor-
ical value-eidos then derive not only their intersubjective meaning but 
also their peculiar subjective imperativity from purely ideal and extra-
temporal values-in-themselves. The value-eidos can become concretised 
by consciousness only when an intention of them is effected 'through 
the noematic layer' which they co-constitute and 'onto' self-existent 
values-in-themselves; 60 consciousness is thus able to adequately con-
cretise historical value-eidos only to the extent that it understands such 
eidos in the guise of transcendent values-in-themselves. 
Autonomous non-actual entities, both purely ideal concepts and es-
sences and derived autonomous historical eidos, have a peculiar 'pos-
tulational' mode of givenness. This depends on the fact that stable in-
tentional eidos, in particular linguistic meanings and value-eidos, etc., 
depend for their intersubjective existence upon an existential foundation 
in the realm of autonomous idealities. But pure idealities themselves 
"never achieve genuine realisation at all." 61 Consciousness "can produce 
only actualisations of ideal meaning contents of concepts and form them 
into new wholes," 62 into, e.g., meaning-contents of sentences and into 
historical eidos generally. This negative non-immediate mode of given-
ness is clearly 'inferior' as compared with immediate given ness of objects 
of perception, memory, imagination, etc., and phenomenologists have 
justifiably wished to account for all experience in terms of the latter, to 
'reduce' all ideal being to the level of the immediately given, i.e. to the 
level of the Lebenswelt. 63 We hope that our investigation of mathemat-
ical existence and our brief remarks on art and value theory have sug-
gested the need for an alternative to reductive phenomenology of eidetic 
experience; we also hope that this suggestion is within the spirit of In-
garden's philosophy.

10 In section 6 below we shall make explicit the distinction between relative and absolute 
existential self-basis. In the context of mathematics self-basis or stability is a moment 
possessed by objects relative to particular 'mathematical communities'. This concept of 
mathematical community requires its own phenomenological explication for which Hus-
serl's analyses of intersubjectivity in general provide a starting point. 
11 The notion of concretisation is developed by Ingarden in his Das Literarische Kunst-
werk, Halle, 1931, referred to as LKW, English translation: The Literary Work of Art, 
Evanston, 1973, below: LWA.See also Section 5 of the present paper. 
12 A far greater number of possibilities and therefore also a more subtle framework result 
when we introduce the further moments of existential separateness/inseparateness, and 
existential self-dependence/contingency (see SEW, I, 115-23; TMB, 82-91). Thus although 
in the present paper we have used the word 'object' (Gegenstand) in the widest sense, when 
these moments are incorporated we shall find ourselves able to distinguish between modes 
of being of mathematical objects-proper, mathematical relations, and mathematical prop-
erties and states of affairs. Such differentiations are often crucial within the philosophy of 
mathematics, e.g. where we wish to assert that a mathematical property such as the prop-
erty of being an inductive number is autonomous and original, whilst at the same time 
asserting that natural numbers sui generis are mere fictions. 
13 The differences between sub-universes are never simply a matter of magnitude, i.e. of 
the relative strength of axioms of infinity which hold within given sub-universes. Such 
differences also concern the effectivity of methods which can be used to derive consequences 
from such axioms. Cf. S. C. Kleene, Introduction to Metamathematics, Amsterdam, 1952, 
passim. 
14 Psychologism, the (ambiguous) doctrine that mathematical objects are 'mentalistic', 
seems most adequately to be conceived as a special case of materialism. 
15 Brouwer identifies his doctrine closely with that of Kant. See his paper 'Intuitionism 
and Formalism', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 20 (1913) 81-96.

25 SEW, I, 259-60; TMB, 79-80: "It seems doubtful that we could succeed in proving 
that everything we encounter in ideal being exists in its essence of necessity, such that it 
could not not be. On the other hand it also does not seem probable that all ideal objects 
(especially mathematical objects, logical relations, ideals, ideal qualities) could be regarded 
as existentially derivative, as created by some original being. . .. There is also the possi-
bility of acknowledging two different varieties of an extratemporal mode of being: one, 
in which existential originality would appear and in which there would be primary elements 
of the realm of ideal objects of a certain type, and a second, which would contain existential 
derivation. "

'stratum of represented objects' which Ingarden distinguished in the structure of the lit-
erary work (LK W, L W A, ch. 7), but it cannot be identified with the latter. This is because 
the mathematical work has a double object-stratum. The 'higher' stratum has the character 
of a 'stratum of aspects' in which the 'lower' pre-given 'central core' mathematical objects 
are received into consciousness. But it cannot be identified, either, with the 'stratum of 
aspects' as distinguished by Ingarden in the literary work, since it has in turn its own 
'higher' stratum of aspects. We might remark that so-called "higher mathematics" deals, 
in effect, with the objects of higher strata of creative mathematical works.

role in the advance of mathematics comparable to works of 'revolutionary' as opposed 
to 'nonnal' science as these are distinguished by T. S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific 
Revolutions, Chicago, 1970. Perhaps the best example of a 'creative' mathematical work 
would be that ofG. Cantor, Beitriige zur Begriindung der Transfiniten Mengenlehre, 1895-7,

45 This is emphasised by Wittgenstein who, however, arbitrarily asserts that 'schematisa-
tion' pervades the whole of mathematics; even, for example, simple addition requires the 
introduction of what he calls a 'paradigm'; cf. his Remarks, pp. 1-5, and especially p. 3, 
"We say, for instance, to someone who uses a sign [say x! 2] unknown to us: 'If by 'x! 2' 
you mean x 2, then you get this value for y, if you mean Jx, that one.' - Now ask your-
self: how does one mean the one thing or the other by 'x! 2' ?" .

understanding of mathematics, e.g. p. 60, 11-11.

49 "The comparison with alchemy suggests itself. We might speak of a kind of alchemy 
in mathematics. It is the eannark of this mathematical alchemy that mathematical prop-
ositions are regarded as statements about mathematical objects, - therefore mathematics 
becomes the exploration of these objects?" Wittgenstein, op. cit., p. 142.

and then also concretisations of the original work as mediated through such textbooks.

53 This is argued by van Breda, in Analecta Husserliana, II, op. cit., p. 112, "I think per-
sonally that the freedom of Othello is extremely relative. There are a lot of things stemming 
from the transcendental world in Hamlet. The question is the extent of the freedom of 
the one who is creating poetical works, the one who is making a statue, the one who is 
making Flemish paintings. In the end, you depend, for instance, on the tools you use."

55 This status is not confined to literary objects. It can also come to be applied, by history, 
to individual real objects (compare the English adjective 'Churchillian'), and also to 'higher-
order' realities such as democracy, war, the proletariat, etc., and even certain religious 
'objects'.

Introduction 1 
FROM THE TRANSCENDENTAL AND THE ONTOLOGICAL TO 
THE NEW CONTEXTUAL PHASE OF PHENOMENOLOGY 
At the end of the nineteenth century the new prestige of the positive 
spirit meant the bankruptcy of philosophy, which was accused both of 
lacking appropriate methods for the different sectors of cognition it was 
treating, and of illegitimately attempting to represent the universe of the 
philosophical quest in all its dimensions by arbitrary, imaginative 
speculation. Philosophical investigation was advised to confine itself to 
a precise, strictly delimited sector for which it could provide fitting and 
cognitively justified tools. 
With Husserl's phenomenology, in the beginning of the twentieth 
century, philosophy was resuscitated like the Phoenix from the ashes. 
When Husserl, following Brentano, undertook the task of establishing 
for the philosophical inquiry such a legitimate and cognitively certain 
set of tools, which would satisfy the criteria of positive thinking, the 
first outline of the phenomenological foundation of cognition appeared 
restricted to the specific dimension of the eidetic structures as corre-

244 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
sponding to the eidetic intuition. The 'bodily presence' and inter sub-
jective verifiability of essences or eidoi seemed to restrict the field of 
phenomenological inquiry to ontology. 
Phenomenology, by adopting the critical attitude of the period and 
by rejecting the attempt to arbitrarily connect disparate realms of inquiry 
into homogeneous systems, has in this respect assumed a strikingly new 
character. In contrast to the great system builders of the previous age, 
Husserl was very cautious to avoid mixing together different types of 
problems. In fact, keeping rigorously to analysis, he formulated questions 
only as they emerged from the immediate inspection of the subject matter. 
And yet, following the intrinsic demands of this rigorously maintained 
inquiry, Husserl was led to extend the scope of his query over his 
program and to develop new, hitherto unforeseen approaches. 
If we look at the progress of philosophical thinking, we find that each 
great system builder has presented the universe of human discourse from 
one specific point of view. Following his basic attitude his followers 
would develop it to its last conclusions. His radical opponent would then 
reject his total picture by showing its reverse to our sight by opening a 
new perspective, a new dimension of the universe. 
But in the case of phenomenological progress, we see its most re-
markable and unique position in history in the fact that by adhering 
rigidly to the analytic procedure adopted at its beginning, it has, by the 
very course of research and guided by the demands of the concatenations 
of the nature of the subject matter, that is, of the human universe itself, 
progressed from one dimension of reality to the next. From the ground-
work of ontological analysis, Husserl is led to the dimension of human 
consciousness in its subjective constitutive function. But could we really 
stop having in front of us merely the ideal ontological substructure of 
the universe, in its pure possibles on the one hand, and, on the other 
hand, the universe of man's consciousness in its universal constitutive 
progress explicating the specifically human life-world? Would the sub-
jacent links of the subject matter itself not lead on to other questions 
concerning the nature of the pre-conscious life, Nature and the existing 
universe in which man's subjectivity is rooted? Could the analytic inquiry 
stop at the immediately given texture of the human world, which would 
present nothing but a tautology unless we try to understand its reasons, 
man's conditions in Nature and the All? 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
245 
Thus, it is from its very workings that phenomenology has as a field 
of research opened different dimensions of inquiry within the same 
scheme. It has followed the nature of things: from the eidetic analysis 
of possibles as models of our world and universe, through the analytic 
inquiry of the immediately given genetic unfolding of man's conscious-
ness, phenomenological research has deliberately moved from the 
'essentially' given to givenness that has to be retrieved and acknowledged 
in its own right. 
In the present study we propose to present the focal points of this 
self-critical inward development of the phenomenological inquiry as 
first planned by Edmund Husserl and carried to its final conclusions by 
Roman Ingarden. 
In both classic phases of phenomenology, the transcendental phase of 
Husserl and the ontological phase unfolded by Ingarden, the major issue 
is the same: the status of the real world with respect to pure conscious-
ness. Husserl's inquiry ran into insurmountable difficulties. Ingarden has 
started in full awareness of these difficulties by making the Idealism/ 
Realism issue the focus of attention. And yet the transcendental monism 
of Husserl as well as its seemingly radical opponent, the ontological 
pluralism of Ingarden, have failed to come to grips with the complex 
problems concerning the relation between the real world and the human 
monad. They both break down at the same point: the pre-conscious life 
conditions of man and the world. 
It appears that while the Husserlian transcendental inquiry has reduced 
the universe of discourse to a transcendental monistic position, Ingar-
den's ontological investigation has restored the proper status to each 
type of objects in a metaphysical pluralism. 
These two lines of the phenomenological inquiry complement each 
other, exploiting the resources of their framework. Brought to their 
final conclusions, they show the limitations of the classic phenomenology, 
and they indicate by their failure the perspectives in which to enlarge 
and transform its framework. It remains, however, obvious that the 
initial program of phenomenology has not outlived its intrinsic inspira-
tions, nor are its resources near to being exhausted. On the contrary, the 
new perspectives already appear dimly through the struggles and failures 
of both persevering seekers of 'absolute' truth. Not only does Husserl's 
transcendental constitutive schema show at various points of its extension 

246 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
(from The Logical Investigations through and beyond the Crisis) dimen-
sions of experience that his interpreting framework cannot handle, but 
Ingarden's own gigantic apparatus devised to grasp and articulate 
elements which are involved in the great controversy also breaks down. 
And yet, while on the one hand, under the pressure of these subliminal 
elements of nature and of man's conditions they cannot keep the classic 
methodological framework of the phenomenological inquiry from falling 
apart, on the other hand they have prepared the ground for a new 
framework to enter into play. 
Indeed, we submit that with the most recent phenomenological quest 
which emerges from the inheritance of the two phases, the transcendental 
genetic and that of ontological constructivism, we are now entering with 
our query into a subjacent stream of life. The new framework of 
investigation which it projects for itself remains faithful to the Husserlian 
principles by maintaining, on the one hand, the PRINCIPLE OF ALL 
PRINCIPLES guaranteeing all accesses to experience as well as, on the other 
hand, the postulate of an intrinsic rationale indispensable for the 
coherence of existence as safeguarding the second basic postulate of 
phenomenology: that of IRREDUCIBILITY. 
To delineate this self-critical progress of the phenomenological inves-
tigation towards its decisive point of breaking into a new dimension of 
man-and-the human condition we shall concentrate upon the develop-
ment of the research of Roman Ingarden, who, having learned from 
Husserl's difficulties, tries in his own endeavor to overcome them.

FUNDAMENTAL RATIONALITY AND THE

Chapter I 
CONSTITUT1VE CONSCIOUSNESS PROVOKING THE GREAT DEBATE 
BETWEEN INGARDEN AND HUSSERL AT THE HEART OF 
PHENOMENOLOGY! 
Whitehead tells us that "Every philosophical school in the course of its 
history requires two presiding philosophers. One of them under the 
influence of the main doctrines of the school should survey experience 
with some adequacy, but inconsistently. The other philosopher should 
reduce the doctrines of the school to a rigid consistency; he will thereby 
effect a reductio ad absurdum. No school of thought has performed its 
full service to philosophy until these men have appeared." 2 
In a very real sense Roman Ingarden may be said to have fulfilled with 
respect to HusserI a significant part of this task of clarification which 
Whitehead calls for. For Ingarden's philosophical enterprise is at the 
same time a continuation of the line of thought inaugurated by HusserI 
and a revolution in the very principles of that philosophy. In so far as 
he carries on the task described by HusserI and applies the means used 
by him, his work exhibits a unique faithfulness to the original project 
of the reconstruction of philosophy. Indeed, as such, Ingarden's philoso-
phy is more akin to the classical doctrine of the founder of phenomenol-
ogy than any other philosophical inquiry originating from the same 
source. But Ingarden is also founding phenomenology in a new way and, 
consequently, tracing the lines of the inquiry all over again. This he does 
in so far as he rejects the transcendental bounds of the phenomenological 
method and proceeds on the purely ontological ground from which his 
investigation starts and on which it remains. 
The central feature of HusserI's phenomenology, and the one which 
insures for it a place of particular significance among the great philo-
sophical enterprises of the past and present, is its fundamental aim or 
intention: the clarification of knowledge rather than the construction 

248 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
of explanations, the achievement of self-explicitness (givenness) of 
cognition in the insights, and self-justification in the judgements of 
philosophy, rather than the establishment of the validity of these in 
terms of a body of doctrines, which is itself determined by the necessities 
of a certain justification. Consequently, the task of the philosopher is no 
longer viewed as that of a demiurgos creating an explanatory universe in 
his own right, but rather as that of a dispassionate but inquisitive witness, 
led by the hand by the nature of the witnessed itself. Indeed, for HusserI, 
it is the "principle of all principles" to bring the self-evidence of the 
given to its proper position, not only as prior to a critical evaluation of 
cognition but even as the only valid source of criteria for discernment and 
discrimination. Together with his enlarged conception of the 'object' as 
embracing all possible objects of thought and the essential possibility 
of the 'object' being originally given, he is restoring to the status of the 
'acceptably' knowable many a rejected aspect of cognition. In so doing, 
HusserI is giving a common status to the complete realm of knowledge, 
the reconsideration of which carries with it the promise of a vast philo-
sophical reconstruction. 
As is well known, HusserI's formulation of the aim of philosophy in 
these terms accounts for two further aspects of transcendental phenome-
nology: 1, it offers self-evident criteria for the given as the source of valid, 
necessary cognition along with a set of postulates for an apodictic 
science; and 2, it attempts their theoretical establishment (and justifi-
cation) by what is known as the transcendental theory of the phenome-
nological method, one which culminates in the doctrine of pure con-
sciousness. 
After having arrived through the so-called 'transcendental reduction' 
of our empirical conscious acts to their purely intentional nature to 
uncover in its intentional structure the field of consciousness, HusserI 
discovers consciousness as a source from which all our psychic acts 
spring forth; intentional acts reveal themselves, in turn, as responsible 
for the formation of objects of our cognition. The dynamic progress of 
the stream of consciousness through innumerable instances of intentional 
acts, each of which object-forming and mediating its cognition, strikes 
HusserI as being identical with the dynamic progress of the human world, 
of the world as experienced by us, which we progressively unfold to 
discover ever more complex forms from the beginning of our life on. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
249 
Establishing the possibility of grasping and analyzing the modes in 
which the forms of life and the world are constituted in series of inten-
tional acts, Husserl has developed a gigantic inquiry into the simulta-
neous constitutive unfolding of the human transcendental consciousness 
and life-world. 
In point of fact the 'spontaneous' unfolding of the conscious acts is 
shown to follow a universal line of development. At the point of our 
transcendental inquiry we are already tributary not only of our own 
completely developed consciousness and its world, but also of the levels 
of progress accomplished by our cultural period, itself a heir of the 
complete development of Western Humanity. Thus the constitutive 
analysis has to follow the 'logic' of this genesis in retrospect, backwards. 
Its main objective is to uncover the structures and concatenations of the 
intentional system from its most complex forms of the cultural world 
down to the original forms of the fundamental, basic human experience. 
Ultimately it seeks the constitutive origin of the complexity of the inten-
tional acts themselves in the final or first stage of conscious existence, 
the formation of the psychic undifferentiated flow into the structure of 
temporality. 
However, as Roman Ingarden has pointed out in his criticism of the 
Cartesian Meditations, the theoretical foundation of phenomenology is 
affected with an unsurmountable difficulty. On Husserl's theory we have 
to assume the specific nature of the transcendental consciousness in 
order to conduct the phenomenological reductions leading to the attain-
ment of the level of self-evident cognition, while it is precisely first through 
the proper practice of the phenomenological reductions that the trans-
cendental consciousness can be revealed in its nature. Every critical-
theoretical foundation - as opposed to a spontaneous insight of genius -
concludes Ingarden, is necessarily moving in a circle. It seems particu-
larly difficult to break out of this circle in Husserl's case. For it is 
precisely the notion of the exclusively intentional character of all con-
scious acts that is instrumental in the theoretical establishment of the 
phenomenological method and, at the same time, it is this notion which 
results in a conception of consciousness as a self-sufficient, closed sphere 
"which receives nothing and from which nothing can escape". All the 
inconveniences of this conception are only too well known, as it is also 
known that Husserl never ceased looking for remedies to them. Indeed, 

250 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
much of the controversy concerning a realistic or an idealistic inter-
pretation of HusserI would seem to center around this problem. The 
position of those who see a form of idealism in this transcendental 
conception seems to be based upon the implicit objection that it is 
precisely the particular bias brought about by this erroneous starting 
point which drove HusserI's subsequent thought more and more into the 
labyrinth of transcendental consciousness. This same bias, it is said, 
directs and initiates all of Husserl's subsequent efforts to find a remedy 
in the genetic approach involving the constitution of the alter-ego, the 
body, and the life-world. And, finally, these critics would say, this would 
imply that his proposed task of a reconstruction of the philosophical 
universe has in reality been surreptitiously reduced to a vast analysis of 
consciousness. 
The epistemological foundation of Husserl's phenomenology neces-
sarily involves a vicious circle. Bringing this to light, Ingarden asks, 
"Is there any way out?" And it is at this critical point that he takes up 
again the task which Husserl originally proposed to phenomenology. 
However, if a 'beginning' in philosophy such as HusserI calls 'absolute' 
is at all possible, it can only refer to insight. Furthermore, the absolute 
character of the insight cannot refer to its epistemologico-methodological 
aspect but to the nature of the objects thus revealed. That is, Ingarden 
sets out with a radical challenge to Husserl intending to investigate the 
initial question whether we may from the mode of givenness of pure 
consciousness as transcendent to the empirical consciousness and the 
soul conclude legitimately about existential separateness of one from 
the other; maybe the insight into the ontological structure of transcen-
dent objects will more adequately reestablish their otherwise falsified 
existential interconnections. Husserllacks the concept of 'transcendence' . 
From this radical point of divergence with Husserl's 'transcendental 
tum' Ingarden sets out to undertake the investigation concerning the 
explication of the world-order and look at its foundations on his own. 
It may seem that in his undertaking he is simply returning to the first 
HusserIian program of eidetic inquiry of the 'regions of objects'. Con-
cerning the results of his vast ontological analysis it might also be 
thought, as H. G. Gadamer has pointed out, that it offers merely the 
objective side to the Husserlian subjective constitution. However, already 
starting out from the crucial point of what he has considered the flaw 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
251 
of the Husserlian enterprise, namely of the Realism/Idealism problem 
and having carried out in an unprejudiced manner the ontological ana-
lysis of the major elements entering this issue, he has in his results, as 
we will show, elaborated a groundwork for the philosophical reconstruc-
tion of the major lines of the discourse about the universe and man 
radically divergent from that of Husserl: from the Husserlian meta-
physical monism of the one and unique principle of transcendental 
consciousness, he has switched to an ontological pluralism of regions of 
objects as distributed within three realms: ideal, intentional, empirical. 
From the avowed strict continuity of the all-embracing world picture, 
he has so far got stuck with the discreteness among singular objects 
within some of the regions and with the discontinuity (if not separated-
ness) among, at least, some regions of objects. Concerning his initial 
point of controversy with Husserl, the transcendental consciousness he 
hopes to have established on the basis of ontological existential ties is an 
intentional-empirical unity of the monad or "concrete consciousness". 
Having entered his program from the criticism of constitutive con-
sciousness and set it around the question of legitimacy/illegitimacy of 
this latter to account on its own for the distinctive existential status of 
the real world, Ingarden might have brought the complete double-faced 
program of phenomenology to its last conclusions, but did he avoid 
ultimately the pitfalls of Husserl? Finally, the quest after principles of 
their shifting continuity - or their existential concatenation - may be 
seen as a deliberate shift from cognition to Action. 
Chapter II 
INGARDEN'S FORMAL ONTOLOGY LA YING DOWN THE 
CORNERSTONES OF ORDER 
1. Aims and Doubts 
At the outset of our proposed critical appreciation of his ramified work, 
let us state that Ingarden claims to operate a radical anti-Cartesian and 
anti-Husserlian tum in the approach to the problems of the world-man 
situation by turning away from the epistemological explanation and 
justification of validity of what we take the world - and man - to be 
and how we should discriminate among what appears to be and how it 

252 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
really is, by taking for the start an ontological assessment of the 
apodictically certain status quo of both. And yet, even if in the final 
account we may grant him that the a priori structural differentiations 
are the principles of fundamental rationality of the objectivity, at least 
two doubts may and will arise and are to be kept in mind in view of the 
critical course our inquiry will take. First, does not the method, onto-
logically self-explanatory, that is guaranteeing "certain and indubitable" 
cognitive status-to the complete universe of the human reality - introduce 
into its concrete and continuous field radical cleavages, precisely of an 
epistemological nature? In other words, although Ingarden does not 
seek to establish the validity of his analysis through those of epistemo-
logical criteria, does he not fall ultimately into the same trap of the 
radical and insuperable separation between abstractively established 
concepts and the concrete existential ties among things and beings of the 
otherwise homogeneous universe of man into which both Descartes and 
Husserl fall? That is, is not the ideal, ontological approach to reality 
as self-explanatory an epistemological predecision, albeit in an indirect 
fashion, about the path to take to explain man and his universe, which 
might ultimately bring with itself the classic difficulties Ingarden expects 
to avoid? 
Indeed, unlike some of his also 'realistically' oriented predecessors in 
history - just to mention Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz - Ingarden does not 
come to the quest of the world-order, for which he obviously sets rational 
principles, from the investigation of the concrete - of the world of mere 
aggregates - insofar as this world fails to provide its own principles of 
organization. And yet, in this very failure, Aristotle or Leibniz find the 
postulates of order to be intrinsic to it and guaranteeing the continuity 
of the whole spectrum of the reality. 
The second doubt, to which we will become sensitive as our investiga-
tion runs through the complete set of Ingarden's analysis, is whether the 
so abstractively distilled rational principles are not restricted to the 
rationally constituted 'objective' reality. That is, whether perpetuating 
the Cartesian postulate of "clear and distinct ideas" as coupled in a 
Platonic fashion with singling out one supposedly privileged type of 
correlation (certainly of a type of cognition warranted by the ideal sub-
structure of being) we do not introduce an artificial cleavage into the 
complete concrete pulp of man's life within the pulsating and homoge-

253 
neous manifold of the world, which in its concreteness might with these 
assumptions remain - parallel to Husserl's "empirical consciousness" -
irretrievable. 
2. Ingarden's Program 3 
To situate in general Ingarden's philosophical enterprise let us repeat 
that Ingarden's philosophical orientation may stem partly from his 
criticism of Husserl, partly he is continuing some of Husserl's initial 
guidelines. And yet in this enterprise he makes a new philosophical 
'conversion' of a new radical beginning, not simply continuing a line, 
but on the contrary taking off from his very own historical situation. 
The history of modem philosophy has indeed reached a point of 
extreme tension where its problematics have diversified and where the 
latter's requirements have come into sharper focus. Philosophy has 
proposed the most diverse solutions, but fundamental individual atti-
tudes have been unable to recognize the sum of scattered contributions 
as a "common .good". 
Ingarden's purpose is above all the establishment of this "common 
good". But in seeking to achieve this result he aims at the point or the 
initial position from which the whole range of problems and solutions 
could derive both significance and value. This reflection leads him to 
discover a new basis from which he is in a position to carry out a 
complete reshaping of philosophy, in a twofold way: first, by rescuing 
the positive results which have come to the fore throughout history, 
and secondly, by inserting them into a new, vigorous and comprehensive 
ontological analysis. 
How did Ingarden come to this undertaking? What path has led him 
there? 
Ingarden first focused his attention upon the phenomenological ana-
lysis of the work of art; his analyses of literary and musical works have 
become major contributions to esthetics. Even during this first period, 
however, he was concerned chiefly with problems relating to the con-
troversy between Idealism and Realism, which he approached now 
through studies of the theory of philosophy, now through the above-
mentioned inquiry. Indeed, these first efforts centered in the study in 
depth of the specific nature of intentional beings, the exfoliation of which 
was to be the focus of his thinking. It is to those common problems 

254 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
that he devoted works such as Vom formalen Aufbau des individuellen 
Gegenstandes, which seeks to define the structure of ideal and real beings, 
whether individual beings or processes and events, and Essentiale Fragen, 
which makes explicit the structure of ideas. 
Although Ingarden utilizes eidetic analysis, just as Hussed does, we 
can also in this case repeat after Fink, that "it is a mistake to believe 
that phenomenology resides entirely in its use", or that "the mere 
description of regional essences cannot be called philosophy". 
For Ingarden's own studies, far from allowing us to consider them 
merely as studies of regional ontology, signify above all an attempt to 
challenge some of Hussed's fundamental acquisitions. This is true at 
least in so far as they follow from a Cartesian and transcendental 
orientation, particularly as adopted by Husserlian reflection after the 
first volume of Logical Investigations. 4 On the other hand, they are 
preliminary to the effort of rethinking and approaching the full range of 
philosophical problems. It is indeed in these studies that we find in out-
line the plan of an ontology within which the complete revamping of 
philosophy will be directly operated. 
By refusing to follow Hussed's idealistic tendencies and by placing, 
at the origin of his reflection, his effort "on the near side of Idealism 
and Realism", Ingarden is akin to Nicolai Hartmann and Heidegger; 
but he parts company with them by his essential purpose and his 
methods. 
Ingarden sees the problem ofthe existence of the real world as the pivot-
al point of all philosophical problems, i.e. constitutes the fundamental 
philosophical problem, and, by placing it at the center of his concerns 
and attacking it directly, believes he has found the cardinal viewpoint 
from which it will become possible to order the various problems 
according to their own individual requirements. 
Ingarden emphasizes the fact that this issue, although it has occupied 
the most remarkable minds of European philosophy and that several 
noteworthy and profound attempts have been made to solve it, has so 
far remained unsolved, and that the two opposing tendencies of idealists 
and realists of various persuasions persist, without reaching the pos-
sibility of mutual understanding. This shows that the errors which have 
made the solution impossible probably originated at the very starting 
point of these various approaches. And, according to Ingarden, this 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
255 
starting point is quite simply the question itself. Which is to say that at 
the very point where the question arises and is formulated there must be 
not only a lack of clarity but confusion. Accurate analysis of various 
philosophical systems shows that the controversy between idealism and 
realism hides a multitude of questions which have never been distin-
guished, defined and analyzed in their specificity or interrelationships. 
Instead of venturing directly by a new inquiry into this controversy, 
Ingarden proposes to develop systematically all the subordinate problems 
which it involves, so as to elaborate the exact position and correct 
formulation of the problem itself. 
Within the wide field of these preliminary investigations, Ingarden 
formulates first of all a new ontological basis for the Idealism-Realism 
issue. In fact, progressing toward the more accurate position of the 
problem, he already advances toward its solution. To start with, these 
investigations must introduce a more subtle conceptual apparatus, at 
once accurate and unambiguous, answering the requirements of the true 
nature of things, as revealed by ontology. We shall find a number of 
fundamental acquisitions of this order through an essential analysis. 
However - and this is remarkable - these acquisitions, which partly 
appear in the form of existential aspects of beings and under the aprioric 
laws which regulate them, already rule out certain solutions. 
These analyses enable Ingarden furthermore to elaborate the formal 
concepts of the real world and of pure consciousness, which are the two 
major poles of the controversy, and finally the possible solutions are 
seen to be reduced to only two. The actual progress in this undertaking 
is due only to the radical transformation of the question itself. One may 
wonder what has made this transformation possible. Is it not the con-
sequence of an original methodological foundation? Indeed, as we here 
already stated, Ingarden's elaboration of a new conception of ontology 
opens a specific field of investigation. However, Ingarden is guided by 
the ideal of universal science. He could not therefore be satisfied with 
merely a new solution; the methodological foundation must also provide 
its own justification. 5 
We will limit ourselves to investigate some pivotal points of Ingarden's 
thinking considered with respect to these two major poles. First, we will 
attempt (a) to define the originality of the starting point of Ingarden's 
thinking. Then (c) we will try to follow the progressive transformation 

256 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
of the central problem along with our critical argument that will unfold 
on major points of his analysis. Beforehand, (b) we will however outline 
his new conceptual apparatus, which has been the basic instrument for 
the implementation of Ingarden's undertaking. 
3. The Original Point of Departure of Ingarden's Thinking and Its 
Justification 
As a provisional point of departure allowing him to bring out in a general 
manner the usual terms and difficulties of the Idealism-Realism problem, 
Ingarden chooses Husserl's transcendental idealism which, he feels, 
contains all the elements of the position of this problem, while presenting 
the deepest attempt at a solution found in the history of modem philo-
sophy. This attempt assumes the distinction between at least two fields 
of individual beings: "pure consciousness" and the "real world". Both 
fields are assumed on the basis of the immanent perception as two fields 
of fundamentally opposite regions of beings. This opposition does not 
preclude the existence of relationships between them nor - and this is 
one of the points of the controversy - the discussion and elaboration of 
the nature of these relationships. However, Ingarden notes that this 
discussion is already limited by other assumptions relating to the 
opposition between pure consciousness and the real world: one assumes 
from the start the 'transcendence' of real beings in relation to pure 
consciousness, on the one hand, and the unquestionable existence of 
pure consciousness, on the other. But Ingarden emphasizes the fact that 
the nature of sensory perception and that of immanent perception, on 
which this absolute opposition rests, offers no certitude, at least insofar 
as the nature of the real world is concerned. Therefore, the opposition 
between these two regions of being, since it is fundamental to the con-
troversy, appears unjustified to him, and leads him to revise the concepts 
of 'real world', 'real being', 'reality' and 'pure consciousness', on a level 
other than that of experience. This is the level on which it would also be 
necessary to scrutinize and revise the concepts of 'dependence' and of 
the real world's 'independence' in relation to consciousness (and vice 
versa), of its 'transcendence', etc. 
It becomes apparent that Ingarden, who is opposed to Cartesianism, 
proposes to approach these questions on a level other than that which 
in Husserl's reflection postulates the primacy of pure conscience, in terms 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
257 
of that which it reveals to us of the transcendental level, in other words. 
The new approach which he shows us is the very foundation of his 
philosophy. 
On the other hand it is clear that Ingarden, like all philosophers who 
brought about a fundamental revolution in the approach to permanent 
problems, considers that philosophy is a universal science requiring an 
absolute foundation. In rejecting HusserI's transcendental perspective, in 
which he sees an idealistic pre-decision, he seeks to avoid above all the 
quasi-epistemological point of departure of a Nicolai Hartmann. In his 
thinking, the motto zu den Sachen selbst takes on a specific significance. 
Inter alia, it is a matter of approaching beings directly, i.e., neither in 
terms nor in the perspective of the conscious processes through which 
experience delivers them to us, but in their very nature, immediately as 
they are given to us. A question arises, however: are they ever given to 
us immediately in their nature, in a manner universally valid and un-
questionable? A fundamental portion of Ingarden's works forms an 
answer to this question. 
Husserl, who in Vol. I of Logical Investigations studied the eidetic 
universe, failed however to elucidate its methodological foundation: the 
problem of the idea itself. The concept of 'idea' remained vague, no 
clearer than that of 'essence' (eidos), and in fact partially fused with the 
latter. 6 In Vol. II of Logical Investigations, the scope of this approach 
was extended through the introduction of eidetic research into the field 
of the universe of consciousness; thus, the direct grasp of essences, the 
source of the criterion of its validity, universality and a priori nature, 
become relative to transcendental consciousness, to its laws and its 
prerogatives. 
Ingarden revives eidetic analysis in its autonomous priority, but with 
a totally new basis, and already in returning to the problems of the 
controversy he is essentially in opposition to the Husserlian approach 
and to Cartesian attempts in general. 
In order that the various aspects of the many problems raised by the 
real world and pure consciousness (in their mutual relationships) be 
ensured an adequate formulation and appropriate research methods, 
Ingarden works out a new division of philosophical questions and, in 
relation to these questions, a new division of philosophical disciplines. 7 
This division is based on the differentiation between the various 

258 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
problems, operated with reference to the possibilities of their separation, 
and to the requirements of the problems themselves. 
The culminating point of the division consists in the conception of 
metaphysics: covering the same field as the specific sciences, i.e., the full 
set of facts contained within the limits of the real world, it is set apart 
from those sciences in that it does not consider facts in their pure 
'facticity'; facts come within the field of metaphysics only insofar as they 
are considered in the light of essences, and they are thus explicated by 
the ontic aspect of beings. 
Epistemology has within this framework to be able to furnish meta-
physics with the means for this apodictic establishment of facts in their 
essences. Criteriology must allow a critique of the knowledge gained. 
But it is ontology which is expected to lay the groundwork of all 
investigations. And yet, ontology itself, as well as the principle of 
division into metaphysics, epistemology and criteriology, goes back to 
Ingarden's fundamental discovery of the specific status of ideas. 
In Essentiale Fragen, Ingarden had already tackled the specific study 
of the nature of ideas, of essence, of "pure links of necessity", of the 
whole eidetic universe. From the specific nature of ideas, as against 
"autonomous individual beings" (ideal or real), "simply intentional 
beings" and "pure qualities", there evolved the center and the original 
foundation of his philosophy. 
For an idea is distinguished by the duality of its structure. (Through 
its manifestations, this fact was sensed by Plato, but it was never 
discovered and made explicit, and thus its significance had never come 
to light.) In contradistinction to individual beings, which have a 'simple' 
structure, which exist only as concrete, specific individual beings, an idea 
is endowed not only with a 'choice' of properties which constitute it as a 
specific idea, but it also has a particular 'content' which distinguishes it 
as the idea of one particular individual being from another. According 
to Ingarden, this 'content' is a 'selection', i.e., a complete set of properties 
particular in the nature of its composition as a whole. In concreto, the 
content of an idea is to Ingarden a specially composed plurality of "pure 
ideal qualities". 
How would this choice of pure qualities be composed? With which 
specific characteristics must its components be endowed in order to 
'correspond' to the individual beings who "fall under such or other 
idea"? 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
259 
Once more, an idea is differentiated from individual beings by the fact 
that the latter are fully and univocally determined by the totality of their 
properties; every 'space' or 'locus' is thus 'filled' by a specific property, 
whether in the order of general properties or in that of the more 
particular ones. In this complete determination, there remains no 'empty, 
vacant space', or 'nondetermined' space. On the other hand, the content 
of an idea possesses two kinds of elements: first there are univocally 
determined elements, in the guise of certain 'ideal qualities'; in concreto, 
they are in the ideal mode of existence. Ingarden calls them 'constants', 
thus emphasizing their stability and invariability within an idea. But these 
ideal qualities, however concrete they may be, as for example 'color', are 
of a general nature, and they thus 'circumscribe', by their generic 
qualities, a realm of individual qualities, which can complete them 
through concretization. These qualities are not univocally determined; 
quite the opposite, a single one of them, the selection of which cannot 
however be indicated on the basis of the knowledge of the idea, must 
be concretized in an individual being. Ingarden calls it a 'variable' of 
the idea. 8 
For it is through the content that an idea 'relates' to the realm of 
individual beings; a generic quality made concrete in them, and con-
stituting them, would be but a particular concretization of a constant. 
A structural nucleus would thus be held in common by an idea and by 
an individual being. (However, Ingarden does not inquire into the 
relationships between ideas and individual beings.) Another aspect of 
ideas must still be emphasized. For "ideal pure qualities" (constants) are 
linked, within the content of the idea, by a tissue of "pure links of 
necessity" to the "pure possibilities" (variables). To take an example, 
the ideal quality of red is necessarily linked to, connected with the 
possibilities, which it indicates, of the possible concretizations of the 
various tones and shades of red. The ideal quality is necessarily linked 
to those possibilities in so far as no red being can exist without possessing 
a shade, a particular tone, nuance, intensity, brightness, etc., which is to 
say that the pure quality of red requires intrinsically being completed 
by an individual property, and that the former indicates the sphere of 
the latter. 9 
This analysis of an idea, of its content, which we have just outlined, 
was already carried out by Ingarden in Essentiale Fragen, published in 

260 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
1924; Husserl became acquainted with it at that time. In 1927, dis-
cussing with Ingarden this conception of ideas embodied in Essentiale 
Fragen, Husserl showed him a manuscript dated 1925 and devoted to 
the problems of 'Variations', i.e., to the development of an operation 
which would make it possible to reach that which Ingarden calls the 
"content of the idea". Some aspects of this reflection appear in Formale 
und transzendentale Logik (1929). This entire conception was incorpo-
rated, either by Husserl or by Landgrebe, into Erfahrung und Urteil. 9a 
An entire field of research thus opens up in the investigation of the 
relationships between constants and variables. It takes on major sig-
nificance if one considers that, since there exists a correspondence be-
tween pure qualities and generic qualities (the latter forming the 
structural nucleus of individual beings), their relationships with pure 
possibilities represent the links uniting, within individual beings, their 
generic qualities to the individual properties. (For the generic qualities 
dictate the individual qualities by which they are to be completed, in the 
same way as the corresponding pure qualities do relative to pure 
possibilities.) 
Consequently, the necessary ideal links uniting pure qualities to pure 
possibilities in the content of ideas reflect the structural links among the 
properties within the corresponding individual beings. In the contents 
of ideas, we thus find the individual beings in their intelligible structures; 
these structures hidden in the opacity of concrete existence are here made 
transparent. 
The crux of the matter however is that, on the level of the content of 
ideas, we deal with the a priori character of beings. By their very nature, 
ideas present us beings of the universe and the universe itself - while 
respecting their specificity and authenticity - as a world given immediately 
which finds its apodictic justification in itself. In that world, we are faced 
with structures of beings not in their contingent, passing concreteness 
but in their aspect of necessity - as they would have to be if they 'actually' 
existed. The question of their 'actual' existence is disregarded. In point 
of fact the content of an idea offers no indication of the 'actual' existence 
of individual beings, nor of an 'actual concretization' of the ideal pure 
qualities in individual beings; it does not even offer an indication of an 
actual correspondence between particular ideal pure qualities and 
particular individual beings. It indicates nothing more than structural 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
261 
elements in their interrelationships for a possible actual existence. It does 
not even provide an indication as to its own actual existence: in the idea 
of an idea, no indication is found concerning the actual existence of the 
idea. In the last analysis, it is the function of metaphysics to decide on the 
actual existence of ideas. 
The following question therefore arises: to what extent is the positive 
value of an investigation of the contents of ideas dependent on the 
results of this decision? In other words, what benefit could be drawn from 
the investigation which ideas allow us to carry out, if the actual existence 
of ideas were open to question? Whatever it may be from the viewpoint 
of actual existence, the status of an idea has no bearing on the fact that the 
contents of ideas present us the universe in its ideal form. 
Ingardenian formal ontology consists in the investigation of that 
universe. 
It comprises, in the first place, the analysis of the immediate ideas of 
beings. As such, it embraces Husserlian ontology, with its phenomenolo-
gy of pure consciousness (reine Erlebnisse). One may wonder, in fact, 
whether that investigation is not a variation of the formal ontology 
postulated by Husserl, which would seek to bring out the specific structur-
al types of objects. The difference between these two conceptions is funda-
mental, however. To start with, the structural types of Husserl's ontology 
are considered in principle as 'noetico-noematic' structures. Consequently. 
even if it is the object itself which supposedly serves as 'Leit/aden' for the 
analysis of its structure through the acts by which the object takes shape, 
it is not approached directly as a specific being in its inwardness, belonging 
to some specific type, but rather as 'Gegenstand moglichen Bewusstseins '. 
Furthermore, the links of necessity in which it is sought, and which to 
Hussed signify 'das Miteinander-zugleich-oder-Jolgend-zu sein und Sein-
zu-konnen', are considered in relation to the duration and the active 
development of the constitutive acts of consciousness; these links there-
fore find their ultimate source and justification in transcendental 
subjectivity. The eidos itself, even though it constitutes a fundamental 
methodological landmark, is on the level of Cartesian Meditations taken 
as a generalization, and is thus seen in relation to the faculty of 
consciousness. In the same way, any a priori character of Husserlian 
ontology becomes relative to transcendental consciousness in accordance 
with the definition given by Husserl: 'a priori universal structures based 

262 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
on the essential universal laws of coexistence and egological temporal 
succession' . 
Finally, it is in the fundamental primacy of consciousness as a starting 
point that HusserI's conception of ontology shows itself to be radically 
opposed to Ingarden's, since the latter, proceeding from an immediate 
and impartial analysis of the structural types of beings, presupposes no 
primordiality, no privileged situation of anyone of them in relation to 
the others. Although Ingardenian analysis will also reveal the structure 
of pure consciousness (in so far as this structure is found in the idea of 
pure consciousness and in that as well of a simply intentional being), 
the very scope of intentionality, on which HusserI bases the primacy of 
the transcendental realm and inquiry, is shown to be considerably reduced 
in respect to such requirements as would be necessary for transcendental 
idealism to be valid. 
The following question nevertheless requires attention: if, as HusserI 
believed subsequently to Logical Investigations, and in particular in 
Formal and Transcendental Logic, an idea would be nothing more than 
an intentional object, might not Ingarden's ontology, in the final 
analysis, be also ultimately relative to the constitutive consciousness? 
May it be that its deliberate orientation toward beings, instead of 
signifying a decisive overcoming of the fundamental subject-object 
correlativity, would simply mean the shift of emphasis from the sub-
jective side to the objective side? If this were so, Ingardenian meth-
odological basis - the contents of ideas - would be only a more perfected 
form of 'eidetic reduction', with the difference that the constitutive 
analysis catches the objects in the dynamic progress of constitution, 
whereas the contents of ideas would offer them in their results. 
It is precisely regarding the problem of the relation between idea and 
intentional being that Ingarden's position takes a deliberately objective 
turn. For, the analysis of the structure of intentional being, prepared by 
the author in his writings dealing with the literary, musical, architectonic 
or sculptural works of art to which we will devote special attention later 
becomes the center of reference of his most decisive attitudes. 10 First, 
he is compelled to recognize that intentionality is not a phenomenon 
accompanying every act of consciousness; on the contrary, non-
intentional acts have to be recognized. The crucial conclusion is: the 
recognition of acts of consciousness devoid of intentionality abolishes 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
263 
the claim of intentionality to an absolute status; it thus negates on one 
point the fundamental basis of Husserl's transcendentalism and denounces 
its idealist bias. Furthermore, in contradistinction to HusserI, for whom 
intentional beings differ from real beings solely by their atemporality 
and lack of Leibgegebenheit, Ingarden's a priori analysis shows that there 
are two kinds of intentional beings: those which are occasionally the 
targets of an intention, and those which are nothing without the act of 
intention which produced them. This act would be of a particular kind. 
Objects produced by an intentional act are the only ones to be in fact 
'irrealities' . 
If ideas were simply intentional objects of this kind, we would still 
remain within the confines of the transcendental world. In addition, we 
must ponder whether under these conditions real beings are not a mere 
variation of simply intentional objects. The enclosure around intention 
would then seem impossible. 
When one analyses carefully both ideas and simply intentional objects, 
the reasons for accepting this proposition seem even more numerous 
than it appeared to HusserI. Indeed, Husserl failed to perceive that 
simply intentional objects, like ideas, have a double structure. They 
also possess "non-determinable loci"; the character of Hamlet, for 
instance, reveals only those traits which Shakespeare intended, i.e., 
exclusively those features that are necessary to the presentation of the 
character in the desired light and in the economy of the play. What 
Shakespeare did not deem essential to fill the portrait of Hamlet, will 
remain empty. In any simply intentional being, there will necessarily 
be numerous non-determinable loci; similarly, in the contents of ideas, 
the pure possibilities (variables) are not univocally determined. The pure 
quality of red, for instance, does not indicate which value of red must be 
made concrete in a red rose. 
And yet the opposition between intentional beings and ideas shows 
itself particularly clear in respect to this point. For the variable of an 
idea is not simply an empty locus, a lack of determinative moments, 
as is the case with non-determinable spaces in an intentional object. 
On the contrary, it is a positive moment, postulated by a constant, bound 
by links of necessity to the whole content of the idea. General though it 
may be, it exists in concreto. This content is autonomous and necessary. 
F or the idea, with its content, is absolutely transcendent in relation to 

264 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
conscious acts; we are unable to modify it - an idea is even more resistent 
to our influence than real beings, which we can control through physical 
means. A simply intentional being lacks this transcendence. It is depen-
dent in its existence and its determination on the positional act which 
produced it - it is entirely at the mercy of this act. Thus the non-
determinable loci manifest in the content of a simply intentional being 
leave several choices open. The content of the act does not require that 
the actual selection be resolved in any particular way; the positional 
act simply left an empty space. The nature of the selection is left 
entirely to the arbitrary indication of the intentional act. 11 
This difference emphasizes the absolute dichotomy between simply 
intentional beings in their total dependence on the intention, and the 
independence and absolute transcendence of ideas in relation to 
consciousness. 
Furthermore, intentional beings may have either an ideal or a real 
content, but they nevertheless always remain intentional, whereas idea 
qua idea, in both content and structure, has necessarily but one single 
mode of existence, which is ideal. 
It should again be emphasized that the idea differs essentially from the 
ideal (individual) being which is simple and individual by this double 
structure and its character of generality. 
Thus, as we have already seen, an idea defined as distinct, independent 
and endowed with an individual structure in relation to all the spheres 
of beings opens up first a universe of an a priori universal cognition having 
an absolute foundation. Next, it opens wide vistas for an integral philo-
sophical investigation. The unquestionable and apodictic certainty of 
this foundation, a certainty which has been sought after by all phi-
losophers since Descartes, does not rest on any particular operation of 
the mind (whereas epoche, for instance, does), nor on the primacy of some 
particular field of being (the self, for instance). As we have previously 
noted, it is ensured by its own autonomy in respect to individual beings. 
It constitutes a field of investigation in which we find again all the areas 
of beings, without prejudice and without favoring any particular 
philosophical attitude, all immediately accessible, all becoming explicit 
in the necessary and immutable structures which beings would have to 
assume if they actually existed. 
If one wished to establish a parallel between the two attempts at an 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
265 
apodictic cognition of the world, on the one hand, that of Kantian and 
Husserlian transcendentalism in particular, based on a belief in the 
immanence of every being and of every process and in their relativity to 
consciousness, and on the other hand, that of Ingarden, based on the 
contrary on the on tic possibilities and a priori laws of ideas, as well 
as on their autonomy in relation to consciousness, one would see that 
whereas Husserl was the first to bring a universal investigation to bear 
on pure consciousness, Ingarden for the first time opened the universe 
in its entirety to an a priori universal investigation. 
The task of determining whether the beings offered to us by Ingardenian 
ontology actually exist and of describing the relationship between them 
and the realm of ideas belongs to metaphysics. However, it seems 
legitimate to expect that the solution to the problem of the relationship 
between ideas and individual beings bear no resemblance to platonic 
methexis, nor to the Aristotelian doctrine according to which ideas are 
carried out in individual beings. 
Indeed, ideas are by nature so absolutely different from individual 
beings that they cannot 'take part' in their actual determination nor in 
their being. Besides, their ideal mode of existence precludes any active 
intervention in individual beings. Consequently, the position of the 
problem raised by their relationship will have to be on a different 
plane. 12 Will Ingarden be able to establish it? 
But our subsequent investigations require that advantage be 
immediately taken of the impartiality inherent in the ideal realm just 
discovered and of its hitherto unsuspected resources, in order to further 
the knowledge of beings and of the world, and to investigate the 
possibility of raising, on this impartial plane, the whole range of 
philosophical problems, and in particular that of the relationship 
between the real world and pure consciousness. With this in mind, we 
will present in the next part of this chapter the conceptual apparatus 
eleborated by Ingarden as a necessary means for the analysis of beings.

Chapter III 
THE NEW CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS 
1. Existential Concepts 
First of all, the idea of any being reveals three facets under which a being 
may be considered: form, matter and existence. A study of these three 
aspects makes it possible to understand exhaustibly both the nature of a 
being and its role in the aggregate of beings, its possibilities for action 
and passion, its origin and its dynamic development in their mechanism. 
According to lngarden, it is in its matter that a being first appears 
to us, because matter is the most fundamental element in a being. Matter 
decides about the 'form' in which it can appear, and existence follows 
both of them. To the latter Ingarden devotes the first volume of Spor 0 
istnienie swiata (Controversy about the Existence of the World). This 
may be explained by the fact that an analysis of existence allows one to 
approach the structure of beings, but above all, distinctions of this 
kind are necessary in order to determine the various links among them 
and to bring to light other structural aspects. 
First of all, existential structure calls for form and implies some of its 
elements. It is in their form that beings are distinct one from another. 
We shall start our inquiry by a perusal of the formal and existential 
aspects of beings. As for matter, although it is the most fundamental 
element, it is also the last to be defined. The analysis of form, however, 
already formulates the fundamental concepts of matter and form. 
According to Ingarden, the idea of existence necessarily contains the 
indication that it is the existence of something. Of the two questions 
raised by existence (1, "Does a being actually exist in any sense?" and 
2, "Which is the mode of existence of a being which prescribes its 
essence or its idea as possible for that being, without considering whether 
it exists or notT'), only the second is specifically ontological; the first 
belongs to the various sciences or to metaphysics. A being's existence 
cannot, generally speaking, be grasped; it is a particular flash of its 
fullness of Being; in agreement with Kant, Ingarden considers that it is 
'kein reales Praedikat'. Nevertheless, and it is here that Aristotelian at-
tempts to link existence to the structure of beings finally materialize, 
existence is revealed to be deeply rooted in the structural complex of 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
267 
beings, and its structural foundations differ one from another in relation 
to the modes in which it crystallizes. 
The concern to distinguish and define the various modes of existence 
is peculiar to contemporary philosophy, and this concern culminates 
in the attempts to elucidate the particularity of the mode of real existence 
made by thinkers such as Husserl, Hedwig Conrad-Martius,13 Nicolai 
Hartmann,14 E. Souriau. 15 However, Ingarden's undertaking in this 
respect deserves particular attention, precisely in so far as it seeks the 
explanation of existence-in-its-modes in the ultimate reasons of the 
structure of beings taken in their totality. 16 For while it is the expression 
of the structural totality of a being, its mode is different according to 
whether we are dealing with real beings, ideal beings, intentional beings, 
etc. These modes of existence may be grasped and compared if one takes 
as point of departure the existential moments with which they are built. 
Indeed, any particular mode of existence is made up of various existential 
moments, in accordance with the aprioric laws of connection and exclusion. 
The existential moments may be perceived through a higher order 
of abstraction. 
One fact is significant for the process of Ingarden's thinking: 
existential analysis offers us a first approach to the structure of beings. 
From this structure, we see taking shape the concepts of possible relations 
between them. It thus represents an initial progress in the implementation 
of the project which prompted Ingarden's endeavor. For he believes 
that the failure of all attempts to establish a relationship between the 
existence of the real world and pure consciousness is caused by the fact 
that the concepts presiding over the search for this relationship - 'depen-
dence' or 'independence', 'existence', 'world', 'consciousness', etc. - have 
never been defined with sufficient accuracy. 
Now, the ontological analysis of existence reveals not only that there 
are several kinds of existence, according to the different structural types 
of beings, but also that the concept of 'dependence' assumes various 
forms which come into focus in the light of the existential structure of 
beings. In point of fact one can distinguish four pairs of existential 
moments. What is then, finally, the meaning of the concept of'dependen-
ce'? Clearly it is a notion bearing on eJCistence. It therefore materializes 
in the existential moments and is differentiated according to the 
features of existential autonomy, distinction, originality, dependence, 

268 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
and their opposites. Ingarden consequently believes that this concept 
has its roots in the internal structure of beings. 
Without going into details, we will say, e.g., not only that existential 
originality is defined by the fact that nothing else but the being itself can 
create itself, but also that it is precisely its essence, i.e., a specific 
structural complex, which is immanent to it, that would be the ultimate 
stimulus of its creation. Its essence precludes the possibility of its 
destruction, and if its exists, its essence precludes the possibility that its 
existence might come to an end. - In the same way, existential derivation 
resides in the lack of a similar essence, which does not preclude the 
creation of the being in question by another. - It is through the nature of 
its essence that an original being must be endowed with the immutable 
and eternal characteristic of existence, and thus with the "existential 
optimum" of an Absolute, a concept under which God was presented 
in the history of philosophy, whereas, the essence of a derived being 
shows an imperfect existence which derives from it own essence, and 
does not give it a perfect consolidation if its being in itself; the result 
of this is an infirmity, a fragility of existence. 17 
In the case of existential distinctiveness and connectiveness, it is also 
through the very structure of a being either that it must necessarily 
coexist within a single complex with other beings, (the color red, for in-
stance, must necessarily coexist with other properties of a being, like 
extension) or that the real essence of a being in no way requires its 
coexistence with another being; this essence allows it to be sufficient 
unto itself. Ingarden distinguishes several kinds of possible connections, 
according to the aprioric laws governing the relationships between the 
different structures. To these existential moments are to be added the 
concepts of existential dependence and independence based on the same 
principle. The existential independence of a being arises from the fact 
that, in virtue of its very essence, it can remain in existence without 
the help of another being, while its essence may require, in order that the 
being may continue to remain in existence, the assistance of another 
specially determined being. It is then a case of relative dependence, but 
when a being is determined by any essence, Ingarden speaks of absolute 
dependence. 18 
However, the most striking example of this specific character of 
existential moments is offered by the concepts of existential autonomy 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
269 
and heteronomy. In the final analysis, autonomy is defined by the fact 
that a being is determined exclusively by properties which are immanent 
to it. As an example, Ingarden gives "red in itself", which is autonomous 
is so far as it contains within itself the properties which make it what it is; 
as an example of existential heteronomy, we could take a character of a 
novel, all of whose properties originate in the positional acts of the author 
and may be changed by him, since a heteronomous being does not 
have within itself immanent properties which would make it what 
it is. 
At first sight, these existential moments seem to express relationships. 
Existential distinctiveness, 
for 
instance, 
seems 
to 
signify 
the 
distinctiveness of a being in relation to another. 
This interpretation however would constitute a misapprehension of 
the dynamics and direction of Ingarden's thinking. On the contrary, 
ontology shows us precisely that a large number of concepts which we 
are in the habit of considering as relations are but the expression of the 
particular structure of beings. Ingarden emphasizes that a relation can 
exist only between two or more beings, whereas existential distinctiveness, 
for instance, concerns one single being; it expresses the nature of its 
structure based on its essence; this character is that of its structural 
sufficiency, neither requiring nor allowing a relationship of coexistence 
with another being. Similarly, existential originality means a specific 
feature of the structure of a single being, also based on the structure of 
its essence, this feature precluding that it be part of a relation qua "being 
created" by another. But would not the opposite concept, that of 
existential connectedness, then express a relation between two beings 
which must by nature coexist within one and the same whole? An answer 
to this question obtrudes itself, and it arises from the fundamental 
intuition which informs Ingarden's thinking. For coexistence is nothing 
more than the very quality of the structure of these two beings which is 
precisely that it does not allow their distinctiveness. 
Except for those which exist between distinct beings, it seems that all 
other relations hinge on the intrinsic structure of each being in particular 
and thus are identical with structural links. 
Thus existential moments, although they are not relations themselves, 
nevertheless indicate relations existing between beings, and those into 
which the structure of beings allows them to enter. 

270 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
It should be noted in passing that, starting from the elucidation of the 
various modes of existence by means of existential moments, not only 
the concepts of the relations possible between the wodd and pure 
consciousness are elaborated, but we eliminate according to the aprioric 
laws, also a number of relations as impossible; this constitutes a 
considerable progress in Ingarden's ontological investigation. 
Time taken in the concrete sense, is also established in the concrete 
structure of beings. Temporality thus assumes an 'objective' quality, 
but in a highly original sense consonant with Ingarden's fundamental 
idea. As we shall see in our subsequent argument to have founded time 
within the ontological structure of real objects plays a crucial role in 
Ingarden's vast outline of the philosophical reconstructions. Refusing 
to consider time as a framework in which beings would necessarily 
take their place, Ingarden does not on the other hand seek, as did Hussed, 
the explanation of duration and of the temporal phases of the present, 
the past and the future in absolute subjectivity and in time's constitutive 
power. Hussedian temporality as congenital with life-world constitution 
is restricted by Ingarden to the man's life proper. 19 Furthermore, this 
temporality looming up from the structural consideration of beings 
should not be taken in the sence of the 'objective' time of nature and 
objects; Hussed sees it in this light when he distinguishes it from the 
phenomenological time of pure lived experience. 20 This is not so since 
beings, which constitute the immediate object of Ingarden's ontology, 
are not 'natural objects'. Consequently, just as structures of beings - the 
object of ontology - are ideal structures, aprioric principles for the 
natural and ideal objects (should they exist), their temporality, although 
coinciding neither with Hussed's transcendental temporality nor with 
Kant's formal temporality, is an aprioric temporality, i.e., one that is 
perceived in the form ofa pure possibility; time may be grasped through 
the existential moments. 21 
In point of fact, the nature of temporal existence, as well as that of 
supra temporal existence, may be grasped either by the existential 
narrowness of temporal beings (living individuals or inanimate things 
which are doomed to perish) or by the widening of limits from the present 
to eternity, which Ingarden calls existential breadth. In addition, temporal 
beings and real beings whose essence implies their contingency are 
characterized by an existential fragility which stands in contrast with the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
271 
existential solidity of supra-temporal existence. 
The realm of the ideal remains free from any temporal aspect. 
However, by the very fact that temporal existence may be reduced to 
existential moments and is thus deeply anchored in the structure of beings, 
the latter's essence may be viewed, as we shall see, as factor of temporal 
independence; also, while sometimes being the source of an active 
resistance to destruction (case of living individuals), it nevertheless allows 
them to be broken in their being. 
Thus temporality now means submission to change, in the case of 
beings of nature, now the structural genesis of a being, stretching over 
the various phases of its progressive development (case of a process), 
now a punctual instantaneity as in the case of events which do not 
'last' . 
These considerations foreshadow certain later developments concern-
ing the analysis of the ideas which, by bringing all the problems of the 
nature and evolution of the world to the structural aspect, make it 
possible to elucidate intelligibly certain phenomena usually considered 
irrational, and succeed in giving us a rational view of the world in the 
fullness of its fluctuations. 
As we have already noted, existential moments are useful in explaining 
the modes of existence. What does this explanation consist in? Ingarden 
defines the modes of existence in accordance with the aprioric laws of 
connection and exclusion. 21a While we cannot enter into the presentation 
of the modes of existence, which relate to 'absolute' existence, 'ideal' 
existence, 'real' existence and 'simply intentional' existence, a doubt 
arises: "What is this ontology in which the concepts of existence are 
constructed in reference to aprioric laws and from moments formed into 
pairs, all subject to the principle of identity?" In other words: "Might 
this ontology not be a form of logic in disguise? Might the so-called 
'ontological' laws not simply be those of discursive thinking?" Perhaps 
we should answer that the reason why the ultimate laws governing 
ontology are the same as the laws of logic is that the links between the 
elements of the contents of ideas are the source of the intelligibility of 
being; from these links are derived logical laws, even if this origin is 
ignored. In this sense, we might say that here again Ingarden seems to 
oppose the views of Husserl, for whom the origin of logical laws is to be 
found ultimately in the aprioric laws of constitutive consciousness. 

272 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Nevertheless, should we dig deep enough into the Husserlian conception 
of transcendental constitution with its subjacent assumptions, we would 
find that, concerning the aprioric laws, Husserl's constitutive and 
Ingarden's rationale coincide and result in the same difficulties. 
2. Fundamental Concepts of Form and Matter 
The differentiation of various modes of existence has pointed out toward 
differentiation of types of beings. However, the meaning and scope of 
the distinction between these types of beings become fully apparent only 
when their analysis is carried out with the help of the fundamental 
concepts of matter and form. Ingarden distinguishes autonomous 
individual beings (real or ideal), processes, simply intentional beings and 
states of affairs, whose structure comes into focus on the basis of the 
concepts of matter and form. 
The ontological concepts of matter and form are substantially different 
from the Aristotelian concepts. To start with, Ingarden considers them 
in concreto, as they appear in the content of the ideas. This allows him 
to go beyond the speculative level on which Aristotle's ideas were 
elaborated. In the view of the Greek philosopher, matter and form are 
correlative, although heterogeneous, so that one may wonder how 
together they can form a being. It is true that in Aristotle's thinking the 
unqualifiable raw material - pure potential - can, thanks to form - the 
act - be realized in a concrete being; whereas Ingarden, who limits 
himself strictly to what is revealed by beings, will attempt to develop a 
conception of matter and form in such a way that these two elements 
may together constitute a being, and this without necessity for any 
explanatory theory. For him, form should, generally speaking, be under-
stood as being radically "non-qualitative - but holding that which is 
qualitative"; Ingarden gives as examples "the fact of determining 
something", or "of being the subject of properties". 
The Aristotelian concept of form considered as a determining element 
(Moerp~) and its particular case, "being a property of something" 
( 7lolov elvat), as well as two other special cases, "the constitutive 
nature of something" (tl etVat) and the "essence of something" 
( to tL ~v elvat ) take on the role of the secondary form in Ingarden's 
analysis. 22 
All modem philosophy, however, is united in its violent reaction 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
273 
against "speculative and deductive preconceptions", against the "logical 
preconception peculiar to Scholasticism", and rejects the hidden, quasi-
mysterious elements which should 'constitute' a being and which nothing 
allows us to 'see'. But Ingarden's ontology goes beyond the restrictive 
claims of empirical knowledge; this is why, contrary to positivism's 
conception of individual beings, Ingarden shows the opposition which 
exists between the meanings of these two statements: "This is a red ball" 
and "This is something red, round, polished, etc." This 'something' 
means to Ingarden a complex of particular elements contained in the red 
ball, knowledge of which is implied in the second statement. For if this 
conception - according to which a being is only a class of particular 
elements - were justified, an enumeration of these elements or properties 
should be enough to distinguish this being in its individual nature from 
other beings, on the basis of various processes taking place within it 
and building its 'history'. It is however all too evident, that a conception 
giving equal weight to all the elements of a being could not grasp the 
highly complex circumstances present within that being. Furthermore, 
would such a conception be enough to separate it clearly from all other 
beings, as it is obvious in science, naive knowledge and praxis itself? 
The proponents of this conception, therefore, asserts Ingarden, tacitly 
assume something else in beings: it is already clear what its role should be. 
But form is always inseparable from matter. As for the latter, Ingarden 
sees in it "that which is qualitative in the widest sense" of the term. The 
Aristotelian conception according to which matter is considered to be 
devoid of any determination, but underlying determination (v).1), 
V7l0Xel!1FJ'0}') with its special case, "subject of properties qualitatively 
determined in its nature", constitutes the case of secondary matter. 
In addition to these two fundamental notions, Ingarden distinguishes 
form and matter as technical rational concepts. In this context, form III 
means the order of the parts in a whole, and its special case would be the 
organic form. On the other hand, matter III would be all the parts of a 
whole. These concepts play a particularly important role in the ex-
planation of the structure of 'superior' beings, i.e., composed of a certain 
number of distinct beings. 
Ingarden also formulates the concepts of the various types of unity 
by which matter and form may be linked within the beings they constitute. 
These forms of unity vary in relation to the structural elements of forms 

274 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
and matters and, beyond them, in relation to the various types of beings. 
To state the matter more fully, it is in terms of the various types of 
primary form and matter which these types allow and require that the 
structural types of beings appear either more concentrated in their mode 
of existence, and thus insensitive to change (as is the case for ideal beings), 
or less coherent and therefore allowing for properties acquired from 
the outside and for processes which disaggregate them within their 
being and which are a reason for their mutability (as is the case for real 
beings). This will become clearer in the light of essential analysis. 
Thanks to the accurate formulation of the fundamental ontological 
concepts - existential, formal and material - as they have just been 
summarized, Ingarden's thinking, without introducing any element 
which might imply a break, appears capable of grasping the most tangible 
aspect of the world, as it is most familiar to us in its strictly rational 
mechanism. 
Chapter IV 
THE IDEALISM-REALISM PROBLEM -
THE GROUNDWORK 
Ontologico-existential analysis having defined the concepts of the 
possible relations between the real world and pure consciousness, the 
task of ontologico-formal analysis is to reveal the true nature of the 
very terms of this controversy. 
The analysis of the individual-autonomous being (ideal or real) is at 
the crux of ontologico-formal analyses, bearing on everything in the 
world which reveals the form of a being. The differentiation of simply 
intentional beings is now useful, first, in explicating the irreducible differ-
ences between them and individual-autonomous beings, particularly 
real beings; the decision which dictates idealism resides in the reduction 
of the latter to the former. Secondly, through analyses of the form of 
processes and states of affairs in their relations to individual-autonomous 
beings, Ingarden hopes to have explicated the ontological mechanism 
of the mobility of real beings and thus succeeds in emphasizing the 
absolute abyss which separates the existence of a real being from that 
of ideal individual beings and ideas. Finally, what is at stake in this 
controversy is precisely and essentially a more accurate definition of the 
concept of real beings. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
275 
It is indeed the formal analysis of individual-autonomous beings 
which allows the laying of the foundations for an elucidation of the form 
of the real world. First of all comes the form of an originally individual-
autonomous being. 23 
Yet we are inclined to grasp a being first in its matter, for it is matter 
which, by virtue of its particular moment (the 'nature' of a being), 
determines form. According to Ingarden,24 "an individual being is what 
its nature makes it (e.g., this table, or that man - Immanuel Kant) and 
therefore contains a particular form by virtue of which one can say, 
when pointing it out: what we have before us is the subject of the properties 
directly qualified by its nature and attended by a certain number of con-
crete properties which belong to it in proprio. Through these properties 
it succeeds in taking shape, in developing into what it is in itself; it 
extends, as it were, through them, and by this very fact expresses and 
reveals itself". These two moments of form which are distinguished in 
the abstract, "the subject of properties" and "the property of something" 
(of a certain determined being), complete each other and thus constitute 
one single fundamental form of the individual-autonomous being. It seems 
unnecessary to belabor the fact that it is the subject of properties which 
first constitutes the identical point around which are grouped all the 
properties of a being. According to Ingarden, these properties 'emanate' 
as it were from it and relate to it insofar as they are its properties, and 
beyond that subject to the being it 'represents'. 
The subject in question is, first the form in which is 'contained', as 
we have said, the specific complex of matter, i.e., 'constitutive nature', 
but it also covers the forms of the properties of that being; these forms 
are 'filled' by matter, and concrete properties thus complete the 
constitutive nature. 
The subject with the range of completing properties comprises the 
most general to the most individual features. Thus Ingarden can say that 
"an individual-autonomous being constitutes, in this complete deter-
mination, a totality, a whole, not in the sense in which we see an 
opposition between 'a whole' and its 'parts', but in an entirely different 
sense in which it is a fullness which 'lacks nothing', all its properties being 
complete and contained entirely within it. In this fullness, the individual 
autonomous being is at once an aspect or a particular and last formation 
of Being, allowing no further differentiation: its ultimate variety". 2 5 

276 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
What is the constructive contribution of these analyses? First, by the 
fullness of its determination, the individual being shows itself to be 
distinct from the simply intentional being, which contains 'undeter-
minable' empty loci. Next, this fullness delimits the individual being by 
its distinctive matter, which is different from that of any other being, in 
every respect. As such, an individual being is entirely self-contained. 
Existential distinctivity implies this structural status. It is noteworthy 
that this concrete ontological analysis of the structure of an individual 
being seems to have switched the problem of individuality to the 
specific complex of this structure, in opposition to the philosophical 
tradition which sought it in a particular element or in a principle. 
Finally, this characteristic of plenitude and perfect self-limitation of 
the individual-autonomous being (which makes the difference between 
an individual being and an idea) emphasizes the abyss between ideas 
and real beings, makes more acute the puzzle of the relationship between 
them. But at this point one must not forget another formal moment of 
the structure of an individual-autonomous being, i.e., its simplicity. 
For the formal role of a subject of properties in relation to the structure 
as a whole is to form the individual being, or to qualify it in itself and only 
in itself. This structural 'simplicity' precludes that the individual being 
could be confused with ideas or simply intentional beings, which reveal, 
as we have already noted, a duality in their structure. 
Besides, real beings are 'individua1' insofar as, starting with the most 
general constitutive elements, they progressively descend the scale of 
generality and singularity of their properties down to the last variety of 
what can be most specific, thus representing the most complete realization 
('incarnation') of the various properties which are possible in Being. 
Whereas an idea, which contains only general properties, is itself general 
(and not individual), as HusserI has justly noted. 
To conclude these distinctions between the various aspects which 
Being can assume, let us add that pure qualities such as 'red per se' have 
no form demarcating them in relation to other form of beings so as to 
make them distinct from the latter; on the contrary, they need to be 
completed by other similar moments, so as to be for instance the 'moment 
of color of something', of an apple or a painting. Consequently they are 
not beings. 
At this level of analysis, one can already see in outline the full picture 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
277 
of the forms, of the moments of Being in their complexity, resulting in the 
fullness of the universe of beings. But the key to a full understanding of 
this 'mechanism' of interpenetration, complementarity and or-
ganization of the elements of this universe is reserved for the form of the 
real world. Indeed, the analysis of causal relations is the subject of a 
volume following the controversy. Nevertheless, there are the forms of 
processes and states of things, insofar as they relate to the essence of 
individual-autonomous beings, that provide us with fundamental 
points of reference by indicating the point at which the apparently 
static structure of beings becomes the principle of their mobility and, as 
we shall see, the analysis of the causal structure of the world relies upon 
this fundamental ontological mechanism. 
We will be unable to understand the essential significance of the 
preceding analyses unless we reach the apex of the structure of individual-
autonomous beings, which is their essence. 26 One must go back to the 
essence in order to grasp the principle in relation to which an individual-
autonomous being may be at rest or in motion, or may suffer and impinge 
on other beings. Then it stretches within domains or regions of beings. 
The nature of an individual being is hidden it its innermost recesses; and 
its properties, superimposed one on another in layers, not only prevent 
access to this nature, but above all lead to the fact that only a part of the 
structure of an individual-autonomous being can participate in the 
existence and the fate of other beings. The following question arises: 
how can they 'take part', i.e., fit into a movement? It is reserved for the 
function of the essence, which only individual beings possess, to ulti-
mately organize this being and to 'determine its fate'. This is a position 
absolutely opposite to an Eleatic view of the world. How is 'essence' to 
be understood, however? There have been so many different conceptions 
of essence throughout history, and it is indicative of the confusion in 
which the various problems find themselves in classical philosophy, notes 
Ingarden, that epistemological attitudes are the basis for these different 
conceptions. 
Now, to start with, the essence of an individual-autonomous being is 
as concrete as the being itself. It constitutes this being's structural nucleus, 
made up of properties immanent to the being; this is, incidentally, the 
reason for which only an individual-autonomous being can have an 
essence. One fact depends mainly on the role of the essence which we 

278 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
have indicated: the essence implies both qualities and potentialities. 
Indeed, contrary to the conception usually ascribed to Aristotle, accord-
ing to which the essence contains only actual qualities, Ingarden's 
ontological analysis reveals that the essence also possesses potential 
capabilities which allow the individual being constituted by it to have 
certain properties under certain circumstances, and it is due to the 
potential elements of the essence that certain processes among its 
structural elements can unfold. 
As a structural nucleus, the essence extends to the most varied, diverse 
moments of the being which it defines. It plays not only the role of the 
beings intrinsic mechanism but, as we will see later on, as a center of its 
concatenations with other beings. It is through the choice of the elements 
which it contains - now matter alone, now the moments of matter and 
form, now the existential moments also - that the ascendency of the 
essence over the being which it constitutes differs in the various types of 
beings. 
When the essence contains a particular primary matter, a primary form 
indicated by the complete matter, and in addition a choice of existential 
moments characteristic of both and strictly linked to them, the internal 
bonds between the elements of a being which the essence constitutes then 
reach their maximum intensity. All would thus be rational within that 
being, since everything would be linked by bonds of necessity. The 
nature of this being could even appear as necessarily monadic, i.e., 
allowing only a single concretization; moreover, it would be a 'structural 
quality'. 
The notion of 'structural quality' plays a major role in Ingarden's 
conception. He understands by that term a certain number of complex 
qualities, at once indivisible and irreducible, which are however a syn-
thesis of a certain number of more simple elements. Structural quality 
thus contains these more simple elements synthetically and can indicate 
them with certainty. For example, the flight of a swallow is for Ingarden 
a highly specific irreducible quality; based on a large number of par-
ticular movements from which it is however distinct, it still indicates 
them with a perfect necessity. 
Thus, when the nature of a being which belongs to its essence is a 
structural quality, it indicates various elements with necessity: (a) A 
complex of radically distinctive properties, necessarily coexisting with 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
279 
that nature in a harmonious unity; (b) A specific complex, which can only 
be concretized once, of formal moments constructed on the basis of 
fundamental form I; (c) A specific mode of existence of that being, which 
again can only be concretized once ; (d) It would allow no other properties 
than those necessarily indicated by the nature of the being, neither 
acquired properties nor those, more arbitrary still, which are externally 
conditioned. 27 
It seems unnecessary to insist on the fact that this essence would 
constitute a being endowed with maximum internal cohesion, by virtue 
of its rationality, and with an existential optimum, such as we have 
indicated for supra-temporal existence; such a being would be the 
Absolute being, or 'God'. 
In the case of ideal and real individual beings, however, the essence 
has less of a hold. Let us take, for instance, the case of ideal beings: 
in them the essence, although containing the constitutive nature in the 
form of structural quality (which indicates a certain number of absolutely 
distinctive properties, a certain type of formal elements, a certain type 
of the mode of existence), not only allows an infinite number of con-
cretizations, but also does not make their existence necessary. However 
this essence does not admit acquired and externally conditioned proper-
ties, which makes the ideal being immutable. It is precisely on this point 
that the types of essence capable of constituting a real being differ. First, 
they are much less coherent. The purely material essence contains only 
the constitutive nature with all the properties which are equivalent to it. 
In particular cases the essence, although not including them, indicates 
certain moments of form and existence, for instance when it determines 
whether we are in the presence of processes or temporal beings. In the 
latter case, although these beings possess absolutely distinctive proper-
ties, these properties are not indicated by their essence. Moreover, in 
these beings in which the essence allows absolutely distinctive properties, 
these are not indicated by their essence. Furthermore, it is in these beings 
that the essence allows acquired and externally conditioned properties. 
There now comes to light, in its full scope, the function of that crucial 
center which essence constitutes in a being and which we have already 
indicated. Indeed, the essence not only dictates for the most part the 
structure of the being, but also - by allowing a certain flexibility of the 
structure in the case of a real being - becomes the ultimate principle of 

280 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
its development. For as soon as it is possible for occasionally acquired 
properties to follow one another in real beings, interrelationships with 
other beings can be understood and one can foresee the possibility of 
their integration into the world. The explanation of these interrelation-
ships only becomes possible, however, through the existing link between 
acquired properties and processes. 28 
The essence of a real being, leaving open within this being a certain 
margin of arbitrariness, allows some of its elements to become a basis 
for certain processes and, beyond this, gives the being mobility, which 
in the final analysis is expressed in the succession of acquired properties. 
What is more, on the basis of these properties, a large part of the real 
being gains mobility through a slow succession of its qualities. 
Indeed, what does the temporality of a real being mean, except this 
submission to action and passion - both of which may be brought to 
the structures of real beings - a submission expressed by the existential 
moment of frailty? 
Are this frailty and the exiguity of existence, the second feature of 
temporal existence, not due to the fact that the existence of a real being 
follows and expresses its unavoidable internal disaggregation through 
the processes? 
Finally, in the last analysis, this submission to action and passion goes 
along with the feature of existential derivation of the real being; this being 
can be loosened in its form only insofar as it does not contain within 
itself its existential foundation. 
In summary, by introducing the processes within the structure of real 
beings, founding them in this structure - Ingarden succeeds in grasping 
and explaining, concretely and intelligibly, the mechanism of both motion 
and rest. 
The essence of a real being takes part in its evolution; it can, in fact, 
in the processes which unfold within a being, to a certain degree change 
in its properties. These changes would be indicated as possible by its very 
structure. The evolution of the beings of nature - its typology - offers us 
an example. 
In view of this opening to change and motion of this, at first sight, 
static structure, will it be possible to determine the limits between 'being' 
an 'becoming'? Indeed, this problem, as we will see, becomes crucial in 
the questions raised by the identity of a being through time. Here it is 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
281 
enough to emphasize the importance of linking together the structure of 
the autonomous individual with that of a process and an event. This 
intertwining as the basis for the mechanism of motion introduces us into 
the central issue: "Is the world as a region of objects, discontinuous or 
linked together into one system?" 
This highly important question, as we will see, is finally to be brought 
back again to form and essence. It appears that a certain number of 
formal elements, while ensuring the identity of a being through time, 
set a certain limit to its mutability. 
It is remarkable that even the stages of disaggregation of a real being 
are revealed, prove intelligible and are emphasized with reference to the 
nature of the essence, to the extent that this nature is but a qualitative 
mixture devoid of cohesion. 
In the final analysis, not only the great problems of the one and the 
many, of the same and the other, of rest and becoming but also those of 
temporality, generation and corruption, problems until now gropingly 
explored in a speculative fashion, seem to refer in their nature to the 
essence, radiant center of rationality. Thus the ontological analysis un-
doubtedly would have laid down a gigantic wealth of clear notions and 
distinctions for philosophical reflection. However, the question arises 
whether a strictly rational mechanism of order suffices to account for 
reality. 
The major question arises: "How far has the Idealism/Realism issue 
advanced towards its solution?" To investigate it we must first consider 
the formal ontological conception of the world and its counterpart, con-
sciousness, in the antithetic situation as Ingarden envisaged it at the 
start, and the formal possibilities of their relations that the confrontation 
of the two, according to the laws governing the existential concepts of 
relations, allows. 
Then, through the inquiry into Ingarden's study of intentional origin 
of noemas putting into contradistinction the noemas of purely subjective 
origin and virtue and those indicating a transcendence with respect to 
strictly subjective laws of formation -
that is, the distinction, so 
precious in his perspective, between real and purely intuitional objects -
we will pursue his progress further through the causal structure of the 
empirical world and finally through man's action within it. But the point 
to which Ingarden applies himself is the establishment of the unity of the 

282 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
heterogeneous domains of the world in a way that accounts for its being 
one consistent region of beings; the crucial issue emerges: "in terms of 
what is such a unity established?" 
Did, however, Ingarden's gigantic effort and scrupulous faithfulness to 
disentangle the knots of the rational substructure of the great discourse 
concerning man and his universe suffice to avoid the intricacies and 
pitfalls of the approaches and issues he aimed at clarifying? 
As we will see, already in order to arrive at a formal grasp of the 
world and consciousness certain issues which emerged from the previous 
analysis of types of objects have to be considered. Indeed, on the side of 
the world, it is the question of the unity or the disparity among the 
domains into which the heterogeneous types of objects enter that take a 
paramount importance. 
PART II 
THE UNIVERSAL SEQUENCE OF OBJECTS AND 
THE PROBLEM OF ACTUAL EXISTENCE 
Chapter I 
THE REAL WORLD AND THE HUMAN MONAD/SOUL 
Concatenation of Objects as the New Foundation 
of the Idealism-Realism Controversy 
1. The New Configurations of the Elements of Great Philosophical 
Problems 
As we have seen, the distinction of the basic types of a priori possible 
objects, irreducible to each other in their respective existential modes 
has, first of all, laid down cornerstones of a universal order. Second, we 
find there the foundation for approaching the nature of the real world 
and of consciousness, the two protagonists of the controversy and the 
central point of the phenomenological interest in general, and the basic 
set of principles according to which the further inquiry may be outlined. 
The analysis of the formal ontological structures of possible objects can 
then be considered as the first - and maybe decisive - step of this inquiry. 
With the crucial question which occurs next: "What type of objects the 
real world and consciousness might be?" the great issues traditionally 
belonging to epistemology and metaphysics are unfolded. Their elements, 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
283 
present already in the preceding analysis, enter into configurations 
differentiating Ingarden's position with respect to both the traditional 
philosophy and to Husserl's. The great philosophical debate then which 
is pursued by Ingarden, first upon the ground of formal ontology, then 
with an excursion into what we would like to see as, 'material', ontology 
- in which Ingarden establishes his original position with respect to these 
issues - may be seen as the second step of his inquiry. 
Indeed, the question concerning the formal structure of the real world 
and of consciousness cannot be approached straightforwardly. In Ingar-
den's analysis the question of the real world is essentially connected with 
that of the nature of the real individual object, since it occurs on the 
basis of their intertwinings as the possible form binding together their 
totality. Consequently, the ontological form of the real world has to be 
investigated from the point of view of possible concatenations and 
existential interweaving among individual objects. As for pure conscious-
ness, the forms of the acts, the stream of consciousness, the ego, the soul 
and body have to be investigated as distinctive objective forms. In this 
perspective the question of forms of a 'higher' existential order occurs, 
and is formulated on the basis of the intrinsic structure of objects and 
their possible interconnections with other objects which it entails. 
In fact, after having established the cornerstones of a universal order 
of objective forms, what could be the next step of an investigation 
except the cluster of problems concerning their ties? Especially, since 
the analysis of objects indicates that there might be specific existential 
ties among objects of the same type. But what about objects of funda-
mentally different types? Do their virtualities imply that they have to 
stay together within one unified schema or that they have to be 
chaotically dispersed? If unified, are their ties continuous or discrete? 
What types of links would hold them together? Should the distinctive 
objects constitute distinctive and separated domains? What - if any -
would be the possible existential connections among them? 
Husserl, who seems to have first sought one principle that could unify 
all possible regions of objects into a homogeneous, continuous system, 
disregarding their respective distinctive existential status, brought them 
all to the state of purely intentional objects, constituted by transcendental 
consciousness. In a radical contrast Ingarden forestalls, as a measure of 
prevention against any type of reductionism, two ontologico-formal 

284 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
principles as keys to the structural existential interweaving of objects, 
which at once account for their possible belonging to the same existential 
realm and guarantee their possible existential independence. The first 
may be seen in the irreducible element of the essence which at one 
extreme of its structural coherence ensures to the respective object its 
specific existential autonomy with respect to other objects; then, through 
the several degrees of variation in this coherence, the essence at the same 
time may ground their belonging to the same region as well as their 
interrelations within it. Anticipating our subsequent exposition, we may 
accordingly mention that at least the following autonomous regions of 
objects appear within the Ingardenian universe: the region of ideal 
objects, the world as the region of real individual objects, and the region 
of the heteronomous, purely intentional objects - works of art and 
culture, language and linguistic products, etc. 
The role of the second key to the structural-existential intertwining 
of objects, that is, of the conception of 'transcendence', is to express 
the combination of structural moments of an object, so that it allows it 
to be existentially rooted within another type of objects and yet 
guarantees its intrinsic irreducibility to it, e.g., not only the purely 
intentional objects but also the pure ego with respect to the soul/person. 
With the help of these two structural principles Ingarden outlines 
a vast structural network of existential connectedness among various 
elements of possible objects as ties into two central knots: the region 
of the real world and the soul/monad. 
As we progress in unrolling the intricacies ofthis original philosophical 
conception we will outline our critical argument. 
In fact, we will come to ask, whether, having taken all the above 
mentioned methodological precautions to avoid the reductionary one-
sidedness of any specific approach (in particular of the epistemological 
one) and trusting that the ontological structure of things and beings will 
let them speak for themselves alone, Ingarden did not inadvertently run 
into the nest of great metaphysical questions; how then is he seeking to 
disentangle them? 
Our critical argument with Ingarden's enterprise of the phenomenolog-
ical reconstruction of the human universe will run in three major lines: 
(1) "Is the structural 'transcendence' reaching beyond the correlation: 
Intentional system / ontological structure?" 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
285 
(2) "Does the formal-ontological sequence of objects /beings/ reach 
the empirical realm?" 
(3) "Can action, as conceived by Ingarden, be the key to the unity of 
the sequence of being and the gate to actual existence?" 
2. The Domain afthe Real World Rooted in the Existential Web of Real 
Objects 
The question after the possible universal form that would tie together 
all real individual objects arises already from the ontologico-formal 
analysis, bringing into existential interconnectedness their three basic 
types, that is, events, processes, and autonomous individual objects, 
as entering sidewise into each others' formal-existential structure. Let 
us recall that the existential temporality of the real individual object 
spreading itself out through the phases of the present, the past and the 
future depends upon the processes and events which bring in motion and 
change. By the same stroke they relate one real autonomous individual 
object to others, participating in the same events and processes. 
However, what are the reasons for seeking a specific form to interlace 
all the possible multiplicity of objects so intertwined other than the es-
sential fragments of their unifying mechanism? Do they not guarantee 
both flexibility and order? Furthermore, should the totality of real 
individual objects demand with necessity a peculiar organizing and 
regulating framework, what could it possibly be? 
Considering that the basic types of objects fall under the universal 
form of the "objective thinghood" (Gegenstiindlichkeit), should, in this 
analysis everything that exists appear in the basic form of an 'object'p9 
Or, on the contrary, in the case of the world-order, may we deal with an 
abstract class-ordering? This latter allows for all types of objects to 
participate in the same class, remaining radically different in their 
respective forms, disjoint, without entailing intrinsic linkage among 
them. The answer to these questions is to be found already within the 
structural implications of the ontological analysis. Indeed, the intrinsic 
mechanism of the ontological foundation of being and becoming 
would not bear its fruits unless a certain regularity of the becoming 
in its progress could be established. Furthermore, the linkage among 
real individual objects, processes and events, as well as that between 
the work of art as heteronomous with respect to the subjective processes, 

286 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
already indicates that it is a world-order coming from within the 
existential interweaving of objects that is called for. By this we mean 
the structural basis for that order as being laid down within the nature 
of the objects themselves. We seek for the 'objective form' of their unity, 
which would set their universal regulations and eventually circumscribe 
the borderline of their existential reach. 
Since within the cluster of the mechanism interweaving the real 
objects, the autonomous individual object appears as their existential 
bearer, without which they could not have an existential status, it is 
in its structure that we have to investigate whether it contains features 
that would allow it to function as the pillar of this peculiar formal unity. 
Its intrinsic structure establishes it as existentially self reposing 
(autonomous) with clearly defined borderlines - and this in spite of an 
intrinsically founded mo bility. Will its structure maintain itself throughout 
the temporal succession of change? By maintaining it, that is, remaining 
'identical', it may be considered as the pillar of world-order; inversely, 
should there be a form of unity bringing together the world elements 
into a coherent dynamic totality? Or should its intrinsic basis be sought 
as rooted within the real autonomous individual object? That is, 
exploring the conditions of the identity of the real object persisting 
throughout temporal phases of becoming, we will outline the basic 
conditions of the world-order (or of the form of the real world) so that 
it may account for the irreducible existential status of reality and for its 
regulations. 
The investigation of the problems concerning the identity of the 
real object throughout the temporal succession (restricted to the formal-
ontological type of questions and leaving aside the epistemological 
problems which deal with the conditions of the identity of an object of 
cognition throughout the progress of the cognitive process) entails, 
indeed, three questions: (1) "What reasons are there to assume a distinc-
tive intrinsic ordering of the totality of real objects?" (2) "What con-
ditions has the real individual object to fulfil in order to be not only the 
instigator but also the basis for such an ordering 'form'?" (3) "How 
is this form of real objects responding to their intrinsic postulates con-
cerning being and becoming?" 
Coming back to the structure of real objects we have to repeat first, 
that it is directly connected with the structures of events and processes. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
287 
If by its own nature the real autonomous individual object is inter-
twined with other objects, it is due to the existential nature and role of the 
processes, since the process operates the exchange of externally con-
ditioned properties within the individual. Thereby it is the vehicle of its 
becoming, that is, the necessary condition of its temporal nature. In 
tum, since the properties, in operating their natural change, are not 
their own but belong to respective individual beings, a process may 
develop only within the radius of action/reaction among temporally 
existing objects. Consequently, interweaving within the formal-
ontological structure with other real individual objects belongs essentially 
to their very nature as temporal objects, that is, as real objects. Indeed, 
being intimately interwoven within the cluster of ties which among 
autonomous individual objects events and processes operate and which 
constitutes its history, the real individual being would remain strictly 
isolated and could not be temporal, that is, real. This history brings in 
the question of the 'domains of objects'. 
But also, inversely, could the cluster of existential connectedness 
(Seinzusammenhang) of events, processes and individual objects be 
maintained otherwise than if their 'nucleus' (Kern), that is, the real 
autonomous object, remains identically the same throughout their 
operations? 30 
Inasmuch as this cluster of existential interlacing constitutes the 
basic ontological mechanism of real objects it foreshadows already 
the network of interconnections that form the system ofthe world, which 
is then of a 'higher order' .31 The conditions which the real autonomous 
individual has to fulfil to maintain its identity are foundations for both. 
In point of fact, the additional inquiry into the structure of the real 
individual objects reveals three 'moments of identity' (ldentitiitsmomente) 
that guarantee its identical perdurance in time: 'oneness' (Einheit), 
'selfhood' (Selbst-Sein) and 'sameness' (Dieselbigkeit). They serve as 
foundation for each other and all three together ensure the autonomous 
object its continuing identity through the transformations it might 
undergo. And yet they do not constitute additional moments of the fun-
damental structural groundwork. On the contrary they are rooted, first, 
in the essence of the individual being and its constitutive nature. The 
identity of the object lasts as long as it maintains the same essence, and, 
second, its constitutive nature contains a specific cluster of unchangeable 

288 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
matters. The 'material' however, that is, the concrete properties and 
matters upon which the processes and events work, may be -
in 
agreement with the Leibnizean conception of the identity of the monad 
- completely exchanged without affecting the respective object in its 
selfhood or sameness. 
This structural nucleus (the essence, the constitutive nature and its 
specific unchangeable cluster of matters, which make the respective 
being repose in itself) is a point of difference between its existential 
status that might be called 'originary' and another formal-existential 
type of objects that would be rooted in the originary ones and present a 
'higher type' or 'order' of organisation of which in some way the 
originary objects from which they are 'derived' would in tum partake. 
The living organism would be the best example of such an arrangement. 
On the first 'originary' level of individual objects we would have living 
cells; through the processes of various types of different functional 
systems rooted ultimately in the cells would be devised the system of 
the organism as a derived and yet distinctive formal unity bringing 
them all into a higher type of organisation, distributing their respective 
roles and regulating their progress. 
In fact, does not the above discussed intrinsic nucleus of the real 
autonomous individual constitute its identity, and the cluster of events 
and processes interlacing with it as the vehicle of its spreading out into 
the existential radius of other beings devise the form of their specific 
unity? Ingarden, following Husserl, calls such a new object, derived from 
the originary ones, a 'domain of objects' (Gegenstandsgebiet). 
Moreover, considering objects of the same type we cannot fail to 
see that they make part of the same formal schema, rooted in their 
formal-structural principles and yet distinct from them and constituting 
an objective form which brings about their unity. Consequently, we 
may expect that upon the analysis of the domain as such, we might 
discover that there are several domains of objects autonomous or not, 
but irreducible to each other. The question arises: "What conditions 
should be fulfilled in order that a domain of objects may emerge?" 
Ingarden follows Husserl in this latter conception of the domain 
of objects as "die gesamte zu einem Konkretum gehorige oberste Gattungs-
einheit, also die wesentliche Verknupfung der obersten Gattungen. "32 
However he corroborates the Husserlian conception by attempting to 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
289 
establish the way in which the highest genus may imply and circumscribe 
a form unifying the manifold of objects falling under its jurisdiction, 
within the very nature of the objects. 
We have then to ask, first: "What accounts for the coherence of 
a domain?" "May objects of different existential types belong to the 
same domain?" "Are domains of objects open or closed systems, and 
what determines their borderlines?" Finally, "What relations are 
possible between two domains?" These questions refer essentially to 
conditions prescribed by the genus, which, differentiating itself through 
its constitutive elements in a discontinuous way from other genera, 
circumscribes the respective domain. Ultimately, however, these condi-
tions are to be brought back to their groundwork as laid down by the 
ontological structure of individual objects, in which the genus itself finds 
its concrete roots. 
Concerning the coherence of a domain, it is from the structure of 
individual objects, which are the 'material' from which the domain 
is built, that it depends. Two types of domains have then to be differen-
tiated. In the first place, a domain may emerge uniquely in virtue of 
the qualitative homogeneity of its constitutive elements, especially 
when they belong to the 'highest materially determined genus'. - Thus 
ideal objects constitute a specific domain. Its unity consists in their 
common structural principles. - A domain may also be founded not 
only in the individual structure of its constituents, but in their 
concatenations and the existential interrelations among themselves and 
with other types of objects belonging to the same highest genus. The 
borderlines of this type of a domain will be circumscribed by the reach 
of these interrelations. In contrast with the first type of a domain 
(founded in objects that do not dynamically intermingle with each 
other and whose relations are definitely set in an unchangeable way by 
the structural principles, and which consequently is perfectly compact) 
the second type of the domain implies necessarily a flexible coherence; 
this type of a domain corresponds to the form of unity designed through 
the intrinsic nature of the individual autonomous object as the nucleus 
of the cluster of interconnections with events and processes. 
However, there is still the question of the 'material' from which 
the domain is built to be considered. In fact, also existentially heterono-
mous objects (e.g. purely intentional objects of art, culture, language, 

290 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
social institutions, etc.) constitute distinctive domains which found 
and circumscribe their reach. Moreover, in spite of being themselves 
existentially heteronomous, the domain of objects of Art, for instance 
is, as such, an autonomous object. Here come into focus of attention 
problems of the existential dependence/independence of a domain and 
of possible interrelations among different domains and between a domain 
and an originary individual object; these are questions directly con-
cerning the eventual confrontation between the real world and pure 
consciousness aimed at in our investigation. 
The answer to these question has to be sought in the first place in the 
type of their respective coherence. 
As we have already noted, the tightest type of coherence is quaranteed 
by the existential homogeneity of objects, which not only belong to 
one and the same system of objects but also are a-temporal, that is, 
do not enter into changeable interconnections. 
In order that the flexible coherence of a domain, which is founded not 
only in the individual objects but also in their processlike concatenations, 
be accomplished, all their founding individual objects have to belong 
to the same system. This condition has to be fulfilled by their falling 
under the same 'authentic' highest genus (Gattungsverwandschaft). 
Complying with these formal conditions, the domain of the world is 
not only basically restricted to real individual autonomous beings, 
events and processes, but its borderlines are set by the system of causal 
relations, that seem to be the concrete vehicle of the existential inter-
locking among them. The constitutive nature of the real autonomous 
individual object (its material nucleus) plays simultaneously the role of 
ontological foundation of the highest genus of the real object - bringing 
all its three types together - and of the basis for the peculiar type of 
coherence of its domain. That is, its variant, 'the inexact essence', 
which accounts for the intrusion of events and processes into the 
structural system of the autonomous individual producing externally 
conditioned properties of this object, allows ipso facto a constitutive 
interplay among them, which, in tum, results in the formation of random 
pseudo-objective forms. These, maintaining themselves in existence for 
a certain period of time, lead to the formation of 'inauthentic' genera, 
which introduce into the already flexible concatenation within the objects 
of the domain of the real world, a certain 'chaos' that spreads itself 
from the one to the other of its structural segments. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
291 
Consequently, the domain of the real world, as being founded in the 
unchangeable nucleus of the existentially autonomous real individuals 
and determined in its borders by its causal network of interweaving with 
other real objects, is existentially autonomous; nevertheless it is not a 
compact system but a rather 'loose' domain. Compact domain of objects 
(e.g. of mathematical objects, of ideal objects, etc.) are both existentially 
autonomous and independent from all external factors. However, since 
the formal structure of the real world allows intrusion from the outside, 
as well as development of objects that do not fall exactly under the 
pre-established genera, no conclusion can be reached about its existential 
dependence or independence. Clarifying this issue requires material 
investigation. And yet already at this point this ambiguous situation 
may open the gate for establishing a common meeting ground between 
the real world and pure consciousness. 
The question of possible intertwining and interlacing between two 
or more domains of objects is in this perspective of paramount im-
portance. 
Having established the universal order of things and beings in their 
possible ontological structure in terms of a number of distinctive and 
existentially autonomous (or even independent) domains, Ingarden 
clarifies certains aspects of the Idealism-Realism issue but complicates 
others. In point of fact, does not the delimination of the domain of the 
real world introduce some complications into the possible formulation 
of its relation to pure consciousness? Does pure consciousness belong 
to the domain of the real world? According to the Husserlian analysis it 
certainly does not. But should it even belong? If it is of a radically alien 
type to the real individual objects it could not stay within the same 
type of connections. Should the domain of the real world be existentially 
separated from pure consciousness (whether understood as an individual 
object or as a domain)? Could they be brought into a direct confron-
tation? They could not act directly upon each other. The separation 
of the psychical from the physical realm has in the history of philosophy 
proved laden with difficulties; as we know, to bring them together in 
their respective activities a special explanatory theory was needed 
(e.g. parallelism, occasionalism, preestablished harmony, etc.). 
At this point however a fundamental decision is already imposed 
concerning the possible solutions of the Idealism-Realism controversy: 

292 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
whatever be the final formulation of this issue, the distinction of several 
domains of autonomous objects, that is, existentially irreducible to each 
other, excludes the radically monistic position of materialism and of 
radical idealism since both of them assume a homogenous existential 
unity of being, reducing all their distinctiveness, either to matter or to 
consciousness. The second decisive step in the direction of possible 
relations between the real world and consciousness is in answering the 
question whether a specifically formed plurality of autonomous objects 
would suffice to ground and build an existentially autonomous domain 
of being or whether only heteronomous regions of beings are possible. 33 
Should this latter be the case, the realistic solution of the controversy 
would be excluded. 
Ingarden's ontological distinction of not just two but several domains 
of being separated from each other (or just existentially differentiated 
as autonomous and yet possibly interdependent) offers, as it will come to 
light in the analysis of pure consciousness within its specific existential 
complex, a means to shift the emphasis from a direct confrontation 
between pure consciousness and the real world to their interlacing 
within a larger network of existential concatenations among individual 
objects as well as domains. 
However, by the same stroke, there is a network of problems emerging 
with a significance radically different from the intended one. Before we 
make an attempt at formulating their direction, we have still to stress 
that already one important link, namely that between the domain 
of the real world and that, equally autonomous, of the purely intentional 
works of Art is to be seen. In fact, the processes, due to the extension of 
their temporal phases, may link not only individual objects together but 
also complete functional systems of which the individual objects are 
bearers. For instance, the process of performance in music brings 
together, on the part of the virtuoso, his complete system of physical 
motion as well as of psychic· activities: on the side of the instrument, 
participation in the performance as the system of mobility of its parts. 
Lastly, the system of music enters into this schema through the musical 
score. 
Significantly enough, the real world remains, in spite of all, a closed sys-
tem staying within the boundaries prescribed by the highest genera and 
rooted in the constitutive nucleus of the originary individual objects. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
293 
Consequently, no radically new object could intrude into its boundaries. 
Neither could new objects be generated within it; such a generation, 
insists Ingarden, would amount to the explosion of the entire system. 35 
This is a pivotal point of Ingarden's enterprise which our criticism will 
corroborate. Human creativity understood in the strong sense as pro-
duction of radically novel and original objects with respect to the already 
present ones, is to be excluded from the real world. When in fact Ingarden 
relegates it to the intentional domain, it means that it has no real bearing 
upon reality and the real world. 
Furthermore, there is still no indication in which way the separated 
domains of ideal objects could be linked together with either the real 
world or intentional domain. And it is only in the investigation of the 
pure consciousness that Ingarden will attempt to make a headstart 
at retrieving the empirical realm, lost by Husserl, for his ontologico-
existential network. 
The question of interlacing of several systems through processes may 
prove of crucial importance, should we interpret Ingarden's probing 
inquiry as a shift from a possible direct interrelation between the real 
world and consciousness to a larger network of interweaving, stretching 
through several domains of objects, to the nature of the living, individual 
being. In fact, Ingarden has ventured already in his formal analysis of 
the world into the analysis of the living organisms by way of processes 
and systems of biological functioning. Anticipating some points of our 
argument, we may submit, that had Ingarden found a way to analyse 
and interpret the nature of specific processes and the principles of their 
intertwining inherent in the biological systems of organic functions, we 
might have expected either to find a way of an approach to the material 
nature of its mechanisms, or to establish a complete network of inter-
weaving among the domains of objects comprised within the whole 
spread of the domain of the world and that of consciousness. 
Taking up again our remarks about the surprising development of 
Ingarden's analyses, we submit that the inquiry into the ontological 
substructure of things and beings and of their organizing forms, 
originally geared to the eventual confrontation between the real world 
and pure consciousness, might have gone out of hand. In the situation 
of the apprentice-sorcerer, Ingarden might not be in position to control 
its unfolding and implications. In point of fact, the question arises 

294 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
whether the five types of originary objects do not lay down the schema of 
the universal order of being, understood in the traditional sense. Starting 
with the simplest form of the pure quality and going gradually through 
structurally more complex types of objects (real individual objects, 
purely intentional objects, ideal objects, ideas, in their respective 
differentiations) and reaching the apex of existential autonomy and 
independence in the essence of the supratemporal, Absolute Being, these 
basic types of objects designate corresponding existentially distinct and 
partly autonomous domains. 
The various domains differentiated through all the variations among 
the objects seem to outline a sequence of the UNIVERSAL ORDER of being. 
We may also detect that this sequence has a structure of its own. Does 
it not follow a line according to the principle of gradation (in existential 
dependence-independence, autonomy, complexity, etc.)? 
Within the very structure of the respective domains the question of 
their possible interconnections, that is, of continuity is implied. 
Lastly, do we not guess in the differentiation of possible domains of 
objects a tendency, intrinsic to the very structure of objects, to extend 
between the "two infinities" of Pascal through the plenitude of forms? 
This last point will come to light in the investigation of the soul/monad 
conception of man as the real autonomous individual; this concept is 
meant by Ingarden to answer the difficult questions raised by HusserI's 
"pure consciousness". 
3. Pure Consciousness within the Cluster of Existential Connections 
What is "pure consciousness"? Before we may formulate any of the 
problems which exemplify the Kantian and Husserlian difficulties of its 
relation to the reality of things and beings, "things in themselves" or 
actual existence, we must know whether we deal with a domain of objects 
(e.g. conscious acts) or with an originary object; in this latter case, we 
must determine whether it is existentially autonomous or heteronomous, 
independent or dependent, etc. The Ingardenian ontologico-formal 
method of approach in terms of fundamental structures and their con-
catenations, in a direct challenge to the HusserIian transcendental 
approach in terms of modes of givenness in immanent experience, is here 
yielding its ripe fruits. 
Approaching the question of consciousness, Ingarden is intruding 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
295 
upon the field in which his master has unfolded a vision of the philo-
sophical reconstruction of the universe of man with a penetration and a 
depth of insight unprecedented in the history of Western thought. 
Although Ingarden remains in the fold of HusserI's analytic work, the 
ontological apparatus and structural-existential groundwork of which 
we have discussed the main features, allows him, nevertheless, to dis-
entangle some of the traditionally confused structural ties among ele-
ments constituting the complexity of the conscious being and to differen-
tiate them in a fundamentally new way, so that as it has been already 
foreshadowed, the issue of individuality comes to light as the crucial 
question of the Controversy. Ingarden brings to our attention specifi-
cally the fact that HusserI, in his investigations of the originary time 
consciousness, has been aiming at explicating the ultimate origins of 
individualization through the originary constitution of time conscious-
ness. He is tempted to see in HusserI's attitude - emphasized also by 
HusserI's own comments in their conversations and correspondence of 
this period - that in HusserI's view at this time the originary constitutive 
consciousness was not individual. It is not necessary to stress the im-
plications of such a position for the idealistic decision. 36 
Bringing all the classic problems confronting pure consciousness and 
the worId to this question, which appears as the Achilles' heel of the 
entire HusserIian conception, Ingarden proposes to measure himself 
with his old master. 
The specific point at issue in this new attempt to establish the territory 
of consciousness and to acknowledge the peculiar existential features of 
its newly differentiated components with their respective existential 
functions, is whether, because of its transcendence with respect to 
emperical acts in which it is embodied, we should ipso facto consider 
pure consciousness as existentially separated from 'empirical conscious-
ness'. The existential feature of 'the transcendence' of an object with 
respect to its own existential 'bearer', which guarantees its irreducible 
existential status (when investigated on the basis ofthe structural network 
of the respective objects), might, instead of arbitrarily severing their ties, 
reinforce them. In fact, in the structural analysis of consciousness, the 
conception of "ontological transcendence" as the key-linkage between 
elements existentially dependent on others (and yet irreducibly distinct 
in their own right) will find its culminating point of application and of 

296 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
insights into the soul/body and pure consciousness. Ingarden sees in 
Husserl's lack of the ontological foundations of transcendence one of 
the reasons of his slip into the idealistic position. 37 
As Ingarden's inquiry unfolds, the majority of the great epistemo-
logical and metaphysical questions of the philosophical tradition con-
verge in this new differentiation of the complex of elements which enter 
into the existential territory of pure consciousness. Unexpectedly, for 
the phenomenological perspective, they tighten into the knot of mind-
body (soul) relations. Let us recall that in the transcendental perspective, 
wherein all types of things and being are included into the world and a 
radical separation is assumed between the 'real ego' (Seele and Geist) 
and pure consciousness, the question of the mind-body relation is con-
sidered as irrelevant. However, Ingarden sees this view as a doubtful 
predecision. 37a Indeed, the ontological analysis reveals that the material 
determination of the soul complex (the real ego, the concrete person, the 
spirit) and of the body, in which their relation is ultimately to be sought, 
might be, on the contrary, decisive for the Idealism/Realism contro-
versy. 38 Accepting consciousness as existentially derived from the body 
and assessing the existential priority of matter radically opposes materi-
alism to transcendental idealism; inversely, the latter assumes the 
existential priority of pure consciousness and, denying existential auto-
nomy to the real world, is led to understand the body as a purely inten-
tional object. Other points of decision (e.g. a possible passage from a 
realistic to a materialistic position) occur also with respect to a decision 
about such or other material determination ofthe soul and of the body. 39 
Be as it might for the solution of the controversy, this fact merits 
attention. The body-mind (soul) relation is situated in this ontological 
inquiry first within the network of existential interdependencies -
simultaneously irreducible, transcendent and distinct - among specific 
elements composing the cluster of consciousness; second, at the border-
line of the formal concatenations of their structures and their material 
completion, we might expect to find a passage from the one to the other. 
Will this expectation, which would entail also the retrieving of the 
empirical realm into the ontological sequence of the universal order, be 
fulfilled? 
Ingarden's succinct treatment of the problems concerning the nature 
of pure consciousness in its relation to the soul and the body is the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
297 
culminating point of several of his detailed and thorough investigations 
which have preceded the Controversy, especially his investigation of the 
works of art, as heteronomous objects, paralleled by that of the modali-
ties of cognitive processes of subjective human experience in which they 
are brought to 'concretion'. These investigations, which are, in the first 
place, a study of intentionality and, in the second place, an inquiry into 
its relation to ideal structures and their principles, have prepared the 
ontological differentiation of types of objects and still have a further 
bearing upon the conception of the human subject. We shall revert to 
them directly in the progress of our argument. 
Leaving aside the psychological conception of consciousness (of 
J. Locke, G. Berkeley, etc.), which as Husserl has repeatedly emphasized 
leads to a "negative petitio principii", as well as the conception of 
"universal consciousness" (e.g. Kant's and of the School of Marburg), 
Ingarden seeks an access to the concrete, living complex, within which 
the pure consciousness would have its function and its place. 
Should we have to identify consciousness with "universal conscious-
ness" as the source of the real world, which being an abstract form cannot 
be onto logically a domain of objects, and being universal is not an 
individual object, the whole issue of Idealism/Realism, as it is being 
schemed anew on the basis of ontologico-formal intricacies, would 
vanish; lacking an objective form, the consciousness could not enter in 
a direct existential relation with the domain of the real world as just 
established. 40 The correlation between the universal forms of objects 
and universal forms of subjective operations in which they are con-
stituted, which will be the center of the next step in our critical examina-
tion of phenomenology, remains nevertheless of major importance. 
Ingarden enters the investigation of consciousness through the 
Husserlian concepts of the stream of consciousness and of the conscious 
act or process (Erlebnis). Their ontological structure shows them as a 
basic set with reference to which all the other aspects and elements of 
conscious life are to be seen. In this very short account we shall con-
centrate upon the question: "How can we, from this fundamental 
mechanism of pure consciousness and through an ontological apparatus, 
find access to the 'concrete, living ego' and the 'concrete, living person'?" 
Although the stream of consciousness and conscious processes are 
existentially so complementary to each other that we could not consider 

298 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
one without the other - they constitute together one structural set - their 
unity lies in the structure of the conscious process. A singular conscious 
process is in its nature strictly separated from any other and yet in its 
material nature it is essentially subject to influences coming from other 
processes not only co-existing within the same field of present con-
sciousness, but also from those of the past, as well as, to a certain degree, 
to those foreseen in the future. It springs forth as distinctive from the 
stream of consciousness, but at the same time it becomes its constituent; 
not only because the stream of consciousness is composed from the 
singular acts, but also because the specific unity is the result of their 
spontaneous continuous material arrangement between each other and 
in relation to all the acts preceding them. From their mutual dependence 
we conclude that they are not existentially independent individual 
objects; consequently, the stream of consciousness cannot be a domain 
of objects. And yet, although the specific form of unity which it shows, 
such that it can sustain the singular conscious acts and account for their 
homogeneous nature and their linear ordering, is materially founded in 
the nature of the singular acts themselves, it is unmistakably that of 
an individual object. 
However, how can the form of the stream take care of concrete 
situations (e.g. loss of consciousness or the seeming suspension of the 
active stream of experience in sleep) in which the continuity of experience 
seems first to be disrupted and then to start anew? Do we then have each 
time a new stream of consciousness arising or is the individual form of the 
stream capable of maintaining its identity through the temporal phases 
even in adverse situations? Upon the answer to these questions depends 
the capital decision whether consciousness is a domain of objects 
(individual streams of consciousness) or something else. Bringing in the 
conception of 'living memory' as means of maintaining the continuity 
of the processlike expansion of the stream, Ingarden, in one stroke, 
throws a bridge between pure consciousness and the 'soul', by the 
conception of the 'living ego' and the 'concrete person' jthe soul. 
Living memory, an expansion of the Husserlian notion of 'retention', 
is grounded in the already mentioned intrinsic structure of singular acts 
of consciousness insofar as each actual instance of experience, gushing 
forth from the stream of consciousness in a strict separation from each 
and every other instance, grows in its material content from the retained 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
299 
'echo' (Nachklang) of past experience. This 'synthetic resume' of what has 
already fully developed in past experiences, which has been retrieved by 
the singular act, is then passed on to further incoming acts.41 
Thereby is established the continuity between the manifold of ex-
perience which maintains the continuity of its flux. In this continuity the 
identity of the stream of consciousness is founded through the temporal 
phases and their possible disruptions. Ultimately it is the basis for the 
stream's formal unity, so that all the acts springing from its center are 
bound in their very nature into a material and formal sequence building 
an 'organic' whole with all the acts that have ever emerged in this 
stream and passed. This unity Ingarden identifies with the essential 
continuity of man's personal life. 42 
Yet the unity of the stream of consciousness does not appear as exis-
tentially autonomous. It is drawing upon the originary unity (or identity) 
of the living ego (das lebendige Ich). 43 
It is through the conception of the 'living ego' that Ingarden expects 
to accomplish the passage from the pure transcendental consciousness 
to the empirical pulp in which it is concretized and which might prolong 
it further. 
Already the Kantian conception of the ego as the principle of trans-
cendental apperception contains two essential moments: (1) the persisting 
self-identity (ldentisch-selbst-verbleiben) and (2) the originary feeling of 
oneself (Sich-selbst-Fiihlen). These two moments correspond to the role 
which the ego is called to fulfil with respect to the unity of the conscious 
acts. In principle Ingarden's conception of the ego remains in avowed 
agreement with Russerl's as presented in the Formal and Transcendental 
Logic. That is, the pure ego is not meant as a real (reeles) component of 
the conscious act (noesis) or its content. Nevertheless, although it is the 
indispensable factor of the conscious act as well as of the stream of 
consciousness, since it effectuates the acts of experience (acts of thought, 
feeling, volition, etc.), and it is existentially their source of being, yet it 
is itself determined by the structure of both. 
In point of fact, the general essence of the conscious act (process) calls 
with necessity for the ego as the originary pole of reference in virtue of 
which it is an 'act': an act of the ego. It reveals thereby its existential 
dependence from the ego. 44 In tum, the ego in this function becomes 
the pole in which all the acts converge. Furthermore, it is necessary to 

300 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
distinguish also a material interlacing between the nature of the con-
scious processes and the ego. As Ingarden puts it: "The act bears in itself 
the traces of the fundamental features (Grundeigenheiten) of the ego and 
expresses them." 4 5 
But what are the fundamental features of the ego? We may, of course 
envisage it as the 'pure ego', merely an agent effecting conscious acts and 
fulfilling the above mentioned functions with respect to them. But we 
may also see it within the larger framework as the central factor of the 
complete functional network of the human being, first by conceiving it 
as endowed essentially with the peculiar structure of the human person; 
second, we may consider as our ego also "all this that comprises our 
entire human essence." 46 
Husserl in Ideas I understood the pure ego as the spring (Quellpunkt) 
from which conscious acts flow - transcendent to them - devoid of any 
determination. However, in Cartesian Meditations, as we remember, 
the ego is described as deploying in its constitutive progress permanent 
features (Habitualitiiten). They are seen, nevertheless, as 'reduced', that 
is, purely intentional, and the ego thus extended remains the purely 
intentional skeleton of the concrete features of the real person. 
Ingarden and Husserl meet upon the transcendence of the ego with 
respect to the conscious acts and the stream of consciousness. They 
conceive of it, however, in a different manner and it is in their divergent 
conception of the ego that the key lies to Ingarden's definitive surpassing 
of the Husserlian transcendental world-view and the turning-point of 
his own radically different mapping of it. 
However, will this not raise other formidable difficulties inherent in 
the phenomenological program? It will retard perhaps the progress in 
the unfolding of the great phenomenological scope. 
4. The Soul and The Body - as Experienced: A Foreboding of Material 
Ontology? 
For both Husserl and Ingarden the pure ego is not the real (reel) com-
ponent of the conscious acts. From this Husserl draws the conclusion 
that the permanent features acquired by the pure ego remain also trans-
cendent to the acts and the stream of consciousness in which they 
occurred; that is, the features of character of the person remain transcen-
dent with respect to the real person constituted in these acts. Ingarden 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
301 
raises the objection whether such a separation between the pure ego, 
representing the complete set-up of the human person from the concrete 
real person, is justified in view of the nature and origin of the permanent 
features of human character, which Husserl has overlooked. The Husserl-
ian idealistic position is challenged again at one of its most sensitive 
and decisive points. 
In fact, approached from the ontological point of view, the pure ego 
reveals existential ties and dependencies, which put this touchy matter 
on a new footing. As we have already pointed out, the pure ego con-
stitutes with the stream of consciousness a unified functional set. The 
question arises: "Does the complex of the stream of consciousness and 
the pure ego constitute a self-enclosed and existentially independent 
object?" "What is its relation to the singular features of the human 
character, which constitute the human person, or to the soul?" 
The conception of the 'soul' is basically Husserlian. It represents the 
empirical pulp of experience organized by the intentional system. How-
ever, its existential articulations allow the Ingardenian conception to 
perform a role that it could not assume within the Husserlian approach. 
The soul is understood, in the first place, as the primitive 'forces' 
which manifest themselves through conscious experience. Second, 'soul' 
is interchangable with 'person' insofar as it actualizes its forces in the 
existential growth and development of the human person. 47 The ego is, 
indeed, not drained, depleted in the performance of the conscious acts, 
nor by its function as the pole of the stream of consciousness, and this 
on two accounts: first, in agreement with Husserl, on account of its 
organizing function; then, in opposition to Husserl, on account of its 
immersion, existentially essential, into the concrete pulp of experience 
as the 'living ego' of the concrete living person. In fact, the pure ego 
appears caught into the network of existential dependencies, which show 
that (1) it is existentially drawing upon the primitive 'forces' represented 
by the 'soul'; (2) it acts as the 'axis' of the soul by distributing and 
articulating its forces into the constitution of the concrete features of 
the person into which they flow, and which at the same time are meant 
to be its own progress as the 'living, concrete' human self; (3) at last we 
may consider our self as all that which comprises our entire essence 48; 
(4) it is existentially rooted in the primitive forces of the soul as well as 
in its constituted manifestation through the concrete person, conse-

302 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
quently neither the 'pure ego' nor its functional counterpart, the stream 
of consciousness, can be considered as an existentially independent and 
originary object. On the contrary, although the pure ego reaches in its 
'transcendent' structure beyond the stream of conscious acts in which 
the person is constituted, by its very essence as both the pure and the 
concreto ego, it is supposed to reach also into the empirical, vital dimen-
sion of man as a real autonomous individual. 
The crucial reason for Husserl's idealistic position seems to be 
eliminated. 
Of even greater interest is the constructive aspect of these develop-
ments. 
In fact, starting with the structure of the basic set, conscious act/stream 
of consciousness, and following the treads of ontologico-formal and exis-
tential interdependencies, we have arrived at the compact cluster of mutu-
ally interdependent moments - the ego, the person and the soul, conscious 
act/stream of consciousness - which form together a distinctive, essential 
unity. However, Ingarden does not formulate the type of this unity as that 
of an autonomous individual being. Since in any case man - and this 
cluster of consciousness is that of man - is understood as the autonomous 
real individual (and this is a specific variation of the basic structure). 
Ingarden following Husserl - and Leibniz before him - calls this con-
scious cluster the 'monad' or the 'soul'. 49 Since the soul is meant, first 
and foremost, as the concrete 'material' and empirical foundation of the 
intentional apparatus to draw upon, to identify the human monad with 
the soul could mean a radical reversal of priorities and a ground for 
reformulating the status of intentionality. Ingarden's further expansion 
of the notion of the soul into its interdependencies with the body could 
be interpreted as a step in that direction. However, a doubt occurs 
whether the ontological network of interdependencies will reach far 
enough to recapture into its ties the empirical expansion of the merely 
formal outline of the soul. This question might become the touch stone 
of Ingarden's own enterprise. 
We are led into the notion of the body along the same network of 
formal-existential dependencies which has differentiated the cluster of 
the monads into its various moments, since the notion of the soul 
expands further than the intentional architecture that sustains it. Again 
it is with reference to the formal structure of the set conscious act/stream 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
303 
of consciousness that the formal links toward the 'body' are projected. 
Following the Husserlian distinction between the body as envisaged 
"from the outside" (der Korper), which is the object of research of 
natural science, and the body "as experienced" from the "inside" (der 
Leib), which Husserl has extensively investigated in its specific con-
stitutive form of "bodily givenness" (Leibgegebenheit) in Ideas II, this 
latter is subject of the formal-ontological analysis as experienced to 
belong integrally to the unity of ourselves. Although Ingarden's analysis 
avowedly reconstitutes here a Husserlian contribution, here as before, he 
clarifies with ever more precise and detailed ontological examination, 
some points of the possible interconnections between the stream of 
consciousness, the soul and the body as experienced. We might expect 
that they will not only indicate with necessity the natural prolongation 
of the soul into the empirical realm but also allow us to cross the 
borderline and pass into this new territory. The expansion of the schema 
of consciousness into the body, thus far only touched upon, may be 
interpreted as its material completion. Indeed, upon the investigation 
of this expansion new knots of existential relationships are tied indicating 
the need of crossing into the new realm, which the soul and the body would 
partly share; yet the formal analysis stops short of untying them. Shall 
we find other clues allowing us to enter this new territory which is 
indicated by the formal network but in essence and by all its features 
eludes it? 
Body as experienced (der Leib) enters into the system of pure con-
sciousness basically in two ways: first, as a specific complement of a 
certain type of conscious processes directly present within the structure 
of pure consciousness; second, we experience body as the medium 
through which the soul (as constitutively organized by the pure 
ego) gives expression to her processes and her life. 
The distinctiveness of the soul with respect to the other moments 
of the monadic cluster and her specific existential situation becomes 
more definite as contrasted and connected with the body as experienced. 
Once the notion of the body, indicated first by the structure of pure 
consciousness as its complement, is differentiated as a distinctive territory 
from that of the soul and yet one into which the soul seems to 
pass in merging with it, the classic issue of the body-mind/soul relations 
unexpectedly opens. The immediate questions to which, in the examina-

304 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
tion of the body, attention has to be given are: "Is the soul existentially 
independent from the body?" Or "Do they constitute together one and 
the same object wherefrom they could be distinguished only abstractly?" 
"Is one of them existentially derived from the other?" Surprisingly, 
seeking to find the existential status of consciousness did not suffice to 
establish the formal-existential connections between the pure con-
sciousness and the soul. Closing the gap between the two did not bring 
about the solution of the problem. The question of existential autonomy 
or of derivation was merely transferred and does catch up with the 
conscious system at the borderline of the formal structuration and of 
its material completion. 
To start with the first point, it is within the structure of acts of 
sensory experience that we find already a distinctive bodily aspect of 
consciousness. "Bodily sense-data" (sinnlich-leiblichen Empfindungs-
daten) occur as "spread out in the body". 50 "These 'inner-bodily' 
sensations (Empfindungen) are to a certain degree responsible for the 
fact that this body is 'mine' or appears as mine", 51 writes Ingarden. 
There seems to be a peculiar solidarity between the consciousness of my 
self as myself, in general, and of my self in sensory experience. I ex-
perience my self as reaching as far as my body reaches. On the one hand 
I identify myself with my body, but on the other I am oscillating between 
its dominating impact upon myself at certain times, and my own need to 
dominate it at other times. But even in the case of my radical domination 
over my body, when I believe I am using it as an 'instrument', that is, 
something exterior to myself, my body remains within the borderline 
of my self; in opposition to the instrument that is always external to 
me, I experience myself always as stretching into every member of my 
body. 
In this dialectic of my solidarity with my body and of my supe-
riority over it, my body as experienced is not only a part of myself but 
also the real foundation supporting my concrete bodily-conscious 
(leiblich-seelisch) life. 5 2 
The bodily dimension is then indicated and circumscribed by the 
expansion of my experiencing ego - as myself - through the ramifications 
of bodily sensations, processes and feelings. The experiencing ego is 
then woven into a special dimension, bodily dimension, outlined by its 
articulating reach but woven into a compact unity with all other types 

BEYOND INGAR DEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
305 
of experiences. 53 This bodily dimension of conscious experience is made 
up chiefly of the manifold of sensing and feeling that constitutes 
something distinctive which may be called 'my somacity' (Leiblichkeit). 
In the unity of experience, around the axis of the ego, thoughts, desires, 
volitions, nostalgias, etc. are related; they are grounded in the totality of 
the complete system as much as the primitive functions of the body 
(e.g. eating, sleeping, etc.) and bodily movements. 54 
Yet, this 'bodily' schemework of experience is distinct from the 
specifically 'psychical' elements, like thinking, willing, experiencing joy 
and sadness, etc., insofar as they are not clearly 'localized' within the 
experiential bodily system; they would then stand out as the function 
of the soul or of the spirit. Indeed, experiences expressing the soul 
as much as those of a specifically spiritual nature - which cannot on 
this analysis be denied an irreducibly specific status - are in the unity 
of experience 'embroidered' upon its bodily dimension. The spiritual, 
or else the experiencing (seelisches) ego, is raised above the level 
of the body, without, however, losing its deep roots in the real, bodily 
ground of the qualitative manifold which constitutes the 'sensory field' 
of my somacity (Leiblichkeit). 5 5 
At this point we reach the peculiar territory outlined by the functional 
interplay, and the amalgamation of the soul and the experienced body. 
Indeed, there seems, to be an intimate coordination, almost amalgamated 
in experience, between psychic acts of feeling (particularly vivid in love, 
hate, anger, disgust, etc.), and sensations which spread out in the inner 
bodily experience. In this seemingly essential connectedness between the 
soul and the body, sustained as they are by the axis of the pure ego 
and the system of pure consciousness, the structurizing factors of 
conscious life appear as distinct and not to be confused with each other. 
Here we may detect the body in still another function; that is, as 
expressing the processes and the states of the soul and manifesting 
them either for the sake of others, or for our own, namely to make us . 
aware of them. This existential connectedness between the body and the 
soul seems to be further evidenced by various observations from the inner 
experience (e.g. the impact of willpower and moral strength in 
surmounting bodily illnesses) as well as from that of external facts. 
We note the quick dissolution of the body after death when, as it seems, 
the soul does not play any more through the ego the role of factor of 

306 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
primitive forces as well as that of their structuration. 5 6 
The soul has been assessing its distinctness, first through the 
existential network with the ego and through acts of consciousness as 
their hidden reservoir of forces; secondly, as the material that they 
progressively structure towards the coherence of experience, and, 
thirdly, as the existential source of the ego; through its interlacing 
with the bodily dimension it takes the aspect of a material factor which 
pervades the whole experiential complex. Yet, the soul appears as be-
longing to the material territory of the body and consequently the 
questions decisive for the relation between consciousness and the real 
world irrupt there. Indeed, to ask the question which now emerges, that 
is of the existential autonomy or heteronomy of the soul with respect 
to the body, amounts to asking also the question of the existential autonomy 
or heteronomy of the pure ego and the set conscious act/stream of 
consciousness with respect to 'its' body. In the first place, the solution 
of this problem depends upon the answer to the question whether it 
belongs to the essence of the act of consciousness as such that it may/or 
may not be without the manifold of inner bodily sensations. This question 
corroborated with respect to the soul constitutes a precise way in which 
I 
the body-mind/soul problem is formulated within the formal-ontological 
inquiry. In fact, should the essence of the soul necessarily comprise 
experiences which are combined with inner-bodily sensations and should 
it appear in the analysis of the body (still extant) that the manifold of 
inner-bodily data constitutes (or belongs to) the essential state of the 
body, in that case we would have their mutual existential interdependence 
or complementarity in being. From the obvious variations of possible 
situations would flow other answers to this ultimate problem. 
These questions belong, in the framework of ontology, to the material 
investigation. In this direct confrontation with Husserl, Ingarden 
avowedly sees his surmounting of Husserl's idealistic presuppositions 
in: (l) uniting through the conception of the real person/soul the pure 
with the concrete, living ego, (2) overcoming the separation between the 
pure consciousness and the soul through the notion of the real, living 
ego, (3) articulating through the existential-ontological ties the distinc-
tive existential functions of the elements of the conscious system with 
respect to each other, which allows for (4) the precise formulation of the 
ontologico-existential problems concerning the possible status of the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
307 
human monad/soul with respect to the body, which appears then as 
(5) a realm into which the soul reaches already partaking of it . 
. Ingarden attibutes this differentiation of the cluster of consciousness 
with its revelatory insights to the superiority of the ontological in-
vestigation over the transcendental one of Husserl. Contrasting the rad-
ical immanence of the acts of consciousness with the ontological tran-
scedence of the objects given in these acts, Ingarden points out that 
from the mode of givenness we cannot conclude adequately to the 
mode of being of an object (e.g. to the immanence of consciousness and 
the transcendence of the concrete ego).57 The mode of being has 
clearly manisfested itself as determined by the formal and material 
essence of the object. 
We must ask whether having considerably weakened, if not al-
together dissolved, the basis for the idealistic position on the Idealism/ 
Realism controversy, Ingarden has definitively paved the way towards 
its solution. 58 
Ingarden's aim has been to establish a basis upon which the pure 
consciousness and the world could have been confronted in their 
respective natures and prerogatives. Thus their relations may be 
ascertained, and the status of the real world, in its existential moments 
of originality or derivation, autonomy or heteronomy, dependence or 
independence from the consciousness can be stated. As we have 
attempted to show following the line of his philosophical argument, 
intrinsic to the wealth of his analytic work, he marked a number of 
specific points, leading in that direction, which have been brought to the 
attention of our reader. Since the above investigation of consciousness 
may be considered as Ingarden's final step along this line, we have to 
ask (1) whether he has indeed won, in his duel with Husserl, over the 
hegemony of transcendental consciousness, (2) whether his own results, 
which seem to have formed an independent schema of problems and 
approaches, did contribute definitively to the solution of the controversy 
or rather brought Ingarden's - and for that matter phenomenological 
enterprise at large - to an entanglement from which he will try new means 
to extricate himself. 
The significant point which has to be observed is that it is along 
the stretching out of the formal-ontological structure of the intentional 
system that the differentiation of the key notions in Ingarden's project, 

308 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
person/soul and the body has been accomplished. We have, without 
doubt, obtained crucial insights into the ontological structure of the 
human monad/soul, yet its conception is circumscribed by the intentional 
network of ties in their ontological foundation. We have emphasized that 
Ingarden's conception of the soul is presented in a way that we could 
see there the possibility of attributing to it priority over pure intentional 
acts. This might be an illusion. Is not the pure ego the axis of the soul's 
manifestation, growth, progress and life? And we cannot forget that the 
pure ego remains, on Ingarden's analysis, the organizing factor 
distributing the structurizing functions of the intentional mechanism 
following its rules and regulations. Would the soul, as above all the 
reservoir of primitive forces, exist as such had not these forces entered 
into the structurizing grinder of the intentional system? Artistic 
creation being included by Ingarden in the constitutive system, the 
soul does not have, within the Ingardenian framework, any other outlet 
for coming into existence. A strong objection can be raised: "The soul 
escapes the intentional network through the territory which it dominates 
together with the body as experienced." To this we will respond by 
observing that the conception of the body has been suspended upon the 
formal elements of the structure of conscious acts, of the stream of 
consciousness of the ego and of the soul. 
By stretching the existential dependencies of the intentional system 
into the territory of the body as experienced (from which lurks also 
the double-face of the outer body, rational functions have been freed from 
their existential isolation. But have we also found a clue on how to cross 
the borderline, as imperceptible as it might seem to be? As conceived 
by Ingarden, does not the body-as-experienced belong integrally to the 
intentional system? 
The crucial contribution of Ingarden's analysis lies in having 
acknowledged the 'middle' territory of the soul-body interlacing as 
lying beyond the formal-ontological inquiry and belonging to the 
material ontology. But having brought us with the formal existential 
ties thus far - that the Husserlian inquiry into the modes of givenness 
could not do - the formal analysis itself falls short of providing the 
passage. The existential assessment of the material territory makes us 
expect that the body might be accessible in its own right. However, 
Ingarden did not leave us the key to enter it; the 'state of the body in its 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
309 
essence' remains out of reach. Neither did we detect in the analysis of the 
soul features or hints that would allow us to enter into investigation of 
the essential state of the body any further. While the existential continuity 
of the intentional into the empirical realm has been established, the ob-
jective nature of this realm has not been retrieved into the sequence of 
universal objects. Will Ingarden retrieve it in another way? 
To conclude: Ingarden presents his conception of the cluster of 
moments drawing upon the three major dimensions which are especially 
involved in the Idealism/Realism controversy: the intentional, (the 
stream of consciousness, the act and the ego) and the empirical (the soul 
and the body as experienced) which Ingarden attempts to bring together 
by introducing the distinctive role of the soul/person, interwoven and 
yet distinctive, overlapping and yet transcendent with respect to each 
other. His investigation is carried on with reference to the form of the 
stream of consciousness - act of experience - pure ego. That is done with 
reference to a formally established network of relations along the 
correlation: intentional system of conscious functions - its ideal struc-
turation. The ingenuity of the immanence-transcendence linkage plays 
a crucial role in establishing the ties among them and precludes re-
ductionism of levels of experience by the bias of an epiphenomenalism. 
However, are the types of transcendence as established by Ingarden 
capable of introducing the material 'empiria' into consideration? And 
do they allow one to transcend intentionality as a transcendental system? 
It is upon these questions that we will concentrate while making 
an excursion into its specific treatment in the field of aesthetics. 
Chapter II 
CLOSED OR OPEN SYSTEM OF CORRELATION BETWEEN 
STRUCTURE OF OBJECTS AND INTENTIONAL PROCESSES? 
1. A Way to Approach the Idealism/Realism Issue through Aesthetics 
Ingarden has carried on his inquiry simultaneously on two fronts: the 
'objective-ontological' of the ideal structures of things and beings, and 
the 'subjective-intentional' of man's conscious activities. 
In Ingarden's early letter to Husserl we may see, in fact, how his 

310 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
specific interests are converging in the question after the ways in which 
noemata occur. 59 The noematic-noetic correlation involves - as we know -
the procedures of a conscious structuring process as well as the reference 
to principles and models of structuration. Questions involved in this 
correlation lie at the heart of the Idealism-Realism issue in the phenome-
nological perspective. These questions are fully treated in his aesthetics, 
approached by Ingarden from these two sides at once, since in his 
aesthetic inquiry the two are conjoined: work of Art understood as an 
intentional object, a noematic product of artistic activity, and in the 
noetic reconstructing ('concretizing') intentional subjective processes of 
the percipient. It is well known that Ingarden's primary interest in 
aesthetics - as he himself has repeatedly stated - was to clarify by the 
comparison and opposition of the nature of the work of Art as a purely 
intentional artifact with the work of nature itself, the existential 
status of both. In fact, the analysis of the work of Art was intended - and 
in this respect it has fulfilled its promise - to show that the difference in 
structure corresponded also to that of origin as well as to the mode of 
existence between the real autonomous object - culminating in its specific 
'transcendence' with respect to the cognitive acts forming its noematic 
structure - and the purely intentional, that is existentially heteronomous 
work of Art whose noematic endowment as well as concretion depend 
exhaustively upon intentional acts and processes. Raving elsewhere 
discussed the significance of this analysis for the objective status of art, 
as well as its direct introduction of the Idealism/Realism issue by Ingarden 
in opposing Russerl's identification of their existential status,60 we will 
introduce here another aspect of this inquiry as having an important 
bearing upon this crucial issue. 
First of all, since the analysis of the structure of the work of Art 
involved the inquiry into its cognition or reception, so the field of 
aesthetics offers the ground for coupling the abstract structure-ontology 
with the cognitive intentional inquiry in its specific modalities and their 
variations. Thus into an a priori structural analysis of the work of Art 
as an object we have the intrusion of the fragmentary concreteness of 
man, both as the author and consumer to whose enjoyment the work 
of Art is oriented, but also as the judge to whose appreciation the work, 
as an exponent of values, is submitted. 
In fact, the Literary Work of Art remains as a direct parallel to the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
311 
study About the Cognition of the Work of Art, 61 and Ingarden considers 
the intentional relation between the author, composer, painter, etc. and 
the perceiver, mediated by the work of Art, as an essential interlocking 
of the intentional and the empirical dimensions of the real world. The 
investigation of the possible function of mediation which could, as we 
have already stated, play one of the fundamental roles within the 
Ingardenian philosophical reconstruction is therefore of primary im-
portance. This 'structure-intentional process' correlation may be, de-
pending upon its treatment and solution, in many ways relevant to 
several other aspects of the Idealism/Realism problem. First of all, the 
problem of the interlocking of various domains of objects within the 
same world, as well as the question of whether the inquiry so conceived 
can account fully for the significance of art and its role with respect to 
the problems of the 'transcendental' horizon of human life and the 
life-world appear in this correlation. 
The promising assumption underlying this conception is that at least 
some types of works of Art extend in a specific way, with regard to their 
intrinsic structure, through several realms of reality and that the specific 
modes of their perception (cognition) corresponding to their structural 
extension, comprise in a specific way different modes of cognition and 
cognitive attitudes. Consequently, we may expect from our investigation 
of the modalities of this correlation 'ontological structure - intentional 
process' to obtain decisive insights with respect not only to the problem 
of the unity of beings divided by Ingarden into separate existential 
domains, but also with respect to the crucial issue: whether and by what 
means we could investigate adequately the transcendental reach of human 
consciousness. Is the ontologico-intentional approach sufficient to 
account for the ways in which the transcendental can be seen as 'tran-
scended'? 
In fact Ingarden sees in the intentional faculties of man his means to 
transcend the level of 'animality' towards a fully human dimension. This 
deep conviction that man may rise above the doom which nature has in 
store for him seems to underlie his complete philosophical enterprise, 
otherwise divided into separate fragments. This conviction, however, 
may mean the acceptance of the transcendental life-world hegemony. Is 
the ontological transcendence of the work of Art sufficient to break it? 
Therefore, to investigate the correlation 'objective structure - sub-

312 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
jective intentional process' is of paramount importance. Does man, in 
his perception of a work of Art that relies not only upon one single 
cognitive channel (e.g. perception) but involves his complete apparatus 
necessary to do justice to the different realms of reality comprised by 
the work of Art, reach beyond the limits of structure of his own inten-
tional schema of constituting and reconstituting objectivity, his own 
objective being? Without the possibility of this type of 'transcending' 
himself, man remains caught within the transcendental circle. In other 
words: is Art a passage-way out of the life-world or the objective 
'reality'? 
2. The Many-Layered Structure of the Work of Art and Its Intentional 
Correlate in the Experience of the Perceiver 
The specific problems on which Ingarden concentrates in the analysis 
of the structure of the work of Art are: (1) "What is the nature and 
mode of being of an entity presented in an aesthetic experience?" 
(2) "What is the mode of being of an entity confronting us when we 
read or hear a word, phrase, or sentence?" (3) "How is this entity 
related simultaneously to both consciousness and independent realities?" 
Provisionally restricting the discussion to the second problem, the 
crucial issue is this: "How is intersubjective identity, and thus com-
munication, possible?" 62 The answer to this question involves not only 
the possibilities of history, science and philosophy, but also implies the 
non-linguistic media of 'communication'. And so the issue becomes the 
question of whether or not all media of 'communication' have a common 
intelligible or intuitive content. This question extends the discussion to 
the realms of human institutions, social life, and culture. 
Ingarden has pointed out that the task of appreciating and under-
standing art is to perceive and analyze the nature of the entity which in 
itself is a work of Art. Thus Ingarden opposed the prevailing dominant 
criteria for the understanding of a work of Art which were given in terms 
of the psychology or social experience of - or the historical influences 
on - the artist, making the intrinsic content of a work of Art relative to 
individual or social psychology and a product of an historical process. 63 
To this end Ingarden established 'objective' norms as a standard of the 
aesthetic value of a work of Art. Instead of reducing the extreme com-
plexity of a work of Art to some hypothetically primitive factors - for 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
313 
example, to the psychology of the creative experience - Ingarden has 
shown that a work of Art, upon examination that is appropriate, will 
explicitly reveal its own inherent structure without need of any additional 
explanatory theory. Accordingly, two original and most important points 
can be distinguished as a consequence of the self-revelation of the struc-
ture of a work of Art. In the first place, a distinction can be made between 
the work of Art and its many concretions. Secondly, the composition of 
a work of Art can be seen to consist of several specific strata, or layers, 
of a heterogeneous nature. The culminating point of the inquiry consists 
in establishing the homogeneous unity of the work of Art in spite of the 
fact that each of the specific strata composing it possesses its own nature 
and its own different mode of being. 64 The progressive analysis of the 
work of Art leads to the revelation of how such disparate strata can, 
together, constitute the organic unity of an aesthetic object. 65 
Specifically, Ingarden establishes four strata evident in the literary 
work of Art which are integrated in a certain order following the different 
existential realms to which they individually belong. 
In general, the layers of a work of Art are, as we know, in succession 
'bearers' or 'founding strata' for each other, starting always with the 
most fundamental one rooted in the medium through which primarily 
the work of Art acquires its 'objective' and 'intersubjective' status, and 
through which it takes root in the system of objective reality (e.g. a word 
in the literary work is rooted both in an inscription - a form drawn on a 
piece of paper - or a sound that we may utter and even 'hear', while 
reading in silence; a painting is rooted in colourful patches of paint 
upon a piece of canvas, etc.). Their intentional correlates are, according 
to Ingarden, intimately related to the nature of the respective medium: 
the word carries first the meaning, whereas a colourful patch carries a 
visual appearance. Ingarden has elaborated with special care and 
precision the modes of the correlation of the literary work with its 
recipient. This correlation seems, indeed, to extend through all the 
major realms of objective reality. 
Let us recall that the first stratum of the literary work is that of sound. 
Sounds belong integrally to the real, existing world and possess, essen-
tially, two aspects: first, we distinguish between the sound-units of 
individual words and the higher sound-formations (sentences and sen-
tence concatenations); secondly, for their concretion, sounds must be 

314 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
vocalized, a process which endows them with properties of their own 
(for example, sonority, rhythm and tempo). 65 Even at this level, however, 
an important observation must be made: the particular utterances alone 
do not make a work of Art. The individual, material sounds - their 
modulations being a product of the individual's utterances and circum-
stances - only support the concretion of the work. The literary work of 
Art itself, on the contrary, consists of a constant, typical sound structure, 
concretized as 'the same' in all individual utterances of a text. However, 
the sound-structure needs these modulations in order to be concretized, 
as, for example, when a poem is read or a play performed. This constant 
sound-structure is responsible for the identity of the work of Art, which 
maintains itself despite the infinite variations of its performance in 
perception. The individual material sounds and sound-formations of a 
novel, poem or drama remain 'the same' in spite of the fact that in each 
concretion they differ in tone, pitch, accent, modulation and so on; for 
example, not only each time the role of Hamlet is played by a different 
actor, but also with each performance of the same actor maintaining 
the same style. The major problem now becomes evident. Although 
borne by the physical sound material, this persistent structure of sounds 
and their formation cannot 'exist' individually or be 'real' because it 
could not then be present and remain the same in different sound 
occurrences. Neither can sound-structure be 'ideal' (in the sense of 
unchangeable mathematical objects). It comes into being as the product 
of a creative process, undergoes marginal transformations, is bound to 
the system of physical sounds, and as a given sound structure is part of 
a particular context, remaining identical in its concretions. To these 
structural features of the work corresponds a set of intentional expe-
riences which are their counterpart. 67 
The problem becomes even more interesting if we realize that sound 
can convey identical meanings because of the identical natures of specific 
sound formations. This proposition establishes the second stratum of 
the literary work of Art. 
The essence of the second stratum is seen, on the one hand, in the 
recognition of the irreducibility of a sound-formation to its component 
sound because of the fact that it consists of irreducible nova. On the 
other hand, the properties of the sound-structures (such as sonority, 
rhythm, tempo, and so forth) appear aesthetically valuable. They carry 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
315 
founding elements for value experience in terms of which the work of 
Art, on the one hand, and the aesthetic object, on the other hand, are 
constituted. 
Indeed, from identical sound-formations emerge concatenations of 
meanings which constitute the second irreducible stratum of the literary 
work of Art. 68 They perform specific functions. Meanings of individual 
words, sentences, and sentence concatenations, for example, within a 
narrative discourse, sketch objects - an entity, thing, person, state of 
mind, feeling, and so on - which appear either in a static or dynamic 
form while unfolding with the progress of the narrative their multiple 
qualities. This 'unfolding' of objects caught up in specific circumstances 
(events, developments) emerging from meaningful sentences and their 
concatenations develops into an organic, meaningful unity. All such 
situations unfolded in the progress of the literary work form together a 
world of persons, things, and events belonging to a particular literary 
work as its specific 'world'. 69 
In addition, meanings have properties of their own: they can be 
obscure or clear, light or heavy, simple or complex, literal or symbolic, 
and so on. Through these properties meanings play still another aesthetic 
role. 693 
First of all, taken individually, they present a situation in a gay or 
somber manner, creating the climate of the moods in which the situation 
is exhibited; secondly, in their interplay they not only contribute to the 
quality of the mood but also create the style. As Ingarden says, "they 
are aesthetically valuable elements" forming larger aesthetically func-
tioning complexes. Thus the literary work as a work of Art of aesthetic 
value consists in an array of meanings. 
Meanings in themselves, however, have their own mode of being. 
Indeed, Ingarden offers a new theory of meaning, refuting the conception 
by which Hussed, opposing the psychologism prevalent in his early 
period, laid the foundation for objective inquiry. A meaning intentionally 
'signifies' (symbolizes) an object, determining it materially and formally. 
This significance is rooted in the physical word, but it is not the property 
of the word. It is, in a way, "lent to it" by the signifying act of con-
sciousness. It is not a physical entity. Neither is it identical with the 
individual act of consciousness. Thus, the meaning is not psychical. 
Although it is brought about and sustained by an act of consciousness, 

316 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
it is transcendent to the act. It does not vanish with the disappearance of 
the particular conscious act in which it was conceived. The same meaning 
can be repeatedly concretized in new conscious acts. In spite of the 
alteration a meaning can undergo, it does not constitute a substantial 
part of our psychological acts nor of the stream of experience (in the 
sense of William James). For example, through the repetition of a 
meaning in various psychic acts, or by the direct influence of one act 
upon another, the meaning undergoes some alterations. This does not 
mean, however, that the meaning is congenital with the respective psychic 
act. We can transfer the meaning to other people, 'separating' it from 
the acts, whereas, we cannot separate acts themselves from our individual 
experience. 
Therefore, meanings as such are neither existing entities, nor are they, 
in opposition to Husserl's contention, unchangeable, ideal speciei, 
because, as Ingarden shows, they undergo modifications in subjective 
processes. Furthermore, were they ideal, timeless, or indestructible, all 
works of literary art, stories, lyrics, comedies, and so on, in all the 
variations in which they have or could be conceived or reproduced, 
would have existed forever. Thus, the artist would not be a 'creator' but 
a 'discoverer'. On the basis of this analysis, however, meanings are 
created and can be modified by the conscious act of the artist, poet, 
writer - the one who conceives them - intentionally 'lending' identical 
content to them, while in the concretions the performer of a part in a 
play or the spectator incorporates them into his actual experience. 
Ingarden's new conception of the intentional mode of being of mean-
ingful concatenations presents the meaning as a factor of mediation 
among various individual experiences. But above all, the meaning, under-
stood in this sense, mediates between the physical and psychical realms 
of objects as a specific content simultaneously rooted in both, and yet 
distinctive and transcendent with respect to both. Because it is understood 
simultaneously as formed by experience, yet irreducible to it - modifiable 
by experience and yet separable in its own right with respect to its 
corresponding psychic acts - it can mediate not only between various 
acts of consciousness (for example, as a condition of memory), but also 
serve as a foundation for intersubjective communication. 
To the basic 'word' substratum of the literary work (founding the 
layer of sound and meaning) corresponds in the cognitive scheme of its 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
317 
concretization by the reader the complete set of conscious processes of 
'understanding'. The analysis of the 'understanding' of the meanings of 
the words and phrases belongs to the typical problems of semantic 
inquiry. Ingarden devotes a most careful attention to the ways in which 
the 'reading' and 'understanding' of a script and a text occurs with 
respect to the cognitive apparatus of man and the ways in which meanings 
are founded in the whole system of language. 70 In so far as the problem 
of 'understanding' is specifically relevant to the correlation between the 
structure of the literary work and its concretion, Ingarden introduces a 
significant distinction, decisive for the re-production of the work by the 
reader, between the 'passive' and 'active' reading of a literary text. This 
distinction culminates in the question - how efficacious is the under-
standing of the text in stimulating the various channels of subjective 
experience. It applies specifically to the third structural layer of the 
literary work: the 'represented objects'. In fact, from the stratum of 
meanings within their concatenations emerge, as we have already 
indicated, the objects represented (such as things, persons, feelings) in 
their specific circumstances. 71 These objects, consequently, emerge as 
intentional beings (in opposition to Husserl's conception that the work 
of Art has an ideal existence); they constitute the third irreducible 
stratum of the literary work. Objects, together with their qualifications, 
represented in virtue of a conscious act establishing them by the media-
tion of a system of meanings, come into existence and maintain sub-
sistence in virtue of the act, which can just as well modify or annihilate 
them in the process of concretion. However, they are not reducible to 
the psychic nature of the act; their modifications do not coincide with 
the modifications of the act. 
As is commonly known, represented objects refer to, or resemble, real, 
existing, autonomous objects of the real world, at least up to a certain 
point of necessary recognition. From this resemblance a work of Art 
draws some of its emotional appeal for the reader or spectator, who 
assimilates its fictitious content and experiences the objects and events 
represented "as if they were real". The historical and social approaches 
to aesthetics over-emphasize this Art/Reality relation, bending it on the 
side of the latter, and they propose to reduce the distinctive significance 
of this content to a matter of representing a stage in historical evolution 
or to a question of social habits and cultural style. 

318 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
At this point, Ingarden brings up a differentiation relevant simulta-
neously to the explanation of both: the fictitious status of the represented 
events and persons within a text, and the reader's split experience which 
consists in a response to represented objects 'as if' they take place within 
the actual reality and simultaneously, as if they were doubling it and 
yielding the awareness that they do not belong to reality, but consist in 
a mere play of fancy. There is, in point of fact, the distinction to be 
made in the ways of enunciating reality: whereas represented states of 
affairs, as belonging to the real world, are accepted as such because of 
the affirmative mode of the phrases employed for their expression, the 
contrary is true of phrases in which the states of affairs in a literary 
work are enunciated, since they are merely quasi-affirmative (i.e. affirma-
tive only in appearance). Hence, we infer that they are merely fictitious 
(e.g. from the description of Dublin in James Joyce's novels we are not 
to form conclusions about the real town of Dublin, but only in so far as 
the work has recreated it). 72 
In this way, we owe to Ingarden's conception of the work of Art as an 
intentional, meaningful structure, the already mentioned insights into 
the noema of real individuals as transcending their constitutive acts via 
the new approach to constitutive analysis which focuses upon the relation 
between the objects represented and their real correlates. 
In fact, the stratum of objects represented unfolding the dimensions 
and perspectives of their specific circumstances does not make them as 
fully determined as, for example, their real, existing correlates. The 
'real', 'existing' Othello had a complete set of fundamental human pro-
perties, including all such individual features as a specific size of shoe, 
color of eyes, and so on. Death, as a real, concrete event, always has a 
.complete set of circumstantial features, among which none of its causes 
or manifestations is lacking. In a work of Art, however, we face objects, 
events, situations not fully determined, but only displayed from some 
significant point of view. Objects which, in a work of Art are present 
as mere intentional constructs, appear in their noematic contents in 
chosen schematic patterns in clear-cut situations or developments which, 
as Aristotle would say, imitate nature "for better or for worse". 
These shapes, views or appearances, perspectives, and clear-cut situa-
tions or developments, in which the presented objects appear, constitute 
the fourth stratum emerging from the third as an irreducible novum, 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
319 
concerning which we will say more later. At this point, it is appropriate 
to confront the specific structural features of the represented objects 
with the sUbjective process of their reconstruction in the 'active' reading 
of a work considered, in contra-distinction to the 'passive' submission 
of the reader, to be 'co-creative', since it activates the attention of the 
reader to the point of 'transporting' him into the realm of represented 
objects. 73 
In point of fact, to the specific features and assignments of structure 
of objects represented intentionally by the concatenations of meanings 
corresponds, on the side of the recipient, a complex, cognitive process of 
'objectivization'. This process operates, first of all, the passage from the 
intentional correlates of enunciative phrases (purely intentional states of 
things) or interrogative phrases (,problems') to the objects represented. 74 
No matter what is the degree of correspondence between objects repre-
sented and eventually existing things and beings (e.g. Napoleon in real 
history vs. Napoleon in a romanticized or legendary story), significant in 
a work of Art are those purely intentional objects established there by 
means of the purely intentional correlates of phrases for their own sake. 
They are established in the structure of a novel, a drama, an epic poem in 
order of succession (discription or presentation of situations, persons, 
or chains of events within 'objective situations' through the entangle-
ment of events, intricacies of problems and their aspects in the unfolding 
of a plot, repetitions or fluctuations of mutual relations among persons, 
elements or events), through which a complete universe with its own 
dynamism of action and its own specific emotional atmosphere emerges. 
This dynamic concatenation of events and conscious processes through 
which objects represented are moulded, completed and endowed with 
life, is meant to be acknowledged - grasped in its transformation from 
one phase of development to the other - as a 'world apart'. The re-
construction or incarnation of this 'world apart' established in its inten-
tional structure in the work of Art necessitates a system of specific sub-
jective processes. It is accomplished by the reader, performer or spectator, 
according to Ingarden's analysis, in the process of 'objectivation', which 
solicits his active involvement, drawing upon and bringing together the 
complete set of his experiential capacities in a conscious pattern of an 
intentional synthesizing activity. 75 It is due to this synthesis in which the 
reader or spectator responding to all the intricate elements of the work 

320 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
grasps intentionally the noematic sphere of the work - differentiating it 
in its meaningful complex - that the layer of represented objects emerges 
as quasi-independent from the semantic layer. And yet it is from the 
semantic layer that it draws its consistency and rigour, and it is the 
semantic layer upon which the sUbjective aesthetic perception (or recon-
struction) of the work relies. Its deficiencies, which would permit the 
subject to rely more on his own personal devices and invention and free 
him from this network of intentional references, hinder or make im-
possible a correct perception of the literary work of Art. The semantic 
layer of the objective structure of the literary text, comparable to the 
musical pattern in the musical score, or to the arrangement of colourful 
shapes in painting, establishes the unshakable foundation for a rigorously 
strict experiential response of the art perceiver, indispensable for a correct 
art perception. 
It might be objected that some flexibility and opening up in this strict 
correlation between the structure of the work and its reconstruction by 
the reader seem to appear, however, when we consider some particular 
points of this synthesizing process in the concretion of the represented 
objects corresponding to the feature of schematism in the structure of 
the work of Art. Indeed, the literary work does not offer all its factors 
to be reproduced intentionally in a strictly pre-determined fashion from 
the semantic basis onward. For in regard to a literary work of Art, in 
Ingarden's view, the essential level of represented objects, toward the 
constitution of which the preceding strata converge, is distinguished by 
a specific 'schematic' mode of 'representation'. 76 
Not all the events of the plot appear on the stage in Macbeth. We learn 
about some of them through excerpts of reports given by the protagonists. 
There are others which we simply infer, as, for example, supposed links 
within a chain of the same action. Nor are all features describing the 
protagonists indicated, nor are all their actions produced or envisaged -
not even by the authors or dramatists in question. In fact, life, people, 
intrigues, all are present in the structure of the work only through a set 
of carefully selected and established elements and in shortcuts, in certain 
specific perspectives, and from certain angles. It is left to the recipient 
to fill up this gap in his experiential process in order to bring about the 
represented objects, otherwise merely outlined. To this purpose he is 
called upon to bring in concrete gestures, emotions, evaluations, and to 

BEYOND INGAR DEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
321 
become, in this sense, the co-author of the work. 77 The space and time 
perspectives in which objects are represented in the structure of the work 
- distances between represented events, as well as the schematic view-
points and other means by which a character is revealed - have in this 
subjective synthesis a particularly important aesthetic function: through 
their specific selection they instigate the style of the characters, events 
and overall atmosphere; they may also playa purely decorative role. 78 
This structural mechanism of the work of Art, to which the SUbjective 
process of its cognition is geared, enables us to see more clearly the 
specific, intentional nature of the work of Art as such. In the work of 
Art itself objects are given only schematically, fragmentarily, in prespec-
tives purposely chosen by the artist. It is up to the individual - to the 
subjective experience of the reader, spectator, or performer - to make 
them complete in the form of a concretion. This need, intrinsic to the 
nature of the work of Art for turning the sketch into a complete form 
in the concrete with the help of individual experience, is nothing other 
than its 'intentionality'. This 'intentionality' is two-sided: objective and 
subjective, ontological and experiential. It explains how various con-
cretions of the same work of Art can be interpreted, appreciated, and 
evaluated disparately by different spectators, while at the same time the 
work of Art offers an indisputably identical nucleus of intersubjective 
elements and values which permit people to recognize it as 'the same', 
as well as to recognize its inherent, historically established value. On the 
side of the cognitive or receptive process, this structural schematism 
leaves room for innumerable and vastly diversified individual differences. 
Would this flexibility speak for an opening in the obviously tight strait-
jacket of correlation: "structure of the work of Art -
intentional 
process"? However, that is not the case, because not only does the 
completion of the discontinuous sequences have to be effected by inten-
tional processes, as Ingarden insists, but it also constitutes the very 
process of the intentional systhesis. 
In fact we are warned that in order to accomplish the correct art per-
ception by filling in the calculated gaps of the structural skeleton with 
our subjective life-experience we are obliged: (1) to keep within the 
limits of the established texts or another type of art structure; (2) to 
maintain conformity with the semantic layer; (3) to choose from the 
whole range only the one variant to be actuated in experience, and to 

322 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
conform to the range indicated in the structure and determined from 
different angles of the whole indicated situation. The 'fidelity', so con-
ceived, of the aesthetic perception to the work of Art imposes such 
strict limitations upon the author-reader cooperation that it is doubtful 
whether it may, in any sense, merit the term 'co-creative', with which 
Ingarden qualifies it. 
3. Is the Pluridimensionality of Experience Hinted at by the Polyphonic 
Harmony of the Multilayered Structure of the Work of Art and Its 
Correlate, the 'Aesthetic Object', Adequately Acknowledged? 
The apex of the correlation between the structure of the work of Art and 
the intentional synthesis in its concretion by the receptive subject can be 
seen in the way in which, on the one side, the multi-layered structure 
forms an 'organic unity' which amounts to an overall effect of the 
'polyphonic harmony'. On the other side, it finds its cognitive concret-
izing correlate - as the summit of a possible and the only adequate art 
perception - in the formation of an intentional aesthetic object. 79 
The thoroughness with which Ingarden distinguishes all the nuances 
of elements entering into play on both sides allows him, on the one side, 
to show, at least through some types of works of art, their diffusion 
throughout the major domains of the objects he has distinguished within 
his ideal universe of possibles, and on the other hand, the nature of the 
cognizing concretizing subject, man, in a pluri-dimensionality of expe-
rience. 
In this two-fold perspective elaborated to its ultimate conclusions, can 
we not hope that man may appear as breaking through the border of 
the automatized constitutive processes, transcending his universe and 
himself? In fact, each of the four strata previously mentioned, if taken 
separately, merely exists for itself, yet they are all most intimately inter-
woven in the work of Art to form an 'organic unity'. However, their 
intimate interplay would not result in a work of Art but in a mere con-
struction, if they did not also function as aesthetic values. A work of 
Art, considered in its aesthetic sense, displays a specific, intangible 
glamor, resulting from the merging of its constitutive elements. The 
work of Art as an aesthetic object is the consequence of a "polyphonic 
harmony" of "aesthetically valuable qualities". 80 Although the recog-
nition of the purely aesthetic significance of a work of Art is contingent 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
323 
to a considerable extent on subjective, individual differences in apprecia-
tion, this recognition finds an 'objective' foundation in the objective 
realms of the strata mentioned. 
As a matter of fact, the apex of the aesthetic value in the work, 
emerging as a product of the previously mentioned aesthetically valuable 
elements and in particular from the objects represented, is the specific 
atmosphere wherein the represented events, persons and circumstances, 
together with their specific aspects, move in their own affective flow and 
fragrance. This atmosphere has an overall representative 'metaphysical 
quality' (or qualities): of the sublime, the tragic, the terrible, the 
demoniacal, the sinful, the holy, of the "indescribable brightness of 
happiness", the comic, the ugly, and so on. 81 Metaphysical qualities 
are not properties of objects and events represented, or of the psychical 
acts concretizing them. On the contrary, the outburst of metaphysical 
qualities is rooted mainly in the stratum of the objects represented, 
although they draw upon the aesthetically valuable qualities which 
permeate all the constitutive elements of all the remaining strata. It is in 
the manner in which metaphysical qualities come about that the most 
genuine artistic achievement lies. Their emergence within the work of 
Art is built up and often announced by various phases in which it 
glimmers momentarily before its point of culmination is reached. In the 
line of concretion, individual subjective experience has to culminate, 
correspondingly, in the synthesis of processes comprising the concretion 
of all the strata, in order to release the metaphysical qualities. 82 
The metaphysical qualities playa salient aesthetic role in the work of 
Art. The "polyphonic harmony", Ingarden says in summary, "is pre-
cisely that 'aspect' of the literary work which, together with the meta-
physical qualities emerging as constitutive elements of the work, makes 
it a work of Art". 8 3 
On the part of the percipient this structural unifying 'polyphony' of 
all the elements of the work is matched by what we may consider the 
crowning point of art appreciation or of the aesthetic concretion: the 
aesthetic object. 84 
Indeed, the correlation, 'structure - intentional constitution', culmi-
nates in Ingarden's masterly and careful analysis of the way in which 
the progressing synthesis of the work's concretion by the percipient's 
reaction, at the point at which a complete object, subjectively identified 

324 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
with the work of Art, is constituted. The intentional synthetic process 
proceeds by a series of cognitive operations which first, however, have 
to lead to the recognition of elements in their concatenations in order to 
be reconstructed in the subjective experience in their aesthetically valuable 
aspects. Differentiating extensively possible aesthetic values (and distin-
guishing them from 'artistic' or ethical ones) Ingarden seems to see the 
process of the constitution of the aesthetic object as the ideal limit of 
the identification of the work of Art with its cognition simultaneously as 
referring to the complete set-up of the individual subjective experience and 
the interpretation of their noematic content with reference to values. 
Leaving aside, at this point, the intrusion of evaluation in the aesthetically 
constitutive process with its reference to values as ideal entities, we will 
stress the relevance of the extension of the correlation "structure of the 
work of Art - intentional process" to the philosophical questions which 
guide our investigations. 
In fact, the ultimate form of this correlation, the polyphony of the 
work of Art, extending through a number of otherwise existentially 
heterogenous domains of beings - the constitution of the corresponding 
aesthetic object drawing upon the pluri-dimensionality of man's expe-
rience - may allow us to expect that, comparable to the distinctive 
ontological-existential rights attributed in Ingarden's formal ontology 
to the domains of objects, the different dimensions of man's functioning 
(motor, sensitive, affective, imaginative, rational) will come into their 
own rights, as they enter in their specific fashion into our experience of 
art. 
As stated in the formulation of our initial concern, we subscribe to 
this expectation, with all its possible consequences, and, indeed, such an 
anticipation seems to be supported by the role played in reverse by 
different experiential dimensions of man, relative to many features of 
the very structure of the work of Art. 
In fact, not only in the correlation under discussion does the cognition 
of the work of Art follow the structure of the work, but, in reverse, it 
would seem that different types of works of art, by their very 'sub-
stratum' or medium - which belongs to a certain domain of objective 
reality - are correlated with a type of cognition and, by means of this 
specific type of cognition, are conditioned, in tum, in their structure. 
The work of Art, which is existentially rooted in the intentional act 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
325 
of the author, as well as in the virtual acts of the recipient, in its multi-
layered structure makes reference to its subjective concretion - first of 
all to the cognitive faculty, different for each layer as its structurally 
conditioned parallel. For instance, the basic and unique fundamental 
layer of sound in the musical work determines for both sides of this 
correlation the specifically irreversible temporal succession in the struc-
ture as well as in the concretion, whereas the essential concentration of 
the plastic art (especially painting) in the visual sphere brings about a 
structural pattern contrasting with both the musical and the literary. 
Concerning the distinction between these latter two, we find that they 
differ essentially at the point of their respective constitutive bases and 
means of representation of objects. This stratum (whatever may be the 
adequacy of correspondence between the artistically represented objects 
and objects of the real world, since at its limits we have an objectless 
and totally non-representational art) is, as we have emphasized, still the 
fundamental point of reference for art perception. In the literary work 
of Art the meaning in its concatenations intentionally brings forth the 
appearance of represented objects. In contra-distinction, in painting the 
intentionally represented object emerges from visual appearances selec-
tively established by the painter. 
Hence, in their function of bringing about what in the interplay between 
the spectator and the work of Art has to be constituted as an articulated 
object, ultimately rising in subjective concretion to the level of an aesthetic 
object, their structures are differently formed with reference to the 
respective cognitive faculty which plays the preponderant role in the 
layer distribution. 
For instance, in the literary work where meanings play the major role, 
represented objects appear in the language fold in successive arrange-
ments of temporal phases, in which the characters of the protagonists, 
the events, the situations, unfold their inward conflicts, with their trans-
forming effects. In painting, on the contrary, rooted in visual perception, 
the perceptive act, although itself a process, catches once for all a 
momentary and passing view of its represented object, and establishes 
it as a fixed instantaneous datum (e.g. the portrait of a person as he is at 
a given instant in one or another mood - the 'Self Portrait' of Rembrandt; 
states of affairs or an event - 'Embarkment upon Cithera' by Watteau 
or 'The Night Watch' by Rembrandt). Even if some perspective of past 

326 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
history or of the future is implied in this representation, yet, it does not 
allow, unlike a literary work, for the successive unfolding of the plot or 
for a lyrical progression of emotion. "The temporal continuum" as 
Ingarden calls it, of the literary work, spreading through the successive 
phases of duration, corresponds directly to the plurality of phases in 
which the percipient, the reader, is obliged, accordingly, to concretize 
it in his profiles of represented objects. 
The indispensable, strict correlation between the work and the con-
tinuity of the subjective concretizing phases of experience implies that 
its distortion will preclude the accurate formation of the intentional 
aesthetic object. 
The most significant result of Ingarden's inquiry should now be 
stressed. The outstanding feature of his analysis consists in demon-
strating that several heterogeneous strata, which in the history of thought 
have been considered as belonging to divided and irreconcilable realms 
- extending from the physical and psychic, through the meaningful up 
to the metaphysical qualities of the spiritual - not only can enter into a 
composition with one another, but can even constitute the organic unity 
of a homogeneous object. As our investigation shows, this unity is 
obtained by bringing them together under two general categories: 
objectivity (comprising the domains of being), and subjectivity (meant 
to comprise various dimensions of man's experience). The diverse ele-
ments subsumed by these common denominators do not appear there in 
their own right and functional specificity, but in the guise of their purely 
intentional moulding. In fact, going all the way with Ingarden's analysis 
to its ultimate conclusions, we may venture to say that it is only in the 
virtual concretion of the aesthetic object by the percipient - or at least 
in the possibility of actualizing it through communication between the 
author and the recipient - that the work of Art consists (e.g. a play is 
meant to be performed, a poem or a novel to be 'read', a painting or a 
movie to be 'shown', etc. Each of these references implies a recipient and 
a medium of correspondence between the work of Art and its reception). 
The structure of the work of Art guaranteeing this correspondence 
appears as its necessary constitutive matrix, in fact, ideal nature; whereas 
in its nature per se the work of Art is purely intentional in the sense that 
this ideal pattern of structure indicates and determines the intentional 
pattern of experience to be actualized in the individual consciousness 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
327 
of the percipient and has been concretized first in the work of Art also 
through intentional processes of the artist. Only as long as in the actual 
historical progress of the actualization of the ideal pattern into the 
fullness of an intentional aesthetic object in individual experience remains 
possible, is this intentional object 'alive' in the sense in which we talk 
about a cultural trend or an 'institution'. In the contrary case, although 
the ideal pattern can be actually preserved in time through cultural 
documents etc., we speak about a 'dead language', a 'dead culture'. Yet, 
in the prospective of this closed-upon-itself correlation we do not reach 
a point to transcend the historicity of man and civilization. 
Of course, we know that it was precisely the anticipated aim of Ingar-
den's extensive aesthetic inquiry to show the purely intentional status of 
the work of art. If we have devoted so much attention to this already 
well-known point, it is in order to see the consequences of the way in 
which Ingarden establishes this point in relation to the great philosophical 
questions he ultimately plans to envisage. Indeed, does this novel, two-
fold objective-subjective perspective of inquiry into the status of beings 
do justice to the distinctive rights of man's experiential faculties? Shall 
we in this way break through the sovereign rule of reason, of ideal 
structure and objectivity? 
To answer these questions, essential to our inquiry, we have to for-
mulate them with more precision and within the complete framework of 
our investigation. 
4. Basic Flaws in Ingarden's Approach Concerning the Problem of 
Transcending' the Transcendental Circle 
It has to be granted to Ingarden's inquiry into the formation of the 
noemas of objects in their structural and 'material' composition within 
the sUbjective intentional process, that, firstly, a distinctive approach 
- as over against Husserl - showing a feature of 'transcendence' of the 
noema of a real individual rooted in its ontic structure - with respect to 
the intentional acts in which it is constituted, is established. In contra-
distinction, it is revealed that this 'transcendence' is not reached by the 
'purely intentional' work of Art, whose existential status is inseparable 
from and totally determined by the corresponding intentional process. 
Secondly, as we have already pointed out, the intentional activity of 
man seen by Ingarden as the vehicle of art, but also of social institutions, 

328 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
science and culture at large, makes man in his conviction overcome the 
stage of animality and reach beyond the bondage of nature. 
But did we advance through the simultaneous approach, ontologico-
experiential, conceived in the Ingardenian fashion, one step further 
toward the disentangling of the initial knot of difficulties inherent in the 
Husserlian-Ingardenian foundation of phenomenology which underlies 
and pre-determines the formulation of the problem concerning the status 
of the real world and man in it? 
If such an advance can be claimed, it consists, not in disentangling 
this knot, but in making it apparent. We would venture the conclusion 
that the way in which Ingarden has conducted it, the approach to the 
intrinsic noema of the work of Art in correlation with its intentional 
process-concretion has, on the one hand, only tightened and inseparably 
united the ontic with the intentional aspect into a two-fold, but indis-
soluble mechanism, weaving the rational texture of the aesthetic object 
by rooting it in the structure of different types of works of Art in various 
media (the literary work in its sound material, the plastic work in the 
medium of canvas, paint etc., the architectural work in stone, marble, 
metal etc. - shown to belong to physical reality as their initial 'objective 
bearers'). 
Ingarden believes that he has established a definitive explanation of 
its existential status. But, does not this intentional status absorb any 
distinctive existential feature of other domains of beings entering into it? 
However, this question is not yet the basic issue confronting the relation 
Art-Reality, which, if taken into consideration, could have modified the 
above approach. The intentional analysis might camouflage rather than 
give access to it. 
In fact, the question after the origin of the system of means of expression 
which must and does arise with respect to every great work of Art 
(especially visible in the limit-case of poetry and lyric expression) is and 
always has been: "What are the sources - in what commerce of man and 
Nature lie the hidden springs of a selection that a poet makes of each 
word, its sonority, meaning, power of evocation; a painter of various 
nuances of colour, their configuration, the style of design into which they 
should enter, etc.; an architect, a figured expression of his functional 
purpose; a musician, a key to a melody, its sequence etc. - where an 
expression for artistic vision can be found? According to what regulations 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
329 
is a certain linguistic, visual, sonorous or three-dimensional form articu-
lated in a particular work of Art and in no other? With the help of what 
guidelines does the deliberation and selection in the concrete constitution 
of the aesthetic object proceed?" These are questions which concern not 
only Art, but the 'art language' through which Art is currently ap-
proached. It seems that only through these questions - and not through 
those that can be answered by the intentional transmutation of levels of 
experience and by the establishment of its intentional fragments into 
concatenations of processes or through the intrinsic interlockings of 
ideally conditioned structures, can we approach the formation of the 
noemas as involving realms transcendent with aspect to objectivity. Can 
Ingarden's strictly "structure - intentional process correlation" system 
give access to these questions? The treatment of the existential status of 
the work of Art in his approach appears insufficient. 
Indeed, it seems that in his strictly immanentist-structural perspective 
there is no need - nor place - to bring up the question of the actual 
concrete effort of man to bring about the work of Art by his inter-
worldly activity. Questions concerning the reasons for such an under-
taking and regarding man's initiative as stemming from his inter-worldly 
status, cannot be raised in this approach since all that mattered for 
Ingarden's ontologico-cognitive purpose is present, and has to be solved 
on the basis of already present data. Hence, these questions are replaced 
by one question: "How does the artist communicate with the recipient 
through the work of Art?" This question is treated in terms of establishing 
the previously analyzed correlation. 
Yet the precise point at stake in this relation, work of Art - its recipient, 
is whether, indeed, there is not something beyond and prior to the 
established noema of the work of Art? It may be that this noematic 
structure is but the medium of a 'message', as it is usually called, which 
the author wishes to 'communicate' to other men, and for the sake of 
which the work of Art in its specific, concrete and unique correlation 
has been devised as such and no other. Discussing the final 'purpose' of 
the work of Art, Ingarden, however, emphatically excludes any other 
aim of Art but the concretization in the work of Art of the aesthetic 
object for the sake of the percipient's specific recognition and experience 
of aesthetic values. Yet, in line with the allusion we have just made, 
there may be more to a work of Art that, on the one hand, calls for 

330 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
deliberation and calculation regarding such and no other structure as 
the appropriate vehicle for the message that the artist chooses to convey 
to the recipient as its purpose or aim. And, on the other hand, is it not 
through this message 'transcending' the everyday objective world, that 
the recipient of the work of Art expects to reach beyond the aesthetic 
object? 
Could we account for such a 'transcending elan' of the spectator by 
the ultimate transcendence of aesthetic values seen by Ingarden as 
nothing but ideal objects? Or do we see values as Husserl did, as belonging 
integrally to the transcendental realm? Or in the manner of Ingarden, 
do they not appear precisely in the Husserlian-Ingardenian framework 
of aesthetic analysis simply as basic factors of the constitution of objec-
tivity, bound to it in their function rather than opening up a trans-objective 
perspective? 
It may be objected that the apex of the aesthetic object, namely, the 
'metaphysical qualities' releasing an 'elevated' type of experience in the 
percipient, take care of the 'transcending elan' of man. Indeed, they 
account within Ingarden's pattern for the presence of the 'highest' or 
most 'elevated' aesthetic elements as founded in the aesthetic values: the 
beautiful, the sublime, the elevated etc.; yet they are understood in 
themselves as 'qualities'. However, to have conceived of them in terms of 
'qualities', that is, intrinsic constituents of the structure of the work and 
of its correlate-system of intentional experience of the recipient reduces 
them to the noematic content of intentional constitution. Can they, as 
'objective' qualities, enclosed within the structure-concretion correlation 
account for that elan transcending this very system? Aristotle, also caught 
up into the merely structural approach to the work of Art, proposing 
the correlated notion of Catharsis as the essential way of response of the 
spectator to the tragedy, likewise falls short of understanding the basic 
significance of Art. 
Whereas, as we have shown elsewhere, the ultimate aim of a work of 
Art is not to encircle the recipient in the narrow sphere of the work, 
merely enlarging or enriching his life-world horizon, but to raise him 
above its limits and to open him to new modalities of experience. 85 
Is it not precisely within the very significance of Art to achieve not only 
the dramatic catharsis of our conflicting pressures that the everyday 
submersion into the necessities of existence causes, but first and foremost, 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
331 
to bring about the unfolding of our latent potentialities of experience, 
allowing us to transcend in the full sense of the word, that is, both the 
work of Art and ourselves, toward new and unprecedented perspectives 
of the world and of our own being? 86 
Artistic accomplishment can be measured precisely by releasing expe-
rience capable of breaking through the intentionally enclosed framework, 
man-world, and opening it toward a radically unobjectifiable perspective. 
Can the aesthetic object, as conceived by Ingarden, alone account for the 
orphic elevation of a Gerard de Nerval or of a Nietzsche, which causes 
the narrow dullness of life to explode into a universe of Beauty? Can it 
account for the lyrical swing of man's emotions into metaphysical elan 
in the poetry of a John Donne, or for the sublime inward call of the 
poems of William Blake? They all indicate at first sight another type of 
vehicle than those Ingarden has considered, transcending objectivity as 
such. Can we not conclude that behind this apparent inadequacy of 
Ingarden's two-fold approach, by means of which he expected, but failed, 
to avoid the Husserlian trap of the one-sided exfoliation of reality, there 
lurks, as of crucial importance for the appropriate approach to the status 
of the real world, the issue of the unity of beings? Indeed, it may well be 
that the key to the gate leading out of transcendental objectivity may 
serve also to establish the unity of heterogenous domains of objects. 
5. The Missing Factor in Ingarden's Aesthetics: the Dynamic Modalities 
of Action 
Throughout our critical investigation of Ingarden's attempt to establish 
the new formulation of the Idealism/Realism issue, we have tried to 
outline an argument that would show the basic point of his difficulties, 
revealed in so far as how the nature of the articulations of the different 
heterogenous domains of objects would guarantee to each its own "Specific 
rights. 
. 
In fact, as we shall see, Ingarden, in his last period of reflection, must 
have become aware of the insuperable difficulties of his position, for 
seeking how to reconcile unity and discontinuity, structure and dyna-
mism, he introduces a new approach into his framework which we might 
interpret as an eventual attempt to envision the above mentioned 
problems: the approach through action. First, he scrutinizes physical 
action through the mechanisms of causal relations on the physical level 

332 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
of the real world. Then he seeks in the moral action of man a model 
integrating into one continu~us set of articulations ideal values, spiritual 
and psychic processes, as well as the physiological functioning of man as 
rooted in physical Nature. 
But the crucial question arises: "What conditions should the notion 
of action fulfil in order to play this key role with respect to the total 
project of phenomenological reconstruction?" 
Before we advance to introduce in our reflection the two ways in which 
action is conceived by Ingarden, we must first point out that in the 
aesthetic perspective under discussion - and it may prove to be the 
essential one - Ingarden's approach prevented him from seeing and 
acknowledging the role of modalities and conditions of action in 
establishing the aesthetic noema through the work of Art. Should we 
not, at this point, recall Leibniz' postulating in the "genetic definition" 
that for an adequate knowledge of something we have not only to 
consider the essential features of what it is, but also the ways in which it 
actually or possibly comes about? 
The essential limitation of the otherwise incomparably nuanced and 
correct conjunctive approach to art - the work of Art as a receptive 
experience - appears, indeed, to be that it cannot take into account, nor 
does it allow an approach to the work of Art directly from the point of 
view of the act of creation of the work. In fact, centering upon the 
structure of the intentional content of the work and of art experience it 
misses altogether the ultimate perspective: that the work of Art is a 
product of a specific act of creation, and as such it stands, as we have 
already indicated, for something beyond and prior to its objective content 
of aesthetic values. As we have pointed out in an earlier work, if we 
refer the work of Art to the modalities of its genesis, we discover on the 
borderline of the accomplished structure and the teleological orientation 
of the creative process, an essential factor of continuity. It cannot be 
- and here we agree with Ingarden - identified as a piece of information, 
nor as an idea nor ideology, nor is it an attempt by the artist to present 
an educative principle. These latter elements - often taken respectively 
as 'aims' of a work of Art - belong exhaustively to the objective content 
of the work of Art as its intrinsic constituents. But the analysis of 
certain works of art reveals that there are essential factors, which, at the 
same time, belong to and encompass them, to which the whole work of 

BEYOND INGAR DEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
333 
Art is subservient, and which cannot be grasped along the lines of the 
Ingardenian structural-intentional analysis. 87 To bring about its emer-
gence or revelation in the aesthetic experience of a work of Art, we have 
to transcend the work itself and consider the vision which presided over 
its creative process. 
Indeed, we cannot reach the vision of earth presiding over Cezanne's 
creative effort to convey it through his paintings, nor can we grasp his 
artistic message without reaching beyond corresponding 'aesthetic 
objects' which in the Ingardenian analysis would incarnate it. On the 
contrary, the aesthetic object, pinnacle of intentional perception and 
enjoyment, has to be broken into pieces in its structural skeleton, in 
order that this vision may emerge. In point of fact, Cezanne's vision of 
the earth is alien to our experience in the current life-survival oriented 
intentional system, and calls for a unique trans-objective plane in order 
for it to be revealed. It is just such a unique trans-objective situation of 
experience that Schongauer attempted to evoke in his representation of 
the encounter between the resurrected Christ and Mary Magdalen, and 
the inexorable ferocity of life which Zola sought to reveal through his 
novels. There is then at the border-line of a work of Art its creative 
process, the Vision of which contains a message to be communicated by 
the artist to the percipient. The structure of both the work of Art and the 
intentional correlate of its concretizing appear as mere objective means of 
this communication. The message, which in itself is trans-objective-
ineffable as the above examples show, cannot be grasped nor represented 
by intentional means. 
Ingarden did not fail to touch upon the problem of creativity in his 
analysis. He brings up several points relevant to the phenomenon of 
creativity, especially in his analysis of the musical work of Art as revealing 
specific structural differences from other types of works of Art shown 
through the 'creative behavior' of the composer. However, Ingarden 
introduces them only in so far as the analysis of the immanent structure 
of the work of Art indicates. Consequently, the break-through toward 
the creative process with its decisive progress, sources, regulative prin-
ciples, etc., is precluded. As shown above, within his framework, creative 
activity is deliberately submitted to the rules of the intentional system 
since his ontological categorial scheme with the supreme rule of ideal 
genera does not allow for original and novel objects to enter the real world. 

334 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
We have seen that it was not enough to approach it in the structural-
intentional correlation between the objective and the subjective 'neo-
matic' intentionality. It has enclosed us within the narrow frame of 
objectivity definitely encircled within the three-dimensional network: 
pre-given ideal structures - rules of noematic constitution - (in strict 
relation to the first) - subjective 'reconstructive' /cognitive intentional-
ity - all three tied up within a rational network representing some of 
man's functions and accepted with apodictic certainty. However, having 
brought this approach to its final conclusions, Ingarden has revealed its 
flaws and thereby, in fact, prepared the ground for undertaking anew 
the investigation of the whole issue. Ingarden's intentional-structural 
approach closes the issue instead of taking into account this crucial point 
concerning the work of Art and its reception. In fact, having taken up 
elsewhere on our own, the issue of the limitations of the transcendental 
position, approaching it directly in the perspective of the creative 
experience, we submit that message and vision are precisely those factors 
of the work of Art that not only give art its specific significance as 
another type of communication than that of objective information, but 
also that the constitution of the work of Art is subservient to them. 
Seen through the prism of the creative process, are they not factors 
determining the work of Art by prompting creative endeavors toward 
introducing into the constituted world a radically novel and original object? 
To conclude our criticism of Ingarden with an alternative proposal to 
his (to understand the work of Art, starting with its structure) the 
emphasis should fall upon the search for its vision and message, that is, 
from the state of affairs, we are directed toward the process of their 
production: creation. 88 
If the creative process, as we have established it elsewhere, can be 
seen as a chain of human acts which runs through all the dimensions of 
objectivity, constructing a novel object and establishing it in the inter-
subjective, real world (simultaneously breaking the system of objectivity 
as such) we propose that the issue of continuity of Being and that of 
transcending objectivity should be seen in relation to the investigation 
of the modalities of action. 
Will Ingarden's hint of an approach through causal and moral action 
do justice to these issues?

Chapter III 
ACTUAL EXISTENCE AND 'THE PLENITUDE OF FORMS' 
The Switch to Metaphysics of a Pluralistic Universe? 
Ingarden's formal-ontological investigation which has at its center of 
interest the domain of the real world and that of the monad-soul has, 
as we have just seen, culminated in mapping the territory for the dis-
entangling of the relations between the soul and the body. It has also 
narrowed considerably the possible significance of the eventual con-
frontation between real world and pure consciousness. In fact, according 
to the formal-existential laws, the real world and the human monad/soul 
as established in their respective ontological structures can be with 
respect to each other only in one of the two relations: the world 
remaining in its components existentially autonomous as totality would 
be existentially independent in its essence as well as in maintaining itself 
in existence from pure consciousness. It would be existentially derived 
from it. Ingarden calls this relation 'absolute creationism' in contra-
distinction to its variation 'realistic dependence creationism' in which 
the world would be also existentially dependent of pure conscious-
ness. 89 
And yet this confrontation remains still extant since the approach to 
the soul and body in immanent perception fell short of offering an access 
to the material nature of both. In spite of the wealth of difference in 
point of detail with Husserl and in spite of its autonomous state, (the 
ontological transcendence of the real individual, etc.,) the real world is in 
the final analysis disclosed as existentially derived from pure conscious-
ness and pure consciousness stands out in an absolutely privileged 
position. The solution at first sight does not lie too far away from 
Husserl's transcendental idealism. Does the term 'creationism' with 
which Ingarden accentuates the difference in perspective (not constitutive 
but ontological) stand for an essential change with respect to the pre-
rogatives of pure consciousness? This ultimately privileged position of 
pure consciousness which, unexpectedly, Ingarden has to acknowledge is 
for him, on the one extreme, the guarantee of freedom from the bondage 
of Nature. On the other extreme, however, is it not from material 
dependencies on the part of the bodily functions, representing the sub-

336 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
intentional interweaving between the real world and consciousness (and 
mediated in Ingarden's conception by the soul), from the 'absolute' 
bondage of pure consciousness that we have to seek freedom? As long 
as this part of the elucidation was out of sight we did not in principle 
advance much by replacing the term 'constitution' by that of 'creation-
ism', otherwise than changing the epistemological for the ontological way 
of explanation. Since 'creationism' in Ingarden's ontological perspective 
falls short of the classic metaphysical considerations of its modalities, 
it is, like 'constitution', synonymous with 'production'. 
In fact, should pure consciousness originate the world as a totality, 
what would be the modalities of this origination? According to what 
rules would it proceed? In Ingarden's emphatically expressed assump-
tions the ontological constitution of the components of the real world 
and their network falls, as we have stressed, without exception under the 
jurisdiction of the Aristotelian system of types with the sovereign rule of 
the highest genus. Consequently the bringing about of the world would 
not involve the selection of the possibles towards their actualization in 
concrete existence. Thereby the deliberation/choice feature of cosmic 
creation is a priori eliminated; as the possible mode in which pure con-
sciousness could originate the world only a predetermined production is 
left. 
Nevertheless, only the material investigation can possibly (1) indicate 
with precision whether it is with respect to pure consciousness or may-
be to another factor - still unexplored in this respect - that the existential 
derivativeness of the world is to be interpreted; (2) to complete the 
linkage system among the different domains of objects and thereby 
indicate the modalities of their existential ties with final precision. 
Should we establish the means of the material investigation and 
discover the modalities of the eventual passage between the soul and 
the body, the solution of the controversy might be confirmed by the 
option of one of the two proposals; it might indicate still another 
factor to be considered, or it might as well, in an unforeseeable way, 
tum upside down the constructed ontological edifice and make us revise 
the details of the formal ontological results. In any case, however, the 
material investigation can be expected to reveal the knot of the crucial 
linkage among a number of domains of objects differentiated by Ingar-
den. 

BEYOND INGAR DEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
337 
In fact, the conception of the soul outlined above appears to fall into 
the Aristotelian pattern as being the boundary line between the corporeal 
and the incorporeal; it seems to constitute simultaneously the highest 
member of the genus corporeum and to be at the bottom of the series of 
the mental/intentional genus. As such, we could interpret it as the 
possible point of convergence in which the formal rational order of 
intentional organization of life finds its counterpart in the material to be 
transformed by its functional organization into arteries and channels of 
motion; it grows in one direction, and outgrows it through the higher 
intentional constructivism of man, under the auspices of ideal prototypes 
of values in the other direction. 
Yet even having obtained the knowledge of the material nature of 
things and beings we would be short of solving the problem of the status 
of the world and of consciousness; we are still missing the existential 
statement whether, as ontologically conceived, things and beings actually 
exist. The clue indispensable to assess the actual existence is not visible. 
As long as we miss it all remains provisory. 
Nevertheless, the soul/body territory seems promising as an artery 
of the linkage which Ingarden seeks to find between the different domains 
of objects, essentially involved in the Idealism/Realism issue. 
However, Ingarden's gigantic effort finds a striking development in 
which the phenomenological trend of reflection reaches in a powerful 
swing radically beyond the constitutive schemework of Husserl. The 
problem of the relation between the real world and pure consciousness 
is ultimately brought to the question of the interweaving between the 
domains and types of objects. Facing their pluralism this complex issue 
cannot be pursued in isolation nor in a fragmentary singling out of some 
of them without considering others. In point of fact, before the status of 
the real world among them may be appropriately acknowledged, the 
unity of the spontaneously delineated complete sequence of objective 
domains must be established first. 
Is not the question of 'connexio rerum' already essentially inherent in 
the differentiation of the types of beings and their corresponding 
domains? Ingarden did not remain unaware of the eventual "unity of 
the All of Being". Continuing the Husserlian line of thought he envisaged 
the eventual quest after the unity of all objects as the quest after one 
principle, which according to him, if initiated too early - as by Husserl-

338 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
might compromise the whole undertaking by bending the inquiry to 
reduce the existential heterogeneity of objects or beings to one homoge-
neous type. He seems to have overlooked that the ways and means 
through which he has been defining the distinctiveness of one type of 
objects over against the others might have constituted already a thread 
of common principles applying to all of them, although in a different 
way, and accounting for their irreducible distinctiveness. 
The thread of unity which runs through the differentiation of types 
of objects is evident already in their natural falling into the hierarchical 
articulation of a sequence. Instead of being merely chaotic and incon-
sequential, they are divided first along the line of the absolute and the 
relative existential status. Continuing the principle of gradation in 
existential original/derivative, autonomous/heteronomous and indepen-
dent/dependent sections different instances of the types of objects and 
respective domains seem to outline the complete scale of the rational 
discourse, from the most abstract to the concrete. This existential 
gradation is rooted in the differentiation in complexity and internal 
compacity of structure of the types of objects. The gradual progress in 
structural complexity proceeds as follows: (1) the 'pure qualities' as 
building blocks of structures; (2) the 'individual objects', which vary in 
intrinsic complexity and cohesion of their constitutive moments (and 
which serve as a basis to establish the existential scale of 'temporal 
objects' with various degrees of intrinsic independence from external 
conditions); (3) the 'a-temporal objects', reposing in themselves and not 
subject to change; (4) the 'existential optimum' of the perfectly coherent, 
self-reposing, self-enclosed and consequently responsible for its own 
origin' Absolute Being'. The great chain of being of the classic philosophy 
seems to be retrievable through the Ingardenian sequence of objects. 
As we have seen, there is a special effort made to specify further the 
essential thread of continuity among the elements of this sequence; this 
is done in terms of specific mechanisms or ties of existential interweaving 
between the domains of objects through the existential functions they 
accomplish towards each other. The tightest network of such a linkage we 
have discussed above is present among the cluster of the formal elements 
functionally interlocking and existentially interwoven within the monad/ 
soul. But there is still to be added the correlation between the intentional/ 
noematic structures and subjective intentional processes; the specific 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
339 
linkage between the works of Art, as purely heteronomous objects and 
conscious acts in which they are constituted; the correlation between 
the aesthetic ideal values and the concrete values concretized in Art 
perception; at last, and not least, a functional correlation between ideas 
and concrete objects 'mirrored' in their 'contents'. The two last ones, at 
this point - and even till the end of Ingarden's research - remain 
enigmatic and yet undoubtedly the complete edifice of Ingarden's pro-
gram stays and falls with them. In this brief enumeration we cannot omit 
the specific doublesided immanence/transcendence ontological feature of 
some types of objects, which -like the person rooted in transcendental 
acts and yet transcendent with respect to them - throws the bridge be-
tween the domain of pure consciousness and the otherwise separated soul. 
Some of the major existential domains are not yet investigated and 
their linkages are so far missing in Ingarden's analysis - the Idealism/ 
Realism solution remains to be discovered - and yet a meta-ontological 
thread of unity running through the established sequence of objects seems 
to bind them like an iron chain together. Every one of them appears as 
an existentially indispensable moment of the complete orderly substruc-
ture they outline: would disproving of its validity not lead to the collapse 
of the validity of all? But conversely, can we not see in the tum that 
Ingarden's investigation took in making the solution of the Idealism/ 
Realism controversy ultimately dependent upon the modality of onto-
logical interweaving between different domains and types of objects (or 
their constitutive moments) a possible shift from the cognitive to the 
ontic - undertaken in order to find the conditions of the passage from the 
possible to the actual existence? 
Should the ontological investigation prove capable of accounting for 
the complete spread of the universal sequence of objects outlined above; 
that is if we were to grasp the still missing empirical realm of the body, 
would we not reach the metaphysical condition of actual existence known 
in the philosophical tradition of the great chain of being as the plenitude 
offorms? 
Following the Aristotelian-Medieval tradition, revived by Leibniz, 
could we not see in the complete sequence of possible forms from which, 
according to the initial a priori laws, no segment could be missing in the 
actual universe of things and beings devised as necessarily containing 
their full scale according to the principles of continuity and gradation, 

340 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
the sufficient condition for the possibles to be actualized in concrete 
existence? 
Thus the key to the passage from the universal to the concrete, from 
the potential to the actual would be identical with the key to the system 
of the intrinsic interweaving running through various segments of the 
universal sequence of forms. Abandoning the spurious quest after a 
specific type of cognition as means to assess the actual existence of the 
merely possible things and beings we would, in this roundabout way, 
find such means in the a priori existential postulate intrinsic to the 
universal order of Being; 'by the same stroke the traditional metaphysics 
would be once more vindicated. 
Ingarden does not evidence awareness of this striking development 
inherent to his research yet, following his avowed line of investigation 
that is seeking to approximate as closely as possible the situation of the 
real world and consciousness, both this line as well as its subjacent 
metaphysical thread of inquiry into the universal sequence of forms 
evolve towards a concern with actual existence. They seek access to it 
in the empirical realm. 
In the first line of the argument we have now to ask how the real 
world's intrinsic progress of change and becoming is organized. What are 
its determining factors? Is it in its components predetermined from 
within or does it allow the intrusion of external influences (e.g. pure 
consciousness) and to what degree? Since, according to Ingarden, the 
network of the causal mechanism of action is promoting and regulating 
motion and change, that is, the progress - constructive and destructive -
of reality setting its borderlines, he will approach the question of the 
intrinsic determinism/indeterminism through the investigation of the 
causal structure of the domain of the real world. Through the bias of 
physical action Ingarden expects to venture directly into the material 
realm of actual existence. From this perspective can the "body as expe-
rienced" (Leib) rejoin "external body" (Korper) and reveal itself in its 
"essential state"? 
In the second line of the argument the question arises whether the 
universal sequence of objects has to be understood as the inventory of a 
static skeleton or as the program of the universe. In other words, can this 
rational substructure serve for the universal becoming of which the 
domain of the real world seems to be the center? 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
341 
The question of freedom having attained the focus of attention, it will 
have to be pursued further in the specifically human type of action: the 
moral action. 
Founded simultaneously in both, the real world and the human 
monad/soul, referring essentially to ideal values, the moral action appears 
as the most promising approach, but also as the last resort, in investi-
gating the links between Nature, pure consciousness and the ideal realm. 
Thus, first gropingly, then deliberately, Ingarden switches from basic 
objects to ACTION as the eventual key to the universal interweaving of the 
domains of objects and to the conditions of actual existence. 
PART/II 
ACTION AS THE KEY TO ACTUAL EXISTENCE 
Chapter I 
IS THE MECHANISM OF EMPIRICAL ACTION IN INGARDEN'S 
CONCEPTION THE KEY TO THE UNITY OF BEING? 
1. Can the Causal Structure of the Empirical World Count for a 'Material 
Ontology?' 
It seems that Ingarden's inquiry into the causal structure of the empirical 
world is meant to constitute a counterpart of the purely eidetic analysis 
of the 'possibles', as well as to establish the basic ground for the inter-
locking of different types of objects within the real world. 90 
Ingarden's expectation underlying his investigation of the causal 
structure of the real world, hinted at in the 2nd volume of the Controversy, 
seems to be that through the mechanism of empirical action within the 
material domain of the world we may establish the unity of the hetero-
genous domains of objects present within it. Furthermore, he attempts to 
account for the dynamic undercurrent of the real world and its progress 
in terms of this mechanism of empirical action as seen in the causal 
nexus, a new conception of which is elaborated. This dynamic under-
current appearing in the form of events and processes may be seen as the 
'material' content of the real world. 

342 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
We may expect to come closer to the concrete, actual existence and 
to the problem of the status of the real world which is at stake. A crucial 
breakthrough for Ingarden's formulation of the Idealism/Realism issue 
may be hoped for. 
Indeed, Ingarden's reflection following his ontological analysis of 
formal structures of beings and of the region of the world culminates, 
as we have seen, in his aporetic rather than definite treatment of the 
possible junctions among different domains of heterogenous types of 
beings. Let us recall that in this consideration three types of problems 
are objects of concern: (a) whether there can be a sufficient intrinsically 
established unity among and between divergent domains of beings to 
enable their entry into one world; (b) whether the possibility of several 
'worlds', each containing some of the domains is to be considered; (c) 
whether we can establish the distinctive unity of the one real world. The 
treatment of this question is only hinted at in the Controversy. Further-
more, in Ingarden's distinctions among types of beings the basic division 
falls between autonomous beings and intentional objects. This division 
corresponds to one aspect of the existential status of the real world with 
respect to conscious acts. Consequently, the possible relations between 
the domain of real objects and conscious acts constitute the key to 
Ingarden's formulation of the problem Idealism/Realism. The concern 
which predominates in this reflection remains the same: "Is Husserl 
right in assuming that the world is existentially totally and uniquely 
dependent upon transcendental consciousness?" 
As we have seen, this investigation of possible relations between the 
real world and consciousness has been concluded in the 2nd volume of 
the Controversy, by Ingarden, in proposing by elimination three solutions 
as a priori possible. But, we are still far from any real progress in the 
actual formulation of the Idealism/Realism issue so long as, firstly, the 
unity of the region of the world is not investigated from the material 
point of view, that is, so long as no concrete mechanism of its dynamic 
network is established. It seems that the emphasis which Ingarden - over 
against Husserl - puts upon transcendent reality leads him to consider 
such a possible mechanism of reality as an eventual foundation for the 
concatenation of different domains of beings. Secondly, we cannot make 
any decisive step towards confronting the real world and consciousness 
so long as we do not know whether the intrinsic concatenation of the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
343 
world's dynamic processes is radically self-determined or allows for a 
flexibility. 
Lastly, since as we will show, the phenomenologically unreduced con-
ception of the causal nexus in Ingarden's thought is bound up with his 
analytic conception of the intrinsic ontic structure of the real individual, 
the decisive question is whether in this material ontological structure of 
the world a matching basis and guideline in the real individual necessary 
for a dynamic sequence of action can be found. These questions present 
obviously the radical challenge to Ingarden's causal analysis: can it fulfil 
the role which would in this framework be attributed to 'material 
ontology'? 
Ingarden, in beginning his inquiry into the causal structure of the 
world, assumes it must be possible to formulate certain concrete questions 
that could be answered on the basis of the 'empirical knowledge of the 
world' and which, in this way, complete our knowledge of the world 
gained from the pure formal ontology, so far discussed. It seems as if 
such a completion was expected by him to fulfil several tasks. The 
foremost one would be to decide whether his ontological a priori form of 
the region of the world has a bearing upon, or remains in relation to, 
the empirical world of everyday experience. This question, that, on the 
one hand, takes several specific forms, appears as the apex of the inquiry 
into the stratified ontological structure of beings - on the other hand, 
it constitutes the crucial question concerning the nature of the world. 
Indeed, the specific point of the structural opening towards the exchange 
of properties within the real individual and thereby to interior processes, 
on the one side, and the connectedness of the direct causal nexus as the 
ordering system of the world (Zusammenhang) on the other, is seen by 
Ingarden as the possibility of a unifying concatenation system of being 
(Seinszusammenhang). 
In this respect Ingarden, following Leibniz, understands the causal 
relation firstly, by restricting its validity exclusively to the real world of 
the previously described type; secondly, again in the traces of Leibniz, 
in so far as the members of this connection are concerned, he seems, from 
among various types of connectedness in which one being is seen as 'the 
reason' of another, to consider as 'causal' exclusively a specific type of 
cause-to-effect relation valid only among real individual beings. This 
relation cannot occur between different types of beings (e.g. the poet and 

344 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
his poem). In the causal network of the world Ingarden sees first the 
main foundation for the unity of the world. Secondly, he ventures an 
affirmation, which within the above outlined scheme of his analysis 
appears strikingly unexpected - if not unwarranted by any evidence pre-
viously produced; at issue is whether the causal network as foundation 
of the real world accountsfor the fact of this world's diversification into a 
manifold of beings; that is, can the causal network be the means of 
distribution and the occasion for the existence of a variety of types of 
beings within the world which make it an 'objective sphere of beings' 
rather than one single object? 
This initial assumption by which, in fact, Ingarden precedes his inquiry 
into the causal relation appears as a reverse of his previously, not only 
methodological but, what seems more significant, ontological assump-
tions. First of all, it would seem, surprisingly, indeed, that it is the 
empirical observation as used also in the sciences that is called to complete 
and even support the a priori ontological results. But the most baffling 
shift in Ingarden's thought is that he identifies the empirically conducted 
causal inquiry as the appropriate method to treat these major problems. 
Shall we find in this shift a phenomenologically valid way out of the 
ontologico-intentional circle? But in doing so, shall we not either fall 
into the trap of a 'naive' pseudo-scientific empiricism or remain with a 
radical dichotomy within the scheme of Ingarden's philosophical recon-
struction between all the domains of objects referring existentially to the 
naive empirical foundation and the transcendent ideal objects? 
2. The Conception of the Causal Network within the World as the Basis 
for Necessary Links among Facts 
We start our investigation by giving all possible credit to Ingarden's 
proposal. In fact, the opening statements made by Ingarden lead us to 
believe that it is with the material content ofthe 'objectivity' distinguished 
by him previously in the formal analysis of the structures that he will 
deal. Furthermore, we might, as we have already mentioned, expect 
here a methodological conversion from the apodictically certain but only 
'possible' to the actual by finding an access to the empiria, and by digging 
into the specificity of nature; by some stroke we might be able to assess 
its concordance with the actualy existing world in another way than that 
postulated first by Ingarden. 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
345 
If such an access were accomplished we might even expect an indication 
of a link between the actual existence of things and beings and the 
material nature or empiria. Indeed, some new factors emerging from 
such an inquiry could emerge that would either reveal this specific mode 
of cognition which Ingarden postulated as necessary to assess the actual 
existence of the merely possible. Or the nature of the linkage among the 
disparate domains of objects might prove itself capable of establishing 
the actual existence through some modality of Being other than of cogni-
tion. This is to say that Ingarden's proposition to investigate the causal 
nexus in this new way may raise high hopes for the advance of the major 
controversy of Idealism/Realism, hopes so high as to find the unknown 
key to a hidden door of metaphysics. It is in the diversified perspectives 
of these expectations that we follow his progress in the investigation of 
the causal nexus in the light of the assumptions and methods which he 
applies. 
Ingarden formulates the problem of the causal relation by claiming 
that in opposition to the classic and current approach which takes 
cause and effect as isolated pairs of events remaining in a specific inter-
connectedness - an approach which according to him is artificial - the 
causal relation should be envisaged within a larger set of inter-relations 
of which such an isolated two-member couple is but a part of a larger 
system of similar cases. For this initial claim he gives no other support 
than that it 'must' be so within the real world. From the start he proceeds 
thus throughout his inquiry, partly on the ground of commonsense 
observation, partly on the ground of the results, problems, and concepts 
of technical empirical science. He proposes to bring to light some new 
features of the causal nexus as they appear within a complete chain of 
causal relations and have remained hidden in the hitherto performed 
investigations in which the causal nexus was envisaged in isolation from 
its other founding interrelations. We recall, however, that already in 
Kant the transcendental dialectic envisaged the causal relationship as an 
element of a chain of an interconnected series. Ingarden points out, how-
ever, that his approach is different from Kant's, who has been mainly 
concerned with the problem of the beginning of the world - that is in its 
linear progress from the beginning of this chain through its continuation 
in space, whereas he proposes that causal relations develop spreading 
within the world in various directions in space as well as in time. It is in 

346 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
the form of such a spread that Ingarden sees in them the essential formal 
element of the world system. 9 1 
In this way Ingarden believes, on the one hand, he has avoided the 
trap into which Kant fell, namely that to limit the spread of the causal 
chain to linear form means to conceive of causality merely as an a priori 
form of pure reason. This conception corresponds to Kant's splitting the 
notion of Being into two basically different types of becoming: one 
within the transcendental world and the other of 'things in themselves'. 
On the other hand, however, there still remains the question which we 
have already brought up, whether Ingarden's abstractions from the 
epistemological perspective will suffice to overcome the type of dualism 
between the ontological and empirical layers of reality. Indeed, the major 
intent of his enterprise is to show that the causal relation is strictly con-
nected with the form of the real world as revealed by formal ontology. 
From this statement of facts that the causal nexus is spread 'in millions 
of cases' in all directions within the world, Ingarden draws two proposals: 
one, to establish the concept of distribution of the causes and effects 
corresponding to each other, of an event occurring within the real world; 
second, to establish the concept of the reach (Bezirk) of the causes and 
effects that belong to one and the same event. 92 The basis of his inquiry, 
its groundwork, so to speak, consists in the treatment of various aspects 
of these issues. Ultimately the antithetic issue of the determination/ 
indeterminism situation lies within the real world which is in the offing. 
The essential new factor which Ingarden brings into this investigation 
which then constitutes the foundation to establish the necessity of the 
causal nexus - over against Hume's conception of its arbitrariness - and 
as the foundation of the spread within the world of causal relations as 
larger segments of chains or nets, is the statement that the causal nexus 
would reside in some formal relations among the material content of the 
respective facts in which the causal relation consists. Then certain ele-
ments or state of affairs of this 'material content', which call for their 
counterpart as an indispensable completion in being (Seinskomplement) 
would be essential factors of what he calls 'direct cause'. Through this 
incompleteness and an essential need to fill it out, 'the cause' calls into 
being the so-called 'effect'. 
This constitutes its 'force' or 'activity'. It is worth emphasizing that 
this 'force' or 'activity' is understood, on the one hand, as expressing 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
347 
- or residing in - the material incompleteness of the world-factors. On 
the other hand, it shows the specific relativity of each and every possible 
cause being in its very being a factual element of the world taken as a 
whole. 93 
It is upon this formal relationship among the elements of the material 
content of the factors of the world that Ingarden establishes his con-
ception of the causal network with which are connected and wherefrom 
follow all his further considerations. 
3. The Physicalistic Notions of 'Force' and 'Action' 
The notions of 'force' and 'action' are introduced into the causal con-
sideration as partly common-sense, partly physicalistic concepts of the 
positive science. With the progress of the inquiry, we might ask whether 
the notions of 'force' and 'action' do not reside in the ideal mechanism 
of which the empirical facts and observations with which Ingarden 
carries on his quest are nothing but empirical exemplification of onto-
logical structure of the causal ,iexus. With this in mind we will approach 
lngarden's intention which was to establish against tradition that there 
is a necessary type of connectedness in the causal nexus. The need of 
complementariness within the material content of facts is introduced as 
a possible foundation for establishing the necessity of the causal relation-
ship and of the causal network. Ingarden seems to presume that the 
necessity of this type of interconnectedness among events is of primary 
importance to account for the unity of the otherwise chaotic conglom-
erate of aggregates within the world. A search for the foundation of the 
necessity of some interworldly linking of natural facts seems according 
to him to underly also the investigations of positivistic-empirically 
oriented comtemporary physics. 
In this direction already from the very start a familiar distinction is 
introduced albeit in a new guise: the distinction between the problem of 
necessary connection between two objects - a connection that would 
refer to essential laws - and the factual occurrence within the world of 
cases in which such a state of affairs would be actualized. The second 
does not follow from the first. Furthermore, a repetitive occurrence of 
facts coupled together does not indicate the necessity of the causal 
relation within the couples; it may reside in the causal relations of these 
factors taken individually with other factors interrelated within a larger 

348 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
set. What should we then consider in order to establish the necessity of 
the causal nexus even between two factors? We need, says Ingarden, to 
assume an underlying scheme-work of the regularity of nature itself. Such 
an assumption seems to Ingarden indispensible also for the discovery 
and formulation of strict empirical laws in science. Here, however, 
Ingarden makes a crucial distinction by means of which he directs his 
investigation and its status to the side of the phenomenological, essential 
analysis, as over against the purely scientific approach. He affirms, 
namely, that "As long as the statement about the 'regularities' of nature 
is not explicated (erwiesen) in a way independent of the laws of expe-
rience, the so-called 'universal' laws of nature (which are causal only in 
name) are nothing more than extrapolations from purely statistical laws 
which limit themselves to the statement of facts and couples of facts so 
far stated." 94 Thereby a reference to essential structures of beings and 
state of affairs is emphasized. 
The investigation, thus outlined, and aiming at the establishment of 
the necessity of the causal nexus, is then carried on first by what we 
cannot fail to identify as the formal essential investigation of all the 
'possible' relations between occurrence (Vorgang) and event (Ereignis) 
in various permutations and combinations taking them in relations. 95 
Then, a distinction is introduced and exemplified between the type of 
'cause' in the original (ursprunglich) and 'derived' (abgeleitet) sense (e.g. 
when we take into consideration the whole process of the architectonic 
planning of a building together with the actual activity of constructing 
this building in a derived sense. An 'originary' can be, in contradistinc-
tion, considered only as the singular cause-effect segments which bring 
about/cause the actualization concretely step by step of the whole system 
of planning and constructing). These singular strictly and directly linked 
cause-effect segments are affirmed as the foundation of the complete 
system and of its actualization. Their connectedness is then stressed by 
Ingarden as the connectedness in being of the interworldly facts them-
selves. 96 This inquiry is carried on obviously on two different levels, first 
as an eidetic quest of necessary connections among empirical concepts 
which are taken from radically divergent levels partly from the procedures 
of scientific results and partly from the concrete reality. We should 
wonder about the legitimacy of the relevance of the one to the other as 
well as about the justification of the empirical concepts as representing 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH H USSERL ,349 
a common-sense description of the empirically given reality. There is no 
question of seeking its legitimacy in the content of ideas and yet, as we 
shall see, not only no other clarification is provided but it is essentially 
ideal connectedness (or in what we probably could consider as ideal 
types of complex interconnectedness - in contradistinction to the simple 
ones established in the guise of existential connectedness, which Ingarden 
derives from his 'empirical' analysis, or rather, perhaps, introduces), that 
furthers the advancing inquiry. Indeed, this previously treated formal 
analysis of the material content of events incomplete in their endowment 
demands with necessity to be complemented and we are led to draw con-
clusions about a major point concerning the causal nexus. Since on this 
analysis the second event is necessarily called into existence by the first, 
due to the insufficiency in being of the latter, the so-called 'effect' occurs 
simultaneously with the actualization in being of the first one. That is, 
since an event in order to be a cause has first to come to be it has in its 
material content to be completed by another event which it calls forth 
into being as its necessary completion. In this sense the causal nexus in 
'direct causality' opposed by Ingarden to its classic and current con-
ception implies, instead of their succeeding each other, the simultaneity 
in time of cause and effect. 
Such a conception of the causal nexus considered as a separate rela-
tional unity reposing in itself would amount to nothing more than some 
sort of intrinsic existential connection between two elements. They are 
seen to be dependent in their being upon each other in such a way that 
the one could not constitute the unit that could exist alone without the 
other, had it not been for the assumption previously made by Ingarden 
that the direct cause-effect nexus is but a segment of a complete causal 
set within which the different founding modes and ways of their unifying 
interlocking are distributed; it is precisely this mechanism of the direct 
causal relation which in turn is the basis of the set itself. 
4. Formal Concepts of 'Activity' and 'Actuality' 
Ingarden develops further concepts of 'action' and of 'actuality' by 
way of the formal-empirically exemplified analysis. Opposing the specifi-
cally 'static' type of what appears as a 'causal relation' but what in the 
perspective of his Leitfaden is not, namely, between state of affairs among 
mathematical objects (in which the element of 'effect' is merely a com-

350 
BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
plement 'of an insufficient condition') to a causal relation between two 
concrete occurrences (Vorgiinge) (the encounter of which brings into 
being (Ins-Sein-Rufen) another state of affairs), he emphasizes the 
'dynamic existential' feature of causality by relating it to becoming and 
action. Such a case of the causal nexus releasing an action or instance 
of becoming is possible only within the realm of real objects. The direct 
cause is only the final member of a set of circumstantial occurrences, 
and is made 'active' through the mechanism of material links among 
empirical factors coming together in a certain way. That is, without this 
larger spread of interconnected elements in such a way that they are 
interlocked in a chain of a mechanism, not only the element becoming 
the 'cause' could not generate an active claim for its completion but it 
would also remain incapable of bringing about the 'event' as its 'effect'. 
The 'activating' and 'actualizing' potential-mechanism and its situation 
is a causal cluster as its final member. 97 
This realization of the event by the cause is what Sigwart understands 
by "the activity of the cause." Ingarden prefers, however, to call it 
'effect' or 'result' (Wirkung, Effekt).98 It is worth noting that this causal 
conception of action remains in direct correspondence with the notion of 
'action' and its 'radius'. Ingarden has introduced it in connection with 
the question of various ways of interlocking among heterogeneous realms 
participating in the world domain although belonging to different 
domains, e.g. of heteronomous types of beings (e.g. social beings). It 
seems, in fact, that there is in question a type of intentional action, due 
to which the intentional sphere would be essentially transformable and 
changeable while the real individual was to remain in a net of causal 
relations of his being - which by remaining virtually complete allow also 
his structural essential stability. 99 
However, with the assumption of the simultaneity of the cause and 
effect arises the difficulty of which Ingarden is well aware, namely, that 
without a provision to be found within the foundation of the causal 
relation of the temporal, succession within the real world itself would 
vanish. Should we then take the Heraclitian position on the nature of 
the world, namely, that the whole world-process is played all at once? 
If the temporal structure of the world has to be negated would we not 
have to abandon all the previously gained results of formal ontology 
concerning the nature of types of beings and abandon totally the program 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
351 
of our phenomenological, eidetic and transcendental inquiry? To save 
the situation Ingarden, obviously, can only make a complete tum back-
wards. Indeed, not only does he refer to the chain extension of the non-
direct causal segments within one and the same causal set, to guarantee 
the temporal spread - whereas simultaneous is always the last segment 
only - but first of all, he makes direct recourse to formal ontology by 
maintaining that perdurance of processes which empirically establishes 
the sequences of temporality in the world, instead of seeing the world as 
only one instantaneous event - is guaranteed by the identical factors 
(objects) perduring within the world process from one temporal phase 
to another. That is, identity in perdurance of things and at other times 
of resisting objects is the foothold of temporal and causal extension. 
The same reference to the intrinsic ontological structure of real objects 
as allowing externally conditioned properties - but first, of all whose 
intrinsic nucleus of essential identity has to be assumed - permit Ingarden 
to bring forth further concepts necessary for the exfoliation of the causal 
relationship, such as the one of the 'state of an object' as its successive, 
that is time extended, determination (Folge-Bestimmtheit). He identifies 
it with the TA SYMBEBEKOTA of Aristotle. This should not be confused 
with the cluster of matters that, already present within a real object, 
invariably persist in time; neither should it be identified with the object's 
'individual nature' as has been described in formal ontology proper. 
The so conceived state of things persisting in a succession of temporal 
phases is meant to serve as the ultimate point of explanation for being 
and becoming as expressed, partly at least, by the chain mechanism of 
the causal relationship. too 
The reference to the formal structure of objects necessitated by the 
analysis of the causal linkage chain gives, on the one hand, the suspicion 
that their introduction at this point is but the extension of the analysis 
of those structures. Indeed, either this reference, obviously indispensable, 
makes us wonder whether we are not continuing the inquiry carried along 
the lines of eidetic insight into structural interconnectedness of relations 
and things with only the order of the exposition being reversed through 
a start made seemingly from the empirical observation, which in fact is 
now demasked as a mere way of exemplification. Or are we dealing, as 
it seemed at the opening stage, with two different levels at once, the 
eidetic and the empirical, philosophically uncritically accepted level, 

352 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
while bringing both into parallel, drawing from this parallel a philosophi-
cally illegitimate or at least unjustified procedure and consequently being 
left in the dark. 
5. Is the Causal Network as Foundation of the Dynamic Mechanism of 
the Real World Sufficient to Account for the World-Progress? 
Ingarden does not lose sight of the major issue concerning the empirical 
world of aggregates: the world order. It remains to be seen how he 
accounts for it. Even assuming that the causal mechanisms uniting the 
aggregates into dynamic fragments could be considered sufficient as the 
basic approach to the microcosmic process - to use Whitehead's expres-
sion - activating otherwise stationary elements, nevertheless, we did not 
approach, in that manner, the great question of the macrocosmic 
organization of the aggregates leading to an explanation of the universal 
world-process. In fact, can we in terms of such a fragmentary structural 
approach reach the very ground of this kernel of questions concerning 
the imperturbable flux of coming to be and passing away which carries 
the tiny and fragile fragments of objective constructs bringing them into 
being and destroying them at ease? That is one of the basic questions 
which will have to be addressed to Ingarden's enterprise. For the time 
being we must show how Ingarden has, at least in part, attempted to 
face it in his predelineated way. 
The question is formulated by him along the antithesis continuity/ 
discontinuity, and assuming that there is a unity within the real world 
Ingarden raises the question of the types of this unity. His formulation 
and discussion of this issue draw again upon the inquiry of physical 
science. Should we assume - here again his method of procedure is not 
clear - that the world would be one closed system in which everything 
therein remains bound with everything else in the same way within one 
system or whether there would be several systems within the world. 
To begin with, he proposes an assumption the explanation for which 
will be given later on, that there are reasons to believe in a conception 
of the world as composed of several 'relatively isolated systems' .101 This 
conception allows Ingarden to draw several important conclusions con-
cerning the problem of the world, e.g. from an eidetic analysis of all the 
possible combinations and permutations which on the basis of science 
can be drawn about interworldly relationships, Ingarden distinguishes 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
353 
several types of interworldly determinations of a relative nature lifting 
thereby the antithesis of absolute determinism or indeterminism posi-
tions, etc. 
Nevertheless, what is essential for our purpose, namely, the relevance 
of this conception of causality as the basic mechanism of the real world 
to the problem of the status of the real world in the perspective of the 
Idealism/Realism formulation within the framework of investigation 
outlined and pursued by Ingarden is the recognition of the fact that this 
discussion did not devise any new method, but its ultimate ground remains 
a formal ontological inquiry. The unity within the world is sought with 
reference to the formal concepts of the world extended to relational 
links and mechanism. They are established with final reference to the 
ontologico-formal structure of the individual object. 102 
Although the hopes raised by introducing physical action as a possible 
link between the ideal and physical realms are disappointed, action 
reappears in Ingarden's reflection in a more complete modality. Will it 
prove up to the occasion? 
Chapter II 
HUMAN ACTION, FREEDOM AND VALUES 
There is still another major perspective in which Ingarden may be inter-
preted as seeking intuitively a key to the various problems which confront 
his gigantic enterprise and have in the so far discussed investigations 
found no adequate formulation. This perspective may be seen in his 
rather fragmentary and sketchy but penetrating addition to his already 
presented attempt to see in what way the human individual would be a 
specific type of the real autonomous individual. In fact, we have already 
seen in his early works, a critique of the psychophysiological theory of 
knowledge, which in itself presents only a preparatory step towards 
establishing the need for phenomenological analysis of intentionality, 
but it brings marginally and by way of exemplification a larger extent 
of human experience. It is only natural then in the analysis of Ingarden 
that turning his attention directly to man he will attempt to go beyond 
the realm of consciousness. 
And, in fact, seeking to find a way out of the circle of the Husserlian 

354 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
transcendentalism towards a 'realistic' status of the real world that is 
transcending the reach of pure consciousness, it is to the specific nature 
of man that he might tum his attention. Should man appear in a direct 
analysis a specific type of being combining not only the constituting 
consciousness responsible for intentionality, but at the same time tran-
scending this very system of constitution as a real individual, could he 
not reveal also the key to the other great issue confronting Ingarden's 
framework as his analysis progressed, namely, that to the unity of the 
heterogeneous domains of beings? - that is, the ideal realm of structures, 
of intentional objects, of the empiric realm still unaccounted for and of 
ideal values. 
That means, however, that the key sought should combine the answer 
to the specific demands of the static structures and dynamic empirical 
unfolding - which so far might have appeared correlative through the 
ontological mechanisms but which remained discontinuous - of the 
values as ultimate ideal standards of aesthetic work structure, and of the 
intentional process of receptive experience of which only the structural 
correlate has been established. But the status of intentionality with respect 
to its source in the complete empirical set of experiences, breaking into 
the intentional synthesis at every point, remained suspended in the air, 
and the relation of values although founded in structure still remained 
mysteriously aloof from it. Whereas it seems to have been introduced 
to account for the unity of the heterogeneous domains within the real 
world and man's place in it. So far, all these elements have remained in 
part interlocking, but in part are discontinuous and some even disjoined 
from the others. 
Lastly, we should not forget that there is still not the slightest hint of 
a possible specific 'experiential' modus that could claim to be envisaged 
as a possible opening towards the actuality of things and beings, which 
within the Ingardenian framework of inquiry are merely possible: that 
is, towards metaphysics as programmed by Ingarden without which the 
great controversy about the existence and status of the real world and 
man can be neither completely formulated nor decided. 
It might well be within the investigation of man, that we could discover 
the key to account for this homogeneous continuity of the human 
universe which we experience in everyday life. 
It seems, indeed, that it is in the investigation of the modalities and 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
355 
roots of ACTION, SPECIFICALLY HUMAN action, that Ingarden's hints of 
an approach to man converge. We will attempt to bring them together 
in an interpretation to this effect. Can the notion of 'action', as it appears 
in the Ingardenian approach, fulfil this key role? 
Throughout his investigation runs the thread concerned with freedom. 
He introduces it directly in the conception of man, first, in a number of 
occasional lectures concerning the conception of man which have been 
collected and posthumously published,I03 and then in his booklet on 
responsibility. 104 
Maybe the so-called "transcendence of the person," as that of a "free 
moral being," can break through the iron chain of intentionality, or, is it 
only a further extension into the moral realm, neglected by HusserI, of 
the life-world? Will Ingarden, in the footsteps of Kant, retrieve through 
moral action the actual reality, which reason hides? 
l. Time, Action and the Identity of Man 
The basic question that arises again is: "In what further way would the 
human being be a specific type of an individual?" First, Ingarden (who 
in the first volume of the Controversy emphasized the specific existential 
status of the living being, especially of man) has, as we have seen, 
elaborated it, in the formal-existential analysis of the various elements 
entering into the cluster of consciousness, and shown man to be a 
peculiar type of structure, monad/soul, unifying several autonomous but 
existentially interdependent moments. 
Second, the analytic conception of the individual, autonomous and 
atemporal being of the ideal objects, which Ingarden introduces in the 
second volume of The Controversy, is meant by him as the break through 
the transcendental universe of Husser1. 105 But previously in the Literary 
Work of Art Ingarden already emphasized the transcendence of ideal 
values, ideal qualities and ideal concepts, opposing the attitude of 
HusserI in Formal and Transcendental Logic, which, except for the ideas, 
HusserI seems to have introduced into the transcendental circle. In point 
of fact, Ingarden already stresses the importance of the ideal existential 
status of the above-mentioned entities in the preface to the first edition 
of the Literary Work of Art, insisting that without the ideal mode of 
existence no intersubjectivity of words would be possible. Their hetero-
geneous type of being which maintains the system of objectivity opposes 
the absolutism of 'pure consciousness'. 

356 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Thirdly, the notion of 'transcendence' is corroborated through the 
emphasis he puts upon the nature of beings existing in time. The 
fragility of their existence and the narrowness of the span of the actual 
present applied to the nature of consciousness itself - which he establishes 
in the Controversy as an object rather than a region of'irrealities' in the 
Husserlian sense and as essentially a flux of temporal acts, oppose the 
Husserlian claim of the absolute existential status of consciousness, but 
shows simultaneously the persistence of pure consciousness above the 
passage of the acts. 
What appears as a new and unexpected development in Ingarden's 
reflection is the corroboration of the notion of the specifically human 
aspect of the human individual through human action as rooted in the 
acts of free will and performed against the natural temporal course of 
world-events and against the temporarily articulated stream of his sponta-
neous conscious acts. 
It aims obviously at establishing the third point of transcendence 
of the person, 106 with respect to spontaneous life-world constitution: 
the moral man. We would consider, as the first step in this direction, 
Ingarden's conception of man in relation to time and freedom. But this 
step already implies the relation to absolute values. Indeed, a 'free' 
action is, in Ingarden's view, first of all a 'responsible' action with refer-
ence to absolute values - in contradistinction to impersonal, mechanical 
mobility - 'activity'. 
Therefore, the second step towards the investigation of man from 
the standpoint of action - digging deeper, penetrating the different 
domains and attempting to get a provisory look at least as to "how it 
works" - is to establish the ontological foundation of responsibility. 
We will first attempt to approach the above stated issues in the perspec-
tive of the first viewpoint taken by Ingarden. 
To initiate the investigation into the specifically human aspect of 
man as a moral man, Ingardeh raises the question of his identity.107 
Indentity immediately introduces the problem of time. Indeed, there is 
an important reason why the notion of man is so intimately linked with 
temporality. And it is not without a reason of paramount importance 
that the identity of man, which is revealed through Ingarden's reflective 
sketchy fragments rather than in an analysis of an argument and rather 
than through a phenomenological type of investigation, is essentially 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
357 
linked to various ways in which temporality is the continuous thread of 
interest running through different realms of the Ingardenian universe. 
In contradistinction to Husserl's conviction in Ideas I of the absolute 
status of the transcendental temporality, Ingarden distinguishes basically 
the temporality of intentional processes as radically different from the 
temporality of real beings persisting in 'objective time', etc. Do they 
reunite now? 
In point of fact, time and motion are convertible notions and they 
enter into different structural patterns in various ways which are 
decisive factors relative to the internal consistency of beings as well as 
to their subsequent continuous or instantaneous existence. And is not 
action a specific modality of motion? 
Consequently, the question of identity comes first when we ask 
ourselves from what side to approach the human individual, to see in 
which way he is a peculiar variation of the real autonomous being. As 
we have seen, as such, he may have different degrees of ontological 
intrinsic consistency which to a greater or lesser extent allow for externally 
conditioned motion to corrode his intrinsic tendencies and to open him 
to a play of circumstances. Then, as a conscious being, he follows the 
flux of time. Yet, the striking observation which Ingarden makes 
initiating his reflection upon man's identity is that "feeling myself 
always the same man, I feel simultaneously myself in my most profound 
essence independent of time." 108 
Following Ingarden's reflection, if I ask myself what does my identity 
consist of, I distinguish myself first of all as repeatedly identical through 
the course of my experience and action. 109 More than that, I myself, 
am a persistent, individual being, which is none else but a real person. IIO 
In contra-distinction to the passing flux of experience which occurs 
spontaneously, I build myself as a person through my 'human' activity. 
My activity is constructive, in so far as, on the one side, it is directed 
towards the transcendent reality ofthe world. On the other side, however, 
it is caused by transcendent forces of the world. In this mode of self-
experience, although I am aware of my identity, I develop myself within 
the three phases of time: the past, which bears heavily upon the present, 
the present which is oriented towards the future. In respect to the problem 
of man's identity, two types of time-experience are delineated. 111 
In the natural flow of time, in which our survival as an individual 

358 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
within the texture of the actual world progresses onward with the cyclic 
process of nature, we unfold what is virtually foreinstalled within us so 
that the great anonymous scheming of Nature may be fulfilled and 
accomplished. Having played our insignificant part in it, after all our 
resources are spent, we vanish into oblivion. 
If we go counter to this otherwise irreversible flux of events, when 
through our dedicated and self-denying effort, we choose to enact 
another part in human existence than that of nature, we may, indeed, 
choose to devote our life, so inexorably passing away, to tasks of our 
innermost concerns in which we believe. We are then indifferent whether 
they find their way into gregarious acceptance, or whether they will 
enliven the practical existence of the individual's primitive needs. We 
believe in their own intrinsic worth which verifies itself at 'higher' 
levels of the personal life. And we put all at stake to serve this call 
from within - even if it appears in the actual world as a lost cause. In 
doing so, we reverse the inexorable flux of change. 
By these most intimate decisions, step by step, man becomes free 
to make further decisions about his innermost concerns and to commit 
himself to them, no matter what life is (that is, 'normal' life with the usual 
pressures, as strong as they may be). 
Man is countering the inexorability of time working within himself 
in his own moral life, as a recluse of freedom, and a source of un-
breakable strength of purpose, and thus giving a new significance to his 
existence. 
Instead ofletting - as Heidegger says - 'das Man', the human, common 
doom take over, we have to keep constantly awake, aware of what there 
is in us. But, and here already the critical point lurks: how do we discover 
it otherwise than in this perpetual immersion in the 'Man' of common 
doom? Without feeling it down to the marrow of our bones, how could 
we distinguish, distill from all this anonymous material of Nature our 
uniquely, innermost concerns? How could we, being in the midst of the 
immeasurable and yet anonymously futile chaos of the onrushing flux 
of life, discover by sifting it through our complete system of functioning? 
What is it that truly matters to us and which is unique in our own task 
and calling? 
Indeed, it is clear from his sketchy reflection that Ingarden has not 
remained unaware of this great moral and metaphysical issue of the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
359 
paradox of human freedom. The crucial point of his reflections about man 
lies precisely in his conviction that time, the very pulp of man's life and 
man's intimate freedom to choose for himself, are an axis of existence. 
Should we follow this hint given by Ingarden and assume this 
perspective - should it in fact be possible to establish philosophically 
the concept of human freedom as he has outlined it - would we not be 
vindicating - although in a much more elaborate fashion - the Kantian 
set-up of philosophical recontruction in which metaphysics enters the 
field of transcendental schematism of the self-enclosed circumference 
of reason, on the one hand, and the 'absolute' realm of transcendent 
'things in themselves' on the other hand, precisely through the gate of 
freedom of will? 112 
But the immediate question arises, whether within the Ingardenian 
framework the freedom of will, as rooted in action, is altogether possible. 
Will moral action as conceived by him do what physical action failed 
to do, namely, to break both the ideal and the transcendental scheme to-
wards the empirical world? 
However, as we have mentioned, the much sought after identity 
of the specifically human aspect of man reaches deeper than the 
ontological substructure of the real individual. Action, specifically to 
'moral' action, is related more specifically to the personal identity; they 
are in Ingarden's thought reversible; one comes about through the 
other. We may follow the natural unfolding of our stream of con-
sciousness and remain immersed within it; that is, carried along the 
temporal sequence of temporality, submitting in our natural fragility 
to its laws. We may, on the contrary, undertake to master its course 
ourselves, and the impact it has upon us through the performance of 
free decisions and deeds. 113 
Thus action and the now envisaged human action, qualified as 'moral', 
appears first as a constructive factor. 
As we have stressed above, Ingarden interprets the notion of the 
'human person' as 'transcending' first, the actual acts and the dimensions 
of pure consciousness as well as affectivity in which it is constituted; 114 
then also those acts in which it experiences itself as perduring in time. 
Also, Husserl saw that the person, built in the complete, constitutive 
process, through a manifold of 'habitus', which maintain themselves 
in a specific unity throughout the advancing flux of the streaming acts, 

360 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
'transcends' their ever passing flow. But, as extending into the life-world, 
the so conceived personal being of man is in Husserlian thought its 
integral part. Is there, in this respect, an advance over Husserl in 
Ingarden's treatment of the transcendence of the person? Could not 
Ingarden's intention be interpreted as an attempt to assess the transcen-
dence of the person over the life-world as well? That is, he would have 
liked to find in this conception the point of a 'realistic' break-through 
from the transcendental circle, a breakthrough which the aesthetic 
transcendence of the Work of Art failed to offer. 
It could be a valid claim with respect to his own conception of the 
real world, which in fact, as long as its material analysis is extant and the 
fundamental unity among the different heterogeneous domains of 
beings is not established, remains ultimately a physicalistic-empirical 
conception, philosophically thematized only through the ontological 
structures. - In Ingarden's pluralism of separated ontological sets of 
domains of beings, there is missing, in fact, the acknowledgement of the 
now common good of phenomenology, that is, of the world seen as 
homogeneous transcendental life-world. And yet, whatever limitations 
we might set to the Husserlian claim of its absolute validity, a claim which 
has been progressively disproved by thinkers such as Sartre, Merleau-
Ponty and Husserl's own investigations interpreted anew, it remains 
evident that the continuity of human existence, development and action 
is due to this homogeneous all-embracing unity of the life-world. And 
yet, if first we consider that in Ingarden's view all cultural and social 
phenomena, like the works of art, are purely intentional and that even 
the person might 'transcend' the individual conscious acts - which 
still appear in the analysis as 'objects', that is, as correlates of intentional 
acts - we might wonder whether it is not merely at the abstract onto log-
icallevel that the Ingardenian domains of objects may be differentiated. 
In the intentional concrete flux of experience do they not appear - as in 
Husserl's thought - in the homogeneous transcendental unity? 
The 'transcendence' of the person cannot then, in Ingarden's thought, 
be considered as a point towards the overcoming of the transcendental 
circle, as long as, firstly, Ingarden did not come to confront it with 
the conception of the life-world. It is not only by conceiving man as 
transcending his founding functions in their mere operations but in 
their operative reach - that is, as transcending the limits of the transcen-

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
361 
dental life-world - that we could speak about reaching the gate to an 
epistomological realism. But, so far, Ingarden remained at the level of 
the physicalistic universe as a phenomenologically unreduced product 
of scientific and common-sense speculation. We may ask whether the 
unity which he attempts to establish does concern, in fact, the world 
as such, as well as the unity of the All, of the complete universal schema 
of the human and world condition? 
Can the notion of the person as countering the temporal constitutive 
sequence through the 'moral Action' find an access to the very conditions 
of reality? 
To take up again our previous hint of criticism, this counter process, 
instituting the moral 'freedom' of action, does not unfold out of nothing! 
Neither does it seem to be pre-installed nor pre-given; nor does it appear 
to be flowing nor to be wrought out of itself. 
On the contrary, it seems to be a fruit of a conquest over ourselves 
in a constant struggle with our own nature, our congenital passivity 
to flow with the flux oflife, our congenital turpitude to immerse ourselves 
into the great ocean of natural progress; to let ourselves be lulled to 
sleep, and to sleep deeply, letting things take their course. Here lies the 
paradox of conscious 'freedom' in the polarity of two opposed forces: 
constraint-liberation. 
Even at this critical point at which man becomes the master of his 
own being, over against all the other elements of the actual world, he 
has to wring it from the very same elemental realm which threatens his 
fragile system of functions at every point: disease, accident, cataclysms, 
life routine, social contraints and obstacles to his tendencies, etc. And yet, 
it is through this system alone he can wring out his moral freedom. 
Where then does the impulse to go against the spontaneity of our acts 
come from? How is the sequence of the action countering the routine 
of the constitution articulated? 
We do not find in Ingarden's thought delineating man as an 'organic 
unity' of isolated, rational, or biological sets of operations the way to 
account for this moral act, effort, progress as stemming from and 
working in the empirical spontaneous flux of his own and the world's 
natures and yet rising above it. Ingarden will attempt within a larger 
network of relations, involving values and personal experience, to 
conjoin the two types of action: the physical with the moral one. So the 

362 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
question is not yet envisaged to its full extent. In fact, the question of 
freedom, seen in the polarity, constraint-liberation, might prove insol-
uble. Maybe it should be sought below the levels of organized biological 
systems and above the sets of fundamental rationality of intentionality 
and of ideas and ideal structures? 115 Its difficulties, just hinted at, may 
indicate that it should be raised to a different level which could account 
for not only reason but also feeling. Maybe from the closed system of 
objective conditions which make the actual human world possible, we 
should attempt to rise towards the constitution of the manifold of 
possible worlds which might prove convergent - if not synonymous with -
lifting the paradoxes of human freedom. However, there still remains 
open the necessary relation of moral action to absolute values. 116 
2. Values in the Moral Modality of Action 
As we have seen, man has been present from the start in Ingarden's 
investigations as the percipient of the work of art as well as its intentional 
founder. In the above discussed system of correlation, values have also 
been present in both the structure of the work of art and in aesthetic 
intentional experience. 117 As such they played the central role of a vehicle 
between the ontological structure and the subjective experience. How-
ever, it was not then that we raised the question of the relation between 
the existential status of values founded in the intentional structure 
and values as concretized in subjective experience. We cannot fail to 
raise this question now as values reappear playing a dominant role within 
the system of ontological foundation of responsibility, with reference to 
which Ingarden seems to attempt again to bring together through the 
angle of freedom of action the disparate domains of objects into which 
he has so far abstractively dissociated the homogeneous universe of man. 
First, following Ingarden we will attempt to establish the ontological 
system of responsibility, free decision and action, as fundamentally 
dependent upon ideal values. Then we will venture to try out his concep-
tion with respect to the embodied nature of the person. Lastly we will 
introduce man's personal conduct within the causal network of the 
world. 
It would seem that in this network of interrelations all the issues of 
freedom could appear and be solved. It seemed to be prepared by the 
eventual indeterminism of the physical world. And is not, in fact, the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
363 
great issue of freedom and man's free action at the heart of the 
controversy about the status of the world and of man? Attempting· by 
so many avenues and angles to approach the question of the status of 
the world, do we not have, ultimately, to find out whether man is bound 
to the one actual world, chooses it from among several prescribed ones, 
or creates it? It is no more the question of the universal condition, 
discussed before, of the basic-external-dependencies real-world-pure 
consciousness, but of the specifically human prerogative within this 
condition, that - from within - might change its conception. 
Consequently, we could venture to submit that the treatment of the 
issue of freedom and free action should be, in each and every approach 
to this controversy, its leit-motif running through its scheme of investi-
gation. It decides whether man has just this one and unique possibility -
as HusserI emphatically stressed - of his actually existing world to which 
he remains doomed, or whether, on the contrary, man in his condition 
is open to a variety of possible worlds. 
Does Ingarden's proposed but undeveloped indication of an approach 
towards this most complex issue appear capable of coping with its 
intricacies? Let us follow their articulations. 
First of all, 'free human action' is identified with responsible action. 
Then, all its modalities are brought back to the ontological foundation 
of responsibility which, in tum, is conceived as consisting of a network 
of necessary, ideal relations. This network serves as a rational, absolutely 
'clear and distinct' and apodictically certain platform, in which all the 
directives for the concrete action are to be sought and into exem-
plification of which are drawn concrete experiences and interrelations 
within the real world/man understood as an embodied psyche. This 
system of reference is presided over by the realm of ideal values transcend-
ent with respect to all the other factors entering into the system of respon-
sibility (that is, to the embodied person, the world, experience and action). 
As a matter of fact, in Ingarden's reflection, 'responsible action', 
following Liebniz' attitude, is necessarily bound to deliberation and 
decision; that is, to the rational mode of human cognition. More specifi-
cally, in opposition to the current tendencies in philosophy, which like 
behaviorism, pragmatism, materialism and other types of relativism, 
reduce the nature of human conduct to 'conditioning' by Nature, culture, 
and history of mankind, Ingarden sees responsible action as the result 

364 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
of the individual's 'own' decision. Hence the conception of the 
specifically human individual: man, capable of his 'own' decision. But 
one capable of his own decision can be only a 'concrete fully developed 
person', who, on the one extreme has to be a 'spiritual' (geistiges) being, 
on the other extreme has to be rooted in the complete scheme of the 
bodily system where the factors of action are supposedly founded. 
Nevertheless, 'responsible action' cannot, like breathing or digesting, 
be identified with mere bodily acts. It differs from mere bodily acts 
precisely through its essential relation to deliberation and decision which 
bring in the ultimate relation to values. 
Moral values in Ingarden's thought appear to be more than just a 
reference to principles guiding deliberation and decision, either by 
supporting or countering our natural inclinations, as is the case in the 
Leibnizean scheme of free will. They seem to play the role of depositors 
of the qualitative contents of moral experience, the modalities of which 
might be, and must be, in various degrees and nuances actualized in the 
personal subjective experience of the individual man. They are assumed 
to have an ideal existential status. They are expected by Ingarden to be 
universal and intersubjective cornerstones of moral experience and 
conduct in the role of the ontological principles. They are seen as the 
foundation of the modality of responsible action. They remain, however, 
transcendent with respect to actual conduct. 
As we have already pointed out, values, as ideal exponents of ideal 
qualities, have previously occupied important positions in the aesthetic 
and ethical realm. However, it is a specific type of values, as qualifying 
the specific type of 'objects' (Gegenstiindlichkeiten) that enters into the 
consideration of the necessary ontological network of responsible 
action. They may qualify their 'objects' in a 'positive' or in a 'negative' 
way (functioning as Werte or Unwerte). 118 Ingarden differentiates values 
relative to action in two categories: (a) values of the result of an action 
of the action itself, of the will or of the decision made by the acting person, 
of the acting person as determined by the action. We may see in Ingarden's 
reflection a provisory effort to see whether it could not be conceived as 
the final outcome of the conjoined human faculties distributed along the 
line decision/movement and accounting for such antithetic modalities as 
will/inclination, passive submission/active resistance, etc. But he does it 
only in a tentative manner while drawing all the elements relative to 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
365 
these problems into the discussion of the ontological structure of 
responsibility. Within this system of interrelations, values meant as 
ontological foundation of relations as well as of moral experience, are 
in the Platonic fashion seen by Ingarden as interconnected in a hier-
archically organized ideal realm. As the pinnacle of this array of values 
relative to moral action, Ingarden considers the antithetic value justice/ 
injustice. 119 Consequently, within this ontologic-relational schemework 
of responsibility, the failure to actualize the appropriate values calls 
necessarily for 'restitution' (Wiedergutmachen). On the contrary, their 
appropriate actualization calls for 'reward'. Therefore, the first category 
of values is coupled with a second. This category comprises (b) values 
relative to restitution, to repentance, to merit, etc. 
Within this relational system, the evaluation of the 'success' or 
'failure' of an action - and subsequently of the acting person - is to be 
seen as the result of an existential interplay (generative Seinzusammen-
hiinge) between and among the values of these two categories, in their 
positive or negative actualization in the respective actions. 120 
However, while attempting to establish this abstract relational scheme 
of responsibility, on the one hand, by referring to the ideal system of 
values, and, on the other hand, as the psychophysical system of mobility 
of man as the monad that is incorporated into the autonomous individual 
within the real world, we have to draw upon the investigation of the 
empirical realms in all their extension. First, it is the renewed question 
of the identity of the person over against the temporality of nature, then 
its extension through embodiment, and finally the integration of moral 
action into the mobility of the real world, that have to enter into con-
sideration. However, in spite of its fascinating inspiration, at the border-
line of the purely ontological-rational system of responsibility and its 
concrete, empirical bearers, Ingarden's philosophical reflection breaks 
down. 
It is apparent to the careful observer that the network of responsibility 
has been established with direct reference to the ideal status of values, 
whereas the concrete, empirical material has no other status but that of 
an exemplification of this ideal system. 121 This system, indeed, does not 
seem capable of conferring on it either methodological or philosophical 
interpretation. In point of fact, the empirical psyche, the notion of the 
'soul', the extensive discussion of the body have, in the work of Ingarden 

366 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
which is under discussion, no other status than this established by formal 
analysis and illustrated by concrete situations taken directly from a 
popularized version of biological science. 122 Undoubtedly, the discussion 
of the organism and of the several biological systems which Ingarden 
enumerates as maintaining life and guaranteeing the continuation of the 
species, offers basic hints towards our philosophical investigation. We 
can grant to his venture that his outline of possible research, if philo-
sophically interpreted, may prove relevant to the problems under dis-
cussion. But, can it tum out to be an appropriate approach to the 
problem of action? No doubt, human action is,in the basic questions 
which it poses, referring to the complete system of man's existence 
within the world. However, the major doubt arises whether the frag-
mentary hints of Ingarden's reflection about action, and the specifically 
human action, indicate the right direction to take in order to discover 
its specific articulations, its source, and to find regulative principles as 
delineating the thread of unity running through the totality of objects. 
What conditions would it have to fulfil to prove itself as the factor 
of the interplay between the structural articulation and dynamic forces 
and the gate leading out of objectivity into the All? 
3. Can Moral Action be Considered as the 'Specifically Human' Type of 
Action? 
To conclude, let us first attempt to evaluate Ingarden's approach to 
moral action with respect to his idea of man, then to see its relevance to 
the Idealism/Realism controversy. 
In Ingarden's undoubtedly original proposal of an approach to man, 
we cannot fail to distinguish at least two basic hints for the reformulation 
of perennial questions. One of them concerns the role, and the existential 
status, of values, the other introduces actions as the link unifying man 
and the world. 
Firstly, it would seem, indeed, that through the pattern of respon-
sibility, moral values as ideal objects, comparable to aesthetic ones, 
enter into the concrete domain of experience. Secondly, as we have been 
unfolding our theme, action appears as a prospective link between the 
human functioning and the causal concatenation of the world, bringing 
both together. They join upon the issue of freedom, freedom from both 
the bodily constraints of nature and hegemony of pure consciousness, 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
367 
bringing it into the light as the central issue of the Idealism/Realism 
controversy. 
The question has to be raised whether the way in which the conception 
of man, action and values is formulated allows 'action' to fulfil this role. 
We have, in the course of our critical inquiry, prepared several points 
concerning the postulates which the conception of action should answer 
in order to account for both freedom and order. 
In fact, within the Ingardenian system of human action, deliberation 
and decision - the vehicles of its alleged 'freedom' with respect to 
the (to use Husserlian concepts) spontaneous flux of constitutive genesis 
which counter the anonymous flux of natural life, representing here 
this twofold bondage - are dependent in two ways upon the system 
of unchangeable ideal values. First, with respect to the line that moral 
conduct may take. Second, going deeper, with respect to the quality of 
experience which is 'modulated', we would say, as 'moral' again in 
relation to values. Strictly related to the ideal system of values the notion 
of a responsible conduct allows, of course, for a flexibility of choice 
within the ontological foundation of action. However, man's choice is 
caught in the net of ideal regulations into which nothing of his own 
initiative can be ~ntroduced. Would emergence of action expressing man's 
own initiative be altogether possible within this network? And is man, 
on the contrary, in opposition to other real individuals, not 'specifically 
human' because of his virtualities which allow him to undertake unprece-
dented and unforeseeable initiatives without which the progress of 
culture, and for that matter, of specifically human life, would not be 
possible? The ontological foundation of responsibility as the system of 
reference for human 'free' action does not seem to account for the specific 
source of the initial impulse which, if it has to generate a course of 
development going in reverse to the constitutive 'spontaneous' sequence 
of time must surge in a different way and be triggered by another 
mechanism of human functions than that of the intentional genesis of 
the natural life-world. Finally, in order to account for the manner in 
which such an impulse finds its way into an articulated chain of acts, so 
that it may ultimately result in moral deliberations, selection and conduct, 
should we not approach the phenomenon of action first in the articulation 
of the dynamisms which would be released in order that various functions 
of man may prove themselves capable to enter into a network of 
operations? 

368 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Indeed, action, in contradistinction to singular, spontaneous 'act' (in 
the Husserlian sense of 'passive spontaneity' of conscious acts) - which 
itself already poses questions concerning the conditions of its emergence, 
its initial impulse, etc. - as we have already pointed out with respect to 
the postulates of the aesthetic investigations - cannot be envisaged 
otherwise than as a complex set of processes consisting of a concatenation 
of singular acts, articulated in its progress, in specific and varied ways, 
by their own improvised telos. It articulates human functioning into the 
complete network of interworldly situations. Ingarden, setting the 
ontological structure of responsibility as the system of reference to 
investigate action in its moral modality, draws a concrete documentation 
of his analysis from empirical factors, which make several openings into 
the various dynamisms of man. However, to approach them in this 
perspective does not allow us to outline the origin of the action from its 
source and in its articulated progress. A conception of matter itself is 
missing. 
To conclude our critical account of Ingarden's approach to man and 
action - which might have been also expected to open the gate to meta-
physics - let us formulate two constructive postulates concerning the 
role and conception of action: 
1. Should action be the factor of the 'specifically human' aspect of 
man, it would have to be a type of action that has an appropriate target 
to 'transcend', and yet be capable of bringing together in an articulated, 
methodologically justifiable philosophical interpretation of facts the 
complete sequence of things and beings in the specific modalities of their 
functioning. 
2. Should action reveal itself as the factor of freedom it would have 
then to 'transcend' the system of the constitutive ideal - intentional 
regulations and principles. 
Chapter III 
RECAPITULATION 
The Idealism/Realism issue in the phenomenological investigation, 
its impasse and its assumptions 
To conclude our succinct critical investigation of Ingarden's philosophi-
cal endeavor - and for that matter of the two classic phases of phenome-

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
369 
no logy : the transcendental one, which after having prepared the 'sub-
jective' foundation for the investigation of man and his world, has run 
into essential difficulties, and the eidetic, which has picked up their 
challenge to answer it upon an 'objective' ground, we observe that: 
(1) Although phenomenology has laid a new foundation for the inten-
tional two-line constitutive and ontological formulation of the issue 
Idealism/Realism and has considerably advanced its treatment by the 
newly perfected tools of investigation and a great wealth of insights 
concerning the two protagonists, the real world and human monad over 
the philosophical tradition, its investigations came to an impasse before 
term. Could this impasse be overcome along the same line of inquiry? 
(2) The Ingardenian inquiry itself has unfolded surreptitiously another 
line of approaching the question of the status of the real world and man 
and introduced an essential transformation into the very conception of 
metaphysics as a decisive part of Ingarden's philosophical program: to 
reach the conclusive decision about the actual existence of such or other 
state of affairs as possible according to ontological laws, lacking the 
postulated 'specific type of cognition', the ontological investigation itself 
has switched to the UNIVERSAL SEQUENCE OF OBJECTS, which it has un-
folded, for its intrinsic regulations as clues to the conditions of actualiza-
tion. 
(3) The failure, however, of Ingarden's attempt to reach the conclusive 
evidence of the conditions of actualization along this line by establishing 
the unity of the Sequence leads us to unravel the assumptions of the 
phenomenological framework as responsible for this impasse on both 
fronts: the transcendental and the eidetic. Both of Ingarden's lines of 
approach as well as that of Husserl break down at their common failure 
to account for the empirical realm, the 'infinitely small' in Pascalian 
terms, which they themselves indicate. 
(a) The Missing Segment of Experience 
Ingarden's initial project of the investigation of the Idealism/Realism 
issue, in which he proposes to take an approach radically different from 
the epistemological one of the Cartesian/Kantian tradition, as we have 
seen, has at its center the two protagonists: the real world and pure 
consciousness. The lines of research which he presents are meant as 
various paths to account for the multitude of aspects in which each of 

370 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
them and their possible relationships have to be envisaged before we can 
reach the synthetic formulation of their relation and to ascertain what 
is the status of each with respect to the other. Ingarden enters into this 
labyrinth of questions, as we have seen, deliberately through the onto-
logical bias of an apodictically certain inquiry into the permanent struc-
tures of beings and relationships among their elements as principles of 
structuration through which, it is assumed, reality may be represented 
in its rational skeleton as mirrored in the contents of ideas.-Does the 
allegedly radical tum of emphasis from the epistemological to the onto-
logical allow him to reach a definitive reformulation of the Idealism/ 
Realism issue? 
We have followed Ingarden's painstaking effort at the establishment 
of the ontological status of these two regions, each in its own right. 
The ontological investigation has proved very fruitful in bringing to 
light the basic structure of both, the real world and the pure conscious-
ness in its formal-existential aspect and has thereby clarified on several 
fundamental points the formulation of their relationship. And yet neither 
the transcendence of the real autonomous individual with respect to pure 
consciousness nor the autonomous form of the domain of the world 
suffice to guarantee it the freedom from the hegemony of pure con-
sciousness. Neither through the double transcendence of the person in 
one direction and through the soul in the other, does it in fact transgress 
the transcendental circle of intentionality. Ingarden's extensive inquiry 
into the formation of the aesthetic noema has definitely bound - instead 
of opening - the intentional process with the otherwise transcendent 
work of Art, that is with the intentional system of the life-world. 
Ultimately, as we have pointed it out previously, the real world would 
be existentially derived from pure consciousness. 
The material analysis programmed by Ingarden as not only specifying 
the possible modes of the world's origination but also as capable ofintro-
ducing new factors into this cluster of formal dependencies, brings into 
focus of attention the 'essential state of the body' in its interlacing with 
the soul. And yet Ingarden did not succeed in grasping this missing link 
in the cluster of interrelationships either through the investigation of 
the 'body as experienced' in its structural relation to the soul or by 
shifting to physical action as the eventual linkage system among them all. 
Neither the differentiation of the monad into a specific soul/body 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
371 
territory nor the emphasis which Ingarden, in the third and last volume 
of the Controversy, places upon the causal network of the physical world 
dynamism - the emphasis that served Leibniz so well in setting up a 
reconstruction scheme of reality grasped at two levels, aggregate/ 
causality - order/individual substance - opens the scene to the material 
dimension of reality, essential to Ingarden's undertaking. Although 
the conception of the causal relation as interlacing the spread of 
events within the region of the world is meant primarily to account 
for the network of order by means of which the 'dynamisms' of the 
material world-content would be distributed, one wonders, first of all, 
what philosophical significance Ingarden would give to the key-term 
'dynamisms' of nature, taken directly as a conception of popularized 
science. This term remains alien to a philosophical reconstruction of 
order. Indeed, if the so-called 'dynamisms' are seen by him as the 
'material' content of the world, could we consider causality as the key to 
'material ontology'? It appears doubtful, since neither are the 'material' 
aspects of nature thematized nor does the causal nexus provide a system 
of reference to draw them into a direct investigation in their own specific 
rights. Moreover, the manifold of specific causal networks, on the one 
hand, and the equally discontinuous 'dynamisms' on the other hand, did 
not lead Ingarden to find within the 'region of the world' itself a material 
unity embracing the entirety of its components. The unity of the world 
remains strictly formal; first, of its ontological structure; second, of the 
spread of the causal network. Therefore no final result of the exfoliation 
of its dependency or independency; its originality or derivativeness from 
consciousness or any other factor could be reached. 
(b) The Implicit Grand Metaphysical Design 
In spite of the impasse in which the Idealism/Realism controversy seems 
to be stuck and of the fact that seen in itself his ontological approach 
does not revolutionize the Husserlian conclusions, the great metaphysical 
sequence offorms stands out from Ingarden's investigation as the major 
fruit of the ontologico-phenomenological investigation. 
Both of the lines of inquiry, the one elaborating the modalities of the 
controversy and the other projecting plans for a great metaphysical 
design, have the question of the existential status of the real at the center 
of their interest and flow together at the point of their common concern 

372 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
with the means to approach the empirical realm and retrieve it for the 
linkage of the sequence of domains of objects. The switch from the 
structure of objects to Action in its two forms, first the basic physical 
action and then the moral action, as a complex network of processes 
meant to exhibit the binding links among the various mechanisms of 
interlacing disparate domains and objects and bringing together -
allowing for their variety - the pluralism of being, failed to accomplish 
it. Although in the conception of 'moral action' all the segments of the 
great sequence seem to be in principle present, the body represented 
by a number of discontinuous sets of semi-closed 'dynamic systems' 
(nota bene, recalling Nicolai Hartmann's SatzgeJUge) does not reach 
the level of a phenomenologically reduced philosophical interpretation, 
nor does it meet the 'body as experienced'. 'The organic unity of the 
body' which is claimed with reference to the structure of the 'responsible 
action' is not substantiated and remains enigmatic. Action did not 
provide us with the key to the material realm 'in its essential state', one 
of the major segments of the universal sequence of forms. We failed to 
gain the plenitude of forms, the access to actual existence. 
These results are not surprising. Having differentiated the onto-
logical structures of types of objects on the basis of their separation 
from the empirical pulp of existence can he now using the same tools 
immerse it back into it undistorted? Could he, indeed, with his restricted 
phenomenological apparatus, reach beyond the eidetic structures of 
mechanisms and relations, of causal order, on the one hand, and of the 
ontic rationale of responsibility, on the other hand? Can we understand 
all the 'material' elements which entered into his investigation otherwise 
than exemplifications by common sense observation and popularized 
science of his eidetic analysis? Is it likely that Ingarden would take these 
excursions into science as philosophical reflection in its own right? 
Would this not lead to the conclusion that he abandoned the phenome-
nological postulates altogether? Were we to take his sketchy fragments 
of the action inquiry into man as a decisive scholarly work, would we 
not have to draw the unlikely conclusion that he decides for a primitive 
empirical realism as the solution of the Realism/Idealism controversy? 
Having in the last analysis brought all the differentiated static and 
dynamic factors of the world-man relation back to the ideal realm, 
Ingarden did not propose the key to the unity of the All, but revealed 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
373 
merely the grammar of objectivity. Regulated by the 'transcendent' ideal 
principles of values, only 'flexibility' of action - and not 'freedom' - can 
b~ accounted for by its 'syntax'. 
Ingarden's development, which can be interpreted as a shift from the 
initial project in which the ontological structure of the existential con-
glomerations - real world and consciousness - was expected to yield 
sufficient evidence of their possible relations to action shows that not 
only is he led by the demands of the state of affairs themselves to 
abandon his initial conception of metaphysics but also that he cannot get 
away without probing below the rational schematism of the correlation 
'structure-intentional process'. 
Approaching at the start only provisionally the controversy within 
the Cartesian framework in which the real world is opposed to pure 
consciousness and expecting to transform it from within the concrete 
research, did he not, in fact, become victim of this framework? 
The framework itself appears to have come into an impasse. In fact, 
could we not venture the supposition that this impasse might have its 
roots in some presumptions that classic philosophy bequeathed to the 
Cartesian formulation? 
To conclude, it can be said that Ingarden's failure to reconstruct con-
clusively the great issue within this framework - having shown its 
limitations and difficulties rather than having solved it - constitutes his 
everlasting contribution to the history of philosophy. We will probe 
deeper in our criticism by summarizing now what appears to us as the 
three basic fallacies underlying the whole of his and for that matter also 
of Husserl's undertaking. We may venture to say that it is these fallacies 
which are responsible for the fact that his quest turned out to be 
incapable of overcoming the flaws of its historical inheritance. By the 
same token, however, we acknowledge our debt to our Great Master, 
enumerating several constructive points differently oriented, of our own 
effort regarding the same issue. 
(c) The Basic Fallacies Concerning the Status of Reality Present in the 
IdealismJRealism Issue 
The three fallacies which we detect in Ingarden's perplexities seem to 
stem from the Cartesian criticism of sense-perception as the incentive to 

374 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
approach the status of the world and man in a way that later on took the 
form of the Realism/Idealism controversy. 
The first of these is the assumption about reality, which in phenome-
nology interpreted in the form of the noetico-noematic intentional system 
of structures and processes, is the essential and ultimate exponent of 
objectivity. The second is that reality is essentially represented by this 
intentionally constituted objective system instead of by its intrinsic 
dynamisms endowed with its own rules of operations of constructive 
progress. Thirdly, as the consequence of these two assumptions, the 
criterion of the 'bodily givenness' which is meant to guarantee the 
authentic access to the real is identified with and restricted to the 
objectifying intuition of things and beings. 
These three assumptions appear fallacious in two respects. Firstly, the 
Cartesian doubt in the adequacy of sense-perception data in presenting 
reality 'as it is' has in subsequent corroborations allowed conclusions of 
a metaphysical nature to be drawn from the epistemological assumption, 
and inversely. In the point at issue, the Cartesian and Husserlian quests 
after apodictic certainty of cognition is responsible for the metaphysical 
conception of reality; and inversely, identification of the real with its 
objective level implies criteria of its cognition, restricting in tum its 
reach. Secondly, concerning the metaphysical thesis about reality which 
emerged from the epistemological quest after certainty, the following 
objection should be raised. 
With the new insights gained in our times on the complex mechanism 
of man's vital functioning, Bergson's view that the world's presence to 
us in the form of an 'objective' scheme is a result of the most complex 
and long-winded processes going on 'below' the rational evidence of 
direct intuition seems to be confirmed. In such a complete operational 
system of man's vital functions, objectivity could hardly occupy a role 
other than that of the culminating stage of man's rational orchestration 
of them as the vehicle oflife as well as the basis for the higher organization 
of his existence. However, although it is within the reach of our direct 
recognition through the 'media' of our own functioning that objectivity, 
as it is ground through the mill of these media, 'appears', yet in view of 
this deeper perspective, does it not seem vain to search for the ultimate 
conditions of the origin of objectivity and the rules of its modalities in 
the scrutiny of these very media (or in the modes of their operations as 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
375 
correlated through the ideal structures obtained from the tacit epistemo-
logical assumption about the reality of aggregates for which a thematizing 
framework is lacking)? 
In fact, the three assumptions under discussion appear fundamentally 
fallacious on account of their illegitimate involvement with the meta-
physical conception of reality assumed as essentially 'objective'. 
We challenge this thesis by submitting that 'objectivity', or, for that 
matter, its counterpart 'subjectivity' are the last stage of the pluri-
dimensional and plurifunctional process of man's simultaneous auto-
genesis and existence. They appear in their formal-material manifestation 
at that stage alone. Whereas, the privileged status attributed to them by 
classic phenomenology is relative to its eidetic-transcendental framework 
of reference. This framework, however, cracking under the pressure of 
present-day intuitive research, is being superseded by a vaster one 
reaching deeper into the NATURE-OF-MAN-AND-HIS-CONDITION.

Chapter I 
THE CONTEXTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE RENEWED 
PHENOMENOLOGICAL PROGRAM 
1. The 'Overturn' towards the Contextual Approach 
We would venture to say that phenomenology in this gigantic monument 
of an analytic approach to man and his world in its eidetic and transcen-
dental program rests on two assumptions. One of these assumptions, as 
we have previously tried to show, is that the fundamental level of reality 
- of the reality of man's world and of man himself - consists in its 
'objectivity', seen as autonomous in virtue of its system of fixated 
'objective' structures. 'Objectivity' stands for the system of orientation 
enabling man to enact his existence, a system representing both the world 
as self-contained and self-sufficient and man himself. The second assump-
tion is that the relationship man - world - consciousness - external reality, 
also lies within the single network of rational relationships either among 
the elements of ideal structures - (according to the ontological inquiry) 
or among the elements of constitutive genesis (in the line of transcen-
dental analysis). Both of these rational networks, complementing each 
other, are supposed to evolve according to the principles of rational ties 
and to be carried on by their rational intrinsic mechanisms. 
Presuppositionlessness from the theoretical and common sense as-
sumptions claimed by phenomenology was meant as a guarantee to the 
"things to speak for themselves," without distorting biases. And yet, 
could a philosophical program of inquiry start out and advance without 
some assumptions? Both programs - that of the transcendental constitu-
tion, as well as that of ontological structuralism - both 'presupposition-
less' in the above sense - break down mainly on account of these 
assumptions. They break down through the intrusion into analytic 
investigation of the rationality of the factors of man's interworldly 
existence which are alien to and challenge these tight rational work 
schemes. Moreover, the thorough and profound investigation of man 
and his universe carried out by these great programs has also prepared 
for the independent emergence of unforeseen dimensions of experience 
whose specific rights call for consideration. These intruding elements 
into the phenomenological systems of investigation, for which no ready 
thematization is available, show them encircled by the system of the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
377 
rational functions of man. But they also indicate 'vital' dimensions of 
the interplay between the 'specifically human' functions and Nature -
ignored and unaccountable for by the classic phenomenological approach 
- as the groundwork from which the process of which 'objectivity' is the 
last stage, is being carried forward. 
This disintegration from within and falling apart of the two great 
schemes of the classic phenomenological program can be seen in the 
spontaneous emergence of the pre-rational, unthematized, subliminal 
dimensions of experience which demand entrance in their own right into 
the new approaches to the great philosophical issues. In fact, it is the 
vindication of real existence outside the constitutive framework of the 
transcendental schema of conscious genesis. 123 The conception of moral 
experience as having its source in the 'subliminal' ties between the 'One-
self' and the 'Other', 124 the introduction of Imaginatio Creatrix and of 
the creative function of man, 125 challenge the primacy of the intentional, 
on the one hand, and of the structural grasp, on the other. This interior 
dissolution and need for an enlarged reconstruction of the phenome-
nological field of inquiry is to be seen also in the recent disorientation 
and criticism. 
We are already witnessing the need to enlarge the framework of phe-
nomenological inquiry in the new attempts at interpretation of the two 
great masters. It now appears, as if from a distance of preparatory inter-
pretation of their efforts, that we are ready to see what they were actually 
accomplishing and actually struggling with in spite of what they thought 
they did. 
Under this pressure of original insights coming from within the phe-
nomenological research and of intuitions provoked by criticism, new 
aspects of seeing the procedure of the masters themselves come to light. 
We may now see, in fact, the upcoming overturn of the phenomenological 
inquiry into man and his universe, already to a considerable degree 
prepared by these two giants, HusserI and Ingarden, who have explored 
the classic phenomenological program to its final possibilities. 
In both of the approaches the task is the same: to grasp the universe 
of knowledge and ultimately the universe of our human life in its basic 
forms, prior to their particularization and diversification in individual 
experiences influenced through theoretical knowledge, the inheritance 
of which penetrates our consciousness. 

378 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Let us recall that Husserl seeks the human experience as it springs 
forth spontaneously, and attempts both to follow it up in its temporal 
genesis, going through all the stages of man's conscious unfolding, and 
to account for the human universe by elucidating its genesis in human 
consciousness; while Ingarden proposes the original and authentic 
foundation of the human universe in its possible rational structures. Each 
mirrors the universe of human discourse in its own way, one making it 
relative to human consciousness, the other referring it for its objective 
possibility, order and progress, to a system of a prioric ideal laws. 
I have repeatedly shown elsewhere the various limitations of Husserl's 
enterprise. 126 We may recall that two of its basic flaws (stated above) 
simultaneously open possible perspectives to engage our query further. 
First of all, Husserl's claim that he can account by means of the transcen-
dental constitutive system for the complete life-world is untenable. In 
his analysis Husserl has followed constantly the procedures of the univer-
sal, normal psychic life. Whereas extensive research, accomplished in the 
last decades in phenomenologically inspired psychiatry, shows that 
neither the constitutive genesis as described by Husserl, nor its inten-
tional system of reference (together with its horizon supposedly com-
plementing the reservoir of constitutively possible models) can account 
for some sectors of the psychotic phenomena, which, nevertheless, do 
appear in the field of reduced consciousness and are open to intuitive 
inspection in their immediate presence. 127 The absolutism of the con-
stitutive analysis, with respect to its completeness, while accounting for 
human discourse, is thus dispelled. 
Ingarden's absolutism of the rational a priori structures has, as we 
have seen, reached a similar obstacle. Both thinkers seek in vain to 
rejoin the vital dimensions of experience and nature from which they 
separated themselves while setting up their respective methodological 
frameworks. Their probing into those dimensions, even if unsuccessful, 
never stopped. Neither did they disavow their essential postulates. 12 7a 
Our conclusion is that within these two clearly delineated and con-
ceptually elaborated classic frameworks of research, a much vaster 
framework of inquiry, claiming no apodictic type of certitude nor 
absolute ideal foundation, was at work in virtue of the irreducible elements 
of the human condition. It advanced slowly through concrete data, pre-
paring its own role as the framework of provisory contextual phenomeno-

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
379 
logical inquiry. We will approach our formulation of its program under 
several headings. 
Before we single out, to submit to the reader, two concrete openings 
enlarging the phenomenological field of research, (one answering the 
demands put forth by real existence coming into its own within the actual 
context of the world; the other, man's creative effort, both of them 
vindicating these pre-objective realms of man, "beyond essences", as 
Mr. Levinas has put it), we shall engage in a brief discussion of the very 
possibility of such an inquiry. 128 We will then discuss the problems which 
these above mentioned developments raise and the new program of 
phenomenological framework of inquiry they postulate. This framework 
should completely embrace the previously considered field and stretch 
further between the two extremes of the seeming antithesis of the dynamic/ 
subliminal and the articulated/irreducible. 
2. Contextual Phenomenology 
In fact, should the narrow frame of our discussion allow us to enter into 
the historical intricacies of the issues with which we propose to deal in a 
succinct fashion, substantiating our contention with some striking 
examples, we could show that there is nothing basically new in what we 
have called the 'over-tum' of the phenomenological orientation which, 
after having elucidated the rational levels of objectivity, is ready to reach 
deep down to their dynamic springs. 
Neither should we see it foreign to the methods and techniques taken 
in their full extent, of the two classic stages of phenomenology, that its 
initial rallying cry "back to the things themselves" may now deliberately 
take on a less restrictive and more poignant formulation: "Retrieve the 
irreducible whatever its form." Nevertheless, such a proposal in order to 
be plausible has to offer adequate answers to some typical questions like, 
for instance: "How can we circumscribe 'phenomenological inquiry'?" 
"Wherein lies the decision regarding the legitimacy of an inquiry as a 
contribution to this field?" And finally: "How can we reconcile within 
the same field masses of analytic work and theories as diversified as 
those of Husserl, Scheler, Heidegger, Ingarden, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, 
Ricoeur and Levinas?" 

380 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
(a) Presuppositionlessness or 'contextual reference? 
The strength and unity of the phenomenological field of research, in 
spite of its diversification in different approaches and techniques, con-
sists now as before in its explicit, or at least implicit, allegiance to the 
clarification of its initial postulates concerning the objects and methods 
of research. Furthermore, if we probe deeper into the unifying links 
pervading apparently disparate philosophical efforts, we will find that 
these assumptions are supposed to be linked together through their 
genuine ties with the places which they occupy and the roles they play 
within a larger framework. This framework reveals itself slowly for 
explication as a vast future project in the phenomenological reconstruc-
tion of MAN-IN-HIS-CONDITION. 
In the first period of the gigantic phenomenological endeavor, alle-
giance to the eidetic insight meant, first of all, the sweeping away of all 
that which, in principle, lacks direct rational clarification and methodo-
logical justification. This was intended to be the answer to the claim for 
a radical clarification of the postulates. 
And yet this postulate of rationality interpreted as the key to the 
ultimate 'truth' about things and being is extended already by HusserI 
himself. In Analysen zur Passiven Synthesis HusserI is no more satisfied 
with the eidetic nucleus of the noema as the genetic criterion of adequacy 
but extends the problem of 'adequacy' to the verification of truth of the 
singular noemata with respect to their 'Bewahrheit' with the complete 
constitutive system of the life-world. 12Ba This verification of the singular 
with respect to the complete system is, however, - and here we might 
oppose the tendencies of the hermeneutic interpretation of HusserI -
going back to the originary autonomy of the singular nuclei of structure 
it refers to the complete pattern as to an underlying eidetic system of the 
a priori possible models. With the absolute status of the rational structure 
- as representing the ultimate explanation of things and beings -lifted and 
replaced by the insight into the functional orchestrations as generative of 
things and beings with reference to each other and to their complete 
context, the emphasis of the investigation falls upon the context as a 
whole, understood as responsible for the generic nature of the singular. 
Thereby a radical shift of emphasis is reached: in order to grasp the 
nature of the singular in the modalities of its origin, we must investigate 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
381 
it within the context in which it emerges as both its constituent as well 
as its product. 
(b) The explosion of this self-enclosed circle: presuppositionlessness not 
an absolute but a relative criterion of validity 
Yet it is precisely the monumental development of phenomenological 
inquiry into man and his world, pursued on so many methodological 
fronts that seems to have proved that the ideal of seemingly absolute 
presuppositionlessness formulated by Hussed and accepted by Ingarden 
as a correlation between a specific intellectual type of rationally distilled 
intuition and a specifically rational representation of the human world and 
man constituting it, is restrictive with respect to the great task which 
Hussed prescribed for phenomenology. Although at each stage of his 
development he expanded and enlarged its meaning, it still appears far 
too narrow to meet his own intuitive requirements. On their own account, 
those requirements of the subject matter could not fail to break through. 
As a matter of fact, the range of evidence that Hussed himself was 
capable of interpreting philosophically with reference to the framework 
he established progressively for his inquiry is restricted to the level of the 
correlation between "intentional genesis - rational structuration" with 
its temporal horizons at one extreme and the horizon of possible types 
of structures and relations at the other. 
Whereas, we propose that this human dimension, embodying the 
complete emotional-empirical system offunctions, is the very foundation 
and sustainer of the whole system of man as element of nature within 
the world-context. 
But in the course of his later reflections (Crisis and post-Crisis) Hussed 
obviously is struggling in vain to reach further than his framework allows. 
His attempt to investigate 'empirical consciousness' leads him far 
beyond the life-world and kinesthetic intentionality into reflection on the 
body (Leiblichkeit), 129 approached from the angle of systems of natural 
instinct, in which he sees the 'primordial' factor (das Primordiale) 
radically preceding the constitution of the ego (das radikal Vor-Ichliche). 
His attempt to philosophically interpret these new factors, drawing 
them into his previously established framework fails. 130 However, the 
examination of Husserl's development in relation to the expansion of the 
philosophical scope in his ever progressive quest, undertaken by J. N. 

382 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Mohanty 131 seems to indicate, in fact, that a sharp division among 
several phases of development previously distinguished by his inter-
pretors (e.g. Landgrebe, Funk, Farber, etc.), should be abandoned. The 
continuity of HusserI's evolving reflection seems to be already laid down 
with the germination of his project in his first wf"itings. And yet, as Paul 
Ricoeur stated recently, the subject matter upon which Husserl draws 
in pursuing his alleged purpose (Logical Investigations) includes more 
than the material thematized by him.132 
We have already drawn a similar conclusion concerning Ingarden's 
evolution from the critical investigation of his thought. 
In the first place, as we have tried to show as Ingarden progresses, his 
philosophical development parallels that of his master. In his attempted 
investigation of man through the relation to his functional system of 
action, Ingarden is led to plunge into empirical science, for which his 
framework of inquiry obviously cannot offer principles necessary for the 
philosophical interpretation of its data. Either they remain as mere 
illustrations of his eidetic system of relations and mechanisms, or they 
stand on their own apart from this system. 
Secondly, we have sought to show to what extent, in fact, the pre-
scribed schema of the Ingardenian phenomenological program is respon-
sible for his discontinuous domains of ideal or intentional objects and 
for his failure to bring them into the "unity of being", as well as to 
assess their relation to actual things and beings. 
We have seen that a larger set of assumptions than those admissible 
by the interpretation of the postulate of presuppositionlessness in terms 
of eidetic reduction would be indispensable for the accomplishment of 
the intrinsic demands of the inquiry. 
It seems that Ingarden, in paralleling HusserI, follows the programmed 
line of evidence; yet by intruding into other than eidetically accessible 
types of intuitive insights he breaks through the framework of phenom-
enology, and for that matter, of philosophy devised by him. 
The presuppositionlessness of eidetic phenomenology also appears to 
be too onesided to account for the unfolding of its great implicit scope, 
and has served merely its limited aim in the investigation of objectivity. 
Challenged by the results of its own research it may now leave room 
for other no less demanding criteria. In fact, while the general phenome-
nological debate, especially since World War II, has at its center questions 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
383 
of method, clarification, reduction and apodictic evidence, the progress 
of phenomenological research, in spite of the claims for the ultimate 
philosophical value of the results raised by the respective thinkers, has 
been bringing before the eye of the critical philosopher the limits of 
their results. Crevices appearing in the midst of results obtained came 
to reveal other aspects of man's situation within the world, situations of 
conflicts tearing asunder all the beautiful universal schemes within which 
the classic phenomenological framework of reference tried to tie the 
givenness. The irreducible subliminal factors and elemental forces which 
came to light caused the harmoniously outlined framework of rational 
givenness built by Husserl-Ingarden to recede from its assumed role, 
the 'absolutely given' reality, to the mere level of a rational schema 
unfolding within the set of man's virtualities. 
Thus, the 'objective-subjective' rationale has shown itself as describing 
only one of man's functioning systems, articulating his situation within 
life and the world on one side, and on the other side, representing the 
schematism of man's 'typical' individual existence. As we have pointed 
out above, this classic phenomenological framework is rooted in episte-
mological assumptions determining the formulation of the method. 
In fact, the opening of new approaches to man which have appeared 
within the phenomenological field recently, as well as the most recent 
trends of ideas, are a radical reaction to these epistemological assump-
tions. 
Although these signs of reaction might also be inspired by various 
extra-phenomenological trends of thought, they all come together in 
expressing a defiance of the absolute sovereignty of reason over the other 
functions of man. In the light of our analysis, this amounts to a rejection 
of the assumed presuppositionlessness either of the eidetic insight or of 
its corollary, the transcendental approach to man and his situation in the 
world. 
Phenomenological presuppositionlessness, involved as it is with its 
apparatus of apodictic evidence, eidetic insight, 'pure' act of conscious-
ness, the irreducible stream of time, ideal prototypes of objective struc-
tures, the grouping of ideal relations as the ultimate articulations of 
human reality - all these cornerstones of the classic framework of refer-
ence of the Husserlian-Ingardenian formulation of the phenomenological 
program - seems outlived. This apparatus appears as a methodological 

384 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
framework open to re-examination in the face of the findings of reality; 
scrutinized in their own field, these findings no longer fit into this frame-
work, which falls short of providing a basis for the appropriate inter-
pretation of their role within man's situation. 
3. The Dilemma and the Irreducible 
Bringing our reflection to some alternative points, we submit, first and 
foremost, that there is much more to the eidetic-transcendental program 
than its postulated methodological framework of reference indicates and 
embraces. We propose that the scope of the authentic phenomenological 
aspiration is not to be restricted by a framework of method to the 
intentional-eidetic correlation but that with respect to the full extent of 
the investigation of man-and-his-condition, this framework may still 
remain instrumental as a centralizing rational dimension wherein all the 
other dimensions of man's functioning converge. In fact if we wish, 
following the aspiration of phenomenology, to grasp man at this very 
foundation, this rational life-organizing function of intentionality, as 
Bergson saw it, recedes from its alleged priority, first of all, with respect 
to other orchestrations of human functioning. As has become apparent 
from the phenomenologically reoriented study of creative experience, 
which the present writer reached after having broken through the 
HusserIian-Ingardenian straitjacket, man's creative orchestration of 
function has the upper hand in the human condition, decisive for his and 
his world's origin, since it is capable of renovating the world, rather than 
simply perpetuating it. 133 
Secondly, going deeper, it recedes in priority because of the crevices 
in its constitutive schemata, according to recent psychological findings, 
referring to the functional orchestration of elemental Nature with its 
pre-synthetizable flux of life, with Subliminal articulations of their own, 
with the spontaneity from which man's genetic progress springs. They 
seem to constitute, in their non-automatized and conflicting upsurges, 
the gist of man's existence. To understand man, not one-sidedly at the 
level of his rational life organization only, but in his very condition, to 
reach his genesis as man, as he unfolds his telos and pursues his destiny, 
we have to find a way to these dynamic dimensions of man; HusserI's 
and Ingarden's attempts failed to do it. Their upsurging claim to be 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
385 
accounted for seems to require first a break with, and second a reinstate-
ment of, new criteria of both clarification and presuppositionlessness. 
A dilemma seems to arise: "Could the Elemental dimension of man, 
breaking through the abstract levels of reason so vehemently, still enter 
into the phenomenological field as the continuation of its vast program, 
since to effect this entrance the whole Husserlian-Ingardenian methodo-
logical framework of philosophical reconstruction would have to be 
broken apart?" 
"Or should we then grant to the Subliminal its pretention to a complete 
autonomy from reason, and hastily conclude that the only way to do 
justice to its ingeniousness is to leave it out of the scheme of philosophical 
reconstruction in its own 'pre-rational' status?" 
The second position is very much in vogue at the present moment of 
radical contestation of the abuse of reason; yet would it be legitimate for 
philosophy to adopt it? 
On the contrary, philosophical inquiry, whether it is understood 
exclusively as the quest after truth about man and his world or as probing 
into the ultimate conditions of man's life and destiny, expected eventually 
to reveal the key that may serve an otherwise blind man - to orient him in 
his conduct - cannot ignore, in fact, whatever may be the ultimate re-
sources, anonymous forces, or even unforeseeable directives which 
manifest themselves at all stages of man's unfolding as a unity, that is, 
as pluridimensional and plurifunctional, articulated at all levels. These 
articulations, different according to the orchestrations into which they 
enter, are not mere abstract schema of combination and permutation 
devising a repetitious vital mechanism, but, first and foremost, due to 
their ingeniously dynamic, generative spontaneity, they constitute the 
very vehicle of human progress. They are springs of man's origin, growth, 
existence and destiny. In virtue of this dynamic concatenation of func-
tions and their distributive nature the 'Subliminal' entering into the game 
of individual existence takes on a vital significance in the existential 
complementariness among the modalities of the rational articulations 
within the same functional orchestration. 
Indeed, if in an anticipatory way, we follow the seemingly discon-
tinuous, sinuous and ever changeable course - intermingling with every-
thing else - of 'pre-given' 'pre-constitutive' or 'Subliminal' elements of 
affection or passion when it manifests itself within the articulated life-

386 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
context, we find it already 'distilled' and 'formed' at each step; but 
nevertheless, we see its transformation in 'reaction' to already inten-
tionally established life-coherence. Through this or another intentional 
pattern it enters its delineated course, which to start with, we may 
merely guess at. Following these 'reactions' throughout, these directly 
ungroupable elements make themselves seen in the midst of one or other 
concatenation of rapport with 'the rest', performing this and not another 
role in this and no other functional context within which it becomes 
oriented. 
If we then wish to exfoliate the subliminal we may pursue its 
modalities through the way it is integrated by the specific 'reaction' 
within a respective functional orchestration and its telos; these two are 
necessarily corollary. Making an analogy with Kant's aesthetics, although 
we transfer it to a level prior to that at which he establishes his balance 
in the complementariness between the "receptivity of impression" 
(Receptivitiit der Eindriicke) and "spontaneity of concepts" (Spontaneitiit 
der Begriffe) we may say, in fact, that one amplifies, intensifies and 
qualifies the other. One constitutes the decisive step of advance and 
expansion of the other, the first being blind and meaningless without 
the second, and the second empty and dead without the first. 
Were we then, in order to vindicate the 'Subliminal' and make 
it come into its own, to give up the rationale altogether, we would have 
to renounce retrieving it and would then later bypass its specific func-
tion. Wittgenstein might have been right saying: "Woriiber sich nicht 
sprechen liisst, dariiber soli man schweigen". Nevertheless, is it not 
the task of philosophy to find an access to the real even indirectly, 
and have we not already seen "through the glass darkly"? Furthermore, 
through the flaws of the classic framework, have we not seen lurking some 
material to lead us like a filum Ariadnae toward the establishment of a 
new framework of investigation? 
The postulate of rationality interpreted as the assumption that the key 
to the ultimate truth about things and beings may lie in an absolutely 
distinctive rational nucleus of "things in themselves" as separated each 
in its own nature genetically groupable or directly through the noematic 
content also is extended already by Husser! himself. Indeed Husser! in 
Erfahrung und Urteil is no longer satisfied with the eidetic nucleus of the 
noema as the criterion of genetic truth but extends the verification of the 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
387 
'truth' of singular noemata to their 'Bewahrheit' within the complete 
constitutive system of the world. 
The absolute status of rational structures as representing the ultimate 
explanation of things and beings linked together with the noemato 
into functional orchestrations as generative of things and beings with 
reference to each other and consequently to the whole pattern, requires 
that the emphasis of the investigator falls not only upon the whole system, 
but specifically upon the system understood as responsible for the 
genetic nature of the singular that is a specific context. 
This verification of the singular to the complete system is however 
centered in the original autonomy of the singular nucleus of structure; 
it refers to the whole pattern or to the system of relations among 
noemata occurring according to their original specific nature. 
Therefore a radical shift of emphasis is needed: in order to grasp 
the nature of the singular in the modalities of its origin we must refer 
to the context in which it appears as both its constitutive and by its 
constituted element. 
Replacing the abstract ideal essences with the notion of the 'irre-
ducible', the combinatorial system of ideal relations with various types 
of articulations, the rational system of intentionality with the insight 
into various orchestrations of man's functions, and more importantly, 
approaching man as the real autonomous individual not in separation 
from but within the concrete concatenations of the actual context of the 
real world, we have the contextual framework of reference appropriate 
to do justice to this new dimension, without in any way giving up the 
acquisitions of the classic ones. 
Let us now see how the fundamental principles of the classic 
phenomenological framework of method may be considered simulta-
neously as maintaining the final inspiration with respect to the basic 
tendency of phenomenology, and being transformed in their inter-
pretation with respect to the full-fledged scope of reality it aims now to 
encompass in the proposed contextual framework of reference. 134

Chapter II 
CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS: SOME OF ITS METHODOLOGICAL 
PRINCIPLES 
1. The Rational Postulate: The Irreducible: Its Profiles with Reference 
to Various Dimensions of Experience. 
To start with a decisive question: "How can the rational postulate 
of an ideal cornerstone of reality be abandoned without falling into the 
pitfall of naturalism?" It admits obviously in its primordial allegiance 
to "things themselves" of several ways in which they may be interpreted, 
were we to admit that all of them converge in retrieving the irreducible 
elements of the real from the relativistic biases of arbitrary cognitive 
approaches. 
The privileged position of eidoi, essences, ideal structures as the 
ultimate in verification of the 'adequacy' (if not 'truth') of the genetic 
progress of the intentional constitution or of the structuration of possible 
objects having exhausted itself in phenomenological inquiry and having 
failed on its own to reach actual reality, the question at hand is whether 
we are not in danger of falling into the trap of reductionism - over 
against which phenomenology arose. The reductionistic tendencies now 
expressed in more elaborated forms than at the beginning, are prevalent 
in current philosophical thinking. Stemming from social anthropology, 
evolutionary biology and historical hermeneutics, they propose to draw 
ceaselessly man in his condition into their explanatory theories, ultimately 
reducing man to Nature. Having given up, first the absoluteness of ideal 
structures, then the apodicticity of intuitional noetic-noematic models of 
givenness of the real, and finally having reached below the objective 
rules of the givenness itself into the folds of Elemental Nature - where 
the natural science of man claims to have established its privileged 
telescopic and operational exp~anatory models - are we not then bound 
to see man as reducible at his roots to one or the other, or maybe in part 
to each of these onesided approaches? Are we not bound to relegate 
man's specific 'humanity' and its condition within the context of the 
universe - as well as his 'authentic' experience of nature and himself - to 
the socio-cultural evolutionary trend of history or a blind? Are we then 
to see him either as an anonymous product of this domineering dynamics, 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
389 
a mesh in a gigantic texture void of pattern, or a wheel in a blindly 
operating gigantic machine, which could hardly be called 'humanity'? 
We would, on the contrary, submit that the crisis of the strict and over-
refined rationale may have shown, on the one hand, its role, as restruc-
tured artifact. 
On the other hand, however, the claim of the Subliminal and the 
Elemental realms of man emerging through each crevice of this rational 
inquiry and claiming to come to its own right, has affirmed itself in a not 
altogether haphazard and irrational fashion. The very claim of passions 
and affectivity, to be considered as playing a crucial role in life's great 
conflicts tearing man apart between his resigned submission to the system 
of life survival and his nostalgia to rise above it, has affirmed itself in 
the orchestration of the creative function as well as in basic ethical 
modalities underlying human acts as manifestations 13 5 of the irreducible 
elements. This new conception of the irreducible as cornerstone of order 
and distinctiveness resists an exfoliation according to the methods of a 
rational quest for an intrinsic structure or pattern, and yet, manifests 
itself not as altogether disarticulated. It projects, on the contrary, its 
own contexts of inquiry where its functional articulations may be 
thematized and philosophically interpreted. To deny the presence of the 
irreducible elements in man-and-his-condition before investigation would, 
first of all, mean a negative pre-decision about the 'specifically human' 
existence of man by assuming man's total inclusion into the anonymous 
progress of nature. Second, it might also be a reductionistic pre-decision 
about the complete system of Nature's order and its ultimate telos. 
Now more than ever is it the calling of philosophy to let the real speak 
for itself! 
2. The Principle of All Principles' and the Pluridimensionality of 
Experience 
"How can the real speak for itself?" 
Away from the cognitive unity of the ideal structures as cornerstones 
of cohesion, the alternative conception of the 'irreducible" elements of 
reality indicates in opposition neither a conjoined privileged type of 
cognition nor a single objective criterion to determine it. 
Already in the development of the phenomenological movement 
it came clearly to light, in fact, that the principles intended by Husserl 

390 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
to safeguard the methodological rigor of the phenomenological analytic 
procedure (e.g. the three or four 'reductions' which HusserI tried to 
elaborate with progressive precision) were not rigorously maintained by 
philosophers like Sartre and MerIeau-Ponty. They have been interpreted 
by different thinkers, and although consequently the respective con-
ceptual schema of analysis may have undergone considerable change 
from the one proposed by HusserI and by Ingarden, allegiance to the 
basic postulates of phenomenology was maintained. 
The subject matter itself to which these methodological principles 
apply admits obviously, in its primordial allegiance to 'things themselves' 
of several ways of interpreting them. Were we to admit that all of them 
converge in retrieving the irreducible elements of the real from the 
relativistic biases of arbitrary cognitive approaches, we may consider 
all other methodological devises of phenomenology and its postulates 
of methodological legitimacy as means to reach this 'authentic' state of 
things. 135 
First of all, however, we have to recall the 'Principle of all Principles', 
from which phenomenological methodological aspirations flow, ac-
knowledging definite cognitive validity to all 'objects' that present them-
selves in their 'bodily selfhood'. The intent at the retrieval of things in 
their authentic state is coupled with their presence in 'bodily selfhood' 
in cognition. 
The distinction of regions of beings in HusserI, to which corresponds 
in Ingarden's ontology the distinction among types of beings, goes back 
to this double principle. According to this twofold methodological 
assumption, objects of each region present themselves as different 
in their 'bodily selfhood', and in their own type of experiential evidence, 
whereupon, their distinctive features have to be acknowledged (e.g. the 
region of mathematical objects is determined as being constituted in a 
specific genetic process o.f ideal cognition as distinct from the region 
of the real worId, as being constituted in processes of outer-perception; 
of the region of the works of art, which Ingarden brings to light against 
HusserI as a region of pure intentionality, etc.) 
We may conjecture that the 'Principle of all Principles' presiding over 
the concrete line of progress even of the two great masters, may explain 
HusserI and Ingarden, while trying to bring the results of their research 
back to their methodological system, yet borne along by the thirst to 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
391 
uncover the state of things and complying with its demand, were ever-
more carried away into circles for which the pre-established conceptual 
frame proves too narrow. As we have previously emphasized, even these 
two masters of phenomenological orthodoxy maintained their quest in 
spite oj, rather than according to, their pre-established precepts. 
Indeed, it seems in the first place, that the 'Principle of all Principles' 
has found within reality the response of the pluri-dimensionality of 
experience, which outlines a universal framework of research. Un-
restricted to one type of cognition, or experience, as singled out for its 
assumed unique compliance with absolute criteria of validity and thereby 
giving an absolute priority to one dimension, it allows for the ac-
knowledgement of each of them in its own right. Instead of reducing their 
various systems to one, it proposes an open system, a universal context 
in which each specific context of their functional articulation finds its 
proper place with respect to all the others. 
3. Levels of Analytic Visibility; Presence in the 'Bodily Selfhood' Revisited 
Within the various attempts at clarification and attaining a precise 
grasp of the way in which we may, and do, obtain 'clear', 'distinct', and 
apodictically evident 'ideas' the correlation between a more or less 
clearly articulated notion of an eidos and a conscious act remains always 
in focus. Husserl seeks to explain the coincidence of both by distinguishing 
elements and nuances at the noetic-neomatic level of conscious genesis 
with the hyle-morphe distinction. Ingarden attempts to establish their 
correlation by pushing to its extremity the analysis of the structure of the 
eidos and its constitutive intentional act, and yet the efforts of both 
meet at the same level of analytic visibility. 
Indeed, the intentional 'purity' of conscious acts, as reduced from 
all empirical and socio-historical aspects, in their genetic unfolding as well 
as the unchangeable, ideal structures retrieved artificially as the basic 
pattern of objectivity - the model and the reproduction - owe their ana-
lytic distinctiveness to the same eidetic intuition. We witness throughout 
the field of phenomenological research a variety of analytic levels, at which 
alone other aspects and types of elements of the given could in their 
'bodily selfhood' come to light. They bring to our attention modalities 
of experience in other articulations than those of the eidetic intuition. 
Already the aesthetic experience in Ingarden's analysis appears in a net 

392 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
of articulations far more diversified than a work of art - Affective 
modalities, progressive development, spiritual acts, experience of the 
communication with the other selves, may present themselves in their 
specific nature - each in its own type of ordering network - only at an 
appropriate level of analytic visibility. The distinctiveness of the many 
levels of analytic visibility with their own mode of bodily selfhood 137 is 
correlated with a specific type of experience. Focusing upon the 
irreducible element within their objects, each projects its own analytic 
framework; each level of analytic visibility - insofar as it makes its 
objects accessible to cognition - is projected on the basic of a referential 
network. As such, a network serves as the framework for issues con-
cerning the complete spread out of concern with man in his condition; 
and it emerges with immediate reference to the specific aspect of his 
condition to which the particular function of experience pertains. 
The criterion of the presence in bodily selfhood reinterpreted as founded 
in the irreducible at large rather than restricted to its specific modality 
of the eidoi refers ultimately to the complete framework of inquiry into 
man in his condition, laying down simultaneously one of its basic metho-
dological guidelines. Its principal methodological counterpart remains 
the classic postulate of irreducible givenness. Without it we would have 
to renounce the "return to the things themselves," because we would 
have to give up the self-explication of the givenness in its own right. 
Without revealing the irreducible as the guarantee of its firm and 
unshakeable foothold in the ultimate ground of givenness, phenomeno-
logy would become helpless against speculation of all types based upon 
false evidence of mere rational constructs in which the human mind 
delights, in disparagement of speculation or multiplying and introducing 
ad infinitum, arbitrary and unfounded abstract distinctions in the frequent 
abusive practice of the analysis of 'ordinary language'. 
Chapter III 
CREATIVITY: COSMOS AND EROS 
Some perspectives of the contextual investigation of 
MAN-AND-THE-HUMAN-CONDITION 
In our proposal of two avenues of phenomenological research within 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
393 
the contextual framework of analysis - of which we will outline the one 
and just introduce the reader to the second - we will take a twofold 
perspective with respect to our basic purpose: we will make some specific 
critical remarks on pivotal points regarding our previous treatments of 
the classic transcendental and eidetic frameworks of reference; we are 
introducing them as new constructive ideas toward finding a way out of 
the above denounced dilemmas in which both of the previous phases of 
phenomenology remained caught. These two avenues of contextual 
analysis, previously established elsewhere, might merit a renewed interest 
insofar as we may, following our thread of argument, interpret them as 
contributing, albeit from different perspectives, toward a reformulation 
of the Idealism/Realism issue; this is meant to avoid the denounced 
pitfalls of the Cartesian inheritance. First, going beyond the narrowness 
of the constitutive and ontological approach to the status of the real 
world and man, we might find them as perspectives simultaneously 
reaching deeper and into a vaster network of existential interdependencies 
of man and his integral condition. Second, we might accomplish a break 
and a passage between the closed intentional horizon of the given world, 
as the only possible one, to the open phenomenological realism of the 
'possible worlds '. 138 
1. From Constitutive and Structural Analysis to Conjectural Inference 
Ingarden's monumental analytical world offers us the universe and con-
sciousness ultimately to be brought back to their objective rational and 
ontologico-intentional structures, in their fundamental rational skeleton. 
Simultaneously, the elaboration of ontological principles and relations 
brings to light the substructure of human rationality. 
Furthermore, it appears that such a universe of eidetic possibilities is 
the counterpart of Husserl's constitutive genesis of consciousness. 
Indeed, it seems to present its objective 'possibilities' and limitations. 
As we well know, the constitutive analyses of Husserl are always meant 
to proceed in terms of the eidetic research, which also have the genesis 
of man's psychic life as their main objective, dispell from another point 
of view some of the explicit and implicit claims of constitutive phe-
nomenology. For example, the relativity of the factual organic nature 
of existing reality to the constitutive procedures of transcendental con-
sciousness appears problematic. In fact to the question which arises: 

394 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
"Can nature be reduced to its meaningfulness for man's existence?" (and 
by existence is meant an intentional phenomenon) we have to answer 
emphatically: No! Taking again into account recent psychiatric research 
we find that (a) consciousness is extended through various levels of 
psycho-somatic activity terminating in the dimension of physis, which 
is no longer conscious, that is, no longer pervaded by intentionallinkings 
with the present field of consciousness; it remains inaccessible even to 
our farthest extended intentional inspection and cannot be 'transmuted' 
into direct 'lived experience'. Thus consciousness reveals its alterity 
from but also its dependence upon the heterogenous dimension of nature. 
(b) Furthermore, we discover that the borderlines of the psyche in its 
autonomous activity are limited to the levels wherein the human being, 
presented with fundamental intentionality, is constituted together with 
his life-world, whereas in its vital operations, the same consciousness 
extends below the level of its functioning. Likewise its constitutive 
pattern as well as its ultimate commitments and regulations, seem to be 
sought below the threshold of its activity in the inner workings of 
nature. 139 Thus as we have emphasized above, the shortcomings of 
constitutive phenomenology indicate a much vaster field of research to 
be considered. The philosophical demand for ultimate reasons does not 
terminate in the quest for the first authentic form of experience. On the 
contrary, it only opens further avenues. 
Coming back to the pivotal flaw of the Husserlian approach we can 
say that it is the one that Ingarden has aimed at with his criticism of 
Husserl's closed circle of transcendental reduction as the vehicle of 
transcendental inquiry, namely the separation between the 'pure', or 
'reduced' and the empirical consciousness. What is at stake is the unreduced 
reality, which itself is the necessary starting point for the reduction that 
is supposed to lead to the domain of pure consciousness. It is precisely 
from this point of criticism that Ingarden, in order to avoid the necessity 
in which Husserl got caught, of endlessly seeking further justification of 
cognition, has started his own inquiry. 
But with the issue of the reduced empirical consciousness, as I have 
already mentioned concerning Husserl, the crucial problem is brought 
to light. In fact, it is in order to account for this empirical, temporal, 
singular and fleeting reality that we are in need of a foundational 
philosophy. It is for the purpose of accounting in evident and certain 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
395 
principles for this fleeting, changeable, ever escaping flux of nature and 
of the real world that basically a mathesis universalis is required. We 
cannot forget that empirical sciences in need of a foundation were the 
inspiration of the phenomenological quest. 
In other words, what should be the central philosophical concern is 
the fleeting nature of reality, its enigma of being simultaneously in a 
spontaneous and apparently incalculable process of change while still 
manifesting an intrinsic order, the striking evidence of the concrete 
existence of things, of beings and of their seemingly ungraspable nature. 
Is it not because of the singular uniqueness, temporal and fleeting, of 
the real existence of things and beings that our philosophical marvelling 
assumes a poignant form? 
Having now before us, the two fully elaborated ways which phenome-
nology has taken, the constitutive and the structural, the transcendental 
and the eidetic, (regardless of the flaws of their frameworks of inquiry 
in further reaching realms of evidence, and the problems in grasping 
their methodological apparatus and assumptions) we ask yet another 
question: "What about the problem of real existence?" Should we not 
reverse the order of orientation and instead of seeking a key to it through 
the rational order, start by acknowledging the modalities of existence of 
the actual individual as establishing the order? 
There is no doubt that in Ingarden's position of what was for him the 
central issue of the Realism-Idealism controversy the real existence of the 
world as it is experienced in its fluctuating, unique, concrete becoming 
is at stake. Does he, however, come to grips at all with the fleeting reality, 
which is in our experience as well as in the inner workings of nature an 
indivisible flux of events? 
Is the mechanism of eidetic structures to which the empirical mecha-
nism of the world is to be ultimately brought back, capable of grasping 
the elements of this flux, which appear in sketchy outlines and which we 
distinguish as 'objects' in their innermost dynamic essence, being and 
temporal evolution within the universal world-process? The dynamic 
process of reality is not composed like a puzzle of segments of mechanism 
among individual structures which it then inflates by its spontaneity. 
On the contrary, the elements of reality acquire their distinctive nature 
and are formed within this universal stream of forces. Their spontaneous 
confluence forms them, t~e projected net of relations making them persist 

396 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
a while, captivating them and individualizing them for a moment, and 
then the freeing of these forces leads to their dissolution. The being of 
objects of nature formed in the midst of infinite nets of relations as a 
distinctive unit is carried by them in its limited persistence. When we 
marvel about the actual real existence it is not the change, mobility, 
coming to be and passing away of an essentially static being that is the 
cause of surprise, but rather it is the persistence of the real thing through 
the waves of change that appears puzzling. 
However, this persistence through a segment of time which makes the 
span of existence of the real being, is rooted in an infinite number of 
singular, unique, incalculable moments of the universal flux. These 
moments are precisely those from which the eidetic reduction has to 
abstract in order to reach the unchangeable, ideal essences or models; 
neither does the model of the causal nexus with its necessary link 
spreading as it may in all directions and even transmitting on its own the 
forces of nature, account in any way for the incalculable play of forces 
in which the individual or distinctive being emerges. 
On the contrary, is not the existence of reality, this persistence through 
changeable, passing, concrete, singular moments within the infinitely 
expanding network of the world-process? 
The abstract reduction of the eidetic moments to which the mechanisms 
of action are to be brought back as well as the transcendental approach, 
aim at the universal types and eidoi and suspend, be it temporarily, 
these concrete relations, thereby cutting the original ties of being, without 
being able to retrieve them. 
It can be argued that this suspension is only provisory, and that the 
artificially distinguished and elaborated concepts both by intuition and 
rational analysis are replaced in their original network of relations in 
the transcendental analysis of the life-work. But is this retrieved relation-
system representing the natural 'contexture' of the real world, or is it 
projected by the transcendental consciousness? As we have attempted 
to show, when this relational system breaks under the pressure of 
expanding intuition, this intuition remains blind and calls for a new 
framework to be interpreted in its own right. 
Finally, can the relational mechanism of a universally distributed 
causal relation touch even the problem of this existential/ontological 
individuation of the actual real being within the world process and its 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
397 
specific unfolding? On the other hand, do we find in Ingarden/Husserlian 
conception of the essence, eidos or structure of the real ('transcendent') 
individual anything that would correspond to this specific individualizing 
process and its unfolding from within? Without it as the intrinsic self-
governing agent responsible for constructive progress, causal mechanisms 
of action and physical action itself are merely a mode of universal 
mobility. 
Both phenomenological approaches, the eidetic and the transcendental, 
are guilty in this respect of the same manhandling of reality. On the one 
hand, Ingarden performs his analysis at the level of structures, themselves 
fruits of the cognitive constitution, already at least partly prepared by 
conscious procedures and by the artful workings of consciousness, i.e., 
sharply delimited structures; in so doing he stays at the same distance 
from the factually existing reality as Husserl does in his radical distinction 
between the transcendental and the mondane (empirical) consciousness. 
The common effort of both the later Husserl and of Ingarden from 
the beginning of his career (as well as that of their followers) was to 
overcome the Cartesian split between consciousness and the world. In 
spite of the fact that Ingarden believed he had found in his ontological 
grounding of the totality of philosophical reconstruction of the universe 
of discourse a way out of the epistemological circularity, yet, as it is 
usual in attempts to overcome a set of difficulties by taking an opposite 
point of view, both of these phenomenological 'radical beginnings' 
reveal, as we have attempted to show, in the completion of their pro-
gramme, essential flows to be interpreted as the residue of the same 
Cartesian inheritance they had intended to overcome; this related to the 
common aim of both, namely, the establishment in an indubitable way 
of the extential status of the real world, and man's role in it. 
lt seems to have appeared that an expansion and reconstruction of 
the investigation framework is required, in order to do justice to the 
wealth of evidence being discovered even in the narrow limits of the 
classic conception. This new framework goes together with an inversion 
at the heart of the phenomenological assumptions themselves: it appears 
that only by shifting the emphasis from the universal to the concrete, 
from structures to the pulp of existence, from the rationalization about 
the possible to the plunge into the actual, that we can avoid the classic 
prejudices and attempt to retrieve at least some of the lost roots of man-
in-his-condition-within the world. 

398 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
However, the twofold limit which the phenomenological inquiry has 
reached in its twofold approach, not only reveals their basic limitations, 
but opens the door to several basic points for a new attempt. Away 
from the one extreme of the fundamental rationality which we have to 
take up again, our quest after the status of reality will be made by 
moving toward the investigation of contingent existence. It is the nature 
of contingency, which the eidetic structures were called to fixate, that is 
now to become the focus of attention. The limits of the transcendental 
world being fixed at the explication of the human life-world, it is the 
real world oj nature, in all its concreteness, in its inner workings, which 
accounts for the emergence of consciousness as such, its final rules and 
regulations extending unto the Cosmos, which, in tum, appears as one 
of the tasks of the third phase of the phenomenological endeavor. 140 
The accomplishments and limitations of both the structural and the 
genetic methods need to be complemented by the conjectural procedure. 
2. The World-Context-oJ-Actual-Existence 
To paraphrase Whitehead's expression, we might have been lifted to our 
view of things upon the shoulders of giants, and yet such is the radicalism 
of philosophical reflection that in order to make a decisive progress we 
have to start all over again. 
As a radically new start we propose the cosmological inquiry of the. 
actually existing real individual within the context oj actual existence, or 
within the world context. 
The paradoxical situation is that the real, existing individual appears 
not as the outcome of, but as the key element within, the system of human 
experience. As Bergson has pointed out, we orient ourselves in the world 
by distinguishing real individual beings, first, and then by taking them 
as points of reference to distinguish an order; but, when we direct our 
attention to the nature of the real individual and want to grasp it, not as 
'a bloodless monster' of eidetic perception, but as a concrete being in its 
specific dynamism of constructive unfolding, we cannot do so unless we 
put him back into the vital network of ties with the whole. Not only is it 
the dynamic unfolding of the real world that carries the individual along 
in his career, but it is also through vital ties with the rest of concrete 
reality that its pulsating being acquires a distinctive shape; the individ-
ualization, the distinctiveness of each real being is, in fact, to a con-

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
399 
siderable degree, the result of his position within the vital network of the 
real world. Can we think of taking a real individual out of the worldly 
framework? In all its universal features it exhibits the scheme of the 
world; in all its specific, concrete endowment it is determined in action-
reaction by the rest of the world's vital current. Thus its actual existence 
cannot be distilled to an abstract artifact differentiating it radically from 
the rest; on the contrary, we may approach it adequately only through 
the context of the world. 141 
The most significant feature of the real individual is his insertion into 
the totality of beings. It is as the segment of this totality that he actually 
exists. His actual existence is the resultant of this insertion. Thus mar-
velling with Wittgenstein how extraordinary it is that something should 
actually exist, we posit into the focus of our attention the real individual 
within the world context. 
So much for the preliminary experiential approach, but the intrinsic 
examination of the specific nature of the real individual actually existing 
will bring us again to a consideration of its place in the world. 
3. The Pluridimensional Referential System of Nature: The Living Body 
The most distinctive instance of the real individual is undoubtedly the 
human being. His distinctiveness affirms itself, above other features 
common to man and all living beings, by a most complex and reflectively 
graspable world stretching the universally shared, anonymous stream of 
the natural dynamis over a uniquely personal, world-life within which 
the human individual is simultaneously the creator and the living 
observer. 
Indeed, it is from this uniquely central position that man has the insight 
into the workings and operations of the world context in its depth, 
extending in various dimensions. 
Transcendental inquiry has revealed a marvellous schema of man's 
constitutive powers by showing how through the various layers of man's 
conscious, intentional operations the infinitely rich and self-enclosed 
personal life-universe of man unfolds. With the analysis of intentionality 
we may retrace its steps to the incipient phase of reflection, the structura-
tion in temporal phases of the flow of the experiential dynamisof man. 
But by the same stroke that we distinguish and determine the almost 
complete outline of the constitutive regulations with the reservoir of its 

400 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
intrinsic and self-regulative structurizing principles (e.g. the original 
eidoi and the world-horizon of possible associative-structurizing in-
centives) we discover its limitation. 
Indeed, psychiatric research reveals structurizing principles other than 
constitutively traceable, that is, other than those belonging to the tran-
scendental constitutive system. We find in the actual field of reduced 
consciousness instances of structures, which did not follow the regular 
constitutive scheme, for which the world-horizon of the past stages of 
the constitutive genesis can not account. We find noematic contents of 
acts which, in fact, present distortions of the regular structural 'models' 
of the constitutive genesis of things and beings. A considerable section 
of abnormal, psychotic states can be taken as an example. 142 
Indeed, the descriptions of the constitutive genesis have followed the 
'normal' condition of man's development, that is of his regular func-
tioning at the empirical level. Through comparison, however, with the 
'abnormal' as empirically established condition, we discover serious 
divergences in the actual working of the structurizing constitutive system. 
There is obviously not simply factual, but 'essentially', reductively 
scrutinizable reference of the constitutive agency to some other con-
ditions, which themselves do not belong to the self-given reflective 
system. 
Along the same line, we may trace a referential link which the dyna-
mism of the performance, the intensity, lucidity, expansiveness or 
shrinkage of the intentional activity indicates in the unreduced empirical 
functions of man. In fact, tracing the origin of sensory experience we 
extend its organization over an organized system ofmotoric 'intentions', 
with which as in the 'sensory organ' we identify ourselves as in some 
aspects of our 'body'. Their working in its efficiency and its vicissitudes 
points further to regions which are no longer reflectively inspectable in 
the field of reduced consciousness, and which belong to the empirical 
realm of living nature. 
We could still bring out several more ways in which the intentional 
constitutive system extends for its vital condition into a referential 
network. It is, in fact this dimension of ourselves which we constitute as 
'our body' that seems to be in the first place the basis at which all these 
references aim. Indeed, if we take into consideration that these referential 
pointers seem to indicate what science studies as the functional system of 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
401 
the organism, we would venture that in this perspective body is referred 
to as the original condition of living and of actual consciousness. On the 
other hand, we could hardly stop in our progress following the postulates 
of the immediately given. In fact, once engaged in the dimension of the 
workings of the organism, we must consider it further. How else does the 
organism appear to us if not as a most inventive living system which, 
however, functions with material not contained within itself. On the 
contrary, it has to rely upon the reservoir of what we call 'inorganic 
nature'. 
In this perspective we discover the dimension of nature disclosed to 
us through the very function of our life-world as the great agent of 
dynamic transformations in which the amorphous, unindividualized 
blind and brute nature emerges within the same line of inferential quest. 
The perspective upon body as the original condition of consciousness 
and as the center of convergence in the pluridimensionallinking of nature 
opens Up.143 
4. The Contingency of the Real Individual and the World Order 
Already in the perspective of the intrinsic incompleteness of the transcen-
dental system and its flaws postulating further explicitation of its con-
ditions than the one it may itself offer, we have seen that from the 
constitutive dimension we are led to that of empirical nature, starting 
from the field of reduced consciousness itself. It is there that we find 
those postulational references beyond its self-enclosed system of imme-
diate evidence. What they indicate is a network of links among the 
various functional elements which enter into the system constituting the 
real human individual. his being and his actual existence. 144 
Seen within the world-context, the real individual being exhibits an 
intrinsic self-governing agency which simultaneously directs its inwardly 
and outwardly directed series of operations. In opposition to traditional 
ontologies and to the phenomenologico-ontological analysis, his bound-
aries are neither territorial nor structural. As Ingarden maintains, 
his boundary cannot be defined by 'the spread' of his 'specifically own 
matters and properties'. Although the ontological structure presents his 
rational skeleton in its ideal form, in the actual becoming which means 
his existence, in his actual real existence, he does not enjoy at any point 
a guarantee of complete privacy. This does not mean that he is an inert, 

402 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
inconsistent body that could be at random infiltrated by exterior forces, 
helplessly disintegrated and carried away in the universal flux of nature. 
Neither does he offer resistance only in a passive way. On the contrary, 
he is a self-contained agent, perfectly consistent in his mechanisms and 
distribution of functions, radiating self-outlined spontaneity beyond his 
own intrinsic becoming. If he may be the self-governing agent partly 
transmitting the universal influx of forces, partly generating new ones, it 
is in virtue of his Intrinsic Teleological organization different from both 
the Ingardenian conception of ontological structure of the real individual 
and the Husserlian constitutive analysis of the 'transcendent' object. 145 
Through his self-unfolding entelechial nucleus he becomes the center 
and transformation agency of the interworldly dynamism in its complex 
and varied functions of which the causal nexus is but one of the basic 
formal mechanisms. Without such teleologically organized nucleus which 
on the one hand brings together the dynamic elements of the world-
context, and on the other, distributes them into channels or purposive 
chains of action, the constructive world-order could not be grasped and 
accounted for; neither would we find in it an approach to physical action 
as the vehicle of the world's dynamisms. That is, the world as a relatively 
consistent domain of objects could not be established nor a foundation 
be laid down for the specific immersion into the 'material' world of 
human action. 
In other words, were we to seek the key to a material ontology, it is in 
the entelechial nucleus of the real being that it and its subsequent teleo-
logical orientations would consist. 
In point of fact, the real individual exists in temporal phases of an 
inward becoming. First, his generation, then his growth and deterioration, 
which are exponents of the cyclic organization of the universal flux of 
nature, exhibit a purposefully oriented particular route; as a self-
governing agent, the real being regulates the interplay of the inwardly 
generated and of the outgoing energies toward the fulfilment of this 
purpose. It is through this consistently and purposefully organized route, 
an individualized segment of the universal strife of forces, that the real 
being is the factor of relative stability within the world context. He 
appears, in fact as the only self-sustaining factor within the flux of change. 
Furthermore, he appears as the center in which the universal stream of 
forces and shaping energies converge. Due to his self-devised and auto-

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
403 
nomous organization, converging in the purposive system serving his 
teleological progress, he may serve also as the basis for processes, that is, 
segments of the stream of the universal flux purposefully organized, but 
not for their own, intrinsic purpose. 
As such, the real individual offers not only the basis, the forming 
center but also the purposive orientation for the real world as it emerges 
from the universal play of forces. It is only through the real being as 
point of reference that we may approach the world. And yet, in spite of 
his specifically autonomous nature, the real being exhibits in his intrinsic 
pattern fundamental features, which have been always vaguely expe-
rienced and stated as the features of his real mode of existence. 
Indeed, the real individual in the two complementary features of his 
existence -
relative perdurance and change - establishes himself as 
'temporal'. His specific temporality allowing him to unfold the curve 
of his career directed onward upon the irreversible progress of events, 
in which at all levels - organic, bodily and intentional - each occurrence 
is instantaneous, unique and makes him existentially transitory, this 
'coming to be' and 'passing away' which summarizes it, is rooted in his 
intrinsic ontological skeleton. 
But concerning his coming t6 be no matter how far we would pursue 
interpretatively the genetic activities of embryology as proposed by 
natural science, the fact remains that whatever be the material, the 
specific spontaneity and the code of operations, in the philosophical 
analysis the originating structure presents a radical novelty with respect 
to the producing factors. That means that not containing at any stage of 
his origin the factors necessary for his coming to be as it is, in his 
specific nature the real being is not self-originating, but existentially 
derivative. But the pattern of ontological structure which becomes the 
central point of convergence in the generating process and which 
accounts for its organization is nowhere to be found among the generat-
ing elements. Consequently, the real being does not possess within him-
self a complete existential foundation: this foundation originates from 
a non-induced convergence of forces. These forces are operating accord-
ing to a pattern, preestablished and serving it but for reasons which are 
not intrinsic to the originating being. Consequently neither does he 
possess within himself the means to explain his ultimate reason, nor his 
final aim or telos. 146 

404 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Thus the intrinsic analysis of the real individual brings us through the 
three features of his contingency to the level of the world order. It appears, 
indeed, that in order to account for the generative process of the real 
individual, his ultimate reasons, we must postulate the existence of a 
universal order of beings among which he emerges and unfolds. It is his 
directly inspectable intrinsic structure as grasped through the eidetic 
analysis that contains intuitively given references to levels of considera-
tion other than those immediately given in a reduced procedure. And yet 
the eidetic structure of the real individual as presented by Ingarden does 
not correspond altogether to the one which the contextual inquiry 
reveals. Should we confront it with the structure revealed in the content 
of the idea it still diverges from it on another basic point: the ideal, 
rigid and relational structure of the real individual in Ingarden's analysis 
may well present a principle of rationality for the structuration of the 
real at the most abstract level, but the 'permanent' foothold of rationality 
in the concrete is flexible organization of function. Only as such it may 
serve as the principle of action and becoming. 
In fact, in phenomenological procedures neither the eidetic analysis 
of ideal structures nor the analysis of constitutive processes of con-
sciousness can amount to anything more than an elucidation of what 
has already always been visible, however dimly, that is, to a tautology. 
Its twofold procedure, of analysis and synthesis cannot contribute to an 
authentic progress in cognition of the universe and man's place in it 
otherwise than as a springboard for further inquiry. 
5. The Two Stages of Conjectural Inference 
The intrinsic analysis of the real individual as well as the system of inter-
connectedness in which he stays postulates the world order. In point of 
fact as a question already implies an answer, so indication implies the 
objective correlate which it is aiming. Our attention is in principle 
directed toward the aim to be accomplished. From the anticipatory 
intuition of the aim, or anticipatory evidence, flows a project of a route 
to follow, of aims leading to this end. 147 
If we consider the shortcomings of the individual structures which are 
offered by the phenomenological analysis we find questions which tran-
scend the self-explanatory power of analysis. These questions, aiming at 
the final ends and reasons of individual beings, coincide with a particular 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
405 
configuration. Indeed, does not the fragmentation of individual struc-
tures on the one hand, and the undeniable continuity of the total world 
process on the other, indicate the universal ordering, the project of the 
totality? 148 
The factual world order is, of course, an object of science. Science is 
seeking to establish factual interconnections and relations among sin-
gular beings, forms, substances in the dynamic succession of forms. But 
such a succession of forms, even if we were to agree with Bergson that 
it is spontaneously self-projecting, contains a constructive design. 149 
And yet upon scrutiny of this design itself, which encompasses the 
outline of world progress indicating its succession of forms and types, 
we find that the world order itself is contingent and transitory. It 
accounts neither for its origin nor for the selection of types, their genetic 
unfolding, their initial spontaneity nor the final aim of the beings it orders 
in their actual existence. These open questions bring us forward. Indeed 
they demand a further level of inquiry: a conjectural transition to the 
ARCHITECTONIC PROJECT OF THE COSMOS. 
From now on the real individual being, man and the universe will 
appear in a novel perspective of the cosmic constitution, 150 in which all 
the previous dimensions of phenomenological inquiry converge, finding 
their proper place of assessment and new ways to treat their unanswered 
questions. But, without venturing further in this direction, the above 
approach, even in its brief outline, seems to situate the question of the 
status of the real world and man's beginning at the most concrete level 
of consideration and stretches it toward the principles of their constitu-
tion, transcendent to both, within a vast network of conditions. 
6. The World and Man's Creative Endeavor: Originality and Novelty of 
Types 
In our criticism of the Husserlian-Ingardenian approach to the world 
and man we are led to contest its preliminary, pre-philosophical con-
ception of the world, basically one-sided and restrictive. This conception 
seems to have remained, however, surreptitiously guiding classic phe-
nomenological research. 
In point of fact, in the Husserlian-Ingardenian line of though the 
world and man were assumed to be 'given', where 'givenness' meant not 
only the cognitive delimitation of the legitimate borderlines of meaningful 

406 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
questioning but also contained a perspective upon the world itself. The 
investigation of the world and of man was delineated by a quest after 
the world in its cognitively recurring, stereotypic universal forms that 
are assumed to persist in the constitutive genesis of the life-world in 
Husserl's thought as well as in Ingarden's rational substructure of physi-
cal reality, which so far in this perspective remained inaccessible to a 
proper philosophical explication. 
It cannot be denied that it is the view of the world and of the real 
individuals in their rational skeletons that accounts for their persistence 
as the same: their identity seems the first condition for ordering their 
progressive development in such a way that life and human intersubjec-
tive existence can be possible. But singling out this specific aspect of the 
world as the object of investigation meant for phenomenology, as it was 
emphasized above, to commit it to ultimate Platonic and Aristotelian 
principles of the highest ideal values and the highest genus. 
By the same stroke the possible role and function of man with respect 
to the world and with respect to his own being and existence has been 
surreptitiously restricted. The genesis of his being, his personal unfolding, 
and all his endeavors entered naturally into the same line of an, if not 
altogether predelineated, then at least pre-ordained course. Moving 
invariably within the borderlines of prescribed universal types and ideal, 
unchangeable values, without means to evoke anything novel from out 
of himself by his own invention and will man could enjoy a merely 
relative freedom since he remained ultimately stifled within his rational 
jacket. The universal types of possible forms of beings and values, 
installed as absolute a priori limits, would not allow man to 'transcend' 
objectivity by his own initiative either with respect to the world or to 
himself. Let us recall that it is by seeking various forms of 'transcending' 
that Ingarden hopes to discover an escape from this rational web. But 
as long as we remain bound by this narrow preconception of the world 
and man, we will search in vain. 
Yet the question occurs: "In our fundamental wonder about the world 
and ourselves do we not recur at first to the universal and rational 
factors because we have to struggle constantly with the difficulties to 
organize and to assimilate in our experience and action the ever change-
able, the strange and seemingly unpredicted?" "Are the novel and 
original elements intruding into the assimilated and established frame-
work not a constant challenge to it?" 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
407 
In point of fact, as much as the world and man may in their unfolding 
depend upon the basic cohesion and identity necessitating the recurrence 
o~ types, they depend as much in their progress - crucial to life and 
human existence - upon their renovation. Thus, in challenging the classic 
approach I have proposed (in my prequoted writings) that the occurrence 
of new, original, and unforeseeable objective types and modalities of 
human experience within the constituted world belongs to the basic 
factors of its genetic unfolding. I submit that only by approaching man 
and the world simultaneously from the perspectives of their constitutive 
unfolding and of man's creative function may we lay bare and work out 
the apparatus for the philosophical assessment of the elements pivotal 
for the specific existential situation of both. 
The first one stands for the world-man situation in its perduring and 
intersubjective identity; while the second, by intruding upon the settled 
and recurring course, disrupts it; and through the upheaval which it 
causes, and which has to be dealt with, prompts a radical renovation. 
Pursuing the ensuing interrogation of "how the novel and original 
types of reality emerge" we reach 'beneath' and 'beyond' the rule of the 
constitutive rationale and thereby open the gate to their ultimate con-
ditions: the elemental springs in Nature and the subliminal springs in the 
specifically human condition. Without repeating my earlier analysis of 
the creative approach (in Eros et Logos) or anticipating investigation 
(now in progress) I will merely outline the major lines it offers toward 
solving the crucial issues presently under discussion. 
The analysis of creative experience at its incipient point opens up the 
issue of the status of the real world in relation to the human individual. 
Indeed, the wonder which evokes it yields two lines of questioning. One 
of them follows from the exceptional role played by the product of 
human creative endeavor within the context of the real world. The second 
line of questioning results from the unique type of experience which, in 
order to produce an original and unique type of object, compels us to 
break with the routine of life and the established world-context. We 
begin to wonder whether it is not man's creative action that is the motor 
of advance within the stereotypic genesis of the man-world constitution. 
How can this advance be accomplished? How may man constructively 
challenge both the settled current of existence and the established world-
context? 

408 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
Indeed, the exfoliation of the sources, ways, and means of the creative 
action of man shows how, when once awakened from the 'dogmatic 
slumber' of the passively unfolding constitutive function, man can 
activate his powers and resources under his own guidance toward a new 
orchestration. What are the pivotal points of this undertaking and their 
significance? 
7. The Creative Context for the Full-Scale Investigation of the Condition 
of Man and the World 
Let us recall that in order to do justice to the full-fledged situation in 
which the world and man jointly unfold their originary existential 
entanglements, we have to switch from the constitutive to the creative 
approach. The reason given for this is that, in emerging, the creative 
process alone reveals the condition of man and the world. 
In point of fact the creative effort of man surges from the radical 
conflict tearing man apart at the point at which his world disintegrates 
and has to be reconstructed. In the natural state of things man is a 
congenital element of his world. And yet a deep-rooted dissatisfaction 
with the world as already established prompts an overwhelming longing 
to overcome it, to free oneself from it at all cost. This impulse to 
'transcend' the world is aimed specifically at the given society and 
culture, with their established moulds of feeling as well as seeing life, 
human ideal, and nature. Ultimately this urge to transcend has as its 
target the laws of life and of human destiny itself. However, the actual 
world against which we revolt is present in every fiber of our personal 
being. We cannot fail to inhale it with each breath. It intrudes so 
intimately upon our innermost self that to evade it we have to part from 
ourselves. Our longing for a world that would give a more truthful, 
more authentic expression to the reality which we intuit is identical with 
the longing after a more authentic form of our self. Thus our longing 
to transcend the frontiers of the constituted world is identical with a 
longing to transcend ourselves. 
However, this revolt against the established expression of reality is 
not limited to the striving to 'free' oneself from its bonds; it is essentially 
a longing to reach deeper into reality by giving to it a more authentic 
expression in constructing a new universe and a new self. The creative 
impulse carries not only the revolt but the will to invent and to act. It 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
409 
surges within one phase of the already constituted world which disinte-
grates under its destructive promptings while it carries forward toward 
the next phase of the world into which it will bring the fruit of its 
inventive action. 
Indeed, the creative endeavor of man consists ultimately in dealing 
with reality. In order to create, it does not suffice to invent fictitious 
objects that will remain in the state of unrealized possibles. 'To create' 
means to invent forms original with respect to the already present ones 
and then, by incarnating them within an objective existent which has a 
foothold in physical reality, to bring them into the interworldly objective 
network. 
The creative process, which is incorporated in a consistent course of 
chain-actions, projects antennae between the disintegrating phase of the 
constituted world, from which it proceeds, and the new phase which it 
proposes to create. However, in its inner workings it is rooted in neither. 
The new orchestration of the human faculties and operations which the 
creative process elicits from both, the already developed and the virtual 
resources, is suspended above a gulf which opens between the two. In 
its progressive formation, accordingly, the creative process not only lays 
bare - like disintegrating psychotic states - the unintelligible primeval 
chaos of the elementary dimensions to which it ultimately returns and 
upon which it draws in its working, but, in addition, it ascertains them 
in their latent virtualities which man may and, indeed, does, draw upon 
to unfold his being and beyond that to create it according to his own 
designs. 
The task of philosophy ---' unlike that of psychiatric science - is not 
confined to assessing the existence of the brute preconscious fact and 
thereby to showing how, from the disintegrated interworldly being, the 
same schema of man-in-the-world is again passively to be brought about. 
Indeed, in order to explicate the human and the world's condition it 
would not suffice to discover the elementary chaos from which it springs 
in its brute beingness. Man's condition, allowing him to emerge as an 
individual real being and above that as a specifically 'human' being, 
consists essentially in his constructive and creative potentialities. 
From the preceding cursory account it should appear that the creative 
process is in a uniquely privileged position to serve as the guideline of 
such an investigation. Its progress brings to light all human faculties 

410 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
and resources in their virginal state, before their entry into the constitutive 
system of operations, and shows them in their respective associative, 
molding, discriminating, and generative capacities. It may disclose not 
only other structurizing factors and principles than those constitutive 
ones - as both possible and at work - but, beyond that, it may permit 
the retrieval of those primeval pulsations, spontaneities, and forces by 
revealing their dispositions for other constructive functions of man. 
The creative orchestration of human functioning outlines, indeed, a 
context for man's full-scale expansion in this interworldly ties of being. 
Its elements are brought together not according to the formal-ontological 
rules proper to the constitution but come into their flexible connectedness 
- to be ever renewed - according to their mutual relevance for cooperation 
toward the presiding aim: the invention and incarnation of a new vision of 
the human universe. 
Thus the creative context offers itself as a new framework of phenome-
nological investigation. Drawing upon the wealth of insights into man's 
constitutive functions and its ontological underpinnings, on the one 
hand it transcends radically the limits of objectivity. On the other hand, 
plunging into the empirical and physical dimensions and binding them 
within the common constructive network, it assesses them philosophi-
cally, first with respect to the originary condition of the real individual, 
as the 'elemental Nature', and second in respect to the specifically human 
individual, as his 'subliminal' factor. 
8. The Creative Function and the Freedom of the 'Possible Worlds' 
To complete my argument I submit that the approach to man from the 
perspective of his creative effort - effort operating by its agent's own 
discriminative and selective judgment - contradicts the Aristotelian-
Husserlian position concerning the status of the real world with respect 
to consciousness in a radical way. 
Impelled by the elemental spontaneities of Nature, devised within the 
subjective inwardness of its agent, and making its entrance into the actual 
phase of the world-context through a chain-action of man, the work of 
man's creation originates at a turning point which is decisive for the 
issue of man's freedom in its two-fold aspect: first, in man's bondage to 
Nature and second, to the ideal rationale of a universal order. 
In fact, in the foregoing criticism of Husserlian-Ingardenian thought 

BEYOND INGARDEN'S CONTROVERSY WITH HUSSERL 
411 
I have attempted both to emphasize how the question of freedom runs 
through the heart of their concerns and to show that within their 
assumptions the view of man cannot be other than that of a captive to 
the passive flux of his own unfolding. Even if, as in Ingarden's conception 
of the ethical action, man is granted the choice and the possibility to 
counter its course, his 'free' decisions seem utterly committed to the rule 
of absolute values. At the utmost man may realize within a subjective 
'concretion' the ideal pregiven which the limits of the intentional bondage 
do not permit him to transcend. 
The inquity into man's creative endeavor challenges the radicalism of 
this twofold bondage. 
Let us stress again that, inasmuch as the creative impulse stems from 
the revolt against the constraints imposed upon man by the preestablished 
order, it is oriented neither toward destructive action nor toward freeing 
man from his life-attachment for the sake of contemplating - such as in 
some quarters of existentialist thought - the void which then appears 
within and in front of him. 
On the contrary, is it not the constructive and inventive prompting to 
act within the creative impulse that dominates its dynamic charge? To 
undertake the creative action means then to begin all over again; it 
means, using Livingston Lowes expression, to delve into the deep well 
of our innermost resources; it means to initiate a new project from the 
odds and ends of the dissolved pattern of the hitherto life-subservient 
function; most importantly, it means to bring forth the capacity to invent, 
to generate the unprecedented, and to judge and to select by self-proposed 
criteria. It is, in the first place, the spontaneous surging of the imaginatio 
creatrix from the creative orchestration that responds to this demand. 
In the quest after new forms apt to frame this innermost vision of the 
authentic reality, the creative agent draws upon the spontaneously 
generative workings of this agency which proposes ever new material 
for discrimination and selection. This material, free from the constraints 
of formal structurizing, carries germs of novel principles and patterns to 
be progressively selected to adjust to each other and to preside over the 
building of new forms. 
What else does this 'freedom' not only to select within a given frame-
work of possibles - but to invent these possibles themselves - mean for 
man but his privileged capacity to radically transcend the two-fold 
bondage? 

412 
ANNA-TERESA TYMIENIECKA 
To conclude: In the creative effort man transcends the absolute rules 
of rationality toward the freedom of action. The creative process as the 
course of chain-action draws upon the full scale of human resources 
vindicating the powerful wealth of the primeval Eros. Hence these 
resources unified in a specific orchestration become accessible to a 
philosophical interpretation. Finally, through the new orchestration and 
with the reservoir of ever newly generating forms proposed by Imaginatio 
Creatrix man may raise above the constraints of the anonymous world 
- that appeared in phenomenology as the only and unique possible - to 
envisage the variety of 'possible worlds'. 
Within the perspective of the creative endeavor of man, the protago-
nists remain the same: man and the world. Nevertheless, the situation 
in which they are proposed for a reopened phenomenological investiga-
tion shows them joined along lines quite different from those furrowed 
by the classic tradition. Although they appear inextricably bound 
together and thus inseparable, the very motor of their existence lies as 
much in their essentially conflicting roles as in their interdependence. In 
their own respective rights they arise from this originary correlation not 
as passive counterparts in the preestablished progress of the totality of 
things and beings but as partners whose revolt-within-a-union carries 
the meaningfulness, the progress, and the telos of both.

B Ingarden emphasizes that Husserl has been the first to have brought out that idea, or 
species, as he calls it, is something altogether different from an individual being (Verein-
zelung). Consequently, in order to grasp it, it is not enough to make abstraction from certain 
elements to the benefit of others (as it has been accepted in the tradition of philosophy); 
a specific operation of 'ideation' has to be performed. Ingarden introduces a precision 
that is·lacking in Kategoriale Anschauung, which on its own, can neither penetrate within 
the field of the idea into its content, nor grasp the idea in its distinctiveness from the 
individual being. Only the distinction introduced by Ingarden within the structure of the 
idea among the 'constants' and the 'variables' allows us to understand in which way 
'ideation' is a specific type of cognitive operation: it allows us, in fact, to pass from the 
one-sided constitution of the individual objects to the contents of respective ideas in which 
the variables represent their specific type. (Cf. Spor, first ed., Vol. II, p. 289.) Ingarden's 
analysis of the structure of ideas is present already in Essentiale Fragen (1924) and came 
at this time to Husserl's knowledge. In discussing with Ingarden in 1927 this conception 
of idea in Essentiale Fragen Husserl showed him a manuscript dated 1925 devoted to the 
problems of 'Variationen " that concerned the operation of 'variation' and that should 
allow access to what Ingarden calls "the content of ideas". Certain details of this reflection 
are present in Formal and Transcendental Logic (1929). According to Ingarden, the complete 
text is incorporated in Erfahrung und Urteil. Ingarden himself has devoted the final chapter 
of his work to this problem; cf. The Foundation of the Theory of Knowledge (U podstaw teorji 
po::nania), under the title: 'The problem of the eidetic cognition and its use in the theory of 
knowledge' ('Sprawa poznania "eidetycznego" i jego uZycie w teorji poznania'), PAN

17 Thomas Aquinas speaks of created beings and non-created beings; in this conception, 
however, it is the idea of the 'Creator' and 'creation' which comes into play, while the 
concept of original being and derived being is strictly limited to the internal nature of beings, 
ascribing some particular origin to each of them. This difference at the start shows up again 
in the final conception of possible relations between the real world and consciousness. 
When Ingarden uses the term 'creationism' he forgets that he had earlier separated his 
o~tological conception of relations from aspects relevant to the problem of 'creation'.

62 The 'transcendence' of the work of Art which Ingarden claims is supposed to be of the 
ontologico-structural nature, means it emerges from their manifold as a distinctive and

is constituted entirely by acts of consciousness. Cf. the previously quoted passage in the

and a partial rejection of its assumptions, an alternate approach is proposed founded in 
the phenomenological investigation of creative experience.

(expecially to the literary work of Art) as insufficient to grasp its preculiar significance,

ROMAN INGARDEN 
THE LETTER TO HUSSERL ABOUT THE VI* 
[LOGICAL] INVESTIGATION AND 'IDEALISM' 
When I was in Konskie in 1918 on some private teaching 
assignment, I wrote a lengthy letter to Husserl on some 
scholarly matters. After the war in 1945, I learned from H. 
van Bredy, the director of the H usserl Archives in Louvain, 
that all letters, to Husserl addressed, mine among them, 
were burned during the war when the bank, where they 
were deposited in a safe, was struck by a bomb. Since the 
rough copy of that letter happened to survive along with my 
other works, and since it contains my first criticism of 
Husserl's idealism, I take the liberty of publishing a Polish 
translation of that letter. 
(Kohskie, end of July, 1918) 
Dear Professor [Sehr geehrter Herr Professor]: 
Above all I beg your pardon for not writing you for so long a time. 
In Cracow I was very occupied because I wanted to send off the com-
pleted section of my work before vacation time. 1 And I was successful in 
so far as I completed what I still had to do on it. That I did not dispatch 
the text in spite of its completion had only one reason, namely, that I 
could not find one person in Cracow willing to copy the text in an orderly 
fashion for a decent price. I did, of course, give the first 50 pages to 
somebody for a test, but it did not yield a favourable result. I therefore 
made up my mind to send the text to Freiburg to this young lady who 
has assisted me before to have it copied by her. For that purpose, how-
ever, it became necessary to first of all copy the changes I had made over 
again, since the existing handwriting is not legible enough. I have already 
partly done this, but since I am occupied several hours a day with my 
students and furthermore do work as much as I can, this mechanical 
work could not as yet be finished. All this made it impossible for me to 
also find time for the proper carrying through of my correspondence. 
You probably already know about my external affairs from Miss 
Stein. I am going to Lublin in the fall. As the situation has presented

itself lately, there are possibilities of moving to Warsaw, but in all prob-
ability it would not be earlier than during the next year. I want to use 
the time at Lublin to write in all peacefulness a work about the method 
and the meaning of epistemology. My activity in Cracow has had a cer-
tain success. 
Miss Stein wrote to me a few weeks ago that you are working again 
on the problem of 'Idealism'. 2 I immediately sat down to work since I 
am especially interested in the subject. Unfortunately, my finishing 
touches on the last part of the Bergson-thesis had to suffer from this, 
but the working hours of the last weeks will actually be for the thesis' 
benefit. I have once more very thoroughly studied the 5th and 6th In-
vestigation besides having thought over everything essential in this re-
spect from the Ideas. 3 Certainly, and unfortunately too, I cannot say that 
I have come to a conclusion. But at least I know what I cannot hold as 
defensible. 
Perhaps it will be of interest to you, dear Professor, if I write some-
thing about it. 
Let us begin with the VI Investigation! I believe it should be newly 
published in the same form as it is now. 4 However, it should be supplied 
with a series of comments in which attention would only be drawn to 
the weak passages and on the reasons for their being weak. At suitable 
passages one should find only an intimation of the deeper lying problems 
disclosing themselves and leading into new series of observations already 
carried out to a great extent in the Ideas. This way what is questionable 
would be provided with a question mark by the author and the problems 
pointed out. For the reader this would be a valuable suggestion indi-
cating the paths and relationships to the position of the Ideas. Such a 
presentation of the new edition would have the advantages of demanding 
relatively little work, of offering a great deal pertaining to the subject 
matter, and leaving at the same time the character of the work com-
pletely untouched. Also, so far as the terminology is concerned I would 
not change anything or hardly anything. 
Speaking strictly theoretically, the VI Investigation can not satisfy me 
in the following points (not to emphasize again the positively valuable 
and truly beautiful): (1) first of all, the problem of knowledge is seized 
at a moment when the actual 'getting to know' [das 'Kennenlernen1 has 
already taken place and the question is really of re-cognition [Wieder-

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
421 
erkennen] only. We do have already 'an idea' of the object, and the 
question is whether the intuitively appearing object agrees (i.e. fulfills the 
intention) with the 'idea' (the signitive intention); respectively, whether 
the intention is in conflict with the given. It seems to me that the analysis 
of the VI. Investigation should be underpinned through a consideration 
of the original knowledge, where we first learn to 'grasp' ['begreifen 1 
the object, where we do not yet have any idea of it and are just forming 
the 'idea' and furtheron possibly re-shaping and 'adapting' ['anpassen 1 
it to the object. The origin of the signitive intention, or better, the com-
prehension of the idea of the (to begin with) individual object should be 
shown and subsequently of the significant concepts. (This should also be 
carried out in respect to the analysis of perception in the Ideas.) And 
this reflection would only be completed with an examination of the re-
lationship between 'intuition' ['Anschauungl and 'thinking' ['Denkenl 
which is already essentially accomplished. The noetic difference of the 
intuitive and the signitive intentions should be more exactly exposed, and 
also a purely noematically (respectively, in a certain sense, 'ontically') 
directed consideration of 'significance' ['Bedeutung 1 carried through. 
(2) The VI. Investigation is ailing (and that is the most important 
deficiency) from a consideration of the essence of the 'object' resp. being 
(more precisely, of 'reality'). At bottom 'being' is treated dogmatically. 
Here lies the great improvement of the Ideas in having attacked this 
problem. (I will write about the solution presented there a bit later when 
I come to the problem of Idealism). In connection with this, the problem 
of demonstration [Ausweisung] and, where this is possible, that of the 
last demonstration could not find an exhaustive solution. Such a solution 
of the problem of reality as under consideration in the Ideas naturally 
required also a different position of the problem of knowledge itself. In 
this case, certainly, the problem of knowledge of ideal objectivities 
[Gegenstandlichkeiten] would have to be raised separately and com-
pletely different from the former. 
(3) The interpretation of the categorical acts as founded [fundiert] 
(acts) seems to me not sufficient. There exist, indeed, many founded acts 
which are not "categorical" at all. 
(4) I should emphasize more the separation between objective and 
logical categories. Furthermore, I should also what you name "sensible 
unity" ["sinnliche Einheit'l consider as a categorical structure and work 

422 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
out the latter more precisely. In this direction Aristotle would be of great 
help. Also, Hume's problem of the demonstration of the categories 
should be solved in this context. 
(5) I can not become friendly with the idea that in the case of cate-
gorical acts as intuitive representatives (in the sense of the VI. Investiga-
tion) the moments of the acts would serve the categorical functions. It 
seems to me that various reminiscences of Hume have contributed here. 
Especially considering the predicative categorical connections this posi-
tion would exclude a true realization [Erfollung] and would be in the 
final analysis sceptical. How the matter stands with respect to the au-
thentic logical categories ('and', 'or', etc.) as well as with the categorical 
formings [Formungen] of the objectivities [Gegenstiindlichkeiten] of 
higher rank I do not know at the moment. In any case, the solution of 
the VI. Investigation can not satisfy me. The categorical intuition as well 
as the intuition of essence in the specific sense must be subjugated to a 
deeper lying analysis. 
But to come to the problem of Idealism, about which I actually wanted 
to write and which has tormented me already several years. It seems to 
me that under this name different and fundamentally different problems 
are concealed. Usually in literature these problems run into one another, 
and often a system is called 'idealistic' which actually whould not so be 
named. I do not want to talk here about the equivocations, respectively 
about all the problems laying here, but, with respect to the things inter-
esting us, it seems to me that one has to differentiate three groups of 
problems: (1) the ontological, (2) the metaphysical (in a slightly different 
sense as you use this word), (3) the epistemological problems. Naturally, 
between all groups essential relationships do exist. 
The central ontological problem of 'Idealism' seems to be the essential 
community (resp. identity) between 'being' (resp. and more precise 're-
ality') and pure consciousness. The identification of the two I name 
'Idealism'. 5 In this sense of the word the position of the Ideas is definitely 
not idealistic at the first glance. No one has perhaps stressed the essential 
heterogenity of 'reality' and pure consciousness as vigorously as you did 
in the Ideas. Nevertheless, as far as I understand you, this original posi-
tion changes during the course of the investigation in a way that the 
essential difference is denied at bottom or construed into the division 
between noesis and noema. (Defining the problem more narrowly and 

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
423 
abstracting from ideal being), this happens by defining 'reality' as some-
thing intended only 'and beyond that as a nothing' 6 on the one hand, on 
the other by extending the essence of consciousness into the sphere of 
the noematic. According to your view the thing, for instance, as a cor-
relate of an infinite manifoldness of perceptions is nothing else at bottom 
than a noematic meaning (and 'beyond that it is a nothing'). With the 
entrance into the constitutive consideration this view becomes even more 
dominating. 'Thing' does not mean anything else there but a system of 
layers of noemata resp. a layer in this system so far an intuitable thing 
is in question. At the end we arrive at the equation: 
Thing=a particularly built noema-consciousness. This still comes out 
very distinctly in the sentence of the Ideas which touches a somewhat 
different point: "Reality ... essentially lacks ... independence. It is not 
something absolute in itself and binds itself only secondarily to an other; 
in an absolute sense it is nothing at all, it has no absolute essence, it has 
the essentiality [Wesenheit] of something which principially is some-
thing intentional, something conscious only." 7 (Here 'independence' is 
touched, to which I come back in a moment). At the same time you are 
saying that reality is something given through shadings, through man-
ifestations but not so consciousness. This can be considered as an in-
ternal contradiction in the system if one adheres to the original theses 
of the essential heterogenity. If one denies the essential heterogenity 
[between reality and consciousness] this assertion can be held firm, 
since, idealistically speaking, it says nothing else than that there are 
differently built noemata in the domain of consciousness as well as vari-
ous contexts of meaning between noemata resp. between different layers 
of noemata as well as various connections between act (noesis) and 
noema. There is then no need of talking about something essentially 
alien to consciousness. The noemata themselves are immanently given 
and they are absolute. The noematic contexts of meaning are of a kind, 
for instance, that a manifoldness of perspective noemata are belonging 
to one different noema. ([At the same time], those perspective noemata 
are more fulfilled than the thing-noema encompassing them by one 
meaning). This either means that the [ one] noema encompasses the 
manifoldness [of perspective noemata] corresponding to its meaning or 
that it constitutes itself as a new (and eventually removable) layer of 
meaning upon perspective noema[ta] as a higher meaning permeating 

424 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
the whole and transcending the lower layer in relation to the contexts 
of [its] fulfillment. (Vaguely speaking, a higher mel;lning staying in the 
relationship of that which is shaded to what is shading). This I naturally 
give as one example only out of the vast manifoldness of such contexts 
of meaning. The constitutional problems resp. an essential part of them 
(i.e. the noematic constitution) are nothing else than the system of ques-
tions concerning these various contexts of meaning in their mutual de-
pendency. 
If Idealism be in this meaning tenable, then the theory of constitution 
would be identical with metaphysics, and a part of it identical with the 
metaphysics of the external world resp. with the science of nature. 
I cannot bring myself to agree with this [kind of] idealism. The es-
sential heterogenity between consciousness and reality (resp. more gen-
erally: 'being') I cannot give up. To be sure I relatively clearly perceive 
the essential difference only in this confrontation: real external world -
consciousness. How it stands with the contrast: psychic subject - pure 
consciousness, I do not see quite clearly. By confining the problem to 
the real external world I believe that I can assert the following sentence: 
"Everything real is spacial or grounded in that which is spacial." Pure 
consciousness, on the other hand, is essentially spaceless, which does not 
mean a positive determination but a complete privation. If pure con-
sciousness alone existed, no one would come upon the thought of at-
tributing spacelessness to consciousness. One would exclusively charac-
terize it by different positive determinations completely heterogenious 
to space. The essential fact of the extendedness of sensedata does not 
imply any difficulty for me, since it is the great question, indeed, whether 
sense-data ought to be considered as 'consciousness'. I consider the 
difference in the mode of being as a basic heterogenity between the real 
external world and consciousness. The difference in the mode of being 
given I certainly take into consideration, too, but this belongs to an-
other group of problems. As a consequence of the first sentence, asser-
tions result such as: "everything (in an outerworldly sense) real and 
autonomous can be cut into pieces and eventually destroyed by separa-
tion or" - insofar as something autonomous is in question as being based 
in space alone - "is destructible by cutting into pieces that which is 
basing it", (i.e. all processes are dependent). The difference in the mode 
of being consists in the fact that the outerworldly real is essentially a 

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
425 
'mute' (dark, quiet, 'unconscious') being, whereas consciousness exists 
only in being conscious of itself, that it is a glow glowing through itself 
or a meaning living through itself (without reflection). Being of conscious-
ness lies in the fulfilling of this intuitive meaning, a meaning which regard-
ing its 'brightness' can assume different degrees (if one admits this ex-
pression) to the highest, most perfect consciousness. (This, of course, is 
a question of qualitatively heterogenious differences). This conscious-
ness can never be completely missing and has to be present as the found-
ing layer in every experience [Erlebnis] (compare Brentano and Logical 
Investigations V). 
This fundamental difference in the mode of being I am not able to 
remove. I readily admit that this view, (by the way, it is not new at all), 
has to struggle with various difficulties. Amongst other things it must 
be asked what these various noemata are (so far they are an intuitable 
p1enty) [Fiille]. I would hardly be able to attribute them to conscious-
ness in an authentic sense; on the other hand, they are not 'things' of 
the real outer-world. But do they necessarily have to be either this or 
that? Regarding this, only the noematic-constitutive consideration can 
give a definite answer. However, such a consideration can not put the 
original sentence just layed down into question. 
And now some remarks to the discussion. Certainly, any real thing 
can be an 'intentional object' but this does not exhaust its essence. More-
over, it does not belong to its essence at all that it is an 'intentional ob-
ject'. Without being perceived or in some other way intended it can exist; 
but a consciousness which would not be a living-through-itself, not being 
in some way present-for-itself just in the carrying out of the intuition 
(which only means another word for consciousness) is nonsense. This 
way it could not be. That is the reason we 'know' something of our 
'living-through' without having reflected upon it. The essential fact that 
in reflection the experience [Erlebnis] always appears as something hav-
ing been already is only an expression, a consequence which could not 
be brought about without the essential mode of being of consciousness. 
Pardon me, dear Professor, for all these heresies but they have to be 
expressed. Besides, it is this internal fermentation that does not allow 
me to finish my work about Bergson. It has to be lived through. There 
must be much incorrectness in all I am writing but one can free oneself 
from the false only in setting it against oneself first as truth. 

426 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
Reality exists only insofar as it is something 'in itself'. That for what 
it can be intended [vermeint] is actually irrelevant to it. It is that what 
it is 'in itself' and as such. It is a being completed at all times, and uni-
versally determined [bestimmt]. There is no indeterminedness in the 
world, except as indeterminedness of a potency which itself would be 
totally determined. For this reason alone I can not take the thing as the 
infinite perceptual manifoldness of thing-noemata demonstrating and 
motivating itself as consonant [einstimmig], nor can I take the thing as 
the meaning (as 'idea' in Kant's terminology) homogeneously ruling 
through this manifoldness. The Ideas do say identically the same in some 
passages ('Transcendence of the thing') and yet when they reduce the 
thing (implying that it is something intended and something intended 
only and 'beyond that a nothing') the Ideas, indeed, are not denying the 
transcendence expressively but they re-interpret it to such an extent that 
it actually comes to this denial. In this case then 'transcendence' signifies 
only either a certain construct of the perceptual noema resp. a certain 
relationship between the meaning intended in the perception and certain 
intuitable components of the noema serving as substructure, or 'tran-
scendence' signifies a certain relation between noematic meanings be-
longing to different layers of objectivation. But can this really be taken 
as transcendence? I know, 'transcendence' does have a 'meaning', as 
everything has in epistemological consideration, and this meaning con-
sists in the indicated relationships, resp. demonstrates itself in them, but 
is transcendence a context of meaning? 
The standpoint of the Ideas in the discussed questions leads to a 
problem which is unsolvable insofar as one does not presuppose real 
being alien to pure individual consciousness. Strictly speaking, from the 
standpoint of the Ideas only one single consciousness exists as being 
absolute and not even to be named 'mine.' For that reason the more 
direct designation 'individual' should be crossed out completely. I do 
not see at all why the being of consciousness of the other [anderes Be-
wufttsein] should be something more than 'intended' only the more as 
'emphasis' [Einfohlung] is founded in external perception. As the Ideas 
assert quite correctly it does not belong to the essence of consciousness 
that a world would have to constitute itself in it. Therefore the question 
for the principle of the factually found world has still to be raised. From 
the point of view of the Ideas it certainly can not be searched for in the 

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
427 
world itself. This way one hits upon the idea of a teleology with the 
positing of the deity given through different 'intuitive' manifestations. 
To begin with nothing is to be objected against this, although it would 
be only a shifting of the problem without the addition of some ethical 
principle. (But then the ethical values ought to be transcendent and ab-
solute). 
Notwithstanding that, there are two possibilities: either Descartes is 
right and God is a clara et distincta perceptio (idea) then he can not be 
excluded in the reduction, he is immanent and nothing else at The end 
than the 'reason ruling in consciousness'. This way, though, the problem 
is not solved but only posited in different terms (or it is a seeming solu-
tion). Or Descartes is not right, God is transcendent and can be excluded. 
But then I do not see why God should be an absolute being, a 'being-in 
itself' and not something intended only. I understand very well that there 
can be different transcendencies but is the God-transcendence a tran-
scendence (and one keeps the standpoint of the Ideas) then God as well 
is something intended only and there is no necessity that he would have 
to be an 'in-itself', an absolute being. 
At this place an objection can be made against me. Perhaps you would 
say, the reason that the world resp. 'the real' can not be something 'in-
itself' in an absolute sense does not lie in transcendence as such, but in 
the definite kind of world transcendence. 
In the first instance I would not answer anything to this, but the ob-
jection comes very conveniently for me. It makes aware of the question, 
why can not the 'real' be 'in-itself' in an absolute sense? What makes 
it so? (Whereby 'real' in an absolute sense shall not mean 'immanent' 
since this would be quite self-evident.) 
According to the meaning of experience, the (eventually and supposed-
ly) [eventl. vermeintlichJ given is 'reality' only then when it is not my 
'imagination.' In this context 'imagination' does mean more than 'in-
sufficiently motivated 'intendedness'. On the other hand 'reality' does 
mean more, eventually something else than 'sufficiently motivated in-
tendedness by the course of hitherto existing experience'. Sufficient 
motivation of an intendedness in objective reason does not only say that 
there is no conflict in the syntheses of experience, but above all, that in 
every link of the syntheses of experience something announces itself that 
is 'in-itself'. It also says, I encounter something in the respective acts of 

428 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
experience that is 'non-ego' and not consciousness, something alien to 
consciousness and something staying apart [from it]. 'Objectively valid' 
on the one hand means 'motivated by reason', and on the other, 'cor-
responding to being in itself'. Epistemologically considered, truth is 
certainly the adequation of two meanings. But it belongs to the 'meaning' 
of a real object's meaning that it is the meaning of this object; that it is 
incarnated 'in' it. At the same time, when this object does not exist this 
meaning also does not. This means that according to the meaning of 
experience, as well as of truth, reality is a being which is different from 
consciousness, from any kind of noematic meaning and which is an en-
tity existing 'in itself'. This being different from consciousness resp. of 
noematic meaning defines one signification of 'transcendence'. In this 
sense transcendence of a real object does not exclude its 'being in itself', 
much more it demands it, insofar as the object should exist at all. Speaking 
strictly ideally, the void possibility exists, of course, that all 'intended-
ness" are nothing more than 'intendedness" i.e. the possibility of some 
'transcendental delusion' a la Vaihinger's 'as if' (the reality of which 
would have to be demonstrated by the way). In this case, then, the 
meaning of reality as being, held firm here by me, does not change. It 
is rather presupposed in this case - and just because of this it is named 
'transcendental delusion'. On the other hand, these 'as-if-meanings' 
themselves are not transcendent at least in the above mentioned sense. 
Evidently they are transcendent as ideal 'objectivities' which is another 
problem. But should there be a reality then necessarily it would have to 
be principally different from these 'as-if-meanings'. 
There is, however, another meaning of 'transcendence' splitting itself 
into two sub significations. (1) with reference to a single perception: the 
meaning prevailing upon the perception resp. the perceived as such, i.e. 
the highest in a certain sense, all comprehending meaning transcends 
what is truly fulfilled in different multilayered modes so as to say, and 
it does so not only factually but essentially. (2) The second subsignifica-
tion of 'transcendence' is that the meaning of reality (i.e. the real object) 
necessarily transcends the meaning of fulfillment of any finite manifold-
ness of perceptual syntheses. 
Does this meaning of 'transcendence' perhaps exclude the 'being-in-
itself' of reality? It seems to me that this meaning of transcendence 
either is without significance to the question of interest for us or that 
it demands a solution of the problem according to my idea. 

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
429 
I. If this transcendence concerns a characteristic [Bestimmtheit] of 
the noematic construction only, then it is irrelevant for our question. The 
same is true if the 'meaning of the real object' in the sentence (No.2) 
above is conceived as something significant resp. as concept (or as es-
sence). In this case, namely, it concerns a relation between two different 
meanings, and no matter how this relation might look, in any case, it 
is without significance for the question whether reality is a 'being in 
itself' . 
II. Or if the (expression) 'meaning of the real object' signifies the 
meaning incarnate in the real object, then this transcendence demands 
that the real object would be 'in itself', since only then the 'meaning of 
the real object' can exist, and exist in the relation of transcendence 
towards the manifoldness of fulfillments. 2 
I consider the questions of demonstration [Ausweisung] obtruding at 
this place as principally different problems. That means in a concrete 
case, what gives us the right to posit the incarnate meaning of reality, 
resp. reality itself? This question leads to a new meaning of transcen-
dence and is connected with a new series of problems, questions of dem-
onstration and epistemological questions. We will comment upon these 
later. The only thing that should be noticed here is that one is not al-
lowed to confuse the following two different subject matters. 
The new meaning of transcendentence we just referred to is that the 
mode of being of reality (Seinsmodus der RealWit) reaches beyond the 
positional value (Setzungswert) demonstrable (accessible) in the finite 
manifoldness of experience. Without occupying ourselves at this place 
with this essentially epistemological sentence I notice that one should not 
confuse the mode of being with the positional value. If one avoids this 
confusion, the meaning of reality as aimed at by me will be secured. But 
if this confusion takes place, resp. if one identifies consciously the two 
on the basis of the presupposition 'reality = noematic meaning = con-
sciousness' then one has to admit that actually no reason for setting up 
transcendence III would exist. Or, if the respective sentence about tran-
scendence III should be correct one had to admit that one would run 
into a quite unheard of nonsense within the context of meaning of con-
sciousness. On the other hand this sentence does not imply any nonsense 
of a principal nature at all if one avoids the (indicated) confusion. 
By this means I do not see the reason which would exclude the 'being-

430 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
in-itself' of reality (i.e. the being more than intentional being) at least 
according to the consideration hitherto prevailing. The only question 
remaining now is whether [anything] and what could shake this result? 
I could, of course, be mistaken. But, provided the case that the above 
propositions are evident, the question remains whether a possibility 
exists of putting into question that what has been said. What we have 
done has been an inquiry regarding the meaning resp. the essence of the 
meaning of reality as being constituted. Our investigation is correct if 
an 'essence' exists [wenn es ein 'Wesen' gibt] adequately corresponding 
to the assertions made. 8 What does guarantee this existence, (presup-
posed the givenness)? The essence [Wesen] itself naturally is alien to con-
sciousness. In this sense it is transcendent. According to the proposition 
about the apriori knowledge there exists one corresponding act in which 
this essence is inadequately intuitable. The transcendence II and III thus 
does not occur any more. (Being given through shadings is not to be 
considered here, naturally. A quite precise analysis of this state of affairs 
would be necessary, but it has not been achieved as yet.) According to 
the sentence about the apriori this knowledge (Erkenntnis) is unshakable. 
Expressed in a different way: the proper essence does 'exist'. It is thus 
possible to have an absolute positing knowledge of a transcendent (I) 
object. Then the thought arises, does everything remain the same in case 
a constitutive consideration is carried out? 
First of all, what does 'constitutive consideration' mean? It seems to 
me that there are sets of problems of a different kind which could be 
subsumed under this name. 
Above all: (1) Constitution as static structure of the act and of the 
noema; the bringing out of different moments of the noema and the act; 
the grasping of the function individual moments fulfill, as well as the 
bringing out of the contexts of meaning and dependencies existing be-
tween the moments resp. between noema and noesis (act); concretely, 
[the consideration] of how a pre-given act-noema is constructed (eideti-
cally). 
(2) To this a deeper going consideration attaches itself with the guiding 
thought: which way must an act-noema be constructed in case the prin-
cipal [oberste] meaning of the noema should be a definite one (in order 
that it could be)? That means: what has to be contained in the moments 
forming the lower strata (resp., how can the limits of variability per-

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
431 
taining to the individual moments run) so that the principle [oberste] 
meaning of the noerna could appear as a given one (at the same time, 
what has to be contained in the moments of the act)? 
With (1) we stand on the ground of absolute facticity, although our 
consideration is an eidetic one. The principal [oberste] meaning (the 
complete set [Satz D 9 of the noema is presupposed as valid ( as legitimate); 
the same way as the existence of the act, and the question only inquires 
into the essential-factual [wesensfaktisch] structure. In the second case 
the complete meaning of the noema is pre-supposed and the question 
is about the necessary as well as sufficient conditions of possibility based 
in the structure of the noema and of the act. A noematic and complete 
principal [oberste] meaning actually becomes coordinated to a sphere 
of 'possible' noemata and acts. The variabilities which thus appear are 
also to be conceived in a 'static' manner; or differently expressed: we 
consider a single noema-act seized out of the stream of consciousness 
resp. stream of noema. At this place we neither pursue the continuous 
syntheses which can come about between several act-noemata nor the 
eventual dependencies of the meaning of a certain noema from other 
noemata (acts) and from synthetic connections. 
(3) It follows a consideration of the continuous syntheses between 
noemata-acts, and further on of the laws [Gesetzmaessigkeiten] pre-
vailing at this place regarding the conditions of possibility of intuitable 
sense data (of the noemata). 
(4) Constitutive consideration oflegitimacy [Rechtsbetrachtung]. Here 
is the abode of the last epistemological decisions. The course of 
consideration is a reversed one to the cases before. Not the principal, 
complete noematic meaning (of a plain act in the first place, then of the 
higher built, grounded etc. acts) is presupposed as 'valid', but the last, 
original, ('lowest') elements of the noema (not any more 'constituted' in 
themselves) have to be established as absolute facticities and investigated 
in their content and form according to their essence. Further on, it has 
to be investigated whether the content (and the form) of these elements, 
as well as the further structure of the whole noema, as well as of the 
corresponding act are of a kind that a noematic principal meaning to 
be posited would necessarily have to be given with the containedness of 
those elements in the noema. 10 Serving as a guideline at this place is an 
original opposition between 'subjective' (consciousness-like) and 'objec-

432 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
tive' (a 'being-in-itself' foreign to consciousness); and serving as a starting 
point is the absolute comprehension of the essence of consciousness (the 
act). On the other hand, the last (lowest) original elements of the noemata 
in their absolute facticity have to be established and investigated in their 
essence, as previously mentioned. Finally, the content of the (objective) 
noematic meanings one anticipates to be posited has clearly to be grasped, 
also the meaning of 'objectivity' has first to be investigated in a pre-
constitutive manner; in order then to become established as that what 
ought to be posited [um dann als das Anzusetzende und zu Setzende 
hingestellt zu werden]. (Provided, pertainly, that it demonstrates itself 
as valid in the constitution). The principal [oberste] meaning of the 
noema (object-noema) proves itself as 'valid', if, as said, the content and 
the form of the last original elements (moments) are of a certain kind. 
In their containedness in the noema, each of the strata (built on top of 
each other up to the object-noerna of the respective experience of knowl-
edge [Erkenntnis-erlebnis] (i.e. act plus noema» must be present resp. 
given necessarily. But this necessity can still be understood differently. 
For example, one could mean that the noematic meaning be 'necessary' 
insofar as a corresponding act (resp. component of an act) does exist. 
However, this necessity is not the point in question. There certainly exists 
a necessary correlation between noesis and noema in a way that some-
thing quite definitely intended (as such) would correspond to a definite 
intention. However, the statement of this connection would not help us 
in our aim to bring out the validity of the respective knowledge as well 
as the existence of that which is lastly 'objective'. The point in question 
here is much more a necessity, not being grounded in the acts exclusively. 
More precisely said: each act is carrying with itself something intended. 
On the other hand the acts (resp. many of the acts) are essentially moti-
vated by elements of the noema. The question is whether the acts to be 
demonstrated in a constitutive way, resp. the noematic meanings cor-
related, are necessarily motivated just through the last original noematic 
elements, or whether their presence is relative in respect to other extra-
noematic elements so that also the principal noematic meaning would 
participate in this relativity. Each act signifies activity and in many cases 
this activity is indispensable for comprehending the object. Yet in the 
domain of this activity one has to distinguish between a constructive and 
'arbitrary' activity possibly conditioned by other than pure motives of 

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
433 
knowledge, and the activity which would have to be characterized as a 
passive one, an activity succeeding the last noematic elements according 
to their meaning. Each noematic element is succeeded [[olgt] by an 'ap-
prehension' [Auffassung] (act) and correlatively to it by something ap-
prehended as such. If this 'succeeding' is of a kind that the 'act' follows 
the noematic elements passively-actively and if the 'act' is exclusively 
motivated by last [letzte] noematic elements (resp. by meanings already 
proven as valid) then the principal noematic [oberste] meaning is nec-
essarily given and the object demonstrates itself as existent. (Thereby 
numerous constructions one upon the other [mehrfache Ubereinander-
bauung] would be possible: the noematically original elements - appre-
hension I, - that what is apprehended I - apprehension II, - that what 
is apprehended II - up to the principal [oberste] noematic meaning.) 
This above mentioned necessity certainly is not a pure one. It is tainted 
and conditioned by the absolute facticity of the original noematic ele-
ments. In the opposite case the meaning does not demonstrate itself con-
stitutively, it does not exist 'in-itself'; it is in some way 'relative' (although 
in the pre-constitutional consideration the meaning may be presump-
tively [vermeintlich] given). 
The constitutive consideration of legitimacy [Rechtsbetrachtung] is 
subdivided into two groups of problems: (1) the demonstration of the 
material meanings [der materialen Sinne], i.e. the material constitutive 
consideration of legitimacy (metaphysics resp. its foundation, 11 and (2) 
the demonstration of the categories, i.e. the formal constitutive consider-
ation of legitimacy (formal doctrine of justification of the categories). 
(5) Constitution as ideal [ideelle] genesisf the noemata. Many noe-
mata of a series belonging to an identical object condition the meanings 
of the other noemata in a way that they have to be conceived of as 'earlier' 
than others. With regard to this fact one can understand the connections 
existing between the individual noemata (manifested in the different 
layers of objectification) in the sense of a succession. The manifoldness 
of noemata encompassed by identical object-meaning could then be con-
ceived of as a developmental series (resp. continuum) of the finally con-
stituted noematic meaning. The bringing out of the respective laws [Ge-
setzmiij3igkeiten] as well as of the possibilities given at this place would 
establish an ideal [ideelle] genesis of the noematic meanings. (The laws 
naturally not only encompass the sphere of noemata but also that of 

434 
ROMAN INGARDEN 
acts}. Such an investigation, noetically directed but essentially related to 
the noematic sphere and taking into account individual differences resp. 
types would constitute an ideal [ideelle] developmental theory of pos-
sible types of subjects of knowledge [Erkenntnissubjekte] (instinct, in-
tellect, etc.). All that would be in the sphere of immanence. Here part 
of the apriori-theoretical foundations of genetic psychology would have 
to be searched for. 
A precise sketch of the problems of the above indicated spheres of in-
vestigation as well as of the conditions of possibility of any such inves-
tigation is one of the most important thematic tasks which would have 
to be completed as soon as possible. 
Now we can come back to our specific theme. The question has been: 
could anything call into question our result about the essence of reality 
(presupposed that we can exclude 'mistakes' in our investigation)? The 
answer is now suggesting itself, but in order to make it complete the fol-
lowing has to be noted. One has [to distinguish] between absolute pure 
essences, to which principally no realizations could correspond (for in-
stance geometric entities), and essences allowing realizations (essences in 
the realization). The former exist insofar as they are conceivable in a 
homogeneious sense of intuition [einheitlicher Anschauungssinn]. The 
condition of their existence constitutes the lawfulness [GesetzmiifJigkeit] 
of the corresponding intuition. The others on the contrary are condi-
tioned through the essence of concrete being as such and exist as essences 
only insofar as they fulfill the conditions layed down by the essence of 
concrete being. On the other hand, there are essences which have to exist 
in case other quite definite essences do exist. In an entirely radical meaning 
of the word there is not one such essence at all which would have to exist 
necessarily. Somewhere we necessarily have to encounter a fact of ex-
istence. Among those facts now there are such that, once they do exist, 
are insuspensible (excluding any doubt), 'absolute' in their thesis of being, 
and other ones where this would not be the case. Among the essences 
allowing incarnations in concrete being there are at the same time those 
whose incarnations demonstrate an absolute thesis of being. Among the 
latter ones some again which would have to exist autonomously, and 
others which would have to exist necessarily, in case the former would 
exist, (and that because of the earlier discussed constitutive contexts of 
legitimacy [Rechtszusammenhiinge]). By means of the immanent, re-

LETTER TO HUSSERL 
435 
spectiveiy absolute comprehension of the incarnations of the former, the 
existence of the other would be ascertained at the same time. 
We can now say what a constitutive consideration could give us after 
having understood the meaning of reality. A comprehension of the 
meaning (resp. essence) is indubitable as an apriori knowledge provided 
that it would be a strict comprehension. But not all what is 'given', is 
legitimately, 'really' given. The constitutive consideration I-IV and above 
all the IV. constitutive consideration of legitimacy can tell us: first, 
whether the intended comprehension would be a real one. Secondly, it 
can tell us whether the meaning (the essence) of reality does exist neces-
sarily (sci!. objectively in the above indicated sense), and whether it would 
be legitimate or not (in case the original elements of the noema would 
be established absolutely). If this should really be the case, then our 
result regarding the essence of reality would be ascertained. In the other 
case there would be two possibilities: 
(1) The comprehension was not a 'true' one. Then we would have to 
demonstrate that this is the case and why. At the same time another, that 
is, the 'correct' meaning of reality would have to be exposed provided 
that the idea of reality would not in itself be an absurd one (which would 
have to be demonstrated as well, if.. .). 
(2) The comprehension was a 'true' comprehension, the meaning of 
reality is the one intended by us, but it is not 'necessary', it is relative 
to something. The meaning of reality is a 'construct' and exhausted by 
this characterization. In this case it could not legitimately be 'established' 
that reality is a 'being-in-itself'. It would certainly pretend to be just that 
(to have this meaning) but this would be a relative intendedness [Ver-
meinung] only. At the same time it would then have to be established, 
how it happens that it could come to this pretension, to a transcendental 
'as-if' . 
This way the ontological problem of the beginning ends in an epis-
temological consideration. But before we change over to it, we want to 
point out other ontological problems of the 'inquiry of idealism'. 
Presupposed, to begin with, that the meaning of reality is actually to 
be conceived as I have done, and that it also would be maintained in the 
constitutive consideration; (in other words, that everything real would 
be a 'being-in-itself' and the real external world something essentially 
alien to consciousness). First of all an ontological question arises: is the

essence of reality an autonomous essence and especially an essence au-
tonomous over against the essence of consciousness - as essence -, or 
not? 
Principally spoken, four possibilities are given: 
(1) Reality (as essence) is dependent and the essence of consciousness 
is autonomous, i.e. the latter could exist without the essence of reality. 
(2) The essence of reality and the essence of consciousness are au-
tonomous. 
(3) The essence of reality is autonomous. Consciousness is dependent. 
(4) Both are dependent and dependent on each other. So far as I can 
see the matter stands thus:

INGARDEN'S FINAL COMMENTS 
Here the rough copy of the letter stops. I do not recall either what closing 
it had. It is clear that the last differentiation leads to four possible 
solutions of the 'realism-idealism', but the solutions that I had conceived 
then, I could not find among my writings. Nevertheless, whoever is 
acquainted with my later works, can see that together with its sketchiness 
and many obscurities the letter contains the germ of my various later 
conceptions, beginning with the investigation About the Danger of petitio 
principii in the Theory of knowledge, which I have written during the 
autumn and winter of 1918-1919, and a part of it I have published in 
German under the just-mentioned title, up to the work, Controversy 
about the Existence of the World. That letter contains also an outline of 
problems which I have been concerned with in a series of my works, and 
which I have not as yet published - that is, the Introduction to the 
Theory of Knowledge, as well as the research of many years on external 
perception, released merely a few times for public information in my 
university lectures in Lwow (1926) and in Cracow (1948-1949). Also in 
relation to HusserI's views this letter contains a series of critical con-
siderations and alternate theoretical proposals which did not remain 
without importance for HusserI's later research. Despite the many 
shortcomings, and very abbreviated considerations there exists a suffi-

437 
cient basis for publishing this letter especially that the last redaction 
sent to Husserl in the summer of 1918 has been lost. The letter shows 
also how early my reservations against Husserl's idealism emerged. 
Adise from my remarks to Meditations Cartesiennes, published in part 
in German, it is finally the proof of the fact that I never hid my critical 
stance towards idealism from Husserl, but I have frankly discussed the 
topic with him. And that took place both in many of my letters from the 
years 1918 to 1938, as well as in oral discussiijns, carried on during my 
visits with Husserl in Freiburg in the years 1927, 1928, 1934, 1936. After 
all, it was for Husserl that I began to write the Controversy about the 
Existence of the World, and it was to him that I dedicated in the second 
jubilee book of 1929, the first systematic outline of the problematics 
concerning the issue of idealism, which later was actualized albeit partly 
in the Controversy. The present letter constitutes the incipient element 
of that theoretical process, which has been in fact occupying my entire 
scholarly life.

Editor's Note: This is the English translation of the only letter ofIngarden extant from his 
ample correspondence with Edmund Husserl. We owe to Prof. Dr. Helmut Girndt the 
credit for the translation from the German original which appeared in the Analecta 
Husserliana, Vol. II. The editor furnished an English translation of Ingarden's own 
introduction, conclusion and comments to the same letter which appeared in the Polish 
translation in the volume, entitled, Z badan nadjilozojia wspblczesna, P.W.N. 1963. 
INGARDEN's ADDED NOTES AND COMMENTS 
1 It concerns my doctoral thesis on Bergson's Intuition and Intellect which I handed in 
already in the autumn of 1917, and which I had been preparing for publication after having 
gained my doctorate in Cracow. The finished part', is exactly what appeared later in 
Jahrbuch f Philosophie. At that time, however, I was working on one more chapter of 
criticism which I have really never completed. 
2 The letter is dated 24.VI.l918. 
3 It concerns the Investigations of the Vol. II of Logische Untersuchungen. 
4 In the second edition of Logische Untersuchung, the sixth Investigation did not appear, 
for Husser! early in the printing of the book withdrew the corrected redaction and decided 

438 
to rewrite the Investigation, adapting it to the position he took in his Ideas. But that 
new redaction was never completed with the result that Husserl requested the VI Investiga-
tion to be published again with only minor changes in the redaction of the first edition. 
That matter was a frequent topic of my conversation with Edith Stein, the erstwhile 
assistant of Husserl. (1961) 
, Obviously it is in that sense that reality becomes identified with consciousness. (1961) 
6 See Ideen p. 91. 
7 Ibid., p. 94. Here I treat of 'Independence' (Selbstiindigkeit) which I shall take up 
presently. 
8 I use the word 'essence' here (in German Wesen) in accordance with Husserl'sterminology 
at the time. Today instead of that word, I would use either 'idea' or 'ideal object' or 
ultimately 'ideal quality' - depending on the context, and also in contrast with the 
expression 'the essence of something' (i.e. of Adam Mickiewicz or the essence of a house 
in which I live at present). I have brought out those differentiations first in my qualification 
treatise, Essentiale Fragen, (1925) presented in Polish to the qualification Colloquium in 
1924, which has not yet appeared in Polish (1961). 
9 It is Husserl's term 'der volle Satz', introduced into Ideas (cf. par. 133) only the particular 
case of which would be that which constitutes the equivalent of a 'sentence' and so 
particularly an intended state of affairs. It is impossible to develop this without a detailed 
reference to Husserl's texts. An acquaintance with these texts is obviously here altogether 
presumed, since this is a letter to the author of Ideas (1961). 
10 More precisely: in its ultimate foundation and in the successive build-up of constitutive 
noeomatic strata (1961). 
11 Today I would never understand metaphysics in this manner. See: Controversy about 
the Existence o/the World, Vol. I (1961).
