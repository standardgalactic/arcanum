Preface
This is the ﬁnal volume of a series of three volumes (the other ones being [9] and
[8]) devoted to the mathematics of mathematical olympiads. Generally speaking,
they are somewhat expanded versions of a collection of six volumes, ﬁrst published
in Portuguese by the Brazilian Mathematical Society in 2012 and currently in its
second edition.
The material collected here and in the other two volumes is based on course
notes that evolved over the years since 1991, when I ﬁrst began coaching students
of Fortaleza to the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad and to the International Math-
ematical Olympiad. Some ten years ago, preliminary versions of the Portuguese
texts also served as textbooks for several editions of summer courses delivered at
UFC to math teachers of the Cape Verde Republic.
All volumes were carefully planned to be a balanced mixture of a smooth and
self-contained introduction to the fascinating world of mathematical competitions,
as well as to serve as textbooks for students and instructors involved with math clubs
for gifted high school students.
Upon writing the books, I have stuck myself to an invaluable advice of the
eminent Hungarian-American mathematician George Pólya, who used to say that
one cannot learn mathematics without getting one’s hands dirty. That’s why, in
several points throughout the text, I left to the reader the task of checking minor
aspects of more general developments. These appear either as small omitted details
in proofs or as subsidiary extensions of the theory. In this last case, I sometimes
refer the reader to speciﬁc problems along the book, which are marked with an *
and whose solutions are considered to be an essential part of the text. In general,
in each section I collect a list of problems, carefully chosen in the direction of
applying the material and ideas presented in the text. Dozens of them are taken from
former editions of mathematical competitions and range from the almost immediate
to real challenging ones. Regardless of their level of difﬁculty, generous hints, or
even complete solutions, are provided to virtually all of them.
As a quick look through the Contents pages readily shows, this time we con-
centrate on combinatorics, number theory, and polynomials. Although the chapters’
vii

viii
Preface
names quickly link them to one of these three major themes, whenever possible or
desirable later chapters revisit or complement material covered in earlier ones. We
now describe, a bit more speciﬁcally, what is covered within each major topic.
Chapters 1 through 5 are devoted to the study of basic combinatorial techniques
and structures. We start by reviewing the elementary counting strategies, emphasiz-
ing the construction of bijections and the use of recursive arguments throughout. We
then go through a bunch of more sophisticated tools, as the inclusion-exclusion prin-
ciple and double counting, the use of equivalence relations, metrics on ﬁnite sets,
and generating functions. Turning our attention to the existence of conﬁgurations,
the pigeonhole principle of Dirichlet and invariants associated with algorithmic
problems now play the central role. Our tour through combinatorics ﬁnishes by
studying some graph theory, all the way from the basic deﬁnitions to the classical
theorems of Euler (on Eulerian paths), Cayley (on the number of labeled trees), and
Turán (on complete subgraphs of a given graph), to name just a few ones.
We then turn to elementary number theory, which is the object of Chaps. 6–12.
We begin, of course, by introducing the basic concepts and properties concerned
with the divisibility relation and exploring the notion of greatest common divisor
and prime numbers. Then we turn to diophantine equations, presenting Fermat’s
descent method and solving the famous Pell’s equation. Before driving through a
systematic study of congruences, we make an interlude to discuss the basics of
multiplicative arithmetic functions and the distribution of primes, these two chapters
being almost entirely independent of the rest of the book. From this point until
Chap. 12, we focus on the congruence relation and its consequences, from the very
beginnings to the ﬁnite ﬁeld Zp, primitive roots, Gauss’ quadratic reciprocity law,
and Fermat’s characterization of integers that can be written as the sum of two
squares. All of the above material is, here more than anywhere else in the book,
illustrated with lots of interesting and challenging examples and problems taken
from several math competitions around the world.
The last nine chapters are devoted to the study of complex numbers and
polynomials. Apart from what is usually present in high school classes—as the
basics of complex numbers and the notion of degree, the division algorithm, and
the concept of root for polynomials—we discuss several nonstandard topics. We
begin by highlighting the use of complex numbers and polynomials as tags in
certain combinatorial problems and presenting a complete proof of the fundamental
theorem of algebra, accompanied with several applications. Then, we study the
famous theorem of Newton on symmetric polynomials and the equally famous
Newton’s inequalities. The next theme concerns interpolation of polynomials, when
particular attention is placed on Lagrange’s interpolation theorem. Such a result
is used to solve linear systems of Vandermonde with no linear algebra, which in
turn allows us to, later, analyze an important particular class of linear recurrence
relations. The book continues with the study of factorization of polynomials over Q,
Z, and Zp, together with several interesting problems on irreducibility. Algebraic
and transcendental numbers then make their appearance; among other topics, we
present a simple proof of the fact that the set of algebraic numbers forms a ﬁeld
and discuss the rudiments of cyclotomic polynomials and transcendental numbers.

The ﬁnal chapter develops the most basic aspects of complex power series, which
are then used, disguised as complex generating functions, to solve general linear
recurrence relations.
Several people and institutions contributed throughout the years for my efforts
of turning a bunch of handwritten notes into these books. The State of Ceará
Mathematical Olympiad, created by the Mathematics Department of the Federal
University of Ceará (UFC) back in 1980 and now in its 37th edition, has since
then motivated hundreds of youngsters of Fortaleza to deepen their studies of
mathematics. I was one such student in the late 1980s, and my involvement with this
competition and with the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad a few years later had a
decisive inﬂuence on my choice of career. Throughout the 1990s, I had the honor
of coaching several brilliant students of Fortaleza to the Brazilian Mathematical
Olympiad. Some of them entered Brazilian teams to the IMO or other international
competitions, and their doubts, comments, and criticisms were of great help in
shaping my view on mathematical competitions. In this sense, sincere thanks go
to João Luiz de A. A. Falcão, Roney Rodger S. de Castro, Marcelo M. de Oliveira,
Marcondes C. França Jr., Marcelo C. de Souza, Eduardo C. Balreira, Breno de A. A.
Falcão, Fabrício S. Benevides, Rui F. Vigelis, Daniel P. Sobreira, Samuel B. Feitosa,
Davi Máximo A. Nogueira, and Yuri G. Lima.
Professor João Lucas Barbosa, upon inviting me to write the textbooks to the
Amílcar Cabral Educational Cooperation Project with Cape Verde Republic, had
unconsciously provided me with the motivation to complete the Portuguese version
of these books. The continuous support of Professor Hilário Alencar, president of
the Brazilian Mathematical Society when the Portuguese edition was ﬁrst published,
was also of great importance for me. Special thanks go to my colleagues—
professors Samuel B. Feitosa and Fernanda E. C. Camargo—who read the entire
English version and helped me improve it in a number of ways. If it weren’t for
my editor at Springer-Verlag, Mr. Robinson dos Santos, I almost surely would not
have had the courage to embrace the task of translating more that 1500 pages from
Portuguese into English. I acknowledge all the staff of Springer involved with this
project in his name.
Finally, and mostly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my parents
Antonio and Rosemary, my wife Monica, and our kids Gabriel and Isabela. From
early childhood, my parents have always called my attention to the importance of
a solid education, having done all they could for me and my brothers to attend the
best possible schools. My wife and kids fulﬁlled our home with the harmony and
softness I needed to get to endure on several months of work while translating this
book.

Chapter 1
Elementary Counting Techniques
In this ﬁrst chapter, we develop the usual elementary tools for counting the number
of distinct conﬁgurations corresponding to a certain combinatorial situation, without
needing to list them one by one. As the reader will see, the essential ideas are the
construction of bijections and the use of recursive arguments.
Although we develop all material from scratch, the reader is expected to have
some previous experience with elementary counting techniques, and is warned that
the material collected here can be somewhat terse at places.
1.1
The Bijective Principle
In all that follows, we assume that the reader has a relative acquaintance with sets
and elementary operations on them. Given n ∈N, we let In denote the set
In = {j ∈N; 1 ≤j ≤n}
of natural numbers from 1 to n.
A set A is ﬁnite if A = ∅or if there exists a bijection f : In →A, for some
n ∈N. If A ̸= ∅is ﬁnite and f : In →A is a bijection, then letting aj = f (j) we
write A = {a1, . . . , an} and say that n is the number of elements of A (Problem 1
shows that this is a well deﬁned notion). Also in this case, we write
|A| = n or #A = n
to mean that A has n elements. For the sake of completeness, we say that ∅has 0
elements and write |∅| = 0.

Elementary Counting Techniques
The elementary theory of counting (conﬁgurations) has its foundations in the
following simple proposition, to which we will systematically refer as the bijective
principle.
Proposition 1.1 If A and B are nonempty ﬁnite sets, then |A| = |B| if and only if
there exists a bijection f : A →B.
Proof First of all, assume that there exists a bijection f : A →B. If |A| = n, we
can take a bijection g : In →A, so that f ◦g : In →B is also a bijection. Hence,
|B| = n.
Conversely, suppose that |A| = |B| = n, with bijections g : In →A and
h : In →B. Then h ◦g−1 : A →B is a bijection from A to B.
⊓⊔
The following consequence of the bijective principle is sometimes referred to as
the additive principle of counting. Before we state it, we recall that two sets A and
B are said to be disjoint if A ∩B = ∅.
Proposition 1.2 If A and B are ﬁnite disjoint sets, then
|A ∪B| = |A| + |B|.
Proof Exercise (see Problem 2).
⊓⊔
A typical application of the former proposition consists in counting the number of
different ways of choosing exactly one object out of two possible distinct kinds, such
that there is a ﬁnite number of possibilities for each kind of object. In the statement
of the proposition, the kinds correspond to the disjoint sets A and B, whereas the
possibilities for each kind correspond to the elements of A and B.
An easy induction allows us to generalize the additive principle for n ﬁnite
pairwise disjoint sets. This is the content of the coming
Corollary 1.3 If A1, A2, . . . , An are ﬁnite pairwise disjoint sets, then
#

j=1
Aj =

|Aj|.
Proof Exercise (see Problem 3).
⊓⊔
For what comes next, given two sets A and B, we let A \ B denote the set
A \ B = {x ∈A; x /∈B}
and say that A\B is the difference between A and B, in this order. If B ⊂A, and if
no danger of confusion arises, we shall sometimes refer to A\B as the complement
of B in A, in which case we denote it as Bc, instead of A \ B.
The simple formula of the next corollary, which counts the number of elements
of the complement of a subset of a ﬁnite set, is an additional consequence of the
additive principle.

1.1
The Bijective Principle
3
Corollary 1.4 If A is a ﬁnite set and B ⊂A, then
|B| = |A| −|A \ B|.
Proof Since A = B ∪(A \ B), a disjoint union, the additive principle gives
|A| = |B ∪(A \ B)| = |B| + |A \ B|.
⊓⊔
The general philosophy behind the use of the previous corollary in problems of
counting is this: suppose we wish to count the number of elements of a certain ﬁnite
set B, but do not know how to do it directly. An interesting strategy is to search for
a ﬁnite set A ⊃B such that we know how to count both |A| and |A \ B|. Then, we
apply the formula of the corollary to compute the desired number of elements of B.
Some concrete examples of this situation will be found in what is to come.
Our next result generalizes Proposition 1.1 and Corollary 1.4, computing the
number of elements of a union of two ﬁnite sets. Formula (1.1) below is known as
the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two ﬁnite sets, and will be generalized in
Sect. 2.1 (cf. Theorem 2.1).
Proposition 1.5 If A and B are ﬁnite sets, then
|A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∩B|.
(1.1)
Proof Since A and B \ A are ﬁnite, disjoint and such that A ∪B = A ∪(B \ A), the
additive principle gives
|A ∪B| = |A ∪(B \ A)| = |A| + |B \ A|.
On the other hand, we also have the disjoint union
B = (B \ A) ∪(A ∩B),
so that, again from the additive principle, |B| = |B \ A| + |A ∩B|. Then, |B \ A| =
|B| −|A ∩B|, and once we plug this formula into the above relation for |A ∪B|
we get
|A ∪B| = |A| + (|B| −|A ∩B|).
⊓⊔
For what comes next, recall that the cartesian product of sets A and B is the
set A × B whose elements are the ordered pairs (a, b) with a ∈A and b ∈B. In
mathematical symbols,
A × B = {(a, b); a ∈A, b ∈B}.

Elementary Counting Techniques
It is also worth recalling that ordered pairs possess the following important property:
if (a, b), (c, d) ∈A × B, then
(a, b) = (c, d) ⇔a = c and b = d.
In this respect, see Problem 5.
The coming result, together with its subsequent corollary, are known as the
multiplicative principle or as the fundamental principle of counting.
Proposition 1.6 If A and B are nonempty ﬁnite sets, then A × B is also ﬁnite, with
|A × B| = |A| · |B|.
Proof Writing B = {y1, . . . , ym} = m
j=1{yj}, it follows from Problem 6 that
A × B = A ×
⎛
⎝
m

j=1
{yj}
⎞
⎠=
m

j=1
(A × {yj}),
a disjoint union. Hence, Corollary 1.3 gives
|A × B| =
			
m

j=1
(A × {yj})
			 =
m

j=1
|A × {yj}|.
(1.2)
Now, since f : A →A × {yj} given by f (x) = (x, yj) is a bijection (with
inverse g : A×{yj} →A given by g(x, yj) = x), the bijective principle guarantees
that |A| = |A × {yj}| for 1 ≤j ≤m. Hence, it follows from (1.2) that
|A × B| =
m

j=1
|A| = |A| · m = |A| · |B|.
⊓⊔
In applications, we ought to invoke this version of the fundamental principle of
counting whenever we need to choose two objects simultaneously, such that one
of the objects is of one of two possible kinds and the other object is of the other
kind (and each kind comprises a ﬁnite number of possibilities). In the statement of
the proposition, the two possible kinds correspond to the sets A and B, whereas the
possibilities for each kind correspond to the elements of A and B.
It is time we look at a concrete example.
Example 1.7 How many natural numbers have two distinct nonzero algarisms, both
less that or equal to 5? How many of them are such that the ﬁrst algarism is smaller
that the second one?

1.1
The Bijective Principle
5
Solution Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The ﬁrst part of the problem is clearly equivalent
to counting how many ordered pairs (a, b) ∈A × A are such that a ̸= b; the second
part requires that a < b.
Let us start counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) ∈A × A, without
additional restrictions. Since this is the same as counting the number of elements of
A × A, the multiplicative principle gives 5 × 5 = 25 possible pairs (a, b). In order
to count how many of them are such that a ̸= b, let us use Corollary 1.4: the number
of such pairs is obtained by discounting, from the total number of pairs, those for
which a = b. Since there are 5 pairs (a, a) with a ∈A, we conclude that there are
25 −5 = 20 pairs (a, b) with a ̸= b.
For what is left, note that (a, b) is an ordered pair such that a < b if and only
if (b, a) is an ordered pair for which b > a; in other words, the correspondence
(a, b) →(b, a) is a bijection between the set whose elements are the ordered pairs
(a, b) ∈A×A such that a < b and that formed by the ordered pairs (a′, b′) ∈A×A
for which a′ > b′. Hence, these sets have the same number of elements (namely,
ordered pairs); since they are disjoint and their union equals the set of pairs (a, b) ∈
A × A such that a ̸= b, it follows from Proposition 1.2 that the desired number of
ordered pairs is 20
2 = 10.
⊓⊔
For the subsequent discussion, we need to extend the concept of cartesian product
to an arbitrary ﬁnite number of ﬁnite nonempty sets. To this end, given ﬁnite
nonempty sets A1, A2, . . . , An, let’s deﬁne their cartesian product A1 × A2 ×
· · · × An as the set of sequences (to which we shall sometimes refer to as n-tuples)
(a1, a2, . . . , an), such that a1 ∈A1, a2 ∈A2, . . . , an ∈An.1
Corollary 1.8 If A1, A2, . . . , An are ﬁnite nonempty sets, then
|A1 × A2 × · · · × An| =
n

j=1
|Aj|.
Proof Exercise (see Problem 7).
⊓⊔
The next corollary brings an important elaboration of the multiplicative principle.
Corollary 1.9 Let A1, A2, . . . , Ak be ﬁnite nonempty sets with |A1| = n1, |A2| =
n2, . . . , |Ak| = nk. Then, there are exactly n1n2 . . . nk sequences (a1, a2, . . . , ak)
with aj ∈Aj for 1 ≤j ≤k.
1In view of this deﬁnition, in principle we have two distinct deﬁnitions for the elements of A × B:
on the one hand, they consist of the ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈A and b ∈B; on the other,
they are sequences (a, b) for which a ∈A and b ∈B. Since the ordered pair (a, b) is deﬁned
by (a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}} (cf. Problem 5) and the sequence (a, b) (with a ∈A and b ∈B) is the
function f : {1, 2} →A ∪B such that f (1) := a ∈A and f (2) := b ∈B, we come to the
conclusion that, although we have been using the same notation, they are distinct mathematical
objects. However, for our purposes the identiﬁcation of the ordered pair (a, b) to the sequence
(a, b) is totally harmless and will be done, from now on, without further comments.

Elementary Counting Techniques
Proof As we have told above, a sequence (a1, a2, . . . , ak) such that a1 ∈A1, a2 ∈
A2, . . . , ak ∈Ak is nothing but an element of the cartesian product A1 × A2 × · · · ×
Ak. Hence, the number of such sequences equals the number of elements of A1 ×
A2 × · · · × Ak, which in turn equals, by the previous corollary, |A1||A2| . . . |Ak| =
n1n2 . . . nk.
⊓⊔
In words, the above corollary furnishes a method for counting in how many
(distinct) ways we can choose k objects in order but independently, with the ﬁrst
object being of type 1, the second being of type 2, . . . , the k-th being of type k and
having at our disposal one or more possibilities for the choice of each type of object.
Here again, the distinct types of objects correspond to the sets A1, . . . , Ak, whereas
the numbers of possibilities for each type of object correspond to the elements of
the sets under consideration.
As a special case of the situation of Corollary 1.9, we can count in how many
ways it is possible to choose, in order but independently, k elements out of a set
of n elements, with repeated choices being allowed. More precisely, we have the
following
Corollary 1.10 If |A| = n, then there are exactly nk sequences of k terms, all
chosen from the elements of A.
Proof Make A1 = · · · = Ak = A in Corollary 1.9.
⊓⊔
In other words, we say that the above corollary counts how many arrangements
with repetition of k objects, chosen out of a set with n objects, there exist.
Yet another way of looking at the result of Corollary 1.10 is to start by recalling
that a sequence of k terms, all belonging to In, is simply a function f : Ik →In;
hence, what we established in that corollary was the fact that the number of distinct
functions f : Ik →In is exactly nk. Later, we shall compute how many of such
functions are injective and how many are surjective.
The coming example applies the circle of ideas above to a concrete situation. For
its solution, the reader might ﬁnd it helpful to recall the criterion of divisibility by 3,
which will be derived in Problem 1, page 162: the remainder of a natural number n
upon division by 3 equals that of the sum of its algarisms.
Example 1.11 Compute the quantity of natural numbers n, of ten algarisms and
satisfying the following conditions:
(a) n does not end in 0.
(b) n is divisible by 3.
Solution If n = (a1a2 . . . a9a10) the decimal representation of n, then m =
(a1a2 . . . a9) is a natural number of nine algarisms and a10 ∈{1, 2, 3, . . . , 9}.
Now, for a ﬁxed m = (a1a2 . . . a9), the criterion of divisibility by 3 assures
that each of the numbers (a1a2 . . . a91), (a1a2 . . . a94) and (a1a2 . . . a97) leave
the same remainder upon division by 3, the same happening with the numbers
(a1a2 . . . a92), (a1a2 . . . a95) and (a1a2 . . . a98), as well as with the numbers
(a1a2 . . . a93), (a1a2 . . . a96) and (a1a2 . . . a99). Moreover, letting r1, r2 and r3
denote such common remainders, then r1, r2 and r3 are pairwise distinct.

1.1
The Bijective Principle
7
Hence, for each natural number m = (a1a2 . . . a9) of nine algarisms, we have
exactly three natural numbers n = (a1a2 . . . a9a10) which are divisible by 3. Since
a1 ∈{1, 2, . . . , 9} and a2, . . . , a9 ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}, Corollary 1.9 guarantees that
the total of numbers we want to compute is 9 × 108 × 3 = 27 × 108.
⊓⊔
Problems: Sect. 1.1

deﬁned concept. More precisely, prove that there exists a bijection f : Im →In
if and only if m = n.
2. * Prove the additive principle of counting from the deﬁnition for the number of
elements of a ﬁnite set. More precisely, prove that if A and B are nonempty,

For the next problem, we deﬁne an ordered partition of a set A as a
sequence (A1, . . . , Ak) of subsets of A satisfying the following conditions: (i)
A = A1 ∪. . . ∪Ak; (ii) A1, . . . , Ak are pairwise disjoint. In this case, we use
to say that A1, . . . , Ak (in this order) form an ordered partition of A into k of

the point (a, b), he can go to one of the points (a + 1, b + 1), (a + 1, b −1),
(a −1, b + 1) or (a −1, b −1). If the pawn starts at the point (0, 0), how many

More Bijections
In this section, with the elementary results of the previous section at our disposal, we
present some instances of deeper applications of the bijective principle to establish
the equality of the numbers of elements of two ﬁnite sets.
We start by computing, in two different ways, the number of subsets of a ﬁnite
set. If A is any set, we let P(A) denote the power set of A, i.e., the family3
P(A) = {B; B ⊂A}.
Given ﬁnite sets A and B, both with n elements, a bijection f : A →B naturally
induces a bijection ˜f : P(A) →P(B), deﬁned for C ⊂A by
˜f (C) = {f (x); x ∈C}.
In words, given a subset C of A, we let ˜f (C) be the subset of B whose elements are
the images of the elements of C by f . In particular, note that
˜f (∅) = {f (x); x ∈∅} = ∅,
since it is impossible to choose x ∈∅.
3In Set Theory, a family is a set whose elements are also sets.

1.2

Hence, as a corollary to the bijective principle, if A and B are nonempty ﬁnite
disjoint sets, then
|A| = |B| ⇒|P(A)| = |P(B)|.
(1.3)
We shall also need another concept, which will be useful in future discussions.
Deﬁnition 1.12 Let A be a nonempty set. For B ⊂A, the characteristic function
of B (with respect to A) is the function χB : A →{0, 1}, deﬁned by
χB(x) =
0, if x /∈B
1, if x ∈B .
(1.4)
For example, if A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and B = {c, f, g}, then χB is the
function from A to {0, 1} such that
χB(a) = χB(b) = χB(d) = χB(e) = 0 and χB(c) = χB(f ) = χB(g) = 1.
For what follows, if A = {a1, . . . , an} is a set with n elements, whenever
convenient we can associate to A the sequence (a1, . . . , an); whenever we do that,
we shall say that (a1, . . . , an) is an ordering of (the elements of) A or, sometimes,
the natural ordering of A.
If B ⊂A, a (combinatorially) more interesting way of looking at the char-
acteristic function χB of B with respect to A is to consider it as a sequence of
0’s and 1’s, with the positions of the 1’s (with respect to the natural ordering of
A) corresponding to the elements of B. For instance, let A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g},
furnished with the ordering induced from the lexicographical (i.e., alphabetical)
order; if B = {c, f, g}, then the characteristic function of B corresponds to the
sequence (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1).
More generally, let A = {a1, . . . , an}, furnished with the natural ordering. For
B ⊂A, the characteristic sequence of B in A is the sequence sB = (α1, . . . , αn),
such that
αj =
0, if aj /∈B
1, if aj ∈B .
(1.5)
We can ﬁnally compute the number of subsets of a set with n elements.
Theorem 1.13 A set with n elements has exactly 2n subsets.
Proof Let A = {a1, . . . , an} be a set with n elements, furnished with its natural
ordering, and let S be the set of sequences of n terms, formed by the elements of the
set {0, 1}. By Corollary 1.10, we have |S| = 2n. We will show that |P(A)| = 2n,
and to this end it sufﬁces to show that the function
f : P(A) −→S
B
−→sB

10

Elementary Counting Techniques
(i.e., the function which associates to each subset of A its characteristic sequence
with respect to A) is a bijection. For what is left to do, check that the function
g : S →P(A), given by
g(α1, . . . , αn) = {aj ∈A; αj = 1},
is the inverse of f .
⊓⊔
It is instructive to note that we can give another proof of the previous result, this
time relying more directly on the bijective principle. Indeed, by (1.3) it sufﬁces to
show that the set A = {0, 1, . . . , n −1} has precisely 2n subsets. To this end, we let
f : P(A) →{0, 1, 2, . . . , 2n −1}
be given by f (∅) = 0 and, for ∅̸= B = {a1, . . . , ak} ⊂A, with 0 ≤a1 < · · · <
ak ≤n −1,
f (B) = 2a1 + · · · + 2ak.
Since
1 ≤2a1 + · · · + 2ak ≤20 + 21 + · · · + 2n−1 = 2n −1,
f is well deﬁned. To conclude that it is a bijection, recall Example 4.12 of [8], which
shows that every integer 1 ≤m ≤2n −1 can be written, in a unique way up to the
order of the summands, as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (obviously, none of these
can be bigger that 2n−1); such a way of writing m is called its binary representation.
Thus, the uniqueness of the binary representation is equivalent to the injectivity of
f , whereas the existence of such a representation is equivalent to the surjectivity of
f .
Notice how the above proof highlights the strength of the bijective principle in
counting problems. Let us see two more examples.
Example 1.14 Let n be a natural number of the form 4k + 1 or 4k + 2, for some
nonnegative integer k. Prove that In contains exactly 2n−1 subsets with even sum of
elements (and under the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set is
0).
Proof Let F0 and F1 be the families of the subsets of In with sum of elements
respectively even and odd. Since F0 and F1 are disjoint and such that F0 ∪F1 =
P(A), it follows from the additive principle and Theorem 1.13 that
|F0| + |F1| = |P(A)| = 2n.
Thus, if we show that |F0| = |F1|, we will get |F0| = |F1| = 2n−1.

1.2
More Bijections
11
To what is left to do, let’s construct a bijection between F0 and F1. To this end,
consider the function
f : P(A) −→P(A)
B
−→
Bc ,
where Bc = A\B denotes the complement of B in A. Since (Bc)c = A\(A\B) =
B, we have f (f (B)) = B for every B ⊂A; hence, f ◦f = IdP(A), so that f is a
bijection (cf. Example 6.40 of [8]). Now, the idea is to show that, if n = 4k + 1 or
n = 4k + 2, then f induces a bijection between F0 and F1.
Given B ⊂A, we have

x∈B
x +

x∈BC
x =

x∈A
x =
n

x=1
x = n(n + 1)

= (4k + 1)(2k + 1) or (2k + 1)(4k + 3),
according to whether n = 4k + 1 or n = 4k + 2. In any case,

x∈B
x +

x∈BC
x
is an odd number, so that the sums of the elements of B and of Bc have distinct
parities; in symbols,
B ∈F0 ⇔Bc ∈F1.
Therefore, the restriction g of f to F0 applies F0 into F1, whereas the restriction
h of f to F1 applies F1 into F0. However, since g and h are clearly inverses of
each other (for, f = f −1), it follows that g and h are also bijections, so that
|F0| = |F1|.
⊓⊔
The bijective principle is particularly useful to understand the properties of the
partitions of a natural number n. Here and in all that follows, a partition of the
natural number n is a way of writing n as a sum of (one or more) not necessarily
distinct natural summands. For example, the distinct partitions of 4 are
4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 2.
The coming example is due to L. Euler.
Example 1.15 (Euler)
Prove that the number of partitions of a natural n in odd
summands equals the number of partitions of n in distinct summands.
Proof Letting In denote the set of partitions of n in odd summands and Dn the set
of partitions of n in distinct summands, it sufﬁces to construct a bijection f : In →

Dn. To understand how to deﬁne f , consider the following partition of 51 in odd
summands:
1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 7.
Then, we can also write
51 = 2 · 1 + 6 · 3 + 2 · 5 + 3 · 7
= 21 · 1 + (22 + 21) · 3 + 21 · 5 + (21 + 20) · 7
= 21 · 1 + 22 · 3 + 21 · 3 + 21 · 5 + 21 · 7 + 20 · 7
= 2 + 12 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 7,
which is a partition of 51 in distinct summands. In what follows, we shall make the
above particular case into a general argument to get the desired bijection.

where a1, a3, a5, . . . ≥0 and, from some natural number k on, the number a2k+1 of
summands equal to 2k + 1 is 0. Then, we can write
n = a1 · 1 + a3 · 3 + a5 · 5 + a7 · 7 + · · · .
From here, in order to get a partition f (P) of n into distinct summands, substitute
each positive coefﬁcient a2k+1 by its binary representation (cf. Example 4.12 de [8])
and, if 2l is one of the summands of such a representation, let 2l(2k + 1) be one of
the summands in f (P) (you can easily notice that this is exactly what we did in the
particular case of the partitions of 51).
By systematically proceeding this way, we claim that we get a partition of n into
distinct summands. Indeed, any two summands of f (P) can be written as
2l1(2k1 + 1) and 2l2(2k2 + 1);
if k1 ̸= k2, then such summands are clearly different from one another; if k1 =
k2, then we must have l1 ̸= l2, for 2l1 and 2l2 are two summands of the binary
representation of a2k1+1 = a2k2+1. In any case, f is well deﬁned.
To prove that f is a bijection, let’s deﬁne a function g : Dn →In (which will be
the inverse of f ) in the following way: let Q be the partition
n = (m11 + m12 + · · · + m1t1) + (m31 + m32 + · · · + m3t3)
+ (m51 + m52 + · · · + m5t5) + · · ·

of n into distinct summands, where we have grouped, within each pair of
parentheses, all summands with a single odd part. More precisely, what we are
saying is that m2k+1,i = 2li(2k + 1), for some nonnegative integer li. Then,
m2k+1,1 + · · · + m2k+1,tk = 2l1(2k + 1) + · · · + 2ltk (2k + 1)
= (2l1 + · · · + 2ltk )(2k + 1),
so that, letting a2k+1 = 2l1 + · · · + 2ltk , we get
n = a1 · 1 + a3 · 3 + a5 · 5 + a7 · 7 + · · · .
We thus deﬁne g(Q) to be the partition

1.3
Recursion
The general philosophy behind recursive counting is the following: we wish to count
the number an of elements of a set An, which is declared by means of some speciﬁc
rule(s) concerning the natural number n. We do this in a two-step process: ﬁrstly,
we use the declaration of An to get a recurrence relation for the sequence (an)n≥1,
i.e., a relation of the form
an = F(a1, . . . , an−1, n),
(1.6)
where F is some function of n variables; secondly, we use the recurrence relation,
together with algebraic and/or analytical arguments, to compute or estimate an in
terms of n.
In this section we concentrate our efforts in the ﬁrst step above, by examining
in detail some speciﬁc examples ranging in difﬁculty from almost trivial to real
challenging. As for the second step, for the time being we assume that the reader is
familiar with the solution of linear recurrence relations of order at most three and
with constant coefﬁcients, as presented in Chapter 3 of [8]. Chapters 3 and 21 will
develop more powerful tools for the treatment of more general recurrence relations.
We start with a recursive counting for the number os subsets of a ﬁnite set.
Example 1.16 If A is a set with n elements, then A has exactly 2n subsets.
Proof Let an be the number of subsets of A (here, we are implicitly using (1.3)
when we write |A| as a function of n). For a ﬁxed x ∈A, there are two kinds of
subsets of A: those which contain x and those which do not.

1.3
Recursion
15
If B is a subset of A containing x, then B \ {x} is a subset of A \ {x}; conversely,
if B′ is a subset of A \ {x}, then B′ ∪{x} is a subset of A containing x. Since
such correspondences are clearly inverses of each other, we conclude that there are
as many subsets of A containing x as there are subsets of A \ {x}; however, since
|A \ {x}| = n −1, it follows that there are exactly an−1 of such subsets of A. On
the other hand, since the subsets of A not containing x are precisely the subsets of
A \ {x}, we have exactly an−1 subsets of this second kind.
The argument of the previous paragraph clearly gives an = 2an−1 for every
n > 1. Since we obviously have a1 = 2, the formula for the general term of a GP
gives
an = a1 · 2n−1 = 2n.
⊓⊔
Our next example provides a recursive approach to Problem 3, page 13.
Example 1.17 (Soviet Union) We are given n straight lines in the plane, in general
position, i.e., such that no two of them are parallel and no three of them pass through
the same point. Compute the number of regions into which these lines divide the
plane.
Solution Let ak be the number of regions into which the plane gets divided by some
k straight lines in general position. We trace out one more straight line, say r, such
that the k + 1 resulting lines are also in general position. Since r intersects the k
other lines in k distinct points, we conclude that r gets divided in k + 1 intervals by
these k points. In turn, each one of these k + 1 intervals corresponds to exactly one
region, from the ak regions we had, that r splits into two new regions. Therefore,
when we trace out line r we extinguish k + 1 older regions and generate 2(k + 1)
new regions. Thus, if ak+1 denotes the total number of regions we get after tracing
out line r, we conclude that
ak+1 = ak −(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) = ak + (k + 1).
Finally, since a1 = 2, the formula for telescoping sums (formula (3.15) of [8])

The coming example is perhaps the most celebrated of all elementary applica-
tions of recursive reasoning, being known as the Fibonacci problem.4
Example 1.18 A couple of rabbits starts generating descendants when is at least 2
months old. When this is so, it generates a new couple of baby rabbits per month.
If we start with a couple of just-born baby rabbits at month one, how many couples
will we have after 12 months?
Solution Let Fn denote the total number of couples of rabbits after n months, so
that F1 = 1 and F2 = 1 (the ﬁrst couple of descendants will be born only after 3
months, so will be counted just in F3).
Now, let’s look at the Fk+2 couples of rabbits we will have after k + 2 months.
There are two possibilities for such a couple: either it already existed after k + 1
months, or else it was born at the (k + 2)-th month. The ﬁrst possibility amounts,
by deﬁnition, to a total of Fk+1 couples. As for the second one, note that the couple
of rabbits under consideration descends from one of the couples that already existed
after k months; conversely, each couple that already existed after k months generates
a new couple of descendants that will be born at the (k + 2)-th month, so that this
gives an additional number of Fk couples of rabbits after k + 2 months.
Hence, the total numbers of couples of rabbits after k, k + 1 and k + 2 months
are related by the recursive relation
Fk+2 = Fk+1 + Fk,
for every k ≥1. Thus,
F3 = F2 + F1 = 2, F4 = F3 + F2 = 3, . . . , F12 = 144.
⊓⊔
In the notations of the previous example, we recall that (Fn)n≥1 is known as the
Fibonacci sequence.
Example 1.19 Using the letters A, B and C, compute how many words of ten letters
(not necessarily with a meaning) one can form, so that there are no consecutive
consonants.
Solution For n ≥1, let an be the number of words of n letters A, B, C satisfying
the given condition on consonants. For k ≥3, a word of k letters can ﬁnish in A,
B or C. If it ﬁnishes in A, the k −1 remaining letters form any of the ak−1 word
of k −1 letters and without consecutive consonants; if it ﬁnishes in B or C, then

Apart from its own contributions to Mathematics—as the problem we are presently describing—
one of the greatest merits of Fibonacci was to help revive, in Middle Age Europe, the Mathematics
of Classical Antiquity; in particular, Fibonacci’s famous book Liber Abaci introduced, in Western
Civilization, the Hindu-Arabic algarisms and numbering system.

17
the next to last letter must necessarily be an A (since we cannot have consecutive
consonants), and the k −2 initial letters form any of the ak−2 words of k −2 letters
having no consecutive consonants.
The reasoning of the previous paragraph gives us the recurrence relation
ak = ak−1 + 2ak−2, ∀k ≥3.
Since a1 = 3 and a2 = 5 (the possible words of two letters and with no consecutive
consonants are AA, AB, AC, BA and CA), we successively compute a3 = 11,
a4 = 21, a5 = 43, a6 = 85, a7 = 171, a8 = 341, a9 = 683 and a10 = 1365.
⊓⊔
As the two last examples suggest, there are several combinatorial situations, of
distinctive recursive characters, that give rise to the algebraic problem of computing,
in terms of n ∈N, the n-th term of a sequence (an)n≥1 that satisﬁes a certain
recurrence relation. The coming example, of professor Emanuel Carneiro, generates
a third order linear recurrence relation. In this respect, perhaps the reader might ﬁnd
it helpful to pause for a moment and review the content of Section 3.3 of [8].
Alternatively, he/she can take a quick look at Problem 5, page 79, or at the material
of Chap. 21 (especially Theorem 21.22.)

In Problem 5 (see also Problem 7, page 29) we shall prove that |Pn| = |In| =
2n−1. Assuming this fact for the time being, let’s separately consider the two sums
at the right hand side of (1.8):
(a) If A′ ∈Pn, it easily follows from the deﬁnition of (·) that
(A′ ∪{n + 1}) = (n + 1) + (A′),
where (∅) = 0. However, since |Pn| = 2n−1, we get

all of the disks piled at the leftmost rod, from the smallest disk at the top to the
largest at the bottom of the pile. The purpose of the game is to move all disks

Arrangements, Combinations and Permutations
As an application of the ideas of the previous section, we use recursive arguments
to solve three speciﬁc, though very important, counting problems, namely, those of
counting the number of arrangements without repetitions, of permutations and of
combinations. For what follows, we recall that In = {1, 2, . . . , n} for every n ∈N.
We start by counting, in the coming result, the number of injective functions
between two nonempty ﬁnite sets.
Proposition 1.21 Let n, k ∈N. If A is a set with n elements, then there are exactly
n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1) injective functions f : Ik →A.
Proof Let B be a set with m elements and let akm denote the number of injective
functions f : Ik →B.
Evidently, a1n = n (since there are exactly n possible choices for f (1) ∈A) and,
in this case, the formula in the statement of the proposition is true.
From now on, assume that k > 1. For a ﬁxed x ∈A, if f : Ik →A is an injective
function such that f (k) = x, then the restriction of f to Ik−1 is an injective function
˜f : Ik−1 →A \ {x}. Conversely, given an injective function ˜f : Ik−1 →A \ {x},
we extend ˜f to an injective function f : Ik →A by letting f (k) = x.
Since such operations of restriction and extension of injective functions are
clearly inverses of each other, we conclude that there are as many injective functions
f : Ik →A with f (k) = x as there are injective functions ˜f : Ik−1 →A \ {x}.
Thus, the number of such functions is exactly ak−1,n−1. However, since there are n
possible choices for x ∈A (for, |A| = n), we get the recurrence relation
akn = nak−1,n−1,
(1.9)
which is valid for every natural n > 1.
Now, observe that ak1 = 0 for every k > 1 (for, if |A| = 1, there is no way of
choosing distinct f (1) and f (2) in A). By induction, assume that akn = 0 whenever
k > n and 1 ≤n < m, where m > 1 is a natural number. Given k, m ∈N such that
k > m, we have k −1 > m −1, so that, by induction hypothesis, ak−1,m−1 = 0.
But then, (1.9) gives akm = mak−1,m−1 = 0. Therefore, it follows by induction that
akn = 0 for every k, n ∈N such that k > n. Yet in this case we have n−k+1 ≤0, so
that n(n−1) . . . (n−k +1) = 0 and the formula of the statement of the proposition
is valid.
Suppose, from now on, that k ≤n. Then, again from (1.9), we have
akn = nak−1,n−1 = n(n −1)ak−2,n−2
= · · ·
= n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 2)a1,n−k+1
= n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 2)(n −k + 1).
⊓⊔

Elementary Counting Techniques
Since an injective function f : Ik →A is simply a sequence of k pairwise
distinct terms, all chosen from the elements of A, we can rephrase the above
proposition according to the following
Corollary 1.22 If |A| = n, then there are exactly n(n−1) . . . (n−k+1) sequences
formed by k pairwise distinct elements of A.
We can apply this corollary to a given combinatorial situation whenever it asks us
to count how many are the ordered choices of k pairwise distinct elements of a given
set A. For this reason, from now on we shall say that the previous corollary counts
the number of arrangements without repetition of k pairwise distinct elements,
chosen from a given set of n elements.
Example 1.23 How many are the natural numbers of three pairwise distinct
algarisms?
Solution To choose a natural number with three pairwise distinct algarisms is the
same as to choose a sequence (a, b, c) such that a, b, c ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} are
pairwise distinct and a ̸= 0. Corollary 1.4 assures that, in order to count the number
of possible such sequences, it sufﬁces to count the number of sequences (a, b, c),
with pairwise distinct a, b, c ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}, and then to discount the number of
such sequences of the form (0, b, c).
By the previous corollary, the number of sequences (a, b, c) with a, b, c ∈
{0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} pairwise distinct but without the restriction a ̸= 0 is 10 × 9 × 8 =
720. On the other hand, the number of such sequences of the form (0, b, c) is
9 × 8 = 72. Hence, the desired result is 720 −72 = 648.
⊓⊔
The counting of arrangements without repetition has a very important conse-
quence, based on the following
Deﬁnition 1.24 A permutation of the elements of a nonempty set A is a bijection
f : A →A.
If A is ﬁnite and nonempty, it is not difﬁcult to prove (see Problem 4, page 7)
that a function f : A →A is bijective if and only if it is injective. Hence, letting
k = n in the formula of Proposition 1.21, we immediately get our next result.
Corollary 1.25 If |A| = n, then there are exactly n! permutations of the elements
of A.
Given a ﬁnite set A with n elements and a natural number k such that 0 ≤k ≤n,
the coming result uses a recursive argument to compute the number of subsets of A
with k elements each. In order to properly state it, recall (cf. Section 4.2 of [8]) that,
for nonnegative integers n and k with 0 ≤k ≤n, one deﬁnes the binomial number
n

,
which is known as Stifel’s relation and allows us to prove that
n
k

∈N for every n
and k as above.
Proposition 1.26 If A is a ﬁnite set with n elements and 0 ≤k ≤n, then A
possesses exactly
n
k

subsets of k elements.
Proof If k = 0 there is nothing to do, for ∅is the only subset of A having 0 elements
and
n
0

= 1. Thus, let 1 ≤k ≤n and Cn
k be the number of subsets of A with k
elements.
For a ﬁxed x ∈A, there are two kinds of subsets of A with k elements: those
which do not contain x and those which do contain x. The former ones are precisely
the k-element subsets of A \ {x}; since |A \ {x}| = n −1, there are exactly Cn−1
k
of
these subsets of k elements of A.
On the other hand, if B ⊂A has k elements and x ∈B, then B \ {x} ⊂A \ {x}
has k−1 elements; conversely, if B′ ⊂A\{x} has k−1 elements, then B′∪{x} ⊂A
has k elements, one of which is x. Since such correspondences are clearly inverses
of each other, we conclude that there are as many k-element subsets of A containing
x, as there are k −1 element subsets of A \ {x}; thus, there are exactly Cn−1
k−1 such
k-element subsets of A.
Taking these two contributions into account, we obtain for 1 ≤k ≤n the
recurrence relation
Cn
k = Cn−1

which is identical to Stifel’s relation for the binomial numbers

⊓⊔
In words, the previous proposition computes how many are the unordered choices
of k distinct elements of a set having n elements; one uses to say that such choices
are the combinations of n objects, taking k at a time. Also thanks to the former
proposition, one uses to refer to the binomial number

as “n chooses k”.
Example 1.27 When all diagonals of a certain convex octagon have been drawn,
one noticed that there were no three of them passing through a single interior point
of the octagon. How many points in the interior of the octagon are intersection points
of two of its diagonals?
Solution Firstly, note that the condition on the diagonals of the octagon guarantees
that each one of the points of intersection we wish to count is determined by a
single pair of diagonals. Hence, it sufﬁces to count how many pairs of diagonals of
the octagon intersect in its interior. To this end, note that each 4-element subset of

26

Elementary Counting Techniques
the set of vertices of the octagon determines exactly two diagonals which intersect
in the interior of it; conversely, if two diagonals of the octagon do intersect in its
interior, then the set of their endpoints is a 4-element subset of the set of vertices of
the octagon. Therefore, the bijective principle assures that there are as many pairs of
diagonals intersecting in the interior of the octagon as there are 4-element subsets
of its set of vertices. By Proposition 1.26, then, the number of points of intersection
we wish to count equals
8


= 70.
⊓⊔
Our next example brings a beautiful application of combinations, due to the
American mathematician of the twentieth century Irving Kaplansky and known as
Kaplansky’s ﬁrst lemma.6
Example 1.28 (Kaplansky) Given n, k ∈N, with n ≥2k −1, show that the number
k-element subsets of In without consecutive elements equals
n−k+1
k

.
Proof We ﬁrst note that if A ⊂In has k elements, no two of which being
consecutive, then n ≥2k −1, for between any two elements of A there is at least
one element of In not belonging to A. Hence, the assumption n ≥2k −1 made
in the statement is natural and gives n −k + 1 ≥k, so that the binomial number
n−k+1
k

is well deﬁned.
Now, recall that the characteristic function of A in In is a sequence of n terms,
with exactly k of them being equal to 1 and the other n −k being equal to 0;
moreover, our assumption on A assures that any two 1’s in such a sequence are
nonconsecutive. Since the characteristic function determines A, it sufﬁces to count
the number of such sequences.
To what is left to do, let’s ﬁrst consider a sequence of 2(n −k) + 1 terms, in
which the n −k terms with even indices are equal to 0:
( , 0, , 0, , . . . , , 0,



2(n−k)+1
).
If we are to have exactly k terms equal to 1, no two of which being consecutive, it is
necessary and sufﬁcient to choose, from the set of n−k +1 positions corresponding
to odd indices, the k positions in which we want to put the 1’s (as we previously
pointed out, this is possible because n −k + 1 ≥k). According to Proposition 1.26,
there are precisely
n−k+1
k

possible choices for such positions. Finally, once we
erase the not chosen positions, we are left with the characteristic sequence of a set
satisfying the conditions of the problem. Conversely, it is immediate that every such
characteristic sequence can be obtained as above, so that the answer to our problem
is
n−k+1
k

.
⊓⊔
Now, we are given natural numbers k and n and nonnegative integers n1, . . . , nk
satisfying n = n1+· · ·+nk. We also have k distinct types of objects, say a1, . . . , ak,
6There is also a Kaplansky’s second lemma, which will be the object of Problem 12. Kaplansky
devised these two results in order to solve Lucas’ problem—cf. Problem 10, page 41.

27
and would like to count how many sequences of n terms have exactly n1 terms equal
to a1, . . . , nk terms equal to ak. Yet in another way, we say that such a sequence is
a permutation with repeated elements of n objects, each of which being of one of
the types a1, . . . , ak and with n1 objects of type a1, . . . , nk objects of type ak. Let’s
now look at an equivalent problem.
If f : In →{a1, . . . , ak} is a sequence satisfying the conditions of the previous
paragraph (i.e., with n1 terms equal to a1, . . . , nk terms equal to ak), then, taking
inverse images, we obtain
In = f −1(a1) ∪. . . ∪f −1(ak).
At the right hand side above, the sets f −1(aj), 1 ≤j ≤k, are pairwise disjoint and
such that |f −1(aj)| = nj for 1 ≤j ≤k; we say that the union at the right hand side
is the partition of In induced by f . Conversely, associated to a partition of In of
the form In = A1 ∪. . . ∪Ak, with |Aj| = nj for 1 ≤j ≤k, we have the sequence
f : In →{a1, . . . , ak} such that f (Aj) = {aj} for 1 ≤j ≤k. Therefore, the
bijective principle guarantees that a problem equivalent to the one of the previous
paragraph is that of counting the number of distinct partitions of a set of n elements
into k pairwise disjoint subsets A1, . . . , Ak, under the restriction that |A1| = n1, . . . ,
|Ak| = nk.
This being said, the coming result solves both counting problems described
above.
Proposition 1.29 Let n, k ∈N and n = n1 +· · ·+nk be a partition of n in positive
integers. If A is a set with n elements and

(1.10)
Proof We shall make induction on k ∈N. Firstly, the case k = 1 is trivial, for in
this case n1 = n and the only subset of A with n elements is A itself. As induction
hypothesis, let l ≥2 be a natural number and assume that (1.10) is true for 1 ≤k < l
and every partition of n into k positive integers n1, . . . , nk. Then, ﬁx a partition
n = n1 + · · · + nl of n in positive integers.
The bijective principle assures that, for each subset Al of A, with |Al| = nl,
there are as many partitions of A as in the statement of the proposition as there are
partitions
A \ Al = A1 ∪. . . ∪Al−1,
of A \ Al into l −1 subsets A1, . . . , Al−1, with |Aj| = nj for 1 ≤j ≤l −1.
Since |A \ Al| = n −nl, the total number of such partitions of A \ Al is,
by deﬁnition, equal to

For the coming problem, we deﬁne a multiset as an ordered pair (A, f ),
where A is a set and f is a function from A into N. If x ∈A, we say that x is
an element of multiset (A, f ); in such a case, f (x) ∈N is the frequency of x as
an element of (A, f ). A multiset (A, f ) is ﬁnite if A is a ﬁnite set. In this case,
the number of elements of the multiset is deﬁned as the sum of the frequencies
of the elements of A, seen as elements of (A, f ); in symbols,
|(A, f )| =

(1.13)
Informally, we denote a multiset (A, f ) simply by Af (or even A, whenever
f is understood and there is no danger of confusion with the set A itself); we
declare Af between double curly braces, instead of simple ones (which are
reserved for declaring sets), with each x ∈A being repeated exactly f (x) times;
for instance, if A = {a, b, c} and f : A →N is given by f (a) = 2, f (b) = 3
and f (c) = 1, we declare the multiset Af by writing
Af = {{a, a, b, b, b, c}}.

Chapter 2
More Counting Techniques
In this chapter we study a few more elaborate counting techniques. We start by
discussing the inclusion-exclusion principle, which, roughly speaking, is a formula
for counting the number of elements of a ﬁnite union of ﬁnite sets. The presentation
continues with the notion of double counting for, counting a certain number of
conﬁgurations in two distinct ways, to infer some hidden result. Then, a brief
discussion of equivalence relations and their role in counting problems follows.
Among other interesting results, we illustrate it by proving a famous theorem of
B. Bollobás, on extremal set theory. The chapter ends with a glimpse on the use of
the language of metric spaces in certain speciﬁc counting problems.
2.1
The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
In this section we extend the formula of Proposition 1.5 for the number of elements
of the union of two ﬁnite sets. The following result is known as the inclusion-
exclusion principle, and is usually attributed to the French mathematician of the
eighteenth century Abraham de Moivre.
Theorem 2.1 (de Moivre) If A1, A2, . . . , An are ﬁnite sets, then

(2.1)
with the last sum above extending over all sequences (i1, i2, . . . , ik) of integers such
that 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n.
Proof Fix an x ∈A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An and suppose that x belongs to exactly l of
the sets A1, A2, . . . , An. We shall show that the expression at the right hand side
of (2.1) counts x exactly once.

Note that, for a ﬁxed 1 ≤k ≤n, x is counted in the sum

|Ai1 ∩. . . ∩Aik|
as many times as the number of sequences (i1, . . . , ik) such that 1 ≤i1 < · · · <
ik ≤n and x ∈Ai1 ∩. . . ∩Aik.
Since x belongs to exactly l of the given sets, we can restrict ourselves to the case
in which k ≤l; indeed, if k > l, then x will not belong to at least one of the sets
Ai1, . . . , Aik, so that x /∈Ai1 ∩. . . ∩Aik.
For k ≤l, the number of sequences (i1, . . . , ik) as above equals the number of
ways of choosing k of the l sets containing x. Therefore, there are exactly

Example 2.2 Let n ≥3 be a natural number. Show that there does not exist sets A1,
A2, . . . , An, with n elements each and satisfying the following conditions:
(a) Any two of the Ai’s have exactly two elements in common.
(b) Any three of the Ai’s have no elements in common.
Solution By the sake of contradiction, assume that there does exist sets A1, A2, . . . ,
An satisfying the stated conditions. If we show that |A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An| = n, we
would have Ai ⊂A1 ∪A2 ∪. . .∪An and |Ai| = |A1 ∪A2 ∪. . .∪An| for 1 ≤i ≤n,
so that Ai = A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An for 1 ≤i ≤n. In particular, this would give
A1 = A2 = · · · = An, and item (b) will give us a contradiction.
To what is left, let’s compute the number of elements of A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An with
the aid of the inclusion-exclusion principle:

elements.
⊓⊔
Another proof of the inclusion-exclusion principle can be given by using
characteristic functions of sets (cf. Deﬁnition 1.12). To this end, we shall need two
preliminary results on such functions.
Lemma 2.3 Let A be a nonempty set. If B and C are subsets of A, then:
(a) χB = χC ⇔B = C.
(b) χB∩C = χBχC.
(c) χBc = 1 −χB.
(d) χB∪C = χB + χC −χBχC.
Proof Exercise (see Problem 1).
⊓⊔
Proposition 2.4 Let A be a ﬁnite set and A1, A2, . . . , An be subsets of A. If χ, χj :

Aj in A, then
χ(x) = 1 −

Proof For x ∈A, we have

We now present two classical applications of the inclusion-exclusion principle.
For the ﬁrst one, we say that a permutation (a1, a2, . . . , an) of In is a derangement
if ai ̸= i for 1 ≤i ≤n. This is the same as saying that the function f : In →In,
such that f (i) = ai for 1 ≤i ≤n, has no ﬁxed points. The coming example
computes how many are these permutations of In (in this respect, see also Problem 6,
page 79).
Example 2.5 Given an integer n > 1, there are precisely
dn = n!

j=0

(2.4)
derangements of In.

2.1
The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
37
Proof Let Dn be the set of derangements of In and, for 1 ≤i ≤n, let Ci be the set
of those permutations (a1, . . . , an) of In for which ai = i. Letting Pn denote the set
of all permutations of In, we clearly have
Pn \ Dn = C1 ∪C2 ∪. . . ∪Cn.
Hence, the inclusion-exclusion principle gives

|Ci1 ∩. . . ∩Cik|.
(2.5)
Since dn = |Dn|, we have
|Pn \ Dn| = |Pn| −|Dn| = n! −dn.
On the other hand, since
(a1, . . . , an) ∈Ci1 ∩. . . ∩Cik ⇔ai1 = i1, . . . , aik = ik,
in order to count how many permutations (a1, . . . , an) of In belong to Ci1 ∩. . .∩Cik,
it sufﬁces to count how many are the permutations of In \ {i1, . . . , ik}. Since this is
a set of n −k elements, it follows that
|Ci1 ∩. . . ∩Cik| = |Pn−k| = (n −k)!.

|Fm,n \ Sm,n| = |Fm,n| −|Sm,n| = nm −sm,n,
where in the last equality we used the discussion in the last paragraph of Sect. 1.1.
On the other hand, for a given function f : A →B, we obviously have
f ∈Fi1 ∩. . . ∩Fik ⇔bi1, . . . , bik /∈Im (f );
in turn, this is equivalent to the fact that f can be seen as a function from A into
B \ {bi1, . . . , bik}. However, since |B \ {bi1, . . . , bik}| = n −k (and invoking once
more the discussion in the last paragraph of Sect. 1.1), we get

We shall reobtain the results of the two examples above, by other means, in
Chap. 3 (cf. Problem 7, page 91, and Problem 9, page 92).
Example 2.7 (Romania) Compute the number of ways of coloring the vertices of
a regular dodecagon using two colors, in such a way that no monochromatic set of
vertices is the set of vertices of a regular polygon.
Solution A regular polygon having its vertices among those of the dodecagon is
either an equilateral triangle, a square, a regular hexagon or the regular dodecagon
itself. Since alternating vertices of a regular hexagon form an equilateral triangle,
we conclude that it sufﬁces to avoid equilateral triangles and squares. Let red (R)
and blue (B) be the used colors.
There are four equilateral triangles whose vertices are among those of the
given regular dodecagon, and such equilateral triangles have pairwise disjoint sets
of vertices. Since each one of them can be colored in exactly six distinct and
non monochromatic ways, the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of the
dodecagon without monochromatic equilateral triangles equals 64 = 1296.
Let’s calculate how many of these 1296 colorings contain at least one monochro-
matic square. To this end assume, without loss of generality, that such a coloring
contains a red square. Each one of its vertices is a vertex of exactly one of the
four possible equilateral triangles. Since such a vertex is red, the other two vertices
of the corresponding equilateral triangle could be colored BB, BR or RB. By the
fundamental principle of counting, exactly 2 · 3 · 34 = 486 (2 colors, 3 squares and
3 possible colorings for the other two vertices of each one of the four equilateral
triangles) of the 1296 colorings without monochromatic equilateral triangles contain
a monochromatic square.
Let’s now compute how many of the 1296 colorings without monochromatic
equilateral triangles contain at least two monochromatic squares. We do this
considering two separate cases, according to whether the two monochromatic
squares have equal or different colors. For each equilateral triangle, exactly one
of its vertices is not a vertex of any of the two monochromatic squares. Assuming
(without loss of generality) them to be red, we conclude that there is exactly one
possible color (blue) for the third vertex. Assuming them to be one red and the other
one blue, we conclude that there are two possible colors (either red or blue) for the
third vertex. Since there are
3
2

= 3 ways of choosing two of the three squares, the
number of colorings with at least two monochromatic squares equals

(note that if both squares have the same color, then there are two possibilities:
they are both blue or both red; if they have different colors, there are also two
possibilities: BR ou RB).
Finally, let’s calculate how many of the 1296 colorings without monochro-
matic equilateral triangles have three monochromatic squares. The nonexistence of
monochromatic equilateral triangles forbids the three squares to have a single color.
Hence, there are six possible distinct colorings for their sets of vertices: BBR, BRB,
RBB, RRB, RBR and BRR.
Therefore, by the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of colorings we wish
to count is
1296 −486 + 102 −6 = 906.

10. Lucas’ problem1 aims at counting the number of ways in which n couples
can sit in 2n chairs around a circle, such that no wife sits beside her husband
and no two people of the same sex sit on adjacent chairs. The purpose of this
problem is to present I. Kaplansky’s solution to this problem. To this end, do
the following items:
(a) Conclude that there are 2(n!) ways of choosing the chairs of the hus-
bands. Once we are done with (a), conclude that the number of desired
conﬁgurations is equal to 2(n!)an, where an counts the number of ways of
distributing the wives in the n left chairs, in such a way that no wife sits
beside her husband.

(b) Label the chairs of the husbands, counterclockwisely, as h1, h2, . . . , hn,
and those to be occupied by the wives (in some allowed order) as 1, 2, . . . ,
n, with chair 1 situated between h1 and h2, chair 2 situated between h2 and
h3, and so on. For 1 ≤i ≤n, let wi denote the wife of hi, and A2i−1 (resp.
A2i) denote the set of ways of distributing the wives such that wi sits in
chair i −1 (resp. chair i. Here, chair 0 is the same as chair n). Conclude
that

and 1 seen as consecutive), show that Ai1 ∩Ai2 ∩. . . ∩Aik = ∅.
(d) If {i1 < i2 < . . . < ik} ⊂{1, 2, . . . , 2n} has no consecutive elements (also

Double Counting
Double counting is nothing but the bijective principle in action once again, albeit
under a different perspective. The central idea is that, if we count a certain number
of conﬁgurations in two different ways and without making mistakes, then the
two results thus obtained must coincide. Sometimes this naive approach generates
interesting conclusions.
The best way to master double counting is by looking at some examples, and we
start with one that allows us to reobtain an important result, already derived by other
means.

2.2
Double Counting

Example 2.8 If n and k are integers such that 0 ≤k ≤n, then every set with n
elements has exactly
n
k

subsets with k elements.
Proof Note ﬁrst that it sufﬁces to consider the case 1 ≤k ≤n.
Under this assumption, ﬁx a set A with n elements and consider the problem of
counting how many sequences of k terms, chosen from the elements of A, can be
formed. By Corollary 1.22, the answer is n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1).
On the other hand, by permuting the elements of each k-element subset of A we
generate k! different sequences of k terms; moreover, it is immediate to see that the
sequences we get this way are all sequences of k terms chosen from A, and they
are all distinct. Hence, if (as in the previous chapter) Cn
k denotes the number of k-
element subsets of A, we conclude that there are exactly k!Cn
k sequences of k terms,
all chosen from the elements of A.
Now, since n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1) and k!Cn
k are answers to the same counting
problem, we conclude that
k!Cn
k = n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1)
or, which is the same,
Cn
k = n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1)

⊓⊔
Yet concerning the previous example, a nontrivial difﬁculty in the implementa-
tion of the double counting argument relied in looking at both sides of the desired
equality as different ways of counting the number of conﬁgurations relative to a
single combinatorial situation. There is no general rule on how to ﬁnd out such a
counting problem; just experience and careful thinking will help. Therefore, let’s go
on and discuss another (and tougher) example.
Example 2.10 Let m and n be positive integers. Prove that

with the above sums ranging over all possible integer values of the indices j and k.
Proof Let A and B be disjoint sets, with |A| = m and |B| = n. Let’s calculate the
number of ordered pairs (X, Y), with X ⊂A and Y ⊂B ∪X such that |Y| = m.
If |X| = k, there are
m
k

ways of choosing X; for each of them, the disjointness
of A and B gives |B ∪X| = n + k, so that there are
n+k
m

ways of choosing Y.
Therefore, by successively applying the multiplicative and additive principles, we
conclude that the number of such ordered pairs is

k
m

.
We now choose Y ﬁrst. More precisely, we compute how many ordered pairs
(X, Y) satisfy the given conditions and are such that |Y ∩B| = j. There are
n
j

ways of choosing j elements from B to put in Y; once they are chosen, we are left
to choosing m −j elements for Y, which ought to be elements of A. Then, there
are
 m
m−j

=
m
j

ways of choosing these m −j elements of A, and the condition
Y ⊂B ∪X forces such elements to belong to X. Apart from these m −j elements,
the remaining elements of X can form an arbitrary subset of the set formed by
the remaining j elements of A, so that we can choose such a subset in exactly 2j
different ways. Hence, the number of pairs (X, Y) is given by

Finally, since both of the above countings solve the same problem, the only
possibility is to have the stated equality.
⊓⊔
The coming example illustrates how one can use double counting arguments to
get inequalities.
Example 2.11 (IMO) Let n and k be positive integers and S be a set of n points in
the plane satisfying the following conditions:
(a) no three points of S are collinear.
(b) For every point P ∈S, there are at least other k points of S equidistant from P.
Prove that k < 1
2 +
√
2n.
Proof Let
F = {(A, B, C); A, B, C ∈S and AB = AC}.
We shall count |F| in two different ways.
Firstly, for each A ∈S there are at least k points of S equidistant from A and
such points generate at least k(k −1) pairs (B, C) such that (A, B, C) ∈F. Since
there are n possible choices for A ∈S, we conclude that
|F| ≥nk(k −1).
Now, for ﬁxed B, C ∈S, we claim that there are at most two points A in S
such that (A, B, C) ∈F. Indeed, since any such A belongs to the perpendicular
bisector of BC, and condition (a) gives at most two of them. However, since there
are n(n −1) possible choices for (B, C), we conclude that
|F| ≤2n(n −1).
Thus,
nk(k −1) ≤2n(n −1)

We ﬁnish this section by showing how to use a double counting argument to

In particular, dk = k! k

Proof As in Example 2.5, let Pk denote the set of all permutations of Ik and let’s
count |Pk| in two different ways.
Firstly, Corollary 1.25 gives |Pk| = k!.
Secondly, for 0 ≤j ≤k, let Fj denote the subset of Pk formed by those
permutations of Ik having exactly j ﬁxed points. Then,
Pk = F0 ∪F1 ∪. . . ∪Fk;
however, since the union at the right hand side above is disjoint, we obtain
|Pk| = |F0| + |F1| + · · · + |Fk|.
(2.10)
Now, for f ∈Fj, we can choose its j ﬁxed points in exactly
k
j

ways; on the
other hand, the restriction of f to the subset of Ik formed by the other k −j points
clearly forms a derangement of Ik−j. Hence, the fundamental principle of counting
gives

2.3
Equivalence Relations and Counting
Let A be a ﬁxed nonempty set, and recall that a relation in A is a subset of the
cartesian product A × A.
3For another approach to this problem, see Problem 21, page 134.

More Counting Techniques
We say that a relation R in A is reﬂexive if aRa for every a ∈A; symmetric if,
whenever a, b ∈A, we have that aRb ⇒bRa; transitive if, whenever a, b, c ∈A,
we have that aRb and bRc imply aRc. Finally, an equivalence relation in A is
a relation R in A which is simultaneously reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive. In
Mathematics, equivalence relations are customarily denoted by ∼, instead of R (i.e.,
by writing a ∼b instead of aRb); from now on, we shall stick to this usage without
further comments.
Examples 2.14
(a) Let F be a partition of a nonempty set A. The relation ∼in A, deﬁned by
a ∼b ⇔∃B ∈F; a, b ∈B,
is of equivalence. We say that such an equivalence relation is the one induced
by the partition F.
(b) Let A and B be nonempty sets and f : A →B be a given function. Relation ∼
in A, deﬁned by
a ∼b ⇔f (a) = f (b)
is of equivalence. We say that such a relation is induced by f .
The following deﬁnition is central to all that follows.
Deﬁnition 2.15 Let A be a nonempty set and ∼be an equivalence relation in A.
For a ∈A, the equivalence class of a is the subset a of A deﬁned by
a = {x ∈A; x ∼a}.
(2.11)
If ∼is an equivalence relation in a nonempty set A and a ∈A, then the
equivalence class of a is clearly nonempty, for a ∈a. Our ﬁrst result analyses
the equivalence classes of a generic equivalence relation.
Proposition 2.16 Let ∼be an equivalence relation in a nonempty set A. For a, b ∈
A, one has
a ∼b ⇔a ∩b ̸= ∅⇔a = b.
In particular, the equivalence classes of ∼form a partition of A.
Proof We shall show that a ∼b ⇒a ∩b ̸= ∅⇒a = b ⇒a ∼b:
•
If a ∼b, then a ∈b and, hence, a ∈a ∩b; therefore, a ∩b ̸= ∅.
•
If c ∈a ∩b (i.e., if a ∩b ̸= ∅), then c ∼a and c ∼b; hence, the symmetry of ∼
guarantees that a ∼c and c ∼b and, thus, its transitivity implies a ∼b. We shall
now show that a ⊂b (the converse inclusion being totally analogous): if x ∈a,
then x ∼a; however, since a ∼b, it follows once more from the transitivity of
∼that x ∼b, i.e., x ∈b.

2.3
Equivalence Relations and Counting
51
•
If a = b, then a ∈a implies a ∈b. But this is the same as saying that a ∼b.
⊓⊔
If ∼is an equivalence relation in a nonempty set A, it follows immediately from
the previous proposition that the family A/ ∼, deﬁned by
A/ ∼= {a; a ∈A}
(2.12)
(i.e., the family of the equivalence classes of the elements of A with respect to ∼), is
a partition of A. Such a family is called the quotient set of A by ∼, and the function
π : A −→A/ ∼
a −→
a
(2.13)
is the projection function of A on A/ ∼.
Given an equivalence relation ∼in a nonempty set A, a subset B of A is said to
be a system of distinct representatives (we abbreviate SDR) for ∼if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) For all a, b ∈B, either a = b or a ̸∼b.
(b) For every a ∈A, there exists b ∈B such that a ∼b.
In words, a SDR for an equivalence relation ∼in A is a subset of A formed by
pairwise nonrelated elements such that every element of A is related to exactly one
of them. Yet in another way, if B is a SDR for the equivalence relation ∼in A, then
A/ ∼= {x; x ∈B}.
(2.14)
The following proposition provides an effective way of constructing SDR for
equivalence relations.
Proposition 2.17 Let ∼be an equivalence relation in a nonempty set A. If f :
A/ ∼→A is a function such that f (a) ∈a for every a ∈A, then Im (f ) is a SDR
for ∼.
Proof Let B = Im f . If a, b ∈B, say a = f (α) and b = f (β), with α, β ∈A,
then the hypothesis on f assures that a ∈α and b ∈β. If a ∼b, then, since α ∼a
and b ∼β, we have by transitivity that α ∼β; thus, α = β and, hence,
a = f (α) = f (β) = b.
In order to verify the validity of the second condition in the deﬁnition of a SDR,
take a ∈A and let b = f (a). Then b ∈Im (f ) and the deﬁnition of f gives b ∈a,
i.e., a ∼b.
⊓⊔

52

More Counting Techniques
In the notations of the previous proposition, we say that f is a choice function
for the equivalence relation ∼. In words, the role of f is to choose one element out
of each equivalence class in A/ ∼.
Concerning the role of equivalence relations in counting problems, we have
ﬁnally arrived at the result we are interested in.
Proposition 2.18 Let ∼be an equivalence relation in a ﬁnite nonempty set A. If
all of the equivalence classes of A with respect to ∼have the same number k of
elements, then there are exactly |A|/k distinct equivalence classes.
Proof If {a1, . . . , am} is a SDR with respect to ∼, then A = m
j=1 aj, a disjoint
union. Hence,
|A| =
m

j=1
|aj| =
m

k = km,
so that m = |A|/k.
⊓⊔
As a ﬁrst example of application of the previous proposition, we shall now
reobtain the formula for the number of k-element subsets of a given set A, of n
elements (the following reasoning is a slight variation of that in Example 2.8, the
major change being in the adopted viewpoint). To this end, let 1 ≤k ≤n and Sk(A)
be the set of sequences of k distinct terms, all belonging to A. We already know that
|Sk(A)| = n(n −1) . . . (n −k + 1) =
n!
(n −k)!.
Let ∼be deﬁned in Sk(A) by
(a1, . . . , ak) ∼(b1, . . . , bk) ⇔{a1, . . . , ak} = {b1, . . . , bk}.
(2.15)
It’s immediate to check that ∼is of equivalence, and such that the equivalence
class of a sequence (a1, . . . , ak) is the set of all of its permutations. Hence, such an
equivalence class has precisely k! elements, and Proposition 2.18 assures that the
number of distinct equivalence relations is equal to
|Sk(A)|
k!
=
n!
k!(n −k)! =
n
k

.
Finally, note that (2.15) allows us to identify the equivalence classes with the k-
element subsets of A, so that there are exactly
n
k

of such subsets.
Another interesting situation is the following: in the set S(A) of the permutations
of a ﬁnite nonempty set A, we deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼in the following
way:
(a1, . . . , an) ∼(b1, . . . , bn)

(2.16)
∃1 ≤k ≤n; bj =

In other words, (a1, . . . , an) ∼(b1, . . . , bn) means that, for some 1 ≤k ≤n, one
has
(b1, . . . , bn) = (ak+1, ak+2, . . . , an−1, an, a1, . . . , ak).
It’s immediate to verify that ∼is actually of equivalence in S(A). Moreover,
for each sequence (a1, . . . , an) ∈S(A), its equivalence class (a1, . . . , an) contains
exactly n sequences; more precisely,
(a1, . . . , an) = {(a1, a2 . . . , an−1, an), (a2, a3, . . . , an, a1)
(a3, . . . , an, a1, a2), . . . , (an, a1, a2, . . . , an−1)}.
With respect to the equivalence relation just described, the equivalence class of
a sequence (a1, . . . , an) is said to be the circular permutation of the sequence
(a1, . . . , an). In particular, it follows from the general discussion on equivalence
relations that all of the sequences
(a1, a2 . . . , an−1, an), (a2, a3, . . . , an, a1), . . . , (an, a1, a2, . . . , an−1)
deﬁne the same circular permutation.
With the concept of circular permutation at our disposal, we now have the
following result.
Proposition 2.19 The number of distinct circular permutations of a set of n
elements is (n −1)!.
Proof If A is a set having n elements, we wish to count the number of equivalence
classes of S(A) with respect to the equivalence relation just described. Since
|S(A)| = n! and each equivalence class has exactly n elements, it follows from
Proposition 2.18 that there are precisely n!
n = (n −1)! distinct equivalence classes
(i.e., circular permutations).
⊓⊔
For what comes next, we say that two sets A and B are incomparable with
respect to inclusion4 if A ̸⊂B and B ̸⊂A. The result below brings a deeper
application of the ideas of this section, and is due to the Hungarian mathematician
Béla Bollobás. Our discussion follows [25].
4This terminology comes from the fact that the inclusion relation is a partial order in the family of
all subsets of a given set. In this respect, see the discussion at Sect. 4.3.

If F is a family of subsets of In, pairwise incomparable
with respect to inclusion, then

≤1.
Proof Let P be the set of permutations (a1, . . . , an) of In such that, for some 1 ≤
k ≤n, we have {a1, . . . , ak} ∈F. Being a set of permutations of In, it is immediate
that |P| ≤n!.
We consider in P the relation ∼, given by
(a1, . . . , an) ∼(b1, . . . , bn) ⇔{a1, . . . , ak} = {b1, . . . , bk} ∈F,
for some integer 1 ≤k ≤n. We claim that ∼is of equivalence. Indeed, it is clear
that ∼is reﬂexive and symmetric. In order to show that it is transitive, take a third
permutation (c1, . . . , cn) in P and assume that {a1, . . . , ak} = {b1, . . . , bk} ∈F
and {b1, . . . , bl} = {c1, . . . , cl} ∈F, for some integers 1 ≤k, l ≤n. Without loss
of generality, we can also assume that k ≤l. However, if k < l, then
{a1, . . . , ak} = {b1, . . . , bk} ⊂{b1, . . . , bl} = {c1, . . . , cl} ∈F,
a strict inclusion; this would contradict the fact that the sets in F are pairwise
incomparable with respect to inclusion. Therefore, k = l and, thus,
{a1, . . . , ak} = {b1, . . . , bk} = {c1, . . . , ck} ∈F,
i.e., (a1, . . . , an) ∼(c1, . . . , cn).
We now ﬁx a permutation (a1, . . . , an) ∈P, with {a1, . . . , ak} = A ∈F. Then,
(b1, . . . , bn) ∼(a1, . . . , an) if and only if {b1, . . . , bk} = A, i.e., if and only if
(b1, . . . , bk) is a permutation of the elements of A (and, hence, (bk+1, . . . , bn) is a
permutation of the elements of In \ A); since we can permute the elements of A and
of In \A in exactly |A|! and (n−|A|)! ways, respectively, we conclude that there are
exactly |A|!(n −|A|)! permutations (b1, . . . , bn) which are equivalent to the ﬁxed
permutation (a1, . . . , an) ∈P. Yet in another way, if A is the set in F associated to
(a1, . . . , an) ∈P, then the equivalence class of (a1, . . . , an) in P contains exactly
|A|!(n −|A|)! permutations.
Finally, by Proposition 2.16, the quotient set P/ ∼of equivalence classes of
P with respect to ∼forms a partition of P. However, since distinct equivalence
classes are associated to distinct sets A ∈F and every set A ∈F gives rise to an
equivalence class, it follows that
n! ≥|P| =

which in turn is equivalent to the desired inequality.
⊓⊔
For our next example we ﬁrst need to recall some simple facts concerning the
notion of divisibility of integers. Further details can be found in Chap. 6.
Given a, b ∈Z, with b ̸= 0, we say that b divides a, or that a is a multiple of
b, if a
b is an integer. Letting a
b = c, this is the same as saying that a = bc, with
c ∈Z. For instance, 7 divides 28, for 28
7 = 4 ∈Z. If b divides a, we write b | a;
otherwise, we write b ∤a and say that b does not divide a. If a is not a multiple of
b, the division algorithm5 shows that there exist unique integers q and r such that
a = bq + r and 0 ≤r < |b|.
We now introduce a whole class of equivalence relations in Z, which will reveal
itself to be of paramount importance to the material of Chaps. 10–20.
For a given integer n > 1, we say that two integers a and b are congruent modulo
n if n divides a −b. If a and b are congruent modulo n, we write a ≡b (mod n);
otherwise, we write a ̸≡b (mod n). For instance, we have 1 ≡−5 (mod 3), since
3 | (1 −(−5)), but −3 ̸≡7 (mod 4), since 4 ∤(−3 −7). Note that if a = nq + r,
with 0 ≤r < n, then n | (a −r), so that a ≡r (mod n). Therefore, every integer is
congruent, modulo n, to precisely one of 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
Example 2.21 Let n > 1 be a given integer. The relation ∼, deﬁned in Z by
a ∼b ⇔a ≡b (mod n),
is an equivalence relation in Z, which is known as the relation of congruence
modulo n.
Proof Reﬂexivity of ∼follows from
a ∼a ⇔a ≡a (mod n) ⇔n | (a −a),
which is clearly true. On the other hand, since
a ∼b ⇔a ≡b (mod n) ⇔n | (a −b),
and n | (a −b) ⇔n | (b −a), we have that
a ∼b ⇒n | (b −a) ⇒n | (b −a)
⇒b ≡a (mod n) ⇒b ∼a.
5For a formal deﬁnition of an algorithm, see the footnote at page 116.

Finally, for the transitivity of ∼, if a ∼b and b ∼c, then n | (a −b) and
n | (b −c), i.e., a−b
n
and b−c
n
are both integers; hence, the number
a −c
n
= a −b
n
+ b −c
n
is also an integer, which in turn guarantees that n | (a −c). But this is the same as
saying that a ≡c (mod n), so that a ∼c.
⊓⊔
For the coming example, given an integer m > 1, a set A ⊂Im and another
integer 0 ≤r ≤m −1, we let A + r denote the set
A + r = {a + r (mod m); a ∈A}.
Thus,
A + r = {x + r; x ∈A and 1 ≤x ≤m −r}∪
∪{x + r −m; x ∈A and m −r < x ≤m}.
For instance, if m = 7, A = {1, 3, 5} and r = 4, then
A + r = {1 + 4, 3 + 4, 5 + 4 (mod 7)} = {5, 7, 2}.
Example 2.22 (Austrian-Polish) Let k and n be given natural numbers, such that
3 ∤k and 1 ≤k ≤3n. Prove that the set I3n has exactly 1

subsets of k elements,
such that the sum of its elements is a multiple of 3.
Solution Let F be the family of k-element subsets of I3n. Consider a relation ∼
in F be deﬁning A ∼B if and only if there exists an integer 0 ≤j ≤2 such
that B = A + j modulo 3. It is immediate to check (cf. Problem 2) that ∼is an
equivalence relation, and that the equivalence class of a subset A of In contains
exactly the three sets A, A + 1 and A + 2 (these last two modulo 3).
On the other hand, letting S = 
x∈A x, we obviously have

x∈A+1
x ≡S + k (mod 3) and

x∈A+2
x ≡S + 2k (mod 3).
However, since 3 ∤k, we conclude that the three numbers S, S + k and S + 2k are
pairwise incongruent modulo 3. But since every integer is congruent to precisely
one of the integers 0, 1 or 2, modulo 3, we conclude that exactly one of S, S + k
and S + 2k is divisible by 3. This is the same as saying that exactly one of the sets
A, A + 1 and A + 2 has sum of elements equal to a multiple of 3. Hence, there are
as many k-element subsets of I3n whose sum of elements is divisible by 3 as there
are equivalence classes of F with respect to ∼. But since each such equivalence
class contains three elements, Proposition 2.18 assures that the number of distinct
equivalence classes is precisely 1

1 (mod p).
6. (IMO shortlist) Given n ∈N, we say that a sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xn), with xj ∈

2.4
Counting with Metrics
In this section, we present a counting technique with a distinguished geometric
ﬂavor. To this end, we shall need the following important deﬁnition, which is
actually a concept pervasive to all of Mathematics.
Deﬁnition 2.23 If X is a nonempty set, a metric in X is a function d : X ×X →R
satisfying, for all x, y, z ∈X, the following conditions:
(a) d(x, y) = d(y, x).
(b) d(x, y) ≥0 and d(x, y) = 0 ⇔x = y.
(c) d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z).
The prototype of metric is the distance function in Euclidean space. More
precisely, letting E3 denote the three dimensional Euclidean space and d : E3 ×
E3 →R be given by
d(P, Q) = PQ, ∀P, Q ∈E3,
then conditions (a), (b) and (c) above are clearly satisﬁed, condition (c) following
from the triangle inequality.
Thanks to the geometric example of the previous paragraph, from now on we
shall refer ourselves to condition (c) of Deﬁnition 2.23 as the triangle inequality.

60

More Counting Techniques
Another piece of terminology borrowed from that example is isolated in the next
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.24 Let d be a metric in the nonempty set X. Given x ∈X and r > 0,
the ball8 of center x and radius r is the subset B(x; r) of X, given by
B(x; r) = {y ∈X; d(y, x) ≤r}.
Back to the former example of metric, given P ∈E3 and r > 0 we have
B(P; r) = {Q ∈E3; PQ ≤r}
= solid sphere of center P and radius r.
Thus, at least at a heuristic level, this example justiﬁes the geometric intuition
attached to the name ball.
In what concerns Combinatorics, our primary interest relies in metrics deﬁned
on ﬁnite nonempty sets. To understand why this is so, let us assume that X is such
a set and d is a metric on it. Further, suppose that x1, . . . , xk ∈X are such that the
union of the balls centered at those points and with some positive radius r cover X,
i.e., that
B(x1; r) ∪. . . ∪B(xk; r) = X.
(2.17)
If we have an upper bound on the number of elements of any ball of radius r in
X, say
|B(x; r)| ≤c(r), ∀x ∈X,
with c(r) > 0 depending only on r (and not on the chosen x ∈X), then (2.17)
gives us
|X| = |B(x1; r) ∪. . . ∪B(xk; r)|
≤|B(x1; r)| + · · · + |B(xk; r)|
≤k · c(r).
Therefore,
k ≥
1
c(r)|X|.
(2.18)
8The reader with previous acquaintance with the theory of Metric Spaces will notice that what we
call a ball is generally known in the literature as a closed ball. Nevertheless, in order to ease the
writing we will stick to this slightly different terminology. We believe that, as far as these notes are
concerned, this will be a harmless practice.

2.4
Counting with Metrics
61
Thus, an upper bound on the number of elements of any ball of radius r
automatically gives a lower bound on the number of balls of radius r needed to
cover X.
With such a general reasoning at our disposal, let us take a look at a ﬁrst relevant
example.
Example 2.25 Given n ∈N, let Sn be the set of sequences of n terms, all of which
equal to 0 or 1, i.e.,
Sn = {a = (a1, a2, . . . , an); ai = 0 or 1, ∀1 ≤i ≤n}.
Let d : Sn × Sn →R be the function given, for a = (a1, . . . , an) and b =
(b1, . . . , bn) in Sn, by
d(a, b) = #{1 ≤i ≤n; ai ̸= bi}.
Then, d is a metric on Sn, called the Hamming metric9 on Sn.
Proof We clearly have d(a, b) ≥0 and d(a, b) = 0 if and only if a = b. It is also
clear that d(a, b) = d(b, a). In order to verify the triangle inequality, note that if
a, b ∈Sn, then
d(a, b) =
n

In the notations of the previous example, given a ∈Sn and k ∈N, we have

= {b ∈Sn; ai ̸= bi for at most k indices 1 ≤i ≤n}.

B(xl; k) does not cover Sn. Hence, there exists at least one sequence x ∈Sn such
that x /∈B(xi; k), for 1 ≤i ≤l. But this is the same as saying that
d(x, xi) > k, ∀1 ≤i ≤l,
and the rest follows from the deﬁnition of the Hamming metric.
⊓⊔
Prior to presenting another relevant example, recall that, given sets X and Y, one
deﬁnes their symmetric difference as the set XY, given by
XY = (X ∪Y) \ (X ∩Y).
In words, XY is the set formed by the elements which belong to exactly one of the
sets X and Y.

2.4

63
It follows promptly from the deﬁnition that X∅= X and XY = YX;
moreover, the reader can easily verify that
XY = (X \ Y) ∪(Y \ X),
for all sets X and Y.
The following lemma gathers together other properties of the symmetric differ-
ence which will be of our interest.
Lemma 2.27 If X, Y and Z are any sets, then:
(a) XY = ∅⇔X = Y.
(b) (XY)Z = X(YZ).
(c) XY = Z ⇔X = YZ.
Proof
(a) Since we clearly have XX = ∅, it sufﬁces to show that XY = ∅⇒X = Y.
To this end, observe that XY = ∅⇒X ∪Y = X ∩Y and, hence,
X ⊂X ∪Y = X ∩Y ⊂Y;
similarly, Y ⊂X.
(b) It is not difﬁcult to verify that
(XY)Z = (X ∪Y ∪Z) \ ((X ∩Y) ∪(X ∩Z) ∪(Y ∩Z)),
and analogously to X(YZ). We leave as an exercise to the reader the task
of checking the details.
(c) Let us show one implication, the other being completely analogous. If XY =
Z, it follows from item (b) that
X = ∅X = (YY)X = Y(YX) = YZ.
⊓⊔
With the above results at our disposal, we can ﬁnally present another important
example of metric in a family of ﬁnite sets, known as the metric of symmetric
difference.
Example 2.28 If F is a nonempty family of ﬁnite sets, then the function d : F ×
F →R, given by d(X, Y) = |XY|, is a metric in F.
Proof Since XY = YX, we have
d(X, Y) = |XY| = |YX| = d(Y, X)

for all X, Y ∈F. It is also clear that d(X, Y) ≥0 and d(X, Y) = 0 if and only
if XY = ∅; however, by item (a) of the previous lemma, this last equality takes
place if and only if X = Y.
We are left to showing that d(X, Y) ≤d(X, Z) + d(Z, Y) for all X, Y, Z ∈F,
or, which is the same, that |XY| ≤|XZ| + |ZY|. To this end, since |A ∪B| ≤
|A| + |B| for ﬁnite sets A and B, it is enough that we establish the inclusion
XY ⊂(XZ) ∪(ZY).
In turn, such an inclusion follows at once from the equality
(XZ) ∪(ZY) = (X ∪Y ∪Z) \ (X ∩Y ∩Z),
whose proof we leave as an exercise to the reader.
⊓⊔
Fix m ∈N and consider the metric of symmetric difference in F = P(m), the
family of subsets of Im. If X ⊂Im is given, let us compute the number of subsets of
Im in the ball B(X; k), where k ≥0 is a given integer. To this end, start by noticing
that
Y ∈B(X; k) ⇔|XY| ≤k;
therefore, in order to count the number of elements in B(X; k), it sufﬁces to count
how many are the subsets Y ⊂Im for which |XY| ≤k. For a ﬁxed Z ⊂Im, item
(c) of Lemma 2.27 guarantees the existence of a single Y ⊂Im such that Z = XY.
Hence,
{Y ∈P(m); |XY| ≤k} = {Z ∈P(m); |Z| ≤k}.
Finally, since for each 0 ≤j ≤k there are exactly

For the coming example, let Pk(n) be the family of k-element subsets of In and
d be the metric of symmetric difference in Pk(n). For distinct X, Y ∈Pk(n), we
have
d(X, Y) = |XY| = |X ∪Y| −|X ∩Y|
= |X| + |Y| −2|X ∩Y|
= 2(k −|X ∩Y|),

Counting with Metrics

Example 2.29 (BMO—Adapted) Let n > 2 be a given integer and F be a maximal
family of 3-element subsets of In satisfying the following condition: for any A, B ∈
F, with A ̸= B, we have |A ∩B| ≤1. Prove that
|F| > 1
18(n2 −n).
Proof Let d be the metric of symmetric difference in P3(n). It follows from (2.21)
that, for X, Y ∈F,
|X ∩Y| ≤1 ⇔d(X, Y) ≥4.
We now claim that if F = {A1, . . . , Ak}, then
P3(n) = B(A1; 2) ∪. . . ∪B(Ak; 2).
(2.22)
Indeed, if this was not the case, then there would exist A ∈P3(n) \ (B(A1; 2) ∪
. . . ∪B(Ak; 2)), i.e., such that d(A; Ai) ≥4 for 1 ≤i ≤k. By what we did above,
this would be the same as having |A ∩Ai| ≤1 for 1 ≤i ≤k. In turn, this would
assure that F′ = {A, A1, . . . , Ak} would be a family strictly containing F and also
satisfying the stated conditions. This contradicts the maximality of F.
Thus, it follows from (2.22) that
n


= |P3(n)| = |B(A1; 2) ∪. . . ∪B(Ak; 2)|
≤|B(A1; 2)| + · · · + |B(Ak; 2)|.
(2.23)
Now, given A = {a, b, c} ∈P3(n), let us compute the number of sets in
B(A; 2) ⊂P3(n): recall that, for A′ ∈P3(n), the distance d(A′, A) is even;
therefore, (2.21) gives
d(A′, A) ≤2 ⇔d(A′, A) = 0 or 2
⇔A′ = A or |A′ ∩A| = 2
⇔A′ = {a, b, c}, {a, b, x}, {a, c, x} or {b, c, x},
for some x ∈In \ {a, b, c}. We then conclude that
|B(A; 2)| = 1 + 3(n −3) = 3n −8.
We ﬁnish by using (2.23) and the last computation above to obtain

BSBSBSBSBS, where B stands for big and S stands for small). For each of the

Chapter 3
Generating Functions
In this chapter we brieﬂy discuss the powerful method of generating functions, i.e.,
the use of power series in the analysis of counting problems that are inaccessible by
the more elementary techniques presented so far.
Unlike other approaches to this subject (e.g., that of the classic [41]), the material
collected here makes heavy use of the methods of Differential and Integral Calculus,
in the level of [3] or [8], for instance. Although working with convergent power
series apparently requires far more background than using formal power series, it
is actually much more complicated to rigorously justify the correctedness of some
algebraic manipulations with this last type of series. Furthermore, we believe that, in
a ﬁrst acquaintance with generating functions, the reader with some Calculus back-
ground feels much more comfortable in working in the realm of convergent power
series. Anyhow, for the reader’s convenience Sect. 3.2 brieﬂy reviews the basic facts
on the convergence of power series needed for our subsequent discussions.
For a comprehensive exposition on the uses of generating functions in Combi-
natorics, we refer the interested reader to the above mentioned wonderful book of
professor H. Wilf.

Generating Functions
Among all generating functions, one of the simplest ones is, in a certain sense,
that of the (sequence formed by the) nonnegative integers: 
n≥0 xn. As the reader
probably knows from earlier studies (cf. Section 7.4 of [8], for instance), such a
power series converges to
1
1−x when |x| < 1. Thus, for |x| < 1, we have
1
1 −x =

n≥0
xn,
(3.1)
and say that the series at the right hand side is a geometric series.
In order to illustrate the kind of use we have in mind for generating functions, we
consider in this section two preliminary examples. Their role is to give the reader an
easy glimpse on how the method works.
The ﬁrst example revisits Problem 7, page 49, and employs some elementary
facts on continuous functions, which can be reviewed in Chapter 8 of [8], for
instance.
Example 3.1 (TT) The set of natural numbers is partitioned into m inﬁnite and
nonconstant arithmetic progressions, of common differences d1, d2, . . . , dm. Prove
that
1
d1
+ 1
d2
+ · · · + 1
dm
= 1.
Proof Let f (x) = 
n≥1 xn be the generating function of the natural numbers.
Letting ai be the initial term of the arithmetic progression of common difference di,
the stated condition assures that, for |x| < 1, we have
f (x) =
m

i=1
(xai + xai+di + xai+2di + · · · ).
Hence, for |x| < 1, it follows from (3.1) (with xdi in place of x, in each series in the
sum at the right hand side above) that
x
1 −x =
m

i=1
xai
1 −xdi .
Multiplying both sides of this last equality by 1 −x and doing some algebra at the
right hand side, we get
x =
m

i=1
xai
1 + x + x2 + · · · + xdi−1 .
(3.2)

Introduction

Now, note that both sides of the equality above deﬁne continuous functions in the
closed interval [0, 1], and our reasoning so far assures that such functions coincide
in the half-open interval [0, 1). Therefore (and it is precisely here where we use the
basic theory of continuous functions), they coincide also for x = 1, and evaluation
of (3.2) at x = 1 gives
1 =
m

⊓⊔
Our next example uses generating functions to obtain a positional formula for the
n-th Fibonacci number.
Example 3.2 Let (Fn)n≥1 be the Fibonacci sequence and f (x) = 
n≥1 Fnxn be its
generating function. For the time being, assume that the series deﬁning f converges
on an open interval of the form (−r, r), for some real number r > 0 (we shall see,
in the paragraph following Proposition 3.7, that this is indeed the case). Then, we
can write
f (x) = F1x + F2x2 +

n≥3
Fnxn
= x + x2 +

n≥3
(Fn−1 + Fn−2)xn
= x + x2 + x

n≥3
Fn−1xn−1 + x2 
n≥3
Fn−2xn−2
= x + x2 + x(f (x) −F1x) + x2f (x)
= x + (x + x2)f (x),
thus getting
f (x) =
x
1 −x −x2
for x ∈(−r, r).
Now, writing 1−x −x2 = (1−αx)(1−βx), with α, β ∈R, we have α +β = 1,
αβ = −1 and
f (x) =
x
1 −x −x2 =
x
(1 −αx)(1 −βx).

By imposing, without loss of generality, that α > β, we get α = 1+

and β =

It is important to point out that the discussion at the beginning of this section
guarantees that the geometric series involved in the above computations converge
for every x ∈R for which |αx|, |βx| < 1, i.e., for |x| <

|α|. Hence, letting s =

alternative than to infer, from the last equality above, that

(3.4)
for every n ≥1.
Finally, the uniqueness result we hinted to above is indeed true, and will be
explicitly stated in Corollary 3.6. This validates the last step above and shows
that (3.4) does hold.

3.2
Power Series
In order to justify and extend arguments like those of the two examples of the
previous section to more general situations, we shall review in this section some
facts on the convergence of general real power series. Since a thorough exposition
of the theory of real power series belongs more properly to the realm of basic real
analysis, we have chosen to be somewhat sketchy, referring the interested reader
to Chapter 11 of [8] for a more detailed account of the theory. Later, in Chap. 21,
extensions to complex power series will be discussed and applied.
Let r > 0 be a real number. We say that a function f : (−r, r) →R admits the
(power series) expansion
f (x) =

n≥0
anxn
in the interval (−r, r), or that the power series 
n≥0 anxn converges to f in the
interval (−r, r), if
f (x) =
lim
m→+∞
m

n=0
anxn
for every x ∈(−r, r).
A relevant example is that of the geometric series (3.1). As a corollary we note
that, for a given α ̸= 0, we have
1
1 −αx =

n≥0
αnxn
(3.5)
when |x| <
1
|α|. Indeed, if |x| <
1
|α|, then |αx| < 1, so that it sufﬁces to apply (3.1)
to αx in place of x.

72
3
Generating Functions
We shall frequently need to combine the power series expansions of two given
functions to obtain that of another function, obtained from those by means of the
arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction or multiplication of functions. In this
respect, the very deﬁnition of convergence of power series assures that, if f (x) =

n≥0 anxn and g(x) = 
n≥0 bnxn along (−r, r), then
(f ± g)(x) =

n≥0
(an ± bn)xn
in (−r, r). Concerning multiplication, we have the following result.
Proposition 3.3 If the functions f, g : (−r, r) →R have power series expansions
f (x) = 
k≥0 akxk and g(x) = 
l≥0 blxl, then the function fg : (−r, r) →R
has power series expansion (fg)(x) = 
n≥0 cnxn, with
cn =

k+l=n
akbl =
n

k=0
akbn−k.
(3.6)
Thus, for |x| < 1 and letting ak = 1 for every k ≥0, we get from (3.1) that
1
(1 −x)2 =
1
1 −x ·
1
1 −x =
⎛

#
xn =

Moreover, such a reasoning can be easily generalized to give the power series
expansion for the function x →
1
(1−x)k , for |x| < 1 (cf. Problems 1 and 2, page 78).
For the purposes we have in mind, the main result on power series is the one
collected in the coming theorem.
Theorem 3.4 Let r > 0 be such that the power series 
n≥0 anxn converges at
every x ∈(−r, r). If f : (−r, r) →R is given by f (x) = 
n≥0 anxn, then f is
differentiable, with f ′(x) = 
n≥1 nanxn−1 for every x ∈(−r, r).
In words, the previous theorem guarantees that we can termwise differentiate a
convergent power series, obtaining, as result, the power series corresponding to the
derivative of the function deﬁned by the original series.

3.2
Power Series
73
Example 3.5 This example shows how to use the previous result to reobtain, for
|x| < 1, the power series expansion of the function x →
1
(1−x)2 . Since
1
1−x =

n≥0 xn for |x| < 1, differentiating both sides of such an equality we get
1
(1 −x)2 =

n≥1
nxn−1 =

n≥0
(n + 1)xn,
and this is also valid for x ∈(−1, 1).
A very important corollary of Theorem 3.4 is the uniqueness of the power series
representing a certain function.
Corollary 3.6 If f
: (−r, r) →R admits a power series representation in
the interval (−r, r), then f is inﬁnitely differentiable. Moreover, its power series
representation is unique and is given by
f (x) =

n≥0
anxn,
with an = 1
n!f (n)(0), where f (n)(0) denotes the value of the n-th derivative of f at
0.
Proof Firstly, note that f (0) = a0. Now, the previous theorem gives us f ′(x) =

n≥1 nanxn−1 in (−r, r); in particular, this gives f ′(0) = a1. Again by the former
result, f ′ is differentiable and we get f ′′(x) = 
n≥2 n(n −1)anxn−2, so that
f ′′(0) = 2a2. Proceeding inductively this way, we easily ﬁnish the proof.
⊓⊔
The actual importance of Theorem 3.4 will completely reveal itself only if we
have at our disposal some criterion which allows one to establish the convergence
of a given power series 
n≥0 anxn in some open interval centered at 0. For our
purposes, the coming result, which is a particular case of the comparison test for
series, will sufﬁce.
Proposition 3.7 Let (an)n≥0 be a sequence of real numbers. If there exist positive
reals c and M such that |an| ≤cMn for every n ≥0, then the power series

n≥0 anxn converges on the interval

−1
M , 1
M

.
Proof Since
|anxn| = |an||x|n ≤cMn|x|n = c|Mx|n
and (cf. (3.5)) the geometric series 
n≥0 |Mx|n converges when |x| <
1
M , the
comparison test for series assures that 
n≥0 anxn converges when |x| < 1
M .
⊓⊔
With the above proposition at hand, we are in position to complete the analysis
of Example 3.2. Indeed, letting (Fn)n≥1 denote the Fibonacci sequence, an easy
induction shows that Fn ≤2n for every n ≥1. Hence, by the previous result, the

74

corresponding generating function, 
n≥1 Fnxn, converges whenever x ∈

.
In turn, this assures that all computations made at that example are actually valid
whenever |x| < min

2. In particular, we can use Corollary 3.6 to
conclude, from (3.3), that (3.4) does hold.
As Problem 5 will show, generating functions can be used to solve more general
second order linear recurrence relations. Actually, when we have complex
numbers at our disposal, we will completely analyse a much more general version
of this result, in Chap. 21.
Example 3.8 As a relevant application of the previous proposition in conjunction
with Theorem 3.4, let us show that
ex =

n≥0
1
n!xn
(3.7)
for every x ∈R.
We ﬁrst claim that, given A > 0, there exist α > 0 and n0 ∈N such that
n! > αAn for every n > n0. Indeed, ﬁxed a natural number n0 > A we have, for
n > n0 also natural,
n! = n0! (n0 + 1) . . . (n −1)n



n−n0
> n0!An−n0 = n0!
An0 An.
It thus sufﬁces to take α = n0!
An0 .
Now, given A > 0, take α > 0 and n0 ∈N as above. Letting an = 1
n!, c = 1
α and
M = 1
A, we conclude that 0 < an < cMn for every natural number n > n0, and the
previous proposition assures that the power series

n≥0

n!xn =
n0

n=0
1
n!xn +

n>n0
1
n!xn
deﬁnes a function f : (−A, A) →R (note that 1
M = A).
However, since A > 0 was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that f (x) =

n≥0
1
n!xn is actually deﬁned in the whole real line R. Moreover, Theorem 3.4
guarantees that f is differentiable and such that
f ′(x) =

n≥1
n · 1
n!xn−1 =

n≥0

n!xn = f (x)
for every x ∈R. In turn, this gives
d

In turn, this means that g is constant in the interval (−1, 1). However, since g(0) =

More Examples
In this section, we look at some recursive problems through the eyes of generating
functions. Such examples were chosen with a twofold purpose: on the one hand, to
illustrate the diversity of situations to which the method developed in the previous
two sections can be applied; on the other, to work out some techniques which are
themselves applicable to other relevant settings.
Example 3.12 Compute, with the aid of generating functions, the number of
nonnegative integer solutions to the equation
a1 + a2 + · · · + ak = m,
where k and m are given natural numbers.
Solution Note that a1 + a2 + · · · + ak = m if and only if xa1xa2 . . . xak = xm.
Therefore, there are as many nonnegative integer solutions (a1, a2, . . . , ak) of the
given equation as there are ways of getting a summand xm in the product
f (x) = (1 + x + x2 + · · · )(1 + x + x2 + · · · ) . . . (1 + x + x2 + · · · )



k
(yet in another way, taking xa1 in the ﬁrst factor, xa2 in the second, . . . , xak in the
k-th factor, we get xm in the product). However, for |x| < 1 we have
f (x) =

where, in the last equality, we applied the result of Problem 2 of the previous section.
Hence, the answer to our problem is the coefﬁcient of xm in the above series, i.e.,
k+m−1
m

(in turn, note that this agrees with the result of Problem 9, page 29.
⊓⊔
The method of generating functions is particularly useful in the study of
sequences (an)n≥0 satisfying recurrence relations more general than those treated
in the previous section. This is the case, for instance, for the sequence (an)n≥0
such that a0 = 1, a1 = −1 and an = −an−1
n
+ 2an−2 for n ≥2, since the
coefﬁcients of the recurrence relation are not constant. In this case, the idea is to
consider the corresponding generating function, say f (x) = 
n≥0 anxn, and to
follow the sequence of steps delineated below:
I. To use the initial values and the satisﬁed recurrence relation to conclude that
the generating function converges on some interval of the form (−r, r), with
r > 0.
II. Again with the aid of the initial values and the given recurrence relation, to
perform appropriate operations with the series expansion of f in order to get a
closed form (i.e., a formula) for f (x).

3.3

81
III. To expand in power series the formula for f (x) obtained in the previous step.
IV. To use the uniqueness of power series representation, given by Corollary 3.6, to
conclude that an is equal to the coefﬁcient of xn in the power series expansion
of step III.
Note that the steps just described are precisely those which were followed in
Example 3.2, the ﬁrst having been concluded right after Proposition 3.7. We shall
run through them once more, this time to solve the next example.
Example 3.13 Let (an)n≥0 be the sequence given by a0 = 1, a1 = −1 and
an = −an−1
n
+ 2an−2,
for every n ≥2. Compute an as a function of n.
Solution Let f (x) = 
n≥0 anxn be the generating function corresponding to the
given sequence.
Step I:
we shall try to apply the comparison test for power series, as given by
Proposition 3.7. More precisely, assuming that |an−2| ≤αn−2 and |an−1| ≤
αn−1, it comes from the triangle inequality, together with the given recurrence
relation, that
|an| ≤|an−1|
n
+ 2|an−2| ≤αn−1
n
+ 2αn−2.
Therefore, we shall have |an| ≤αn provided αn−1
n
+ 2αn−2 ≤αn, or, which is
the same,
α
n + 2 ≤α2.
Since this last inequality is true for α = 2 and every n ≥2, and since |a0| ≤20
and |a1| ≤21, it follows by induction that |an| ≤2n for every n ≥1. Hence,
Proposition 3.7 guarantees that f is deﬁned and is differentiable in the open
interval

.
Step II:
writing the given recurrence relation as nan = −an−1+2nan−2 for n ≥2,
we have

= a1 + a0 −f (x) + 2x(f ′(x) + 2f (x)).
However, since a1 + a0 = 0, we get f ′(x) = (4x −1)f (x) + 2xf ′(x) or, yet,
(2x −1)f ′(x) = −(4x −1)f (x).
In order to integrate (i.e., to ﬁnd the solutions of) the above differential equation,
note ﬁrst that f is positive in some interval (−r, r), for some 0 < r ≤1
2 (this
comes from the fact that f (0) = a0 = 1 > 0 and f , being differentiable, is
continuous, hence has the same sign as f (0) in a suitable neighborhood of 0).
Thus, for |x| < r we can write
f ′(x)
f (x) = −4x −1
2x −1 = −2 −

2x −1

⊓⊔
In order to apply the circle of ideas discussed so far to counting problems of
recursive character, apart from the four steps previously listed one has to execute a
further one, namely: given a combinatorial problem in which one wants to compute,
as a function of n ∈N, the total number an of possible conﬁgurations, one has
to compute the initial values an and to get a recurrence relation satisﬁed by the
sequence (an)n≥1. Let us carefully examine a relevant example.
Example 3.14 Compute, as a function of n ≥3, the number of distinct ways
of partitioning a convex n-gon into triangles, by drawing diagonals which do not
intersect in the interior of the polygon.
Solution Letting an be the number of partitions we wish to compute, it is clear that
a3 = 1. To obtain a recurrence relation valid for n ≥4, label the vertices of the
n-gon as A1, A2, . . . , An, consecutively and in the counterclockwise sense. There
are two possibilities:
(i) No diagonal departs from A1: hence, diagonal A2An must be drawn, so that we
are left to partitioning the convex (n −1)-gon A2A3 . . . An, with no diagonals
intersecting in its interior. The number of such partitions is, of course, an−1.
(ii) Diagonal A1Ak is drawn, for some 3 ≤k ≤n −1, but no diagonal A1Aj,
with j < k, is drawn: then, the partition of A1A2 . . . An induces partitions with
the stated property in the convex polygons A1A2 . . . Ak and A1AkAk+1 . . . An;
moreover, in the partition of A1A2 . . . Ak, no diagonal departs from A1.

84
3
Generating Functions
Conversely, given any partition of A1A2 . . . An with no diagonals intersecting in
its interior but some diagonal departing from A1, there exists a unique 3 ≤k ≤n−1
such that the partition under consideration comes from exactly one pair of partitions
of A1A2 . . . Ak and A1AkAk+1 . . . An as in the previous paragraph.
Now, if k = 3, there is exactly 1 way of partitioning A1A2A3; if 3 < k ≤
n −1, then arguing as in item (i) we conclude that there are exactly ak−1 ways
of partitioning A1A2 . . . Ak with no diagonal departing from A1. A simple way of
unifying these possibilities is to set a2 = 1, and we shall make this convention
henceforth.
Since there are an−k+2 ways of partitioning A1AkAk+1 . . . An as desired,
success applications of the multiplicative and additive principles give exactly
n−1
k=3 ak−1an−k+2 partitions of type (ii) for A1A2 . . . An.
Finally, taking both cases above into account (and recalling that a2 = 2), we
obtain the following recurrence relation for an, with n ≥4:
an = an−1 +
n−1

k=3
ak−1an−k+2
=
n

k=3
ak−1an−k+2
=
n−1

k=2
akan−k+1.
For what is to come, it is worth noting that the last expression above also makes
sense for n = 3, and that if we set a1 = 0 we can write it as
an =
n

k=1
akan−k+1, ∀n ≥3.
(3.14)
As far as we know, there is no simple way to establish the convergence, in some
open interval centered at 0, of the generating function 
n≥1 anxn corresponding
to the sequence (an)n≥1. Nevertheless, it is not difﬁcult for the reader to convince
himself/herself that the fulﬁllment of this step is unnecessary if we obtain, in the
end, a positional formula for an for which 
n≥1 anxn does converge in some open
interval centered at 0. We shall have more to say on this in a little while.
Back to the analysis of (3.14), note that the right hand side pretty much resembles
formula (3.6) for the coefﬁcients of the product of two convergent power series.
Therefore, setting f (x) = 
n≥1 anxn, we are led to compute f (x)2:
f (x)2 =

f (x) −x2).
Putting g(x) = 
n≥0 an+2xn, we get f (x) = x2g(x), and it follows from the
equality above that
x4g(x)2 = x(x2g(x) −x2) = x3(g(x) −1),
i.e., xg(x)2 −g(x) + 1 = 0. Thus,
g(x) = 1 ±

therefore, for the square roots above to represent real numbers we may assume—by
diminishing r, if necessary—that r < 1

At this point, rigorously speaking we do not know whether or not the above
formula does solve the problem under consideration, for, in order to obtain
it, we assumed the convergence of the power series 
n≥1 anxn in some open
interval centered at 0. Yet in another way, since we cannot guarantee a priori the
convergence of 
n≥1 anxn in some interval of the form (−r, r), with r > 0, the
whole process above is nothing but a heuristic reasoning that made us infer that
Cn−2 is, most likely, the correct value for an. Nevertheless, in order to conclude it
sufﬁces to show that, letting a1 = 0, a2 = 1 and an = Cn−2 for n ≥3, we have
an = n
k=1 akan−k+1 for every n ≥3.
For what is left to do, let us start by showing that the power series 

and reverting the previous steps, we conclude that

f (x) =

The proof of the second result we shall need is considerably more reﬁned than
those of the other Calculus results used so far. Therefore, we shall limit ourselves
to state it, referring the interested reader to Theorem 8.2 of [33] or (for a guided
approach) to problem 7 of Section 11.3 of [8].

We can ﬁnally present the promised example. Apart from some details, we follow

Let an count a certain number of conﬁgurations in terms of n ∈N. Up to
this point, we have tried to explicitly compute an with the aid of the ordinary
generating function 
n≥0 anxn of the sequence (an)n≥0. Nevertheless, there are
some instances in which is more adequate to invoke the exponential generating
function of (an)n≥0, i.e., the power series

n≥0
an
n! xn.
The remaining problems present a few such situations.
7. As in Example 2.5, let dn denote the number of distinct derangements of In.
The purpose of this problem is to use the exponential generating functions

n≥2

n! xn to compute dn as a function of n. To this end, do the following
items:
(a) Given integers n ≥3 and 1 ≤k ≤n −1, let (a1, . . . , an) be a derangement
of {1, 2, . . . , n} for which an = k.
i. If ak = n, prove that there are exactly dn−2 such permutations.
ii. If ak ̸= n, prove that there are exactly dn−1 such permutations.
(b) Conclude from (a) that dn = (n −1)(dn−1 + dn−2) for n ≥3.
(c) Imposing that dk ≤k!αk for every k < n and some α > 0, show that dn ≤
n!αn if α ≥2. Then, conclude that the series 

(h) Finally, compute dn as a function of n with the aid of (g) and Corollary 3.6.
In the previous problem, the convenience of the use of the exponential
generating function of (dn)n≥2 was mostly due (cf. item (c)) to the fact that

n≥2
dn
n! xn converges at some interval centered at 0, whereas 
n≥2 dnxn does
not. Nevertheless, in the coming two problems, the involved combinatorics will
compel us to use exponential, instead of ordinary, generating functions.

8. We want to compute, in terms of n ∈N, the number sn of sequences of n terms,
all of which equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3 and having an even number of 0’s. To this end,

(a) Show that
sn =

following items:
(a) Show that the number of surjections f : A →B is equal to the number of
ways of distributing m distinct objects among n distinct boxes, in such a way
that no box remains empty.
(b) Conclude that the number of surjections f : A →B is given by

the above sum extending over all n-tuples (a1, . . . , an) of positive integers

Chapter 4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
Generally speaking, Combinatorics deals with two different kinds of problems:
those in which we want to count the number of distinct ways of making a certain
choice and those in which we want to make sure that some conﬁguration does
appear. In order to solve a problem of the ﬁrst kind above, we employ, among
others, the counting techniques discussed in the previous chapters. For the second
kind of problem, up to this moment we have not developed any idea that could be
systematically used. It is our purpose in this chapter to remedy this state of things. To
this end, we start by discussing the famous pigeonhole’s principle of Dirichlet, along
with several interesting examples. Then we move on to some applications of the
principle of mathematical induction to the existence of conﬁgurations. The chapter
continues with the study of partial order relations, exploring Mirsky’s theorem on
the relation between chains and anti-chains. We close the chapter by explaining how,
in some situations, the search for an adequate invariant or a semi-invariant can give
the ﬁnal outcome of certain seemingly random algorithms.
4.1
Pigeonhole’s Principle
In its simplest version, pigeonhole’s principle, also known as Dirichlet’s princi-
ple,1 can be stated as follows.
Proposition 4.1 (Pigeonhole’s Principle I) If we distribute n pigeons into n −1
cages (the pigeonholes), then at least one cage will necessarily contain at least two
pigeons.
1After the German mathematician of the nineteenth century Gustav L. Dirichlet. Actually, we
shall have to wait until Sect. 7.2 (cf. Lemma 7.7) to appreciate the original problem that motivated
Dirichlet to introduce the pigeonhole principle.

Existence of Conﬁgurations
Proof By contraposition, if each one of the n −1 cages was to contain at most one
pigeon, then we would have at most n −1 pigeons.
⊓⊔
As naive as it seems, the pigeonhole principle allows us to establish astonishing
consequences, as shown by the coming examples. In all that follows, we shall always
assume that the relation of getting acquainted to someone else is symmetric, i.e., if
A knows B, then B also knows A.
Example 4.2 There are n guests in a party. Show that we can always ﬁnd two of
them who, within the party, are acquainted with the same number of people.
Proof Firstly, note that each of the n guests is acquainted with at least 0 and at most
n −1 other ones within the party. Therefore, there are two cases to consider:
(i) Each guest knows at least one other person in the party: take n −1 rooms,
numbered from 1 to n −1, and put in room i all of the guests (if any) who
know exactly i other guests. Since we have n −1 rooms (the pigeonholes)
and n guests (the pigeons), Dirichlet’s principle assures that at least one room
will contain at least two people. By the way we have allocated the guests in
the rooms, these two guests know, within the party, the same number of other
people.
(ii) There exists at least one “guest” who, actually, has no acquaintances within the
party: then, no guest knows all of the other n −1 people, so that, in this case,
we can number the rooms from 0 to n −2 and reason as in (i). Once more,
pigeonhole’s principle guarantees that at least one of the rooms will contain at
least two people. Also as in (i), these two people know, within the party, the
same number of other people.
⊓⊔
Example 4.3 (IMO Shortlist) Each subset of the set {1, 2, . . . , 10} is painted with
one, our of n possible colors. Find the greatest possible value of n for which one
can always ﬁnd two distinct and nonempty sets A, B ⊂{1, 2, . . . , 10}, such that A,
B and A ∪B are all painted with the same color.
Solution Let X = {1, 2, . . . , 10}. Given ten colors C1, C2, . . ., C10, let us paint the
k-element subsets of X with color Ck, for 1 ≤k ≤10. This way, given two distinct
and nonempty subsets A and B of X, there are two possibilities: either A and B
have different numbers of elements, and hence were painted with different colors,
or A and B have the same number of elements; in this second case, A ∪B has more
elements than A and B, and thus was painted with a color different from that of A
and B. Therefore, we conclude that n ≤9.
Now, take only nine colors, and let Ai = {1, . . . , i} for 1 ≤i ≤10. Since
A1 ⊂A2 ⊂· · · ⊂A10
is a chain of ten distinct and nonempty subsets of X (the pigeons) but we have
only nine colors (the pigeonholes), Dirichlet’s principle assures the existence of

4.1
Pigeonhole’s Principle
97
indices 1 ≤i < j ≤10 such that Ai and Aj are painted with a single color. Since
Ai ∪Aj = Aj, it sufﬁces to let Ai = A and Aj = B to fulﬁll the stated conditions.
Thus, the largest possible value of n is 9.
⊓⊔
There are several interesting generalizations of the pigeonhole principle, and the
coming result collects the one who is probably the most important of them. For what
is to come, recall (cf. the paragraph preceding Problem 7, page 41) that the integer
part of a real number x, denoted ⌊x⌋, is the greatest integer which is less than or
equal to x. Thus, if ⌊x⌋= n ∈Z, then n ≤x < n + 1. It is frequently useful to
write down such inequalities as
⌊x⌋≤x < ⌊x⌋+ 1.
(4.1)
Proposition 4.4 (Pigeonhole’s Principle II) If n pigeons are distributed among k
different cages, then at least one cage will contain at least

n−1
k

+ 1 pigeons.
Proof Arguing once more by contraposition, let us suppose that each of the k cages

and it sufﬁces to note that, by the left inequality in (4.1),

⊓⊔
Let us examine a few other examples.
Example 4.5 Prove that, in any group of twenty people, at least three of them were
born in the same day of the week.
Proof Let the twenty people be the pigeons and the 7 days of the week be the cages.
Then, associate a person to a day of the week if he/she was born in that day. The
second version of the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least one cage will
contain at least

20−1


+ 1 = 3 people. Thus, these three people were born in the
same day of the week.
⊓⊔
Example 4.6 (Leningrad2) Each 1 × 1 square of a 5 × 41 chessboard is painted
either red or blue. Prove that it is possible to choose three lines and three columns
of the chessboard so that the nine 1×1 squares into which they intersect are painted
with the same color.
Proof Since we have used only two colors, the second version of the pigeonhole
principle implies that, in each column (of ﬁve 1 × 1 squares), one of the two colors
must occur at least ⌊5−1
2 ⌋+ 1 = 3 times. Call such a color dominant and, for each
2Former name of the Russian city of Saint Petersburg.

98
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
of the 41 columns, take note of its dominant color. Since one out of the two colors
dominates in each of the 41 columns, by invoking once more the second version of
the pigeonhole principle we conclude that one of the two colors is the dominant one
in at least ⌊41−1
2 ⌋+ 1 = 21 columns. Assume, without loss of generality, that such
a color is red, and call a column as red if red is its dominant color. Then, choose 21
red columns and, in each of them, choose three 1 × 1 red squares.
Notice that there are exactly
5
2

= 10 possible ways of choosing three of the
ﬁve 1 × 1 squares of each column. Therefore, out of the 21 red columns (and once
again from the second version of the pigeonhole principle), the three 1 × 1 chosen
red squares occupy exactly the same positions in at least

21−1
10

+ 1 = 3 columns.
In other words, we have at least three columns having 1 × 1 red squares in the
same set of three lines, and this is exactly what we were asked to prove.
⊓⊔
The next example uses an obvious generalization of the pigeonhole principle
for the case in which we have a ﬁnite number of cages and an inﬁnite number of
pigeons.
Example 4.7 (Bosnia) A set A of natural numbers is said to be good if, for some
n ∈N, the equation x −y = n has inﬁnitely many solutions (x, y) with x, y ∈A.
If N = A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪A100, prove that at least one of the sets Ai is good.
Proof By the ﬁrst version of Dirichlet’s principle, out of each set of 101 natural
numbers (the pigeons), at least two will belong to a single one of the 100 sets A1,
A2, . . . , A100 (the cages). In particular, for each k ∈N, at least two of the 101 natural
numbers 101(k −1) + 1, 101(k −1) + 2, . . . , 101k, which we shall call xk and yk,
belong to a single one of the 100 sets A1, A2, . . . , A100.
Assume, without loss of generality, that xk > yk for each k. This way, we
obtain inﬁnitely many pairs x1 > y1, x2 > y2, . . . of natural numbers satisfying
the following conditions:
(i) the two numbers in each pair are in one of the sets A1, A2, . . . , A100;
(ii) 1 ≤xk −yk ≤100 for each k ≥1;
(iii) i > j ⇒xi > yi > xj > yj.
Looking at the integers k ≥1 as the pigeons and at the 100 sets A1, A2, . . . , A100
as the cages, we conclude (by the obvious generalization of the pigeonhole principle
alluded to above) that there exist an index 1 ≤m ≤100 and an inﬁnite set B ⊂N
such that
i ∈B ⇒xi, yi ∈Am.
We claim that Am is a good set. Indeed, since xi −yi ∈{1, 2, 3, . . . , 100} for
each i ∈B, a further application of the obvious generalization of the pigeonhole
principle guarantees the existence of an integer 1 ≤n ≤100 and an inﬁnite set
C ⊂B such that
i ∈C ⇒xi −yi = n.

4.1
Pigeonhole’s Principle
99
However, since i ∈C ⇒xi, yi ∈Am, we conclude from (iii) that the equation
x −y = n admits inﬁnitely many solutions in Am.
⊓⊔
As our next application of Dirichlet’s principle, we shall prove a particular case
of a famous result of the Hungarian mathematicians Paul Erdös and Esther Szekeres
(cf. [15]), which is known in mathematical literature as Erdös-Szekeres theorem
(for another proof of it, see Sect. 4.3).
Example 4.8 (Erdös-Szekeres) Out of any sequence of n2 +1 distinct real numbers,
one can always ﬁnd a monotone subsequence of at least n + 1 terms.
Proof Let A = {x1, x2, . . . , xn2+1} be the set whose elements are the n2 + 1
terms of the given sequence, and assume that the given sequence does not possess
any increasing subsequence with at least n + 1 terms. Then, every increasing
subsequence starting at a certain x ∈A has at most n terms. Deﬁne
f : A →{1, 2, . . . , n}
by letting f (x) = size of the largest increasing subsequence of the given sequence,
starting at x. Since A has n2 + 1 elements, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that
we should have at least
((n2 + 1) −1
n
)
+ 1 = n + 1
elements of A with the same image, say xi1, xi2, . . . , xin+1, with i1 < i2 < · · · <
in+1. If xij < xil for some 1 ≤j < l ≤n + 1, we would have f (xij ) > f (xil), for
we could enlarge an increasing sequence starting at xil by placing xij before it. But
since f (xij ) > f (xil) is impossible, we conclude that
xi1 > xi2 > · · · > xin+1.
Thus, we have found a decreasing subsequence of n + 1 terms.
⊓⊔
We end this section by presenting four additional examples which illustrate the
wide versatility of applications of Dirichlet’s principle.

implies x1 = x2 and y1 = y2, we conclude, with the aid of the fundamental principle

being m(1 +

A belongs to I1, there is nothing left to do. Otherwise, there will be left m2 +2m−1
intervals to contain all m2 + 2m elements of A, and the Dirichlet principle assures
that at least one of these intervals, say Ik, contains at least two elements of A, say
x1 + y1

Finally, noticing that |x2 −x1|, |y2 −y1| ≤m, we conclude that it sufﬁces to let

⊓⊔
The next example uses the existence part of the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic (Theorem 6.43), together with the notation of congruence modulo 2
(cf. Example 2.21).
Example 4.10 (IMO) Let A be a set of 1985 positive integers, none of which has
a prime divisor larger than 26. Show that it is possible to ﬁnd four elements of A
whose product is a fourth perfect power.
Proof The given conditions assure that every x
∈
A is of the form x
=
2α1x3α2x . . . 23α9x, with α1, α2, . . . , α9 ∈Z+. Modulo 2, the number of distinct
9-tuples (α1, . . . , α9) is equal to 29 = 512 (for each exponent αix is either odd or
even). Since 1985 > 512, pigeonhole’s principle assures that we can choose x1, y1 ∈
A such that αix1 ≡αiy1(mod 2) for 1 ≤i ≤9. Hence, αix1 + αiy1 ≡0(mod 2) for
1 ≤i ≤9, so that x1y1 = z2
1, for some z1 ∈N. Since 1985 −2 > 512, by
invoking Dirichlet’s principle once more, we can choose x2, y2 ∈A \ {x1, y1} such
that x2y2 = z2
2, for some z2 ∈N. Continuing this way, we obtain pairwise distinct
elements x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , x513, y513 ∈A, with xjyj = z2
j for some zj ∈N and
every 1 ≤i ≤513.
Now, since the prime factorisations of z1, z2, . . . , z513 also contain only primes
less than 26 and 513 > 512, an additional application of the pigeonhole principle
guarantees the existence of indices 1 ≤k < l ≤513 such that zkzl = w2, for some
w ∈N. Hence,
xkykxlyl = z2
kz2
l = (zkzl)2 = (w2)2 = w4.

4.1
Pigeonhole’s Principle
101
Proof Firstly, if (a1, a2, . . . , an) is one of the kn sequences of integers satisfying
0 ≤ai ≤k −1 for 1 ≤i ≤n, then Cauchy’s inequality (cf. Section 5.2 of [8], for

Now, subdivide interval [0, (k −1)√n] into kn −1 disjoint subintervals,
each of which having length
(k−1)√n
kn−1 . Since there exist kn distinct sequences
(a1, a2, . . . , an) of integers, pigeonhole’s principle guarantees that at least two of
such sequences, say (b1, b2, . . . , bn) and (c1, c2, . . . , cn), are such that both of the
sums n

and it sufﬁces to let ai = bi −ci for 1 ≤i ≤n.
⊓⊔
Our ﬁnal example is a problem with two parts, in which only the easiest one
makes use of Dirichlet’s principle. Nevertheless, insight from such a use gives a
valuable clue for an effective approach to the second part.
Example 4.12 (EKMC) Let k ≥3 and n be integers such that n >
k
3

. Prove that if
ai, bi, ci (1 ≤i ≤n) are 3n distinct real numbers, then one can ﬁnd at least k + 1
distinct numbers among the 3n sums ai + bi, ai + ci, bi + ci. Show also that this
claim is not necessarily true if n =
k
3

.
Proof By contradiction, assume that we have at most k distinct numbers among the
3n sums ai + bi, ai + ci, bi + ci, say x1, x2, . . . , xk.
Since ai + bi, ai + ci and bi + ci are pairwise distinct,
k
3

is the number of
3-element subsets of {x1, x2, . . . , xk} and n >
k
3

, we conclude that there exist
1 ≤i < j ≤n for which
{ai + bi, ai + ci, bi + ci} = {aj + bj, aj + cj, bj + cj}.
But it is not difﬁcult to verify that such an equality would imply that at least one
element of {ai, bi, ci} would be equal to at least one element of {aj, bj, cj}, which
is an absurd.
For a counterexample when n =
k
3

, we want to have only k distinct numbers
among the 3n numbers ai + bi, ai + ci, bi + ci, even though the 3n numbers ai,
bi, ci are still pairwise distinct. To this end, ﬁrst note that, by arbitrarily choosing k

102

Existence of Conﬁgurations
distinct real numbers x1, x2, . . . , xk, we can form n =
k
3

subsets of {x1, x2, . . . , xk},
of three elements each, and choose an arbitrary bijection between the sets

ai + bi, ai + ci, bi + ci; 1 ≤i ≤n =


and
{xr + xs + xt; 1 ≤r < s < t ≤k}.
Once we have done that, we would have, for 1 ≤i < j ≤n,
ai + bi = xαi, ai + ci = xβi, bi + ci = xγi
and
aj + bj = xαj , aj + cj = xβj , bj + cj = xγj ,
where 1 ≤αi, αj, βi, βj, γi, γj ≤k are such that αi, βi, γi are pairwise distinct,
the same happening with αj, βj, γj.
Facing each of the two 3-tuples of equalities above as a linear system of
equations, we can compute ai, bi, ci (resp. aj, bj, cj) in terms of xαi, xβi, xγi (resp.
xαj , xβj , xγj ), getting three distinct numbers in each case (for xαi, xβi, xγi—resp.
xαj , xβj , xγj —are pairwise distinct).
Therefore, the central point to the construction of a counterexample is that we
ought to have
{ai, bi, ci} ∩{aj, bj, cj} = ∅
or, which is the same,
{xαi + xβi −xγi, xαi + xγi −xβi, xβi + xγi −xαi}
and
{xαj + xβj −xγj , xαj + xγj −xβj , xβj + xγj −xαj }
to be disjoint.
It is thus enough to show that it is possible to choose x1, x2, . . . , xk in such a way
that
xr + xs −xt ̸= xu + xv −xw

4.1
Pigeonhole’s Principle
103
whenever r, s, t and u, v, w are two 3-tuples of distinct integers of the interval [1, k],
with {r, s, t} ̸= {u, v, w}. Since we may have t ∈{u, v} or w ∈{r, s}, a possible
choice is to take
x1 = 21, x2 = 23, x3 = 25, . . . , xk = 22k−1.
The uniqueness of binary representation of naturals (cf. Section 4.1 of [8], for
instance) assures that the above conditions will be satisﬁed, even if we have
t ∈{u, v} or w ∈{r, s}.

4.2
Induction and Existence of Conﬁgurations
In this section, we examine some examples that illustrate how mathematical
induction can be used, in combinatorial situations, to establish the existence of
conﬁgurations possessing certain properties. We assume from the reader a thorough
acquaintance with the principle of induction, referring to Section 4.1 of [8] for
an elementary exposition of the necessary background. In particular, most often
we shall not write formal inductive proofs, i.e., sometimes initial cases will not be
checked and induction hypotheses will not be explicitly stated.
Example 4.13 (Germany) Given n ∈N, prove that one can assemble a square of
side length 2n by using one square piece of side length 1 and several L-triminoes,
i.e., pieces of the shape below, where each small square has side length equal to 1:
Proof We shall use induction on n to show that each square of side length 2n can be
assembled as required, with the square piece of side length 1 occupying a corner of
the 2n × 2n square.
For n = 1, the assembling is immediate, as shown in the ﬁgure below:
By induction hypothesis, assume that every square of side length 2k can be
assembled as prescribed. For the inductive step, take a 2k+1 × 2k+1 square and
divide it into four squares of side length 2k, as shown in the ﬁgure below. Then,
place an L-trimino in the center of the larger square, so that it occupies one square

106
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
of side length 1 in three of the four squares of side length 2k. Finally, place the 1×1
square piece in the corner of the 2k+1 × 2k+1 square that belongs to the square of
side length 2k which was not intersected by the L-trimino already placed.
2k+1
2k+1
The placement of these two pieces has the effect of letting each of the four
squares of side length 2k with exactly one corner occupied by a square piece of
side length 1. Hence, induction hypothesis assures that we can ﬁnish the assembling
of each one of these four squares by using L-triminoes only, and taking these lets us
conclude that the same is true for the 2k+1 × 2k+1 square (with the square piece of
side length 1 placed in one of its corners).
⊓⊔
As one should expect, the coming example shows that, sometimes, strong
induction is in force.
Example 4.14 (Leningrad) List all nonempty subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} which
do not contain consecutive elements. For each one of them, compute the square of
the product of its elements. Prove that the sum of all of these numbers is equal to
(n + 1)! −1.
Proof As was anticipated above, we shall make strong induction on n ≥1.
If n = 1, the only nonempty subset of {1} is itself, so that the required sum is
1 = 2! −1.
By induction hypothesis, suppose that, for 1 ≤n ≤k, the desired sum is equal
to (n + 1)! −1. Now, notice that the nonempty subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k + 1} without
consecutive elements can be divided in two categories:
(i) the nonempty subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k} without consecutive elements;
(ii) the sets of the form A∪{k +1}, where A is a subset of {1, 2, . . . , k −1} without
consecutive elements.
The induction hypothesis guarantees that the sum of the squares of the products
of the elements of the sets of type (i) equals (k + 1)! −1, while that of the sets of
type (ii) equals (k + 1)2(k! −1) + (k + 1)2 (the summand (k + 1)2 corresponding
to the set {k + 1} = ∅∪{k + 1}).

4.2
Induction and Existence of Conﬁgurations
107
Hence, the sum of the squares of the products of the elements of all desired
subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k + 1} equals
(k + 1)! −1 + (k + 1)2(k! −1) + (k + 1)2 =
= (k + 1)! −1 + (k + 1)2 · k!
= (k + 1)! −1 + (k + 1)!(k + 1)
= (k + 1)!(k + 2) −1
= (k + 2)! −1.
⊓⊔
We now give two examples that show that an inductive argument can compose
just part of the analysis of a certain combinatorial situation.
Example 4.15 (Russia) Let n > 1 be an odd integer. In open ﬁeld, n children are so
positioned that, for each one of them, the distances to the other n −1 children are
pairwise distinct. Each child has a water pistol and, at the sound of a whistle, ﬁres
at the child closest to him/her. Show that at least one child will remain dry.
Proof Firstly, let us look at the case n = 3. Let A, B and C be the children and
assume, without loss of generality, that AB < BC < AC. Then, A ﬁres at B and B
at A, so that C remains dry.
Now, assume that whenever 2k −1 children (k > 1) are positioned in open ﬁeld
as prescribed in the statement of the problem, at least one of them remains dry. We
then consider 2k + 1 children, also positioned as required by the problem. Since the
distances between pairs of children are pairwise distinct, there exist two children,
say A and B, such that the distance between them is the smallest one of all distances
between two of the given children. Thus, A ﬁres at B and vice-versa. Discarding A
and B, we are left with 2k −1 children, and there are two distinct possibilities:
(i) One of these 2k −1 children ﬁres at A or B: in this case, at most 2k −2 shots
are ﬁred towards some of the remaining 2k −1 children (except A and B). By
the pigeonhole principle, at least one of them remains dry.
(ii) None of the remaining 2k −1 children ﬁres at A or B: by induction hypothesis,
at least one of these 2k −1 children remains dry.
⊓⊔
Example 4.16 (IMO Shortlist) We wish to write one of the numbers 0, 1 or 2 in
each entry of a table of 19 lines and 86 columns, in such a way that the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) Each column has exactly k zeros.
(b) For any two chosen columns, there exists a line such that the two entries of this
line situated at the chosen columns are, in some order, equal to 1 and 2.
Find all values of k for which this is possible.

108
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
Solution We say that a set of m lines distinguishes n columns if, for any choice of
two of these n columns, it is possible to choose one of the m lines in such a way that
the entries of this line situated in the two chosen columns are equal to 1 and 2, in
some order.
We claim that m lines distinguish at most 2m columns. Indeed, it is clear that
a single line can distinguish at most two columns. Now, assume that j lines
distinguish at most 2j columns. Then, since a single line distinguishes at most
two columns, j + 1 lines will distinguish at most two groups of 2j columns (the
distinction made by the (j + 1)-th line between the two groups of 2j columns is a
permutation of the pattern
11 . . . 1
  
2j
22 . . . 2
  
2j
.
Hence, j + 1 lines will distinguish at most 2j + 2j = 2j+1 columns.
Back to the given table, since 86 > 26, the above claim assures that we need
at least 7 lines to distinguish all of the 86 columns. On the other hand, 7 lines will
sufﬁce, for 86 < 27. Actually, it sufﬁces to choose 86 distinct sequences of 7 terms,
each of which equal to 1 or 2, and fulﬁll the ﬁrst 7 lines with the terms of these 86
sequences. The remaining lines can be randomly fulﬁlled.
Therefore, we must have 0 ≤k ≤19 −7 = 12.
⊓⊔
For the coming example, recall that, given n ∈N, we let In = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Also
recall that, given sets A and B, their symmetric difference AB is given by
AB = (A ∪B) \ (A ∩B).
Example 4.17 (Argentina) Given n ∈N, let Pn be the family of all subsets of In. If
f : Pn →In is any function, show that there exist distinct A, B ∈Pn and such that
f (A) = f (B) = max(AB).
Proof For n = 1, we have f : {∅, {1}} →{1} and ∅{1} = {1}, so that
f (∅) = f ({1}) = 1 = max({1}).
Suppose that the statement is true for n = k, and take a function f : Pk+1 →
Ik+1. There are two cases to consider:
(i) f maps all sets in Pk to elements of Ik: in this case, it sufﬁces to apply the
induction hypothesis to the restriction of f to Ik.
(ii) There exists A ∈Pk such that f (A) = k + 1: let F ⊂Pk+1 be the family of
the elements of Pk+1 containing k + 1, i.e.,
F = {X ∪{k + 1}; X ∈Pk}.

4.2
Induction and Existence of Conﬁgurations
109
We look at two subcases:
•
there exists B ∈F such that f (B) = k + 1: then, k + 1 ∈B \ A, so that
A ̸= B, k + 1 ∈AB and
f (A) = f (B) = k + 1 = max(AB).
•
f maps F into Ik: let g : Pk →Ik be given by setting g(X) = f (X∪{k+1}),
for every X ∈Pk. By induction hypothesis, there exist distinct A′, B′ ∈Pk,
such that
g(A′) = g(B′) = max(A′B′).
Since (A′∪{k+1})(B′∪{k+1}) = A′B′, we conclude that f (A′∪{k+1})
and f (B′ ∪{k + 1}) are both equal to max

(A′ ∪{k + 1})(B′ ∪{k + 1})

with A′ ∪{k + 1} ̸= B′ ∪{k + 1}.
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by revisiting Problem 17, page 31, this time with the aid of
mathematical induction.
Example 4.18 (Saint Petersburg—Adapted) We are given 2n + 1 points on a circle,
such that no two of them are the endpoints of a diameter. Prove that, among all
triangles having three of the given points as their vertices, at most
1
6n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
of them are acute.
Proof For n = 1 there is nothing to do, since three points on a circle determine
exactly one triangle.
By induction hypothesis, assume that the problem is true when n = k −1, for
some integer k ≥2. Then, let n = k, so that we have 2k + 1 points on the circle.
Out of them, take all pairs of points such that the chord joining them leaves k points
in one arc and k −1 points in the other arc of the circle. Among all such pairs of
points, let A and B be two such that AB is at minimum distance from the center O
of the circle (if there is more than one pair of points with this property, choose any
one of them).
Now, there are three kinds of acute triangles having vertices at three of the 2k +1
given points:
(i) Those having A and B as two of their vertices: since O must belong to the
interior of such a triangle, and AB leaves k points at one side and k −1 points
at the other side, there are at most k such triangles.
(ii) Those having A or B, but not both of them, as one of their vertices: let C and
D be the other two vertices of such an acute triangle (so that the third one is
either A or B). We consider two subcases:

110
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
•
C and D are at the same side of AB: if ACD was to be acute, then AC or
AD would leave B and O at different half-planes. In turn, this would assure
that the distance from AC or AD to O would be less than the distance of
AB to O, thus contradicting our choice of A and B. Therefore, ACD is not
acute and, accordingly, the same is true of BCD.
•
C and D are in opposite sides with respect to AB: since ACBD is convex,
at most one of the triangles ACD or BCD contains the center O, and hence
at most one of such triangles is acute. On the other hand, by the choice of A
and B the set {C, D} can be chosen in exactly k(k −1) ways, and this is the
largest possible number of acute triangles of this kind.
(iii) Those having neither A nor B as one of their vertices: by induction hypothesis,
there are at most 1
6(k −1)k(2k −1) such triangles.
Adding the contributions of the three cases above, we conclude that the number
of acute triangles having its vertices at three of the 2k + 1 given points is at most
k + k(k −1) + 1
6(k −1)k(2k −1) = 1
6k(k + 1)(2k + 1).

2. (Brazil) Given a natural number n > 1, we write a real number of modulus less
than 1 in each cell of an n × n chessboard, in such a way that the sum of the
numbers written in the four cells of any 2 × 2 square is equal to 0. If n is odd,
show that the sum of the numbers written in the n2 cells is less than n.
3. (TT) Point O is situated in the interior of the convex polygon A1A2 . . . An.

least n −1 of them are not acute.
4. (TT) In a convex polygon P some diagonals were drawn, such that no two of
them intersect in the interior of P. Show that there are at least two vertices of P
such that none of the traced diagonals is incident to none of these two vertices.
5. (Hungary) In an n × n chessboard we have a certain number of towers (at most
one tower for each 1×1 square). A tower can move from one square to another
if and only if these two squares belong to a single line or column of the board
and there are no other towers in between. On the other hand, if two towers
belong to a single line or column and there are no other towers in between, then
we say that any of these towers can attack the other. Prove that one can paint the
towers with one of three colors in such a way that no tower can attack another

squares of one of these two colors are such that a chess queen can move through
all of them (possibly passing more than once through one or more of the 1 × 1
squares of this color), without visiting a single square of the other color. We
recall that a chess queen can move an arbitrary number of squares along any
line, column or diagonal of the chessboard.

(a) Each line segment joins a blue point to a red point.
(b) They do not intersect each other.

kn with the following property: given any set of kn points in space, no four of
them being coplanar, and associating an integer number from 1 to n to each line
segment joining two of these kn points, one necessarily gets a triangle having
vertices at three of the kn points and such that the numbers associated to its
sides are all equal.

Partially Ordered Sets
This short section discusses a few facts on partially ordered sets, focusing on the
theorems of Mirsky6 (cf. [30]) and Dilworth7 (cf. [14]). As a corollary of Mirsky’s
theorem, we obtain another proof of Erdös-Szekeres theorem. Dilworth’s theorem,
in turn, will be applied to Graph Theory in Problem 25, page 134.

Existence of Conﬁgurations
We start by presenting the concept of partially ordered set, together with some
examples. In the coming deﬁnition, ⪯denotes a relation on the set A, i.e., a subset
of the cartesian product A × A.
Deﬁnition 4.19 We say that a nonempty set A is partially ordered by ⪯, or that
(A, ⪯) is a partially ordered set, if the following conditions are satisﬁed, for all
a, b ∈A:
(a) (Reﬂexivity) a ⪯a.
(b) (Antisymmetry) a ⪯b and b ⪯a ⇒a = b.
(c) (Transitivity) a ⪯b and b ⪯c ⇒a ⪯c.
In this case, we also say that ⪯is a partial order relation in A.
In the notations of the previous deﬁnition, ⪯must be thought of as a way of
comparing elements of A. This being said, note that we are not demanding that ⪯
provides a way of comparing any two elements of A; in other words, it may well
happen that there exist a, b ∈A such that a ̸⪯b and b ̸⪯a (i.e., such that a ⪯b
and b ⪯a are both false). If this is so, then we say that a and b are incomparable
(via ⪯); otherwise, a and b are said to be comparable.
If ⪯is a partial order relation on A for which any two elements of A are
comparable, we say that ⪯is a total order relation, or simply a total order. We
also say that (A, ⪯) is a totally ordered set.
It is time that we take a look at a few relevant examples of order relations. We
refer to Problem 1 for details.
Example 4.20
(a) The set of real numbers is totally ordered by the order relation ⪯, deﬁned by
a ⪯b ⇔a ≤b. In this case, we say that ≤is the usual order in R.
(b) Let X be a nonempty set and F = P(X) be the family of all subsets of X. For
Y, Z ∈F (i.e., Y, Z ⊂X), we deﬁne Y ⪯Z ⇔Y ⊂Z. It is immediate to
verify that (F, ⪯) is a partially ordered set, which is usually denoted simply by
writing (P(X), ⊂). In this case, we say that ⊂is the inclusion relation in X.
(c) Given a, b ∈N, recall that a | b (one reads “a divides b”) if there exists c ∈N
such that b = ac. Letting ⪯be deﬁned on N by a ⪯b ⇔a | b, it is also
straightforward that (N, ⪯) is a partially ordered set. In view of this example,
one frequently says that N is partially ordered by the divisibility relation.
(d) Let A be a nonempty set partially ordered by ⪯. If B ⊂A is nonempty, the
restriction of ⪯to elements of B turns it into another partially ordered set. In
this case, we say that B is partially ordered by the order relation induced from
A.
If (A, ⪯) is a partially ordered set and a, b ∈A, we write a ≺b to mean that
a ⪯b and a ̸= b. As we indicated before, we write a ̸⪯b to mean that a ⪯b is
false. For what we have in mind, the coming deﬁnition is central.

4.3
Partially Ordered Sets
113
Deﬁnition 4.21 Let A be a nonempty set ordered by ⪯. With respect to ⪯, a
nonempty subset B of A is:
(a) A chain if, for every a, b ∈B, we have either a ⪯b or b ⪯a.
(b) An antichain if, for every a, b ∈B, we have a ̸⪯b and b ̸⪯a.
In words (and in the above notations), B is a chain if, furnished with the order
relation induced from A, is a totally ordered set. On the other hand, B is an antichain
if any two of its elements are incomparable by ⪯.
Example 4.22 Let N be partially ordered by the divisibility relation. Letting P =
{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . .} denote the set of prime numbers, it will be proved in Sect. 6.3
that P is inﬁnite. Thus, P is an inﬁnite antichain on N, whereas {2, 2·3, 2·3·5, . . .}
is an inﬁnite chain.
Example 4.23 If X = {a1, a2, . . . , am} is a set with m elements, then, ordering
F = P(X) with respect to inclusion, the family
G = {∅, {a1}, {a1, a2}, {a1, a2, a3} . . . , {a1, a2, . . . , am}}
is a chain. Actually, F does not contain longer chains. In order to prove this assume,
by the sake of contradiction, that
C = {A1 ⊂A2 ⊂. . . ⊂Am+2}
is a chain on F, formed by m + 2 distinct subsets of X. Then, since |Ai| ∈
{0, 1, 2, . . . , m} for 1 ≤i ≤m + 2, the pigeonhole principle assures that there
exist 1 ≤i < j ≤m + 2 for which |Ai| = |Aj|. In turn, together with Ai ⊂Aj,
this gives Ai = Aj, which is an absurd.
On the other hand, it is immediate to verify that, for each integer 0 ≤k ≤m, the
family
Fk = {Y ⊂X; |Y| = k}
is an antichain in F (note that F0 = {∅}). Furthermore, note that
F = F0 ∪F1 ∪. . . ∪Fm.
We are ﬁnally in position to state and prove Mirsky’s theorem, which is a direct
generalization of the situation described in the above example. For the proof of it,
if (A, ⪯) is a partially ordered set and B = {a1 ⪯a2 ⪯. . . ⪯am} is a chain in
A formed by m distinct elements, then we say that B has length m and am is its
maximum element.
Theorem 4.24 (Mirsky)
Let (A, ⪯) be a partially ordered set. If A does not
possess chains of length n + 1, then A can be written as the union of at most n
antichains.

114
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
Proof Let us make induction on n, noticing ﬁrstly that, if A does not possess chains
of length 2, then A is itself an antichain, and the theorem is trivially true. By
induction hypothesis, suppose that each partially ordered set which does not posses
chains of length k can be written as a union of at most k −1 antichains.
Let (A, ⪯) be a partially ordered set which does not possess chains of length
k + 1. Deﬁne B as the subset of A formed by the maximum elements of the chains
of maximum length in A. We ﬁrst claim that B is an antichain with respect to ⪯. By
contradiction, suppose that there existed x, y ∈B such that x ≺y. Since x ∈B, we
can ﬁnd a chain C in A, of maximum length and whose maximum element is x; but
then, C ∪{y} would be a chain in A, with maximum element y and longer than C,
which is an absurd.
Now, note that (A \ B, ⪯) does not have chains of length k. Indeed, if C was
such a chain in (A\B, ⪯), then, since A does not possess chains of length k +1, the
chain C would be one of maximum length in A. Therefore, the maximum element
of C would belong to B, which is a contradiction.
By applying the induction hypothesis to A\B, we conclude that it can be written
as the union of at most k −1 antichains. Finally, adjoining B to such a collection of
antichains, we write A as the union of at most (k −1) + 1 = k antichains.
⊓⊔
As we mentioned before, we now obtain the Erdös-Szekeres theorem as a
corollary of Mirsky’s theorem. Actually, the following version generalizes that of
Example 4.8.
Theorem 4.25 (Erdös-Szekeres)
If a, b ∈N and n = ab+1, then every sequence
(x1, . . . , xn), of distinct real numbers, either possess an increasing subsequence of
a + 1 terms or a decreasing subsequence of b + 1 terms.
Proof Deﬁne A = {(i, xi); 1 ≤i ≤n} and let ⪯be the relation in A given by
(i, xi) ⪯(j, xj) ⇔(i = j) or (i < j and xi < xj).
It is immediate to verify that ⪯is a partial order in A, and that
(i1, xi1) ≺(i2, xi2) ≺· · · ≺(ik, xik)
is a chain in A if and only if (xi1, . . . , xik) an increasing subsequence of
(x1, . . . , xn). Accordingly, for 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n,
{(i1, xi1), (i2, xi2), . . . , (ik, xik)}
is an antichain in A if and only if (xi1, . . . , xik) is a decreasing subsequence in
(x1, . . . , xn). Indeed, since ir < is for 1 ≤r < s ≤k and all of the xi’s are distinct,
we get
(ir, xir) ̸⪯(is, xis) ⇔xir < xis is false ⇔xir > xis.

4.3
Partially Ordered Sets
115
Now, assume that (x1, . . . , xn) does not contain an increasing sequence of a + 1
terms. Then, A does not have chains of length a+1, so that Mirsky’s theorem assures
that A can be written as the union of l ≤a antichains, say A1, . . . , Al. However,
since
ab + 1 = n = |A| =

it follows from the pigeonhole principle that, for some index 1 ≤i ≤l, we must

⊓⊔
Problems: Sect. 4.3
1. * Check that all of the relations deﬁned in Example 4.20 are, indeed, order
relations.
2. Let A be a set of n2 + 1 positive integers. Prove that there exists a subset B of A,
with n + 1 elements and satisfying one of the following conditions:
(a) For all a, b ∈B, either a | b or b | a.
(b) For all a, b ∈B, one has a ∤b and b ∤a.
3. State and prove a generalization of the Erdös-Szekeres theorem for a partially

table of pairwise distinct real
numbers. Show that it is possible to choose n + 1 columns of the table such that
the m × (n + 1) table composed by the chosen columns satisﬁes the following
condition: the numbers of each line, written from left to right, form an increasing
or decreasing sequence.
5. In a ﬁnite partially ordered set, let A and B be two chains having the greatest
possible lengths. If A ∩B ̸= ∅, prove that A and B have equal lengths.
For the next problem, if (A, ⪯) is a partially ordered set, we say that a ∈A is
a maximal element of A if the following condition is satisﬁed:
a ⪯x, x ∈A ⇒a = x.
6. * The purpose of this problem is to Dilworth’s theorem on partially ordered
sets: if a ﬁnite partially ordered set (A, ⪯) does not contain antichains of n + 1
elements, then A can be written as the union of n pairwise disjoint chains. To this
end, and arguing by induction on |A|, do the following items (cf. [19]):

A \ {a} contains an antichain B0 of k elements and can be written as the

for 1 ≤i ≤k.
(b) For 1 ≤i ≤k, let xi ∈Ai be the maximum element of Ai belonging to an
antichain of k elements in A \ {a}. If B = {x1, x2, . . . , xk}, show that B is
an antichain.

i. Let C = {a} ∪{y ∈Ai; y ⪯xi}. Show that A \ C contains an antichain
of k −1 elements but does not contain an antichain of k elements.
ii. Apply the induction hypothesis to A \ C and, then, conclude that A can
be written as the union of k pairwise disjoint chains.
(d) Assume that xi ̸⪯a for every 1 ≤i ≤k. Show that:
i. B ∪{a} is an antichain of k + 1 elements.
ii. A can be written as the union of k + 1 pairwise disjoint chains.
4.4
Invariants
In the combinatorial situations we discuss here, we generally consider algorithms8
involving somewhat random choices of entries, and try to study the set of possible
outcomes after a certain number of iterations. In this sense, a frequently fruitful
approach consists in trying to associate an invariant to the algorithm, i.e., a
mathematical object that behaves in a predictable way along each iteration of it,
independently of the chosen inputs.
Since there are no general rules that teach us which invariant should be associated
to each particular algorithmic situation, we shall limit ourselves here to examine
some interesting examples, in order to help the reader to grasp the general idea and
to prepare him/her for the posed problems.
Example 4.26 There are several + and −signs written on a blackboard. At each
second we can replace two signs by a single one, according to the following rule:
if the two erased signs are equal, we replace them by a + sign, whereas if they are
different, we replace them by a −sign. Show that, when just one sign is left on the
blackboard, it will not depend on the order we made the replacements.
8Formally, an algorithm is a ﬁnite sequence of well deﬁned operations that, once performed on
some (more or less) arbitrary set of data (called the input of the algorithm), furnish a deﬁnite result,
called the outcome or output of the algorithm. On the other hand, each such performance of the
algorithm is generally referred to as an iteration of it. We shall encounter algorithms several times
along these notes.

4.4
Invariants
117
Solution By the sign rule for products, the product of the signs written on the
blackboard is an invariant for the described replacement algorithm. Thus, the ﬁnal
sign on the blackboard will be equal to the result of the multiplication of all of the
+ and −signs initially written and, hence, does not depend on the order of the
replacements.
⊓⊔
Example 4.27 (Bulgaria) There are 2000 white balls in a box. Also, there is a
sufﬁcient supply of white, green and red balls outside the box. The following
replacement operations are allowed with the balls lying inside the box:
(a) Two white balls by a green one.
(b) Two red balls by a green one.
(c) Two green balls by a white and a red ones.
(d) One white ball and one green ball by a red one.
(e) One green ball and one red ball by a white one.
After a ﬁnite number of these replacement operations, only three balls were left in
the box. Prove that at least one of them is green. Does there exist a ﬁnite number of
operations leaving just one ball in the box?
Solution Assume that, in a certain moment, we have x white balls, y green balls
and z red balls in the box. Let us look at how the quantity x +2y +3z behaves when
performing one of the allowed operations:
•
(a): x + 2y + 3z does not change;
•
(b): x + 2y + 3z changes to x + 2(y + 1) + 3(z −2) = x + 2y + 3z −4;
•
(c): x + 2y + 3z changes to (x + 1) + 2(y −2) + 3(z + 1) = x + 2y + 3z;
•
(d): x + 2y + 3z changes to (x −1) + 2(y −1) + 3(z + 1) = x + 2y + 3z;
•
(e): x + 2y + 3z changes to (x + 1) + 2(y −1) + 3(z −1) = x + 2y + 3z −4.
According to the analysis above, the remainder of the division of x + 2y + 3z
by 4 is an invariant for the described replacement algorithm. Since we began with
x = 2000 and y = z = 0, we conclude that x + 2y + 3z is always a multiple of 4.
Now, note that with only three balls in the box, we have x + y + z = 3 and
x + 2y + 3z = 4k, for some k ∈N. If y = 0, then x + z = 3 and x + 3z = 4k; but,
then, 4k = x + 3z = x + 3(3 −x) = 9 −2x, which is an absurd. Therefore, we
must have y ≥1, so that there will be at least one green ball in the box.
On the other hand, if at some moment we had only one ball in the box, we should
have x +y +z = 1 and x +2y +3z = 4k. The ﬁrst equation shows that exactly one
of x, y and z is equal 1, while the other two are equal to 0; but these possibilities
are clearly inconsistent with the second equation. Therefore, we will never reach a
situation in which just one ball is left in the box.
⊓⊔
In the following, we analyse more sophisticated examples.
Example 4.28 (Soviet Union) At ﬁrst, we have n > 1 real numbers written in a
blackboard. An allowed operation is to erase two of them, say a and b, and to write
a+b
4
in their place. Thus, after each operation, the total quantity of numbers written
in the blackboard is one less than it was before the operation has been executed.

118
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
If all of the n initial numbers were equal to 1, prove that, when just one number is
left on the blackboard, it will necessarily be greater than or equal to 1
n.
Proof Suppose that, at some moment, we have the numbers x1, x2, . . . , xk+1 written
on the blackboard. At this moment, associate the number
f (x1, . . . , xk+1) = 1
x1
+ 1
x2
+ · · · +
1
xk+1
to the blackboard. Without loss of generality, assume that we erase xk and xk+1,
writing x′
k = xk+xk+1
4
in place of them. Since
4
xk + xk+1
≤1
xk
+
1
xk+1
(cf. Example 5.1 (b) of [8], for instance) it is clear that
f (x1, . . . , xk−1, x′
k) ≤f (x1, . . . , xk, xk+1).
Hence, f (x1, . . . , xk) is a semi-invariant for our problem (i.e., the order relation
between the values of f (x1, . . . , xk), computed before and after each operation,
is an invariant for the problem—in our case, such values for a nonincreasing
sequence). Thus, when a single number x will be written on the blackboard, we
ought to have
n = f (1, 1, . . . , 1) ≥f (x) = 1
x .
In turn, this is the same as having x ≥1
n.
⊓⊔
Example 4.29 (Putnam) Let A be the total number of distinct sequences (a1, a2,
. . . , a10) of positive integers such that
1
a1
+ 1
a2
+ · · · + 1
a10
= 1.
Decide whether A is even or odd. Justify your answer.
Solution Firstly, let us prove that the equation
1
x1
+ 1
x2
+ · · · + 1
x10
= 1
has an even number of solutions x1 = a1, . . . , x10 = a10 in positive integers,
satisfying the additional condition a1 ̸= a2. Indeed, if x1 = a1, x2 = a2, x3 = a3,
. . . , x10 = a10 is such a solution, then x1 = a2, x2 = a1, x3 = a3, . . . , x10 = a10 is
another one, and vice-versa. Therefore, we can group the above solutions in pairs,
so that there is an even number of them.

4.4
Invariants
119
Thanks to the above argument, in order to compute the parity of the number of
solutions of the given equation in positive integers, it sufﬁces to compute the parity
of the number of such solutions satisfying the additional condition a1 = a2 (here is
where the idea of invariance plays a role: the parity of the number of solutions in
positive integers does not vary if we impose that a1 = a2).
Analogously, it sufﬁces to compute the parity of the number of solutions in
positive integers satisfying the conditions a3 = a4, a5 = a6, a7 = a8 and a9 = a10.
In turn, this being the case, we get
1
a1
+ 1
a3
+ 1
a5
+ 1
a7
+ 1
a9
= 1
2.
(4.2)
Following the same reasoning as above, we conclude that there is an even number
of solutions of (4.2) in positive integers and such that a1 ̸= a3, as well as an even
number of such solutions in which a5 ̸= a7. Therefore, in order to compute the
parity of the total number of solutions in positive integers, we can assume that a1 =
a3 and a5 = a7. The given equation now reduces to
2
a1
+ 2
a5
+ 1
a9
= 1
2.
(4.3)
By repeating the same reasoning once more, we conclude that the parity of the
total number of solutions is the same as that of the total number of solutions of (4.3)
in which a1 = a5, i.e., the parity of the total number of solutions of
4
a1
+ 1
a9
= 1
2.
The last equation above is equivalent to
a9 =
2a1
a1 −8 = 2 +
16
a1 −8,
(4.4)
so that a1 −8 = 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.
Hence, we have exactly ﬁve positive integer solutions for (4.4), and the invariance
of parity assures that A is odd.
⊓⊔
Example 4.30 (Belarus) A cube lies on an inﬁnite grid of 1 × 1 squares in such a
way that one of its faces (say F) is situated exactly above one of the squares of the
grid. The cube begins to roll on the grid, passing from one position to the next by
rotating over one of its edges. At some moment, the cube stops exactly on the same
1 × 1 square where it began to move. Then, one notices that the face of the cube in
contact with the grid is F again. Is it possible that, this time, F is rotated by 90◦
with respect to its initial orientation?
Proof It is not possible! In order to prove this, let us paint the vertices of the grid
alternately black and white, as in ordinary chessboard. When the cube is about to

120
4
Existence of Conﬁgurations
start rolling, F has two black and two white vertices; then, paint the remaining four
vertices of the cube also black and white, in such a way that each of its edges joins
two vertices of distinct colors. It is easy to check that, as the cube rolls on the grid
from one position to the next, black (resp. white) vertices of it are always in contact
with black (resp. white) vertices of the grid. (Here is the invariance!) However, if
at some future moment F revisits its original position rotated by 90◦with respect
to the initial orientation, then we would have two black vertices of F exactly above
two white vertices of the grid. This contradiction proves our initial claim.
⊓⊔
Our last example uses a semi-invariant reasoning to construct an optimal
conﬁguration.
Example 4.31 (IMO Shortlist) 155 birds are standing on a circle of center O. Two
birds A and B are said to be mutually visible if and only if A *
OB ≤10◦. Assume
that more than one bird can stand on a single point. Compute the smallest possible
number of pairs of mutually visible birds.
Solution Assume that at least one bird stands at a point A, and at least another
one stands at a point B, where A and B are distinct points of the circle such that
A *
OB ≤10◦. Suppose, further, that h birds are visible from A but not from B,
whereas k birds are visible from B but not from A. If h ≤k and we let all birds in B
to ﬂy to A, then the total number of pairs of mutually visible birds (obviously) does
not increase. By repeating such an operation several times, we obtain at the end a
conﬁguration in which two birds are mutually visible if and only if they are placed
at a single point. Moreover, since the total number of pairs of mutually visible birds
did not increase along the performed operations (here we have the semi-invariant!),
in order to minimize this number, it sufﬁces to consider such conﬁgurations. Also,
since 1
36 · 360◦= 10◦, a further consequence of this reasoning and the pigeonhole
principle is that we ought to have birds in at most 35 distinct points of the circle.
Now, take 35 points along the circle, labelled 1, 2, 3, . . . , 35, and place xi ≥0
birds at the point i. Our problem reduces to minimizing

Problems: Sect. 4.4
1. (OCM) One has six equal bottles, ﬁve of them containing 2l of water each and
the sixth one containing 1l. At any time, an allowed operation is to choose two
bottles and split the total amount of water they contain into two equal parts (by
pouring water from one bottle to the other). Is it possible to reach the situation
in which every bottle has the same amount of water?
2. (Soviet Union) At the beginning of a class, a teacher writes a second degree
trinomial on the blackboard. At later moments, an allowed operation with the
trinomial written on the blackboard, say ax2+bx+c, consists in replacing it by
cx2 +bx +a (if c ̸= 0) or by any trinomial of the form a(x +t)2 +b(x +t)+c,
with t ∈R chosen at random. If the trinomial initially written was x2 −x −1, is
there any sequence of allowed operations that makes the trinomial x2 + 3x −1
appear in the blackboard?
3. We cut out two 1×1 squares situated in opposite corners of an 8×8 chessboard.
Is it possible to cover the 62 remaining squares with 31 rectangles 2×1? Justify
your answer!
4. (Argentina) Firstly, numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 1998 are written on a blackboard.
An allowed operation is to replace two of the numbers written, say a and b, by
|a−b|. After 1997 operation, there is just one number written on the blackboard.
Prove that, regardless of the order in which the replacements have been made,
this last number will always be odd.

Existence of Conﬁgurations
5. A Mathematics teacher posed the following activity to his students: one of them
would write on the blackboard a list of six integer numbers; then, a second
student would choose three of these six numbers, say x, y and z, replacing
them respectively by x −y −z, 3x −3y −2z and 4x −2y + 4z (thus getting,
immediately below the former one—and by repeating the three numbers that
have not been chosen—a new list of six integer numbers on the blackboard).
Such a procedure would, then, be repeated with this new list of six numbers
and another student. After the class, the blackboard was partially erased, there
remaining only two lists os numbers:
1 2 3 4 5 6 and 3 7 2 15 8 8
(we don’t know how many lists there were between these two left ones). Prove
that, at some replacement, a student made a mistake.
6. (TT) Ten coins are placed around a circle, all of them showing heads (so that
tails cannot be seen at the beginning). Two moves are allowed:
(a) To turn down four consecutively placed coins.
(b) To turn down four coins placed as in XXOXX (here, X represents a coin to
be turned down, whereas O represents one that should stay as it is).
Is it possible to have all ten coins showing tails after a ﬁnite sequence of moves?
7. (Brazil) In the parliament of Terra Brasilis, each member has at most three
enemies. Prove that the parliament can be divided into two houses, in such a
way that, within his/her house, each member has at most one enemy.
8. (Leningrad) To begin with, numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , n are written on a blackboard.
At any subsequent time, if there are at least two numbers on the blackboard,
an allowed operation consists of erasing two of them, say a and b, and writing
a + b + ab instead (so that, after the operation is performed, we have one less
number on the blackboard). After such an operation is carried out n −1 times,
we shall have only one number written on the blackboard. Prove that it will not
depend on the order the operations were executed.
9. At each vertex of a square we have a certain quantity of cards (possibly none).
An allowed operation is to remove a certain quantity of cards from one vertex
and to put twice this quantity of cards in one of the two vertices adjacent to
that one (to this end, there is a sufﬁciently large supply of cards outside the
square, all of them ready to be used). Assume that we begin with just one card
in one vertex, the other three vertices being empty. Is it possible, after a certain
number of steps, to have exactly 1, 9, 8 and 9 cards in the vertices of the square,
in clockwise order?
The next problem revisits Problem 9, page 111, with the aid of invariants.
10. In the plane we are given 2n points in general position, i.e., such that no three
of them are collinear. If n of these points are blue and the other n are red,
prove that it is always possible to draw n line segments satisfying the following
conditions:

4.4
Invariants
123
(a) Each line segment joins a blue point to a red point.
(b) They do not intersect each other.
11. A cube of edge length n is partitioned into n3 unit cubes. Two unit cubes are
said to be adjacent if they share a common face. Students A and B play the
following game on the bigger cube: A starts in a unit cube of his/her choice,
then moving to an adjacent unit cube. Then B, departing from this last unit
cube, moves to a third one, adjacent to the one he departed from, and so on. A
and B play alternately, without ever revisiting a unit cube visited before. If the
ﬁrst who cannot play loses the game, and if A and B play with the best possible
strategies, who will be the winner?
12. (IMO shortlist)
(a) Decide whether or not it is possible to number the unit squares of an 8 × 8
chessboard from 1 to 64 in such a way that, for every set of four unit squares
of one of the shapes below, the sum of the numbers written on them is a
multiple of 4:
(b) Do the same for the sets of four unit squares of one of the following shapes:
13. (Leningrad) All 120 faces of twenty equal cubes are painted black or white,
with three faces of each color per cube. Prove that the cubes can be placed on
an opaque table in such a way that the faces touching it form the board of a
6 × 6 square and the number of black visible faces equals the number of white
visible ones.
For the coming problem the reader will ﬁnd it useful to recall the following
fact, to be proved later (cf. Proposition 6.33), on the greatest common divisor
and least common multiple of two natural numbers: given a, b ∈N, one has
ab = gcd(a, b) lcm (a, b).
14. (TT) Several positive integers are written on a blackboard. An allowed oper-
ation is to erase two distinct numbers and to write, in their places, their gcd
and lcm . Prove that, after we have repeated such an operation a certain ﬁnite
number of times the numbers written on the blackboard do not change any
more, no matter which additional operations we perform.

Chapter 5
A Glimpse on Graph Theory
We begin this chapter by considering the following three combinatorial problems:
Problem 1 in a party with 100 guests, there is always an even number of people
who know, within the party, an odd number of other people.
Problem 2 a country has 10 cities and 37 two-way roads, such that each road
connects two distinct cities and each pair of cities is connected by at most one road.
Under such conditions, is it always possible to use the roads to travel from one city
to another (perhaps passing through at least one other city)?
Problem 3 a regular polygon of 100 sides is drawn on the plane, together with all
of its diagonals. Suppose we choose at random 2501 of its sides or diagonals, and
paint them red. Is it necessarily true that a red triangle, having vertices at three of
the vertices of the polygon, will be formed?
In spite of the seemingly lack of correlation between the above problems, in all
of them we have certain sets of “objects” (guests, cities, vertices), together with
relations between them (knowing each other, being connected by a road, being
connected by a red segment, according to the case). These common features will
allow us to analyse the three problems within the same abstract context, namely,
Graph Theory. There, we concentrate on the fact that two objects may or may
not be related, without paying actual attention to the particular kinds of objects or
relationships between them.
It is the purpose of this chapter to develop the most basic aspects of Graph
Theory, together with some interesting applications. Along the way, among others
we shall prove Euler’s theorem on the characterization of the existence of Eulerian
paths, Cayley’s theorem on the number of labelled trees and Turán’s extremal
theorem on the existence of cliques. Since we will barely touch the surface of Graph
Theory, we refer the interested reader to [13, 22] or [40] for more comprehensive
introductions to this subject.

5.1
Basic Concepts
In this chapter, unless stated otherwise, all sets under consideration will be ﬁnite.
Given a nonempty set A, we shall denote by P2(A) the family of the subsets of A
having two elements:
P2(A) = {B ⊂A; |B| = 2}.
In particular,
#P2(A) =
|A|

.
Deﬁnition 5.1 A (simple) graph is a pair G = (V ; E), where V is a ﬁnite
nonempty set and E ⊂P2(V ). The elements of the set V are called the vertices
of the graph G, whereas the elements of the family E are called the edges of G.
If there is any possibility of confusion, we may write V (G) and E(G) to denote
the sets of vertices and edges of a graph G.
If G = (V ; E) is a graph and u and v are two of its vertices, we shall say that u
and v are adjacent (or neighbors) provided {u, v} ∈E; in this case, we shall also
say that the edge {u, v} is incident to the vertices u and v. Whenever there is no
danger of confusion, we shall denote the edge {u, v} simply by uv or vu. If u and v
are not adjacent, we shall say that they are non adjacent vertices of G.
For most purposes, it is quite convenient to represent a graph G = (V ; E) by
means of a diagram in which the elements of V are depicted as points or tiny circles
in the plane and the edges of G as arcs joining the corresponding vertices. Well
understood, the diagram thus obtained has no geometric meaning, and its purpose
is nothing but to schematically represent the adjacency relations between pairs of
vertices of G. For instance, if
G = ({a, b, c, d}; {{a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}}),
then G may be represented by any one of the two diagrams shown in Fig. 5.1, for
both of them embody the same adjacency relations.
We shall have more to say on this when we study the notion of isomorphism for
graphs.

Example 5.2 Given a set V with n elements and a graph G = (V ; E), Deﬁnition 5.1
allows two extreme cases, namely, those in which E = ∅or E = P2(V ). In the ﬁrst
case, we say that G = (V ; ∅) is the trivial graph on n vertices, which can be
represented by a set of n points in the plane, with no arcs. In the second case, G is
the complete graph (or a clique) on n vertices, which can also be represented by a
set of n points in the plane, with any two of them being adjacent. From now on, we
shall denote a complete graph on n vertices by Kn; in particular, note that Kn has
exactly
n

edges.
Back to the notion of adjacency, ﬁxed a vertex u of G = (V ; E), we shall denote
by NG(u) the set of vertices adjacent to u:
NG(u) = {v ∈V ; uv ∈E}.
The following deﬁnition is central to all that follows.
Deﬁnition 5.3 Let G = (V ; E) be a graph. For u ∈V , the degree of u, denoted
dG(u) is the number of vertices of G which are adjacent to u:
dG(u) =
		NG(u)
		.
Remark 5.4 Whenever the graph G = (V ; E) is understood, for u ∈V we shall
denote the degree of u and the set of neighbors of u simply by d(u) and N(u),
respectively.
We are ﬁnally in position to state and prove the most basic result of Graph Theory,
which is due to Euler.1
Theorem 5.5 (Euler)
In every graph G = (V ; E), the sum of the degrees of the
vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. In symbols:
2|E| =

u∈V
dG(u).
(5.1)
Proof We use double counting. It sufﬁces to observe that, if ϵ = {u, v} is an edge
of G, then ϵ is counted exactly twice in the right hand side of (5.1): once in the
summand dG(u) and another time in the summand dG(v). Hence, the right hand
side of (5.1) has to be equal to 2|E|, since this number also counts each edge of G
exactly twice.
⊓⊔
The coming corollary, also due to Euler, is the most important consequence of
the previous theorem.
Corollary 5.6 (Euler) In any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even.
1Actually, as we shall see later, Euler is usually credited as being the founder of Graph Theory.

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Proof Let G = (V ; E) be a graph and, for an integer k ≥0, let vk(G) denote the
number of vertices of G with degree k. Since the sum at the right hand side of (5.1)
has exactly vk(G) summands equal to k, we have (again by double counting) the
equality

u∈V
dG(u) =

k≥0
kvk(G).
(5.2)
It thus follows from Euler’s theorem that
2|E| =

dG(u) =

2j(v2j(G) + v2j+1(G)).
Therefore,

j≥0
v2j+1(G) = 2|E| −

j≥1
2j(v2j(G) + v2j+1(G)),
which is an even number.
⊓⊔
Example 5.7 Prior to a committee’s reunion, some of its ten members shook hands.
Is it possible that the numbers of handshakes have been, in some order, equal to 1,
1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8?
Proof Look at the committee’s members as the vertices of a graph, with two vertices
being adjacent if the corresponding people shook hands. Then, if the situation just
described could have occurred, the degrees of the vertices of the graph would have
been, in some order, equal to 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8. But this would contradict
the previous corollary, since we would have an odd number of vertices of odd
degree. Therefore, such a situation cannot have occurred.
⊓⊔
The following deﬁnition brings the appropriate notion of equivalence for graphs.
Deﬁnition 5.8 Graphs G = (V1; E1) and H = (V2; E2) are said to be isomorphic
if there exists a bijection f : V1 →V2 which preserves incidence, i.e., such that,
for every two distinct vertices u and v of G, we have
{u, v} ∈E1 ⇔{f (u), f (v)} ∈E2.
In this case, we denote G1 ≃G2.

5.1
Basic Concepts
129
It is clear from the previous deﬁnition that two isomorphic graphs have equal
numbers of vertices. On the other hand, Problem 4 guarantees that, for each n ∈N,
the notion of isomorphism of graphs induces an equivalence relation (cf. Sect. 2.3)
in the set of graphs of n vertices.
The coming proposition gives other necessary conditions for two graphs to be
isomorphic.
Proposition 5.9 Two isomorphic graphs have equal numbers of vertices of a
certain degree. In particular, they have equal numbers of edges.
Proof Let G = (V1; E1) and H = (V2; E2) be isomorphic graphs and f : V1 →V2
be an incidence-preserving bijection. If u is a vertex of G having degree k > 0,
such that NG(u) = {u1, . . . , uk}, then it is immediate to see that NH(f (u)) =
{f (u1), . . . , f (uk)}. In particular, f (u) is a vertex of H having degree k. An
analogous reasoning assures that if u has degree 0, then the same holds for f (u).
Since the argument of the last paragraph is symmetric with respect to G and
H (here we are using the fact that the notion of isomorphism of graphs is an
equivalence relation), we conclude that G and H have, for every integer k ≥0,
equal quantities of vertices of degree k.
For what is left, we apply Euler’s theorem twice: since dG(u) = dH(f (u)) for
every u ∈V1 and f is a bijection between the sets of vertices of G and H, we obtain
2|E1| =

u∈V1
dG(u) =

u∈V1
dH(f (u)) =

f (u)∈V2
dH(f (u)) = 2|E2|.
Therefore, |E1| = |E2|.
⊓⊔
Example 5.10 If G = (V ; E) is a graph of n vertices we can assume, whenever
needed, that V = In. Indeed, since |V | = n, we can choose a bijection f : V →In
and let H = (In; F) be deﬁned by setting, for i ̸= j in In,
{i, j} ∈F ⇔{f −1(i), f −1(j)} ∈E.
The previous example allows us to introduce a quite useful algebraic representa-
tion of a graph, namely, its adjacency matrix. In this respect, we assume the reader
is acquainted with the most basic concepts on matrices, which can be revisited at
Chapter 2 of [4], for instance.
Deﬁnition 5.11 Given a graph G = (V ; E), with |V | = n, assume, according to
the previous example, that V = In. The adjacency matrix of G is the n × n matrix
Adj(G) = (aij) such that
aij =
1, if i ̸= j and {i, j} ∈E
0, else
.

130

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Lemma 5.12 The adjacency matrix of a graph is symmetric, with zeros in the main
diagonal.
Proof In the notations of the previous deﬁnition we have, for i ̸= j in In, that
aij = 1 ⇔{i, j} ∈E ⇔{j, i} ∈E ⇔aji = 1;
hence, Adj(G) is symmetric. The rest is immediate from the deﬁnition.
⊓⊔
Remark 5.13 Given a graph G = (V ; E), we shall sometimes say that G is
labelled, an allusion to the fact that its vertices have names, or labels. The notion
of isomorphism of graphs allows us to introduce the concept of unlabelled graph.
More precisely, if V is a set with n elements and G is the set of graphs having
V as set of vertices, then the restriction of the relation of graph isomorphism to
G induces an equivalence relation in G. A unlabelled graph with n vertices is
an equivalence class in G, with respect to the isomorphism relation. Unless we
explicitly say otherwise, in these notes we shall consider only labelled graphs,
generally omitting the adjective “labelled”.
We ﬁnish this section by examining the important notion of subgraph of a graph.
Deﬁnition 5.14 A graph H is a subgraph of a graph G if V (H) ⊂V (G) and
E(H) ⊂E(G). The graph H is a spanning subgraph of G if H is a subgraph of
G for which V (H) = V (G).
We now show how to build two fundamental examples of subgraphs of a given
graph.
Example 5.15 Given a graph G = (V ; E) and ϵ ∈E, the subgraph of G obtained
by the edge excision of ϵ is the graph H = (V ; E\ϵ). From now on, we shall denote
such a subgraph of G simply by G −ϵ. In words, G −ϵ is the subgraph obtained
from G by erasing the edge ϵ. Note, further, that G −ϵ is a spanning subgraph of
G.
Example 5.16 Given a graph G = (V ; E) and u ∈V , the subgraph of G obtained
by vertex excision of u is the graph H = (V \ {u}; E′), where
E′ = E \ {ϵ ∈E; ϵ is incident with u}.
From now on, we shall denote such a subgraph of G simply by G −u. In words,
G −u is the subgraph of G obtained by erasing vertex u, together with all of the
edges of G incident to it. Note, further, that G −u has one vertex less and dG(u)
edges less than G.
Corollary 5.6 gave a necessary condition for a list of nonnegative integers
to be the list of degrees of some simple graph. Although there is no simple

5.1
Basic Concepts
131
sufﬁcient condition to decide whether this is so, we ﬁnish this section by presenting
Havel-Hakimi’s2 simple algorithm, that allows one to quickly decide it for any given
list of nonnegative integers. We follow [22].
Theorem 5.17 (Havel-Hakimi) If s is a positive integer, then the nonnegative
integers
s ≥t1 ≥t2 ≥. . . ≥ts ≥d1 ≥. . . ≥dn
are the degrees of the vertices of some simple graph if and only if so are
t1 −1, t2 −1, . . . , ts −1, d1, . . . , dn.
Proof Let G be a graph whose vertices have degrees s ≥t1 ≥t2 ≥. . . ≥ts ≥d1 ≥
. . . ≥dn. Since s is positive and the vertex u of degree s has exactly s neighbors,
we conclude that t1, t2, . . . , ts ≥1 (note that this follows from the fact that we have
listed the degrees in descending order). For 1 ≤i ≤s, let vi be the vertex of degree
ti and, for 1 ≤j ≤n, let wj be the vertex of degree dj. We distinguish two cases:
(i) NG(u) = {v1, . . . , vs}: then the vertices of H := G −u have degrees t1 −
1, t2 −1, . . . , ts −1, d1, . . . , dn.
(ii) NG(u) ̸= {v1, . . . , vs}: then, for some 1 ≤i ≤s and some 1 ≤j ≤n, we have
u nonadjacent to vi and adjacent to wj. In particular, ti ≥dj, and we consider
two subcases (make some drawings to follow the reasoning):
•
ti = dj: let G′ be the graph obtained from G by exchanging vi and wj.
•
ti > dj: then vi has a neighbor x which is not a neighbor of wj. Let G′ be
the graph obtained from G by erasing the edges {u, wj}, {vi, x} and adding
the edges {u, vi}, {wj, x}.
After having performed either i. or ii., we are left with a graph G′ whose
list of degrees is equal to that of G, and such that NG′(u) ∩{v1, . . . , vs}
strictly contains NG(u) ∩{v1, . . . , vs}. If NG′(u) = {v1, . . . , vs}, we return
to i. Otherwise, we repeat ii. until we reach such a situation. In the end of
this process, we will ﬁnd a graph H having degrees t1 −1, t2 −1, . . . , ts −
1, d1, . . . , dn.
Conversely, assume that (t1 −1, t2 −1, . . . , ts −1, d1, . . . , dn) is the sequence of
degrees of some simple graph H, and let ui be a vertex in H with degree ti −1. Form
a graph G by adding a vertex to H and making it adjacent to u1, . . . , us. Then, the
sequence of degrees of the vertices of G is precisely (s, t1, t2, . . . , ts, d1, . . . , dn).

G(5, 1) and G(5, 2) by joining, for 1 ≤i ≤5, vertex i of G(5, 1) to vertex 2i
of G(5, 2). The graph thus obtained is known as Petersen graph.3
For the next problem, one says that a nonempty subset A of the set of vertices
of a graph G is independent if any two vertices in A are nonadjacent in G.
16. * A graph G = (V ; E) is bipartite if one can write V = V1 ∪V2, with V1
and V2 being disjoint, nonempty and independent sets of vertices. Prove that
|E| ≤|V1| · |V2|, with equality if and only if each vertex of V1 is adjacent to
some vertex of V2, and vice-versa.
17. * In the notations of the previous problem, a bipartite graph G = (V1 ∪V2; E)
is said to be complete if |E| = |V1| · |V2|. If H = (W1 ∪W2; F) is another
complete bipartite graph, prove that
G ≃H ⇔|V1| = |W1| and |V2| = |W2|, or vice-versa.
Thanks to such a result, if |V1| = m and |V2| = n, we write simply Km,n to
denote the complete bipartite graph G = (V1 ∪V2; E).

E′ of E formed by pairwise disjoint edges; a matching E′ is maximal if G
has no matching with more edges than E′. The purpose of this problem is to
prove König’s theorem5: in every bipartite graph, the number of vertices in a
minimal vertex cover is equal to the number of edges in a maximal matching.

(c) Apply Dilworth’s theorem (cf. Problem 6, page 115) to prove König’s
theorem.
For the coming problem, we deﬁne a directed graph, or digraph as a graph
G such that we associate an orientation to each one of its edges. Informally, this
can be thought of as an arrow along the edge; formally, each edge of a digraph
is an ordered pair (instead of a set) (u, v), for some distinct u, v ∈V (G), such
that if (u, v) is an edge then (v, u) is not. Given a vertex u of a digraph G,
we deﬁne the out degree d+
G(u) of u as the number of arrows departing from
u; analogously, the in degree of u, denoted d−
G(u), is the number of arrows
arriving at u. Hence,
dG(u) = d+
G(u) + d−
G(u)
is the degree of u in G, thought of as an ordinary graph (i.e., the graph obtained
by removing the orientations of the edges of the digraph).
If a digraph contains a K3, then such a K3 is said to be transitive or
cyclic, provided it satisﬁes the situation depicted at left or right, respectively, in
Fig. 5.2. A digraph G is complete, or a tournament if it is a complete graph
when we remove the orientations of its edges.

5.2
Paths, Walks and Cycles
In this section we study the problem of deciding whether a graph is connected, i.e.,
has only one piece. As a byproduct, we introduce the concepts that name the section
and prove several important results related to them. In particular, we give a necessary
and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of an Eulerian walk in a connected graph,
and characterize bipartite graphs in terms of cycles.
Deﬁnition 5.18 A walk of length k ≥1 in a graph G is a sequence
P = (u0, u1, . . . , uk)
(5.3)
of (not necessarily distinct) vertices of G, such that ui−1 is adjacent to ui, for 1 ≤
i ≤k. A walk P as above is said to be closed if u0 = uk.
The graphs we wish to qualify are those for which there is a walk between any
two vertices. Since these graphs are quite important for our subsequent discussion,
we isolate them in the coming
Deﬁnition 5.19 A graph is connected if there exists a walk between any two of its
vertices. A non connected graph is said to be disconnected.
The coming proposition furnishes a simple (sufﬁcient, albeit obviously not
necessary) criterion for a graph to be connected. For its statement, we need to
introduce a concept which will also be useful in other future context: given a graph
G = (V ; E), its minimum degree is the nonnegative integer δ(G) given by
δ(G) = min{dG(u); u ∈V (G)}.
(5.4)
Proposition 5.20 If G is a graph of n vertices for which δ(G) ≥⌊n
2⌋, then G is
connected.
Proof If n = 1, there is nothing to do. If n = 2, then δ(G) = 1 and, hence, the two
vertices of G are adjacent. Suppose, then, that n > 2, and let u and v be distinct
vertices of G; we shall show that there is a walk between them. If u and v are
adjacent, there is nothing to do. Otherwise, since

5.2
Paths, Walks and Cycles
137
dG(u) + dG(v) ≥2⌊n/2⌋> n −2 = #(V (G) \ {u, v}),
the pigeonhole principle guarantees the existence of a vertex w ̸= u, v, adjacent to
both u and v. Therefore, the walk (u, w, v) joins u and v.
⊓⊔
For a ﬁxed graph G, it is immediate to verify that the relation ∼in V (G), deﬁned
by letting
u ∼v ⇔u = v or there exists a walk in G joining u and v,
(5.5)
is of equivalence. Also, note that an equivalence class of V (G) with respect to such
a relation is, in particular, a set of vertices of G.
For the next deﬁnition, the reader may ﬁnd it convenient to review the notion of
subgraph induced by a set of vertices, in Problem 12, page 132.
Deﬁnition 5.21 The connected components of a graph G are the subgraphs G|A
of G, induced by the equivalence classes A of V (G) with respect to the equivalence
relation (5.5).
If A is an equivalence class of vertices of G with respect to (5.5), then, in
particular, there is a walk between any two distinct vertices in A, so that G|A is
a connected graph. On the other hand, if H is a connected subgraph of G containing
G|A, then H = G|A. Indeed, if u ∈V (H) and v ∈A ⊂V (H), then the
connectedness of H assures the existence of a walk in H (and hence in G) joining
u and v; therefore, u ∈A, since A is an equivalence class of vertices of G with
respect to the existence of walks. Thus, we have A ⊂V (H) ⊂A, from where it
follows that H = G|A. The above argument allows us to assert that the connected
components of a graph are precisely its maximal connected subgraphs.
Back to the analysis of the walks in a graph, we collect yet another relevant piece
of terminology, which goes back to Euler. In this sense, if P is a walk in a graph G
as in (5.3), we say that {ui−1, ui}, for 1 ≤i ≤k, are the edges of G traversed by P.
Deﬁnition 5.22 An Eulerian walk in a connected graph is a closed walk which
traverses each edge of the graph exactly once. A connected graph is Eulerian if it
contains an Eulerian walk.
Let G be an Eulerian graph and P be an Eulerian walk in G, as in (5.3). For an
arbitrary vertex u of G, if k ≥1 is the number of occurrences of u in P, we claim
that dG(u) = 2k, an even number. This is obvious if all such occurrences of u are of
the form u = ui, with 1 ≤i < k (for in this case ui−1 and ui+1 are distinct vertices
of G, both adjacent to u); on the other hand, if u0 = u, note that uk = u too, for P is
closed. Therefore, a necessary condition for a connected graph G to be Eulerian is
that all vertices of G are of even degree. Theorem 5.24 below guarantees that such
condition is also sufﬁcient for the existence of an Eulerian walk. Before we discuss
it, we need an important auxiliary result.

138

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Lemma 5.23 If G is a connected and nontrivial graph in which every vertex has
even degree, then G contains a closed walk which does not traverse the same edge
twice.
Proof Choose a vertex u0 of G and, starting at u0, construct a walk in G by
performing the following operation as many times as possible: being at a vertex
uk−1 of G, with k ≥1, choose a vertex uk of G, adjacent to uk−1 and such that the
edge {uk−1, uk} has not been chosen yet.
In order to show that the algorithm described above does generate a closed walk
in G, assume that, after a certain number of (at least one) operations, we ﬁnd
ourselves in a vertex uk of G. There are two possibilities:
(i) uk = u0: there is nothing to do, for the closed walk is (u0, u1, . . . , uk).
(ii) uk ̸= u0: suppose that the vertex uk has appeared (with smaller indices) other
l times along the performed operations; this used exactly 2l + 1 of the edges
incident to uk (two edges for each of the l previous occurrence of uk, and an
extra edge to reach uk from uk−1). However, since uk has even degree, there
exists at least one edge incident to uk and which has not been used yet; hence,
the algorithm does not stop at uk.
Finally, since the number of edges in G is ﬁnite, the above discussion assures that
the algorithm stops at u0 and, when it does so, we have succeeded in constructing a
closed walk in G which does not traverse the same edge twice.
⊓⊔
We are now in position to prove the result of Euler alluded to above.
Theorem 5.24 (Euler)
A connected and nontrivial graph G is Eulerian if and only
if all of its vertices have even degree.
Proof We have already seen, in the paragraph preceding Lemma 5.23, that the
condition that all vertices of G have even degree is indeed necessary for the
existence of an Eulerian walk. In order to establish the sufﬁciency, let us make
induction on the number of edges of G.
Since G is nontrivial, if all of its vertices have even degree, then it has at least
three edges; moreover, if G has exactly three edges, then it is immediate to prove
that it is isomorphic to K3, which is clearly Eulerian.
Now, assume that G has n > 3 edges, and that the theorem is true for all
connected graphs with less than n edges and such that all vertices have even degree.
By the previous lemma, we can take in G a closed walk P = (u0, u1, . . . , uk−1, u0),
that does not traverse the same edge twice. Let A be the set of edges in P, and
H1,. . . , Hl be the nontrivial connected components of G −A (cf. Problem 11,
page 132). If a vertex u of Hi occurs j ≥0 times in P, then
dG(u) = dHi(u) + 2j,
so that dHi(u) is even. Since this is true for all indices 1 ≤i ≤l and all vertices
u ∈V (Hi), we conclude that H1, . . . , Hl do satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem.

5.2
Paths, Walks and Cycles
139
Since each Hi has less edges than G, the induction hypothesis guarantees the
existence of an Eulerian walk Pi for Hi, for 1 ≤i ≤l. At this point, the idea is
to glue the Eulerian walks P1, . . . , Pl to P one by one, in a way to get an Eulerian
walk for G. To this end, note that P and P1 have at least one vertex in common,
say u. We may assume, without loss of generality, that P and P1 start and end at
u (it sufﬁces to change the starting points of both these closed walks, if necessary).
Hence, following P and subsequently P1, we obtain a closed walk P′
1 in G, which
encompasses all of the edges of P and P1 and does not traverse one of them twice.
It now sufﬁces to repeat the above argument more l −1 times, gluing P2 to P′
1 to get
a closed walk P′
2, and so on. The closed walk P′
l, obtained at the end of this process
will be an Eulerian walk in G.
⊓⊔
The above result, proved by L. Euler in 1735, marks the birth of Graph Theory.
Euler came to it after having been inquired on the possibility of performing a walk
along the streets of the prussian city of Königsberg (nowadays the Russian city of
Kaliningrad), traversing exactly once each of the seven bridges the city had, at that
time, over the Pregel river.
Taking into account that these bridges join two islands of the Pregel to the
remaining parts of the city, Euler modelled the problem posed to him as the search
for ﬁnding, in the graph of Fig. 5.3, a walk of the type we refer today as being
Eulerian. Although such a graph is not simple (notice the multiple edges joining
two vertices, a situation that, by the sake of simplicity, we did not allow in our
presentation of the theory), a moment’s reﬂection will easily convince the reader
that the previous theorem remains true for non simple connected graphs. Therefore,
this result (actually, the adaptation of the argument for the proof of the necessity
part of it, given at the paragraph preceding Lemma 5.23) guarantees that the graph
of Fig. 5.3 does not contain an Eulerian walk, for all of its vertices have odd degree.
Back to the general development of the theory, we ﬁnish this section by studying
the concepts of paths and cycles in graphs, as well as looking at some relevant
applications of them.
Deﬁnition 5.25 A path in a graph is a walk with distinct vertices.

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Even though every path is a walk, it is clear that the converse is not true in
general, namely, that there are walks which are not paths. Nevertheless, it is not
difﬁcult to convince ourselves (cf. Problem 7) that, if a graph contains a walk
between two of its vertices, then it also contains a path between them.
Deﬁnition 5.26 A k-cycle in a graph G is a closed walk
(u0, u1, . . . , uk−1, u0)
in G, of length k ≥3 and such that (u0, u1, . . . , uk−1) is a path.
The coming result uses the concept of cycle to characterize bipartite graphs (cf.
Problem 16, page 133).
Proposition 5.27 A graph G is bipartite if and only if every cycle in G has even
length.
Proof Firstly, let us assume that G is bipartite, with independent sets of vertices V1
and V2. If C = (u0, u1, u2, . . . , uk−1, u0) is a cycle in G, then the independence of
the sets V1 and V2 guarantees that vertices ui and ui+1 alternate between the sets V1
and V2, for 0 ≤i ≤k −1 (with uk = u0). In particular, the path (u0, u1, . . . , uk−1)
alternates k −1 times between V1 and V2 for, starting from u0, arrive at uk−1.
However, since uk−1 and u0 are adjacent, they cannot belong to a single one of
the sets V1 or V2 and, hence, k −1 must be odd. Therefore, the length k of C must
be even.
Conversely, assume that every cycle in G has even length. We use induction on
the number of edges to show that G is bipartite. If G contains some cycle C, erase
an edge ϵ = {u, v} of C. Since no further cycles are created, all of the cycles of
G −ϵ are also of even length. Hence, by induction hypothesis, G −ϵ is bipartite,
with independent sets of vertices V1 and V2, say. We shall show that V1 and V2 are
also independent in G. To this end, note that the path C −ϵ in G−ϵ joins u to v and
has odd length; since its vertices alternate between V1 and V2, it follows that u ∈V1
and v ∈V2, or vice-versa. Therefore, V1 and V2 are also independent in G, so that
G is bipartite too.
⊓⊔
The coming deﬁnition, due to the nineteenth century Irish astronomer, math-
ematician and physicist William R. Hamilton, is, in a certain sense, dual to the
deﬁnition of Eulerian walk.
Deﬁnition 5.28 A hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that passes through
all of the vertices of the graph. A connected graph is hamiltonian if it contains
a hamiltonian cycle.
Not every connected graph is hamiltonian; for instance, any graph without cycles
is not hamiltonian (for not-so-trivial examples, see Example 5.30 or Problem 21).
The question of the existence or not of hamiltonian cycles in graphs is much
more difﬁcult than the corresponding problem for Eulerian walks. Actually, up to
now there does not exist a set of simple necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a

5.2
Paths, Walks and Cycles
141
graph to be hamiltonian. On the other hand, the coming result, due to the Hungarian
mathematician of the twentieth century Gabriel Dirac, provides a simple sufﬁcient
condition for the existence of hamiltonian cycles in a graph. For its statement, the
reader may ﬁnd it helpful to review the deﬁnition of minimum degree of a graph,
in (5.4).
Theorem 5.29 (Dirac)
If G is a graph with n ≥3 vertices and such that δ(G) ≥
n
2, then G is hamiltonian.
Proof Proposition 5.20 gives the connectedness of G. Now, let P = (u0, . . . , uk) be
a maximal path in G (i.e., one for which there is no other of greater length). If v is a
neighbor of u0 not belonging to P, we can change P by P1 = (v, u0, . . . , uk), thus
obtaining a path in G bigger than P, which is a contradiction. Hence, P includes
all of the neighbors of u0 and, analogously, all of the neighbors of uk. In turn, this
assures that the length of P is at least n
2.
We ﬁrst claim that there exists an index 0 ≤i ≤k −1 such that u0 is adjacent to
ui+1 and ui is adjacent to uk. In order to show this, let A = {0 ≤i ≤k −1; ui+1 ∈
NG(u0)} and B = {0 ≤i ≤k −1; ui ∈NG(uk)}. Since all of the vertices in
NG(u0) and all of the vertices in NG(uk) are in P, it follows that |A|, |B| ≥n
2.
Since |A ∪B| ≤k, we then get
|A ∩B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∪B| ≥n −k > 0,
for P is a path in G with k + 1 vertices, so that k + 1 ≤n.
Now, choose 0 ≤i ≤k −1 as in the above claim, and consider the cycle
C = (u0, ui+1, ui+2, . . . , uk−1, uk, ui, ui−1, . . . u1, u0).
We claim that C is hamiltonian. By contradiction, suppose that some vertex of G,
say v, is not in C. Since C has more than n
2 vertices and v has at least n
2 neighbors,
pigeonhole’s principle (applied as in the proof of Proposition 5.20) guarantees the
existence of a vertex w in C such that w is adjacent to v. Renaming the vertices of
C, we can assume that
C = (v0, v1, . . . , vk, v0),
with v0 = w. But then, P1 = (v, v0, v1, . . . , vk) would be a path in G bigger than
P, which is impossible.
⊓⊔
The lower bound on δ(G) asked by Dirac’s theorem is the best possible one, in
the sense of the following example.
Example 5.30 Let n > 1 be odd and let G be the graph of n vertices formed by the
union of two copies of K(n+1)/2 with a single common vertex, say u (i.e., take two
disjoint copies of K(n+1)/2, choose one vertex out of each of them and make these
two vertices coincide). One clearly has δ(G) = n−1
2
< n
2. Nevertheless, G does
not contain a hamiltonian cycle, for every cycle in G containing u must be entirely

142

contained in one of the copies of K(n+1)/2 which originated G. Indeed, if C is such
a cycle, then C −u is a connected subgraph of G −u, which, in turn is the disjoint
union of two copies of K(n−1)/2; therefore, C −u is contained in a single one of
these two copies and, hence, is also contained in a single one of the two copied of
K(n+1)/2 from which we formed G.

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
For the coming problem, given a digraph G (cf. Problem 26, page 135) and
two of its vertices, say u and v, we deﬁne an (oriented) walk in G, from u to
v, to be a sequence (u0, . . . , uk) of vertices of G such that u0 = u, uk = v
and the edge joining ui and ui+1 is oriented from ui to ui+1, for 0 ≤i < k. In
this case, we say that k is the length of the walk. A path is a walk with distinct
vertices. Finally, recall that a complete digraph or tournament is a digraph that
turns into a complete graph when we remove the orientation of its edges.
17. In a tournament G, show that there exists a vertex from which one can reach
any other vertex with a path of length at most 2.
18. (TT) In Shvambrania there are n cities, each two of them connected by a road.
These roads do not intersect; if necessary, viaducts are used for some of them to
overpass others. An evil wizard wants to establish one way directions in each of
the roads, so that, if someone leaves a certain city, he/she can no longer return.
Prove that:
(a) The wizard can actually establish such rules.
(b) Whatever the way the wizard chooses to set his rules, there will always be a
city from which one can reach any other, and a city from which one cannot
leave.
(c) The wizard can execute his intent in exactly n! distinct ways.

of distinct unit squares of the chessboard such that, for each 0 ≤j < m,
squares cj and cj+1 share a common edge. Such a path is said to be optimal if
it contains all of the n2 unit squares of the chessboard. Moreover, we say that a
path as above contains an U if, for some 0 ≤j ≤m −3, the unit squares cj
and cj+3 share a common edge. Show that every optimal path contains an U.
20. (Tchecoslovaquia) Prove that, in every connected graph, there exists a vertex

following items:
(a) Prove that C contains either two or four of the edges {a, a′}, {b, b′}, {c, c′},
{d, d′} and {e, e′}.
(b) If four of the edges in (a) belong to C suppose, without loss of generality,
that {b, b′} is the one not belonging to C. Conclude that {a′, b′}, {b′, c′},
{b, e} and {b, d} are in C and use this to reach a contradiction.
(c) If two of the edges of (a) are in C assume, without loss of generality, that
{a, a′} is one of them. Conclude that exactly one of the edges {a, c} or

such a way that it is always possible to go from one room to another without
leaving the building. Compute how many are the distinct ways of distributing

Trees
In this section we study connected graphs which do not have cycles, also said to be
acyclic. The relevant deﬁnition is the one below.
Deﬁnition 5.31 A tree is a connected and acyclic graph.
If T is a tree, a leaf of T is a vertex of degree 1, whereas a node of T is a vertex
of degree greater than 1. It is an important fact that every tree has leaves, as we now
establish.
Lemma 5.32 Every tree with more than one vertex has at least two leaves.

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Proof Let T be a tree with at least two vertices and consider, in T , a path C with
the largest possible length. If C = (u1, u2, . . . , un), we claim that u1 and un are
leaves. Indeed, if it was dT (u1) ≥2, then u1 would be adjacent to u2 and to some
other vertex, say u0. Since trees do not have cycles, we must have u0 ̸= u3, . . . , un.
Therefore, (u0, u1, u2 . . . , un) would be a path in T with length greater than that of
C, which is an absurd. Hence, dT (u1) = 1 and, analogously, dT (un) = 1.
⊓⊔
The previous lemma allows us to prove the coming proposition, which gives a
necessary condition for a connected graph to be a tree. Soon hereafter we will show
that such a condition will be also sufﬁcient.
Proposition 5.33 If T = (V ; E) is a tree, then |E| = |V | −1.
Proof We make induction on |V |. Firstly, it is clear that every tree with two vertices
has exactly one edge. Assume, by induction hypothesis, that every tree with n > 1
vertices has exactly n −1 edges, and consider a tree T with n + 1 vertices. By the
lemma, T has a leaf u; hence, T −u is a tree with n vertices, and the induction
hypothesis assures that T −u has n −1 edges. However, since T has exactly one
edge more than T −u, it follows that T has exactly n edges.
⊓⊔
Corollary 5.34 If G = (V ; E) is a connected graph, then G contains at least one
cycle if and only if |E| ≥|V |.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that G contains at least one cycle. We shall show that |E| ≥|V |
by induction on |E|. If ϵ is the edge of a cycle in G, then G −ϵ is also connected
and has |V | vertices and |E| −1 edges. Then, there are two possibilities:
•
G −ϵ contains a cycle: it follows from the induction hypothesis that |E| −1 ≥
|V |;
•
G−ϵ is acyclic: since it is still connected, G−ϵ is a tree. Therefore, the previous
proposition guarantees that |V | = (|E| −1) + 1 = |E|.
In any case, we concluded that |E| ≥|V |.
Conversely, if G is acyclic, then G is a tree, so that (again from the previous
result) |E| = |V | −1 < |V |.
⊓⊔
Corollary 5.35 Let T = (V ; E) be a connected graph. If |E| = |V | −1, then T is
a tree.
Proof If T has at least one cycle, it would follow from the previous corollary that
|E| ≥|V |, which is a contradiction. Thus, T is connected and acyclic, hence, a
tree.
⊓⊔
For what comes next, given a connected graph G, associate to each edge ϵ of G
a weight, i.e., a positive real number w(ϵ) (to motivate this concept, think of the
vertices of the graph as several cities of some region and of the weights as measures
of travel expenses between adjacent cities). This way, G becomes a weighted graph
and the weight w(G) of G is deﬁned by setting

with E = E(G).
Given a connected graph G, a spanning tree of G is a spanning subgraph of G
(cf. Deﬁnition 5.14) which is a tree. An interesting problem in the elementary theory
of trees is the following one: given a weighted graph, ﬁnd a spanning tree of least
possible weight, said to be a minimal spanning tree.
We deal with this problem in the coming proposition, due to the American
mathematician of the twentieth century Joseph Kruskal. Well understood, since the
set of spanning trees of a graph is ﬁnite (and nonempty, as we shall see), there always
exist minimal spanning trees in weighted graphs. The point of Kruskal’s theorem is
that the proof of it actually furnishes an algorithm for ﬁnding a minimal spanning
tree. Such an algorithm is known in Computer Science as Kruskal’s algorithm or
greedy algorithm.
Proposition 5.36 (Kruskal) If G is a weighted graph, then G has minimal span-
ning trees.
Proof Form a subgraph T of G according to the following algorithm:
(i) Choose an edge of G with least possible weight and put it in T .
(ii) After having chosen a certain number of edges of G for T , take, among the
edges not chosen yet, one of minimum weight and whose inclusion in T does
not generate cycles.
(iii) Repeat step (ii) as long as possible.
Firstly, note that the steps above give, as result, a spanning tree T of G. Indeed,
T is certainly acyclic; it is also connected (and thus a tree), for otherwise we could,
due to the connectedness of G, execute the algorithm one further time. Moreover,
if T was not spanning, there would exist in G a vertex u not belonging to T but
adjacent to some vertex v of T . Without loss of generality, we may assume that u
and v are such that w({u, v}) is minimal, among all possible choices of u and v as
above. Hence, the algorithm would continue with the inclusion of the edge {u, v} in
T , which is an absurd.
Now, we let S be another spanning tree of G, and will show that w(T ) ≤w(S).
Since S and T have the same number of edges (cf. Problem 3), there exists an
edge ϵ of T such that ϵ does not belong to S. Again by Problem 3, the inclusion of ϵ
in S generates a cycle C; but since T is a tree, there exists some edge ϵ′ in C, distinct
from ϵ and not belonging to T . In particular, ϵ′ is in S.
We claim that w(ϵ) ≤w(ϵ′). Indeed, if w(ϵ) > w(ϵ′), then, upon executing
Kruskal’s algorithm, at the step we chose ϵ we would have chosen ϵ′, for it would
have a smaller weight. However, since ϵ′ is not in T , this gives a contradiction.
Since w(ϵ) ≤w(ϵ′), changing ϵ′ by ϵ in S, we obtain a new generating tree S1,
such that w(S1) ≤w(S) and S1 and T have one more edge in common than S and
T do. If T has k edges not belonging to S, then, repeating the above reasoning more
k −1 times, we obtain a sequence S1, S2, . . . , Sk of spanning trees such that Sk = T

148

and
w(Sk) ≤· · · ≤w(S1) ≤w(S).
Thus, w(T ) ≤w(S).
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by counting the number of labelled trees (cf. Remark 5.13)
with a given number of vertices and a given set of labels. This result is due to
the nineteenth century English mathematician Arthur Cayley and, for the sake of
simplicity, we omit the set of labels from its statement.
Theorem 5.37 (Cayley)
There are exactly nn−2 labelled trees of n vertices.
Proof The given formula is trivially true for n = 1 and n = 2. Assume n > 2 and,
without loss of generality, that the vertices of the trees will be labelled 1, 2, . . . , n.
Let an be the total number of such trees and, for 1 ≤i ≤n, let Ai stands for the set
of them such that the vertex with label i is a leaf. Since it is impossible that all of
the n vertices are leaves, the inclusion-exclusion principle (cf. Theorem 2.1) gives
an = |A1 ∪. . . ∪An|

Now, given integers 1 ≤k ≤n and 1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤n, note that Ai1 ∩. . . ∩
Aik is the set of trees in which vertices i1, i2, . . . , ik are leaves. If T stands for one
such tree, then
Ti1i2...ik := T −{i1, i2, . . . , ik}
is a tree with n−k vertices, with labels in In\{i1, i2, . . . , ik}. The key to count |Ai1 ∩
. . .∩Aik| is to look at how T can be reconstructed from Ti1i2...ik. To understand this,
note that for a ﬁxed 1 ≤j ≤k vertex ij must be joined to one of the n −k vertices
of Ti1i2...ik; since the involved choices are independent, we conclude that there are
exactly (n −k)k possible ways of choosing the vertices of Ti1i2...ik to which vertices
i1, i2,. . . , ik will link themselves. Since there are an−k possibilities for Ti1i2...ik, we
therefore conclude that
|Ai1 ∩. . . ∩Aik| = (n −k)kan−k.
(5.8)
In the above formula, note that the right hand side depends solely on k, but not
on i1, i2, . . . , ik. Since there are exactly

5.4
Independent Sets and Cliques
This last section on graphs is devoted to a somewhat more detailed study of complete
subgraphs of a given graph, and is partially based on the classnotes [16]. I kindly
acknowledge professor Samuel B. Feitosa for having allowed me to use them.
Given a graph G, recall that a nonempty subset A of V (G) is said to be
independent if any two vertices in A are nonadjacent. If G has n vertices, we can
partition V (G) in n sets (each set consisting of a single vertex) such that each one of
them is independent. Then, there exists a least natural number k such that V (G) can
be partitioned into k independent sets. We name such a natural number according to
the following

5.4
Independent Sets and Cliques
151
Deﬁnition 5.38 Given a graph G, its chromatic number, denoted X(G), is the
least natural number k such that the set of vertices of G can be partitioned into k
independent sets.
The reason for the word chromatic in the above deﬁnition is due to the fact that,
if X(G) = k and V (G) = A1 ∪. . . ∪Ak, with A1, . . . , Ak independent sets, then,
painting the vertices in Ai with a color ci (where c1, . . . , ck are distinct colors),
we obtain a coloring of the vertices of G in which any two adjacent vertices have
distinct colors; conversely, if k is the least possible number of distinct colors for
which there exists a coloring of the vertices of G with k distinct colors and with
no adjacent vertices of the same color, then the sets formed by the vertices of each
color are k independent sets that partition V (G).
Examples 5.39
(a) If G is a bipartite graph (cf. Problem 16, page 133) with at least one edge, it is
immediate to see that X(G) = 2.
(b) If G is a 2-cycle with n vertices, then it is clear that X(G) = 2 if n is even
(for we can color the vertices by alternating two colors along the cycle), but
X(G) = 3 if n is odd (for in this case we need a third color for the last vertex
of the cycle).
Generalizing item (b) of the above example, the proof of the coming proposition
describes a rather simple algorithm which guarantees that if no vertex of a graph has
degree greater than k, then its chromatic number is at most k +1. In all that follows,
given a graph G we let
(G) = max{dG(u); u ∈V (G)}
and say that (G) is the maximum degree in G.
Proposition 5.40 In every graph G, we have X(G) ≤(G) + 1.
Proof Let (G) = n and ﬁx n + 1 distinct colors. Start by painting an arbitrary
vertex of G with one of the colors. Then, assume that, at some moment, k < n
vertices of G have been painted with the n + 1 given colors and in such a way that
adjacent vertices have distinct colors. Choose a vertex u that has not been painted
yet. Since dG(u) ≤(G) = n, at most n of the given colors were used to paint
vertices adjacent to u; hence, we are left with at least one of the n+1 colors to paint
u, so that it has a color distinct from those of all of its neighbors.
⊓⊔
The following deﬁnition furnishes a lower bound for the chromatic number of a
graph.

152

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Deﬁnition 5.41 An n-clique in a graph G is a subgraph of G which is isomorphic
to Kn. The clique number of G, denoted ω(G), is the greatest integer n ≥0 such
that G contains an n-clique.7
Since one needs n distinct colors to color the vertices of Kn in such a way that
no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we have
X(G) ≥ω(G),
for every graph G. On the other hand, we can estimate ω(G) upon the intuition that,
if a graph has lots of edges (when compared to its number of vertices), then ω(G)
must be large. Let us take a look at a relevant
Example 5.42 Let G be a connected graph with n > 1 vertices. If G has more than
⌊n2
4 ⌋edges, then ω(G) ≥3.
Proof By contraposition, assume that G does not contain a K3.
Let u be a vertex of G with maximum degree, say k. We can assume that k > 1,
for, otherwise, Euler’s Theorem 5.5 would give us at most n
2 edges in G, and this
would contradict the fact that n
2 < ⌊n2
4 ⌋+ 1 for n > 1.
Since G has no K3, the k vertices of G adjacent to u form an independent set.
Therefore, every edge of G which is not incident to u is incident to some of the
n −k −1 vertices of G not belonging to NG(u) ∪{u}. However, since each one of
these n −k −1 vertices has degree less than or equal to k, we conclude that G has
at most
k + (n −1 −k)k = −k2 + nk
edges.
In order to ﬁnish the proof, it sufﬁces to note that
Z ∋−k2 + nk ≤n2
4 ,
so that we must have −k2 + nk ≤⌊n2
4 ⌋.
⊓⊔
The coming problem brings an interesting application of the previous one.
Example 5.43 (China) Given distinct real numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn, prove that there
exists at most ⌊n2
4 ⌋ordered pairs (xi, xj) such that 1 < |xi −xj| < 2.
7We call the reader’s attention for not confusing notations w(G) for the weight of a weighted graph
and ω(G) for the clique number of a graph; the ﬁrst uses the Latin letter w, whereas the second
uses the Greek letter ω ( omega).

5.4
Independent Sets and Cliques
153
Proof Construct a graph G having the xi’s as vertices, with xi adjacent to xj if and
only if 1 < |xi −xj| < 2. We claim that G does not contain K3’s. Indeed, if xi, xj
and xk were the vertices of a K3 in G, with xi < xj < xk, say, then
xk −xi = (xk −xj) + (xj −xi) > 1 + 1 = 2,
which is a contradiction. Therefore, by the previous example we conclude that G
has at most ⌊n2
4 ⌋edges.
⊓⊔
In order to generalize the reasoning of Example 5.42 from K3’s to Kl’s, let us
ﬁrstly construct a generic example of a graph with n vertices and without Kl’s. To
this end, we start by assuming that l ≤n, for otherwise there is nothing to do; then,
we use the division algorithm (cf. Proposition 6.7) to write
n = (l −1)q + r,
with 0 ≤r < l−1. Then, partition the set of n vertices into l−1 subsets A1, A2,. . . ,
Al−1, such that
|A1| = . . . = |Ar| = q + 1 and |Ar+1| = . . . = |Al−1| = q;
that it is possible to get such a partition follows from the equality r(q +1)+(l −r −
1)q = (l −1)q +r = n. Continuing, impose that each Ai be an independent set, and
also that each vertex of Ai is adjacent to each vertex of Aj, for all 1 ≤i, j ≤l −1,
with i ̸= j. The graph G thus obtained is called a Turán graph, after the Hungarian
mathematician of the twentieth century Paul Turán, to whom we owe part of the
material of this section.
The Turán graph just constructed does not contain any Kl, since a Kl contains
l-cycles, whereas G does not contain any such cycle. On the other hand, by counting
how many edges of Kn are not present in G, we conclude that it has exactly
T (n; l) :=
n

edges. Substituting q = n−r
l−1 and doing some elementary algebra, we get
T (n; l) = n2(l −2) −r(l −1 −r)
2(l −1)
,
(5.9)
even though ω(G) < l.
The coming result (cf. [39]) assures that, if G is a graph with n vertices and such
that ω(G) < l, then G must have at most T (n; l) edges.
Theorem 5.44 (Turán)
If a graph G of n vertices has more than T (n; l) edges,
then ω(G) ≥l.

154

A Glimpse on Graph Theory
Proof In the notations of the preceding discussion, let us make a proof by induction
on q, assuming that r and l are ﬁxed. If q = 0, then n = r and it follows from (5.9)
that
T (n; l) = n2(l −2) −n(l −1 −n)

theorem is vacuously true.8
Now, consider a graph G with n vertices, without Kl’s and with the largest
possible number of edges. Clearly, G contains a Kl−1, for otherwise we could add
at least one more edge to G and it would still contain no Kl. Let H be a Kl−1 in G,
and A be the set of the remaining n −l + 1 vertices of G (i.e., those not belonging
to H). There are three kinds of edges in G:
•
The edges of H: overall,
l−1


edges.
•
The edges joining vertices in A to vertices in H: since G contains no Kl’s, each
vertex in A is adjacent to at most l −2 vertices in H. This gives us at most
(n −l + 1)(l −2) edges of this kind.
•
The edges of the induced subgraph G|A (cf. Problem 12, page 132): since G|A
does not contain Kl’s too, and n −l + 1 = (q −1)(l −1) + r, we can apply the
induction hypothesis to G|A, so that G|A has at most T (n −l + 1; l) edges.
Therefore, the graph G has at most
T (n −l + 1; l) + (n −l + 1)(l −2) +
l −1

edges.
Finally, substituting the formula for T (n −l + 1; l) (obtained from (5.9)) and
performing some elementary algebra once more, we get
T (n −l + 1; l) + (n −l + 1)(l −2) +

= T (n; l),
so that G has at most T (n; l) edges.

5.4
Independent Sets and Cliques
155
A nice way of grasping the details of the proof of Turán’s theorem is to rework it
in the particular case (l −1) | n. In this respect, we refer the reader to Problems 2
and 5.
We ﬁnish this section by examining yet another invariant of a graph G, one which
is closely related to ω(G).
Deﬁnition 5.45 Given a graph G, its independence number, denoted α(G), is the
number of elements of a maximal independent set of vertices of G.
For the coming proposition, the reader may ﬁnd it useful to recall the concept of
complementary graph (cf. Problem 9, page 132).
Proposition 5.46 Let a graph G and a nonempty subset A of the set of vertices of
G be given. The subgraph of G induced by A is a clique in G if and only if A is an
independent set in G. In particular,
ω(G) = α(G) and ω(G) = α(G).
Proof The ﬁrst part follows immediately from the deﬁnitions. For the second part,
it sufﬁces to use the fact that G = G.
⊓⊔
Example 5.47 Let G be a graph with nine vertices. Suppose that, given any ﬁve of
the vertices of G, there exist at least two edges with both endpoints among them.
Compute the least possible number of edges G can have.
Proof We consider two cases separately:
(a) ω(G) ≥4: ﬁx a K4 in G and let A be the set formed by the vertices of this K4.
Then, A is independent in G and, if u is one of the ﬁve remaining vertices, the
stated condition assures that u is adjacent to at least two of the vertices in A.
Thus, we conclude that G has at least 5 · 2 = 10 edges.
(b) ω(G) ≤3: by Turán’s theorem, G has at most T (9; 4) = 27 edges and, hence
G has at least
9
2

−27 = 9 edges.
For an example of such a G with 9 edges, take the union of three pairwise disjoint
K3’s. Given ﬁve vertices in G, there are two possibilities: either three of these ﬁve
vertices form one of the K3’s of G, or we choose the ﬁve vertices by taking two
vertices of two of the K3’s of G, together with one vertex of the third K3. In any
case, there are at least two edges of G having both of its endpoints among the ﬁve
vertices.
⊓⊔

items:
(a) If at least 2q −1 edges depart from u or v to the remaining 2q −2 vertices,
use the pigeonhole principle to guarantee that G has a K3 of the form uvw.
(b) If at most 2q −2 edges depart from u or v to the remaining 2q −2 vertices,
apply an appropriate induction hypothesis to G −{u, v} (cf. Problem 11,

Chapter 6
Divisibility
This chapter is devoted to the elementary properties concerning the relation of
divisibility in the set of integers, with a particular emphasis on the division
algorithm, on the notion of greatest common divisor and the fundamental role
played by prime numbers. In spite of the elementary character of the arguments
we shall use, we will meet several interesting problems and results along the way,
like Bézout’s theorem on the characterization of the greatest common divisor of two
integers and Euclid’s theorem on the inﬁnitude of primes.
6.1
The Division Algorithm
We start by isolating our central object of study, namely, the relation of divisibility
between two integers.
Deﬁnition 6.1 Given a, b ∈Z, with b ̸= 0, we say that b divides a, and write b | a,
if there exists c ∈Z such that a = bc. In case b doesn’t divide a, we write b ∤a.
Let b be a nonzero integer. If b divides a, we also say that b is a divisor of a,
that a is divisible by b or that a is a multiple of b. If b | a and b > 0, then b is a
positive divisor of a. Note that every nonzero integer is a divisor of itself and of 0.
Also, ±1 divide every integer.
The coming example starts by formalizing two concepts we are certainly familiar
with.
Example 6.2 An integer n is even provided it is a multiple of 2; otherwise, n is said
to be odd. According to Deﬁnition 6.1, the even integers are precisely those which
can be written in the form 2k, for some k ∈Z, i.e., the integers
. . . , −6, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . .

Divisibility
The remaining integers, namely,
. . . , −5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . . ,
are the odd ones. Thus, every odd integer is one plus an even integer, so that can be
generically denoted by writing 2k + 1, where k ∈Z.
The next example isolates an application of a simple algebraic identity which
will be quite useful for us.
Example 6.3 Let a and b be two given integers and k be a natural number.
(a) If a ̸= b, then (a −b) | (ak −bk).
(b) If a ̸= −b and k is odd, then (a + b) | (ak + bk).
Proof Standard basic algebra (cf. problem 2.1.18 of [8], for instance) gives
ak −bk = (a −b)(ak−1 + ak−2b + · · · + abk−2 + bk−1)
and, for odd k,
ak + bk = (a + b)(ak−1 −ak−2b + · · · −abk−2 + bk−1).
Since both ak−1+ak−2b+· · ·+abk−2 +bk−1 and ak−1 −ak−2b+· · ·−abk−2 +
bk−1 are integers, it sufﬁces to recall Deﬁnition 6.1.
⊓⊔
Example 6.4 Prove that, for every k natural, 10k −1 is divisible by 9.
Proof It sufﬁces to apply item (a) of the previous example: 10k −1 = 10k −1k is
divisible by 10 −1 = 9. Alternatively, note that

The following proposition establishes some basic properties of the relation of
divisibility. The reader should make an effort to keep them in mind for future use.
Proposition 6.5 Let a, b, c be nonzero integers and x, y be any integers.
(a) If b | a and a | b, then a = ±b.
(b) If c | b and b | a, then c | a.

6.1
The Division Algorithm
159
(c) If c | a and c | b, then c | (ax + by).
(d) If b | a, then |b| ≤|a|.
(e) If c | b, then c | ab.
(f) If b | a, then bc | ac.
Proof
(a) If a′ and b′ are integers such that a = ba′ and b = ab′, then a = (ab′)a′ =
a(a′b′), so that a′b′ = 1. Therefore, a′ = ±1, and it follows that a = ±b.
(b) If a = ba′ and b = cb′, with a′, b′ ∈Z, then a = (cb′)a′ = c(a′b′), with
a′b′ ∈Z. Thus, c | a.
(c) Let a = ca′ and b = cb′, with a′, b′ ∈Z. Then ax + by = ca′x + cb′y =
c(a′x + b′y), with a′x + b′y ∈Z. We conclude that c | (ax + by).
(d) Let a = ba′, with a′ ∈Z. Then, a ̸= 0 ⇒a′ ̸= 0, and hence |a′| ≥1. This
gives |a| = |ba′| = |b||a′| ≥|b|.
(e) If b = cb′, with b′ ∈Z, then ab = c(ab′), with ab′ ∈Z. Therefore, c | ab.
(f) If a = ba′, with a′ ∈Z, then ac = (bc)a′, and hence bc | ac.
⊓⊔
Remarks 6.6
i. As a particular case of item (c) of the previous proposition, if c | a and c | b,
then c | (a ± b). We shall use this remark several times in what follows.
ii. Item (c) of the previous proposition can be easily generalized to prove that, if
c | a1, . . . , an, then c | (a1x1 + · · · + anxn) for all x1, . . . , xn ∈Z.
iii. It follows from item (d) above that every nonzero integer has only a ﬁnite
number of divisors.
We continue by recalling that the integer part ⌊x⌋of x ∈R is deﬁned by
⌊x⌋= max{n ∈Z; n ≤x}.
(6.1)
In other words, given n ∈Z,
⌊x⌋= n ⇔n ≤x < n + 1.
(6.2)
For instance, since 1 <
√
2 < 2 we have ⌊
√
2⌋= 1; on the other hand, since
−3 < −2.3 < −2, then ⌊−2.3⌋= −3.
Our next result is usually referred to as the division algorithm1 for integers, and
is one of the cornerstones of the basic theory of divisibility.
Proposition 6.7 Given a, b ∈Z, with b ̸= 0, there exist unique q, r ∈Z such that
a = bq + r and 0 ≤r < |b|. Moreover, if b > 0, then
1At this point, the reader may wish to take another look at the deﬁnition of algorithm, at the
footnote of page 116.

b.
(6.3)
Such integers q and r are respectively called the quotient and the remainder upon
division of a by b.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that b > 0, and let q be the greatest integer such that bq ≤a.
Then bq ≤a < b(q+1), so that 0 ≤a−bq < b and it sufﬁces to deﬁne r = a−bq.
Note also that, since
q ≤a
b < q + 1,
such an integer q is precisely
- a
b
.
.
If b < 0, then −b > 0, so that there exist q, r ∈Z for which a = (−b)q′ + r,
with 0 ≤r < −b. Hence, a = b(−q′)+r, with 0 ≤r < −b = |b|. Make q = −q′.
Now, suppose that a = bq+r = bq′+r′, with q, q′, r, r′ ∈Z and 0 ≤r, r′ < |b|.
Then,
|r′ −r| < |b| and b(q −q′) = r′ −r.
If q ̸= q′, then |q −q′| ≥1, so that
|b| ≤|b| · |q −q′| = |r′ −r| < |b|,
a contradiction. Therefore, q = q′ and hence r = r′.
⊓⊔
The proof of the following corollary illustrates a typical application of the
division algorithm. For its statement, recall that a nonnegative integer m is a perfect
square provided m = n2, for some nonnegative integer n.
Corollary 6.8 Every perfect square leaves remainder:
(a) 0 or 1 upon division by 3.
(b) 0 or 1 upon division by 4.
(c) 0, 1 or 4 upon division by 8.
Proof Let n be a natural number.
(a) By the division algorithm, n leaves remainder 0, 1 or 2 upon division by 3, so
that n = 3q, 3q + 1 or 3q + 2, for some q ∈Z. Now, let’s consider these three
possibilities:
•
If n = 3q, then n2 = 3 · 3q2.
•
If n = 3q + 1, then n2 = 3(3q2 + 2q) + 1.
•
If n = 3q + 2, then n2 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1) + 1.
Since 3q2 ∈Z, the uniqueness part of the division algorithm assures that, in
the ﬁrst case above, n2 leaves remainder 0 upon division by 3. By the same
argument, in the other two cases n2 leaves remainder 1 upon division by 3.

6.1
The Division Algorithm
161
(b) By the division algorithm, the remainder upon division of n by 4 is 0, 1, 2 or
3, so that n = 4q,4q + 1, 4q + 2 or 4q + 3, for some q ∈Z. Hence, we can
certainly give to this item a proof that parallels that of (a). Nevertheless, let’s
see a simpler one: again by invoking the division algorithm (or Example 6.2),
we can write n = 2q or 2q + 1, for some q ∈Z.
•
If n = 2q, then n2 = 4q2.
•
If n = 2q + 1, then n2 = 4(q2 + q) + 1.
Hence, upon division by 4, in the ﬁrst case n2 leaves remainder 0, whereas in
the second it leaves remainder 1.
(c) Once more, we could give a proof of this fact as a direct application of the
division algorithm, by writing n = 8q + r for some q ∈Z and some r ∈
{0, 1, 2, . . . , 7}. However, in order to avoid having to consider eight different
cases, we proceed as in the proof of item (b):
•
If n = 2q, then n2 = 4q2. Now, there are two possibilities:
– If q2 is even, say q2 = 2k for some k ∈N, then n2 = 8k.
– If q2 is odd, say q2 = 2k + 1 for some k ∈N, then n2 = 8k + 4.
•
If n = 2q + 1, then n2 = 4q(q + 1) + 1. However, since one of the integers
q and q + 1 is even, in any case the product q(q + 1) is even, so that we can
write q(q + 1) = 2k for some k ∈N. Then, n2 = 4 · 2k + 1 = 8k + 1.
Finally, as in the proof of the previous items, the expressions for n2 obtained
above guarantee that its possible remainders upon division by 8 are exactly 0, 1
or 4.
⊓⊔
The following elaboration of the division algorithm with play an important role
in subsequent discussions.
Corollary 6.9 Let a1, a2 and b be given integers, with b being nonzero. Then, b |
(a1 −a2) if and only if a1 and a2 leave equal remainders upon division by b.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that a1 = bq1 + r and a2 = bq2 + r, with q1, q2, r ∈Z. Then,
a1 −a2 = b(q1 −q2), i.e., b | (a1 −a2).
Conversely, assume that b | (a1 −a2) and let a1 = bq1 + r1 and a2 = bq2 + r2,
with q1, q2, r1, r2 ∈Z and 0 ≤r1, r2 < |b|. Then,
a1 −a2 = (q1 −q2)b + (r1 −r2)
and, since b | (a1 −a2) and b | (q1 −q2)b, item (c) of Proposition 6.5 guarantees
that b divides r1 −r2 = (a1 −a2) −(q1 −q2)b. On the other hand, inequalities
0 ≤r1, r2 < |b| give |r1 −r2| < |b|, so that the only possibility for b dividing
r1 −r2 is having |r1 −r2| = 0 or, which is the same, r1 = r2.
⊓⊔
As an application of the previous result, the coming example computes the
possible values of the last digit of a perfect square.

162
6
Divisibility
Example 6.10 Every perfect square ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.
Proof First of all, notice that the remainder of a natural number upon division by 10
coincides with its last digit (i.e., the rightmost one, in the decimal representation of
the number). Indeed, let m = 10m′ + a0, with m′ ∈Z+ and 0 ≤a0 ≤9; since 10m′
ends in 0, it follows that the decimal representation of the sum 10m′ + a0 (which
equals m) has a0 as rightmost digit.
Now, let n ∈N and q, r ∈Z be such that n = 10q + r, with 0 ≤r ≤9. Then,
n2 = (10q + r)2 = 100q2 + 20qr + r2
= 10(10k2 + 2kr) + r2,
so that 10 | (n2 −r2), and Corollary 6.9 guarantees that n2 and r2 leave equal
remainders upon division by 10. Hence, our initial remark assures that the last digit
of n2 equals that of r2.
In order to ﬁnish the proof, it sufﬁces to check which are the possible values of
the last digit of r2 when r varies from 0 to 9: 02 = 0; 12 and 92 end in 1; 22 and
82 end in 4; 32 and 72 end in 9; 42 and 62 end in 6; 52 ends in 5. Thus, the possible
values of the last digit of n2 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.
⊓⊔
Example 6.11 Let n > 1 be an integer. Show that any sequence of n consecutive
integers contains exactly one multiple of n.
Proof Let a + 1, a + 2, . . . , a + n be a sequence of n consecutive integers, with
a = nq + r, 0 ≤r < n. Then, 0 < n −r ≤n, so that a + (n −r) is one of the
numbers of our sequence. Now, note that
a + (n −r) = (nq + r) + (n −r) = n(q + 1),
which is a multiple of n.
To what is left to do, we shall apply again the result of Corollary 6.9: the numbers
a + 1, a + 2, . . . , a + n leave pairwise disjoint remainders upon division by n, since
the modulus of the difference between any two of them is at least 1 and at most
n −1. Therefore, our sequence contains at most one multiple of n.

GCD and LCM
We say that a nonzero integer d is a common divisor of given nonzero integers
a1, . . . , an if d | a1, . . . , d | an. Note that a1, . . . , an always have common divisors:
1, for instance. Moreover, since every nonzero integer has only a ﬁnite number
of divisors, a1, . . . , an have only a ﬁnite number of common divisors. Thus, the
following deﬁnition makes sense.
Deﬁnition 6.12 The greatest common divisor of the nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . ,
an, denoted gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an), is (as its name says) the greatest one of the common
divisors of a1, a2, . . . , an. Nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an are said to be pairwise
coprime or relatively prime, if gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an) = 1.
The coming result is due to the French mathematician Étienne Bézout.3 For its
statement, given n ∈Z we let nZ denote the set of integer multiples of n, namely,
nZ = {nx; x ∈Z} = {0, ±n, ±2n, ±3n, . . .}.
Theorem 6.13 (Bézout)
Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero integers. If
S =

,
then S = dZ, with d = gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an). In particular, there exist u1, u2, . . . ,
un ∈Z such that
gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an) = a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun.
(6.4)
3French mathematician of the eighteenth century, Bézout is one of the precursors of the area of
Mathematics known today as Algebraic Geometry. In spite of the coming result, his most famous
theorem is probably the one which states that, if f and g are real polynomials in two indeterminates
X, Y, with no common factors and with degrees respectively equal to m and n, then the number of
points of intersection of the curves f (x, y) = 0 and g(x, y) = 0 in the cartesian plane is at most
mn—for example, two distinct ellipses have at most 2·2 = 4 points in common. For an elementary
exposition, we recommend [18] or [31].

Divisibility
Proof It’s immediate to see that every multiple of an element of S belongs to S, i.e.,
u ∈S ⇒uZ ⊂S.
(6.5)
On the other hand, since d divides a1x1+a2x2+· · ·+anxn for all x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈Z,
we certainly have S ⊂dZ.
In order to establish the opposite inclusion, note ﬁrst that S does contain positive
integers; indeed, by choosing x1 = a1 and x2 = · · · = xn = 0, for instance, we
conclude that
a2
1 = a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn ∈S.
Since S contains positive integers, there exists a least positive integer d′ in S. If
we show that d′ = d, we will get d ∈S, and (6.5) (with d in place of u) will give
dZ ⊂S.
We ﬁrst claim that d′ | a1, . . . , an. Indeed, since d′ ∈S, there exist u1, u2, . . . ,
un ∈Z such that d′ = a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun. Now, let a1 = d′q + r, with
q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < d′. Then,
r = a1 −d′q
= a1 −(a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun)q
= a1(1 −u1q) + a2(−u2q) + · · · + an(−unq),
so that r ∈S. If 0 < r < d′, we would get a contradiction to the fact that d′
is the least positive integer in S. Therefore, r = 0 and d′ | a1. Analogously, d′ |
a2, . . . , an.
Finally, since d′ is a common divisor of a1, a2, . . . , an, in order to get d′ = d is
sufﬁces to show that d′ ≥d. To this end, if a1 = dq1, a2 = dq2, . . . , an = dqn,
with q1, q2, . . . , qn ∈Z, then
d′ = a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun
= dq1u1 + dq2u2 + · · · + dqnun
= d(q1u1 + q2u2 + · · · + qnun),
so that 0 < d | d′. Thus, d ≤d′.
⊓⊔
Remark 6.14 In the notations of Bézout’s theorem, one uses to say, thanks to (6.4),
that gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an) is a linear combination of a1, a2, . . . , an, with integer
coefﬁcients. For the time being, we shall concentrate on the existence of such
a way of representing gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an). However, an actual way of getting
u1, u2, . . . , un ∈Z as in (6.4) will be an easy consequence of Euclid’s algorithm
(cf. Proposition 6.27), together with item (b) of Corollary 6.23.

In what follows, we collect several useful consequences of the previous theorem.
Corollary 6.15 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero integers with gcd equal to d. If d′ ∈
N, then d′ | a1, a2, . . . , an if and only if d′ | d.
Proof Take integers u1, u2, . . . , un such that d = a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun. Since
d′ | a1, a2, . . . , an, item i. of Remarks 6.6 guarantees that d′ | d. The converse is
immediate.
⊓⊔
Corollary 6.16 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero given integers with gcd equal to d.
(a) d = 1 if and only if there exist integers u1, u2, . . . , un such that a1u1 + a2u2 +
· · · + anun = 1.
(b) gcd
 a1
d , a2
d , . . . , an
d

= 1.
Proof
(a) If d = 1, the existence of such integers u1, u2, . . . , un follows from Bézout’s
theorem. Conversely, let u1, u2, . . . , un be a set of integers satisfying the stated
conditions. Since d | a1, a2, . . . , an, it follows once more from item i. of
Remarks 6.6 that d | (a1u1 + · · · + anun), i.e., d | 1. Thus, d = 1.
(b) Letting d = a1u1 + a2u2 + · · · + anun, we have
 a1
d

u1 + · · · +
 an
d

un = 1.
Therefore, the desired result follows directly from item (a).
⊓⊔
Example 6.17 (China) Let a, b, c and d be nonzero integers, such that c + d ̸= 0
and ad −bc = 1. Prove that a+b
c+d is an irreducible fraction.
Proof We wish to prove that gcd(a + b, c + d) = 1. To this end, and according to
the previous corollary, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd integers u and v such that
(a + b)u + (c + d)v = 1.
Since ad −bc = 1, one readily notices that u = d and v = −b is a possible choice.
⊓⊔
Remark 6.18 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero integers with gcd equal to d. Letting
ui = ai
d for 1 ≤i ≤n, item (b) of the previous corollary assures that u1, u2, . . . , un
are relatively prime integers, for which a1 = du1, a2 = du2, . . . , an = dun.
The above remark gives a way of writing nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an which
will reveal itself to be useful in a number of situations. The two coming examples
stress this point.
Example 6.19 Every nonzero rational number can be written as an irreducible
fraction, i.e., has a fractional representation of the form a
b, where a and b are
nonzero relatively prime integers. Indeed, let r be a nonzero rational number and
r = m
n be a fractional representation of it. Then, m and n are nonzero integers and,
letting d = gcd(m, n), we get m = da and n = db, with gcd(a, b) = 1. This gives

r = m
n = da
db = a

which gives the desired fractional representation of r.
Example 6.20 (Russia) Let a and b be natural numbers such that a+1

a
∈N.
Prove that
gcd(a, b) ≤
√
a + b.
Proof Let d = gcd(a, b), so that there exist integers u and v such that a = du,
b = dv and gcd(u, v) = 1. Then,
a + 1

dv
+ dv + 1
du
= u(du + 1) + v(dv + 1)
duv

duv
∈N.
In turn, this assures that
uv · d(u2 + v2) + (u + v)
duv
= (u2 + v2) + u + v
d
is also a natural number. Hence, d | (u + v), so that d ≤u + v. But this gives
d2 ≤du + dv = a + b.
⊓⊔
Corollary 6.21 Given nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an, k, we have:
(a) gcd(ka1, ka2, . . . , kan) = |k| gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an).
(b) gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an) = gcd(gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an−1), an).
Proof
(a) Let d = gcd(a1, . . . , an) and d′ = gcd(ka1, . . . , kan). Since d divides all of
a1, . . . , an, we conclude that |k|d divides all of ka1, . . . , kan, so that |k|d is a
positive common divisor of ka1, . . . , kan. However, since d′ is the largest of
such common divisors, it follows that |k|d ≤d′. Conversely, since k divides
d′ and d′ divides all of ka1, . . . , kan, we get that d′
|k| is a positive integer which
divides all of a1, . . . , an. This gives d′
|k| ≤d or, which is the same, d′ ≤|k|d.
Therefore, d′ = |k|d.

6.2
GCD and LCM
169
(b) Let d = gcd(a1, . . . , an) and d′ = gcd(gcd(a1, a2, . . . , an−1), an). Since d |
a1, . . . , an−1, we get from Corollary 6.15 that d | gcd(a1, . . . , an−1). Then, d
divides both gcd(a1, . . . , an−1) and an, so that (once again from Corollary 6.15)
d divides the gcd of these two numbers, that is, d | d′. A similar reasoning shows
that d′ | d, thus ﬁnishing the proof.
⊓⊔
We specialize our discussion to the greatest common divisor of two nonzero
integers. Given a, b ∈Z \ {0}, with d = gcd(a, b), Bézout’s theorem guarantees
the existence of integer u and v such that d = au + bv. It is important to note that
such a way of writing gcd(a, b) is not unique; actually, if t ∈Z, then we also have
d = a(u−tb)+b(v+ta). We shall have more to say about this in Proposition 6.26.
Later, we will establish a quite important and useful algorithm for effectively
ﬁnding the gcd of two nonzero given integers, namely, Euclid’s algorithm. We start
by studying some properties of the gcd of two nonzero integers.
Proposition 6.22 For any nonzero integers a, b and c, we have that:
(a) If c | ab and gcd(b, c) = 1, then c | a.
(b) If a + bc ̸= 0, then gcd(a + bc, b) = gcd(a, b).
(c) If gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = gcd(a, b).
(d) If c | b and gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, c) = 1.
(e) If gcd(b, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c). In particular, if b and
c are relatively prime and divide a, then bc divides a.
Proof
(a) Let u, v ∈Z be such that bu+cv = 1. Multiplying both sides of this equality by
a, we get (ab)u + c(av) = a. Finally, since c | (ab), item (c) of Proposition 6.5
shows that c | a.
(b) Let d = gcd(a + bc, b) and d′ = gcd(a, b). Since d′ | a, b, we have that
d′ | a, a + bc. Hence, by Corollary 6.15 we get d′ | d. Conversely, since
d | (a + bc) and d | b, we conclude that d | [(a + bc) −bc], i.e., d | a and
d | b. Again by Corollary 6.15, we obtain d | d′ and, thus, d = d′.
(c) Set d = gcd(a, b) and d′ = gcd(a, bc). From d | b it follows that d | bc.
Therefore, d | a and d | bc, so that d | gcd(a, bc) = d′. In order to ﬁnish,
let us show that d′ | d: since gcd(a, c) = 1, Bézout’s theorem guarantees the
existence of u, v ∈Z such that au + cv = 1. This way, a(bu) + (bc)v = b, and
such an equality, together with the fact that d′ | a and d′ | bc, proves that d′ | b.
Then, d′ | a and d′ | b, so that d′ | gcd(a, b) = d.
(d) Let d ∈Z be such that b = cd, and choose u, v ∈Z for which au + bv = 1.
Then, au + c(dv) = 1, and item (a) of Corollary 6.16 gives gcd(a, c) = 1.
(e) Once more, set d = gcd(a, b) and write a = du and b = dv, with u, v ∈Z
relatively prime. By successively applying Corollary 6.23 and the result of item
(c), we obtain
gcd(a, bc) = gcd(du, dvc) = d gcd(u, vc) = d gcd(u, c).

170
6
Divisibility
However, d | b and gcd(b, c) = 1 imply (cf. item (d)) gcd(d, c) = 1. Hence,
one further application of item (c) gives us
gcd(a, c) = gcd(du, c) = gcd(u, c).
Finally, taking together both relations above, we get
gcd(a, bc) = d · gcd(u, c) = gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c).
The rest is immediate.
⊓⊔
Corollary 6.23 Let a and b be nonzero integers and k, m and n be natural
numbers.
(a) If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(am, bn) = 1.
(b) If gcd(a, b) = 1 and ab = kn, then there exist u, v ∈Z such that a = un,
b = vn.
Proof
(a) Item (c) of the previous proposition, with bn−1 in place of b and b in place of c,
gives
gcd(a, bn) = gcd(a, bn−1 · b) = gcd(a, bn−1).
It follows by induction on n that gcd(a, bn) = gcd(a, b) = 1. Analogously,
gcd(am, bn) = gcd(am−1 · a, bn) = gcd(am−1, bn)
and, by induction on m, we get gcd(am, bn) = gcd(a, bn) = 1.
Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, Bézout’s theorem guarantees the exis-
tence of x, y ∈Z such that ax + by = 1. Hence, the formula for binomial
expansion gives
1 = (ax + by)n =

that gcd(a, bn) = 1. Starting from this last relation and arguing in an entirely
analogous way, we conclude that gcd(am, bn) = 1.
(b) Set u = gcd(a, k) and v = gcd(b, k). Since gcd(a, b) = 1, from item (d) of the
previous proposition we obtain
k = gcd(kn, k) = gcd(ab, k) = gcd(a, k) · gcd(b, k) = uv,

6.2

171
so that
ab = kn = unvn.
Now, u | a and gcd(a, b) = 1 give us (cf. item (d) of the former Proposition)
gcd(u, b) = 1; analogously, gcd(v, a) = 1. It thus follows from item (a) that
gcd(un, b) = 1 and gcd(vn, a) = 1.
Finally,
 un | ab and gcd(un, b) = 1 ⇒un | a ⇒un ≤a
vn | ab and gcd(vn, a) = 1 ⇒vn | b ⇒vn ≤b .
However, since ab = unvn, un ≤a and vn ≤b, the only possibility is to have
a = un and b = vn.
⊓⊔
We are now in position to prove a result which was already used in [8]. We
present it as the coming
Example 6.24 Given natural numbers n and k, with k > 1, either there exists m ∈N
such that n = mk or
k√n is an irrational number.
Proof Assume that
k√n
=
m
p , with m and p relatively prime naturals (cf.
Example 6.19). Then, pkn = mk, and condition gcd(m, p) = 1, together with
the results of the previous corollary, gives gcd(mk, pk) = 1. On the other hand,
pkn = mk assures that pk | mk. Therefore, the only way of pk and mk being
relatively prime is that pk = 1. However, since k > 1, we must then have p = 1, so
that n = mk.
⊓⊔
Roughly speaking (for now, any attempt of giving a more precise deﬁnition
would be useless), an equation in (more than one) integer variables is said to be
a diophantine equation.4 The analysis of general diophantine equation equations
is generally a very difﬁcult task, demanding quite sophisticated arguments to be
accomplished. We shall meet (and solve) several important examples of Diophantine
equations along the way. For the time being, let us take a look at a simple example.
Example 6.25 Prove that there does not exist x, y ∈N such that x3+3 = 4y(y+1).
Proof On the contrary, assume that x3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1) for some x, y ∈N. Then,
x3 + 4 = 4y(y + 1) + 1 = (2y + 1)2
4After Diophantus of Alexandria, Greek mathematician of the third century BC, who is considered
to be one of the founding fathers of Algebra and Number Theory. In his famous book Aritmetica,
Diophantus tried to systematically study integer solutions of certain particular kinds of polynomial
equations. These, in turn, passed to be deservedly known as diophantine.

172

Divisibility
and, hence,
x3 = (2y + 1)2 −22 = (2y −1)(2y + 3).
Now, if d = gcd(2y −1, 2y +3), then d is odd and divides (2y +3)−(2y −1) = 4,
so that d = 1. Therefore, the product of the relatively prime integers 2y −1 and
2y + 3 is a perfect cube, and Corollary 6.23 assures that 2y −1 and 2y + 3 must
themselves be perfect cubes. However, one cannot ﬁnd two perfect cubes whose
difference is equal to 4, so that we have reached a contradiction.
⊓⊔
In spite of the ad hoc character of the solution of the previous example, the theory
we have developed so far, on the gcd of two integers, allows us to completely solve
the diophantine linear equation in two variables ax + by = c. Here, x and y are
integer unknowns and a, b and c are given nonzero integer parameters.
Proposition 6.26 Let a, b and c be nonzero given integers. The equation ax +by =
c admits integer solutions if and only if gcd(a, b) | c. Moreover, if this is so and
d = gcd(a, b) and x = x0, y = y0 is some integer solution, then the formulas
x = x0 + b
d t, y = y0 −a
d t,
(6.6)
t ∈Z, give all possible integer solutions. In particular, if ab > 0 and x, y ∈Z is an
integer solution, then we can assume that x > 0 > y or x < 0 < y.
Proof Firstly, suppose that there exist x, y ∈Z for which ax + by = c. Since d | a
and d | b, it follows that d | (ax + by), i.e., d | c. Conversely, let c = de, with
e ∈Z, and (by Bézout’s theorem) u and v be integers such that d = au + bv. Then,
c = a · eu + b · ev, so that the given equation admits the integer solution x0 = eu,
y0 = ev.
For the second part, assume again that d | c, and let x = x0, y = y0 be some
integer solution of the given equation. If x = x1, y = y1 is another integer solution,
we must have a(x1 −x0) = b(y0 −y1); cancelling d out of both sides of such an
equality, we obtain
a
d (x1 −x0) = b
d (y0 −y1).
Thus, b
d | a
d (x1 −x0) and, since gcd
 a

= 1, item (a) of the previous proposition
guarantees that b
d | (x1 −x0). Letting x1 −x0 = b
d t, we get y0 −y1 = a
d t, and
the stated formulas easily follow. Conversely, it is immediate to verify that such
formulas do provide integer solutions to the given equation.
For what is left, assume that a, b > 0 (the remaining case a, b < 0 can be dealt
with in an analogous way), so that
x0 + b
d t > 0 ⇔t > −dx0

and y0 −a
d t < 0 ⇔t > dy0

one can show that we can take an integer solution x, y of the given equation with
x < 0 < y.
⊓⊔
Up to this moment, we only know that one can write the gcd of two nonzero
integers a and b as a linear combination au + bv, for some u, v ∈Z. However, we
still do not have at our disposal a method of effectively doing this. To remedy such a
situation, we consider the following algorithm, usually attributed to Euclid himself.
Euclid’s Algorithm
Step 1
: a
= bq1 + r1
0 < r1 < b
Step 2
: b
= r1q2 + r2
0 < r2 < r1
Step 3
: r1
= r2q3 + r3
0 < r3 < r2
· · ·
· · ·
Step j
: rj−2 = rj−1qj + rj
0 < rj < rj−1
Step j + 1 : rj−1 = rjqj+1 + 0
Note that the execution of the above algorithm actually stops after a ﬁnite number
of steps, for, since r1, r2, . . . are integers satisfying b > r1 > r2 > · · · ≥0, there
must exist a least index j such that rj is the last nonzero remainder in the sequence
of divisions above.
The importance of Euclid’s algorithm relies upon the following result.
Proposition 6.27 In the notations above, we have gcd(a, b) = rj.
Proof Several applications of item (b) of Proposition 6.22 give
gcd(a, b) = gcd(a −bq1, b) = gcd(r1, b)
= gcd(r1, b −r1q2) = gcd(r1, r2)
= gcd(r1 −r2q3, r2) = gcd(r3, r2)
· · ·
= gcd(rj−1, rj) = rj,
where, in the last equality above, we used the fact that rj | rj−1.
⊓⊔
Euclid’s algorithm provides a method for effectively ﬁnding a pair of integers u
and v whose existence is assured by Bézout’s theorem, i.e., such that gcd(a, b) =
au + bv. Let us see how to do this by looking at a numerical
Example 6.28 Use Euclid’s algorithm to show that gcd(120, 84) = 12. Then, solve
the linear diophantine equation 120x + 84y = 12.

174
6
Divisibility
Solution We start by executing Euclid’s algorithm:
120 = 84 · 1 + 36
84 = 36 · 2 + 12
36 = 12 · 3.
Since 12 is the last nonzero remainder, it follows from Proposition 6.27 that
gcd(120, 84) = 12.
We can now ﬁnd integers u and v such that 12 = 120u + 84v by working
backwards with the successive divisions that led us to the gcd:
12 = 84 · 1 −36 · 2
= 84 · 1 −(120 −84 · 1) · 2
= 84 · 1 −120 · 2 + 84 · 2
= 84 · 3 + 120(−2).
Finally, with the solution x0 = −2, y0 = 3 of 120x + 84y = 12 in our hands, we
can get all solutions by applying formulas (6.6):
x = −2 + (84/12)t = −2 + 7t;
y = 3 −(120/12)t = 3 −10t.
⊓⊔
Euclid’s algorithm and the proof of its correctedness (i.e., Proposition 6.27) are
also useful for theoretical purposes, as shown by the coming example.
Example 6.29 Let a, m and n be given natural numbers, with a > 1. If q, r ∈Z are
such that m = nq + r, with 0 ≤r < n, prove that
gcd(am −1, an −1) = agcd(m,n) −1.
Proof Let us start by showing that, if r = 0, then (an −1) | (am −1). To this end,
it sufﬁces to observe that am −1 = (an)q −1, and to recall that we already know,
from Example 6.3, that an −1 divides (an)q −1.
We now prove that, if r > 0, then gcd(am −1, an −1) = gcd(an −1, ar −1).
Indeed, letting an = b whenever convenient, we get
am −1 = anq+r −1 = (anq −1)ar + (ar −1)
= ((an)q −1)ar + (ar −1)
= (an −1)(bq−1 + · · · + b + 1)ar + (ar −1).

175
Letting
c = (bq−1 + bq−2 + · · · + b + 1)ar
d = gcd(am −1, an −1)
d′ = gcd(an −1, ar −1)
we get
am −1 = (an −1)c + (ar −1).
Hence, item (b) of Proposition 6.22 gives
gcd(am −1, an −1) = gcd((an −1)c + (ar −1), an −1)
= gcd(ar −1, an −1).
For what is left to do, assume, without loss of generality, that m ≥n. If m = n,
we are done. Assume, then, that m > n, and consider Euclid’s algorithm for m
and n:
m
= nq1 + r1
0 < r1 < n;
n
= r1q2 + r2
0 < r2 < r1;
r1
= r2q3 + r3
0 < r3 < r2;
· · ·
· · ·
rj−2 = rj−1qj + rj
0 < rj < rj−1;
rj−1 = rjqj+1 + 0.
Our previous discussion guarantee that
gcd(m, n) = gcd(n, r1) = gcd(r1, r2) = · · · = gcd(rj−1, rj) = rj.
Therefore, by applying the above reasoning several times, we get
gcd(am −1, an −1) = gcd(an −1, ar1 −1)
= gcd(ar1 −1, ar2 −1)
· · ·
= gcd(arj−1 −1, arj −1)
= arj −1 = agcd(m,n)−1.

We ﬁnish this section by studying the least common multiple of a ﬁnite set
of nonzero integers. Given nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an, the positive integer

Divisibility
|a1a2 . . . an| is a common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an. Therefore, there exists a least
positive integer which is a common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an, and this gives sense
to the following
Deﬁnition 6.30 Given nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an, the least common multiple
of a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted lcm (a1, a2, . . . , an), is the smallest positive integer which
is a common multiple of all of a1, a2, . . . , an.
The coming results establish the basic properties of the lcm .
Proposition 6.31 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero integers with lcm equal to m. An
integer M is a common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an if and only if m | M.
Proof Let M be a common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an and write M = mq + r, with
q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < m. Since a1 | m and a1 | M, it follows from Proposition 6.5
that a1 | (M −mq), i.e., a1 | r; analogously, a2, . . . , an | r, so that 0 ≤r < m is a
common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an. However, since m is the least (positive) common
multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an, the only left possibility is that r = 0. Hence, m | M.
⊓⊔
Lemma 6.32 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be nonzero integers and k
∈
N. Then,
lcm (ka1, ka2, . . . , kan) = k · lcm (a1, a2, . . . , an).
Proof If M = lcm (ka1, ka2, . . . , kan) and m = lcm (a1, a2, . . . , an), then km is a
positive common multiple of ka1, ka2,. . . , kan, so that km ≥M. On the other hand,
since M is a (positive) common multiple of ka1, ka2,. . . , kan, it follows that k | M
and M/k is a positive common multiple of a1, a2, . . . , an; therefore, M/k ≥m or,
which is the same, M ≥km. We conclude that M = km, as desired.
⊓⊔
Our next result relates the gcd and the lcm of two nonzero integers.
Proposition 6.33 If a and b are nonzero integers, then
gcd(a, b) · lcm (a, b) = |ab|.
Proof We shall begin by showing that gcd(a, b) = 1 ⇒lcm (a, b) = |ab|. To this
end, let m be a positive common multiple of a and b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, item
(e) of Proposition 6.22 guarantees that ab | m. Hence, m ≥|ab|, so that |ab| is the
smallest positive common multiple of a and b, i.e., |ab| = lcm (a, b).
For the general case, ﬁrst note that lcm (a, −b) = lcm (a, b); since we already
have gcd(a, −b) = gcd(a, b), we can assume, without loss of generality, that a, b >
0. Let d = gcd(a, b) and write a = du and b = dv, so that u and v are positive and
relatively prime integers. We wish to show that lcm (du, dv)d = d2uv or, by the
previous lemma, that lcm (u, v) = uv. But this is exactly what we have done in the
paragraph above.
⊓⊔
Example 6.34 (Japan) Find all pairs (a, b) of positive integers such that a ≥b and
lcm (a, b) + gcd(a, b) + a + b = ab.

6.2
GCD and LCM
177
Solution Set d = gcd(a, b), and let u, v ∈N be such that a = du and b = dv.
Then, a ≥b ⇒u ≥v and
d · lcm (a, b) = gcd(a, b) · lcm (a, b) = ab = d2uv,
so that lcm (a, b) = duv. Substituting these expressions in the original equation,
we conclude that it is equivalent to
u(v + 1) + (v + 1) = duv,
(6.7)
so that u | (v + 1). Thus, u ≤v + 1 and, therefore, u = v or u = v + 1. If u = v,
it follows from gcd(u, v) = 1 that u = v = 1, so that d = 4 and a = b = 4. If
u = v + 1, it follows from (6.7) that
d = u(v + 1) + (v + 1)
uv
= (v + 1)2 + (v + 1)
(v + 1)v
= v2 + 3v + 2
v2 + v
= 1 + 2
v ,
which in turn implies v = 1 or v = 2. By separately examining each of these cases,
we arrive at the remaining solutions: a = 6, b = 3 or a = 6, b = 4.

23. It is interesting to ask how efﬁcient Euclid’s algorithm is, upon computing the

6.3
Prime Numbers
An integer p > 1 is prime if its only positive divisors are 1 and p. An integer
a > 1 which is not prime is said to be composite. We shall prove in a few moments
(cf. Theorem 6.38) that the set of primes is inﬁnite. For the time being, and for the
reader’s convenience, we list below all prime numbers less than 50; their primalities
can be checked directly and without difﬁculty (see, also, the discussion below on the
Eratosthenes’ sieve):
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.
Our purpose in this section is to study the elementary properties of prime
numbers, paying special attention to their relation to composite numbers. We start
with the following auxiliary result, which is known as Euclid’s lemma.
Lemma 6.35 (Euclid) Every integer n > 1 can be written as a product of ﬁnitely
many primes, not necessarily distinct.6
Proof Let us make induction on n. For n = 2 there is nothing to do, for 2 is prime.
Now, let m > 2 be a given integer and assume that every integer n such that 2 ≤
5After Gabriel Lamé, French mathematician of the nineteenth century.
6Here, for the sake of simplifying the writing, we say that a prime is a product of one prime. This
is in accordance with the general deﬁnition of 0n
j=1 aj, for which 01
j=1 aj = a1.

6.3
Prime Numbers
181
n < m can be written as a product of ﬁnitely many primes; we shall prove that the
same is true for m itself, and to this end we distinguish two distinct cases:
(i) if m is prime, there is nothing to do.
(ii) If m is not prime, there exist integers a and b such that m = ab, with 1 <
a, b < m. By induction hypothesis, each of a and b can be written as a product
of ﬁnitely many primes, say a = p1 . . . pk and b = q1 · · · ql, with k, l ≥1 and
p1, . . . , pk, q1, . . . , ql primes. Therefore,
m = ab = p1 . . . pkq1 · · · ql,
so that m is also a product of ﬁnitely many primes.
⊓⊔
A useful consequence of the previous lemma is the following criterion for
searching prime divisors of a composite numbers, due to the Greek mathematician
of the third century BC Eratosthenes of Cyrene.7
Corollary 6.36 (Eratosthenes)
If an integer n > 1 is composite, then n has a
prime divisor p such that p ≤√n.
Proof Since n is composite, we can write n = ab, with a and b integers such that
1 < a ≤b. Letting p be a prime divisor of a (which exists, by Euclid’s lemma), it
follows that p | n and
p2 ≤a2 ≤ab = n.
Therefore, p ≤√n.
⊓⊔
The previous corollary can be successfully used to establish the primality of a
small natural number, as shown by the coming example. The method involved is
known in mathematical literature as Eratosthenes’ sieve, and consists in dividing
the natural number at scrutiny by each of the primes which are less that its square
root. According to Eratosthenes’ theorem, if none of such divisions is exact, then
the number is prime.
Example 6.37 Use the previous result to prove that 641 is prime.
Proof Firstly, note that 25 <
√
641 < 26. Hence, if 641 is composite, then
Eratosthenes theorem guarantees that 641 must possess a prime divisor p ≤25,
so that
p ∈{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}.
7Apart from his work in Number Theory, another important achievement of Eratosthenes was an
indirect measurement of the Earth’s diameter, with an impressive degree of accuracy for his time.

182

Divisibility
Nevertheless, it is immediate to verify that, upon dividing 641 by each of the primes
above, no division is exact (i.e., leaves zero remainder). Therefore, 641 is indeed a
prime number.
⊓⊔
A slight modiﬁcation of the procedure above can be used to ﬁnd prime numbers
recursively. For example, imagine one wants to ﬁnd all prime numbers less than or
equal to 150. One starts by erasing, from the list of odd numbers from 3 to 150, those
which are multiples of 3. After that, the least number greater than 3 and not erased
is 5, which is then prime; thus, we perform a second step, by erasing all multiples of
5. This step leaves 7 as the least number not erased, so that 7 is prime; in the third
step, we then erase all multiples of 7. Continuing to proceed this way, we get the
following list as result:

The numbers which were not erased are prime.
In spite of the above, the importance of Eratosthenes’ sieve lies on a theoretical,
rather than practical, level. For instance, in order to decide whether or not 999997 is
prime, we would have to divide it by all prime numbers less than
√
999997 ∼= 1000,
which is not feasible without the aid of computer programming.8
Back to Euclid’s Lemma 6.35, if we gather together equal primes we conclude
that every integer n > 1 can be write in the form n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , with p1, . . . , pk
pairwise distinct primes and α1, . . . , αk ∈N. We shall see in Theorem 6.43 that, up
to a permutation of factors, such a way of writing n is unique. However, before we
do that, let us prove another result of Euclid, which shows that the set of primes is
inﬁnite.
Theorem 6.38 (Euclid)
The set of prime numbers is inﬁnite.
Proof By induction on n, let us prove that if N contains n primes, then it contains
n + 1 primes. Suppose, then, that p1, . . . , pn are pairwise distinct primes, and let
m = p1 . . . pn + 1.
8Actually, the situation here is even more dramatic. With a little more work, it is possible to
show that Eratosthenes’ sieve is not a polynomial algorithm. This means that the quantity of
arithmetic operations one needs to perform in order to compute the n-th prime with the aid of it
grows exponentially with n. Thus, even with the aid of a powerful computer, Eratosthenes’ sieve
is not a feasible primality algorithm for large numbers.

6.3
Prime Numbers
183
By Euclid’s Lemma 6.35, there exists a prime p such that p | m. If p = pi for
some 1 ≤i ≤n, then p | p1 . . . pn. It follows from Proposition 6.5 that p divides
the difference m −p1 . . . pn, i.e., p | 1, which is an absurd. Therefore, p is a prime
number distinct from all of the pi’s, so that we have at least n + 1 primes in N.
⊓⊔
Remark 6.39 In spite of the above result, there are arbitrarily large gaps in the
sequence of primes. Indeed, given an integer k ≥3, for all of the consecutive and
positive integers a + 2, a + 3, . . . , a + k to be composite it sufﬁces that a be a
common multiple of 2, 3, . . . , k. We shall have more to say on the distribution of
primes along N in Chap. 9.
As the next example shows, small variations of the argument used in the proof
of Euclid’s theorem allow us to prove that several arithmetic progressions contain
inﬁnitely many primes among their terms.9
Example 6.40 Prove that there are inﬁnitely many primes of the form 4k −1.
Proof Assume that there is only a ﬁnite number of primes of the form 4k −1, say
p1 = 3, p2 = 7, p3 = 11, . . . , pt, and consider the number
m = 4p1p2 . . . pt −1.
Then, m > 1 and, letting m′ = p1p2 . . . pt, we have m = 4m′ −1.
On the other hand, Lemma 6.35 guarantees the existence of odd primes q1, . . . , ql
such that m = q1 . . . ql. Now, observe that every odd prime is of one of the forms
4q′ −1 or 4q′ + 1, for some q′ ∈Z. If qi = 4q′
i + 1 for 1 ≤i ≤t, we would get
m = q1 . . . ql = (4q′
1 + 1) . . . (4q′
l + 1) = 4q + 1,
for some q ∈N. But this would contradict the fact that m = 4m′ −1. Hence, there
exists at least one index 1 ≤i ≤l such that qi = 4q′
i −1.
Finally, since p1, p2, . . . , pt are all primes of the form 4k −1, we must have
qi = pj for some 1 ≤j ≤t. However, since qi | m, we conclude that pj should be
a divisor of m = 4p1p2 . . . pt −1, which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
For the proof of Theorem 6.43 we shall need the following auxiliary result, which
is important in itself.
Lemma 6.41 If a1, . . . , an ∈N and p is a prime such that p | a1a2 . . . an, then
there exists 1 ≤i ≤n such that p | ai. In particular, if a1, . . . , an are also primes,
then there exists 1 ≤i ≤n such that p = ai.
9Actually, it is possible to prove a much more general result, due to the Dirichlet, which states that
every inﬁnite and nonconstant arithmetic progression of naturals contains inﬁnitely many primes,
provided its ﬁrst term and its common difference are relatively prime. We shall see a relevant
particular case of Dirichlet’s theorem at Sect. 20.2.

184
6
Divisibility
Proof We shall prove the case n = 2, the general case being totally analogous.
Assume that p | (ab) but p ∤a, and let d = gcd(a, p). Since d | p, we have d = 1
or d = p; however, since p ∤a and d | a, we conclude that d ̸= p, and hence d = 1.
Thus, since p | (ab) and gcd(a, p) = 1, it follows from item (a) of Proposition 6.22
that p | b.
The particular case follows at once from the ﬁrst part, together with the very
deﬁnition of prime number.
⊓⊔
Example 6.42 If p is a prime number, then p divides each of the binomial numbers
p
k

, for every integer 1 ≤k ≤p −1.
Proof We can restrict to the case of an odd p. Since
p
k

p!
k!(p −k)! = (k + 1) . . . (p −1)p
(p −k)!
is an integer, we have that (p −k)! divides (k + 1) . . . (p −1)p. Now, since p is
prime and p ∤1, 2, . . . , p −k, the previous lemma guarantees that p ∤(p −k)!,
and hence gcd(p, (p −k)!) = 1. Therefore, item (a) of Proposition 6.22 shows that
(p −k)! must divide (k + 1) . . . (p −1). In turn, this fact allows us to write

The coming result is the cornerstone of elementary Number Theory, and is
known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Whenever convenient, we
shall abbreviate it as FTA.
Theorem 6.43 Every integer n > 1 can be written as a product of powers of
distinct primes. Moreover, such a decomposition of n is unique in the following
sense: if n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k
= qβ1
1 . . . qβl
l , with p1 < · · · < pk and q1 < · · · < ql
being primes and αi, βj ≥1 being integers, then k = l and pi = qi, αi = βi for
1 ≤i ≤k.
Proof The existence was established in the paragraph preceding Theorem 6.38.
For the uniqueness, let the integer n > 1 have two decompositions as in the
statement. Since p1 | n, we have that p1 | qβ1
1 . . . qβl
l , and the previous lemma
guarantees the existence of an index 1 ≤j ≤l such that p1 = qj. On the other
hand, since q1 | n, we have that q1 | pα1
1 . . . pαk
k ; again by the previous lemma, there
exists an index 1 ≤i ≤k such that q1 = pi. Thus, p1 = qj ≥q1 = pi ≥p1, from
where we get p1 = q1 and, hence,
n = pα1
1 pα2
2 . . . pαk
k = pβ1
1 qβ2
2 . . . qβl
l .

We shall now prove that α1 = β1. By contradiction, assume that α1 ̸= β1. We have
two different cases to consider:
(i) α1 < β1: then pα2
2 . . . pαk
k
= pβ1−α1
1
qβ2
2 . . . qβl
l , so that p1 | pα2
2 . . . pαk
k .
Arguing as above, there would exist an index 2 ≤i ≤k such that p1 = pi,
which is an absurd.
(ii) α1 > β1: then pα1−β1
1
pα2
2 . . . pαk
k
= qβ2
2 . . . qβl
l . Again as above, we would get
p1 = qj for some index 2 ≤j ≤l, and this would give us the contradiction
p1 = qj > q1 = p1.
Thus, α1 = β1, and it follows that pα2
2 . . . pαk
k = qβ2
2 . . . qβl
l .
Repeating the above reasoning several times (there is an induction here, which
shall not be formalized for the sake of clearness), we successively conclude that
p2 = q2 and α2 = β2, p3 = q3 and α3 = β3, etc. At the end, if k < l we would get
1 = qβk+1
k+1 . . . qβl
l , which is clearly impossible. Likewise, k > l is also impossible,
so that k = l and there is nothing left to do.
⊓⊔
The FTA will be almost omnipresent along these notes. However, it is instructive
to the reader that we pause for a moment to illustrate how one can proﬁtably use
such a result in concrete situations.
Example 6.44 The natural numbers x and y are such that 3x2 +x = 4y2 +y. Prove
that x −y is a perfect square.
Proof Let p be a prime number and pa, pb and pc be the greatest powers of p
dividing x, y and x −y, respectively (here we are already invoking the FTA). Let us
momentarily assume that a ≤b. Then, p2a | x2, y2, and it follows from item (c) of
Proposition 6.5 that p2a | (4y2 −3x2). Since x −y = 4y2 −3x2, we then have that
p2a | (x −y), and the uniqueness part of the FTA gives c ≥2a. On the other hand,
writing
x2 = (x −y) −4(y2 −x2) = (x −y)[1 + 4(y + x)]
and recalling the way we chose c, we conclude that pc | x2. Therefore, once more
from the uniqueness part of the FTA, we obtain c ≤2a. Hence, c = 2a, which is an
even number. If a ≥b we conclude, quite similarly, that c = 2b. Finally, since the
prime p was arbitrarily chosen, the FTA presents x −y as the product of powers of
primes with even exponents. Therefore, x −y is a perfect square.
⊓⊔
The presentation of an integer n > 1 as the product of powers of distinct primes
is said to be its canonical factorisation or decomposition in prime powers. The
following corollaries collect some useful consequences of the existence of such a
factorisation.
Corollary 6.45 Let a, b, m and n be natural numbers for which am = bn. If
gcd(m, n) = 1, then there exists c ∈N such that a = cn and b = cm.

186

Divisibility
Proof It is clear that a and b are divisible by exactly the same primes, say p1 <
. . . < pk. Let a = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k
and b = pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k , with αi, βi ≥1, be the
canonical decompositions of a and b. Then,
pmα1

. . . pmαk
k
= am = bn = pnβ1

. . . pnβk
k
,
and the uniqueness part of the FTA gives
mαi = nβi, ∀1 ≤i ≤k.
(6.8)
Thus, m | nβi and, since m and n are relatively prime, item (a) of Proposition 6.22
allows us to conclude that m | βi. Letting ui ∈N be such that βi = mui, (6.8) gives
αi = nui. Therefore, letting c = pu1
1 . . . puk
k , we obtain
a = pnu1

k

⊓⊔
Let us now learn how to obtain the canonical decompositions of the positive
divisors of an integer greater than 1 and the gcd and lcm of two nonzero integers.
Corollary 6.46 If n = pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k
is the canonical decomposition of the integer
n > 1, then the positive divisors of n are the natural numbers of the form
pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , with 0 ≤αi ≤βi for 1 ≤i ≤k. In particular, letting d(n) denote
the number of positive divisors of n, then
d(n) =
k
i=1
(βi + 1).
(6.9)
Proof If d > 1 is a divisor of n and p is a prime that divides d, then p also divides
n, so that p is equal to one of the primes p1, . . . , pk. However, since this is valid
for every prime divisor of d, it follows that d = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , with αi ≥0 for every
i (we not necessarily have αi ≥1, for it may well happen that pi ∤d for one or
more values of i). Now, if d′ ∈N is such that n = dd′, then, as above, we get
d′ = p
α′

1 . . . p

k , with α′
i ≥0 for every i. Therefore,
p
α1+α′

. . . p
αk+α′
k
k
= dd′ = n = pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k ,
and the uniqueness part of the FTA gives αi + α′
i = βi for every i. In particular,
αi ≤βi for every i.
Conversely, it is immediate to show that every natural number d of the form
pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , with 0 ≤αi ≤βi for 1 ≤i ≤k, is a positive divisor of n.
For what is left to do, what we did above, again in conjunction with the
uniqueness part of the FTA, assures that the number of positive divisors of n

6.3
Prime Numbers
187
coincides with the number of sequences (α1, . . . , αk) of integers such that 0 ≤αi ≤
βi for 1 ≤i ≤k. Since there are βi + 1 possibilities for αi, formula (6.9) follows at
once from the fundamental principle of counting (cf. Corollary 1.9).
⊓⊔
The following example presents a simple application of the former result.
Example 6.47 Prove that the natural number n is a perfect square if and only if d(n)
is odd.
Proof Firstly, since 1 = 12 and d(1) = 1 is odd, we can assume that n > 1. Then,
let n > 1 be an integer and n = pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k be its canonical factorisation into prime
powers.
If n is a perfect square, say n = m2, with m ∈N, then m | n, so that m =
pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , with 0 ≤αi ≤βi for 1 ≤i ≤k. Therefore,
pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k = n = m2 = p2α1
1
. . . p2αk
k
,
and the uniqueness part of the FTA gives βi = 2αi for 1 ≤i ≤k. Thus, the previous
corollary gives
d(n) = (β1 + 1) . . . (βk + 1) = (2α1 + 1) . . . (2αk + 1),
which is and odd number.
Conversely, let d(n) = (β1 + 1) . . . (βk + 1) be odd. Then, βi + 1 is odd for
1 ≤i ≤k, which in turn gives βi even for 1 ≤i ≤k. Writing βi = 2αi, we get
n = p2α1

with m = pα1

⊓⊔
For the next corollary, it is useful to extend the canonical decomposition of an
integer greater than 1 by allowing exponents equal to 0. For instance, we can write
48 = 24 · 3 and 270 = 2 · 33 · 5 by using the prime numbers 2, 3 and 5 in both cases,
so that
48 = 24 · 3 · 50 and 270 = 2 · 33 · 5.
Corollary 6.48 Let a, b > 1 be natural numbers such that a = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k
and
b = pβ1
1 . . . pβk
k , with p1 < · · · < pk prime numbers and αi, βi ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤k.
Then,
gcd(a, b) =
k
i=1
pmin{αi,βi}
i
and lcm (a, b) =
k
i=1
pmax{αi,βi}
i
.

188
6
Divisibility
Proof Let us do the proof for the gcd of a and b (that for the lcm of a and b is totally
analogous). Since min{αi, βi} ≤αi, βi for every i, the number d = 0k
i=1 pmin{αi,βi}
i
divides both a and b. Now, let d′ be a common positive divisor of a and b.
Corollary 6.46 gives d′ = pγ1
1 . . . pγk
k , with γi ≥0 for every i; moreover, since,
d′ | a, b, it also gives γi ≤αi, βi for every i. Hence, we have γi ≤min {αi, βi} for
every i, so that (once more from Corollary 6.46) d′ | d. Therefore, d = gcd(a, b).
⊓⊔
Back to the last paragraph before the statement of the above corollary, we can
now readily compute
gcd(48, 270) = 2 · 3 = 6 and lcm (48, 270) = 24 · 33 · 5 = 2160.
For what comes next, if a natural number n and a prime number p are such
that p ≤n, then we obviously have that p | n!. The following result, due to
A-M. Legendre,10 teaches us how to compute the exponent of p in the canonical
decomposition of n!. Accordingly, (6.10) is known as Legendre’s formula.
Proposition 6.49 Let n > 1 be natural and p be prime. If ep(n) denotes the
exponent of p in the canonical factorisation of n!, then
ep(n) =

k≥1
( n
pk
)
.
(6.10)
Proof Firstly, note that the above sum is actually ﬁnite, for ⌊n
pk ⌋= 0 whenever
pk > n. Now, if k ∈N and pk, 2pk, . . . , mpk are the multiples of pk which are less
than or equal to n, then mpk ≤n < (m + 1)pk or, equivalently, m ≤
n
pk < m + 1.
Hence, m is the greatest integer which is less than or equal to n
pk , i.e., m = ⌊n
pk ⌋. In
turn, this shows that for each integer k ≥1 there are exactly
( n
pk
)
−
(
n
pk+1
)
natural numbers which are less than or equal to n and are multiples of pk but not of
pk+1. Each of these naturals contributes with exactly k factors p to ep(n), so that
ep(n) =

Example 6.50 (Soviet Union) In how many zeros does 1000! end?
Proof We have to ﬁnd the greatest power of 10 that divides 1000!. To this end, and
writing 1000! = 2e2(1000) · 5e5(1000)m, with m ∈N, it is enough to compute the
smallest of e2(1000) and e5(1000). It is clear that the smallest of these is e5(1000),
which can be promptly computed with the aid of Legendre’s formula (and taking
into account that 55 > 1000):
e5(1000) =
4

j=1
(1000

= 200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249.
Therefore, 1000! ends in 249 zeros.
⊓⊔
Example 6.51 (Yugoslavia) Prove that 2n ∤n!, for each n ∈N.

that the greatest power of 2 dividing n! has exponent k = 

Diophantine Equations
Our purpose in this chapter is to study some elementary diophantine equations.
Among these we highlight Pythagoras’ and Pell’s equation, for which we charac-
terize all solutions. We also present to the reader the important Fermat’s descent
method, which provides a frequently useful tool for showing that certain diophantine
equations do not possess nontrivial solutions, in a way to be made precise.
The aforementioned method is one of the major legacies of Pierre Simon de Fermat
to Number Theory,1 and will be frequently used hereafter.
7.1
Pythagorean Triples and Fermat’s Descent
Let us start by studying the nonzero integer solutions of the equation x2 + y2 =
z2, which, thanks to Pythagoras’ theorem of Euclidean Geometry, is known as
Pythagoras’ equation. After we ﬁnd all such solutions, we shall see how to use
that information to solve other interesting diophantine equations. The fundamental
result is as follows.
Proposition 7.1 The 3-tuples (x, y, z) of nonzero integers such that x2 + y2 = z2
are given by:
⎧
⎨
⎩
x = 2uvd
y = (u2 −v2)d
z = (u2 + v2)d
or
⎧
⎨
⎩
x = (u2 −v2)d
y = 2uvd
z = (u2 + v2)d,
,
(7.1)
where d, u and v are nonzero integers, with u and v of distinct parities and relatively
prime.
1Other remarkable ones are Fermat’s little theorem, which has already appeared in Problem 5,
page 57, and will be proved by other methods in Sect. 10.2, and Fermat’s theorem on sums of two
squares, which will be the object of Sect. 12.4.

Diophantine Equations
Proof We can assume, without loss of generality, that x, y, z > 0. If d = gcd(x, y),
then d2 | (x2 + y2), so that d2 | z2; therefore, d | z. Hence, there exist nonzero
integers a, b and c for which gcd(a, b) = 1 and (x, y, z) = (da, db, dc). Moreover,
since
x2 + y2 = z2 ⇔a2 + b2 = c2,
we conclude that it sufﬁces to ﬁnd all nonzero integer solutions a, b, c of the above
equation, subjected to the additional condition gcd(a, b) = 1.
The requirement that a2 + b2 = c2 and gcd(a, b) = 1 easily give us (prove
this!) gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1. Now, recall (cf. Corollary 6.8) that the square of
an integer t leaves remainder 0 or 1 upon division by 4, according to whether t is
respectively even or odd. Therefore, if a and b are both odd, then c2 = a2 + b2 will
leave remainder 2 upon division by 4, which is a contradiction.
Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we are left with two cases to consider: a is odd and b is
even, or vice-versa. Let us look at the ﬁrst case, the analysis of the second one being
entirely analogous. Since a is odd, b is even and c2 = a2 + b2, we conclude that c
is also odd. Now, write
b2 = (c −a)(c + a).
(7.2)
If d′ = gcd(c −a, c + a), then d′ divides both
(c + a) + (c −a) = 2c and (c + a) −(c −a) = 2a
so that d′ | gcd(2a, 2c) = 2. However, since c −a and c + a are both even, we
conclude that d′ = 2, and we can write (7.2) as
b

c −a

= 1. Thus, item (b) of Corollary 6.23 assures the existence of
relatively prime naturals u and v for which c + a = 2u2 and c −a = 2v2, so that
a = u2 −v2, b = 2uv, c = u2 + v2.
Furthermore, since c = u2 + v2 is odd, we see that u and v must have distinct
parities.
Finally, direct substitution on the original equation shows that all 3-tuples as
above are indeed solutions of Pythagoras’ equation, and there is nothing left to do.

Solution In any such solution, x and y must be both even or both odd, for otherwise
x2+y2 would be odd, hence different from 2z2. Thus, taking a = x+y
2
and b = x−y
2 ,
we have a, b ∈Z \ {0} (since x ̸= ±y) and x = a + b, y = a −b. Substituting such
expressions for x and y in the original equation, we conclude that
x2 + y2 = 2z2 ⇔a2 + b2 = z2.
Since this last equation is that of Pythagoras, our previous result guarantees the
existence of nonzero integers d, u and v, with u and v relatively prime and of distinct
parities, such that
a = 2uvd, b = (u2 −v2)d, z = (u2 + v2)d
or
a = (u2 −v2)d, b = 2uvd, z = (u2 + v2)d.
Hence, the solutions (x, y, z) of the given equation, with x ̸= ±y, are of one of
the forms below, where d, u and v satisfy the conditions prescribed above:
x = (u2 −v2 + 2uv)d, y = (−u2 + v2 + 2uv)d, z = (u2 + v2)d
or
x = (u2 −v2 + 2uv)d, y = (u2 −v2 −2uv)d, z = (u2 + v2)d.
⊓⊔
The equations we have analysed up to this point are, in a certain sense, privileged,
for they possess inﬁnitely many nonzero integer solutions. Our next example will
display a diophantine equation in x, y and z having x = y = z = 0 as its
only integer solution. The proof we shall present is an application of Fermat’s
descent method, which can sometimes be proﬁtably used to show that a diophantine
equation does not have nonzero integer solutions.
2For two different proofs of this fact, see chapters 4 and 5 of [9], for instance.

Diophantine Equations
Schematically, Fermat’s method consists of the fulﬁllment of the following
stages:
i Assume that the given equation has a solution in nonzero integers.
ii. From such an assumption, infer that it has a solution in nonzero integers which,
in a certain sense (which will depend on the problem at hand) is minimal.
iii. Deduce the existence of yet another solution in nonzero integers which is
smaller than the minimal one of item ii., thus arriving at a contradiction.
Example 7.3 Prove that the equation 3x2 +y2 = 2z2 does not have nonzero integer
solutions.
Proof Firstly, observe that we cannot have exactly one of the integers x, y, z equal to
0. Hence, assume that the given equation possess a solution (x, y, z) with x, y, z ∈
N (for, if (x, y, z) is a solution, then so is (±x, ±y, ±z)). Among all such solutions
(x, y, z), there must exist one for which z has the least possible value, say x = a,
y = b, z = c. Let us work this solution.
If 3 ∤b, it follows from 3a2 + b2 = 2c2 that 3 ∤c. But then, Corollary 6.8
guarantees that b2 and c2 leave remainder 1 upon division by 3, and hence equality
3a2 + b2 = 2c2 gives us a contradiction. Therefore, 3 | b, say b = 3b1 for some
b1 ∈N, and it follows from
2c2 = 3a2 + b2 = 3(a2 + 3b2
1)
that 3 | c. Letting c = 3c1, for some c1 ∈N, the last equality above furnishes
6c2
1 = a2 + 3b2
1,
so that 3 | a, say a = 3a1, with a1 ∈N. Now, plugging a = 3a1 in the last equality
above, we get
2c2
1 = 3a2
1 + b2
1,
so that (a1, b1, c1) is another solution, in natural numbers, of the original equation.
However, the relation 0 < c1 = c
3 < c is a contradiction, for we departed from
a solution in natural numbers (a, b, c) for which the (natural) value c of z was the
least possible one.
Since our original assumption (namely, that the given equation has some solution)
leads to a contradiction, we are forced to conclude that the equation has no solution
at all.
⊓⊔
Back to Pythagoras’ equation, a natural generalization of it, posed by Fermat,
would be to study the more general diophantine equation below:
xn + yn = zn.
(7.3)

7.1
Pythagorean Triples and Fermat’s Descent
197
Fermat himself claimed to have succeeded in using his descent method to prove
that (7.3) has no nonzero integer solutions when n > 2, and for this reason such
a result has eventually come to be known as Fermat’s last theorem. Nevertheless,
since his reasoning was never written down, some of the most brilliant minds of
Mathematics tried to reproduce it, year after year. As astonishing as it may seen,
apart from particular cases, all such attempts resulted unsuccessful, and this state of
things forged the general perception that Fermat had probably made some mistake.
It took mankind almost 350 years to settle the issue. Indeed, it was only in the
last decade of the twentieth century that the English mathematician Andrew Wiles
entered History as the one to establish Fermat’s conjecture. Wiles accomplishment
came after several years of hard work and through two long and deep papers, the
second of which in collaboration with his former student Richard Taylor. As is
almost always the case with such profound results in modern Mathematics, Wiles
and Taylor built on equally deep works of other prominent mathematicians, among
the most notable of them we should mention the Japanese Yutaka Taniyama and
Goro Shimura, and the German Gerhard Frey.3
Surprisingly enough, the descent method can be used to successfully approach
the case 4 | n in Fermat’s equation (7.3). We do this next.
Example 7.4 If the natural number n is a multiple of 4, then there does not exist
nonzero integers x, y and z such that xn + yn = zn.
Proof Let n = 4k, with k ∈N. From xn + yn = zn, with x, y, z ∈Z \ {0}, we get
(xk)4 + (yk)4 = (z2k)2,
so that (xk, yk, z2k) is a solution of equation a4+b4 = c2 in nonzero integers. Thus,
it sufﬁces to show that this last equation does not admit nonzero integer solutions.
By the sake of contradiction, let us assume that there exist a, b, c ∈N such that
a4 + b4 = c2. We can also suppose that a, b and c are chosen in such a way that
there is no other solution (α, β, γ ), with α, β, γ ∈N and γ < c (as the reader
surely expects, this is precisely the assumption that will give us a contradiction via
the descent method).
Since (a2, b2, c) solves Pythagoras’ equation, Proposition 7.1, together with the
minimality of c, guarantees that gcd(a2, b2) = 1, as well as that there exist relatively
prime natural numbers u and v, of distinct parities and such that
a2 = u2 −v2, b2 = 2uv, c = u2 + v2
or
a2 = 2uv, b2 = u2 −v2, c = u2 + v2.
3For the reader interested in knowing a little more on this epic endeavor, we recommend ﬁrst to run
through the best seller of Singh [35], and then to turn to the marvelous book of professors Stewart
and Tall [37].

198

Diophantine Equations
Let us look at the ﬁrst case above, the other one being totally analogous. In
that case, a is odd and a2 + v2 = u2. Therefore, by invoking once more the
characterization of pythagorean triples (and the fact that gcd(u, v) = 1) we conclude
by the existence of relatively prime natural numbers p and q, of distinct parities and
such that
a = p2 −q2, v = 2pq, u = p2 + q2.
Then,
b2 = 2uv = 4pq(p2 + q2),
and since gcd(p, q) = 1, it follows that both p and q are also relatively prime with
p2 + q2. Hence, in order that 4pq(p2 + q2) is a perfect square, the only possibility
is that all of p, q and p2 + q2 are also perfect squares, say
p = α2, q = β2, p2 + q2 = γ 2,
with α, β, γ ∈N. In turn, this ﬁnally gives
α4 + β4 = p2 + q2 = γ 2,
with
c = u2 + v2 > u = p2 + q2 = γ 2 ≥γ,
thus contradicting the minimality of c.
Therefore, there are no nonzero solutions of xn + yn = zn when 4 | n.
⊓⊔
The next section shall bring a nontrivial (and important) application of Fermat’s
descent. For the time being, let us close this section with a beautiful application of
the characterization of pythagorean triples to a problem in Euclidean Geometry.
Example 7.5 (Crux—Adapted) Given a positive integer r, we want to compute
the number of pairwise incongruent right triangles ABC, satisfying the following
conditions:
(a) The radius of the circle inscribed in ABC equals r.
(b) The lengths of the sides of ABC are relatively prime integers.
Show that there are exactly 2l such triangles, where l is the number of distinct prime
factors of r.
Proof Let b and c be the legs and a be the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose
inscribed circle has radius r. It is an easy exercise of Euclidean Geometry (which
we leave to the reader) to show that r = b+c−a
2
.

7.1
Pythagorean Triples and Fermat’s Descent
199
Since a, b and c are relatively prime and b2 + c2 = a2, the characterization of
pythagorean triples gives relatively prime integers u > v > 0, of distinct parities,
for which
b = u2 −v2, c = 2uv, a = u2 + v2.
Thus, to count the number of triangles satisfying the given conditions is the same
as to count the number of ordered paired (u, v) satisfying the above conditions. To
this end, note that
r = b + c −a
2
= v(u −v)
and that gcd(u, v) = 1 ⇔gcd(v, u −v) = 1.
Letting r = pα1
1 pα2
2 · · · pαl
l , with p1 < p2 < · · · < pl primes, we conclude that
there are exactly 2l distinct possibilities for v:
v = 1 or v = p
αi1
i1 · · · p
αik
ik ,
where {i1, . . . , ik} is a subset of {1, 2, . . . , l}. For each such v, note that u = v + r
v
is completely determined and that u = v + r
v > v. We now have to check that u and
v have distinct parities. To this end, assume, without loss of generality, that r is even
(the analysis of the case of an odd r is quite similar). Then, v contains either all or
none of the factors 2 of r. If v has all factors 2 of r, then r
v is odd, and it follows
that u = v + r
v is also odd; if v is itself odd, then r
v is even and u = v + r
v is odd.
In any event, u and v have, indeed, distinct parities.
In order to conclude that the number of right triangles we wish to count
is precisely 2l, it now sufﬁces to show that, if (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) are two
distinct choices for (u, v) as above, then the corresponding triangles are actually
incongruent. To this end, assuming that v1 ̸= v2 (the case u1 ̸= u2 being totally
analogous), we are going to show that the two corresponding right triangles have
distinct hypotenuses. But this is straightforward:

Pell’s Equation
Recall (cf. Problem 6, page 190) that an integer greater than 1 is said to be square
free if it is not divisible by the square of a prime number. In this section, we examine
the integer solutions of equations of the form
x2 −dy2 = m,
(7.4)
where d > 1 is square free and m is a given integer. Such an equation is known as
Pell’s equation.5
Since d is a product of distinct primes, Example 6.24 guarantees that
√
d is
irrational. In particular, we conclude that the above equation has no nonzero integer
solutions when m = 0. Indeed, if this was not the case, then we would have x, y ̸= 0
and, hence,
√
d = x
y ∈Q. On the other hand, if d, m < 0, then Pell’s equation
obviously has no solutions, whereas if d < 0 < m, then (7.4) has at most a ﬁnite
number of solutions. We also notice that, even if d, m > 0, (7.4) may have no
solution at all, as Problem 1 shows.
From now on, we shall assume that m = 1. (The general case is partially dealt
with at Problem 4; in this respect, see also [27]). Before we dive into a general
analysis, let us give a simple example showing that, in this case, Pell’s equation
may have inﬁnitely many solutions.
Example 7.6 Show that the equation x2 −2y2 = 1 has inﬁnitely many positive
integer solutions.
Proof Note that x = 3, y = 2 is a solution. On the other hand, we can generate
inﬁnitely many integer solutions of this equation from one nonzero integer solution
(a, b) in the following way: starting from a2 −2b2 = 1, we write
(a + b
√
2)(a −b
√
2) = 1
and, hence,
(a + b
√
2)2(a −b
√
2)2 = 1.
Expanding both binomials, we arrive at
(a2 + 2b2 + 2ab
√
2)(a2 + 2b2 −2ab
√
2) = 1
or, which is the same, at
(a2 + 2b2)2 −2(2ab)2 = 1.

Diophantine Equations
Therefore, (a2 + 2b2, 2ab) is also an integer solution and, letting a, b ∈N, we have
a < a2 + 2b2. Iterating the above argument, we obtain inﬁnitely many solutions for
the given equation.
⊓⊔
The method used in the previous example can be easily generalized to show that
the general Pell’s equation x2 −dy2 = 1 admits inﬁnitely many nonzero integer
solutions, provided it admits at least one such solution. Moreover, as illustrated by
Problems 4 and 7, for instance, small modiﬁcations in that approach also allow us
to treat more general equations.
Even tough we can easily ﬁnd inﬁnitely many integer solutions of (7.4) in some
particular cases, for the time being we do not know whether or not there are other
integer solutions, not to say how to ﬁnd all of them. In order to answer these
questions, we shall need a preliminary result, due to Dirichlet, on approximation of
irrational numbers by rational ones. For what comes next, recall (cf. the discussion
preceding Problem 15, page 178) that, for x ∈R, the fractionary part of x is the
real number {x} ∈[0, 1), given by {x} = x −⌊x⌋.
Lemma 7.7 (Dirichlet)
If α is an irrational number, then there exist inﬁnitely
many rationals x

a union of n disjoint half-open intervals, pigeonhole’s principle guarantees the
existence of indices 0 ≤k < j ≤n such that {jα} and {kα} belong to a single
of these n half-open intervals.
Then, |{jα} −{kα}| < 1
n or, which is the same,
|(j −k)α −(⌊jα⌋−⌊kα⌋)| < 1
n.
It thus follows that
				α −⌊jα⌋−⌊kα⌋

(7.6)
and letting x = ⌊jα⌋−⌊kα⌋and y = j −k, we have 0 < y ≤n and

In order to guarantee the existence of inﬁnitely many such pairs, let x and y be

y2 . By choosing a natural
number n1 for which

Finally, by iterating the above reasoning we obtain inﬁnitely many (x, y) of
nonzero, relatively prime integers satisfying (7.5).
⊓⊔
As we shall now see, Dirichlet’s lemma allows us to show that, for a ﬁxed square
free natural number d > 1, there exists at least one integer value of m for which (7.4)
admits inﬁnitely many integer solutions.
Lemma 7.8 If d > 1 is a square free natural number, then there exists m ∈Z \ {0}
such that equation x2 −dy2 = m has inﬁnitely many integer solutions.
Proof Since
√
d /∈Q, Dirichlet’s lemma assures that the set S of ordered pairs
(x, y) of nonzero, relatively prime integers x, y satisfying

However, if (x, y) is such a pair, then |x −y

that repeats itself an inﬁnitely number of times among the values of x2 −dy2, for
(x, y) ∈S. Of course, this is the same as saying that, for this value of m, equation
x2 −dy2 = m admits inﬁnitely many integer solutions.
⊓⊔

Diophantine Equations
We are ﬁnally in position to characterize all integer solutions of (7.4) when m =
1; the key ingredients will be the previous lemma and Fermat’s method of descent.
We start by establishing the existence of solutions.
Proposition 7.9 If d > 1 is a square free natural number, then equation x2−dy2 =
1 admits at least one solution in positive integers x and y.
Proof Take, by the previous lemma, m ∈Z\{0} for which the equation x2 −dy2 =
m has inﬁnitely many integer solutions. Since there are only ﬁnitely many different
remainders upon division by m, we can choose two such solution, say (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2), such that |x1| ̸= |x2| and m divides x2 −x1, y2 −y1. Then,
(x1 + y1
√
d)(x2 −y2
√
d) = (x1x2 −dy1y2) + (x2y1 −x1y2)
√
d
(7.7)
and, by writing x2 −x1 = mr and y2 −y1 = ms, with r, s ∈Z, we get
x1x2 −dy1y2 = x1(x2 −x1) + (x2
1 −dy2
1) + (y1 −y2)dy1
= m(rx1 + 1 −sdy1)
and
x2y1 −x1y2 = (x2 −x1)y1 + x1(y1 −y2) = m(r −s).
For the sake of simplicity, let x1x2 −dy1y2 = mu and x2y1 −x1y2 = mv, with
u, v ∈Z. It follows from (7.7) that
(x1 + y1
√
d)(x2 −y2
√
d) = m(u + v
√
d)
(7.8)
and, hence,
(x1 −y1
√
d)(x2 + y2
√
d) = m(u −v
√
d).
By multiplying the left and right hand sides of these two relations, we arrive at
m2 = (x2
1 −dy2
1)(x2
2 −dy2
2) = m2(u2 −dv2),
so that u2 −dv2 = 1.
We are left to showing that u, v ̸= 0. If u = 0, we would have −dv2 = 1, which
is clearly impossible. If v = 0 we would get u = ±1, and it would follow from (7.8)
that
(x1 + y1
√
d)(x2 −y2
√
d) = ±m = ±(x2

therefore,

which in turn implies |x1| = |x2|, for
√

choices of x1 and x2, and we are done.
⊓⊔
We are ﬁnally able to state and prove the result we have been seeking, on the
characterization of all integer solutions of Pell’s equation x2 −dy2 = 1, for a square
free integer d > 1. Observe that the previous proposition guarantees that it has at
least one solution.
Theorem 7.10 If d > 1 is a square free integer, then the equation x2 −dy2 = 1
admits inﬁnitely many solutions in positive integers x, y. More precisely, if x = x1,
y = y1 is the solution in positive integers for which the sum x + y
√
d is as small
as possible, then the other positive integer solutions of the equation are given by the
natural numbers xn, yn satisfying the equality
xn + yn
√
d = (x1 + y1
√
d)n,
where n ∈N.
Proof Let α = x1 + y1
√
d, with x1, y1 ∈N being chosen as in the statement of the
theorem.
Given n ∈N, the binomial expansion formula readily gives xn, yn ∈N such that
(x1 ± y1
√
d)n = xn ± yn
√
d.
Thus,
1 = (x2
1 −dy2
1)n = (x1 + y1
√
d)n(x1 −y1
√
d)n
= (xn + yn
√
d)(xn −yn
√
d) = x2
n −dy2
n,
so that all of the ordered pairs (xn, yn) built as in the statement of the theorem are
indeed solutions of the given equation.
Now, if (x, y) is any solution in positive integers, it sufﬁces to show that there
exists n ∈N for which x + y
√
d = αn. For the sake of contradiction, assume that
the converse is true. Since α > 1, we have limn→+∞αn = +∞, so that there exists
n ∈N for which
αn < x + y
√
d < αn+1
or, which is the same,
1 < x + y

Thus, if we show that xxn−dyyn, xny−ynx > 0, we would arrive at a contradiction

Chapter 8
Arithmetic Functions
This short chapter introduces an important class of functions, called arithmetic
multiplicative functions, which play a prominent role in the elementary theory of
numbers. Among the many arithmetic multiplicative functions we shall encounter
here, two deserve all spotlights: the Euler function ϕ, which will reveal itself to
be an indispensable tool for basically all further theoretical developments, and the
Möbius function μ, which is essential to getting the celebrated Möbius inversion
formula and its subsequent application to the Euler function.
In all that follows, we shall refer ourselves to a given function f : N →R as an
arithmetic function.
Deﬁnition 8.1 An arithmetic function f : N →R is said to be multiplicative if,
for all relatively prime m, n ∈N, one has f (mn) = f (m)f (n).
Since 1 is relatively prime with itself, if f
: N →R is an arithmetic
multiplicative function, then f (1) = f (1)2, so that f (1) = 0 or 1. In case f (1) = 0,
we get
f (n) = f (n · 1) = f (n)f (1) = 0, ∀n ∈N,
i.e., f vanishes identically. Hence, from now on we shall implicitly assume that if
f : N →R is an arithmetic multiplicative function, then f (1) = 1.
Note also that if f : N →R is an arithmetic multiplicative function and n > 1 is
an integer with canonical decomposition n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k , then several applications
of the deﬁnition give us
f (n) = f (pα1
1 ) . . . f (pαk
k ).
(8.1)
In words, the above inequality says that, in order to compute the values f (n), with
n ∈N, it sufﬁces to know how to compute the values f (pα), with p prime and
α ∈N.

Arithmetic Functions
Finally, if f : N →R is an arithmetic function such that f (1) = 1, then the
equality f (mn) = f (m)f (n) is always true when m = 1 or n = 1; therefore, in
order to prove that such an f is multiplicative, we just have to consider the case of
m, n > 1.
We shall repeatedly use the above remarks without further notice.
Example 8.2 We saw at Corollary 6.46 that if n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k
is the canonical
decomposition of a natural number n > 1 in primes, then
d(n) = (α1 + 1) . . . (αk + 1)
is the number of positive divisors of n. We claim that the function d : N →R thus
obtained is multiplicative. Indeed, if m, n > 1 are relatively prime integers with
canonical decompositions n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k
and m = qβ1
1 . . . qβl
l , then pi ̸= qj for
all 1 ≤i ≤k, 1 ≤j ≤l. Therefore, the canonical decomposition of mn in primes
is
mn = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k qβ1
1 . . . qβl
l .
so that
d(mn) = (α1 + 1) . . . (αk + 1)(β1 + 1) . . . (βl + 1) = d(m)d(n).
For what comes next, given n ∈N we shall write D(n) to denote the set of
positive divisors of n, so that d(n) = |D(n)|.
Lemma 8.3 If m and n are relatively prime naturals, then the map
f : D(m) × D(n) −→D(mn)
(x, y)
−→
xy
is a bijection.
Proof It follows from Example 8.2 and the fundamental principle of counting that
|D(mn)| = d(mn) = d(m)d(n) = |D(m)| · |D(n)| = |D(m) × D(n)|.
Hence, the domain and codomain of f have equal quantities of elements. Thus, in
order to prove that f is a bijection, it sufﬁces to establish its surjectivity. To this end,
let us apply item (d) of Proposition 6.22: if k | mn, then the condition gcd(m, n) = 1
guarantees that
k = gcd(k, mn) = gcd(k, m) · gcd(k, n).
Therefore, if we let a = gcd(k, m) and b = gcd(k, n), we get a ∈D(m), b ∈D(n)
and f ((a, b)) = ab = k, so that k belongs to the image of f . But since k ∈D(mn)
was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that f is surjective.
⊓⊔

Along the rest of this chapter, we shall write 
0<d|n f (d) to denote the sum of
the values f (d), when d varies in D(n). Although such an use of the letter d is
conﬂictant with the notation for the function d of the previous example, this will be
harmless in context.
The coming proposition establishes one of the most important properties of
arithmetic multiplicative functions.
Proposition 8.4 If f : N →R is an arithmetic multiplicative function, then so is
the function F : N →R, given by
F(n) =

0<d|n
f (d).
Proof If m, n ∈N are such that gcd(m, n) = 1, then the previous lemma, together
with the multiplicative character of f , gives
F(mn) =

0<d|mn
f (d) =

0<d1|m

⎠
= F(m)F(n).
⊓⊔
Example 8.5 The function f : N →R such that f (n) = n for every n ∈N
is obviously multiplicative. Hence, the previous proposition assures that so is the
function s : N →R, given by
s(n) =

0<d|n
f (d) =

0<d|n
d.
Since s(n) adds the positive divisors of n, given a prime number p and α ∈N, it
follows from Corollary 6.46 that
s(pα) =

0<d|pα
d =

Thus, if n = pα1

s(n) =

Arithmetic Functions
For our next example, we recall (cf. Problem 6, page 190) that an integer n > 1
is square free if n = p1 . . . pk, with p1 < · · · < pk being primes; equivalently, n is
square free if there does not exist an integer q > 1 such that q2 | n.
The coming deﬁnition presents one of the most important arithmetic multiplica-
tive functions multiplicativas, the Möbius function.
Deﬁnition 8.6 The Möbius function1 is the function μ : N →R given by
μ(n) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
1, if n = 1
0, if q2 | n, para algum inteiro q > 1
(−1)k, if n = p1 . . . pk, com p1, . . . , pk distinct primes
.
In order to check that the Möbius function is indeed multiplicative, let m, n > 1
be relatively prime integers. Then, mn will be divisible by a perfect square greater
than 1 if and only if either m or n do satisfy such a property; this being the case, it
is immediate to see that
f (mn) = 0 = f (m)f (n).
On the other hand, if m and n are square free, say n = p1 . . . pk and m =
q1 . . . ql, with p1 < · · · < pk and q1 < · · · < ql being prime numbers, the condition
gcd(m, n) = 1 assures that pi ̸= qj for all i and j. Hence, mn = p1 . . . pkq1 . . . ql
is the canonical decomposition of mn in primes, so that
μ(mn) = (−1)k+l = (−1)k(−1)l = μ(m)μ(n).
The coming result brings a very important property of the Möbius function.
Proposition 8.7 If μ : N →R is the Möbius function, then

0<d|n
μ(d) =
1, if n = 1
0, if n > 1 .
Proof Let F : N →R be the function given by
F(n) =

0<d|n
μ(d).
Proposition 8.4 guarantees that F is multiplicative, and we wish to show that F(1) =
1 and F(n) = 0 for n > 1. We consider three cases separately:
(i) n = 1: we have F(1) = 
0<d|1 μ(d) = μ(1) = 1.

F(pk) =

μ(pj) = μ(1) + μ(p) = 0.
(iii) n = pα1

it follows from (8.1) and item (ii) that
F(n) = F(pα1

⊓⊔
Theorem 8.8 is the reason behind the central role of Möbius function in the theory
of arithmetic multiplicative functions. For its proof, notice that the function
f : D(n) −→D(n)
d
−→n/d
(8.3)
is a bijection; indeed, this follows at once from the fact that f ◦f = IdD(n), as the
reader can promptly check.
In the notations of Proposition 8.4, formula (8.4) below, known as the Möbius
inversion formula, teaches us how to recover function f from F (even if f is not
multiplicative).
Theorem 8.8 (Möbius) Let f : N →R be an arithmetic function (not necessarily
multiplicative). If F : N →R is given by F(n) = 
0<d|n f (d), then
f (n) =

⊓⊔
Before we proceed with the development of the theory, we present an example
which shows how Möbius inversion formula can be a useful tool in counting
problems.
Example 8.9 Let n ∈N be given. We say that a sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xn), with
xj ∈{0, 1} for 1 ≤j ≤n, is aperiodic if there does not exist a divisor 0 < d <
n of n such that the sequence is formed by the juxtaposition of n
d copies of the
subsequence (x1, . . . , xd). Compute, in terms of n, the total number of aperiodic
sequences of n terms.
Proof First of all, the fundamental principle of counting assures that there exist
exactly 2n sequences (x1, x2, . . . , xn) with xj ∈{0, 1} for 1 ≤j ≤n.
On the other hand, for such a sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xn), we deﬁne its period as
the least positive divisor d of n for which the sequence is formed by the juxtaposition
of n/d copies of the subsequence (x1, . . . , xd). In particular, an aperiodic sequence
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) has period n.
More generally, if the sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xn) has period d, then (x1, . . . , xd)
is necessarily aperiodic, and conversely. Hence, if ak denotes the number of
aperiodic sequences of k terms, we get

0<d|n
ad = 2n.
If we now apply the Möbius inversion formula, we obtain

The theory developed so far allows us to introduce and study the main properties
of another quite important arithmetic function, according to the following

Arithmetic Functions
215
Deﬁnition 8.10 Euler’s ϕ function is the function ϕ : N →N given by
ϕ(n) = #{1 ≤k ≤n; gcd(k, n) = 1}.
In words, ϕ(n) counts how many integers from 1 to n are relatively prime with
n. In what comes next, among other properties we shall show that the function ϕ is
multiplicative. We shall also use this result to compute ϕ(n) in terms of the canonical
decomposition of n in prime factors.2 We start with a result which will be useful in
other circumstances.
Proposition 8.11 With respect to Euler’s function ϕ : N →N, we have

0<d|n
ϕ(d) =

Proof The ﬁrst equality comes from the bijectivity of function f in (8.3). For the
second one, let D(n) = {1 = a1 < a2 < · · · < at = n}. If 1 ≤k ≤n, then
gcd(k, n) ∈D(n), i.e., gcd(k, n) = ai for some 1 ≤i ≤t. Therefore, letting
Ai = {1 ≤k ≤n; gcd(k, n) = ai}, we get
In = A1 ∪. . . ∪At,
a disjoint union. Hence, n = t
i=1 |Ai|. Now, note that
Ai = {1 ≤k ≤n; gcd(k, n) = ai}
= {1 ≤k/ai ≤n/ai; k/ai ∈N and gcd (k/ai, n/ai) = 1}

For the coming result, also due to Euler, we shall need the fact, left as an exercise
to the reader (see Problem 1), that the product of two arithmetic multiplicative
functions yields yet another such function.
Theorem 8.12 (Euler)
The Euler function ϕ : N →N is multiplicative.
2Another approach was the object of Problem 6, page 40.

Proof Letting G(n) = n, the previous proposition gives us 
0<d|n ϕ(d) = G(n).

However, since f (d) =

is a multiplicative function (verify this assertion!),
Proposition 8.4 shows that function F : N →R, deﬁned by
F(n) =

0<d|n
μ(d)

is also multiplicative. Hence, Problem 1 assures that ϕ(n) = nF(n) is multiplica-
tive, too.
⊓⊔
As we have promised before, the coming corollary relates ϕ(n) with the
canonical decomposition of an integer n > 1 in prime factors.

The formula of the previous corollary allows us to deduce many interesting (and
useful) properties of the Euler function. The coming example presents such a result.
Example 8.14 Given m ∈N, show that the equation ϕ(n) = m has at most a ﬁnite
number of solutions n ∈N.
Proof Firstly, if n = pαr, with α ≥1, p prime and gcd(p, r) = 1, then the
multiplicative character of the function ϕ gives
m = ϕ(n) = ϕ(pα)ϕ(r) = pα−1(p −1)ϕ(r) ≥2α−1,
for ϕ(r) ≥1 and p ≥2. Hence, taking logarithms at base 2, we obtain
α ≤1 + log2 m.
Moreover, analogous computations furnish
m = pα−1(p −1)ϕ(r) ≥p −1,
whence p ≤m + 1.
Now, if n = pα1
1 . . . pαk
k is the canonical decomposition of n in primes and α =
max{α1, . . . , αk}, it follows from what we did above that α ≤1+log2 n and, hence,

7. The purpose of this problem is to establish the converse of the previous
problem, thus proving the following theorem of Euler: if n is an even perfect
number,3 then there exists a prime number p such that 2p −1 is prime and
n = 2p−1(2p −1). To this end, let n = 2kq be an even perfect number, with
k, q ∈N and q being odd. Do the following items:
(a) Conclude that (2k+1 −1)s(q) = 2k+1q. Then, show that there exists a ∈N
for which q = (2k+1 −1)a and s(q) = 2k+1a.
(b) If a = 1, show that 2k+1 −1 is prime, whence k + 1 = p, a prime number.
(c) If a = 2k+1 −1, show that s(q) ≥1 + a + a2 > (a + 1)a = 2k+1a, which
is a contradiction.
(d) If a > 1 and a ̸= 2k+1−1, then q has at least four distinct positive divisors:

Chapter 9
Calculus and Number Theory
In this chapter, we assume that the reader is conversant with the rudiments
of Calculus. More precisely, we shall assume from the reader familiarity with
convergent sequences and series, as well as with the notions of limits and derivatives
of functions. In this sense, the material of [8] covers all of what is necessary.
Here, we shall present some basic examples and results on the distribution of prime
numbers, having the classic book of professor G. Andrews [2] as guideline. We shall
also discuss a rather interesting asymptotic result of Cesàro, on pairs of relatively
prime natural numbers, following [29].
9.1
On the Distribution of Prime Numbers
One of the ﬁrst results on prime numbers we have learned in this book was Euclid’s
theorem, which asserts that the set of primes is inﬁnite. Nevertheless, as was already
pointed out in Remark 6.39, there is an distinctive lack of uniformity on the way
these numbers distribute along the naturals. It is, therefore, quite astonishing that a
result such as Hadamard’s Prime Number Theorem, quoted below, actually holds
true. Before we state it, let us set some notation: for each positive real x, we shall
write π(x) to denote the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x.
Theorem 9.1 (Hadamard1)
In the above notations, one has
lim
x→+∞
π(x)
x/ log x = 1,
(9.1)
where log : (0, +∞) →R stands for the natural logarithm function.

Calculus and Number Theory
Although a proof of the above theorem is well beyond the scope of these notes,
we refer the interested reader to the marvelous book of professor T. Apostol [5] for
a self-contained approach. However, we stress that Hadamard’s theorem assures that
the functions π(x) and
x
log x are asymptotically equal, in the sense that limit (9.1)
holds true.
A few years earlier than Hadamard, the Russian mathematician P. Chebyshev
obtained a much simpler (yet rather interesting) result on prime distribution,
guaranteeing the existence of positive constants c and C such that
c
x
log x ≤π(x) ≤C
x
log x ,
for every real x ≥2.
A proof of the second one of the above inequalities will be the object of
Problem 4; for a proof of the ﬁrst one, we recommend to the reader the book of
professor Andrews, already quoted above. On the other hand, it readily follows from
the second one of the above inequalities that
π(x)
x
≤
C
log x
for every real x ≥2; in particular, one has
lim
x→+∞
π(x)
x
= 0.
(9.2)
In words, (9.2) says that the total quantity of prime numbers less than or equal
to x is an inﬁnitesimal with respect to x (i.e., grows much slower than x itself) as
x →+∞. In what follows, we shall give a direct prove of the validity of such a
result. We start with the following preliminary
Proposition 9.2 If k is a natural number, then
π(x)
x
< ϕ(k)
k
+ 2k
x ,
where ϕ denotes Euler’s function.
Proof For a real number x > 0, let q, r ∈Z be such that ⌊x⌋= kq + r, with
0 ≤r < k. Note that
{1, 2, . . . , ⌊x⌋} =
 q−1

j=0
{kj + 1, kj + 2, . . . , k(j + 1)}

∪
∪{kq + 1, kq + 2, . . . , kq + r}.
(9.3)

9.1
On the Distribution of Prime Numbers
223
From 1 to k there is at most k prime numbers. On the other hand, if j ≥1, then,
for an element of {kj + 1, kj + 2, . . . , k(j + 1)} to be prime, it must necessarily be
relatively prime with k. Hence, such a set contains at most ϕ(k) prime numbers.
Now, since q =
- x
k
.
, (9.3) allows us to write down the following upper estimate
for π(x):
π(x) ≤k + (q −1)ϕ(k) + r < 2k +
x
k

ϕ(k) ≤2k + x
k ϕ(k).
Finally, in order to get the stated result, it sufﬁces to divide both sides of the last
inequality above by x.
⊓⊔
We shall also need the following technical

(9.4)
With the previous results at our disposal, we are ﬁnally in position to prove the
promised weak version of Hadamard’s theorem.
Theorem 9.4 limx→+∞π(x)
x
= 0.
Proof We have to prove that, given ϵ > 0, there exists x0 > 0 such that x >
x0 ⇒π(x)
x
< ϵ. To this end, let p1, p2, . . . , pn be the ﬁrst n prime numbers, and
k = p1p2 . . . pn. Proposition 9.2, together with the formula for ϕ(k), gives us

If we let x0 = 4p1p2...pn

π(x)
x

2 + 2p1p2 . . . pn

2 + 2p1p2 . . . pn

as wished.
⊓⊔
The arguments that led to (9.4) used the fact that the harmonic series diverges:

n≥1
1
n = +∞. Heuristically, we can say that this is due to the fact that the
sequence of naturals has too many naturals (actually, all of them). On the other
hand, already in Lemma 3.15 we used the fact that the series of the inverses of
perfect squares converges: 
n≥1
1
n2 < +∞. This time, and also from a heuristic
point of view, we can attribute the convergence of the series to the fact that the
sequence of perfect squares contains too few naturals.
In view of the above, a natural question poses itself in the context of prime
numbers: if pn stands for the n-th prime number, does the series 
n≥1
1
pn have
too many or too few naturals, in the above sense? Theorem 9.4 would encourage us
to say that it does possess too few naturals.
At this point our intuition fails, for we shall prove below another theorem of the
great L. Euler,2 asserting the divergence of the series of the inverses of primes. To
this end, we shall need the inequality below, which readily follows from (3.7):
ex > 1 + x, ∀x > 0.
(9.6)
2For a slightly different proof of such a result, see the problems of Section 10.9 of [8].

9.1
On the Distribution of Prime Numbers
225
Theorem 9.5 (Euler)
If pk denotes the k-th prime, then the series 
k≥1
1
pk
diverges.
Proof If m ∈N and p1, p2, . . . , pk are the prime numbers less than or equal to m,
it is immediate to see that

Now, observe that the second factor at the left hand side of the previous inequality
is nothing but the sum of the inverses of the square free natural numbers less than or
equal to m. Letting 
1≤j≤m
j sf

j denote this sum, we can write the above inequality as

Since 
j≥1

j diverges and 
j≥1

j2 converges, we conclude that

j≥1
j sf

j
diverges. Finally, by the sake of contradiction, assume that the series of the inverses
of primes converges to a certain real number a. Then, for every n ∈N, we get
from (9.6) that

instance by L’Hôpital’s rule) that

so that the above reasoning assures that the number of primes between x and 2x
grows unboundedly as x →+∞.

Calculus and Number Theory
In this section we give a complete proof of a much weaker result, also due to
Chebyshev, which shows that there is at least one prime number between n and 2n,
for every integer n > 1. For the proof of it, we shall need the two following auxiliary
results.
Lemma 9.6 Let n, p ∈N, with p prime, and let μp be the exponent of p in the
factorisation of
2n
n

. Then,
μp =

j≥1
( 2n
pj
)
−2
( n
pj
)
.
Moreover, if νp is the only integer such that pνp ≤2n < pνp+1, then μp ≤νp.
Proof For the ﬁrst part, since
2n
n

= (2n)!
(n!)2 , we readily conclude that μp is given
by pμp =
pep(2n)
p2ep(n) , where ep(2n) and ep(n) are as in Legendre’s formula (cf.
Proposition 6.10). Hence,
μp = ep(2n) −2ep(n),
and it sufﬁces to use (6.10) to get the stated formula for μp.
For the second part, it follows from the deﬁnition of νp that
j > νp ⇒pj > 2n ⇒
( 2n
pj
)
−2
( n
pj
)
= 0.
On the other hand, for j ≥1 we have
( 2n

Lemma 9.7 If x ≥2 is a real number, then

p≤x

p < 4x.

9.2
Chebyshev’s Theorem
229
Proof The lemma is clearly true for 2 ≤x ≤3. On the other hand, if it is valid for
x = n, where n ≥3 is an odd integer, then it will also be valid for n ≤y < n + 2;
indeed, in such a case n + 1 is even, so that

p≤y
p prime
p =

p≤n
p prime
p < 4n ≤4y.
It then sufﬁces to show that the lemma is true for x = n, where n ≥3 is an odd
integer. To this end, we make induction on n ≥3 odd, noticing that we already have
the validity of the result for n = 3. By induction hypothesis, assume that it is also
true for all odd integers less than a certain odd integer n ≥5. Let k = n±1
2 , with the
sign chosen in such a way that k is odd. Then, k ≥3 and n −k is even and such that
n −k = 2k ∓1 −k ≤k + 1.
Hence, if p is a prime number for which k < p ≤n, then p is odd, p | n!, p ∤k!
and p ∤(n −k)! (it cannot happen that n −k = k + 1 = p, since n −k is even).
Thus, we conclude that the product of all such primes divides

and such binomial numbers are summands in the binomial expansion of 2n =

We have ﬁnally arrived at the desired result, which is known as Chebyshev’s
theorem.3
Theorem 9.8 (Chebyshev)
For each integer n > 1, there is at least one prime
number between n and 2n.
Proof A general argument will prove the result when n ≥128. For n < 128 take
p = 3 if n = 2, p = 5 if n = 3 and:
p = 7 if 4 ≤n ≤6;
p = 13 if 7 ≤n ≤12;
p = 23 if 13 ≤n ≤22;
p = 43 if 23 ≤n ≤42;
p = 83 if 43 ≤n ≤82;
p = 131 if 83 ≤n ≤127.
Now, assume the result is false for some integer n ≥128. In the notations of
Lemma 9.6, such a supposition guarantees that
2n


=

p≤2n

pμp =

pμp.
However, for any prime p such that 2n
3 < p ≤n, we have
p ≥3, p2 > 2
3np, 1 ≤n
p < 3
2, and 2 ≤2n
p < 3,
so that 2n
p2 < 3
p ≤1; it thus follows that
μp =

( n

= 2 −2 = 0.
On the other hand, for any prime p such that
√
2n < p ≤2n
3 , we have p2 > 2n,
and Lemma 9.6 gives 1 ≤μp ≤νp = 1. Finally, for primes p such that p ≤
√
2n,
we have, again by Lemma 9.6, that pμp ≤pνp ≤2n.

(⇔

Finally, note that

is the largest among all of the 2n + 1 summands in the
binomial expansion of 4n = (1 + 1)2n. Since the ﬁrst and last of these summands
are both equal to 1, we get 2n
2n
n


2n

such an estimate, combined with (9.10), furnishes
4n
2n < 4

which yields
2

Taking natural logarithms an dividing both sides by

inequality can be rewritten as
√

(9.11)

Letting f (x) =

8x log 2 −3 log(2x), we have f (128) = 8 log 2 > 0 and
f ′(x) =

> 0
for x ≥128. Thus, f is increasing for x ≥128 and (9.11) is false, which gives us
the desired contradiction.
⊓⊔
The famous Goldbach conjecture4 claims that every even number greater than
2 can be written as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) primes. Although a
serious account on the state of the art on Goldbach’s conjecture is far beyond the
scope of these notes, Chebyshev’s theorem allows us to present a simple example
on the possibility of writing natural numbers as sums of distinct primes.
Example 9.9 Let P stand for the set of prime numbers. Show that every natural
number can be written as a sum of distinct elements of the set {1} ∪P.
Proof Let n > 1 be a natural number and p be the greatest prime number less than
or equal to n. If n ≥2p, then Chebyshev’s theorem would give a prime q between
p and 2p, which would contradict the maximality of p. Therefore, p ≤n < 2p
and, hence, 0 ≤n −p < p. Arguing by induction, we conclude that n −p can be
written as a sum of distinct elements of the set {1}∪P, and writing n = (n−p)+p
we conclude that the same is true of n.
⊓⊔
Problems: Sect. 9.2
1. If pn is the n-th prime, prove that pn+1 < 2pn.
2. * Prove that, for every integer n > 1, there exists a prime p whose exponent in
the canonical decomposition of n! is equal to 1.
3. (TT) Prove that, for every integer n > 1, the number 1!2! · · · n! is not a perfect
square.
4. Find all natural numbers m, n, x and y such that m, n > 1 and (m!)x = (n!)y.
For the two coming problems, the reader will ﬁnd it convenient to use the
following stronger version of Chebyschev’s theorem: for every integer n ≥6,
there are at least two primes between n and 2n.
5. (OCS) Find all m, n ∈N such that (n −1)!n! = m!.
6. Find all natural numbers n > 1 such that every natural 1 < m < n which is
relatively prime with n is indeed a prime number.

Cèsaro’s Theorem
In 1881, E. Cesàro5 proved that the odds that two randomly chosen natural numbers
be relatively prime is equal to 6
π2 . We ﬁnish this chapter by presenting an elementary
proof of this fact. Our exposition follows a nonpublished manuscript of prof. Hudson
N. Lima (cf. [29]). We start by recalling a few rather simple facts on the calculus of
probabilities.
Let E be a ﬁnite nonempty set, said to be the sampling space, and P be a
probability distribution in E, i.e., a function P : E →[0, 1] such that

x∈E
P(x) = 1.
For each x ∈E, we call P(x) the probability of x; also, we say that the elements
of E are equiprobable provided
P(x) =
1
|E|, ∀x ∈E.
More generally, an event in E is a subset X of E, and we let its probability be
deﬁned by
P(X) =

x∈X
P(x).
Back to the problem we wish to analyse, let6 E = In × In and assume that the
elements of E are equiprobable, so that the probability of each one of them equals
1
n2 . Given n ∈N, let Pn be the probability that a randomly chosen ordered pair
(a, b) ∈E have relatively prime entries a and b. We want to show that
lim
n→∞Pn = 6
π2 .
We shall ﬁrst of all ﬁnd an adequate expression for Pn, and to this end we begin by
observing that Pn = |X|
n2 , where
X = {(a, b) ∈In × In; gcd(a, b) = 1}
is the event subjacent to Pn.
5Ernesto Cesàro, Italian mathematician of the nineteenth century.
6As in previous chapters, we set In = {1, 2, . . . , n}.

Elementary counting gives

We now need the following auxiliary result.

Proof Item (a) is the content of Problem 12, page 219. Concerning (b), note ﬁrstly
that the set of ordered pairs (d, k) of integers such that 1 ≤k ≤n and 0 < d | k
coincides with the set of ordered pairs (d, k) of integers such that 1 ≤d ≤n and
k = ld, for some integer 1 ≤l ≤n/d. Hence, we can change the order of the
involved sums, thus getting

With the last formula above at our disposal, we can state and prove the coming
proposition, which assures that the limit limn→∞Pn does exist and expresses it as
another limit which, as we shall see, can be effectively computed. We begin by
noticing that, since |μ(k)| ≤1 for every k ∈N and 
k≥1

k2 is convergent, the
series

k≥1

is absolutely convergent, hence convergent.

The former result reduced the proof of Cesàro’s theorem to showing that

To this end, we ﬁrst need to show the coming result.
Theorem 9.12

k≥1

k2 = π2
6 .
The proof we present is due to professors A. Yaglom and I. Yaglom (cf. Chapter 8
of [1]) and relies on some elementary results on complex numbers and roots of
polynomials; Chaps. 13 and 16 cover all that is necessary. The classical alternative
proof, relying upon the theory of Fourier Series, is delineated in problems 11 and 12
of Section 11.2 of [8] (alternatively, see Chapter 8 of [33] or Chapter 2 of [36]).
Proof The ﬁrst of de Moivre’s formulas (cf. Proposition 13.9) gives us

Thus, letting

xm−k,
we have shown that
f ((cot θ)2) = sin((2m + 1)θ)
(sin θ)(2m+1) .
(9.16)
Setting θk = (
k
2m+1)π for k = 1, 2, . . . , m, it is immediate from (9.16) that
(cot θ1)2, (cot θ2)2, . . . , (cot θm)2 are m distinct roots of f . However, since f has
degree m, we conclude that those are all of its complex roots. Now, the Girard-Viète
relations between coefﬁcients and roots of a polynomial (cf. Proposition 16.6) give
(cot θ1)2 + (cot θ2)2 + · · · + (cot θm)2 =
2m+1

From this, basic Trigonometry allows us to compute
(csc θ1)2 + · · · + (csc θm)2 = (1 + (cot θ1)2) + · · · + (1 + (cot θm)2)
= m + ((cot θ1)2 + · · · + (cot θm)2)
= m + m(2m −1)
3
= 2m(m + 1)
3
.
Finally, since θj ∈(0, π
2 ) for 1 ≤j ≤m, we have for 1 ≤j ≤m the inequalities
sin θj ≤θj ≤tan θj
or, which is the same,
(cot θj)2 ≤1
θ2

Multiplying the last inequalities above by

that

m(2m −1)
3(2m + 1)2 = lim

3(2m + 1)2 = 1

the squeezing principle for limits of sequences gives us the desired result.

Chapter 10
The Relation of Congruence
In this chapter, we deﬁne and explore the most basic properties of the important
relation of congruence modulo n > 1. Our central goal is to prove the famous
Fermat’s little theorem, as well as its generalization, due to Euler. The pervasiveness
of these two results in elementary Number Theory owes a great deal to the fact that
they form the starting point for a systematic study of the behavior of the remainders
of powers of a natural number a upon division by a given natural number n >
1, relatively prime with a. We also present the no less famous Chinese remainder
theorem, along with some interesting applications.
10.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
The central object of study in this section is the relation on Z deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 10.1 Let a, b and n be given integers, with n > 1. We say that a is
congruent to b, modulo n, and denote a ≡b (mod n), provided n | (a −b). If a is
not congruent to b modulo n, we write a ̸≡b (mod n).
Examples 10.2 According to the above deﬁnition, we can write:
(a) 3 ≡5 (mod 2), for 2 | (3 −5).
(b) −1 ≡11 (mod 12), for 12 | (−1 −11).
(c) 2 ≡−1 (mod 3), for 3 | (2 −(−1)).
(d) x ≡−x (mod 2), for 2 | (x −(−x)).
(e) 1 ̸≡2 (mod 3), for 3 ∤(1 −2).
(f) 20 ̸≡15 (mod 7), for 7 ∤(20 −15).
What are we really looking at when we consider congruences modulo n? In order
to answer such a question, let us observe what happens with the integers modulo 4,
for instance:

The Relation of Congruence
4k ≡0 (mod 4), 4k + 1 ≡1 (mod 4),
4k + 2 ≡2 (mod 4) and 4k + 3 ≡3 (mod 4).
Thus, the list . . . , −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . of integers is equal,
modulo 4, to
. . . , 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, . . .
(with 0 corresponding to 0, of course), and we readily see that every integer is
congruent, modulo 4, to its remainder upon division by 4. This result still holds
true in general, as shown by the following result.
Proposition 10.3 Let a and n be given integers, with n > 1.
(a) If a leaves remainder r upon division by n, then a ≡r (mod n). In particular,
every integer is congruent, modulo n, to exactly one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, . . .,
n −2, n −1.
(b) a ≡b (mod n) ⇔a and b leave equal remainders when divided by n.
Proof
(a) Assume that a leaves remainder r upon division by n. Then, the division
algorithm gives a = qn + r, for some integer q, and this gives that n | (a −r).
But this is the same as writing a ≡r (mod n). The rest is immediate.
(b) If a ≡b (mod n), then n | (a −b) and Corollary 6.9 (with a and b in place of
a1 and a2, and n in place of b) shows that a and b leave equal remainders when
divided by n. Conversely, if a and b leave the same remainder r upon division
by n, we can write a = nq1 + r and b = nq2 + r, with q1, q2 ∈Z. Therefore,
a −b = n(q1 −q2), so that n | (a −b). Hence, a ≡b (mod n).
⊓⊔
Remark 10.4 The deﬁnition of congruence modulo n excludes modulus n = 1 for,
otherwise, a ≡b (mod 1) would be a synonym of 1 | (a −b), which is always
true. Hence, any two integers would be indistinguishable modulo 1, so that such a
relation would be useless, as far as divisibility is concerned.
Since congruence modulo n only sees remainders upon division by n, the reader
may well be asking himself/herself what advantage(s) (if any) do we have in using
it. As we shall see in a while, the ﬁrst proﬁt is computational in nature. Indeed, in
the two coming propositions we prove some elementary properties of congruences
that will allow us, for instance, to mechanically compute the remainder we get upon
dividing 172002 by 13. Such a task is not so easy to accomplish by using the methods
we developed so far.
Proposition 10.5 Given integers a, b, c and n, with n > 1, we have:
(a) a ≡a (mod n).
(b) a ≡b (mod n) ⇒b ≡a (mod n).
(c) a ≡b (mod n) and b ≡c (mod n) ⇒a ≡c (mod n).

10.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
245
Proof Items (a) and (b) are immediate. Concerning (c), if a ≡b (mod n) and b ≡
c (mod n), then n | (a −b) and n | (b −c), and item i. of Remark 6.6 assures that n
also divides a −c = (a −b)+(b−c). But this is the same as having a ≡c (mod n).
⊓⊔
Proposition 10.6 Let a, b, c, d, m and n be given integers, with m, n > 1.
(a) If a ≡b (mod n) and c ≡d (mod n), then a + c ≡b + d (mod n) and ac ≡
bd (mod n). In particular, ac ≡bc (mod n).
(b) If a ≡b (mod n), then ak ≡bk (mod n) for every k ∈N.
(c) If c0, c1, . . . , cm ∈Z and f (x) = cmxm + · · · + c1x + c0 is a polynomial
function, then
a ≡b (mod n) ⇒f (a) ≡f (b) (mod n).
(d) If a ≡b (mod n), then gcd(a, n) = gcd(b, n).
(e) If a + c ≡b + c (mod n), then a ≡b (mod n).
(f) If ac ≡bc (mod n) and gcd(c, n) = d, then a ≡b (mod n
d ). In particular, if
gcd(c, n) = 1, then a ≡b (mod n).
(g) If a ≡b (mod mn), then a ≡b (mod m) and a ≡b (mod n).
(h) If a ≡b (mod n) and a ≡b (mod m), with gcd(m, n) = 1, then a ≡
b (mod mn).
Proof
(a) Since (a + c) −(b + d) = (a −b) + (c −d), ac −bd = a(c −d) + (a −b)d
and n | (a −b), n | (c −d), it follows from item (c) of Proposition 6.5 (see also
item i. of Remark 6.6) that n | [(a + c) −(b + d)] and n | (ac −bd). But this
is the same as having a + c ≡b + d (mod n) and ac ≡bd (mod n). Finally, the
particular case follows from c ≡c (mod n).
(b) Letting c = a and d = b in the second part of item (a), we get a2 ≡b2 (mod n).
On the other hand, had we already shown that al ≡bl (mod n) for some l ∈N,
then, once more from the second part of (a) (this time with c = al and d = bl),
we obtain
al+1 = a · al ≡b · bl = bl+1 (mod n).
Item (b) follows, then, by induction on k.
(c) If a ≡b (mod n), then we get from items (a) and (b) that ckak ≡ckbk (mod n),
for 0 ≤k ≤m. Hence, it follows from Problem 1 that
f (a) =
m

k=0
ckak ≡
m

k=0
ckbk = f (b) (mod n).

246
10
The Relation of Congruence
(d) Since a ≡b (mod n), there exists q ∈Z such that a = b + nq. We then wish to
show that
gcd(b + nq, n) = gcd(b, n).
But this is immediate from item (b) of Proposition 6.22.
(e) If a + c ≡b + c (mod n), then n divides (a + c) −(b + c) = a −b, which is
the same as a ≡b (mod n).
(f) Let n = dn′ and c = dc′, with c′ and n′ being relatively prime integers. From
ac ≡bc (mod n) we get (dn′) | [dc′(a−b)] or, which is the same, n′ | c′(a−b).
However, since gcd(n′, c′) = 1, item (a) of Proposition 6.22 gives n′ | (a −b).
Since n′ = n
d , this is the same as a ≡b (mod n
d ). The rest is immediate.
(g) If a ≡b (mod mn), then mn | (a −b), so that m | (a −b). This last relation is
equivalent to a ≡b (mod m). Analogously, a ≡b (mod n).
(h) Since m, n | (a −b) and gcd(m, n) = 1, it follows from item (d) of
Proposition 6.22 that mn | (a −b), which is exactly what we wanted to prove.
⊓⊔
We are now in position to solve the example below.
Example 10.7 Compute the remainder we get upon dividing 172002 by 13.
Solution Since 17 ≡4 (mod 13) and 16 ≡3 (mod 13), item (b) of the previous
proposition gives
172002 ≡42002 = 161001 ≡31001 (mod 13).
Now, observing that 33 ≡1 (mod 13) and applying items (a) and (b) of the same
proposition, we obtain
31001 = 32 · 3999 = 9 · (33)333 ≡9 · 1333 = 9 (mod 13).
Then, Proposition 10.3 guarantees that 172002 leaves remainder 9 when divided
by 13.
⊓⊔
The elementary properties of congruence deduced in Proposition 10.6 allow us
to establish the criterion of divisibility by 9 in a much simpler way that that hinted
to in Problem 1, page 162. This is our next
Example 10.8 A natural number n and the sum of the algarisms of its decimal
representation leave equal remainders upon division by 9.
Proof Letting n = (akak−1 . . . a1a0)10 be the decimal representation of the natural
number n, we have
n = ak10k + ak−110k−1 + · · · + a110 + a0.

10.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
247
Since 10 ≡1 (mod 9), item (c) of Proposition 10.6 (with f (x) = akxk+ak−1xk−1+
· · · + a1x + a0) gives
n = f (10) ≡f (1) = ak + ak−1 + · · · + a1 + a0 (mod 9).
The rest follows from item (b) of Proposition 10.3.
⊓⊔
As an additional example of the computational simpliﬁcation the congruence
relation brings (and for future reference), we shall prove once again the results
of Corollary 6.8 and Example 6.10. Before that, however, it is time we make the
following simple remark.
As we already know, every integer is congruent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, modulo 7;
also, since
4 ≡−3(mod 7), 5 ≡−2(mod 7) and 6 ≡−1(mod 7),
we conclude that every integer is congruent, modulo 7, to one of 0, ±1, ±2 or ±3.
On the other hand, every integer is congruent to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, modulo 8;
however, since
5 ≡−3(mod 8), 6 ≡−2(mod 8) and 7 ≡−1(mod 8),
it follows that every integer is congruent, modulo 8, to 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 or 4. The
advantage of replacing, modulo 7, the integers from 0 to 6 by 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 lies
on the fact that, if in some context one needs to raise the remainders upon division
by 7 to some exponent k, then one is likely to have much less work by using 0, ±1,
±2, ±3 in place of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, for (−x)k = ±xk. By the same token, it is
sometimes advantageous to replace, modulo 8, the usual remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 by 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, 4.
Generalizing the discussion of the previous paragraph, it is not hard to verify
that:
i. If n = 2k, then every integer is congruent, modulo n, to one of
0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±(k −1), k.
ii. If n = 2k + 1, then every integer is congruent, modulo n, to one of
0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±k.
We shall go one step further in formalizing the above discussion when we study
the concept of
complete residue systems, in Sect. 11.1. For the time being, we
establish the above mentioned results.

248
10
The Relation of Congruence
Proposition 10.9 For every a ∈Z, one has:
(a) a2 ≡0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9 (mod 10).
(b) a2 ≡0 or 1 (mod 3).
(c) a2 ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).
(d) a2 ≡0, 1 or 4 (mod 8).
(e) a4 ≡0 or 1 (mod 16).
Proof
(a) Modulo 10, we have a ≡0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4 or 5, so that
a2 ≡02, (±1)2, (±2)2, (±3)2, (±4)2 or 52 (mod 10)
or, which is the same, a2 ≡0, 1, 4, 9, 6 or 5 (mod 10). However, since the last
digit of a natural number is equal to the remainder we get upon dividing it by
10, it follows that the last digit of a2 is equal to one of 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9.
(b) We know that a ≡0 or ±1 (mod 3), so that a2 ≡02 or (±1)2 (mod 3). Hence,
a2 ≡0 or 1 (mod 3).
(c) Since a ≡0, ±1 or 2 (mod 4), we get a2 ≡02, (±1)2 or 22 (mod 4). Since
22 ≡0 (mod 4), it follows that a2 ≡0 or 1 (mod 4).
(d) As in the previous items, we have a ≡0, ±1, ±2, ±3 or 4 (mod 8), and then
a2 ≡02, (±1)2, (±2)2, (±3)2 or 42 (mod 8).
Now, 32 = 9 ≡1 and 42 = 16 ≡0 (mod 8), so that a2 ≡0, 1 or 4 (mod 8).
(e) By item (d), we have a2 = 8q + r, with q ∈N and r = 0, 1 or 4. Hence,
a4 = (8q + r)2 = 16(4q2 + qr) + r2 = 16q′ + 0 or 16q′ + 1,
with q′ ∈N.
⊓⊔
The coming examples show how we can use what we have learned up to this
point about congruences to solve various interesting problems. Generally speaking,
the solutions we shall present will be a mixture of a judicious use of one or
more congruence relations, together with other ideas, each of which adapted to
the situation at hand. The reader should make an effort to perceive exactly how
each used tool helps in paving the way to the ﬁnal solution, for this attitude will be
of great help in preparing him/her to tackle the problems posed at the end of the
section.
Example 10.10 (Italy) Find all x, y ∈N for which x2 + 615 = 2y.
Solution Looking at the given equation modulo 3, we obtain
x2 + 0 ≡(−1)y (mod 3).

10.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
249
Now, by item (b) of Proposition 10.9, we have x2 ≡0 or 1 (mod 3), so that the
congruence above gives us the following possibilities:
0 ≡(−1)y (mod 3) or 1 ≡(−1)y (mod 3).
The ﬁrst one clearly never occurs. In what concerns the second, if y is odd, we get
1 ≡−1 (mod 3), which never happens too. Hence, y must be even, say y = 2z,
with z ∈N. The stated equation can then be written as
615 = 22z −x2 = (2z −x)(2z + x).
Finally, since 2z + x > 2z −x and 615 = 3 · 5 · 41, we are left to analysing the
linear systems below:
2z + x = 615
2z −x = 1
,
 2z + x = 205
2z −x = 3
,
2z + x = 123
2z −x = 5
or
2z + x = 41
2z −x = 15 .
To this end, in each case we add both equations to obtain 2z+1 = 616, 208, 128
or 56, respectively. However, since 2z+1 is a power of 2, the only allowed possibility
is 2z+1 = 128, so that
2z + x = 123
2z −x = 5
.
Then, z = 6 and x = 59, and the only solution to the original equation is x = 59
and y = 2z = 12.
⊓⊔
Example 10.11 (OIM) Find all m, n ∈N such that 2m + 1 = 3n.
Solution If m = 1, then clearly n = 1. If m ≥2, then 2m ≡0 (mod 4) and, looking
at the equation modulo 4, we obtain
1 ≡(−1)n (mod 4).
It follows that n must be even, say n = 2u, with u ∈N. Substituting this into the
given equation, we get 2m + 1 = 32u or, which is the same,
2m = (3u −1)(3u + 1).
In view of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the equality above assures
that both 3u −1 and 3u + 1 must be powers of 2. To get further information, let
d = gcd(3u −1, 3u + 1) and observe that
d | [(3u + 1) −(3u −1)],

250
10
The Relation of Congruence
i.e., d | 2; however, since 3u −1 and 3u + 1 are both even numbers, we have d = 2.
Now, the only way the gcd of two powers of 2 can be equal to 2 is when the smallest
one is itself equal to 2, so that the only possibility is to have
 3u −1 = 2
3u + 1 = 2m−1 .
Thus, u = 1, m = 3 and, hence, n = 2.
⊓⊔
Example 10.12 (OCM) Do the following items:
(a) Prove that there does exist x, y, z ∈N such that 13x4 + 3y4 −z4 = 2013.
(b) Prove that there does not exist x, y, z ∈N such that 13x4 + 3y4 −z4 = 2014.
Proof
(a) Letting z = 2x, we get y4−x4 = 671 or, which is the same, (y2−x2)(y2+x2) =
11·61. Hence, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic gives us the possibilities
y2 −x2 = 1
y2 + x2 = 471
and
y2 −x2 = 11
y2 + x2 = 61 ,
so that x = 5, y = 6 and z = 2x = 10.
(b) By the sake of contradiction, assume that a solution does exist. Item (e) of
Proposition 10.9 gives a4 ≡0 or 1 (mod 8), for every a ∈Z. Therefore,
13x4 + 3y4 −z4 ≡0, 2, 4, 5 or 7 (mod 8). However, since 2014 ≡6 (mod 8),
we have reached a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The reader will probably notice that the solutions of our last two examples are
somewhat more terse than those of the previous ones. An effective training for the
proposed problems is to fulﬁll the omitted details.
Example 10.13 (Romania) Let m, n, p ∈N, where p is an odd prime. If 7m+p·2n
7m−p·2n ∈
N, prove that such a number is itself prime.
Proof Let a = 7m+p·2n
7m−p·2n . Since
a = 1 +
p · 2n+1
7m −p · 2n = −1 +
2 · 7m
7m −p · 2n ,
it follows that (7m−p·2n) | gcd(p·2n+1, 2·7m). Now, there are two possibilities:
(i) p = 7: in this case,
(7m −7 · 2n) | gcd(7 · 2n+1, 2 · 7m) = 14,
which gives 7m−1 −2n = 1. Analysing such an equation modulo 3, we reach a
contradiction.

10.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
251
(ii) p ̸= 7: in this case, we get gcd(p·2n+1, 2·7m) = 2 and, hence, (7m−p·2n) | 2.
Again, this implies 7m −p · 2n = 1 and, looking at such last equality also
modulo 3, we obtain 1m −p · 2n ≡1 (mod 3), so that p = 3. It follows that
7m −3 · 2n = 1 and a = 7m + 3 · 2n.
If m = 1, then n = 1 and, hence a = 13, a prime number. If m > 1, then
n > 1 and
2n−1 = 7m −1
6
= 7m−1 + · · · + 7 + 1.
It follows that m is even, say m = 2k. Thus, we get 49k −1 = 3 · 2n and
distinguish two subcases:
•
If k = 1, then m = 2, n = 4 and a = 97, once more a prime number.
•
If k > 1 then, factoring 49k −1, we get
49k−1 + · · · + 49 + 1 = 2n−3.
Such an equality gives k even and, writing k = 2l, we obtain
3 · 2n = 492l −1 ≡(−1)2l −1 ≡0 (mod 5),
which is an absurd.
⊓⊔
Example 10.14 (BMO) Let (an)n≥1 be the sequence deﬁned for n ≥1 by an =
2n + 49. Find all integers n ≥1 for which an = pq and an+1 = rs, where p, q, r,
s are primes such that p < q, r < s and q −p = s −r.
Solution Let n be a natural number for which an and an+1 satisfy the stated
conditions. If p, r > 3, then we get p, q, r, s ≡1 or 5 (mod 6). However, since
52 ≡1 (mod 6), in any case we obtain pq, rs ≡1 or 5 (mod 6). On the other
hand, if k denotes the odd element of {n, n + 1}, then 2k ≡2 (mod 6), whence
2k + 49 ≡2 + 1 = 3 (mod 6), which, in turn, is an absurd. Thus, we must have
p ≤3 or r ≤3, so that at least one of p, r must be equal to 3 (for an and an+1 are
both odd).
If p ≥r, then q = s + p −r ≥s, implying that an = pq ≥rs = an+1, a
contradiction. Therefore, p < r, and hence p = 3 and q = 3 + s −r. We thus get
an = pq = 3(3 + s −r). On the other hand, we also have
2an = 2n+1 + 98 = (2n+1 + 49) + 49 = an+1 + 49 = rs + 49,
so that 6(3 + s −r) = rs + 49. This gives r = 6 −
67
s+6, and hence s = 61, r = 5,
q = 59. Then,
3 · 59 = an = 2n + 49 ⇒2n = 128 ⇒n = 7.

(a) If x = 0, the equation reduces to 7y + 4 = 3z, so that z ≥2. Use modulo 9

y is also even.
(c) If x = 2s and y = 2t, with s, t ∈N, show that (x +1)t −1 and (x +1)t +1
have gcd equal to 2. From this, use modulo x to show that (x+1)t −1 = 2sz
and (x + 1)t + 1 = 2z−1.
(d) Use inequality 2sz < 2z−1 to show that s = 1. Then, successively get
x = 2, t = 1, y = 2 and z = 3.
10.2
The Theorems of Euler and Fermat
The effective use of congruences to compute remainders is considerably simpliﬁed
if we ﬁnd exponents which make a certain power congruent to 1. For instance,
knowing that 73 ≡1 (mod 9) it rests much easier to compute the remainder of
251001 upon division by 9: since 25 ≡7 (mod 9), we have
251001 ≡71001 = (73)333 · 72 ≡1333 · 49 ≡4 (mod 9).
In this direction, given relatively prime integers a and n, with n > 1, the purpose
of this section is to ﬁnd an exponent k ∈N for which
ak ≡1 (mod n).
To this end, we shall ﬁrst look at the case in which n is prime, thus proving one of
the most important results of the elementary theory of congruences: Fermat’s little
theorem.1
Theorem 10.15 (Fermat) Given a, p ∈Z, with p prime, we have ap ≡a (mod p).
In particular, if gcd(a, p) = 1, then
ap−1 ≡1 (mod p).
(10.1)
Proof If ap ≡a (mod p), then p divides ap −a = a(ap−1 −1). Hence, if
gcd(a, p) = 1, then (10.1) follows from item (a) of Proposition 6.22.
1A combinatorial proof of Fermat’s little theorem was the object of Problem 5, page 57.

10.2
The Theorems of Euler and Fermat
255
It thus sufﬁces to show that ap ≡a (mod p), for every a ∈Z. If p = 2, there is
nothing to do, for a2 −a = a(a −1), being the product of two consecutive integers,
is always even. Let us now assume that p > 2 and prove the desired result, ﬁrstly for
a > 0, by induction on a. For a = 1, there is nothing to do. Assume, by induction
hypothesis, that the theorem holds for a certain natural value of a, i.e., assume that
kp ≡k (mod p), for some k ∈N. For a = k + 1, we have
(k + 1)p −(k + 1) = (kp −k) +
p−1

j=1
p


kp−j.
However, since p | (kp−k) (by induction hypothesis) and p |
p
j

for 1 ≤j ≤p−1
(by Example 6.42), it follows that p divides (k + 1)p −(k + 1), so that (k + 1)p ≡
(k + 1) (mod p).
Let us now look at the case a ≤0 and p odd. If a = 0, once more there is nothing
to do. If a < 0, then, since p is odd, what we did above gives
ap = −(−a)p ≡−(−a) = a (mod p).
⊓⊔
Before we extend Fermat’s little theorem to a composite modulo, we collect a
few examples that illustrate some applications of it.
Example 10.16 If p and q are distinct primes, prove that pq divides pq−1+qp−1−1.
Proof Since p and q are distinct primes, we have gcd(p, q) = 1. Hence, by
Fermat’s little theorem, q divides pq−1 −1. However, since q obviously divides
qp−1, we conclude that q divides qq−1 + (pq−1 −1) as well. Analogously, p
divides pq−1 + (qp−1 −1). Finally, since p and q both divide pq−1 + qp−1 −1
and are relatively prime, item (d) of Proposition 6.22 guarantees that pq divides
pq−1 + qp−1 −1 too.
⊓⊔
Example 10.17 (Romania) Let p and q be prime numbers, with q ̸= 5. If q | (2p +
3p), prove that q > p.
Proof Since q | (2p + 3p), we clearly have q ̸= 2, 3; since q ̸= 5 by hypothesis,
we thus have q > 5. Hence, we can assume that p > 3. If q ≤p, then q −
1 < p, so that q −1 and p are relatively prime. In such a case, Bézout’s theorem
assures the existence of x, y ∈N such that px = (q −1)y + 1. Therefore, from
2p ≡−3p(mod q) we successively get (2p)x ≡(−3p)x(mod q) and (since −3p =
(−3)p)
2(q−1)y+1 ≡(−3)(q−1)y+1(mod q).

256
10
The Relation of Congruence
Finally, since q ̸= 2, 3, Fermat’s little theorem gives 2q−1, (−3)q−1 ≡1 (mod q);
then, the above congruence reduces to 2 ≡−3(mod q), so that q = 5. Finally, such
a conclusion is obviously a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Example 10.18 (BMO) Let p > 2 be a prime number such that 3 | (p −2), and let
S = {y2 −x3 −1; 0 ≤x, y < p and x, y ∈Z}.
Prove that S contains at most p −1 multiples of p.
Proof If 0 ≤u, v ≤p −1 and u3 ≡v3 (mod p), we claim that u = v. To this
end, start by noticing that u3 ≡v3 ≡0 (mod p) if and only if u = v = 0; on the
other hand, for 1 ≤u, v ≤p −1, Fermat’s little theorem, together with the fact that
p −1 = 3k + 1, give
u3k+1 ≡v3k+1 (mod p).
(10.2)
Now,
u3 ≡v3 (mod p) ⇒u3k ≡v3k (mod p),
and it comes from (10.2) that
u3ku ≡v3kv ≡u3kv (mod p).
Finally, cancelling out u3 from the above congruence, we obtain u ≡v (mod p);
condition 1 ≤u, v ≤p −1 thus implies that u = v.
The above discussion guarantees that
{x3; 0 ≤x ≤p −1} = {0, 1, . . . , p −1}.
(10.3)
On the other hand, y2 −x3 −1 ∈S is a multiple of p if and only if y2 ≡x3 −
1 (mod p). Hence, it follows from (10.3) that, for each 0 ≤y ≤p −1, there exists
a single 0 ≤x ≤p −1 for which p divides y2 −x3 −1.
The above reasoning would provide us with at most p multiples of p in S.
Nevertheless, note that 0 = 12 −03 −1 = 33 −23 −1 is represented twice in
S, so that S actually contains no more that p −1 multiples of p.
⊓⊔
We generalize Fermat’s little theorem with the following result of L. Euler, which
brings Euler’s function ϕ into prominence. For its statement, notice that if ak ≡
1 (mod n), then item (d) of Proposition 10.6 assures that gcd(ak, n) = gcd(1, n) =
1; in particular, gcd(a, n) = 1.
Theorem 10.19 (Euler)
If a and n are relatively prime integers, with n > 1, then
aϕ(n) ≡1 (mod n).

10.2
The Theorems of Euler and Fermat
257
Proof Let p be a prime factor of n and k be a natural number. We start by making
induction on k to show that
aϕ(pk) ≡1 (mod pk).
(10.5)
Case k
= 1 reduces to Fermat’s little theorem. Now, assume, by induction
hypothesis, that aϕ(pl) ≡1 (mod pl), for some natural l. Then, aϕ(pl) = plq + 1 for
some integer q, and we have
aϕ(pl+1) −1 = ap·ϕ(pl) −1 = (aϕ(pl))p −1

⊓⊔
As in the case of Fermat’s little theorem, we pause to see, in a few examples,
some interesting applications of Euler’s theorem.
Example 10.20 (Brazil) Prove that there exists an integer k > 2 such that the
number 1 99 . . . 9
  
k
1 is a multiple of 1991.

10
The Relation of Congruence
Proof Notice ﬁrstly that
1 99 . . . 9
  
k
1 = 2 · 10k+1 −9.
Hence, we want to ﬁnd an integer k > 2 such that
2 · 10k+1 ≡9 (mod 1991).
To this end, since 2 · 103 ≡9 (mod 1991), we have
2 · 10k+1 ≡9 (mod 1991) ⇔2 · 10k+1 ≡2 · 103 (mod 1991)
⇔10k−2 ≡1 (mod 1991).
For what is left to do, note that 1991 = 11·181 and 181 is prime (by Eratostenes’
sieve, for instance). Hence, ϕ(1991) = ϕ(11) · ϕ(181) = 10 · 180 = 1800, and
Euler’s theorem gives 101800 ≡1 (mod 1991). Therefore, it sufﬁces to take k −2 =
1800.
⊓⊔
Example 10.21 (Romania) Let a and n be given natural numbers. Show that we can
choose n pairwise relatively prime elements from the set
A = {a2 + a −1, a3 + a2 −1, a4 + a3 −1, . . .}.
Proof By induction, let k ∈N and assume that we have already established the
existence of a subset Bk ⊂A such that |Bk| = k and the elements of Bk are pairwise
relatively prime. Let
m =

x∈Bk
x.
Since m ≡1 (mod a), we have gcd(a, m) = 1. Therefore, Euler’s theorem gives
aϕ(m) ≡1 (mod m).
If y = aϕ(m)+1 + aϕ(m) −1, then y ∈A. We claim that gcd(y, x) = 1 for every
x ∈Bk. To this end, it sufﬁces to show that gcd(y, m) = 1. However, again from
Euler’s theorem, we get
y = aϕ(m)+1 + aϕ(m) −1 ≡a + 1 −1 = a (mod m),
and item (d) of Proposition 10.6 guarantees that
gcd(y, m) = gcd(a, m) = 1.
Hence, the set Bk+1 = Bk ∪{y} is formed by k + 1 pairwise relatively prime
elements of A, thus completing the induction step.
⊓⊔

10.2
The Theorems of Euler and Fermat
259
For the next example, note that if a, k ∈N, then the decimal representation of ak
has exactly ⌊k log10 a⌋+ 1 digits. Indeed, letting m denote the number of algarisms
of ak, we have 10m−1 ≤ak < 10m and, then,
m −1 ≤log10 ak < m;
hence, m −1 = ⌊log10 ak⌋= ⌊k log10 a⌋, as wished.
Example 10.22 Prove that there exists a power of 2 with 1000 consecutive zeros in
its decimal representation.
Proof We wish to ﬁnd m ∈N such that the decimal representation of 2m is of the
form
2m = (∗∗. . . ∗00 . . . 0
  
1000
∗∗. . . ∗)10.
Alternatively, letting A and B denote the natural numbers formed by the portions of
the decimal expansion of 2m situated respectively to the right and to the left of the
sequence of the 1000 consecutive zeros, we want to ﬁnd m ∈N such that
2m = B · 101000+a + A,
with the decimal representation of A having at most a digits.
To this end, if we let k = 1000 + a and A = 2k, we will have
2m = B · 101000+a + A
if and only if the decimal representation of 2k has at most k −1000 algarisms and
(dividing both sides of the last equality displayed above by 2k) 2m−k = B · 5k + 1.
In turn, this last condition will hold if and only if 2m−k ≡1 (mod 5k).
We then have to show that it is possible to obtain k, m ∈N such that: (i) m > k;
(ii) the decimal representation of 2k has at most k −1000 algarisms; (iii) 2m−k ≡
1 (mod 5k). Let us start by analysing conditions (i) and (iii).
By Euler’s theorem, we have 2ϕ(5k) ≡1 (mod 5k). Now, since ϕ(5k) = 4 · 5k−1,
there must exist q ∈N such that 24·5k−1 = 5kq + 1. Letting m = k + 4 · 5k−1, we
have m > k and 2m−k ≡1 (mod 5k).
We are then left to showing that it is possible to ﬁnd k ∈N such that the
decimal representation of 2k has at most k −1000 digits. To this end, the discussion
preceding the statement of this example assures that the decimal representation of
2k has exactly ⌊k log10 2⌋+ 1, so that it sufﬁces to ask that the following inequality
holds:
⌊k log10 2⌋+ 1 ≤k −1000.

260
10
The Relation of Congruence
However, since
k −⌊k log10 2⌋> k −k log10 2 = k log10 5,
it is enough to start by taking a natural number k for which k log10 5 > 1001. This
is surely possible.

divides at least one of x, y and z. To this end, show the items below:
(a) We can assume that x, y and z are pairwise relatively prime and that p > 2.
(b) If xp + yp + zp = 0, then p | (x + y + z).
(c) By contradiction, assume from now on that p ∤x, y, z. If r ̸= p is a prime

Linear Congruences and the Chinese Remainder
Theorem
In this section, we study linear equations and systems of equations involving
congruences.
We ﬁrst consider linear congruences, i.e., congruences of the form
ax ≡b (mod n),
(10.6)
with a, b and n being given integers, such that a ̸= 0 and n > 1, and we search for
the solutions (or roots) x ∈Z of the equation, i.e., the integers x for which (10.6)
holds true.
As a particular case of the above situation, we say that a is invertible modulo n
if the linear congruence (10.6) has a solution when b = 1, i.e., if there exists x ∈Z
such that
ax ≡1 (mod n).
If this is so, then such an integer x is said to be an inverse of a, modulo n. In this
respect, we have the following important
Proposition 10.23 An integer a is invertible modulo n if and only if gcd(a, n) = 1.
In this case, any two inverses of a, modulo n, are congruent modulo n.
Proof If a is invertible modulo n, then there exists x ∈Z such that ax ≡1 (mod n).
Then, there exists y ∈Z for which ax = ny+1 or, which is the same, xa+(−y)n =
1. In view of such an equality, we know from Corollary 6.16 that gcd(a, n) = 1.
Conversely, recall that Bézout’s theorem guarantees that the gcd of any two inte-
gers can always be written as a linear combination of them. Hence, if gcd(a, n) = 1
then there exist x, y ∈Z such that ax + ny = 1, and it immediately follows from
this that ax ≡1 (mod n).
Finally, let both x and y be inverses of a, modulo n. Then
ax ≡1 ≡ay (mod n),
so that ax ≡ay (mod n). However, since gcd(a, n) = 1, Proposition 10.6 gives
x ≡y (mod n). Thus, a has, modulo n, a single inverse.
⊓⊔
Corollary 10.24 If a, p ∈Z, with p prime, then a is invertible modulo p if and
only if p ∤a. Moreover, in this case the inverse of a modulo p is unique.

264
10
The Relation of Congruence
Proof Immediate from the fact that gcd(a, p) = 1 ⇔p ∤a.
⊓⊔
Corollary 10.25 Let a, b, n ∈Z, with n > 1. If a is invertible modulo n, then the
linear congruence ax ≡b (mod n) always has a single solution modulo n, namely,
x ≡aϕ(n)−1b (mod n).
In particular, every inverse of a, modulo n, is congruent to aϕ(n)−1, modulo n.
Proof If a is invertible modulo n, then gcd(a, n) = 1. Hence, successively applying
item (f) of Proposition 10.6 and Euler’s theorem, we get
ax ≡b (mod n) ⇔aϕ(n)x ≡aϕ(n)−1b (mod n) ⇔x ≡aϕ(n)−1b (mod n).
⊓⊔
Since any two inverses of a modulo n are always congruent modulo n, from now
on we shall say that a has a single inverse modulo n. Such an inverse will be denoted
by a−1, whenever there is no danger of confusion with the usual inverse 1
a of a with
respect to the multiplication in Q.
As an application of the notion of inversion modulo n, we shall now prove the
famous primality criterion known as Wilson’s theorem.3
Theorem 10.26 (Wilson) A natural number p is prime if and only if
(p −1)! ≡−1 (mod p).
Proof If p = mn, with m and n integers and 1 < n < p, then (p −1)! ≡
−1 (mod p) implies (p −1)! ≡−1 (mod n). On the other hand, since 1 < n ≤
p −1, we also have that n | (p −1)!, i.e., (p −1)! ≡0 (mod n). Therefore,
0 ≡(p −1)! ≡−1 (mod n), and hence n | 1, which is a contradiction.
Conversely, let p be prime and consider the function
f : {1, 2, . . . , p −1} →{1, 2, . . . , p −1},
that associates to each a ∈{1, 2, . . . , p −1} its inverse a−1 ∈{1, 2, . . . , p −1},
modulo p. Corollary 10.25 assures that f é uma bijeção, with f (a) = b ⇔f (b) =
a. Moreover,

test, in practice Wilson’s theorem is not so useful, for, according to Stirling’s formula (cf. [8], for
instance), n! grows exponentially as n →+∞.

f (a) = a ⇔a2 ≡1 (mod p)

Back to equations involving congruences, a natural generalization of the linear
congruence (10.6) is obtained by considering solutions of a system of linear
congruences. In this sense, the following result, known as the Chinese remainder
theorem, examines the existence of solutions for such systems.
Theorem 10.27 Let m1, m2, . . . , mk be pairwise relatively prime naturals, all
greater than 1. For arbitrarily given integers a1, a2, . . . , ak, the system of linear
congruences
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
x ≡a1 (mod m1)
x ≡a2 (mod m2)
. . .
x ≡ak (mod mk)
(10.7)
admits a unique solution, modulo m1m2 . . . mk. Yet in another way, there exists a
single integer 0 ≤y < m1m2 . . . mk such that x ∈Z satisﬁes the system above if
and only if
x ≡y (mod m1m2 . . . mk).
Proof Note ﬁrst that if x1 and x2 are any two solutions of the above system, then
x1 ≡ai ≡x2 (mod mi), ∀1 ≤i ≤k.

266
10
The Relation of Congruence
However, since m1, . . . , mk are pairwise relatively prime, it follows from
Proposition 10.6 that
x1 ≡x2 (mod m1m2 . . . mk).
Hence, if the system (10.7) has a solution at all, this will be unique, modulo
m1m2 . . . mk.
For the existence of a solution, for 1 ≤j ≤k let
yj =

1≤i≤k
i̸=j
mi,
so that gcd(yj, mj) = 1. Let also bj be the inverse of yj modulo mj and x =
k
j=1 ajbjyj. For a ﬁxed 1 ≤l ≤k, we have yj ≡0 (mod ml) whenever j ̸= l;
hence, modulo ml we get
x ≡alblyl ≡al · 1 ≡al (mod ml).
⊓⊔
Problem 5 offers an alternative proof for the existence of solutions for the system
of linear congruences (10.7). In order to ﬁnish this section, let us see an example
who shows how it is possible to apply the Chinese remainder theorem to obtain
interesting results.4
Example 10.28 Given an integer n > 1, show that there exist n consecutive and
composite natural numbers.
Proof Choose n distinct primes p1, p2, . . . , pn and consider the system of linear
congruences

assures the existence of m ∈N satisfying the above system. Hence, p2

1 ≤j ≤n, so that m + 1, m + 2, . . . , m + n are all composite natural numbers.

f (x) ≡0 (mod pα) will be presented in Problem 11, page 394.
6The hypotheses that the arithmetic progression is nonconstant and has relatively prime initial term
and common ratio are actually unnecessary. They were assumed just to simplify the solution of the
problem.

Chapter 11
Congruence Classes
In this chapter, we return to the point of view of Example 2.21, looking at
congruence modulo n as an equivalence relation. As a byproduct of our discussion, a
number of interesting applications will be presented, among which is an alternative,
simpler proof of Euler’s theorem. We will also introduce the quotient set Zn and
show that it can be furnished with operations of addition and multiplication quite
similar to those of Z. In particular, the case of Zp, with p prime, will be crucial to
our future discussion of polynomials.
11.1
Systems of Residues
Given an integer n > 1, Proposition 10.5 assures that the relation ∼in Z, deﬁned by
a ∼b ⇔a ≡b (mod n),
is an equivalence relation, called the congruence relation modulo n.
For a ∈Z, we let the congruence class of a, modulo n, be deﬁned as the
equivalence class a of a with respect to the relation of congruence modulo n:
a = {x ∈Z; x ≡a (mod n)}
= {x ∈Z; x = a + nq, ∃q ∈Z}
= {. . . , −2n + a, −n + a, a, n + a, 2n + a, . . .}.
(11.1)
Given a ∈Z, we know that there exists a single integer 0 ≤r < n (the remainder
of the division of a by n) such that a ≡r (mod n). Therefore, {0, 1, . . . , n −1} is

a system of distinct representatives for the relation of congruence modulo n, and
Proposition 2.16 together with (2.12) furnish the partition
Z = 0 ∪1 ∪· · · ∪n −1
(11.2)
of Z. More generally, we have the following important
Deﬁnition 11.1 A complete residue system modulo n, (abbreviated CRS) is a
system of distinct representatives for the congruence relation modulo n.
It follows from (11.2) and (11.1) that every CRS modulo n is a set {a0, a1,
. . . , an−1} of integers, such that ar ≡r (mod n) for 0 ≤r ≤n −1. Alternatively,
since 0 = n, we can view a CRS modulo n a set {a1, a2, . . . , an} of integers, such
that ar ≡r (mod n) for 1 ≤r ≤n. Yet in another way, a set of n integers is a CRS
modulo n if and only if its elements are pairwise incongruent modulo n.
Example 11.2 Given an integer n > 1, the sets {0, 1, 2, . . . , n−1} and {1, 2, . . . , n}
are obviously CRS modulo n. Another example is furnished by the set

x ∈Z; −n
2 ≤x < n
2

.
Indeed, note ﬁrst that if −n
2 ≤x < y < n
2, then x ̸≡y (mod n), for 0 < y −x < n.
Now, it sufﬁces to separately consider the cases n even and n odd, in order to show
that the set displayed above has exactly n elements.
The coming proposition provides a useful way of constructing new CRS out of
given ones.
Proposition 11.3
(a) Let a, b and n be given integers, with n > 1 and a and n relatively prime.
If the set {x0, x1, . . . , xn−1} is a CRS modulo n, then the set {ax0 + b, ax1 +
b, . . . , axn−1 + b} is also a CRS modulo n.
(b) Let m and n be integers greater than 1 and relatively prime. If the sets
{x0, x1, . . . , xm−1} and {y0, y1, . . . , yn−1} are CRS modulo m and n, respec-
tively, then the set
{nxi + myj; 0 ≤i < m, 0 ≤j < n}
is a CRS modulo mn.
Proof
(a) Since every CRS modulo n has n elements, it sufﬁces to show that if 0 ≤i,
j < n and
axi + b ≡axj + b (mod n),

11.1
Systems of Residues
271
then i = j. To this end, it follows from the above congruence that axi ≡
axj (mod n). Now, since gcd(a, n) = 1, item (f) of Proposition 10.6 guarantees
that xi ≡xj (mod n). Finally, since {x0, x1, . . . , xn−1} is a CRS modulo n, this
last congruence gives us i = j.
(b) Analogously to the proof of item (a), it sufﬁces to show that if 0 ≤i, j < m,
0 ≤k, l < n and
nxi + myk ≡nxj + myl (mod mn),
then i = j and k = l. Assuming the validity of the above congruence, we have
from item (g) of Proposition 10.6 that
nxi + myk ≡nxj + myl (mod m) and nxi + myk ≡nxj + myl (mod n).
In turn, the last two congruences above readily give
nxi ≡nxj (mod m) and myk ≡myl (mod n).
However, since m and n are relatively prime, by applying again item (f) of
Proposition 10.6 we obtain
xi ≡xj (mod m) and yk ≡yl (mod n).
Finally, since {x0, x1, . . . , xm−1} and {y0, y1, . . . , yn−1} are CRS modulo m and
n, respectively, we get i = j and k = l.
⊓⊔
The previous proposition furnishes a proof of a particular case of the chinese
remainder theorem which sheds light in the proof of the general case presented in
the last section. In this respect, see also Problems 2 and 3.
Example 11.4 Let m1 and m2 be relatively prime naturals greater than 1, and a1 and
a2 be arbitrarily given integers. We will show that the system of linear congruences
x ≡a1 (mod m1)
x ≡a2 (mod m2)
(11.3)
has a single solution, modulo m1m2.
To this end, item (b) of the previous proposition assures that
{m1u1 + m2u2; xi ∈Z and 1 ≤ui ≤mi for i = 1, 2}
is a CRS modulo m1m2. If we set x = m1u1 + m2u2, for some such u1 and u2, then
x ≡m2u2 (mod m1) and x ≡m1u1 (mod m2).

272
11
Congruence Classes
Therefore, by the transitivity of congruences, x will solve (11.3) if and only if
we can choose 1 ≤u1 ≤m1 and 1 ≤u2 ≤m2 such that
m2u2 ≡a1 (mod m1) and m1u1 ≡a2 (mod m2).
Although Corollary 10.25 assures we can uniquely choose such u1 and u2, this
is also an immediate consequence of item (a) of the previous proposition. Indeed,
since gcd(m1, m2) = 1, that item guarantees that
{m2x2; 1 ≤x2 ≤m1}
is a CRS modulo m1; hence, there is a single 1 ≤u2 ≤m1 such that m2u2 ≡
a1 (mod m1). By the same token, there is a single 1 ≤u1 ≤m2 such that m1u1 ≡
a2 (mod m2).
The coming example brings a beautiful combinatorial application of the concept
of complete residue system, which appeared as the last problem of the 1995 IMO.1
For what is to come, recall that for Z ⊂R and r ∈R we write Z + r to denote the
set Z + r = {z + r; z ∈Z}.
Example 11.5 (IMO) Let p be an odd prime. Compute the number of subsets of p
elements of the set {1, 2, . . . , 2p} such that the sum of the elements of each such
subset is divisible by p.
Solution Let F be the family of the
2p
p

−2 subsets of p elements of the set
{1, 2, . . . , 2p}, different from X = {1, 2, . . . , p} and Y = {p + 1, p + 2, . . . , 2p}
(notice that these two sets have sums of elements equal to multiples of p).
Let ∼be the relation deﬁned in F by setting A ∼B if and only if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) There exists 0 ≤r ≤p −1 such that (A ∩X) + r = B ∩X (mod p).
(ii) A ∩Y = B ∩Y.
(Here, according to the paragraph that immediately precedes Example 2.22, for
r ∈R and Z ⊂R we let Z + r = {z + r; z ∈Z}.)
It is immediate to verify that ∼is an equivalence relation in F. On the other
hand, given A ∈F and B ∈A (the equivalence class of A in F), we have
B = (B ∩X) ∪(B ∩Y) = [(A ∩X) + r] ∪(A ∩Y).
Therefore, the equivalence class A will have as many sets as its elements as there
are distinct sets of the form (A ∩X) + r, when r ∈Z varies from 0 to p −1.
1For another approach to this example, see Example 20.7.

In order to address this counting problem, let A′ = A ∩X and S′ = 
x∈A′ x.
Since A ̸= X, Y, we have ∅̸= A′ ̸= X, so that 1 ≤|A′| ≤p −1. Hence,

x∈A′+r
x =

x∈A′
x + r|A′| = S′ + r|A′|.
On the other hand, since gcd(|A′|, p) = 1, item (a) of Proposition 11.3 guarantees
that, as r ∈Z varies from 0 to p −1, the numbers S′ + r|A′| thus obtained form
a CRS modulo p. In particular, the sums 
x∈A′+r x are pairwise distinct, so that
the sets A′, A′ + 1, . . . , A′ + (p −1) are themselves pairwise distinct. Therefore,
the class A has exactly p sets, and it follows from Proposition 2.18 that there are
exactly

distinct equivalence classes.
If we now show that in each of the classes above there is exactly one set whose

(Recall that we cannot forget X and Y!)
For what is left to do, ﬁx A ∈F (and, hence, the class A) and let A′′ = A ∩Y.
We wish to count how many are the integers 0 ≤r ≤p −1 such that the sum of the
p elements of the set
B = [(A ∩X) + r] ∪(A ∩Y) = (A′ + r) ∪A′′
is a multiple of p (remember that the set B above is a generic element of the class
A). However, for such a B, it follows from what we did above that

where S = 
x∈A x. Thus, such a sum will be congruent to 0 modulo p if and only
if
|A′|r ≡−S (mod p).
But since gcd(|A′|, p) = 1, we know from Corollary 10.24 (or from item (a) of
Proposition 11.3, with b = 0 and |A′| in place of a) that there exists a single 0 ≤
r ≤p −1 such that the congruence displayed above is satisﬁed.
⊓⊔
Back to the development of the theory, given q, r ∈Z, with 0 ≤r < n, recall
that gcd(nq + r, n) = gcd(r, n). Thus, we can deﬁne the gcd between n and a
congruence class modulo n by letting
gcd(r, n) = gcd(x, n), for x ∈r;
(11.4)
in particular,
gcd(r, n) = gcd(r, n).
Note that, by Proposition 10.23, the congruence classes r for which gcd(r, n) =
1 are precisely those formed by the integers invertible modulo n. Therefore, we have
the following
Deﬁnition 11.6 A reduced residue system (we abbreviate RRS) modulo n is a set
I of integers such that
|I ∩r| =
1, if gcd(r, n) = 1
0, if gcd(r, n) ̸= 1 ,
for every congruence class r, modulo n.
For a ﬁxed integer n > 1, the most important example of RRS modulo n is the
set
{x ∈Z; gcd(x, n) = 1 and 1 ≤x ≤n}.
More generally, if I is a RRS modulo n, then (11.4) easily assures that |I| = ϕ(n),
where ϕ stands for the Euler function. On the other hand, it is clear that every RRS
I modulo n can be enlarged to a CRS modulo n, as well as that every CRS modulo
n contains a RRS modulo n.
The coming result teaches us how to construct new RRS out of known ones.
Proposition 11.7 Let m, n > 1 be given integers.
(a) If an integer a is relatively prime with n and {x1, x2, . . . , xϕ(n)} is a RRS modulo
n, then {ax1, ax2, . . . , axϕ(n)} is also a RRS modulo n.

11.1
Systems of Residues
275
(b) If {x1, x2, . . . , xϕ(m)} and {y1, y2, . . . , yϕ(n)} are RRS modulo m and modulo n,
respectively, then
{nxi + myj; 1 ≤i ≤ϕ(m), 1 ≤j ≤ϕ(n)}
(11.5)
is a RRS modulo mn.
Proof
(a) Since every RRS modulo n is part of a CRS, it follows from item (a) of
Proposition 11.3 that
axi ̸≡axj (mod n), ∀1 ≤i < j ≤ϕ(n).
It now sufﬁces to show that gcd(axi, n) = 1, which follows immediately from
item (c) of Proposition 6.22.
(b) By invoking again the fact that every RRS modulo n is part of a CRS, item (b) of
Proposition 11.3 assures that the set in (11.5) has exactly ϕ(m)ϕ(n) elements,
which are pairwise incongruent modulo mn. However, since ϕ(m)ϕ(n) =
ϕ(mn) (recall that gcd(m, n) = 1), we conclude that such a set has ϕ(mn)
elements. Hence, in order to show that it is indeed a RRS modulo mn, we are
left to showing that
gcd(nxi + myj, mn) = 1
for all 1 ≤i ≤ϕ(m), 1 ≤j ≤ϕ(n). To this end, items (b) and (c) of
Proposition 6.22 give
gcd(nxi + myj, m) = gcd(nxi, m) = gcd(xi, m) = 1
and, analogously, gcd(nxi + myj, n) = 1; therefore, by applying one further
time item (c) of that result, we obtain gcd(nxi + myj, mn) = 1.
⊓⊔
With the concept of RRS and item (a) of the former proposition at our disposal,
we can give another, conceptually clearer, proof of Euler’s theorem.
Theorem 11.8 (Euler)
If a and n are relatively prime integers, with n > 1, then
aϕ(n) ≡1 (mod n).
(11.6)
Proof Let k = ϕ(n) and {x1, x2, . . . , xk} be a RRS modulo n. Item (a) of the
previous proposition assures that {ax1, ax2, . . . , axk} is also a RRS modulo n;
hence, modulo n the integers ax1, ax2, . . . , axk are, in some order, congruent to
x1, x2, . . . , xk. Termwise multiplication of the corresponding congruences gives
akx1x2 . . . xk = ax1 · ax2 . . . · axk ≡x1x2 . . . xk (mod n).

Congruence Classes
Finally, since gcd(x1x2 . . . xk, n) = 1, we can invoke item (f) of Proposition 10.6 to
cancel x1x2 . . . xk out of the congruence above to obtain ak ≡1 (mod n).

11.2
The Quotient Set Zn
Let us now examine the quotient set
Zn = {0, 1, . . . , n −1},
(11.7)
of Z with respect to the relation of congruence modulo n. Proposition 10.6 allows
us to introduce in Zn two operations, to which we shall also refer to as addition and
multiplication and which share properties analogous to those of the usual operations
of addition and multiplication of integers. Actually, we have the following important
result.
Proposition 11.9 In Zn, the operations
a ⊕b = a + b and a ⊙b = a · b,
(11.8)

11.2
The Quotient Set Zn
277
are well deﬁned operations, commutative and associative. Moreover, ⊙is distribu-
tive with respect to ⊕, and 0 and 1 are identities (also called neutral elements) for
⊕and ⊙, respectively, in the sense that
a ⊕0 = a and a ⊙1 = a,
for every a ∈Zn.
Proof Firstly, we have to show that the operations given by (11.8) are indeed
well deﬁned, in the sense that a ⊕b and a ⊙b are independent of the chosen
representatives for the congruence classes a and b.
To this end, if a = c and b = d, then a ≡c (mod n) and b ≡d (mod n), and it
follows from Proposition 10.6 that
a + b ≡c + d (mod n) and a · b ≡c · d (mod n).
However, this is the same as
a + b = c + d and a · b = c · d,
so that
a ⊕b = c ⊕d and a ⊙b = c ⊙d.
What is left to do is simpler. For instance, for the commutativity of ⊕, we get
from the commutativity of the addition of integers that
a ⊕b = a + b = b + a = b ⊕a;
analogously, we prove that ⊙is commutative and that ⊕and ⊙are associative, i.e.,
that
a ⊕(b ⊕c) = (a ⊕b) ⊕c
and
a ⊙(b ⊙c) = (a ⊙b) ⊙c.
The checking of the distributivity of ⊙with respect to ⊕will be left as an exercise
to the reader (cf. Problem 2). Finally,
a ⊕0 = a + 0 = a and a ⊙1 = a · 1 = a,
as we wished to show.

Whenever there is no danger of confusion, we shall write simply + and ·,
instead of ⊕and ⊙, to denote the operations of addition and multiplication in Zn,
respectively. Proceeding this way, we call the reader’s attention to the fact that,
whenever we write
a + b = a + b and a · b = a · b,
each of the + and · signs stand for two different operations. For instance, the ﬁrst
+ sign denotes the addition operation in Zn, whereas the second + sign denotes the
usual addition of integers. Moreover, an analogous remark holds for both · signs.
The associativity of the addition of Zn immediately gives the cancellation law
a + b = a + c ⇒b = c.
Indeed, if a + b = a + c, then
−a + (a + b) = −a + (a + c)

11.2
The Quotient Set Zn
279
and, hence,
(−a + a) + b = (−a + a) + c.
Now, since −a + a = −a + a = 0 and 0 is the neutral element for the addition of
Zn, the equality above gives b = c.
A cancellation law for the multiplication of Zn is somewhat more complicated.
In order to examine it, we ﬁrst have the following
Deﬁnition 11.10 An element a ∈Zn is a unit if there exists b ∈Zn such that
a · b = 1.
As it happens within the ordinary number system of integers, the classes ±1 are
units in Zn, for ±1 · ±1 = 1. On the other hand, the news is that there might be
other units; for instance, in Z9 the classes 4 and 7 are units, since
4 · 7 = 4 · 7 = 1 = 7 · 4.
If a ∈Zn is a unit, then we do have the following cancellation law with respect
to multiplication:
a · c = a · d ⇒c = d.
Indeed, taking b ∈Zn such that a · b = 1 (and, hence, also b · a = 1), it follows
from a · c = a · d that
b · (a · c) = b · (a · d).
Then, the associativity of multiplication furnishes
(b · a) · c = (b · a) · d
or, which is the same, 1 · c = 1 · d. This last equality amounts to c = d, as wished.
In particular, if a ∈Zn is a unit, then the element b ∈Zn whose existence is
guaranteed by Deﬁnition 11.10 is unique, for if
a · b = 1 = a · c,
then the cancellation law for multiplication gives b = c. From now on, we shall say
that such a b ∈Zn is the multiplicative inverse of a in Zn.
The coming proposition characterizes all of the units of Zn.
Proposition 11.11 A congruence class a ∈Zn is a unit in Zn if and only if
gcd(a, n) = 1. In particular, Zn has exactly ϕ(n) distinct units.

280
11
Congruence Classes
Proof By deﬁnition, a ∈Zn is a unit if and only if there exists b ∈Zn such that
a · b = 1, i.e., ab = 1 or, which is the same,
ab ≡1 (mod n).
Hence, a is a unit in Zn if and only if a ∈Z is invertible modulo n. However, by
Proposition 10.23, this is the same as asking that gcd(a, n) = 1.
For what is left to do, it sufﬁces to note that, since Zn = {1, 2, . . . , n}, the set
of the units of Zn coincides with the set of the classes a such that 1 ≤a ≤n and
gcd(a, n) = 1. Since such a set has ϕ(n) elements, we are done.
⊓⊔
We have now arrived at the most important case.
Corollary 11.12 If p is prime, then every element of Zp \ {0} is a unit of Zp.
Proof By the previous proposition, it sufﬁces to show that, if a ̸= 0 in Zp, then
gcd(a, p) = 1. However, a ̸= 0 is the same as a ̸≡0 (mod p), or p ∤a; moreover,
the proof of Lemma 6.41 assures that p ∤a if and only if gcd(a, p) = 1.
⊓⊔
As far as the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division are concerned, the previous corollary allows us to put Zp, with p prime, on
an equal footing with respect to Q and R (and, after Chap. 13, also with respect to
the set C of complex numbers). All of these number systems are examples of what
algebraists call ﬁelds.
More precisely, in Zn (for every n > 1, not only n prime) we can deﬁne an
operation −, called subtraction, which is analogous to the ordinary subtraction of
real numbers. We do so by setting (cf. Problem 3)
a −b = a −b.
We now restrict to the case in which n = p, a prime number. Writing a−1 to denote
the multiplicative inverse of a ∈Zp \ {0} (i.e., letting a−1 denote the congruence
class b ∈Zp whose existence is assured by Deﬁnition 11.10), we have
a · a−1 = 1;
moreover, if a · b = c, with a, b, c ∈Zp and b ̸= 0, then it is immediate to verify
that
a = c · b−1.
Hence, we can introduce in Zp a notion of division which is also similar to the usual
division of rational (or real, or complex) numbers, by letting
a ÷ b = a · b−1,
for a ∈Zp and b ∈Zp \ {0}.

Chapter 12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
In this last chapter devoted to Number Theory, we return to the analysis of the
congruence
ak ≡1 (mod n),
(12.1)
concentrating ourselves in two distinct problems, brieﬂy discussed below.
As a ﬁrst problem, we know from Euler’s theorem that, if gcd(a, n) = 1,
then (12.1) is always satisﬁed for k = ϕ(n), where ϕ stands for the Euler function.
However, for a ﬁxed a ∈Z relatively prime to n, we do not know if such a natural
value of k is the least possible one. In this respect, one of the core results of this
chapter is the characterization of the integers n > 1 for which there exists some
integer a, relatively prime with n and such that the least possible natural exponent k
in (12.1) is k = ϕ(n); such an a will be called a primitive root modulo n.
A second problem we want to address here requires an important change of point
of view towards (12.1). Instead of ﬁxing the basis a, prime with n, and looking for
the values of k ∈N for which that congruence has a solution, we ﬁx k ∈N and look
for the integer value of a which solve it. Note that this amounts to ﬁnding the roots
of the equation xk = 1 in Zn. However, due to the elementary character of these
notes, we restrict ourselves to the case k = 2, when the desired roots a ∈Z will be
the quadratic residues modulo n.
Along our way through the analysis of the two problems above, several inter-
esting applications will be presented. Among them, we would like to highlight yet
another famous theorem of P. de Fermat, characterizing the natural numbers that can
be written as the sum of the squares of two integers.

Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
12.1
The Concept of Order Modulo n
Let a and n be integers such that n > 1 and gcd(a, n) = 1. We know from
Euler’s Theorem 10.19 that there always exists a (at least one) natural number k
for which ak ≡1 (mod n), namely, k = ϕ(n). However, nothing we have done so
far guarantees that ϕ(n) is the least such k; for instance 23 ≡1 (mod 7), even though
ϕ(7) = 6. These considerations motivate the following
Deﬁnition 12.1 Given relatively prime integers a and n, with n > 1, the order of
a, modulo n, denoted ordn(a), is the least possible h ∈N for which
ah ≡1 (mod n).
We obviously have
ordn(a) ≤ϕ(n).
On the other hand, the coming result establishes the most elementary properties of
the concept of order modulo n.
Proposition 12.2 Let a, n ∈Z, with n > 1 and gcd(a, n) = 1.
(a) If ordn(a) = h, then the integers 1, a, a2, . . . , ah−1 are pairwise incongruent,
modulo n. In particular, if ordn(a) = ϕ(n), then the set {1, a, a2, . . . , aϕ(n)−1}
is a RRS modulo n.
(b) ak ≡1 (mod n) ⇔ordn(a) | k. In particular, ordn(a) | ϕ(n).
Proof
(a) If there existed 0 ≤k < l < h such that al ≡ak (mod n), item (f) of
Proposition 10.6 would give us al−k ≡1 (mod n), with 0 < l −k < h. But
this would contradict the minimality of h.
For what is left to do, it sufﬁces to see that, if ordn(a) = ϕ(n), then the set
{1, a, a2, . . . , aϕ(n)−1} has ϕ(n) integers relatively prime with n and pairwise
incongruent modulo n. Thus, such a set is a RRS modulo n.
(b) Let ordn(a) = h, so that, in particular, ah ≡1 (mod n). If k = hl, then
ak = ahl = (ah)l ≡1l = 1 (mod n).
Conversely, let k be a natural number satisfying ak ≡1 (mod n). The division
algorithm assures the existence of integers q and r, with 0 ≤r < h, such that
k = qh + r. Thus, we have
1 ≡ak = aqh+r = (ah)q · ar ≡1q · ar ≡ar (mod n).

12.1
The Concept of Order Modulo n
285
Now, if r > 0, then r would be a natural exponent less than h and such that ar ≡
1 (mod n); in turn, this would contradict the minimality of h. Therefore, r = 0 and
hence h | k, i.e., ordn(a) | k.
Finally, ordn(a) | ϕ(n) follows from the ﬁrst part of item (b), together with
Euler’s Theorem 10.19.
⊓⊔
Example 12.3 Compute the orders of 2 modulo 17 and of 7 modulo 10.
Solution If h = ord17(2), then h | ϕ(17) = 16, so that h = 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. It is
evident that h ̸= 1, 2; also, 24 ≡−1 (mod 17), and hence h ̸= 4. On the other hand,
28 = (24)2 ≡(−1)2 ≡1 (mod 17), so that h = 8.
If h = ord10(7), then h | ϕ(10) = 4, so that h = 1, 2 or 4. Obviously, h ̸= 1;
however, since 72 ≡−1 (mod 10), we also have h ̸= 2. Thus, h = 4.
⊓⊔
Let us now see how Proposition 12.2 can be applied to an interesting problem.
Example 12.4 If p is an odd prime, prove that all prime factors of 2p −1 are of the
form 2kp + 1, for some k ∈N.
Proof If q is a prime factor of 2p −1, then q is odd and 2p ≡1 (mod q). It follows
from item (b) of the previous proposition that ordq(2) | p and, hence, ordq(2) = 1 or
p. However, if ordq(2) = 1, then q = 1, which is an absurd; therefore, ordq(2) = p.
On the other hand, it follows from Fermat’s little theorem that 2q−1 ≡1 (mod q).
Then, again by item (b) of the previous proposition, we have
p = ordq(2) | (q −1).
However, since q is odd, there must exist k ∈N such that q −1 = 2kp.
⊓⊔
The coming result establishes other useful properties of the concept of order
modulo n, which will be of paramount importance for further developments.
Proposition 12.5 Let a and n be relatively prime integers, with n > 1.
(a) ordn(a) = ordn(a + n).
(b) If m > 1 is a natural number such that m | n, then ordm(a) | ordn(a).
(c) If ordn(a) = h and k ∈N, then ordn(ak) =
h
gcd(h,k).
(d) If k ∈N, then ordn(ak) = ordn(a) ⇔gcd(ordn(a), k) = 1.
(e) If ordn(a) = h, then the set {a, a2, . . . , ah} has exactly ϕ(h) elements of order
h modulo n.
Proof
(a) It follows from a ≡a +n (mod n) that ak ≡(a +n)k (mod n), for every k ∈N.
In particular, ak ≡1 (mod n) if and only if (a + n)k ≡1 (mod n), and hence a
and a + n have equal orders modulo n.

286
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
(b) Since m | n, item (g) of Proposition 10.6 yields that if ak ≡1 (mod n), then
ak ≡1 (mod m). In particular, since ak ≡1 (mod n) when k = ordn(a), we
have
aordn(a) ≡1 (mod m).
Item (b) of Proposition 12.2 now furnishes ordm(a) | ordn(a).
(c) Let d = gcd(h, k). By item (b) of Proposition 12.2, we have
(ak)j ≡1 (mod n) ⇔akj ≡1 (mod n) ⇔h | kj
⇔h
d | k
d · j ⇔h
d | j,
where in the last equivalence we have applied item (a) of Proposition 6.22,
together with the fact that gcd
 h
d , k


= 1. From this, we immediately get
ordn(ak) = h
d =
h
gcd(h, k).
(d) This obviously follows from (c).
(e) By item (d), the number of exponents 1 ≤k ≤h such that ak has order h
modulo n equals the number of exponents 1 ≤k ≤h which are relatively
prime with h. Therefore, it is equal to ϕ(h).

Then, we choose vertices of P in the following way: at the ﬁrst round, we choose
vertex 1; on the other hand, if vertex ki was chosen at the i-th round, then at the

12.2

287
(i + 1)-th round we choose the vertex situated |ki| vertices away from vertex ki,
in the clockwise sense if ki > 0 and in the counterclockwise sense if ki < 0.
Such a procedure continues until we choose a vertex which was already chosen
in a former round. At the end of this process, let f (n) be the number of non
chosen vertices.
(a) If f (n) = 0, prove that 2n + 1 is an odd prime.
(b) Compute f (1997).

1 (mod p2).
(b) Letting a = pp−1
p−1 , show that a has at least one prime factor q for which
q ̸≡1 (mod p2), and that ordq(p) = p.
12.2
Primitive Roots
Given integers a and n such that n > 1 and gcd(a, n) = 1, in this section we will
be particularly interested in the case in which ordn(a) = ϕ(n). Such a case is so
important that is worth the following
Deﬁnition 12.6 Let a and n be integers such that n > 1 and gcd(a, n) = 1. We say
that a is a primitive root modulo n if ordn(a) = ϕ(n).
Let us take a look at a couple of examples.
Examples 12.7
(a) Since 21 ≡2 (mod 3) and ϕ(3) = 2, it follows that ord3(2) = 2 = ϕ(3),
i.e., 2 is a primitive root modulo 3. Similar computations show that 2 is also a
primitive root modulo 5.
(b) Modulo 7 we have 21 ≡2, 22 ≡4 and 23 ≡1. Hence, ord7(2) = 3 < 6 = ϕ(7)
and it follows that 2 is not a primitive root modulo 7.
The main result of this section is the characterization of all integer values n > 1
for which primitive roots modulo n do exist. More precisely, we shall show that an
integer n > 1 has a primitive root if and only if n = 2, 4, pk or 2pk, for some
odd prime p. We start this path by computing the number of pairwise incongruent
primitive roots modulo n, provided such a root does exist.
1The coming items are based on the solution of Professor Samuel B. Feitosa.

288
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
Proposition 12.8 If an integer n > 1 has a primitive root, say a, then every
primitive root modulo n is congruent to one of the elements of the set
{ak; 1 ≤k ≤ϕ(n) and gcd(ϕ(n), k) = 1}.
In particular, n has exactly ϕ(ϕ(n)) pairwise incongruent primitive roots.
Proof The second part follows immediately from the ﬁrst, by the very deﬁnition of
Euler’s function: the number of exponents 1 ≤k ≤ϕ(n) such that k is relatively
prime with ϕ(n) is exactly ϕ(ϕ(n)).
For the ﬁrst part, letting a be a primitive root modulo n, we have that ordn(a) =
ϕ(n) and A = {a, a2 . . . , aϕ(n)} is a RRS modulo n. Hence, any primitive root
modulo n is congruent, modulo n, to one of the elements of A, so that it sufﬁces to
see which elements of A have order (modulo n) equal to ϕ(n). However, by item (d)
of Proposition 12.5, for 1 ≤k ≤ϕ(n) we have
ordn(ak) = ϕ(n) ⇔gcd(ϕ(n), k) = 1.
⊓⊔
Example 12.9 Example 12.7 assures that 2 is a primitive root modulo 5. Since
ϕ(5) = 4, the previous propositions teaches us that a set of pairwise incongruent
primitive roots modulo 5 is
{2k; 1 ≤k ≤4 and gcd(4, k) = 1} = {2, 23}.
Hence, the pairwise incongruent primitive roots modulo 5 are 2 and 3 (for 23 = 8 ≡
3 (mod 5)).
We now go towards characterizing the integers which do possess primitive roots,
starting with a necessary condition.
Theorem 12.10 If and integer n > 1 has primitive roots, then n = 2, 4, pk or 2pk,
where p is an odd prime and k is a natural number.
Proof Firstly, note that the integers n > 1 which differ from those at the statement
of the theorem are either of the form n = bc, with b, c > 2 being relatively prime
integers, or of the form n = 2k, for some integer k > 2. It thus sufﬁces to show
that such integer values of n do not have primitive roots, and we shall do this by
showing that every integer a relatively prime with n satisﬁes ordn(a) < ϕ(n). We
look separately at the two possibilities above:
(i) n = bc, with b, c > 2 relatively prime integers: since gcd(b, c) = 1, we have
ϕ(n) = ϕ(bc) = ϕ(b)ϕ(c). On the other hand, condition b, c > 2 assures (cf.

12.2
Primitive Roots
289
Problem 19, page 220) that ϕ(b) and ϕ(c) are both even. If a ∈Z is prime with
n, then a is prime with b and c and, from Euler’s theorem, we get
aϕ(n)/2 =

aϕ(b)ϕ(c)/2
≡1ϕ(c)/2 ≡1 (mod b)
and
aϕ(n)/2 =

aϕ(c)ϕ(b)/2
≡1ϕ(b)/2 ≡1 (mod c).
Therefore, item (h) of Proposition 10.6 gives aϕ(n)/2 ≡1 (mod n); in particular,
ordn(a) ≤ϕ(n)
2
< ϕ(n)
and, hence, a is not a primitive root modulo n.
(ii) n = 2k, for some integer k > 2: let a be an odd integer (i.e., prime with 2). If
we show that
a2k−2 ≡1 (mod 2k),
we will have
ord2k(a) ≤2k−2 < 2k−1 = ϕ(2k)
and a will not be a primitive root modulo 2k. For what is left to do, let us
make induction on k: the initial case k = 3 follows from Proposition 10.9,
since a2 ≡1 (mod 8) for odd a. Assume we had already proved that, for some
integer k ≥3, there exists q ∈N such that a2k−2 = 2kq + 1. Then,
a2k−1 =

a2k−22
= (2kq + 1)2 = 22kq2 + 2k+1q + 1
= 2k+1(2k−1q2 + q) + 1 ≡1 (mod 2k+1),
as wished.
⊓⊔
We are left to establishing the converse of the previous theorem, namely, that all
numbers of one of the forms 2, 4, pk and 2pk, for some odd prime p and some
k ∈N, have primitive roots. It is clear that 1 is a primitive root modulo 2 and 3 is
a primitive root modulo 4. The rest of this section is devoted to the analysis of the
two remaining cases.

Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
The coming result shows that it sufﬁces to worry about the numbers of the
form pk.
Proposition 12.11 If p is an odd prime and a ∈Z is a primitive root modulo pk,
then a or a + pk is a primitive root modulo 2pk.
Proof Let h = ord2pk(a). If a is odd, then a is relatively prime with 2pk. Then, by
using item (b) of Proposition 12.5, together with the fact that ordpk(a) = ϕ(pk), we
obtain
ϕ(pk) = ordpk(a) | h = ord2pk(a) | ϕ(2pk) = ϕ(pk),
where, in the last equality above, we used the fact that p is odd. Therefore,
ord2pk(a) = ϕ(2pk) and a is a primitive root modulo 2pk.
If a is even, change a by a + pk from the beginning and argue as above.
⊓⊔
We shall complete the proof of the converse of Theorem 12.10 (i.e., the analysis
of the case pk), in two steps. Nevertheless, before that we need an auxiliary result.
Lemma 12.12 Let p be an odd prime. If a is a primitive root modulo p2, then, for
every integer k ≥1, we have aϕ(pk) = bkpk + 1, for some bk ∈Z such that p ∤bk.
Proof Let us make induction on k ≥1. Fermat’s little theorem gives ap−1 = b1p +
1, for some b1 ∈Z. If p | b1, we would have ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2) and, hence,
ordp2(a) ≤p −1 < ϕ(p2); this would contradict the fact that a is a primitive root
modulo p2.
Assume that, for some integer k ≥1, we have aϕ(pk) = bkpk + 1, with bk ∈Z
such that p ∤bk. Then, Newton’s binomial formula gives
aϕ(pk+1) =

Now, for 1 ≤j ≤p −1 Example 6.42 assures the existence of ck ∈N such that

12.2
Primitive Roots
291
Letting t denote the expression within parentheses and noticing that t ∈Z, we
ﬁnally get
aϕ(pk+1) = 1 + bkpk+1 + tpk+2 = 1 + (bk + tp)pk+1.
However, since p ∤bk, it sufﬁces to let bk+1 = bk + tp to obtain aϕ(pk+1) =
bk+1pk+1 + 1, with p ∤bk+1.
⊓⊔
We can ﬁnally execute the ﬁrst of the two steps needed to ﬁnish the proof of the
existence of primitive roots modulo pk, for an odd prime p.
Theorem 12.13 Let p be an odd prime and a be relatively prime with p.
(a) If a is a primitive root modulo p, then a or a + p is a primitive root modulo p2.
(b) If a is a primitive root modulo p and modulo p2, then a is a primitive root
modulo pk, for every integer k ≥1.
Proof
(a) It follows from item (a) of Proposition 12.5 and from our hypotheses that
ordp(a+p) = ordp(a) = p−1. On the other hand, item (b) of Proposition 12.2
assures that
ordp2(a + p), ordp2(a) | ϕ(p2) = p(p −1),
whereas item (b) of Proposition 12.5 gives
p −1 = ordp(a) | ordp2(a) and p −1 = ordp(a + p) | ordp2(a + p).
Hence, ordp2(a) = p−1 or p(p−1), the same being valid for ordp2(a+p);
thus, we are left to showing that
ordp2(a) = p −1 ⇒ordp2(a + p) ̸= p −1.
To this end, if ap−1 ≡1 (mod p2), then modulo p2 we have
(a + p)p−1 = ap−1 + (p −1)pap−2 +
p−1

(b) Suppose that a is a primitive root modulo p and modulo p2. We shall use
induction on k to prove that a is a primitive root modulo pk, for every k ∈N.

292
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
The cases k = 1 and k = 2 are our hypotheses. Assume, then, that we have
already proved that a is a primitive root modulo pk, for some integer k ≥2.
Items (b) of Propositions 12.2 and 12.5 give us
ϕ(pk) = ordpk(a) | ordpk+1(a) | ϕ(pk+1) = pϕ(pk),
so that
ordpk+1(a) = ϕ(pk) or ϕ(pk+1).
On the other hand, since a is a primitive root modulo p2, the previous lemma
furnishes aϕ(pk) = bkpk + 1, for some bk ∈Z such that p ∤bk. In particular,
aϕ(pk) ̸≡1 (mod pk+1),
so that ordpk+1(a) ̸= ϕ(pk).
⊓⊔
Theorem 12.13 puts us in quite a nice position. Indeed, if we show that an odd
prime p has a primitive root, say a, then a + p will also be such a root (by item (a)
of Proposition 12.5); hence, item (a) of the previous theorem allows us to assume
that a is a primitive root modulo p and modulo p2, and after that item (b) of that
same result assures that a is a primitive root modulo pk, for every k ∈N.
We are then left to showing that odd primes have primitive roots. Unfortunately,
at this point such a proof is beyond the scope of the material we have at our disposal,
and will have to wait until Sect. 19.3 (cf. Theorem 19.20) to be presented. Thus, for
the time being we assume the existence of primitive roots modulo p, taking the
opportunity to present some instructive examples.
Example 12.14 Prove that 2 is a primitive root modulo 3k and modulo 5k, for every
k ∈N.
Proof From Example 12.7 and the previous theorem, it sufﬁces to show that 2 is
a primitive root modulo 9 and modulo 25. Let us check that 2 is a primitive root
modulo 9, the case of modulo 25 being entirely analogous: since ϕ(9) = 6, we
have ord9(2) | 6; however, since none of 21, 22 or 23 is a multiple of 9, we get
ord9(2) = 6 = ϕ(9).
⊓⊔
The next two examples show how powerful the information on the existence of
primitive roots can be.
Example 12.15 If p is prime and n ∈N, prove that
1n + 2n + · · · + (p −1)n ≡

0 (mod p), if (p −1) ∤n
−1 (mod p), if (p −1) | n .

12.2
Primitive Roots
293
Proof If (p −1) | n, say n = (p −1)k, then Fermat’s little theorem gives, for
1 ≤a ≤p −1,
an = a(p−1)k ≡1k = 1 (mod p).
Therefore,
1n + 2n + · · · + (p −1)n ≡1 + 1 + · · · + 1



p−1
≡−1 (mod p).
If (p −1) ∤n, let a be a primitive root modulo p. Since {a, a2, . . . , ap−1} is a
RRS modulo p, we conclude that the numbers a, a2, . . . , ap−1 are, modulo p and
in some order, congruent to 1, 2, . . . , p −1. Hence (also modulo p),
1n + 2n + · · · + (p −1)n ≡an + a2n + · · · + a(p−1)n = apn −an
an −1 .
Now, by invoking Fermat’s little theorem once more, we get
apn −an = (ap)n −an ≡an −an ≡0 (mod p).
On the other hand, since ordp(a) = p −1 and (p −1) ∤n, item (b) of
Proposition 12.2 guarantees that p ∤(an −1). Therefore, p | apn−an
an−1 , as we wished
to show.
⊓⊔
Example 12.16 (IMO) Find all n ∈N for which n2 divides 2n + 1.
Solution It is clear that such an n must be odd and that n = 1 is a possible value.
Then, let n > 1 be a natural number satisfying the given conditions and write n =
pkq, where p is the least prime divisor of n and k ∈N is the exponent of p in the
canonical decomposition of n in prime powers. Then, gcd(p, q) = 1 and
2n + 1
n2
∈N ⇒2n + 1
p2k
∈N.
By Fermat’s little theorem, we have 2p ≡2 (mod p), from where an easy
induction gives 2pk ≡2 (mod p). Thus, modulo p we obtain
0 ≡2n + 1 = 2pkq + 1 ≡2q + 1,
so that 22q ≡1 (mod p). Letting t = ordp(2), it follows that t | 2q and (again
by Fermat’s little theorem) t | (p −1); therefore, t | gcd(2q, p −1). However,

294
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
since the prime divisors of q are greater than p, this forces us to have t = 2 and,
consequently, p = 3. Hence,
2n + 1
n2
= 23kq + 1
32kq2
∈N,
(12.2)
which successively implies 23kq ≡−1 (mod 32k) and
22·3kq ≡1 (mod 32k).
Since we have already shown (cf. Example 12.14) that 2 is a primitive root
modulo 32k, the above congruence gives
2 · 32k−1 = ϕ(32k) = ord32k(2) | 2 · 3kq,
so that 3k−1 | q. However, since p = 3 and gcd(3, q) = 1, we must have k = 1.
Therefore, n = 3q and we conclude from (12.2) that
8q + 1
q2
∈N.
By the sake of contradiction, assume that q > 1 and let w be the least prime
divisor of q, say q = wlv, where v ∈N and l is the exponent of w in the canonical
decomposition of q as a product of prime powers. Once more from Fermat’s little
theorem, we have 8wl ≡8 (mod w) and, hence,
0 ≡8q + 1 = 8wlv + 1 ≡8v + 1 (mod w),
(12.3)
so that 82v ≡1 (mod w). Letting t = ordw(8), it follows that t | 2v and (one more
time from Fermat) t | (w −1). However, since the prime factors of v (if they exist)
are all greater than w, we conclude that t = 1 or 2, and this gives w | (81 −1)
or w | (82 −1). In any case, it follows from w > p = 3 that w = 7, and (12.3)
furnishes
0 ≡8v + 1 ≡1v + 1 ≡2 (mod 7),
which is an absurd. We ﬁnally conclude that q = 1 and n = 3kq = 3.

12.3
Quadratic Residues
In this section, we study algebraic congruences of the form
x2 ≡a (mod n).
To this end, we shall need the following
Deﬁnition 12.17 Let a, n ∈Z, with n > 1 and gcd(a, n) = 1. We say that a is a
quadratic residue modulo n if the congruence
x2 ≡a (mod n)
has at least one integer solution x. Otherwise, a is said to be a quadratic nonresidue
modulo n.

298
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
With respect to the above deﬁnition, our main task in this section will be to
obtain necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for an integer a to be a quadratic residue
modulo n. In the text we shall concentrate ourselves in the case of a prime n, leaving
the general case for the problems posed at the end of the section.
Proposition 12.18 Let p be an odd prime.
(a) If a is a quadratic residue modulo p, then the congruent x2 ≡a (mod p) has
exactly two incongruent solutions modulo p.
(b) Among the integers 1, 2, . . . , p −1 there are exactly p−1
2
quadratic residues
and p−1
2
quadratic nonresidues modulo p.
Proof
(a) If x1, x2 ∈Z are such that x2
1 ≡a (mod p) and x2
2 ≡a (mod p), then
x2
1 ≡x2
2 (mod p), so that p | (x2
1 −x2
2). However, since p is prime, we conclude
that p | (x1 −x2) or p | (x1 + x2). Hence, the congruence stated in item (a)
has at most two incongruent solutions modulo p, namely, x1 and −x1 (they are
incongruent since p is odd and gcd(a, p) = 1 ⇒gcd(x1, p) = 1. On the other
hand, letting a be a quadratic residue modulo p, we know that there exists a
solution x0 ∈Z for the congruence x2 ≡a (mod p). It immediately follows
that −x0 is also a solution of such a congruence, with −x0 ̸≡x0 (mod p).
(b) Since {1, 2, . . . , p −1} is a RRS modulo p, in order to count how many of its
elements are quadratic residues modulo p, it sufﬁces to compute how many of
the numbers 12, 22, . . . , (p −1)2 are pairwise incongruent modulo p. To this
end, note that if 1 ≤i ≤p−1
2 , then
i2 ≡(p −i)2 (mod p);
on the other hand, if 1 ≤i < j ≤p−1
2 , then
i2 ̸≡j2 (mod p),
since j2 −i2 = (j −i)(j + i) and 0 < j −i < j + i < p.
Therefore, there are exactly p−1
2
quadratic residues modulo p and, hence,
exactly (p −1) −

p−1
2

= p−1
2
quadratic nonresidues modulo p.
⊓⊔
The coming proposition is due to Euler, being known in mathematical literature
as Euler’s criterion for quadratic residues.
Proposition 12.19 (Euler)
If p is an odd prime and a ∈Z, then a is a quadratic
residue modulo p if and only if
a
p−1
2
≡1 (mod p).

12.3
Quadratic Residues
299
Proof Assume ﬁrst that a is a quadratic residue modulo p. Then, gcd(a, p) = 1 and
there exists x0 ∈Z such that x2
0 ≡a (mod p). In particular, x0 is also prime with p,
and Fermat’s little theorem furnishes
a
p−1
2
≡(x2
0)
p−1
2
= xp−1
0
≡1 (mod p).
Conversely, suppose a
p−1
2
≡1 (mod p), so that in particular gcd(a, p) = 1.
Then, letting α be a primitive root modulo p, we have that {α, α2, . . . , αp−1} is
a RRS modulo p. Therefore, there exists an integer 1 ≤k ≤p −1 for which
αk ≡a (mod p). Hence,
α
k
 p−1
2

≡a
p−1
2
≡1 (mod p),
and it follows from ordp(α) = p −1 that (p −1) | k

p−1
2

. We conclude that k is
even, say k = 2l, and letting x0 = αl we get
x2
0 = α2l = αk ≡a (mod p).
Thus, a is a quadratic residue modulo p.
⊓⊔
Corollary 12.20 If p is an odd prime, then an integer a, relatively prime with p, is
a quadratic nonresidue modulo p if and only if
a
p−1
2
≡−1 (mod p).
Proof Fermat’s little theorem gives
(a
p−1
2
−1)(a
p−1
2
+ 1) = ap−1 −1 ≡0 (mod p).
However, since p is prime, we get
a
p−1
2
−1 ≡0 (mod p) or a
p−1
2
+ 1 ≡0 (mod p).
On the other hand, it follows from Euler’s criterion that a is a quadratic
nonresidue modulo p if and only if the ﬁrst of the two congruences above does
not hold, i.e., if and only if a
p−1
2
+ 1 ≡0 (mod p).
⊓⊔
Remark 12.21 It is possible to prove (cf. Problem 7, page 493) that if a ∈Z is not
a perfect square, then there exist inﬁnitely many primes p such that a is a quadratic
nonresidue modulo p.
In order to ease computations with quadratic residues and nonresidues, we shall
need the following notation, introduced by A-M. Legendre.

The two coming examples bring interesting applications of quadratic residues. In
both of them, we shall use the fact that if an integer n satisﬁes n ≡3 (mod 4), then

12.3
Quadratic Residues
301
n has a prime divisor p such that p ≡3 (mod 4). An argument for the validity of
this (easy) fact can be found along the proof of Example 6.40.
Example 12.24 Prove that there does not exist integers x and y for which y2 =
x3 + 7.
Solution By the sake of contradiction, assume that such a pair of integers does
exist. Then x is odd, for otherwise we would have y2 = x3 + 7 ≡3(mod 4), which
in turn contradicts item (c) of Proposition 10.9. Now,
y2 + 1 = x3 + 8 = (x + 2)[(x −1)2 + 3]
(12.4)
and, since (x −1)2 + 3 ≡3(mod 4) (recall that x −1 is even), there exists a prime
p such that p ≡3 (mod 4) and p | [(x −1)2 + 3].
Back to (12.4), we conclude that y2 + 1 ≡0 (mod p), and −1 is a quadratic
residue modulo p. It then follows from the deﬁnition of Legendre’s symbol, together
with item (c) of the previous proposition, that
1 =
−1
p

≡(−1)
p−1
2
= (−1)2k+1 = −1 (mod p).
This contradicts the fact that p is odd.
⊓⊔
For the next example, we extend the original Fibonacci and Lucas sequences (cf.
Problem 2, page 71) to homonymous sequences (Fn)n∈Z and (Ln)n∈Z, by imposing
that the extended sequences satisfy the same recurrence relations as the original
ones, namely, F1 = F2 = 1 and Fj+2 = Fj+1 + Fj for every j ∈Z, and L1 = 1,
L2 = 3 and Lj+2 = Lj+1 + Lj, for every integer j ∈Z (so that, for instance,
F0 = 0, F−1 = 1, etc, and L0 = 2, L−1 = −1, etc.). This way, it is a trivial task to
prove that F−n = (−1)n−1Fn and L−n = (−1)nLn for every n ∈N, as well as that
the extended sequences continue to satisfy all of the properties listed in Problem 2,
page 71, and in Problems 11–13, page 252 (of course, with indices m, n and k now
ranging in Z, instead of in N).
Example 12.25 Let (Ln)n∈Z be the extended Lucas sequence. Prove3 that Ln is a
perfect square if and only if n = 1 or 3.
Proof We consider three separate cases:
(i) n = 2m, with m ∈Z: item (b) of Problem 2, page 71 (with m in place of n),
gives
Ln = L2m = L2
m + 2(−1)m−1.
3The result of this example and those of Problems 6 and 7, as well as their proofs, are due Cohn
[10].

302
12
Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
Therefore, Ln differs from a perfect square by −2 or 2, so that it cannot be a
perfect square itself.
(ii) n ≡1 (mod 4): if n = 1, then Ln = L1 = 12. Otherwise, write n = 1+2·3l ·k,
with l ∈Z+ and k ∈Z such that 2 | k but 3 ∤k. Item (d) of Problem 11,
page 252 (with k in place of n) guarantees that Lk ≡3 (mod 4). Therefore, we
can choose a prime p ≡3 (mod 4) such that p | Lk. On the other hand, by
applying item (d) of Problem 13, page 253, with t = 3l, we get
Ln ≡−L1 = −1 (mod Lk),
so that Ln ≡−1 (mod p). Finally, using the fact (already established before)
that −1 is not a quadratic residue modulo p, we conclude that Ln cannot be a
perfect square.
(iii) n ≡3 (mod 4): if n = 3, then L3 = 22, a perfect square. If n ≡3 (mod 4) and
n ̸= 3, write n = 3 + 2 · 3l · k, with l ∈Z+ and k ∈Z such that 2 | k but 3 ∤k.
Arguing exactly as above, we get
Ln ≡−L3 = −4 (mod p),
for some prime divisor p of Lk such that p
≡
3 (mod 4). This time,
Proposition 12.23, together with the fact that −1 is not a quadratic residue
modulo p, give
−4
p

=

and −4 is not a quadratic residue modulo p either. Hence, also as above, Ln is
not a perfect square.
⊓⊔
Back to the development of the theory, the next result, due to K. F. Gauss4 and
known as Gauss’ lemma, furnishes a much simpler procedure than that provided
by Euler’s criterion to decide whether a certain integer is a quadratic residue or
nonresidue modulo p, with p being a given odd prime.

centuries. Gauss is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of all times. In the
several different areas of Mathematics and Physics in which he worked, like Algebra, Analysis,
Differential Geometry, Electromagnetism and Number Theory, there are always very important
and deep results or methods that bear his name. We refer the reader to [38] for an interesting
biography of Gauss.

Proof For 1 ≤j ≤p−1
2 , let −p−1
2
≤tj ≤p−1
2
be the only integer such that
ja ≡tj (mod p).
Let us ﬁrst prove that
1 ≤i < j ≤p −1
2
⇒|ti| ̸= |tj|.
To this end, it sufﬁces to see that, since gcd(a, p) = 1, we have
|ti| = |tj| ⇒|ia| ≡|ja| (mod p) ⇒|i| ≡|j| (mod p)
⇒i ± j ≡0 (mod p),
which is impossible.
It now follows from what we did above that the numbers |t1|, . . . , |t p−1
2 | form,
in some order, a permutation of 1, 2, . . . , p−1
2
(note that none of them equals 0, for
gcd(a, p) = 1). Therefore, recalling that m denotes the quantity of indices j for
which tj < 0, we get modulo p that

Hence,

and the rest follows from item (c) of Proposition 12.23.

As an application of Gauss’ lemma, we next show that 2 is a quadratic residue
modulo p (an odd prime) if and only if p ≡0, 1, 2 or 7 (mod 8).

p = 4k + 3.
As for the second equality, it is enough to show that
(p + 1

≡p2 −1

(mod 2).
In turn, to this end it sufﬁces to look at the cases p = 8k+1, p = 8k+3, p = 8k+5
and p = 8k + 7.

Continuing our study of quadratic residues, we are going to prove one of the
most famous theorems of Gauss, which establishes a simple relationship between
the Legendre symbols

and

us start by rewriting Gauss’ lemma in a suitable way.

Proof For 1 ≤j ≤p−1
2 , let 0 < rj < p be the remainder upon division of ja by
p, so that (cf. Proposition 6.7)
ja =

)
p + rj.
(12.6)
It is immediate that
ja ≡−1, −2, . . . , −
p −1
2

(mod p) ⇔p + 1
2
≤rj < p.
Hence, in the notations of Gauss’ lemma, there are exactly m indices 1 ≤j ≤p−1
2
for which p+1

≤rj < p, and it sufﬁces to show that the parity of the number of
such indices equals that of  p−1

Write s1, s2, . . . , sm (after some reordering, if needed) to denote the remainders
rj such that p+1
2
≤rj < p, and t1, . . . , tn (also after some reordering, if needed)
the remainders rj for which 1 ≤rj ≤p−1
2 . Then m+n = p−1
2 , and (as in the proof
of Gauss’ lemma) for 1 ≤i < j ≤p−1
2
we have ri ̸= rj, p −rj. Therefore,

1, 2, . . . , p −1

The coming result is known in mathematical literature as the Quadratic Reci-

for which we use the following double counting argument: since the right hand side
of the desired equality counts the number of points of integer coordinates within the
closed rectangle
R =

(x, y) ∈R2; 1 ≤x ≤p −1
2
and 1 ≤y ≤q −1

,
it is enough to count the number of those points in some other way, thus obtaining
the left hand side of (12.7).
For what is left to do assume, without any loss of generality, that p > q, and
consider the straight line y = q

We ﬁnish this section by applying the quadratic reciprocity law to the establish
the existence of certain prime numbers.5

Proof By the sake of contradiction, suppose that there were only a ﬁnite number
of primes of the form 3k + 1, say p1, p2, . . . , pn, and let x = (2p1 . . . pn)2 + 3.
If p is a prime divisor of x, then we clearly have p ̸= 2, 3, p1, . . . , pn, so that
p ≡−1 (mod 3). Moreover, since
(2p1 . . . pn)2 ≡−3 (mod p),
we conclude that −3 is a quadratic residue modulo p. We must then have

12.4
Sums of Two Squares
As an application of the ideas developed so far, in this section we characterize the
natural numbers which can be written as the sum of two perfect squares. We start
by looking at the case of prime numbers, with the following result of P. de Fermat.
Theorem 12.31 (Fermat)
The following conditions on an odd prime p are
equivalent:
(a) p ≡1 (mod 4).
(b) −1 is a quadratic residue modulo p.
(c) p can be written as the sum of two perfect squares.
Proof
(a) ⇒(b): letting p = 4k + 1, it follows from item (c) of Proposition 12.23 that
−1
p

≡(−1)
p−1
2
≡(−1)2k ≡1 (mod p)
and thus −1 is a quadratic residue modulo p.
(b) ⇒(c): let h ∈Z be such that h2 + 1 ≡0 (mod p), and
A = {(x, y); x, y ∈Z, 0 ≤x, y < √p}.
By the fundamental principle of counting (cf. Sect. 1.1), we have |A|
=

⌊√p⌋+ 1
2. Now, since

⌊√p⌋+ 1
2 > √p2 = p
and there are only p possible distinct remainders upon division by p, the
pigeonhole principle (cf. Sect. 4.1) implies the existence of distinct ordered pairs
(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ∈A for which
hx1 + y1 ≡hx2 + y2 (mod p).
Letting a = |x1 −x2| and b = |y1 −y2|, we have that both a and b are nonzero and,
hence,
0 < a2 + b2 = |x1 −x2|2 + |y1 −y2|2 < √p2 + √p2 = 2p.

However, since
a2 + b2 = |x1 −x2|2 + |y1 −y2|2
≡(x1 −x2)2 + (hx1 −hx2)2 (mod p)
= (h2 + 1)(x1 −x2)2 ≡0 (mod p),
the only possibility is that a2 + b2 = p.
(c) ⇒(a): let p = a2 + b2, with a, b ∈Z. Since p is odd, we have a even and b
odd, or conversely. Assume, without loss of generality, that a is even and b is odd.
Then, Proposition 10.9 gives
p = a2 + b2 ≡0 + 1 ≡1 (mod 4).
⊓⊔
Before we can proceed, we need an elementary auxiliary result, usually attributed
to Euler and known as Euler’s identity.
Lemma 12.32 Let m and n be natural numbers, both of which can be written as a
sum of two perfect squares. Then, mn can also be written as a sum of two perfect
squares.
Proof Writing m = a2 + b2 and n = c2 + d2, we have
mn = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
= ((ac)2 + (bd)2) + ((ad)2 + (bc)2)
= (ac + bd)2 + (ad −bc)2.
(12.8)
⊓⊔
The coming result also credited to Fermat, provides a necessary and sufﬁcient
condition for a natural number to be written as a sum of two perfect squares.
Theorem 12.33 (Fermat)
A natural number n > 1 can be written as a sum of two
perfect squares if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed: for each prime p
such that p ≡3 (mod 4), the greatest power of p that divides n has even exponent.
Proof In what follows, write
n = 2apa1
1 . . . pak
k qb1
1 . . . qbl
l
with a, ai, bj ∈Z+ and pi, qj prime numbers such that pi ≡1 (mod 4) and qj ≡
3 (mod 4), for all 1 ≤i ≤k and 1 ≤j ≤l.
(i) If each bj is even, then n can be written as a sum of two perfect squares: to prove
this, ﬁrst note that, by Theorem 12.31, each pi can be written as such; on the

other hand, we have 2a = (2a/2)2+02 if a is even 2a = (2(a−1)/2)2+(2(a−1)/2)2
if a is odd; also, writing bj = 2cj, with cj ∈Z for 1 ≤j ≤l, we have
q
bj
j
= (q
cj
j )2 + 02. Therefore, repeated applications of Lemma 12.32 allow us
to conclude that n can be written as a sum of two squares.
(ii) If n can be written as a sum of two perfect squares, then each bj is even: it
sufﬁces to prove that if n can be written as a sum of two squares and bj ≥1,
then bj ≥2 and n
q2
j can also be written as a sum of two squares. To this end, if
n = c2 +d2, with c, d ∈Z, then c2 +d2 ≡0 (mod qj). If d ≡0 (mod qj), then
c ≡0 (mod qj) and hence n = c2 + d2 ≡0 (mod q2
j ); therefore, bj ≥2 and
n

By the sake of contradiction, assume that d ̸≡0 (mod qj). Then gcd(d, qj) = 1,
so that d is invertible modulo qj. Letting f denote its inverse modulo qj, we
obtain
(cf )2 + 1 ≡0 (mod qj).
This contradicts Theorem 12.31, for qj ≡3 (mod 4).
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by showing that there is essentially only one way of writing
a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 as a sum of two perfect squares.
Proposition 12.34 If p is a prime number of the form 4k+1, then there exist unique
x, y ∈N such that x < y and x2 + y2 = p.
Proof We already know that there exists at least one pair of natural numbers x and
y such that x2 + y2 = p. Assume that a, b is another such pair and note that a, b, x
and y are all relatively prime with p and less than √p. We may then choose integers
1 ≤c, z < p such that xz ≡y and ac ≡b (mod p).
We ﬁrst claim that either c = z or c + z = p. Indeed, we have
0 ≡x2 + y2 ≡x2 + (xz)2 = x2(z2 + 1) (mod p),
so that z2 ≡−1 (mod p). Analogously, c2 ≡−1 (mod p), and hence p divides
z2 −c2 = (z −c)(z + c), which in turn is the same as saying that p divides either
z−c or z+c. However, since 1 ≤c, z < p, it follows that −p < z−c < z+c < 2p,
and this (together with the fact that p | (z −c) or p | (z + c)) gives z −c = 0 or
z + c = p.
Now, assume that c = z. Then, the choices of c and z guarantee that
bxz ≡acy ≡ayz (mod p),
(12.9)

314

Primitive Roots and Quadratic Residues
and cancelling z we obtain bx ≡ay (mod p). However, since 0 < a, b, x, y < √p,
we have 0 < bx, ay < p, and then bx = ay. Therefore,
p = x2 + y2 =
ay
b
2
+ y2 =
y
b
2
(a2 + b2) =
y

2
p,
which gives y = b and x = a.
If z + c = p, then, arguing as in (12.9), we arrive at bx ≡−ay (mod p) and,
hence, at bx + ay = p. Thus, (12.8) furnishes
p2 = (a2 + b2)(x2 + y2) = (bx + ay)2 + (by −ax)2 = p2 + (by −ax)2,
from which by = ax. We now obviously get x = b and y = a.
⊓⊔
Problems: Sect. 12.4
1. The purpose of this problem is to show that there are inﬁnitely many natural
numbers that cannot be written as a sum of three squares. More precisely, prove
the following result of Euler: there does not exist integers k, l, x, y, z such that
l ≥0 and
x2 + y2 + z2 = 4l(8k + 7).
2. If a, b, c ∈N are such that a(a −1) = b2 + c2, show that a + b is odd.
3. (BMO) Find all pairs of distinct natural numbers x and y such that x2+y2

integer which divides 1995.
4. Given a natural n, prove that there exist n consecutive naturals such that none of
them can be written as the sum of two perfect squares.
5. The purpose of this problem is to prove a theorem, due to Lagrange, which asserts
that every natural number can be written as a sum of four perfect squares. To
this end, we ﬁrst observe that the following generalization of Euler’s identity
holds: if two given naturals m and n can be written as sums of four squares,
then mn can also be written this way. Indeed, if m = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 and
n = w2 + x2 + y2 + z2, then a simple (though surely tedious) veriﬁcation shows
that6
mn = (aw −bx −cy −dz)2 + (ax + bw + cz −dy)2
+ (ay −bz + cw + dx)2 + (az + by −cx + dw)2.

Chapter 13
Complex Numbers
It is an obvious fact that the set of reals is too small to provide a complete description
of the set of roots of polynomial functions; for instance, the function x →x2 + 1,
with x ∈R, does not have any real root. Historically, the search for such roots
strongly motivated the birth of complex numbers and the ﬂowering of complex
function theory. In this respect, a major ﬁrst crowning was the proof, by Gauss, of
the famous Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which asserts that every polynomial
function with complex coefﬁcients has a complex root.
In this chapter, we concentrate ourselves in the construction and discussion of
the elementary properties of the set of complex numbers, postponing to Sect. 15.1
the presentation of one simple proof of the aforementioned theorem of Gauss.
13.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
As was seen in Chapter 1 of [8], one generally looks at the set R of real numbers as
the number line: one starts with a straight line (geometric entity), choosing a point
in it to correspond to 0; then, one chooses a standard length to correspond to the unit
of measure, and two distinct rules to operate with two points along the line (such
operations being called addition and multiplication of real numbers), so that one
gets a third point as the result of operating (i.e., adding or multiplying) two given
points. We then call the points along the line as real numbers, assume that they fulﬁll
the whole line and check that the operations of addition and multiplication satisfy
the usual properties of commutativity, associativity etc.

Complex Numbers
The discussion at the former paragraph hints to the following natural question:
would there be some way of deﬁning two operations with the points of an Euclidean
plane in a way similar to the ordinary addition and multiplication of real numbers?
The answer to this question is yes and the resulting set, which we are about to
describe, is that of complex numbers.
Look at the cartesian plane as the set R × R of ordered pairs (a, b) of reals. Let
⊕and ⊙be the operations with the points of such a plane deﬁned by
(a, b)⊕(c, d) = (a+c, b+d) and (a, b)⊙(c, d) = (ac−bd, ad+bc),
(13.1)
where + and · respectively denote the ordinary addition and multiplication of real
numbers.
One can straightforwardly verify that ⊕and ⊙are associative and commu-
tative operations, and that ⊙is distributive with respect to ⊕, i.e., that for all
a, b, c, d, e, f ∈R, the following properties hold:
i. Associativity of ⊕and ⊗: (a, b)⊕((c, d)⊕(e, f )) = ((a, b)⊕(c, d))⊕(e, f )
and (a, b) ⊙((c, d) ⊙(e, f )) = ((a, b) ⊙(c, d)) ⊙(e, f ).
ii. Commutativity of ⊕and ⊗: (a, b) ⊕(c, d) = (c, d) ⊕(a, b) and (a, b) ⊙
(c, d) = (c, d) ⊙(a, b).
iii. Distributivity of ⊗with respect to ⊕: (a, b) ⊙((c, d) ⊕(e, f )) = ((a, b) ⊙
(c, d)) ⊕((a, b) ⊙(e, f ))
It is also pretty clear (check it!) that (0, 0) and (1, 0) are identities for ⊕and ⊙,
respectivamente, i.e., that
(a, b) ⊕(0, 0) = (a, b) and (a, b) ⊙(1, 0) = (a, b),
for all a, b ∈R. Below, we prove a further important arithmetic property of ⊙,
which is known as the cancellation law.
Lemma 13.1 The following cancellation law holds for ⊙:
(a, b) ⊙(c, d) = (0, 0) ⇒(a, b) = (0, 0) or (c, d) = (0, 0).
Proof Since (a, b)⊙(c, d) = (ac−bd, ad+bc), we get ac−bd = 0 and ad+bc =
0. Therefore, arguing as in the proof of Euler’s identity (cf. Lemma 12.32), we get
0 = (ac −bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2).
Hence, either a2 + b2 = 0 or c2 + d2 = 0, which is the same as saying that either
(a, b) = 0 or (c, d) = 0.
⊓⊔
Now, let us look at the real line as the horizontal axis of the cartesian plane,
which is equivalent to identifying each real number x with the ordered pair (x, 0).
We have to check whether such an identiﬁcation is good, in the sense that the results
of performing ⊕and ⊙with such ordered pairs give (up to identiﬁcation) the same

13.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
319
results we would get if we ﬁrst performed the usual operations of addition and
multiplication of real numbers. This reduces to verifying that
(x, 0) ⊕(y, 0) = (x + y, 0) and (x, 0) ⊙(y, 0) = (xy, 0),
(13.2)
which is totally immediate.
Thanks to the above computations, together with the fact that x →(x, 0) is
injective, we can safely consider R, furnished with its usual operations of addition
and multiplication, as a subset of R × R, furnished with the operations ⊕and ⊙
deﬁned as in (13.1). This also allows us to call the points of the cartesian plane as
numbers, more precisely as the complex numbers. From now on, we shall denote
the set of complex numbers by C.
In what follows, we shall derive an easier way to represent the set of complex
numbers and its operations. To this end, let us henceforth denote by i the complex
number (0, 1), calling it the imaginary unit.1
Letting ≈denote the identiﬁcation of the points along the horizontal axis with
real numbers, and taking into account the deﬁnition of ⊙, we are led to conclude
that
i2 = (0, 1) ⊙(0, 1) = (0 · 0 −1 · 1, 0 · 1 + 1 · 0) = (−1, 0) ≈−1.
(13.3)
Note also that
(a, b) = (a, 0) ⊕(0, b) = (a, 0) ⊕((b, 0) ⊙(0, 1)) ≈a + bi,
(13.4)
which is said to be the algebraic form.
From now on, we shall write simply + and · to respectively denote the operations
⊕and ⊙, and shall write a + bi to denote the complex number (a, b). We shall
also omit the identiﬁcations involved, for, as we shall see in a few moments, there
is no danger that such a usage induces wrong arithmetic inside C. It thus follows
from (13.4) that
a + bi = 0 ⇔(a, b) = (0, 0) ⇔a = b = 0.
According to (13.3), in the set C of complex numbers the equation
x2 + 1 = 0
1The names complex and imaginary are rooted in the historical development of complex numbers.
More precisely, when mathematicians started using complex numbers, even without having a
precise deﬁnition of what they should be, they called them complex or imaginary, in allusion to the
oddness of guessing the existence of “numbers” whose squares could be negative.

Complex Numbers
has i as a root. As we shall see along this chapter and Chap. 15, this is the core fact
related to the importance of complex numbers.
As we anticipated above, a good reason for writing (a, b) ∈C in the algebraic
form a + bi is that, upon doing it, we can operate with complex numbers exactly as
we do with reals; one just has to take into account that i2 = −1. Indeed, we check
below that the computations performed this way lead to the same results as those
done by directly using the deﬁnitions of + and · (i.e., ⊕and ⊙) in C:
•
Computation of (a, b) + (c, d): by deﬁnition, we have (a, b) + (c, d) = (a +
c, b + d). On the other hand, operating as we would do with reals, we obtain
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i.
However, since we are writing (a + c, b + d) = (a + c) + (b + d)i, both results
do coincide.
•
Computation of (a, b) · (c, d): by deﬁnition, we have (a, b) · (c, d) = (ac −
bd, ad + bc). Operating once more as with real numbers, we get
(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi2 = (ac −bd) + (ad + bc)i,
since i2 = −1. Here again we are writing (ac −bd, ad + bc) = (ac −bd) +
(ad + bc)i, so that both results also coincide.
Thanks to the above identiﬁcations, we can surely write R ⊂C, with x ∈R
written in algebraic form as x + 0i. Moreover, by analogy with the addition and
multiplication of reals, we shall also call the + and · operations on complex numbers
as the addition and multiplication, respectively.
Proceeding with the development of the theory, let us introduce in C other two
operations, this time extending the subtraction and division of real numbers. Before
we go on, we remark that it is common usage to write z, w etc to refer to general
complex numbers, so that each one of them has its own algebraic form.
Given z, w ∈C, subtracting w of z means obtaining a complex number z −w
(the difference between z and w) such that z = (z−w)+w. Writing z = a +bi and
w = c + di and operating as with reals, we easily see that the only possible way of
deﬁning z −w is by letting
z −w = (a + bi) −(c + di) = (a −c) + (b −d)i.
Formally, for z = a + bi and w = c + di, the complex number z −w is deﬁned by
z −w = (a −c) + (b −d)i,
(13.5)
being called the difference between z and w, in this order.
Also for z, w ∈C, with w ̸= 0, dividing z by w means obtaining a complex
number z/w (the quotient between z and w) such that z = (z/w) · w. Letting

13.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
321
z = a + bi and w = c + di, and operating as we do upon rationalising real number,
we immediately get
z
w = a + bi
c + di = (a + bi)(c −di)
(c + di)(c −di)
= (ac + bd) + (bc −ad)i
c2 + d2
= ac + bd
c2 + d2 + bc −ad
c2 + d2 i.
as the only possibility for z/w.
Formally, for z = a + bi and w = c + di, with w ̸= 0, the complex number z/w
is deﬁned by
z
w = ac + bd
c2 + d2 + bc −ad
c2 + d2 i,
(13.6)
being called the quotient between z and w, in this order.
The particular case of dividing 1 by a nonzero complex number leads us to
conclude that every complex number z ̸= 0 possess an inverse with respect to
multiplication. Writing z = a + ib ̸= 0, it follows from (13.6) that such an inverse,
which we shall denote by z−1 or 1/z, is given by
z−1 =
a
a2 + b2 −
b
a2 + b2 i.
Once again, note that we need not worry about memorizing the above formulas. It
just sufﬁces to operate as we do with real numbers.
In order to simplify lots of forthcoming computations, we now introduce the
following notation: for z = a + bi ∈C, we write z to denote the complex number
z = a −bi, and call it the conjugate of z. In particular, we have z = z.
Note also that, upon multiplying z by z, we get as result the real number a2 + b2,
for
z · z = (a + bi)(a −bi) = a2 −(bi)2 = a2 + b2.
We write |z| =
√
a2 + b2 and call |z| the modulus of z. When z ∈R, it is
immediate to note that the notion of modulus of a complex number, as deﬁned
above, coincides with the usual notion of the modulus of a real number (cf. [8],
for instance). In short,
z = a + bi ⇒|z|2 = zz = a2 + b2.

Yet another simple fact concerning the modulus of a complex number is that
|z| = |z|. This will become geometrically apparent quite soon (cf. Fig. 13.1),
provided we go back to the very deﬁnition of C, looking at complex numbers as the
points of the cartesian plane. Upon doing this, we obtain a geometric representation
of C, which is known as the complex plane.2
In the complex plane, the horizontal and vertical axes are respectively called
the real and imaginary. The real axis is this formed by the complex numbers
which are actually real numbers (i.e., by the ordered pairs (x, 0) ≈x), whereas the
complex numbers along the imaginary axis are those of the form yi, with y ∈R
(this corresponds to the ordered pairs (0, y) = (y, 0) · (0, 1) ≈yi); such complex
numbers are called pure imaginary (so that i is one of them).
Also with respect to the complex plane, since z = a +bi = (a, b), it follows that
z and z = a −bi are symmetric with respect to the real axis (cf. Fig. 13.1); hence,
|z| = |z|. On the other hand, the real numbers a and b are respectively called the
real and imaginary parts of z, and are denoted
a = Re(z), b = Im(z).
Thus, z = Re(z) + i Im(z), so that z = Re(z) −i Im(z) and, hence,
Re(z) = z + z

and Im(z) = z −z

The following lemma collects further useful properties of the conjugation of
complex numbers. In order to properly state it, we observe that the associativity
of the multiplication of complex numbers guarantees the well deﬁniteness of the
n−th power zn, for z ∈C and n ∈N, as z1 = z and
zn = z · . . . · z

for n > 1. Moreover, such a deﬁnition can be easily extended to integer exponents
n by setting, for z ∈C \ {0}, z0 = 1 and, for an integer n < 0,
zn = (z−n)−1 =
1
z−n .
Then, easy inductive arguments allow us to show that the usual arithmetic rules
for powers remain valid, namely:
(zm)n = zmn and (zw)n = znwn
(13.9)
for all z, w ∈C \ {0} and m, n ∈Z.
We also take the opportunity to point out (although this would not be needed in
the coming lemma) that the usual binomial formula,
(z + w)n =

zn−kwk
(for all z, w ∈C \ {0} such that z + w ̸= 0, and every n ∈N), also holds true in
C, since its proof only depends on properties of addition and multiplication of real
numbers that also hold true in C.
We can ﬁnally state and prove the aforementioned result.
Lemma 13.2 If z and w are nonzero complex numbers, then:
(a) z ∈R ⇔Re(z) = 0 ⇔z = z.
(b) z + w = z + w, zw = z · w and z/w = z/w.
(c) zn = (z)n, for every n ∈Z.
(d) |z| = 1 ⇔z = 1/z.
Proof
(a) Letting z = a + bi, we have
z ∈R ⇔b = 0 ⇔a + bi = a −bi ⇔z = z.

324
13
Complex Numbers
(b) Writing z = a + bi and w = c + di, we compute
z + w = (a −bi) + (c −di)
= (a + c) −(b + d)i
= z + w
and
zw = (ac −bd) + (ad + bc)i
= (ac −bd) −(ad + bc)i
= (a −bi)(c −di) = z · w.
From this last one, it follows that
z/w · w = z/w · w = z
and, hence,
z/w = z/w.
(c) For n = 0, the result is immediate and, for n ∈N, it easily follows by induction
from (b). For an integer n < 0, ﬁrst note that, by item (b), we have
1 = 1 = zz−1 = z · z−1,
so that z−1 = (z)−1; hence, letting u = z−1, the ﬁrst part above, together
with (13.9), furnishes
zn = u−n = (u)−n = ((z)−1)−n = (z)(−1)(−n) = (z)n.
(d) Since (cf. (13.7)) z · z = |z|2, we conclude that
|z| = 1 ⇔z · z = 1 ⇔z = 1/z.
⊓⊔
Example 13.3 (Spain) If z and w are complex numbers of modulus 1 and such that
zw ̸= −1, show that z+w
1+zw is real.
Proof Letting a = z+w
1+zw, item (a) of the previous lemma guarantees that it is enough
to show that a = a. To this end, note that, by applying items (b) and (d) of that same
result, we get

Our next result gives quite a useful geometric interpretation of the modulus of
the difference of two complex numbers.
Proposition 13.4 Given z, w ∈C, the real number |z −w| equals the Euclidean
distance from z to w in the cartesian plane subjacent to the corresponding complex
plane.
Proof If z = a + bi and w = c + di, then
|z −w| = |(a −c) + (b −d)i| =
:
(a −c)2 + (b −d)2.
On the other hand (cf. Fig. 13.2), basic Analytic Geometry (cf. Chapter 6 of [9])

The coming inequality (13.10) is known as the triangle inequality for complex
numbers.
Corollary 13.5 If u, v and z are any complex numbers, then
|u −v| ≤|u −z| + |z −v|.
(13.10)
Proof According to Proposition 13.4, the corollary only says that the length of any
side of a (possibly degenerate) triangle does not exceed the sum of the lengths of
its other two sides. However, we already know this to be true (cf. Theorem 2.26 of
[9]).

1. With respect to the operations of addition and multiplication of complex
numbers, check that they are associative and commutative, as well as that
multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. Check also that (0, 0)
and (1, 0) are unit elements for the addition and multiplication, respectively.
2. * Given z, w ∈C, prove that:
(a) |zw| = |z| · |w| and (if w ̸= 0) |z/w| = |z|/|w|.
(b) |z + w|2 = |z|2 + 2Re(zw) + |w|2.
3. * Use item (b) of the previous problem to establish, for all z, w ∈C \ {0}, the
validity of the inequality |z+w| ≤|z|+|w|, with equality if and only if z = λw,
for some λ > 0. This inequality is also known as the triangle inequality for
complex numbers. Use it to:
(a) Deduce the validity of (13.10).
(b) Prove that ||z| −|w|| ≤|z −w|, for all z, w ∈C.

For the coming problem, we deﬁne a sequence of complex numbers as

8. Given z, w ∈C, let u and v be the vectors starting at 0 and having z and w
as endpoints, respectively. Prove that the complex numbers z + w and z −w
are the endpoints of the vectors u + v and u −v, respectively, both of which
starting at 0.
For the coming problem, recall (cf. Sect. 4.3) that a (partial) order relation
in a nonempty set X is a relation ⪯in X which is reﬂexive, transitive and
antisymmetric; moreover, if we have x ⪯y or y ⪯x for all x, y ∈X, then the
order relation ⪯is said to be a total ordering of X.
9. Prove that the set of complex numbers cannot be totally ordered. More
precisely, prove that there does not exist, on C, a total ordering ⪯, which
extends the usual order relation in R and satisﬁes the conditions
0 ⪯z, w ⇒0 ⪯z + w, zw.
The coming problem generalizes the construction of C, presenting the set H
of Hamilton’s3 quaternions (also called quaternionic numbers).
10. * In H = {(a, b, c, d); a, b, c, d, ∈R}, let ⊕and ⊙be the operations deﬁned,
for α = (a, b, c, d) and β = (w, x, y, z), by
α ⊕β = (a + w, b + x, c + y, d + z)
and
α ⊙β = (aw −bx −cy −dz, ax + bw + cz −dy,
ay −bz + cw + dx, az + by −cx + dw),
where + and · respectively denote the usual operations of addition and
multiplication of real numbers. Such operations are called the addition and
multiplication of H. With respect to them, do the following items:
(a) Show that the function ι : R →H, given by ι(x) = (x, 0, 0, 0) preserves
operations, in the sense that
ι(x) ⊕ι(y) = ι(x + y) and ι(x) ⊙ι(y) = ι(x + y),
for all x, y ∈R.
(b) Show that the functions ι1, ι2, ι3 : C →H, given by ι1(x + yi) =
(x, y, 0, 0), ι2(x +yi) = (x, 0, y, 0) and ι3(x +yi) = (x, 0, 0, y), preserve
operations, in the sense that
ιj(z) ⊕ιj(w) = ιj(z + w) and ιj(z) ⊙ιj(w) = ιj(z + w),
for all z, w ∈C and 1 ≤j ≤3.

(c) In view of items (a) and (b), we hereafter write simply + and · to denote
⊕and ⊙, respectively, x to denote (x, 0, 0, 0) and i = (0, 1, 0, 0), j =
(0, 0, 1, 0) and k = (0, 0, 0, 1). Under these conventions, show that

(a, b, c, d) = a + bi + cj + dk.
(d) Show that the results of (a + bi + cj + dk) + (w + xi + yj + zk) and
(a + bi + cj + dk) · (w + xi + yj + zk) are the same we would have
obtained by using the usual operations of addition and multiplication of
real numbers, together with (13.11). From this, conclude that:
i. The addition of quaternions is commutative, associative and has 0 as
identity.
ii. The multiplication of quaternions is associative, distributive with
respect to + and has 1 as identity; nevertheless, it is not commutative.
(e) For α = a + bi + cj + dk ∈H, let α = a −bi −cj −dj be the conjugate
of α. For α, β ∈H, show that αβ = αβ.
(f) For α = a +bi +cj +dk ∈H, let |α| =
√
a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 be the norm
of α. Show that αα = |α|2 and |αβ| = |α||β|, for all α, β ∈H.
(g) Use the result of the previous item to deduce identity (12.10).
(h) Conclude that, given α ∈H \ {0}, there exists a single β ∈H for which
αβ = 1. Then, show that the following cancellation law holds in H: if
α, β ∈H are such that αβ = 0, then α = 0 or β = 0.

The Polar Form of a Complex Number
Given z = a + bi ∈C \ {0}, let α ∈[0, 2π) be the least value, in radians, of the
trigonometric angle measured from the positive real axis to the half line joining 0 to
z (cf. Fig. 13.3).

cos α =

so that
z = |z|(cos α + i sin α).
(13.12)
Since sin(α + 2kπ) = sin α and cos(α + 2kπ) = cos α for every k ∈Z,
equality (13.12) continues to hold with α + 2kπ in place of α. For this reason,
from now on we say that the real numbers of the form α + 2kπ, with k ∈Z,
are the arguments of the nonzero complex numbers z, and that α is its principal
argument.
Letting α be any argument of z ∈C \ {0}, we shall call (13.12) the polar, or
trigonometric, form of z. Note that
| cos α + i sin α| = 1,
(13.13)
for every α ∈R. Hereafter, we shall denote the complex number cos α + i sin α
simply by cis α. Thus, letting α be an argument of z ∈C \ {0}, it follows
from (13.12) that
z = |z| cis α.
The coming example presents an interesting, albeit elementary, use of the notion
of argument of a nonzero complex number.
Example 13.6 Among all complex numbers z for which |z −25i| ≤15, ﬁnd the
one having smallest principal argument.
Solution The complex numbers satisfying the given condition are those situated on
the closed disk bounded by the circle of center 25i and radius 15. Among these, the

one with smallest principal argument, say z, is easily seen to be such that the half
line starting at 0 and passing through z is tangent to the aforementioned circle in the
ﬁrst quadrant of the cartesian plane (see the ﬁgure below).

Im

Since the radius of the circle is 15, Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the right
triangle with vertices 25i, z and 0 gives |z| = 20. Now, letting z = a + bi, we have
that a equals the height of such a right triangle relative to its hypotenuse. Therefore,
the usual metric relations on right triangles (cf. Chapter 4 of [9], for instance) give
25a = 15 · 20, so that a = 12. From |z| = 20 we get
202 = |z|2 = a2 + b2 = 122 + b2
and, since z belongs to the ﬁrst quadrant, b = 16. Hence, z = 12 + 16i.
⊓⊔
Back to the development of the theory, we now present the computational
advantages of the polar form of nonzero complex numbers. We start with a simple,
albeit very important result.
Proposition 13.7 Given α, β ∈R, we have
cis α · cis β = cis (α + β).
(13.14)
Proof It is enough to compute
cis α · cis β = (cos α + i sin α)(cos β + i sin β)
= (cos α cos β −sin α sin β) + i(cos α sin β + cos β sin α)
= cos(α + β) + i sin(α + β)
= cis (α + β),
where in the third equality above we applied the usual addition formulas of
Trigonometry (cf. Chapter 7 of [9], for instance).

The coming corollary provides the usual geometric interpretation for the multi-
plication of complex numbers, one of which of modulus 1. For the general case, we
refer the reader to Problem 1.
Corollary 13.8 Let α be a given real number and z ∈C \ {0}. If u is the vector
that goes from 0 to z, then the point of the complex plane representing (cis α) · z is
the endpoint of the vector obtained from u by means of a trigonometric rotation4 of
center 0 and angle α (cf. Fig. 13.4).
Proof Letting z = |z| cis θ, we have from (13.14) that
z · cis α = |z| cis θ · cis α = |z| cis (θ + α).
Now, the description of the polar form assures that this last complex number is
precisely the endpoint of the vector obtained from u by means of a trigonometric
rotation of α radians.
⊓⊔
Formula (13.15) below, known as the ﬁrst de Moivre’s formula, gives further
insight on the computational advantages of the polar representation of nonzero
complex numbers.
Proposition 13.9 (de Moivre) If z = |z| cis α is a nonzero complex number and
n ∈Z, then
zn = |z|n cis (nα).
(13.15)
Proof The case n = 0 is trivial. For the time being, assuming we have proved the
formula for n > 0, let us show how to set its validity also for n < 0. To this end,
4Recall that this means we rotate u through an angle of α radians, in the counterclockwise sense if
α > 0 and in the clockwise sense if α < 0.

332
13
Complex Numbers
let n = −m, with m ∈N. Given θ ∈R, it follows from item (d) of Lemma 13.2,
together with |cis θ| = 1, that
(cis θ)−1 = cis θ = cos θ + i sin θ = cos θ −i sin θ
= cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ) = cis (−θ).
(13.16)
Therefore, since we are assuming the validity of (13.15) with m in place of n, we
get
zn = z−m = (|z| cis α)−m = |z|−m( cis (mα))−1
= |z|n cis (−mα) = |z|n cis (nα).
For n > 0, let us make induction on n, the case n = 1 being trivial. Assuming
that the result holds true for some n ∈N and invoking (13.14), we obtain
zn+1 = z · zn = |z| cis α · |z|n cis (nα)
= |z|n+1 cis α · cis (nα)
= |z|n+1 cis (n + 1)α.
⊓⊔
Let us now compute the arguments of the product and the quotient of two nonzero
complex numbers.
Corollary 13.10 If z = |z| cis α and w = |w| cis β are nonzero complex numbers,
then
zw = |zw|cis (α + β) and z
w = |z|
|w| · cis (α −β).
In particular, α + β (resp. α −β) is the measure, in radians of an argument for zw
(resp. for z/w).
Proof Let us do the proof for z
w, the other case being entirely analogous. To this
end, it sufﬁces to successively apply (13.16) and (13.14) to get
z
w = |z| cis α · |w|−1 cis (−β) = |z|
|w| · cis (α −β).
⊓⊔
Given n ∈N and z ∈C \ {0}, we say that a complex number w is an n-th root
of z provided wn = z. In contrast with what happens with real numbers, we shall
see next that the number of n-th roots of each nonzero complex number is exactly n.
Nevertheless, whenever there is no danger of confusion, we shall write simply
n√z
to denote any such root. In any case, formula (13.17) below, known as the second
de Moivre’s formula, teaches us how to compute all of them.

13.2
The Polar Form of a Complex Number
333
Proposition 13.11 (de Moivre) If z = |z| cis α is a nonzero complex number and
n ∈N, then there are exactly n distinct complex values for the n-th root of z.
Moreover, such values are given by
n:
|z| · cis
α + 2kπ
n

; 0 ≤k < n, k ∈N,
(13.17)
where
n√|z| stands for the usual positive real root of |z|.
Proof Writing w = r cis θ, we have
wn = z ⇔(r cis θ)n = |z| cis α
⇔rn cis (nθ) = |z| cis α
⇔rn = |z| and nθ = α + 2kπ, ∃k ∈Z.
In turn, these last two equalities take place if and only if r =
n√|z| and θ = α+2kπ
n
,
for some k ∈Z. Hence, there will be as many distinct n-th roots of z as there are
distinct complex numbers of the form cis

α+2kπ
n

. Now, it is easy to see that
cis
α + 2kπ
n

= cis
α + 2(k + n)π
n

and
cis
α + 2kπ
n

̸= cis
α + 2lπ
n

for 0 ≤k < l < n, so that is sufﬁces to consider the integers k such that 0 ≤k < n.
⊓⊔
In spite of the above formula, it is worth noticing (and will be clear in a few
moments) that its major role is theoretical; in other words, it is not always the best
way of actually computing the roots of a given complex number. This is due to the
fact that not always the polar form of a nonzero complex number is actually useful
in computations, as shown by the coming
Example 13.12 Compute the square roots of 7 + 24i.
Solution If we try to use the second de Moivre’s formula, we ought to start by
writing 7+24i = 25 cis α, with α = arctan 24
7 . Then, we invoke (13.17) to compute
√
7 + 24i as being equal to either
5 cis

or 5 cis
α + 2π

We now get to the point: since α = arctan 24
7 , we shall have to compute cos
 α
2

and sin
 α
2

by knowing tan α = 24
7 . Although this can be done with the adequate
trigonometric formulas, it is much simpler to take an alternative path, which we
shall now describe.
Write 7 + 24i = (a + bi)2, with a, b ∈R, so that a + bi is a square root of
7 + 24i. Expanding (a + bi)2 and equating real and imaginary parts in both sides of
the equality thus obtained, we get the system of equations
 a2 −b2 = 7
ab = 12
.
Squaring the second equation and substituting a2 = b2 +7 in the result, we arrive at
the biquadratic equation (b2+7)b2 = 144, so that b2 = 9. Now, since ab = 12 > 0,
we conclude that a and b must have equal signs, so that the possible ordered pairs
(a, b) are (a, b) = (3, 4) or (−3, −4). Therefore, the square roots we are looking
for are ±(3 + 4i).
⊓⊔
We now present an interesting (and useful) geometric interpretation of the n-th
roots of a nonzero complex number.
Proposition 13.13 If z is a nonzero complex number and n > 2 is natural, then, in
the complex plane, the n-th roots of z are the vertices of a regular n-gon with center
at the origin.
Proof Letting α be an argument of z, it follows from the second formula of de
Moivre that the n-th roots of z are the complex numbers z0, z1, . . . , zn−1 such that
zk =
n:
|z| · cis
α + 2kπ
n

,
for 0 ≤k < n.
From (13.13), we obtain
|zk| =
n:
|z|
			 cis
α + 2kπ
n
			 =
n:
|z|,
so that all of the points zk lie on the circle of the complex plane centered at 0 and
having radius
n√|z|.
On the other hand, it follows from Corollary 13.10 that
zk+1
zk
= cis
2π
n

,
for 0 ≤k < n. Therefore, letting uk denote the vector that goes from 0 to zk,
Corollary 13.8 assures that the angle between uk and uk+1, in radians and in the
counterclockwise sense, is equal to 2π
n .
The result follows immediately from these two facts.

As an important particular case of the discussion of roots of complex numbers,
we say that the complex number ω is a root of unity if there exists a natural number
n such that ωn = 1. In this case, ω is said to be an n-th root of unity.
Since 1 = cis 0, the second formula of de Moivre teaches us that the n-th roots
of unity are the n complex numbers given by
ωk = cis
2kπ
n

; 0 ≤k < n, k ∈Z.
(13.18)
Writing ω = cis 2π
n , it follows from the ﬁrst formula of de Moivre that

Therefore, the n-th roots of unity are the complex numbers
1, ω, . . . , ωn−1.
(13.19)
As we shall see along the rest of this book, roots of unity are quite useful in a
number of situations, both algebraic and combinatorial. For the time being, a clue of
why this is so is provided by the following consequence of the previous proposition.
In order to properly state it, from now on we shall refer to the circle of the complex
plane with center 0 and radius 1 simply as the unit circle.
Corollary 13.15 If n > 2 is a natural number, then the n-th roots of unity are the
vertices of the regular n-gon inscribed in the unit circle and having 1 as one of its
vertices.

the complex numbers 1, ω, . . . , ω5 are the sixth roots of unity. Note also that 1, ω2
and ω4 are the cubic roots of unity, whereas ω, ω3 = −1 and ω5 are the cubic roots
of −1.
We ﬁnish this section by presenting two examples involving roots of unity and
which are somewhat more algebraic in nature.
Example 13.17 Given n ∈N, ﬁnd all of the solutions of equation (z −1)n = zn.
Solution Since z = 0 is not a solution, the given equation is equivalent to

1 −1
z
n
= 1. Hence, letting ω = cis 2π
n , the above discussion assures that 1 −1
z
is an n-th root of unity, thus being equal to one of the numbers 1, ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1.
Now, observe that 1 −1
z = 1 has no solutions. On the other hand, for 1 ≤k ≤
n −1 we have ωk ̸= 1, so that 1 −1
z = ωk if and only if z =
1
1−ωk . Thus, the
solutions of the given equation are the n −1 complex numbers

1 −ω,

1 −ω2 , . . . ,

⊓⊔
For the next example, recall (cf. discussion preceding Problem 7, page 326) that
a sequence of complex numbers is a function f : N →C, which, most often, will
be simply denoted by (zn)n≥1, where zn = f (n). This being said, we observe that
the proof of the formula for the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of an arithmetic progression
with common ratio different from 0 and 1 (cf. item (b) of Proposition 3.12 of [8], for
instance) still holds, ipsis literis, for a geometric progression of complex numbers,

13.2
The Polar Form of a Complex Number
337
i.e., a sequence (zn)n≥1 in C such that zk+1 = qzk for every k ≥1, with q ∈
C \ {0, 1}. Hence, we can safely skip the proof of the following auxiliary result.
Lemma 13.18 For z ∈C \ {0, 1}, we have
1 + z + z2 + · · · + zn−1 = zn −1
z −1 .
As a direct corollary of such a result, we note that if ω ̸= 1 is an n-th root of
unity, then ωn = 1 and, hence,
1 + ω + ω2 + · · · + ωn−1 = ωn −1
ω −1 = 0.
(13.20)
We shall use this formula several times along this text.
Example 13.19 (IMO) Prove that
cos π
7 −cos 2π
7 + cos 3π
7 = 1
2.
Proof Letting ω = cis 2π
7 be a seventh root of unity, we get
Re(ω + ω2 + ω3) = cos 2π
7 + cos 4π
7 + cos 6π
7
= cos 2π
7 −cos 3π
7 −cos π
7 .
On the other hand, since ωk · ω7−k = 1 and |ωk| = 1, item (d) of Lemma 13.2
furnishes
ω7−k = (ωk)−1 = ωk.
Therefore, ω + ω2 + ω3 = ω6 + ω5 + ω4 and, hence,
Re(ω + ω2 + ω3) = Re(ω6 + ω5 + ω4).
(13.21)
Now, (13.20) gives
ω + ω2 + · · · + ω6 = −1.
Taking real parts and using (13.21), we obtain
2Re(ω + ω2 + ω3) = Re(ω + ω2 + ω3) + Re(ω6 + ω5 + ω4) = −1.

More on Roots of Unity
We begin this section by illustrating the role of roots of unity as a counting tool.
Although several applications of algebraic arguments in Combinatorics will appear
along the rest of these notes, this is a much broader subject than we will be able to
present here. For a more comprehensive introduction we refer the interested reader
to the excellent classical book of Van Lint and Wilson [40].
We start by examining, in the coming example, how to use complex numbers as
tags.
Example 13.20 We put n > 1 equally spaced lamps around a circle. At ﬁrst, exactly
one of then is ON. An allowed operation on the states of the lamps is to choose a
positive divisor d of n, with d < n, and change the status of n
d equally spaced lamps

340
13
Complex Numbers
(i.e., from ON to OFF or vice-versa), provided all of them have the same status. Does
there exist a sequence of allowed operations that leaves all of the n lamps ON?
Solution No! By contradiction, assume, without loss of generality, that the circle is
the unit circle in the complex plane and the lamps are positioned at the points 1, ω,
. . . , ωn−1, where ω = cis 2π
n . Assume also (again with no loss of generality) that
the lamp which is initially ON is the one standing at 1.
For every integer k ≥0, let ak denote the sum of the complex numbers associated
to the lamps which are ON immediately before the (k+1)-th operation is performed,
so that a0 = 1. Along the (k + 1)-th operation, we choose lamps positioned at
ωl, ωl+d, ωl+2d, . . . , ωl+( n
d −1)d,
for some pair (l, d) of integers such that 0 ≤l < d and d | n, with d < n. Since
ωn = 1, we have
ak+1 = ak ± (ωl + ωl+d + ωl+2d + · · · + ωl+( n
d −1)d)
= ak ± ωl+( n
d −1)d · ωd −ωl
ωd −1
= ak,
and it follows that ak = 1 for every k ≥0.
On the other hand, if after m operations all lamps were ON, then we would have
am = 1 + ω + · · · + ωn = 0,
which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Now, given m, n, p ∈N, let us consider the problem of assembling an m × n
rectangle by using rectangular pieces 1 × p. Counting 1 × 1 squares, we obtain
an obvious necessary condition for the proposed assembling to be possible: p must
divide mn. On the other hand, it is clear that if p divides either m or n, then the
assembling is always possible: letting, for instance, m = pk, with k ∈N, it sufﬁces
to juxtapose k rectangles p × n, each of which assembled by piling n pieces 1 × p,
one on the top of the other. The interesting fact here is that the converse of the
above discussion holds true, namely: one can assemble the desired rectangle only
if p divides m or n. This is the content of the coming theorem, which is due to the
American mathematician David Klarner.5
Theorem 13.21 (Klarner) Let m, n and p be given naturals. If we can assemble
an m × n rectangle by using pieces 1 × p, then p | m or p | n.
5Cf. Klarner and Göbel [24]. Nevertheless, the proof we present here is different from the original
one.

Proof Assume we can perform such a task, and note ﬁrst that p ≤max{m, n}. Now,
partition the rectangle into m rows 1 × n and n columns m × 1, numbering the rows
from 1 to m from top to bottom, and the columns from 1 to n from left to right (as
is usual in an m × n matrix). Then, inside the 1 × 1 square of intersection of row i
and column j, write the complex number ωi+j, where ω = cis 2π
p .
Let us now compute the sum of all of the numbers written in the 1 × 1 squares in
two different ways (here we have a double counting!). On the one hand, such a sum
is clearly equal to
(ω + ω2 + · · · + ωn)(ω + ω2 + · · · + ωm) = ω2(ωn −1)(ωm −1)
(ω −1)2
,
(13.22)
where we have used Lemma 13.18 in the equality above; on the other, since we
are assuming that it is possible to assemble the rectangle as wished, the numbers
written on it can be grouped together in sets of p numbers each, corresponding to
the p horizontal or vertical 1 × 1 squares forming each one of the 1 × p rectangles
used. Such sets of p complex numbers give rise to sums of one of the following
types:
ωi+j + ωi+(j+1) + · · · + ωi+(j+p−1)
or
ωi+j + ω(i+1)+j + · · · + ω(i+p−1)+j,
according to whether the 1 × p rectangle is horizontally or vertically positioned,
respectively. Again by Lemma 13.18, together with the ﬁrst de Moivre’s formula,
each of such sums equals
ωi+j(1 + ω + · · · + ωp−1) = ωi+j · ωp −1
ω −1 = 0.
Hence, the sum of all of the mn numbers written in the rectangle must also vanish.
Therefore, it follows from (13.22) that (ωn −1)(ωm −1) = 0 or, which is the same,
that
cis 2nπ
p
= 1 or cis 2mπ
p
= 1.
Finally, it is clear from these equalities that p | n or p | m.
⊓⊔
We devote the rest of this section to take a closer look at the structure of the set
of n-th roots of unity. We start by letting Un(C) denote it, so that
Un(C) = {z ∈C; zn = 1} = {ωk
n; 1 ≤k ≤n},
where ωn = cis 2π
n .

342
13
Complex Numbers
We begin by showing that the intersection of Um(C) and Un(C) is again a set of
roots of unity.
Proposition 13.22 Given m, n ∈N, one has
Um(C) ∩Un(C) = Ud(C),
where d = gcd(m, n). In particular, if m and n are relatively prime, then Um(C) ∩
Un(C) = {1}.
Proof The second part follows immediately from the ﬁrst. For the ﬁrst part, if z ∈
Ud(C), then zd = 1 and, hence, zm = (zd)m/d = 1. Analogously, zn = 1, so
that z ∈Um(C) ∩Un(C). This reasoning shows that Ud(C) ⊂Um(C) ∩Un(C).
Conversely, let z ∈Um(C) ∩Un(C). Bézout’s theorem assures the existence of
x, y ∈Z such that mx + ny = d. Therefore, since zm = zn = 1, we get
zd = zmx+ny = (zm)x(zn)y = 1,
so that z ∈Ud(C). Hence, Um(C) ∩Un(C) ⊂Ud(C), and we are done.
⊓⊔
We now specialize to a particular type of root of unity, according to the deﬁnition
below.
Deﬁnition 13.23 A complex number z ∈Un(C) is a primitive n-th root of unity
if
Un(C) = {zm; m ∈N}.
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that ωn is a primitive n-th root of unity.
On the other hand, the following result completely characterizes all of such special
roots.
Theorem 13.24 Given z ∈Un(C), the following are equivalent:
(a) z is primitive.
(b) There exists an integer 1 ≤k ≤n such that gcd(k, n) = 1 and z = ωk
n.
(c) min{l ∈N; zl = 1} = n.
In particular, there are exactly ϕ(n) primitive n-th roots of unity, where ϕ : N →N
stands for the Euler function.
Proof
(a) ⇒(b):
let z = ωk
n, for some integer 1 ≤k ≤n. If gcd(k, n) = d > 1, then
n = dn′ and k = dk′, for some k′, n′ ∈N. Also,
{zj; j ∈N} = {ωk
n, ω2k
n , ω3k
n , . . .}.

13.3

Letting m = n′q + r, with q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < n′, we have
ωmk
n
= ω(n′q+r)dk′
n
= ωnqk′
n
· ωrk
n = ωrk
n ∈{1, ωk
n, . . . , ω(n′−1)k
n
}.
Therefore,
#{zj; j ∈N} ≤n′ = n
d < n.
(b) ⇒(c):
let z = ωk
n, where 1 ≤k ≤n is an integer relatively prime with n.
Take l ∈N for which zl = 1. Then, ωkl
n = 1 and, thus, n | kl. However, since
gcd(k, n) = 1, item (a) of Proposition 6.22 assures that n | l; in turn, this gives
l ≥n. On the other hand, since zn = (ωk
n)n = (ωn
n)k = 1, we conclude that
min{l ∈N; zl = 1} = n.
(c) ⇒(a):
assuming that min{l ∈N; zl = 1} = n, we ﬁrst show that, for integers
1 ≤r < s ≤n, we have zr ̸= zs. Indeed, if we had zr = zs, then we would have
zs−r = 1, with 1 ≤s −r < n; but this would contradict the assumed minimality
of n. It follows from this claim that z, z2, . . . , zn are pairwise distinct n-th roots
of unity, so that {zj; j ∈N} = Un(C). Then, z is primitive.
⊓⊔
In the sequel, we show that primitive roots of unity provide another way to
establish the multiplicative character of the Euler function. To this end, we need
a preliminary result which is interesting in itself.
Theorem 13.25 Let z and w be primitive roots of unity, of orders m and n,
respectively. If gcd(m, n) = 1, then zw is a primitive root of unity of order mn.
Proof Since zm = wn = 1, we have (zw)mn = (zm)n(wn)m = 1, so that zw ∈
Umn(C). Now, take l ∈N such that (zw)l = 1. Then,
zl = (w−1)l ∈Um(C) ∩Un(C) = {1},
where we used Proposition 13.22 in the last passage above. Therefore, zl
=
(w−1)l = 1.
Now, the previous theorem, together with the fact that z and w−1 = wn−1 are
primitive roots of unity of orders m and n, respectively, guarantees that l | m and
l | n. However, since gcd(m, n) = 1, item (e) of Proposition 6.22 gives mn | l.
Hence, l ≥mn, so that the equivalences of the previous theorem imply that zw is a
primitive root of unity of order mn.
⊓⊔
For our ﬁnal result, we let Un(C)× denote the subset of Un(C) formed by the
primitive roots of unity of order n:
Un(C)× = {ωk
n; 1 ≤k ≤n and gcd(k, n) = 1}.

344
13
Complex Numbers
Theorem 13.26 If m and n are relatively prime natural numbers, then the map
Um(C)× × Un(C)× −→Umn(C)×
(z, w)
−→
zw
is a well deﬁned bijection. In particular, ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n), where ϕ : N →N
stands for the Euler function.
Proof The well deﬁniteness of the given map follows immediately from the
previous result. On the other hand, if we show that it is a bijection, then two
applications of the last part of Theorem 13.24 will furnish
ϕ(mn) =
		Umn(C)×		 =
		Um(C)× × Un(C)×		
=
		Um(C)×		 ·
		Un(C)×		 = ϕ(m)ϕ(n).
We now show what is left, in two steps:
(i) The map is injective: take z1, z2 ∈Um(C)× and w1, w2 ∈Un(C)× such that
z1w1 = z2w2. Since gcd(m, n) = 1, we have
z−1
2 z1 = w2w−1
1
∈Um(C) ∩Un(C) = {1}.
Therefore, z−1
2 z1 = w2w−1
1
= 1, which is the same as z1 = z2 and w1 = w2.
(ii) The map is surjective: let 1 ≤k ≤mn be an integer such that gcd(k, mn) = 1.
We wish to ﬁnd nonzero integers x and y such that gcd(x, n) = gcd(y, m) = 1
and, letting z = ωy
m, w = ωx
n, we have zw = ωk
mn (why does this sufﬁce?). To
this end, we must have
cis 2(mx + ny)π
mn
= cis 2kπ
mn ,
which happens if mx+ny = k. However, since gcd(m, n) = 1, Proposition 6.26
assures that such integers x and y do exist.
⊓⊔
We shall have more to say on the combinatorial and algebraic aspects of roots of
unity in Sects. 14.1 and 20.2, respectively.

complex numbers having the following property: if any two of its elements (not
necessarily distinct) are multiplied, we obtain another element of it as result. Find
all such possible sets A.

being 1 × 3 rectangles and one being an 1 × 1 square. Find all possible positions

6. Prove the following extension of Klarner’s theorem: given natural numbers m,
n, p and q such that 1 < q ≤min{m, n, p}, we can assemble an m × n × p
parallelepiped by using pieces 1 × 1 × q if and only if q divides m, n or p.
7. We can further generalize Klarner’s theorem as follows: given m1, . . . , mn ∈N,
let
A = Im1 × · · · × Imn,
be the set of all sequences (x1, . . . , xn) of positive integers such that 1 ≤xk ≤
mk for 1 ≤k ≤n. A (1, . . . , 1, p)-block in A is a subset of A formed by p
sequences (x11, . . . , x1n), . . . , (xp1, . . . , xpn) satisfying the following condition:
there exists an integer 1 ≤k ≤n such that:
(a) x1j = x2j = · · · = xpj for every 1 ≤j ≤n, j ̸= k.
(b) (x1k, x2k, . . . , xpk) is a sequence of p consecutive integers.
We say that A can be partitioned into (1, . . . , 1, p)-blocks if A can be written
as the disjoint union of such blocks. Prove that this is possible if and only if p
divides one of the numbers m1, . . . , mn.
8. (Russia) We wish to partition the set of four-digit natural numbers into subsets of
four numbers each, in such a way that the following property is satisﬁed: the four
number that compose each subset have the same digits in some three decimal
places, whereas, in the fourth place, their digits are consecutive (for instance, a
possibility for the four numbers of a subset could be 1265, 1275, 1285 and 1295).
Prove that there does not exist such a partition.

Chapter 14
Polynomials
From a more algebraic point of view, real polynomial functions can be seen as
polynomials with real coefﬁcients. As we shall see from this chapter on, such a
change of perspective turns out to be quite fruitful, so much that we shall not restrict
ourselves to polynomials with real, or even complex, coefﬁcients; later chapters will
deal with the case of polynomials with coefﬁcients in Zp, for some prime number
p. As a result of such generality, we will be able to prove several results on Number
Theory which would otherwise remain unaccessible. Our purpose in this chapter
is, thus, to start this journey by developing the most elementary algebraic concepts
and results on polynomials. To this end, along all that follows we shall write K to
denote one of Q, R or C, whenever a speciﬁc choice of one of these number sets is
immaterial.
14.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
In this section we collect the basic deﬁnitions and notations on polynomials which
will be needed to the further developments of the theory.
Deﬁnition 14.1 A sequence (a0, a1, a2, . . .) of elements of K is said to vanish
almost everywhere if there exists an integer n ≥−1 such that
an+1 = an+2 = an+3 = · · · = 0.
In words, the sequence (a0, a1, a2, . . .) vanishes almost everywhere if all of its
terms, from a certain index on, are all equal to zero. For instance, both sequences
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, . . .) and (1, 2, 3, . . . , n, 0, 0, 0, . . .)

Polynomials
vanish almost everywhere; on the other hand, the sequence (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . .), with
1’s and 0’s indeﬁnitely alternating themselves, obviously does not vanish almost
everywhere.
Deﬁnition 14.2 A polynomial on (or with coefﬁcients in) K is a formal sum
f (X) = a0 + a1X + a2X2 + a3X3 + · · · :=

k≥0
akXk,
(14.1)
where (a0, a1, a2, . . .) is a sequence of elements of K vanishing almost everywhere
and we make the convention that X0 = 1 and X1 = X in the above sum. Whenever
there is no danger of confusion, we shall simply write f , instead of f (X).
Yet with respect to the above deﬁnition, it is worth noticing that the choice
of X is completely immaterial; in particular, it does not represent a variable, and
could have been substituted by whichever symbol we wanted, say □, for instance.
Also, the correct interpretation of the word formal is that two polynomials f (X) =

k≥0 akXk and g(X) = 
k≥0 bkXk on K are equal if and only if ak = bk for
every k ≥0.
Given a polynomial f (X) = a0 + a1X + a2X2 + a3X3 + · · · on K, we shall
adopt the following conventions:
i. The elements ai ∈K are called the coefﬁcients of f .
ii. If ai = 0, we shall omit the term aiXi whenever convenient. In particular,
since the sequence (a0, a1, a2, . . .) vanishes almost everywhere, there exists an
integer n ≥0 such that we can write
f (X) =
n

k=0
akXk.
iii. If ai = ±1, we shall write ±Xi in place of (±1)Xi, for the corresponding term
of f .
iv. The polynomial 0+0X+0X2+· · · is said to be the identically zero polynomial
on K. We shall also sometimes say that such a polynomial vanishes identically.
Furthermore, whenever there is no danger of confusion with 0 ∈K, we shall
write 0 to denote the identically zero polynomial on K.
v. More generally (and in consonance with items ii. and iv.), given α ∈K we shall
denote the polynomial α + 0X + 0X2 + · · · simply by α, and say that it is the
constant polynomial α. In each case, we shall always rely on the context to
make it clear whether we are referring to the constant polynomial α or to the
element α ∈K.
We let K[X] denote the set of all polynomials on K. In particular, in view of item
v. above, we also make the convention that
K ⊂K[X].

14.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
349
On the other hand, the inclusions Q ⊂R ⊂C furnish the corresponding inclusions
Q[X] ⊂R[X] ⊂C[X].
Example 14.3 If f (X) = 1 + X −X3 +
√
2X7, then f /∈Q[X] (for
√
2 /∈Q) but
f ∈R[X]. On the other hand, the formal sum g = 1+X+X2+X3+X4+· · · does
not represent a polynomial, for the sequence (1, 1, 1, . . .) does not vanish almost
everywhere.
In what follows, we shall use the ordinary operations of addition and multiplica-
tion on K to deﬁne on K[X] operations
⊕: K[X] × K[X] →K[X] and ⊙: K[X] × K[X] →K[X],
also called addition and multiplication, respectively. To this end, we ﬁrst need the
following auxiliary result.
Lemma 14.4 If (ak)k≥0 and (bk)k≥0 are sequences of elements of K that vanish
almost everywhere, then so do the sequences (ak ± bk)k≥0 and (ck)k≥0, where
ck =

i+j=k
i,j≥0
aibj =
k

i=0
aibk−i.
Proof We show that the sequence (ck)k≥0 vanishes almost everywhere, leaving the
other case as an exercise for the reader (cf. Problem 1). Let m, n ∈Z+ be such that
ai = 0 for i > n and bj = 0 for j > m. If k > m + n and i + j = k, with i, j ≥0,
then either i > n or j > m, for otherwise we would have k = i +j ≤n+m, which
is not the case. However, since i > n ⇒ai = 0 and j > m ⇒bj = 0, in any event
we have aibj = 0, so that
ck =

i+j=k
i,j≥0
aibj = 0.
⊓⊔
With the previous lemma at our disposal, we can ﬁnally formulate the deﬁnitions
of addition and multiplication for polynomials.
Deﬁnition 14.5 Given in K[X] polynomials
f (X) =

k≥0
akXk and g(X) =

k≥0
bkXk,

350
14
Polynomials
the sum and product of f and g, respectively denoted by f ⊕g and f ⊙g, are the
polynomials
(f ⊕g)(X) =

k≥0
(ak + bk)Xk
and
(f ⊙g)(X) =

k≥0
ckXk,
with ck = 
i+j=k
i,j≥0
aibj.
Even though the deﬁnition of the product of two polynomials may not seen to be
a natural one at a ﬁrst glance, this is not the case. More precisely, the formula for
the coefﬁcient ck of f ⊙g is the correct one if we wish ⊙to be distributive with
respect to ⊕, as well as the usual rule for powers, Xm ⊙Xn = Xm+n, to be valid.
Indeed, if such properties hold, then computing the product
(a0 + a1X + a2X2 + · · · ) ⊙(b0 + b1X + b2X2 + · · · )
distributively, we obtain
a0b0 =

i+j=0
i,j≥0
aibj
for the coefﬁcient of X0,
a0b1 + a1b0 =

i+j=1
i,j≥0
aibj
for the coefﬁcient of X,
a0b2 + a1b1 + a2b0 =

i+j=2
i,j≥0
aibj
for the coefﬁcient of X2 and so on.
Actually, it is not difﬁcult to convince ourselves (cf. Problem 4) that, as
deﬁned, the operations of addition and multiplication of polynomials on K have
the following properties:
i. commutativity: f ⊕g = g ⊕f and f ⊙g = g ⊙f ;
ii. associativity: (f ⊕g) ⊕h = f ⊕(g ⊕h) and (f ⊙g) ⊙h = f ⊙(g ⊙h);
iii. distributivity: f ⊙(g ⊕h) = (f ⊙g) ⊕(f ⊙h),
for all f, g, h ∈K[X].

Our discussion up to this point makes it clear that we can relax notations,
henceforth writing simply + and · to denote the operations of addition and
multiplication of polynomials. Thus, whenever we add two polynomials, the reader
must be aware of the fact that the involved + signs stand for two distinct operations:
addition of elements of K, performed on the coefﬁcients of the polynomials, and
addition of elements of K[X]. Nevertheless, this will cause no confusion, for the
context will always make it clear which operation the + sign refers to. Moreover, an
analogous comment holds for the · sign and the two operations of multiplication.
Remark 14.7 All of the above deﬁnitions and remarks can be extended, in an
obvious way, to polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. From now on, whenever
necessary, we shall denote the set of such polynomials by Z[X].
Letting 0 be the identically vanishing polynomial, we have f + 0 = 0 + f = 0
for every f ∈K[X], i.e, 0 is the identity for addition of polynomials. On the
other hand, given f ∈K[X], there exists a single g ∈K[X] for which f + g =
g + f = 0; indeed, letting f (X) = a0 + a1X + a2X2 + · · · , it is immediate that
g(X) = −a0 −a1X −a2X2 −· · · is such polynomial, which will henceforth be
denoted by −f . Thus,
(−f )(X) = −a0 −a1X −a2X2 −· · ·
and, for f, g ∈K[X], we can deﬁne the difference f −g between f and g by
f −g = f + (−g).

Polynomials
For α ∈K and g(X) = b0 +b1X +b2X2 +· · · ∈K[X], it is immediate to verify
that
α · g = αb0 + αb1X + αb2X2 + · · · ;
in particular, we have 1 · g = g for every g ∈K[X], so that the constant polynomial
1 is the identity for multiplication of polynomials.
From now on, whenever there is no danger of confusion, we shall write simply
fg, instead of f · g, to denote the product of f, g ∈K[X]. In particular, if α ∈K,
then αf will stand for the product of α, seen as a constant polynomial, and f .
The coming deﬁnition will play a major role along the rest of the book.
Deﬁnition 14.8 Given f (X) = a0 +a1X +· · · +anXn ∈K[X] \ {0}, with an ̸= 0,
the nonnegative integer n is said to be the degree of f , and we will write ∂f = n
to denote this.
According to the above deﬁnition, the notion of degree only applies to nonva-
nishing polynomials. On the other hand, ∂f = 0 for every constant polynomial
f (X) = α, with α ∈K \ {0}. From now on, whenever we refer to f ∈K[X] \ {0}
by writing
f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0,
unless explicitly stated otherwise we shall tacitly assume that an ̸= 0. In such a
case, an will be called the leading coefﬁcient of f . Also, f ∈K[X] \ {0} is said to
be monic if it has leading coefﬁcient equal to 1. Finally, in the above notations a0 is
said to be the constant term of f .
The coming proposition establishes two very important properties of the notion
of degree of polynomials.
Proposition 14.9 For f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}, we have:
(a) ∂(f + g) ≤max{∂f, ∂g} if f + g ̸= 0.
(b) fg ̸= 0 and ∂(fg) = ∂f + ∂g.
Proof Let ∂f = n and ∂g = m, with
f (X) = a0 + a1X + · · · + anXn and g(X) = b0 + b1X + · · · + bmXm.
(a) If m ̸= n, we can assume, without any loss of generality, that m > n. Then
(f + g)(X) = (a0 + b0) + · · · + (an + bn)Xn + bn+1Xn+1 + · · · + bmXm,
so that ∂(f + g) = m = max{∂f, ∂g}. If m = n but f + g ̸= 0, then
(f + g)(X) = (a0 + b0) + · · · + (an + bn)Xn,

14.1
Basic Deﬁnitions and Properties
353
and there are two possibilities: an + bn = 0 or an + bn ̸= 0. In the ﬁrst case,
∂(f + g) < n = max{∂f, ∂g}. In the second, ∂(f + g) = n = max{∂f, ∂g}. In
any case, we have ∂(f + g) ≤max{∂f, ∂g}.
(b) Let fg = c0 + c1X + c2X2 + · · · . If k > m + n, we saw in the proof of
Lemma 14.4 that ck = 0. Hence, if we show that cm+n ̸= 0, we will conclude
that fg ̸= 0 and ∂(fg) = m+n = ∂f +∂g. For what is left to do, since ai = 0
for i > n and bj = 0 for j > m, it is immediate that
cm+n =

⊓⊔
In spite of the fact that the material developed so far is rather elementary, it is
enough to present yet another use of roots of unity as tags (cf. Sect. 13.3). To this
end, given f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈C[X] and z ∈C, it is convenient that
we write f (z) to denote the complex number
f (z) = anzn + · · · + a1z + a0.
(14.2)
(We shall have more to say on this substitution of X by z in Sect. 15.1—cf.
Deﬁnition 15.1.)
Formula (14.3) below is known in mathematical literature as the multisection
formula.

For the coming problem, given f (X) = anXn+an−1Xn−1+· · ·+a1X+a0 ∈
K[X] and m ∈N, we write f (Xm) to denote the polynomial in K[X] deﬁned
by
anXmn + an−1Xm(n−1) + · · · + a1Xm + a0,
i.e., obtained by writing Xm in place of X in the expression of f .
10. (Miklós-Schweitzer) A polynomial with real coefﬁcients is called positively
reducible if it can be written as the product of two nonconstant polynomials
whose nonvanishing coefﬁcients are positive. Let f ∈R[X] have nonvanishing
constant term. If f (Xm) is positively reducible for some natural number m,
prove that f itself is positively reducible.
14.2
The Division Algorithm
We have already seen that it is possible to add, subtract and multiply polynomials,
the result being another polynomial. And what about the possibility of dividing one
polynomial for another? Well, it will not always be possible to do so; in other words,
given polynomials f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}, there will not always exist h ∈K[X] such
that f = gh; for instance, if ∂f < ∂g, then such a polynomial h does not exist, for
otherwise we would have
∂f = ∂(gh) = ∂g + ∂h ≥∂g,
which is an absurd.
In spite of the above discussion, the following analogue of the division algorithm
for integers, called the division algorithm for polynomials, still holds.
Theorem 14.12 If f, g ∈K[X], with g ̸= 0, then there exist unique q, r ∈K[X]
such that
f = gq + r, with r = 0 or ∂r < ∂g.
(14.5)
Proof Let us ﬁrst show that there exists at most one pair of polynomials q, r ∈K[X]
satisfying the stated conditions. To this end, let q1, q2, r1, r2 ∈K[X] be such that
f = gq1 + r1 = gq2 + r2,

14.2
The Division Algorithm
357
with ri = 0 or 0 ≤∂ri < ∂g, for i = 1, 2. Then, g(q1−q2) = r2−r1 and, if q1 ̸= q2,
Problem 5, page 355, would guarantee that r1 ̸= r2. However, Proposition 14.9
would then give
∂g ≤∂g + ∂(q1 −q2) = ∂(g(q1 −q2))
= ∂(r1 −r2) ≤max{∂r1, ∂r2} < ∂g,
which is an absurd. Hence, q1 = q2 and, then, r1 = r2.
Let us now establish the existence of polynomials q and r satisfying the stated
conditions. To this end, we consider two cases separately:
(i) If f = 0, take q = r = 0; if g is (a nonzero) constant, say c, take q = c−1f
and r = 0.
(ii) If f ̸= 0 and g is nonconstant, we shall make induction on ∂f ≥0.
As initial case, if ∂f < ∂g (such an f does exist, for ∂g ≥1), take q = 0 and
r = f . By induction hypothesis, let m ≥∂g be an integer and assume that the
existence of q and r has been established for any polynomial of degree less than m
in place of f . In order to establish the induction step, take f ∈K[X] \ {0} of degree
m, and let b ̸= 0 denote the leading coefﬁcient and n the degree of g. If a stands for
the leading coefﬁcient of f , there are two distinct possibilities:
•
f (X) = ab−1Xm−ng(X): in this case, q(X) = ab−1Xm−n and r(X) = 0.
•
f (X) ̸= ab−1Xm−ng(X): letting h(X) = f (X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X), we have
h ̸= 0 and
h(X) = (aXm + · · · ) −ab−1Xm−n(bXn + · · · ),
so that ∂h < m. Therefore, by induction hypothesis, there exists q1, r1 ∈K[X]
such that h = gq1 + r1, with r1 = 0 or ∂r1 < ∂g. Thus,
f (X) = h(X) + ab−1Xm−ng(X)
= g(X)q1(X) + r1(X) + ab−1Xm−ng(X)
= g(X)(q1(X) + ab−1Xm−n) + r1(X),
and it sufﬁces to take q(X) = q1(X) + ab−1Xm−n and r(X) = r1(X).
⊓⊔
In the notations of the division algorithm for polynomials (and by analogy with
the division algorithm for integers), we say that q is the quotient and r is the
remainder of the division of f by g. Moreover, when r = 0 we say that f is
divisible by g, or that g divides f ; in this case, as with integers we denote g | f .
Remark 14.13 As the reader can easily verify by checking the previous proof,
the division algorithm still holds for polynomials in Z[X], provided the leading

358
14
Polynomials
coefﬁcient of g is equal to ±1. More precisely, if f, g ∈Z[X], with g ̸= 0 having
leading coefﬁcient equal to ±1, then there exists unique polynomials q, r ∈Z[X]
such that
f = gq + r, with r = 0 or ∂r < ∂g.
In all that follows, we shall use this without further comments.
In spite of the name division algorithm, the existence part of the presented proof
for Theorem 14.12 is actually not algorithmic, i.e., it does not provide an actual
algorithm for ﬁnding q and r out of f and g. In order to remedy this, we now revisit
the existence part of the proof in a more algorithmic way:
Division Algorithm for Polynomials
1. DO
•
r ←f ; m ←∂f ; q ←0;
•
a ←LEADING COEFFICIENT OF r;
2. WHILE r ̸= 0 OR ∂r ≥∂g DO
•
r(X) ←r(X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X);
•
q(X) ←q(X) + ab−1Xm−n;
•
m ←∂r
•
a ←LEADING COEFFICIENT OF r;
3. READ THE FINAL VALUES OF r AND q.
Let us prove that the above algorithm does stop after a ﬁnite number of repetitions
of the loop WHILE and give us, at the end, polynomials q and r as wished.
If r ̸= 0 or ∂r ≥∂g, then the instruction of the WHILE loop substitutes r(X) by
the polynomial r(X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X). Such a polynomial, if it is not identically
zero, has degree less than that of r, for the polynomial ab−1Xm−ng(X) has degree m
(which is precisely the degree of r immediately before the execution of the loop) and
leading coefﬁcient a (which is the leading coefﬁcient of r right before the execution
of the loop). Thus, the algorithm stops after a ﬁnite number of steps.
After the ﬁrst attribution, we have
f (X) = g(X)q(X) + r(X),
for, at the beginning, q(X) = 0 and r(X) = f (X). Assume, by induction
hypothesis, that after a certain execution of the WHILE loop we have f (X) =
g(X)q(X) + r(X) and that, at this moment, r(X) ̸= 0 and ∂r ≥∂g. Then, the
next step does take place and replaces r(X) by r(X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X), and q(X)
by q(X) + ab−1Xm−n. Now, since

equals g(X)q(X) + r(X), it follows from induction hypothesis that, after such
additional execution, we will also have (14.6) equal to f (X).
Example 14.14 Follow the algorithm presented above to obtain the quotient and the
remainder upon dividing f (X) = X4 −2X2 +5X +7 by g(X) = 3X2 +1 in Q[X].
Solution Following the notations of the previous discussion, we start by storing
b = 3 and n = 2. Then, we have the following steps:
1. We make the attributions r(X) = X4 −2X2 +5X +7; m = 4; q(X) = 0; a = 1.
2. Since neither r(X) = 0 nor m = 4 < n = 2, we substitute r(X) by
r(X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X) =

q(X) + ab−1Xm−n = 0 + 1

and a by −7
3.
3. Since we still do not have r(X) = 0 or m = 2 < n = 2, we replace r(X) by
r(X) −ab−1Xm−ng(X) =
= −7

and a by 1
3.
4. Now, although r(X) ̸= 0, we have m = 1 < n = 2, so that we do not return to
the beginning of the loop. Instead, we simply read
r(X) = 5X + 70
9
and q(X) = 1

we stick to the convention set in (14.2), of writing f (α) to denote the element
f (α) = anαn + · · · + a1α + a0 ∈K.
As already quoted there, we refer to Sect. 15.1 for more on such substitution of X

Example 14.15 Given f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈K[X] and α ∈K, show
that the remainder upon division of f (X) by X −α is precisely f (α).

f (X) = (X −α)q(X) + f (α).
Since this is the same as having f (X) −f (α) = (X −α)q(X), we only need to
show that X −α divides f (X) −f (α). We do this by invoking the result of item (a)

Xk −αk = (X −α)(Xk−1 + αXk−2 + · · · + αk−2X + αk−1),

Chapter 15
Roots of Polynomials
In all we have done so far concerning polynomials, at no moment we had any intent
of substituting X by an element of K. Even in Theorem 14.10 and Example 14.15,
the notation f (z), used to denote the complex number obtained by formally
substituting X by z in the expression of f ∈C[X], was a mere convention. This
is no surprise, for we are looking at polynomials as formal expressions, rather than
as functions. In this sense, the indeterminate X is a symbol with no arithmetic
meaning, and we have even stressed before that we could have used the symbol □,
instead.
We remedy this state of things in this chapter, where we introduce the concept
of polynomial function associated to a polynomial, as well as that of root of
a polynomial. Among the various important results presented, we highlight the
presentation of a complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, as well
as the searching criterion for rational roots of polynomials with integer coefﬁcients,
along with several interesting applications.
15.1
Roots of Polynomials
In order to proceed with our study of polynomials, it is convenient to consider the
polynomial function associated to a polynomial, according to the following
Deﬁnition 15.1 For f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈K[X], the polynomial
function associated to f is the function ˜f : K →K, given for x ∈K by
˜f (x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0.

Roots of Polynomials
When f (X) = c, note that the associated polynomial function ˜f will be the constant
function ˜f (x) = c for every x ∈K, thus justifying the nomenclature constant
attributed to a polynomial which is either identically zero or of degree zero.
Deﬁnition 15.2 Let f ∈K[X] be a given polynomial, with associated polynomial
function ˜f : K →K. An element α ∈K is a root of f if ˜f (α) = 0.
For instance, if f (X) = X2 + 1 ∈C[X], it is easy to see that z = ±i are the
only roots of f in C. Indeed, the polynomial function associated to f is
˜f : C −→C
z −→z2 + 1 ,
so that
˜f (z) = 0 ⇔z2 = −1 ⇔z = ±i.
The coming proposition is known as the root test. Note that item (a) revisits
Example 14.15 in a slightly different way.
Proposition 15.3 If f ∈K[X] \ {0} and α ∈K, then:
(a) α is a root of f if and only if (X −α) | f (X) in K[X].
(b) If α is a root of f , then there exists a greatest natural number m such that
(X−α)m divides f . Moreover, writing f (X) = (X−α)mq(X), with q ∈K[X],
one has ˜q(α) ̸= 0, where ˜q : K →K stands for the polynomial function
associated to q.
(c) If α1, . . . , αk ∈K are pairwise distinct roots of f , then f (X) is divisible by
(X −α1) . . . (X −αk) in K[X].
Proof
(a) The division algorithm assures the existence of polynomials q, r ∈K[X] such
that
f (X) = (X −α)q(X) + r(X),
with r = 0 or 0 ≤∂r < ∂(X−α) = 1. Hence, r(X) = c, a constant polynomial.
On the other hand, letting ˜f and ˜q be the polynomial functions respectively
associated to f and q, it follows from the equality above that
˜f (α) = (α −α)˜q(α) + c = c,

15.1
Roots of Polynomials

i.e., f (X) = (X −α)q(X) + ˜f (α). Thus,
α is a root of f ⇔˜f (α) = 0 ⇔f (X) = (X −α)q(X).
(b) If m > ∂f , then (X −α)m ∤f (X), for ∂(X −α)m = m > ∂f . Therefore, item
(a) guarantees the existence of a greatest positive integer m for which (X−α)m |
f (X), say f (X) = (X −α)mq(X), with q ∈K[X]. In the level of polynomial
functions, we thus obtain
˜f (x) = (x −α)m ˜q(x), ∀x ∈K.
Now, if ˜q(α) = 0, it would follow from (a) that q(X) = (X −α)q1(X), for
some q1 ∈K[X]. However, we would then have
f (X) = (X −α)m+1q1(X),
a contradiction to the maximality of m.
(c) For the sake of simplicity, let us establish the result of this item for k = 2 (the
proof in the general case following by a straightforward inductive argument).
Since α1 is a root of f , item (a) once more assures the existence of g ∈K[X]
such that f (X) = (X −α1)g(X). Let ˜g denote the corresponding polynomial
function. Since α1 ̸= α2 and α2 is also a root of f , the last equality above gives
0 = ˜f (α2) = (α2 −α1) ˜g(α2),
so that α2 is also a root of g. Thus, by applying (a) yet another time, we conclude
that there exists h ∈K[X] for which g(X) = (X −α2)h(X). In turn, this gives
f (X) = (X −α1)(X −α2)h(X).
⊓⊔
The coming example is an interesting application of the root test.
Example 15.4 (Soviet Union) Label the rows and columns of an n × n chessboard
from 1 to n, respectively from top to bottom and from left to right. Given 2n real
numbers a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn, with b1, . . . , bn being pairwise distinct, write ai +bj
inside the unit square situated in row i and column j, for 1 ≤i, j ≤n. If the
products of the numbers written in the unit squares of each column of the chessboard
are all equal, prove that the products of the numbers written in the unit squares of
each row are all equal too.

366
15
Roots of Polynomials
Proof Consider the polynomial
f (X) = (X + a1)(X + a2) . . . (X + an) ∈R[X].
Letting ˜f be the polynomial function associated to f , it follows from the statement
of the problem the existence of α ∈R such that ˜f (b1) = ˜f (b2) = . . . = ˜f (bn) = α.
Then, ˜f (bi) −α = 0 for 1 ≤i ≤n and, since b1, . . . , bn are pairwise distinct, item
(c) of the root test gives
f (X) −α = (X −b1)(X −b2) . . . (X −bn)
(note that both f (X) −α and the polynomial at the right hand side of the equality
above are monic and have degree n). Hence,
−α = f (−ai) −α = (−1)n(ai + b1)(ai + b2) . . . (ai + bn),
and this is the same as saying that the products of the numbers written in the unit
squares of each row are all equal to (−1)n−1α.
⊓⊔
As a consequence of the root test, we now describe a rather simple algorithm for
ﬁnding the quotient of the division of a monic polynomial f ∈K[X] by X−α, with
α ∈K being a root of f . Such an algorithm is known in mathematical literature as
the Horner-Ruﬁnni algorithm,1 and is based on the following homonymous result.
Proposition 15.5 (Horner-Ruﬁnni) Let
f (X) = Xn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0
be a monic polynomial on K. If α ∈K is a root of f and
g(X) = Xn−1 + bn−2Xn−2 + · · · + b0 ∈K[X]
is the quotient upon dividing f (X) by X −α, then

which, in turn, is readily seen to be equivalent to the equalities in (15.1) (note that
the last equation of the system can be neglected, for it only represents the necessary
compatibility condition for α to be a root of f ).
⊓⊔
The table below, which can be seen as the actual execution of Horner-Rufﬁni’s
algorithm, resumes the above discussion. Note that we put all of coefﬁcients of f
but the leading one (which equals 1) along the ﬁrst row; then, in the second row
we successively compute, from left to right, the coefﬁcients of g, starting with the

equal to the product of the previously computed coefﬁcient (i.e., the one at its left)
by α, added to the coefﬁcient of f situated right above this one.

The coming example shows the Horner-Rufﬁni algorithm in action. It also shows
that the algorithm can be used to check whether some given element of K is actually
a root of a given polynomial in K[X].
Example 15.6 Check that

Solution We begin assembling the numerical table corresponding to Horner-

a1 = −6, a0 = 30 along the ﬁrst row:
−5 1 −5 −6 30

⊓⊔
Back to the development of the theory and in the notations of the root test, if
f (X) = (X −α)mq(X), with ˜q(α) ̸= 0, we say that m is the multiplicity of α as a
root of f . In particular, α is a simple root of f if m = 1, and a multiple root of f
if m > 1.
Example 15.7 Let f (X) = X3 −7X2 + 16X −12 be a polynomial with real
coefﬁcients. It is immediate to check that f (X) = (X −2)2(X −3). Therefore,
2 is a double root, whereas 3 is a simple one.

15.1
Roots of Polynomials

Later in this chapter we shall study in detail the problem of ﬁnding whether a
given polynomial f ∈K[X] has multiple roots. For the time being, we only need
to know what such a root is. Nevertheless, we shall observe that we already have a
way of deciding whether an element α ∈K is a multiple root of f ∈K[X] \ {0}:
it sufﬁces to check if f (α) = 0 and, if this is so, to divide f (X) by (X −α)2
(which can be done by means of two successive applications of Horner-Ruﬁnni’s
algorithm), verifying whether or not such a division is exact. We shall have more to
say about this in a while.
Another interesting consequence of the division algorithm is the fact, due to
Lagrange, that the number of roots of a nonzero polynomial cannot exceed its
degree. In the coming result, note that we allow multiple roots.
Corollary 15.8 (Lagrange) If f ∈K[X] \ {0}, then f has at most ∂f roots in K,
counted according to their multiplicities.
Proof Let us make induction on the degree of f . If ∂f = 0, then there exists c ∈
K \ {0} such that f (X) = c. Hence, the polynomial function ˜f associated to f is
the constant function x →c, so that f has 0 = ∂f roots.
Now, let f be a polynomial of positive degree, and assume that the result is
true for every polynomial in K[X] \ {0} whose degree is less than that of f . If f
has no roots in K, there is nothing left to do. Otherwise, let α ∈K be a root of
f and (according to the root test) let m be the greatest natural number such that
f (X) = (X −α)mq(X), for some q ∈K[X] such that ˜q(α) ̸= 0. Since
∂q = ∂f −m < ∂f,
the induction hypothesis assures that q has at most ∂q roots in K, counted with their
multiplicities.
In order to ﬁnish the argument, note that if β ̸= α is a root of f , then
0 = ˜f (β) = (β −α)m ˜q(β)
and, hence, β is a root of q. Therefore, the number of roots of f (with multiplicities)
equals m (the multiplicity of α) plus that of q. Thus, the induction hypothesis shows
that f has at most
m + ∂q = ∂f
roots in K.
⊓⊔
The previous corollary will be frequently used in one of the two forms below.
Corollary 15.9 If f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈K[X] admits at least n + 1
distinct roots in K, then f vanishes identically, i.e., an = . . . = a0 = 0.

370
15
Roots of Polynomials
Proof If f ∈K[X] \ {0}, then the former corollary assures it has at most n roots
in K.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.10 Let f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 and g(X) = bmXm + · · · +
b1X + b0 be polynomials in K[X], with m ≥n. If ˜f (x) = ˜g(x) for at least m + 1
distinct values of x ∈K, then f = g, i.e, m = n and ai = bi for 0 ≤i ≤n.
Proof It sufﬁces to apply the previous corollary to the polynomial f −g, noticing
that the associated polynomial function is ˜f −˜g.
⊓⊔
If FK stands for the set of functions from K to itself, then, since K is inﬁnite, the
last result above guarantees that the mapping
K[X] −→FK
f
−→˜f
,
(15.2)
that associates to each f ∈K[X] its polynomial function ˜f ∈FK, is injective. In
other words, it says that two polynomials on K will have equal polynomial functions
if they are themselves equal polynomials.2 Indeed, if f, g ∈K[X] are such that
˜f = ˜g, then ˜f (x) = ˜g(x) for inﬁnitely many values of x, and the previous corollary
assures that f = g.
Thanks to the injectivity of the above map, from now one we shall write f to
denote both an element of K[X] (i.e., a polynomial with coefﬁcients in K) as its
associated polynomial function. In particular, whenever we write f (X), we shall
be referring ourselves to the polynomial f ; whenever we write f (x), we shall be
looking at the element of K, image of x ∈K through the polynomial function
associated to f . Moreover, the context will always clear any possible doubts on this
point.
Remark 15.11 Corollary 15.10 assures that, thanks to the fact that K is inﬁnite, the
coefﬁcients of f ∈K[X] are completely determined by the values f (x), with x ∈
K. Later, in Chap. 18, we shall study in detail the problem of getting a polynomial
in K[X] that assumes prescribed values at prescribed elements of K.
The two coming examples illustrate typical uses of Corollaries 15.9 and 15.10.
Example 15.12 (Moldavia) Find all polynomials f ∈R[X] such that f (0) = 0 and
f (x2 + 1) = f (x)2 + 1, ∀x ∈R.
2As we shall see in Sect. 19.3, upon studying polynomials over Zp, for some prime number p, the
fact that K is inﬁnite here is actually indispensable for the injectivity of (15.2).

Solution Let the sequence (un)n≥0 be deﬁned by u0 = 0 and un+1 = u2
n + 1, for
n ≥1. If g(X) = X, then f (u0) = 0 = g(u0) and, by assuming f (uk) = g(uk),
we get
f (uk+1) = f (u2
k + 1) = f (uk)2 + 1
= g(uk)2 + 1 = u2
k + 1 = g(uk+1).
Therefore, we conclude by induction that f (un) = g(un) for every nonnegative
integer n. However, since the values of the terms un are pairwise distinct, we
conclude that f (x) and g(x) coincide for an inﬁnite number of distinct values of
x. It thus follows from Corollary 15.10 that f = g, i.e., f (X) = X.
⊓⊔
Example 15.13 (Hong Kong) Let g(X) = X5 + X4 + X3 + X2 + X + 1. Compute
the remainder of the division of g(X12) by g(X).
Solution The division algorithm assures the existence of q, r ∈R[X] such that
g(X12) = g(X)q(X) + r(X),
with r = 0 or 0 ≤∂r ≤4. Letting ω = cis 2π
6 and taking x = ωk in the
corresponding polynomial functions, with 1 ≤k ≤5, we obtain
g(ω12k) = g(ωk)q(ωk) + r(ωk)
(15.3)
for 1 ≤k ≤5.
Now, since ω12k = cis (4kπ) = 1, we get g(ω12k) = g(1) = 6. On the other
hand, for 1 ≤k ≤5, Lemma 13.18 furnishes
g(ωk) = ω5k + ω4k + ω3k + ω2k + ωk + 1 = ω6k −1
ωk −1 = 0.
Thus, (15.3) reduces to r(ωk) = 6 for 1 ≤k ≤5, so that the polynomial r −6 has
at least ﬁve distinct roots. However, since r −6 = 0 or ∂(r −6) ≤4, Corollary 15.8
gives r −6 = 0.
⊓⊔
The coming further consequence of Lagrange’s theorem (Corollary 15.8) guar-
antees that the image of the polynomial function associated to a nonconstant
polynomial on K is an inﬁnite set.
Corollary 15.14 If f ∈K[X]\K, then the image Im (f ) of the polynomial function
associated to f is an inﬁnite subset of K.
Proof Assume the contrary, i.e., that Im (f ) = {α1, . . . , αk} ⊂K. Then, for every
x ∈K we have f (x) ∈{α1, . . . , αk}. However, since K is an inﬁnite set, there exists
1 ≤i ≤k and pairwise distinct elements x1, x2, . . . ∈K such that
f (x1) = f (x2) = . . . = αi.

372

Roots of Polynomials
Hence, f (X) −αi is a nonvanishing polynomial (for f is nonconstant) with an
inﬁnite number of distinct roots, which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Example 15.15 (Canada) Find all nonconstant polynomials f ∈Q[X] such that
f (f (X)) = f (X)k for some given natural number k.
Solution It is easy to see (cf. Problem 1) that for every x ∈Q we have f (f (x)) =
f (x)k. Yet in another way, we have f (y) = yk for every y ∈Im (f ). Now, the
previous result assures that Im (f ) is an inﬁnite subset of Q, so that Corollary 15.10
gives f (X) = Xk.

Rational Roots of Polynomials in Z[X]
This short section studies the problem of ﬁnding rational roots of polynomials
with integer coefﬁcients, presenting several interesting applications. Item (a) of
the coming proposition brings the central result, which is known in mathematical
literature as the rational roots test for polynomials with integer coefﬁcients.
Proposition 15.16 Let n > 1 be an integer, f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 be
a nonzero polynomial with integer coefﬁcients and p and q be nonzero, relatively
prime integers. If f
 p
q

= 0, then:
(a) p | a0 and q | an.
(b) If f is monic, then the possible rational roots of f are integers.
(c) (p −mq) | f (m) for every m ∈Z. In particular, (p −q) | f (1) and (p + q) |
f (−1).

374
15
Roots of Polynomials
Proof
(a) Starting from f ( p
q ) = 0, we readily obtain
anpn + an−1pn−1q + · · · + a1pqn−1 + a0qn = 0
and, hence,
a0qn = p(−anpn−1 −· · · −a1qn−1)
anpn = q(−an−1pn−1 −· · · −a0qn−1) .
Therefore, p | a0qn and q | anpn. However, since p and q are relatively prime,
item (a) of Proposition 6.22 assures that p | a0 and q | an, as we wished to
show.
(b) This follows immediately from (a).
(c) Since f
 p
q

= 0, we have f (m) = f (m) −f ( p
q ) or, which is the same,
f (m) = (anmn + · · · + a1m + a0) −1
qn (anpn + · · · + a1pqn−1 + a0qn).
Hence,
qnf (m) = qn(anmn + · · · + a1m + a0) −(anpn + · · · + a1pqn−1 + a0qn)
= an((mq)n −pn) + · · · + a1qn−1(mq −p)
= (mq −p)r
for some r ∈Z, where we used item (a) of Example 6.3 in the last equality. The
above computations show that (mq −p) | qnf (m). Thus, in order to conclude
that (mq −p) | f (m), it sufﬁces to show (again by item (a) of Proposition 6.22)
that gcd(mq −p, qn) = 1. To this end, by successively applying item (b) of that
result, together with Corollary 6.23, we get
gcd(p, q) = 1 ⇒gcd(mq −p, q) = 1 ⇒gcd(mq −p, qn) = 1.
The rest follows at once.
⊓⊔
The previous result can sometimes be applied to establish the irrationality of
certain real numbers. We shall now see a couple of examples in this direction.

polynomial with integer coefﬁcients
f (X) = ((X2 −2)2 −2)2 −2
= (X4 −4X2 + 2)2 −2.
Thus, if α ∈Q, items (a) and (b) or the former proposition assure that α ∈N and
α | f (0) = 2, so that α = 1 ou 2. However, since

Roots of Polynomials
Hence, tan 10◦is a root of the polynomial with integer coefﬁcients f (X) =
3X6 −27X4 +33X2 −1, and it sufﬁces to show that it does not possess any rational
roots. For what is left to do, ﬁrst note that, by Proposition 15.16, the possible rational
roots of f are ±1 or ± 1
3; nevertheless, direct computations show that f (±1) and
f (± 1
3) are all nonzero, as wished.

Example 15.19 (Yugoslavia) Find all positive rationals a ≤b ≤c for which all of
the numbers
a + b + c, 1
a + 1

are integers.
Solution Letting f (X) = (X −a)(X −b)(X −c), we conclude that a, b and c are
the roots of f ; moreover, they are all rational. On the other hand,

It thus follows that f ∈Z[X]. However, since f is monic, the rational roots test
applied to f assures that all of a, b, c must be integers.
Finally, since a, b and c are positive, we conclude that it sufﬁces to ﬁnd all
natural numbers a ≤b ≤c for which 1

c is also natural. In order to solve
this problem, start by noticing that

so that a ≤3. Then, by separately considering the cases a = 1, 2 or 3 and iterating
the above reasoning, one easily ﬁnds
(a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 6) or (3, 3, 3).

Rational Roots of Polynomials in Z[X]
377
We ﬁnish this section by presenting an interesting application of item (b) of
Proposition 15.16. More precisely we shall characterize all rational numbers α for
which cos(απ) is also rational. To this end, we ﬁrst need to introduce a special class
of polynomials.
Let (fn)n≥1 be the sequence of polynomials with real coefﬁcients given by
f1(X) = X, f2(X) = X2 −2 and, for an integer k ≥1,
fk+2(X) = Xfk+1(X) −fk(X).
(15.4)
The polynomial fn is called the n-th Bernstein polynomial, after the Russian
mathematician of the twentieth century Sergei N. Bernstein. The next proposition
unfolds some of its properties.
Proposition 15.20 If (fn)n≥1 is the sequence of Bernstein’s polynomials, then:
(a) fn(2 cos θ) = 2 cos(nθ), for every θ ∈R.
(b) fn is monic, has integer coefﬁcients and degree n.
Proof For item (a), it is obvious that f1(2 cos θ) = 2 cos θ, whereas the formula for
cos(2θ) in terms of cos θ gives
f2(2 cos θ) = (2 cos θ)2 −2 = 2(2 cos2 θ −1) = 2 cos(2θ).
Now, let k
≥1 be an integer and assume, by induction hypothesis, that
fj(2 cos θ) = 2 cos(jθ) for 1 ≤j ≤k + 1 and every θ ∈R. The product formula
cos α + cos β = 2 cos
 α+β
2

cos
 α−β
2

gives
2 cos θ · 2 cos(k + 1)θ −2 cos(kθ) = 2 cos(k + 2)θ.
Therefore, it follows from (15.4) and the induction hypothesis that
fk+2(2 cos θ) = 2 cos θ · fk+1(2 cos θ) −fk(2 cos θ)
= 2 cos θ · 2 cos(k + 1)θ −2 cos(kθ)
= 2 cos(k + 2)θ
for every θ ∈R.
Item (b) is trivially true for f1 and f2. Arguing once more by induction, if fk
and fk+1 are monic, with integer coefﬁcients and degrees k and k + 1, respectively,
then the recurrence relation (15.4) readily assures that the same properties hold for
fk+2.
⊓⊔
We are ﬁnally in position to present the promised result.

2p

15.3
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
As a particular case of Corollary 15.9, every polynomial of complex coefﬁcients and
degree n has at most n complex roots. On the other hand, the polynomial f (X) =
X2 −2 ∈Q[X] has rational coefﬁcients but does not admit any rational roots;
accordingly, g(X) = X2 + 1 ∈R[X] has real coefﬁcients but no real roots. In
both cases, the fact that such polynomials do not admit roots in Q or R is due to
deﬁciencies of such number sets, in the sense that, in them, one cannot perform
certain root extractions.
On the other hand, Bhaskara’s formula shows (cf. Problem 1) that every second
degree polynomial with complex coefﬁcients has two (possibly equal complex
roots), and the coming example looks at the third degree case. The reasoning
presented below is essentially the one developed by the Italian mathematicians of
the sixteenth century Scipioni del Ferro, Gerolamo Cardano and Niccolò Fontana,
known as Tartaglia (in this respect, see also Problem 2).
Example 15.22 A third degree polynomial f (X) = a3X3 + a2X2 + a1X + a0 with
complex coefﬁcients has a complex root.
Proof We can obviously assume that a3 = 1. Also, for a given α ∈C, we have that
z ∈C is a root of f (X) if and only if z −α is a root of f (X + α); since
f (X + α) = (X + α)3 + a2(X + α)2 + a1(X + α) + a0
= X3 + (3α + a2)X2 + (3α2 + 2a2α + a1)X + f (α),

380
15
Roots of Polynomials
by choosing α = −a2
3 we can assume further that a2 = 0.
We are thus left to showing that a third degree polynomial f (X) = X3 +aX+b,
with a, b ∈C, has complex roots. To this end, we substitute z = u + v to get
f (z) = (u + v)3 + a(u + v) + b
= u3 + v3 + 3uv(u + v) + a(u + v) + b
= (u3 + v3 + b) + 3(u + v)(uv + a).
Since we are trying to ﬁnd some complex root for f , we try to impose that u3+v3 =
−b and uv = −a, thus getting the system of equations
u3 + v3 = −b
uv = −a
.
In turn, such a system can easily be solved, for u3 and v3 are the roots of the second
degree equation X2 + bX −a3 = 0
⊓⊔
At this point, we could turn to fourth degree polynomials with complex coefﬁ-
cients and, by performing even trickier computations, show that they have complex
roots too. Instead, we turn to the general case, which was settled by Gauss in his
doctor thesis, in 1799 (nevertheless, see Problem 3 and the subsequent paragraph).
This is the content of the coming result, which is know in mathematical literature as
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (we abbreviate FTA). The proof we present
is due to the French mathematician of the eighteenth century J-B. le R. d’Alembert.
Theorem 15.23 (Gauss)
Every polynomial f ∈C[X]\C has at least one complex
root.
Proof By the sake of notation, write f (z) = anzn + · · · + a1z + a0 to denote the
polynomial function associated to f . Without any loss of generality, we can assume
that a0 ̸= 0.
For z ̸= 0, the triangle inequality for complex numbers (cf. Problem 3, page 326)
gives

we have |an−k|

|f (z)| > |z|n

However, since |z| >
n;
2n|a0|
|an| , we have |an||z|n > 2n|a0| and, hence, |f (z)| >
n|a0| ≥|a0|.
In short, letting R denote the right hand side of (15.5), we get
|z| > R ⇒|f (z)| > |a0| = |f (0)|.
Now, in Sect. 21.2 we will show (cf. Corollary 21.21) that there exists z0 ∈C such
that |z0| ≤R and
|f (z0)| = min{|f (z)|; z ∈C, |z| ≤R}.
Hence, what we did above assures that
|f (z0)| = min{|f (z)|; z ∈C}.
By contradiction, let us suppose that f (z0) ̸= 0, and show that there exists h ∈C
for which |f (z0 + h)| < |f (z0)|. To this end, we start by noticing that there exist
complex numbers c0, c1, . . . , cn, independent of h and such that
f (z0 + h) = a0 + a1(z0 + h) + · · · + an(z0 + h)n
= c0 + c1h + · · · + cnhn;
moreover, c0 = f (z0) ̸= 0 and cn = an ̸= 0. Take the least 1 ≤k ≤n such that
ck ̸= 0. Then, letting dj = cj
c0 for 0 ≤j ≤n, we obtain
|f (z0 + h)|
|f (z0)|
= |1 + dkhk + dk+1hk+1 + · · · + dnhn|

Now, estimates analogous to those we did with the aid of (15.5) allow us to choose
r > 0 such that |h| ≤r ⇒
			 dk+1
dk h + · · · + dn
dk hn−k			 < 1
2. Then,
|h| ≤r ⇒|f (z0 + h)|

Let dk = s cis α and h = r cis θ. The ﬁrst de Moivre formula gives us
|f (z0 + h)|
|f (z0)|
≤|1 + srk cis (α + kθ)| + 1
2srk;
therefore, choosing θ ∈R in such a way that α + kθ = π (i.e., taking θ = π−α
k ),
we get
|f (z0 + h)|
|f (z0)|
≤|1 + srk cis π| + 1

whenever srk < 1, i.e., 0 < r <

h), we have |f (z0 + h)| < |f (z0)|.
⊓⊔
An immediate consequence of the FTA is collected in the coming
Corollary 15.24 If f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 is a polynomial with complex
coefﬁcients and degree n ≥1, then there exist complex numbers z1, . . . , zn such
that
f (X) = an(X −z1) . . . (X −zn).
(15.6)
The right hand side above is the factorised form of f .
Proof We prove the corollary by induction on n, the case n = 1 being immediate.
Take an integer n > 1, and assume that the corollary is valid for every polynomial
with complex coefﬁcients and degree n −1.
If z1 ∈C is a root of f (whose existence is guaranteed by the FTA), the root
test assures the existence of a polynomial g with complex coefﬁcients, such that
f (X) = (X −z1)g(X). Note that g has degree n −1 and leading coefﬁcient an;
hence, by induction hypothesis, there exist z2, . . . , zn ∈C such that g(X) = an(X−
z2) . . . (X −zn). Therefore,
f (X) = (X −z1)g(X) = an(X −z1)(X −z2) . . . (X −zn)
and there is nothing left to do.
⊓⊔
A useful variation of the previous corollary is the one given by the next result.
Corollary 15.25 If f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 is a polynomial with complex
coefﬁcients and degree n ≥1, then, given α ∈C, there exist z1, . . . , zn ∈C such
that f (zk) = α for 1 ≤k ≤n.

15.3
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
383
Proof Apply the former corollary to g(X) = f (X) −α.
⊓⊔
Back to the general case, let f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 be a nonzero
polynomial with coefﬁcients in K. If there exist elements α1, . . . , αn ∈K for which
f (X) = an(X −α1) . . . (X −αn),
we shall also say that the expression at the right hand side is the factorised form of
f over K.
Since some of the αj’s may appear several times in the factorised form, if we
look only at the distinct ones we conclude, possibly after renumbering them, that
there exist 1 ≤m ≤n and positive integers k1, . . . , km such that
f (X) = an(X −α1)k1 · · · (X −αm)km,
with k1 + · · · + km = n and α1, . . . , αm pairwise distinct elements of K.
The two coming examples give interesting applications of the factorised form of
polynomials.
Example 15.26 Given a natural number n > 1, do the following items:
(a) Obtain the factorised form of f (X) = Xn−1 + Xn−2 + · · · + X + 1.
(b) Let A1A2 . . . An be a regular polygon with n sides, inscribed in a circle with
radius 1. Compute the value of A1A2 · A1A3 · . . . · A1An.
Solution
(a) Since
(X −1)f (X) = (X −1)(Xn−1 + Xn−2 + · · · + X + 1) = Xn −1,
the complex roots of f are precisely the n-th roots of unity distinct from 1.
By (13.19), such roots are the complex numbers ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1, with ω =
cis 2π
n . Therefore, the factorised form of f is
f (X) = (X −ω)(X −ω2) . . . (X −ωn−1).
(15.7)
(b) Assume, without any loss of generality, that the circle of radius 1 circumscribing
A1A2 . . . An is the unit circle centered at the origin of the complex plane, as well
as that A1 = 1 and A2 = ω, with ω = cis 2π
n . Then, Aj = ωj−1 for 1 ≤j ≤n,
so that
A1A2 · A1A3 · . . . · A1An = |1 −ω||1 −ω2| . . . |1 −ωn−1|
= |(1 −ω)(1 −ω2) . . . (1 −ωn−1)|
= |f (1)| = n.

(d) Show, without resorting to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, that the
given fourth degree polynomial has a complex root.
The reader who went through Example 15.22 may have noticed that we
reduced the task of ﬁnding a complex root for a third degree polynomial to
that of ﬁnding a complex root for an associated second degree polynomial;
subsequently, in the problem above we reduced the task of ﬁnding a complex
root for a fourth degree polynomial to that of ﬁnding a complex root for an
associated third degree polynomial. One is thus naturally tempted to guess
whether it would be possible to extend such a recursive reasoning, thus reducing
the task of ﬁnding a complex root for a general polynomial of degree n > 1
to that of ﬁnding a complex root for an appropriately associated polynomial
of degree n −1. Attempts to implement such a strategy were unsuccessfully
pursued by several mathematicians along the sixteenth, seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries, until a general consensus started to form around the idea that
this would perhaps not be possible. Actually, in the dawn of the nineteenth
century, the Norwegian mathematician Niels H. Abel proved that there is no
general formula for ﬁnding the roots of a ﬁfth degree polynomial in terms of
their coefﬁcients; a few years later, the French mathematician Évariste Galois
extended such a result for all polynomial of degree n ≥5, obtaining the
ﬁrst major achievement of what is known today as Galois Theory. A gentle
introduction to the involved ideas, with complete proofs, is the object of the
marvelous book [20].

Multiple Roots
In this section, given f ∈C[X] \ C and z ∈C, we derive a useful necessary
condition to be satisﬁed for z to be a multiple root of f . To this end, it is convenient
to make the convention of saying that z ∈C a root of f of multiplicity zero if z is
actually not a root of f . We shall also need the coming
Deﬁnition 15.28 Given a polynomial f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈C[X], we
deﬁne its derivative4 f ′ ∈C[X] of f as the polynomial
f ′(X) = nanXn−1 + (n −1)an−2Xn−2 + · · · + 2a2X + a1
if ∂f > 0. Otherwise, we let f ′ = 0.
The rule for getting the derivative of a polynomial is rather simple: the derivative
of a constant polynomial is the identically zero one, whereas the derivative of a
polynomial of degree n ≥1 is obtained by erasing its constant term and performing,
for 1 ≤k ≤n, the monomial exchange
akXk →kakXk−1.
The coming proposition establishes the main properties of derivatives of polyno-
mials.
Proposition 15.29 For f1, . . . , fk ∈C[X] and a1, . . . , ak ∈C, we have:

(a) This item follows immediately by induction on k ≥1. Note that the initial cases
are k = 1 and k = 2.
(b) Firstly, let
f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 and g(X) = bmXm + · · · + b1X + b0.
4The reader acquainted with Calculus has certainly noticed that the deﬁnition of f ′ matches the
one presented in Calculus courses by computing limits of Newton’s quotients. The point of the
present deﬁnition and the subsequent proposition is that they will equally apply to polynomials
over Zp, in Chap. 19.

induction.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.30 Given g ∈C[X] and n ∈N, if f (X) = g(X)n then f ′(X) =
ng(X)n−1g′(X). In particular, if f (X) = (X −a)n, then f ′(X) = n(X −a)n−1.

we obtain
f ′(X) =
n

i=1
g(X)n−1g′(X) = ng(X)n−1g′(X).
The particular case follows from this formula, letting g(X) = X −a.
⊓⊔
The coming result relates the multiplicity of a root of a polynomial to its
derivative.
Proposition 15.31 Let f ∈C[X] \ {0} and z ∈C.
(a) If z is a root of multiplicity m ≥1 of f , then z is a root of multiplicity m −1 of
f ′.
(b) If z is a root of f and is a root of multiplicity m −1 of f ′, then z is a root of
multiplicity m of f .
Proof
(a) The root test allows us to write f (X) = (X −z)mg(X), with g(z) ̸= 0. On the
other hand, item (b) of the previous proposition, together with its corollary, give
f ′(X) = m(X −z)m−1g(X) + (X −z)mg′(X)
= (X −z)m−1[mg(X) + (X −z)g′(X)].
Hence, letting h(X) = mg(X)+(X −z)g′(X), we have h(z) = mg(z) ̸= 0 and
f ′(X) = (X −z)m−1h(X). By the very deﬁnition of multiplicity, we conclude
that z is a root of f ′ of multiplicity m −1.
(b) Again by the root test, we can write f (X) = (X −z)kg(X), for some integer
k ≥1 and g ∈C[X] such that g(z) ̸= 0. Then, item (a) assures that the
multiplicity of α as a root of f ′ is k −1, so that k −1 = m −1 and, hence,
k = m.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.32 If z ∈C and f ∈C[X] \ {0}, then z is a multiple root of f if and
only if f (z) = f ′(z) = 0.
Proof If z is a multiple root of f , this means that it is a root of f with multiplicity
is at least 2. Therefore, item (a) of the previous proposition implies that z is a root
of f ′.
Conversely, if z is a root of both f and f ′, then item (b) of the previous
proposition shows that the multiplicity of z as a root of f is at least 2. In turn,
this is the same as saying that z is a multiple root of f .

Roots of Polynomials
Example 15.33 (Sweden) Prove that, for every n ∈N, the polynomial
1 + X + 1
2!X2 + · · · + 1
n!Xn
has no multiple roots.
Proof Let f (X) = 1 + X + 1
2!X2 + · · · + 1
n!Xn, and assume that it has a multiple
root z. Then, by the former corollary we have f (z) = f ′(z) = 0. Now, since
f (X) = f ′(X) + 1
n!Xn, it would follow that
0 = f (z) = f ′(z) + zn
n! ,
i.e., z = 0. However, since f (0) = 1 ̸= 0, we have reached a contradiction.
⊓⊔
In order to reﬁne the conclusion of the previous corollary, we ﬁrst need to
generalize Deﬁnition 15.28. We do this now.
Deﬁnition 15.34 For f ∈C[X] \ {0}, we deﬁne the k-th derivative of f , denoted
f (k), by
f (k) =
f,
if k = 0

f (k−1)′ , if k ≥1 .
It readily follows from this deﬁnition that f (1) = (f (0))′ = f ′; thus, f (2) =
(f (1))′ = (f ′)′, so that we denote f (2) = f ′′. Accordingly, whenever convenient
we write f (3) = f ′′′ etc.
If ∂f = n and 0 ≤k ≤n, an easy induction guarantees that ∂f (k) ≤n −k; in
particular, ∂f (n) = 0 and, hence, f (n+1) = f (n+2) = · · · = 0.
Corollary 15.35 If z ∈C and f ∈C[X]\{0}, then z is a root of multiplicity m ≥1
of f if and only if
f (z) = . . . = f (m−1)(z) = 0 and f (m)(z) ̸= 0.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that z is a root of multiplicity m of f . Several applications of
item (a) of Proposition 15.31 give us, on the one hand,
f (z) = · · · = f (m−1)(z) = 0
and, on the other, that z is a root of multiplicity zero of f (m), i.e., that f (m)(z) ̸= 0.
Conversely, assume that the stated condition holds and let k ∈N and g ∈C[X]
be such that f (X) = (X −z)kg(X), with g(z) ̸= 0. A straightforward inductive

15.4
Multiple Roots
391
argument (using again item (a) of Proposition 15.31) assures that z is a root of
multiplicity k −j of f (j), for 0 ≤j ≤k. In particular,
f (z) = . . . = f (k−1)(z) = 0 and f (k)(z) ̸= 0.
Now
f (z) = . . . = f (m−1)(z) = 0 ⇒k ≥m
and
f (m)(z) ̸= 0 ⇒k ≤m.
⊓⊔
In the rest of this section, our purpose is to show that, if f ∈C[X] \ {0} has
degree n and z ∈C, then f is completely determined by the values f (k)(z), for
0 ≤k ≤n. However, before we can do that, we need two further consequences of
Proposition 15.31.
Corollary 15.36 Let f ∈C[X] be such that f = 0 or ∂f ≤n. If z ∈C satisﬁes
f (z) = · · · = f (n)(z) = 0, then f = 0.
Proof If f ̸= 0, then the previous corollary, together with the stated conditions,
assure that the multiplicity of z as a root of f is at least n + 1. However, this would
imply that (X−z)n+1 would divide f , which in turn contradicts the fact that ∂f ≤n.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.37 Let f, g ∈C[X] \ {0}, with ∂f, ∂g ≤n. If there exists z ∈C such
that
f (z) = g(z), . . . , f (n)(z) = g(n)(z),
then f = g.
Proof An easy induction on k ≥1, with the help of Deﬁnition 15.34 and item (a)
of Proposition 15.29, assures that
(f −g)(k)(X) = f (k)(X) −g(k)(X),
for every integer k ≥0. In particular, the stated conditions give
(f −g)(k)(z) = f (k)(z) −g(k)(z) = 0,
for 0 ≤k ≤n.
Finally, since f −g = 0 or ∂(f −g) ≤max{∂f, ∂g} ≤n, the previous corollary,
applied to f −g, assures that such a polynomial vanishes identically.
⊓⊔

Roots of Polynomials
The coming result is known in mathematical literature as the Taylor formula5
for polynomials, and is a direct consequence of the last corollary above.
Theorem 15.38 If z ∈C and f ∈C[X] \ {0} is of degree n, then
f (X) = f (z) + f (1)(z)
1!
(X −z) + · · · + f (n)(z)
n!
(X −z)n.
(15.9)
Proof Let
g(X) = f (z) + f ′(z)
1!
(X −z) + · · · + f (n)(z)
n!
(X −z)n.
Since f ̸= 0, it follows from Corollary 15.36 that at least one of the numbers f (z),
f ′(z), . . . , f (n)(z) is nonzero; therefore, g ̸= 0. On the other hand, it is immediate
to check that, for 0 ≤k ≤n, we have
g(k)(X) =
n

j=k
f (j)(z)
(j −k)!(X −z)j−k
and, hence,
f (z) = g(z), f ′(z) = g′(z), . . . , f (n)(z) = g(n)(z).
However, since f and g both have degrees less than or equal to n, the previous
corollary assures that f = g.
⊓⊔
Example 15.39 Let f ∈R[X]\{0} and a ∈R be such that f (a) = 0 and f (k)(a) ≥
0 for every k ≥1. Prove that f has no roots along the interval (a, +∞).
Proof Letting n = ∂f , Taylor’s formula gives
f (X) = f ′(a)
1!
(X −a) + · · · + f (n)(a)
n!
(X −a)n.
Since f
̸= 0, at least one of the derivatives f (k)(a), say f (j)(a), is positive.
Obviously, 1 ≤j ≤n. Therefore, for a real number x > a, we have
f (x) = f ′(a)

Chapter 16
Relations Between Roots and Coefﬁcients
This chapter is devoted to the proof of some important relations between the
coefﬁcients of a polynomial and their complex roots; such results are generically
known as the relations between roots and coefﬁcients of a polynomial. We also
discuss an important theorem of Newton on symmetric polynomials, which will
reveal itself to be of central importance for the material of Chap. 20.
In all that follows, recall that K stands for Q, R or C.
16.1
Polynomials on Several Indeterminates
For a given n ∈N, a polynomial f in n indeterminates over K is a sum of
monomials of the form
ai1...inXi1
1 . . . Xinn ,
where ai1...in ∈K and i1, . . . , in vary in Z+, with ai1...in = 0 for almost every (i.e.,
for all but a ﬁnite number of) sequence (i1, . . . , in) of nonnegative integers. In this
case, we write
f = f (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) =

i1,...,in≥0
ai1...inXi1
1 . . . Xinn .
The degree of a polynomial f as above is the greatest possible value of the sum
i1 + · · · + in, such that ai1...in ̸= 0.
We let K[X1, . . . , Xn] denote the set of polynomials in n indeterminates over K.
On such a set we deﬁne, in an obvious way, operations
+ : K[X1, . . . , Xn] × K[X1, . . . , Xn] →K[X1, . . . , Xn]

respectively denoted addition and multiplication, which extend the homonymous
operations on K[X] and continue to be commutative, associative etc. For instance,

Given f

coefﬁcients in K[X1, . . . , *
Xi, . . . , Xn], where we have put the hat ∧over Xi to
indicate that all of the indeterminates, except for Xi, are present. For example, let
f (X1, X2, X3) = X3

3 −X3

1X2 · X4
3 + 10X1X5
2 · X2
3 −(X3
1 + 5X1X2),
we consider f as a polynomial in X3, with coefﬁcients in K[X1, X2].
If f, g ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] are given by
f (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) =

1 . . . Xinn
and
g(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) =

we say that f and g are equal provided ai1...in = bi1...in for all possible choices of
indices i1, . . . , in ∈Z+.
For ﬁxed x1, x2 . . . , xn ∈K, we write f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) to denote the element
of K given by
f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) =

i1,...,in

The coming proposition establishes an important relation between such elements of
K and the notion of equality of polynomials in several indeterminates.

Polynomials on Several Indeterminates

Proposition 16.1 Let f, g ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn]. If A1, . . . , An ⊂K are inﬁnite sets,
then
f = g ⇔f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = g(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
for all x1 ∈A1, x2 ∈A2, . . . , xn ∈An.
Proof If f = g, then it is clear that f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = g(x1, x2, . . . , xn) for all
x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈K and, in particular, for x1 ∈A1, x2 ∈A2, . . . , xn ∈An.
Conversely, suppose that this last condition is satisﬁed, and let us prove that
f = g by using induction on the number n of indeterminates. Corollary 15.10
already gives the validity of this claim for n = 1. Assume, by induction hypothesis,
that the result holds true for polynomials over K in n −1 indeterminates, and write

f (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = m
j=0 fj(X2, . . . , Xn)Xj
1
g(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = p
j=0 gj(X2, . . . , Xn)Xj

,
(16.1)
with fi, gj ∈K[X2, . . . , Xn] for all 0 ≤i ≤m, 0 ≤j ≤p.
For arbitrarily ﬁxed x2 ∈A2, . . . , xn ∈An, the hypothesis gives
f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = g(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
for all x1 ∈A1, i.e.,
m

j=0
fj(x2, . . . , xn)xj
1 =
p

j=0
gj(x2, . . . , xn)xj
1,
for all x1 ∈A1. Since A1 is an inﬁnite set, applying Corollary 15.10 to the
polynomials in X1
f (X1, x2, . . . , xn) =
m

j=0
fj(x2, . . . , xn)Xj
1
and
g(X1, x2, . . . , xn) =
p

j=0
gj(x2, . . . , xn)Xj
1,
we conclude that m = p and
fj(x2, . . . , xn) = gj(x2, . . . , xn)
(16.2)
for 0 ≤j ≤m. However, since x2 ∈A2, . . . , xn ∈An were arbitrarily chosen,
we conclude that (16.2) holds for all x2 ∈A2, . . . , xn ∈An. Hence, our induction
hypothesis guarantees that fj = gj for 0 ≤j ≤m, so that (16.1) gives f = g.

Relations Between Roots and Coefﬁcients
Remark 16.2 From now on, whenever we deal with polynomials f over K in
two indeterminates, we will generally write f (X, Y) instead of f (X1, X2). An
analogous remark holds for polynomials f over K in three indeterminates, which
will be generally denoted by f (X, Y, Z), instead of f (X1, X2, X3).
Example 16.3 Write (X + Y + Z)3 −(X3 + Y 3 + Z3) as a product of polynomials
of degree 1.

f (−y, y, z) = (−y + y + z)3 −((−y)3 + y3 + z3) = 0,
the root test assures that the polynomial (in X) f (X, y, z) is divisible by X−(−y) =
X + y. Analogously, f is also divisible by X + z and, since ∂g = 2, item (c) of
Proposition 15.3 guarantees that
f (X, y, z) = α(X + y)(X + z),
for some α ∈R to be found. By evaluating the equality above at 0, we obtain
αyz = f (0, y, z) = (y + z)3 −(y3 + z3) = 3yz(y + z),
so that α = 3(y + z). Therefore,
f (X, y, z) = 3(y + z)(X + y)(X + z)
and, then, f (x, y, z) = 3(y + z)(x + y)(x + z) for all x ∈R and y, z ∈R∗, with
y ̸= z. Proposition 16.1 now gives
f (X, Y, Z) = 3(Y + Z)(X + Y)(X + Z).

For what follows, given n ∈N we recall that In = {1, 2, . . . , n}; also, a function
σ : In →In is said to be a permutation of In if it is a bijection from In into itself.
The object of study along this section is isolated in the coming deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 16.4 A polynomial f ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] is symmetric if
f (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = f (Xσ(1), Xσ(2), . . . , Xσ(n)),
for every permutation σ of In.
For a better understanding of the above deﬁnition, let us look at the polynomials
f, g ∈K[X, Y] given by
f (X, Y) = X2 + Y 2 −XY + X + Y and g(X, Y) = X3 + Y 3 −X.
The ﬁrst is symmetric, whereas the second one is not, for
f (Y, X) = Y 2 + X2 −YX + Y + X = f (X, Y),
and
g(Y, X) = Y 3 + X3 −Y ̸= g(X, Y).
A particular set of symmetric polynomials, called elementary, deserves special
attention, and this is the object of the coming deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 16.5 For 0 ≤j ≤n, the j-th elementary symmetric polynomial in
X1, . . . , Xn, denoted sj = sj(X1, . . . , Xn), is deﬁned by
sj(X1, . . . , Xn) =


if j = 0

1≤i1<···<ij ≤n Xi1Xi2 . . . Xij , if 1 ≤j ≤n .
In the case n = 3, for example, we have
s0 = 1, s1 = X + Y + Z, s2 = XY + YZ + XZ, s3 = XYZ.
For an arbitrary natural number n, it is not difﬁcult to prove that sj is indeed
symmetric. On the other hand, the actual importance of the elementary symmetric
polynomials lies in the next proposition, which establishes Girard-Viète formulas1
between the coefﬁcients and roots of a given polynomial.

centuries, respectively.

Relations Between Roots and Coefﬁcients
Proposition 16.6 (Girard-Viète) Let f (X) = anXn +· · ·+a1X +a0 ∈K[X]\K
have roots α1, . . . , αn ∈K, repeated according to their multiplicities. For 1 ≤j ≤
n, one has
sj(α1, . . . , αn) = (−1)j an−j
an
.
(16.3)
Proof By the sake of simplicity, we shall write sj(αi) to denote sj(α1, . . . , αn).
According to our hypotheses, the factorised form of the polynomial f is f (X) =
an(X −α1)(X −α2) . . . (X −αn). Expanding the products, we obtain
f (X) = anXn −ans1(αi)Xn−1 + ans2(αi)Xn−2 −· · · + an(−1)nsn(αi).
It now sufﬁces to compare such an expression for f with that given in the
statement of the proposition to obtain
−ans1(αi) = an−1, ans2(αi) = an−2, . . . , an(−1)nsn(αi) = a0.
⊓⊔
In order to get the right feeling on what the previous proposition says and what
it does not say, let α, β and γ be the complex roots of the polynomial f (X) =
X3 −2X2 + 1. Girard-Viète relations give
α + β + γ = 2, αβ + αγ + βγ = 0 and αβγ = −1.
However, it is worth noticing that such relations do not bring enough information
for us to compute the values of α, β and γ ; indeed, if we try to solve the system of
equations formed by them, we will simply obtain the polynomial equations f (α) =
0, f (β) = 0 and f (γ ) = 0. Actually, by multiplying both sides of the second
equation by α, we get
α2(β + γ ) + αβγ = 0;
in turn, substituting β +γ by 2−α and αβγ by −1 in this last equality, we arrive at
α2(2 −α) −1 = 0.
In the notations of the former proposition, we shall refer to sj(α1, . . . , αn) ∈K
as the j-th elementary symmetric sum of the roots of f . Whenever α1, . . . , αn
are understood and there is no danger of confusion with the elementary symmetric
polynomial sj = sj(X1, . . . , Xn), we shall write simply sj to denote such a sum.
We now present a series of examples that illustrate a variety of different situations
to which one can proﬁtably apply Girard-Viète relations.

Example 16.7 Let f (X) = Xn + an−1Xn−1 + an−2Xn−2 + · · · + a1X + a0 be a
polynomial of real coefﬁcients, such that a2
n−1 < 2an−2. Prove that f has at least
two complex, nonreal roots.
Proof By contradiction, assume that a2
n−1 < 2an−2 but at least n −1 of the roots
of f are real, say α1, . . . , αn−1 ∈R. Since f and g(X) = (X −α1) . . . (X −αn−1)
have real coefﬁcients, we get from the division algorithm that
f (X) = g(X)(X −αn),
for some αn ∈R. Therefore, all roots of f are real.
Now, by applying Girard-Viète relations, we obtain

.
Proof If f (X) = (X −a)(X −b)(X −c), then condition a + b + c = 0 gives
f (X) = X3 + sX −t, with s = ab + ac + bc and t = abc. Now, since f (a) = 0,
we obtain a3 = −sa + t and, analogously, b3 = −sb + t and c3 = −sc + t. By
termwise addition of these relations and using condition a + b + c = 0 once more,
we get
a3 + b3 + c3 = −s(a + b + c) + 3t = 3t.
In order to deal with the sum a5 + b5 + c5, we start by multiplying both sides of
the equalities a3 = −sa + t, b3 = −sb + t and c3 = −sc + t respectively by a2,
b2 and c2; we then add them termwisely to obtain
a5 + b5 + c5 = −s(a3 + b3 + c3) + t(a2 + b2 + c2).
In the right hand side of the above expression, substitute a3 + b3 + c3 = 3t and

a2 + b2 + c2 = (a + b + c)2 −2(ab + ac + bc) = −2s

The stated equality is, now, obvious.

Example 16.9 (OCM) The roots of the polynomial f (X) = X3 −7X2 + 14X −6
are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Compute the value of its area.
Solution Let a, b and c be the roots of f and A be the area of the triangle with
sides a, b and c. Heron’s formula for the area of a triangle (cf. Chapter 7 of [9], for
instance) gives
A2 = p(p −a)(p −b)(p −c),
where p is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. On the other hand, by Girard-Viète
relations, we get
p = 1
2(a + b + c) = 1

same, a4 −8a2 + a + 11 = 0. Analogously, we have b4 −8b2 + b + 11 = 0, so that
a and b are roots of the polynomial
f (X) = X4 −8X2 + X + 11.
Likewise, we conclude that c and d are roots of the polynomial X4 −8X2 −X +11,
so that −c and −d are also roots of f .
Therefore, all of a, b, −c and −d are roots of f , and if we know that they are
pairwise distinct, we shall conclude that they are all of the roots of the polynomial
f ; in turn, Girard-Viète relations will give
abcd = ab(−c)(−d) = 11.

Newton’s Theorem
Yet with respect to symmetric polynomials, note that f (X, Y, Z) = X4 + Y 4 + Z4
is symmetric, albeit not one of the symmetric polynomials in X, Y, Z which we
called elementary. Nevertheless, letting s1 = s1(X, Y, Z), s2 = s2(X, Y, Z) and
s3 = s3(X, Y, Z), we can write

Thus, at least in this particular case, we were capable of expressing the symmetric
polynomial f (X, Y, Z) = X4 + Y 4 + Z4 as a polynomial in the elementary
symmetric polynomials in X, Y, Z.
Actually, the coming result, usually attributed to Newton and known in math-
ematical literature as the
fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials,
assures that this was no accident. In what follows, K includes the possibility K = Z.
Theorem 16.12 (Newton)
If f = f (X1, . . . , Xn) ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] is symmetric,
then there exists g ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] such that
f (X1, . . . , Xn) = g(s1, . . . , sn),
where s1, . . . , sn ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] are the elementary symmetric polynomials in
X1, . . . , Xn.
For the proof of this theorem, we shall need to introduce some preliminary
concepts. Firstly, let us order the monomials in K[X1, . . . , Xn] in the following

In this case, we say that b(j)Xj1

In general, we shall refer to the ordering above as the lexicographic order in
the monomials of K[X1, . . . , Xn]. In particular, for f ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] \ {0}, we
deﬁne its leading term as the maximum monomial with respect to the lexicographic

order. Note also that in K[X] one has 1 ≺X ≺X2 ≺· · · , so that the above notion
of leading term of a polynomial in several indeterminates coincides with the usual
notion in one indeterminate, which is given by the degree of the monomial.
Example 16.13 If f = sk1
1 . . . skn
n , with si ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] standing for the i-th
elementary symmetric polynomial, then f has leading term

the deﬁnition of lexicographic order guarantees that its leading term is
Xk1
1 (X1X2)k2(X1X2X3)k3 . . . (X1 . . . Xn)kn,
which is exactly (16.5).
With the concept of lexicographic order at our disposal, the key to the proof of
Newton’s theorem lies in the coming auxiliary result.
Lemma 16.14 If f
∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] is symmetric and a(α)Xα1
1 . . . Xαn
n
is its
leading term, then
α1 ≥· · · ≥αn.
Proof If α1 is the largest exponent appearing in some monomial of f , then, since f
is symmetric, it contains a monomial with Xα1
1 . If a(i)Xi1
1 . . . Xinn is a monomial in
f such that i1 < α1, it follows from the deﬁnition of lexicographic order that such
a monomial is not the leading one. Hence, the leading term of f must contain Xα1
1 .
Now, among all of the monomials in f containing Xα1
1 , choose one with
maximum exponent in one of the indeterminates X2, . . . , Xn, say exponent α2.
By invoking again the symmetry of f , there exists such a monomial contain-
ing Xα1
1 Xα2
2 ; moreover, from the choice of α1 we have α1 ≥α2. In turn, if
a(i)Xα1
1 Xi2
2 . . . Xinn is a monomial in f such that i2 < α2, then (again from the
deﬁnition of lexicographic order) such a monomial is not the leading one, which
shows that the leading term contains Xα1
1 Xα2
2 . Finally, by repeating the above
argument more n −2 times, we obtain the desired result.
⊓⊔
We can ﬁnally present the proof of Newton’s theorem.
Proof of Theorem 16.12 Take f ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn] symmetric, with leading term
a(α)Xα1
1 . . . Xαn
n . By the previous lemma, we have α1 ≥· · · ≥αn. On the other
hand, Example 16.13 guarantees that the symmetric polynomial

also has a(α)Xα1

as its leading term, so that the symmetric polynomial

1 . . . Xβn
n , with a(β)Xβ1
1 . . . Xβn
n
≺a(α)Xα1
1 . . . Xαn
n
in the lexicographic order. However, since K[X1, . . . , Xn] contains only a ﬁnite
number of monomials which are less than a(α)Xα1
1 . . . Xαn
n
with respect to the
lexicographic order, a ﬁnite number of repetitions of the algorithm above gives us
f −g = l(s1, . . . , sn), for some polynomial l ∈K[X1, . . . , Xn]. Thus, the same
happens with f .
⊓⊔
It is worth noticing that Newton’s theorem is mainly an existence result. Indeed, it
is possible to prove that, for generic symmetric polynomials, the algorithm described
in the proof of Theorem 16.12 does not ﬁnish in polynomial time (i.e., even with the
aid of a good computer, we will not be able to use the algorithm to actually express,
in ﬁnite time, a generic symmetric polynomial in n indeterminates as a polynomial
in the corresponding elementary symmetric polynomials). Nevertheless, the coming
example shows that the mere existence guaranteed by Newton’s theorem can be
quite useful. For another interesting application, see Sect. 20.1.
Example 16.15 (Miklós Schweitzer) Let f ∈Z[X] be a nonconstant polynomial
and ω = cis 2π
n , where n > 1 is an integer. Prove that
f (ω)f (ω2) . . . f (ωn−1) ∈Z.
Proof Consider the polynomial g ∈Z[X1, . . . , Xn−1] given by
g(X1, . . . , Xn−1) = f (X1)f (X2) . . . f (Xn−1).
If σ is a permutation of In−1, then
{σ(1), σ(2), . . . , σ(n −1)} = {1, 2, . . . , n −1},
so that
g(Xσ(1), . . . , Xσ(n−1)) = f (Xσ(1))f (Xσ(2)) . . . f (Xσ(n−1))
= f (X1)f (X2) . . . f (Xn−1)
= g(X1, . . . , Xn−1).
Thus, g is symmetric and Newton’s theorem assures the existence of a polynomial
h ∈Z[X1, . . . , Xn−1] such that g(X1, . . . , Xn−1) = h(s1, . . . , sn−1), i.e.,
f (X1)f (X2) . . . f (Xn−1) = h(s1, . . . , sn−1),
with sj standing for the j-th elementary symmetric polynomial in X1, . . . , Xn−1.

412

Relations Between Roots and Coefﬁcients
Substituting Xj by ωj in the equality above, we obtain
f (ω)f (ω2) . . . f (ωn−1) = h(s1(ω, . . . , ωn−1), . . . , sn−1(ω, . . . , ωn−1)).
Therefore, in order to show that f (ω)f (ω2) . . . f (ωn−1) ∈Z, it sufﬁces to show
that sj(ω, . . . , ωn−1) ∈Z for 1 ≤j ≤n −1.
For what is left to do, just note that
Xn −1 = (X −1)(X −ω)(X −ω2) . . . (X −ωn−1)
= (X −1)(Xn−1 + Xn−2 + · · · + X + 1),
so that
Xn−1 + Xn−2 + · · · + X + 1 = (X −ω)(X −ω2) . . . (X −ωn−1)
=
n−1

j=0
(−1)jsj(ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1)Xn−1−j.
Hence, we have
sj(ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1) = (−1)j ∈Z,
as wished.
⊓⊔
The discussion preceding the former example hints to the following fact: if we
wish to effectively express a given symmetric polynomial as a polynomial in the
elementary symmetric polynomials in the same number of indeterminates, we shall
usually have to rely on ad hoc arguments. In this sense, we end this section by
discussing a relevant example, for which we shall need the following consequence of
Horner-Ruﬁnni’s algorithm. Identities (16.6) below are known as Horner-Rufﬁni’s
identities.
Lemma 16.16 (Horner-Ruﬁnni) Let
f (X) = Xn −s1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)n−1sn−1X + (−1)nsn
be a nonconstant polynomial over C. If z is a complex root of f and
g(X) = Xn−1 + b1Xn−2 + · · · + bn−1
is the quotient upon division of f (X) by X −z, then

an equality that is equivalent to the stated one.

Chapter 17
Polynomials Over R
This chapter revisits, for real polynomials and departing from the fundamen-
tal theorem of Algebra, some classical theorems of Calculus. As applications
of them, we shall prove Newton’s inequalities, which generalizes the classical
inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means of n positive real num-
bers, and Descartes’ rule, which relates the number of positive roots of a real
polynomial with the number of changes of sign in the sequence of its nonzero
coefﬁcients.
17.1
Some Calculus Theorems
In this section we establish, for real polynomials, some classical results on continu-
ity and differentiability. For a more general approach, we refer the reader to [3] or
[8], for instance.
Our ﬁrst result provides a sufﬁcient way for the existence of real roots in a given
interval. For the proof of it, we shall need the following auxiliary result, which
appeared as Problem 6, page 386. Nevertheless, this time we give a different proof.
Lemma 17.1 If f ∈R[X] \ {0} is monic and has no real roots, then there exist
polynomials g, h ∈R[X] such that f = g2 + h2. In particular, f (x) > 0 for every
x ∈R.
Proof Problem 4, page 386, assures the existence of complex nonreal numbers

Now, if zj = aj + ibj, with aj, bj ∈R, then

= (X −aj)2 + b2
j,
the sum of the squares of two real polynomials (one of them being constant).
It now sufﬁces to apply several times the analogous of Euler’s identity (12.8) for
polynomials: for g1, g2, h1, h2 ∈R[X], we have
(g2
1 + h2
1)(g2
2 + h2
2) = (g1g2 + h1h2)2 + (g1h2 −g2h1)2.
For what is left to do, it follows from the ﬁrst part that
f (x) = g(x)2 + h(x)2 ≥0,
for every x ∈R. However, since f has no real roots, the inequality above must be
strict, for every x ∈R.
⊓⊔
The coming result is nothing but the intermediate value theorem for polynomials,
being known in mathematical literature as Bolzano’s theorem.1
Theorem 17.2 (Bolzano) If f ∈R[X] and a < b are real numbers such that
f (a)f (b) < 0, then there exists c ∈(a, b) for which f (c) = 0.
Proof Assuming, without loss of generality, that f is monic and f (a) < 0 < f (b),
the last part of the previous lemma assures that f has at least one real root. Let
a1 ≤· · · ≤ak be the real roots of f , repeated according to their multiplicities. If
g ∈R[X] is such that
f (X) = g(X)(X −a1) . . . (X −ak),
then g is monic and has no real roots, so that (again by the previous lemma) g(x) >
0 for every x ∈R.
By contradiction, suppose that no real root of f belongs to the interval (a, b),
and separately consider the three following cases:
(i) ak < a: we have
f (a) = g(a)(a −a1) . . . (a −ak) > 0,
which is a contradiction.

(ii) b < a1: it follows from f (b) > 0 that
g(b)(b −a1) . . . (b −ak) > 0
and, hence, k is even (for g(b) > 0 and b −ai < 0 for 1 ≤i ≤k). On the
other hand, since f (a) < 0, we get
g(a)(a −a1) . . . (a −ak) < 0,
so that k is odd (for g(a) > 0 and a −ai < 0 for 1 ≤i ≤k). We have, thus,
reached a contradiction.
(iii) al < a < b < al+1, for some 1 ≤l < k: we can arrive at a contradiction in a
way similar to that of item (ii). For instance,

Example 17.3 (Moldavia) Let f, g ∈R[X] be two given polynomials, each of
which possessing at least one real root.
(a) Prove that there exists a ∈R such that f (a)2 = g(a)2.
(b) If f (1 + X + g(X)2) = g(1 + X + f (X)2), show that f = g.
Proof
(a) Let α and β be real roots of f and g, respectively. We can assume, without any
loss of generality, that α ≤β. If g(α) = 0 or f (β) = 0, there is nothing to do.
Otherwise,
f (α)2 −g(α)2 = −g(α)2 < 0 and f (β)2 −g(β)2 = f (β)2 > 0,
so that Bolzano’s theorem, applied to the polynomial f (X)2 −g(X)2, guaran-
tees the existence of a ∈(α, β) such that f (a)2 −g(a)2 = 0.
(b) Choose a ∈R as in item (a) and deﬁne a sequence (un)n≥1 by letting u0 = a
and, for each integer n ≥1, un+1 = 1 + un + g(un)2. It follows from (a) that
f (u1) = g(u1). Now assume, as induction hypothesis, that f (uk) = g(uk) for
some integer k ≥1. Then,
f (uk+1) = f (1 + uk + g(uk)2)
= g(1 + uk + f (uk)2)
= g(1 + uk + g(uk)2) = g(uk+1).

Thus, we have f (un) = g(un) for every integer n ≥1, with
un+1 = 1 + un + g(un)2 ≥1 + un > un
for each such n ≥1. Therefore, Corollary 15.10 gives f = g.
⊓⊔
In what comes next, we establish, for polynomials, Lagrange’s mean value
theorem.
Theorem 17.4 (Lagrange) Let f ∈R[X] \ {0} and a < b be given real numbers.
Then, there exists a < c < b such that
f ′(c) = f (b) −f (a)
b −a
.
Proof We may assume that f ̸= 0, and ﬁrst show that if f (a) = f (b) = 0, then
there exists a < c < b for which f ′(c) = 0. Without any loss of generality, we
can assume that f has no other roots in the interval (a, b). Indeed, since f ̸= 0,
Corollary 15.9 assures that f has at most a ﬁnite number of roots in (a, b); then, if
these are a1 < a2 < · · · < ak, it sufﬁces to consider a1 in place of b.
If there exist a < c < d < b such that f (c)f (d) < 0, Bolzano’s theorem
guarantees the existence of a root of f in the interval (a, b) which is an absurd.
Hence, f has constant sign along the interval (a, b). Assume, without loss of
generality, that f (x) > 0 for x ∈(a, b), and let k and l be the multiplicities of
a and b as roots of f , respectively. Then, there exists g ∈R[X] such that
f (X) = (X −a)k(X −b)lg(X),
with g(a), g(b) ̸= 0. Now,
a < c < b ⇒f (c) > 0 ⇒(c −a)k(c −b)lg(c) > 0 ⇒(−1)lg(c) > 0.
We look at the case of an even l (that of odd l can be dealt with in an analogous
way), so that g(c) > 0 for every c ∈(a, b). If g(a) < 0, then Bolzano’s theorem
would assure the existence of a < d < a+b
2
such that g(d) = 0; in turn, this would
give f (d) = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, g(a) > 0 and, likewise, g(b) > 0.
We then have
f ′(X) = k(X −a)k−1(X −b)lg(X) + l(X −a)k(X −b)l−1g(X)
+ (X −a)k(X −b)lg′(X)
= (X −a)k−1(X −b)l−1h(X),

17.1

421
with
h(X) = (k(X −b) + l(X −a))g(X) + (X −a)(X −b)g′(X).
It now sufﬁces to show that there exists c ∈(a, b) such that h(c) = 0. However,
since
h(a)h(b) = −kl(a −b)2g(a)g(b) < 0,
an application of Bolzano’s theorem does the job.
For the general case, let
f1(X) = f (X) −f (a) −
f (b) −f (a)
b −a

(X −a),
which is also a polynomial. Since f1(a) = f1(b) = 0, what we did above guarantees
the existence of c ∈(a, b) such that f ′
1(c) = 0. Finally, it is enough to note that
f ′
1(X) = f ′(X) −
f (b) −f (a)
b −a

.
⊓⊔
The case f (a) = f (b) = 0 in the previous result preceded the general version
due to Lagrange. For this reason, it is usually referred to as Rôlle’s theorem, in
honor of his discoverer, the French mathematician of the seventeenth century Michel
Rôlle.
Corollary 17.5 (Rôlle) If f ∈R[X] and a < b are real numbers such that f (a) =
f (b) = 0, then there exists a < c < b for which f ′(c) = 0.
The coming example illustrates a typical use of Rôlle’s theorem.

An important consequence of Lagrange’s mean value theorem is the study of the
ﬁrst variation (i.e., of the growth or decay) of real polynomials. This is the subject
of the coming corollary.
Corollary 17.7 Let f ∈R[X] \ {0} and I ⊂R be an interval.
(a) If f ′(x) > 0 for every x ∈I, then f increases in I.
(b) If f ′(x) < 0 for every x ∈I, then f decreases in I.
Proof Let us prove item (a), the proof of (b) being entirely analogous. For a < b in
I, the mean value theorem furnishes c ∈(a, b) (and, hence, c ∈I) such that
f (b) −f (a)
b −a
= f ′(c) > 0.
In particular, f (b) > f (a).
⊓⊔
The coming example uses a little more Calculus than we discussed above. As
before, we refer the reader to [3] or [8] for the necessary background.
Example 17.8 (Sweden) Prove that, for every natural number n, the real polynomial
1 + X + 1
2!X2 + · · · + 1
n!Xn
has at most one real root.
Proof Letting fn = 1 + X + X2
2! + · · · + Xn
n! , we shall show that (i) fn has no real
roots if n is even, and (ii) fn has exactly one real root if n is odd.
(i) Assuming n even, we have lim|x|→+∞fn(x) = +∞. Hence, Weierstrass’
theorem (Theorem 8.26 of [8]) assures the existence of x0 ∈R such that fn
assumes its minimum value at x0. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that
fn(x0) ≤0. Then, Problem 3 gives f ′
n(x0) = 0, and then
0 ≥fn(x0) = f ′
n(x0) + xn
0
n! = xn
0
n! .
Since n is even, the inequality above successively gives x0 = 0 and fn(0) = 0,
which is an absurd.
(ii) Assuming n odd, Problem 5, page 386, gives an odd number of real roots for
fn. On the other hand, since f ′
n = fn−1 > 0 (for n −1 is even), Example 15.33
shows that fn has no multiple roots. By the sake of contradiction, suppose that
fn has at least two distinct real roots, say a < b. Then, Rôlle’s theorem gives
α ∈(a, b) such that f ′
n(α) = 0. This way, fn−1(α) = 0, and this contradicts
(i), for n −1 is even.

Newton’s Inequalities
In this section, we present a set of inequalities that reﬁne the inequality between
the arithmetic and geometric means of a ﬁnite set of positive real numbers (cf.
Section 5.1 of [8], for instance—actually, there we give four different proofs of
such an inequality). To this end, we ﬁrst need the following auxiliary result.

17.2
Newton’s Inequalities
425
Lemma 17.9 If f ∈R[X] \ {0} has k real roots, counted with multiplicities, then
f ′ has at least k −1 real roots, also counted with multiplicities. In particular, if all
roots of f are real, then so are all of the roots of f ′.
Proof For the ﬁrst part, we can assume that k > 1. Let a1 < · · · < al be the
distinct real roots of f , with multiplicities respectively equal to m1, . . . , ml, so that
m1 + · · · + ml = k. We have already seen, in Proposition 15.31 that ai is a root of
f ′ with multiplicity mi −1. On the other hand, Rôlle’s theorem assures that f ′ has
at least one additional root between ai and ai+1; since there are l −1 intervals of
the form (ai, ai+1), we thus count at least
(m1 −1) + · · · + (ml −1) + (l −1) = k −1
real roots for f ′.
For the second part, assume that f has degree n and n real roots, counted with
multiplicities. Then, f ′ has degree n −1 and, by the ﬁrst part, at least n −1 real
roots, also counted with multiplicities. Therefore, all roots of f ′ are real too.

The coming result is usually credited to Newton, and inequalities (17.1) are
usually referred to as Newton’s inequalities. For the sake of notation, we let
H0 = 1.
Theorem 17.10 (Newton) Let n > 1 be an integer and a1, a2, . . . , an be given real
numbers. If H1(ak), H2(ak), . . . , Hj+1(ak) ̸= 0 for some 1 ≤j < n, then
Hj(ak)2 ≥Hj−1(ak)Hj+1(ak),
(17.1)
with equality if and only if a1 = a2 = . . . = an.
Proof Let us make induction on n. For n = 2, we want to show that H 2
1 (a1, a2) ≥
H0(a1, a2)H2(a1, a2) or, which is the same,
 a1+a2
2
2 ≥a1a2. But this is equivalent
to (a1 −a2)2 ≥0, which turns into an equality if and only if a1 = a2.
Assume, by induction hypothesis, that for any n −1 given real numbers b1, . . . ,
bn−1 such that H1(bk), H2(bk), . . . , Hj+1(bk) ̸= 0 for some 1 ≤j < n −1, we
have Hj(bk)2 ≥Hj−1(bk)Hj+1(bk), with equality if and only if b1 = . . . = bn−1.
We now consider n ≥3 real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, and let
f (X) = (X + a1) . . . (X + an).

The previous lemma assures the existence of n −1 real numbers b1, . . . , bn−1 such
that bk ∈(ak, ak+1) for 1 ≤k < n and
f ′(X) = n(X + b1) . . . (X + bn−1).

and comparing coefﬁcients with (17.2) we obtain, for 0 ≤j ≤n −1,
Hj(a1, . . . , an) = Hj(b1, . . . , bn−1).
Now, assume that H1(ak), H2(ak), . . . , Hj+1(ak) ̸= 0 for some 1 ≤j ≤n −2.
Then, H1(bk), H2(bk), . . . , Hj+1(bk) ̸= 0 and, by induction hypothesis, for 1 ≤
j ≤n −2 we have
H 2
j (ak) = H 2
j (bk) ≥Hj−1(bk)Hj+1(bk) = Hj−1(ak)Hj+1(ak).
(17.3)
For the equality, if H 2
j (ak) = Hj−1(ak)Hj+1(ak) for some 1 ≤j ≤n −2,
then (17.3) gives H 2
j (bk) = Hj−1(bk)Hj+1(bk). Therefore, the condition for
equality in the induction hypothesis furnishes b1 = . . . = bn−1, and from this it
is almost immediate (cf. Problem 1) to show that a1 = . . . = an.
We are left to proving that, if H1(ak), H2(ak), . . . , Hn(ak) ̸= 0, then
H 2
n−1(ak) ≥Hn−2(ak)Hn(ak),
with equality if and only if a1 = . . . = an. We shall prove that this is true provided
we merely have Hn(ak) ̸= 0. Indeed, in what concerns the desired inequality, it is

The coming corollary, due to the Scottish mathematician of the eighteenth
century Colin McLaurin, embodies the promised reﬁnement of the inequality
between the arithmetic and geometric means. Inequalities (17.4) are then known
as McLaurin inequalities.

Therefore, H 4

The main result of this section relates the number of positive roots of a real
polynomial to the number of changes of sign along the sequence of its nonvanishing
coefﬁcients. Among the results proved so far in this chapter, it depends only on the
Bolzano theorem, so that we could have discussed it right after that. Up to details,
our presentation follows [26].
We start with the following combinatorial lemma, which can be easily established
by induction, for example.
Lemma 17.12 For each ﬁnite sequence ν of + and −signs, let V (ν) denote the
number of pairs of distinct consecutive signs in ν. If A stands for the set of those
sequences with initial and ﬁnal distinct signs, and B for the set of those sequences
with initial and ﬁnal equal signs, then:
(a) ν ∈A ⇒V (ν) ≡1(mod 2).
(b) ν ∈B ⇒V (ν) ≡0(mod 2).
Now, we shall need the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 17.13 Let
f (X) = anXkn + an−1Xkn−1 + · · · + a1Xk1 + a0Xk0
be a nonconstant real polynomial, with kn > kn−1 > . . . > k1 > k0 ≥0 and aj ̸= 0
for 0 ≤j ≤n. Deﬁne the sequence νf = (αn, αn−1, . . . , α1, α0) by setting, for
each integer 0 ≤j ≤n,
αj =
+, if aj > 0
−, if aj < 0 .
The variation of f , denoted V (f ), is the number of pairs of distinct consecutive
signs in νf .
For our purposes, the following one is a crucial result.
Lemma 17.14 Let g be a nonconstant real polynomial and c > 0 be a given real
number. If f (X) = (X −c)g(X), then V (f ) −V (g) is an odd positive integer.
Proof We make induction on ∂g ≥1.

430
17
Polynomials Over R
(a) ∂g = 1: we can surely suppose that g is monic. If g(X) = X, then f (X) =
X2 −cX, so that V (f ) −V (g) = 1. Now, assume that g(X) = X −α, with
α > 0. Then, f (X) = X2 −(α + c)X + cα, so that V (f ) −V (g) = 2 −1 = 1.
The case g(X) = X + α, with α > 0, is equally easy: f (X) = X2 + (α −
c)X −cα and, since −cα < 0, Lemma 17.12 assures that V (f ) is odd; hence,
V (f ) −V (g) = V (f ), an odd positive integer.
(b) Assume that the result is valid for every nonconstant real polynomial g such that
∂g < n, with n > 1 being an integer, and take another such polynomial g, this
time of degree n. For the sake of notation, for a given nonconstant real polyno-
mial h, whenever necessary we shall denote by αh and βh, respectively, the lead-
ing coefﬁcient and the coefﬁcient of the term of lowest degree in h. In particular,
h(X) = αhXr + · · · + βhXs,
with r ≥s. We distinguish three cases:
(i) All coefﬁcients of g are positive: once again assume (without loss of
generality) that g monic, say g(X) = Xn + · · · + βXl, with l < n. Then,
f (X) = (X −c)g(X) = Xn+1 + · · · −cβXl,
with cβ < 0, and Lemma 17.12 shows that V (f ) is odd and, hence
V (f ) −V (g) = V (f ) is an odd positive integer.
(ii) There exist nonconstant polynomials u and v such that g = u + v,
u(X) = αuXr + · · · + βuXs, and v(X) = αvXp + · · · + βvXq,
with n = r ≥s, p ≥q and p + 1 < s. Then,
(X −c)g(X) = (X −c)u(X) + (X −c)v(X)
= (αuXr+1 + · · · −cβuXs)
+ (αvXp+1 + · · · −cβvXq),
(17.6)
since p + 1 < s. Let us now look at two distinct subcases: αvβu > 0 and
αvβu < 0.
•
αvβu > 0: we obviously have V (g) = V (u) + V (v). However, since
(−cβu)αv < 0, the second equality in (17.6) shows that
V (f ) = V ((X −c)g) = V ((X −c)u) + V ((X −c)v) + 1.
By the induction hypothesis (in principle, u has degree r
=
n;
nevertheless, s > 1 implies that we can apply the induction hypothesis
to w(X) = αuXr−s + · · · + βu, since u(X) = Xsw(X)), we obtain
V (f ) ≥(1 + V (u)) + (1 + V (v)) + 1 > V (g) + 1

17.3
Descartes’ Rule
431
and, modulo 2,
V (f ) ≡(1 + V (u)) + (1 + V (v)) + 1 ≡V (g) + 1.
•
αvβu < 0: since αvβu < 0, we have
V (g) = V (u) + V (v) + 1
and, by (17.6),
V (f ) = V ((X −c)g) = V ((X −c)u) + V ((X −c)v).
Once again from the induction hypothesis, we get
V (f ) ≥(1 + V (u)) + (1 + V (v)) = V (g) + 1
and, modulo 2,
V (f ) ≡(1 + V (u)) + (1 + V (v)) ≡V (g) + 1.
(iii) g(X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + akXk, with an, . . . , ak ̸= 0 and not
all of an, an−1, . . . , ak positive. Assume, without loss of generality, that
an > 0, and write
g = g0 −g1 + · · · + (−1)tgt,
such that each gi = αiXki + · · · + βiXli (ki ≥li) has only positive
coefﬁcients and li = ki+1 + 1 for i < t. Then, V (g) = t and
(X −c)g = (X −c)g0 −(X −c)g1 + · · · + (−1)t(X −c)gt
= (X −c)(α0Xk0 + · · · + β0Xl0)
−(X −c)(α1Xk1 + · · · + β1Xl1) + · · ·
+ (−1)t(X −c)(αtXkt + · · · + βtXlt )
= α0Xk0+1 + · · · −(α1 + cβ0)Xl0 + · · · + (α2 + cβ1)Xl1
+ · · · −(α3 + cβ2)Xl2 + · · · + (−1)t(αt + cβt−1)Xlt−1
+ · · · + (−1)t+1cβtXlt .
Since α0, α1 + cβ0, α2 + cβ1, . . . , αt + cβt−1 and cβt are all positive,
Lemma 17.12 assures that there is an odd number of changes of sign (and,
hence, at least one) of consecutive pairs of coefﬁcients in each of the t + 1
dotted intervals above. This gives
V (f ) = V ((X −c)g) ≥t + 1 = V (g) + 1.

432

It also follows from the above that, modulo 2,
V (f ) = V ((X −c)g) ≡t + 1 = V (g) + 1.
⊓⊔
We can ﬁnally state and prove the following result, which is known in Mathe-
matics as Descartes’ rule2 for polynomials with real coefﬁcients.
Theorem 17.15 (Descartes) Let f be a nonconstant real polynomial. If P(f )
denotes the number of positive roots of f , then V (f ) −P(f ) is a nonnegative
even integer.
Proof We make induction on the degree of f .
If ∂f = 1, assume, without loss of generality, that f is monic. If f (X) = X or
f (X) = X + α, with α > 0, then V (f ) −P(f ) = 0 −0 = 0. If f (X) = X −α,
with α > 0, then V (f ) −P(f ) = 1 −1 = 0.
Now, let n > 1 be a given integer and suppose that the theorem holds true for
each nonconstant real polynomial of degree less than n. If
f (X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0
is a real polynomial of degree, we have two different cases:
•
P(f ) = 0: in this case, it sufﬁces to show that V (f ) is even. Since f (0) = a0
and f (x) has the same sign as an for every sufﬁciently large real number x (for
limx→+∞
f (x)
xn
= an), the fact that P(f ) = 0 assures, via Bolzano’s theorem,
that ana0 > 0. Hence, Lemma 17.12 guarantees that V (f ) is even.

P(f ) > 0: by taking a positive root c of f , there exists a nonconstant polynomial
g such that f (X) = (X −c)g(X). Lemma 17.14 guarantees the existence of an
odd positive integer I for which
V (f ) −P(f ) = (V (g) + I) −(P(g) + 1)
= (V (g) −P(g)) + (I −1).
Since, by induction hypothesis, V (g) −P(g) is nonnegative and even, we
conclude that the same holds for V (f ) −P(f ).

2René Descartes, French mathematician, philosopher and scientist of the seventeenth century.
Descartes’ legacy to Mathematics and science is a huge one, and came mainly from his
landmarking book Discours de la Méthode (Discourse on the Method) and its three corresponding
appendices. This book marks a turning point on the way of doing science, for, along it, Descartes
strongly rejected the scholastic tradition of using speculation, instead of deduction, as the central
strategy for the investigation of natural phenomena. On the other hand, its appendix La Géométrie
layed down the foundations of Analytic Geometry, and nowadays every student is acquainted with
cartesian coordinate systems.

17.3
Descartes’ Rule
433
The coming corollary examines the case of negative roots.
Corollary 17.16 If f is a nonconstant real polynomial and N(f ) is the number of
its negative roots, then V (f (−X)) −N(f ) is nonnegative and even.
Proof Immediate from Descartes’ rule, together with the fact that α ∈N(f ) if and
only if −α ∈P(f ).
⊓⊔
As a direct consequence of Descartes’ rule, if f is a nonconstant real polynomial
such that V (f ) is odd, then has at least one positive root. More particularly, if
V (f ) = 1, then f has exactly one positive root. The coming example takes
advantage of this fact.
Example 17.17 Let a0, a1, . . . , an−1 be nonnegative real numbers, at least one of
which being nonzero. Compute the number of positive roots of the real polynomial
Xn −an−1Xn−1 −· · · −a1X −a0.
Solution Denoting by f the given polynomial, Theorem 17.15 assures that V (f )−
P(f ) is nonnegative and even. However, since V (f ) = 1, it is clear that P(f ) = 1.
⊓⊔
Problems: Sect. 17.3

Chapter 18
Interpolation of Polynomials
Corollary 15.10 assures that there is at most one polynomial of degree n and
assuming preassigned values in n + 1 given complex numbers. What we still do not
know is whether such a polynomial actually exists. For instance, does there exists a
polynomial f with rational coefﬁcients, degree 3 and such that f (0) = 1, f (1) = 2,
f (2) = 3 and f (3) = 0? In this chapter we study a bunch of techniques that allow us
to answer this and alike questions, and which are generically referred to as interpola-
tion of polynomials. In particular, we shall study in detail the class of Lagrange inter-
polating polynomials, which will then be used to solve Vandermonde’ linear systems
with no Linear Algebra. In turn, the knowledge of the solutions of such linear
systems will allow us to study, in Sect. 21.1, an important particular class of linear
recurrence relations, thus partially extending the methods of Section 3.2 of [8].

Bases for Polynomials
For what follows, recall that K stands for any of the number sets Q, R or C. We
shall ﬁrstly need to establish a quite useful notation.
Deﬁnition 18.1 For n ∈N and 1 ≤i, j ≤n, we let the Kronecker delta1 δij be
deﬁned by
δij =
1, if i = j
0, if i ̸= j .
The advantage of Kronecker’s notation comes from the fact that we can use it as
a tag, in the following sense: given n ∈N and a sequence (b1, . . . , bn) in K, we
have

Now, let be given n ∈N and pairwise distinct elements a1, a2, . . . , an in K. For
1 ≤i ≤n, we deﬁne Li ∈K[X] by
Li(X) =

with the hat  over a certain factor meaning that it is actually missing from the
product. Such polynomials Li are called the Lagrange interpolating polynomials
for the set {a1, . . . , an}.
It is immediate to verify that
Li(aj) = δij
for all 1 ≤i, j ≤n. In turn, as we shall see in the coming result, this property
allows us to build polynomials attaining preassigned values at a set of pairwise
distinct given elements of K. Such a result is usually referred to as the Lagrange
interpolating theorem.
Theorem 18.2 (Lagrange) Given n ∈N and a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn ∈K, with
a1, . . . , an being pairwise distinct, there exists exactly one polynomial f ∈K[X],
of degree less than n and such that f (ai) = bi for 1 ≤i ≤n. More precisely, such
a polynomial is
f (X) =
n

j=1
bjLj(X),
(18.2)
with the Lj standing for the Lagrange interpolating polynomials for the set
{a1, . . . , an}.
Proof Uniqueness follows from Corollary 15.10. On the other hand, taking f as
in (18.2), it sufﬁces to show that ∂f < n and f (ai) = bi for 1 ≤i ≤n.
Since ∂Lj = n −1 for 1 ≤j ≤n and the degree of a sum of polynomials,
whenever deﬁned, does not surpass the greatest degree of the summands, it is pretty
clear that ∂f < n. For what is left to do, just note that
f (ai) =

The following corollary provides an equivalent way of formulating the previous
result.
Corollary 18.3 Let n ∈N and a1, . . . , an be pairwise distinct elements of K. If
f ∈K[X] \ {0} satisﬁes ∂f < n, then

Proof Indeed, by letting

we have ∂f, ∂g < n and, by the proof of Lagrange’s theorem, g(ai) = f (ai) for
1 ≤i ≤n. Therefore, by invoking Corollary 15.10 once more, we get g = f .
⊓⊔
We now collect some interesting applications of Lagrange’s interpolation, begin-
ning with the operational aspects involved.

We now show how to use Lagrange’s interpolating polynomials to solve certain
types of linear systems of equations, known as Vandermonde systems. Apart from
Example 18.7, Vandermonde systems will also play a role in the discussion of some
special linear recurrence relations, in Sect. 21.1.
Proposition 18.6 (Vandermonde) Given elements a1, a2, . . . , an, α1, α2, . . . , αn

admits a unique solution in K. In particular, if α1 = · · · = αn = 0, then x1 = · · · =
xn = 0.
Proof If f (X) = c0 + c1X + · · · + cn−1Xn−1 ∈K[X], then, by respectively
multiplying the equations of the linear system by c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 and adding the
results, we obtain
f (a1)x1 + · · · + f (an)xn = c0α1 + c1α2 + · · · + cn−1αn.
Now, if we let f = Li, where Li is the i-th Lagrange interpolating polynomial
for {a1, a2, . . . , an}, then the left hand side of the equality above reduces to xi, so
that
xi = c0α1 + c1α2 + · · · + cn−1αn ∈K.

The coming example shows how to use the previous proposition to give an
alternative proof for the generalized multisection formula (cf. Problem 8, page 355).

Proof Writing
f (X) = u0(Xn) + Xu1(Xn) + · · · + Xn−1un−1(Xn),
with u0, u1, . . . , un−1 ∈C[X], and taking into account that ωn = 1, we obtain

(18.5)
According to (18.4), we have

⊓⊔
A limitation of Lagrange interpolation lies in the fact that it only generates the
set of nonzero polynomials having degrees less than or equal to some ﬁxed natural
number. We remedy such a situation with the following more general deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 18.8 A basis for K[X] is a sequence (f0, f1, f2, . . .) of elements of
K[X] satisfying the following condition: for every f ∈K[X], there exist unique
n ∈Z+ and a0, . . . , an ∈K such that
f (X) = a0f0(X) + · · · + anfn(X).
Example 18.9 A simple way of constructing a basis for K[X] is to take a sequence
(f0, f1, f2, . . .) in K[X] such that ∂fj = j for every j ≥0.
In order to show that such a sequence is indeed a basis for K[X], we have to
establish the following two claims:
(i) If n ∈N and a0, a1, . . . , an and b0, b1, . . . , bn are elements of K such that
a0f0(X) + a1f1(X) + · · · + anfn(X) = b0f0(X) + b1f1(X) + · · · + bnfn(X),
then ai = bi for 0 ≤i ≤n.
(ii) For every f ∈K[X], there exist n ∈N and a0, a1, . . . , an ∈K such that
f (X) = a0f0(X) + a1f1(X) + · · · + anfn(X).
We leave these checkings for the reader (cf. Problem 1).
As a particular case of the previous example, note that the sequence
(1, X, X2, X3, . . .)
is a basis for K[X] (as we already knew).
In what follows, inspired by the binomial numbers, we construct a quite useful
basis for K[X].

Even though the concept of basis for K[X], as formulated above, does not apply
directly to polynomials over Z, when dealing with the binomial basis we have the
following result.
Proposition 18.11 If f ∈C[X] \ {0} is a polynomial of degree n such that f (0),
f (1), . . . , f (n) are all integers, then there exist unique a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Z such that

Proof Since the binomial polynomials for a basis for C[X], there exist unique
a0, a1, . . . , an ∈C such that f can be written as in the statement of the proposition.
Thus, it sufﬁces to prove that a0, a1, . . . , an are integers.
Arguing once more by induction, start by noticing that Z ∋f (0) = a0. Now,
assume that we have already proved that a0, . . . , ak−1 ∈Z, for some integer 1 ≤
k ≤n. Then, (18.10) gives

(18.12)
and the fact that a0, a1, . . . , ak−1 ∈Z, together with f (k) ∈Z, gives ak ∈Z.
For the last part, since

(x) ∈Z for every x ∈Z (cf. Problem 2), it follows
from (18.10) that f (x) ∈Z for every x ∈Z.

Finite Differences
Another useful, though a little more elaborate, interpolation technique is that of
ﬁnite differences. We shall sketch the rudiments of it along this section.
Deﬁnition 18.12 Let h be a real number and f : R →R be a given function.
For an integer k ≥0, we deﬁne the k-th ﬁnite difference of f with step h as the
function k
hf : R →R, given by:
(a) 0
hf = f .
(b) (1
hf )(x) = (hf )(x) = f (x + h) −f (x) for each x ∈R.
(c) k
hf = h(k−1
h
f ) for k ≥2.
For such a deﬁnition to be useful, we need the properties of k
hf collected in the
coming result.
Proposition 18.13 In the notations of the previous deﬁnition, given h ∈R and
functions f, g : R →R, we have that:
(a) If f is constant, then hf = 0.
(b) If a and b are real constants, then h(af + bg) = ahf + bhg.
(c) h(fg) = (hf )(g + hg) + f hg.
(d) k
hf = k−1
h
(hf ), for every k ∈N.
(e) If k ≥0 and x ∈R, then
(k
hf )(x) =

f (x + (k −j)h).
Proof
(a) For x ∈R, we have hf (x) = f (x + h) −f (x) = 0, since f is constant.
(b) For x ∈R, we can write
(h(af + bg))(x) = (af + bg)(x + h) −(af + bg)(x)
= a(f (x + h) −f (x)) + b(g(x + h) −g(x))
= a(hf )(x) + b(hg)(x).

(d) Let us make induction on k ≥1, the case k = 1 following directly from
Deﬁnition 18.12. By induction hypothesis, assume that the result is true when
k = l ≥1. For k = l + 1, successively applying item (c) of Deﬁnition 18.12,
the induction hypothesis and once more item (c) of Deﬁnition 18.12 (but this
time to hf in place of f ), we obtain

⊓⊔
Among the properties of ﬁnite differences listed in the previous proposition, the
one which is more frequently used in interpolation problems is that of item (e),
mostly when combined with the coming simple result. Note that the proposition
above refers to ﬁnite differences of general real functions, whereas the next one is
speciﬁcally related to ﬁnite differences of polynomials.
We start by extending Deﬁnition 18.12 to polynomials, in the obvious way: for
ﬁxed h ∈R and f ∈R[X], given an integer k ≥0 we deﬁne the k-th ﬁnite
difference of f with step h as the polynomial k
hf ∈R[X] given by:
(i) 0
hf = f .
(ii) (1
hf )(X) = (hf )(X) = f (X + h) −f (X).
(iii) k
hf = h(k−1
h
f ), for k ≥2.
In view of the above deﬁnition, it is now immediate to check that items from (a) to
(d) of the previous proposition still hold for ﬁnite differences of polynomials.
Proposition 18.14 Let f
∈R[X] be a polynomial of degree n ≥1. For an
arbitrary ﬁxed step h ∈R \ {0}, the n-th ﬁnite differences of f all equal, whereas
the l-th ones, for any l > n, vanish identically.
Proof Start by observing that, if f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0, then
(hf )(X) = an(X + h)n + · · · + a1(X + h) + a0
−(anXn + · · · + a1X + a0)
= nanhXn−1 + g(X),

448
18
Interpolation of Polynomials
with either g ≡0 or ∂g ≤n −2. Since h ̸= 0, we conclude that hf has degree
n −1. Therefore, arguing by induction on the degree of a polynomial, item (d) of
the (extension, for polynomials, of the) previous proposition guarantees that n
hf =
n−1
h
(hf ) has degree 0, so that it is constant. Hence, l
hf (X) = 0 for l > k.
⊓⊔
As will be clear from the two coming examples, the main usefulness of the
material on ﬁnite differences discussed above lies on the fact that, if the interpolation
points form an arithmetic progression, then the method of ﬁnite differences allow
us to compute the value of the corresponding polynomial at any point of such a
progression.
Example 18.15 Let f ∈R[X] be a polynomial of degree m ≥1, such that f (j) =
rj for 0 ≤j ≤m, with r being a given positive real number. Compute all possible
values of f (m + 1).
Solution Set h = 1 and write kf to denote k
1f (either the polynomial or its
corresponding polynomial function). Item (e) of Proposition 18.13 gives

1 ≤i ≤1993. Compute the remainder upon division of f (1994) by 1994.

For what is left to do, note ﬁrst that 997 is prime (this can be easily checked with
the aid of Eratosthenes sieve, exactly as we did in Example 6.37 to show that 641 is
prime). Hence, Fermat’s Little Theorem 10.15 assures that 2996 ≡1 (mod 997), so
that
21992 = (2996)2 ≡1 (mod 997).
From this, it is immediate to get
f (1994) = 21994 −2 ≡22 −2 ≡2 (mod 997).
We are then left with the system of linear congruences
f (1994) ≡0 (mod 2)
f (1994) ≡2 (mod 997) ,
which has, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem 10.27, a single solution modulus
2 · 997 = 1994. However, since 2 is clearly a solution, we obtain
f (1994) ≡2 (mod 1994).

Chapter 19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
The division algorithm for polynomials provides a notion of divisibility in K[X]
when K = Q, R ou C, and such a notion enjoys properties analogous to those of
the corresponding concept in Z. It is then natural to ask whether there exists some
notion of primality in K[X], which furnishes some sort of unique factorisation with
properties similar to the unique factorisation of integers. Our purpose in this chapter
is to give precise answers to these questions, which shall encompass polynomials
with coefﬁcients in Zp, for some prime integer p.
19.1
Unique Factorisation in Q[X]
Along this section, K denotes any of Q, R or C.
We say that f, g ∈K[X]\{0} are associated (in K[X]) if there exists a ∈K\{0}
such that f = ag. For instance, the real polynomials
f (X) = 4X2 −2X + 1 and g(X) = 2
√
2X2 −
√
2X + 1
√
2
are associated in R[X], for f =
√
2g and
√
2 ∈R \ {0}.
Given f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}, we say that a polynomial p ∈K[X] \ {0} is a common
divisor of f and g if p | f, g. Note that f and g always have common divisors: the
constant nonzero polynomials over K, for example.
Deﬁnition 19.1 Given f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}, we say that d ∈K[X] \ {0} is a greatest
common divisor of f and g, and denote d = gcd(f, g), if the two following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) d | f, g in K[X].
(b) If d′ ∈K[X] \ {0} divides f and g in K[X], then d′ | d in K[X].

On the Factorisation of Polynomials
The coming result is the analogue, for polynomials, of Theorem 6.13. For this
reason, it is also known as Bézout’s theorem. In order to properly state it, given
f ∈K[X] we let f K[X], or simply (f ), if there is no danger of confusion, denote
the subset of K[X] formed by the multiples of f , i.e.,
(f ) = f K[X] = {af ; a ∈K[X]}.
Theorem 19.2 (Bézout)
Let f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}. If
S = {af + bg; a, b ∈K[X]},
then there exists a polynomial d ∈K[X]\{0} satisfying the following conditions:
(a) S = (d). In particular, d | f, g in K[X].
(b) Every polynomial in K[X] \ {0} that divides f and g also divides d.
Moreover, such a polynomial d is unique, up to association.
Proof
(a) Let d ∈S \ {0} be such that
∂d = min{∂h; h ∈S \ {0}}.
We ﬁrst claim that S = (d). Indeed, letting d = a0f +b0g, with a0, b0 ∈K[X],
and c ∈K[X], we have
cd = (ca0)f + (cb0)g ∈S,
i.e., (d) ⊂S. Conversely, take h ∈S, say h = af + bg, with a, b ∈K[X]. By
the division algorithm, we have h = dq + r, with q, r ∈K[X] and r = 0 or
0 ≤∂r < ∂d. However, if r ̸= 0, then ∂r < ∂d and
r = h −dq
= (af + bg) −(a0f + b0g)q
= (a −a0q)f + (b −b0q)g ∈S,
a contradiction to the minimality of the degree of d in S. Therefore, r = 0 and,
hence, h = dq ∈(d).
For the second part of item (a), it sufﬁces to see that f, g ∈S = (d), so that,
in particular, f and g are multiples of d in K[X].
(b) Let d′ ∈K[X] \ {0} be a polynomial dividing f and g in K[X], say f = d′f1
and g = d′g1, with f1, g1 ∈K[X]. If a, b ∈K[X], then
af + bg = (af1 + bg1)d′ ∈d′ K[X].

19.1
Unique Factorisation in Q[X]
453
However, since af + bg is a generic element of S, it follows that
d ∈(d) = S ⊂(d′);
in particular, d is a multiple of d′, as we wished to show.
The last claim is left as an exercise for the reader (cf. Problem 1).
⊓⊔
In the notations of the statement of Bézout’s theorem, given f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}
and letting d ∈K[X] \ {0} be such that d K[X] = S, from now on we say that d is
a greatest common divisor of f and g, and write
d = gcd(f, g).
Although a gcd of two nonzero polynomials is not unique, thanks to the last
part of Bézout’s theorem any two gcd’s of them are associated. Thus, whenever
convenient we can take d to be monic, and we shall adopt such a usage from now
on without further notice.
Bézout’s theorem assures that if d = gcd(f, g), then there exists a, b ∈K[X]
such that
d = af + bg.
Nevertheless, the proof of that result gave no clue on how to effectively compute
such polynomials a and b. This issue will be dealt with in Problem 3, when we
show that Euclid’s algorithm remains true for polynomials.
Keeping with the parallelism to the notion of gcd in Z, we say that polynomials
f, g ∈K[X]\{0} are relatively prime if gcd(f, g) = 1. We then have the following
important consequence of Bézout’s theorem.
Corollary 19.3 If f, g ∈K[X] \ {0}, then f and g are relatively prime if and only
if there exist polynomials a, b ∈K[X] for which af + bg = 1.
Proof If gcd(f, g) = 1, then the existence of a, b ∈K[X] as stated above follows
directly from Bézout’s theorem.
Conversely, if d = gcd(f, g) and there exist a, b ∈K[X] such that af + bg = 1,
then, again from Bézout’s theorem, we have 1 ∈S = d K[X], i.e., d is a divisor of
the constant polynomial 1. Therefore, d = 1 up to association, so that 1 is a gcd of
f and g.
⊓⊔
Corollary 19.4 Let f, g ∈K[X] \ {0} be relatively prime and h ∈K[X] \ {0} be
such that ∂h < ∂(fg). Then, there exist a, b ∈K[X] such that a = 0 or ∂a < ∂g,
b = 0 or ∂b < ∂f and af + bg = h.
Proof By the previous corollary, there exist a1, b1 ∈K[X] such that a1f +b1g = 1.
Then, letting a2 = a1h and b2 = b1h, we have a2f + b2g = h. Now, the division
algorithm gives a2 = gq + a, with a = 0 or 0 ≤∂a < ∂g. Thus,
h = (gq + a)f + b2g = af + (qf + b2)g

454
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
and, letting b = qf + b2, we have h = af + bg, with a = 0 or ∂a < ∂g. Finally,
since bg = h −af , if b ̸= 0 we can compute
∂b + ∂g = ∂(bg) = ∂(h −af ) ≤∂h < ∂(fg) = ∂f + ∂g,
so that ∂b < ∂f .
⊓⊔
The coming deﬁnition is absolutely central for the rest of this chapter.
Deﬁnition 19.5 A polynomial p ∈K[X] \ K is irreducible over K if p cannot
be written as the product of two nonconstant polynomials in K[X]. A polynomial
p ∈K[X] \ K that is not irreducible is said to be reducible over K.
In general, it is useful to rephrase the irreducibility condition contrapositively.
This way, a polynomial p ∈K[X] \ K is irreducible if and only if the following
condition is satisﬁed:
p = gh, with g, h ∈K[X] ⇒g ∈K or h ∈K.
(19.1)
Let us now take a look at two simple examples.
Example 19.6 It follows immediately from (19.1) that every polynomial p ∈
K[X] of degree 1 is irreducible. Indeed, letting p = gh, with g, h ∈K[X],
Proposition 14.9 assures that ∂g + ∂h = ∂p = 1 and, hence, ∂g = 0 or ∂h = 0, i.e.,
g or h is constant. On the other hand, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 15.23
guarantees that the irreducible polynomials in C[X] are precisely those of degree 1.
Example 19.7 If p ∈R[X] is irreducible over R, then ∂p = 1 or 2. Indeed,
according to Problem 4, page 386, a complex number z is a root of p if and only if
so is z; then, let us consider two cases:
(a) ∂p ≥3 and p has at least one real root, say α: the root test (cf. Proposition 15.3)
allows us to write p(X) = (X −α)h(X), for some h ∈R[X] of degree greater
than or equal to 2, and p is reducible over R.
(b) ∂p ≥3 and p has two complex nonreal conjugate roots, say z and z: by invoking
the root test again, we have p(X) = (X −z)(X −z)h(X), for some h ∈C[X]
of degree at least 1. However, if z = a + bi and g(X) = (X −z)(X −z), then
g(X) = (X −a −bi)(X −a + bi) = (X −a)2 + b2 ∈R[X].
Hence, upon dividing p by g, the division algorithm assures that h ∈R[X].
Therefore, p = gh, with g, h ∈R[X] \ R, and p is reducible over R.
Thanks to the last example above, from now on we shall restrict our attention
to the irreducibility of polynomials over Q. In this sense, an argument analogous
to that of item (a) of the last example (cf. Problem 5) allows us to conclude that if
p ∈Q[X] has degree 2 or 3, then p is irreducible over Q if and only if it does not
have a rational root.

19.1
Unique Factorisation in Q[X]
455
Back to the general concept of irreducible polynomial, note that if p ∈Q[X] \ Q
is irreducible, then the only divisors of p in Q[X] are the constant polynomials and
those associated with p. This being said, we have the following important auxiliary
result, which is the analogue of Lemma 6.41 for polynomials.
Lemma 19.8 Let p ∈Q[X]\Q be irreducible. If f1, . . . , fk ∈Q[X]\{0} are such
that p | f1 . . . fk, then there exists 1 ≤i ≤k such that p | fi.
Proof By induction on k, it sufﬁces to show that if p | fg, with f, g ∈Q[X] \ {0},
then p | f or p | g. If p ∤f , we ﬁrst claim that gcd(f, p) = 1; indeed, if d =
gcd(f, p), then d | p, so that either d ∈Q or d is associated with p in Q[X].
However, if this last possibility holds, it follows from d | f that p | f too, which
is a contradiction. Therefore, d ∈Q and, up to association, we can suppose that
d = 1.
Now, Corollary 19.3 guarantees the existence of polynomials a, b ∈Q[X] such
that af + bp = 1, and hence
a(fg) + (bg)p = g.
Since p | (fg), it follows from the equality above and Problem 6 that p | g, as
wished.
⊓⊔
We shall now establish an analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
for polynomials over Q, thus showing that every polynomial f ∈Q[X] \ Q can be
uniquely written, up to association, as a product of a ﬁnite number of irreducible
polynomials.
Theorem 19.9 Every polynomial f ∈Q[X] \ Q can be written as a product of a
ﬁnite number of irreducible polynomials over Q. Moreover, such a decomposition
of f is unique in the following sense: if p1, . . . , pk, q1, . . . , ql ∈Q[X] \ Q are
irreducible and such that p1 . . . pk = q1 . . . ql, then k = l and, up to reordering, pi
and qi are associated in Q[X].
Proof For the existence part, let us make induction on ∂f , the case ∂f = 1 being
immediate (for we have already seen that, in this case, f is irreducible). As induction
hypothesis, assume that the result is true for every nonconstant polynomial with
rational coefﬁcients and degree less than n, and take f ∈Q[X]\Q such that ∂f = n.
If f is irreducible, there is nothing left to do. Otherwise, we can write f = gh, with
g, h ∈Q[X] \ Q. Thus, ∂g, ∂h < n, and the induction hypotheses guarantees
that each of g and h can be written as a product of a ﬁnite number of irreducible
polynomials with rational coefﬁcients, say g = p1 . . . pj and h = pj+1 . . . pk.
Then, f = gh = p1 . . . pjpj+1 . . . pk, a product of a ﬁnite number of irreducible
polynomials over Q.
For the uniqueness part, let p1 . . . pk = q1 . . . ql, with p1, . . . , pk, q1, . . . , ql ∈
Q[X] \ Q being irreducible over Q. If k = 1, we have p1 = q1 . . . ql, and the
irreducibility of p1 assures that l = 1. Similarly, l = 1 ⇒k = 1. Then, suppose
that k, l > 1; since pk | q1 . . . ql, Lemma 19.8 guarantees the existence of an index

1 ≤j ≤l such that pk | qj. Assume, without loss of generality, that j = l. Since ql
is irreducible over Q and pk /∈Q, the only possibility is that pk and ql be associated
in Q[X], say pk = uql, for some u ∈Q \ {0}. Then,
p1 . . . pk−1 = q1 . . . ql−2uql−1 = q′
1 . . . q′
l−1,
with q′
i = qi for 1 ≤i < l −2 and q′
l−1 = uql−1, all irreducible over Q.
Arguing by induction on max{k, l}, the induction hypothesis gives k −1 = l −1
and, up to reordering, pi associated to q′
i for 1 ≤i ≤l −1. Hence, up to reordering
pi and qi are also associated over Q, for 1 ≤i ≤k.
⊓⊔
We can summarize the previous result by saying that one has unique factorisation
in Q[X]. As within Z, if f ∈Q[X] \ Q is factorised as
f = p1 . . . pk,
with p1, . . . , pk ∈Q[X] \ Q irreducible, then, by gathering together the irreducible
factors pi which are equal up to association, we obtain
f = qα1
1 . . . qα1

(19.2)
with q1, . . . , ql ∈Q[X] \ Q irreducible and pairwise non associated, and α1, . . . ,
αl ∈N. Expression (19.2) (which is also unique up to association and reordering)
is the canonical factorisation of f in Q[X], and q1, . . . , ql are the irreducible
factors of f in Q[X].

On the Factorisation of Polynomials
19.2
Unique Factorisation in Z[X]
In the previous section, we studied the problem of unique factorisation for poly-
nomials with rational coefﬁcients. In this section, we extend the analysis of this
problem to polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. In this respect, the coming
deﬁnition will be crucial for all that follows.
Deﬁnition 19.10 The content of f ∈Z[X] \ {0}, denoted c(f ), is the gcd of
the nonvanishing coefﬁcients of f . If c(f ) = 1, we say that f is a primitive
polynomial in Z[X].
For the sake of notation, if f = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈Z[X] \ {0}, we shall
write
c(f ) = gcd(a0, . . . , an).
The coming lemma, whose proof we leave to the reader as an exercise (cf.
Problem 1), establishes two useful, albeit simple, properties of the content of
polynomials with integer coefﬁcients.
Lemma 19.11
(a) If f ∈Z[X] \ {0} and a ∈Z \ {0}, then c(af ) = |a| · c(f ). In particular, there
exists a primitive g ∈Z[X] \ {0} such that f = c(f )g.
(b) If f ∈Q[X]\{0}, then, up to multiplication by −1, there exist unique relatively
prime nonzero integers a, b and g ∈Z[X] primitive such that f = (a/b)g.
The importance of the concept of content for polynomials in Z[X] lies in the key
role it plays on the study of irreducibility of polynomials over Z, as we shall now
deﬁne.
Deﬁnition 19.12 A polynomial p ∈Z[X] \ Z is
irreducible1 over Z if p is
primitive and cannot be written as the product of two nonconstant polynomials of
Z[X]. A primitive polynomial p ∈Z[X] \ Z which is not irreducible is said to be
reducible over Z.
As in the previous section, it is useful to rephrase the irreducibility condition
for integer coefﬁcient nonconstant polynomials contrapositively, so that a primitive
polynomial p ∈Z[X] \ Z is irreducible if and only if the following condition is
satisﬁed:
p = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X] ⇒g = ±1 or h = ±1.
(19.3)
The coming result is known in mathematical literature as Gauss’ lemma.
1Although this deﬁnition is slightly more restrictive than that usually found in most textbooks, it
will be sufﬁcient for our purposes.

19.2
Unique Factorisation in Z[X]
459
Proposition 19.13 (Gauss)
For f, g ∈Z[X] \ Z, we have:
(a) c(fg) = c(f )c(g). In particular, fg is primitive if and only if2 so are f and g.
(b) If f is primitive, then f is irreducible in Z[X] if and only if it is irreducible in
Q[X].
(c) If f and g are primitive and associated in Q[X], then f = ±g.
Proof
(a) Lemma 19.11 shows that if f = c(f )f1 and g = c(g)g1, then f1, g1 ∈Z[X]
are primitive and fg = c(f )c(g)f1g1, so that c(fg) = c(f )c(g)c(f1g1).
Hence, it sufﬁces to show that f1g1 is primitive, or, which is the same, that
f, g primitive ⇔fg primitive.
If f is not primitive, then there exists a prime p ∈Z such that p divides all
of the coefﬁcient of f . Then, p divides all of the coefﬁcients of fg, and fg is
not primitive. Analogously, if g is not primitive, then fg is not primitive too.
Conversely, assume that f (X) = amXm + · · · + a1X + a0 and g(X) =
bnXn + · · · + b1X + b0 are both primitive, but fg is not. Take a prime p ∈Z
such that p divides all of the coefﬁcients of fg, and let k, l ≥0 be the smallest
indices such that p ∤ak, bl (such k and l do exist, for otherwise f or g would
not be primitive). Letting ck+l denote the coefﬁcient of Xk+l in fg, we have
ck+l = · · · + ak−2bl+2 + ak−1bl+1 + akbl + ak+1bl−1 + ak+2bl−2 + · · · .
Now, since p | ck+l and p | a0, . . . , ak−1, b0, . . . , bl−1, the above equality
guarantees that p | akbl, which is a contradiction.
(b) Implication ⇐) is clear. For the converse, take f ∈Z[X] \ Z primitive and
suppose that f is reducible in Q[X], say f = gh, with g, h ∈Q[X] \ Q.
Lemma 19.11 assures that we can take a, b, c, d ∈Z\{0} such that g = (a/b)g1
and h = (c/d)h1, with g1, h1 ∈Z[X] primitive. Then,
bdf = bg · dh = ag1 · ch1 = acg1h1.
However, since g1h1 is primitive by (a), taking contents in both sides of the
equality above we obtain |bd| · c(f ) = |ac|. Therefore, ac
bd = ±c(f ) ∈Z and,
once again from the equality above, f = ±c(f )g1h1, i.e., f is reducible in
Z[X].
(c) If f = (a/b)g, with a, b ∈Z \ {0}, then bf = ag, and taking contents we get
|b| · c(f ) = |a| · c(g). However, since c(f ) = 1 and c(g) = 1, it comes that
|a| = |b|, and hence a/b = ±1.
⊓⊔

On the Factorisation of Polynomials
We can ﬁnally state and prove another theorem of Gauss, which for integer
coefﬁcient polynomials is the analogue of Theorem 19.9.
Theorem 19.14 (Gauss) Every primitive polynomial f ∈Z[X] \ Z can be written
as a product of a ﬁnite number of irreducible polynomials in Z[X]. Moreover, such
a way of writing f is unique up to a reordering of the factors and multiplication of
some of them by −1.
Proof Let us start by establishing the existence of a factorisation of f as a product
of irreducible polynomials. To this end, looking at f as a polynomial in Q[X],
Theorem 19.9 assures the existence of irreducible polynomials p1, . . . , pk ∈Q[X]\
Q such that f = p1 . . . pk. Write pi = (ai/bi)qi, with ai, bi ∈Z \ {0} relatively
prime and qi ∈Z[X] \ Z primitive. Since qi is obviously also irreducible in Q[X],
item (b) of Gauss’ lemma guarantees that qi is irreducible in Z[X]. Letting a =
a1 . . . ak and b = b1 . . . bk, we then have
f = (a/b)q1 . . . qk.
However, since q1, . . . , qk are all primitive, item (a) of Gauss’ lemma guarantees
that q1 . . . qk is primitive too. Thus, taking contents in the last equality above, we
get
|b| = |b| · c(f ) = |a| · c(q1 . . . qk) = |a|.
It comes that a/b = ±1, and hence f
= q1 . . . qk, a product of irreducible
polynomials in Z[X].
The proof of the uniqueness part of the statement parallels that of Theorem 19.9,
once we show the following claim: if p, f, g ∈Z[X]\Z are such that p is irreducible
and p | fg in Z[X], then p | f or p | g in Z[X]. To this end, note ﬁrstly (from
item (b) of Gauss’ lemma) that p is also irreducible in Q[X]. In turn, this being so,
we already know that p | f or p | g in Q[X]. If p | f in Q[X] (the other case is
analogous), there exists f1 ∈Q[X] such that f = f1p. Choosing a, b ∈Z such
that f1 = (a/b)f2, with f2 ∈Z[X] \ Z primitive, we have
bf = bf1p = af2p.
Now, p and f2 primitive implies (once more from item (a) of Gauss’ lemma) f2p
primitive; taking contents in the equality above, we obtain |b|·c(f ) = |a|·c(f2p) =
|a|. Hence, a/b = ±c(f ) ∈Z, so that f1 ∈Z[X] and p | f in Z[X].
⊓⊔
Gauss’ theorem allows us to deﬁne the greatest common divisor of two polyno-
mials f, g ∈Z[X] \ Z. To this end, given f ∈Z[X] \ Z, start using Gauss’ theorem
to write
f = ±c(f )f n1
1 . . . f nk

with n1, . . . , nk ∈N and f1, . . . , fk ∈Z[X] being irreducible, pairwise non asso-
ciated and having positive leading coefﬁcients. This is the canonical factorisation
of f in Z[X].
Now, let g ∈Z[X] \ Z have canonical factorisation g = ±c(g)gm1

l . If
h ∈Z[X]\Z is irreducible, has positive leading coefﬁcient and is such that h | f, g,
then there exists 1 ≤i ≤k and 1 ≤j ≤l for which h = fi and h = gj, so that
fi = gj. In turn, this means that, up to a change of notation, we can write
f = ±c(f )hn1

Z+. We thus let, in Z[X],
gcd(f, g) = gcd(c(f ), c(g))ha1

with ai = min{ni, mi}, for 1 ≤i ≤k.

(a) d = gcd(f, g).
(b) If d′ ∈Z[X] divides f and g in Z[X], then d′ | d.
19.3
Polynomials Over Zp
We saw in Sect. 11.2 that, for a prime p ∈Z, the set Zp of congruence classes
modulo p can be furnished with operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division quite similar to those of C. In turn, thanks to such a resemblance,
essentially all of the concepts and results on polynomials studied so far remain true
within the set Zp[X] of polynomials with coefﬁcients in Zp.
Our purpose here is to make explicit comments on some similarities and
differences between polynomials over Zp and over K, with K = Q, R or C. In
this sense, we shall leave to the reader the task of checking that all of the other
deﬁnitions and results presented for K[X] (except those of Sects. 15.3 and 18.2 and

462
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
of Chap. 17) remain valid, ipsis literis, for Zp[X]. We also take the opportunity to
deduce, with the aid of polynomials over Zp, some results on Number Theory and
Combinatorics inaccessible by other means. In particular, we complete the proof
of the existence of primitive roots modulo p, thus completing the discussion of
Sect. 12.2.
Given f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈Z[X], we deﬁne Zp[X] to be the set
of formal expressions f of the form
f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0,
(19.4)
where a0, a1, . . . , an respectively denote the congruence classes of a0, a1, . . . , an
modulo p. As before, such an f is called a polynomial over Zp.
The correspondence f →f deﬁnes a map
πp : Z[X] −→Zp[X]
f
−→
f
which is obviously surjective and is called the canonical projection of Z[X] onto
Zp[X]. For f, g ∈Z[X], it is immediate to verify that
f (X) = g(X) in Zp[X]
⇕
∃h ∈Z[X]; f (X) = g(X) + ph(X) in Z[X].
Equivalently, letting
p Z[X] = {ph; h ∈Z[X]},
we have
f = 0 ⇔f ∈pZ[X].
We extend the operations of addition and multiplication in Zp to homonymous
operations +, · : Zp[X] × Zp[X] →Zp[X] by setting, for f, g ∈Z[X],
f + g = f + g and f · g = fg.
We leave to the reader the task of verifying the well deﬁniteness of these operations
in Zp[X], which can be done in a way entirely analogous to the well deﬁniteness of
the operations of Zp (cf. Sect. 11.2; see, also, Problem 1).
As in Z[X], we say that a polynomial f ∈Zp[X] \ {0} as in (19.4) has degree
n if an ̸= 0, i.e., if p ∤an. More generally, if f ∈Z[X] \ pZ[X], then f ̸= 0 and
∂f ≤∂f .

The two coming examples use the multiplication of Zp[X] to establish interesting
properties of binomial numbers.
Example 19.15 If p ∈Z is a prime number and k ∈N, prove that
pk
j

is a multiple
of p, for every integer 1 ≤j < pk.
Proof Example 6.42 shows that (X+1)p = Xp+1 in Zp[X]. Assume, by induction
hypothesis, that (X + 1)pl = Xpl + 1 in Zp[X] and for some l ∈N. Then, by
successively applying the initial case and the inductive hypothesis, we obtain
(X + 1)pl+1 =

(X + 1)ppl
= (Xp + 1)pl = (Xp)pl + 1 = Xpl+1 + 1.
Thus,
(X + 1)pk = Xpk + 1
for every k ∈N.
On the other hand, we also have
(X + 1)pk = Xpk +

⊓⊔
The next example makes use of the binary representation of natural numbers (cf.
Example 4.12 of [8] or Problem 11, page 163). For a generalization, see Problem 11.
Example 19.16 (Romania) Prove that the number of odd binomial coefﬁcients in
the n-th line of Pascal’s triangle is a power of 2.
Proof Let
n = 2ak + 2ak−1 + · · · + 2a1 + 2a0
be the binary representation of n, with 0 ≤a0 < a1 < . . . < ak. The previous
example allows us to write, in Z2[X],
(X + 1)n = (X + 1)2ak (X + 1)2ak−1 . . . (X + 1)2a0
= (X2ak + 1)(X2ak−1 + 1) . . . (X2a0 + 1).
(19.5)
Let S denote the set of natural numbers which can be written as a sum of (at
least one of) distinct powers of 2, chosen from 2ak, 2ak−1, . . . , 2a1 and 2a0. By the
fundamental principle of counting and the uniqueness of binary representation of
naturals, we have |S| = 2k+1 −1. On the other hand, by expanding the products of
the last expression in (19.5), we get

464
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
(X + 1)n =

satisfy
n

⊓⊔
In order to deﬁne the polynomial function associated to a polynomial f ∈Zp[X],
we have to take some care. Firstly, note that if f ∈Z[X] and a, b ∈Z satisfy
a ≡b (mod p), then item (c) of Proposition 10.6 guarantees that
f (a) ≡f (b) (mod p);
on the other hand, if f = g in Zp[X], we saw above that there exists h ∈Z[X] such
that f (X) = g(X) + ph(X). Hence, for a ∈Z we have
f (a) = g(a) + ph(a) ≡g(a) (mod p).
Given f ∈Zp[X], the above comments allow us to deﬁne the polynomial
function ˜f : Zp →Zp by setting, for a ∈Z,
˜f (a) = g(a),
(19.8)
where g ∈Z[X] is any polynomial for which f = g. Obviously, the image of ˜f
is a ﬁnite set, for Zp is itself ﬁnite. From now on, whenever there is no danger of
confusion, we shall write (19.8) simply as
f (a) = f (a).
The coming example shows that, contrary to what happens with polynomials
over Q, R or C, the polynomial function associated to a nonzero polynomial over
Zp[X] can vanish identically. In other words, it is no longer valid that two distinct
polynomials over Zp have distinct polynomial functions.
Example 19.17 The polynomial f (X) = Xp −X ∈Zp[X] is clearly a nonzero
element of Zp[X]. On the other hand, letting f : Zp →Zp denote its associated
polynomial function, Fermat’s little theorem gives

19.3
Polynomials Over Zp
465
f (a) = ap −a = ap −a = 0
for every a ∈Zp. Thus, f vanishes identically.
Let f ∈Z[X] and a ∈Z be given. As in Sect. 15.1, we say that a ∈Zp is a root
of f provided f (a) = 0. An easy review of the proof of the root test shows that
it continues to hold in Zp[X]. In particular, from the above example we obtain the
following important result.
Proposition 19.18 In Zp[X], we have
Xp−1 −1 = (X −1)(X −2) . . . (X −(p −1)).
Proof Since 1, 2, . . . , p −1 are roots of Xp−1 −1 in Zp (from the last example),
item (c) of Proposition 15.3 assures that the polynomial Xp−1 −1 is divisible by
(X −1)(X −2) . . . (X −(p −1)) in Zp[X]. However, since both such polynomials
are monic and have degree p −1, they are actually equal.
⊓⊔
In Zp[X], all of the deﬁnitions and results of Sect. 19.1 remain true. In particular,
we can state the following theorem, whose proof is entirely analogous to that of
Theorem 19.9.
Theorem 19.19 If p ∈Z is prime, then every polynomial f ∈Zp[X] \ Zp can
be written as a product of a ﬁnite number of irreducible polynomials over Zp.
Moreover, such a decomposition of f is unique up to association and reordering
of the irreducible factors.
As a ﬁrst application of the previous result, we shall now prove the existence of
primitive roots modulo p. For the statement and proof of the coming result, perhaps
the reader might want to review the material of Sect. 12.2.
Theorem 19.20 If p ∈Z is an odd prime and d is a positive divisor of p −1, then
the algebraic congruence
xp−1 −1 ≡0 (mod p)
(19.9)
has exactly ϕ(d) roots of order d, pairwise incongruent modulo p. In particular, p
has exactly ϕ(p −1) primitive roots pairwise incongruent modulo p.
Proof For a positive divisor d of p −1, let N(d) denote the number of roots of
the algebraic congruence (19.9) which are pairwise incongruent modulo p and have
order d. Since the roots of (19.9) are the integers 1, 2, . . . , p −1, and since by
Proposition 12.2 each of these numbers has order equal to a divisor of p −1, we
conclude that

0<d|(p−1)
N(d) = p −1.

466
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
If we show that N(d) ≤ϕ(d), Proposition 8.11 will give
p −1 =

0<d|(p−1)
N(d) ≤

0<d|(p−1)
ϕ(d) = p −1.
Therefore, we will obtain N(d) = ϕ(d) for every positive divisor d of p −1.
Then, let d be a positive divisor of p −1. If N(d) = 0, it is clear that N(d) ≤
ϕ(d). Otherwise, let a be an integer of order d modulo p; then, the congruence
classes 1, a, . . . , ad−1 ∈Zp are pairwise distinct roots of Xd −1 ∈Zp[X]. On the
other hand, Corollary 15.8 guarantees that such a polynomial has at most d distinct
roots in Zp, so that its roots are exactly 1, a, . . . , ad−1. Therefore, if α ∈Z is
a root of order d of (19.9), then α ∈Zp is a root of Xd −1 ∈Zp[X], so that
α ∈{1, a, . . . , ad−1}. We conclude that the roots of order d of (19.9) are precisely
the elements of order d of the set {1, a, . . . , ad−1} and, hence,
N(d) = #{0 ≤k ≤d −1; ordp(ak) = d}.
Item (c) of Proposition 12.5 counts the number of elements of the set in the right
hand side above: since ordp(a) = d, we have
ordp(ak) = d ⇔
d
gcd(d, k) = d ⇔gcd(d, k) = 1.
Therefore,
#{0 ≤k ≤d −1; ordp(ak) = d} = #{0 ≤k ≤d −1; gcd(d, k) = 1}
= ϕ(d).
The above argument has shown that either N(d) = 0 or ϕ(d), so that, in any
case, we have N(d) ≤ϕ(d), as wished.
For what is left to do, it sufﬁces to note that N(p −1) = ϕ(p −1), so that
there are exactly ϕ(p −1) integers, pairwise incongruent modulo p and with order
p −1 = ϕ(p) modulo p. In other words, there are precisely ϕ(p −1) pairwise
incongruent primitive roots modulo p. (For the sake of completeness, it is worth
noticing that this result agrees with that of Proposition 12.8.)
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by exhibiting yet another beautiful application of the theory
of polynomials over Zp to Number Theory.

3 (mod 4), prove that

1≤x̸=y≤p−1

Now, for each integer 1 ≤k ≤p−1

modulo p we get

(x2 + k2) ≡k2 
((ckx)2 + 1) ≡k2 
(x2 + 1).
Indeed, the ﬁrst congruence is immediate and, for the second one, it sufﬁces to
observe that {(ckx)2; 1 ≤x ≤p−1
2 } is a set of p−1
2
pairwise incongruent quadratic
residues modulo p; hence, also modulo p, we have
{(ckx)2; 1 ≤x ≤p −1

Let α be a primitive root modulo p and Q = 0(x2 + 1). Since {α2k; 1 ≤k ≤

2 } is a set of p−1
2
pairwise incongruent quadratic residues modulo p, we have
{α2k; 1 ≤k ≤p−1

In order to compute the residue of Q, modulo p, let f ∈Z[X] be deﬁned by
f (X) = (X −α2)(X −α4) . . . (X −αp−1),

so that
Q ≡(−1)
p−1
2 f (−1) ≡−f (−1) (mod p).
(Here we have used the fact that p ≡3 (mod 4) in the second congruence above.)
Now, observe that
f (X2) = (X −α)(X −α2) . . . (X −α
p−1
2 )(X + α)(X + α2) . . . (X + α
p−1
2 ).
For 1 ≤i, j ≤p−1
2 , if αi ≡−αj (mod p), then α2i ≡α2j (mod p) and, since α
is a primitive root modulo p, we obtain 2i = 2j, thus i = j; however this being
the case, we would have αi ≡−αi (mod p), which is an absurd. Then, the set
{±α, ±α2, . . . , ±α
p−1
2 } is a RRS modulo p, so that it coincides, modulo p, with
{1, 2, . . . , p −1}. Therefore, letting f ∈Zp[X] denote the image of f by the
projection of Z[X] onto Zp[X] and invoking the result of Proposition 19.18, we
arrive at
f (X2) = (X −1)(X −2) . . . (X −p −1) = Xp−1 −1
and, hence, at
f (X) = X
p−1

−1.
However, since p ≡3 (mod 4), this gives
Q = −f (−1) = −(−1)
p−1
2
+ 1 = 2,
i.e., Q ≡2 (mod p).
Finally, substituting this information in (19.10), we get the congruence 2

2 P ≡

2 (mod p), and hence P ≡1 (mod p).

19.4
More on Irreducible Polynomials
Up to this moment, we do not have at our disposal any method for establishing
the irreducibility of a given polynomial. Obviously, in particular cases one can
sometimes use the direct method, which consists in writing the given polynomial
f (say, in Z[X]) as a product of two other polynomials g, h ∈Z[X], and then
of solving the resulting system of equations in the coefﬁcients of g and h, thus
obtaining a nontrivial factorisation for f or reaching a contradiction. We illustrate
such a procedure in the coming example (see, also, Problems 1 and 2).
Example 19.22 Prove that f (X) = X4 + 10X3 + 5X + 1993 is irreducible over Q.
Proof By Gauss’ lemma (cf. Proposition 19.13), it sufﬁces to show that f cannot
be written as a product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients.
We now observe that 1993 is prime, a fact that can be easily established with the
aid of Eratosthenes’ sieve, for example. Hence, the rational roots test implies that
the possible integer roots of f are ±1 or ±1993, and direct checking shows that
none of these is actually a root.
We are left to discarding the possibility of f having a factorisation of the form
f (X) = (X2 + aX + b)(X2 + cX + d),
with a, b, c, d ∈Z. If such happens, then, by expanding the products at the right
hand side and comparing coefﬁcients, we obtain the following system of equations:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
a + c = 10
ac + b + d = 0
ad + bc = 5
bd = 1993
.
The fourth equation, together with the primality of 1993 and the symmetry of
the factorisation (two factors of degree 2) give (b, d) = (1, 1993) or (−1, −1993)

19.4
More on Irreducible Polynomials
471
as the only essentially distinct possibilities. From them, the ﬁrst and third equations
furnish the systems of equations
a + c = 10
a + 1993c = 5
or
a + c = 10
a + 1993c = −5 .
Finally, it is immediate to check that none of them has integer solutions.
⊓⊔
As testiﬁed by the calculations performed in the example above, the use of the
direct method to check that a given polynomial f ∈Q[X] is irreducible over
Q is likely to face considerable computational difﬁculties, even in the case of f
having integer coefﬁcients and small degree. Therefore, it would be quite nice to
develop a few techniques that could be effectively applied to the investigation of the
irreducibility of polynomials. In this sense, we start with the following result.
Proposition 19.23 Let f ∈Z[X] be monic, and p ∈Z be prime.
(a) If f ∈Zp[X] is irreducible in Zp[X], then f is irreducible in Z[X].
(b) If f (X) = (X −a)g(X), with g ∈Zp[X] irreducible, then either f is
irreducible in Z[X] or it has a root α ∈Z such that α ≡a (mod p).
Proof
(a) By contraposition, suppose f (X) = g(X)h(X), with g, h ∈Z[X] \ Z monic
polynomials. Then, f (X) = g(X)h(X), with ∂g = ∂g and ∂h = ∂h.
(b) Suppose f to be reducible, say f (X) = h(X)l(X), with h, l ∈Z[X] \ Z being
monic. Then, ∂h = ∂h, ∂l = ∂l and
(X −a)g(X) = h(X)l(X).
However, since g is irreducible in Zp[X], Theorem 19.19 assures that either h
or l must be associated to X −a, so that ∂h = 1 or ∂l = 1.
Assume, without loss of generality, that ∂h = 1. Then, h(X) = X −α, for
some α ∈Z, so that α is an integer root of f . Finally, since h(X) = X −a (for
h is monic and associated to X −a), it comes that α = a.
⊓⊔
Example 19.24 Let p ∈Z be prime, with p ≡5(mod 6), and k ∈N be such that
kp + 1 is also prime. Prove that f (X) = X3 + pX2 + pX + kp + 1 is irreducible
in Z[X].
Proof Projecting f into Zp[X], we obtain
f (X) = X3 + 1 = (X + 1)(X2 −X + 1).
We now claim that −1 is the only root of f in Zp. Indeed, if f (a) = 0, then
a3 = −1, so that a3 ≡−1 (mod p). Thus, a6 ≡1 (mod p), and hence (by Fermat’s
little theorem, together with item (b) of Proposition 12.2)
ord p(a) | gcd(6, p −1) = 2.

472
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
Therefore, ord p(a) = 1 or 2. Since ord p(a) = 1 ⇒a = 1, which is not a root of
f , we must have ord p(a) = 2. Then, a2 ≡1 (mod p) and a ̸≡1 (mod p), so that
a ≡−1 (mod p) or, which is the same, a = −1.
Since 3 ̸= 0 in Zp, the above claim guarantees that X2 −X + 1 has no roots in
Zp[X]; thus, it is irreducible in Zp[X]. The previous proposition then assures that
either f is irreducible in Z[X] or it has a root α ∈Z such that α ≡−1 (mod p).
However, the searching criterion for rational roots assures that an integer root α of f
must be a divisor of kp +1, which is prime. Then, either α = −1 or α = −(kp +1),
and testing these possibilities we conclude that none of them is actually a root of f .
Thus, f is irreducible.
⊓⊔
Remark 19.25 For a given p ∈N, we shall prove in Sect. 20.2 that there exist
inﬁnitely many k ∈Z for which kp + 1 is prime.
The corollary of the coming result of F. Eisenstein, known in mathematical
literature as Eisenstein’s criterion, will show to be a powerful ally in establishing
the irreducibility of certain polynomials of integer coefﬁcients.
Theorem 19.26 (Eisenstein) Let f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 be a polynomial
with integer coefﬁcients and degree n ≥1. Let also p ∈Z be prime and 1 ≤k < n
be an integer such that:
(a) p | a0, a1, . . . , ak.
(b) p2 ∤a0 and p ∤an.
If f = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X], then max{∂g, ∂h} ≥k + 1.
Proof Letting g(X) = brXr + · · · + b0 and h(X) = csXs + · · · + c0, we have
an = brcs and a0 = b0c0. Therefore,
p ∤an ⇒p ∤brcs ⇒p ∤br and p ∤cs,
so that, in Zp[X], we have f (X) = g(X)h(X), with ∂g = ∂g = r and ∂h = ∂h = s.
If X | g(X) and X | h(X) in Zp[X], then p | b0 and p | c0 in Z, so that
p2 | b0c0 = a0, which is not the case; hence, in Zp[X], the polynomial X divides
at most one of g or h.
Assume, without loss of generality, that X does not divide h. Since (by
hypothesis (b))
g(X)h(X) = f (X) = anXn + · · · + ak+1Xk+1
= (anXn−k−1 + · · · + ak+1)Xk+1,
we thus conclude that Xk+1 | g(X). Thus, r ≥k + 1.
⊓⊔

Corollary 19.27 (Eisenstein) Let f (X) = anXn +· · ·+a1X+a0 be a polynomial
with integer coefﬁcients and degree n ≥1. If there exists p ∈Z prime such that
p | a0, a1, . . . , an−1, p2 ∤a0 and p ∤an, then f is irreducible in Q[X].
Proof By Eisenstein’s theorem, if f (X) = g(X)h(X), with g, h ∈Z[X], then
either ∂g ≥n or ∂h ≥n, i.e., either g or h is constant. Thus, f cannot be written
as a product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients, and Gauss’
lemma guarantees that f is irreducible in Q[X].
⊓⊔
The coming example brings a classical application of Eisenstein’s criterion,
which will be obtained by other means in Sect. 20.2.
Example 19.28 If p ∈Z is prime and f ∈Z[X] is given by
f (X) = Xp−1 + Xp−2 + · · · + X + 1,
(19.11)
then f is irreducible in Q.
Proof We start by noticing that f (X) = g(X)h(X) if and only if f (X + 1) =
g(X + 1)h(X + 1), with g(X) and g(X + 1) (as well as h(X) and h(X + 1)) having
equal degrees. Thus, it sufﬁces to show that f (X + 1) is irreducible in Q[X].
Since (X −1)f (X) = Xp −1, we obtain
Xf (X + 1) = (X + 1)p −1 = Xp +

that f (X + 1) is irreducible in Q[X].
⊓⊔
Our second example uses the full force of Eisenstein’s theorem.
Example 19.29 (IMO) Given a natural number n > 1, prove that the polynomial
Xn + 5Xn−1 + 3 is irreducible in Z[X].
Proof Let Xn + 5Xn−1 + 3 = g(X)h(X), with g, h ∈Z[X] monic. With p = 3 in
Eiseinstein’s theorem, we conclude that
max{∂g, ∂h} ≥n −1,
so that either f is irreducible or it has an integer root.

474
19
On the Factorisation of Polynomials
On the other hand, if this last possibility takes place, then the searching criterion
for rational roots assures that such a root is ±1 or ±3. However, direct computation
shows that none of these four numbers is a root of the given polynomial.
⊓⊔
In spite of the theory developed above, we frequently establish the irreducibility
of a given polynomial by invoking ad hoc methods. Let us take a look at two such
examples.
Example 19.30 (Romania) Let f ∈Z[X] be a monic polynomial of degree n ≥1
and such that f (0) = 1. If f has at least n −1 complex roots of modulus less than
1, prove that f is irreducible in Q[X].
Proof By Gauss’ lemma, it sufﬁces to show that f is irreducible in Z[X]. To this
end, and for the sake of contradiction, assume that f = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X] \ Z.
Without any loss of generality, we can take g and h to be monic; moreover, from
g(0)h(0) = 1 we get g(0), h(0) = ±1. On the other hand, Girard-Viète relations
(cf. Proposition 16.6) assure that the modulus of the product of the complex roots of
f is equal to 1, so that the hypotheses of the example guarantee that f has exactly
one complex root of modulus greater than 1. Hence, one of the polynomials g or h,
say g, has only complex roots of modulus less than 1. However, since g is monic and
|g(0)| = 1, by invoking Girard-Viète relations again, we conclude that the modulus
of the product of the complex roots of g is equal to 1, which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Remark 19.31 Some complex analysis assures that polynomials f ∈Z[X] satisfy-
ing the hypotheses of the previous example can be easily constructed. For instance,
let f (X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈Z[X] be such that
|an−1| > |an| + |an−2| + |an−3| + · · · + |a0|.
(19.12)
If |z| = 1, then the triangle inequality for complex numbers gives
|f (z) −an−1zn−1| = |anzn + an−2zn−2 + · · · + a1z + a0|
≤|an| + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|
< |an−1| = |an−1zn−1|.
In particular, f does not vanish on the unit circle |z| = 1 of the complex plane, and
Rouché’s theorem (cf. [11], page 125) assures that f has exactly n −1 complex
roots of modulus less than 1. Of course, the extra requirement that an = a0 = 1
does not preclude the validity of (19.12).
Example 19.32 (IMO Shortlist) Let n > 1 be an odd integer and a1, . . . , an be
pairwise distinct given integers. Show that
f (X) = (X −a1)(X −a2) . . . (X −an) −1
is irreducible in Q[X].

19.4
More on Irreducible Polynomials
475
Proof Once more Gauss’ lemma reduces the problem to showing that f cannot be
written as the product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. By
contradiction, assume we have f = gh, with g and h being nonconstant, monic
polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. Since
g(ai)h(ai) = f (ai) = −1
and g(ai), h(ai) ∈Z, we must have g(ai) = 1 and h(ai) = −1, or vice-versa; in
any event, it happens that g(ai) + h(ai) = 0. Now, let f1 = g + h. Since g and h
are monic, f1 does not vanish identically. Therefore,
∂f1 ≤max{∂g, ∂h} < ∂f = n,
so that f1 has at most ∂f1 < n complex roots, counted according with their
multiplicities. However, since f1(ai) = 0 for 1 ≤i ≤n and a1, . . . , an are pairwise
distinct, we have arrived at a contradiction.

a polynomial f ∈Z[X], prove that f is irreducible over Z. More precisely,
let n > 1 be an integer and a0, a1, . . . , an−1, an be natural numbers such that
an ̸= 0 and 0 ≤ai ≤9 for 0 ≤i ≤n. If f (10) is prime, prove that f is
irreducible over Z.

Chapter 20
Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
We start this chapter by inverting the viewpoint of Chap. 15. More precisely, we
ﬁx a complex number z and examine the set of polynomials f ∈C[X] for which
f (z) = 0. As a byproduct of our discussion, we give a (hopefully) more natural
proof of the closedness, with respect to the usual arithmetic operations, of the set of
complex numbers which are roots of nonzero polynomials of rational coefﬁcients.
We then proceed to investigate the special case of roots of unity, which leads us to
the study of cyclotomic polynomials and allows us to give a partial proof of a famous
theorem of Dirichlet on the inﬁnitude of primes on certain arithmetic progressions.
The chapter closes with a few remarks on the set of real numbers which are not roots
of nonzero polynomials with rational coefﬁcients.
20.1
Algebraic Numbers Over Q
A complex number α is said to be algebraic over Q if there exists a polynomial
f ∈Q[X] \ {0} such that f (α) = 0. A complex number which is not algebraic over
Q is said to be transcendental over Q. In this section and the next one we stick to
the case of algebraic numbers, leaving a few word on transcendental numbers to be
said in Sect. 20.4.
Obviously, every rational number r, being a root of the polynomial X −r ∈
Q[X] \ {0}, is algebraic over Q. In turn, the coming example collects less trivial
instances of algebraic numbers over Q.
Example 20.1 Let r ∈Q∗
+ and n ∈N. If ω is an n-th root of unity, then
n√rω
is algebraic over Q, for such a number is a root of the nonzero polynomial with
rational coefﬁcients Xn −r.
We could have also deﬁned, in an obvious way, what one means by a complex
number α to be algebraic over R. Nevertheless, such a concept would not be

interesting, for every complex number is algebraic over R. Indeed, give a nonreal
complex number α = a + ib, we have that α is a root of the nonzero polynomial
f (X) = (X −(a + bi))(X −(a −bi))
= X2 −2aX + (a2 + b2) ∈R[X].
For this reason, whenever we consider an algebraic number over Q, we shall simply
refer to it as an algebraic number.1
If a complex number α is algebraic, the set
Aα = {f ∈Q[X] \ {0}; f (α) = 0}
is nonempty by deﬁnition. Then, it is also nonempty the set of nonnegative integers
{∂f ; f ∈Aα}, so that there exists pα ∈Aα, monic and of minimum degree. We
thus have the following
Deﬁnition 20.2 Given a complex number α algebraic over Q, a polynomial pα ∈
Q[X] \ {0}, monic, of minimum degree and having α as a root is called a minimal
polynomial for α.
The coming proposition and its corollaries collect the most important properties
of minimal polynomials of algebraic numbers.
Proposition 20.3 If α ∈C is algebraic over Q and pα is a minimal polynomial of
α, then:
(a) pα is irreducible over Q.
(b) If f ∈Q[X] is such that f (α) = 0, then pα | f in Q[X].
In particular, pα is uniquely determined by α.
Proof
(a) If we had pα = fg, with f and g being nonconstant and of rational coefﬁcients,
then the degrees of f and g would be less than that of pα and at least one of
them would have α as a root. In turn, this would contradict the minimality of
the degree of pα. Therefore, pα is irreducible over Q.
(b) By the division algorithm, there exist polynomials q, r ∈Q[X] such that
f (X) = pα(X)q(X) + r(X),
with r = 0 or 0 ≤∂r < ∂pα. If r ̸= 0, then
r(α) = f (α) −pα(α)q(α) = 0,
with ∂r < ∂pα, and this would again be a contradiction to the minimality of the
degree of pα. Thus, r = 0 and, hence, pα | f in Q[X].
1Nevertheless, we shall brieﬂy consider algebraic numbers over Zp in Sect. 20.3.

20.1
Algebraic Numbers Over Q
479
Finally, if pα and qα were minimal polynomials for α, then item (b) would
give pα | qα in Q[X]. However, since pα and qα are both monic and of the same
degree, it would come that pα = qα.
⊓⊔
Thanks to the former proposition, given α ∈C algebraic, we can refer to pα as
being the minimal polynomial of α.
Corollary 20.4 If α ∈C is algebraic and f ∈Q[X] \ {0} is a monic, irreducible
polynomial such that f (α) = 0, then f = pα.
Proof By the previous result, pα divides f in Q[X]. However, since f is irreducible,
there must exist a nonzero rational number c such that f = cpα. Finally, since f
and pα are both monic, we must have c = 1.
⊓⊔
Corollary 20.5 If f ∈Q[X] \ Q is irreducible, then f has no multiple roots.
Proof We can assume, without any loss of generality, that f is monic. If some α ∈
C is a multiple root of f , then Proposition 15.31 would guarantee that α is also
a root of the derivative f ′ of f . However, since f ∈Q[X] \ {0} is monic and
irreducible, Corollary 20.4 assures that it is the minimal polynomial of α. Therefore,
Proposition 20.3 gives f | f ′ in Q[X], which is a contradiction to the inequality
∂f > ∂f ′.
⊓⊔
We now collect some interesting applications of Proposition 20.3 and its
corollaries.
Example 20.6 (IMO Shortlist) Let f be a nonconstant polynomial of rational
coefﬁcients and α a real number such that α3 −3α = f (α)3 −3f (α) = −1.
Prove that, for every positive integer n, one has
f (n)(α)3 −3f (n)(α) = −1,
where f (n) stands for the composite of f with itself, n times.
Proof If g(X) = X3 −3X + 1, then ∂g = 3 and, searching rational roots (cf.
Proposition 15.16), we conclude that g has none. Hence, Problem 5, page 457,
guarantees that g is irreducible over Q, and Corollary 20.4 assures that g is the
minimal polynomial of α.
On the other hand, since we are assuming that the polynomial g ◦f also has α
as a root, Proposition 20.3 show that g divides g ◦f in Q[X], say (g ◦f )(X) =
g(X)u(X), for some u(X) ∈Q[X].
Finally, note that we have g(f (α)) = 0 by assumption. Hence, if we have proved
that g(f (k)(α)) = 0 for some k ≥1, then
g(f k+1(α)) = (g ◦f )(f k(α)) = g(f k(α))u(f k(α)) = 0,
and there is nothing left to do.

Example 19.28, in conjunction with Corollary 20.4, immediately assures that if
p is prime and ω = cis 2π
p , then the minimal polynomial of ω is
pω(X) = Xp−1 + Xp−2 + · · · + X + 1.
The coming example uses this fact to give a beautiful alternative proof of Exam-
ple 11.5, due to the Bulgarian mathematician N. Nikolov.
Example 20.7 (IMO) Let p be an odd prime. Compute how many are the p-element
subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , 2p} such that the sum of its elements is divisible by p.
Solution If ω = cis 2π

(20.1)
with the above sum ranging through all p-element subsets {j1, . . . , jp} of I2p =
{1, 2, . . . , 2p}.
On the other hand, if for 0 ≤k ≤p −1 we let ck denote the number of p-
element subsets {j1, . . . , jp} ⊂I2p for which j1 + · · · + jp ≡k (mod p), then
ωp = 1 assures that the right hand side of (20.1) can be written as p−1
k=0 ckωk, so
that

has p elements and sum of elements congruent to p −1 modulo p, we have cp−1 ̸=
0. Hence, ∂f = p −1.
Now, since the minimal polynomial of ω is pω(X) = Xp−1 + · · · + X + 1, item
(b) of Proposition 20.3 guarantees that f is an integer multiple of pω, say f = cpω,
for some c ∈N. In particular, by comparing coefﬁcients on both sides of such an
equality, we conclude that
c0 −2 = c1 = · · · = cp−1 = c.
Finally, in order to compute the value of c, note that c0 +c1 +· · ·+cp−1 is equal
to the total number of p-element subsets of I2p, so that

Example 20.8 (Romania) Let f ∈Z[X] be a monic polynomial, of odd degree
greater than 1 and irreducible over Q. Suppose also that:
(a) f (0) is square-free.
(b) The complex roots of f have modulus greater than or equal to 1.
Prove that the polynomial F ∈Z[X], given by F(X) = f (X3), is also irreducible
over Q.
Proof By contradiction, assume that F is reducible over Q. Then, it follows from
Problem 2, page 461, that there exist monic and nonconstant polynomials g, h ∈
Z[X] such that F = gh. Since ∂F = 3∂f and ∂f is odd, we conclude that ∂F is
also odd. Hence, Problem 5, page 386, guarantees that F has at least one real root α.
We can assume, without loss of generality, that α is a root of g and that g is
irreducible over Q. Indeed, if α is a root of g but g is reducible over Q, it sufﬁces
to take the monic irreducible factor of g having α as a root, and then to use the
result of Problem 2, page 461 to conclude that such an irreducible factor has integer
coefﬁcients.
In the conditions of the previous paragraph, we know that g is the minimal
polynomial of α. Now, if ω ̸= 1 is a cubic root of 1, then
0 = F(α) = f (α3) = f ((αω)3) = F(αω) = g(αω)h(αω).

482
20
Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
We therefore distinguish two cases:
(i) g(αω) = 0:
since (cf. Problem 4, page 386) the nonreal roots of a real
polynomial come in pairs complex-complex conjugate, we have that αω = αω2
is also a root of g. Now, by grouping together in the expression of g all
monomials with exponents of each one of the forms 3k, 3k + 1 and 3k + 2,
we can write
g(X) = a(X3) + Xb(X3) + X2c(X3),
(20.2)
with a, b, c ∈Z[X]. Therefore,
a(α3) + αb(α3) + α2c(α3) = g(α) = 0,
a(α3) + αωb(α3) + α2ω2c(α3) = g(αω) = 0
and
a(α3) + αω2b(α3) + α2ωc(α3) = g(αω2) = 0.
Since the three equalities above for a Vandermond system of equations in a(α3),
b(α3) and c(α3), we conclude from Proposition 18.6 (or by direct computation)
that a(α3) = b(α3) = c(α3) = 0. Thus, letting p denote the minimal polynomial
of α3, it follows from Proposition 20.3 that p divides a, b and c in Q[X] and,
hence (again from Problem 4, page 386), in Z[X]. It follows from (20.2) that
p(X3) divides g(X). However, since g is monic and irreducible, we conclude
that g(X) = p(X3).
Now, with g being a polynomial in X3, it follows once more from (20.2) that
b, c = 0 and, hence, that
f (X3) = F(X) = g(X)h(X) = a(X3)h(X).
Such an equality, in turn, implies that h must also be a polynomial in X3, say
h(X) = l(X3), for some l ∈Z[X].
Finally, we have f (X3) = a(X3)l(X3) and, hence, f = gl, with ∂g, ∂l ≥1. But
this contradicts the irreducibility of f .
(ii) h(αω) = 0:
as in item (i), we conclude that h(αω2) = 0. Let, also as above,
h(X) = a(X3) + Xb(X3) + X2c(X3),
with a, b, c ∈Z[X]. Then,
a(α3) + αωb(α3) + α2ω2c(α3) = h(αω) = 0
and
a(α3) + αω2b(α3) + α2ωc(α3) = h(αω2) = 0.
Multiplying the ﬁrst of the equalities above by ω and subtracting the second from
the result, we obtain
a(α3) −α2c(α3) = 0.

20.1
Algebraic Numbers Over Q
483
However, since g is the minimal polynomial of α, by invoking Proposition 20.3
once again we conclude that g divides a(X3) −X2c(X3) in Q[X] and, hence, in
Z[X] (by Remark 14.13, for g ∈Z[X] and is monic).
Substituting X by 0, we conclude that g(0) must divide a(0) in Z. Letting a(0) =
g(0)m, with m ∈Z, it comes that
f (0) = g(0)h(0) = g(0)a(0) = g(0)2m.
Since f (0) is square-free, it follows that g(0) = ±1. Hence, letting z1, . . . , zk be
the complex roots of g, the relations of Girard-Viète give
1 = |g(0)| = |z1| . . . |zk|.
(20.3)
On the other hand, since
f (z3
j) = F(zj) = g(zj)h(zj) = 0,
hypothesis (b) gives |z3
j| ≥1, so that |zj| ≥1 for 1 ≤j ≤k. In turn, such
an information, together with (20.3), allows us to conclude that |zj| = 1 for
1 ≤j ≤k. In particular, |α| = 1 and, being a real number, we must have
α = ±1. Thus, α3 = ±1 and, since f is irreducible over Q with f (α3) = 0, we
should have f (X) = X ± 1, a contradiction to the fact that ∂f > 1.
⊓⊔
The rest of this section is devoted to showing that the set of algebraic numbers is a
subﬁeld of C, i.e., that it is a nonempty subset of C which is closed for the operations
of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (by a nonzero algebraic number,
of course). We follow [7], and start with the following result.
Theorem 20.9 If α, β ∈C \ {0} are algebraic, then so is α + β.
Proof Let α = α1, . . . , αm be the complex roots of pα and β = β1, . . . , βn be those
of pβ, so that
pα(X) =

m

pβ(X −Xσ(i)) =

pβ(X −Xi)


k=0
fk(Xσ(1), . . . , Xσ(m))Xk = Xmn +
mn−1

k=0
fk(X1, . . . , Xm)Xk.
Therefore, we have
fk(Xσ(1), . . . , Xσ(m)) = fk(X1, . . . , Xm)
for all 0 ≤k ≤mn −1 and σ, and we conclude that fk is a symmetric polynomial
in X1, . . . , Xm, for 0 ≤k ≤mn −1.
Newton’s Theorem 16.12 then assures the existence of polynomials gk
∈
Q[X1, . . . , Xm] for which
fk(X1, . . . , Xm) = gk(s1, . . . , sm),
with s1, . . . , sm ∈Q[X1, . . . , Xm] standing for the elementary symmetric polyno-
mials in X1, . . . , Xm. In particular,
fk(α1, . . . , αm) = gk(s1(αi), . . . , sm(αi)) ∈Q,
for
pα(X) = Xm −s1(αi)Xm−1 + · · · + (−1)msm(αi) ∈Q[X].
Thus, if h(X) = f (X, α1, . . . , αm) then, on the one hand,
h(X) = Xmn +

fk(α1, . . . , αm)Xk ∈Q[X]

Therefore, h is a nonzero polynomial with rational coefﬁcients and such that h(α +
β) = 0, which guarantees that α + β is algebraic.
⊓⊔
Remark 20.10 Suppose that pα, pβ ∈Z[X]. Then, in the notations of the above
proof, we have s1(αi), . . . , sm(αi) ∈Z and fk ∈Z[X1, . . . , Xm] for 0 ≤k ≤
mn −1. Therefore, once more from Newton’s theorem, gk ∈Z[X1, . . . , Xm] and,
hence,
fk(α1, . . . , αm) = gk(s1(αi), . . . , sm(αi)) ∈Z
for 0 ≤k ≤mn −1. We thus conclude that h ∈Z[X], and Problem 4 shows that
pα+β ∈Z[X].
In order to show that the set of algebraic numbers is closed for products and
quotients, we need the following particular case of Problem 4, page 416, for which
we present a simpler proof.
Lemma 20.11 If α ̸= 0 is algebraic, then so are α−1 and α2.
Proof Let f (X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈Q[X] \ Q be such that
a0 ̸= 0 and f (α) = 0. Then, g(X) = a0Xn + a1Xn−1 + · · · + an−1X + an is a
nonconstant polynomial with rational coefﬁcients, and it is immediate to check that
g(α−1) = 0.
For α2, notice that there exist u, v ∈Q[X], at least one of which nonzero and
such that
f (X) = u(X2) + Xv(X2).
Letting h(X) = u(X)2 −Xv(X)2, we have h ∈Q[X] \ {0} and
h(α2) = u(α2)2 −α2v(α2)2
= (u(α2) −αv(α2))(u(α2) + αv(α2))
= (u(α2) −αv(α2))f (α) = 0.
⊓⊔
Theorem 20.12 If α, β ∈C \ {0} are algebraic, then so are αβ and α
β .
Proof By the previous lemma, α2 and β2 are algebraic. However, since we already
know that α + β is algebraic, it follows once more from the previous lemma that
(α + β)2 is algebraic too. Now, since
αβ = 1
2((α + β)2 −α2 −β2),
two applications of Theorem 20.9, together with the result of Problem 1, assure that
αβ is also algebraic.

For what is left to do, note that α
β = α · 1
β , with 1
β being algebraic by the previous
lemma. Hence, the ﬁrst part above guarantees that α
β is algebraic.

(ii) φ(uv) = φ(u)φ(v).
20.2
Cyclotomic Polynomials
The theory of polynomials over Zp, p prime, allows us to present some of the most
elementary properties of the so-called cyclotomic polynomials; in particular, we will
show that such polynomials are precisely the minimal polynomials of the complex
roots of unity. As a byproduct of our study, we will use cyclotomic polynomials to
prove a particular case of Dirichlet’s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.
Given n ∈N, recall from Deﬁnition 13.23 that the primitive n-th roots of unity
are the complex numbers of the form ωk
n, with ωn = cis 2π
n and 1 ≤k ≤n being
relatively prime with n. In particular, there are exactly ϕ(n) primitive n-th roots of
unity, where ϕ : N →N stands for the Euler function. Given m, n ∈N, whenever
there is no danger of confusion we shall write simply (m, n) to denote the gcd of m
and n.
Deﬁnition 20.13 For n ∈N, the n-th cyclotomic polynomial is the polynomial
n(X) =

1≤k≤n
(k,n)=1
(X −ωk
n).
(20.5)
It follows from the above deﬁnition that n is monic with degree ∂n = ϕ(n).
The coming proposition collects other elementary properties of n.
Proposition 20.14 For n ∈N, we have:
(a) Xn −1 = 0
0<d|n d(X).
(b) n ∈Z[X].

(X −ωj
n) = Xn −1.
(b) Let us make induction on n ∈N, beginning with 1(X) = X−1 ∈Z[X]. Given
a natural number n > 1, assume, by induction hypothesis, that m ∈Z[X] for
every integer 1 ≤m < n. Then, if
g(X) =

1≤d<n
d|n
d(X),
we have g ∈Z[X] and, by (a), Xn −1 = n(X)g(X). Since g is monic
(for we already know that each m is monic), Remark 14.13 guarantees that
n ∈Z[X].
(c) For n = 2 this is a direct computation; for n > 2, apply the result of Problem 3,
page 345. Alternatively, arguing once more by induction, start by noticing that
X2 −1 = 1(X)2(X) = (X −1)2(X);
hence, 2(X) = X + 1 and 2(0) = 1. Let n > 2 and suppose, as induction
hypothesis, that m(0) = 1 for every integer 2 ≤m < n. Then, in the notations
of the proof of (b), we have
g(0) = 1(0)

1<d<n
d|n
d(0) = (−1)

1<d<n
d|n
d(0) = −1,
and it follows from Xn −1 = n(X)g(X) that
−1 = n(0)g(0) = −n(0),
as wished.

so that
p(X) = Xp−1 + Xp−2 + · · · + X + 1.
⊓⊔
Example 19.28 has shown that p is irreducible over Q, so that p is the
minimal polynomial of ωp. Theorem 20.18 generalizes this fact by proving that,
for every n ∈N, the minimal polynomial of ωn coincides with the n-th cyclotomic
polynomial n. We ﬁrst need to establish a simple auxiliary result.
Lemma 20.16 Let f, g ∈Z[X] and p ∈Z be a prime number. If g ∈Zp[X] \ Zp
and g2 | f in Zp[X], then g | f ′ in Zp[X].
Proof If h ∈Z[X] is such that f = g2h in Zp[X], we know that there exists a
polynomial l ∈Z[X] such that
f (X) = g(X)2h(X) + pl(X)
in Z[X]. Computing derivatives at both sides of this equality, we obtain
f ′(X) = 2g(X)g′(X)h(X) + g(X)2h′(X) + pl′(X)
in Z[X], and hence
f ′(X) = g(X)

2 g′(X)h(X) + g(X)h′(X)

in Zp[X]. Therefore, g | f ′ in Zp[X].
⊓⊔
For our next result, recall that if ω is an n-th root of unity, then Proposition 20.3
guarantees that its minimal polynomial pω divides Xn−1 in Q[X]. Then, Problem 4,
page 486, assures that pω ∈Z[X].
Proposition 20.17 Let n, p ∈N be such that p is prime and p ∤n. If ω is an n-th
root of unity, then pω(X) = pωp(X).
Proof Let ζ
= ωp. Since both ω and ζ are roots of Xn −1, item (b) of
Proposition 20.3 shows that both pω and pζ divide Xn−1. By contradiction, assume
that pω ̸= pζ. Then, the irreducibility of these polynomials assures, via Gauss’
Theorem 19.14, that pωpζ divides Xn −1 in Z[X], say
Xn −1 = pω(X)pζ(X)u(X)
(20.6)
for some u ∈Z[X].
If g(X) = pζ(Xp), then
g(w) = pζ(ωp) = pζ(ζ) = 0

so that (once more by Proposition 20.3) pω divides g in Z[X]. Let v ∈Z[X] be such
that pωv = g. In Zp[X], Problem 5, page 469 gives
pω(X)v(X) = g(X) = pζ(Xp) =

pζ(X)
p ,
and Theorem 19.19 guarantees the existence of a monic and irreducible polynomial
h ∈Zp[X] such that h | pω, pζ in Zp[X]. It follows from (20.6) that h(X)2 |
(Xn −1) in Zp[X], and the previous lemma gives that h(X) | nXn−1 in Zp[X].
However, since h is monic and n ̸= 0, by applying once again Theorem 19.19 we
obtain 1 ≤l ≤n −1 such that h(X) = Xl in Zp[X]. Hence, h(X) ∤(Xn −1) in
Zp[X], which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
We can ﬁnally state and prove the desired result.
Theorem 20.18 If ωn = cis 2π
n , then pωn = n. In particular, n ∈Z[X] is
irreducible in Q[X].
Proof Take k ∈N such that k > 1 and gcd(k, n) = 1, and let k = p1 . . . pl,
with p1, . . . , pl being primes not dividing n. Repeated applications of the previous
proposition give us
pωn = pωp1
n = pωp1p2
n
= · · · = pωp1...pl
n
= pωkn.
In particular, the ϕ(n) complex numbers ωk
n, with 1 ≤k ≤n and gcd(k, n) = 1, are
distinct roots of pωn, so that
∂pωn ≥ϕ(n) = ∂n.
However, since n is monic, has integer (thus rational) coefﬁcients and ωn as a root,
the deﬁnition of minimal polynomial assures that pωn = n.
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by proving a particular case of the famous Dirichlet’s
theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. This theorem states that an inﬁnite
nonconstant arithmetic progression of natural numbers contains inﬁnitely many
prime numbers, provided its ﬁrst term and common difference are relatively prime.
Although Dirichlet’s theorem is a natural generalization of Euclid’s Theorem 6.38,
its known proofs are far beyond the scope of most undergraduate curricula in
Mathematics. Nevertheless, the fragments of the theory of cyclotomic polynomials
developed so far allow us to present an elementary proof of Dirichlet’s theorem, in
the particular case of an arithmetic progression whose ﬁrst term is equal to 1.
Theorem 20.19 (Dirichlet)
If n ∈N, then the arithmetic progression 1, 1+n, 1+
2n, . . . contains inﬁnitely many primes.
Proof Let p1, . . . , pk be any primes and n denote the n-th cyclotomic poly-
nomial. Since n is monic, choosing a sufﬁciently large integer y we have
n(ynp1 . . . pk) > 1. Therefore, letting a = ynp1 . . . pk, we have modulo a that
n(a) ≡n(0) = 1 (mod a).

20.2
Cyclotomic Polynomials
491
Hence, n(a) = aq + 1 = ynp1 . . . pkq + 1, for some q ∈N. If p is a prime
factor of n(a), then p ̸= p1, . . . , pk and gcd(p, n) = 1. Therefore, if we prove
that p ≡1 (mod n), it will follow that p is a prime in our arithmetic progression,
distinct from p1, . . . , pk.
For what is left to do, note that gcd(p, a) = 1, and let t := ord p(a). Since
p | n(a) and n(a) | (an −1) (for n(X) | (Xn −1) in Z[X]), we conclude that
an ≡1 (mod p); thus, item (c) of Proposition 12.2 shows that t | n. If we prove
that t = n then, again from item (c) of Proposition 12.2, together with ap−1 ≡
1 (mod p), we obtain n | (p −1) or, which is the same, p ≡1 (mod n).
For c ∈{a, a + p}, it follows from at ≡1 (mod p) that ct ≡1 (mod p). By the
sake of contradiction, assume that t < n. Proposition 20.14, together with the fact
that t | n, furnishes
cn −1 =

0<d|n
d(c) = n(c)

0<d<n
d|n
d(c)
= n(c)h(c)

0<d|t
d(c)
= n(c)h(c)(ct −1),
for some appropriate polynomial h ∈Z[X]. However, since c ≡a (mod p), item
(c) of Proposition 10.6 gives
n(c) ≡n(a) ≡0 (mod p),
so that
cn −1 = n(c)h(c)(ct −1) ≡0 (mod p2).
On the other hand,
(a + p)n −1 = an −1 +
n−1

j=1

and (by the computations above) both (a + p)n −1 and an −1 are multiples of p2.
Thus, looking at the last equality above modulo p2, we conclude that
nan−1p ≡0 (mod p2),
which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
For a self-contained discussion of the general case of Dirichlet’s theorem, we
refer the interested reader to [27] or [36]. As far as the special case above is

492

Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
concerned, the coming example shows a nontrivial application. At this point, the
reader may ﬁnd it helpful to recall the material of Sects. 12.2 and 12.3.
Example 20.20 For each prime number p, let g(p) ∈N denote the least positive
primitive root modulo p. Then, the function p →g(p) is unbounded.
Proof Recall that if a is a primitive root modulo p then a
p−1
2
≡−1 (mod p), and
Euler’s criterion (cf. Proposition 12.19) assures that a is a quadratic nonresidue
modulo p. In turn, given a natural number n ≥2, we need to show that there exists
a prime number p such that none of 1, 2, . . . , n is a primitive root modulo p. Then,
it sufﬁces to ﬁnd p such that all of 1, 2, . . . , n are quadratic residues modulo p.
We ﬁrst claim that it is enough that every prime q satisfying 1 < q ≤n is a
quadratic residue modulo p. Indeed, if this is so and 1 < m ≤n is not a perfect
square, then m can be written as m = k2q1 . . . ql, with q1, . . . , ql being pairwise
distinct prime numbers. Letting qj ≡a2
j (mod p), we get
m = k2q1 . . . ql ≡k2a2
1 . . . a2
l = (ka1 . . . al)2 (mod p).
Now, Dirichlet’s theorem assures the existence of a prime number p of the form
p = 1 + 2tn!, for some t ∈N. We claim that such a p works for us. Indeed, if
1 < q ≤n is prime, then the Quadratic Reciprocity Law gives

20.3
Algebraic Numbers Over Zp
This section is somewhat more abstract than the previous ones, for we extend the
concept of algebraic number to consider algebraic numbers over Zp, for some prime
number p. However, the payoff will be worth the effort, for, given n ∈N, we will
be able to compute the exact number of irreducible polynomials over Zp and having
degree n.
We depart from a naive though proﬁtable idea, namely, that there exists a number
set p containing Zp that plays, for Zp, the same role as C plays for Q. We start by
formalizing the concept of ﬁeld.
Deﬁnition 20.21 A ﬁeld is a nonempty set K, furnished with operations +, · : K ×
K →K having the following properties:
(a) + and · are commutative and associative, and · is distributive with respect to +.
(b) There exist elements 0, 1 ∈K, with 0 ̸= 1, such that a + 0 = a and a · 1 = a,
for every a ∈K.
(c) For every a ∈K, there exists an element −a ∈K such that a + (−a) = 0.
(d) For every a ∈K \ {0}, there exists an element a−1 ∈K such that a · a−1 = 1.
The reader has certainly realized what we mean by commutative, associative and
distributive from his/her previous experience. Nevertheless, let us explain all that
from ﬁrst principles. Commutativity in item (a) means that
a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a,
whereas associativity stands for
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a · b) · c = a · (b · c),
for all a, b, c ∈K. In turn, the distributivity of · with respect to + is exactly what
one expects:
a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c,
with the right hand side being a shorthand for the more precise (though somewhat
cumbersome) expression (a · b) + (a · c).

Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
Thus, we surely have that Q, R and C are ﬁelds, and Problem 8, page 486 shows
that so is Q(α), for every α ∈C algebraic over C. Moreover, in all of these cases, the
elements 0 and 1 of item (b) in the above deﬁnition are the usual complex numbers
0 and 1, and this is the reason why, for a general ﬁeld K, we also denote them by
0 and 1. A similar remark holds for −a and a−1, i.e., we are simply adopting the
same notation we use for the additive (resp. multiplicative) inverses of elements of
C (resp. of C \ {0}).
Another class of examples of ﬁelds we have been dealing with is that of the ﬁnite
ﬁelds Zp, with p ∈Z prime. In this case, however, we shall stick to the usage of
writing 0 and 1 whenever convenient, in order to avoid any possibility of confusion
with 0, 1 ∈Z.
Back to a general ﬁeld K, the cancellation laws for addition and multiplication
hold:
a + c = b + c ⇒a = b and a · c = b · c, c ̸= 0 ⇒a = b.
Indeed,
a + c = b + c ⇒(a + c) + (−c) = (b + c) + (−c)
⇒a + (c + (−c)) = b + (c + (−c))
⇒a + 0 = b + 0 ⇒a = b,
and likewise for the multiplication (see Problem 1).
As it happens within C, whenever there is no danger of confusion we shall write
ab, instead of a · b, to denote the product of elements a and b of a general ﬁeld K.
We could have developed most of the theory of polynomials by considering the
set K[X] of polynomials over (or with coefﬁcients in) an arbitrary ﬁeld K, with
operations +, · : K[X] × K[X] →K[X] extending those of K. Taking for granted
the (harmless) assumption that we have done that, we now have at our disposal the
following concepts and facts, whose validities the reader can easily check:
1. If f, g ∈K[X] are such that fg = 0 (the identically zero polynomial), then
f = 0 or g = 0.
2. The notions of degree (for nonzero polynomials) and roots for polynomials over
K remain true, unchanged. Likewise, ∂(fg) = ∂f + ∂g if f, g ̸= 0 and ∂(f +
g) ≤max{∂f, ∂g} if f + g ̸= 0.
3. The division algorithm, the root test and Lagrange’s theorem on the number
of distinct roots of a nonzero polynomial also continue to hold, with identical
proofs.
4. The concept of greatest common divisor for nonzero polynomials over K is a
direct extension of that for polynomials over Q, and Bézout’s Theorem 19.2 is
also true, with exactly the same proof.

20.3
Algebraic Numbers Over Zp
495
5. Another concept that extends in a likewise manner from Q[X] is that of
irreducible polynomial f
∈K[X]. Now, note that we have a version of
Theorem 19.9 at our disposal too, again with the same proof.
A major gap on extending the theory for polynomials over arbitrary ﬁelds is
fulﬁlled by the coming result, which will be assumed without proof (we refer the
interested reader to [6] or [20]).
Theorem 20.22 Given an arbitrary ﬁeld K, there exists another ﬁeld  containing
K, whose operations extend those of K and such that every f ∈[X] has at least
one root in .
The attentive reader has certainly noticed that  plays the role of C for K. We
refer to the property of Theorem 20.22 by saying that  is an algebraically closed
ﬁeld containing K. Also as with C, one now proves that if f ∈K[X]\{0} has degree
n, then there exists a ∈K (the leading coefﬁcient of f ) and α1, . . . , αn ∈ such
that
f (X) = a(X −α1)(X −α2) . . . (X −αn).
The equality above is the factorised form of f over .
We can now deﬁne, exactly as was done in Sect. 20.1, what one means for an
element α ∈ to be algebraic over K, and consider its minimal polynomial pα ∈
K[X] \ {0} as was done for α ∈C algebraic over Q. This way, Proposition 20.3 and
Corollary 20.4 remain true, unchanged.
We now restrict our attention to K = Zp, and write p to denote the ﬁeld  of
Theorem 20.22. We ﬁrst recall the result of Problem 5, page 469, which we write in
the following form:
f (Xp) = f (X)p, ∀f ∈Zp[X].
(20.7)
We shall also need the following auxiliary result.
Lemma 20.23 Let f ∈p[X] \ {0} be given. If α ∈p is a root of f , then:
(a) αp is also a root of f .
(b) There exists a natural number m ≤∂f such that α is a root of Xpm −X.
Proof
(a) It follows from (20.7) that f (αp) = f (α)p = 0
p = 0.
(b) Iterating the result of (a), we conclude that α, αp, αp2, . . . are roots of f . Since
it has at most ∂f distinct roots, we conclude that there exist integers 0 ≤k <
l ≤∂f for which αpk = αpl. Therefore,
0 = αpl −αpk =

where we have used the result of Example 19.15 in the last equality above. It
comes that αpl−k −α = 0, and α is a root of Xpm −X, with m = l −k ≤∂f .
⊓⊔
We are now in position to prove the following
Proposition 20.24 Let p be prime and α ∈p be algebraic over Zp. If ∂pα = n,
then:
(a) α is a root of Xpn −X.
(b) α is not a root of Xpm −X, for any positive integer m < n.
Proof We already know, from the previous lemma, that α is a root of Xpm −X, for
some positive integer m ≤n. Now, let

(a0, a1, . . . , an−1) = a0 + a1α + · · · + an−1αn−1.
We claim that  is injective and each β ∈Im() is a root of Xpm −X. Indeed,
if
(a0, a1, . . . , an−1) = (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1),
for distinct n-tuples (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) and (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1) in the domain of ,
then
(a0 −b0) + (a1 −b1)α + · · · + (an−1 −bn−1)αn−1 = 0,
so that α would be a root of the nonzero polynomial (a0 −b0)+(a1 −b1)X +· · ·+
(an−1 −bn−1)Xn−1 of Zp[X]. Since ∂pα = n, this is a contradiction.
For the second part, let β = a0 + a1α + · · · + an−1αn−1. The result of
Example 19.15, together with Fermat’s little theorem and αpm = α, gives

Let Rm stand for the set of roots of Xpm −X in p. The above claims then assure
that |Rm| ≥pn, so that pm ≥pn and, hence, m ≥n. Since m ≤n, we then get
m = n, and items (a) and (b) follow at once.
⊓⊔
A direct consequence of this proposition is the coming
Corollary 20.25 Let p be prime and α ∈p be algebraic over Zp. If ∂pα = n,
then pα |

tion 20.3 in our setting.

Another consequence is collected as the next result.
Lemma 20.26 Let f ∈Zp[X]\Zp be irreducible and of degree d. If f | (Xpn−X),
then d | n.
Proof If α ∈p is a root of f , then f = pα, and the previous corollary guarantees
that f | (Xpd −X) and f ∤(Xpk −X), for every positive integer k < d. Since
f | (Xpn −X), we conclude that d ≤n.
Now, let n = d + t and write
Xpn −X = Xpd+t −X =

Since f divides the left hand side, it also divides the right hand side. In particular,
f | (Xpr −X), which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
We can ﬁnally state and prove our main result, for which we let
an = #{monic, pairwise distinct irreducible polynomials of degree n in Zp[X]}.
Also, if an > 0, we write fn1, fn2, . . . , fnan to denote such polynomials.

Proof The analogue of Theorem 19.9 for Zp[X] assures that Xpn −X is the product
of ﬁnitely many irreducible polynomials, which can all be assumed to be monic.
If f is one such polynomial, with ∂f = d, the previous lemma shows that d | n,
so that f is one of the polynomials in the right hand side of (20.9). Conversely, if 0 <
d | n, 1 ≤j ≤ad and α ∈p is a root of fdj, then fdj = pα, and Corollary 20.25

Transcendental Numbers
As was said at the beginning of Sect. 20.1, transcendental numbers are precisely
the complex numbers which are not roots of nonzero polynomials with rational
coefﬁcients. Nevertheless, up to this point we don’t even know whether such
numbers do exist.
One possible way of establishing the existence of (real) transcendental numbers
is to start by showing that the set A of (real) algebraic numbers is countably
inﬁnite, i.e., that its elements can be put into a sequence (xn)n≥1, so that A =
{x1, x2, x3, . . .}; then, one proceeds to showing that R is uncountable, so that R \ A
is necessarily nonempty. Up to standard facts on countable and uncountable sets, we
follow this path in the coming theorem, referring the reader to [8] or [33] for the
necessary background.
Theorem 20.30 The set of real algebraic numbers is countably inﬁnite, whereas
that of real transcendental numbers is uncountable.
Proof Let An denote the set of real numbers which are roots of nonconstant
polynomials with rational coefﬁcients and degree n. If we show that each An is
countably inﬁnite, so will be the union
A =

n≥1
An.
However, such a union is precisely the set of real algebraic numbers.
For what is left to do, for each n ∈N let Pn denote the set of polynomials with
rational coefﬁcients and degree n. Since the function
F : Q∗× Q × · · · × Q



n−1
−→Pn(Q)
given by
F(an, an−1, . . . , a0) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0
is a bijection with countably inﬁnite domain, we conclude that Pn is countably
inﬁnite. Now, let Rf denote the set of real roots of f ∈Q[X] \ {0}. Since each
f ∈Pn has a ﬁnite number of real roots, it follows that
An =

f ∈Pn
Rf
is a countably inﬁnite union of ﬁnite sets, hence countably inﬁnite (for it con-
tains Q).
Finally, since R is uncountable and A ⊂R is countably inﬁnite, we conclude
that R \ A is uncountable.

Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
We now present the classical, explicit construction of the ﬁrst transcendental
number, due to Liouville. Up to details, our discussion follows the marvelous [12].
In the following, we say that an algebraic number α has degree n if its minimal
polynomial pα has degree n; in particular, if n > 1, then it’s clear that α is irrational.
We shall also need another piece of terminology: we say that a property P(k),
depending on a natural number k, is true for all sufﬁciently large k if there exists
k0 ∈N such that P(k) is true whenever k > k0; moreover, if a speciﬁc value for
k0 is irrelevant in the context under discussion, we only say that P(k) is true for all
k ≫1.
We are ﬁnally in position to state and prove Liouville’s theorem. For the sake of
comparison, at this point you might want to take a look at the statement of Dirichlet’s
Lemma 7.7.
Theorem 20.31 (Liouville)
Let α ∈C be an algebraic number of degree n > 1. If
(pk)k≥1 and (qk)k≥1 are sequences of nonzero integers such that limk→+∞
pk
qk = α,
then
				α −pk
qk

(20.11)
for all k ≫1.
Proof Let αk =
pk
qk . Since αk
k
−→α, it follows that qk
k
−→+∞. Since α is
algebraic of degree n > 1, there exists f ∈Z[X] \ {0} of degree n and such that
f (α) = 0, say,
f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0,
with a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Z.
We now observe that

where we used the triangle inequality in the last passage above. Since αk

have |αk −α| < 1 for all k ≫1. Under this assumption, we continue to estimate the
last expression above by using some elementary algebra, together with the triangle
inequality again, to obtain

Then, for all k ≫1 (chosen in such a way that |αk −α| < 1), we have

C |f (αk)|.
Now, since qk

for all k ≫1.
As our ﬁnal step, notice that if f (αk) = 0, then we would have f (X) = (X −
αk)g(X), for some g ∈Z[X]\{0} of degree n−1. Since α ̸= αk (for, α is irrational),
we conclude that α would be a root of g, which contradicts the fact that the minimal
polynomial of α has degree n. Therefore, f (αk) ̸= 0 and, hence,
|f (αk)| = an

Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers
The coming example brings a clever application of Liouville’s theorem to the
construction of transcendental numbers. Along its discussion, we shall need some
acquaintance with the arithmetic of convergent series, for which we refer the reader
to Section 10.3 of [8].
Example 20.32 (Liouville) If a1, a2, a3, . . . ∈{1, 2, 3, . . . , 9}, then the real number
α = a1
101! + a2
102! + a3
103! + · · · .
is transcendental.
Proof Suppose that α were algebraic, of degree n > 1 (it is clearly irrational—see
Problem 1). For k ≥1, let
αk =
k

j=1
aj
10j! = pk
10k! ,
where pk ∈N. Then, on the one hand, it follows from Liouville’s theorem that
|α −αk| >
1

10k!n+1 ,
for all k ≫1. On the other,
|α −αk| =

j>k
aj
10j!
						
<
1
10(k+1)! · 9, 999 . . . =

10(k+1)!−1 .
Therefore, for k ≫1, we should have
1
10(k+1)!−1 >
1

10k!n+1
and, hence, (k + 1)! −1 < k!(n + 1). However, this last inequality is equivalent to
k!(k −n) < 1,
which is false for all k ≥n + 1.
Finally, since the assumption that α is algebraic leads to a contradiction, we have
no alternative but to conclude that α is transcendental.
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section by observing that the methods of real Analysis allow one
to prove that e and π are transcendental numbers. Both these facts were established
already in the nineteenth century, due to the works of the French mathematician

C. Hermite and the German mathematician F. Lindemann, respectively. Proofs are
beyond the scope of these notes, and we refer the interested reader to [17] or [28].
Example 20.33 Once we admit the transcendences of e and π, Theorems 20.9
and 20.12 can be applied to establish the transcendence of several other numbers.
More generally, if α ∈R is algebraic and β is transcendental, then α + β is
transcendental. Indeed, if it algebraic we would have
β = (α + β) −α,
also algebraic. A similar argument shows that if α ∈R \ {0} is algebraic and β is
transcendental, then αβ is transcendental.
Problems: Sect. 20.4
1. Prove that the number α of Example 20.32 is irrational.
2. Let α ∈C be algebraic and β ∈C be transcendental. Prove directly (i.e., without
resorting to Theorem 20.9) that α + β is irrational.
3. If α ∈C is transcendental and n ∈N, prove that
n√α and αn are also
transcendental.
4. * Let α ∈C be transcendental, and deﬁne
Q[α] = {a0 + a1α + · · · + anαn; n ∈N and a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Q}.
Prove that Q[α] is closed with respect to addition, subtraction and multiplication
but is not a subﬁeld of C.
For the coming problem you might want to use the following fact, which will
be stated without proof: if α ∈C is a root of a polynomial
f (X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0,
with a0, a1, . . . , an algebraic and an ̸= 0, then α is also algebraic. A proof of this
fact can be found in any standard text on Field Theory, for instance [6] or [20].

Chapter 21
Linear Recurrence Relations
In this chapter we complete the work initiated in Section 3.2 of
[8] (see also
Problems 5, page 79, and 6, page 393), showing how to solve a linear recurrence
relation with constant coefﬁcients and arbitrary order. We ﬁrst need to properly
deﬁne the objects involved, and we do this now.
Deﬁnition 21.1 A sequence (an)n≥1 is said to be linear recurrent if there exist a
positive integer k and complex numbers u0, . . . , uk−1, not all equal to zero, such
that
an+k = uk−1an+k−1 + · · · + u0an
(21.1)
for every n ≥1.
In the above notations, we sometimes also say that (21.1) is a linear recurrence
relation; the natural number k is thus said to be the order of the linear recurrence
relation (21.1).
Given α1, . . . , αk ∈C, it is immediate to verify (by induction, for instance)
that there is exactly one linear recurrent sequence (an)n≥1 satisfying (21.1) and
such that aj = αj for 1 ≤j ≤k. Hence, a linear recurrent sequence of order k
falls completely determined upon knowing the linear recurrence relation it satisﬁes,
together with the values of its ﬁrst k terms.
Deﬁnition 21.2 Let (an)n≥1 be a linear recurrent sequence such that
an+k = uk−1an+k−1 + · · · + u0an
for every n ≥1, with u0, . . . , uk−1 being given complex numbers, at least one
of which is nonzero. The characteristic polynomial of (an)n≥1 is the polynomial
f ∈C[X] given by
f (X) = Xk −uk−1Xk−1 −· · · −u1X −u0.

Linear Recurrence Relations
21.1
An Important Particular Case
In this section, we shall discuss how to solve a linear recurrence relation for which
the corresponding characteristic polynomial has pairwise distinct complex roots. In
spite of such a limitation, this case is much simpler to be dealt with than the general
one and ﬁnds several interesting applications. The result we are interested in is the
content of the coming
Theorem 21.3 Let (an)n≥1 be a sequence satisfying, for every n ≥1, the linear
recurrence relation
an+k = uk−1an+k−1 + · · · + u0an,
with u0, . . . , uk−1 being given complex numbers, not all equal to zero. If the complex
roots z1, z2, . . . , zk of the characteristic polynomial of (an)n≥1 are pairwise distinct
and aj = αj for 1 ≤j ≤k, then
an = zn−1

(21.3)
Proof Since z1, z2, . . . , zk are pairwise distinct, Proposition 18.6 assures the exis-
tence of a unique solution x1, x2, . . . , xk for the system of equations (21.3). We can
thus let (bn)n≥1 be deﬁned by setting
bn = zn−1

x1 + zn−1

x2 + · · · + zn−1

xk, ∀n ≥1.
This way, for 1 ≤j ≤k, system (21.3) furnishes
bj = zj−1
1
x1 + zn−1
2
x2 + · · · + zj−1
k
xk = αj = aj.
On the other hand, since f is the characteristic polynomial of (an)n≥1, it follows
from the deﬁnition of the bj’s that

It follows from the above that (bn)n≥1 satisﬁes the same linear recurrence relation
that (an)n≥1, and its ﬁrst k terms respectively match the ﬁrst k terms of (an)n≥1.
Therefore, a straightforward inductive argument guarantees that an = bn for every
n ≥1, as we wished to show.
⊓⊔
The coming example shows that we not necessarily need to actually know the
roots of the characteristic polynomial of a linear recurrence relation, in order to
apply the result of the previous theorem to obtain interesting information concerning
its behavior.
Example 21.4 (Crux) Let A1A2A3A4 be the square of vertices A1 = (0, 1), A2 =
(1, 1), A3 = (1, 0) and A4 = (0, 0). For each integer n ≥1, let An+4 be the
midpoint of the line segment AnAn+1. Prove that, when n →+∞, the sequence of
points An converges to some ﬁxed point A, and compute the coordinates of such a
point.
Proof For each n ≥1, let An(xn, yn). The stated condition, together with the
formula for the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment (cf. Section 6.2 of
[9]), gives
2xn+4 = xn+1 + xn ∀n ≥1,
an analogous recurrence relation being valid for the sequence (yn)n≥1.
The characteristic polynomial of the above recurrence relation is
f (X) = 2X4 −X −1 = (X −1)g(X),
with g(X) = 2X3 + 2X2 + 2X + 1. If a, b and c are the complex roots of g, then
Girard-Viète relations give
a + b + c = −1 and ab + ac + bc = 1.
(21.4)
Hence,
a2 + b2 + c2 = (a + b + c)2 −2(ab + ac + bc) = (−1)2 −2 · 1 = −1 < 0,

508
21
Linear Recurrence Relations
so that, thanks to Problem 4, page 386, we can assume that a is real and b and c are
nonreal complex conjugates. In particular, a, b and c are pairwise distinct and, since
1 is not a root of g, Theorem 21.3 guarantees the existence of complex constants A,
B, C and D for which
xn = Aan−1 + Bbn−1 + Ccn−1 + D, ∀n ≥1.
(21.5)
For us to know what happens when n →+∞, note ﬁrstly that g(−1)g(0) =
−1 < 0 and, thus, Bolzano’s Theorem 17.2 assures that −1 < a < 0. Therefore,
relations (21.4) give
1 = a(b + c) + bc = a(−1 −a) + bb,
so that |b|2 = a(a+1)+1 < 1. However, since |b| = |c|, it comes that |b| = |c| < 1.
Then, relation (21.5), together with the result of Example 21.8, gives
lim
n→+∞xn = D.
In order to compute the value of D, recall that x1 = x4 = 0 and x2 = x3 = 1.
Hence, by successively letting n = 1, 2, 3 and 4 in (21.5), we obtain the linear
system of equations
⎧
⎪⎪⎨

A + B + C + D
= 1
Aa + Bb + Cc + Dd
= 0
Aa2 + Bb2 + Cc2 + Dd2 = 0
Aa3 + Bb3 + Cc3 + Dd3 = 1
.
Multiplying the last three equations by 2 and termwise adding the four equalities
thus obtained, we arrive at
Ag(a) + Bg(b) + Cg(c) + 7D = 3.
However, since a, b and c are roots of g, we conclude that 7D = 3, and D = 3

In an analogous way, we prove that limn→+∞yn = 4

Sequences, Series and Continuity in C
In this section we partially extend the basic facts on convergence of real sequences
and series (cf. Chapters 7 and 11 of [8], for instance) to functions with complex
values. We observe that the material collected here (more precisely, Theorem 21.20)
was used in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, in Sect. 15.3, and
will be of fundamental importance for Sect. 21.3. We also show that it can be used
to extend the method of generating functions to complex power series.
Given a ∈C and R > 0, we denote by D(a; R) the open disk of center a and
radius R, i.e., the subset of C given by
D(a; R) = {z ∈C; |z −a| < R}.
Analogously, the closed disk of center a and radius R is the subset D(a; R) of C,
given by
D(a; R) = {z ∈C; |z −a| ≤R}.
A set U ⊂C is open if, for every a ∈U, there exists R > 0 such that D(a; R) ⊂
U. A set F ⊂C is closed if F c = C \ F is open. It is immediate to see that ∅and
C are open (in the case of ∅, there is no way for the openness condition not to be
satisﬁed, since there exists no z ∈∅). Hence, C = C \ ∅and ∅= C \ C are also
closed. We now collect less trivial examples of open and closed sets.
Example 21.5 For all a ∈C and R > 0, the open disk D(a; R) is an open set,
whereas the closed disk D(a; R) is a closed set.

Proof Let z ∈D(a; R) be arbitrarily chosen and r = R −|z −a|. Then, r > 0 and
we claim that D(z; r) ⊂D(a; R) (cf. Fig. 21.1), which will be enough to guarantee
that D(a; R) is open.
For what is left to do, take w ∈D(z; r). Triangle inequality gives
|w −a| = |(w −z) + (z −a)| ≤|w −z| + |z −a|
≤r + |z −a| = R,
so that w ∈D(a; R). However, since this holds with every w ∈D(z; r), we
conclude that D(z; r) ⊂D(a; R), as wished.
For the second part, it is enough to show that U = C \ D(a; R) is open. To this
end, take z ∈U and let r = |z −a| −R. Then, r > 0 and, as in the ﬁrst part,
we easily show that w ∈D(z; r) ⇒w ∈U, which is the same as D(z; r) ⊂U.
Therefore, U is indeed open.
⊓⊔
We now turn our attention to sequences of complex numbers, extending to them
the concept of convergence.
Deﬁnition 21.6 A sequence (zn)n≥1 in C converges for a limit z ∈C, and write
zn →z or limn→+∞zn = z, provided the following condition is satisﬁed:
∀ϵ > 0, ∃n0 ∈N; n > n0 ⇒|zn −z| < ϵ.
Heuristically, the fulﬁlment of the condition above means that, as n →+∞, the
terms zn come closer and closer to z. Indeed, the deﬁnition of convergence stipulates
that (zn)n≥1 converges to z ∈C if, for an arbitrarily given radius ϵ > 0, there exists
an index n0 ∈N such that, for n > n0, all of the terms zn belong to the open disk
D(z; ϵ).
As in the real case, a subsequence (znk)k≥1 of a sequence (zn)n≥1 is the
restriction of (zn)n≥1 to an inﬁnite subset {n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · } of indices; from a
rigorous standpoint, (znk)k≥1 is the sequence f ◦g : N →C, with f : N →C and
g : N →N given by f (n) = zn for every n ∈N and g(k) = nk for every k ∈N.
The coming result brings two fundamental properties of the concept of conver-
gence of sequences of complex numbers. In words, item (a) assures that the terms
of a convergent sequence cannot have two distinct limits, and item (b) that every
subsequence of a convergent sequence is also convergent and converges to the same
limit.

21.2
Sequences, Series and Continuity in C
511
Lemma 21.7 Let (zn)n≥1 be a sequence in C.
(a) If zn →z and zn →w, then z = w.
(b) If (znk)k≥1 is a subsequence of (zn)n≥1 and zn →z, then znk →z.
Proof
(a) If z ̸= w, then ϵ = |z −w| > 0. However, since ϵ
2 is also positive and zn →z
and zn →w, there exist natural numbers n1 and n2 such that |zn −z| < ϵ
2 for
n > n1 and |zn −w| < ϵ
2 for n > n2. Hence, taking an index n > n1, n2 and
applying triangle inequality, we obtain
|z −w| = |(z −zn) + (zn −w)|
≤|z −zn| + |zn −w|
< ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ = |z −w|,
which is a contradiction. Therefore, z = w.
(b) Given ϵ > 0, the convergence of (zn)n≥1 to z assures the existence of n0 ∈N
such that |zn −z| < ϵ for n > n0. Now, since n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · , there
exists k0 ∈N with k > k0 ⇒nk > n0. Hence, for such values of k, we have
|znk −z| < ϵ, so that (znk)k≥1 also converges to z.
⊓⊔
Thanks to item (a) of the previous lemma, if a sequence (zn)n≥1 in C converges
to z ∈C, we shall hereafter say that z is the limit of (zn)n≥1.
For the purposes of these notes, one of the most important examples of
convergent sequence is the one collected below. In this respect, see also Problem 2.
Example 21.8 If |z| < 1 and zn = zn for every n ≥1, then (zn)n≥1 converges to 0.
Proof Firstly, note that |zn −0| = |zn| = |z|n. Now, if (an)n≥1 is the sequence
of real numbers given for n ≥1 by an = |z|n, then (cf. Example 7.12 of [8], for
instance) an →0. Thus, given ϵ > 0, there exists n0 ∈N such that 0 ≤an < ϵ for
n > n0. Thus, for n > n0, we have |zn −0| = an < ϵ, so that zn →0.
⊓⊔
Given a sequence (zn)n≥1 of complex numbers, we can write zn = xn + iyn for
every n ≥1, with xn, yn ∈R. Our next result relates the convergence of (zn)n≥1 in
C with those of (xn)n≥1 and (yn)n≥1 in R.
Lemma 21.9 Let (zn)n≥1 be a sequence of complex numbers, with zn = xn + iyn
and xn, yn ∈R for every n ≥1. Then, (zn)n≥1 converges in C if and only if (xn)n≥1
and (yn)n≥1 converge in R. Moreover, if xn →a and yn →b, then zn →z, with
z = a + ib.
Proof Firstly, suppose that zn →z, with z = a + ib, a, b ∈R, and let ϵ > 0 be
given. Since
|xn −a|, |yn −b| ≤
;
|xn −a|2 + |yn −b|2 = |zn −z|,

512
21
Linear Recurrence Relations
we have |xn −a|, |yn −b| < ϵ whenever |zn −z| < ϵ. However, since zn →z,
there exists n0 ∈N such that n > n0 ⇒|zn −z| < ϵ. Then, for each such natural
n, we do have |xn −a|, |yn −b| < ϵ, hence establishing the desired convergences.
Conversely, assume that xn →a and yn →b, and let z = a + ib and ϵ > 0 be
given. Since
|zn −z| =
;
|xn −a|2 + |yn −b|2 ≤|xn −a| + |yn −b|,
we have |zn −z| < ϵ if |xn −a|, |yn −b| < ϵ
2. However, since xn →a and yn →b,
there exist n1, n2 ∈N such that n > n1 ⇒|xn−a| < ϵ
2 and n > n2 ⇒|yn−b| < ϵ
2.
If n0 = max{n1, n2}, then, for n > n0, we have |xn −a|, |yn −b| < ϵ
2 and, hence,
|zn −z| < ϵ. This establishes the convergence of (zn)n≥1 to z.
⊓⊔
We now need to extend to complex sequences another concept related to the
convergence of real sequences.
Deﬁnition 21.10 A Cauchy sequence in C is a sequence (zn)n≥1 satisfying the
following condition: given ϵ > 0, there exists n0 ∈N such that
m, n > n0 ⇒|zm −zn| < ϵ.
If (zn)n≥1 is a convergent sequence in C, then (zn)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence.
Indeed, if zn →z and ϵ > 0 is given, then there exists n0 ∈N such that |zn−z| < ϵ
2
for every n > n0. Hence, for natural numbers m, n > n0, it follows from the triangle
inequality for complex numbers that
|zm −zn| ≤|zm −z| + |z −zn| ≤ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ.
Conversely, we have the following important result.
Proposition 21.11 C is complete. More precisely, if (zn)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence
in C, then (zn)n≥1 converges.
Proof Let zn = xn + iyn, with (xn)n≥1 and (yn)n≥1 being sequences of real
numbers. Given ϵ > 0, take n0 ∈N as in the deﬁnition of Cauchy sequence.
Since |xm −xn| ≤|zm −zn|, it follows that (xn)n≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in
R. Therefore, Theorem 7.27 of [8] guarantees that (xn)n≥1 is convergent, say for
x ∈R. Analogously, there exists y ∈R such that yn →y. Hence, letting z = x+iy,
Lemma 21.9 assures that zn →z.
⊓⊔
As in the real case (cf. [8]), given a sequence (zn)n≥1 of complex numbers, we
deﬁne the series1 
k≥1 zk as the sequence (sn)n≥1, such that sn = n
k=1 zk for
every n ∈N. Also as in the real case, we say that sn is the n-th partial sum of
1The reader must pay attention to the fact that we shall sometimes consider sequences (zn)n≥0 of
complex numbers, so that the corresponding series will be denoted by 
k≥0 zk.

the series, and that the series converges if there exists the limit s := limn→+∞sn;
moreover, in this case we shall say that s is the sum of the series. In symbols, we
write

k≥1
zk =
lim
n→+∞
n

k=1
zk,
provided the limit at the right hand side does exist.
We now present an example of convergent series which will be of fundamental
importance in the next section.
Example 21.12 Given a ∈C \ {0}, show that for z ∈D(0; 1
|a|) we have
1
1 −az =

k≥0

Proof Lemma 13.18 assures that the n-th partial sum of the series is
n

k=0
(az)k = 1 −(az)n+1
1 −az
=
1
1 −az −(az)n+1
1 −az .
Now, for z ∈D(0; 1
|a|) we have |az| < 1, so that Example 21.8 gives (az)n →0 as
n →+∞. Hence, it follows from the equality above that, for z ∈D(0; 1
|a|),

(az)k =

1 −az.
⊓⊔
Another concept of central importance is that of an absolutely convergent
series, i.e., a series 
k≥0 zk of complex numbers such that the real series 
k≥0 |zk|
converges. For n ∈N, let sn = n
k=1 zk and tn = n
k=1 |zk|, so that (tn)n≥1
converges. The triangle inequality for complex numbers furnishes, for integers
m > n,
|sm −sn| =
					
m

k=n+1
zk
					 ≤
m

k=n+1
|zk| = tm −tn.
Now, since (tn)n≥1 converges, it is a Cauchy sequence; hence, given ϵ > 0, there
exists k0 ∈N such that m > n > k0 ⇒tm −tn < ϵ. Therefore, we also have
|sm −sn| < ϵ for m > n > k0, so that (sn)n≥0 is a Cauchy sequence too. Thus,
Proposition 21.11 assures its convergence, and we have proved the coming.
Proposition 21.13 In C, every absolutely convergent series is convergent.
Before we can go on, we need to extend the concept of continuity for functions
deﬁned on a subset of C and assuming complex values.

Deﬁnition 21.14 Given a nonempty subset X of C, we say that a function f : X →
C is continuous if the following condition is satisﬁed: for every sequence (zn)n≥1
of points of X, if zn →z, with z ∈X, then f (zn) →f (z).
Our next result will allow us to establish the continuity of complex polynomial
functions.
Proposition 21.15 If f, g : X →C are continuous functions, then so are f +
g, fg : X →C.
Proof Let a sequence (zn)n≥1 in X be given, such that zn →z, for some z ∈X.
Firstly, the triangle inequality for complex numbers gives
|(f + g)(zn) −(f + g)(z)| = |(f (zn) −f (z)) + (g(zn) −g(z)|
≤|f (zn) −f (z)| + |g(zn) −g(z)|.
Now, given ϵ > 0, since f (zn) →f (z) and g(zn) →g(z), there exists n0 ∈N
such that
n > n0 ⇒|f (zn) −f (z)|, |g(zn) −g(z)| < ϵ
2.
Therefore, also for n > n0, the above estimates show that
|(f + g)(zn) −(f + g)(z)| ≤ϵ
2 + ϵ
2 = ϵ
and, hence, that (f + g)(zn) →(f + g)(z).
For fg, and applying twice the triangle inequality, we obtain
|(fg)(zn) −(fg)(z)| = |f (zn)g(zn) −f (z)g(z)|
≤|f (zn) −f (z)||g(zn)| + |f (z)||g(zn) −g(z)|
≤|f (zn) −f (z)||g(zn) −g(z)|
+ |f (zn) −f (z)||g(z)| + |f (z)||g(zn) −g(z)|.
As before, given ϵ > 0, we can take n0 ∈N such that n > n0 implies
|f (zn) −f (z)| < min
<ϵ
3,
ϵ
3(|g(z)| + 1)

and
|g(zn) −g(z)| < min

ϵ
3(|f (z)| + 1)
/
.

21.2

Then, for a natural number n > n0, it follows from the above that

so that (fg)(zn) →(fg)(z).
⊓⊔
Example 21.16 Given n ∈N and a0, a1, . . . , an−1, an ∈C, with an ̸= 0, the
complex polynomial function f : C →C, given for z ∈C by
f (z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0,
is continuous.
Proof Obviously, constant functions and the identity function z →z are continuous
(just apply the deﬁnition). Thus, by applying several times the second part of the
previous proposition, we conclude that, for an integer 0 ≤k ≤n, the function z →
akzk is also continuous. Now, applying several times the ﬁrst part of the previous
proposition, we conclude that the sum of such functions, when k varies from 0 to n,
is also continuous. However, such a sum is precisely the function f .
⊓⊔
We now turn to the discussion of power series in C, namely, a series of the form

k≥0 akzk, for some given sequence (an)n≥0 of complex numbers.
Assume that the sequence ( k√|ak|)k≥0 is bounded, say with
k√|ak| < A for
every k ≥0 and some A > 0. Then, |akzk| ≤(Az)k for every k ≥0, so that
Example 21.12 guarantees that the series 
k≥0 |akzk| converges in D(0; R), where
R =
1
A. In turn Proposition 21.13 then assures that the power series 
k≥0 akzk
converges in D(0; R). We abbreviate such a situation simply by saying that D(0; R)
is a convergence disk for the power series under consideration. The next result
assures that the function f : D(0; R) →C thus deﬁned is continuous.2 By the sake
of notation, we make the convention that 
k≥0 akzk = a0 for z = 0.
Proposition 21.17 If D(0; R) is a convergence disk for the power series

k≥0 akzk, then the function f : D(0; R) →C, given for z ∈D(0; R) by
f (z) = 
k≥0 akzk, is continuous.
2Actually, one can show that f is an example of a holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable)
function. However, since we shall not need this concept, and in order to maintain the elementary
character of these notes, we will only establish the continuity of functions deﬁned by power series.
The interested reader can ﬁnd the relevant results and deﬁnitions in [11].

2(R −|z|). Then,
|w| < r, with r = 1

|wk −zk| = |w −z||wk−1 + wk−2z + · · · + wzk−2 + zk−1|

≤|w −z|(rk−1 + rk−2 · r + · · · + r · rk−2 + rk−1)
= krk−1|w −z|.
Hence, under the above restriction on w, Problem 4 yields

and

In short, we have shown that

2(R −|z|) ⇒|f (w) −f (z)| < A|w −z|,
for some positive constant A. But this being the case, Problem 8 shows that zn →
z ⇒f (zn) →f (z), and the fact that z ∈D(0; R) was arbitrarily chosen guarantees
the continuity of f .

The coming corollary assures that if a function f : D(0; R) →C is given by a
power series, then such a series is uniquely determined.
Corollary 21.18 Let 
k≥0 akzk and 
k≥0 bkzk be convergent power series in the
open disk D(0; R). If 
k≥0 akzk = 
k≥0 bkzk for every z ∈D(0; R), then ak = bk
for every k ≥0.
Proof By evaluating equality 
k≥0 akzk = 
k≥0 bkzk at z = 0, we obtain
a0
=
b0. Then, cancelling out a0
=
b0 in both sides of 
k≥0 akzk
=

k≥0 bkzk, we get 
k≥1 akzk
= 
k≥1 bkzk for z ∈D(0; R) and, hence,

k≥1 akzk−1 = 
k≥1 bkzk−1 for z ∈D(0; R) \ {0}. However, since both sides
of this last equality deﬁne continuous functions on D(0; R), we conclude that

k≥1 akzk−1 = 
k≥1 bkzk−1 for every z ∈D(0; R). Now, looking at such an
equality at z = 0, we obtain a1 = b1. By proceeding this way, an easy induction
gives ak = bk for every k ≥0.
⊓⊔
As a ﬁrst application of the ideas developed here, we now present a proof of the
identities of Proposition 16.17 with the aid of complex generating functions.

We ﬁnish this section by proving a result that extends, for continuous functions
f : D(a; R) →C, Theorem 8.26 of [8].
Theorem 21.20 (Weierstrass3)
If f : D(a; R) →C is a continuous function,
then there exist zm and zM in D(a; R) such that
|f (zm)| = min{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}
and
|f (zM)| = max{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}.
Proof Let (zn)n≥1 be a sequence in D(a; R) such that
f (zn) →sup{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}
(here, in principle we do not exclude the possibility that such a supremum could be
+∞). Write zn = xn + iyn, with xn, yn ∈R. Since |zn| ≤R for every n ≥1, we
have |xn|, |yn| ≤R for every n ≥1. Therefore, Theorem 7.25 of [8] guarantees the
existence of an inﬁnite set N1 ⊂N such that (xn)n∈N1 converges to some x ∈R.
Hence, by the same result we can take a second inﬁnite set N2 ⊂N1 such that
(yn)n∈N2 converges to some y ∈R. However, since (xn)n∈N2 is a subsequence of
(xn)n∈N1, we conclude that (xn)n∈N2 still converges to x.
Letting zM = x + iy, it follows from Lemma 21.9 that (zn)n∈N2 converges to
zM. Hence, Problem 1 gives |zM| ≤R, so that zM ∈D(a; R). Now, invoking the

continuity of f , we have
f (zM) = lim
n→+∞
n∈N2
f (zn) = sup{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}.
In particular,
sup{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)} = max{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}.
The proof of the ﬁrst part of the theorem is analogous and will be left as an
exercise to the reader.
⊓⊔
The result of the following corollary was used in the proof of the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra.
Corollary 21.21 If f : C →C is a complex polynomial function, then, given
R > 0, there exist zm and zM in D(a; R) such that
|f (zm)| = min{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}
and
|f (zM)| = max{|f (z)|; z ∈D(a; R)}.
Proof Example 21.16 and Problem 7 guarantee that |f | : C →[0, +∞) is a
continuous function. Thus, so is the function |f | : D(a; R) →[0, +∞). It now
sufﬁces to apply Weierstrass’ theorem.

The General Case
With the material of the previous section at our disposal, we can ﬁnally face the
discussion of the general case of (21.1), i.e., that in which the complex roots of the
characteristic polynomial (21.2) are not necessarily distinct. To this end, we shall
use complex generating functions again. The fundamental result is given by the
coming
Theorem 21.22 Let (an)n≥1 be a sequence of complex numbers satisfying, for
every n ≥1, the linear recurrence relation
an+k = uk−1an+k−1 + · · · + u0an,
with u0, . . . , uk−1 being given complex numbers and u0 ̸= 0. Let z1, . . . , zl be
the pairwise distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial (21.2) of (an)n≥1, with
multiplicities respectively equal to m1, . . . , ml. Then, for every n ≥1, we have
an = p1(n −1)zn−1

+ · · · + pl(n −1)zn−1
l
,

21.3
The General Case
521
where p1, . . . , pl ∈C[X] are polynomials of degrees less than or equal to m1 −1,
. . . , ml −1, respectively, and totally determined by the values of a1, . . . , ak.
Proof We ﬁrst claim that there exists a constant R0 > 0 such that |an| ≤Rn for
every n ≥1 and R > R0. Indeed, if |an| ≤Rn for 1 ≤n < m, with m > k, then
|am| = |uk−1am−1 + · · · + u1am−k+1 + u0am−k|
≤|uk−1||am−1| + · · · + |u1||am−k+1| + |u0||am−k|
≤|uk−1|Rm−1 + · · · + |u1|Rm−k+1 + |u0|Rm−k
= Rm−k(|uk−1|Rk−1 + · · · + |u1|R + |u0|).
Hence, if g(X) = Xk −|uk−1|Xk−1 −· · · −|u1|X −|u0| and R0 > 0 is such that
g(R) > 0 for R > R0, then, for each one of such R’s, the estimates above give
|am| ≤Rm−k(|uk−1|Rk−1 + · · · + |u1|R + |u0|)
≤Rm−k · Rk = Rm.
It thus sufﬁces to choose, from the very beginning, R0 > 0 such that |a1|, . . . , |ak| ≤
R0 and g(R) > 0 for every R > R0.
Now, ﬁx R > R0 and let
F(z) =

n≥1
anzn.
Since |an| ≤Rn for every n ≥1, the comparison test for series (cf. Problem 5,
page 520) guarantees the convergence of F in the open disk D(0; 1
R ) of the complex
plane. Let f (X) = Xk−uk−1Xk−1−· · ·−u1X−u0 be the characteristic polynomial
of (an)n≥1 and h(X) = −u0Xk −u1Xk−1 −· · ·−uk−1X+1 its reciprocal (∂h = k,

so that
h(z)F(z) = zp(z)
for z ∈D(0; 1

Since h(0) = 1 ̸= 0, by increasing R, if needed, we can assume that h(z) ̸= 0
for z ∈D(0; 1
R ). On the other hand, since
f (X) = (X −z1)m1 . . . (X −zl)ml,
we have
h(X) = (1 −z1X)m1 . . . (1 −zlX)ml,
so that
F(z) =

Now, observe that
∂p < k = ∂((1 −z1z)m1 . . . (1 −zlz)ml).
Hence, by applying to (21.6) the partial fractions decomposition formula (cf.
Problem 9, page 457), we conclude the existence, for 1 ≤j ≤l and 1 ≤nj ≤mj,
of constants djnj , uniquely determined by the coefﬁcients of p (and, thus, by a1, a2,

⊓⊔
In order to present a relevant application of the previous result, we ﬁrst need a
deﬁnition. Throughout the rest of this section, AP stands for arithmetic progression.
Deﬁnition 21.23 Given an integer m > 1, we call a sequence (an)n≥1 an:
(a) AP of order 1 if it is an ordinary AP.
(b) AP of order m if the sequence (bn)n≥1, given for n ≥1 by bn = an+1 −an, is
an AP of order m −1.
The coming lemma characterizes AP’s of order m by means of a linear recurrence
relation that generalizes those satisﬁed by AP’s of orders 1 and 2 (cf. Sections 3.1
and 3.3 of [8]).
Lemma 21.24 A sequence (an)n≥1 is an AP of order m if and only if

(21.8)
for every n ≥1.
Proof Firstly, let (an)n≥1 be an AP of order m. If m = 1, then (an)n≥1 is an ordinary
AP, and (21.8) reduces to an+2 −2an+1 + an = 0 for n ≥1, the linear recurrence
relation that characterizes ordinary AP’s.
By induction hypothesis, assume that (21.8) is valid for m = k −1. For m = k,
the sequence (bn)n≥1 given by bn = an+1 −an is, by deﬁnition, an AP of order
k −1. Therefore, the induction hypothesis gives

and
k

k+1

, we get (21.8) for m = k.
Conversely, let (an)n≥1 be a sequence for which (21.8) holds. If m = 1, then
an+2 −2an+1 + an = 0 for n ≥1, and we already know that (an)n≥1 is an AP. By
induction hypothesis, suppose that the validity of (21.8) for m = k −1 implies that
(an)n≥1 is an AP of order k−1. Then, consider a sequence (an)n≥1 satisfying (21.8)
for m = k, i.e., such that
k + 1


, we successively reob-
tain (21.11), (21.10) and (21.9), for every n ≥1. Hence, the induction hypothesis
assures that (bn)n≥1 is an AP of order k −1, so that, by deﬁnition, (an)n≥1 is an AP
of order k.
⊓⊔
We are ﬁnally in position to present the promised application of Theorem 21.22.
Example 21.25 If (an)n≥1 is an AP of order m, then (21.8) holds for every n ≥1,
so that the characteristic polynomial of (an)n≥1 is
f (X) =
m + 1

Xm+1 −
m + 1
1

Xm + · · · + (−1)m+1
m + 1
m + 1

= (X −1)m+1.
Theorem 21.22 thus guarantees the existence of constants α0, α1, . . . , αm such that
an = α0 + α1(n −1) + · · · + αm(n −1)m
for every n ≥1. Evaluating the above relation for n = 1, we get α0 = a1; for n = 2,
. . . , m + 1, we obtain α1, . . . , αm as the solution to the linear system of equations

The General Case

Notice that the fact that such a linear system always has a single solution is an
immediate consequence4 of the last part of the statement of Theorem 21.22.
Problems: Sect. 21.3

the linear system is a Vandermonde matrix of nonvanishing determinant.

1. If there exists a bijection f : I1 →In, show that n = 1. Now, assume that
m, n > 1 and there exists a bijection f : Im →In. Letting k = f (m), show
that there exists a bijection g : In\{k} →In−1, so that g◦f|Im−1 : Im−1 →In−1
is also a bijection. Then, use an inductive argument to deduce that m−1 = n−1.
2. If g : Im →A and h : In →B are bijections, deﬁne f : Im+n →A ∪B by
letting
f (k) =
g(k),
if 1 ≤k ≤m
h(k −m), if m + 1 ≤k ≤m + n .
Since g and h are surjective and m+1 ≤k ≤m+n if and only if 1 ≤k−m ≤n,
we conclude that f is also surjective. For the injectivity of f , suppose that
f (k) = f (l), with 1 ≤k, l ≤m + n. There are four cases to consider:
•
1 ≤k, l ≤m: then f (k) = f (l) ⇒g(k) = g(l), and the injectivity of g
gives k = l.
•
m + 1 ≤k, l ≤m + n: then f (k) = f (l) ⇒h(k −m) = h(l −m), and the
injectivity of h gives k −m = l −m, thus k = l.
•
1 ≤k ≤m and m+1 ≤l ≤m+n: then f (k) = f (l) ⇒g(k) = h(l−m) ∈
A∩B, a contradiction to the fact that A and B are disjoint. Therefore, in this
case it is always the case that f (k) ̸= f (l).
•
m + 1 ≤k ≤m + n and 1 ≤l ≤m: as in the previous case, we always have
f (k) ̸= f (l).

Suppose, by induction hypothesis, that the result is true when |A| = |B| = n,
for some n ∈N, and let A and B be such that |A| = |B| = n + 1. Given x ∈A
and a function f : A →B, let y = f (x). Then |A \ {x}| = |B \ {y}| = n and
f restricts to a function g : A \ {x} →B \ {y}. By the inductive hypothesis
g is injective if and only if it’s surjective. However, since f is injective (resp.
surjective) if and only if g is injective (resp. surjective), it follows that f is
injective if and only if it’s surjective.

a and b are odd, if n is odd, or even, if n is even). Now, ﬁrst certify yourself
that any point (a, b) satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) can be a ﬁnal destination
of the pawn; then, use the fundamental principle of counting to show that there

7. For (a), assume we have k + 1 disks piled at the leftmost rod. We obviously
need at least ak movements to pile the k upper disks at the central rod; an extra
movement puts the larger disk at the rightmost rod; ﬁnally, at least more ak
movements move the k disks from the central to the leftmost rod. This amounts
to a total of at least 2ak + 1 movements, so that ak+1 = 2ak + 1. For (b), either
make induction on n or note that ak+1 +1 = 2(ak +1), taking into account that
a1 = 1.
8. For item (b), note that there are two kinds of partitions of In+1 into k + 1

n + 1 belongs to a set of the partition having at least two elements—there are
exactly (k +1)S(n, k +1) such partitions. Note that item (c) asks us to compute
S(7, 3), for which we can use the recurrence relation of item (b), together with
the results of (a).
9. Let an denote the number of desired sequences, and bn the number of sequences
of n terms, all of which equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3 and having an odd number of 0’s.
Argue recursively to show that an = 3an−1 + bn−1 and bn = an−1 + 3bn−1 for
all n ≥2. Then conclude that ak+1 −6ak + 8ak−1 = 0 for every k ≥2 and
compute a1 = 2, a2 = 1 + 32 = 10. Finally, apply the result of Problem 5,
page 79.
10. For item (a), use the fundamental principle of counting to show that there are
exactly 3 · 2n−1 ﬂags with n strips, for every integer n ≥1. For item (b), start
by observing that a1 = 0 and a2 = 6; then, show that, for n ≥1, there is a
bijection between the set of ﬂags with n + 1 strips in which the ﬁrst and last
strips have equal colors and the set of ﬂags with n strips in which the ﬁrst and
last strips have distinct colors; ﬁnally, use the result of item (a). For item (c),
use the result of (b) to show that an+2 = an+1 + 2an for every n ≥1; then,
solve this recurrence relation.
11. For item (b), let A be a minimal selﬁsh subset of In containing n. Note that
1 /∈A (for, otherwise, A wouldn’t be minimal) and A ̸= {n}, In. We claim that
the set A′ = (A\{n})−1 is a minimal selﬁsh subset of In−2. To check this, note
ﬁrst that A′ ⊂In−2; on the other hand, |A′| = |A| −1 and, since |A| ∈A, we
have that |A| −1 ∈(A −1) ⊂A′. Thus, A is a selﬁsh subset of In−2. In order
to show that A′ is minimal, assume that there would exist B′ ⊂A′ such that
B′ ̸= A′ and B′ was selﬁsh. Then, prove that B = (B′ + 1) ∪{n} ⊂A would
be a selﬁsh subset of In containing n. Use the minimality of A to conclude that

B = A and, hence, that B′ = A′, which is an absurd. Analogously, given a
minimal selﬁsh subset B of In−2, prove that (B + 1) ∪{n} is a minimal selﬁsh
subset of In. For item (c), if an denotes the number of minimal selﬁsh subsets
of In, it follows from items (a) and (b) that an = an−1 + an−2 for every integer
n > 2. Now, verify that a1 = a2 = 1 and conclude that an = Fn for every
n ≥1.
12. For item (a), note that there are three distinct types of nonempty subsets of Y:
the nonempty subsets of X; the sets A∪{m}, where A ⊂X is nonempty; the set
{m}. Then, write aY as a sum with three summands, each of them corresponding
to the subsets of one of these three types; while doing this, note that if A ⊂X
is nonempty, then π(A ∪{m}) = π(A)m. Item (c) follows from (b), together
with a straightforward induction.
13. For item (a), adapt to the present case the hint given to the item (a) of the
previous problem. To this end, note that if ∅̸= A ⊂X, then σ(A ∪{m}) =
σ(A)+m and π(A∪{m}) = π(A)m. Item (c) follows from item (b) by an easy
induction.
14. Let J0 = {1} and, for every natural k ≥1, let Jk = {2k−1 + 1, . . . , 2k}. Show
ﬁrst that, for every k, there exists a good set Bk ⊂{1, 2, 3, . . . , 2k} such that
|Bk| = bk and Jk ⊂Bk, i.e., Bk ∩Jk = Jk. Since Bk is good and Bk ∩Jk = Jk,
we must have Bk ∩Jk−1 = ∅. Now, let Xk−2 = Bk ∩{1, 2, 3, . . . , 2k−2}.
Clearly, every subset of a good set is also a good set; therefore, Xk−2 is good.
Conclude from this fact that bk ≤bk−2+2k−1. Then, taking a good subset Yk−2
of {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2k−2} and looking at Yk−2 ∪Jk, show that bk ≥bk−2 + 2k−1.
For item (b), use the recurrence relation of item (a), together with telescoping

2. For item (a), expand the products in (x + y)n = (x + y) . . . (x + y) (n factors
equal to x+y) and note that the monomial xn−kyk appears as many times as the
number of ways of choosing a subset of k elements from the set {1, 2, . . . , n}.
Then, generalize such an argument to get the result of item (b).
3. Let x1 = · · · = xk = 1 in (1.12).
4. Notice that each (nonordered) partition of a set A of n elements into k nonempty
subsets gives rise to k! ordered partitions of A into k nonempty subsets.
5. If aj is the only local maximum of a permutation (a1, a2, . . . , an) of In, then
aj = n. Now, show that a1 < · · · < aj−1 and aj+1 > · · · > an, so that it

equal to 0 and the other n equal to 1, and let 1 ≤i1 < . . . < ik−1 ≤n −k + 1
be the indices of the former ones. There are x1 = i1 −1 ≥0 terms that come
before ai1 (which is the i-th one), x2 = i2 −i1 −1 ≥0 terms between ai1
and ai2, . . . , xk = (n −k + 1) −ik−1 ≥0 terms that come after aik−1. Since
all of these are equal to 1, and there are exactly n terms equal to 1, we get
x1 + · · · + xk = n. Thus, starting from a sequence (a1, . . . , an+k−1) as above,
we get a solution, in nonnegative integers, of the given equation. Conversely,
given a solution x1 = j1, . . . , xk = jk in nonnegative integers of the equation,
we can form a sequence (a1, . . . , an+k−1) as above, letting the terms of indices
j1 +1, j1 +j2 +2, j1 +j2 +· · ·+jk−1 +(k−1) be equal to 0 and the remaining
ones be equal to 1. Therefore, by the bijective principle we only need to count
the total number of such sequences, which is rather simple: it sufﬁces to choose
a subset of k −1 elements of the set of In+k−1 and, then, to impose that all the
terms corresponding to the chosen indices are equal to 0, while the remaining
ones are equal to 1. Proposition 1.26 gives

for f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒f (f (x1)) = f (f (x2)) ⇒x1 = x2. Now, it follows
from the result of Problem 4, page 7, that f is a bijection. Assume that f has k
ﬁxed points. Fix a ∈In such that a is not one of them and let b = f (a). Then,
b ̸= a and f (b) = a. Thus, we can group the remaining n −k elements of In
(all but the ﬁxed points of f ) in pairs (a, b), with b = f (a) and a = f (b),
which implies that n −k must be even. For item (b), let 0 ≤k ≤n be such
that n −k is even. For each choice of k elements x1, . . . , xk ∈In and for each
partition {{a1, b1}, . . . , {al, bl}} of the remaining n −k elements of In, there
obviously exists a single function f : In →In having x1, . . . , xk as its ﬁxed

simultaneously sit in chairs i −1 and i; also, if A2i ∩A2i+1 was not empty,
then wi and wi+1 should both sit in chair i. Item (d) follows from the fact that,
for every intersection of the form Ai1 ∩Ai2 ∩. . .∩Aik, exactly k of the n women
have their positions entirely determined, whereas the n −k remaining ones can
be permuted in any desired way. Finally, for (f) apply the inclusion-exclusion
principle.
Section 2.2
1. Explicitly write the summands at both sides.
2. Note that both sides count the number of subsets of a set having n elements.
3. Adapt, to the present case, the idea used in the proof of Example 2.9.
4. Start by choosing k odd elements and k even elements; then, use Lagrange’s
identity.
5. Let P1, P2, . . . , P11 be the patrols and h1, h2, . . . , hn be the volunteers. Deﬁne
a function
f : {h1, . . . , hn} →{{Pi, Pj}; 1 ≤i < j ≤11}
by letting
f (hi) = {Pj, Pk} ⇔hi enters Pj and Pk.

Hints and Solutions
The conditions given immediately assure that f is a bijection, so that there are
as many volunteers as 2-element subsets of the set of the 11 patrols. Thus, there
are n =
11
2

= 55 volunteers. Now, let A be the set of ordered pairs (hi, Pj)
such that hi ∈Pj. Since each of the 55 men enters exactly two patrols, A has
exactly 2 · 55 = 110 pairs. On the other hand, if k is the number of members in
each patrol, then Pj is the second entry of exactly k ordered pairs in A (those
whose ﬁrst entries are the k members of Pj); however, since there are precisely
11 patrols, it follows that A has 11k ordered pairs. Therefore, 11k = 110 and,
hence, k = 10.
6. Show that both sides of the desired equality count the total number of ﬁxed
points of all permutations of In.
7. Let a1, a2, . . . , am be the initial terms of the arithmetic progressions, and n >
a1, . . . , am a natural number. Let’s count the number of elements of In in two
different ways, the obvious one being |In| = n. For the other one, assume that
the arithmetic progression of initial term ai and common ratio di has exactly ki
terms in In, so that m
i=1 di = n and ai + (ki −1)di ≤n < ai + kidi or, which
is the same,

8. Associate 0 or 1 to each line segment which is a side of a smaller triangle,
according to whether its vertices have equal or distinct labels, respectively;
then, associate to each smaller triangle the sum of the numbers associated to
its three sides. Now, observe that the number associated to any smaller triangle
is equal to 0, 2 or 3, being equal to 3 if and only if the corresponding triangle
is labelled as ABC. Finally, use double counting to show that the sum of the
numbers associated to the smaller triangles is always odd.
9. Let x denote the desired number of commissions and y the total number of the
remaining ones. Firstly, note that x + y = 4060. Now, ﬁx an arbitrary senator
and show that he/she enters exactly 268 commissions in which the other two
members are both his/her friends or enemies. Finally, use double counting to
conclude that 3x + y = 30 · 268.
10. Let A1A2 . . . An be the n-gon, AnA2 ∩A1A3 = {X} and A2A4 ∩A3A5 = {Y};

Section 2.3
1. For item (a), we leave to the reader the task of showing that ∼is symmetric. For
the reﬂexivity, let a ∈A be given; since F is a partition of A, there exists B ∈F
such that a ∈B. Therefore, a, a ∈B or, which is the same, a ∼a. Now, let
a, b, c ∈A be such that a ∼b and b ∼c. There exist B, C ∈F such that
a, b ∈B and b, c ∈C. However, since F is a partition of A and B ∩C ̸= ∅(for,
b ∈B ∩C), we conclude that B = C; therefore, a ∼c. Finally, for a ∈A, take
the set B ∈F for which a ∈B. Then,
a = {x ∈A; x ∼a} = {x ∈A; x, a ∈C, ∃C ∈F}.
Invoking once more the fact that F is a partition of A, we conclude that B is the
only element of F to which a does belongs. Thus,
a = {x ∈A; x ∈B} = B.
The analysis of item (b) is quite similar to that of (a) and will also be left to the
reader; we notice that, in this case, if B is a ﬁnite set, then there are exactly |B|
distinct equivalence classes.
2. A ∼A, for A = A + 0 modulo 3. If A ∼B, with B = A + j modulo 3, then
B ∼A, with A = B + (3 −j) modulo 3. Finally, if A ∼B and B ∼C, with
B = A + i modulo 3 and C = B + j modulo 3, show that C = A + k modulo
3, where 0 ≤k ≤2 is such that i + j ≡k (mod 3).
3. If the involved sets were to be chosen in a speciﬁc order, then there would be
exactly
 ab
b,...,b

= (ab)!
(b!)a distinct ways of partitioning the set as prescribed. Since
the choice is actually unordered, we have to divide by a!.
4. For item (b), use the result of (a), together with Proposition 2.16 and the
deﬁnition of Stirling numbers of second kind. For item (c), use the result of (b),
together with that of Example 2.6.
5. Firstly, note that there are exactly mp −m non monochromatic sequences of
p beads, each bead being of one of the m given colors. Apply the equivalence
relation (2.16) to such sequences (with p in place of n) to conclude that there are
exactly mp−m
p
distinct and non monochromatic necklaces. Since there are exactly

544
22
Hints and Solutions
m monochromatic necklaces, there is nothing left to do in order to establish the
ﬁrst part. For the second part, it follows from the ﬁrst that p divides mp −m =
m(mp−1 −1), for every m ∈N. It now sufﬁces to assume that p ∤m, using the
remarks that precede the statement of the problem to conclude that p | (mp−1 −
1).
6. In the set F of aperiodic sequences of size n, let ∼be the relation deﬁned
by setting (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∼(y1, y2, . . . , yn) if and only if there exists 0 ≤
k ≤n −1 such that yi = xi+k (mod n), for 1 ≤i ≤n. Show that ∼is
an equivalence relation, with respect to which each equivalence class contains
exactly n sequences. Then, apply the result of Proposition 2.18.
7. Apply Bollobás’ theorem, together with the fact that

n
⌊n/2⌋

is the largest
binomial number with numerator equal to n.
8. For the ﬁrst part of (a), show more generally (by induction, for instance) that if
f (m) = Id for some m ∈N, then f is injective, hence bijective (thanks to the
result of Problem 4, page 7). The second part of (a) follows from the associativity
of composition, together with the fact that f (j) is a bijection for every j ∈Z (so
that a = f (j)(b) ⇒b =

f (j)−1(a) = f (−j)(a)). For the ﬁrst part of (b), let
a = {. . . , f (−2)(a), f (−1)(a), a, f (a), f (2)(a), . . .}
be an equivalence class of ∼with more than one element, so that f (a) ̸= a. If
j > 1 is the smallest integer such that f (j)(a) = a (by assumption, f (p)(a) = a,
thus such a j does exist), write p = jq + r, with 0 ≤r < p, and use the
minimality of j to conclude that r = 0; then, show that j = p. Conclude
that a = {a, f (a), f (2)(a), . . . , f (p−1)(a)}. The second part of (b) now follows
from the ﬁrst part, together with the fact that the equivalence classes form a
partition of In. Item (c) follows from the fundamental principle of counting,
together with the fact that, given pairwise distinct elements a1, a2, . . . ap ∈In,
there are exactly (p −1)! possibilities for the restriction of f to {a1, a2, . . . ap},
such that f ({a1, a2, . . . ap}) = {a1, a2, . . . ap} and none of a1, a2, . . . ap is a
ﬁxed point. Indeed, in this case there exists a ∈In for which {a1, a2, . . . ap} =
{a, f (a), . . . , f (p−1)(a)}; however, since f (p)(a) = a, the number of desired
bijections from {a1, a2, . . . ap} to itself amounts to the number of circular
permutations of these numbers, i.e., (p−1)!. Finally, for (d), once ﬁxed an integer
0 ≤k ≤n such that p | (n −k), there are
n

ways of choosing k elements of
In to be the ﬁxed points of f . In turn, the number of ways of partitioning the

9. For item (a), show that if A, B ⊂In are distinct subsets with k > n
2 elements
each, then A ∩B ̸= ∅. For item (b), take F as the family of subsets of In formed
by the k-element subsets of In which contain n. For item i., ﬁx A ∈F compatible
with σ; we can assume, without loss of generality, that A = {a1, . . . , ak} and
σ = (a1, . . . , ak, ak+1, . . . , an). Group the remaining k-element subsets of In
which intersect A and are compatible with σ in appropriate pairs. Then, use the
fact that F is an intersecting family to conclude that there are at most other
k −1 sets in F which are still compatible with σ. For ii. assume, without loss
of generality, that A = {x1, . . . , xk} and σ = (a1, . . . , ak, ak+1, . . . , an), with
{x1, . . . , xk} = {a1, . . . , ak}. Finally, for iii. use double counting.
Section 2.4
1. Let Sn be the set of sequences a = (a1, . . . , an), with ai ∈{0, 1} for 1 ≤i ≤n,
and P(n) be the family of parts of In. For a ∈Sn, let f (a) ∈P(n) be given by
f (a) = {1 ≤i ≤n; ai = 1}. Now, check that the function f : Sn →P(n)
thus deﬁned is a bijection that preserves metrics, in the following sense: if d is
the Hamming metric in Sn and d′ is the metric of symmetric difference in P(n),
then d(a, b) = d′(f (a), f (b)) for all a, b ∈Sn.

3 · 2k−2 = k(2k2 −3k + 4). In order to solve such an equation, start by showing
that 3 | k; then, write k = 3l and conclude that l ≤4 and, hence, l = 4, k = 12
and n = 23.
3. Adapt, to the present case, the discussion of Example 2.29 and the hint given to
Problem 20, page 32.
4. Let P(n) be the family of subsets of In, furnished with the metric of symmetric
difference. Show that, for 1 ≤i ≤k, the balls B(Ai; r) are pairwise disjoint.
Then, use (2.20), together with the fact that B(A1; r) ∪. . . ∪B(Ak; r) ⊂P(n).
5. Firstly, if A and B are the sets of members of two of the 1997 subcommittees,
note that the set of people who participate of exactly one of these subcommittees
is AB, so that |AB| ≥5. Now, apply the result of the previous problem.
6. Let x1, . . . , xn be the sequences in the dictionary and d the Hamming metric
(with 0 standing for big and 1 standing for small). Show that
|B(x1; 4) ∪. . . ∪B(xn; 4)| = 224.
Moreover, for 1 ≤i < j ≤n, if x ∈B(xi; 4) ∩B(xj; 4), show that d(x; xi) =
d(x; xj) = 4 and d(xi; xj) = 8. Use this fact to show that x belongs to at most
six of the balls B(xi; 4) and, then, conclude that

The other case is entirely analogous.
5. Let us argue as in the previous problem: since each number is a summand of
ﬁve sums of ﬁve consecutive numbers (around the circle), the total sum of all
possible sums of ﬁve consecutive numbers equals
(1 + 15) · 15
2
· 5 = 40 · 15.
Since there are 15 sums of ﬁve consecutive numbers, the average value of each
one of the is 40·15
15
= 40. Therefore, by the result of the previous problem, at
least one of these 15 sums is greater than or equal to 40.
6. Apply the result of Problem 4, counting the total number of color matchings of
corresponding sectors in disks A and B, in each of the 200 possible matching
positions.
7. Consider the 51 sets {0}, {1, 99}, {2, 98}, . . . , {49, 51}, {50}. Since there
are exactly 100 possible remainders upon division of an integer by 100 (the
remainder varies from 0 to 99), the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least
two of the 52 given numbers have remainders belonging to a single one of these
51 sets. Therefore, either their sum or their difference leaves remainder 0 upon
division by 100.
8. Letting n be a given natural number, take as pigeons the n + 1 numbers 1, 11,
111, . . ., 11 . . . 1 (this last one with exactly n + 1 digits 1). Let the pigeonholes
be the remainders upon division by n, i.e., 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
9. Given a natural number n, adapt the hint given to the previous problem to show,
with the aid of the pigeonhole principle, that n has multiples of the forms a =
33 . . . 300 . . . 0 and b = 77 . . . 700 . . . 0. Then, show that it is possible to choose
m ∈N such that either a + 10mb or 10ma + b has odd sum of digits.
10. Condition gcd(a, n) = 1 assures that none of the given powers of a is divisible
by n. Thus, we can distribute them in boxes labelled from 1 to n −1, according
to their remainders upon division by n. If box 1 does contain at least one of the
given powers, there is nothing left to do; otherwise, the n −1 given powers of
a shall be allocated among n −2 boxes with labels varying from 2 to n −1. By
pigeonhole’s principle, there exists 2 ≤k ≤n −1 such that the box labelled k
contains at least two distinct powers of a, say ai and aj, with 1 ≤i < j ≤n−1.
Then, we have ai = ns + k and aj = nt + k, for some s, t ∈Z, and it follows
that
ai(aj−i −1) = aj −ai = n(t −s).
Therefore, n | ai(aj−i −1) and, since gcd(n, ai) = 1, we conclude that n |
(aj−i −1).

11. If one of the n sums a1, a1 + a2, a1 + a2 + a3, . . ., a1 + a2 + · · · + an leaves
remainder 0 when divided by n, there is nothing else to do. Otherwise, distribute
them into boxes numbered from 1 to n −1, according to their remainders upon
division by n. Since we have n sums and n −1 boxes, pigeonhole’s principle
guarantees that at least two sums will be in a single box. Letting a1 + · · · + ak
and a1+· · ·+ak +· · ·+al be these two sums, conclude that ak +ak+1+· · ·+al
is a multiple of n.
12. Notice that each element of I2n is of the form 2kq, with k ≥0 and q ∈
{1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n −1}. Then, apply pigeonhole’s principle, with the pigeonholes
being the n odd numbers 1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n −1 and the pigeons being the n + 1
selected elements of I2n.
13. Each element u

A is of the form u

2α13α25α37α411α5. Take, as
pigeonholes, all possible sequences (˜α1, ˜α2, ˜α3, ˜α4, ˜α5), with ˜αi = 0 or 1 for
1 ≤i ≤5. Then, place u ∈A into the pigeonhole (˜α1, ˜α2, ˜α3, ˜α4, ˜α5) if and
only if αi and ˜αi have equal parities, for 1 ≤i ≤5.
14. By contraposition, assume that none of the 15 chosen elements is a prime. Then,
Corollary 6.36 guarantees that each one of these 15 numbers has a prime divisor
which is less than or equal to
√
1998 ≈44, 69. Now, notice that there are
exactly 14 primes less than or equal to 44, namely: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,
23, 29, 31, 37, 41 and 43. Since we have chosen 15 numbers, the pigeonhole
principle assures that at least two of these will be divisible by a single one of
these 14 primes and, this way, will not be relatively prime.
15. On the one hand, A has 210−1 = 1023 nonempty subsets. On the other, the sum
of the elements of any such subset of A is at most 90+91+92+· · ·+99 = 945.
Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two nonempty subsets of A, say B
and C, have equal sums of elements. Thus, B \ (B ∩C) and C \ (B ∩C) are
the subsets of A we are looking for.
16. If A ⊂{1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n + 1} is free of sums, we claim that |A| ≤n + 1. Indeed,
letting A = {1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n+1}, we have |A| = n+1 and A is free of sums, for
the sum of any two (not necessarily distinct) elements of A is an even number,
while all elements of A are odd. Now, let B ⊂A be such that |B| = n + 2; we
will show that B is not free of sums. If B = {x1 < x2 < · · · < xn+2}, then
1 ≤xn+2 −xn+1 < · · · < xn+2 −x1 ≤2n.
If none of these n + 1 differences xn+2 −xi belongs to B, then all of it shall
belong to {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n + 1} \ B. However, since this last set has only n
elements, pigeonhole’s principle assures that at least two of the numbers xn+2−
xi are equal. This is a contradiction
17. We ﬁrst claim that, among the n+1 chosen numbers, there are necessarily two,
say x and y, such that |x −y| ≤2. In order to verify such a claim, it sufﬁces to
apply the pigeonhole principle, distributing the n + 1 chosen elements among
the n sets {3k−2, 3k−1, 3k}, with 1 ≤k ≤n. Now, letting x and y be as above,
assume, without loss of generality, that y > x. If y −x = 1, then 4xy + 1 =
4x(x +1)+1 = (2x +1)2. If y −x = 2, then xy +1 = x(x +2)+1 = (x +1)2.

18. We shall show that f (n) = 2n. To this end, let
{1, 2, . . . , 2n} = C1 ∪C2 ∪· · · ∪Cn
be an arbitrary of If (n) into n sets. Since from n to 2n there are n + 1 integers,
the pigeonhole principle guarantees the existence of n ≤u < v ≤2n and
1 ≤i ≤n such that u, v ∈Ci. Taking a = 2u −v ≥0 and x = y = v −u ≥1
we have
{a + x, a + y, a + x + y} = {u, v} ⊂Ci;
therefore, f (n) ≤2n. Now, consider the following partition of I2n−1 into n
sets:
{1, 2, . . . , 2n −1} =


k=1
{k, k + n} ∪{n};
we shall show that the stated conditions are not fulﬁlled. Indeed, if
{a + x, a + y, a + x + y} = {u, v} ⊂Ck = {k, k + n},
then a + x = a + y = k and a + x + y = k + n, so that x = n and a =
k −x = k −n < 0, which is an absurd. Finally, it is enough to see that
{a + x, a + y, a + x + y} has at least two elements and, hence, cannot be equal
to {n}.
19. For item (a), assume that the 21 squares of the chessboard have been painted.
Call a column black if it has at least two black squares, and white if it has at
least two white squares. Since we have seven columns, the pigeonhole principle
assures that at least four of them are of the same color, say (without loss of
generality) black. We can also assume that these are the ﬁrst four columns
of the chessboard, from left to right. If any of these four columns has three
black squares, there is nothing left to do: it sufﬁces to take two black squares of
another columns to get a rectangle with four black squares in the corners (see
Fig. 22.1).
Otherwise, in each of these four black columns there are exactly 2 black
squares. Since in a single column there are exactly three ways of choosing these
two black squares, the pigeonhole principle assures that at least two of the four

For item (b), the total number of ways of choosing 2 out of 4 squares is

6. Thus, we have to paint black exactly two squares in each of the six columns,
choosing the two black squares at the columns in all six possible distinct ways
(for instance, squares 1 and 2 in the ﬁrst column, 1 and 3 in the second, 1 and
4 in the third, 2 and 3 in the fourth, 2 and 4 in the ﬁfth and 3 and 4 in the
sixth—see Fig. 22.3).
20. Choose any person, say A; by the pigeonhole principle, A exchange letters on a
single subject with at least ⌊16−1
3 ⌋+ 1 = 6 other people. Now, looking at these
six people, there are two cases to consider: either there are two of them which
correspond on the same subject as that of the letters they received/wrote to A—
and in this case there is nothing left to do—or any two of them correspond on
another one of the two left subjects. In this last case, repeat the above reasoning,
applying the pigeonhole principle to these six people, with any two of them
exchanging letters on one of two possible subjects.

3. Give a convex polygon A1A2 . . . AkAk+1, its interior is equal to the union of
the interiors of the convex polygons A1A2 . . . *
Ai . . . AkAk+1, where the*over
Ai means that such a vertex is excluded. Hence, O belongs to one of these
convex k-gons, say A1A2 . . . Ak. Now, insert an induction hypothesis and show
directly that, for some 1 ≤i ≤k, at least one of the angles ̸ AiOAk+1 is not
acute.
4. Make complete induction on the number k of sides of the polygon. For the
induction step, consider a polygon P of n vertices, and draw some of its
diagonals in such a way that no two of them intersect in the interior of P.
Assume, without loss of generality, that these diagonals partitionate P into
triangles. Fix one of the traced diagonals, say AB, and let P1 and P2 be the
two polygons into which P gets divided by AB. Use the induction hypothesis
to show that P1 and P2 possess a vertex different from A and B, which is not
incident to none of the drawn diagonals.
5. By induction hypothesis, suppose we can paint k towers as described, for a
certain k < n2. Place k+1 towers in the chessboard, discard the left and upmost
tower and apply the induction hypothesis to the k remaining towers. Then, paint
the discarded tower with a color (out of the three given ones) distinct from the
color(s) used to paint the towers (if any) which are closest to and belong to the
same line or column of the discarded one.
6. Suppose that the given property is true for k lines, and draw the (k + 1)-th, say
r. Choose one of the semiplanes into which r divides the plane and maintain
the colors of all regions situated in this semiplane (even those resulting from a
division of a former region in two by r); then, change the colors of all regions
contained in the opposite semiplane (again, even those coming from a division
of a former region in two by r).
7. Make induction on the number of columns of the board (independently of the
total number of lines). To this end, say that the chessboard is é blue (resp. red)
if the queen can visit all of its blue (resp. red) squares as prescribed in the
statement of the problem. For the induction step, apply the induction hypothesis
to the m × n board obtained from an m × (n + 1) one by the exclusion of
its rightmost column. Upon doing this, consider three separate cases: (i) the
smaller board is blue but nor red; (ii) the smaller board is red but not blue; (iii)
the smaller board is at the same time blue and red. In case (i), if the erased
column has any blue square, then at least one of the remaining squares of the
line of this blue square is also blue; show that, this being the case, the bigger
chessboard is also blue. In case (ii), argue in an analogous way. Finally, in case
(iii), start by observing that we can assume that if any square of the erased
column is blue (resp. red), then the remaining squares of the same line of
this blue (resp. red) square are all red (resp. blue). Let the queen walk along
a diagonal of the board to show that it still is blue and red.

9. Make complete induction on n. For the induction step, assume the desired
property to be true for 1 ≤n ≤k, with k ∈N, and consider 2k + 2
points satisfying the given hypotheses. Let P be the smallest convex polygon
containing such points (so that the vertices of P are some of these points).
Consider two cases separately:
(i) There are two consecutive vertices A and B of P such that A is blue and B
is red: draw AB and apply the induction hypothesis.

10. Let us make induction on n. For n = 1 we can take k1 = 3. Suppose the
conclusion to be true for n = l, and consider a set of m points in the space,
no four of which being coplanar and each line segment joining two of them
having one of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , l, l + 1 associated to it. Fix one of these m
points, say A, and look at the m −1 line segments joining A to the remaining
m −1 points. Since each one of these m −1 segments has associated to it one
of l + 1 given numbers, the pigeonhole principle assures that, out of these l + 1
numbers, a certain number x is associated to at least

distinct segments. If M ≥kl, we can choose points A1, A2, . . . , Akl such that
the line segments AAi (1 ≤i ≤kl) have x associated to themselves. We now
look at the line segments joining two of the points A1, A2, . . . , Akl. If one

of them, say AiAj, also has x associated to itself, there is nothing left to do:
AAiAj will be a triangle with x associated to all of its sides. Otherwise, points
A1, A2, . . . , Akl will be a set of kl points in space, no four of which being
coplanar and with one of the l numbers 1, . . . , x −1, x +1, . . . , l +1 associated
to each of the line segments joining two of them. By induction hypothesis, we
get the existence of a triangle having the desired properties. In order to ﬁnish,
it sufﬁces to note that M ≥kl if m ≥(l + 1)(kl −1) + 2.
Section 4.3
1. In each item from (a) to (d) one has to check that the corresponding relation is
reﬂexive, antisymmetric and transitive. For item (a), we already know that a = a;
a ≤b and b ≤a imply a = b; a ≤b and b ≤c imply a ≤c. The veriﬁcation
for (b) is quite similar, and we just point out that if Y and Z are subsets of X
satisfying Y ⊂Z and Z ⊂Y, then Y = Z. We leave item (c) as an equally
easy exercise for the reader, referring to items (a) and (b) of Proposition 6.5
(if he/she ﬁnds it necessary) for complete arguments. Finally, for item (d), the
desired properties are inherited from those of ⪯in A.
2. Apply Mirsky’s theorem to A, partially ordered by the divisibility relation.
3. If (A, ⪯) is a partially ordered set such that |A| = ab + 1, with a, b ∈N,
and c = min{a, b}, then A contains a chain of c + 1 elements. The proof is an
easy adaptation of the proof of Theorem 4.25. It starts by letting n = ab + 1,
A = {x1, . . . , xn} and ˜A = {(i, xi); 1 ≤i ≤n}, ordered by ⪯1, where
(i, xi) ⪯1 (j, xj) ⇔(i = j) or (i < j and xi ⪯xj).
The rest of the proof goes on almost unchanged.
4. Make induction on m, ﬁrst noticing that the case m = 1 corresponds to the case
a = b in the Erdös-Szekeres theorem. For the induction step, write n2m + 1 as
(n2)2m−1 + 1 and apply the Erdös-Szekeres theorem again.
5. Let x ∈A ∩B and assume, by the sake of contradiction, that A and B have
distinct lengths, with B being the longest. Let A1 = {y ∈A; y ⪯x}, A2 = {y ∈
A; x ⪯y}, B1 = {z ∈B; z ⪯x}, B2 = {z ∈B; x ⪯z}. Show that A1 ∪B2 and
A2 ∪B1 are chains, and at least one of then is longer than A.
6. For item (a), assume that Ai ∩B0 = ∅for some index 1 ≤i ≤k, apply
the pigeonhole principle and arrive at a contradiction to the fact that B0 is
an antichain. For item (b), start by letting Bi be an antichain of k elements
containing xi. If j ̸= i, show that Aj ∩Bi ̸= ∅, take y ∈Aj ∩Bi and
successively conclude that y ⪯xj and xj ̸⪯xi. Now, reverse the roles of i
and j to show that xi ̸⪯xj. For item (c), i., start by observing that Bi \ {xi} is
an antichain of k −1 elements in A \ C. On the other hand, if A \ C contained
an antichain B of k elements, then B would intersect {z ∈Ai; xi ≺z}, which

contradicts the deﬁnition of xi. For (c), ii., the induction hypothesis guarantees
that A \ C = C1 ∪. . . ∪Ck−1, with C1, . . . , Ck−1 being pairwise disjoint chains;
since C is itself a chain, we thus obtain A = C1 ∪. . . ∪Ck−1 ∪C, a union of
k pairwise disjoint chains. Finally, for (d), i. follows from the hypothesis of (d),
together with the fact that a is a maximal element. Subitem ii. is straightforward:
A = {a} ∪A1 ∪. . . ∪Ak.
Section 4.4
1. No. On the one hand, one can easily prove that, after any number of operations,
each bottle will contain an amount of water expressed in liters by a fraction of
the form a
2k , with a, k ∈N. On the other hand, if one could reach the situation
in which every bottle has the same amount of water, then each one of them
would contain 11
6 l of water.
2. Show that the trinomial’s discriminant is an invariant for the allowed operations.
3. No! To see why, ﬁrst look at the chessboard with its usual alternate black and
white painting. Since each 2 × 1 rectangle covers exactly one black and one
white square, after we have distributed any number of rectangular pieces, these
will have covered equal numbers of black and white squares (this is the invariant
that will solve the problem). Nevertheless, when we cut out two opposite
squares, the remaining 62 squares of the chessboard comprise 32 squares of
one color and 30 of the other. Hence, the cut out chessboard cannot be covered
as asked.
4. If at some moment we replace a and b by |a−b|, then the difference between the
sums of the numbers written on the blackboard before and after the operation is
(a + b) −|a −b|, which is always even. Therefore, the parity of the sum of the
numbers written on the blackboard at any moment is an invariant with respect
to the allowed operations. Now, observe that 1 + 2 + · · · + 1997 = 999 · 1999,
which is odd.
5. If S and S′ denote the sum of the numbers of two consecutive lists of six
numbers, check that S′ ≡S (mod 7). Then, note that 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21
and 3 + 7 + 2 + 15 + 8 + 8 = 43, but 21 ̸≡43 (mod 7).
6. Label the coins consecutively from 1 to 10. Then, associate to each coin a
weight, which is 0 if the coin is showing head, or is equal to the label of the
coin, if it shows tail. Then, verify that each move does not change the parity of
the sum of the weights associated to the coins.
7. Firstly, distribute the members in the two houses at random, and let S denote
the sum of the numbers of enemies that each member has in the house he/she is
in. Now, choose a member and look at his/her number of enemies within his/her
present house; if this is 2, then move him/her to the other house and note that
this operation diminishes the value of S. Now, repeat this as long as possible.
8. Note that a + b + ab + 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1). Therefore, if at a certain moment
the numbers written on the blackboard are x1, x2, . . . , xk, then the value of the

22
Hints and Solutions
559
expression (x1 +1)(x2 +1) . . . (xk +1) does not change. In the beginning, such
a value was (1 + 1)(2 + 1) . . . (n + 1) = (n + 1)!. Hence, letting x denote
the number written on the blackboard after n −1 operations, we have x + 1 =
(n + 1)!, so that x = (n + 1)! −1.
9. No! In order to prove this, let a, b, c, d and a′, b′, c′, d′, respectively, denote
the quantities of cards at the vertices of the square (in the clockwise sense),
immediately before and after some step. If f (w, x, y, z) = w −x + y −z, it is
immediate to check that f (a′, b′, c′, d′) −f (a, b, c, d) = ±3k, where k is the
number of cards removed from one of the vertices at that step. In particular,
f (a′, b′, c′, d′) ≡f (a, b, c, d) (mod 3).
Thus, the remainder of f (w, x, y, z) upon division by 3 is an invariant asso-
ciated to the allowed operations. Now, if there were a sequence of operations
leading from the ﬁrst to the second conﬁguration, we should have
f (1, 9, 8, 9) ≡f (1, 0, 0, 0) or f (1, 9, 8, 9) ≡f (0, 1, 0, 0) (mod 3),
which is an absurd.
10. Start by drawing n line segments satisfying condition (a) and with distinct
endpoints. Then, let A1 and A2 be blue points and V1 and V2 be red ones, such
that A1V1 and A2V2 are two of the drawn line segments. If A1V1 ∩A2V2 ̸= ∅,
erase them and draw A1V2 and A2V1 instead. Now, use the (geometric) triangle
inequality to show that the sum of the lengths of the n drawn line segments
decreased. Finally, use the ﬁniteness of the set of points, together with the semi-
invariant consisting of the sum of the lengths of the n line segments, to show
that, at some moment, condition (b) will be satisﬁed too.
11. A will do. To see why, let us paint the unit cubes black and white, so that
adjacent cubes have different colors and each player moves from a unit cube of
one color to another one of the other color. We consider two cases: • n is even:
group the unit cubes into n3/2 blocks 1 × 1 × 2 and make A start in a white
cube, always moving to the black cube of the same 1 × 1 × 2 block. • n is odd:
assume, without loss of generality, that the unit cubes placed at the corners of
the bigger one are black. Ignore one of these black unit cubes and group the
remaining n3 −1 ones into (n3 −1)/2 blocks 1 × 1 × 2; again, A should start
in the white cube of a block and follow the strategy of the ﬁrst case.
12. For item (a), number the unit squares of the chessboard, modulo 4, as shown
in the table below, noticing that there are 16 squares with each integer from 0
to 3. Any piece of one of the displayed shapes (and this is the invariant!) will
occupy four unit squares such that the sum of the numbers written on them is a
multiple of 4.

For item (b), take ﬁve unit squares of the chessboard, placed as shown in the
ﬁgure below:
a
b
c
d
e
If it was possible to number the squares as desired, we would have, modulo 4,
a + b + c + d ≡a + b + d + e ≡a + b + c + e ≡d + c + d + e.
Hence, it should be the case that a ≡c ≡d ≡e (mod 4). Check that this would
give 30 squares of the chessboard with numbers all congruent modulo 4, which
is impossible.
13. Whatever the way of placing the cubes such that the faces touching the table
form the board of a 6 × 6 square, each cube will have 3 visible and 3 invisible
faces. For any such placement of the cubes, let vB and vW respectively denote
the numbers of black and white visible faces. Since
|vB −vW| ≡vB −vW ≡vB + vW = 60 ≡0 (mod 2),
we conclude that |vB −vW| is always even (here we have the invariant!).
Assume, without loss of generality, that vW > vB, and hence that vW ≥31
and vB ≤29. Show that there is at least one cube with more invisible than
visible black faces, and then that it is possible to change the position of this
cube in such a way that |vB −vW| decreases two units.
14. Note that, after any number of operations, the quantity, say n, of written
numbers does not change. On the other hand, thanks to the property we alluded
to before the statement of the problem, the product P of the written numbers
also does not change. Since there is just a ﬁnite number of ways of representing
P as a product of n positive integers, there is a largest positive integer m that
appears in the blackboard at some moment. We claim that such a number
is a multiple of all the other ones written at this moment. For the sake of
contradiction, assume that, at this moment, some number k written on the
blackboard does not divide m. Then lcm (m, k) > m, so that changing m and

k by gcd(m, k) and lcm (m, k), we conclude that m is not the largest possible
number to appear on the blackboard. This is an absurd! Thus, by this claim,
when m appears on the blackboard, the written numbers are m1, m2, . . . , mn−1
and mn = m, with m1, m2, . . . , mn−1 dividing m. Now, show that m will always
be on the blackboard, so that, for all purposes, the subsequent operations go on
as if we were operating only with m1, . . . , mn−1. Then, we can use the same
argument as above with these n−1 numbers, thus concluding that, after a ﬁnite
number of operations, we shall reach a situation in which the written numbers
x1, x2, . . . , xn are such that x1 | x2 | · · · xn1 | xn. From this time on, nothing
changes on the blackboard.

1. Consider a graph whose vertices are the 100 guests and in which two vertices
are adjacent if and only if the corresponding guests know each other. Then,
apply the result of Corollary 5.6.
2. Look at the possible degrees of a vertex of a graph with n vertices and, then,
apply the pigeonhole principle. You may ﬁnd it useful to review the discussion
of Example 4.2.
3. Assume, without loss of generality, that V1 = V2 = In, for some n ∈N. If
f : In →In is an isomorphism between G1 and G2, then f is a permutation
of In; show that, applying f to the rows of Adj(G1), we get Adj(G2). Argue
similarly for the converse.
4. Let G1 = (V1; E1), G2 = (V2; E2) and G3 = (V3; E3) be given graphs. If
f : V1 →V2 (resp. g : V2 →V3) is a graph isomorphism between G1 and G2
(resp. between G2 and G3), show that f −1 : V2 →V1 (resp. g ◦f : V1 →V3)
is a graph isomorphism between G2 and G1 (resp. between G1 and G3). For
reﬂexivity, use the identity, Id : V1 →V1.
5. If V = {u1, . . . , un} and G = (V ; E) is a labelled graph, then E ⊂P2(V );
conversely, given E ⊂P2(V ), we obtain a labelled graph G = (V ; E). Hence,
it sufﬁces to count the number of distinct subsets E of P2(V ), which is 2(n
2).
6. Assume that such a graph, say G, does exist, and let a and b be its vertices of
degree 1 and c its vertex of degree 6. Since the graph has seven vertices, c must
be adjacent to both a and b. Therefore, if H is the graph obtained from G by
the excision of a and b, then H has ﬁve vertices, of degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 and 4
(recall that c has lost two of its edges). But this is an absurd, for in H we have a
vertex of degree 5 which can have at most four neighbors. Alternatively, apply
Havel-Hakimi’s algorithm.
7. Try to build the graph by imposing that the vertex of degree 3 is not adjacent
to that of degree 6. Then, observe that the vertex of degree 6 must be adjacent
to those of degrees 1, 1, 2, 4, 4 and 5. Alternatively, apply Havel-Hakimi’s
algorithm.

u1, v1, . . . , uk−1, vk−1, with dG(ui) = dG(vi) = i for 1 ≤i ≤k −1, add a
vertex u to G and make it adjacent to u1, . . . , uk−1; then, add a vertex v and
make it adjacent to u.
9. Item (a) follows from the fact that, for given u, v ∈V , we have uv ∈E or
uv ∈Ec; hence, NG(u) ∩NG(u) = ∅and NG(u) ∪NG(u) = V \ {u}, so that
dG(u) + dG(u) = #(NG(u) ∪NG(u)) = #(V \ {u}) = n −1.
For item (b), it sufﬁces to observe that E ∩Ec = ∅and E ∪Ec = P2(V ), so

11. G −B = (V \ B; E′), where E′ is the set of edges of G which are not incident

12. For item (a), note ﬁrstly that both G −u and G|V (G)\{u} have V (G) \ {u} as set
of vertices. Now, if ϵ is an edge of G, then ϵ is an edge of G−u if and only if ϵ
is not incident to u, which is the same as asking that ϵ be an edge of G|V (G)\{u}.
Finally, the proof of (b) is analogous to that of (a), once w apply the discussion
of the previous problem.
13. The only vertices of G which change degree in H are u and v, and they do so
in such a way that dH(u) = dG(u) + 1 and dH(v) = dG(v) + 1. Now, there are
three essentially distinct possibilities: (i) u and v have odd degrees in G: then,
u and v have even degrees in H, so that H has two odd degree vertices less than
G; (ii) u and v have even degrees in G: then, u and v have odd degrees in H,
so that H has two vertices of odd degree more than G; (iii) u has even degree
and v has odd degree in G: then, u has odd degree and v has even degree in H,
so that H has exactly the same number of vertices of odd degree as G. For the
second part, let us start with a graph G = (V ; E), with E = {ϵ1, . . . , ϵm}. For
0 ≤k ≤m, let Gk = (V ; Ek), with Ek = {ϵk+1, . . . , ϵm} for 0 ≤k < m, and
Em = ∅. If vk denotes the number of vertices of odd degree in Gk, then vm = 0

However, by the ﬁrst part of the problem, we have vk −vk+1 = −2, 0 or 2, so
that vk −vk+1 is always even. Therefore, v0, as a sum of even summands, is
also even.
14. Item (a) will be left to the reader. For item (b), if m = 2n and 1 ≤i, j ≤2n,
then
{i, j} ∈E ⇔j ≡i ± n(mod 2n).
From this, conclude that vertex i +n (modulo 2n) is the only neighbor of vertex
i; also, the edges of G(2n, n) are those joining vertices i and i + n, for 1 ≤
i ≤n, so that there are exactly n edges. For item (c), given 1 ≤i ≤m,
show that vertex i is adjacent to vertices i + n and i −n (modulo m) and that
i + n ̸= i −n (modulo m), thus giving d(i) = 2; for what is left to do, use
Euler’s theorem to conclude that |E| = m. Finally, in what concerns item (d),
show that Id : Im →Im is an isomorphism between G(m, n) and G(m, m−n).
15. Verify that the desired graph is the one depicted in Fig. 5.4.
16. Firstly, note that the very deﬁnition of bipartite graph assures that, for u, v ∈V ,
we have uv ∈E ⇒u ∈V1 and v ∈V2, or vice-versa. Hence, we can identify
E with a subset of V1 × V2 through the injection uv →(u, v), if u ∈V1 and
v ∈V2. Therefore, |E| ≤|V1 × V2| = |V1| · |V2|, with equality if and only if
E = V1 × V2.
17. If |V1| = |W1| and |V2| = |W2|, take bijections f1 : V1 →W1 and f2 : V2 →
W2; then, let f : V1 ∪V2 →W1 ∪W2 be given by setting f|V1 = f1 and
f|V2 = f2, and show that f is an incidence-preserving bijection. Conversely,
let f : V1 ∪V2 →W1 ∪W2 be an incidence-preserving bijection. Since V1 is
an independent set, the same happens to f (V1). Hence, f (V1) cannot intersect
both W1 and W2, so that f (V1) ⊂W1 or f (V1) ⊂W2. Assume that f (V1) ⊂
W1 (the other case is entirely analogous). Since every vertex in V2 is adjacent to
every vertex in V1, we conclude that every vertex in f (V2) is adjacent to every
vertex in f (V1) ⊂W1; then, it follows from the fact that W1 is an independent
set that f (V2) does not intersect W1, i.e., f (V2) ⊂W2. Now,
|V1 ∪V2| = |f (V1 ∪V2)| = |f (V1)| + |f (V2)|
≤|W1| + |W2| = |W1 ∪W2| = |V2 ∪V2|,
with the last equality coming from the fact that f is an isomorphism. Therefore,
|f (V1)| = |W1| and |f (V2)| = |W2|, so that f (V1) = W1 and f (V2) = W2.
Finally, this gives |V1| = |W1| and |V2| = |W2|.
19. Assume that G has l vertices of degree 5 in V1 and k vertices of degree 8, so that
|V1| = k + l and |V2| = 16 −l. Since the graph is bipartite, the edges departing
from V1 are incident to vertices in V2, and vice-versa. Hence, 8k+5l = 5(16−l)
or, which is the same, 4k + 5l = 40. It is now immediate to verify that the
nonnegative integer solutions of such an equation, with k > 0, are (k, l) =
(5, 4) or (10, 0). In each one of these cases, exhibit the corresponding bipartite
graph.

those of a regular n-gon, and consider the two following cases: (i) if r = 2m <

21. Let P1, P2, . . . , P11 be the patrols and h1, h2, . . . , hn be the volunteers, and join
hi to Pj if hi is a member of Pj. Also, let k be the number of members of each
patrol and Ai be the set of men in patrol Pj. Since we have n men altogether, it

Now, let us count the number of edges of our (bipartite) graph in two distinct
ways: on the one hand, since each man has degree 2, we have a total of 2n
edges; on the other hand, since each patrol has degree k, the number of edges
is equal to 11k. Thus, 2n = 11k. Finally, solving the linear system of equations
n = 11k −55
2n = 11k.

Then, G has 13 vertices and 13 edges, and all vertices have degree 2. Now, look
at the sets of vertices A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13} and B = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; we
can have at most two edges joining pairs of elements of A: one joining 1 and 4
and another joining 10 and 13. Since we have 13 edges altogether, two of them
departing from each vertex, we conclude that at least 4 · 2 + 4 · 1 = 12 edges
join elements of A to elements of B. Since B has ﬁve elements, the pigeonhole
principle guarantees that at least one of them must receive at least three edges,
which is an absurd.
25. Item (a) is immediate and (b) follows from the deﬁnitions of chain, antichain,

16. We ﬁrst claim that G −ϵ has at most two connected components. In order to
prove this, let ϵ = {u, v}, and let w ̸= u, v be another vertex of G. Since
G is connected, we have in G a path C joining w and u. Now, there are two
possibilities: (i) C does not pass through ϵ: then, we have in G−ϵ a path joining
w and u; (ii) C passes through ϵ: since the vertices of C are pairwise distinct and
u is the last one of them, the next to last must necessarily be v; hence, stopping
the path C in v, we obtain a path in G −ϵ joining w to v. Anyhow, every vertex
of G −ϵ can be joined to u or v by a path in G −ϵ, so that G −ϵ has at
most two connected components: one containing u and another containing v.
We now claim that G −ϵ has at least two connected components. Indeed, if
G −ϵ was connected, it would contain a path joining u and v, and such a path
would necessarily have length at least 2; adding edge ϵ to such a path would
give us a cycle in G, which is an absurd.

them, reach an analogous contradiction. Then, conclude that there is one of
these remaining n−1 cities such that one cannot leave it to another one of them

19. Given an optimal path C = (c0, c1, . . . , cn2−1), we say that an edge of a unit
square is traversed if it is a common edge of two consecutive unit squares ci
and ci+1 of the path. Consider the graph G having as its vertices all of the
(n+1)2 vertices of all of the n2 unit squares of the chessboard, and as its edges
the traversed edges of the unit squares. We classify the vertices of G in three
distinct types: (I) the four vertices at the corners of the chessboard; (II) the
remaining 4(n −1) vertices at the edges of the chess; (III) the (n −1)2 vertices
lying in the interior of the chessboard. Letting dv denote the degree of vertex v,
we have dv ≤3 for every v. Now, note that a path C contains an U if and only if
some vertex has degree 3. By the sake of contradiction, assume that an optimal
path C does not contain an U and conclude, with the aid of Euler’s theorem, that
the number m of traversed edges is at most n2 −1. Then, show that m = n2 −1

22. Start by noticing that such a problem is a natural generalization of Problem 3.
Then, adapt to the present setting the discussion of Example 2.29 and the hint
given to Problem 20, page 32.
23. Let G be a graph satisfying the stated conditions, ﬁx a vertex u of G and count
its neighbors and the neighbors of their neighbors to conclude that k ≥5. If
k = 5, conclude that such a counting computed exactly one vertex of G twice,
and that such vertex is neither u nor a neighbor of u. Then, show that u belongs
to a single 4-cycle in G and, by the arbitrariness of u, that G can be partitioned
into 4-cycles, which is an absurd. If k = 6, construct a graph G of 25 vertices
in the following way:
•
The set V of vertices of G is the disjoint union V = 5
i=1 Ai, where each Ai
is a set of ﬁve vertices and the subgraph Gi of G induced by Ai is a 5-cycle.
•
For 1 ≤i < j ≤5, establish a bijection φij : Ai →Aj such that, if
x, y ∈Ai are adjacent in Gi, then φij(x) and φij(y) are nonadjacent in Gj.
Then, impose that x and φij(x) are adjacent in G, for all x, i and j as above.
Finally, show that the graph G thus constructed satisﬁes the stated condition.
24. Let us interpret the problem in the language of Graph Theory, in the following
way: associate a vertex to each room and put an edge between two vertices
if and only if there is a door between the corresponding rooms. For two rows
of n rooms each, the condition in the statement of the problem amounts to
the connectedness of the resulting graph Gn (of 2n vertices). Now, let an be
the number of connected graphs Gn satisfying the given conditions. Firstly,
check that a1 = 1 and a2 = 5. Then, use a recursive argument to show that
an+1 = 4an + bn, where bn is the number of graphs Gn having exactly two
connected components. Finally, show that bn = 1 + 2a1 + 2a2 + · · · + 2an−1
and conclude, from this last recurrence, that an+2 = 5an+1 −2an for every
n ≥1.
Section 5.3
1. For the ﬁrst part, prove that (a) ⇒(c) ⇒(b) ⇒(a). For the second, the
established equivalences assure that the number of distinct paths in a tree with n
vertices is equal to the number of distinct ways of choosing two of its vertices.
2. If u is a vertex of T with degree k, show that T −u has k connected components,
all of which are themselves trees. Then, apply the result of Lemma 5.32.
3. For item (a), use the result of Proposition 5.33. For (b), show that if T ∪{ϵ}
did not contain cycles, then T would not be a spanning tree of G. For item (c),
assume that G is not a tree and, hence, that it contains some cycle; show that G
has at least two spanning trees.

that of any other spanning tree.

item (b), start by painting a leaf of T , say in blue. Then, if some (but not all)
vertices of T have already been painted, choose a vertex v of T which has not
been painted yet and is adjacent to an already painted vertex u, and paint v with
the color distinct from that of u. Continue this way until there are no unpainted
vertices in T . For (c), show that a path has odd weight if and only if its endpoints
have distinct colors. Then, use the hint given to the second part of Problem 1.
Finally, for (d), use the results of (a) and (c), together with the fact that x+y = n.
Section 5.4
1. Given a vertex a of G and changing G by G, if necessary, we can assume that
dG(a) ≥3. Now, take vertices u, v and w in NG(a). If two of these vertices,
say u and v, are adjacent in G, then a, u and v are the vertices of a K3 in G.
Otherwise, u, v and w are the vertices of a K3 in G.
2. Under the assumptions of (a), the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least
one of the remaining 2q −2 vertices will receive at least ⌊(2q−2)+1
2q−1
⌋+ 1 = 2
edges from {u, v}; if w is such a vertex, then uvw is a K3 in G. If we are as in
(b), then G −{u, v} has 2q −2 = 2(q −1) vertices and at least (q2 + 1) −
((2q −2)+1) = (q −1)2 +1 edges. By induction hypothesis, G−{u, v} (and,
hence, G) contains a K3.
3. Apply the result of the previous problem.
4. Adapt, to the present case, the solution to Problem 2. More precisely, start by
taking (from the result of that problem) a K3 in G, with vertices a, b and c.
Now, if one of the remaining seven vertices is adjacent to all of a, b and c, there
is nothing to do. Otherwise, assume that k of the remaining seven vertices are
adjacent to at least two of a, b and c, whereas the remaining 7 −k are adjacent
to at most one of a, b and c. Then, we have at least k + 1 K3’s and at least
26 −3 −(2k + (7 −k)) = 16 −k edges in G −{a, b, c}. If k ≥4, there is
nothing to do. Otherwise, k ≤3. Separately consider the cases k = 0, 1, 2 and
3, arguing in the same way as above.
5. Let u1, . . . , ul−1 be the vertices of a Kl−1 in G. If u1, . . . , ul−1 are all adjacent
to at least one of the remaining n −(l −1) = (l −1)(q −1) vertices of G, then
we have a Kl in G. Otherwise, at most (l−2)(n−(l−1)) = (l−1)(l−2)(q−1)
edges depart from one of u1, . . . , ul−1 to the remaining vertices. Then, H :=
G −{u1, . . . , ul−1} has (l −1)(q −1) vertices and at least

6. Construct a graph G having the teams as vertices and such that two of them are
adjacent if they have played against each other. The stated conditions assure
that α(G) ≤2, and Proposition 5.46 that ω(G) ≤2. Conclude that G has at
most 100 edges and, then, apply item (b) of Problem 9, page 132, to show that
the tournament must have at least 90 matches. In order to build an example
with exactly 90 matches, divide the teams in two groups of 10 and, within each
group, let each two teams have a match.
7. Model the given situation by means of a graph, having the given people as
vertices and with two people being adjacent if and only if they know each other.
Then, use the given conditions to obtain upper bounds for α(G) and α(G).
8. Let two of the given points, say A and B, be joined by an edge if and only if
̸ AOB > 120◦. Elementary geometry guarantees that the resulting graph G
does not contain a K3’s. Therefore, Turán’s theorem assures that G has at most
T (21; 3) = 110 edges. Now, note that the number of arcs we wish to count is
equal to the number of edges of G, i.e.

2. If G is the resulting graph, use Ptolemy’s theorem on cyclic quadrilaterals
(cf. Chapter 7 of [9]) to show that G does not contain a K4. Then, apply Turán’s
theorem to get the desired upper estimate on the number of edges in G.
10. Consider the graph G having the n people as vertices and such that two people
are adjacent if and only if they are friends. Start by observing that G has q edges
and, by the stated conditions, does not contain K3’s. Show that, for each vertex
u of G, the number of amicable pairs that can be formed from the enemies of
u is equal to q −
v∈N(u) d(v); from this, conclude that we wish to assure the
existence of a vertex u of G for which 

11. Let m = ⌊n

k−1 ⌋. Also, let A be the set formed by the vertices
u of G such that d(u) ≤p, and B = V (G) \ A, so that d(v) ≥p + 1 for every
v ∈B. Assume, by contradiction, that |A| < m and, hence, that |B| > n −m.
Use Turán’s theorem to show that G|B contains a Kk which is a contradiction.
12. Let G be the graph having the 1001 people as vertices and such that two people

only if the sets A + α and A + β are disjoint (here, A + k := {x + k; x ∈

elements α and β of S if |α−β| ̸= |ai −aj|, for all distinct 1 ≤i, j ≤101. Use
the fact that #{|ai −aj|; 1 ≤i < j ≤101} ≤101· 100

7. Start by showing that a natural number is a multiple of 10 if and only if it is
at the same time a multiple of 2 and 5. Thus, since the given number is clearly
even, it sufﬁces to show that it is a multiple of 5; to this end, use the result of
Example 6.3.
8. Use the result of item (b) of Example 6.3.
9. In item (c), in order to show that S ⊂nZ, use the division algorithm and the
minimality of n.
10. Start by analysing the ﬁrst part of the problem. To this end, write 264 + 1 =
(264 −1) + 2 and factorise 264 −1.
11. Start by applying the existence part of the division algorithm to write m =

16. Expanding the given equality we obtain (x + y)(x + z) = 2xz. Conclude that
one of the sides of this last equality is a multiple of 4, while the other is not.
17. Apply items (a) and (b) of Corollary 6.8.
18. For item (b), use the result of (a); for (a), write n = 7q + r, with r =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and compute n3.
19. We certainly have n > 1, and can assume x ≤y < z; if x = y, start by showing
that n = 2; if x < y, write 1 = ny−x(nz−y −1).
20. For k ≥5, show that k! end with 0; then, use the result of Example 6.10.
21. Use the result of Example 6.10.
22. For item (a), write n = 2rq, with r being a nonnegative integer and q an odd

23. By the sake of contradiction, assume this is not the case, and let N ∈N be such
that
n ≥N ⇒s(3n+1) > s(3n).
Problem 1 assures that s(3k) is a multiple of 9 for k ≥2, so that
s(3n+1) ≥s(3n) + 9, ∀n ≥N.
Adding the above inequality for n = N, N + 1, . . . , M −1 to get s(3M) ≥
s(3N)+9(M −N) = 9(M −c),for some integer c < M, which doesn’t depend
on the chosen M ≥N. Now, note that 3M < 10M−c for all sufﬁciently large M
(cf. Section 7.2 of [8], for instance); however, since the greatest possible value
for s(m) when m < 10M−c is
s(10M−c −1) = s(99 . . . 9

6. Let d = gcd(a, b) and write a = du and b = dv, so that gcd(u, v) = 1.
Conclude that ab | (a2 + b2) if and only if uv | (u2 + v2). If this is so, since
u, v | uv, we have that u, v | (u2 + v2) and, hence, u | v2 and v | u2. Now,
use the fact that gcd(u, v) = 1 to obtain u = v = 1. Alternatively, write
a2 + b2 = abk, with k ∈N, and examine the discriminant of the second degree
equation x2 −(bk)x + b2 = 0, which has a as a natural root.
7. Firstly, analyse the case gcd(a, b) = 1. In this case, let the rectangle has vertices

10. If d = gcd(n2 +k, (n+1)2 +k), then d | [((n+1)2 +k)−(n2 +k)]. Therefore,
d | [(2n+1)2−4(n2+k)], and from this it is easy to conclude that d | (4k+1),
and hence d ≤4k +1. Finally, exhibit a value of n for which the corresponding
gcd is equal to 4k + 1.

19. Adapt, to the present case, the several items and hints given to the previous

20. For item (a), let u and v be natural numbers such that au −bv = 1. The fact
that n > ab gives us nau −nbv = n > ab and, hence, nu

there exists an integer t such that nv
a < t < nu

Concerning (e), let S = ab −a −b and show that, for 0 ≤m ≤S, exactly one

21. For (a), arguing by contradiction, let x, y, z ∈Z+ such that 2abc −ab −bc −
ca = xbc + yac + zab. Then,
2abc = (x + 1)bc + (y + 1)ac + (z + 1)ab,
so that a | (x + 1)bc. Since gcd(a, bc) = 1, we conclude that a | (x + 1) and,
hence, that x + 1 ≥a. Similarly, y + 1 ≥b and z + 1 ≥c. But these give
(x + 1)bc + (y + 1)ac + (z + 1)ab ≥a · bc + b · ac + c · ab = 3abc,
which is a contradiction. For item (b), if n > 2abc −ab −bc −ca, then
n > a · bc −a −bc and the previous problem guarantees (since a and bc are
relatively prime) the existence of integers x, t ∈Z+ such that n = xbc + ta.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that 0 ≤x < a; indeed, if x ≥a,
write x = aq + x′, with 0 ≤x′ < a, thus obtaining n = x′bc + (t + qbc)a.
For (c), letting x ≤a −1, we have

3. We can assume that x ̸= y. If x < y, prove that x < p < y and, hence, that
gcd(p, x) = 1. Write 2xy = p(x + y) to conclude that p | y. Let y = pz,
with z ∈N, to get z =

2x−p, thus showing that (2x −p) | x and, hence, that
(2x −p) | p. Finally, this gives 2x −p = 1.
4. Start by separately considering the cases n = 6k, 6k+1, . . . , 6k+5. For n = 6k,

19. For an arbitrary prime number p, it sufﬁces to show that ep(2m) + ep(2n) ≥
ep(m)+ep(n)+ep(m+n). To this end, use Legendre’s formula, together with
item (f) of Problem 13, page 164.
20. For item (a), use Legendre’s formula to show that e2(2n) ≥2e2(n) + 1 for
every n ∈N. Alternatively, use Lagrange’s identity—cf. Example 2.9—and
induction. For item (b), reﬁne the computations of the ﬁrst hint to (a) to show
that e2(2n) ≥2e2(n) + 2 if and only if n is not a power of 2.
21. By contradiction, let d1 < d2 < √n be divisors of n, so that d1 < d2 < n

n
d1 .
Letting d1 = a, d2 = a + u, n
d2 = a + v and n
d1 = a + w, with 0 < u < v < w,
we have a(a+w) = n = (a+u)(a+v). If k ≥1 is such that (k−1)2 ≤a < k2,
we claim that k2 < a + w. Indeed, since √a < k ≤√a + 1, it sufﬁces to
show that (√a + 1)2 < a + w or which is the same, 2√a < w −1. From
a(a + w) = (a + u)(a + v) we obtain aw = au + av + uv, so that a | uv and
a ≤uv. It comes that aw = au+av+uv ≥au+av+a, whence w ≥u+v+1.
Then, w −1 ≥u + v ≥2√uv ≥2√a. Finally, we cannot have equality in the
last inequality, for otherwise u = v ⇒a + u = a + v ⇒d2 =

impossible.
22. Write n = a0 + a1 · 2 + a2 · 22 + · · · + am2m, with aj ∈{0, 1} for 0 ≤j ≤m,

23. Let p be prime and t ∈N be such that (a + kb)(b + ka) = pt. Assuming,
without loss of generality, that a ≤b, we have a + kb ≥b + ka > 1, so
that there exist r, s ∈Z for which 1 ≤r ≤s, r + s = t and a + kb = ps,
b+ka = pr. Conclude that (b+ka) | (a+kb) and, writing a+kb
b+ka = k−(k2−1)a
b+ka ,
that (b + ka) | (k2 −1). Now, consider two separate cases: (i) if p > 2, use the
fact that b+ka is a power of p and gcd(k−1, k+1) ≤2 to conclude that b+ka
divides k −1 or k + 1, so that b + ka ≤k + 1 and, hence, b = a = 1. Then,
show that the solutions are the 3-tuples (a, b, k) = (1, 1, pr −1), for every
integer r ≥1 and every prime p > 2. (ii) If p = 2, start by observing that at
least one of a and b is odd, so that k is also odd. Now, since (b + ka) | (k2 −1)
and b + ka = 2r, show that (b + ka) | 2(k + 1) or 2(k −1); in particular,
b + ka ≤2k + 2 and, hence, a = 1 or 2. If a = 2, arrive at a contradiction;
if a = 1, we have that (b + k) | 2(k + 1) or k −1, which splits the analysis
into that of two subcases: (b + k) | (2k + 2) or (b + k) | (2k −2). In the ﬁrst

subcase, show that b = k + 2 or b = 1. If b = 1, conclude that k = 2r −1;
if b = k + 2, write s = 2u to get (a, b, k) = (1, 2u + 1, 2u −1), for some
u ∈N. In the second subcase, show that b = k −2 and, then, let s = 2u to get
(a, b, k) = (1, 2u −1, 2u + 1), for some u ∈N.
24. Choose a prime p greater than 1 + 2 + · · · + 1000 and show that the set A =

25. For item (a), use the result of Problem 4, page 177, together with the fact that
p(q2k) = q for every k ≥0. For item (b), factorise q2k −1 and use the
minimality of k to conclude that one cannot have p(q2k−1 −1) > p(q2k−1).
26. If t is the product of all primes less than or equal to m, let y1 = xt1, where pt1 is
a prime greater than t. Letting p be the greatest prime divisor of y1 and r ∈N
be such that p = pr, deﬁne y2 = xt2, with t2 > r, t1, and convince yourself that
gcd(y1, y2) = 1. Once you have chosen elements y1 = xt1 < · · · < yj = xtj
of A satisfying item (b), with j < m, let p be the greatest prime factor of yj
and r ∈N such that p = pr; deﬁne yj+1 = xtj+1, with tj+1 > r, tj. Continue
in this way until j = m. Then, show that the set B thus obtained does satisfy
condition (c).
Section 7.1
1. If (x0, y0, z0) is a solution, then (x0an+1, y0an+1, z0an) is also a solution, for

2d = u2. Now,
show that gcd(u, 2v) = 1.
4. In each case, use Fermat’s descent method. Speciﬁcally for item (d), start by
showing that x and y leave equal remainders upon division by 3; then, by
computing (3k + r)3, conclude that if x and y are not divisible by 3, then
x3 + 5y3 is not divisible by 9.
5. Start by writing x = u−v and y = u+v, with u, v ∈Q, to get x2 +xy +y2 =

Then, use Cramer’s rule to reduce the problem to showing that the only solution
of the diophantine equation a3 + 2b3 + 4c3 = 6abc is a = b = c = 0. Finally,
for this last step, reduce to the case of a, b, c ∈Z and apply Fermat’s descent
method.

Finally, apply Ptolemy’s theorem (cf. Theorem 4.18 of [9], for instance) to
show that AiAj is also rational.
10. The solution we present to this problem uses more the ideas presented along
this section that any speciﬁc result we have derived. Anyhow, since it is much
more difﬁcult than the previous ones, we present a complete solution: start by
simplifying the stated relation to get a2 + c2 −ac = b2 + d2 + bd or, which is
the same,
(2a −c)2 + 3c2 = (b + 2d)2 + 3b2.
(22.1)
By contradiction, assume that ab + cd = p, with p prime. Condition a > b >
c > d > 0 gives p = ab + cd ≥4 · 3 + 2 · 1 = 14, so that p ≥17. On the
other hand,
2p = 2ab + 2cd = (2a −c)b + (b + 2d)c
and, hence, gcd(2a −c, b+2d) divides 2p. For gcd(2a −c, b+2d) to be even,
we should have b and c both even, and this would give p = ab + cd also even,
which is impossible. Therefore,
gcd(2a −c, b + 2d) = 1 or p.
We claim that gcd(2a −c, b + 2d) = 1. On the contrary, suppose that
gcd(2a −c, b + 2d) = p. Then, (22.1) would give us p2 | 3(b2 −c2); in turn,
since p ̸= 3, this would assure that p2 | (b2 −c2). However, p = ab + cd > b
forces 0 < b2 −c2 < p2, which is an absurd.

Now, let x = 2a −c and y = b + 2d. Then, gcd(x, y) = 1, and it follows
from (22.1) that x2 −y2 = 3(b2 −c2) or, which is the same,
(x −y)(x + y) = 3(b −c)(b + c).
We consider two cases separately:
(i) b and c have distinct parities: the fact that p = ab+cd gives gcd(b, c) = 1.
Since b + c and b −c are both odd, this implies gcd(b + c, b −c) = 1. An
analogous reasoning also gives gcd(x + y, x −y) = 1.
If 3 | (x + y), then
x −y = gcd(x −y, (b + c)(b −c)) = gcd(x −y, b + c) gcd(x −y, b −c)
and
x+y = 3 gcd(x+y, (b+c)(b−c)) = 3 gcd(x+y, b+c) gcd(x+y, b−c).
Writing α = gcd(x−y, b−c), β = gcd(x−y, b+c), γ = gcd(x+y, b−c)
and δ = gcd(x + y, b + c), we get x −y = αβ and x + y = 3γ δ. On the
other hand,
b −c = gcd(b −c, x −y) gcd(b −c, x + y) = αγ
and, analogously, b + c = βδ. Solving for a, b, c and d, we obtain
4a = αβ + βδ + 3γ δ −αγ, 2b = αγ + βδ,
2c = −αγ + βδ and 4d = −αβ −βδ + 3γ δ −αγ.
Thus,
8p = 8(ab + cd) = βδ(2α2 + 3δ2).
However, since b + c is odd, we conclude that both β and δ are odd and,
hence, βδ(2α2 + 3δ2) is odd too, which is impossible.
If 3 | (x −y), we reach a contradiction in a likewise manner.
(ii) b and c have equal parities: in this case, b and c must both be odd, for,
otherwise, 2 would divide ab + cd = p. Thus, in the above notations, x
and y must also be odd. It follows that
gcd(b + c, b −c) = gcd(x + y, x −y) = 2,
for we already have gcd(x, y) = 1.

2p = 2(ab + cd) = βδ(2α2 + 3δ2).
Neither β nor δ are equal to p, for, otherwise, we would have b > p, which
contradicts the fact that ab + cd = p. Therefore, βδ ≤2, and this gives
0 < d < c ≤2 −αγ ≤1, which is an absurd.

1. From Chebyschev’s theorem, there is at least one prime between pn and 2pn.
2. Letting p be the largest prime which does not exceed n, apply Chebyschev’s
theorem to show that 2p > n.
3. If n = 2k, write 1!2! . . . n! = 2kk!(3!5! . . . , (2k−1)!)2 and, then, apply the result
of the previous problem. The case n = 2k + 1 can be dealt with in an analogous
way.
4. Let p and q denote the largest primes that do not exceed m and n, respectively.
Use the result of Problem 2 to compare the greatest powers of p and q in both
sides of the given equation.
5. Start by using the result of Problem 2 to show that n = p, a prime number; to this
end, follow a path analogous to the hint given to the previous problem. Then, if q
is the greatest integer which is less than or equal to p −1, conclude that m ≥2q.
Finally, use the remark that precedes the statement of this problem to conclude
that q ≤5 and, hence, that p −1 ≤6. To solutions are m = n = 2 or m = 10,
n = 7.
6. Let n > 1 be a natural number satisfying the stated conditions, and p < √n
be a prime number. Then p | n, for otherwise we would have p2 < n and
gcd(n, p2) = 1. Thus, n is divisible by p1, . . . , pk, where p1 < · · · < pk are
those prime numbers less than √n. Now, let l ∈N be such that 2l ≤√n < 2l+1.
Since (invoking again the stronger version of Chebychev’s theorem, alluded to
above) for every integer k > 1 we have at least two integers between 2k and
2k+1, we obtain
p1 . . . pk ≥2(22 . . . 2l−1)2 = 2l2.
This way,
2l2 ≤p1 . . . pk ≤n < 22l+2,
so that l ≤2. Hence, there are three cases to consider:
(i) l = 0: in this case, we have 1 ≤n < 4, and it is immediate to check that
n = 2 or 3 are the possible solutions.
(ii) l = 1: we have 4 ≤n < 16 and 2 | n, so that n ∈{4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}. A
simple inspection show that the possible solutions are n = 4, 6, 8 or 12.
(iii) l = 2: in this last case we have that 16 ≤n < 64 and 2, 3 | n. Therefore,
n ∈{18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60} and, once more by inspection, we obtain
the solutions: n = 18, 24 or 30.

6. If all prime divisors of n were congruent to 1, modulo 4, use the elementary
properties of congruences to conclude that we were to have n ≡1 (mod 4).
7. The ﬁrst equality gives us 232 + 228 · 54 ≡0 (mod 641); the second, 228 · 54 ≡

8. Assume that the decimal representation of n has k + 1 digits, and let m be the

is equivalent to 6 · 10k + m = 4(10m + 6) or, also, to 3 · 10k = 13m + 12.

12. Start by using the result of item (c) of Problem 2, page 71, to conclude that if
d = gcd(Fn, Ln), then d | 4. Now, distinguish the cases 3 ∤n and 3 | n, and
apply the results of the previous problem.
13. For items (a) and (b), use induction on n ∈N. For item (c), start by using the
result of item (a) to write 2Fm+2k = FmL2k + F2kLm. Then use the result of
the item (b) of Problem 2, page 71, as well as (a) again, to get
2Fm+2k = Fm(L2
k + 2(−1)k−1) + FkLkLm ≡2(−1)k−1Fm (mod Lk).
Now, apply the result of item (b) of Problem 11, taking into account that 2 | k
and 3 ∤k. For item (d), argue in an analogous way, writing
2Lm+2k = 5FmF2k+LmL2k = 5FmFkLk+Lm(L2
k+2(−1)k−1)≡−2Lm (mod Lk)
and, hence, Lm+2k ≡−Lm (mod Lk).

20. Firstly, show that it sufﬁces to consider the case b = an. Then, in order
to analyse it, make induction on n ≥0, using congruence modulo a at the

21. Start by looking at the given equation modulo 3 to show that b is even. Then,
let b = 2c and conclude that 2c+1 = 15a + 1 or 2c+1 = 3a + 5a. Let d = c + 1
and, in the ﬁrst case, use modulo 3 to conclude that d is even and, hence, that
2d/2 −1 = 3a and 2d/2 + 1 = 5a. In the second case, use modulo 4 to show
that a is odd, so that, if c −2 > 0, we have
2c−2 = 3a−1 −3a−2 · 5 + · · · + 5a−1 ≡a (mod 2).
Thus, conclude that c −2 = 0.
22. Using the fact that 1992 = 24 · 83, show that the division of 101992 by 1083 + 7
leaves remainder 724. Then, if q ∈N is such that 101992 = (1083 + 7)q + 724,
use congruence modulo 10 to compute the last digit of q.
23. For item (a), if x is even, say x = 2z, we get (7z −2)(7z + 2) = 3y. Conclude
that both 7z −2 and 7z + 2 must be powers of 3, and use the fact that (7z +
2) −(7z −2) = 4 to get a contradiction. For item (b), assuming that if y > 1,
show that 7x = 3y + 4 ≡4 (mod 9), and that this gives x ≡2 (mod 3). Hence,
deduce that x ≡2 (mod 3) and x ≡1 (mod 2) implies x ≡5 (mod 6). Item (c)
now follows from letting x = 6q + 5 and computing
7x = 76q+5 = (76)q · 75 ≡(−1)q · (−2) ≡±2 (mod 13).
Finally, for (d) and (e), compute 3y ≡1, 3 or 9 (mod 13) and, hence, 3y + 4 ≡
5, 7 or 0 (mod 13); then, show that this contradicts (c).
25. Looking at the equation modulo x + 1, we obtain (−1)z+1 ≡1 (mod x + 1).
Therefore, from x > 1 show that z is odd. Now, write

xz−1 = (x + 1)y −1
x

(22.2)
Note now that (x + 1)t −1 and (x + 1)t + 1 are consecutive even numbers, so
that they have gcd equal to 2. Use modulo x to get (x + 1)t −1 ≡0 (mod x)
and (x + 1)t + 1 ≡2 (mod x), so that the ﬁrst factor is a multiple of x, whereas
the second one is of the form xq + 2, with 2 being its only common factor with
x. Use this to conclude from (22.2) that
(x + 1)t −1 = 2sz
(x + 1)t + 1 = 2z−1 .
Then, ﬁnish the solution.

−3 (mod 11). Finally, show that such congruences do not have any solutions.
5. We may assume p > 2. In this case, if n = pq + r, Fermat’s little theorem

1. Compute 214 ≡−1 (mod 29) and, then, conclude that ord29(2) = 28.
2. Separately consider each one of the cases n = 2, 4, pk and 2pk, with p being
an odd prime and k ∈N.
3. Letting a be a primitive root modulo n, note that the ai’s are congruent modulo
n, is some order, to a, a2, . . . , aϕ(n), so that
a1a2 . . . aϕ(n) ≡a

(mod n).
Now, if n = 2 or 4, give a direct argument to show that a

−1 (mod n); if n = pk or 2pk, for some odd prime p and some k ∈N,
use the fact that ordn(a) = ϕ(n) to conclude that a

careful: n | (a

4. Firstly, adapt the proof of Lemma 12.12 to the present case, showing (by
induction) that for every integer n ≥3 there exists an odd integer q such that
192n−2 = 2q + 1. Back to the posed problem, start by taking k1 = 1, and
k2 = 2. Then if 19kn −97 = 2nq and q is even, take kn+1 = kn; if q is odd,
take kn+1 = kn + 2n−2.
5. Ultimately, the solution of this problem also relies in a variation of the idea of
the proof of Lemma 12.12. Indeed, one wants to ﬁnd inﬁnitely many m ∈N
such that m2 + 7 ≡0(mod 2k). Start by showing that it sufﬁces to establish the
existence, for every l ∈N, of ml ∈N such that m2
l +7 ≡0(mod 2l); then, prove
this last statement by induction on l. For the induction step, if m2
l + 7 = 2lnl,
with l ≥3 and nl odd, try ml+1 = aml and show that it is enough to have
a2 = 2lq + 1, with q odd; then, prove that a = 52l−3 works.

6. If a3pq−1 ≡1 (mod 3pq), then a3pq−1 ≡1 (mod p); in particular, letting a be
a primitive root modulo p, we must have (p −1) | (3pq −1) and, analogously,
(q −1) | (3pq −1). From this, conclude that (p −1) | (3q −1) and (q −1) |
(3p −1), from where p = 11 and q = 17 or vice-versa. Finally, show that
a3·11·17−1 ≡1 (mod 3·11·17) for every natural number a relatively prime with
3 · 11 · 17. To show that p = 11 and q = 17 if p ≤q, one can argue in the
following manner: since p ≤q, we have
3p −1
q −1 ≤3q −1
q −1 = 3 +
2
q −1 ≤3 + 2
4,
so that 3p−1
q−1
= 1, 2 or 3; analysing each one of these cases separately, we
conclude that 3p −1 = 2(q −1) and, hence, 3q−1
p−1 = 9q−3
2q−4, a number greater
than 4 and less than 8; thus, 9q−3
2q−4 = 5, 6 or 7, and these possibilities lead to
q = 17 as the only actual one.
7. For item (d), take a separate look at each one of the cases ordp(x) = 1, 2, p−1

is also prime.
8. For (a) ⇒(b), write n = p1 . . . pk, with p1 < · · · < pk being primes such
that (pi −1) | (n −1); then, apply Fermat’s little theorem to conclude that
an ≡a (mod pi), for every 1 ≤i ≤k. For (b) ⇒(a), take a prime divisor p
of n and let a be a primitive root modulo p2 to obtain a contradiction if p2 | n;
then, let a be a primitive root modulo p, to show that (p −1) | (n −1).

For item (b), use (a) to conclude that, if n = p2q, with p prime and q natural,

of the hint given to item (a). Item ii. follows immediately from i., together with
the fact that, modulo pi, we have {a, a2, . . . , api−1} = {1, 2, . . . , pi −1}. Fpr
iii., if n | sn, then sn ≡0 (mod pi). However, since pi | (api(n−1) −an−1), the
formula in ii. guarantees that the only way of having sn ≡0 (mod pi) is to have
pi | (an−1−1). Then, pi −1 = ordpi(a) | (n−1) and, hence, (pi −1) | (qi −1)
(since n −1 = (pi −1)qi + (qi −1)). For item iv., if n | sn, then pi | sn, and
it follows from i. and iii. (more precisely from (pi −1) | (n −1)) that

Hence, qi(pi −1) ≡−1 ≡pi −1 (mod pi), so that qi ≡1 (mod pi). Finally
in what concerns item v., it is enough to show that if pi(pi −1) | (qi −1)
for 1 ≤i ≤t, then pi | sn for 1 ≤i ≤t; to this end, it sufﬁces to use
the congruence of item i., together with the fact (easily deducible from our
hypotheses) that (pi −1) | (n −1).
10. For item (a), if gcd(ak+1, n) > 1 then n | (ak+1), and hence a2k ≡1 (mod n);
this contradicts the fact that ordn(a) = 2pk. For i., it follows from akp ≡
−1 (mod n) that a2kp ≡1 (mod n), and thus d | 2kp = n−1. On the other hand,
if d | 2k, then a2k ≡1 (mod n) and, this way, n | (ak −1)(ak + 1); however,
since gcd(ak + 1, n) = 1, we get n | (ak −1) and then akp ≡1 (mod n), an
absurd. Now, if d | 2kp and d ∤2k, it is immediate to see that gcd(d, p) > 1,
and hence that p | d; therefore, the last part of i. follows from Euler’s theorem.
For ii., it is pretty clear that p ∤(2kp+1); therefore, the formula for ϕ(2kp+1)
assures that p | (q −1), for some prime divisor q of 2kp + 1; thus, it sufﬁces to
let q −1 = lp, noticing that l > 1, for otherwise both p and q = p + 1 would
be odd primes, which is impossible. Finally, for iii., if 2kp + 1 = (lp + 1)u
then u ≡1 (mod p), so that u = hp + 1 for some h ≥1. If h ≥2, then
n = (lp + 1)(hp + 1) ≥(2p + 1)2 > 2(2p + 1)p + 1 ≥2kp + 1 = n, which
is impossible. Therefore, h = 0 or 1, and if h = 1 then (p + 1) | (2kp + 1), an
absurd (for p + 1 is even and 2kp + 1 is odd.
11. Show2 ﬁrst (by induction) that for every k ∈N there exists a natural number
mk of k digits, all of which equal to 1 or 2, such that 2k | mk. Now, note that
5 ∤q1000, and use the fact that 2 is a primitive root modulo 51000 to ﬁnd k ∈N
with 2k ≡q1000 (mod 51000). Finally, writing 2k = a · 51000 + q1000, for some
a ∈N, show that 2k+1000 has the desired properties.

4. First show that if such x and y did exist, then they would be relatively

that 17 should be a quadratic residue modulo 61. Finally, apply the quadratic
reciprocity law and Proposition 12.23 to reach a contradiction.
5. For item (a), if every prime divisor of 2b2 + 3 was congruent to ±1 modulo 8,
we would have 2b2 + 3 ≡±1 (mod 8); show that this is impossible. For (b), if
(2b2 + 3) | (a2 −2) and p is as in (a), then a2 ≡2 (mod p), so that 2 would
be a quadratic residue modulo p; use the result of Example 12.27 to reach a
contradiction.
6. Let Ln = 2x2. If n is odd, use item (b) of Problem 11, page 252, together
with the fact that Ln is even, to show that n ≡3 or 9 (mod 12). Then, apply
several times item (e) of this same problem to get Ln ≡L3 or L9 ≡4 (mod 8),
and show that this gives x2 ≡2 (mod 4), which is impossible. Now, assuming
that n is even, consider the following three separate cases: n ≡0 (mod 4),
n ≡6 (mod 8) or n ≡2 (mod 8). If n ≡0 (mod 4), write n = 2·3l·k, with k ∈Z
such that 2 | k, 3 ∤k. Argue as in the proof of Example 12.25 to obtain Ln ≡
−L0 = −2 (mod Lk) and, hence, x2 ≡−1 (mod Lk). Show that this furnishes
a contradiction, exactly as the one obtained in the proof of Example 12.25. If
n ≡6 (mod 8) but n = 6 (note that L6 = 18 = 2 · 32), write n = 6 + 2 · 3l · k,
with k ∈Z such that 4 | k and 3 ∤k. Use item (d) of Problem 13, page 253, to
obtain Ln ≡−L6 = −18 (mod Lk), and hence x2 ≡−9 (mod Lk). Also as in
the proof of Example 12.25, conclude that one can take a prime divisor p of Lk
such that p ≡3 (mod 4), so that x2 ≡−9 (mod p). Then, show that 3 ∤Lk, so

7. Let Fn = x2. If n ≡1 (mod 4) but n ̸= 1, write n = 1 + 2 · 3l · k, with
k ∈Z such that 2 | k, 3 ∤k. Use item (c) of Problem 13, page 253, to
get Fn ≡−F1 = −1 (mod Lk); then, arrive at a contradiction, exactly as in
the proof of Example 12.25. If n ≡3 (mod 4), use the fact that F−n = Fn
and −n ≡1 (mod 4). If n is even, write n = 2m and apply item (a) of
Problem 13, page 253 to get Fn = FmLm. Then, distinguish two distinct
subcases: if gcd(n, 3) = 1, use Problem 12, page 252 to conclude that Lm is
also a perfect square; then, apply the result of Example 12.25. If gcd(n, 3) = 3,
use Problem 12, page 252, again to conclude that Lm is twice a perfect square;
then, apply the result of the previous problem.

(2n −1) ∤(3m −1) and p is as in (a), then 3m ≡1 (mod p) or, which is the
same, 3m+1 ≡3 (mod p); since m + 1 is even, it would follow that 3 would be

k ≡a (mod 2k), then

induction; more precisely, if x2
k = pkq + a, let xk+1 = xk + pkt, with t ∈Z,
and impose the validity of the congruence x2
k+1 ≡a (mod pk+1) to deduce that
t must satisfy the linear congruence 2xkt ≡−q (mod p); ﬁnally, show that it is
always possible to choose such a t.
12. If x2 ≡a (mod n) for some integer x, then x2 ≡a (mod 2k) and x2 ≡

previous problem, together with Euler’s criterion. Conversely, if conditions (i)
and (ii) are satisﬁed, apply once more the results of the previous problem and
Euler’s criterion to assure the existence of integers x0, x1, . . . , xt such that
x2
0 ≡a (mod 2k) and x2

Finally, use the results of Problem 12 to show that n must be a power of 2.

2. By contradiction, suppose that a+b is even. Then, a+c2 = a2−b2 ≡0 (mod 4),

odd exponent.
3. Observe that 1995 = 3 · 5 · 7 · 19, with 3, 7, 19 ≡3 (mod 4). On the other

totally analogous way), analyse separately the following four possibilities: d = 1,
d = 5, 1 < d | (3 · 7 · 19) and d = 5d′, with 1 < d′ < 3 · 7 · 19. For instance: (i)
if d = 5, then x2 + y2 = 5(x −y) if and only if (2x −5)2 + (2y + 5)2 = 50, so
that 2x −5 = ±1, ±7; (ii) if 1 < d | (3·7·19), then, since x2 +y2 ≡0 (mod d),
the argument sketched in item (ii) of the proof of Theorem 12.33 guarantees that
d | x and d | y; setting x = da and y = db, we obtain a2 + b2 = a −b, which
is equivalent to the ﬁrst of the four possibilities above.
4. Example 6.40 guarantees the existence of inﬁnitely many primes of the form 4k+

4 ≡mp (mod p). Finally, for (d),
start by using a descent argument to show that p can be written as a sum of four
squares; then, apply several times identity (12.10) to show that any n ∈N can be
written as a sum of four squares.
6. For item (a), assume that n has an odd divisor d > 1. Then, since (2d −1) |
(2n −1), we have that (2d −1) | (m2 +9), which is a sum of two perfect squares.
However, since 2d −1 is of the form 4k −1, he must have some prime divisor p
which is also of this form. It now follows from a slight modiﬁcation of the proof
of Theorem 12.31 that p | m and p | 3, and hence p = 3. Therefore, 3 | (2d −1),
which is an absurd, for 2d −1 ≡(−1)d −1 ≡−2 (mod 3) (recall that d is odd).
For item (b), start by observing that the case k = 1 is trivial. Now, assume that
(22k−1 −1) | (m2
k−1 + 9) and notice that (22k−1 + 1) | ((3 · 22k−2)2 + 9). Then,
with the aid of the chinese remainder theorem, choose mk ∈N such that
mk ≡mk−1 (mod 22k−1 −1) and mk ≡3 · 22k−2 (mod 22k−1 + 1).
It is immediate to verify that 22k−1 −1 and 22k−1 +1 divide m2
k +9; however, since
such numbers are relatively prime, we conclude that their product also divides
m2
k + 9.

theorem. For item (b), let q be a natural number such that q > mn. According
to item (a) of Problem 20, page 179, q can be written as q = mx + ny, with
x, y ∈N. Therefore, if p, q ∈N are such that q > mn, then we can assemble a
p × q rectangle by forming p rows 1 × q, with each row composed by x pieces
1 × m and y pieces 1 × n (x and y as above). However, if m, n ∤p, q, then
Klarner’s theorem assures that one cannot assemble a p × q rectangle by using
only pieces 1 × m or only pieces 1 × n.

x = y = ω to get ωk+l = 1 and, hence k + l ≡0 (mod 3). Substitute x = ω2,
y = ω to get ω2k+l = 1 and, hence 2k + l ≡0 (mod 3). Finally, conclude that
k, l ≡0 (mod 3), and show that any one of the choices (k, l) = (3, 3), (3, 6),
(6, 3) or (6, 6) do correspond to actual possible positions of the 1 × 1 square

4. For the ﬁrst part, write f (z) = anzn + · · · + a1z + a0, with a0, a1, . . . , an ∈R
and use items (b) and (c) of Lemma 13.2 to conjugate both sides of the equality
f (z) = 0. For the second, make induction on the degree of f ; for the induction
step, note that, for z ∈C\R, one has (X −z)(X −z) = X2 −2Re(z)X +|z|2 ∈

Then, compute a by evaluating both sides at −1.
12. As in Example 15.26, substitute X by 1 in the factorised form of Xn−1+Xn−2+

x ∈Z to be found. Then, use Taylor’s formula (15.9), together with the result
of the previous problem, to show that
f (mk+1) ≡f (mk) + f ′(mk)xpk (mod pk+1).
Subsequently, show that it is possible to choose x so that f (mk+1)

12. Start by showing that one can assume that the center of the square is the origin

equation for the graph, i.e., y = f (x), to obtain au2 + c = 0, v = u3 + bu and
av2+c = 0, u = −v3−bv. Conclude that a(u−v)(u+v) = 0 and, hence, that
either a = c = 0 or u = ±v and au2 + c = 0. Discard the possibility u = ±v
and successively obtain a = c = 0 and u2(u2 + b)3 + b(u2 + b) + 1 = 0.
Conclude that the polynomial X2(X2 + b)3 + b(X2 + b) + 1 = 0 has only two
real roots, so that X(X +b)3 +b(X +b)+1 = 0 has only one real root α = u2
(apart from multiplicities). Thus, show that such a root must be a multiple one,
and therefore that (X +b)3 +3X(X +b)2 +b = 0. Letting A = α +b, perform
some simple algebraic manipulations to arrive at (16 −2b2)bA = 2b2 −16, so
that b2 = 8 or bA = −1. Discard the possibility bA = −1 and conclude that,
if b2 = 8, then (bA)2 −4(bA) −8 = 0. Finally, if ℓstands for the length of the

2. For item (a), adapt the argument of the solution of Example 16.3. For item (b),
start by writing
(X −Y)5 + (Y −Z)5 + (Z −X)5 = (X −Y)(Y −Z)(Z −X)f (X, Y, Z),
with f of degree 2. Then, use the equality −y5 + (y −z)5 + z5 = −yz(y −
z)f (0, y, z) to show that f (0, Y, Z) = 5(Y 2 −YZ + Z2) and, analogously, that
f (X, 0, Z) = 5(X2 −XZ + Z2) and f (X, Y, 0) = 5(X2 −XY + Y 2). Finally,
show that
f (X, Y, Z) = 5(X2 + Y 2 + Z2 −XY −XZ −YZ).
3. Letting f = f (X, Y, Z) stand for the given polynomial, adapt the reasoning used
in the solution of Example 16.3 to obtain
f (X, Y, Z) = (X + Y)(X + Z)(Y + Z)g(X, Y, Z),
with g ∈R[X, Y, Z] of degree 2. Now, use the equality f (0, y, z) = yzg(0, y, z)
to show that g(0, Y, Z) = Y 2+YZ+Z2 and, likewise, g(X, 0, Z) = X2+XZ+
Z2 and g(X, Y, 0) = X2 + XY + Y 2. Finally, obtain
g(X, Y, Z) = X2 + Y 2 + Z2 + XY + XZ + YZ.

6. Letting a2 + b2 + c2 = k, we have a3 + 3a2 = 3k −25, so that a is a root

polynomial. Now, factorise f and use Girard-Viète relations to conclude that
a + b + c = −3 and ab + ac + bc = 0, and hence that a2 + b2 + c2 = 9.

3) in terms of a, b and c. To
this end, use Girard-Viète relations, together with the result of Example 16.3.
For instance, letting g(X) = X3 + aX2 + bX + c, we have g(X) = (X −
z1)(X −z2)(X −z3) and, hence,
z3
1 + z3
2 + z3

= −a3 −3g(−a) = −a3 + 3ab −3c.
8. First of all, show that if a, b and c are such roots, then the hypothesis of a, b and
c being positive assures that a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle if
and only if (a+b−c)(a+c−b)(b+c−a) > 0. Then, substitute a+b+c = −p
at the left hand side, expand it and use the fact that ab + ac + bc = q and
abc = −r.
9. If f (X) = (X −a)(X −b)(X −c), then f (X) = X3 −p, with p = abc ̸= 0.

theorem, together with the fact that f (x) > 0 for sufﬁciently large x (cf.
estimates analogous to those preceding (15.5)) to show that f (x) > 0 for
x > n0. Then, use Corollary 17.7 to show that f (u) > f (v) for u > v > n0.
6. Assume, without loss of generality, that f has positive leading coefﬁcient.
According to the previous problem, take n0 ∈N such that u > v > n0 ⇒
f (u) > f (v) > 0. Let m > n0 be an integer for which f (m) = p, a prime
number. If f (X) = anXn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0, then
f (m + p2) = an(p2 + m)n + · · · + a1(p2 + m) + a0
= p2l + (akmk + · · · + a1m + a0)

Now, check that the choice of m gives f (m + p2) > f (m), and conclude that
f (m + p2) is composite.
7. Firstly, show that the given condition is equivalent to x11 −x = y11 −y. Then,
prove that, for any c ∈R the polynomial f (x) = X11 −X −c has at most

8. Since λ ̸= 0, show that f (λ) = 1, where f (X) = (X −a1)(X −a2)(X −

λ ≥a1. Finally, note that if a1 ≤λ ≤a2, then f (λ) ≤0.
9. Let f (X) = aX4 + bX3 + cX2 + dX + e, and take t > 1 such that t2 is a real

11. Start by showing that f has three distinct real roots α < β < γ , with −2 <
α < −1,0 < β < 1 and 1 < γ < 2. Then, note that f (f (x)) = 0 if and only
if f (x) = α, β or γ . Finally, ﬁnd out the numbers of distinct real roots of each
one of the polynomials f (X) −α, f (X) −β and f (X) −γ .
12. Set g(x) = f (x) + f ′(x) + f ′′(x) + · · · + f (n)(x) and assume, by the sake
of contradiction, that g attains negative values. Then, f ̸= 0 and the condition
f (x) ≥0 for x ∈R assures that n is even and f has positive leading coefﬁcient.
Hence, lim|x|→+∞f (x) = +∞, and Weierstrass’ theorem (Teorema 8.26 of
[8]) guarantees the existence of x0 ∈R such that g attains its minimum value
at x0, with g(x0) < 0. It follows from Problem 3 that g′(x0) = 0. However,
since g′(x0) = f ′(x0) + f ′′(x0) + · · · + f (n)(x0), we have 0 > g(x0) =
f (x0) + g′(x0) = f (x0) ≥0, which is a contradiction.
13. Firstly, show that B can play in such a way that, when exactly three coefﬁcients

distinct integers such that ak and al are still left to be chosen and l odd. Since
f (2) = g(2) + 2kak + 2lal and f (−1) = g(−1) + (−1)kak −al, we shall have
f (2) + 2lf (−1) = g(2) + 2lg(−1) + (2k + (−1)k2l)ak, so that B can play by
choosing ak = −g(2)+2lg(−1)
2k+(−1)k2l . Finally, conclude that Bolzano’s theorem assures
the existence of at least one real root for f , no matter how A plays next.
14. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the leading coefﬁcient of the
polynomial f originally written in the blackboard is positive. Let α be the
smallest and β be the greatest real root of f (possibly with α = β). If α < β,

1. Firstly, use the deﬁnition of the derivative of a polynomial to show that if g, h ∈
R[X] are such that g′ = h′, then there exists c ∈R for which f = g + c. Now,
letting f ′(X) = a(X+b)n−1, show that f (X) = a

Finally, use the hypothesis on f to conclude that f (X) = (X + α)n, for some

2. For the sake of contradiction, assume that the given polynomial has only real

3. If f (X) = aX3 +bX2 +cX+d, we want to compute the number of real roots of

α < β < γ are the roots of f , show that changing g(X) by h(X) = g(X+β), we
can assume (also without loss of generality) that β = 0 and, hence, that c < 0
and d = 0. Under such simpliﬁcations, an immediate computation furnishes
g(X) = 3X4 + 4bX3 + 6cX2 −c2. It now sufﬁces to apply Descartes’ rule to

Gauss’ lemma and examine the possibility X4−X2 +1 = (X2+aX+b)(X2 +

2. Gauss’ lemma assures that it sufﬁces to show that f cannot be written as the
product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. To this end,
ﬁrst note that f has no integer roots; hence, if it can be written as the product
of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients, we must have
f (X) = (X2 + aX + b)(X3 + cX2 + dX + e),
for some a, b, c, d, e ∈Z. Expanding the products at the right hand side
and comparing coefﬁcients, conclude that be = 2, so that (b, e) = (1, 2),
(−1, −2), (2, 1) or (−2, −1). Then, check that each of these possibilities leads

3. Write f (Xn) = g(X)h(X), with g, h ∈R[X] \ R as in the statement of the

and h(X) = clXl + cl+1Xl+1 + · · · , with bk, cl ̸= 0, and changing g and h
respectively by g(X) = bk +bk+1X +· · · and h(X) = clXk+l +cl+1Xk+l+1 +
· · · , we can suppose that g(0), h(0) ̸= 0. Therefore, from the beginning let
g(X) = b0 + b1X + · · · and h(X) = clXl + cl+1Xl+1 + · · · , with b0, cl ̸= 0.
Use the fact that f (Xn) = g(X)h(X) to show that n | l. Then, cancel the terms
of minimal degree at both sides of the equality f (Xn) = g(X)h(X) and argue
by induction on ∂f to show that g(X) = g1(Xn) and h(X) = h1(Xn), for some
g1, h1 ∈R[X] \ R as prescribed in the statement of the problem
4. Once more from Gauss’ lemma, we examine when it does happen that f =
gh, with g, h ∈Z monic and nonconstant. Adapting the idea of the proof of
Example 19.32, we have 1 = f (0) = g(0)h(0), so that g(0) = h(0) = ±1;

hence, a1, a2, . . . , an are pairwise distinct roots of g −h. If g −h ̸= 0, then
∂(g −h) ≤max{∂g, ∂h} < ∂f = n, so that g −h must have less than n distinct
roots. Therefore, g −h = 0, and hence f = g2, or
g(X)2 −1 = (X −a1) . . . (X −an).
In particular, n = 2k for some k ∈N, and the unique factorisation in Z[X]
gives, without loss of generality,
g(X) −1 = (X −a1) . . . (X −ak) and g(X) + 1 = (X −ak+1) . . . (X −a2k),
with a1 < a2 < · · · < ak and ak+1 < ak+2 < · · · < a2k. Therefore,
2 = (X −ak+1) . . . (X −a2k) −(X −a1) . . . (X −ak)
and, by evaluating the equality above at a1, a2, . . . , ak, respectively, we obtain
(ai −ak+1) . . . (ai −a2k) = 2
for 1 ≤i ≤k. From this point, conclude that if k ≥3 then at least two of
the numbers ak+1, ak+2, . . . , a2k would be equal, which is not the case. Finally,
look separately at the cases k = 1 and k = 2 to get the listed polynomials.

with m = pk−1(p −1) and a1, a2, . . . , am−1 ∈Z being multiples of p. Finally,
apply Eisenstein’s criterion.

f = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X] \ Z, say g(X) = b0 + b1X + · · · + brXr and
h(X) = c0 + c1X + · · · + csXs, with r, s ≥1 and br, cs ̸= 0. By renumbering
the zj’s, if necessary, we can assume that the roots of g are z1, . . . , zr. Then,
Girard-Viète relations give
|b0| = |br||z1| . . . |zr| > |br| and |c0| = |cs||zr+1| . . . |zn| > |cs|.
Hence, |b0| ≥|br| + 1 and |c0| ≤|cs| + 1, so that
|a0| = |b0||c0| ≥(|br| + 1)(|cs| + 1)
= |br||cs| + |br| + |cs| + 1
≥|br||cs| + 2

|an| + 1)2.
This way, √|a0| ≥√|an| + 1, which is an absurd.
11. For item (a), use an argument analogous to that of the proof of Lemma 17.1.
For item (b), suppose that f = gh, with g, h ∈Z[X] \ Z. Then, it follows from
(a) that all of the coefﬁcients of g1(X) = g

X + m −1

have a single sign.
Hence, g2(X) := g1(−X) has nonzero coefﬁcients of alternating signs, so that
|g2(x)| < |g1(x)| for every x > 0 and, thus,
g

−x + m −1

for every x > 0; in particular, |g(m −1)| < |g(m)|. Conclude that |g(m)| ≥2
and, analogously, |h(m)| ≥2. Finally, use the fact that f (m) is prime to reach
a contradiction.

2. The ﬁrst de Moivre’s formula gives (cos 2kπ

ﬁnd nonzero polynomials with rational coefﬁcients having cos 2kπ

use the result of Example 15.27, together
with cos 2kπ

3. Apply Eisenstein’s criterion (cf. Corollary 19.27).
4. First use Gauss’ Theorem 19.14 to show that there exists g ∈Z[X] \ Z,
irreducible over Z and such that g(α) = 0. The, use Gauss’ Lemma 19.13
to conclude that g is also irreducible over Q, so that g = pα.
5. For item (a), apply Remark 20.10 several times, together with the fact that
p√aj (X) = X −√aj or X2 −aj, according to whether √aj ∈N or √aj /∈N.
For (b), use (a) and the rational roots test (cf. Proposition 15.16).
6. Problem 2, page 475, shows that f is irreducible over Q. Now, suppose that
there exist relatively prime integers a and b and a natural number n > 1 such
that f (α) = 0, with α =
n;
| a
b|. Let
g(X) = bXn −a = b(X −α)(X −αω) . . . (X −αωn−1),
with ω = cis 2π
n . Corollary 20.4 shows that f = pα; hence, item (b) of
Proposition 20.3 guarantees that f divides g in Q[X] and, hence, in Z[X] (for
f ∈Z[X] is monic). Thus, it follows from Problem 4, page 386, the existence
of integers 1 ≤k < l ≤n −1 such that
f (X) = (X −α)(X −αωk)(X −αωk)(X −αωl)(X −αωl).
By examining the independent term of f , conclude that −α5 = 2 and, then,
α = −

8. Item (a) is almost immediate. For multiplication, start by taking f, g ∈Q[X] \
{0} and writing f q = pαq + r, with r = 0 or ∂r < ∂pα = n; then, show that
f (α)g(α) = r(α), so that f (α)g(α) ∈Q(α). For (b), let β = f (α) = g(α),
with f, g ∈Q[X] such that f = 0 or ∂f ≤n −1 and likewise for g; note that
(f −g)(α) = 0, and successively conclude that pα | (f −g) and f −g = 0.
Finally, for (c), show that gcd(f, pα) = 1 follows from the irreducibility of
pα. Therefore, Corollary 19.4 gives fg + pαq = 1, for some g, q ∈Q[X]
satisfying g = 0 or ∂g < ∂pα = n and q = 0 or ∂q < ∂f . Then, evaluate this
equality at α to show that 1
β ∈Q(α).

4; a, b, c ∈Q}. The second part can be solved following the steps in the
hint given to Problem 8, page 200. Alternatively, follow the steps listed in the
hint given to item (c) of the previous problem; more precisely, letting f (X) =
1 + X + 2X2 (so that 1 +
3√

g, q ∈Q[X] such that fg + p 3√

3√
2)g(
3√
2) = 1.
10. Start by showing that φ(0) = 0 for any such φ. Then, use (ii) to show that
φ(1) = 0 or φ(1) = 1. If φ(1) = 0, conclude that φ ≡0; if φ(1) = 1, show
successively that φ(m) = m for every m ∈Z and φ(r) = r for every r ∈Q.
Now, letting pα(X) = Xn + an−1Xn−1 + · · · + a1X + a0, note that
0 = φ(0) = φ(pα(α)) = φ(α)n + an−1φ(α)n−1 + · · · + a1φ(α) + a0,
so that β = φ(α) is also a root of pα. In turn, show that, for any f ∈Q[X]\{0}
satisfying ∂f ≤n −1, we have φ(f (α)) = f (φ(α)) = f (β), so that φ is
completely determined by the fact that φ(α) = β. Conversely, for any such
root β of pα, let φ : Q(α) →be given by φ(f (α)) = f (β), for any f ∈Q[X]
satisfying f ≡0 or ∂f ≤n −1. It is straightforward to show that (i) holds. For
(ii), let f, g ∈Q[X] \ {0} be given and write fg = pαq + r, with q, r ∈Q[X]
such that r ≡0 or ∂r ≤n −1. Then, show that
φ(f (α)g(α)) = φ((fg)(α)) = φ(r(α)) = r(β)
= f (β)g(β) = φ(f (α))φ(g(α)).

2. A typical root of 2n is ω = cis 2kπ
2n , for some integer 1 ≤k ≤2n such that
gcd(k, 2n) = 1. Now, use the fact that −ω is also of this form to conclude that
−ω is a root of 2n too. Then, show that 2n is a product of factors of the form
(X −ω)(X + ω).

3. If m and n have a nonconstant common factor in C[X], then, being the
minimal polynomials of any of its common roots, they are identical. Then, letting
m = n = f , item (a) of Proposition 20.14 shows that f 2 divides Xmn −1,
which is impossible.
4. Firstly, with n and d as in the statement, note that ϕ(n) = ϕ(d) · n
d , so that
∂n = ∂f , where f (X) = d(Xn/d). Now, if ω = cis 2kπ
n , with 1 ≤k ≤d and
gcd(k, d) = 1, and η ∈C is an n
d -th root of ω, show that η is an n-th primitive
root of unity. Finally, conclude that n and f have the same roots.
5. Dirichlet’s theorem allows us to choose d ∈N tal such that 1 + kd = p, a prime
number. Now, look at the arithmetic progression
1
(p−1)!,
1+d
(p−1)!, . . . , 1+(k−1)d
(p−1)! .
6. The general version of Dirichlet’s theorem assures that the arithmetic progression
(n + 2, 2n + 2, 3n + 2, . . .) contains inﬁnitely many primes. Letting p = kn +
2 > a be one such prime and g be a primitive root modulo p, the fact that
{g, g2, . . . , gp−1} is a RRS modulo p assures the existence of an integer 1 ≤
t ≤p −1 such that gt ≡a (mod p). Now, apply Bézout’s theorem to guarantee
the existence of natural numbers u and v such that nu = t + (p −1)v, so that
(gu)n ≡a (mod p).
7. Firstly, consider the case of an odd a. Since a is not a perfect square, there
exist natural numbers b and t, and distinct odd primes q1, . . . , qt such that
a = b2q1 . . . qt. Then, Proposition 12.23 guarantees that it sufﬁces to ﬁnd
inﬁnitely many prime numbers p for which

Then, use the result of the previous problem to reach a contradiction.

α−1 ∈Rn. Then, show that Rn is a ﬁeld.
3. For the ﬁrst part, use (20.10). For the second, use (20.9), together with the fact
that f11(X) . . . f1a1(X) = Xp −X and

f = f1f2 . . . fk + 1, choose an irreducible factor g ∈K[X] of f and show that
g ̸= f1, f2, . . . , fk.
Section 20.4

2. For the sake of contradiction, if α + β = r, with r ∈Q, and f (α) = 0 for
f (X) = anXn + · · · + a1X + a0 ∈Q[X] \ {0}, then
an(r −β)n + · · · + a1(r −β) + a0 = 0.
Use this equality to show that β would be algebraic.

4. For the second part, if Q[α] was a subﬁeld of C there would exist n ∈N and
a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Q such that an ̸= 0 and 1
α = a0 + a1α + · · · + anαn. Show that
this would force α to be algebraic.
5. Let α ∈R and, for 1 ≤k ≤2016, let Ak be the point of the cartesian plane
whose coordinates are the real and imaginary parts of (α + iα2)ωk−1, with ω =
cos 2π
2016 + i sin 2π
2016. Then A1A2 . . . A2016 is a regular 2016-gon, and it sufﬁces
to show that it is possible to choose α in such a way that Ak /∈S for every k.
Let  be one of the circles in S, with center O = (a, b) and radius r, so that
a, b, r ∈Q. Letting cos 2(k−1)π
2016

(α + α2i)(c + si) = (cα −sα2) + (sα + cα2)i.

In turn, this last equality is equivalent to
α4 + (1 −2bc + 2as)α2 + (2ac −2bs)α + (a2 + b2 −r) = 0.
However, since c and s are algebraic over Q (cf. Problem 2, page 486), we
conclude from the above remark that α should be algebraic over Q. Therefore,
by choosing α ∈R to be transcendental, we conclude that Ak /∈S for every k.
Section 21.1
1. For every integer k ≥0, set f (k)(x) = ake−x sin x + bke−x cos x, so that
f (k+1)(x) = −(ak + bk)e−x sin x + (ak −bk)e−x cos x
and, hence, ak+1 = −(ak + bk), bk+1 = ak −bk. Then, conclude that bk+2 +
2bk+1 + 2bk = 0 for k ≥0.
2. The characteristic polynomial of the involved recurrence relations is f (X) =
kXk −Xk−1 −· · · −X −1. If α ∈C is a root of f such that |α| ̸= 1, we have
k|α|k = |αk−1 + · · · + α + 1|
≤|α|k−1 + · · · + |α| + 1

|α| −1 ,
so that k|α|k+1 −(k + 1)|α|k + 1 ≤0. Study the ﬁrst variation of g(X) =
(X −1)f (X) = kXk+1 −(k + 1)Xk + 1 to conclude that |α| < 1. If α ∈C is a
root of f such that |α| = 1, review the above estimates to obtain
k = k|α|k = |αk−1 + · · · + α + 1|
≤|α|k−1 + · · · + |α| + 1 = k
and, hence, to conclude (from the condition for equality in the triangle inequality
for complex numbers, cf. Problem 3, page 326) that αj = λj ·1, for some λj > 0.
Up to this point, we have shown that, apart from 1, all of the other complex

If an = an + bn + cn for n ≥1, show that a1, a2, a3 ∈Z and ak+3 = 3ak+2 −ak

use the linear recurrence relation satisﬁed by the sequence (an)n≥1 to show that
ak+17 ≡ak (mod 17); alternatively, invoke the result of Problem 9, page 469.

2. An easy inspection shows that the characteristic polynomial of (an)n≥1 is (X −
1)(X −2)2. Thus, Theorem 21.22 gives an = A+(B +C(n−1))2n−1, for some
real constants A, B and C. Since an
2n = 1
2(B + C(n −1)), we must have C = 0
and B
2 = 3. Finally, a1 = 1 gives A + B = 1.
