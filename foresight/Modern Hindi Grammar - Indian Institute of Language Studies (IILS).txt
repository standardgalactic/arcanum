Preface 
 
Modern Hindi Grammar aims at providing basic information on 
various aspects of Hindi phonology, morphology, and syntax along 
with their unique features or characteristics. 
 
Hindi has a special status in India. It is spoken by the largest 
population in India. It is the official language of the Union of India 
and eleven state governments, including Delhi. It is taught as a 
second language in all the non-Hindi speaking states under the three-
language formula. Under this formula, a child is supposed to learn 
his mother tongue, Hindi, and English. If a child’s mother tongue is 
Hindi, (s)he is expected to learn an additional modern Indian 
language or a foreign language. Hindi is taught as a foreign language 
in a large number of countries throughout the world. Besides need-
based language learning materials, there is a need for a 
pedagogically oriented grammar of this language. The present 
grammar aims to fulfill the need of second/foreign language learners 
of Hindi in India as well as other countries. A large number of Hindi 
speakers have settled in non-Hindi speaking states in India, or have 
migrated and settled abroad. The second generation of these 
migrants is fast losing contact with their mother tongue in the 
absence of its use in various domains of their day-to-day life in alien 
surroundings. They are looking for suitable language learning 
materials 
including 
pedagogically 
oriented 
grammars 
for 
maintaining the language among their children. 
 
Hindi has a long tradition of grammars and grammatical literature. 
The existing grammars mentioned in the introduction as well as in 
references are either too old and do not describe modern spoken and 
written Hindi, or they are sketchy or too scholarly or detailed. They 
do not fulfill the needs of second and/or foreign language learners or 
those native speakers who want to maintain the language in an alien 
atmosphere. 
 
This grammar is pedagogically oriented. It will be of special interest 
to Hindi language learners and teachers in different situations. It will 
also be of interest to linguists and researchers working in the area of 
language typology, and to general readers as well.

In Modern Hindi Grammar we have utilized simple terminology and 
provided suitable descriptions with tables for grammatical 
categories, phrases, and sentence types. The introduction gives a 
survey of the Hindi speaking area and the number of its speakers, its 
classification and  dialects, Hindi-Urdu relationship, the status of 
Hindi and its use in administration, education and mass media, Hindi 
grammars, and the objectives of the present grammar. The 
phonology section describes segmental phonemes, suprasegmentals, 
and morphophonology. The morphology provides a description of 
different word classes: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, 
adverbs, particles, connectives, and interjections. It deals with 
inflectional as well as derivational morphology. The syntax 
describes the structure of phrases, sentence types, complex and 
compound constructions, special word order variations, and other 
intricate syntactic features. The lexicon presents a list of useful 
classified vocabulary which is useful for students and teachers of 
Hindi as well as general readers. This grammar emphasizes special 
features of Hindi that set it apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. 
In short, it will fulfill the needs of the basic language learner as well 
as provide useful information for the linguist and the general reader. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Thomas Creamer, 
Director, Language Research Center (a division of McNeil 
Technologies) for asking me to write this grammar and for deciding 
to publish it. I would like to thank Prof. Anjani Kumar Sinha, and 
Prof. Kashi Wali for going through the first draft of it and for 
offering useful comments and suggestions. Finally, I would like to 
thank my colleagues at the Indian Institute of Language Studies for 
providing their assistance. 
 
I hope students, researchers, teachers, and linguists will find this 
book useful.

1. INTRODUCTION

1. Introduction 
 
1.1. Area and Its Speakers 
 
Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language (a branch of the-Indo-European 
family of languages), spoken primarily in the states of Bihar, 
Chattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya 
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh in India. 
Besides being the official language of these states it is also the 
official language of government of India along with English. 
According to the 2001census, it is spoken by 422,048,642 speakers 
which include the speakers of its various dialects and variations of 
speech grouped under Hindi. It is also spoken by a large number of 
people of Indian origin settled abroad. 
 
1.2. Dialects and Classification 
 
Hindi and Urdu languages have their origins in Khariboli spoken in 
areas around Delhi. Khariboli was adopted by the Afghans, Persians, 
and Turks as a common language of interaction with the local 
population during the period of Islamic invasions and the 
establishment of Muslim rule in the north of India between the 
eighth and tenth centuries AD. In time, it developed a variety called 
Urdu with significant borrowings from Arabic and Persian and that 
uses a Persian script. It was also known as rexta “mixed language.” 
As Urdu gained patronage in the Muslim courts and developed into 
a literature language, the variety used by the general population 
gradually replaced Sanskrit, literary Prakrits, and Apabhramsas as 
the literary language. This latter variety looked to Sanskrit for 
linguistic borrowings and Sanskrit, Prakrits, and Apabhramsas for 
literary conventions. It is this variety that became known as Hindi. 
 
Hindi and Urdu have a common form known as Hindustani which is 
essentially a Hindi-Urdu mixed language. This was the variety that 
was adopted by Indian leaders as a symbol of national identity 
during the struggle for freedom. Hindi has been used as a literary 
language since the twelfth century. The development of prose, 
however, began only in the eighteenth century, which marks the 
emergence of Hindi as a full-fledged literary language. 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 
2 
 
Grierson (1906) has divided Hindi into two groups: Eastern Hindi 
and Western Hindi. Between the Eastern and the Western Prakrits 
there was an intermediate Prakrit called Ardhamagadhi. The modern 
representative of the corresponding Apabhamsa is Eastern Hindi and 
the Shaurasena Apabhramsa of the middle Doab is the parent of 
Western Hindi. In the Eastern group Grierson discusses three 
dialects: Awadhi, Bagheli, and Chattisgarhi. In the Western group he 
discusses five dialects: Hindustani, Braj Bhasha, Kanauji, Bundeli, 
and Bhojpuri. Eastern Hindi is bounded on the north by the language 
of the Nepal Himalaya and on the west by various dialects of 
Western Hindi, of which the principal are Kanauji and Bundeli. On 
the east, it is bounded by the Bhojpuri dialect of Bihari and by 
Oriya. On the South it meets forms of the Marathi language. 
Western Hindi extends to the foot of the Himalayas on the north, 
south to the Jamna valley, and occupies most of Bundelkhand and a 
part of central provinces on the east side. 
 
The Hindi region is traditionally divided into two: Eastern Hindi and 
Western Hindi. The main dialects of Eastern Hindi are Avadhi, 
Bagheli and Chattisgarhi. The Western Hindi dialects are Haryanvi, 
Braj Bhasha, Bhundeli, Kanuji and Khariboli. The dialects spoken in 
the regions of Bihar (i.e., Maithili, Bhojpuri, Maghi etc.) in 
Rajasthan (i.e., Marwari, Jaipuri, Malvi etc.) and some dialects 
spoken in the northwestern areas of Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal 
Pradesh were kept away from the earlier classification. Now, all of 
these dialects are also covered under the term Hindi. The standard 
Hindi developed from the Khariboli has borrowed lexical items from 
Sanskrit and is the vehicle of all official literary and commercial 
communication. It is intelligible throughout the broad Hindi 
language region. Another literary style, Urdu, has also developed 
from Khariboli and it uses the Perso-Arabic script and borrows from 
Perso-Arabic sources. 
 
1.3. Hindi – Urdu 
 
Historical and cultural processes and the linguistic affinity which 
exists in Indian languages led to the emergence of Hindi-Urdu or so-
called Hindustani as the lingua-franca of major areas of India long 
before its freedom. In an earlier period, the languages of 
administration, Sanskrit in the case of the earliest Hindu kingdoms, 
Persian in the case of the Muslim dynasties, and English in the case 
of the British regime, have mostly remained confined to the elite. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
3 
 
 
Beginning with the invasion of Mohammed Ghori in the late 12th 
century AD, the foreign invaders settled down in India to rule. The 
Slave, Tughluq, Lodi, and Mughal dynasties used Persian in their 
administration, but they used the local language spoken in and 
around Delhi for communicating with the people for their day-to-
day needs. This local language was a form of Apbhramsha, which 
eventually became Khariboli; they called this language Hindi - a 
language belonging to Hind. Thus, the Hindi language derived its 
name from the Persian towards the end of the 12th century or 
beginning of the 13th century. During the Mughal period, the word 
“Urdu” was derived from the Turkish word “Yurt” or “ordu” that 
meant “military encampment.” This variety was distinguished on the 
basis of Perso-Arabic influence at the lexical level and was written 
in the Perso-Arabic script. Hindi-Urdu became the medium of 
communication between the Muslim rulers and the local people. The 
southern variety of the speech, best known as Dakhini, also became 
the medium of literature and socio-religious discourse. This variety 
is influenced by Dravidian languages as a result of language contact. 
 
Due to a common structural basis, Hindi and Urdu continued to be 
treated as synonymous for centuries at least up to the period of 
Mirza Ghalib. Mirza Ghalib called his language “Hindi” on several 
occasions, though he used the Perso-Arabic script for writing it. He 
named one of his works “ode-e-Hindi” (perfume of Hindi). 
Primarily in the domain of different genres of literature, Hindi and 
Urdu started drifting away from each other not only in the use of 
two different scripts, but also in literary styles and vocabulary. Hindi 
started drawing more and more from Sanskrit, and Urdu from 
Persian and Arabic. The processes continue today. 
 
During British rule, when English was adopted as the official 
language, local languages were assigned roles for certain functions 
at lower levels of administration. A competition started between the 
proponents or supporters of Hindi and those of Urdu for official 
recognition of their languages. In the first instance, Urdu was 
recognized by the British in the Northwest and Oudh, Bihar, and the 
Central Provinces in 1830 AD as the language of the courts. This 
was followed by the recognition accorded to Hindi in certain areas. 
Hindi and Urdu were involved in controversy and mutual 
competition for their recognition in various domains of education 
and administration. The mutual conflicts intensified at the beginning 

1. INTRODUCTION 
4 
 
of the 20th century. On the one hand, there were proponents of Hindi 
and Urdu who were eager to maintain separate linguistic identities, 
and, on the other hand, some national leaders wanted to develop 
Hindustani as a combined linguist identity on the basis of its use by 
the general population. 
 
1.4. Linguistic Characteristics 
 
Hindi shares major linguistic characteristics with other Indo-Aryan 
languages. It has ten vowels. The length of vowels is phonemic. All  
vowels can be nasalized and nasalization is phonemic. The Hindi 
syllable contains a vowel as its nucleus, followed or preceded by 
consonants. Words usually have two or three syllables. 
 
Nouns are inflected for number, gender and case. There are two 
numbers: singular and plural, two genders: masculine and feminine; 
and two cases: direct and oblique. Nouns are assigned one of the two 
genders. The gender of inanimate objects is not predictable from the 
form or meaning. Pronouns are inflected for number and case. 
Adjectives are of two types: declinable and indeclinable. The first 
type is uninflected for number, gender, and case, whereas the second 
type is not. 
 
Verbs are inflected for person, number, gender, tense, mood, and 
aspect. There are three tenses: present, past, and future; three moods: 
imperative, indicative, and subjective; two aspects: imperfective and 
perfective. Hindi is a verb-final language. 
 
Hindi is written in the Devanagari script which originated from 
Brahmi. The Devanagari script for Hindi is standardized, but certain 
minor variations still exist. In this grammar we are using Devanagari 
and Roman scripts for the data from the language. 
 
1.5. Status 
 
As stated above, Hindi is the official language of the Union of India 
and ten states. It is spoken by the largest number of people in India. 
It is widely used in administration, education, and mass media. 
 
The use of Hindi in administration at the Union level as well as in 
the Hindi speaking states is not free from problems (Koul 1994a). 
There are some serious gaps in the Official Language Policy (OLP), 

1. INTRODUCTION 
5 
 
and the rules and procedures which are being followed in its 
implementation. There are problems related to the development of 
its administrative register. The main problems related to the 
development of the administrative register are: (i) an artificial 
coinage of terminology, (ii) lack of standardization, and (iii) lack of 
coordination between various agencies and duplication of efforts. 
Problems related to its practical use include the lack of proper 
monitoring, lack of encouragement, and absence of strong political 
will. 
 
The implementation of the OLP at the Union level has become the 
victim of political indecision, the attitude of its protagonists, the lack 
of will of the monitoring agencies, and the lack of adherence to the 
rules and regulations set up for it. Even after its continuous use in 
administration for more than sixty years, its development is still 
questioned by critics. There is a need to review the OLP, and the 
rules and procedures of its implemenation to identify its problems 
and resolve them. 
 
The Constitution of India adopted in 1950 provides for the use of 
Hindi in Devanagari script as the official language of the Union. 
Article 343 states: 
 
The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in the Devanagari 
script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purpose of 
the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals. 
 
Article 351 provides a directive for the development of Hindi as 
follows: 
 
It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi 
language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of 
expression for all the composite culture of India and to secure its 
enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the 
forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other 
languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, 
whenever necessary or desirable, its vocabulary primarily from 
Sanskrit and secondarily from other languages. 
 
The Hindi language was supposed to replace English in 1965, fifteen 
years after the adoption of the Constitution of India. The early 
sixties witnessed resentment and agitation, primarily in the southern 

1. INTRODUCTION 
6 
 
states of India, regarding the replacement of English by Hindi. It 
was argued that Hindi was not developed enough to replace English 
in its administrative domain. Thus, the Official Language Act 
(OLA) was passed in 1963 providing for the continuation of English 
as an associate official language in the Union and also for its use in 
parliament for an indefinite period of time. The Act dealt with the 
setting-up of the Committee on Official Language, authorization of 
the Hindi translation of Central and State acts, optional use of Hindi 
in judgments of High courts, etc. The passing of the OLA was 
successful in achieving timely political gains, but it has not been in 
the interest of the development of Hindi and its use as the sole 
official language of the Union in the years to come. 
 
The development of Hindi has become a complex concern for the 
Government of India. The development of Hindi is often linked to 
the development of other regional languages. The Ministry of Home 
Affairs (Government of India) Resolution (1968) made some 
important recommendations in this regard: 
 
1. It is the duty of the Government of India to promote the spread 
of the Hindi language. 
2. The development of Hindi as well as other regional languages 
is in the interest of the educational and cultural advancement of 
the country. 
3. Efforts should be made to implement the Three-Language 
Formula. 
4. Compulsory knowledge of Hindi or English should be essential 
for the public service of the Union. 
5. Languages of the Eighth Schedule should be used as alternative 
media for examinations for all-India and higher Central 
services. 
 
The Resolution adopted by the Ministry of Home Affairs has turned 
out to be merely a political policy statement. It was not followed by 
an action plan for the promotion or the spread of the Hindi language 
in a sustainable manner, although it was rightly realized that the 
development of Hindi and regional languages is necessary for the 
educational and cultural advancement of the country. No clear-cut 
strategies were framed for encouraging their use in education. It did 
not stop the mushrooming of competing English-medium private 
schools. Efforts were made to implement the Three-Language 
Formula, but, in the absence of proper monitoring of its 

1. INTRODUCTION 
7 
 
implementation, the Formula itself was diluted by different states, 
which resulted in its several versions. The Union Public Service 
Commission (UPSC) has made a provision for the use of languages 
of the Eighth Schedule as alternative media for competitive 
examinations, but, in the absence of adequate study materials in 
Hindi and regional languages, English continues to reign supreme as 
the only viable medium of examinations. Hindi is taught to the 
officers and staff of the Central service during their in-service 
training, but there is no urgency for its use as long as English 
continues as an associate official language. The Resolution makes 
important recommendations, but in the absence of an effective 
action plan and a sense of urgency on the part of the agencies 
involved, these recommendations are not implemented properly. 
 
Hindi has a significant role in education. It is used as a subject of 
study as well as a medium of education in India from the primary 
level to the university level in all the Hindi-speaking states in India. 
It is also used as a medium for technical education at the lower 
levels. Various organizations at the Union and state levels are 
engaged in the preparation of textbooks and supplementary 
instructional materials in Hindi. English continues to be a preferred 
medium of instruction for science and technology at the higher 
levels. 
 
Hindi has a prominent role in both electronic and print media. Hindi 
is widely used in programs on radio and television and in films. The 
language style of Hindi used in electronic media is close to the 
spoken variety of so-called Hindustani. In the print media, styles 
vary from high Hindi to that commonly understood by the Hindi-
Urdu speech community. Whereas a few newspapers and periodicals 
prefer high Hindi or the Sanskritized style, others prefer to use the 
Urdu vocabulary. A large number of newspapers, periodicals, and 
journals are published in Hindi. 
 
1.6. Grammars in Hindi 
 
Beginning in the eighteenth century, Hindi has a long tradition of 
grammatical literature which falls under the categories of (a) 
traditional grammars, (b) comparative and historical grammars, and 
(c) modern linguistic grammars. Bhatia (1987) provides a critical 
survey of the Hindi grammatical tradition. Traditional grammars 
describe the language using the traditional framework of Sanskrit 

1. INTRODUCTION 
8 
 
grammars. Comparative and historical grammars are mostly 
concerned with presenting the diachronic description of the 
grammatical features at different linguistic levels, especially 
phonology and morphology. They are useful for historical linguists 
and those interested in the comparative linguistics of Indo-Aryan 
languages. 
 
Modern linguistic grammars in Hindi have been written with various 
objectives. Most of the modern linguistic grammars deal with some 
aspects of syntax at length and tend to apply the western theoretical 
models and raise theoretical issues. They are useful for linguists 
interested in theoretical discussions and are of little use to the 
language learners and teachers of Hindi or to general readers. It is 
important to mention a few grammars here. 
 
Aryendra Sharma (1958) prepared first detailed descriptive grammar 
of modern Hindi in English. It has been revised and printed several 
times. Though written in a traditional format it presents a good 
description of Hindi. Different linguistic aspects of Hindi have been 
described in various dissertations and independent grammatical 
studies lately. I will specially mention three recent works: Mountaut 
(2005), Kachru (2006), and Agnihotri (2007) written with different 
objectives. 
 
Moutaut (2005) provides a functional description of Hindi from a 
typological perspective. She provides a brief phonological outline of 
standard Hindi, its morphological analysis, an analysis of simple 
clauses and complex sentences. The final section provides 
representative features of standard Hindi, its various dialects with 
special reference to other neighboring Indo-Aryan languages. She 
presents review of the earlier works on the subject and uses 
examples from various written texts. It is a first linguistic grammar 
of Hindi written from a typological point of view and is useful for 
linguists working in the area of linguistic typology with special 
reference to Indo-Aryan languages. 
 
Kachru (2006) describes the structure of modern Hindi keeping in 
view primarily the sociolinguistic context of language use. She 
provides description of sounds, devices of word formation, rules of 
phrases, and sentence constructions and conventions and practices of 
language use in spoken and written texts keeping in view recent 
linguistic theories. She  also deals with the information and 

1. INTRODUCTION 
9 
 
discourse structure of the current use of Hindi. This is quite useful 
for linguists and language learners of Hindi in various situations. 
 
Agnihotri (2007) is a practical reference guide to the core structures 
and linguistic features of Hindi. He provides brief description of 
various simple, compound and complex structures of Hindi. Word 
morphology, phonology, and issues related to Devanagari script are 
dealt with adequate examples. It is useful for linguists and students 
of Hindi for reference. 
 
There is a scope for a pedagogically oriented grammar which 
provides essential information for the use of Hindi language learners 
as well as teachers. The present Modern Hindi Grammar is an effort 
in this direction. It is pedagogically oriented; utilizing simpler 
terminology and authentic data from standard spoken and written 
Hindi; providing useful descriptions and tables of grammatical 
categories as well as simple descriptions of phrases, and sentence 
types designed for the use of language learners, teachers of Hindi at 
various levels. The Phonology describes segmental phonemes 
(vowels, consonants), suprasegmentals (length, stress, intonation), 
and morphophonology (alternations, deletion and insertion, 
allomorphs). The Morphology provides descriptions of nominal 
morphology (noun inflection, gender, number, case, postpositions, 
pronouns, adjectives), verb morphology (types of verbs, verb 
inflections, voice, tense, aspect, mood, non-finite verb forms), and 
adverbs. The Syntax describes the structure of phrases, sentence 
types, complex and compound constructions, other syntactic 
constructions among other items. The Lexicon presents a classified 
vocabulary of Hindi under 12 sub-sections. It is followed by Index.

2.1.2.2. Consonants 
 
Consonants are classified into different groups on the basis of their 
manner and place of articulation. Examples of phonemic 
consonantal segments of Hindi are presented in minimal or near 
minimal pairs. Non-phonemic phonetic segments are also 
exemplified. The examples given below represent their phonetic 
transcription.

Stops and Affricates 
 
In the production of stops, air coming out of the lungs is stopped at 
the point of articulation and then released with plosion. Stops occur 
at initial, medial, and final positions of words.

2.1.2.3. Distribution of Phonemes and Allophones 
 
The retroflex voiced aspirated stop Z /dh/ does not occur in the final 
position of words. The velar nasal = /η/, and the retroflex flaps D, 
/r/and Z, /rh/ do not occur in the word-initial positions. 
 
The nasal phoneme na /n/ has dental, retroflex, palatal, and velar 
allophones: na [n], Na [n], and = [η]. Palatal and velar nasals are not 
assigned any phonemic status in Hindi. Phonetically they are 
pronounced in the speech only when they are followed by palatal 
and velar voiced consonant phonemes. They occur before 
homorganic voiced consonants.

2.2.2.2. Word-medial Consonant Clusters 
 
Consonant clusters occur frequently in the medial position. Most of 
these clusters are formed across syllable or morpheme boundaries. 
There are some restrictions in the formation of consonant clusters as 
follows: (i) two aspirated consonants do not combine to form a 
consonant cluster, (ii) /ch/ is not combined to form a consonant 
cluster, (iii) /d/ does not occur as the second member of a consonant 
cluster.  Examples of the consonant clusters are given below.

2.2.3. Syllable Structure 
 
Hindi has a (C)(C)V(C)(C) syllable structure. The assignment of the 
medial units to syllables does not depend on morphological 
structure. The first consonant of the medial cluster is assigned to the 
preceding syllable and the remaining elements of the unit to the 
following syllable. In the following examples, the syllable boundary 
is marked with [+] sign. 
 
nak\ + Saa  
na@Saa 
nak+ša:

map 
sauna\  + dr 
sauMdr 
sun+dar  sundar 
beautiful 
iksa\ + mat 
iksmat 
kis+mat

The vowel-initial syllables are found only in the initial position of 
words.

2.3. Suprasegmental Features 
 
Nasalization, 
length, 
stress, 
intonation, 
and 
juncture 
are 
suprasegmental features. 
 
2.3.1. Nasalization 
 
Nasalization is an important suprasegmental feature in Hindi. All 
the vowels can be nasalized. Nasalization is distinctive so it has 
phonemic status.

2.3.2. Length 
 
Length is phonemic in Hindi. There are three pairs of short and long  
vowels:  /i/ and /i:/;  /a/  and /a:/; /u/ and /u:/. The following minimal 
pairs illustrate the contrast in the length of these vowels.

Stress is not a distinctive feature of Hindi; it is not in phonemic 
contrast. Hindi is a syllable-timed language, sometimes individual 
words are stressed for emphasis only. Usually, the syllable 
preceding the consonant cluster gets stress. 
 
bauiw 
buddhi 
intelligence 
sa%ya 
saty 
truth 
 
The initial cluster of the word also gets stress. 
 
p`oma 
prem 
love 
spYTta 
spaštta: 
clarity 
 
In di-syllabic words where both syllables have long or short vowels, 
the first syllable is stressed. 
 
A@sar 
aksar 
always 
AMdr 
andar 
inside 
Aakar 
a:ka:r 
figure 
Aasamaana 
a:sma:n 
sky 
 
In di-syllable words wherein the first syllable contains low front or 
back vowels, the first syllable is stressed. 
 
f,aOjaI 
føji: 
soldier 
kOdI 
k´di: 
prisoner 
 

2. PHONOLOGY

The second syllable is stressed when the first syllable has a short 
vowel and the second has a long vowel. 
 
nasaIba 
nasi:b 
fate 
iktaba 
kita:b 
book 
 
In tri-syllable words, the first syllable is stressed if the first syllable 
has a long vowel, the second has a short vowel, and the third has a 
long vowel. 
 
baohyaa 
behaya: 
shameless 
baovakUf 
bevaku:ph 
stupid 
 
The last syllable is stressed if the first syllable has a short vowel and 
the last two have long vowels. 
 
ihMdustana 
hindusta:n 
India 
banajaara 
banja:ra: 
nomad 
 
In words of more than three syllables, the stress is always on the 
penultimate syllable. 
 
samaJadarI 
samajhda:ri: 
understanding 
 
2.3.4. Intonation 
 
There are four major types of intonational  patterns: (1) high-fall, 
(2) high-rise, (3) rise-and-fall, (4) mid-level. Intonations have 
syntactic rather than emotional content. Statements have a high-fall 
intonation pattern. Intonation peaks are generally positioned on the 
penultimate word or on the negative particle if there is one. 
 
1. 
vah iktaba pZ, rha hO. 
 
vah kita:b parh raha: h´. 
 
he  book read-pr is 
 
He is reading a book.

ka:gaz  alma:ri:  mẽ  nahĩ:  h´~ 
 
papers almirah in neg are 
 
The papers are not in the almirah. 

2. PHONOLOGY

Yes-no questions and tag questions have a high-rise intonation. 
 
3. 
@yaa vah kla Aayaa? 
 
kya: vah kal a:ya:? 
 
Q  he yesterday came-Q 
 
Did he come yesterday? 
 
Information questions have a rise-and-fall intonation. The rise in 
intonation is registered on the question word and the fall is attained 
gradually. 
 
4. 
Aap kba baaja,ar gae? 
 
a:p kab ba:za:r gaye? 
 
you  when market went 
 
When did you go to the market? 
 
5. 
maaohna iksasao imalaa? 
 
mohan  kisse mila:? 
 
Mohan who-dat met-3s 
 
Who did Mohan meet? 
 
Commands generally follow the mid-level intonational pattern. 
 
6. 
drvaaja,a baMd krao. 
 
darva:za: band karo. 
 
door  close  do-imp 
 
Close the door. 
 
Contrastive and Emphatic Intonation 
 
The contrastive and emphatic intonations are the same as they 
employ more than the average stress on the constituents of a 
sentence. The element to be contrasted carries a slightly higher 
stress than the emphasized segment. For example, any of the 
elements can be emphasized in the following sentence depending on 
the degree of emphasis. The emphasis is indicated by bolding 
different elements.

7c. 
Aap idllaI jaa[e. 
 
a:p dilli: ja:ie.

2.3.5. Juncture 
 
Juncture is functional in Hindi. Internal juncture may be considered 
as phonemic juncture. Mostly, the medial clusters have juncture 
because those sequences of sounds do not occur in the same 
syllable. 
 
mauiSkla 
muškil 
difficult 
Anajaana 
anja:n 
ignorant 
kuta- 
kurta: 
shirt 
badmaaSa 
badma:š 
rogue 
 
The following minimal pairs indicate the phonemic status of 
internal juncture: 
 
Kanaa 
kha:na: 
food 
Ka + naa 
kha: + na: 
to eat 
klaa[- 
kala:i: 
wrist 
kla + Aa[- 
kal + a:i: 
came yesterday 
isaka- 
sirka: 
vinegar 
isar + ka 
sir + ka: 
of the head 
 
There are two types of juncture: (i) internal juncture and (ii) 
external juncture. The internal juncture (+) reduces words into 
phrases or compound words in the sentences.

2.4. Morphophonemics 
 
Various morphological processes can be marked as loss, addition, 
and replacement of phonemes. 
 
2.4.1. Loss of Phoneme 
 
The vowel /a/ in the last syllable is dropped when the suffix /-õ/ is 
added to the word. 
 
AaOrt 
ørat 
woman 
AaOrtaoM 
øratõ 
women (obl) 
pagala 
pa:gal 
mad 
pagalaaoM  pa:glõ 
mad persons (obl) 
 
The consonant na /n/ of a numeral system is lost before any numeral 
suffix beginning with /t t-, r r-, h h-/ is added. 
 
tIna  ti:n  three 
+ 
rh  rah  ten marker 
= 
 torh  terah thirteen 
 
2.4.2. Addition of Phoneme 
 
The vowel e /-e/ is added to the root before the suffixes are added to 
it. 
 
itr  tir   + 
pna  pan 
= 
itropna tirepan  fifty-three 
itr tir   + 
saz  sath 
= 
itrosaz  tiresath  sixty-three 
 

2. PHONOLOGY 
31 
 
When different suffixes are added to the root, the an addition of a 
consonant takes place. 
 
ba  ba 
+ 
tIsa  ti:s 
= 
batIsa  batti:s  thirty-two 
Sak  šak 
+ 
[-  i: 
= 
SakI  šaki:  one who doubts 
 
2.4.3. Alternations 
 
The long vowel  Aao /o/ of the verb root changes to a short vowel ] 
/u/ when the suffix -laa  /-la:/ is added to the verb roots. 
 
Kaola  khol  open 
+ 
laa  la: 
= 
Kulaa  khula:  opened 
rao  ro  weep 
+ 
laa  la: 
= 
Élaa  rula:  to make weep? 
 
The long vowel [- /i:/ of the verb root becomes the short [ /i/ when 
the suffix A -a: is added to the verb root. 
 
pI  pi: drink 
+ 
laa  la: 
= 
ipla  pila:  make drink 
saIK  si:kh learn 
+ 
Aa  a: 
= 
isaKa  sikha:  teach 
 
When the suffixes laa /-la:/ or Aa /-a:/ are attached to the 
monosyllabic verbal stems their vowels e /e/ and Aa /a:/ change into 
[ /i/. 
 
do  de give 
+ 
laa la: 
= 
idlaa  dila:  cause to give 
Ka  kha: eat 
+ 
laa la: 
= 
iKlaa  khila:  cause to eat 
doK  dekh see 
+ 
Aa a:  
= 
idKa  dikha:  cause to see 
 
In certain morphophonemic changes, some consonants are replaced 
by others. 
 
tIna  ti:n three

pna  pan 
= 
itropna  trepan  fifty-three 
[k  ik one 
+ 
caalaIsa  ca:li:s

Morphophonemic changes at junctural points or sandhi are very 
common in Hindi. They usually takes place in compound words.

3. Morphology 
 
This chapter deals with the morphological structure of different 
word classes, describing their inflectional and derivational forms. 
Word classes described include nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, 
adverbs, particles, connectives, and interjections. 
 
3.1. Nouns 
 
3.1.1. Noun Inflection 
 
Nouns in Hindi are inflected for gender, number, and case. There are 
three declensions of nouns; Declension I includes Aa /a:/ ending 
masculine nouns; Declension II includes all other masculine nouns; 
and Declension III includes all feminine nouns. 
 
3.1.1.1. Gender 
 
There are two genders in Hindi: masculine and feminine. Besides 
the natural gender of animate nouns, every inanimate noun is 
assigned a gender. Though the gender of a large number of 
inanimate nouns can be predicted by their endings, there are no hard 
and fast rules for assigning the genders. Masculine forms are 
traditionally taken as basic. The gender formation involves (a) 
suffixation, (b) phonological changes, and (c) suppletion. We can 
make some general observations as follows. 
 
(i) Most of the Aa /a:/ ending masculine nouns have their feminine 
forms ending in [- /i:/. 
 
laD,ka 
larka:

naanaa 
na:na: 
mother’s father
naanaI 
na:ni:

  saalaa sa:la: 
wife’s brother 
saalaI 
sa:li: 
wife’s sister 
pgalaa 
pagla: 
a mad man 
pgalaI 
pagli: 
a mad woman 
 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
34 
 
In the above examples, the final -Aa /-a:/ in the masculine nouns is 
replaced by - [- /-i:/ in their feminine forms. 
 
(ii) Most of the - [- /-i:/ ending animate masculine nouns have their 
feminine forms ending in -Ana /-an/. 
 
Masculine 
Feminine 
QaaobaI dhobi: washerman 
Qaaobana dhoban

ma:li: 
gardener (m)
maalana ma:lan 
gardener (f) 
jaaogaI jogi: 
saint (m) 
jaaogana jogan 
saint (f) 
 
(iii) Some nouns ending in - Aa /-a:/ form their feminine (diminutive) 
by 
 replacing -Aa /-a:/ with - [yaa /-iya:/. 
 
Dbaa daba: box iDibayaa dibiya:
a small box
 
(iv) Most of the -Aa /-a:/ ending inanimate nouns are masculine and -
[- /-i:/ ending inanimate nouns are feminine.

In the above examples, the final -Aa /a:/ in the masculine forms is 
replaced by the suffix -[- /i:/. 
 
(v) The suffix -naI /-ni:/ is added to the masculine nouns to form the 
feminine.

3.1.1.2. Number 
 
There are two numbers: singular and plural. 
 
(i) The -Aa /-a:/ ending masculine nouns (including pronouns and 
adjectives), with a few exceptions change into -e /-e/ ending forms 
in the plural. 
 
Singular 
Plural 
laD,ka larka:

The following -Aa /-a:/ ending masculine nouns do not change in 
their plural form. 
 
ipta 
pita:  
father/fathers 
naota 
neta: 
leader/leaders
diryaa dariya: river/rivers 
 
(ii) All other consonant and/or other vowel-ending nouns do not 
change in their plural forms. 
 
maaor 
mor 
peacock(s) 
kaoT 
kot 
coat(s) 
ga`ama 
gra:m  village(s) 
haqaI 
ha:thi: elephant(s) 
Émaala ruma:l handkerchief/handkerchiefs
QaaoobaI 
dhobi: laundry man/ laundry men 
 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
36 
 
(iii) The feminine plurals are formed by adding the suffix -eM /ẽ/ to 
the consonant-ending singular forms. 
 
iktaba kita:b book iktabaoM
kita:bẽ
books
maoja, 
mez 
table maoja,oM 
mezẽ 
tables 
gaaya 
ga:y 
cow 
gaayaoM 
ga:yẽ 
cows 
 
(iv) The plural suffix -[yaaÐ -iyã: is added to the -[-M -i: ending feminine 
nouns. 
 
laD,kI larki: 
girl  
+ [yaaÐ -iyã:
=
laD,ikyaaÐ
larkiyã: 
girls 
kusaI- 
kursi: 
chair
+ [yaaÐ -iyã: =
kuisa-yaaÐ 
kursiyã:  
chairs 
khanaI kaha:ni: story
+ [yaaÐ -iyã: =
khainayaaÐ kaha:niyã:
stories 
 
Notice that when the suffix is added the final vowel of the stem is 
deleted. 
 
3.1.1.3. Case 
 
The syntactic and semantic functions of noun phrases are expressed 
by case-suffixes, postpositions and derivational processes. There are 
two cases: direct and oblique. Case-suffixes and postpositions are 
used to express syntactic and semantic functions. Case suffixes are 
defined as bound suffixes, which do not occur independently as 
words and are added only to the noun phrases. Case suffixes added 
to the oblique forms of nouns agreeing in number and gender.

indicate 
various 
relationships between the noun phrases and the verb phrases. 
 
3.1.2. Postpositions 
 
Postpositions have specific semantic functions. They express the 
semantic dimensions of a noun such as benefaction, manner, or 
location. The main postpositions are: nao ne ‘ergative marker’; kao ko 
‘to’; ko ilae ke liye ‘for’; pr par ‘on’; maoM mẽ ‘in’; sao se ‘from’; sao se 
‘with’; ka /ko /kI ka/ke/ki: ‘of’.’ The postpositions are written as 
separate words with nouns (Aimat nao amit ne, ]maa kao uma: ko), but they 
are tagged to pronouns (maOMnao m´~ne ]sakao usko, iksaka kiska:). 
 
3.1.2.1. The Postposition nao ne 
 
The postposition nao ne is used with subject noun phrases usually with 
the transitive verbs in the past tense. The verb agrees with the object. 
 
1. 
maOMnao p~ ilaKa. 
 
m´~ne patr likha:

3.1.4. Noun Compounds 
 
Compounds belonging to the noun category are headed by a noun, 
which is a final member of the group. The first member may be a 
noun, an adjective, or a participle and may be declined for number, 
gender and case. A postposition is attached to the final member of 
the compound. 
 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
73 
 
3.1.4.1.  Noun-Noun Compounds 
 
Noun-noun compounds can be divided into several subgroups based 
on semantic criteria: copulative compounds, partial duplicated 
compounds, superordinate compounds, complex compounds, hybrid 
compounds, genitive-noun compound, and participial compounds. 
 
3.1.4.2. Copulative Compounds 
 
Copulative compounds, also known as co-compounds, are composed 
of semantically-related nouns. Each noun behaves as an independent 
constituent in the sense that each may be separately inflected for 
gender and number, though not for a postposition. Members of some 
compounds occur in a fixed order. 
 
maata ipta ma:ta: pita: 
mother and father 
*pita: ma:ta: 
Baa[- baihna bha:i: bahan brother and sister 
?bahan bha:i:
sauK duK sukh dukh 
happiness and sorrow
dukh sukh 
pap punya pa:p puny 
sin and good deeds 
*puny pa:p 
}Ðca naIca ũ:c ni:c 
high and low 
*ni:c ũ:c 
 
3.1.4.3. Reduplicated Compounds 
 
Reduplicated compounds express exhaustive meaning. 
 
Gar Gar ghar ghar 
(house-house) 
every house 
baccaa baccaa bacca: bacca:
(child-child) 
every child 
pOsaa pOsaa p´sa: p´sa: 
(penny-penny)
every penny
 
3.1.4.4. Partially Duplicated Compounds 
 
In a partial duplicated compound, also known as an echo-compound, 
the second member is formed by changing the initial letter of the 
first member. An initial va /v/ is changed into Sa /š/ or pa /p/; all other 
initial consonants or vowels are replaced by va /v/ or Sa /š/. The 
meaning of the ompound extends beyond the meaning of their 
members. The compounds usually represent the meaning of similar 
or associative things. 

3. MORPHOLOGY

3.1.4.5. Superordinate Compounds 
 
In this type of compound, the meaning projected by the members 
does not in any way relate to the meaning of the compound as a 
whole.

3.1.4.6. Complex Compounds 
 
Complex compounds involving three or more nouns are not very 
common in Hindi. 
 
tna mana Qana tan man dhan
(body-mind-money)
devotion
 
3.1.4.7. Hybrid Compounds 
 
In hybrid compounds, one member is usually borrowed from another 
language and the second member is a Hindi noun. 
 
Dbala raoTI dabal roti: (double-bread ) 
bread
rola gaaD,I rel ga:ri:

3.1.4.8. Adjective-Noun Compounds 
 
A large number of compounds are composed of an adjective 
followed by a noun. There are no single terms for them.

3.1.4.9. Modifier-Noun Compounds 
 
In modifier-noun compounds, the first member acts like a modifier 
or source and the second member is a noun. 
 
baOla gaaD,I b´l ga:ri: (bull-vehicle) 
bullock cart 
gaMgaa jala gaηa: jal 
(Ganges-water)

3.2. Pronouns 
 
Pronouns are inflected for number and case. Broadly, there are seven 
classes of pronouns in Hindi: personal, demonstrative, relative, 
possessive, reflexive, interrogative, and indefinite. Pronouns in the 
direct and oblique cases are presented below.

Note that the personal pronoun Aap a:p is used as an honorific form 
of address for both singular and plural subjects. In the polite speech, 
it is occasionally used for a person spoken about in place of yao ye. 
The term laaoga log may be attached to a plural pronoun for defining or 
emphasizing plurality: Aap laaoga a:p log, hma laaoga ham log, tuma laaoga tum log, 
yao laaoga ye log, vao laaoga ve log.

Note that the demonstrative pronouns are also used as personal 
pronouns of the third person. 
 
There are two additional pronouns which are used in the sense of ‘so 
and so’ to refer to third person subjects: Amauk amuk and f,laaM falã:/ 
f,laanaa fala:na:. 
 
3.2.3. Relative Pronouns 
 
Hindi has one relative pronoun: jaao jo ‘who, which, that, what’ in 
both the singular and plural. It is accompanied with vah vah in the 
main sentence called correlative of jaao jo. The correlative form saao so 
‘he, they’ is now obsolete, it is used in proverbs and sayings. The 
term laaoga log may be added to jaao jo to indicate or emphasize plurality: 
jaao laaoga jo log. The oblique forms of the relative pronoun used along 
with the case-signs are as follows. 
 
Singular 
Plural 
ijasa jis/ijasanao jisne 
ijana jin/ijaMhaoMnao jinhõne 
ijasakao jisko/ijasao jise ijanakao jinko/ijaMhoM jinhẽ
ijasasao jis se 
ijanasao jin se 
 
3.2.4. Reflexive Pronouns 
 
Reflexive pronouns substitute and refer to a noun or pronoun which 
is the logical subject of the sentence. Hindi has three reflexive 
pronouns: Aap a:p, its oblique forms Apnaa apna: and Apnao apne, and a 
compound form of these two, Apnao Aap apne-a:p. The oblique form 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
78 
 
Aapsa a:pas means ‘each other’ or ‘one another.’ The reflexive 
pronoun Aap a:p is also substituted by the Sanskrit borrowed term svayaM 
svayam or Persian-borrowed term K,ud khud in Sanskritized and 
Persianized styles respectively. The reflexive pronoun Aap a:p 
optionally followed by the emphatic form hI hi: has an adjectival 
meaning. It can also be used as an adverb in the meaning ‘of one’s 
own accord, spontaneously.’ Similarly, Apnao Aap apne-a:p can either 
be used in an emphatic sense or in the adverbial meaning of ‘of 
one’s own accord.’ 
 
1. 
vah Aap hIÀApnao Aap Gar gayaa. 
 
vah a:p hi: / apne-a:p ghar gaya: 
 
he himself emp home went 
 
He himself went home. 
 
Note that the oblique forms of Apnao apne and Apnao Aap apne-a:p 
(except 
when 
adverbial) 
mean 
‘oneself’ 
with 
the 
case-
signs/postpositions kaooo ko, sao se, maoM mẽ, and pr par. 
 
3.2.5. Interrogative Pronouns 
 
In both singular and plural, there are two basic interrogative 
pronouns: kaOna køn ‘who’(referring to person) and @yaa kya: 
‘what’(referring to things). The interrogative pronoun @yaa kya: is a 
neutral form. It is also used for denoting the interrogative nature of 
the sentence. Note that kaOna køn and  @yaa kya: can be used as relative 
pronouns too. 
 
2. 
kaOna Aayaa¸ kao[- nahIM jaanata. 
 
køn a:ya:, koyi: nahĩ: ja:nta: 
 
who came no one neg knows 
 
Nobody knows who came. 
 
The interrogative pronoun @yaa kya: is also used as an exclamatory 
adjective. 
 
3. 
@yaa sauMdr baaga hO! 
 
kya: sundar ba:g h´! 
 
what beautiful garden is 
 
What a beautiful garden! 
 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
79 
 
It is also used as an emphatic negation. 
 
4. 
laD,kI @yaa hO¸ naaja,uk fUla hO. 
 
larki: kya: h´, na:zuk phu:l h´. 
 
girl what is delicate flower is 
 
It is not a girl; it is a delicate flower. 
 
 (What a girl! Just like a delicate flower.) 
 
Interrogative adverbial forms related to these pronouns are: kba kab 
‘when,’ kOsaa kaisa: ‘how,’ kaOnasaa kønsa: ‘which one,’ iktnaa kitna: ‘how 
much.’ 
 
3.2.6. Indefinite Pronouns 
 
There are two indefinite pronouns in Hindi: kao[- koi: ‘someone, 
somebody’and kuC kuch ‘something.’ kuC kuch is also used as an 
adjective (numeral and quantitative) and as an adverb meaning 
‘some, a few, a little, partly.’ Similarly, kao[- koi: can be used as an 
adverb in the sense of ‘some, about.’ It can refer to ‘something’ if 
used with -saa -sa:/-saI -si: = kao[- saa koi: sa:/ kao[- saI koi: si:. kao[- koi: may 
also be used as the plural form to indicate ‘some people.’ 
 
3.2.7. Oblique Forms of Pronouns 
 
Whereas the same case-signs namely nao ne, kao ko, k sao se, maOM mẽ, pr par 
and ka ka: are attached to pronouns as they are attached to nouns, in 
some cases the oblique forms of pronouns are formed differently.

Note that (i) when the case-signs are added the singular forms yah 
yeh, vah vah, jaao jo, and saao so change to [sa is, ]sa us, ijasa jis and itsa tis 
respectively; kaOna køn and @yaa kya: change to iksa kis; and kuC kuch 
changes to iksaI kisi:. (ii) In the plural, except before nao ne, these 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
80 
 
change to [na in, ]na un, ijana jin, itna tin, ikna kin, and ikMhIM kinhĩ:. (iii) 
Before nao ne, the plural oblique forms are: [nhUM inhũ:, ]nhaoM unhũ:, ijanhaMo 
jinhũ:, iknhaMo kinhũ:, and iknhIM kinhĩ:. (iv) maOM m´~ and tU tu: remain 
unchanged before nao ne: (maOMnao m´~ne, tUnao tu:ne). v) Followed by other 
case-signs, maOM m´~ and tU tu: change to mauJa mujh and tUJa tujh (mauJakao 
mujhko, tuJakao tujhko). (vi) The pronouns hma ham and tuma tum remain 
unchanged before all case-signs: hmakao hamko, tumhoM tumhẽ. (vii) The 
postposition ka ka: is not attached to maOM m´~, tU tu:, and tuma tum. They 
change to the following forms agreeing with the object noun in 
gender and number. 
 
Masculine 
Feminine

maorI meri: 
tora tera:

torI teri: 
tumhara tumha:ra: tumharo tumha:re
tumharI tumha:ri:
 
(viii) As an alternative to kao ko, all oblique forms attach an e e in 
singular and hoM hẽ in plural: [sao ise/[sakao isko, ]sao use/]nakao unko, [nhoM inhẽ 
/[nakao inko, ]nhoM unhẽ/]nakao unko, tumhoM tumhẽ/tuJao tujhe, hmaoM hamẽ/hmakao 
hamko. In the case of ham, eoM ẽ is added, not hoM hẽ. Note that eoM ẽ or hoM 
hẽ is not attached to the indefinite pronouns kao[- koi: and kuC kuch. 
 
As pointed out earlier, the reflexive pronoun ]Aap a:p changes to 
]Apnao apne before the case signs kao ko, ]sao se, maoM mẽ, and pr par. nao ne is 
not added to the reflexive Aap a:p but only to the subject to which Aap 
a:p refers. For denoting various senses of ka ka:, Aap a:p changes to 
Apnaa apna:, Apnao apne, and ApnaI apni:. 
 
3.2.8. Compound Pronouns 
 
Two, or more than two pronouns may be compounded or the same 
pronoun may be repeated to convey various shades of meanings. 
The following are some important compound pronouns. 
 
Apnao Aap apne a:p 
by oneself 
Aap hI Aap a:p hi: a:p 
by oneself, to oneself

3.3. Adjectives 
 
Adjectives in Hindi can be classified into two groups: (i) inflected 
and (ii) uninflected. 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
82 
 
 
3.3.1. Inflected 
 
These adjectives are inflected for gender and number. 
 
Masculine 
Feminine 
Sg 
Pl 
Sg / Pl 
 
baD,a bara: 
baD,o bare 
baD,I bari:

CaoTa chota: 
CaoTo chote 
CaoTI choti:

laMbaa lamba: 
laMbao lambe 
laMbaI lambi: 
tall 
kalaa ka:la: 
kalao kale 
kalaI ka:li: 
black 
hra hara: 
hro hare 
hrI hari: 
green
AcCa accha: AcCo acche
AcCI acchi:
good 
 
3.3.2. Uninflected 
 
These adjectives are not inflected for number and gender. 
 
sauMdr laD,ka/laD,kI sundar larka: /laṛki: 
beautiful boy/girl
duKI AadmaI /aAaOrt dukhi: admi:/ ørat 
sad man/woman 
safod kpD,a /kmaIja, saphed kapra: /kami:z
white cloth/shirt 
 
3.3.3. Types of Adjectives 
 
There are two broad types of adjectives: (i) those that describe a 
quality or quantity, and (ii) those that distinguish one person or thing 
from another. 
 
(i) Quality is expressed either by a basic adjective or by an adjective 
derived from a noun. 
 
sauMdr laD,kI sundar larki: 
a beautiful girl
SamaI-laa laD,ka šarmi:la: larka:
a bashful boy 
 
The adjective SamaI-laa šarmi:la: is derived by adding the suffix - [--laa 
i:la: to the noun stem. Negative qualities are expressed by a separate 
set of adjectives and also by adding negative prefixes. 
 
badsaUrt AaOrt bad-su:rat ørat
an ugly woman 
baoSama- laD,ka be-šarm larka: 
a shameless boy

3. MORPHOLOGY 
83 
 
 
Quantity may be expressed either by numerals or by the adjectives 
of quantity like bahut bahut / AiQak adhik ‘a lot,’ kaf,I ka:fi: ‘sufficient,’ 
kma kam ‘less,’ qaaoD,a thora: ‘a little.’ 
 
Co iktabaoM che kita:bẽ 
six books 
bahut laoga bahut log 
many people
qaaoD,a dUQa thora: du:dh a little milk 
 
Adjectives of quantity may also be formed by the combination of 
numeral + unit of measure + (classifier (terms of weight, 
length))/genitive postposition) (+ the particle vaalaa va:la:) + noun. 
 
 
dao saaO gaja, laMbaI ³vaalaI´ rssaI. 
 
do sø gaz lambi: (va:li:) rassi: 
 
two hundred yards long (gen.) rope 
 
the two-hundred-yard long rope 
 
 
dao iklaao vaja,na vaalaa p%qar. 
 
do kilo vazan va:la: patthar 
 
two kilo weight-gen stone 
 
the stone weighing two kilograms 
 
The postposition sao se is used in the formation of reduplicated 
adjectival phrases. 
 
AiQak sao AiQak adhik se adhik 
at most 
kma sao kma 
kam se kam 
at least 
AcCo sao AcCa 
acche se accha: 
the best of all
bauro sao baura 
bure se bura: 
worst of all 
maIzo sao maIza 
mi:the se mi: tha:
very sweet 
 
Almost all pronouns can function as adjectives. The demonstrative 
adjectives that point out persons or things yah - yeh ‘this,’ ye ‘these’ 
vah vah ‘that,’ ve ‘those’ - are used in the initial position. 
 
yah Gar 
yeh ghar 
this house 
yao iktabaoM 
ye kita:bẽ these books 
vah laD,ka vah larka: that boy 
vao baccao 
ve bacce 
those children
 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
84 
 
 
Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions. 
 
kaOna laD,ka? køn laṛka:? which boy? 
@yaa kama? kya: ka:m? 
what work?
 
The possessive pronouns particularize or show relation. 
 
maora / tora daost 
mera:/tera: dost 
my/your friend 
maorI / AapkI baihna meri:/a:pki: bahan
my/your sister 
]saka / ]naka Baa[- uska:/unka: bha:i: 
his/their brother
 
Indefinite and relative pronouns, too, function as adjectives. 
 
kao[- AKbaar koi: akhba:r 
some newspaper
kuC saibja,yaaÐ 
kuch sabziyã:
some vegetables 
jaao baccaa 
jo bacca: 
the child who 
 
3.3.4. Degree of Adjectives 
 
There are three varieties of adjectival degrees: superlative, 
comparative and minimal. Superlative and comparative degrees of 
qualities are denoted with the help of the postposition sao se attached 
to the noun or pronoun (in oblique form) with which the comparison 
is made. Superlative involves comparison with all. For example, 
 
saba sao baD,I [maart 
sab se bari: ima:rat 
the biggest building 
saba sao sauMdr laD,kI sab se sundar larki:
the most beautiful girl
 
Comparative involves comparison between two. 
 
Apnao daost sao laMbaa apne dost se lamba:
taller than his friend
 
Minimal involves no comparison. 
 
maora AcCa daost mera: accha: dost
my good friend
 
The postposition maoM mẽ is also alternately used to denote the 
superiority of one out of two or more. 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
85 
 
 
daonaaoM maoM baD,a donõ: mẽ bara:
bigger of the two
saba maoM }Ðcaa sab mẽ ũ:ca: 
the tallest 
 
Sometimes, the phrase kI Apoxaa ki: apekša: ‘in comparison to’ is 
substituted for sao se. 
 
]maa kI Apoxaa laMbaI uma: ki: apekša: lambi:
taller than Uma
 
Notice that words AiQak/j,yaada adhik/zya:da: ‘more’ and kma kam ‘less’ 
may be prefixed to adjectives for denoting comparison. 
 
saaonao sao AiQak 
camakIlaa 
sone se adhik 
camki:la: 
brighter than gold 
fUla sao j,yaada kaomala 
phu:l se zya:da: komal
more delicate than a 
flower 
baIsa sao kma 
bi:s se kam 
less than twenty

When saa sa: ‘like’ is attached to the oblique forms of nouns or 
pronouns, they function as adjectives. 
 
fUla saa phu:l sa: 
flower-like 
mauJasaa mujh sa:/ tumasaa tum sa:
me-like/you-like
 
saa sa: is also attached to adjectives to denote ‘looking, seeming.’ 
When added to quantitative adjectives, it intensifies the meaning. 
 
laala saa la:l sa: 
red-looking 
baD,a saa bara: sa: 
big-looking 
dubalaa saa dubla: sa:

bahut saa bahut sa: 
a great deal 
qaaoD,a saa thora: sa: 
just a little 
 
The forms of saa sa: (agreeing in number and gender with the noun) 
are also added to the genitive/possessive forms to denote a similarity 
of quality, or possession. 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
88 
 
 
gaaya ka saa mauMh ga:y ka: sa: mũh 
a face like that of a cow
]nako sao kpD,o unke se kapre 
clothes similar to his 
maorI meri:/ torI saI naak teteri: si: na:k

than indefinite or interrogative ones.) 
 
baMdr saa/jaOsaa bandar sa:/j´sa:
similar to a monkey
tuma saa/jaOsaa tum sa:/j´sa: 
like you 
 
The forms of saa sa: can be added to kao[- koi: and kaOna køn to indicate 
‘any one,’ and ‘which one’ respectively. 
 
kao[- saa rMga koi:-sa: raη 
any color 
kao[- saI kmaIja, koi:-si: kami:z
any shirt 
kaOna saa kaoT køn-sa: kot

dasguna: ‘tenfold,’ baIsagaunaa bi:sguna: ‘twentyfold,’ tIsagaunaa ti:sguna: 
‘thirtyfold,’ saaOgaunaa søguna: ‘hundredfold,’ hja,argaunaa haza:rguna: 
‘thousandfold. The gaunaa guna: can be attached to fractions too: savaa gaunaa 
sava: guna: 1¼ times as much, D,oZ gaunaa derh guna: 1½ times as much, 
Z,a[- gaunaa dha:i: guna: 2 ½ times as much. 
 
3.3.6.5.  Approximation 
 
Approximation is expressed by placing kao[- koi:, lagaBaga lagbhag, or p`aya: 
pra:ya: before the numeral. 
 
kao[- baIsa AadmaI 
koi: bi:s a:dmi: 
about twenty persons

3.3.6.6.  Aggregation 
 
Aggregation is expressed by adding - AaoM -õ to a numeral. In the case 
of dao do, -naaoM -nõ is added. (e.g., daonaaoM donõ ‘both,’ tInaaoM ti:nõ ‘all the 
three,’ caaraoM ca:rõ ‘all the four,’ dsaaoM dasõ ‘all the ten,’ baIsaaoM bi:sõ ‘all the 
twenty,’ etc.). Notice that -[yaaoM -iyõ is added to numerals dsa das or baIsa 
bi:s to indicate an indefinite large number (e.g., disayaaoM dasiyõ ‘several 
tens,’ baIisayaaoM bi:siyõ ‘several scores,’ etc.) 
 
The suffix -AaoM -õ is also added to the nouns signifying duration, 
measures, weight to indicate large and indefinite number or quantity. 
(e.g., mahInaaoM mahi:nõ ‘a number of months,’ barsaaoM barsõ ‘a number of 
years,’ baaoiryaaoM Anaaja boriyõ ana:j ‘sackfulls of grains,’ etc. 
 
3.4. Verbs 
 
There are two types of verbs: main and auxiliary. 
 
3.4.1. The Verb hona: 
 
The verb haonaa hona: ‘to be’ is used as a copula in simple predicative 
sentences, as well as an auxiliary in different types of verbal 
constructions. The verb haonaa hona: has four sets of verbal forms: 
present, past, presumptive, and subjunctive.

3.4.2. Main Verbs 
 
There are three types of main verbs: simple verbs, conjunct verbs, 
and compound verbs. A simple verb may consist of one main verb 
and person, gender, number, tense, and aspect markers. In the 
compound verb construction, the person, gender, number, and aspect 
markers are taken by the explicators/operators, and in the conjunct 
verbal construction they are taken by the verb element. We will 
classify the verbal constructions as intransitive, transitive, 
ditransitive, causative, dative, conjunct, and compound. 
 
3.4.2.1.  Intransitive Verbs 
 
Intransitive verbs like Aa a: ‘come,’ jaa ja: ‘go’ ]z uth ‘get up,’ and baOz 
b´th ’sit.’ do not take a direct object and are not marked by any 
postposition in the present or future tense. Subjects in such cases are 
controlled by the verb agreement. 
 
1. 
vah jaata hO. 
 
vah ja:ta: h´. 
 
he go-ptc is 
 
He goes. 
 
2. 
Aimat Gar jaaegaa. 
 
amit ghar ja:ega:. 
 
Amit home go-fut 
 
Amit will go home. 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
96 
 
Besides verb agreement, subjects demonstrate a number of other 
properties which are explained below. Intransitive verbs in the past 
tense take their subjects in the direct case. 
 
3. 
vah bahut qak ga[-. 
 
vah bahut thak gai:. 
 
she very tired aux 
 
She was dead tired. 
 
4. 
Aimat samaya pr Aayaa. 
 
amit samay par a:ya:. 
 
Amit time at came 
 
Amit came on time. 
 
Some intransitive verbs, such as Kola khel ‘play’ and laD, lar ‘fight,’ 
may sometimes be used as transitives when they take abstract nouns 
as objects. 
 
Intransitive 
Transitive 
Kolanaa khelna: to play
Kola Kolanaa khel khelna:

laD,a[- lara:i:

mohan khela:. 
 
Mohan played. 
 
5a. 
maaohna Kola Kolaa. 
 
mohan ne khel khela:.

3.4.2.2. Transitive Verbs 
 
Transitive verbs, such as pZ, parh ‘read,’ ilaK likh ‘write,’ laa la: 
‘bring,’ do de ‘give,’ lao le ‘take,’ and kr kar ‘do,’ take direct objects, 
and in the past tense they require their subjects must be marked with 
the ergative case markers agreeing with the object in gender and 
number.

A few transitive verbs like baaola bol ‘to speak,’ samaJa samjh ‘to 
understand’ and BaUla bhu:l ‘to forget’ are sometimes used as 
intransitives and do not take an ergative case marker. 
 
8. 
maOM baaolaa/ samaJaa/ BaUlaa. 
 
m´~ bola: / samjha: / bhu:la:.

3.4.2.3. Ditransitive Verbs 
 
Some verbs like donaa dena: ‘to give,’ saunaa suna: ‘to tell,’ baocanaa becna: ‘to 
sell’ are called ditransitives. Ditransitives take three arguments, 
namely, subject, object, and indirect objects. Indirect objects are 
always marked in the dative. Other arguments follow the transitive 
pattern noted above.

uma: ne bacce ko kaha:ni: suna:i:. 
 
Uma-erg child-dat story-fs told-fs 
 
Uma told a story to the child. 
 
3.4.2.4. Causative Verbs 
 
Casuative verbs may be derived from transitive verbs by adding 
causative suffixes. They include the transitive verbs derived from 
intransitives. Causative verbs are, therefore, invariably transitive and 
take the same forms as other transitive verbs. There are two types of 
causative forms: causal I and causal II. 
 
Causal I forms 
 
Causal I verbs are formed by adding the causal suffix -a: to the 
transitive verb form. As a result of adding this suffix, certain 
morphophonemic changes take place. 
 

3. MORPHOLOGY

(a) Consonant ending roots with short vowels remain unchanged.

(b) The long vowels of the verb roots are shortened. The vowels e /e/ 
and [- /i:/ change to [ /i/. 
 
Transitive 
Causal I 
doK dekh 
see 
idKa dikha:
show 
saIK si:kh learn isaKa sikha: make x learn
 
(c) The long vowel ending verb roots are shortened and the suffix 
-laa -la: instead of -Aa-a:, is added to derive the first causal forms. As 
a result of adding the causative suffix to the verb root, the vowels e 
/e/ and Aa /a:/ change to [/i/, and Aao /o/ changes to /u/. 
 
Transitive 
Causal I 
pI pi:

Qaao dho

Causal II or extended causatives are formed by adding the causal II 
suffix -vaa -va: to the verb roots. 
 
Causal I 
Causal II 
saunaa suna:

(a) As a result of adding the causal II suffix to the transitive verb 
root, the vowel Aao /o/ changes to ] /u/. 
 
taoD, tor break tuD,vaa turva:
cause x to break
 
(b) There are few irregular forms. In the following example, the 
causal suffix -vaa -va is added to the intransitive verb root ibak bik 
‘sell’ instead of its transitive verb form baoca be:c: 
 
baoca bec sell ibakvaa bikva:
cause x to sell
 
(c) In certain cases, the meanings of the first and second causals are 
the same as in kranaa kara:na:/ krvaanaa karva:na: ‘to get done’ or Qaulaanaa 
dhula:na:/ Qaulavaanaa dhulva:na: ‘to get washed.’

3.4.2.5. Dative Verbs 
 
Most dative verbs fall into the stative-inchoative category of verbs. 
They represent a small class of verbs but are very frequently used. 
They can be derived by substituting the intransitive verbs haonaa hona: 
‘to be,’ and Aanaa a:na: ‘to come’ in place of krnaa karna: ‘to do’ in 
active/conjunct verbs as given below.

3.4.2.6. Conjunct Verbs 
 
A conjunct verb consists of a noun or an adjective and a verb, which 
takes all the verbal inflections. The verbs may be transitive or 
intransitive. The most frequent verbs used in conjunct verbal 
const+ructions are krnaa karna: ‘to do’ and haonaa hona: ‘to be.’ Other 
verbs used are donaa dena: ‘to give,’ Aanaa a:na: ‘to come,’ and laganaa 
lagna: ‘to feel.’ 
 
15. 
maOMnao Apnaa kama samaaPt ikyaa. 
 
m´~ne apna: ka:m sama:pt kiya:. 
 
I-erg self’s work finish did 
 
I finished my work. 
 
15a. yah kama samaaPt huAa. 
 
yeh ka:m sama:pt hua:.

This work is done. 
 
16. 
drvaaja,a baMd krao.

Close the door. 
 
16a. drvaaja,a baMd huAa. 
 
darva:za: band hua:. 
 
door close be-past 
 
The door was closed. 
 
One class of conjunct verbs is formed by the combination of a noun 
and an intransitive verb, which requires the subject to be marked in 
the oblique case. This class includes psychological predicates such 
as gaussaa Aanaa gussa: a:na: ‘to be angry,’ BaUK laganaa bhu:kh lagna:’to be 
hungry,’ Pyaasa laganaa pya:s lagna:, ‘to be thirsty,’ trsa Aanaa taras a:na: ‘to 
have pity.’ It also includes non-volitional verbs such as idKa[- donaa 
dikha:i: dena: ‘to be seen.’ 

3. MORPHOLOGY

He is not able to see the difference. 
 
3.4.2.7. Compound Verbs 
 
Compound verbs in Hindi are combination of Verb 1 + Verb 2 (+ 
inflections). Whereas Verb 1 (also called main verb) expresses 
general meaning and occurs in its stem form, verb 2, which is called 
an explicator/operator, takes all the inflections. The explicators 
belong to a small group of verbs. The original meaning of the 
explicator is lost. They add certain aspectual values, such as 
completion of an action, benefaction, or intensification, to the main 
verb. The most frequent explicators are listed below with their actual 
meaning and the aspectual meanings they add to main verbs. 
 
Explicators 
Aspectual Values 
Aa a: 
come 
change of state from within 
jaa ja: 
go 
change of state 
lao le 
take 
action for or toward others 
pD, par

jaa ja:

Dala da:l

speed, recklessness, relief, completion
CaoD, chor

3. MORPHOLOGY 
104 
 
rK rakh

action for completion, direction 
cala cal 
walk 
direction away, completion 
mar mar 
die 
completion, lack of control 
maar ma:r

change of state, suddenness 
 
Thus, a compound verb is made of two verbs, the first, the main verb 
which expresses its general meaning and, the second, an 
explicator/operator which is conjugated for different inflections. A 
large number of compound verbs are formed by the combination of 
verbs in which the first verb represents the meaning and the 
explicator takes all the grammatical inflections. Examples of such 
verbs are: Aa jaanaa a: ja:na: ‘to come,’ imala jaanaa mil ja:na: ‘to get,’ Ka laonaa 
kha: lena: ‘to eat,’ pI laonaa pi: lena: ‘to drink,’ lao Aanaa le a:na: ‘to 
bring,’ KrId laonaa xari:d lena: ‘to buy,’ cala donaa cal dena: ‘to leave,’ kr 
baOznaa kar b´thna: ‘to do,’ kr Dalanaa kar da:lna: ‘to do,’ kr CaoD,naa kar 
chorna: ‘to do,’ do donaa de dena: ‘to give.’

There are verbal phrases in which there are two or more inflexible 
verbs, such as pIta gayaa pi:ta gaya: ‘went on drinking,’ saunata rha sunta: 
raha: ‘kept on listing,’ saaoyaa pD,a rha soya: para: raha: ‘remained

3.4.3. Tense 
 
Tense and aspect are major grammatical categories of the verbal 
system in Hindi. There are three grammatical aspects: habitual, 
progressive, and perfective. Each of them is expressed by marking 
the verbal stems. 
 
Hindi has six tenses: present, past, future, present perfect, habitual 
past, and past perfect. The present tense represents an ongoing 
action, a habitual, repeated or characteristic action, or simply 
expresses a fact.

3.4.4. Aspect 
 
Verbal forms indicating one of these aspects are specified for one of 
the four tenses: present, past, presumptive, and subjunctive. The 
combination of one of the three aspects with the four different tenses 
results in the production of various aspectual-tenses: present-
habitual, past-habitual, presumptive-habitual, subjunctive-habitual, 
present-progressive, 
past-progressive, 
presumptive-progressive, 
subjunctive-progressive, 
present-perfective, 
past-perfective, 
presumptive-perfective, and subjunctive-perfective. It also permits 
the simple-perfective form. Besides these aspectual verb forms, 
some non-aspectual verb forms of Hindi are the future, root 
subjunctive, and the imperative and infinitive forms. They will be 
discussed separately. 
 
3.4.4.1. Habitual Aspect 
 
The habitual aspectual-tenses are formed by adding the following 
suffixes to the verb stems agreeing with the subject in gender and 
number: 
 
Masculine 
Feminine
Sg

3.4.5. Mood 
 
In Hindi there are three moods: indicative, imperative, and optative. 
 
3.4.5.1. Indicative Mood 
 
The indicative represents the action as a fact or makes a query about 
it. The verb can be used in habitual (hab), progressive (prog), or 
perfective (perf) aspects. The present and past participle forms of 
these verbs have been explained above. The following aspectual 
marks are added to the verb stem bol ‘say’ in the indicative mood.

The above paradigm shows the agreement of indicative mood with 
gender and number. 
 
3.4.5.2. Imperative Mood 
 
The imperative expresses an action as a command, a request, a 
warning, a prohibition, etc. The imperative is restricted to the future 
and cannot refer to the present or past tenses. Since the imperative 
denotes a command, request, etc., its proper domain is the second 
person. Indirect commands or requests made to a third person are 
expressed by the subjunctive form. In imperative constructions, the 
subject is omitted and can be guessed from both the context and the 
form of the verb. The verb agrees with the second person subject 
which has three second person pronominal forms: (i) intimate, (ii) 
familiar, and (iii) polite. 
 
The intimate imperative forms are used in issuing orders/commands 
for those who are usually addressed with the intimate second person 
pronoun tU tu: ‘you.’ The familiar imperatives are used in issuing 
commands to all those who are normally addressed by the familiar 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
117 
 
second-person pronoun tuma tum ‘you.’ Polite imperatives are used for 
making requests to those who are normally addressed by the second 
person pronoun Aap a:p ‘you.’

3.4.5.3. Subjunctive Mood 
 
The subjunctive forms are formed by adding certain suffixes to the 
verb stems that agree with the subjects in person and number, e.g., 
 
 
Sg 
Pl 
1st person 
-}Ð -ũ: -eÐ -ẽ 
2nd person (familiar) -e -e 
-Aao -o
2nd person (polite) 
-eÐ -ẽ 
-eÐ -ẽ 
3rd person 
-e -e 
-eÐ -ẽ 
 
The subjunctive forms of the verb haonaa hona: ‘to be’ have been given 
in 3.4.1.(d). Here we will illustrate the subjunctive forms of a few 
other verbs.

3.4.7. Non-finite Verb Forms 
 
We have discussed various finite verbal forms under tense, aspect, 
mood, and voice above. We will now discuss the non-finite forms of 
verbs which include infinitives and participles. 
 
3.4.7.1. Infinitives 
 
Infinitives are formed by adding the suffix -naa -na: to the verb stems: 
Aanaa a:na: ‘to come,’ jaanaa ja:na: ‘to go,’ krnaa karna: ‘to do,’ ilaKnaa 
likhna: ‘to write,’ etc. Infinitives are used both as nouns and as 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
123 
 
adjectives. An infinitive is usually an abstract noun and, being an 
abstract noun, it is not used in the plural. 
 
1. 
jaldI saaonaa zIk hO. 
 
jaldi: sona: thi:kh h´. 
 
early sleep-inf good is 
 
It is good to go to sleep early.

3. 
maOMnao ]sao jaanao sao raoka. 
 
m´~ne use ja:ne se roka:. 
 
I-erg he-dat go-inf-obl from stop-pst

Despite being a noun, the infinite can take an object.

vah kama krnao maoM toja, hO. 
 
vah ka:m karne mẽ tez h´. 
 
he work do-inf-obl in fast is 
 
He is prompt in (his) work. 
 
The postposition kao ko ‘to’ is not added when the infinitive is used as 
an object. 
 
5. 
vah iktaba laanaa BaUla gayaa. 
 
vah kita:b la:na: bhu:l gaya:. 
 
he book bring-inf forget go-operator-pst 
 
He forgot to bring the book. 
 
6. 
maOM ]sao imalanao jaa}Ðgaa. 
 
m´~ use milne ja:ũ:ga:. 
 
I him-obl meet-inf-obl go-fut 
 
I will go to see him. 
 
Infinitives are frequently used as adjectives in combination with 
verbs denoting obligation, necessity, requirement, or compulsion 
like caah ca:h ‘want,’ hao ho ‘be,’ and pD, par ‘compulsion. The 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
124 
 
compounds made are passive in meaning. 
 
7. 
maOM caaya pInaa caahta hUÐM. 
 
m´~ ca:y pi:na: cahta: hũ:

use ka:m ša:m tak sama:pt karna: tha: 
 
he-obl work evening up to finish do-inf be-past-obligatory 
 
He had to finish the work by evening. 
 
When an infinitive is transitive, it is used as an adjective for its 
object and changes its ending -naa -na: to -naI -ni: or -nao -ne. 
 
10. 
]sao pOsao laanao hMO. 
 
use p´se la:ne h´~. 
 
he-obl money bring-inf-obl-pl be-obligatory

3.4.7.2. Participles 
 
Participles in Hindi are largely verbal in nature and function as 
adjectives and adverbs. They are of two types: imperfective and 
perfective. Whereas imperfective participles represent incomplete or 
unfinished activities, perfective participles designate completed 

3. MORPHOLOGY 
125 
 
verbal activities. 
 
3.4.7.2.1. Imperfective Participles 
 
When used adjectivally, imperfective participles are formed by 
adding the suffixes -ta -ta: (ms), -to -te (mp), -tI -ti (fs), and -tIM -tĩ: 
(fp) that are made to agree with the noun in gender and number. 
Adjectival imperfective participles are expanded with one of the 
simple perfective forms of haonaa hona: ‘to be,’ like huAa hua: (ms), and 
hue hue (p), and hu[- hui: (fs). 
 
1. 
daOD,ta huAa AadmaI Ék gayaa. 
 
dørta: hua: a:dmi: ruk gaya:.

daftar se løtte hue m´~ne phal khari:de.

he home go-ptc time sad was

3.4.7.2.2. Perfective Participles 
 
Perfective participles are formed by adding the adjectival suffixes -
Aa -a:, -e -e, and -[- -i: to verb stems agreeing with the noun in 
person, gender, and number. A few perfective stems are irregular. 
Perfective participles represent a verbal activity carried through to 
completion. Perfective participles may be employed either 
adjectivally or adverbially. The adjectival participles are expanded 
with the forms of huAa hua:, hue hue, and hu[- hui: that agree with the 
modified noun in person, gender, and number. 
 
9. 
baOza (huAa ) laD,ka 
 
b´tha: (hua:) larka:

There are two types of adverbial participles. In one type, the 
invariable suffix –e -e is employed.

chat par b´the hue vah ga: raha: tha:.

Amar-dat America from came-perf.ptc two years elapsed are 
 
It has been two years since Amar came from America. 
 
3.4.7.2.3. Conjunctive Participles 
 
Conjunctive participles are used to form sentences in which two 
verbal activities share the same subject and one of the activities is a 
temporal antecedent of the other. In this construction, the verb of the 
first clause is used in the verb stem form and is immediately 
followed by kar, while the verb of the subsequent clause takes all 
the conjugation markers. 
 
15. 
vah Gar phuÐcakr baaja,ar gayaa. 
 
vah ghar pahũckar ba:za:r gaya:. 
 
he home reach after-cp market went

he-erg neewspaper read after-cp letter-fs wrote-fs

amar dør kar a:ya:. 
 
Amar run do-cp came

pronouns. Locative adverbs are formed by adding the -[-M -ĩ:/ -AaM pr -
ã: par suffixes: yahaÐ yahã:/ yahIM pr yahĩ:(par) ‘here,’ vahaÐ vah-ã:/ vahIM 
vahĩ:/ vahaÐ hI vahã: hi: ‘there,’ khaÐ kahã:/ khIM kahĩ: ‘where.’ 
Directional adverbs are formed by adding the suffix -sao -se/-kI -ki: or

3. MORPHOLOGY 
133 
 
Reduplicated adverbs may be separated by the negative particle na 
to express indefiniteness: kBaI na kBaI kabhi: na kabhi: ‘sometime or 
other.’

The particle hI hi: is generally used for emphasis and also in the 
sense of ‘exclusiveness’ or ‘alone.’ As indicated above, the particle 
hI hi: can be used as an emphatic marker with nouns. It can also be 
used with different types of pronouns in both the direct and the 
oblique cases: maOM hI m´~ hi: ‘I myself,’ tU hI tu: hi: ‘thou thyself,’ Aap hI 
a:p hi: ‘you yourself,’ kao[- hI koi: hi: ‘hardly anyone,’ kuC hI kuch hi: 
‘hardly anything,’ ‘hardly a few.’

Adding the emphatic particle hI hi: to certain words results in certain 
phonological changes.

tba tab + hI hi: = tBaI tabhi:

When hI hi: is preceded by pronouns in the oblique case, such as [sa 
is, ]sa us, iksa kis, and ijasa jis, the h h is elided. 
 
(b)

In certain cases, exclusiveness is dropped in the preceding word and 
the final vowel is nasalized. 
 
yahaÐ yahã: + hI hi: = yahIM yahĩ: 
at this very place 
jahaÐ jahã: + hI hi: = hI jahIM jahĩ: 
wherever 
vahaÐ vahã: + hI hi: = vahIM vahĩ: 
at that very place 
khaÐ kahã: + hI hi: = khIM kahĩ: 
somewhere 
 
The emphatic particle hI hi: is frequently used with different types of 
pronouns. Its use with reflexive pronouns is quite interesting. Hindi 
has only four reflexive pronouns: Aap a:p, its oblique forms Apnaa 
apna: and Apnao apne, and a compound of these two Apnao Aap apne-a:p 
‘by oneself’; Aapsa a:pas meaning ‘each other,’ or ‘one another.’ 
When Aap a:p is followed by hI hi:, it has an adjectival intensifying 
force and qualifies a noun or a pronoun which, as a rule, is the 
logical subject of the sentences.

meaning of ‘just.’ In (14b), the particle hI hi: adds the meaning

different shades of meaning depending on its use.

To sum up, the use of various particles in Hindi is important from a 
semantic point of view. Besides their use as emphatic markers, they 
cover a wide range of meanings and further shades of meanings 
when used in combination with various word classes. They are 
frequently used in different dialects and styles of speech in Hindi.

3.8. Interjections 
 
Interjections express some emotions such as pain, pleasure, anger, 
surprise, and disgust. An interjection is in the vocative case and has 
no grammatical relation with any other word in the sentence. In 
Hindi,   interjections are used as independent words or they can be 
prefixed to nouns.

4. Syntax 
 
4.1. Structure of Phrases 
 
4.1.1. Noun Phrase 
 
A noun phrase is defined as a nominal head preceded by one or 
more modifiers. It also serves as a nucleus of a postpositional 
phrase. It may function as a subject or object (indirect or direct) 
predicative complement or as a direct object of a postposition. A 
noun or a pronoun can be the minimum constituent of a noun phrase. 
A nominal may be modified by a variety of modifiers such as 
adjectives, quantifiers, numerals, emphatic markers, limiters and 
comparative, equative, and superlative markers. 
 
Attributive adjectives immediately precede a nominal head as a 
modifier, e.g., nayaa kaoT naya: kot ‘new coat’ and sauMdr laD,kI sundar larki: 
‘beautiful girl.’ Possessive adjectives precede the head noun as 
modifiers in noun phrases. They may or may not also be preceded 
by an appropriate form of the genitive postposition ka ka:/ ko ke/ kI 
ki: agreeing in gender and number with the object noun. 
 
1. 
AjaIt ka baD,a baoTa Aayaa. 
 
aji:t ka: bara: beta: a:ya:. 
 
Ajit-gen-ms elder son came 
 
Ajit’s elder son came. 
 
2. 
AjaIt ko dao ima~ Aae. 
 
aji:t ke do mitr a:ye 
 
Ajit-gen-mpl two friends came 
 
Ajit’s two friends came. 
 
3. 
maaohna kI CaoTI baoTI sauMdr hO. 
 
mohan ki: choti: beti: sundar h´..

Mohan-gen-fpl small daughters 
go-prog are 
 
Mohan’s younger daughters are going. 

4. SYNTAX 
166 
 
 
There is no distinct category of articles used in Hindi. The concept 
of definiteness and indefiniteness is expressed indirectly by means 
of pronouns, and the numeral ek ek ‘one.’ 
 
5. 
kao[- ek laD,ka 
 
koi:/ek larka: 
 
some /a/one boy 
 
6. 
yah/vah baccaa 
 
yah/vah bacca: 
 
this/that child 
 
The numeral ek ek and the indefinite pronoun kao[- koi: ‘some(one)’ 
are used in place of an indefinite article. A definite determiner 
involves either a demonstrative/personal pronoun or a zero marking 
as given in (6). It is only the context which disambiguates the 
potential ambiguity present in the above two sentences. 
 
Besides determiners, a noun may be preceded by quantifiers and 
numerals in the form of (i) approximate/ordinal (e.g., lagaBaga lagbhag 
‘about,’ krIba kari:b ‘almost,’ kovala keval ‘only,’ phlaa pahla: ‘first’, dUsara 
du:sra: ‘second’, tIsara ti:sra: ‘third’, caaOqaa cautha: ‘fourth’), (ii) 
cardinal/ multiplicative/fraction (e.g., ek ek ‘one,’ dao do ‘two,’ duganaa 
dugna: ‘twice,’ itganaa tigna: ‘three-fold,’ AaQaa a:dha: ‘half’, tIsara Baaga 
ti:sra: bha:g/ ihsaa hisa: ‘one-third’, caaOqaa Baaga cøtha: bha:g/ihsaa hisa: 
‘one-fourth,’), and (iii) collective/measure (e.g., jaaoD,I jori: ‘pair’, dja-na 
darjan ‘dozen,’ iklaao kilo ‘kilogram,’ AaQaa iklaao a:dha: kilo ‘half a 
kilogram’).

Notice that quantifiers such as saaro sa:re/ tmaama tama:m ‘all’ follow a 
head noun when the head noun is a pronoun. 
 
13.

Limiters such as isaf- sirf/ kovala keval/ ‘only’ precede the head noun, 
whereas emphatic particles -hI -hi: ‘only’ and BaI bhi: ‘also’ follow 
the head noun. 
 
15.

Comparative, superlative and equative structures are formed by 
adding certain morphological forms after the head noun. The 
comparatives are formed by adding se after adding the ablative case 
markers to the genitive forms of the head noun. 
 
18.

number. 
 
22.

There are certain co-occurrence restrictions. Indefinite determiners 
do not co-occur with ordinals. Similarly, the multiplicatives do not 
co-occur with collective or measure quantifiers. There are other 
usage constraints on modifiers. For example, the combination of 
indefinite determiners and cardinal quantifiers is possible; the 
combination of an indefinite determiner and a demonstrative 
pronoun in not allowed.

Notice that the presence of a postposition changes all the elements 
of the compound noun phrase from direct to oblique by adding the 
oblique case markers. 
 
There are a limited number of compound postpositions used in Hindi 
such as Aagao a:ge/ pICo kI Aaor pi:che ki: or ‘in front/back of’, and da[-M 
da:ĩ:/ baa[-M Aaor ba:ĩ: or ‘towards right/left’. All these are directional. 
The first element indicates the direction, and is followed by the 
postpositional form kI Aaor ki: or ‘toward’. They are always used after 
the oblique noun. Notice that a free postposition without an 
argument functions as an adverb. 
 
It is possible to modify postpositions by using a limiter tk tak ‘up 
to/till,’ or a particle hI hi: ‘only.’ 
 
8. 
vah Saama tk phuÐcaogaa. 
 
vah ša:m tak pahũcega:.

4.1.3. Adjectival Phrases 
 
Adjective phrases are of two types: simple and complex. Simple 
adjectives may also be divided into basic and derived adjectives. 
The derived adjectives are derived from other word classes such as 
nouns. The examples of basic adjectives are: AcCa accha: ‘good,’ laMbaa 
lamba: ‘long,’ saaf, sa:f ‘clean,’ etc. Derived adjectives are derived 
from nouns: 

4. SYNTAX 
174

work 
+ [- i: 
= maohnatI mehnati: hard worker 
ihmmat himmat courage

= ihmmatI himmati: courageous 
daZ,I da:rhi: beard 
+ vaalaa 
va:la:
= daZ,I vaalaa da:rhi: va:la: 
bearded 
 
Adjectives may also be derived from adverbs: 
 
pICo pi:che behind 
+ laa la:
= ipClaa pichla: last 
naja,dIk nazdi:k near + [- i 
 = naja,dIkI nazdi:ki: close one
 
The use of the forms of vaalaa va:la: and genitive markers ka ka:/ ko ke/ 
kI ki: are frequently employed in the derivation of adjectives. Their 
forms agree with the following noun in number and and gender as 
follows: 
 
Masculine     
Feminine 
Sg   
Pl

2. 
dUr ka irSatodar 
 
du:r ka: rišteda:r 
 
distance of relative

Complex adjectives are finite (full relative clauses) as well as non-
finite (participle used as adjectives). Adjectives usually precede the 
nouns they modify. 
 
It is difficult to define adjective phrases because adjectives are not 
distinguished morphologically from nouns. However, it is possible 
to distinguish an adjectival phrase from a noun phrase because: (1) 
the semantics of adjectives is quite distinct from that of nouns; (2) 
an adjective phrase functions as a modifier for a substantive; (3) 

4. SYNTAX 
175 
 
some adjectives are bound forms and their surface form is 
determined by the number and gender of a following noun. In nouns 
the gender is marked inherently; (4) adjectives usually precede a 
head noun and occur in the attributive position. The word order of 
adjectives with respect to other constituents of an adjective phrase is 
as follows: determiner - quantifier - adjective - noun. 
 
3. 
yao dao laMbaI kmaIja,oM 
 
ye do lambi: kami:zẽ 
 
these-f two long-fp shirts 
 
these two long shirts 
 
There are two types of adjectives: those which do not take a 
complement, and those which do take a complement. Adjectives like 
maOlaa m´la: dirty do not take a complement, whereas adjectives like 
tOyaar taya:r ready do take it. The latter type of adjectives with their 
complements occurs attributively. 
 
4.

Adjectives can be either stative (AcCa accha: good, sauMdr sundar 
beautiful) or non-stative (p`sanna prasann ‘happy’, naaraja, na:ra:z 
‘angry’). 
 
The adverbs of degree in their basic form can serve as modifiers of 
adjectives. 
 
5a. 
yah bahut baD,a/CaoTa poD, hO. 
 
yeh bahut bara:/chota: per h´.

intensification of meaning. 
 
5b. 
yah bahut hI baD,a/CaoTa poD, hO. 
 
yeh bahut hi: bara:/chota: per h´

4.1.4. Adverbial Phrases 
 
Phrasal adverbs are formed by adding a simple or a compound 
postposition to a noun.

Reduplicated adverbs may be separated by the negative particle na na 
as in the phrases kBaI na kBaI kabhi: na kabhi: ‘sometime or other’. This 
category of adverbials expresses indefiniteness.

Various case markers and postpositions are employed with a noun to 
render an adverbial reading, for example, savaoro savere ‘in the 
morning’, dIvaar pr di:va:r par ‘on the wall’, Gar sao ghar se ‘from the 
house’, and caakU sao ca:ku: se ‘with the knife’.

4.2. Structure of Clauses 
 
In this section major constituents of a sentence namely subordinate 
clauses, main clauses (or noun clauses), relative clauses, adverbial 
clauses are discussed. 
 
4.2.1. Subordinate Clauses 
 
Subordinate clauses are of two types: finite and non-finite. Finite 
clauses normally have the same sentence structure as main clauses. 
Sometimes they may precede the main clause due to the 
consideration of focus. Consider the following examples: 
 
Main clause 
1. 
vah Aaegaa. 
 
vah a:yega:. 
 
he come-fu 
 
He’ll come. 
 
Subordinate clause 
1a. 
mauJao AaSaa hO ik vah Aaegaa. 
 
mujhe a:ša: h´ ki vah a:yega:. 
 
I-obl hope that he come-fut 
 
I hope that he will come. 
 
1b. 
*ik vah Aaegaa mauJao AaSaa hO 
 
*ki vah a:yega: mujhe a:ša: h´ 
 
In case non-finite clause precedes the main clause due to the 
consideration of focus, the complimentizer is dropped and the 
element yah yeh this is added in the initial position of the main clause. 
 
1c. 
vah Aaegaa yah maorI AaSaa hO. 
 
vah a:yega:, yeh meri: a:ša: h´. 
 
he come-fut, this my hope is 
 
I hope that he will come. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
180 
 
Non-finite subordinate clauses are structurally quite distinct from the 
main clauses. They are marked by (i) verb modification, (ii) lack of 
agreement, and (iii) word order. The subordinate verb undergoes a 
process of verbal participation or infinitivization/gerundivization. 
The subordinate verb does not agree with subject and/or object in 
number and gender and is not marked for tense. 
 
Participle subordinate verb 
2. 
vah icallaato hue inaklaa. 
 
vah cilla:te hue nikla:. 
 
he shriek-ptc left 
 
He left shrieking. 
 
The infinitive subordinate clause with an adverbial phrase can be put 
in the initial position. 
 
3. 
maora vaaipsa Aanaa maumaikna nahIM. 
 
mera: va:pas a:na: mumkin nahĩ:. 
 
my return come-inf possible neg 
 
It is not possible for me to come back. 
 
4. 
maSaIna cala rhI qaI. 
 
maši:n cal rahi: thi:. 
 
machine move prog was 
 
The machine was working. 
 
4a. 
vah calatI maSaIna kao doK rha qaa. 
 
vah calti: maši:n (ko) dekh raha: tha:.

4.2.2. Noun Clauses 
 
Noun clauses are of two types: finite and non-finite. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
181 
 
4.2.2.1.  Finite Noun Clauses 
 
Finite noun clauses are introduced by the subordinator / 
complementizer ki that and follow the main clause verb. They 
function as subjects, direct objects, or complements of the main 
predicate. Finite subject clauses usually occur as subjects of 
adjectival predicates such as saca sac ‘true’, saaf, sa:f/ spYT spašt ‘clear’, 
and maumaikna mumkin/ saMBava sambhav ‘possible’. 
 
1. 
yah saca hO ik maaohna baImaar hO. 
 
yeh sac h´ ki mohan bi:ma:r h´. 
 
it true is that Mohan sick is 
 
It is true that Mohan is sick. 
 
1a. 
yah saaf, / spYT qaa ik maaohna baImaar qaa. 
 
yeh sa:f/spašt tha: ki mohan bi:ma:r tha:. 
 
it clear was that Mohan sick was 
 
It was clear that Mohan was sick. 
 
4.2.2.1.1. The ik ki Complement Clauses 
 
ki that complement clauses are usually governed by verbs like jaananaa 
ja:nna: ‘to know’, pta haonaa pata: hona: ‘to know’, khnaa kahna: ‘to 
say’, doKnaa dekhna: ‘to see’, and laganaa lagna: ‘to appear/seem’. 
Consider the following examples. 
 
2. 
maOM jaanata qaa ik baf,- igarogaI. 
 
m´~ ja:nta: tha: ki barf giregi:. 
 
I know-ptc was that snow fall-fut 
 
I knew that it would snow. 
 
3. 
mauJao lagaa ik vah baImaar hO. 
 
mujhe laga: ki vah bi:ma:r h´. 
 
I-obl felt that he sick is 
 
It seemed to me that he was sick. 
 
The verb caahnaa cahna: ‘to wish, desire’ in the matrix clause selects a 
conditional verb form in its complement clause. 

4. SYNTAX 
182 
 
 
4. 
maOM caahta hUÐ ik vah [imthana do. 
 
m´~ ca:hta: hũ: ki vah imtiha:n de. 
 
I desire-ptc am that he exam give 
 
I wish that he appears in examination. 
 
4.2.2.1.2. Direct and Indirect Speech 
 
Direct and indirect speech are not distinguished by the use of any 
syntactic device, such as a quotative marker or particle. However, 
both quoted and reported material may be preceded by the 
complementizer ik ki that which is subordinate to the higher verb of 
communication in the matrix sentence, such as kh kah- ‘say’, pUC 
pu:ch- ‘ask’, ilaK likh- ‘write’, sauna sun- ‘hear’, saaoca soc ‘think’, caah ca:h 
‘desire/want’. 
 
5. 
]sanao kha ik dvaa K,rIdao. 
 
usne kaha: ki dava: xari:do. 
 
he-erg said that medicine buy 
 
He said, buy medicine. 
 
6. 
}Yaa nao pUCa ik maOM @yaaoM gaaMÐva jaa}Ðgaa? 
 
u:ša: ne pu:cha: ki m´~ kyõ ga:ũ: ja:ũ:ga:? 
 
Usha-erg asked that I  why village go-fut 
 
Usha asked, why should I go to the village? 
 
7. 
maaohna nao ilaKa ik tuma yah iktaba pZ,ao. 
 
mohan ne likha: ki tum yah kita:b parho. 
 
Mohan-erg wrote that you this book read 
 
Mohan wrote, Read this book. 
 
8. 
hmanao saunaa ik vah Da^@Tr hO.. 
 
hamne suna: ki vah da:ktar h´. 
 
we-erg heard that he doctor is 
 
We heard that he is a doctor. 
 
9. 
maOMnao saaocaa ik vah nahIM Aaegaa. 
 
m´~ne soca: ki vah nahĩ: a:yega:. 
 
I-erg thought that he neg come-fut 
 
I thought that he would not come. 

4. SYNTAX 
183 
 
 
Verbs like sauna sun-, saaoca soc- are ‘hear/say’ type verbs, and they 
usually occur as higher verbs in reported speech. In sentences (7-9), 
the complementizer ik ki precedes quoted material and in sentences 
(10-11), it precedes the reported material. The complementizer is 
frequently omitted. In Hindi, direct speech is preferred to indirect 
speech. Sentence (12) may appear ambiguous. 
 
10. 
rama nao kha (ik) vah iktaba pZ,ogaa. 
 
ra:mne kaha: (ki) vah kita:b parhega:. 
 
Ram-erg said (that) he bookread-3s-fut 
 
(a) Ram(i) said, he(j) will read the book. 
 
(b) Ram(i) said that he(i) will read the book. 
 
In (a) Ram and the noun and pronoun are not co-referential, and in 
(b) they are. In this sentence, the first or direct speech reading is 
preferred to the second or indirect speech reading. Instead of using 
indirect speech, it would be more natural to use direct speech in the 
second meaning as in (11). 
 
11. 
rama nao kha (ik) maOM iktaba pZ,UÐgaa. 
 
ra:m ne kaha: (ki) m´~ kita:b parũ:ga: 
 
Ram-erg said (that) I book  read-1s-fut 
 
Ram said, I’ll read a book. 
 
Sometimes direct and indirect speech can be differentiated with the 
help of number and gender markers. For instance, the gender 
discrepancy between the matrix verb and the embedded verb may 
indicate an indirect quotation. 
 
12. 
rama nao kha (ik) maOM p~ ilaK rha hUÐ. 
 
ra:mne kaha: (ki) m´~ patr likh raha: hũ: 
 
Ram-erg said (that) I letter write-prog am 
 
Ram (i) said, I(i)m writing a letter. 
 
Ram (i) said that I (j) am writing a letter. 
 
12a. rama nao kha (ik) maOM p~ ilaK rhI hUÐ. 
 
ra:mne kaha: (ki) m´~ patr likh rahi: hũ: 
 
Ram-erg said (that) I letter write-prog.fs am 
 
Ram(i) said that I(j) am writing a letter. 
 
*Ram(i) said that I(i) am writing a letter. 

4. SYNTAX 
184 
 
 
In (12a) the auxiliary verb of the embedded sentence is feminine, 
therefore it cannot be co-referential with Ram. Whereas in (12), the 
verb of the embedded sentence is co-referential with the verb of the 
matrix sentence. Sentence (12) can be disambiguated by adding a 
reflexive pronoun svayaM svayam/ Apnao Aap apne a:p ‘self’. 
 
12b. rama nao kha (ik) maOM svayaM Apnao Aap p~ ilaK rha hUÐ. 
 
ra:m ne kaha: (ki) m´~ svayam/apne a:p patrlikh raha: hũ:. 
 
Ram-erg said (that) I self letter write-prog.ms am 
 
Ram (i) said, Im (i) writing a letter myself. 
 
Similarly, the nominalization of an embedded sentence may also 
result in a reported speech interpretation. 
 
13. 
rama nao maoro/Apnao Aap p~ ilaKnao ko baaro maoM kha. 
 
ra:m ne mere/apne a:p patr likhne ke ba:re mẽ kaha:. 
 
Ram-erg my/he-refl letter write-inf-obl about said 
 
Ram told about my/his writing the letter. 
 
Thus, there are no quotative markers to distinguish between direct 
and indirect speech. Direct speech is preferred over indirect speech. 
 
4.2.2.1.3. Non-finite Noun Clause 
 
A non-finite noun clause may consist of an infinitive (or gerundive) 
verb form. Infinitive gerundive forms can precede or follow the 
matrix clause and are inflected for case like other types of noun 
clauses. Non-finite noun clauses change the embedded verb into its 
infinitival form (stem + naa na:) which lacks subject - verb agreement 
and tense information. The infinitival form is like a derived noun 
which can take case markers and postpositions. The oblique form of 
the infinitival ends in -naa -na:. When changing finite noun clauses 
into nonfinite clauses, certain morphological markers like person, 
number, tense, aspectual suffixes are lost. 
 
Finite verb    
Infinitival form

4. SYNTAX

14c. kBaI doKa nahIM hO. 
 
(ve) parhẽge. 
 
(they) read-3p-fut 
 
They’ll read. 
 
Notice that -naa -na: is added to the verb stem in the formation of the 
infinitive form. 
 
15. 
maora pZ,naa ]sao psaMd nahIM Aayaa. 
 
mera: parhna: use pasand nahĩ: a:ya:. 
 
my read-inf he-dat like neg came 
 
He did not like me to read. 
 
16. 
mauJao pZ,naa psaMd hO. 
 
mujhe parhna: pasand h´. 
 
I-obl read-Inf like is 
 
I like to read. 
 
Noun clauses can function as subjects, direct objects, postpositional 
objects, and adverbials. 
 
Verbs are made non-finite by the processes of infinitivization and 
participialization. Infinitivizaton is the result of adding the suffix –naa 
-na: to the verbal stem. There are three groups of participial 
constructions: (i) present participle, (ii) past participle, and (iii) 
agentive participle. The present participle indicates ongoing action 
or process, the past participle indicates completed action or process, 
and the agentive participle indicates a habitual or potential action or 
process.

Notice that participial forms remain unaltered in the present and past 
participles. It is the auxiliary which takes person, gender, number, 
and tense markers. The participial forms agree with the following 
nouns in number and gender.

The word order of non-finite noun clauses remains unchanged. The 
focus-related movements to the left of the non-finite verb yield well-
formed sentences. Examples of various movements of non-finite 
noun clauses are given as follows: 
 
Leftward movements of indirect objects

4.2.3. Relative Clauses 
 
There are two types of relative clause constructions: finite and non-
finite participial relative clauses. The finite relative clauses maintain 
full sentence structures with subject verb agreement and are very 
common. Participial relative clauses exhibit the non-finite form of 
the verb. The former is more explicit than the latter. The former type 
is also labeled as the real relative clause. 
 
In the formation of finite relative clauses, the relative marker jaao jo 
‘who’, which is placed in front of the relativized element, the 
correlative marker vah vah ‘that’ is placed at the beginning of the 
head noun, and the second identical or co-referential noun phrase 
may be deleted. The forms of relative and correlative markers are 
given below.

The relative marker begins with a ja /j/ sound, whereas correlative 
markers begin with va / v/ and ] /u/ sounds. In the direct case, the 
noun is not followed by a postposition and when it is, it is in the 
oblique case. The relative and correlative markers change for the 
number and case of the noun. The forms are as follows.

In the examples given below, the symbol Ø indicates the presumed 
site of relativized and head NP prior to deletion. 
 
1. 
jaao laD,ka idllaI maoM rhta hO vah Ø maora Baa[- hO. 
 
jo larka: dilli mẽ rahta: h´ vah Ø mera: bha:i: h´. 
 
rel boy Delhi-loc live-ptc is cor -Ø my brother is 
 
The boy, who lives in Delhi, is my brother. 
 
Sentence (1) consists of two clauses which share an identical and co-
referential noun phrase. 
 
Main clause: 
 
laD,ka maora Baa[- hO. 
 
larka: mera: bha:i: h´. 
 
The boy is my brother. 

4. SYNTAX 
189 
 
 
Relative clause:  
 
laD,ka idllaI maoM rhta hOO. 
 
larka: dilli: mẽ rahta: h´. 
 
The boy lives in Delhi. 
 
Here the relative clause takes the relative pronoun jaao jo, whereas the 
correlative clause takes the correlative pronoun vah vah. When the 
relative clause precedes the main clause it results in the sentence 
(1a): 
 
1a. 
[jaao laD,ka idllaI maoM rhta hO] vah laD,ka maora Baa[- hO. 
 
[jo larka: dilli mẽ rahta: h´] vah larka: mera: bha:i: h´. 
 
The second occurrence of laD,ka larka: is deleted to yield sentence 
(1b). There are two other possibilities for relative clauses: (i) the 
relative clause may follow the head noun phrase (1b), and (ii) the 
relative clause may follow the correlative clause (1c). 
 
1b. 
vah laD,ka [jaao idllaI maoM rhta hO] maora Baa[- hO. 
 
vah larka: [jo dilli: mẽ rahta: h´] mera: bha:i: h´. 
 
1c. 
vah laD,ka maora Baa[- hO [jaao idllaI maoM rhta hO]. 
 
vah larka: mera: bha:i: h´ [jo dilli: mẽ rahta: h´]. 
 
Notice that the participial relative clause is formed by (i) deleting 
the relativized noun phrase, and (ii) changing the verb into a 
participial form by adding the suffix -ta -ta: for the present participle 
and -nao vaalaa -ne va:la: for the agentive participle. 
 
4.2.3.1. Restrictive and Non-restrictive Clauses 
 
The restrictive relative clauses allow three possible word orders as 
given above (1a-1c). The non-restrictive relative clauses are those 
where some extra but relevant information is provided about the 
antecedent head noun. They allow only one word order in which the 
additional information follows the head noun.

Born at Allahabad, Nehru was the first prime minister of 
India. 
 
The relative clause may precede or follow the head noun. The non-
restrictive relative clause always follows the head noun. In general, 
the participial relative clauses precede the head noun. 
 
The form of the relativized element in the relative clause 
corresponding to the head noun (i.e., the relativized element) is 
usually preserved in full when the relative clause precedes the main 
clause. Alternately, it is deleted. It is pronominalized when the head 
is a pronoun. 
 
5. 
vah [jaao maohnat krta hO ] ]nnait krta hO. 
 
vah [jo mehnat karta: h´ ] unnati: karta: h´.

nominalized. The antecedent noun phrase may undergo deletion too, 
as in sentence (6).

Who Delhi in stay is he boy my brother is 
 
The boy who lives in Delhi is my brother. 
 
The original position of the relativized element usually remains 
unchanged. In case the relative constituent is placed in the beginning 
of the clause, the effect is that of contrastive focus. 
 
7.

m´~ne vah lekh parha: [jo sarita: ne likha: h´]. 
 
I-erg that essay read which Sarita-erg write is 
 
I read the essay which was written by Salim. 
 
The place of the relativized direct object is usually in the preverbal 
position. The placement of the relativized object NP to the relative 
clause initial position indicates focus on the relativized NP. The 
relativized adverbials and indirect objects can undergo similar 
movement. 
 
7a.

The participialization, however, does not allow relativization of any 
constituent of a relative clause. 
 
The noun phrases in postpositional phrases can be relativized by the 
finite relativization strategy. The constituents within coordinate 
noun phrases can be relativized. 
 
28.

vah larka: [jo Ø mere bha:i: ka: dost h´] ca:la:k h´.

The boy who is a friend of my brother is clever. 
 
Elements within coordinate verb phrases and coordinate sentences 
can also be relativized. In (29) an element of the first conjunct of a 
coordinate verb phrase is conjoined. 
 
29. 
vah laoK [ jaao Ø maOMnao pZ,a AaOr p~ ilaKa] AcCa hO.

This sentence can be interpreted as the joining of two actions in 
which the first stimulates the second one. The two actions, thus 
joined, are not independent of each other. In (30) an element of the 
second conjunct of a coordinate verb phrase is relativized. 
 
30.

4. SYNTAX 
197 
 
This sentence can be interpreted as the joining of two actions in 
which the meaning after doing one thing the second one is done is 
implied. Therefore it appears like a participial construction. The 
preferred version will be (30a). 
 
30a. laoK pZ,kr jaao p~ maOMnao ilaKa vah AcCa hO. 
 
lekh parhkar jo patr m´~ne likha: vah accha: h´.

After reading the article, I wrote a good letter about it. 
 
The relativization of the first or second conjunct elements of a 
coordinate sentence result in ill-formed sentences. 
 
31. 
*vah laoK [ jaao maOMnao pZ,a AaOr maaohna nao p~ ilaKa] AcCa hO. 
 
*vah lekh jo m´~ne parha: ør mohan ne patr likha: accha: h´.

*m´~ne lekh parha: ør mohan ne jo patr likha: vah accha: h´. 
 
*I read the essay and the letter which Mohan wrote is good. 
 
The order of pre-sentential and post-sentential positions of relative 
with reference to a correlative clause, also yield well-formed 
sentences. 
 
32. 
[ jaao Ø maOMnao pZ,a AaOr p~ ilaKa] vah laoK AcCa hO. 
 
 [jo Ø m´~ne parha: ør patr likha:] vah lekh accha: h´.

The essay which I read, and wrote a letter about is good. 
 
32a. vah laoK AcCa hO [jaao Ø maOMnao pZ,a AaOr p~ ilaKa.] 
 
vah lekh accha: h´ [jo Ø m´~ne parha: ør patr likha:]. 
 
he write good is which I read and letter write 
 
That essay is good which I read and wrote a letter about. 
 
Notice that a conjunct intervening between a relative and a 
correlative clause is less preferred. Therefore, sentence (32a) more 
preferred than (32). The relativized element can be moved within the 
constituents and sometimes to the initial position for the 
consideration of focus. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
198 
 
Mostly the relative clauses favor the finite relativization strategy. 
The participilization strategy, which is non-finite in nature, is 
subject to various syntactic and semantic constraints as pointed out 
above. 
 
4.2.4. Adverbial Clauses 
 
Adverbial clauses are marked by (a) the finite form of the verb, or 
(b) the non-finite form of the verb. Finite adverbial clauses can be 
placed in pre-sentential as well as post-sentential position. The 
unmarked order of a nonfinite adverbial clause is at the pre-verbal or 
post-verbal position. There are time, manner, purpose, cause, 
condition, concession, and degree adverbial clauses. 
 
4.2.4.1. Adverbial Clauses of Time 
 
There are three kinds of the adverbial clauses: (a) finite clauses with 
relative clauses like time markers such as yaid yedi ‘if’, (b) participial 
(non-finite) adverbial constructions, and (c) the infinitival 
constructions. 
 
(a) Finite clauses with relative clause time markers 
 
Some of the adverbial markers in this category are jaba jab ‘when’, jaba 
sao jab se ‘since’, and jyaaoMhI jyõhi: ‘as soon as’. 
 
1. 
jaba vah Aaegaa maOMo BaI Aa}Ðgaa. 
 
jab vah a:yega: m´~ bhi: a:ũ:ga:. 
 
when he come-fut I too come-fut 
 
When he comes, I’ll come too. 
 
2. 
jaba maOM jaata hUÐ (tba) vah BaI jaata hO. 
 
jab m´~ ja:ta: hũ: (tab) vah bhi: ja:ta: h´. 
 
when I go-ptc am (then) he too go-ptc is 
 
When I go, (then) he goes too. 
 
3. 
jabasao vah yahaM Aayaa (tbasao) hma saaqa saaqa kama krto hOM. 
 
jabse vah yahã: a:ya: (tabse) ham sa:th-sa:th ka:m karte h´~. 
 
cor-from he came here rel-from we together work do-ptc are 
 
Weve worked together since he came here. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
199 
 
In sentences (2) and (3), time adverbial clauses are introduced by the 
markers jaba jab and jaba sao jab se respectively. Like relative clauses, 
they distinguish themselves from question words which begin with k 
k. The time clause contains a finite verb with tense aspect 
information. The time marker jaba jab denotes a sequence of events 
(2) and simultaneous events (3) respectively. It is important to note 
that the relative clause time markers jaba jab or jaba sao jab se do not 
undergo deletion as do the correlative markers tba tab and tba sao tab 
se. 
 
(b) Participial (non-finite) constructions 
 
Four participial constructions, present participle, past participle, 
absolutive and the as soon as participle, also act as time adverbials. 
The present and past participles agree in gender and number with the 
subject of the main clause, whereas the last two do not undergo any 
agreement changes.

(c) Infinitival construction 
 
A verbal noun followed by phlao pahle ‘before’, baad maoM ba:d mẽ ‘after’, 
or pr par ‘on’ results in a time adverbial. 
 
9. 
]sako Aanao sao phlao kao[- nahIM Aaegaa. 
 
uske a:ne se pahle koi: nahĩ: a:yega:. 
 
he-gen-obl come-inf-obl before none neg come-fut

4.2.4.2. Manner Clauses 
 
Manner 
clauses 
also 
employ 
relative-like 
and 
participial 
constructions. They are not expressed by infinitival or gerundive 
constructions. The relative clause-like manner markers jaOsao vaOsao j´se - 
v´se ‘as/which way’ indicates the manner reading.

4.2.4.3. Purpose Clauses 
 
Purpose clauses are formed in two ways: (a) infinitival form 
followed by e e or the oblique form plus the postposition ko ilae ke 
liye ‘for’, and (b) the @yaaoMik kyõki ‘because/ as’ clause modifying [sa 
ilae is liye ‘therefore’. 
 
18. 
vah naaTk doKnao gayaa. 
 
vah na:tak dekhne gaya:. 
 
he play see-inf-obl for 
 
He went to see a play. 
 
18a. vah naaTk doKnao ko ilae gayaa. 
 
vah na:tak dekhne ke liye gaya:. 
 
he play see-inf-obl for went 
 
He went to see a play. 
 
Notice that in (18) the oblique case marker e is added to the 
infinitive form of the verb, which expresses the meaning for. In 
(18a), the oblique case marker -e -e is added before the postposition 
ko ilae ke liye ‘for’. In the above construction, there is an option 
between the two alternatives. If the verb is not a motion verb the 
oblique form and postposition must be used. 
 
19. 
maOMnao ]sao iktaba pZ,nao ko ilae kha. 
 
m´~ne use kita:b parhne ke liye kaha:. 
 
I-erg he-dat book read-inf-obl for said

4.3.2.1. Direct Object 
 
Verbs are conventionally divided into intransitive and transitive on 
the basis of whether they take a noun phrase as an object. Transitive 

4. SYNTAX 
214 
 
verbs take noun phrases as their object and intransitive verbs do not. 
In certain cases, the objects are understood and they do not appear at 
the surface level. For example, see the use of the transitive verbs khnaa 
kahna: ‘to say’ and pUCnaa pu:chna: ‘to ask’ in sentences (16) and (17) 
below. 
 
16. 
maOMnao khI. 
 
m´~ne kahi:.

17. 
]sanao pUCa. 
 
usne pu:cha:. 
 
he-erg asked-fs 
 
He asked (it to) him/her. 
In (16), the verb khnaa kahna: is inflected for an implied generic 
feminine object. Similarly, in (17), the verb pUCnaa pu:chna: is 
inflected for an implied generic masculine object. These sentences 
can be completed as follows. 
 
16a. maOMnao ]sasao ApnaI baat khI. 
 
m´~ne usse apni: ba:t kahi:. 
 
I-erg him/her selfs matter-fs told-fs

usne ha:lca:l pu:cha:. 
 
he/she-erg welfare-ms asked-ms 
 
He/she asked (him/her) welfare. 
 
4.3.2.2. Indirect Object 
 
Whenever direct and indirect objects occur in a sentence, the 
indirect object receives the dative case markings. The order of the 
direct and indirect object in a sentence mainly depends on the 
emphasis given to these constituents in a given sentence. When 
animate indirect objects precede direct objects, they get extra 
emphasis. Notice the following examples of sentences using indirect 
objects in the dative case. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
215 
 
18.

than in (18a), (19a) and (20a). 
 
4.3.2.3. Other Types of Verb Argument 
 
Other types of verb arguments appear in the form of various 
postpositional phrases. They include locatives, instruments, 
benefactives, and comitatives. 
 
There are no restrictions regarding the number of arguments 
(subject, direct/indirect object, and optional arguments) put together 
in a sentence. There are, of course, certain semantic restrictions, 
including the selection of their cases (nominative, dative, and 
ergative subjects), imposed by the choice of verbs and tense. 

4. SYNTAX 
216 
 
 
In Hindi, the verb occurs in the final position. The unmarked word 
order is subject, indirect object, direct object, adverbial (time, 
locative), and verb. The direct object may occur before the indirect 
object depending on the emphasis given to it. Consider sentences 
(21)- (21c) below. 
 
21. 
maaohna nao pITr kao AjaIt ko ilae kla Gar pr iktaba dI. 
 
mohan ne pi:tar ko aji:t ke liye kal ghar par kita:b di:.

21c. maaohna nao kla pITr kao AjaIt ko ilae Gar pr iktaba dI.

In sentence (21), the direct object gets more emphasis than the 
indirect object. The order of emphasis is reversed in sentence (21a). 
Similarly, the adverbial phrase can also precede the direct or indirect 
object for emphasis. 
 
4.3.3. Negation 
 
4.3.3.1. Sentential Negation 
 
Sentential negation is expressed by the negative particles nahIM nahĩ: 
not, mat mat don’t, and na na no. The negative particle nahIM nahĩ: is 
added before the main verb, which may or may not be followed by 
an auxiliary verb. 
 
1. 
vah Aajakla dF,tr nahIM jaata hO. 
 
vah a:jkal daftar nahĩ: ja:ta: h´. 
 
he nowadays office neg go-ptc is

4.3.3.2. Constituent Negation 
 
A number of devices are employed to mark constituent negation. 
The main constituents are the stress and the use of a negative 
particle after the negated constituent. Sometimes stress is used to 
negate the constituent. 
 
5. 
]sao kla p%naI sao laD,naa nahIM caaihe qaa.

4.3.3.4. Negation and Coordination 
 
Negation occurs in coordinate structures as it does in simple 
sentences. The negative element is not moved to the co-ordinate 
position unless the identical element is deleted from the second 
negative conjunct. It is only in the na na … na na ‘neither … nor’ 
situation that negative elements are used sentence initially.

4.3.3.5. Negation and Subordination 
 
With predicates expressing opinion (pta haonaa pata: hona: ‘to know’, 
expectation/ intention (caahnaa ca:hna: ‘to want’), or perception (laganaa 
lagna: ‘to seem’ and ivacaar haonaa vica:r hona: ‘to have an opinion/to 
think’), the matrix verb can be negated to express subordinate 
negation. 
 
21.

mujhe pata: h´ ki vah nahĩ: a:yega:. 
 
I-obl know is that he neg come-fut

mera: vica:r h´ ki use vah nøkri: nahĩ: karni: ca:hiye. 
 
my opinion is that he-obl this job neg do-inf should 
 
In my opinion, he should not take this job. 
 
The negative particle nahIM nahĩ: can occur before the modal verbs pta 
haonaa pata: hona:, laganaa lagna: and caahnaa ca:hna: but not before ivacaar haonaa 
vica:r hona:. Thus, sentences (21-23) can be rephrased as (21a-23a) 
but not as (24a). 
 
21a. mauJao nahIM pta ik vah Aaegaa (ik nahIM). 
 
mujhe nahĩ: pata: ki vah a:yega: (ki nahĩ:).

4.3.4. Interrogative 
 
There are two types of interrogative sentences: yes-no questions and 
information questions using question-words. These questions are 
marked by certain intonation characteristics. 
 
4.3.4.1. Yes-No Questions 
 
On the basis of the expected answer, yes-no questions can be put 
into two categories: (a) neutral yes-no questions (where a definite 
answer is not expected) and (b) leading yes-no questions (where 
either an affirmative or a negative answer is expected). 
 
4.3.4.1.1. Neutral Yes-No Questions 
 
Neutral yes-no questions are formed by the optional placement of 
the question word @yaa kya: what in the sentence initial position of a 
declarative sentence. Note that the use of the question marker @yaa 
kya: in neutral questions is different from its use in the question-
word questions. In question-word questions, @yaa kya: usually occurs 
in the second position, and in yes-no questions it occurs only in the 
initial position. 
 
1. 
tuma kla idllaI jaaAaogao. 
 
tum kal   dilli:  ja:oge. 
 
you tomorrow Delhi go-fut tomorrow 
 
You will go to Delhi tomorrow. 
 
1a. 
(@yaa) tuma kla idllaI jaaAaogao? 
 
 (kya:) tum kal  dilli: ja:oge? 
 
 (Q-word) you tomorrow Delhi go 
 
Will you go to Delhi tomorrow? 

4. SYNTAX 
223 
 
1b. 
tuma @yaa kla idllaI jaaAaogao? 
 
tum kya: kal dilli: ja:oge? 
 
A declarative sentence can be converted to a neutral yes-no question 
without adding any question marker by raising the intonation at the 
end of the verb. 
 
A negative declarative sentence is changed to a yes-no question by 
adding the negative morpheme before the verb. 
 
2. 
tuma kla idllaI jaaAaogao. 
 
tum kal dilli: nahĩ: ja:oge. 
 
you tomorrow Delhi neg go-fut 
 
You won’t go to Delhi tomorrow. 
 
2a. 
(@yaa) tuma kla idllaI nahIM jaaAaogao? 
 
 (kya:) tum kal dilli: nahĩ: ja:oge? 
 
 (Q) you tomorrow Delhi neg go-fut 
 
Won’t you go to Delhi tomorrow? 
 
2b. 
tuma @yaa kla idllaI nahIM jaaAaogao? 
 
tum kya: kal dilli nahĩ: ja:oge? 
 
Aren’t you going to Delhi tomorrow? 
 
A negativized yes-no question invokes multiple answers. Consider 
the answers to questions (3) and (4): 
 
3. 
tuma yah if,lma nahIM doKaoogao? 
 
tum yah film nahĩ: dekhoge?

nahI¸M Aaja sadI- nahIM hO. 
 
nahĩ:, a:j sardi: nahĩ: h´. 
 
neg today cold neg is 
 
No, it isn’t cold today. 
 
In these examples, the (a-b) answers indicate positive-negative and 
the (c-d) indicate agreement-disagreement answering systems. The 
agreement-disagreement answering systems are less frequently used 
than the positive-negative ones. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
225 
 
4.3.4.1.2. Leading Questions 
 
Leading questions are formed by adding the repetitive form of the 
verb negative or positive question markers nahIM nahĩ: and haÐ hã: 
respectively at the end of a declarative sentence to serve as tag 
questions. The tag question comprising of the verb + naa na: is 
preceded by a positive proposition and the tag question of the verb + 
haÐ hã: is preceded by the negative proposition. 
 
The expectation of a positive answer is expressed by an affirmative 
proposition preceding the verb + naa na: as a tag question. 
 
5. 
Aaja gamaI- hO, hO naa? 
 
a:j  garmi: h´, h´ na:?

vah kita:b parhega:, parhega: na:? 
 
he book read-3s-fut read-3s-fut neg-q 
 
He will read a letter, won’t he? 
 
The expectation of a negative answer is expressed by a negative 
proposition preceding the verb + naa na: or the repetition of the verb 
form as a tag question. 
 
7. 
Aaja gamaI- nahIM hO, naa? 
 
a:j garmi: nahĩ: h´, na:? 
 
today hot neg is neg-q

vah patr nahĩ: parhega:, parhega:? 
 
he letter neg read-3s-fut read-3s-fut-q 
 
He won’t read a letter, will he? 
 
Note that the occurrence of certain negative polarity markers such as 
phlao  pahle, qaaoD,o thore ‘ever’ in the interrogative sentence also invoke 
a negative answer. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
226 
 
9. 
vah phlao/qaaoD,o kama krta hO? 
 
vah pahle/thore ka:m karta: h´? 
 
he ever work do-ptc.ms is 
 
Does he ever work? 
 
Alternative questions are formed by adding the expression ik nahIM ki 
nahĩ: ‘or not’ at the end of an interrogative yes-no question. 
 
10. 
tuma p~ ilaKaogao ik nahIM? 
 
tum patr likhoge ki nahĩ:? 
 
you letter write-3s or not

4.3.4.2. Question-Word Questions 
 
Interrogative sentences with wh- question words are referred to as k- 
k-questions in Hindi because question words begin with the k- k- 
sound. Question words always occur in the second position of 
interrogative sentences. The main question words are @yaa kya: what, 
kaOna køn ‘who’, khaÐ kahã: ‘where’, kOsaa k´sa: how, @yaaoM kyõ ‘why’, iktnaa 
kitna: ‘how much’, kba kab ‘when’ and ikQar kidhar ‘in what

what’ is used for transitive verbs and @yaa huAa kya: hua: ‘what 
happened’ is used for intransitive verbs. 
 
43f. Amar nao kla Apnao Gar @yaa ikyaa? 
 
amar ne kal apne ghar kya: kiya:? 
 
Amar-erg yesterday self-obl-home what did

In non-equational copular interrogative sentences, all the elements 
except the verb may be questioned. In examples (44-47) the subject, 
the accompanier, locative, and time adverbial have been questioned. 
The copular verb cannot be deleted as shown in in (44a-47a).

phrase or the predicate nominal can be questioned. The 
demonstrative pronoun used as a subject cannot be questioned.

Different constituents of subordinate clauses can be questioned. 
There are two types of subordinate clauses: finite and non-finite. As 
is the case with matrix sentences, all elements of these clauses can 
be questioned. Constituents, which undergo deletion in the process 
of non-finitization, however, cannot be questioned. This supports the 
argument that the question formation rule applies after the rules for 
non-finitization of the subordinate clauses take place.

No part of the juxtaposition phrase can be questioned. The 
questioning of the first element of a coordinate noun phrase results 
in the formation of ill-formed sentences as in (73b) and (75b). 
Similarly, in the coordinate verb phrases, the object of the first verb 
phrase cannot be questioned. 
 
There is no constraint on the number of constituents of a sentence 
that can be questioned at one time. The multiple question-word 
questions are normally used at the end of the narration of a story, 
especially a folk tale, for checking the comprehension of the 
listeners.

listing of persons, items, or events. Multi-question-word questions 
are used when information about different things is wanted all at the 
same time in one answer.

There is a flexibility as far as the placement of the questioned 
constituent is concerned. The movement of the questioned elements 
is related to their focus. Consider the following examples:

The question-word in the sentence initial position carries a stronger 
focus than when it is in the second position. In other words, it is 
marked by more stress in the sentence initial position than in other 
positions. Interrogative sentences (80) and (81) are in natural word 
order. In (80a) and (81a), the subject is stressed, in (80b) and (81b) 
the question words are stressed, and in (80c) and (81c) the verb is 
stressed. The interrogative sentences (80c) and (81c) do not 
necessarily invoke an answer.

Usually the question-word @yaaoM kyõ why occurs in the pre-verbal 
position. It follows the verb within the sentence. The movement of 
this question- word influences the meaning of the sentence. The 
placement of this question word in the post-verbal position is 
possible, but it does not necessarily invoke an answer.

There are two types of echo-questions: (a) yes-no echo-questions, 
and (b) question-word echo-questions. 
 
4.3.4.3.1. Yes-No Echo-Questions 
 
A yes-no echo-question usually repeats one or more elements of the 
statement uttered by the previous speaker. The element/elements 
chosen for clarification is/are retained with a rising intonation and 
other elements are deleted. For example, the response to a statement 
made in (83) can be in different forms (83a-83e) in yes-no echo-
questions.

Mohan will go to market tomorrow. 
 
83a. maaohna kla baaja,ar jaaegaa? 
 
mohan kal ba:za:r ja:yega:? 
 
Will Mohan go to market tomorrow? 
 
83b. baaja,ar jaaegaa?

Will (Mohan) go to market? 
 
83c. maaohna kla jaaegaa?

83d. maaohna jaaegaa? 
 
mohan ja:yega:? 
 
Will Mohan go (to the market tomorrow)? 
 
83e. maaohna? 
 
mohan? 
 
 (Will) Mohan (go to market tomorrow)? 
 
The yes-no echo-questions may be preceded by the term accha: ‘it is 
so’. 
 
84. 
vah kla idllaI sao Aaegaa? 
 
vah kal dilli: se a:yega:. 
 
he tomorrow Delhi-abl from come-fut 
 
He will come from Delhi tomorrow. 
 
84a. AcCa¸ vah kla idllaI sao Aaegaa? 
 
accha:, vah kal dilli: se a:yega:? 
 
Is it so that he’ll come from Delhi tomorrow? 
 
Using the same intonational patterns as in yes-no questions echoing 
a statement, yes-no question echo-questions are formed either by 
asking the previous speaker whether he/she asked the question or by 
replacing the constituent under focus. Yes-no questions are 
prompted by the previous speakers question and they do not merely 

4. SYNTAX 
248 
 
seek clarification of the previous speakers statement. 
 
85.

Did you read the book?

a:p pu:ch rahe h´~ (ki) m´~ne kita:b parhi:? 
 
You are asking if I read the book? 
 
The focused constituent receives stress if the speaker chooses to 
retain unfocused elements. 
 
4.3.4.3.2. Question-Word Echo-Questions 
 
A question-word may also be used in echo questions and elements 
of the statement may be repeated depending on the clarification 
sought. 
 
86. 
vah p~ ilaK rha hO. 
 
vah patr likh raha: h´. 
 
he letter write-pr is 
 
He is writing a letter.

86b. @yaa? 
 
kya:?

86c. p~. 
 
patr 
 
(He is writing a) letter. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
249 
 
Question-word echo-questions are uttered with a slightly rising 
intonation at the end of the phrase or sentence in yes-no questions. It 
is not so in question-word questions. The questioner may also use 
the expected answer in his/her question with a rising intonation. 
 
86d. @yaa ilaK rha hO, p~? 
 
kya: likh raha: h´, patr? 
 
What is he writing, a letter? 
 
86e. haÐ haÐ, p~. 
 
hã: hã:, patr. 
 
Yes, a letter. 
 
In (86d), a pause (indicated by a comma) separates the two rising 
intonation patterns. A statement containing more than one 
constituent permits the use of more than one echo-question. 
 
87.

4.3.4.4. Answers 
 
Not all types of answers can be formally distinguished from other 
declarative statements. Answers to yes-no questions require the use 
of the agreement and disagreement markers haÐ hã ‘yes’ and nahIMM nahĩ: 
‘no’ respectively in the sentence initial position, which may be 
followed with certain honorific markers. Answers to question-word 
questions involve the stating of the constituent required by the 
question. The rest of the elements of the sentence are usually 
deleted. 
 
90. 
vah kba Aagara jaaegaa? 
 
vah kab a:gra: ja:yega:? 
 
When will he go to Agra? 
 
90a. prsaaoM jaaegaa. 
 
parsõ ja:yega:. 
 
 (He) will go day after tomorrow. 

4. SYNTAX 
251 
 
90b. prsaaoM. 
 
parsõ. 
 
Day after tomorrow. 
 
The minimum answers to a yes-no question include haÐ hã: ‘yes’, nahIMM 
nahĩ: ‘no’ Saayad ša:yad ‘perhaps’, maalaUma ma:lu:m/ pta nahIMM pata: nahĩ: ‘it 
is not known’. The short answers may optionally be followed by 
polite or honorific particles or terms. The polite particle jaI ji: can be 
added to both positive and negative short answers. It usually 
precedes the answers. In speech under the influence of Punjabi, it 
follows the affirmative or negative short answers. It is added to 
indicate politeness for any questioner older or younger than the 
respondent. Other formal honorific markers used are ijanaaba jina:b or 
saahba sa:hab ‘sir/madam’ for addressing people of all communities. 
The English honorific terms, sir and madam are also frequently used 
by the educated community.

91f. pta nahIM /maalaUma nahIM. 
 
pata:/ma:lu:m nahĩ:. 
 
I don’t know. 
 
The honorific terms ijanaaba jina:b and saahba sa:hab can also be added in 
the sentence initial position. 
 
91dd. ijanaaba / saahba @yaa pta? 
 
jina:b/sa:hab kya: pata:? 
 
Sir, who knows? 
 
91ee. ijanaaba / saahba @yaa pta? 
 
jina:b/sa:hab kya: pata:?

91ff. ijanaaba / saahba pta/maalaUma nahIM. 
 
jina:b/sa:hab pata:/ma:lu:m nahĩ:. 
 
Sir, I don’t know. 
 
The agreement or affirmative response is sometimes indicated 
merely by using the honorific terms ijanaaba jina:b and saahba sa:hab as in 
the following examples: 
 
92. 
vah caalaak nahIM hO? 
 
vah ca:la:k nahĩ: h´?

Isn’t he clever? 
 
92a. jaI /jaI hO/ haÐ¸ vah caalaak nahIM hO? 
 
ji:/ ji: h´/ hã:, jina:b/hã: sa:hab h´. 
 
Yes, he is. 
 
As shown above, answers to yes-no questions may be yes, or no, or 
other response terms or expressions. The positive and negative 
response particles haÐ hã: yes and nahIM anahĩ: no can be reduplicated for 

4. SYNTAX 
253 
 
emphasis. They may be followed by certain expressions for greater 
emphasis. 
 
93.

Won’t you come to Agra? 
 
94a. nahIM nahIMM, ibalkula nahIM. 
 
nahĩ: nahĩ:, bilkul nahĩ: 
 
no no absolutely not 
 
No, not at all. 
 
The expression ibalkula bilkul is followed by the negative marker. It is 
to be noted that affirmative and negative particles only are 
reduplicated, not other response terms and expressions. 
 
94b. *nahIM (nahIM), Saayad Saayad nahIM. 
 
*nahĩ: (nahĩ:) ša:yad ša:yad nahĩ:. 
 
94c. *nahIM (nahIM), @yaa pta @yaa pta. 
 
*nahĩ: (nahĩ:) kya: pata:, kya: pata: 
 
Answers to positive and negative leading questions are determined 
by the proposition underlying the question and not by the tag 
question.

4.3.5. Imperatives 
 
Imperative sentences are marked for number, gender, person, and 
degree of politeness. There are three types of imperative 
constructions: (a) unmarked or true imperatives, (b) prohibitive 
imperatives and (c) obligative imperatives. 
 
4.3.5.1. Unmarked or True Imperatives 
 
The unmarked imperative takes the second person subjects tU tu: 
‘you’ (non honorific intimate singular), tuma tum ‘you’ (non-
honorific/plural), and Aap a:p ‘you’ (honorific plural/singular). 
Notice that the honorific plural and the honorific singular forms are 
the same. The singular imperative consists of the verbal stem. 
Whereas the singular non-honorific form remains unchanged, the 
suffix -Aao -o is added to derive the plural non-honorific forms and 
the suffix – [e -iye is added to derive the singular/plural honorific 
forms. If the verb stems end in the vowels [- /i:/ or e /e/, the suffix – [-
ijae -i:jiye is added to the honorific singular and plural forms. The 
stem final vowels [- /i:/ and e /e/ are dropped before the imperative 
suffixes or the plural non-honorific -Aao -o and singular/plural 
honorific suffix – [-ijae -i:jiye are added.

K,bardar xabarda:r/saavaQaana sa:vadha:n ‘beware’. 
 
5. 
K,bardar / saavaQaana dor sao na Aanaa. 
 
xabarda:r/sa:vadha:n der se na a:na:.

4.3.5.3. Degrees of Imperatives 
 
The unmarked ordinary imperative is stronger than the polite 
imperative. The obligatives of compulsion are stronger than the 
obligatives of prescription and the polite imperatives. Certain 
devices are used to strengthen or weaken the force of the imperative. 
Intonation and tone play an important role in the degree of the 
imperative. A soft tone of persuasion weakens and a hard 
authoritative tone strengthens the degree of the imperative. 
 
Certain lexical items or phrases, such as kRpyaa krapaya: kindly kRpa 
kripa:/ maohrbaanaI krko meharba:ni: karke ‘after being kind’, and Bagavaana 
saavaQaana Kuda ko ilae bhagva:n/xuda: ke liye ‘for God’s sake’ are added to 
imperative sentences to add politeness. They weaken the imperative. 
 
6. 
kRpyaa Gar jaa[e. 
 
krapaya: ghar ja:yiye. 
 
kindly home go-pol-fut 
 
Kindly go home. 
 
7. 
kRpa / maohrbaanaI krko pOsao dIijae. 
 
krapa:/meharba:ni: karke p´se di:jiye. 
 
kindness do-cp money give-pol-fut 
 
Kindly give money. 
8. 
Bagavaana ko ilae samaya barbaad mat kIijae. 
 
bhagva:n ke liye samay barba:d mat ki:jiye. 
 
God-abl sake/for time waste neg do-pol-fut 
 
For Gods sake, don’t waste time. 
 
The vocative forms may also be used in the sentence initial position 
to strengthen and weaken the degree of imperative. The vocative 
forms are as follows.

Feminine

Oh brother, please read this newspaper. 
 
The vocatives may also be followed by derogative terms like pagala 
pa:gal ‘mad’, abusive terms like saalao sa:le ‘brother-in-law’, and sausaro 
susre ‘father-in-law’ or other derogative expressions of address. The 
use of such derogative terms and abusive kinship terms strengthen 
the imperative.

force. 
 
12. 
jaa jaa¸ sauna ilayaa. 
 
ja: ja:, sun liya:. 
 
go go listened 
 
Go, I have listened.

4.3.6. Anaphora 
 
Here we will discuss (i) the means of expressing anaphora and (ii) 
the domains of anaphora. Anaphora in Hindi may be personal 
pronouns, reflexives, zero pronouns (i.e., null elements PRO or pro) 
or quasi-pronouns. 
 
In a narrative text or natural discourse, deletion is a prominent 
device in expressing the anaphora, e.g., 
 
1. 
ek idna maOMnao ek baccao kao rasto pr raoto doKa¸ 
 
ek din m´~ne ek bacce ko ra:ste par rote hue dekha:, 
 
one day I-erg one child-dat road-obl on weep-ptc saw 
 
pUCa tuma kaOna haoÆ 
 
pu:cha: tum køn ho? 
 
asked you who are 
 
One day I saw a child crying on the road; I asked (him), 
 
Who are you? 
 
In the above example, the anaphoric subject and object (the child) 
become accessible by means of deletion or zero anaphora in the 
second sentence. They are recoverable from the first sentence. 
 
Since the verb agrees with the subject and/or object in gender, 
number, and person, depending on various kinds of constructions, 
the subject and object can be deleted. 
 
2. 
maaohna Co bajao Gar phuÐcaa¸ kpD,oo badlao AaOr Aayaa. 
 
Mohan che baje ghar pahũca:, kapre badle ør a:ya:. 
 
Mohan reached home six-abl hour clothes changed and came 
 
Mohan reached home at six oclock; (he) changed his clothes 
and he came here. 
 
Anaphoric elements are frequently in the third person, and they are 
often expressed by personal pronouns.

It is possible to have an anaphora between superordinate and 
subordinate clauses. Usually, subordinate clauses (except for subject 
complementation, relative clauses and if … then clauses) follow 
superordinate clauses. Deletion indicates anaphora between a 
superordinate and a following subordinate clause.

Anaphora between different sentences also uses the strategy of 
deletion and pronominalization. No other strategy is employed. 
 
4.3.7. Reflexives 
 
A reflexive pronoun occupies the same position within a clause as 
any other type of a pronoun. The only restriction is that the 
antecedent of a reflexive pronoun must be the subject of its clause. 
There is no other change except the selection of a dative case marker 
or a postposition in its use as an indirect object. Emphatic possessive 
pronouns do not require a co-referential antecedent. 
 
1. 
vah laD,kI ]sakI ApnaI baoTI hO. 
 
vah larki: uski: apni: beti: h´. 
 
that girl his emp/*refl 
 
That girl is his/her own. 
 
Emphatic pronouns are sometimes completely homophonous with 
possessive pronouns as in (2).

2. 
dulhna Apnao dUlho kao psaMd hO. 
 
dulhan apne du:lhe ko pasand h´. 
 
bride refl-obl bridegroom-dat like is 
 
The bride is liked by her bridegroom. 
 
Sentence (2) is not passive. The conjunct verb psaMd haonaa pasand hona: 
to like takes a dative subject. Sentence (2), using the emphatic 
pronoun, can be interpreted as follows: 
 
2a. 
dulhna ]sako Apnao dUlho kao psaMd hO. 
 
dulhan uske apne du:lhe ko pasand h´. 
 
bride her refl-obl bridegroom-dat like is 
 
The bride is liked by her own bridegroom. 
 
Reflexivity is expressed by the use of agentive reflexive pronouns. 
This term is used to distinguish between the possessive reflexive 
Apnaa apna: and non-possessive reflexive Apnao Aap apne a:p ‘self’. The 
reflexive Apnao Aap apne a:p represents the main reflexive pronoun, 
which when followed by a postposition, has the oblique form Apnao 
apne. It also functions as an emphatic pronoun as in (1). The 
emphatic form is also derived by adding the emphatic suffix -hIo -hi: 
to it. The result is Aap hIo a:p hi:. The reduplicated form Apnao Aap apne 
a:p also occurs as a reflexive. 
 
3. 
Aimat Aap/ Apnao Aap/ Aap hI yahaÐ Aayaa. 
 
amit a:p/apne a:p/a:p hi: yahã: a:ya:.

4. SYNTAX 
265 
 
 
Suman refl clothes iron do-ptc is 
 
Suman irons the clothes herself. 
 
There are no separate pronominal reflexive pronouns for each 
pronoun. The person information is obtained from the antecedent 
subject. 
 
7. 
Aimat nao Apnao ilae / Baa[- ko ilae jaUto KrIdo. 
 
amit ne apne liye/bha:i: ke liye ju:te: khari:de:. 
 
Amit-erg refl-obl for/brother for shoes bought 
 
Amit bought a pair of shoes for himself/his brother. 
 
Sentence (7) shows that a non co-referential object does not take a 
reflexive form, but selects a non-reflexive form. The reflexivization 
is also controlled by dative and ergative subjects. 
 
8. 
]maa kao Apnao Aap kama krnaa psaMd hO.

amit ne apne a:p din bhar a:ra:m kiya:. 
 
Amit-erg refl  day-whole rest did 
 
Amit rested the whole day. 
 
Examples (8-9) can be interpreted as emphatic reflexives as well. 
Reflexivization can allow backward movement as well. 
 
10. 
Apnao Aap Aimat nao Aarama ikyaa. 
 
apne a:p amit ne a:ra:m kiya:. 
 
refl Amit-erg rest did 
 
Amit rested himself. 
 
In possessive structures, the possible reflexive form Apnaa apna: ‘self’ 
is used in place of possessive pronouns such as the English my and 
your. When the possessive reflexive is used, the possessor is the 
same as the agent of the action or the subject. Apnaa apna: agrees with 
the following head NP in number and gender. Following are its 
forms:

The use of non-reflexive pronouns yield well-formed sentences 
provided the subject and possessive pronoun are not co-referential. 
 
17. 
vah (i) ]sakI (j) kmaIja, saI rha hO.

vah (i) unke (j) bacce parha: raha: h´. 
 
he their children teach-prog is 
 
He(i) is teaching their (j) children. 
 
Similar to nominative and ergative subjects, the dative subject also 
controls the possessive reflexive Apnaa apna:. The possessive 
structure also permits reduplicated reflexives. 
 
19. 
vao Apnaa Apnaa kama kr rho hOM. 
 
ve apna: apna: ka:m kar rahe h´~. 
 
they refl work do-prog are 
 
They are doing their respective jobs. 
 
The scope of reflexivity is usually restricted to the clause in which it 
is used. 
 
20.

mohan ne kaha: ki vah/*apne a:p samay par a:yega:.

mohan ne pu:cha: ki uski:/*apni: patni: kab a:yegi:. 
 
Mohan-erg asked that his/*refl wife when come-fut 
 
Mohan (i) asked when his (i) wife would come. 
 
Sentences (20) and (21) show that reflexivization does not go down 
into subordinate clauses. Notice that reflexivization does not always 
meet clausemate constraint, as shown in (22). 
 
22. 
Aimat maaohna kao Apnaa Sa~u maanata hO. 
 
amit mohan ko apna: šatru: ma:nta: h´. 
 
Amit Mohan-dat refl enemy  consider-ptc is 
 
Amit (i) considers Mohan (j) his (i,j) enemy. 

4. SYNTAX 
268 
 
Sentence (22) is ambiguous because the reflexive pronoun is co-
referential with the subject of the subordinate as well as with the 
subject of the subordinate clause. It has two readings. 
 
22a. Aimat (i) maanata hO [ik maaohna Aimat (j) ka Sa~u hO]. 
 
amit (i) ma:nta: h´ [ki mohan amit (i) ka: šatru: h´]. 
 
Amit consider-ptc is that Mohan Amit of enemy is 
 
Amit considers Mohan Amits enemy. 
 
22b. Aimat maanata hO [ik maaohna (i) maaohna (j) ka Sa~u hO]. 
 
amit ma:nta: h´ [ki mohan (i) mohan (i) ka: šatru: h´. 
 
Amit consier-prog that Mohan Mohans enemy is 
 
Amit considers Mohan Mohans enemy. 
 
Here, the reflexive pronoun cannot occur in (22a), but it can occur in 
sentence (22b) due to its clause boundaries. It shows that the finite 
subordinate clause becomes finite and is raised to the object position 
of the matrix sentence. 
 
Reflexive relations occur within nominalized clauses. 
 
23. 
]saka svayaM kao maarnaa zIk nahIM qaa. 
 
uska: svayam ko ma:rna: thi:kh nahĩ: tha:. 
 
his self kill-inf proper neg was 
 
His killing himself was not proper. 
 
Reflexive relations cannot exist within an ordinary noun phrase. It is 
possible to have reflexive antecedents under two conditions: (i) 
when the logical antecedent is deleted at the surface level and (ii) 
when the antecedent is either generic or contextually implied. 
 
(i) Deletion of an underlying antecedent

refl time waste do-inf good neg is 
 
It is not proper (for someone) to waste ones time. 
 
Notice that in (25) the generic antecedent someone is implied. 
 
4.3.8. Reciprocals 
 
The primary way of expressing a reciprocal relationship is the 
expression ek dUsaro kao ek du:sre ko ‘to one another’. It is the 
combination of the cardinal ek ek ‘one’ and the oblique case form of 
the ordinal dUsara du:sra: followed by kaoo ko. Reciprocals can also be 
formed with Aapsa maoM a:pas mẽ ‘mutual’. The scope of reciprocity is 
restricted to the clause. 
 
1. 
hmanao ek dUsaro ko saaqa baat kI. 
 
hamne ek du:sre ke sa:th ba:t ki:. 
 
we-erg one another-obl with talk did 
 
We talked to each other. 
 
2. 
]nhaoMnao ek dUsaro kI bahut sahayata kI. 
 
unhõne ek du:sre ki: bahut saha:yta: ki:. 
 
they-erg one another-obl very help did 
 
They helped each other very much. 
 
In these sentences, the scope of the reciprocal expression does not 
extend to the matrix subject. 
 
Reciprocals usually require an antecedent subject. They may be used 
as a direct object, an indirect object, an adverb, or a possessive 
adjective in different types of constructions. 
 
Direct object 
3. 
vao ek dUsaro sao k[- baar imalao.

It is possible to have reciprocal structures without antecedent, if the 
antecedent is understood either syntactically, as in the case of 
imperative constructions, or contextually.

4.3.9. Equatives 
 
Like comparatives, there are two types of equatives: (i) syntactic and 
(ii) phrasal. The former type is composed of two clauses called as 
[tnaa itna: ‘this much’ and ]tnaa utna: ‘that much’ clauses. The main 
difference between these clauses and the comparative clause is that 
in equative clauses, an equative adjective or adverb is used with the 
subject and the standard of comparison. A comparative sentence can 
be transformed into an equative sentence by the deletion of the 
negative particle. 
 
1. 
Ajaya ]tnaa caalaak hO ijatnaa ]saka Baa[- ³hO´. 
 
ajay utna: ca:la:k h´ jitna: uska: bha:i: (h´). 
 
Ajay that much-cor clever as much-rel his brother 
 
Ajay is as clever as his brother. 
 
Equative structures can also be formed by using the clause jaOsaa j´sa: 
as/which way and vaOsaa v´sa: like/that way. 
 
2. 
jaOsaa Ajaya caalaak hO¸ ]tnaa ]saka Baa[- ³BaI´hO. 
 
j´sa: ajay ca:la:k h´, utna: uska: bha:i: (bhi:) h´. 
 
as-rel Ajay clever is that much his brother (also) is 
 
Ajay is as clever as his brother. 
 
Phrasal type equatives are formed using adjectives such as barabar 
bara:bar/samaana sama:n ‘equal’, and jaOsaa j´sa: ‘like’. The forms agree 
with the standard of comparison in number and gender.

]maa Anau ko barabar laMbaI hOO. 
 
uma: anu ke bara:bar lambi: h´. 
 
Uma Anu-gen equal tall is 
 
Uma is as tall as Anu. 
 
Notice that a copular/equational sentence employs only the plural 
adjectival forms of ek jaOsao ek j´se/ek jaOsaI ek jaisi: that agree with the 
number and gender of the subject of comparison. 
 
9. 
Ajaya AaOr ivajaya ek jaOsao hI hOM.

Equative adjectives may be modified by adding the particle –hI -hi: 
to these forms: jaOsao hI j´se hi:, jaOsaI hI j´si: hi: ‘alike’. The particle –hI -
hi: is also added to singular forms for emphasis as well. 
 
11. 
ivajaya Ajaya jaOsaa hI hO.

It is possible to delete the identical elements in equative structures. 
Deletion is always forward and not backward. 
 
15. 
]maa ]tnaI laMbaI hO ijatnaI ³laMbaI´ Anau ³hO´. 
 
uma: utni: lambi: h´ jitni: (lambi:) anu (h´).

Correlative equatives are formed by syntactic strategy only. They 
are formed by using the correlative marker ]tnaa utna:. 
 
4.3.10. Comparison 
 
Comparison is usually expressed by sentential, phrasal, and 
morphological strategies. Two types of comparative structures are 
very common, phrasal comparative structures and non-phrasal ones. 
Both use postpositions followed by the standards of comparison. 
Sentential comparison is carried out by the use of two finite clauses 
introduced by the relative marker ]tnaa utna: ‘as much as’ and the 
correlative marker ijatnaa jitna: ‘that much’. 
 
1. 
vah ]tnaa saIQaa nahIM hOO [ijatnaa saIQaa ]saka Baa[- hO]. 
 
vah utna: si:dha: nahĩ: h´[jitna: si:dha: uska: bha:i: h´] 
 
he is not that-cor simple as much as-rel simple his brother is 
 
He is not as simple as his brother. 
 
The relative clause can be placed at the sentence initial position as 
well. 
 
1a. 
[ijatnaa saIQaa ]saka Baa[- hO] vah ]tnaa saIQaa nahIM hOO. 
[jitna: si:dha: uska: bha:i: h´] vah utna: si:dha: nahĩ: h´ 
 
2. 
vah ijatnaa pirEama krta hO ]tnaa pOsaa nahIM kmaata. 
 
vah jitna: parišram karta: h´ utna: p´sa: nahĩ: kama:ta: 
 
he as much hard work do-ptc is that much money earn-ptc neg 
is 
 
He doesn’t earn as much as he works. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
275 
 
The relative clause can follow the correlative clause. 
 
2a. 
vah ]tnaa pOsaa nahIM kmaata,¸ ijatnaa pirEama krta hO. 
 
vah utna: p´sa: nahĩ: kama:ta:, jitna: parišram karta: h´ 
 
Most of the morphological markers of comparison are borrowed 
from Perso-Arabic sources. They are not very productive in Hindi. 
 
3. 
]saka vahaÐ jaanaa baohtr rhogaa. 
 
uska: vahã: ja:na: behtar rahega: 
 
his there go-inf better remain-fut 
 
It is better for him to go there. 
 
4. 
yah ]sako ilae badtrIna baat hO. 
 
yah uske liye badtari:n ba:t h´. 
 
this is he-for worst matter is 
 
This is the worst thing for him. 
 
Phrasal comparison is expressed by a postposition associated with 
the standard of comparison. The postposition sao se is added to the 
standard of comparison. 
 
5. 
Aimat Anau sao laMbaa hO. 
 
amit anu: se lamba: h´. 
 
Amit Anu than tall is 
 
Amit is taller than Anu. 
 
6. 
Anau ]maa sao gaaorI hO. 
 
anu uma: se gori: h´. 
 
Anu Uma than fair-complexioned is 
 
Anu is more fair-complexioned than Anu. 
 
The phrasal comparison is also expressed by the use of the phrase ko 
maukabalao maoM ke muka:ble mẽ ‘in comparison with’ following the standard 
of comparison. 
 
7. 
ivajaya ko maukabalao maoM raja pZ,nao maoM kmaja,aor hO. 
 
vjay ke muka:ble mẽ ra:j parhne mẽ kamzor h´. 
 
Vijay-gen comarison in Raj studies-obl in weak is 
 
Raj is weak in his studies in comparison to Vijay. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
276 
 
8.

us larki: ke muka:ble mẽ yah larki: buddhima:n h´. 
 
that girl-gen comparison-obl in this girl wise is 
 
This girl is wiser than that girl. 
 
Adjectives used in a comparison can be modified by the adverb of 
degree AiQak adhik more. 
 
10. 
yah Gar ]sa Gar sao AiQak baD,a hOO. 
 
yeh ghar us ghar se adhik bara: h´.

that book this book comparison more good is 
 
That book is better than this one. 
 
When two sentences are joined, the identical elements in the second 
conjunct are usually deleted. Whereas forward deletion is possible, 
backward deletion is not. 
 
12. 
Aimat ]tnaa caalaak nahIM hO ijatnaa ³caalaak´ ]saka Baa[- hOOO. 
 
amit utna: ca:la:k nahĩ: h´ jitna: (ca:la:k) uska: bha:i: h´. 
 
Amit that much clever neg is as much (clever) his brother is

12a. *Aimat ]tnaa nahIM hO ijatnaa ]saka Baa[- caalaak hOOO. 
 
*amit utna: nahĩ: h´ jitna: uska: bha:i: ca:la:k h´ 
 
The deletion of the first occurrence of caalaak ca:la:k in sentence (12a) 
results in the sentence being grammatically incorrect. The relative 
correlative markers ijatnaa jitna: ]tnaa utna: cannot be deleted under 
any circumstance. 
 

4. SYNTAX 
277 
 
4.3.11. Superlatives 
 
Superlatives are usually expressed by substituting saba sao AiQak sab se 
adhik ‘most’, savaao-tma sarvotam ‘best’, or hr ek maoM sao har ek mẽ se ‘out of 
all’ for the standard of comparison. Superlative constructions are 
also formed by the use of kao[- dUsara koi: du:sra: ‘anyone else’ plus the 
negative particle. 
 
1. 
Aimat kxaa maoM saba sao AiQak bauiwmaana hOOO. 
 
amit kakša: mẽ sab se adhik buddhima:n h´. 
 
Amit class in out of all more wise is 
 
Amit is wisest of all in his class. 
 
2. 
]maa saba sao AiQak toja, daOD,tI hOOO. 
 
uma: sab se adhik tez dørti: h´. 
 
Uma out of all more fast run-pr is 
 
Uma runs faster than everyone else. 
 
3. 
ivajaya sao catur AaOr kao[- dUsara nahIM hOOO. 
 
vijay se catur ør koi: du:sra: nahĩ: h´. 
 
Vijay than clever anyone else neg is 
 
No one else is more clever than Vijay. 
 
Superlative constructions are also formed by substituting an 
adjective of comparison for saba sao AiQak sab se adhik.. It also serves as 
the standard of comparison. 
 
4. 
vah baD,I sao baD,I samasyaa AasanaI sao hla krta hOOO. 
 
vah bari: se bari: samasya: a:sa:ni: se hal karta: h´.

Notice that in these constructions, the first part of the phrase is put in 
the oblique case as it is followed by sao se. 
 

4. SYNTAX

4.3.12. Coordination 
 
Sentence coordination is marked mainly by the use of the 
conjunction morphemes AaOr ør ‘and’ yaa ya: ‘or’, and magar magar/pr 
par/ikMtu kintu ‘but’. 
 
1. 
maOM idllaI gayaa AaOr maora Baa[- Aagara ³gayaa´. 
 
m´~ dilli: gaya: aur mera: bha:i: agra: (gaya:). 
 
I Delhi went and my brother Agra went 
 
I went to Delhi and my brother went to Agra. 
 
2. 
saaohna maaohna ko Gar gayaa magar/ pr/ ikMtu maaohna 
 
sohan mohan ke ghar gaya: magar/par/kintu mohan 
 
Sohan Mohan gen home went but Mohan 
 
Gar pr nahIM qaa. 
 
ghar par nahĩ: tha:. 
 
home at neg was 
 
Sohan went to Mohans home, but Mohan was not there. 
 
The conjunction morpheme AaOr ør ‘and’ can be followed by another 
particle, BaI bhi: ‘also’. 
 
3. 
maaohna kla banaarsa jaaegaa AaOr saaohna BaI ³jaaegaa´. 
 
mohan kal bana:ras ja:yega: ør sohan bhi: (ja:yega:). 
 
Mohan tomorrow Banaras go-fut and Sohan also go-fut 
 
Mohan will go to Banaras tomorrow and Mohan will also go. 
 
The conjunction compound morphemes yaa ya: -yaa -ya: ‘either – or’ 
are also used in sentence conjunctions. 
 
4. 
yaa Aaja vaYaa- haogaI yaa ihmapat haogaa. 
 
ya: a:j varša: hogi: ya: himpa:t hoga:. 
 
either today rain fall-fut or snowfall be-fut 
 
Either it rains today or it will snow. 
 
Notice that the word order of the constituent sentences undergo a 
change when conjoined by the use of the conjunction morphemes yaa 
- yaa ya: - ya:. Sentence (4) is obtained by conjoining (4a) and (4b). 
 

4. SYNTAX 
279 
 
4a. 
Aaja vaYaa- haogaI. 
 
a:j varša: hogi:. 
 
It will rain today. 
 
4b. 
Aaja ihmapat haogaa. 
 
a:j himpa:t hoga:. 
 
It will snow today. 
 
And coordination is commonly expressed by the conjunction marker 
AaOr ør. It can join two or more sentences or phrases. This conjunction 
morpheme occurs before the last conjunct. 
 
5. 
SaIlaa iktaba pZ, rhI hO AaOr ]maa icaT\zI ilaK rhI hO.

Amar play-prog is Mohan songs listen-prog is and 
 
Saama TI vaI doK rha hO. 
 
ša:m ti:vi: dekh raha: h´. 
 
Sham TV see-prog is 
 
Amar is playing, Mohan is listening to songs, and Sham is 
watching television.

6a. 
*Amar Kola rha hO AaOr maaohna gaanao sauna rha hO¸ Saama TI vaI doK rha hOO. 
 
*amar khel raha: h´ ør mohan ga:ne sun raha: h´, ša:m ti:vi: 
dekh raha: h´. 
 
The misplacement of the coordination conjunction morpheme AaOr ør  
renders the sentences (5a) and (6a) ungrammatical. 
 
Coordination does not merely involve juxtaposition of two or more 
independent sentences. There are various syntactic and semantic 
constraints on the construction of coordinate structures. In general, 
coordinate sentences express contrast, cumulative effect, cause and 
effect, sequential action, and contingency. Again, the order of the 

4. SYNTAX 
280 
 
conjuncts is interchangeable if a coordinate sentence expresses 
contrast or cumulative effect. Consider the following examples of 
various types of coordinate structures as listed above. 
 
Contrast 
7.

Notice that sentences (7), (8), and (9) permit the reverse order of 
(7a), (8a), and (9a) respectively. In sentences (10), (11), (12), (13) 
and (14), the reverse order of the conjuncts results in ungrammatical 
sentences as shown above because of the constraints on cause and 

4. SYNTAX 
282 
 
effect, sequential action, and contingency the conjoined structures 
are marked for. The coordinate sentences (10-14) can be 
paraphrased to indicate that they are related with the subordination 
process as well. Consider the following sentences. 
 
10b. vah dvaa Kakr svasqa huAa. 
 
vah dava: kha:kar swasth hua:.

In the above sentences, cause and effect, sequential action, and 
contingency are expressed without using conjunction morphemes. 
The paraphrases indicate that the first conjuncts of the sentences 
represent the adverbial complements of the second conjuncts. 
 
Besides conjoining sentences, the coordinating conjunction marker 
ør can be used to coordinate nouns (subjects, direct and indirect 
objects), verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

The coordination of two noun phrases yields a plural noun phrase 
and therefore, verb agreement is affected. In the case of coordinate 
subjects, the verb takes a masculine plural concord, whereas, in the 
case of coordinate objects, the verb agrees with the nearest object.

In sentence coordination, as mentioned earlier, the conjunct marker 
AaOr ør occurs before the second or the last conjunct. The conjunct 
marker pr par precedes the second or subsequent coordinated 
sentences. Among the disjunctive markers, yaa ya: can precede the 
first as well as subsequent disjuncts.

4.3.12.1. Coordination and Accompaniment 
 
Accompaniment is expressed by the postposition saaqa sa:th with or in 
the company of. It can also be expressed by the conjunction 
morpheme AaOr ør and. 
 
33. 
saaohna AaOr maaohna Aae.

33a. saaohna maaohna ko saaqa Aayaa. 
 
sohan mohan ke sa:th a:ya: 
 
Sohan Mohan with came 
 
Sohan came with Mohan. 
 
Sentence (33) is an example of coordination, whereas sentence (33a) 
denotes accompaniment. Notice that the accompaniment uses a 
singular verb as in (33a). A single unit cannot be formed using 
accompaniment, but can be formed by using coordination. The term 
daonaaoM donõ ‘both’ can, therefore, be used with coordination, but not 
with accompaniment. 
 
33b. saaohna AaOr maaohna daonaaoM Aae. 
 
sohan ør mohan donõ a:ye. 
 
Sohan and Mohan both came 
 
Sohan and Mohan both came. 
 
33c. *saaohna maaohna ko saaqa Aayaa daonaaoM. 
 
*sohan mohan ke sa:th a:ya: donõ. 
 
The unity of the conjoined phrase cannot be distorted, and this unity 
is expressed only by coordination and not by accompaniment.
