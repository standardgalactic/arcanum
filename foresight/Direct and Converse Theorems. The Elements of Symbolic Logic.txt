Prefatory Note 
This book aims at 
explaining 
the 
logical 
relations 
between 
direct, 
converse, 
inverse and 
inverse 
converse theorems, and 
the 
concept 
of necessary 
and 
sufficient conditions. 
In the 
book some of the elements of set 
theory are explained in a form 
that is within the reach of the 
general reader. 
In contrast to 
the 
second edition, the 
third 
edition includes a chapter con-
taining introductory information 
on mathematical logic. The book 
is provided with a large number 
of 
problems and questions 
to 
help easy assimilation 
of 
the 
material.

PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION 
The preface given by the publishers o f the third Russian 
edition explains the scope o f this book and the persons 
for whom i t i s intended. 
The only alteration 
o f any importance made to the 
text 
in translation i s that the author used the word "connexion" 
to refer both to the abstract idea o f compounding s t a t e -
ments, and also to the p a r t i c u l a r operators V,—** , e t c . 
I 
have preferred to use the term "composition" for the 
abstract idea, and the term "connective" for the particu-
lar operators. 
The reader should be warned that the author's use o f 
the word "theorem" d i f f e r s greatly from modern usage; 
the 
author points this out in a footnote on p.26, but his 
discussion there i s not entirely c l e a r . 
The p o s i t i o n i s 
that a theorem nowadays i s usually taken to be any con-
sequence o f a given set o f axioms, and this implies that a 
theorem i s "true", that i s , i t i s a true statement about 
any system which s a t i s f i e s the axioms. 
However, to say o f 
a given proposition that i t i s a theorem i s meaningless, 
unless i t i s stated as well to what particular set o f 
axioms one i s referring. 
For example, the proposition 
"the sum o f the angles o f a triangle i s 180°" i s a 
theorem o f Euclidean geometry, but i s not a theorem o f 
the geometry on a sphere. 
In t h i s book, the author e s s e n t i a l l y defines a theorem 
to be any implication, that i s any proposition given in 
the form " i f . . . then 
" . 
The author states on p.26 
that in this he i s following normal (Russian) school prac-
t i c e .

INTRODUCTION 
The book "Direct and Converse Theorems" by the 
l a t e 
I s r a i l ' 
Solomonovich Gradshtein i s devoted t o an exami-
nation o f the l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n s between d i r e c t , converse, 
inverse and inverse converse theorems, o f which a c l e a r 
conception i s necessary, as i s well known, for the proper 
understanding o f mathematical proofs. 
The book i s i n -
tended for persons studying mathematics, above a l l 
for 
students at intermediate c o l l e g e s o f various types, 
but 
can also be useful for university students and teachers. 
This e d i t i o n o f Gradshtein's book i s the third t o date. 
The f i r s t e d i t i o n was published in 1936 and the second in 
1950. 
In the 1936 edition the book consisted o f two 
chapters, "Direct and converse theorems" (Chapter One) 
and "The elements o f symbolic l o g i c " (Chapter Two). 
This 
construction r e f l e c t e d the author's intention to explain 
the l o g i c a l r e l a t i o n s between d i r e c t , converse, e t c . 
theorems with the aid o f the very simple t o o l s o f 
mathematical 
l o g i c . 
In preparing the book f o r republica-
tion at the end o f 1950 the author altered his o b j e c t i v e 
and decided to construct the book e n t i r e l y on the basis 
o f the concepts " s e t " and "property". 
In accordance with 
this decision a l l material 
relating to symbolic l o g i c was 
removed from the book and in i t s place the exposition o f 
some o f the elements o f the mathematical theory o f sets 
was extended. 
Thus in the second edition 
Gradshtein's 
book was a revised and extended variant o f only the 
f i r s t 
chapter o f the 1936 e d i t i o n . 
In the preparation o f the third edition, the publishers 
xiii 

Direct and Converse Theorems 
xiv 
decided to reinstate the section devoted to the 
elements 
o f mathematical 
l o g i c . 
This was because the 
introduction 
o f the concepts and t o o l s o f mathematical 
l o g i c (in com-
bination with the use o f s e t - t h e o r e t i c methods) allows 
the essence o f the l o g i c a l relations between the mathe-
matical propositions analysed in the book to be explained 
more c l e a r l y . 
Moreover, i t should be borne in mind that 
the value o f mathematical 
l o g i c both for 
mathematicians 
and for technologists (and also f o r l i n g u i s t s ) has immen-
sely increased since the appearance o f the f i r s t 
edition 
and even during the period o f time which has elapsed 
since the second edition was published. 
At the 
present 
time,mathematical 
l o g i c i s arousing the interest o f s c i e n -
t i f i c and pedagogic c i r c l e s , o f the technical 
i n t e l l i -
gentsia, 
and o f students at u n i v e r s i t i e s and 
intermediate 
schools. 
At the same time,we are entirely lacking in 
l i t e r a t u r e on mathematical 
l o g i c designed for the 
general 
reader. 
The publication o f Gradshtein*s book allows us 
to f i l l this gap to a certain degree. 
This third edition o f "Direct and Converse Theorems" 
c o n s i s t s o f two chapters. 
The f i r s t chapter corresponds 
to the contents o f the second edition and 
the second 
chapter corresponds to the second chapter o f the 1936 
edition. 
The second chapter o f the present volume i s in 
fact an independent whole and may be read 
independently 
o f the f i r s t chapter. 
In the process o f editing the book 
several c o r r e c t i o n s and improvements were introduced 
into 
Gradshtein's text, 
these being mainly in the second chap-
ter. 
A s e r i e s o f supplements, 
moreover,had to be included 
in the book,again for the most part in the second chapter. 
A part o f these supplements was entered d i r e c t l y into the 
main text, 
the other part i s given in the form o f f o o t -
notes. 
The supplements were drawn up by the e d i t o r o f the book, 
B.V. Biryukov, and were examined by Prof, S.A. Yanovskii 

Introduction 
who made a number o f suggestions f o r t h e i r improvement; 
Prof. Yanovskii's suggestions were inserted while going 
to press. 
The publishers have not attempted to produce 
a book which i s comprehensive in form; 
the supplements 
are, in t h e i r nature, a necessary minimum. 
The Questions which Gradshtein considered, and the 
s t y l e o f h i s exposition, are a l l l e f t unchanged. 
The 
supplements that have been inserted are, 
in a l l cases, 
distinguished with the aid o f square brackets.

FROM THE FOREWORD TO THE FIRST EDITION 
. . . University entrance examinations show that the 
level o f mathematical training o f persons graduating from 
secondary schools i s being raised from year to year. 
Up 
to now, however, secondary schools have not always given 
their students adequate t h e o r e t i c a l grounding in the 
f i e l d o f mathematics. 
Examinations in u n i v e r s i t i e s and 
advanced i n s t i t u t e s o f technology, the results o f mathe-
matical olympiads and the d i f f i c u l t i e s experienced by 
students during courses in higher mathematics all 
t e s t i f y 
to this fact. 
The proofs o f various theorems are 
regard-
ed by students, 
in the majority o f cases, as something 
stated in a book, and, therefore, 
to be r e l i e d on com-
p l e t e l y . 
But the connexion between the theorems remains 
unexplained; 
the notion i s usually lacking that a c o l -
l e c t i o n o f theorems represents some system, which serves 
for the study o f some common mathematical e n t i t i e s . 
Also 
students' 
notions o f the following methods o f mathemati-
cal 
proof are tangled up: 
the method o f reductio ad 
absurdum, the r o l e o f such concepts as "all", 
"every", 
the fact that, in order t o invalidate some theorem or 
other, 
i t s u f f i c e s to state merely one case in which t h i s 
theorem does not hold, the generalization o f theorems and 
the concepts o f the method o f total mathematical 
induc-
tion and so forth. 
Educational l i t e r a t u r e on elementary 
mathematics pays too l i t t l e attention to a l l these ques-
tions. 
Some courses in higher mathematics are supplied 
with handbooks in which formulae and theorems from an 
elementary mathematics course are given. 
In these hand-
books the circumference o f a c i r c l e i s stated, the formu-
xvi 

Foreword to the First Edition 
xvii 
l a for sin 2 a 
i s given, and so on. 
But in none o f them 
i s i t stated what converse and inverse theorems are. 
At 
the same time, questions touching on the methods o f mathe-
matical proof give students a good deal o f trouble, 
e s -
p e c i a l l y during the f i r s t course. 
On passing on to high-
er mathematics students at once come across theorems and 
d e f i n i t i o n s which are a complex combination o f such words 
as "necessary and s u f f i c i e n t " , 
" a l l " , 
"any", 
"some", 
"there e x i s t s " , e t c 
and assimilate them with d i f f i c u l t y . 
This book aims at p a r t i a l l y 
f i l l i n g t h i s gap in educa-
tional l i t e r a t u r e . 
In essence i t i s devoted only to one 
Question - the question o f negation. 
With the question 
o f the negation o f a proposition are connected the i n t e r -
r e l a t i o n s o f the d i r e c t and converse and a l s o o f the 
d i r e c t and inverse theorems, the i n t e r - r e l a t i o n s 
o f n e c e s -
sary 
and s u f f i c i e n t 
conditions and the d e f i n i t i o n o f 
the locus o f a point. 
The f i r s t chapter o f the book i s 
devoted to a l l these questions. 
This part o f the book 
does not in fact present anything new to the student: 
in 
the f i r s t chapter I have merely t r i e d t o give a more 
complete elucidation o f questions which should be well 
known from a school course. 
However, I did not consider i t p o s s i b l e to r e s t r i c t the 
consideration merely to those questions which are already 
well known to the reader from school instruction. 
In the 
second chapter I have set myself the task o f explaining 
several questions o f mathematical 
l o g i c - a s c i e n c e which 
i s being developed now in connexion with the theory o f 
mathematical proof. 
At the present t i m e , i t i s already 
extremely d i f f i c u l t t o speak o f the structure o f a mathe-
matical proof without employing the elements at l e a s t o f 
s o - c a l l e d symbolic l o g i c . 
I draw the reader* s attention to the fact that the 
problems presented in the book are an essential part o f i t .

CHAPTER I 
DIRECT AND CONVERSE THEOREMS 
§ 1. Introduction. 
Theorems, Axioms and Definitions 
Anyone studying algebra and geometry has encountered 
therein propositions known as theorems. These propositions 
are o f very diverse character. 
Consider, f o r example, the 
theorem "the point o f contact o f two c i r c l e s l i e s on the 
straight l i n e j o i n i n g t h e i r centres". 
This theorem 
states how three points - the two centres and the point 
o f contact - are disposed given a certain d i s p o s i t i o n o f 
the c i r c l e s and (given the condition o f t h e i r contact. 
The theorem "the diagonals o f a rectangle are equal" 
states the equality o f the lengths o f two well-defined 
line-segments drawn within a rectangle. 
Prom algebra 
i t 
i s known that any two numbers o and b satisfy the equa-
tion (a -\- 
= a
2 -±-2ab -\- b
2. 
This theorem, and many 
other algebraic theorems, deals with the replacement o f 
some operations upon numbers, conducted in a certain 
order, by other operations performed in another order. 
The reader who i s studying elementary 
mathematics, 
e s p e c i a l l y geometry, w i l l c e r t a i n l y have n o t i c e d that a l l 
i t s theorems are derived successively by means o f stages 
o f reasoning, or, as i s said, by means o f l o g i c a l 
i n -
ference from some fundamental 
p r o p o s i t i o n s known as 
1 

Direct and converse theorems 
* The wording of these axioms is taken from "The Thirteen Books 
of Euclid's Elements" translation, with an introduction and 
commentary, by T.L. Heath, Cambridge, 1908, p.154. 
The first five of these axioms were called postulates by 
Euclid, the last five were called common notions. 
2 
axioms. 
Axioms are propositions that are assumed 
with-
out proof. 
As examples o f axioms I quote the axioms which are 
in 
the "Elements" 
o f Euclid*: 
"Let the f o l l o w i n g be postulated: 
1) To draw a straight l i n e from any point to any point. 
2) To produce a f i n i t e straight l i n e continuously in a 
straight l i n e , 
3) To describe a c i r c l e with any centre and 
distance, 
4) That a l l right angles are equal to one another. 
5) That, i f a straight l i n e f a l l i n g on two straight 
l i n e s make the i n t e r i o r angles l e s s than two right angles, 
the two straight l i n e s , 
i f produced i n d e f i n i t e l y , 
meet on 
that s i d e on which are the angles less than two r i g h t 
angles, 
6) Things which are equal to the same thing are 
a l s o 
equal to one another, 
7) I f equals be added to equals, 
the wholes are 
equal, 
8) I f equals be subtracted from equals, 
the remainders 
are 
equal, 
9) Things which c o i n c i d e with one another are equal 
t o 
one another, 
10) The whole i s greater than the p a r t , " 
It i s often said that axioms are " s e l f - e v i d e n t truths". 
For the reader, questions such as the following w i l l 
naturally arise: 
are axioms really s e l f - e v i d e n t ? why are 
certain propositions considered t o be axioms? and so on. 
However, the question o f the nature o f axioms goes beyond 

Direct and converse theorems 
3 
the scope o f t h i s book. 
For the reading o f this book 
the general idea o f an axiom which remains with the 
reader from a course o f elementary mathematics will 
suf-
f i c e . 
Besides theorems and axioms the reader has also en-
countered in mathematics p r o p o s i t i o n s known as d e f i n i t i o n s . 
In a d e f i n i t i o n are indicated those fundamental 
proper-
t i e s o f some mathematical entity (e, g, a c i r c l e , a d i f -
ference, 
logarithms) which distinguish i t from other 
e n t i t i e s . 
Besides these fundamental properties, 
this 
entity can a l s o have further properties which follow 
from 
the o r i g i n a l ones and are indicated in theorems. 
Thus we have a c l e a r picture o f a c i r c l e . 
However, the 
properties o f c i r c l e s are not open to r i g i d s c i e n t i f i c 
analysis s o l e l y on the basis o f t h i s picture. 
In order 
to study c i r c l e s i t i s necessary t o indicate the funda-
mental properties o f these curves which distinguish them 
from a s e r i e s o f other curves. 
The proposition which 
f i x e s the basic property o f a c i r c l e i s known as 
i t s 
d e f i n i t i o n . 
A well known d e f i n i t i o n o f a c i r c l e runs: 
a 
c i r c l e i s a plane closed curve 
(or better: 
the locus o f 
the points o f a plane - this concept will be discussed 
below) a l l the points o f which are equidistant from one 
(given) point. 
The d e f i n i t i o n o f a c i r c l e given (depending on the 
axioms and d e f i n i t i o n s o f other e n t i t i e s ) enables us to 
establish p r e c i s e l y i t s other p r o p e r t i e s , and also the 
properties o f various l i n e s connected with the c i r c l e in 
some way. 
Thus even in very ancient times the r a t i o o f 
the length o f a c i r c l e to i t s diameter was obtained f a i r l y 
accurately in experimental fashion. 
In some countries 
this r a t i o was taken as 3.14 and in others as 3-16- 
How-
ever, the search for the law which enables this ratio to 
be defined with any degree o f accuracy and the study o f 
the properties o f t h i s r a t i o succeeded only after 
the 

Direct and converse theorems 
4 
construction o f geometry on the basis o f axioms, d e f i -
n i t i o n s and rigorous deductions 
( p r o o f s ) . 
§ 2. Theorems 
From an investigation o f the properties o f various 
mathematical e n t i t i e s 
( e . g . l i n e s , surfaces and s o l i d s 
in geometry; 
sums, products, powers and so on in a r i t h -
metic and algebra) we reach certain conclusions. 
These 
conclusions deduced from axioms and d e f i n i t i o n s 
are 
generally formulated in the form o f p r o p o s i t i o n s known 
as theorems. 
In a theorem there must be clearly 
indicated: 
firstly, 
under what conditions 
certain 
entities 
are considered 
in 
it 
and, secondly, 
what is asserted 
about these 
entities. 
For instance, 
in the elementary geometric theorem "in any 
triangle equal sides subtend equal angles" the angles o f 
a triangle are considered under the condition that the 
sides l y i n g opposite to them are equal; 
the theorem 
asserts that these angles are equal. 
I t i s often rather 
d i f f i c u l t to separate the entity from the conditions 
under which i t i s considered in the theorem because 
these 
conditions 
are often 
included 
in the very naming of 
the 
entity. 
Thus, in the theorem mentioned above, the 
entity 
under investigation and the conditions under which i t 
i s 
considered can also be indicated in a d i f f e r e n t way. 
As 
the entity about which we are talking we may consider the 
angles, these angles being considered under the 
following 
conditions: 
1) they l i e in one and the same triangle, 
2) they l i e opposite equal sides o f t h i s triangle. 
I t 
i s 
s t i l l better to examine the relativeness o f the concepts 
o f the entity which i s considered in the theorem, and the 
conditions under which t h i s entity i s considered, in the 
following example: 
"the diagonals o f a rhombus, are 
mutually perpendicular". 
In this theorem the diagonals 
o f a rhombus are the entity under consideration. 
The 

Direct and converse theorems 
conditions in t h i s theorem are, as i t were, absent. 
In 
r e a l i t y these c o n d i t i o n s are included in the word 
"rhombus": 
the diagonals in the theorem are considered 
under the condition that they belong to a rhombus and not 
t o any other polygon. 
In order to distinguish 
readily 
between the conditions under which the e n t i t i e s are con-
sidered and the fact that i s asserted about the entity o f 
the theorem, 
it 
is often formulated 
in the form of a con-
ditional 
proposition 
having the form "if 
. . . . . . . 
then . . . 
. . . " 
Its 
first 
part, 
starting 
with the word 
"if'is 
known as the condition 
of the theorem; 
its 
second 
part, 
starting 
with the word "then" is known as its 
conclusion. 
In the condition o f the theorem are indicated those con-
d i t i o n s under which the assertion contained in the con-
clusion o f the theorem i s v a l i d . * 
" I f in a quadrilateral a l l the sides are equal, then 
i t s diagonals are mutually perpendicular". 
I t i s c l e a r 
that the conclusion o f the theorem (the diagonals o f the 
quadrilateral are mutually perpendicular) i s true pre-
c i s e l y (but not only) under the condition o f the equality 
o f the sides o f t h i s 
quadrilateral. 
Any theorem may be formulated in the form o f a con-
ditional proposition " i f 
, , then 
" . 
For 
example, the theorem "in i s o s c e l e s triangles, the angles 
at the base are equal t o one another" 
can be formulated 
thus: 
" i f a t r i a n g l e i s i s o s c e l e s , then the angles at 
the base are equal t o one another". 
Often, however, 
owing t o the r e l a t i v e n e s s o f the concept o f , t h e 
entity 
and the conditions under which i t i s considered, such a 
formulation may be performed in d i f f e r e n t ways. 
For i n -
stance, the theorem "the diagonals o f a rhombus are 
* The conclusion of the theorem can sometimes also be valid 
under other conditions or in the presence of only part of 
the given conditions. 
See the end of this paragraph and § 7.

mutually perpendicular" permits the following formula-
tions in the form o f a conditional proposition: 
1) " i l

The System of Theorems 
The Study of Mathematical entities. 
Each theorem by 
i t s e l f establishes that the mathematical 
entity being 
studied ( o r a set o f e n t i t i e s ) has some property. 
But 
in studying mathematical entities 
not just 
so many 
separate 
theorems but the entire 
set 
of them - a system 
of theorems - is important. 
This fact emerges c l e a r l y 
in geometry. 
The system o f geometric theorems gives us 
an idea o f the properties o f the various figures and also 
the lines and surfaces constituting a part o f these 
figures or having some relation o r other to them. 
Thus 
we study f i r s t o f a l l some relationships between the 
angles and sides in a triangle, 
the conditions o f equality 
(congruence) and inequality o f triangles, 
and also the 
properties ( e . g . mutual d i s p o s i t i o n ) o f various lines in 
the triangle 
( b i s e c t o r s , medians e t c . ) 
After t h i s we 
pass on to the study of the various forms o f quadrilater-
als, then we study c i r c l e s and various l i n e s within and 
without them. 
The study o f more complex figures soon 
becomes a rather different problem*. 
We now consider in detail the study o f 
quadrilaterals. 
First o f a l l we study the general properties o f a l l quad-
r i l a t e r a l s on the basis o f the relationships between the 
parts o f a quadrilateral: 
the sides, the angles, 
etc. 
However, these properties are so few (the sum o f all 
the 
angles o f a quadrilateral i s studied as a special case o f 
the sum o f the angles o f a polygon) that the study o f 
quadrilaterals usually starts with the consideration o f 
one o f t h e i r special forms - quadrilaterals for which two 
opposite s i d e s are parallel - 
trapezia. 
This d i s t i n c t i o n i s formally fixed with the aid o f the 

Direct and converse theorems 
d e f i n i t i o n "a quadrilateral 
f o r which two opposite sides 
are p a r a l l e l i s known as a trapezium". 
I t happens that 
t h i s form o f quadrilateral 
has some special p r o p e r t i e s : 
1) the straight l i n e j o i n i n g the mid-points o f the non-
parallel sides o f the trapezium (the s o - c a l l e d median 
l i n e o f the trapezium) i s p a r a l l e l to the bases o f the 
trapezium and equal to their half-sum, 2) the area o f the 
trapezium i s equal to the half-sum o f the bases multiplied 
by the height. 
We r e s t r i c t 
s t i l l 
further the form o f the 
quadrilaterals 
on which the study i s based and we consider quadrilaterals 
for which opposite sides are parallel in pairs ( i . e . o f 
the form o f t r a p e z i a ) , - parallelograms. 
I t can be 
proved that in a parallelogram 1) opposite sides are 
equal, 2) opposite angles are equal, 3) the diagonals 
intersect, 
b i s e c t i n g each other, 4) the area o f a paral-
lelogram equals the product o f the base and the height. 
I t i s c l e a r that, in t h i s case, a parallelogram as a 
special form o f trapezium possesses a l l the p r o p e r t i e s o f 
a trapezium (prove t h i s in greater d e t a i l ! ) „ 
Prom a study o f the properties o f parallelograms we 
pass t o the study o f special types o f parallelogram - r e c -
tangles and rhombi. 
I t happens that f o r rectangles the 
diagonals are equal and that i t i s p o s s i b l e to circum-
s c r i b e a rectangle with a c i r c l e . 
For a rhombus the 
diagonals are mutually perpendicular and b i s e c t the angles 
o f the rhombus. 
Besides these s p e c i f i c properties a r e c -
tangle and a rhombus being each, in fact, a parallelogram, 
possess a l l the properties o f any parallelogram. 
Among rectangles can be distinguished a special type -
a square. 
A square i s not only a type o f rectangle but 
also a type o f rhombus. 
Therefore,a square possesses a l l 
the properties both o f a rectangle and o f a rhombus. Thus, 
the study o f quadrilaterals runs according t o scheme 1.

Problem 9. 
In a geometry text-book i t says "A rhombus

Should this sentence be amended? 
Thus theorems and e s p e c i a l l y systems o f theorems serve 
for the study o f sets o f e n t i t i e s , 
possessing certain 
properties. 
Mathematicians usually c a l l aggregates o f

§ 4. 
Sets and Properties 
We shall now dwell at some length upon the concept o f 
a set, which plays an extremely large r o l e in the whole 
o f mathematics. 
A set 
is specified 
(or what is 
the same thing, 
defined), 
if for any entity 
it 
is possible 
to say whether or not 
it 
belongs 
to this set. 
A very simple way of specifying 
a 
set 
consists 
of the enumeration of all 
the entities 
be-
longing to it; 
these entities 
are known as the 
elements 
of 
the set. 
Thus, for example, the set o f ciphers o f the 
Arabic system o f counting adopted by us consists o f the 
ten symbols in the following l i s t : 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
The symbol V i s not in t h i s l i s t , 
consequently the 
symbol V does not belong t o the set o f ciphers o f the 
Arabic system o f counting. 
The set o f l e t t e r s of the 
Russian alphabet c o n s i s t s o f the symbols in the 
following 
l i s t : 
a, 6, B, r, A , e, >K, 3 , H, ft, K, 
JI,

In mathematics we are largely concerned not with f i n i t e 
but with i n f i n i t e sets. 
Of this nature, f o r example,

if a property

which 
is possessed 
by all the elements 
belonging to the set A and 
which is not possessed 
by entities 
not belonging 
to set 
A. 
We shall denote s e t s by capital l e t t e r s o f the Latin alphabet,

and the properties o f these elements by the l e t t e r s o f the

Consider, f o r example, the i n f i n i t e sets mentioned above.

The s e t o f spheres 
c o n s i s t s o f the closed surfaces each o f which possesses 
the following property: 
a l l points o f the surface are 
equidistant 
from one point, known as the centre o f the

The d e f i n i t i o n o f i n f i n i t e sets presented above by way 
o f example (the set o f even numbers, the set o f squares, 
the set o f spheres) reduces e s s e n t i a l l y to distinguishing 
these from other more general sets (the s e t o f integers, 
the set o f quadrilaterals, 
the set o f s u r f a c e s ) . 
The 
distinguishing o f some s e t s from other more general ones 
was e f f e c t e d on the basis o f the following c r i t e r i o n : 
the 
elements o f the distinguished set had to possess some 
s p e c i f i c property (to be d i v i s i b l e by two, to have equal 
sides and a right angle, e t c ) , which all the elements o f 
the more general set do not possess. 
Naturally the ques-
tion arises: 
how are these more general s e t s defined, 
or, what i s the same thing, how are the p r o p e r t i e s which 
specify these more general sets defined? 
This question 
i s extremely interesting, 
but, unfortunately, 
i t 
goes 
beyond the scope o f t h i s book. 
We s t r e s s that the concepts o f "set" 
and "property" 
are c l o s e l y inter-related. 
We have already said that a 
property, say, a defines a s e t A o f e n t i t i e s possessing 
these properties; 
here i t i s assumed that a l l 
e n t i t i e s 
possessing the property a enter into the s e t A. 
But the 
converse assertion i s also c o r r e c t . 
I f some s e t A i s 
defined,then ipso f a c t o the property o f "belonging to 
the s e t A" 
i s defined. 
Thus the property o f being an 
Arabic cipher means that o f belonging to ( o r being 
similar t o ) one o f the ten symbols which above we c a l l e d 
"the elements o f the set Z o f the ciphers o f the Arabic 
system o f counting".

Direct and converse theorems 
I f we could somehow define the set o f integers then, 
ipso facto, we could define the property "to be an i n -
teger", 
i . e . 
"to belong to the set o f integers". 
However, i t i s easy to devise a property which no 
entity at a l l would possess. 
Thus, no quadrilaterals 
e x i s t for which the sum o f the angles at the v e r t i c e s 
equals 450°. 
Such a property in no way defines a set. 
However, for mathematical 
generality in these cases 
i t 
i s also said that the property defines a set, 
but a 
rather special set - a set containing no elements. 
Such 
sets 
containing 
no elements 
are known in mathematics 
as 
empty (vacuous) sets. 
Thus in the example c i t e d i t may be 
said that the quadrilaterals for which the sum o f the 
angles equals 450° form an empty set. 
§ 5. 
Relations between Sets 
Various relations can e x i s t between sets. 
We now 
indicate some o f these. 
Inclusion. 
We shall 
say that the set A is 
contained 
(included) 
in the set B if each element of A also 
be-
longs to B. 
This r e l a t i o n between the sets A and B we 
shall write thus: A c B. 
Consequently A c : B, i f 
i t 
follows from a£A 
that a£B. 
Often the expression 
"the set A i s contained in the set E " i s replaced by 
other expressions. 
"The set 
A constitutes 
part of 
the 
set 
B" , "the set 
A is a subset 
of the set 
B". 
If 
in 
the 
set B there are elements 
b not belonging 
to the set 
A, 
then it 
is said that the set 
A constitutes 
a proper 
part 
of 
the set B" . 
For example,the set o f rectangles 
i s 
contained in the set o f parallelograms and the l a t t e r i s 
contained in the set o f quadrilaterals. 
The s e t o f 
squares i s contained in both the set o f rectangles and 
the set o f rhombi. 
The s e t o f numbers d i v i s i b l e by 4 
constitutes a proper part o f the set o f even numbers.

* It is possible to give two distinct meanings to any state-

the word "or" appears. It is possible to understand such 
statements in the sense that the entity r belongs to one and 
only one of the two sets, either set A or set B, i.e., that 
the entity r cannot belong to both of these sets; it is also 
possible to understand the statement referred to in the sense 
that the entity r belongs to at least one of the two sets, 
i.e., that the possibility of the entity r belonging to both 
A and B is not excluded. In mathematics the conjunction "or" 
is used predominantly in the second sense. In this book the

the set B i s defined by the property p and AaB, 
then 
any entity possessing the property a must also possess 
the property 
J5 , If any entity 
which possesses

ty cc also possesses 
the property 
p then it said that 
the 
property 
a includes 
the property 
p , and this i s written 
thus: 
a z> p. 
Thus the property o f a quadrilateral having 
three right angles includes the property o f a quadri-
lateral having opposite angles equal. 
The property o f a 
number being d i v i s i b l e by 4 includes the property o f a 
number being even.

The Difference of Sets.

For e n t i t i e s not possessing the property a we shall say 
that they possess the property a (read as "not

now assume that there are e n t i t i e s in s t o r e KLMN belong-

We p a r t i t i o n 
them o f f with the p a r t i t i o n PR. 
We cover the place 
where the elements o f the set A are stored with oak 
planks (in Pig. 3 they are denoted by the v e r t i c a l hatch-

stored by pine planks (in Pig.3 they are denoted by hori-
zontal hatching). 
The places where the elements o f the 
sum o f the sets A + B are stored are apparently covered 
either by oak o r by pine planks o r by both. 
Hie storage 
place o f the elements o f the s e t A + B c l e a r l y possesses 
the product o f the property a (being beneath oak planks) 
and p (being beneath pine planks). 
With the diagram that we have constructed i t i s also 
p o s s i b l e t o i l l u s t r a t e the i n t e r s e c t i o n o f sets. 
In

belongs both to A and t o B\ 
consequently in PBNM is 
stored the i n t e r s e c t i o n AB o f the sets A and B.. 
They 
possess the sum 
a-f-S o f the p r o p e r t i e s which define 
the sets A and B r e s p e c t i v e l y . 
This sum o f properties 
corresponds to the fact that in the diagram the 
e n t i t i e s 
in PBNM are stored beneath two layers o f planks: 
both 
oak and pine. 
In Fig. 2 in the rectangle KLPR i s stored the

This figure a l s o i l l u s t r a t e s the

We now apply what has been said t o the c l a s s i f i c a t i o n

Let rectangle A BCD be a

The set o f trapezia i s a proper part o f the 
set o f quadrilaterals (there are quadrilaterals for which 
no pair o f opposite sides i s p a r a l l e l ) . 
Therefore,all 
trapezia belong in the store ABCD and i t i s p o s s i b l e to 
build a p a r t i t i o n within the store ABCD such that in the 
part o f the store AEFG partitioned o f f only trapezia 
are 
stored. 
Further, because the set o f parallelograms 
forms 
a proper part o f the set of trapezia, 
i t i s p o s s i b l e to 
separate, within the trapezium s e c t i o n AEFG, a part AKLM 
in which only parallelograms would be stored. 
We now 
separate, in the parallelogram s e c t i o n , parts for storage 
o f rectangles and rhombi. 
This i s p o s s i b l e because both 
the set o f rectangles and the set o f rhombi are proper 
parts o f the set o f parallelograms. 
The sets o f r e c t -

All triangles 
(the entire set o f triangles) can be 
divided into 3 kinds (subsets): 
obtuse,

are acute. 
These three subsets exhaust the entire s e t o f

( s e c t i o n s ) . 
The diagram under consideration c l o s e l y resembles d i a -
grams that you have undoubtedly drawn more than once i f 
only in school. 
In the usual diagrams we are 
interested 
not only in what subsets the given set i s divided into, 
but also in quantitative 
r e l a t i o n s between these subsets, 
e.g. 
the percentage o f e x c e l l e n t , good, fair, 
bad and 
very bad marks in a given c l a s s f o r a given term. 
In the 
given diagram we simplify the question: 
we are 
i n t e r e s t -
ed 
only in what subsets the given s e t can be divided 
into, and not in quantitative 
r e l a t i o n s between these 
subsets.

Now l e t the point M 
represent a s e t (correspond t o a s e t ) o f a l l

for which the number o f degrees in the biggest angle 
equals 60 plus the number o f half-millimetres

and conversely - to each point there would correspond one 
well-defined figure or group o f figures.

example, how t h i s can be done f o r triangles.

triangles 
having the given angles and conversely t o each set o f 
similar t r i a n g l e s there corresponds a point lying within 
or at the sides o f the triangle ABC. 
Here the points o f the triangle BCD not l y i n g on the 
side CD represent acute triangles, 
the points o f the 
triangle ACD (with the exception o f A) not lying on the 
side CD represent obtuse triangles, 
and the points o f the 
segment CD represent right-angled t r i a n g l e s . 
I f we re-
quired that t o each point o f the diagram there correspon-
ded only one triangle and not a whole set o f similar 
triangles, then i t would be necessary to take as the dia-
gram not a triangle but a triangular prism; 
to the d i s -
tance from the base o f the prism would correspond the 
c o e f f i c i e n t o f similarity. 
You can see that even a very simple diagram becomes 
somewhat involved under the establishment o f "exact" 
correspondence between the points o f the diagram and the 
figures being studied. 
Therefore, we shall henceforth 
use "inexact"

the converse i s the following: 
"a quadrilateral 
in which the diagonals b i s e c t each other i s a 
p a r a l l e l o -

for the theorem " i f in a quadrilateral a l l 
the 
sides are equal then i t s diagonals are mutually perpen-
dicular" 
the converse i s ; 
" i f in a quadrilateral 
the 
diagonals are mutually perpendicular then a l l 
i t s 
sides 
are 
equal". 
Converse 
theorems, just 
like direct 
ones, 
can be both 
true and false. 
Thus in the f i r s t o f the examples 
c i t e d , 
both the d i r e c t and the converse theorems are true; 
in 
the second example the theorem i s true, the converse, 
as 
we shall show below, i s false. 
Therefore 
the validity 
of 
converse 
theorems (as for direct 
ones) 
is subject 
to 
proof, 
and in fact in mathematical books you do find such 
proofs. 
But in elementary mathematical text books, 
g i v -
ing the proofs o f the converse theorems, 
the meaning o f 
converse theorems i s usually i n s u f f i c i e n t l y 
explained. 
Converse theorems or, more p r e c i s e l y , 
theorems which are 
true themselves and f o r which the converses are 
a l s o 
true, play a very large r o l e in mathematical studies. 
Therefore we shall dwell at length on the meaning o f con-
verse 
theorems*. 
* [it should be borne in mind that in scientific literature on 
mathematics the term "theorem" is employed, as a rule, in 
another sense from that in this book. Namely, by a theorem 
is meant a proposition in a mathematical theory which can be 
proved to be true by means of a logical argument. Prom this 
point of view, a converse theorem must be a true proposition, 
and the expression "false converse theorem" is meaningless. 
If we followed this use of the word "theorem", we would have 
to speak in this book of direct, converse, inverse-direct 
and inverse-converse propositions; and, since propositions 
may be true or false, we would have to distinguish further 
among these types the true propositions, and call only these 
"theorems". However, such terminology does not correspond 
to school practice, where it is customary to talk of the 
truth or falsehood of converse and inverse theorems.] 
26 

Direct and converse theorems 
We turn again to the theorem that we c i t e d by way o f 
example; 
"in a parallelogram the diagonals b i s e c t each 
other". 
This theorem i s true. 
I t may a l s o be formulated 
thus: 
" f o r one o f the kinds o f quadrilateral - a paral-
lelogram, the diagonals b i s e c t each other". 
There natu-
r a l l y arises the question: 
are parallelograms the only 
type o f quadrilateral for which the diagonals b i s e c t each 
other? 
This question i s equivalent t o the question o f 
the v a l i d i t y o f the converse theorem: 
"quadrilaterals 
for which the diagonals b i s e c t each other are p a r a l l e l o -
grams" . 
The proof o f the converse theorem reduces to 
the proof o f the fact that the opposite sides o f a quadri-
lateral for which the diagonals b i s e c t each other are 
p a r a l l e l . 
This converse theorem as i s e a s i l y shown, 
i s 
correct and, therefore, 
we may give an affirmative 
reply 
to the question posed e a r l i e r , 
A parallelogram i s usually defined as the kind o f 
quadrilateral having the following fundamental 
property 
which characterizes i t : 
opposite sides o f the quadri-
lateral are parallel*. 
Hence emerges a s e r i e s o f other 
properties o f t h i s quadrilateral, 
amongst which there i s 
also the property that at t h e i r i n t e r s e c t i o n i t s 
diagonals 
b i s e c t each other. 
Here i t appears that t h i s l a t t e r 
property so characterizes the parallelogram that i t can 
be taken as the fundamental property 
which characterizes 
the parallelogram as a particular kind o f 
quadrilateral. 
We now pass on to the second example: 
" i f in a quadri-
lateral a l l the sides are equal then i t s diagonals are 
mutually perpendicular". 
I t i s e a s i l y shown that this 
theorem i s true. 
Thus in this case we characterize cer-
tain quadrilaterals by the following fundamental 
property: 
the sides o f these quadrilaterals are equal. 
All these 
quadrilaterals possess(because the theorem stated i s 
true) 
* Or, what is the same thing, as a kind of trapezium for which 
the secondary sides are parallel.

o f the converse theorem: 
" i f in a quadrilateral

diagonals are mutually perpendicular then a l l the s i d e s 
thereof are equal" . 
The answer to this question in the 
given case i s found to be negative, i . e , , in the given 
case the converse theorem i s not true. 
In order t o be

I t i s c l e a r that for the study o f geometric 
figures 
(as 
for other e n t i t i e s ) 
it 
is very 
important to know not 
only 
the properties 
of the given figure 
but also which of 
its 
properties 
can be taken as its 
fundamental 
properties, 
entirely 
defining 
the given figure. 
These properties 
of 
geometric 
figures 
are distinguished 
by proving 
the 
con-

theorems. 
In both the examples considered we have been concerned 
with a set M, namely the set o f quadrilaterals. 
Prom 
t h i s set M we distinguished a part, the subset A, the 
elements o f which possess some property 
The paral-
lelograms, i , e , , quadrilaterals 
f o r which opposite sides 
are parallel 
(property a ) were such a subset in the 
f i r s t example, and in the second example - the quadri-
l a t e r a l s with equal sides (property a ) . 
Further we were 
convinced o f the f a c t that the elements o f the subset A, 
besides the property 
a, possess some further 
property, 
say p, 
i, e,, that the set A cz M, defined by the proper-
ty, a i s part o f the set 
BczM, 
defined by the property 
p. 
The property p in the f i r s t example was the property 
o f the diagonals b i s e c t i n g each other; 
in the second 
example the property p was the mutual perpendicularity o f 
the diagonals. 
Further we asked ourselves: 
can the 
property P be considered a defining property o f the set 
A
1? 
In other words, i f any element o f the o r i g i n a l set M 
has the property p , must i t also have the property 
a, 
i . e , , 
i s the set A a proper part o f the set B o r does i t 
exactly c o i n c i d e with the set A? 
Are a l l 
quadrilaterals 
f o r which the diagonals b i s e c t each other parallelograms? 
Do all quadrilaterals 
with mutually perpendicular diagon-
a l s have equal sides? 
Hie answer to these questions 
depends upon the truth or falsehood o f the s o - c a l l e d con-
verse theorem. 
The meaning o f the simultaneous v a l i d i t y 
(truth) o r i n v a l i d i t y (falsehood) o f the d i r e c t and con-

but a l s o 
Be A, 
i . e . in this case the s e t s A and B are i d e n t i c a l . 
Thus, identical 
sets have the same elements. 
If a and (3 are properties 
such that 
ac$ 
and [3cza, 
then we say that the properties 
a and ]9 are 
identical, 
and we write a = p . 
In other words, the properties 
a and 
p are identical 
if any entity 
possessing 
one of these 
properties 
must also possess 
the 
other. 
Identical properties c l e a r l y define identical sets, and 
conversely, properties defining identical s e t s are also 
i d e n t i c a l . 
We now return t o d i r e c t and converse theorems. 
The 
i n t e r r e l a t i o n between d i r e c t and converse theorems can 
now be formulated in the following 
fashion: 
Let some set M be given. 
The direct 
theorem 
asserts 
tiiat elements of the set M possessing 
property 
a 
(belong-
ing to the set A) also possess 
the property 
(3 (also 
belongs to the set B). 
The validity 
of this assertion 
is 
subject 
to proof 
or disproof: 
it can be true or 
false. 
The converse 
theorem asserts 
that elements of the set M 
possessing 
the property 
p (belonging 
to set B) also 
possess 
the property 
a (also belongs to set A). 
The 
validity 
of this assertion 
is also subject 
to proof 
or 
disproof. 
For example, in the set M o f quadrilaterals, one can 
30 

Direct and converse theorems 
31 
define the parallelograms (set A) as quadrilaterals for 
which opposite sides are parallel 
(property a ) , and 
reach the conclusion that opposite s i d e s o f such quadri-
l a t e r a l s are equal (property p defining the set £ ) . 
In the converse theorem, one considers the quadrilaterals 
possessing property (3 - the equality o f o p p o s i t e sides -
- and proves that these sides are p a r a l l e l , 
i . e . that 
this quadrilateral i s a parallelogram. 
The simultaneous 
validity 
of the direct 
and 
converse 
theorems means the following:- 
the subset A, 
distinguished 
from set M by property 
a, 
is identical 
to the subset 
B, 
distinguished 
from set M by property 
p. 
Thus the simultaneous v a l i d i t y o f the d i r e c t and con-
verse theorems means the v a l i d i t y o f two i d e n t i t i e s : 
a) o f sets 
MA = 
MB 
and b) o f p r o p e r t i e s 
where by A/' we denote (temporarily) the pioperty "belong-
ing to M". 
(Note that the terms M and M' cannot be "can-
c e l l e d " in these 
i d e n t i t i e s ) . 
It i s readily n o t i c e d that i f we start from the second 
theorem that we have c a l l e d the converse and consider i t 
as the d i r e c t theorem, then the theorem that we have 
c a l l e d the d i r e c t becomes the converse. 
Therefore we 
often speak not o f d i r e c t and converse theorems but o f 
two mutually converse theorems. 
Thus, 
two 
propositions, 
of which one asserts 
that elements of set M 
possessing 
the property 
a, also possess 
the property 
p. and the 

Direct and converse theorems 
32 
other asserts 
that elements 
of the set M 
possessing 
property ft, also possess 
property 
a, 
are known as mutually 
converse 
theorems. 
Problem 12. 
For what theorems do you know valid con-
verses? 
In problems 13-16 formulate and prove the theorems con-
verse t o the stated theorems: 
Problem 13. 
In a parallologram the diagonals b i s e c t

angles.

I f some number (written in the decimal 
system) i s d i v i s i b l e by 9, then the sum o f i t s ciphers 
i s also d i v i s i b l e by 9-
Problem 16. 
In a right-angled triangle the square on 
the 
hypotenuse equals the sum o f the squares on the 
other two sides. 
Problem 17. 
Is the theorem, converse to the 
following, 
true: 
" I f in a triangle, 
one angle i s obtuse o r a right 
angle, then the other two angles are acute"? 
We have already mentioned the fact that the converse 
( l i k e the d i r e c t theorem) can be false. 
It i s 
important 
here to state the following: 
whether the converse 
theorem 
is true or not often depends upon liow we formulate 
this 
converse 
theorem. 
Take, for example, the theorem "the diagonals o f a 
rhombus are mutually perpendicular" . I f the converse i s 
formulated thus "a quadrilateral the diagonals o f which 
are perpendicular, 
i s a rhombus" then t h i s theorem i s 

Direct and converse theorems 
false, 
as i s easily concluded from what was said on p, 29, 
I f we formulate i t thus: 
"a parallelogram, the diagonals 
o f which are mutually perpendicular, 
i s a rhombus" then 
i t becomes true (the proof o f t h i s i s l e f t for the readr 
er)„ 
We now look at t h i s example in greater d e t a i l . 
In the 
f i r s t case we s i n g l e out rhombi and quadrilaterals with 
mutually perpendicular diagonals from the set o f quadri-
l a t e r a l s . 
In the second case we s i n g l e out rhombi and 
quadrilaterals with mutually perpendicular diagonals from 
the set o f parallelograms. 
In t h i s second case the 
theorem became true. 
Why did t h i s happen? 
P a r a l l e l o -
grams are singled out from the set o f quadrilaterals, 
as 
those elements possessing the property T . that opposite 
sides are p a r a l l e l . 
The rhombi are singled out from the 
set o f parallelograms as those elements having the 
property a , that adjacent sides are equal. 
Thus rhombi 
are the elements o f the set o f quadrilaterals having the 
property a + 7. 
The converse theorem i s true, 
i, e, quadrilaterals hav-
ing property a-+-T» also have property (3 (perpendiculari-
ty o f the diagonals). 
The f i r s t 
formulation o f the converse theorem i s equi-
valent to the assertion that quadrilaterals having only the 
one property {3, also have the property 
a - f - 7 . 
i « e , have 
both the property a and the property 7. This assertion 
i s 
false, 
The second formulation o f the converse theorem i s 
equivalent to the assertion that quadrilaterals having 
the two properties p and 7, i, e, the property [ 3 + 7. 
a l s o 
have the property a. This assertion turns out t o be true. 
Putting i t another way, in the given theorem we con-
sidered e n t i t i e s 
(quadrilaterals) 
satisfying two con-
d i t i o n s : 
1) these quadrilaterals are parallelograms, 
2) the diagonals o f these quadrilaterals are mutually 
perpendicular. 
In the conclusion i s contained one asser-
33 

Direct and converse theorems 
34 
tion. 
Thus, we can construct 
the converse 
theorem in 
two ways: 
either 
by taking as the conclusion 
in 
the 
converse 
theorem all 
the conditions 
imposed upon an 
entity 
in the direct 
theorem and by making the 
condition 
of the converse 
theorem only one conclusion 
of the 
direct 
theorem, 
or by taking as the conclusion 
of 
the 
converse 
theorem only a part of the conditions 
imposed upon the 
entity 
in the direct 
theorem and by making the 
remaining 
part of 
the conditions 
of the direct 
theorem 
together 
with its 
conclusion 
the condition 
of the converse 
theorem. 
Generally the condition o f the theorem may include in 
i t s e l f some conditions imposed upon the entity considered, 
and i t s conclusions some assertions concerning t h i s en-
t i t y . 
Combining in different 
ways the conditions imposed 
upon the entity considered and the assertions 
contained 
in the conclusion o f the theorem, 
we can obtain from a 
given theorem a whole s e r i e s o f converses. 
We shall i l l u s t r a t e this further by the following 
example. 
In the theorem " I f in a quadrilateral 
opposite 
sides are p a r a l l e l , then they are also equal" the entity -
- a quadrilateral - complies with two conditions: 
1) one pair o f opposite sides must be p a r a l l e l : 
2) the other pair o f opposite sides must be p a r a l l e l . 
The conclusion o f t h i s theorem contains 2 assertions: 
1) one pair o f opposite sides o f the given quadrilateral 
are 
equal 
2) the other pair o f opposite sides o f the given quad-
r i l a t e r a l are 
equal. 
Combining the conditions and conclusions o f t h i s theo-
rem, i t i s p o s s i b l e to obtain the following converse 

Direct and converse theorems 
35 
theorems: 
I. 
" I f in a Quadrilateral 
both pairs o f opposite s i d e s 
are equal, then they are a l s o p a r a l l e l " (this theorem i s 
true): 
I I . 
" I f in a quadrilateral 
one and the same p a i r o f 
sides are both equal and p a r a l l e l , 
then the other pair 
o f opposite sides are a l s o equal and p a r a l l e l " 
(this 
theorem i s t r u e ) . 
I I I . 
" I f in a quadrilateral 
one pair o f opposite s i d e s 
are equal, and the other p a r a l l e l , 
then in t h i s quadri-
lateral the f i r s t pair are p a r a l l e l and the second p a i r 
equal" ( t h i s theorem i s not true: 
a symmetric trapezium 
a l s o s a t i s f i e s the conditions o f t h i s theorem). 
Finally, l e t us say that the converse theorem need not contain 
in i t s condition and conclusion a l l the conditions and a l l 
the 
conclusions o f the d i r e c t theorem. Thus, in the l a s t example 
the converse theorem could be further 
formulated thus: 
a) " I f in a quadrilateral 
one and the same pair o f 
opposite sides are equal and p a r a l l e l , 
then the other 
pair o f opposite sides are p a r a l l e l " (one o f the con-
clusions o f the d i r e c t theorem i s absent: 
the other p a i r 
o f opposite sides are equal). 
b) " I f in a quadrilateral 
one and the same pair o f 
opposite s i d e s are equal and p a r a l l e l , 
then the other 
pair o f opposite s i d e s are equal" (one o f the conclusions 
o f the d i r e c t theorem i s absent: 
the other pair o f 
opposite s i d e s are p a r a l l e l ) . 
Both o f these theorems may 
be combined into the one given above (theorem I I ) -

theorems stated in problems 2 and 4, 
Are these theorems

Problem 20. Considering a parallelogram as a form o f 
trapezium indicate what meaning the following theorem 
has: 
"quadrilaterals 
for which two opposite sides are 
equal and p a r a l l e l , 
are parallelograms" . 
Problem 21. Formulate and prove the converse theorem 
to the following: 
"the diagonals o f a rectangle are 
equal" . 
The i n t e r r e l a t i o n o f d i r e c t and converse theorems can 
be very graphically i l l u s t r a t e d 
with the aid o f the 
diagrams mentioned in § 6. 
For example, we represent with 
the aid o f such a diagram the theorem "the diagonals o f 
a rhombus are mutually perpendicular" 
and the theorems 
converse t o i t . 
Let the rectangle ABCD (Fig, 8) c o r r e s -
pond to the set o f quadrilaterals. 
In t h i s rectangle we 
pick out a part which would correspond t o parallelograms 
and we hatch t h i s part v e r t i c a l l y . 
We also pick out in 
the rectangle ABCD a p a r t corresponding to the set o f 
quadrilaterals with mutually perpendicular diagonals and 
hatch i t horizontally. 
What must be the r e l a t i v e d i s -

The h o r i z o n t a l l y hatched part o f the diagram can e i t h e r

I f the v e r t i c a l l y and h o r i z o n t a l l y hatched parts 
o f the diagram did not overlap each other, as in Pig, 8, 
then t h i s would mean that there i s no parallelogram with

But, as i s well known, such an assertion does not

This means that the h o r i z o n t a l l y

overlap one another. 
In this event there may be three 
cases:

We now analyse what the mutual d i s p o s i t i o n o f the

The grey part o f the diagram 
must be horizontally hatched, 
the horizontal 
hatching 
necessarily covering in entirety t h i s part o f the dia-
gram, because the diagonals o f rhombi are mutually per-
pendicular. 
Moreover the overlap o f the parts o f the

these 
two parts o f the diagram p a r t i a l l y overlap. 
Fig. 9 
states that f o r a l l parallelograms the diagonals are

but t h i s theorem i s not true, 
therefore, 
Fig.9 does not f i t in our case. 
Fig. 10 does

because the theorem "a quadrilateral

Thus, the parts o f the diagram with h o r i -
zontal and v e r t i c a l hatching must p a r t i a l l y 
overlap. 
Further, from the set o f parallelograms we pick out the 
set o f rhombi. 
As we know, the l a t t e r i s a proper part 
o f the set o f parallelograms. 
In view o f this, 
the part

constitute some part o f the diagram that i s v e r t i c a l l y

The part o f the diagram corresponding t o the

entirely coloured grey, because the converse theorem

Thus, the i n t e r r e l a t i o n 
between 
quadrilaterals with mutually perpendicular diagonals, 
rhombi and parallelograms can be represented as in Fig. 11. 
Prom t h i s figure i t follows that the theorem "Quadrila-

Actually, we did not use the falsehood o f

We construc-

quadrilaterals with mutually perpendicular diagonals that 
are not parallelograms ( i . e . that the theorem "quadri-

The

Reductio ad absurdum 
Often a d i r e c t proof o f a certain theorem presents 
great d i f f i c u l t y ( i t sometimes even proves t o be im-
p o s s i b l e ) , while the proof o f the inverse converse

theorem presents no d i f f i c u l t y . 
In such cases, 
instead 
of 
the direct 
theorem, 
the inverse 
converse 
theorem 
equivalent 
to it 
is proved. 
However, instead o f speaking 
o f the substitution o f the proof o f the given theorem by 
the proof o f the inverse converse theorem we speak o f 
reductio 
ad absurdum. 
I now give an example o f such a proof. 
"Theorem: 
i f two straight l i n e s are each parallel 
t o 
a third straight l i n e , then they are parallel to each 
o t h e r . " 
Proof (by reductio ad absurdum). 
We assume that the 
l i n e s AB and CD are not parallel and intersect at some 
point P (Pig. 15)- 
Adopting this assumption we come to 
the conclusion that two d i f f e r e n t straight l i n e s AB and 
CD, parallel 
t o a third EF, pass through the point P; but 
this contradicts the axiom about parallel l i n e s , 
conse-
quently the assumption made i s not true. 
Thus, the l i n e s 
AB and CD parallel to the l i n e EF cannot i n t e r s e c t - they 
are 
p a r a l l e l " 
The reader w i l l e a s i l y n o t i c e that in fact the 
f o l l o w -
ing theorem has been proved: 
" I f two straight l i n e s 
( l y i n g in the same plane) are not p a r a l l e l t o each other 
then they cannot each be parallel to some third straight 
l i n e " , i . e . the inverse converse o f the theorem which 
was t o be proved. 
However, owing to the equivalence o f 
the d i r e c t and the inverse converse theorems, 
having 
proved the l a t t e r , we have ipso facto 
also proved the 
d i r e c t theorem: 
" i f two straight l i n e s are each parallel 
to a third straight l i n e , then they are parallel t o each 
other" . 
We now consider a further example. 
Theorem: 
i f two p a r a l l e l s t r a i g h t l i n e s are 
intersected

by a third then the internal opposite angles are equal. 
Proof. 
Let us assume that 
END i s not equal t o 
/_AMN 
(Pig. 16)- 
Let for example 
END> 
^AMN. 
We construct at the point M and the secant EF the angle 
KMN — 
END. 
Because 
^ KMN — £ END 
(by 
c o n s t r u c t i o n ) , then KM\\CD 
and thus two straight l i n e s 
KM and 
p a r a l l e l 
to CD pass through the point M, but 
this contradicts the axiom concerning parallel 
l i n e s , 
and therefore the assumption made that ^ END > l_ 
AMN, 
i s false. 
I f we assume that /^END 
< /^AMNthen, 
by con-
structing at the point M and the secant EF an angle equal 
to ^END, 
we again come to the conclusion that two 
straight l i n e s parallel 
to CD pass through the point M, 
which i s impossible, because t h i s contradicts the axiom 
concerning parallel 
l i n e s . 
Thus i f ^END 
can be 
neither greater nor smaller than ^AMN, 
then these 
angles must be equal, and t h i s means that the internal 
opposite angles, formed by the i n t e r s e c t i o n o f two paral-
l e l straight l i n e s and a third one, are equal. 
In this case we again see that the proof o f the given 
theorem was reduced to the proof o f the inverse converse 
theorem: 
" i f two straight l i n e s i n t e r s e c t a third and 
the internal opposite angles so formed are not equal, 
then these straight l i n e s are not p a r a l l e l " . 
In fact 
the proof o f the theorem reduced to the following, 
s t a r t -
ing from the assumption that the internal opposite angles 
are not equal 
( i . e . from the condition o f the inverse 
converse theorem) i t was proved that i t i s possible^ to 
draw a straight l i n e KM through the point M, parallel 
to 
CD and non-coincident with AB. 
Further, starting from the axiom concerning parallel 
l i n e s , we concluded that AB i s not parallel 
to CD, i . e . 
we proved the inverse converse theorem.

49 
However, instead of speaking of the substitution 
in 
all 
these proofs 
of the direct 
theorem by the inverse 
converse, 
we speak of reduction 
to a contradiction 
(to 
the absurd) 
or of proof 
from the opposite. 
Here, f o r example, 
i s 
what Kiselev has to say about proof from the opposite*: 
"The method by which we have j u s t proved the converse 
theorems i s known as the proof 
from the opposite 
o r re-
duction 
to the absurd (reductio 
ad absuraum). 
This 
method obtained i t s f i r s t name because at the beginning 
o f the argument the opposite 
(inverse) supposition i s 
made t o that required to be proved ( i . e . the condition 
o f the d i r e c t theorem i s replaced by the condition o f the 
inverse opposite - I . S . G . ) . 
It i s c a l l e d reduction to 
the absurd because o f the fact that, arguing on the 
basis o f the assumption made, we arrive at an untenable 
(absurd) conclusion. 
The emergence o f such a conclusion 
compels us t o r e j e c t the assumption i n i t i a l l y made and 
to adopt that which was t o be proved". 
I t i s c l e a r why, in the process o f these proofs, we 
arrived at an absurd conclusion. 
We start from the con-
d i t i o n o f the d i r e c t theorem and combine with i t 
the 
condition o f the inverse converse theorem. 
I f the 
d i r e c t theorem i s true, then such a "combination" 
must 
lead us to a contradiction. 
In fact, by annexing the 
condition o f the inverse converse theorem, we must also 
annex i t s conclusion (since t h i s theorem i s equivalent to 
the d i r e c t one and thus true, i f the d i r e c t theorem i s 
true) and t h i s conclusion i s incompatible with the con-
d i t i o n o f the d i r e c t theorem (contradicts this c o n d i t i o n ) , 
because i t i s obtained by means o f the negation o f the 
l a t t e r . 
I f the d i r e c t theorem i s f a l s e then the annex-
ing o f the condition o f the inverse converse theorem does 
not lead t o a contradiction. 
Since the d i r e c t theorem 

Direct and converse theorems 
must be either true or false, the discovery o f a contra-
d i c t i o n in the course o f a proof from the opposite t e s t i -
f i e s t o the v a l i d i t y o f the d i r e c t theorem. 
The method o f reductio ad absurdum can also be explained 
with the aid o f the concept o f properties above (see § 5 
and also § 7 pp27-31). Let us require to prove the theorem: 
"if 
some entity 
a (of 
the set M) possesses 
the 
property 
a then it also possesses 
the property 
P F o r 
the 
proof o f the theorem we assume that there e x i s t 
e n t i t i e s 
a which, while possessing property 
a , 
at the same time 
do not possess property 
p. 
Further, by means o f a s e r i e s 
o f inferences we come to the conclusion that any 
entity 
a not possessing property (3 also does not possess property 
a. 
Since we are considering only those e n t i t i e s 
and 
properties for each o f which one and only one o f the two 
propositions (statements): 
"an entity a possesses the 
property 
a " 
and "an entity a does not possess the 
property a " 
i s true, the result obtained i s a contra-
diction; 
and this compels us to r e j e c t the supposition 
that there e x i s t e n t i t i e s a which have the property a but 
not the property 
p, 
and so to r e a l i s e the truth o f the 
theorem to be proved. 
In problems 32-34 are stated theorems which are usually 
proved by reductio ad absurdum. 
Indicate the inverse 
converse theorems which are proved in such cases.

Direct and converse theorems 
Problem 35. 
We assume that we wish to prove a c l e a r l y 
false theorem by the method o f reductio ad absurdum. 
As 
usual, we make the opposite (inverse) assumption to that 
which we require t o prove, and proceed with our 
reason-
ing. 
Can we arrive at a contradiction in t h i s case, 
and i f not, why not? 
We turn our attention once again to proof by reductio 
ad absurdum. 
Essentially such a proof reduces to 
the 
following: 
we s t a r t from some assumption and, using true 
theorems, 
we make a s e r i e s o f s t r i c t l y l o g i c a l ( i . e . 
v a l i d ) inferences. 
As a r e s u l t o f these inferences we 
arrive at some proposition which, we are certain, 
i s 
false, 
and we further argue thus: 
i f our 
supposition 
were valid,then as a result o f l o g i c a l l y c o r r e c t 
i n f e r -
ence we could only a r r i v e at a v a l i d conclusion; 
there-
fore we can arrive at a f a l s e conclusion with l o g i c a l l y 
v a l i d inference only under one condition: 
i f our i n i t i a l 
assumption was not true. 
We now present another example: 
we s t a r t from some 
assumption, 
use true theorems, 
make a s e r i e s o f l o g i c a l 
( v a l i d ) inferences and arrive at some conclusion which 
we know to be valid. 
Can we assert on the basis o f t h i s 
that our i n i t i a l supposition was v a l i d ? 
No, 
In order 
to be convinced o f t h i s , I now sketch the course o f our 
argument. 
We start from supposition A and prove the 
theorem: 
" i f supposition A i s true, then proposition B 
i s a l s o true" (more b r i e f l y , 
i f A then B)„ 
We know that 
proposition B i s true. 
But from the truth o f proposition 
Pig. 15. 
51 

Direct and converse theorems 
B and the v a l i d i t y o f the theorem stated ( i f A then B) 
the truth o f supposition A does not 
follow. 
In order to prove the truth o f supposition A i t would 
be necessary t o prove the converse theorem: 
" i f propo-
s i t i o n B i s true then proposition A i s a l s o true" , o r t o 
prove the equivalent inverse converse theorem: " i f proposition 
A i s not true, then neither i s proposition B". 
But we 
already know full well that from the truth o f the d i r e c t 
theorem ( i f A then B) nothing can be stated about the 
truth o f the converse (or inverse) theorem ( i f B then A, 
or, i f not A then not B) i . e . , 
given the truth o f the 
theorem: 
" i f proposition A i s true, then proposition JB 
i s a l s o true" 
it 
is possible 
(but not necessary) 
that 
the theorem: 
" i f proposition A i s not true, then propo-
s i t i o n B i s not true" 
i s a l s o true. 
Consequently, in 
t h i s case our initial 
supposition 
can be either 
true or 
false, 
its 
truth or falsehood 
being in no way 
connected 
with the reasoning given 
above. 
This observation i s particularly useful in algebra and 
trigonometry. 
In algebra, in order to prove some equa-
l i t y ( o r to s o l v e an equation) 
we often subject both 
sides t o a s e r i e s o f transformations. 
As a result we 
are l e d t o some identity and hence we conclude that our 
i n i t i a l 
identity i s v a l i d . 
Such a crude inference often 
Pig. 16.

Direct and converse theorems 
leads to f a l l a c i e s , 
many o f which have gained 
notoriety 
under the name o f paradoxes*. 
I now c i t e 
some examples. 
Example 1. 
We consider whether the equality 3 — 2 — 
—2 — 3 
i s valid. 
To t h i s end we square both 
sides, 
and reach the obvious identity: 
(3 — 2)

However 3 — 2 = 1 
=£2 — 3 = — 1. 
The e r r o r i s contained in a very simple fact: 
we 
obtain equal quantities by squaring both equals and 
unequals (equals in absolute magnitude but d i f f e r i n g in 
s i g n ) . 
* [A fallacy may be obtained in the case when just one step in 
the transformations to which we subjected the initial equality 
(or equation) does not preserve the equivalence of the ex-
pression to be transformed and the transformed expression. 
Two expressions (in particular, equalities) A and B are* 
equivalent if B follows from A and A follows from B (see ch.2, 
11, PP 97-99); equivalence can be defined for equations in 
the following way: two equations (for simplicity we shall 
refer to equations with one unknown) are equivalent if they 
have the same roots, i.e., if from the fact that some number 
x satisfies one of them it follows that this number also 
satisfies the other, and vice versa. If all the transforma-
tions are accomplished by equivalence, then the form of reason-
ing being discussed in the text is entirely lawful and 
cannot lead to error. "In the example considered below er-
roneousness of the conclusion appears as soon as non-equiva-
lent transformations are applied in the course of the reason-
ing. Such a transformation in the first example is the 
squaring process (since if a = £, then a*=b
2 
but not con-
versely: from the fact that a*=b* it is not possible to 
conclude that a = b). Therefore, from the validity of an 
equation obtained as a result of the transformation, it is not 
possible to draw a conclusion about the validity of the 
initial equation. 
Errors appear similarly in the remaining examples with the 
peculiarity, however, that in the second example (as distinct 
from the first) we are concerned with an equation, and in the 
third with the validity of an equation for all x (except* = 0)]

How are these numbers related to equation ( 1 ) ? 
I f a 
number a s a t i s f i e s equation ( 1 ) , i . e . i f i t turns i t 
into 
an identity, 
then this number also turns equation (2) 
i n t o an identity. 
I f the number 6 does not satisfy 
equation'(2) then neither can i t satisfy equation ( 1 ) . 
Therefore, 
the r o o t s o f equation (1) must a l s o be roots 
o f equation ( 2 ) . 
But we obtain equal numbers by squaring 
not only equal numbers. 
Therefore, the roots o f equation 
(2) can be the roots o f equation ( 1 ) , but not necessarily 
so. 
Thus the roots o f equation (1) can only be roots o f 
equation ( 2 ) , but the roots o f equation (2) are not 
necessarily the roots o f equation ( 1 ) . 
Passing t o the

o f some rectangles are equal, e. g, the diagonals o f a 
square or o f a rectangle for which one s i d e i s twice the 
adjacent one, then the reader would not be s a t i s f i e d . 
For 
proof o f t h i s theorem i t i s insufficient 
to prove that 
the diagonals o f some rectangles are equal; 
for i t s 
proof i t i s necessary 
to prove that the diagonals o f any 
rectangle are equal, and, ipso facto, that the diagonals 
o f all 
rectangles are equal. 
We now consider another example. 
The theorem "quadri-
l a t e r a l s f o r which the diagonals are mutually perpendi-
cular are rhombi" 
i s not true. 
In order to prove 
this 
it 
is sufficient 
to cite 
one example o f a 
quadrilateral 
for which the diagonals are mutually perpendicular and 
which, however, i s not a rhombus. 
Such a 
quadrilateral 
was constructed on page 28- This one quadrilateral 
is 
s u f f i c i e n t to refute our theorem, since i t proves that 
not a l l quadrilaterals, 
for which the diagonals are 
mutually perpendicular, are rhombi, 
I wish t o underline 
the following in t h i s proof. 
The assertion "not a l l 
elements o f the set M possess some property a " i s 
equivalent to the assertion "among the elements o f the set 
M there e x i s t s at least one which does not possess the 
property a (possesses the property a ) " . 
The equivalence 
o f these two assertions i s entirely clear, although 
i t 
sometimes bothers even undergraduates. 
On the basis o f 
what has been said, 
for the proof o f the assertion "not 
a l l elements o f the set M possess property 
a " 
i t 
suf-
f i c e s to c i t e as an example j u s t one element o f the set 
M not possessing property 
a. 
Precisely, the 
assertion 
"among the elements o f the set M there e x i s t 
e n t i t i e s 
58 

Direct and converse theorems 
possessing the property a " i s equivalent to the negation 
"the property a i s not lacking in a l l the elements o f 
the set M" . 
In order to prove t h i s l a s t assertion 
i t 
i s s u f f i c i e n t t o c i t e the example o f j u s t one element o f 
the s e t M possessing the property 
a. 
For example, 
in 
order to be convinced that among the triangles there can 
be some such that a l l three angles are acute, i t i s suf-
f i c i e n t t o r e c a l l the existence o f the equilateral 
t r i -
angle f o r which each angle equals 60°. 
However this 
simple method o f proof with the aid o f an example i s not 
always f e a s i b l e . 
Sometimes, and in higher mathematics 
f a i r l y often, i t i s easier to prove that property a i s 
not absent from a l l the elements o f the set M than to 
show concretely j u s t one element o f the s e t M possessing 
property a. 
I f the reader does not b e l i e v e t h i s , 
l e t 
him try to prove the following fact: 
there are at 
l e a s t 
two people who have the same number o f hairs on the head. 
I f you can point out Ivanov and Petrov f o r whom the 
numbers o f hairs on the head are the same, then your 
problem i s solved. 
However, try to find these men Ivanov 
and Petrov! 
I t i s obvious that this problem i s d i f f i c u l t . 
S t i l l two such men e x i s t . 
In order to be convinced o f 
this we replace our assertion by the negation equivalent 
t o i t : 
" i t i s not true that any two people have d i f f e r e n t 
numbers o f hairs". 
I t i s very easy t o prove the negation. 
The number o f hairs on a person's head does not exceed 
500,000; 
therefore the number o f people possessing d i f -
ferent numbers o f hairs cannot exceed 500,000. 
Since the 
number o f inhabitants o f a large c i t y , e.g. Moscow, ex-
ceeds 500,000, then not even f o r the inhabitants o f a 
large c i t y can any p a i r have d i f f e r e n t numbers o f hairs, 
i . e . , 
there e x i s t , even in any s u f f i c i e n t l y large c i t y , 
at least one pair o f persons have the same number o f 
hairs. 
Who these people are i s unknown both to 
the 
author and to the 
reader. 
It i s readily n o t i c e d that the l a t t e r p r o o f i s a p r o o f 
from the o p p o s i t e .

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions 
We turn again to d i r e c t and converse theorems: 
1) I f some element o f the set M possesses property 
a, 
then i t a l s o possesses property |3. 
2) I f some element o f the set M possesses property [3, 
then i t also possesses property 
a. 
These assertions can a l s o be formulated somewhat 
60 
Problem 39. 
"Not a l l the pupils o f the 8th grade are 
t a l l e r than the pupils o f the 6th grade". 
Formulate 
this assertion without resorting to the expression "not

Problem 40.

Formulate these assertions without resorting to the

o f printed symbols ( l e t t e r s ,

the same. 
For the solution o f this problem you may use 
the following data: 
the number o f printed symbols on 
one page does not exceed 10,000. 
In the Lenin library 
in Moscow there are more than 6 million books with d i f -

namely: 
1) Any element o f the set M possessing property a, must 
necessarily 
possess property p. 
2) An element o f set M possess property a when i t 
possesses property 
p, 
i . e . in order that an element o f 
the set M possess property a, 
i t i s sufficient 
that i t 
possess property 
p. 
Often 
the direct 
and converse 
theorems are replaced 
by 
one statement 
which is formulated 
in the following 
way: 
"In order ttiat an element of the set M possess 
property 
a it 
is necessary 
and sufficient 
that it possess 
proper-
ty p". 
From what has been said i t i s c l e a r that t h i s l a t t e r 
assertion incorporates two theorems: 
the d i r e c t and the 
converse. 
We now c i t e some examples: 
"In order that arcs in one and the same c i r c l e (or in 
equal c i r c l e s ) be equal, i t i s necessary and s u f f i c i e n t 
that the chords subtending them be equal", 
"In order that chords in one and the same c i r c l e (or in 
equal c i r c l e s ) be equal, i t i s necessary and s u f f i c i e n t 
that they be equidistant 
from the centre" , 
Sometimes for the combination o f the d i r e c t and con-
verse theorems in one statement we use the words "in that 
case and only that case when . . . . " or the words "if and 
only 
if 
. . . . " Thus, for instance, 
the l a s t two theorems 
can also be formulated thus: 
"In one and the same c i r c l e (or in two equal c i r c l e s ) 
two arcs are equal if and only 
if the chords subtending 
them are equal" .

The Locus of Points 
Until now we have been concerned with the p r o p e r t i e s 
o f various mathematical 
e n t i t i e s , 
including geometrical 
s o l i d s , surfaces, 
l i n e s and points. 
We have touched

Often in d e f i n i t i o n s there are contained the necessary 
and s u f f i c i e n t conditions that a given entity belong to 
some s e t . 
Therefore, s t r i c t formulations o f d e f i n i t i o n s 
often contain the words "necessary and s u f f i c i e n t " , " i f 
and only i f " 
and similar expressions. 
Using these 
expressions i t i s p o s s i b l e to formulate the d e f i n i t i o n 
o f the i n t e r s e c t i o n o f sets given by us above, e.g. thus: 
"The set C i s the intersection o f s e t s A and B i f and

and B, and no others" 
I t i s p o s s i b l e to give an analogous d e f i n i t i o n for that

entity with respect to another. 
We now pass on to t h i s 
Question and start with the simplest o f geometrical en-
t i t i e s - points. 
For example, we study the 
d i s t r i b u t i o n 
in a plane o f points equidistant from two given points A 
and B. 
As i s known, such points l i e on the straight l i n e 
MN passing through the mid-point o f the segment AB and 
perpendicular to this segment. 
But this i s not enough. 
Naturally two questions arise: 
1) Are a l l the p o i n t s on 
the l i n e MN equidistant 
from the two given points? 2) Are 
there not points equidistant from A and B and not lying 
on the l i n e MN? The following two theorems answer these 
questions: 
Theorem. 
I f any point (K) l i e s on the perpendicular 
b i s e c t o r (MN) o f the segment (AB) then i t i s 
equidistant 
from the ends o f t h i s segment ( i . e . KA = KB). 
Converse 
Theorem. 
I f any point (K) i s equidistant 
from 
the ends o f the segment (AB) ( i . e . i f KA - KB) then 
i t 
l i e s on the perpendicular b i s e c t o r o f the segment 
(AB). 
The proof o f the f i r s t o f these theorems i s very simple 
and widely known, accordingly I do not present i t here. 
The second o f these theorems (the converse) may be re-
placed* by the inverse, formulated in the following way: 
" I f some point (K) does not l i e on the perpendicular b i -
sector (MN) o f the segment AB, then i t i s not 
equidistant 
from the ends o f t h i s segment ( i . e . 
KA^KB)". 
Proof. 
Let AP == PB (Fig. 17)- 
We drop a perpendicular 
from the point K onto AB. 
Let R be the point o f inter-
s e c t i o n o f t h i s perpendicular with the l i n e AB. 
By 
hypothesis, the point R and the point P (the mid-point o f 
segments AB) are two d i f f e r e n t points and t h i s means that 
either AR > RB, 
o r RB>AR. 
We consider the 
f i r s t 
assumption: 
AR > RB; 
t h i s means that the p r o j e c t i o n o f 
l i n e KA i s greater than the p r o j e c t i o n o f l i n e KB, conse-

Fig. 17. 
Both these theorems (the d i r e c t and the converse o r 
the d i r e c t and the inverse) can be combined into one 
mathematical 
formulation: 
"In order that a point (K) be 
equidistant 
from two given points (A and B) i t i s neces-
sary and s u f f i c i e n t that i t l i e on the perpendicular b i -
s e c t o r o f the segment (AB) j o i n i n g these points". 
This assertion can be d i f f e r e n t l y formulated: 
"the 
perpendicular b i s e c t o r o f the segment AB contains a l l 
the 
points equidistant from the ends (A and B) o f this seg-
ment, and only such points (possessing t h i s property)". 
Thus the l i n e MN i s , as i t were, a base upon which l i e 
a l l the points possessing the defined property 
p ( o f 
being equidistant from the given p o i n t s ) , and which con-
tains only points possessing t h i s property: 
on t h i s l i n e 
there i s not one point which does not possess property p, 
65 
quently the oblique l i n e KA i t s e l f i s a l s o greater than 
KB. 
Further, in p r e c i s e l y the same way we prove that 
from the second assumption (RB > AR) i t follows that 
KB > KA, 
i. e . , that such an assumption in each case 
would not be j u s t i f i e d (and in each concrete case, as we 
have already shown, e i t h e r the f i r s t o f these assumptions 
or the second i s j u s t i f i e d by the stipulations o f the 
theorem), since i t would imply that KA does not equal KB. 

Direct and converse theorems 
66 
and outside t h i s l i n e there i s not one point possessing 
property p. 
This remarkable property o f the l i n e MN i s a l s o ex-
pressed in the following way: 
"The l o c u s o f a point 
equidistant 
from two given points i s the 
perpendicular 
b i s e c t o r o f the straight l i n e segment j o i n i n g these 
p o i n t s " . 
We have thus introduced a new term - "the locus o f a 
point". 
We now give i t an exact d e f i n i t i o n . 
A line 
(or a family of lines), 
a surface 
(or a family 
of surfaces) 
or a more general figure, 
which contains 
within itself 
all points 
possessing 
property 
a and only 
points 
possessing 
property 
a ( i . e . does not contain one 
point not possessing t h i s property) is known as the 
locus 
of a point possessing 
property 
a . 
Thus, the proof o f the fact that a figure i s the locus 
o f a point possessing property a must c o n s i s t o f the 
proof o f two theorems: 
the d i r e c t and the converse ( o r 
the d i r e c t and the inverse).

Consequently the

from the point

This condition i s necessary in order that the c i r c l e 
drawn from point P and lying between c i r c l e s I and I I 
touch these c i r c l e s . 
The question arises: 
i s t h i s con-
dition s u f f i c i e n t ? 
We shall prove further on that t h i s 
condition i s s u f f i c i e n t , 
i . e . , that any point on the 
c i r c l e drawn from point 0 with radius 
can serve as 
point P. 
We have considered the case when a c i r c l e with 
centre P i s touched by the given c i r c l e s at points 5 and 
F. 
We now consider the second p o s s i b l e combination: 
l e t 
the points o f contacts be S and Fy 
I w i l l not 
present 
t o draw a c i r c l e which would touch both c i r c l e s I and I I 
simultaneously. 
Proof. 
1) We assume that we have found the centre o f 
a c i r c l e which simultaneously touches both c i r c l e s I and 
II. 
Let the unknown centre be the point P. 
We examine 
what the d i s p o s i t i o n o f the point P must be with respect 
to c i r c l e s I and II. 
We know that the point o f contact 
o f two c i r c l e s l i e s on the l i n e o f their centres. 
In 
order to determine a l l the p o s s i b l e points o f contact o f 
o f a c i r c l e with centre P with the given c i r c l e s , we j o i n 
points 0 and P by a straight l i n e . 
The straight l i n e CP 
i n t e r s e c t s c i r c l e I at the points .S and Sy 
and c i r c l e 
II at the points F and Fy 
Thus a c i r c l e with centre P 
can be touched by c i r c l e s I and II at the points: 
a) 5 
and F o r b) .S and Fx or c ) Sx and F, o r d) Sx and F

We 
consider the f i r s t o f these assumptions. 
The points 5 
and F are the points o f contact o f a c i r c l e with 
centre 
P with c i r c l e s I and I I , and thus these points must belong 
to a c i r c l e with centre P. 
Since the points 0, F and 5

Uius in order that i t be p o s s i b l e t o draw a c i r c l e from 
the point P, touched by c i r c l e s I and I I 
simultaneously, 
i t i s necessary that point P l i e e i t h e r on c i r c l e III 
o r

We shall prove t h i s condition i s suf-

From some point P on c i r c l e III 
we draw a c i r c l e with 
radius 
and prove that t h i s c i r c l e i s touched by 
c i r c l e s I and I I . 
We j o i n point P t o point 0 by a 
straight l i n e . 
C i r c l e I I i n t e r s e c t s segment OP at 
the 
point F, and c i r c l e I - the segment O P produced - at 
the 
point .S. 
Because by construction 
OP-
and by 
hypothesis OF = r and OS = R, we have PF = 
PS 
i . e . the points F and .S l i e on a c i r c l e the centre o f 
which i s at the point P. 
Thus the point F belongs to 
c i r c l e I I and the c i r c l e with centre P, and moreover i t 
l i e s on the l i n e o f centres OP o f these c i r c l e s ; 
conse-
quently c i r c l e I I and the c i r c l e with centre P touch. 
P r e c i s e l y , by considering the d i s p o s i t i o n o f the point S, 
we find that the c i r c l e with centre P and c i r c l e I touch. 
Thus by taking as the centre an arbitrary point on c i r c l e

Analogously to this,

I t i s further necessary f o r us to verify that, in fact,

Direct and converse theorems 
The concept o f a l o c u s i s often used to define various 
figures. 
Thus, we say that a c i r c l e i s the l o c u s o f 
points equidistant 
from a given point, known as the 
centre. 
This means that, by d e f i n i t i o n , on a c i r c l e l i e 
all the points equidistant from i t s centre, and only points 
possessing t h i s property l i e on the c i r c l e . 
A c y l i n d e r 
may be defined as the l o c u s o f parallel 
l i n e s 
(generators) 
intersecting some curve (the d i r e c t r i x ) - 
A cone i s 
the 
locus o f the straight l i n e s passing through some defined 
point (the vertex) and i n t e r s e c t i n g some curve (the 
d i r e c t r i x ) . 
I turn your attention to the l a s t two e x -
amples. 
In them we referred to the locus o f 
( s t r a i g h t ) 
l i n e s and not o f points. 
Such a l o c u s i s not a l i n e but 
a surface. 
Essentially, 
as the reader has, no doubt, 
already noticed, the locus o f a point possessing property 
a 
i s simply another term f o r the concept "the s e t o f 
points possessing property 
a". 
This l a t t e r concept i n -
corporates both the locus o f l i n e s , since a l i n e i s none 
other than a set o f points, and a set o f separate (or, 
as 
i s said " i s o l a t e d " ) points and even a set c o n s i s t i n g o f 
one point; 
t h i s concept a l s o incorporates the empty set. 
Owing t o t h i s the l a t t e r d e f i n i t i o n o f the l o c u s o f a 
point embraces a far more generalized c l a s s o f cases, or, 
as i s said, 
embraces a c l a s s o f wider d e f i n i t i o n , 
than 
that given in the t e x t book by A.P. Kiselev. 
To i l l u s t r a t e what has been said we consider as an 
example the l o c u s o f the points which l i e in the plane N 
and are o f distance R unit lengths from some p o i n t A. 
I f 
the point A l i e s in the plane N then the l o c u s sought i s , 
as has already been said, a c i r c l e with centre A and 
radius R. 
I t becomes more involved when the point A l i e s 
outside the plane N. 
In this case l e t B be the p r o j e c -
tion o f the point A onto the plane N, and l e t AB - h unit 
lengths. 
In such a case the locus sought i s a c i r c l e 
with centre B and radius

Finally i f / * > / ? ,

t h i s case, there i s no point in the plane N, o f distance 
R from the point A. (cf. problem 54)-

Find the locus o f points at which a given 
c i r c l e subtends a given angle o ( i . e . the locus o f points

§13. 
Tbe Law of Reciprocity 
We examine the following four theorems: 
1) I f an element m o f the set M possesses property oc , 
then i t possesses property p . 
2) I f an element m o f the jset M possesses property a , 
then i t possesses property 
p. 
3) I f an element m o f the set M possesses property 
p, 
then i t possesses property 
a, 
4) I f an element m o f the set M possesses property p , 
then i t possesses property a . 
I t i s e a s i l y seen that i f we take the f i r s t o f these 
theorems as the d i r e c t one, then the second will be the 
inverse, the third the converse, and the fourth the in-
verse converse. 
We have already said that i f the 
f i r s t 
two o f these theorems are true, then the l a s t two theor-
ems are a l s o true (see § 8 ) , i t being unnecessary to 
prove the v a l i d i t y o f these l a t t e r theorems. 
We now see 
i f we can generalize t h i s remarkable connexion which 
e x i s t s between the f i r s t two theorems and the l a t t e r 
ones converse to them. 
We assume that the elements of the set M can 
possess 
one and only one of the three properties 
o l v a 2. a 3 and one 
and only one of the properties 
Pi. P2. P3. 
We assume, 
moreover, 
that the following 
three theorems are 
valid: 
1) If an element m of the set M possesses 
property

then it 
possesses 
property 
pt . 
2) If an element m of set M possesses 
property

then it possesses 
property 
p2 .

3) If an element m of set M possesses 
property 
a 3, 
then 
it possesses 
property 
p3 . 
In such a case I assert 
tliat the converse 
theorems must 
also be valid: 
I) If an element m of set M possesses 
property 
pj , 
then it possesses 
property 
ax. 
II) If an element m of set M possesses 
property 
p2 , 
tfien it possesses 
property 
a 2 . 
III) 
If an element m of set M possesses 
property 
p 3 , 
then it possesses 
property 
a 3 . 
This assertion i s known as the law of 
reciprocity. 
Before proving the v a l i d i t y o f the stated assertion I 
shall i l l u s t r a t e i t by an example. 
The p r o p e r t i e s 
"greater than", "equal t o " and "less than" serve f o r the 
most part as the three mutually exclusive p r o p e r t i e s a l f 
a 2, a 3. We consider the c o l l e c t i o n o f theorems. 
1) Of two oblique l i n e s drawn from one and the same 
point to a straight l i n e , the greater i s the one whose 
projection onto t h i s straight l i n e i s the greater.

I t i s somewhat more complex, but better, to take

But i t i s necessary to

Therefore element 
m£M 
must possess property

Thus, theorem I i s proved. 
Theorems I I and I I I 
are 
proved in p r e c i s e l y the same way. 
In the formulation o f the law o f r e c i p r o c i t y we assumed 
that the properties alt a2, a 3 were incompatible, i . e . 
that 
an element o f the set M could possess only one o f the

CHAPTER 
I I 
THE ELEMENTS OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC 
§ 14. 
Introduction 
It i s well known to the reader that in algebra oper-
ations upon numbers are replaced by operations upon l e t t e r s . 
Letters in algebra replace either any, o r some particular, 
numbers. 
The words "plus" , "minus" 
"over" and so on 
are replaced in algebra by the concise sign-symbols: +, 
-
: (or / ) and so on. 
using algebraic notation 
the 
sentence "the square o f a sum equals the sum o f squares 
o f the components plus twice their product" can be w r i t -
ten c o n c i s e l y thus: 
(a + 
^ )
2 = a
2-f-£
2-f-2ab. 
A c u b i c 
equation can be written thus: 
x
z-\-ax 
= b. But scholars 
only arrived at such a concise notation in the 18th cen-
tury. 
Tartaglia, 
finding a solution o f the cubic equa-
tion (1535), for example, wrote i t in the following way: 
"cube" ( %
3 ) * p (plus) some amount (a) " o f the thing" 
(x) 
equals a known "number" ( 6 ) . In the solution given the 
unknown (x) was named the "thing", 
the c o e f f i c i e n t 
(a) 
o f x was c a l l e d the "amount" o f the thing, 
and b was 
named a "number". 
Even by Vieta (1540-1603) with a some-
what improved algebraic symbolism, this equation was ex-
pressed in a f a i r l y complex fashion: 
cubus -H A planum X aequatur B solidou 
* The terms given in brackets have been added by the author to 
make understanding easier.

Direct and converse theorems 
Our pronouncements about e n t i t i e s and t h e i r properties 
(assertions and negations) r e c a l l the notation o f Tartag-
l i a . 
Even b r i e f formulations l i k e " i f entity a possesses 
property 
a, then i t possesses property |3 " have not got 
far away from the notation o f Vieta. 
The conclusions o f 
the previous chapter become far simpler, c l e a r e r and more 
graphical i f we e n l i s t the aid o f algebraic symbolism. 
The introduction o f algebraic notation in the f i e l d o f 
l o g i c started in the second h a l f o f the 17th century and 
l a t e r led to the emergence o f symbolic 
(or 
mathematical) 
l o g i c which i s now related to a number o f very intensi-
vely developing f i e l d s o f mathematics. 
[The founder o f the s c i e n c e o f l o g i c (that i s , s o -
c a l l e d formal l o g i c ) was the great ancient Greek p h i l o s o -
pher A r i s t o t l e (384-322 B . C ) . The idea o f the application 
o f the methods o f mathematics to l o g i c began to develop 
in the 17th century, e s p e c i a l l y in the work o f the German 
mathematician and philospher G.W. Leibnitz (1646-1716) 
who made the f i r s t attempt at the construction o f a l o g i -
cal calculus. 
However, mathematical 
l o g i c only emerged 
as a self-contained s c i e n t i f i c f i e l d in the middle o f 
the 19th century thanks to the work o f the English Mathe-
maticians G. Boole (1815-1864) and A. de Morgan (1806-
1878). 
B o o l e ' s f i r s t work "Mathematical Analysis o f 
L o g i c " 
came out in 1847. 
In that same year de Morgan 
published a paper on mathematical l o g i c . 
In London, in 
1854 B o o l e ' s main work "An Investigation o f the Laws o f 
Thought" came to l i g h t ; 
here he presented in detail 
his 
l o g i c a l c a l c u l u s . 
The German mathematician E. Schroder 
(the author o f the three-volume "Lectures on the Algebra 
o f L o g i c " , published in Leipzig in 1890-1905), 
the 
Russian mathematicians Platon Sergeevich Poretskii and 
others extended B o o l e ' s investigations. 
A new stage in 
the development o f mathematical 
l o g i c was opened by the 
work o f the German mathematician and l o g i c i a n Gottlob 
Prege (1848-1925), who, f o r the f i r s t time, applied

l o g i c t o the foundation o f mathematics 
("The Fundamental Laws o f Arithmetic" - two volumes, Jena, 
1893 and 1903). 
The work o f the English l o g i c i a n s 
B. Russell and A. Whitehead "Principia Mathematical 
(three volumes, 1910-1913), the work o f the German mathe-
matician D. Hilbert and his school, the investigations o f 
the Austrian mathematician K.H. Godel et a l . were of 
great value in the further development of mathematical 
l o g i c . 
The Soviet school of mathematical 
l o g i c 
( I . I . Zhegalkin, V . I . Glivenko, A.N. Kolmogorov, 
P.S. Novikov, A.A. Markov, D.A. Bochvar et a l . ) has pre-
sented an outstanding contribution in mathematico - 
l o g i -
cal investigations and i s , at the present time, one o f 
the foremost in the world. 
For outstanding 
s c i e n t i f i c 
discovery in the f i e l d o f mathematical 
l o g i c , 
Pyotr 
Sergeevich Novikov, Member-correspondent o f the Academy 
o f Sciences, was awarded the Lenin p r i z e in 1957. 
Mathematical l o g i c developed, on the one hand, as a 
result o f the application o f mathematical methods t o the 
problems o f formal l o g i c , and on the other as a d i s c i p l i n e 
serving the ends o f the foundations of mathematics. 
In 
the last two decades, mathematical l o g i c has received 
diverse technical a p p l i c a t i o n s . 
Contemporary mathematical 
l o g i c i s connected with automation, with machine mathematics 
and problems o f automatic translation from one language 
t o another, with information theory and generally with 
cybernetics. 
The methods o f mathematical

that part o f mathematical l o g i c which i s known as the 
propositional calculus i s the study o f propositions (state-
ments a s s e r t i o n s ) . The propositional calculus ( o r c a l c u l u s 
o f statements) i s the most elementary part o f mathematical 
l o g i c ; 
the mastery o f the propositional calculus i s a 
necessary condition for the study o f the more complex 
divisions o f this science. 
The following assertions w i l l serve as examples o f 
propositions 1) the diagonals of every rhombus are 
mutually perpendicular; 
2) sin x i s not greater than 1; 
3) the number 4 is odd; 
4) the circumference o f a c i r c l e 
of radius R equals 3R; 
5) 
is an odd number; 
6) A 
youth from whose chin hairs are growing is bearded; 
7) The angles o f any rectangle are right angles and i t s 
diagonals are mutually perpendicular; 
8) The angles o f 
a square are right angles and i t s diagonals are equal 
and mutually perpendicular; 
9) Angles whose s i d e s are 
perpendicular are equal or supplementary; 
10) I f a < b, 
then 6 < a. 
[We now consider the p e c u l i a r i t i e s o f these 
statements. 
In statements 3) and 5) the statement refers t o individual 
e n t i t i e s - the numbers 4 and y^2. 
Such statements are 
known in l o g i c as unitary or individual. 
In statements 
1 ) , 2 ) , 4 ) , 6 ) , 7 ) , 8 ) , 9) and 10) the assertions are o f 
a more general character. 
For example in statement 
1) we 
are referring t o the fact that the diagonals o f any given 
rhombus are mutually perpendicular and t o the fact that 
all 
rhombi possess the stated property. 
Statements 
7) and 8) resemble statement 
1) but from the 
l o g i c a l 
viewpoint d i f f e r from i t in the fact that they are com-
pound (complex) for they consist o f two statements each 
o f which is, l i k e statement 
1 ) , simple (see below). 
The 
p e c u l i a r i t y o f statement 
9) is that t h i s statement 
i s 
one in which we are concerned with pairs o f e n t i t i e s , 
i t s meaning can otherwise be conveyed by the proposition: 

Elements of mathematical logic 
"any pair o f angles possessing mutually perpendicular 
sides are distinguished by the fact that the angles in-
cluded in the given pair are equal or supplementary". 
In 
statements 1) and 7) are words which indicate the general 
character o f the proposition ("any", "every"). 
In 
examples 8) and 9) the general character o f the statements 
is apparent from t h e i r meanings. 
The same a l s o applies 
for statement 6) which, as i s obvious, incorporates the 
assertion "every youth, from whose chin hairs are grow-
ing, i s bearded". 
Words indicating the l o g i c a l form o f 
the statement 
( " a l l " , "every", "any", "some" et a l i a ) , 
can be omitted in everyday speech i f the l o g i c a l form i s 
made apparent more or l e s s uniquely by the sense of the 
statement and i t s general context. 
In mathematical 
l o g i c 
the l o g i c a l structure o f expressions i s fixed precisely 
with the aid o f symbols. 
Statement 2) a l s o bears a general character. 
Its 
meaning i s that " f o r any ( r e a l ) number x, sin x is not 
greater than one". 
In t h i s statement the l e t t e r "x" is 
a symbol o f a s p e c i a l type, known as a variable. 
In 
mathematics variables are used in several ways. 
In 
statements l i k e statement 2) they serve as an expression 
o f generality. 
In such cases the variable is used for 
the communication o f the information that for any entity 
(of that region o f e n t i t i e s which we are considering) the 
statement which contains t h i s variable is true. 
Vari-
ables turn up in just such a r o l e in the formulae expres-
sing the laws o f commutativity, a s s o c i a t i v i t y and d i s t r i -
butivity in ordinary algebra (see below, p. 105). The use 
o f the variables R, a and b in statements 4) and 10) which 
are o f a general character (the last o f them, moreover, 
i s a compound statement) has j u s t such a meaning. 
The use o f the symbols "*", "y", " z " and s o on in 
equations has another meaning. 
We take, 
f o r example, the 
following equation: x^-12x-28 = 0. 
By no means does t h i s 
85 

Direct and converse theorems 
contain the assertion that, under the replacement 
o f the 
l e t t e r x by any number (of the number f i e l d being con-
sidered, 
e.g. the f i e l d o f real numbers), we w i l l 
obtain 
a true statement every time - a true identity. 
And t h i s 
is e n t i r e l y understandable, for there e x i s t numbers which 
do not satisfy 
this equation 
( i . e . do not turn i t into a 
valid i d e n t i t y ) , 
for example, the number 1: 
the s u b s t i -
tution of 1 for x gives the statement 1 - 1 2 . 1 - 2 8 = 0, 
i . e . 
-39 - 0 which is f a l s e . 
The equation x
2 - 1 2 x - 2 8 = 0 
in i t s e l f is neither true nor false, 
but i t becomes a 
true or a false statement under the substitution in place 
of x of numbers from the number f i e l d considered. 
The 
solution of the equation means the finding o f such num-
bers - o f the values o f the variable 
(or variables 
i f 
the 
equation contains several variables) which convert t h i s 
equation t o a true statement. 
In our example such num-
bers are 14 and - 2 ; 
for the equalities 
( i d e n t i t i e s ) 
14
2 - 12.14 - 28 = 0 and ( - 2 )
2 - 1 2 ( - 2 ) - 2 8 = 0 are true, 
as the reader may e a s i l y 
v e r i f y . 
Mathematical 
l o g i c distinguishes carefully 
between 
the 
different 
ways of using variables and f i x e s them with 
the 
aid o f a s p e c i a l symbolism.*] 
We now ask which o f these statements are valid, 
or what 
is the same thing, true, and which are invalid, 
f a l s e . Of 
the statements given 1) and 2) are true, while 3) and 4) 
are f a l s e . 
We cannot say whether statement 5) is true or 
false; 
we know what "an integer 
is odd" means**, 
but we

of using variables see A. Tarski, An introduction to logic 
and the methodology of the deductive sciences, chapter l: 
"On the usage of variables"; A. Church, Introduction to 
mathematical logic - the "introductory" section. 
We proceed from the following definition of an odd number: 
an integer is odd, if on dividing it by 2 the remainder is

true or false? Neither I nor the reader can reply to 
216 
this question. However, if one goes along to the Lenin Library 
and examines the book indicated, then it is possible to estab-
lish whether the given statement is true or false. Therefore, 
the indicated statement is subject to our examination. 
87 
do not know what "an i r r a t i o n a l number is odd" means. 
The question o f the truth of statement 6) a l s o presents 
us with some d i f f i c u l t y . 
A youth, 
upon whose chin hair 
is starting t o grow, is becoming bearded; 
he i s 
changing 
from unbearded t o bearded. 
Therefore, 
concerning the 
statement "a youth from whose chin hair i s growing, 
i s 
bearded" 
we can neither assert that i t i s false nor that 
it is true. 
We consider a more general statement: 
"en-
t i t y a possesses property 
a
W
e 
assume that the entity 
a at a given moment is changing, l o s i n g or gaining 
the 
property 
a. 
In such a case we can neither assert that 
our statement i s true, nor that i t is f a l s e . 
In these 
cases the laws of formal l o g i c with which we shall be 
concerned in t h i s book are not applicable. 
Below we 
shall only deal 
(without mentioning this further) 
with 
those statements for which i t is known that they 
are 
either true or f a l s e . * 
We now continue with the examination o f the statements 
c i t e d as examples. 
Statements 7) and 10) have, as we 
have seen, a more complex nature than statements 1) - 6 ) . 
They consist o f several statements connected by the 
con-
junctions and, 
or, 
if, 
tiien and so forth. 
Above we 
c a l l e d such statements compound statements. 
It 
should 
not be thought that there is an impassable gulf between 
simple and compound statements. 
The same sense can be 
expressed both by a simple and hy a compound (complex) 
statement. 

Direct and converse theorems 
88 
For example, the simple statement "sin x is not greater 
than 1" can be replaced by the statement "sin x is 
l e s s 
than or equal to 1"*. 
Such a replacement 
o f simple 
statements (propositions) by more complex ones is very 
often used in developing the conditions in a theorem 
(see 
c h . l § 2). 
For example, the theorem "in a parallelogram 
opposite sides are equal" is a simple statement. 
It 
can 
be replaced by the complex statement: 
" i f a quadrilateral 
is a parallelogram 
i t s opposite sides are equal". 
The 
difference between simple and complex statements concerns 
only the form o f these statements and not their 
content. 
We now turn, however, t o the complex statements c i t e d 
in examples 7) - 10). 
Some o f these statements may be 
true, others f a l s e . 
Thus, statements 7) and 10) are 
false and 8) and 9) are true. 
When I assert 
that a 
complex statement 
(e.g. 
statement 
9) is true this means 
that the whole of the complex statement 
is true. 
The 
separate statements entering into the composition o f the 
* Cine division of statements into the simple and the complex 
is relative. Thus in order to interpret the statement "sin 
x is less than or equal to 1" as complex, it is necessary 
to consider it as an abbreviation of the statement "six x 
is less than one or sin x equals one" which consists of two 
simple statements connected by the conjunction or. It is 
well known, however, that the relation "less than or equal 
to" in mathematics is often considered as a single relation 
(which finds its expression in the treatment of the symbol 
^ as a single symbol). With such an understanding of 
this relation the statement "sin x is less than or equal to 
1" must be considered as simple. On the other hand, the 
statement "sin x is not greater than one" can be considered 
as a complex statement (irrespective of the fact that it 
does not consist of several statements), since in this 
statement there is a negation (concerning negation see the 
following paragraph). Naturally statements exist which we 
would not hesitate to assign to one group or the other. 
Obviously, for example, the statement "2 is an even number" 
is simple. 1 

Elements of mathematical logic 
complex statement can be both true and f a l s e . 
Thus for 
any pair o f angles (not equal t o 90°) with mutually per-
pendicular sides one of the statements: 
a) "these angles 
are equal", b) "these angles are supplementary" i s true, 
and the other f a l s e . 
We have said that statement 10) i s 
false; 
in fact both the statements entering into i t s 
composition w i l l be false when the numbers a 
and 
6 
that 
we choose are equal. 
But for any pair o f unequal numbers 
one o f the statements a < 6 and b < a is true and the 
other f a l s e . 
It i s not by change that we have dwelt so long here on the 
question o f the truth and falsehood o f various statements. 
The question o f the truth and falsehood of various state-
ments i s the fundamental question with which we shall 
deal. 
In studying statements we shall not consider their 
content, t h e i r derivation, nor other very important prob-
lems, but we shall focus a l l our attention upon two 
questions only: 
1) How does 
the truth of some (well-defined) 
complex 
statement 
depend upon the truth of the simpler 
statements 
which enter 
into its 
constitution? 
2) How does 
the truth of some (or all) 
of the simple 
statements 
which make up a complex statement 
depend upon 
the truth of this complex statement 
and the truth of 
its 
remaining simple constituent 
statements? 
It i s p o s s i b l e t o state analogous problems t o those 
that we have j u s t presented in the arithmetic o f integers. 
We c i t e them in a very concrete formulation: 
1) To find the number o f inhabitants 
in a continent in 
which there are three countries i f the number o f inhabi-
tants o f these countries i s known. 
89 

Direct and converse theorems 
90 
2) The number of inhabitants in the entire continent 
i s known as well as those o f two countries o f this con-
tinent. 
What must the number of inhabitants of the third 
country be? 
However, by these examples the difference between arith-
metic and l o g i c is a l s o exposed. 
I f we wish t o set up 
well-defined numerical examples ( e . g . country A has 
50,093 inhabitants, 
country B has 203,457 inhabitants and 
country C has 15,461 inhabitants) 
then we can (at 
least 
t h e o r e t i c a l l y ) compose an i n f i n i t e set o f such problems. 
There can be an i n f i n i t e set of answers t o these problems 
(since, 
t h e o r e t i c a l l y , the number o f inhabitants o f the 
continent can be equal t o any integer, and the number o f 
integers is unbounded). 
We have an entirely 
different 
picture, however, in the calculus o f statements. 
Each 
statement therein considered can be either true or false, 
i . e . expressed in arithmetical 
language, can assume only 
two values. 
The answer, a complex statement, 
a l s o 
cannot assume more than two values. 
Therefore, from a 
f i n i t e number o f statements connected one with the other 
by a f i n i t e number of conjunctions and, or, 
if, 
then, and 
so on, i t is possible t o compose only a f i n i t e number o f 
problems and the d i s t i n c t 
answers 
t o a l l these problems 
can only be two: 
1) true or 2) false. 
Thus the calculus 
o f statements can be compared in the well known sense with 
binary 
arithmetic. 
[There are some d i f f i c u l t i e s connected with this question 
o f the l o g i c a l analysis o f statements which we are unable 
t o consider here. 
We merely note that in a thorough 
analysis, even o f such apparently uncomplicated statements 
as statements 1) - 10) presented above, n i c e t i e s emerge 
which we have actually by-passed in our exposition (one 
such nicety is related, 
for example, t o the d i f f i c u l t y , 
pointed out in a previous footnote, o f distinguishing 
simple and complex statements in ordinary c o l l o q u i a l 

Elements of mathematical logic 
§ 16. 
The Composition of Statements 
1) Prom a l l the statements d i f f e r i n g from X we shall 
pick out the contradictory statement t o X and we shall 
denote i t by X (read as not -X). 
This statement i s de-
fined in the following way: 
the statement 
X is known as 
the contradiction 
of statement 
X if X is false 
when X is 
true and X is true when X is false. 
Thus the 
contradictory 
91 
language). 
The admissibility o f the approach that we 
have adopted stems from the nature o f the calculus which 
i s under consideration (the s o - c a l l e d c l a s s i c a l two-valued 
calculus o f statements) in which we proceed from strongly 
i d e a l i z e d assumptions ( f o r example, of considering that 
each statement considered therein i s already made so 
precise that i t may be considered t o be either true or 
false and necessarily one o f the two). 
The whole history 
of mathematical 
l o g i c and i t s applications t o technology 
t e s t i f y t o the fact that such an i d e a l i z a t i o n i s not only 
admissible but a l s o extremely 
f r u i t f u l . ] 
We shall denote statements b r i e f l y by the l e t t e r s o f 
the l a t i n alphabet: 
X, Y, Z, U, V, — . 
In a given 
context or section d i s t i n c t l e t t e r s w i l l correspond t o 
d i s t i n c t statements and one and the same l e t t e r t o one and 
the same statement. 
Thus, by X we might understand the 
statement "the diagonals of any 
rhombus are 
mutually 
perpendicular"., 
by Y: 
"sin x is not greater than 1"; by 
Z: 
"the number 4 i s odd", e t c . 
We shall denote complex 
statements either by one of the l e t t e r s o f the latin 
alphabet, 
or by the l e t t e r s , corresponding t o the s t a t e -
ments constituting t h i s complex statement, connected by 
s p e c i a l signs, t o which we shall r e f e r in the next s e c -
t i o n . 

Direct and converse theorems 
* See below about the law establishing the synonymity of an 
assertion with (its) double negation. 
92 
statements t o the f i r s t three examples o f the 
previous 
paragraph (which we have already denoted by the l e t t e r s 
X, Y, Z), are the following: 
a) X: " i t is 
incorrect 
( i . e . 
f a l s e ) that the diagonals o f every rhombus are 
mutually perpendicular" or, in other words: 
"the diagon-
als are not mutually perpendicular for every rhombus" 
(which is equivalent t o the statement "there e x i s t s a 
rhombus such that i t s diagonals are not mutually 
perpen-
dicular" c f . p. 58; 
b) Y: " i t i s incorrect that sin x is 
not greater than 1" or, what is the same thing, "not for 
every (real) number x i s sin x not greater than 1" (which 
is synonymous with the statement "there e x i s t s a (real) x 
such that sin x is greater than 1"); 
c ) Z: 
" i t i s 
in-
c o r r e c t that the number 4 i s odd" , or otherwise: 
"the 
number 4 is not odd" which, in view of the equivalence of 
a double negation t o the 
( o r i g i n a l ) statement* i s 
synonymous with the_statement "the number 4 i s even" . 
The expressions X, Y e t c are usually read: 
not -X, 
not 
-Y e t c . 
It is obvious that the contradiction o f the statement 
X (statement X) is the statement X. 
2) A composition (connexion) o f two statements can be 
effected with the aid of the conjunction and. 
The state-
ment "in a rectangle the angles are right angles and the 
diagonals are equal" c o n s i s t s of two statements j o i n e d by 
the conjunction and. 
Such a connexion of the two s t a t e -
ments X and Y we shall denote by the symbol & (an abbre-
viation o f the latin word "et" - and). 
Thus X & Y de-
notes: 
X and Y. 
The statement 
X & Y is true if and only 
if both of the statements 
X and Y are true. 
In other 
words, in order that the whole statement X & Y be false, 
i t is s u f f i c i e n t that just one of the statements X and Y 

Elements of mathematical logic 
be f a l s e . 
For example, the statement "in a rhombus 
a l l 
the s i d e s are equal and the angles between the 
diagonals 
equal 4 5 ° " i s f a l s e , 
because one o f i t s two component 
statements i s f a l s e and thesa statements are j o i n e d by the 
conjunction and *. 
3) A composition o f two statements can be e f f e c t e d by 
the conjunction or. 
As we have already remarked in 
the 
footnote 
on 
p. 15, the conjunction o r in usual lan-
guage has an ambiguous l o g i c a l meaning. 
The 
assertion 
"X or Y is true" 
can mean one of two things: 
1) one and 
only one of the 
two statements 
X, Y is 
true, 
i . e . 
i f X i s 
true then Y i s f a l s e , 
and conversely i f Y i s true then X 
i s f a l s e ; 
i f or i s t o have t h i s meaning we shall 
r e f e r 
t o the double or (more b r i e f l y t o eitiier 
- o r ) ; 
2) At 
least 
one of the two statements 
X and Y is true; 
the 
other statement i s true or false indiscriminately 
in t h i s 
case; 
i f or i s t o have t h i s second meaning then we s h a l l 
r e f e r t o the simple 
(single) 
or **. 
In order t o 
c l a r i f y 
t h i s diverse nature o f the meaning o f the word o r , we 
consider the following two examples: 
a) "In the parallelogram ABCD, the diagonals o f which

or separative 
or) is often known as 
the strict 
(rigid)

b) "In the triangle ABC the angle A or the angle B i s 
acute". 
In the f i r s t example, only one o f the angles, either A 
or B can and must be acute. 
Both angles A and B cannot 
be acute simultaneously, 
since in t o t a l they must be 180°. 
Or in the f i r s t example is 
double. 
We now pass on t o the second example. 
In any 
t r i a n g l e 
there are at least two acute angles. 
These angles can 
a l s o be both of the angles A and B. 
The sentence "In 
triangle ABC angle A or B is acute" means that angle A i s 
acute and B is obtuse (or a right-angle), 
or that angle B 
i s acute and angle A is obtuse (or a r i g h t - a n g l e ) , or that 
both angles A andB are acute. Or in t h i s example is 
simple. 
The l o g i c a l double and simple o r need not necessarily 
c o i n c i d e with the s y n t a c t i c double and simple or. 
For 
example, in the sentence "in a convex pentagon angle A, or 
angle B, or angle C or angle D i s obtuse" or is l o g i c a l l y 
simple; 
and in the sentence " L.ABC (a particular 
angle, 
e.g. that in Pig. 8 o f the book by G. G. Tseiten "The 
history o f mathematics in ancient and medieval times" ) i s 
acute, obtuse or a right-angle" or is l o g i c a l l y double. 
In the propositional calculus a simple or i s c h i e f l y 
used. 
We shall denote i t by the symbol V - 
Thus, 
X\JY 
means "X or Y" . 
The proposition 
X\/Y 
is true in the 
following 
cases: 
when X is true and Y is false, 
when X 
is false 
and Y is true, 
and when X and Y are both 
true. 
The propositionX\/Y 
is false only if Xand Y are both 
false. 
The double or we shall denote by the symbol V V •

angles of the parallelogram, adjacent to one and the same side.

Elements of mathematical logic 
we have already said, 
the proposition 
Xy\/Y 
(read: 
"either 
X, or Y") is true when one and. only one of 
the 
propositions 
X and Y is 
true. 
4) Two statements can be connected by the link if 
-
then. 
We s h a l l denote t h i s connective by the symbol —> . 
The formula X-+Y 
should be read thus: 
"if X, then Y" . 
We encounter the combination if 
- then in every theorem: 
in i t statement X serves as the condition and Y as the 
conclusion. 
We shall 
consider 
the statement 
X—*~Y true 
if X and Y are both true, 
or if statement 
X is false; 
we 
shall 
consider 
the statement 
X - * T false 
if statement Y 
is false 
at the same time as X is 
true*. 
Such a d e f i n i t i o n o f the truth and falsehood o f the 
statement X-+-Y corresponds exactly t o our notion o f the 
truth and falsehood o f theorems. 
For example, 
the 
theorem " I f the sum o f the ciphers o f some number i s 
d i v i s i b l e by 9, then t h i s number is d i v i s i b l e by 3", 
as 
i s known from arithmetic, 
i s true. 
This assertion 
(about the truth o f the given theorem) means the 
f o l l o w -
ing: 
1) for every number for which the assertion that 
i t s ciphers are d i v i s i b l e by 9 is v a l i d ( i . e . X t r u e ) , 
the assertion that t h i s number i s d i v i s i b l e by 3 is a l s o 
v a l i d ( i . e . Y is true). 
2) We are not able t o say any-
thing concerning the d i v i s i b i l i t y by 3, 
( i . e . the truth 
o f Y) o f numbers for which the sum o f the ciphers i s not 
d i v i s i b l e by 9 ( i . e . X i s f a l s e ) : 
such a number may be 
d i v i s i b l e by 3 ( e . g . 240) or not d i v i s i b l e by 3 ( e . g . 241) 
( i . e . 
Y may be true or f a l s e ) . 
We now consider an 
example o f an invalid theorem: 
" i f a number ends in the 
cipher 2, then i t is d i v i s i b l e by 7". 
The assertion that 
The operation 
of the propositional calculus, which 
reflects the usage of the conditional combination if - then 
in ordinary speech, is known in mathematical logic as impli 
cation. 
95 

Direct and converse theorems 
this theorem i s invalid (that statement X —• Y is false) 
means that i t i s possible t o find a number ( e . g . 202) such 
that i t ends in the cipher 2, but is not d i v i s i b l e by 
seven ( i . e . that Y i s false while X i s t r u e ) . 
Thus the truth o f the statement X—*Y i s related t o the 
truth o f statements X and Y in the following way: 
I f X i s true and Y is true, then X-+ K i s true. 
I f X i s true and Y is false, then X-+ K i s false. 
I f X is false and Y i s true, then X-+ Y is true. 
I f X i s false and Y i s false, then 
Y i s true*. 
* It is possible to make the following observation about the 
statements A' & Y, X\JY, X-+Y, X+-+Y (see below): at the 
moment the statements interest us solely in terms of the 
relationship between them which is the determined hy their 
truth or falsehood; for the assertion that statement X and 
Y (or statement X\jY, X-+Y, 
is true or false we shall 
be guided only by the question of the truth or falsehood of 
statements X and Y and by the rules given in this paragraph; 
the question of the meaning of some complex statement or 
other does not interest us at this stage. For example, the 
statement "if snow is black, then on February 15th, 1961 
there will be a total solar eclipse visible from the terri-
tory of the USSR is true because the statement: "there will 
be a total solar eclipse visible from the territory of the 
USSR on February 15th, 1951" is true. The statement "If the 
Volga flows into the Caspian Sea, then five fives are ten" 
is false, because 5 x 5 ^ 10 and the Volga does flow into 
the Caspian Sea. A similar connexion is also encountered in 
ordinary speech, where it is usually realized hy the con-
nective as-as. 
Thus, it is said, for example: "it is as 
obvious as twice two is four", where it is understood that 
the word it has nothing in common with the multiplication of 
two hy two. The reader can easily satisfy himself that the 
connective as-as is equivalent (with regard to question of 
truth or falsehood) to the connective if - then (or the con-* 
nective if - then, and vice versa) and, therefore, there is 
no point in introducing it in symbolic logic.

I d i r e c t the reader's attention t o one result which 
follows from t h i s d e f i n i t i o n o f the statement X-+Y: 
in 
order that the statement 
X~>Y 
be true, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
that statement 
X be false. 
This result corresponds to a 
very important law in l o g i c which can be formulated thus: 
starting 
from an incorrect 
assumption, 
it 
is possible 
to 
arrive 
at a correct 
or an incorrect 
conclusion, 
which-
ever you please. 
This law i s not usually completely 
understood by students. 
Therefore I shall i l l u s t r a t e 
i t 
by the solution o f two problems. 
First problem. 
Find the angle between the diagonals 
o f the rectangle ABCD, i f the lengths o f two o f i t s 
sides 
are known: 
AB = BC - 5 cm. 
Solution: 
Since the diagonals o f a rectangle 
are 
mutually perpendicular the required angle equals 90°. 
Second problem: 
Find the angle between the diagonals 
o f the rectangle 
ABCD i f the lengths o f two o f i t s 
sides 
are known: AB « 5 cm, BC = 5 ^3 
cm. 
Solution: 
Since the diagonals o f a rectangle 
are 
mutually perpendicular, 
the required angle equals 90°. 
In the s o l u t i o n o f both problems we started from the 
same incorrect assumption ( f a l s e statement): 
"the 
diagonals o f a rectangle are mutually perpendicular" . We 
see that t h i s assumption can lead us t o a c o r r e c t con-
c l u s i o n (problem 1 ) , or t o an i n c o r r e c t one (problem 2 ) . 
5) We now pass on t o the consideration o f the connexion 
expressed by the words if - then, and vice versa. 
It 
i s 
denoted by the symbol <—• ( o r s ^ ) . 
We shall 
consider 
the 
statement 
X+—+Y true, 
if X and Y are both true or both 
false; 
we shall 
consider 
the statement 
X<—•K false 
if 
either 
X is true while Y is false, 
or Y is true while X 

Direct and converse theorems 
is false. 
Any combination o f d i r e c t and converse theo-
rems i s a statement o f the form X<+> Y. 
We consider, for example, the proposition: 
" i f the 
sum o f the d i g i t s o f some number i s d i v i s i b l e by 3, then 
the number i t s e l f i s d i v i s i b l e by 3, and conversely, i f 
some number i s d i v i s i b l e by 3, then the sum o f the 
d i g i t s 
of this number i s a l s o d i v i s i b l e by 3" . 
The assertion 
that this proposition i s correct, means that both the 
direct and the converse theorems which make up t h i s 
proposition are c o r r e c t . 
A proposition o f t h i s type 
would be incorrect i f the d i r e c t or the converse theorem 
or both o f them together were i n c o r r e c t . 
Therefore 
i t 
is entirely natural t o replace the statement X*-+ Y by 
the statement 
X). 
The dependence o f the 
truth and falsehood o f the statements X-+ Y 
and K~>Af 
upon the truth and falsehood o f the statements X and Y 
is found from the table below. 
Thus, the statement X+-+ Y i s true i f statements X 
and Y are both true or both f a l s e ; 
the statement X+-+ Y 
is false i f one of the statements X or Y i s true while 
the other is false.

Equipollence 
We consider once again the combination X*-*> Y. I f

statement X+-+ Y i s true, then either statements X and 
Y are both true or they are both f a l s e . 
We s h a l l c a l l

We assume that we have two complex statements A and B, 
each o f which c o n s i s t s of some ( f i n i t e number o f ) s t a t e -

we have considered. 
We shall substitute in place o f the

following: 
"The diagonals o f a rectangle are equal" , 
"the sum o f the angles o f a t r i a n g l e equals 9 0 ° " and so 
on. 
In t h i s case one o f two things may happen: 
either 
for every such substitution the statement A<+-+B 
becomes 
true; 
or f o r every such substitution the statement 
A<~+B 
becomes f a l s e ; 
or for some substitutions 
A+-+B 
becomes true, and f o r others, 
f a l s e .

in l o g i c a 
algebra equipollent statements can be substituted one for

* An equipollence is a pair of formulae connected by the sign 
S E . 
For the readier distinction of these formulae (the 
left and right-hand sides of the equipollence) they should 
be enclosed in brackets. In this case, for instance, 
equipollence (2) assumes the form 
(XY)±EE((X-+Y) 
&(Y-+>X)).

We have indicated the analogy which e x i s t s between equations 
and i d e n t i t i e s on the one hand and equivalence and equipollence 
on the other. 
We shall now indicate the difference b e -
tween them. 
In algebra an equality cannot be replaced, 
under any transformation, 
by several 
(other) 
operations 
(addition, multiplication, 
raising t o a power, e t c . ) . 
In 
l o g i c a l algebra equivalence 
(«—>) can be replaced by 
other connections, among which are the connections and 
(&), or 
and negation*; 
the connections and and or, 
as w i l l be explained below, play the parts o f the rules 
o f addition and multiplication 
in symbolic l o g i c . 
In ordinary algebra there is the axiom: 
" i f 
a — b and 
b = c> then a — c " . 
A similar proposition a l s o occurs 
in l o g i c a l algebra, 
namely: 
Rule I. 
If 
A ^ B 
and B*=+C. 
then 
A^C. 
In fact, 
i f A i s true then, in virtue of the assertion 
A+E+B, 
B must be true, and thus C a l s o (in virtue o f 
the assertion 
B*E±C) 
must be true. 
Thus i f A i s true 
then C i s a l s o true. 
Similar reasoning proves that i f A

"or" 
possesses 
a distributive 
proper 
ty relative 
to the connective 
"and". 
In virtue o f this 
analogy t o algebra we s h a l l c a l l the statement X & Y a 
logical 
sum, and X V Y a logical 
product. 
We agree, 
in 
the absence o f brackets, 
f i r s t o f a l l t o combine s t a t e -
ments by the conjunction or and t o combine by the con-
junction end only the complex statements obtained in t h i s 
way, i . e . first 
of all 
(in 
the absence of brackets) 
to 
multiply 
the statements 
and only then to sum the 
products 
so obtained. 
Under t h i s condition we shall have in 
l o g i c a l algebra the same multiplication law f o r polynomi-
a l s (more c o r r e c t l y , sums) as in ordinary algebra. 
We 
105 

Direct and converse theorems 
can reinforce this analogy with ordinary algebra by 
agreeing t o omit the sign ( V ) for l o g i c a l 
multiplication, 
in the same way as in ordinary algebra we omit the dot 
( . ) . 
However, further equipollences connecting l o g i c a l sum 
with l o g i c a l product have nothing in common with 
ordinary 
algebra. 
In order t o obtain these equipollences we note 
that X & Y i s true i f and only i f both X and Y are true, 
and XY i s f a l s e i f and only i f both X and Y are 
f a l s e . 
Consequently XY is true i f and only i f both X and Y are 
f a l s e . 
But when X it|_true, X i s f a l s e ; 
when Y i s true 
Y i s f a l s e and thus XY i s true i f and only i f X and Y 
are true. 
The l a t t e r a s s e r t i o n proves t o us that 
X&Y^XY. 
(8) 
Using Rule II and equipollence (1) we can substitute t h i s 
equipollence by the 
following: 
^ 4 K s W h A T . 
( 8 ' ) 
Equipollences (8) and ( 8 ' ) are e a s i l y v e r i f i e d in j u s t 
the same way as we v e r i f i e d equipollences 
( 3 ) - ( 7 ) . 
The statement X&Y<E5*XY 
i s true f o r any statements 
X and Y. 
Therefore, i t must remain true a f t e r weJiave 
replaced statements X and Y by statements X and Y. 
Per-
forming this substitution, we find that 
X&Y^XY. 
Because o f equipollence ( 1 ) , we obtain: 
XY^X&Y. 
<

Using rule II and equipollence ( 1 ) , equipollence (9) 
106 

Elements of mathematictil logic 
may be rewritten 
thus: 
XY^X&Y. 
( 9 ' ) 
In the derivation o f equipollences (9) and ( 9 ' ) we did 
not reason about the truth and falsehood o f the statements 
which occurred in i t s l e f t and right-hand s i d e s : 
we 
derived these equipollences from e a r l i e r ones, 
the 
v a l i d i t y o f which had been v e r i f i e d with the aid o f 
transformations similar t o those which we ordinarily use 
in algebra. 
However, such a derivation in no way detracts 
from the v a l i d i t y o f these equipollences. 
We could, o f 
course, confirm the v a l i d i t y by the ordinary method. 
But 
this would be superfluous. 
We now i l l u s t r a t e equipollences ( 9 ' ) and ( 8 ' ) by exam-
ples. 
Let statement X mean "the diagonals o f the quadri-
l a t e r a l ABCD are equal" and statement Y mean: "the diag-
onals o f ABCD are mutually perpendicular". 
Then the 
statement X & Y w i l l be "the diagonals o f quadrilateral 
ABCD are equal and mutually perpendicular". 
The statement contradictory t o t h i s can be formulated 
thus: 
" i t i s incorrect that the diagonals o f quadri-
lateral ABCD are equal and mutually perpendicular" 
which, as i s c l e a r , i s synonymous with the statement 
"the 
diagonals o f quadrilateral 
ABCD are not equal or not 
mutually perpendicular". 
It i s c l e a r that t h i s _ l a s t statement can be written 
symbolically thus: 
X Y. 
We have here an example which 
i l l u s t r a t e s the equipollence X& Y+=*xv 
We now form 
the statement XYt expressed thus: 
"the diagonals o f the 
quadrilateral 
ABCD are equal or mutually perpendicular". 
The statement XY, contradictory t o t h i s w i l l be: 
" i t 
i s 
incorrect that the diagonals o f the quadrilateral ABCD 
are equal or mutually perpendicular" 
which i s synonymous 
107

108 
with the statement "the diagonals of quadrilateral ABCD 
are neither equal, nor mutually perpendicular" 
( i . e . 
with the statement "the diagonals o f quadrilateral ABCD 
are not equal_and_are not mutually perpendicular"), which 
has the form A & B. 
Thus 
XY^X&Y. 
Equipollences ( 8 ' ) and ( 9 ' ) can be extended t o the case 
o f any number o f statements. 
We shall prove equipollence 
( 8 ' ) for three statements: X, Y and Z . 
For t h i s we denote 
the complex statement X & Y by the l e t t e r V. 
Then in 
virtue of formula ( 8 ' ) we shall have 
X&Y&Z^UWz» 
UZ. 
From the d e f i n i t i o n o f statement U i t follows that 
i t 
may be replaced by the statement X & Y. 
Consequently

We have proved the v a l i d i t y o f equipollence (8a) for

Further, we have proved the v a l i d i t y o f t h i s 
equipollence f o r n on the assumption o f i t s v a l i d i t y n - 1 ) . 
Ipso facto we have proved that our equipollence i s v a l i d 
for any n. 
In analogous fashion the 
equipollence 
XiXt 
. . . Xn^XnStXt&Xt&

(9a) 
can a l s o be proved. 
We have already stated that in l o g i c a l algebra, 
in 
analogy with ordinary algebra, 
there i s a d i s t r i b u t i v e 
law o f l o g i c a l multiplication 
r e l a t i v e t o l o g i c a l addi-
t i o n . 
But unlike ordinary algebra, 
in logical 
algebra 
there 
is also a distributive 
law of 
logical 
addition 
relative 
to logical 
multiplication, 
i . e . there i s an 
equipollence. 
X& YZ±=E(X& 
Y)(X&Z). 
(10) 
We now prove t h i s . 
Equipollence (7) i s a true statement 
for any values o f the statements X, Y, Z . 
Therefore, we 
can replace statements^ X, Y, Z, in t h i s equipollence by 
the statements X, Y, Z; 
then applying rule II we arrive 
at an equipollence o f the form 
JC(Y&lZ)^XY&XZ.

(X& Y) (X& Z), 
and consequently 
X&YZ^(X&Y)(X&Z). 
We i l l u s t r a t e the latter equipollence by an example. The 
statement "we shall go boating on our next day o f f and 
the f i r s t or second o f May" i s equipollent to the state-
ment "we shall go boating on our next day o f f and the 
f i r s t o f May or on our next day o f f and the second o f 
May". 
The equipollences that we have derived indicate 
the 
dependence which e x i s t s between the connectives &, y , 
"\ 
We shall now prove that the remaining connectives, 
namely: — * (if 
- then),+—*-(if 
- then and vice 
versa), 
and y y 
(either 
- or) can a l s o be reduced to the con-
nectives &, y , 
(and consequently, 
t o two o f them*). 
We consider the statement X-^Y* 
It i s false i f and 
only i f X i s true and Y is f a l s e . 
We r e c a l l that the 
statement XY i s f a l s e i f and only i f bothji 
and Y are 
false, and, c o n s e q u e n t l y u the statement XY is false i f 
only i f X i s true ( i . e . X i s f a l s e ) and Y is 
f a l s e . 
* [In this case, negation must necessarily be included in these 
two connectives; in other words, the two connectives (out of 
the connectives &, \J , ~) to which the connectives-«->,->and 
y y can be reduced are either the pair &, ~ or the pair 
110 
We transform both sides of this l a t t e r equipollence, 
using equipollences ( 9 ' ) and ( 8 ' ) and the convolution o f 
double negation. 
We obtain 

Elanents of mathematical logic 
Therefore 
X-+ 
Y^XY. 
(11) 
In virtue o f equipollence (9) we can a l s o write 
X-+Y^X&Y. 
(12) 
The content o f these equipollences i s readily 
i l l u s -
trated by any theorem; 
we take, 
for example, the theorem 
" I f the quadrilateral ABCD i s a rhombus, then a c i r c l e 
can be inscribed within i t . " 
This theorem i s a statement 
o f the_ form Jf-> Y. It can be replaced either by the s t a t e -
ment XY: 
"the quadrilateral 
ABCD i s not a rhombus or a 
c i r c l e can be inscribed in i t " , 
or by the statement X& K, 
" i t is impossible for quadrilateral ABCD t o be a rhombus 
and at the same time f o r i t t o be impossible t o i n s c r i b e 
a c i r c l e in i t " . 
Such a formulation appears at 
f i r s t 
sight t o be both ponderous and unnecessary. 
However, when 
we consider i t carefully, 
i t appears that we very often 
make use o f i t : 
the proof 
of the incorrectness 
of a 
theorem (the statement 
X-+Y) 
usually 
reduces 
to the 
proof 
of the falsehood 
of the statement 
X & Y i.e. 
to 
the proof 
of the truth of the statement 
X & Y. 
Thus f o r 
example, on p. 28 we proved that the theorem "a quadri-
l a t e r a l with mutually *perpendicular diagonals i s a rhom-
bus" i s incorrect. 
In t h i s case we did, in fact, prove 
the following: 
i t i s p o s s i b l e t o construct_a 
quadri-
l a t e r a l ABCD for which the statement (X & 7) "the dia-
gonals o f quadrilateral 
ABCD are mutually 
perpendicular 
and ABCD i s not a rhombus" , is true. 
Hence we con-
cluded that the statement (X—*-Y) " i f the diagonals o f 
quadrilateral 
ABCD are mutually perpendicular, 
then 
t h i s quadrilateral i s a rhombus" 
is f a l s e . 
We now prove the equipollence 
X-+ Y 
(13) 
111 

Direct and converse theorems 
112 
To t h i s end, we replace statements X and Y in e q u i p o l -
lence (12) by the statements F and X. 
We find that 
Y-+X^Y&X. 
Using rule I and equipollences (1) and ( 8 ' ) » we obtain 
7-* X s F i X g f X « *K. 
Consequently, 
in virtue o f rule II and equipollence (11) 
we find that 
X-+ 
Y^Y-+X. 
I shall not c i t e any examples i l l u s t r a t i n g t h i s equi-
p o l l e n c e . 
This equipollence expresses the synonymity o f 
the d i r e c t and the inverse converse theorems t o which we 
referred 
in Chapter I. 
I f we replace X and Y in equipollence (13) by Y and X 
respectively we obtain 
Y-+X3=±X 
-+Y. 
( 1 3 ' ) 
This equipollence expresses the synonymity o f the converse 
and the inverse 
theorems. 
We now pass on t o the connective o f equivalence. 
We 
have already stated that 
X*-*Y~(X~* 
Y)&(Y-*X). 
In virtue o f the commutative property of l o g i c a l addition, 
we write 
X*-+ Y^(Y-+X)&(X-+

The statement X+-+ Y can be formulated in the form o f a 
theorem: " i f entity r possesses property 
a, then i t 
a l s o possesses property 
|3, and conversely, i f entity r 
possesses property 
(J, then i t possesses property

I leave i t t o the reader t o formulate the statement 
Y+-+X. 
It is c l e a r that X+-+ 
Y+-+X. 
In virtue o f 
equipollences (13) and ( 1 3 ' ) we can have 
X+-+ Y^(X-+ 
Y)&(X-+Y) 
( 2 ' ) 
and 
X+-+ Y^(X-+Y)&(Y 
-+X)^X+-+Y. 
( 1 4 ' ) 
These equipollences mean that a proof 
of the direct 
and 
converse 
theorems can be replaced 
by a proof 
of 
the 
direct 
and inverse 
or inverse 
and inverse 
converse 
theorems. 
We note, moreover, that, by using equipollence (11) and 
rule I we can reduce t h i s connective t o the connectives 
and, or, 
and 
not: 
Y)&(Y-+X)^XY&XY. 
(15) 
We now pass on t o the consideration o f the last con-
n e c t i v e X\/\/Y. 
The statement X\/ 
\/Y means that e i t h e r 
statement X i s true and statement Y i s f a l s e or that 
statement X i s false and statement Y true. 
In other words 
the statement 
X\/ 
\/Y 
is 
true if and only 
if at least 
one 
of the statements 
X & Y and X & Y is true. 
Therefore, 
X y y 
Y^(XkY)(X&Y). 
(16) 
The v a l i d i t y of t h i s equipollence can be v e r i f i e d with the 

Direct and converse theorems 
* [As was mentioned on p. 107 the derivations of equipollences 
conducted in this paragraph are based upon truth tables. 
Therefore it should be possible, generally speaking, to dis-
pense with these derivations by replacing them by the direct 
verification of equipollence of the formulae by means of 
truth tables, just as was done for equipollences (3) and (7) 
on p. 104. 
Since, however, a tabular verification of 
equipollence is a rather cumbersome affair we proceed in the 
following way. We verify some equipollences directly by 
tables; this applies to equipollences (l)-(8); (true, we 
did not present such a verification of all of them in ex-
plicit form, hy writing out the corresponding tables; for 
equipolences (1), (2) and (8) the verification was performed 
by means of a condensed argument, and the tabular verifica-
tion of equipollences (4), (5) and (6) was left to the 
reader). T3ien other equipollences were derived from these 
equipollences using rules I and II. Such a derivation, how-
ever, reduces entirely to a tabular verification since rules 
I and II themselves were verified hy truth tables (the 
reasoning, by which we convinced ourselves of the validity 
of rule I (p. 102) is also such a verification, in fact).]

aid o f a table analogous to those on 
p. 104*-
We consider f i n a l l y several more equipollences which 
transform the statement X-+(Y-> 
Z). 
In virtue o f equipollences (11), (5) and ( 8 ' ) we shall 
have 
X^(Y^Z)^X^(?Z)^XYZ^YXZ~

(17) 
In order t o elucidate these equipollences we consider 
the theorem "in equal c i r c l e s equal chords are 
equidistant 
from the centre". 
We set ourselves the task o f separat-
ing condition and conclusion in the theorem. 
To t h i s 
end we introduce into the formulation the words if and 
then. 
This can be done in three ways. 
1) By expressing the theorem in the form o f the s t a t e -
ment X~+(Y-+Z): 
" i f c i r c l e s which contain chords are 
equal, then i f the chords are equal they are 
equidistant 
from the centre" 
(or more l i t e r a l l y : 
"under the con-
d i t i o n o f the equality o f the c i r c l e s containing the 
chords there occurs the theorem: 
i f the chords are equal, 
they are equidistant from the c e n t r e " ) . 
2) By expressing the theorem in the form o f the s t a t e -
ment 
K-*(AT-*- Z): " i f the chords are equal, then from 
the equality o f the c i r c l e s containing the chords there 
follows t h e i r equidistance from the centres o f these 
c i r c l e s " 
(or: 
" i f the chords are equal, then i f the 
c i r c l e s are equal the chords are equidistant from the 
c e n t r e " ) . 
3) By expressing the theorem in the form o f the s t a t e -
ment 
(X& Y)-+Z: 
" i f the c i r c l e s are equal and the 
chords drawn in them are equal, then the chords are 
equidistant 
from the centres o f t h e i r c i r c l e s " . 
It i s c l e a r that these three formulations are equipol-
lent. 
We often use equipollence (17) without r e a l i z i n g 
i t . 
For instance, the theorem: 
" I f the diagonals o f 
parallelogram ABCD are equal, then t h i s parallelogram 
i s a rectangle" is sometimes treated thus:

The Various Forms of Converse and 
Inverse Theorems 
We have already stated in the f i r s t chapter o f t h i s 
book that i t i s p o s s i b l e t o express a theorem in the form 
o f a conditional proposition (statement). 
In the 
lan-
guage o f symbolic l o g i c t h i s means that theorems are 
often expressed in the form o f a proposition which con-
s i s t s o f two statements connected by the conjunctions 
if _ then:

The converse theorem t o the given 
one i s the theorem in which the conclusion o f the given 
theorem serves as the condition and i t s c o n d i t i o n as the

The inverse theorem to

the c o n d i t i o n and conclusion o f the given theorem by t h e i r

the form o f the statement A 
Finally, the inverse 
converse theorem has the form B 
-+A. 
We have already (pp. 32-35) 
said that in many cases 
both the converse 
to a given theorem and its 
inverse 
admit of a whole series 
of non-mutually equipollent 
for-
mulations.

Each of these 
three mutually equipollent 
logical 
forms 
(from a mathematical point o f view they are 
different

a

obtained 
(as we shall convince ourselves by examples) 
with the aid of tlie permutation of the last 
two

We now i l l u s t r a t e our symbolic reasoning by

There we 
obtained three different mutmlly equipollent formula-
tions o f the theorem "in equal c i r c l e s equal chords are 
equidistant 
from the centre". 
We now formulate the 
various converse theorems t o the given one. 
1) The form (Y->Z)-+A: 
" I f f o r two c i r c l e s the 
assertion that i f t h e i r chords are equal, then they are 
equidistant from the centre i s correct, then these c i r c l e s 
are equal" 
(or: " c i r c l e s , in which equal chords are 
equidistant 
from the centre, are equal"). 
2) The form 
(A->Z)-+ 
Y: " i f straight l i n e segments 
possess the following property: 
while being chords in 
equal c i r c l e s they are equidistant from the centres o f 
these c i r c l e s , then these segments are equal t o one 
anottier". 
3) The form 
Z-+(AtkY): 
" i f chords drawn in c i r c l e s 
are equidistant 
from the centres, then the c i r c l e s in 
which they are drawn are equal among themselves and the 
chords themselves are equal t o one another". 
4) The form 
A-+(Z->Y): 
"Under the condition o f the 
equality o f the c i r c l e s containing the chords there 
occurs the theorem: 
i f the chords are equidistant 
from 
the centre, then they are equal" 
(or: 
"in equal c i r c l e s 
chords equidistant 
from the centre are equal among them-
s e l v e s " ) . 
5) The form 
Yr-*(Z-*A); 
" i f the chords drawn in two 
c i r c l e s are equal, then the following occurs: 
i f the 
chords are equidistant 
from the centres of the c o r r e s -
ponding c i r c l e s , then the c i r c l e s are equal".

( o f the form 4) i s taken as

This

equality and the equality o f the c i r c l e s in which these 
chords are drawn). 
It i s easy t o prove that, o f the f i v e converse theorems 
stated, three are not c o r r e c t and the others are c o r r e c t

t h i s inverse theorem i s obtained by means 
of the negation o f those parts o f the given theorem 
which we interchange in the transformation t o the c o r -
responding converse theorem. 
Thus in the case that we 
have considered there w i l l be f i v e inverse theorems. 
These may be written, 
using the abbreviated numeration 
that we adopted f o r the converse theorems, in the

3 ) "If the circles in which the chords are drawn or the

taken together, then such chords lie at different dis-
tances from the centres of the corresponding circles" 
(we have repeated or here twice because i t is single in 
this case). 
4 ) "In equal circles unequal chords are not equidistant 
from the centre" . 
5) "If the chords are equal, then from the inequality 
of the circles in which they are drawn it follows that

centres". 
§ 20. Always True and Always 
False Statements 
The truth or falsehood of some statement or other 
depends upon the content of this statement. 
However, 
* This theorem should in no way be confused with the 
theorem: 
"if the circles in which the chords are drawn are 
not equal, then from the inequality of the chords it follows 
that the distances of these chords from the centres of the 
corresponding circles are not equal among themselves". 
This 
last theorem has the form 
A-*>(Y -*>Z) and is not equipol-
lent to the theorem stated in the text. 
The theorem stated 
in the text is correct, while that stated in this footnote 
is not correct.

in order t o

t h i s property we introduced in § 17 the sign o f .equipol-
lence SEE 
and we l a i d down the condition that an always 
true equivalence was t o be understood as an equipollence. 
Thus the introduction o f the sign (SEE) serves t o express 
the information that the given equivalence i s always true; 
in other words, i f some equipollence i s given, 
e.g. 
X8c K5=sJfK. 
t h i s means that the equivalence c o r r e s -

This law asserts that, o f two propositions - a given one

The fact

The always true statement X&X 
has been 
known in l o g i c since long a g o a s t / i e law of

Truth tables corresponding t o always true and always

We see that t h i s statement i s always true. 
Thus, by using truth t a b l e s , i t i s p o s s i b l e t o decide 
f o r any statement in the propositional calculus whether 
i t i s always true or not. 
The statements XX and X & X are used t o prove that some 
complex statement or other i s always true or always f a l s e . 
With t h i s in view, the complex statement A, which c o n s i s t s

formed in the following way: 1) with the aid o f equipol-
lences (11) and (15) and (16), a l l the connexions in the 
complex statement are reduced t o the three: 
& , \ / , 
~; 
2) with the aid o f formulae (8a) and (9a), the complex 
statement i s reduced t o a statement in which the signs o f 
negation stand only above simple statements, i . e . above 
statements in which the l o g i c a l connectives o f the p r o p o s i -
t i o n a l calculus do not appear; 
3) by using the d i s t r i -

(equipollence ( 7 ) ) and o f addition r e l a t i v e t o m u l t i p l i c a -
t i o n (equipollence ( 1 0 ) ) , statement A is reduced t o the 
f i r s t or second standard form. 
By the first 
standard form 
of a complex statement 
we mean a statement 
which is a sum, 
the terms_of which are the statements Xy X^ . . . . Xn, 
Xi . . . . Xn or products 
of any combination 
oj these 
state-
ments. 
By the second standard form of complex 
statement 
we mean a statement 
which is a product^ 
the factors 
of 
which are the statements 
X^, . . . . Xn, X± . . . . Xn or the 
sum of any combination 
of these statements. 
I f in the 
f i r s t standard form in each o f the products there* enters 
at least one pair o f mutually contradictory statements X± 
and X{t 
then statement A is always true. 
In fact, 
in this 
case each o f the terms o f the f i r s t standard form i s true 
since either statement X^ or statement Xi i s true; 
there-
fore statement A, equipollent to the sum, each o f the 
terms o f which is always true, i s a l s o always true. 
I f in 
the second standard form each o f the factors is a sum in 
which there enters at least,one pair o f mutually contra-
dictory statements X± and Xit 
then statement A is always 
false. In fact, 
in this case each o f the factors o f the 
second standard form o f statement A is always false and,

Statements about Properties 
Until now in the analysis o f statements only one 
question - the question o f the truth of a complex state-
ment - has interested us. 
In t h i s case we assumed that 
we were able in some way t o ascertain the truth o f some 
(or a l l or none) o f the simple statements entering 
into 
the composition o f the complex statement. 
How t h i s was 
done for the simple statements has not interested us 
until now. 
We now pass on t o a more d e t a i l e d 
analysis 
o f simple statements. 
We consider a few statements: 
1) The point A i s a 
vertex o f the rectangle drawn in Pig. 23 o f t h i s book. 
2) Quadrilateral 
ABCD o f Pig. 24 o f t h i s book i s a 
parallelogram. 
3) The number 47, 514 i s d i v i s i b l e 
(with-
out remainder) 
by 3. 
127 

Direct and converse theorems 
128 
The f i r s t 
example concerns a well-aefined point, A, 
i t being asserted that 
i t 
is 
a vertex 
o f the rectangle 
drawn in Pig,23 o f this book, i . e . 
that t h i s point 
belongs 
to 
the s e t 
o f v e r t i c e s 
o f the stated rectangle. 
This set 
was formed in 
the following way: 
from 
the 
set 
o f a l l points 
a new s e t 
was picked out 
c o n s i s t i n g 
o f 
a part (subset) 
o f the f i r s t set 
- 
the set 
o f 
the 
v e r t i c e s 
o f the rectangle drawn 
in Pig. 23. 
This 
new set 
is f i n i t e : 
i t 
c o n s i s t s o f the four points 
which are indicated on p. 147 and which constitute 
i t s 
elements. 
These points can be enumerated; 
point A, 
point B, point C, point D. 
The statement "the point A i s 
a vertex o f the rectangle drawn in Pig. 23 o f t h i s book" 
means that, in enumerating (stating) a l l the points o f 
our f i n i t e set ( a l l the v e r t i c e s o f the rectangle drawn 
in Pig. 23), we must mention the point A. 
This statement 
is true. 
The statement "the point If i s a vertex o f t h i s 
rectangle" i s false, because the point K i s not mentioned 
in the enumeration (does not appear in the l i s t ) o f the 
v e r t i c e s o f t h i s rectangle, 
i . e . does not belong t o our 
f i n i t e 
set. 
We now pass on t o the second example: 
"the quadrilater-
al 
ABCD o f Pig. 24 o f t h i s book i s a parallelogram, 
i . e . belongs t o the set o f parallelograms." 
We can again 
repeat the foregoing analysis. 
We have a set o f quadri-
laterals; 
from t h i s set a part is singled out, namely: 
the set (better - subset) o f parallelograms. 
Our statement 
asserts that the well-defined quadrilateral ABCD 
belongs 
t o the set that we have distinguished. 
Until t h i s point 
the analysis o f this statement has been e n t i r e l y analogous 
to the analysis o f the previous statement. Only one thing 
now remains - t o determine whether the quadrilateral ABCD 
does in f a c t belong to the set o f parallelograms. 
But at 
this point there is a profound difference between the 

Elements of mathematical logic 
129 
f i r s t and second examples. 
While in the f i r s t 
example 
the set o f v e r t i c e s o f the rectangle i s f i n i t e , the 
set 
of parallelograms is i n f i n i t e . 
A l l the elements o f a 
f i n i t e set can, at least in theory, be enumerated 
( i n d i -
cated). 
I t i s impossible t o enumerate a l l the elements 
o f an i n f i n i t e set, e . g . t o enumerate a l l the p a r a l l e l o -
grams. 
I f the point A belongs t o the set of v e r t i c e s o f 
the rectangle depicted in Pig. 24, we can find i t in a 
l i s t o f the elements o f t h i s set; 
i t is p o s s i b l e t o draw 
up such a l i s t . 
It i s meaningless t o talk o f seeking 
quadrilateral ABCD in a l i s t o f a l l the 
parallelograms 
because i t is impossible t o draw up such a l i s t . 
By what 
c r i t e r i o n i s i t p o s s i b l e t o decide whether a certain 
element of any set 
( e . g . the set o f quadrilaterals) 
be-
longs t o one o f i t s well-defined subsets 
(the subset o f 
parallelograms)? 
As we saw in § 4 such c r i t e r i a are some 
well-defined properties of the subset in which we are 
interested. 
For example, the property which characteri-
zes the subset o f parallelograms from the set o f a l l 
quadrilaterals i s the equality o f opposite s i d e s . Therefore, 
in order t o reply t o the question in which we are 
interes-
ted, i t s u f f i c e s t o v e r i f y in some way ( e . g . by means o f 
reasoning - proofs) that the opposite sides o f quadri-
l a t e r a l ABCD are equal. 
We note the following: 
we have divided the set o f a l l 
quadrilaterals into two parts: 
the subset o f quadri-
l a t e r a l s possessing some property a (the equality o f 
opposite s i d e s ) - the subset o f parallelograms; 
and the 
subset not possessing property a - the subset o f non-
parallelograms. 
Every quadrilateral must inevitably 
belong t o one o f these two subsets. 
Therefore, the s t a t e -
ment "the quadrilateral ABCD (a well-defined quadri-
lateral, e.g. the one indicated on such and such a page 
o f such and such a book) i s a parallelogram" 
must be 
either true or f a l s e . 
It cannot be 
indeterminate. 

Direct and converse theorems 
We now pass onto the third example: 
"the number 
47,514 i s d i v i s i b l e by 3". 
This statement can be formu-
lated thus: 
"the number 47,514 belongs t o the set o f 
integers which are d i v i s i b l e by three". 
The construction 
o f t h i s theorem d i f f e r s from the construction o f the 
previous one only in the fact that in i t the set o f num-
bers t o which the number 47,514 belongs i s not named but 
is indicated by the property which characterizes 
i t s 
elements - the property o f d i v i s i b i l i t y (without remain-
der) by 3. 
A l l the statements in the examples that we have con-
sidered reduced t o the following: 
in each it was 
asserted 
that some concrete 
entity 
a 
belongs 
to some set B. 
We 
have agreed 
to denote this statement 
thus: 
a£B. 
Thus 
statements which up until now we have denoted by a s i n g l e 
l e t t e r we shall now denote by the compound symbol a 
£B. 
As the reader already knows, by the contradiction o f 
statement X i s understood a statement f a l s e when X i s 
true and true when X i s f a l s e . 
I f X i s the statement 
a£B, 
then i t s contradictory statement w i l l be 
a£B, 
i . e . the statement "the entity a i s not an element o f the 
set B". 
I f f o r every entity a o f that f i e l d o f e n t i t i e s 
which we have in mind in a given context at least one o f 
the two contradictory statements "entity a i s an element 
of the set B" 
( i . e . a£B)f 
"entity A i s not an element 
o f set B" ( i . e . 
a£B) 
i s true, then a l l the elements o f 
the considered f i e l d o f e n t i t i e s can be divided into two 
sets: the set B and the set B (known as the complement of 
B). 
For example, l e t the f i e l d of e n t i t i e s consist o f the 
plane geometric figures. 
Then,_if we understand by B the 
set o f parallelograms, then by B should be understood the 
the set o f "non-parallelograms" 
which c o n s i s t s o f the 
plane geometric figures which are not parallelograms. 
(Here i t i s assumed that the set o f plane geometric 
figures i s s u f f i c i e n t l y well defined). 
It i s c l e a r that 
130 

Elements of mathematical logic 
131 
in t h i s case the statement "entity a does not belong t o 
set B" i s equipollent t o the statement "entity a belongs 
t o the set B" , 
i.e.: 
u~€B^a£B. 
(20) 
I f the f i e l d o f e n t i t i e s i s not p r e c i s e l y defined, then 
i t i s meaningless to speak o f a set B. 
In t h i s case, for 
example, the question o f whether the abstraction i s a 
parallelogram l o s e s meaningful 
character. 
[The analysis o f simple statements can a l s o be conduct-
ed 
in another way, by resorting t o the concept o f proper-
ty. 
It quite obviously follows, 
from what has been said 
above ( § 4 ) about sets and properties, that a statement 
about the appurtenance of entity a t o set B (or about 
i t s inclusion in t h i s s e t ) can be considered as a state-
ment about the appurtenance o f a property. 
Thus, 
instead 
o f saying: 
"entity a belongs t o set B" i t i s p o s s i b l e t o 
say "entity a has property p " (where (3 i s the property 
defining set B), and instead of the statement "entity a 
does not belong t o set B" i t i s p o s s i b l e t o say "entity 
a 
does not have property p " . 
It i s customary in mathema-
t i c a l l o g i c t o express the presence of property p in 
o b j e c t a by the formula 
P(fl)» and the absence o f property 
P from object a by the formula 
P(a).] 
We now consider the statement: 
" i t i s p o s s i b l e t o 
circumscribe a c i r c l e around a rectangle". 
This s t a t e -
ment can be formulated thus: 
" a l l rectangles belong t o 
the set o f quadrilaterals around which i t i s p o s s i b l e t o 
circumscribe a c i r c l e " . 
This statement d i f f e r s somewhat 
from the previous ones. 
In the previous statements we 
were concerned with individual e n t i t i e s : 
the quadrilateral 
ABCD, the number 3. 
Concerning these e n t i t i e s 
i t was 
asserted that they belong t o some set or other (are i n -
cluded in some set or other). 
In t h i s example we are

concerned not with individual o b j e c t s but with a whole 
set o f o b j e c t s - with the set of a l l rectangles. 
In the 
statement c o n s i d e r e d . i t i s asserted that t h i s set i s con-
tained in the set o f quadrilaterals around which i t 
i s 
possible t o circumscribe a c i r c l e , i . e . in this statement 
we are concerned with the inclusion o f one set within 
another. 
In chapter I, we agreed t o denote such a s t a t e -
ment thus: A a B. 
In the set B i s ihcluded not a d i s -
t i n c t individual but an entire set. 
The question o f the 
inclusion o f one set or o f a part of i t within another 
set i s c l o s e l y connected with the question o f the use o f 
the words " a l l " and "there e x i s t s " which we shall explain 
in the next 
paragraph. 
§ 22. 
"All" and "There Exists" 
We consider the statement "all the angles o f the regu-
lar hexagon KLMN OP are obtuse". 
This statement i s 
equipollent t o the following complex statement: 
"the angle K i s obtuse ( i . e . belongs t o the s e t o f 
obtuse angles) 
and the angle L i s obtuse, 
and the angle M i s obtuse, 
and the angle /V i s obtuse, 
and the angle 0 i s obtuse, 
and the angle P i s obtuse." 
If the e n t i t i e s considered (angle K, angle L, 
angle 
P) are denoted by the l e t t e r s a
v 
a2 
a- r e s p e c t i v e l y , 
and the set o f obtuse angles by the l e t t e r jT, then our 
statement can be written down thus:

(All

"All the e n t i t i e s a enter into

We now consider another statement: 
"one (more pre-
c i s e l y , at least one) o f the angles o f a convex hexagon 
KLMNOP is obtuse". 
This statement can be replaced by 
the following complex statement: 
"the angle K i s obtuse (belongs t o the set o f obtuse

or the angle L i s obtuse. 
or the angle P i s obtuse, 
(or here i s singular in meaning). 
This statement can be

Then from the very meaning o f the words, all,

By

there does not e x i s t one non-obtuse angle (acute or 
right-angle). 
2) Not a l l the angles o f the convex hexagon 
(KLMNOP) 
are non-obtuse (acute or right-angled). 
3) Among the angles o f a convex quadrilateral there

Elements of mathematical logic 
I wish t o stress the d i f f e r e n c e between the terms: 
there exists 
and not all. 
By d e f i n i t i o n (equipollence 
(22)) the statement (Ex.a) (a£B) 
contradicts the s t a t e -
ment (Ex. a) (a£B), 
and consequently also 
(All a) 
(a £ B)\ 
but the statement 
(Ex. 
a ) ( a £ B ) does not 
contradict the statement 
( A l l a) (a £ B), i . e . for some 
sets A and B, both the statement (Ex. a ) ( a £ B ) , 
and the 
statement ( A l l a)(a£B), 
are true, for other sets only 
the statement (Ex. a)(a£B) 
i s v a l i d . 
For example, the 
statement "among the angles o f a square there are 
r i g h t -
angles" i s true j u s t i s the statement "all the angles o f 
a square are right-angles". 
The statement "in a paral-
lelogram, the diagonals of which are not equal, there 
e x i s t s acute angles" i s true; 
however, the statement 
" a l l 
the angles o f a parallelogram, 
the diagonals o f which are 
not equal, are acute" i s f a l s e . 
The statement 
(All a) 
(a £ B) contradicts the statement 
(Ex. 
g)(a£B)i 
but 
does not contradict the statement 
(Ex.. a)(a£B). 
For 
example, the statement, "not a l l the angles o f an equi-
lateral triangle are right angles" and the statement 
"among the angles o f an equilateral triangle there do not 
e x i s t right-angles" are both true. 
I would l i k e t o d i r e c t the readers' 
attention t o the 
ambiguity o f the word all; 
in some sentences i t i s a 
synonym o f the words each, every, 
any. 
It has such a 
meaning in the sentence "all 
the numbers (in the decimal 
system) which end in a 5 or a zero are d i v i s i b l e by 5". 
This statement can be replaced by the following: 
"every 
(any) number ending in a 5 or a zero i s d i v i s i b l e by 5". 
In other sentences, such as "the set o f a l l numbers i s 
i n f i n i t e " , 
the word all 
has an e n t i r e l y different 
meaning; 
here the word all 
means the t o t a l i t y o f a l l numbers. 
In 
t h i s case i t is impossible t o replace the word all 
by the 
word each (or any). 
The sentence "the set o f each (or 
any) number i s i n f i n i t e " i s meaningless.

Up to now we have considered the case o f f i n i t e sets A 
( c f . p.136)- 
For these we deduced the r e l a t i o n s (25), 
(26), 
(27), and (28). 
We now extend these r e l a t i o n s 
t o 
i n f i n i t e sets as well. 
However, 
we do not prove 
the 
validity 
of these equipollences 
for 
infinite 
sets 
but 
take them as axioms. 
[We shall consider t h i s in more d e t a i l . 
In the 
f o r e -
going discussion the r o l e o f the f i n i t e set A, depending 
upon the example, was played either by the set o f angles 
of a regular hexagon, or by the set o f angles o f a convex 
hexagon, or by the set o f angles o f a convex quadrilateral 
or by the s^t o f angles o f a rectangle. 
We now in fact 
return t o the example with which we started this s e c t i o n . 
Hie statement " a l l the angles of the regular hexagon 
KLMNOP are obtuse" was written down in the form of the 
formula (All a)(a£T). 
The expression (All a)which 
con-
s t i t u t e s part of t h i s formula and which is known in 
mathematical 
l o g i c as the universal quantifier 
is applied 
t o the elements o f the set A, i . e . , in the given case, the 
six angles o f a regular hexagon. 
But i f the set o f obtuse 
angles (T) figures d i r e c t l y in the formula the set A with-
in i t i s not immediately indicated. 
However, the knowledge 
that in the formula we are concerned with the angles o f a 
regular hexagon i s necessary for i t s proper 
understanding; 
t h i s knowledge is the condition that we have i d e n t i f i e d 
our statement in the formula. 
Thus, with the given method 
o f symbolism for our statement, the set A (the angles of 
a regular hexagon) is understood as that f i e l d o f e n t i t i e s 
within the framework o f which t h i s statement i s con-
sidered (has meaning). 
The statements "at least one of 
the angles o f the convex hexagon 
KLMNOP i s obtuse", 
"not a l l the angles o f the convex quadrilateral KLMN are 
acute" and "among the angles o f the rectangle 
KLMN 
there are no acute angles" are considered within 
other 
f i e l d s o f e n t i t i e s . 
Thus for the f i r s t 
o f the statements 
named above, which we represented by the formula

KLMNOP, C is the set o f angles of the convex quadri-

SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEMS 
INCORPORATED IN THE TEXT 
1. Two angles in a t r i a n g l e are the object o f the 
investigation, under the c o n d i t i o n that the t h i r d angle 
o f t h i s triangle i s a right-angle. 
Conclusion: 
Hie angles mentioned are acute. 
2. The object o f the investigation i s the inscribed 
angles under the condition that they stand on one and the 
same arc. 
Conclusion: 
These angles are equal. 
3. In order c l e a r l y t o distinguish the condition and 
conclusion in t h i s theorem, we a l t e r i t s 
formulation 
somewhat: 
" I f a triangle i s a r i g h t - angled t r i a n g l e , 
then the square o f the side lying opposite the 
right-angle 
(the hypotenuse) 
i s equal t o the sum o f the squares o f 
the other two s i d e s " . 
The o b j e c t o f the investigation i s the lengths o f three 
l i n e segments under the condition that they are the s i d e s 
o f a right-angled 
t r i a n g l e . 
4. The o b j e c t o f the investigation i s the sum o f two 
integers under the condition that the product o f these 
numbers i s odd. 
Conclusion: 
The sum considered i s even.

5. The object o f the investigation is two numbers under 
the condition that 1) the numbers considered are even, 
2) the difference o f the numbers considered equals 2 
(these numbers are successive even numbers). 
Conclusion: 
The product o f such numbers i s d i v i s i b l e by 
8. 
6. In the given case we have three theorems having a 
common condition and different conclusions. 
All three o f 
these theorems are combined into one sentence. 
In order 
t o make t h i s point c l e a r i t s u f f i c e s t o a l t e r the formu-
l a t i o n o f the theorem somewhat: 
" I f the numbers a and b 
are two s u c c e s s i v e natural numbers, then 1) ^ — b* 
and 
2) 
ai + b* are odd numbers, and 3) 
i s an even number 
d i v i s i b l e by 4". 
7. We change the formulation o f the theorem: 
" i f the 
figure considered i s a triangle, then each o f i t s sides i s 
l e s s than the sum o f the other two, but greater than 
t h e i r d i f f e r e n c e " . 
In this, 
as in the 3rd problem, the 
lengths o f segments are the o b j e c t s o f investigation. The 
conclusions in t h i s problem are s i x : 
any s i d e i s l e s s 
than the sum of the other two (three conclusions) but 
greater than t h e i r difference (another three c o n c l u s i o n s ) . 
8. In a rectangle opposite s i d e s are p a r a l l e l and equal, 
a l l four angles are right-angles, 
the diagonals are equal 
and b i s e c t each other; 
the area o f a rectangle 
equals 
the product o f two o f i t s adjacent s i d e s ; 
i t i s p o s s i b l e 
t o circumscribe a c i r c l e around a rectangle; 
a rectangle 
has two axes o f symmetry. 
Analogously, i t i s p o s s i b l e t o 
enumerate the properties of a rhombus and o f a square. 
I 
d i r e c t the reader's attention only t o two properties o f a 
rhombus (and consequently a l s o o f a square) which are 
usually l i t t l e stressed in a study o f geometry: 
i t 
i s 
p o s s i b l e t o inscribe a c i r c l e in a rhombus, and the area o f 

Solutions of the problems 
a rhombus equals the h a l f product o f i t s 
diagonals. 
9. I t 
follows that a square is a type o f rhombus and 
consequently i t possesses a l l the properties o f a rhombus. 
Therefore the words "and a square" are 
superfluous. 
10. The d i f f e r e n c e between the set o f pairs o f straight 
lines in space and the set o f pairs o f p a r a l l e l s t r a i g h t 
lines in space i s the sum of two s e t s which do not possess 
elements in common: - the set o f pairs o f 
intersecting 
straight l i n e s and the set o f pairs o f skew l i n e s 
( i . e . 
those not lying in one plane). 
Hence i t follows that a 
negative reply should be given t o the question posed. 
11. Real numbers can be divided on the one hand into 
p o s i t i v e numbers, negative numbers and zero scheme 2 ) . On 
the other hand,real numbers can be divided into the 
rational (see the d e f i n i t i o n o f rational numbers in the 
footnote on p. 18) and the i r r a t i o n a l ( i . e . 
non-rational 
numbers). 
Finally real numbers can be divided into the 
two following c l a s s e s : 
1) algebraic numbers,

bers that can be the roots o f algebraic equations 
with 
integral c o e f f i c i e n t s ,

We further note that in the given case we have c l a s s i -

The usual c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of trapezia

The converse and 
inverse 
theorems 
admit 
in 
the 
given case o f two formulations depending upon whether we 
consider a rectangle as a type o f quadrilateral 
or as a 
type o f parallelogram. 
In the f i r s t case we shall have: 
The converse theorem: 
"a quadrilateral that can be 
circumscribed with a c i r c l e i s a rectangle". 
The inyerse theorem: 
"It i s impossible t o circumscribe

of the fact that t h i s quadrilateral 
is not a rectangle. 
In the second case, i . e . i f a quadrilateral

theorems w i l l read: 
Converse theorem:

Inverse theorem:

is not a rectangle.

Both o f these theorems are valid. 
The inverse converse theorem in the f i r s t case reads:

In the second case t h i s theorem i s formulated thus: 
" i f i t i s impossible t o circumscribe a c i r c l e about a

Both these theorems are v a l i d . 
We note that from the
