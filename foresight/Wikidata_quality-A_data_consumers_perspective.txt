Wikidata quality
A data consumers’ 
perspective

About me (Q37798781)
• PhD candidate at the University of Southampton
• My research focuses on data quality and community 
dynamics in Wikidata
• So far:
• Evolution of users along their activity on the platform
• Quality of external references
• Relation between group composition & quality

Why quality?

Why quality?
• To know how successful Wikidata is and how good the 
community is doing
• To know where we can improve and what the issues 
are
• To know what Wikidata can be used for

Data quality is fitness for purpose

Taxonomic hierarchies
• Brasileiro et al., 2016 analyse Wikidata taxonomic 
hierarchies on the base of the structural relationships 
that may occur between elements at different levels
• Anti-patterns were found
• In other words, P31 & P279 are often mixed up

External references
• Majority of references 
are relevant and 
authoritative
• Approach 
(crowdsourcing + 
machine learning) 
could be implemented 
in Wikidata
Not relevant, not authoritative

So many different aspects. 
What is quality then?

What is quality?
• Values must be accurate 
• Items (and the knowledge graph) must be complete
• Knowledge graph must be consistent
• Statements must be believable, supported by reliable 
sources

What is quality?
• Data quality is a complex, plural concept
• Wikidata data quality framework (RfC)?
• This was not enough!

Fitness for purpose?

A data consumers’ perspective
• Data consumers have not been taken into 
consideration in Wikidata quality studies so far
• Which dimensions are more relevant for data 
consumers?
• What is the level of quality required?

Aims of this session
• Gather a consumers’ perspective on data quality in 
Wikidata
• Discuss importance of various quality dimensions
• Discuss requirements of different consumer types
• Understand which dimensions are more relevant for each 
user type
• Discuss types of quality issues encountered

Session structure
• Groups formation + quality dimensions choice (8 min.)
• Looking at dimensions in detail (8 min. x 3)
• Plenary discussion (10 min.)
• Wrap-up (3 min.)

Groups
• 4-5 people per group
• People with similar data needs (e.g. app 
developer, research, GLAM…)
• Please add notes regarding your group here:

95

Quality dimensions
• Accuracy
Is data free of error & correctly describing facts 
in the real-world?
• Objectivity
Is data are free of bias & impartial?
• Reputation
Is data trustworthy & enough referenced?
• Consistency
Does data form a consistent knowledge 
representation?
• Timeliness
Is data sufficiently up to date?
• Completeness
Does data have sufficient breadth, depth, & 
scope?
• Interpretability
Can data can be interpreted by machines & 
humans without ambiguity?
• Interlinking
Is data sufficiently interlinked to other 
resources, either within or without Wikimedia?

Let’s look at quality now
• Why is this dimension important for you?
• What do you expect from Wikidata to satisfy your 
needs wrt. this dimension?
• Examples of issues related to this dimension

Our findings
• What are our findings?
• What do different data consumers need from               ?
• How can we address the most burning issues?
