The Journal Of The History Of Philosophy
Monograph Series
THE JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY MONOGRAPH SERIES, CONSISTing of volumes
averaging 80 to 120 pages, accommodates serious studies in the history of philosophy that are between article
length and standard book size. Editors of learned journals have usually been able to publish such studies only by
truncating them or by publishing them in sections. In this series, the Journal of the History of Philosophy presents,
in volumes published by Southern Illinois University Press, such works in their entirety.
The historical range of the Journal of the History of Philosophy Monograph Series is the same as that of the
Journal itselffrom ancient Greek philosophy to the twentieth century. The series includes extended studies on given
philosophers, ideas, and concepts; analyses of texts and controversies; new translations and commentaries on them;
and new documentary findings about various thinkers and events in the history of philosophy.
The editors of the Monograph Series, the directors of the Journal of the History of Philosophy, and other qualified
scholars evaluate submitted manuscripts.
We believe that a series of studies of this size and format fulfills a genuine need of scholars in the history of
philosophy.

Foreword
Roderick M. Chisholm
DURING THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A RENAISSANCE IN epistemology, or the
philosophical theory of knowledge. It may well be that during this time more progress has been made with respect
to the details of the subject than has been made at any comparable period during its history. Epistemologists have
also been concerned with the nature of epistemology and with its relations to science, to the other areas of
philosophy, and to our daily life. (To be sure, some have rejected the traditional questions and then, unfortunately,
have described quite different questions as constituting the subject matter of epistemology.) Of the many works on
the nature of epistemology that have appeared during this period, the present book seems to me one of the most
profound and illuminating. It is a contribution of the first importance to the theory of knowledge, both
systematically and historically.
Dr. Chatalian is concerned to show the inadequacy of what he calls the "new" conception of epistemology and to
provide us with an account of the subject that is more nearly adequate to what epistemologists have been doing for
the past 2,500 years. (An indication of his philosophical perspective is the fact that he uses "new" to refer to a
conception which, as he says, came to be generally accepted during the first decade of the present century.)
He distinguishes a number of theses that typify this new, twentieth-century conception of epistemology. He is
concerned to show that each of these is either unfounded or false.
He denies the most fundamental of these thesesthat epistemology "is to be defined and otherwise explained in
terms of skepticism." He argues that this thesis, as it is understood by those who defend it, is based upon two quite
different misunderstandingsone pertaining to the nature of epistemology and the other to the nature of skepticism
as an actual phenomenon in the history of philosophy.
Most of us, as Chatalian says, are "limited skeptics," but we may not agree about where the limits are to be drawn.
The things that you are skeptical about may be quite different from the things that I am skeptical about. This kind
of selectivity is especially striking in the case of those who are latitudinarian in assessing the justification of their
own beliefs. Different theists may appeal to different ostensible sources of divine revelation; and when this
happens, each is likely to be tough-minded with respect to the claims of the other.
It is a mistake to suppose that philosophers may be divided into skeptics

and nonskeptics in the way in which, say, they may be divided into theists and nontheists. Consider the following
observation made in the present book:
Wittgenstein and Ayer deal with philosophical skepticism without dealing with their own skepticism with
respect to the philosophical, the metaphysical, and the ethical; and Quine's very definition of skepticism in
terms of sense perception rules out the very possibility and so the consideration of other forms, some of
which (e.g., skepticism with respect to induction and the religious) are his own.
Chatalian throws new light upon the history of skepticism in Western philosophy. If what he says about Sextus
Empiricus and Pyrrho is right, as it seems to me to be, then much of what has been written about these
philosophers is mistaken; my own writings on the subject are no exception. And the current English translations
should be revised in certain key respects. Sextus Empiricus, according to Chatalian's interpretation, was in no sense
a general skeptic; he does not question the possibility of knowledge or of attaining the truth. What he questions is,
rather, the possibility of knowledge about philosophy and about science. It is with respect to philosophy and
science and not with respect to matters of ordinary life that suspense-of-judgment is to be recommended. Chatalian
draws this general conclusion: "In the case of Sextus (the only supposed skeptic for whom there is a mass of
primary data) there is overwhelming reason to believe that he is not a general skeptic, and in the case of all the rest
there is woefully insufficient reason to believe that any of them is."
The deeper source of our interest in epistemology, according to Chatalian, is simply the nature of man: "the natural
tendency of the human mind to wonder about, to inquire into, and to reflect upon the questions whether it knows,
how it knows, how much it can in principle know, and what it is to know at all."
Where Sextus Empiricus, according to Chatalian's interpretation, was skeptical about the possibility of scientific
knowledge but not about the possibility of our ordinary knowledge, many contemporary philosophers seem to think
that there is an impressive amount of scientific knowledge but that no one in particular knows anything. It is not
redundant to add, therefore, that the deeper interest in knowledge to which Chatalian refers is a part of the Socratic
concern to know ourselves.

Preface
THE PRESENT WORK HAD ITS ORIGIN IN A FEW PAGES OF ROUGH AND INFORMAL ''Notes on
Epistemology," which in late 1978 I distributed to my students in a senior course in epistemology at the University
of Ife in Nigeria. By early 1983 those notes had become an extended paper which I submitted for publication in the
journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. The paper was accepted provided that I make a number of
changes suggested by the referee and endorsed by the editor. Among those changes were that its length be
shortened and that its scopetoo narrowly focused on one epistemologistbe widened. Its scope was extended, but so
was its length, which by 1986 was double that of the original paper and approximately that of the present work.
During those three yearslargely devoted to a critical study, requested by the editor of another American journal of
philosophy, of the worldview of an American philosopher recently deceasedthe few sentences in the 1983 version
concerned with Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrho became the fifty manuscript pages of the present work's sections 2.1
and 2.2 on the major Greek Skeptics, Sophists, and Plato; for by this time, back in the United States, I had access
to primary materials unavailable in Nigeria and had decided to reexamine the whole question of the existence of
general skeptics.
Notwithstanding the work's publication in the Journal of the History of Philosophy Monograph Series, I view it
essentially as a philosophical, not a historical, study. The historical and linguistic investigations in it, important as
they are, are decidedly secondary, undertaken because the philosophical outlook I take fundamental issue withthe
analytic conception of epistemology and of philosophyitself depends upon historical and linguistic hypotheses.
I am indebted to a number of persons to whom I gladly acknowledge my debt: first, to the editors of the
Monograph Series (Richard A. Watson on the side of modern philosophy and Charles M. Young on the side of
classical), whose numerous suggestions, both constructive and critical, substantially improved the final draft; to
Dan Gunter, the copyeditor, whose numerous stylistic and other suggestions contributed to the improvement; to
Scott Bowen, an old schoolfriend who went out of his way to obtain primary materials and much else for me at a
time when I was unable to obtain them for myself; to the anonymous referee of Philosophy and Phenomenological
Research, whose critical suggestions intentionally succeeded in broadening the scope of the

work and unintentionally succeeded in lengthening it; to Hao Wang, who raised searching questions I have not
addressed and have only just begun to face; and finally, and above all, to Roderick M. Chisholm, whose initial
response in 1984 quietly encouraged me to continue when I might otherwise have given up, and without whom this
work would never have seen the light.

The Problem: A General Introduction
1.1 A New Conception of Epistemology: Seven Theses
1.1.1 A NEW CONCEPTION OF EPISTEMOLOGY HAS ARISEN IN WESTERN PHILOSOphy since the turn
of the century and has become increasingly widespread since then: the conception that epistemology is to be
defined and otherwise explained in terms of philosophical skepticism. 1 The conception has been advanced and
propounded by a large number of writers in a number of theses taking a variety of forms: (1) definitional (a
definition of epistemology itself), (2) definitional again (a definition of knowledge), (3) genetic (a thesis about the
conditions under which epistemology and all its problems arise), (4) semantic (a thesis about a necessary condition
of a question's making sense), (5) historical (theses about the founder of epistemology and the period of its
founding), (6) scopic (a thesis about the scope of epistemology), and (7) existential (a thesis about the existence of
general skeptics). As the conception seems to have originated with Bertrand Russell early in the century, it seems
fair to identify it for convenient reference as the Russellian conception, although over the course of the subsequent
three-quarters of a century elementsintroduced by G. E. Moore, L. Wittgenstein, and othersnot to be found
explicitly in the Russellian original have been incorporated in the conception, modifying it in various ways.
1.1.2 Throughout his philosophical career Russell consistently defined epistemology and philosophy
indistinguishably in terms of philosophical skepticism or doubt:
The essential characteristic of philosophy, which makes it a study distinct from science, is criticism.
Descartes' "methodical doubt," with which modern philosophy began is rather the kind of criticism which
we are asserting to be the essence of philosophy. This is the kind of criticism which constitutes
philosophy.2

More definitely:
The definition of "philosophy" will vary according to the philosophy we adopt; all that we can say to begin
with is that there are certain problems, which certain people find interesting, and which do not, at least at
present, belong to any of the special sciences. These problems are all such as to raise doubts concerning
what commonly passes for knowledge; and if the doubts are to be answered, it can only be by means of a
special study, to which we give the name "philosophy." 3
A. J. Ayer is one of a long line of post-Russellian philosophers who have adopted the Russellian conception:
In this book I begin by taking the question of what is mean by knowledge as an example of philosophical
enquiry. Having maintained that to say that one knows a fact is to claim the right to be sure of it, I show
how such claims may be disputed on philosophical grounds. Though their targets vary, these sceptical
challenges follow a consistent pattern: the same line of reasoning is used to impugn our knowledge of the
external world, or of the past, or of the experiences of others. The attempt to meet these objections supplies
the main subject matter for what is called the theory of knowledge.4
D. W. Hamlyn, another in the post-Russellian line, has presented the conception more comprehensively than has
anyone else, has developed its ramifications systematically, and has introduced Wittgensteinian and Popperian
elements into it. His adoption of the Russellian conception is not immediately apparent, however, for on the face of
it he defines epistemology in seemingly traditional and radically un-Russellian and un-Wittgensteinian terms:
"Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, is that branch of philosophy which is concerned with the nature and
scope of knowledge, its presuppositions and basis, and the general reliability of claims to knowledge."5 In this
case appearance and reality do not correspond, however, as we shall see in chapter 2; the realityhis adherence to
the Russellian outlookemerges when he characterizes the theory of knowledge ("epistemology" in our usage) and
its problems in certain ways:
In a certain sense all the problems of the theory of knowledge, even the more general ones, arise against
and by contrast with a quite different point of view. That is that knowledge is impossible, or at least that we
can never be sure that we have attained it. This thesis, which may take a variety of forms, is known as
philosophical skepticism. It raises fundamental doubts about the possibility of knowing anything at all.6
Here he characterizes all the problems of what he calls "the theory of knowledge"; elsewhere he characterizes just
one of them: "When a philosopher asks whether something is possible, the question must be set against the
consideration that this thing may not be possible. It must be set against a general skepticism

Page 3
concerning the matter in question. To be called upon to justify the possibility of knowledge or of certain kinds of
knowledge makes sense only on the supposition that it or they may not be possible" ("Epistemology," 9). In a third
passage he characterizes epistemology ("theory of knowledge'' in the first passage) itself:
It is no coincidence that epistemology began in the context of a form of the Sophists' general skepticism
about knowledge, for until such doubts had been raised, the possibility was bound to be taken for granted.
This general skepticism led to the beginning of epistemology as it has been traditionally known. It was
Plato who can be said to be the real originator of epistemology, for he attempted to deal with the basic
questions: What is knowledge? Where is knowledge generally found, and how much of what we think we
ordinarily know is really knowledge? Do the senses provide knowledge? Can reason provide knowledge?
What is the relation between knowledge and true belief? ("Epistemology," 9) 7
This third passage mingles what I called above the historical thesis (thesis 5: about the originator of epistemology
and about the period during which he originated it) and the genetic thesis (thesis 3: about the conditions under
which epistemology and all its problems arise). The first passage mingles the genetic ("arises against") and the
semantic ("by contrast with"); the second is a more explicit formulation of the semantic thesis (thesis 4: a thesis
about a necessary condition of a question's making sense).
1.1.3 Although to the best of my knowledge no other writers subscribe to the semantic thesis, many do subscribe to
one or another of the remaining six theses laid out above. Among the many philosophers subscribing to the genetic
thesis is W. V. Quine:
Doubt prompts the theory of knowledge, yes; but knowledge, also, was what prompted the doubt.
Scepticism is an offshoot of science. The basis for scepticism is the awareness of illusion, the discovery that
we must not always believe our eyes. Scepticism battens on mirages, on seemingly bent sticks in water, on
rainbows, on after-images, double images, dreams. But in what sense are these illusions? In the sense that
they seem to be material objects which they in fact are not. Illusions are illusions only relative to a prior
acceptance of genuine bodies with which to contrast them.
Rudimentary physical science, that is, common sense about bodies, is thus needed as a springboard for
scepticism. The sceptic's example of the seemingly bent stick and his examples of mirages, after-images,
dreams, and the rest are similarly parasitic upon positive science, however primitive.8
Another is John L. Pollock, who answers the question, "What is an epistemological problem?" as follows:
Skeptical arguments generate epistemological problems. Apparently reasonable assumptions lead to the
conclusion that knowledge of a certain sort (e.g., knowledge
 
< previous page

next page >

< previous page
page_4
next page >
Page 4
of the physical world, or knowledge of other minds) is impossible. Faced with such an argument, our task
is to explain how knowledge is possible. The problem is not to show that knowledge is possible; that much
we can take for granted. What we must do is find the hole in the skeptical argument that makes it possible
to have the knowledge we do. The problems of epistemology are problems of how we can possibly know
certain kinds of things that we claim to know or customarily think we know. In general, given a statement
P, we can ask, "How do you know that P?" This is the general form of an epistemological problem. The
question "How do you know that P?" is a challengea demand for justification. The task of the
epistemologist is to explain how it is possible for us to know that P, i.e., to explain what justifies us in
believing the things we do. 9
Similar accounts of the genesis of epistemology and more generally of philosophy are to be found among early
members of the Vienna Circlefor example, Moritz Schlick and Hans Hahnand in Bertrand Russell.10
1.1.4 Among the many who subscribe to one or both of the two parts of the historical thesis (the identification of
the originator of epistemology as Plato, and the identification of the period of its origination as that of the
Theaetetus) is W. K. C. Guthrie:
We see [he writes, during a discussion of Plato's Charmides] the first stirrings of the intellectual curiosity
which led him later on, in the Theaetetus and Sophist, to look for the essence of knowledge itself, its
relation to sensation and opinion, the possibility of error and related questions. He will found epistemology,
but not yet.
Now for the first time [he writes, in a discussion of Plato's Theaetetus] Plato has chosen to make
knowledge itself the main subject of enquiry, setting aside for the purpose all preconceived ideas such as
appear unchallenged in the Phaedo-Republic group.11
Others subscribing to this view are John Burnet, Bertrand Russell, and Nicholas P. White.12
1.1.5 I have so far summarily explained and documented theses 1, 3, 4, and 5. In section 1.3 I explain and
document thesis 6, the scopic thesis, and in section 1.4 I explain and document thesis 7, the existence thesis. The
remaining theoretical thesisthesis 2, which concerns the conception of knowledgeI explain, document, and critically
assess in section 2.3 on the basis of my assessments of thesis 7 in section 2.1 and thesis 5 in section 2.2.13 In
section 1.2, which forms an interlude, I determine and explain the broader philosophical foundations of the new
conception of epistemology. I then advance an alternative conception of epistemology, and underlying it an
alternative conception of philosophy, mainly in chapter 3, but partly also as part of my criticisms in chapter 2.

1.2 The New Conception of Epistemology and Analytic Conceptions of Philosophy
1.2.1 This new conception of epistemology, unprecedented in the global history of philosophy, appears to be rooted
in the new conceptions of philosophy, themselves unprecedented, 14 which, like the new conception of
epistemology, were inaugurated by Russell early in the century, developed by Moore in certain directions, stated in
their most extreme forms by members of the positivistic and linguistic movements in philosophy, and hailed as a
revolutionary turning point in philosophy.15 It was thus that Russell, arguing that the problems and methods of
philosophy were misconceived by all the traditional schools of philosophy (whence come the widespread references
in the "new" philosophy to "traditional philosophy," "traditional logic," "traditional metaphysics," "traditional
ethics,'' "traditional epistemology," and so on, and the general redivision of philosophy in terms of "philosophy of
science, logic, mathematics, language, government, religion, history, art," and so on), advanced what he called the
"logical-analytic" method in philosophy, redefined (thus reconceiving) philosophy as the science of the possible
(making "only such assertions as would be equally true however the actual world were constructed"), reconceived
all philosophical problems, "when subjected to the necessary analysis and purification," as logical problems, and
excluded all the rest of the traditional problems from the scope of general philosophy, which from now on was to
be "scientific." In other words of his, logic is the essence of philosophy, and philosophy and logic are
indistinguishable (elsewhere it was philosophy and epistemology, as I have already noted) "as ['logic'] has now
come to be used."16
1.2.2 Post-Russellian philosophers more or less deeply influenced by Russell (much earlier by Hume, somewhat
earlier by Moore, and later by Wittgenstein) then proceeded to substitute "analytic" or "conceptual" or "linguistic"
for Russell's "logical," thus providing analytic-philosophical variants (Wittgenstein, Carnap, Ayer, Ryle,
Waismann, Strawson, et al.) of Russell's logical-analytic original that have been espoused in various forms by
various adherents of analytic philosophy: every philosophical problem, "when subjected to the necessary analysis
and purification," is analytic, or conceptual, or linguistic; and its solutionfor philosophical problems could now be
solved, now that they were scientificis analytic, or conceptual, or linguistic.17
By Wittgenstein, philosophywhose 2,500-year-long classical tradition was repudiated by him as mostly nonsensical
(largely, it appears, in ignorance of it)was reconceived first as critique of language, then as investigation of the
workings of our language;18 by Rudolf Carnap, after a similar wholesale repudiation (on a similar basis), first as
logical analysis of science (more technically, the logical

Page 6
syntax of the language of science), then as logical syntax supplemented by semantics, still later as logical syntax
and semantics supplemented by pragmatics (in a series of works, including numerous books and papers, extending
from the 1920s to the 1960s), always, however as philosophy of science (a view implicit in Wittgenstein, explicit
in Quine); 19 by A. J. Ayer as the provision of contextual definitions;20 by Gilbert Ryle as the systematic
restatement of what it really means to say so-and-so, along with the detection of the linguistic sources of recurrent
misconstructions and absurd theories, all the examples of which were to be found in the classical world tradition of
philosophy;21 by Friedrich Waismann, following Wittgenstein's lead, as the clarification of thought;22 and so
on.23
1.2.3 These reductionistic reconceptions of philosophy in general were followed in rapid succession by
reductionistic reconceptions of every branch of classical or traditional philosophy: either the total repudiation of
ethics as a legitimate part of the philosophical (or indeed of any cognitive) enterprise24 or its reductionistic
reconception in exclusively metaethical terms;25 either the total repudiation of metaphysics as a legitimate part of
any philosophical or cognitive enterprise26 or its reductionistic reconception in exclusively meta-metaphysical
terms, differing, as Strawson put it, from what is called philosophical, logical, or conceptual analysis only in scope
and generality;27 either the total repudiation of epistemology as a legitimate part of any philosophical or other
cognitive enterprise28 or its reductionistic reconception in exclusively metaepistemological terms;29 and either the
total exclusion of the applicational dimensionspolitical philosophy, social philosophy, economic philosophyof the
classical world tradition ("matters," as Russell wrote, "which I should regard as lying wholly outside
philosophy")30 or their reconception in exclusively linguistic terms.31
1.2.4 Meantime, both before and after Russell's earliest moves toward analytic philosophy, Moore introduced two
other ideasone methodological, the other doctrinalwhich were eventually incorporated in the analytic conception of
philosophy: the first, a switch in focus from the answers of philosophy to the questions, with the methodological
requirement that the questions be subjected to prior analysis, "discovering precisely what question it is which you
desire to answer"; and the second, the view that the propositions of common sense have priority over the
propositions of philosophical theory, the truth of the former being unquestionable, and only their analysis being a
matter for philosophical investigation.32
1.2.5 If we put some of these pieces together, we can understand how the generic account of the analytic
conception of epistemology (allowing for variations or differences within the genus) was arrived at. According to
Wittgenstein and the logical positivists, the only truths are those of natural science, the only method of discovering
them is the method of science, and philosophy's sole positive function is not to discover or even to seek truths
inaccessible to science

Page 7
and scientific method but only to analyze scientific truth and method: an exclusively second-order enterprise,
eschewing all direct contact with and investigation of reality and human aspiration. According to Moore, the
propositions of common sense (which, when it is common sense about physical bodies, Quine identifies with
rudimentary physical science) must be added to the stock of scientific truths; and where those propositions, at
least, are concerned, a major function of philosophy in that branch of it known as epistemology must be to erect
what Hamlyn has characterized as a set of defense works against general skepticism. 33 And according to
Wittgenstein, the advancement of all philosophical theory is out of bounds: philosophical problemswhich are not
empirical problems to be solved with the help of empirical data but linguistic problems to be solved or resolved by
looking into the workings of our languageare not to be solved by discovering new information.34
If this is true for philosophy in general, it is necessarily true for all its branches. Thus, philosophy of mind neither
requires nor provides any new information about minds; it merely rectifies the logical geography of the knowledge
we already possess and have obtained solely through science and common sense.35 Thus, the metaphysician does
not and cannot discover any truths, new or old, about reality; he merely analyzes the actual structure of our thought
about the world.36 Thus, the moral philosopher does not and cannot discover any moral or ethical truths; he
merely analyzes the propositions and terms of moral and ethical judgment.37 And so it is for the epistemologist.
In his study of Wittgenstein, Anthony Kenny puts forward a conception of epistemology that is a widespread
variant of the analytic conception: "Since the time of Descartes epistemology, or theory of knowledge, has been
one of the major preoccupations of philosophy: the attempt to explain how it is that we know what we know, and
how to answer sceptical doubts about the justification of our beliefs."38 It is a definition framed in light of an
analytic conception of philosophy (reproducing elements of the account given, e.g., by Russell, Ayer, Hamlyn, and
Pollock): that we already know what it is that we know; that what we know is obtainable only by nonphilosophical
and nonepistemological means; that philosophical and epistemological inquiry are in principle incapable of
discovering any truth about reality and human aspiration; and that epistemology in particular has two and only two
essential functionsthe negative one being defensive (how to repel sceptical doubts or to erect a set of defense
works against philosophical skepticism), the positive one being explanatory (explaining how it is that we know
what it is that we know).
Arthur Danto has formulated the analytic epistemological outlook more plainly: "Philosophy, in providing theories
of truth or theories of knowledge, adds nothing to the body of truths which we possess or knowledge which we
have. Only science, broadly construed, of course, does this. Philosophy only analyzes

what it is for a sentence to be true, or what it is for a man to have knowledge." 39 But this, I shall argue, is not
what epistemologists since the time of Descartes, or for that matter since the time of Plato and even before, have
viewed as their whole task; it is only what epistemologists, when they have reduced epistemology to analytic
epistemology, have viewed as their whole task.
1.3 Thesis 6: The New Conception of Epistemology and the New Conception of the Scope of Epistemology
1.3.1 The reductionist and exclusionist conceptions of philosophy advanced by analytic philosophers, issuing as
they have in reductionist and exclusionist conceptions of epistemology (as of every branch of classical
philosophy), have issued inevitably in reductionist and exclusionist conceptions of the scope of epistemology (as of
every branch of classical philosophy). Just as Russell's logicalist or possibilist conception of philosophy excludes,
by his own account, "many of the traditional problems of philosophy," and Wittgenstein's critical conception
excludes, by his own account, "most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works" (to say
nothing of what his linguistic conception excludes), and Carnap's analytic conception, by his own account, "all of
the traditional problems of philosophy," so the analytic conceptions of epistemology exclude most of the traditional
problems and questions of epistemology. This is the case even when, as in the case of Hamlyn, the definition of
epistemology advanced is, on the face of it, highly traditional and appears to take in all the problems of traditional
epistemology.
1.3.2 In general, twentieth-century epistemologists, when they address these questions at all (Quine, for example,
being one who does not), accept something like Hume's twofold division of philosophical skepticism into
"excessive" (the Pyrrhonian, according to him) and "mitigated." Hamlyn distinguishes between "general" or
"wholesale" skepticism and limited or restricted skepticismsskepticism with respect either to special fields of
knowledge (e.g., science, mathematics, and history) or to the means of knowledge (e.g., perception, reason, and
memory). Ayer, ignoring the general or wholesale forms of skepticism, addresses himself exclusively to restricted
or limited formsskepticism with respect to our knowledge of physical objects, the past, induction, scientific
entities, and other minds. Pollock, not ignoring general skepticism but repudiating it (''The problem is not to show
that knowledge is possible; that much we can take for granted"), also addresses himself exclusively to the limited
formsskepticism with respect to our knowledge of the physical world, the past, contingent general truths, other
minds, the a priori, "and possibly knowledge of general moral truths."40
1.3.3 Two striking features of these and many other accounts and critiques

Page 9
of limited skepticism are worth noting. The first is the arbitrariness of their selectiveness: there is no consideration
or, for the most part, even any mention of limited philosophical skepticisms of other kindsskepticism with respect
to the philosophical itself, the ethical, the metaphysical, the epistemological, the religious, and the theological. If
epistemology is in part a set of defense works against philosophical skepticism, it is not for Hamlyn or Ayer or
Wittgenstein or Quine a set of defense works against all possible or even known forms of limited skepticism.
Wittgenstein and Ayer deal with philosophical skepticism without dealing with their own skepticism with respect
to the philosophical, the metaphysical, and the ethical; and Quine's very definition of skepticism in terms of sense
perception rules out the very possibility and so the consideration of other forms, some of which (e.g., skepticism
with respect to induction and the religious) are his own. It may indeed be the case that such limited forms of
skepticism are justifiable; it is not at this point being argued that they are not. All that at this point is being argued
is that they require justification: a general or adequate epistemology is not licensed to ignore them or to take it for
granted that they are justifiable. 41
The second feature worth noting fits in with a feature of analytic epistemology earlier noted: that the forms of
philosophical skepticism against which defense works must be erected are those and only those which in the
judgment of the analytic epistemologists undermine science and common sense (which, in Quine's scheme, is just
to say science). One or the other of these two silent assumptions of analytic epistemology is traceable to Russell,
Moore, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Ayer, and the early analytic epistemologists in general. Every dimension of classical
or traditional philosophy is to be jettisoned except for the analytic, conceptual, or linguistic investigation and
defense of science and common sense; and so I argue in section 2.3 that the reduction of the scope of classical
epistemology in the new epistemology is even more drastic than I have so far remarked. If philosophy in the
Middle Ages was viewed by many as the handmaiden of theology, philosophy and epistemology in the twentieth
century have come to be viewed by the analytic philosophers and others as the handmaiden of science and
common sense. Danto says so in so many words, and Ayer implies it.42
1.4 Thesis 7: Skeptics and Skeptics: General Skeptics and Limited Skeptics
1.4.1 If epistemology is in part or in whole a response to general skepticism, there must be general skeptics to
whom to respond. But who are they, and just exactly what does their skepticism amount to? Many of the most
noted critics of skepticism do not say; and many of those who say, say or imply what is not so.

Examples can be cited from the distant past and in the recent present. Hume, in the distant past, claims that he has
very carefully displayed "the arguments of that fantastic sect" (the Pyrrhonian) whose adherents, according to him,
"hold that all is uncertain, and that our judgment is not in any thing possest of any measures of truth and
falsehood." 43 Whatlike so many of his twentieth-century descendantshe does not inform the reader is that his
knowledge of that fantastic sect was secondhand, derived from Bayle's Dictionary and Montaigne's philosophical
works, both of which misinterpreted Pyrrhonism.44 His careful display of the arguments of that fantastic sect was
a careful display (as I shall argue by implication in section 2.1) of a sect that never existed, and so, to use his own
words, "Whoever has taken the pains to refute the cavils of this total scepticism, has really disputed without an
antagonist." Ayer, in the recent present, maintains that not all philosophers are skeptics,45 evidently viewing
himself as one of those for whom that negated generalization is true (a view which in any case follows from his
conception of epistemology).
But it is not the case that not all philosophers are skeptics. What is the case is that no philosophers are general
skeptics (at least in the ancient world), and that all philosophers are limited skeptics. The idea that there is a special
class of philosophers who are skepticsfor example, the Greek Sophists and the so-called Greek Skeptics of ancient
Greece, all the rest not being socannot be sustained; and the whole history of philosophy has been distorted by the
idea, along with all philosophical investigations of philosophical skepticism.
1.4.2 Myles Burnyeat, a noted student of the Greek Sophists, the Greek Skeptics, and skepticism generally, has in
general terms severely criticized the uncontrolled license with which modern philosophers deal with skepticism:
Skepticism is one of the few subjects which every philosopher thinks he knows a good deal about. The
skeptical arguments in the classic texts of Descartes and Hume are so familiar a part of a philosophical
education that every philosopher has given some consideration to the radical challenge to our knowledge of
the world which these arguments present.
Equally familiar is the way in which the modern philosopher feels free to construct skeptical arguments of
his own and to describe them as "what the skeptic says," without worrying whether any historical skeptic
did make himself vulnerable to the crushing refutation which then follows.46
In fact, the situation is far worse than even Burnyeat makes it out to be. Wittgenstein, Ayer, Ryle, Quine, and
numerous others advance general characterizations of skepticism, skeptics, and skeptical argumentsas if they were
not in fact dealing with straw menwithout ever taking the trouble (witness Hume) to cite actual texts, skeptics,
skeptical theses, or skeptical arguments justifying those characterizations.47 With respect to all these
contemporaries and many of their

twentieth-century predecessors it is just as Burnyeat says it is: for Wittgenstein it is "Scepticism"undefined,
unexplained, uninstancedwhich is "not irrefutable but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no
questions can be asked"; for Ayer always "the sceptic"never identified, quoted, distinguished (as if they were all
alike), or analyzedwho says this, that, or the other; for Ryle "thinkers"never identified, and so on"who wish to
maintain the pre-eminence of mathematical knowledge over other beliefs, and who wish to depreciate mundane
beliefs in favour of supra-mundane beliefs''; and for Quine "doubt"no doubter in particular ever being cited or the
specific content of his doubt ever being explainedthat prompts the theory of knowledge.
1.4.3 None of this would matter very muchalthough the question of responsible philosophizing cannot be evadedif
these critics gave a correct or reasonably adequate account of skepticism anyway; but in fact they do not, even
when, unlike Wittgenstein, they give an account of it at all. There is no evidenceand Ryle cites nonethat any of the
ancient Greek Sophists or Skeptics wished to maintain the preeminence of mathematical knowledge over other
beliefs or to depreciate the mundane in favor of the supramundane. There is no evidenceand Quine cites nonethat
the ancient Greek Sophists or Skeptics argued for general skepticism on the basis of sensory or perceptual illusion,
and no evidence (or very little) that they argued for general skepticism at all (cf. section 2.1).
In his critical review of Strawson's Introduction to Logical Theory, Quine writes: "The anonymity of [Strawson's]
'formal logicians say' engenders an air of Strawson v. Strawman. The discipline of documenting his adversary
might also have operated now and again as a corrective by leading him to wonder whether formal logicians do
think quite the way he supposed they did, on certain points, after all." 48 And so it might. But the anonymity of
Quine'sand Wittgenstein's, Ayer's, Ryle's, and Hume's"doubt," "scepticism," "the sceptic," "what the skeptic says,"
and "one of those sceptics, who hold" engenders no less an air of Strawson v. Strawman; and the discipline of
documenting the adversary might have operated now and again (or most of the time) as a corrective by leading
them to wonder whether "skeptics" do think quite (or even remotely) the way their critics suppose they do, on most
points, after all. The skepticism of Sextus Empiricus, for example, has a far narrower scope and a far wider basis
than these critics of general skepticism think: it is not about all possible forms of knowledge, and it appeals to
considerations far exceeding that of Quine's sensory illusionfor example, the argument from infinite regress, the
argument from equipollence, the argument from the unresolvability of philosophical controversy, and the argument
from the diallelus, not one of which is touched by Quine's abrupt critique of skepticism. Given the failure of these
critics to grasp and to come to grips with the depth and breadth of what Chisholm has called "the

Page 12
problem of skepticism" and characterized as "one of the basic problems of the theory of knowledge and one which
may well be incapable of solution," 49 we must acknowledge the failure of their critical responses to that problem.
1.4.4 Among proponents of the new epistemology there is one who has taken the trouble to document the skeptical
adversary. In four very substantial works, Hamlyn presents a general conception of philosophical skepticism;
divides it into two species consisting of general skepticism and limited skepticism; defines both; distinguishes five
different versions of the general and five different species of the limited; identifies two schools of general skeptics
(the Greek Sophists and the Greek Skeptics); identifies a good many of their individual members; and cites texts in
justification of his account.50
For Hamlyn, as for many of the proponents of the new epistemology, it is the existence of general skeptics and
their general skepticism in response to which epistemology as a philosophical discipline has arisen and in terms of
which it can be explained and even defined. According to him, the five different versions of general skepticism
may be formulated as follows: first, that knowledge is impossible; second, that we can never be sure that we have
attained it; third, that it makes no sense to speak of knowledge; fourth, that we never know anything; and fifth, that
the possibility of knowledge is questionable.51 I therefore turn now to the question of the existence of general
skeptics.

Examination of Some Theses of the New Epistemology
2.1 Thesis 7: The Existence of General Skeptics
2.1.1 THE PRIME EXHIBITS. AMONG SPECIALISTS IN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHICAL skepticism and among
epistemologists who have addressed themselves to the question, it is generally agreed that the prime exhibits
among ancient skeptics are the Greek Sophists and the Greek Skeptics. 1 Others, however, are sometimes cited:
Democritus, Metrodorus of Chios, Leucippus, and Xenophanes.2 I deal with these in achronological order, starting
with the Greek Skeptics, and starting first with the last of them.
2.1.2 Sextus Empiricus.3 I advance a general thesis and ten subordinate theses with respect to Sextus. The general
thesis is that he is not a general skeptic in any of the five senses specified by Hamlyn or in any other unarbitrary
sense. The subordinate theses are as follows: first, he never explicitly asserts general skepticism; second, he never
implies it by what he does assert; third, he never addresses himself to the general question of the possibility of
knowledge or the attainability of truth; fourth, he addresses himself exclusively to the limited question of the
possibility of knowledge or the attainability of truth in the fields of (what in his day were called) philosophy
(philosophia), science (epistem ), and art (techn ); fifth, he takes for granted throughout the possibility of
knowledge or the attainability of truth with respect to many matters; sixth, he asserts at many points not only the
possibility but also the actuality of knowledge and truth, categorically advancing numerous knowledge- and/or
truth-claims; seventh, the suspense-of-judgment (epoch ) whose necessity he argues for is a suspense-of-judgment
solely with respect to philosophical, scientific, or artistic questions and hypotheses; eighth, the "nonassertion"
(aphasia), even "speechlessness," of the Sextonian and Pyrrhonian Skeptic is not what so many have said it
is"refusal to say 'Yes' or 'No' about anything," "silence," or ''speechlessness"4and not even what Sextus himself
says without qualification that it isrefusal to "affirm

Page 14
or deny anything" (P.i.9)but only a refusal for the time being and under the circumstances to affirm or deny any of
those philosophical, scientific, or technical doctrines; ninth, Sextus affirms thousands of propositions (without, of
course, contradicting the Skeptic doctrine of aphasia) in the course of his two works; and tenth, all apparent
instances to the contraryone of which I have just quotedcan be seen to be only apparent and not genuine when his
subsequent explanations are taken into full account. 5
The total body of evidence relevant to these eleven theses is not only massive (only a small fraction of which has
been taken into account by any student of skepticism) but Janus-faced: much of it appears to support and confirm
them; but much of it appears to contradict and to falsify them.
2.1.2.1 The supporting evidence. Throughout his two works and at every critical juncture Sextus provides clear
indications that the scope of his inquiry is limited. In the first eight books of those two works (the three of Outlines
and the first five of Mathematicians) he makes it clear that what he will discuss is philosophical doctrine; and in
the course of those eight books he examines all of the major and many of the minor philosophers in the history of
Greek philosophy from Thales to the Stoics through the end of the pre-Christian era. At the very outset (chapter 1,
"Concerning the Main Differences among the Philosophies"), making the first of the innumerable assertions of the
sort that he as one of the Greek Skeptics is supposed by so many twentieth-century students to have eschewed, he
distinguishes three possible natural results of any investigation of any object (discovery of it, denial of its
discoverability, and persistence in the as yet unsuccessful investigation); three possible results of the investigation
of the objects of philosophy (truth-claims about them, denial of the discoverability of the truth about them, and
persistence in the investigation); the three main types of philosophy (the Dogmatic, which claims discovery; the
Academic, which denies discoverability; and the Skeptic, which, explicitly repudiating both, persists in the
investigation); the three main types of philosopher (the Dogmatist, e.g., the Milesian and Ionian phusikoi, the
Platonists, Aristotelians, and Stoics; the Academic, e.g., Cleitomachus and Carneades; and the Skeptic, e.g., Pyrrho
and Sextus); and the three main divisions of philosophy (Logic, Physics, and Ethics, corresponding roughly to what
in modern philosophy is known as epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics [P.i.14; P.ii.13]).6
It is clear from all this that, so far, Sextus is not even addressing the general question of the possibility of
knowledge or of the attainability of truth; he is addressing the limited question of the possibility of knowledge or
the attainability of truth in philosophy. Even with respect to that limited sphere, he makes it clear that he is not
asserting the impossibility of philosophical knowledge or the unattainability of philosophical truth. Such an
assertion would be incompatible with the three further terms he adopts to characterize the Skeptic (which itself,

Page 15
in his day and in his usage, meant "Inquirer")"Zetetic," "Ephectic," and ''Aporetic" (P.i.7, at which his explanations
may be consulted). Nowhere in his two works can he be found affirming any of Hamlyn's five formulations of
general skepticism; and, that being the case, students are forced to "interpret" what he does affirm in terms of
general skepticism.
This delimitation of the scope of his inquiry (an inquiry that itself is incompatible with general skepticism) 7 is
indicated again and again: in book 2 of Outlines (P.ii.1; P.ii.12), where he says that he will discuss the several
divisions of philosophy; in the same book (P.ii.1259), where he discusses the logical division of philosophy (cf.
P.iii.1); in book 3 (P.iii.1167), where he discusses the physical division; and in the same book (P.iii.168279), where
he discusses the ethical division (cf. P.ii.13). The whole of volume 2 of the Loeb Classical Library edition is then
devoted to logic (in two books), and the whole of volume 3 is divided between physics (in two books) and ethics
(in the remainder of the volume). The whole of volume 4 is then devoted to the supposed sciences of grammar
(book 1), rhetoric (book 2), geometry (book 3), mathematics (book 4), astronomy (book 5), and music (book 6).
Nowhere in all this is there any critical investigation of the ordinary claims to knowledge and truth which are
universally made in ordinary life, which Sextus himself makes as a matter of course, and which he everywhere
sanctions and nowhere questions.8
In book 2 of Outlines, where the critical discussion of logic is first introduced (P.ii.1; P.ii.13), Sextus says that
since the subject matter of all three divisions of philosophy requires testing and so a criterion (P.ii.13), he will
begin with the doctrine of the criterion of truth (P.ii.4). But although that is what he says, it is clear both from the
general context of his entire corpus and also from the particular contexts at various critical junctures that his
inquiry is concerned not with the criterion of truth in general but with the criterion of philosophical (or scientific or
technical) truth in general; for it is, apart from what he actually says, in fact the latter and the latter alone which he
then proceeds to subject to critical discussion.9 Distinguishing three senses of the term criterionthe general (e.g.,
physical organs, applicable to every standard of apprehension), the special (e.g., rule and compass, applicable to
every technical standard of apprehension), and the most special (applicable to every technical standard of
apprehension "of a non-evident [adelon] object")he makes it clear that his critical discussion is to be confined to
the thirdthat is, to "only logical standards and those which the Dogmatists employ for judging of truth" (P.ii.1416).
But since we already know that the notion of truth (according to Sextus) employed by the Dogmatists is the notion
not of truth in general but of philosophical truth in general, we know that when Sextus asks, "Does a criterion of
truth exist?" (P.ii.18), he is asking, elliptically, whether a criterion of philosophical truth exists. So when he
thereupon advances the famous Wheel (diallelus) Argumentthat "in order to decide
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_16

Page 16
the dispute which has arisen about the criterion [of truth], we must possess an accepted criterion by which we shall
be able to decide the dispute; and in order to possess an accepted criterion, the dispute about the criterion must first
be decided" (P.ii.20)we know that the argument is designed to justify suspense-of-judgment (epoch ) about claims
to philosophical truth and not to justify general skepticism, as so many students have concluded. 10
When, after his initial consideration of the question of the criterion of truth Sextus returns to it to devote a deeper
and more sustained consideration to it (L.i.27), he prefaces his reconsideration by observing that the search for
philosophical truth presupposes trustworthy principles and methods for the discernment of such truth and that it is
the logical division of philosophy which seeks to provide the necessary theory of criteria and of proof (L.i.24). And
why, he asks, is "the problem of this criterion everywhere a subject of controversy"? Because, he answers, man is
by nature a truth-loving animal (a most emphatic affirmation, we note) and because the criterion pronounces
judgment upon the most general systems of philosophy concerning the weightiest of matters (L.i.27). Never can he
be found affirming that knowledge of the existence of men, or of philosophers, or of philosophical systems, or of
proposed criteria of truth, and on and on, is impossible; or that we can never be sure that we have attained it; or
that it makes no sense to speak of knowledge of it; or that we never know anything about them; or that the
possibility of knowledge of any of them is questionable. He takes it for granted that all are knowable, and in fact
known. Since he time and again clearly restricts the subject of his discussion, he like any other writer is under no
obligation to say endlessly, every time he poses a question and addresses possible answers, that the subject under
discussion is restricted. It is the student's obligation to interpret what Sextus says at one point or another in terms of
the general context and in light of the explanations provided.
Sextus conveys the delimitation of the scope of his inquiry in other terms: in terms of the distinction between the
evident (prodelon) and the nonevident (adelon), when he explains that the Skeptic assents to nothing nonevident
(P.i.13), thereby implying that the Skeptic assents to the evident; again in terms of the distinction between
dogmatizing and not dogmatizing, when he explains that the Pyrrhonian philosopher (whose existence he evidently
takes for granted) does not dogmatize, "using 'dogma' in the sense of 'assent to one of the non-evident objects of
scientific (epist mas) inquiry'" (P.i.13), thereby implying that the Pyrrhonian philosopher gives or can give assent
to evident objects; again the terms of the distinction between phenomena (phainomena) and the "external
underlying things" (ton exothen upokeimenon), when he says that the Skeptic can justifiably say what appears to
himself although he cannot justifiably say what if any the external underlying things (substrata, in Aristotle's
system) are (P.i.15); again in terms of the distinction between the indubitable phenomenon and dubitable
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_17
next page >
Page 17
judgments about the relationship between the phenomenon and the underlying object (P.i.19), when he says that the
Skeptic's doubt "does not concern the appearance itself but the account given of that appearance," thereby implying
the Skeptic's repudiation of the doctrine of universal dubitability; again in terms of the distinction between facts
(pragmata) experienced and recognized by all, including all philosophers and all mankind (P.i.21011), and
dogmas; again in terms of the distinction between facts "apparent to all men equally acknowledged and
uncontroverted" (P.ii.8) and the dogmas of philosophers interminably disputed. The Ten Tropes of Aenesidemus
are, in Sextus' presentation, arguments designed to induce suspense-of-judgment with respect to the "nature of
objects" (t s phuseos ton pragmaton), but the evidential basis of each of the argumentsa set of observable facts
about animal variety, human differences, sensory differences, sensory circumstances, and so onis taken to be
apparent to all men equally and exempted from suspense-of-judgment (P.i.36163). The same is the case with
respect to the Five Tropes of Agrippa (P.i.16477) and the Two Tropes "handed down by the older Skeptics"
(P.i.17879): the suspense-of-judgment they are designed to induce is not taken to be applicable to their evidential
bases. Again, when discussing the differences and similarities between the Skeptic Way (agog ) and the
Heraclitean philosophiasa discussion which could not even begin if epoch  were universally applicable, to say
nothing of skepticism in Hamlyn's senseSextus notes that the Heracliteans start from the same general (or common,
or universal) preconceptions of mankind, "just as we also do,'' and that "their starting-points are impressions
experienced not by us only but by all the other philosophers and by ordinary man," all of us making use of "the
same common material" (P.i.211).
It is not only to such evident and indubitable empirical facts, not matters of philosophical controversy, that Sextus
appeals throughout his fourteen books; it is also to logical factslogical impossibilities, certainties, validities,
invalidities, and the underlying general principles: to the law of the excluded middle (P.ii.86, 88, 90; iii.33, 4041,
132, 13839); to the law of contradiction (P.ii.143; L.ii.5253); to the fallacy of circular reasoning (L.ii.22); to the
principle of self-refutation (L.i.389); to the impossibility of an infinite series (P.ii.85); and in a single short passage
to the principle of self-refutation, the law of the excluded middle, and the technique of reductio ad absurdum
(L.ii.5557). There is much more of the same kindall overlooked by those who read Sextus as a general skeptic. 11
The knowledge- and/or truth-claims made at every point in Sextus's corpusfor example, at the very outset of
Outlines, where his numerous assertions (affirmations) are sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly also
knowledge-and/or truth-claims (or are we to suppose that he does not think he knows of the existence of all the
philosophers he describes and the character of all the philosophies he describes, including himself and Skepticism
itself?)are extended also

to the Skeptic End (telos). About it"that for which all actions or reasonings are undertaken, while it exists for the
sake of none, the ultimate object of appetency" (P.i.25)he writes, "We assert (phamen) still that the Skeptic's end is
quietude (ataraxian) in respect of matters of opinion (doxan) and moderate feeling (metrio-patheian) in respect of
things unavoidable (katenagkasmenois)" (P.i.2526), thus contradicting those interpretations which have the Skeptic
refusing to say yes or no about anything (see section 2.1.2), or refusing to say anything about anything, or refusing
to make affirmations or denials about anything, or holding that the Skeptic's End (according to Sextus) is just
ataraxia (and then criticizing the doctrine on the basis of that misinterpretation). 12 There are categorical
affirmations, and by implication truth-claims, about the nature and existence of the Skeptic End (P.i.2526), the
conditions under which it is attainable (P.i.2629), unattainable (P.i.27), both (E.14167), andscattered throughout the
work Against the Ethicistsa comparative and critical discussion of the ethical doctrines of the ethical philosophers
and that of the Skeptics (E.i.257) involving affirmative judgments, positive and negative, throughout.
2.1.2.2 The counterevidence. The evidence or seeming evidence that one or another of our eleven theses about
Sextus (section 2.1.2) is false falls into one or another of three groups: first, some of Sextus' own formulations of
the Skeptic philosophy; second, the famous "Skeptic expressions or formulas"; and third, his categorical statement
that there is no truth.13
To take up the first of these, Sextus' own formulations of the Skeptic philosophy: Sextus defines Skepticism as "an
ability (or power) that opposes appearances to judgments in any way whatsoever, with the result that owing to the
equipollence of the objects and reasons thus opposed, we are brought first to suspense-of-judgment and then to
quietude" (P.i.8), that suspense-of-judgment then being explained as a state of mental rest "owing to which we
neither deny or affirm anything" (P.i.10). It is evident, by inspection, that this definition (already an affirmation: an
affirmation that this is what Skepticism is) is not a formulation of general skepticism: it does not assert that
knowledge is impossible, and so on. In combination with the explanation of suspense-of-judgment, it has,
however, been taken to be a formulation of both universal suspension of assertion and of belief.14 The definition
and the added explanation are taken at face value: the Skeptic is not to affirm or deny anything whatsoever, and he
is not to make "judgments in any way whatsoever." But I have already adduced numerous general considerations
to show that for Sextus the scope of his inquiry in general is limited, not unlimited; and it follows, if consistency is
to be preserved, that the scope of his formulations has similarly to be limited, not unlimited. The judgments to
which appearances are to be opposed are philosophical (or scientific or technical) judgments; the things or
statements not to be affirmed or denied are

Page 19
philosophical (or ) things or statements. Suspension of belief and of assertion is not to be universal.
There are additional, more specific considerations in support of this interpretation. In the course of his explanations
of Skepticism, Sextus writes, "The main basic principle of Skepticism is that of opposing to every proposition an
equal proposition" (P.i.12), thus seeming once again to undermine every proposition and thus, given the context, to
be advocating (but how, except by assertion?) universal suspense-of-judgment. But repeatedly he saysin passages
which have been overlooked or ignored by many prominent students of Greek Skepticismthat formulations
advanced by him which on the face of it are universal in scope are "elliptical" (P.i.188), that is, defective or
incomplete, requiring to be filled out or qualified before they say more exactly what is intended. So when Sextus
discusses a Skeptic formula similar in essential respects to the one quoted above ("To every proposition an equal
proposition is opposed"). ''To every argument an equal argument is opposed" (P.i.202), he explains in effect that it
is not to be taken at face value: "We mean," he says, "'to every argument' that has been investigated by us, and the
word 'argument' we use not in its simplest sense, but of that which establishes a point dogmatically (that is to say
with reference to what is non-evident)"; and he adds: "So whenever I say 'To every argument an equal argument is
opposed,' what I am virtually saying is 'To every argument investigated by me which establishes a point
dogmatically, it seems to me there is opposed another argument establishing a point dogmatically, which is equal to
the first in respect of credibility and incredibility'; so that the utterance of the phrase is not a piece of dogmatism,
but the announcement of a human state of mind which is apparent to the person experiencing it" (P.i.203). So
whenever he says, "To every proposition an equal proposition is opposed," he is not proposing a self-contradictory
assertion that no assertion (denial or affirmation) is to be made, nor is he proposing the self-contradictory judgment
that all judgment is to be suspended; he is saying that suspension of all assertion (affirmation or denial), of all
judgment, and so of all knowledge-claims and truth-claims with respect to philosophical (or scientific or technical)
matters (that is to say, claims about the nonevident) is warranted for reasons adduced, for example, in the Ten
Tropes of Aenesidemus and in the Five Tropes of Agrippa. He is not advocating general skepticism in Hamlyn's or
Annas and Barnes's sense; he is not advocating universal dubitability; he is not even advocating the universal
suspense-of-judgment or of assertion.
The second of the groups of counterevidence, the Skeptic expressions or shorthand formulas, have also been taken
by many to be formulations of general skepticism: 15 (1) "No more" (ouden mallon [P.i.188]); (2) "Non-assertion"
(aphasia [P.i.192]); (3) "I suspend judgment" (epecho [P.i.196]); (4) "I determine

Page 20
nothing" (ouden orizo [P.i.197]); (5) "All things are undetermined" (or "undeterminable" [?]; panta estin
aorista[P.i.198]); (6) "All things are inapprehensible" (or "unapprehended" [?]; panta estin akatal pta [P.i.200]);
16 (7) ''I am non-apprehending" and "I apprehend not" (akatal pto and ou katalamban [P.i.201]); and (8) "To
every argument an equal argument is opposed" (panti logo logos isos antik tai [P.i.202]).
Some of these shorthand formulas have been interpreted to be doubly or triply unrestricted in scope: all skeptics
make no assertions about anything; I suspend all judgment about anything whatever; I determine nothing whatever
with respect to any property whatever about anything whatever. Some have been interpreted (although rarely if
ever so explicitly) to mean that I (for any I, presumably) apprehend nothing (for any x, with respect to any F,) and
that all things, being inapprehensible, are unknowable. But none of these interpretations takes any account of the
considerations, some quite general and others more specific, which I have presented so far. They fail to take
account of further considerations Sextus introduces concerning these shorthand formulas. Right at the outset of his
reference to those formulas (P.i.14), he says that they concern things nonevident, that is to say, the nonevident
objects of scientific inquiry (P.i.13). They are not about everything: nonassertion, suspense-of-judgment,
nondetermination (or indeterminability), inapprehension (or inapprehensibility), and so on are about and only about
the nonevident objects of scientific inquiry.
When in chapters 18 through 28 of Outlines (P.i.187209) Sextus presents an extended account of the shorthand
formulas, he immediately explains that formula 1 is elliptical and that the Skeptic is "implicitly saying 'Not this
more than that, up than down'" (P.i.188); that formula 2 is elliptical, implicitly meaning that "what we neither
affirm nor deny is some one of the dogmatic statements made about what is non-evident" (P.i.193); and so for
formulas 3 (P.i.196), 4 (P.i.197), 5 (P.i.19899), and 6 (P.i.200)formula 6 being especially interesting and significant
because it is the formula which has most given rise to the interpretations of Greek Skepticism as a form of general
skepticism. But formula 6, in the reformulation of Sextus, comes out as anything but a form of general skepticism:
"All the non-evident matters of dogmatic inquiry which I have investigated appear to me inapprehensible"
(P.i.200). His reformulation of formula 7 is also illuminating: "Both the expressions are indicative of a personal
state of mind in which the Skeptic, for the time being, avoids affirming or denying any non-evident matter of
inquiry" (P.i.201). Note the phrase "for the time being" (an expression I myself used above, section 2.1.2): even the
limited nonassertion doctrine is not temporally unconditional. I see no reason to suppose that any of the Skeptic
formulas is not to be reformulated in the same temporally conditional terms; for he says as much in his further
explanations of formula 6: "I conceive that up until now I myself have apprehended nothing" (P.i.200). All the
characteristic

Page 21
doctrines of the Greek Skeptics, as limited in scope as I have found them to be, are, even so, "for the time being"
only: a far cry from the general skepticism of Hamlyn and all the others, including Hegel and Hume.
The third of the groups of counterevidence concerns Sextus' statement that there is no truth. "Sextus," C. L. Stough
writes, "declares unequivocally that nothing is true" (ouden estin al thes [P.ii.85; L.ii.1718]), and she concludes
that the tradition of unqualified skepticism begun by Pyrrho "received its fullest expression in the philosophy of
Sextus Empiricus." 17 All the considerations we have so far adducednone of which she takes account of in her
consideration of the "nothing is true'' formulacontradict her conclusion. But there is more to be said about this
particular formula. Unequivocal it may be; but, like all the other shorthand formulas I have so far considered,
unelliptical and therefore unconditional it is not. Although the formula is not listed and discussed in chapters 18
through 28 of Outlines, and so is not reformulated there as all the others are, it is mentioned when he first mentions
those formulas and describes them as "the Skeptic formulas concerning things non-evident" (P.i.14), adding that
"the Skeptic does not assert these formulas in any unconditional sense." It, like all the others, is an elliptical
formulation; and about all of them he says that "we do not employ them universally about all things, but about
those which are non-evident and are objects of dogmatic inquiry" (P.i. 2078), an explanation exactly like that
which he provides for the use of the term "all" in the shorthand formulas (P.i.198, 200).
2.1.3 Pyrrho. In the twentieth century, at least seven specialists in Greek Skepticism view Pyrrho as a general
skeptic: R. G. Bury, D. W. Hamlyn, C. L. Stough, A. A. Long, D. N. Sedley, J. Barnes, and J. Annas.18 Some
among this group hold also that he rejected all belief, all assertion, and even all speech. As Pyrrho wrote nothing,
there are no works of his which might be consulted in order to determine now whether he is or is not a general
skeptic. At best in the form of paraphrase, all the surviving evidence about Pyrrho's views is at best secondhand
and worse. One supposed earwitness was Timon of Phlius, and he supposedly gives an account of what has widely
been interpreted to be Pyrrho's general skepticism in a report consisting of just six sentences. This "Pyrrho-text" is
supposed to be part of a work of Timon's; but that work itself has not survived and so cannot now be consulted.
The Pyrrho-text is nevertheless supposed to have been preserved in a work writtenfive centuries later!by Aristocles
in the second century A.D.: but that work too has not survived, and so it too cannot now be consulted. It is only in
a still-surviving work, Praeparatio Evangelica, writtensix centuries laterin the third century A.D. by the Christian
Bishop Eusebius that the Pyrrho-text is preserved and that in the twentieth century must be consulted in order to try
to determine what it was that Pyrrho said and thought: at a remove, thus, of six centuries and three persons, the first
of whom, claiming

< previous page

Page 22
to have heard the utterance of these views by Pyrrho, claims also only to have recorded them in paraphrase on the
basis of his recollection of those utterances. 19
None of this would matter very much if it were not the case that so very much hangs on it: the widespread
interpretation in the twentieth century of epistemology as engendered by and even definable in terms of general
skepticism. If we remember the lamentations of the likes of Russell and Quinemasters of English, all of whose
numerous works are available for prolonged studyover the numerous misinterpretations and even misstatements of
their published views, and if we remember also the endless conflicting interpretations of the works and utterances
of Wittgenstein despite his accessibility to many of his interpreters, we can better appreciate the quicksand of the
Pyrrho-text and of the precariousness not only of all interpretations of it but even of the translations of it, and
especially of all those who claim subsequently to find a statement of general skepticism in it.20
Putting aside the questions of the authenticity and accuracy of the Pyrrho-text, I address the question of the
philosophical content and significance of the text. To that end I reproduce the Greek text, and part of its context,
and six translations of it, the first of which is a translation of the whole of the text and is also the most recent.
2.1.3.1 The entire Greek text, with its sentences numbered and the essential sentences underscored, reads as
follows:
21
2.1.3.2 The six translations, keyed to the sentences in the Greek, are as follows:
1."[(1) It is supremely necessary to investigate our own capacity for knowledge. For if we are so
constituted that we know nothing there is no need to continue enquiry into other things. Among the
ancients too there have

Page 23
been people who made this pronouncement, and Aristotle has argued against them. (2) Pyrrho of Elis
was also a powerful spokesman of such a position. He himself has left nothing in writing, but his
pupil Timon says that whoever wants to be happy must consider these three questions: first, how are
things by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the
outcome for those who adopt this attitude? (3) According to Timon, Pyrrho declared that things are
equally indifferent, unmeasurable and inarbitrable. (4) For this reason neither our sensations nor our
opinions tell us truths or falsehoods. Therefore for this reason we should not put our trust in them
one bit, saying concerning each individual thing that it no more is than is not, or it both is and is not,
or it neither is nor is not. (5) The outcome for those who actually adopt this attitude, says Timon, will
be first speechlessness, and then freedom from disturbance; [and Aenesidemus says pleasure. (6)
These are the main points of what they say.] 22
2.(2) What is the nature of things? (3) Things are in an equal degree indifferent and unstable and
incapable of being tested. (4) For this reason neither our senses nor our opinions are true or false.23
3.(2) What is the nature of things? (3) things are by nature equally indeterminable, admitting of neither
measurement nor discrimination. (4) For this reason, our sense experience and beliefs are neither true
nor false.24
4.(2) What things are really like. (3) things are equally indistinguishable, unmeasurable, and
indeterminable. (4) For this reason neither our acts of perception nor our judgments are true or
false.25
5.(2) What are things like by nature? (3) [The world is in its own nature] undifferentiated,
unmeasurable and unjudgeable.26
6.(2) what objects are like by nature. (3) objects are equally indifferent and unfathomable and
undeterminable. (4) neither our senses nor our judgments are true or false.27
2.1.3.3 When these six translations are presented side by side for inspection, it is evidentalthough it might
otherwise not bethat translation is already interpretation: that a measure of interpretation, sometimes decisive, is
embodied in the very translations themselves. It is not as though we were presented with two reasonably distinct
processes consisting first of neutral or interpretation-free translation from one language to another and second of
interpretation in terms of the second language. In the case of every crucial term, the two processes have been
fused. On top of that a second layer of interpretation has been superimposed over the whole.
I shall do three things with respect to these six translations: first, point out

< previous page

Page 24
more or less radical conflicts among the senses with which they endow the Greek text; second, indicate the
unintelligibility of some of the translations; and third, argue that all are in one crucial respect or another
unwarranted and therefore that the interpretations based on themthat Pyrrho denied the possibility of knowledge
and rejected all belief, assertion, and even speechare unwarranted. The evidence warranting the judgment that
Pyrrho is a general skeptic (and so forth) is woefully insufficient, and the evidence that he is not is overwhelming.
On the basis of my examination of Sextus Empiricus and of Pyrrho I propose principles of interpretation with
which to deal with the remaining supposed general skeptics.
First, the conflicting senses suggested by the translations: Only in translations 2 and 3 is the first of the three
questions (which according to Timon must be considered by the person who seeks happiness) rendered in the same
way: "What is the nature of things?" In translation 1 it comes out as "How are things by nature?"; in translation 4
as "What are things really like?"; and in translations 5 and 6 in essentially the same way, ''What are things (or
objects) like by nature?" What we find, then, is the central and crucial question in the Greek text rendered in three
essentially different ways. The first of these three ways is the only natural rendering of the Greek. There is no word
in the Greek for the "how" of translation 1, the "by nature" of the same translation, the "really like" of translation 4,
or the "like" (and again the "by nature") of translations 5 and 6. All these translations, besides being gratuitous
interpolations of what is not to be found in the Greek, obliterate the force of the original question, which is about
the nature of things and is the central question of all pre-Socratic philosophy that almost all if not all of the pre-
Socratics undertook more or less explicitly to answer. 28 To ask "How are things by nature?"if it makes any sense
at allis not to ask "What is the nature of things?" That is equally true of "What are things really like?" in which
the reference to the nature of things is completely omitted, and of "What are things like by nature?" and "What are
objects like by nature?" Indeed, the last two renderings make no sense at all. And the link with the great question of
pre-Socratic philosophy is obscured when it is not wholly lost.
Pyrrho' fundamental answer to the first of the three questions is given in sentence 3 of the Greek text. The essential
part of it has a subject and a predicate. According to all the translations except number 5, the subject is "things" or
"objects"; in translation 5 it is "the world"a difference of immense significance in metaphysics. Be that as it may,
however, the original question is not about things or the world; it is about the nature of thingsagain a difference of
immense significance in metaphysics.
The differences among the translations on the side of the predicate of sentence 3 are quite as radical. The predicate
of the sentence contains three crucial verbal adjectives of the kind known as alpha-privatives: adiaphora, astathm
ta, and anepikrita. In translations 1, 2, and 6 adiaphora is rendered as "indifferent," in

< previous page
page_25
next page >
Page 25
translation 3 as "indeterminable," in translation 4 as "indistinguishable," and in translation 5 as "undifferentiated."
Sedley's translation, number 5, is so far a metaphysical proposition; 29 Stough's, number 3, is so far an
epistemological proposition; and Long's, number 4, is so far either indeterminately metaphysicalif
''indistinguishable" is to be construed (though Long does not say how it is to be construed) as saying something
about a general absence of distinguishable features in reality itselfor epistemological, if "indistinguishable" is to be
construed as saying something about a general human incapacity for making cognitive distinctions.
As for astathm ta, it is rendered as "unmeasurable" in translations 1, 3, 4, and 5, but as "unstable" in translation 2
and as "unfathomable" in translation 6. But none of these renderings implies or is implied by any of the others; and
clearly they attribute radically different properties to things, yielding radically different doctrines on the basis of a
single Greek sentence (and only part of it, at that).
Anepikrita is not spared: it comes out as "inarbitrable" in translation 1, "incapable of being tested" in 2,
"indiscriminable" in 3, and "indeterminable" in the remaining three translations: once again, four different
philosophical doctrines on the basis of (part of) a single Greek sentence. Strangely, except for Burnet, whose
translation precedes the earliest of all the others by decades, none of these translators makes any reference to any
of the earlier translations, as if there were not a serious problem of translation.
In respect to the second point, I would argue that most of the translations are in some part unintelligible. The first
translation's "How are things by nature?"to say nothing of the fact that hopoia means, not "how," but "what" or "of
what kind," as it is in translations 2 and 3, for exampleis an unintelligible question. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, to ask "How is (or are) X (or Xs)?" is to ask in what way or manner is X or by what means is
X. But the questions so construed makes even less sense, if possible, when "by nature" is affixed to it: "In what
way are things by nature?" "In what manner are things by nature?" "By what means are things by nature?" These
are unintelligible concatenations of words. Even the sense of "how" in the context of a question about the general
state of affairs, say, in the Middle East, where an intelligible answer would be "frightful," an intelligible question
becomes unintelligible as soon as "by nature" is affixed to it. It makes no sensealthough it is not meaninglessto say
that the state of affairs in the world or in some part of the world is by nature frightful. And if the question as
formulated in translation 1 could be made sense of, the fundamental answer given is irrelevant to the question
asked: we are not told how things are (whether by nature or otherwise) when we are told that they are equally
indifferent, unmeasurable, and inarbitrable. Either, therefore, the "answer" given to the question posed makes no
sense, or the question posed makes no sense given the answer. The question arises, therefore, whether the
unintelligibility of
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_26
next page >
Page 26
the question as formulated is an accurate reflection of the Greek original. I see no reason to believe that it is.
If translation 1's formulation of the fundamental question makes no sense, its formulation of the fundamental
answer makes none either. It makes no sense to say that things are inarbitrable (or arbitrable): the category of
arbitrability is inapplicable to things; it is applicable only to human conflict, disputes, disagreements, and the like
(as in the Latin original of the word). Burnet's formulation of the fundamental answer, in translation 2, is equally
unintelligible. It makes no sense to say that things are incapable of being tested: the category of testability is
inapplicable to things, being applicable only to conjectured characterizations of things. Such considerations are
equally applicable to the translations by Stough, Long, Sedley, and Annas and Barnes. With all these formulations,
our earlier question arises again: Is the unintelligibility of these formulations of the fundamental answer an
accurate reflection of the Greek original, or is it something superimposed on the latter by way of a translation cut to
the cloth of general skepticism?
The third point concerns the warrant for the translations. Of all the translators, only Stough advances a justification
of her translation of the fundamental answer (sentence 3 translation 3) to the fundamental question (sentence 2).
The rest advance their translations as if there were nothing controversial or questionable about them, and as if there
were nothing controversial or questionable about the interpretations based on those translations (the translations
themselves already embodying interpretations). (The most recent interpretationin the massive two-volume study by
A. A. Long and D. N. Sedleybegins with early Pyrrhonism, that is to say with Pyrrho, about whom the authors
reproduce accounts from a number of ancient sources, and then devote three large pages of fine print to
philosophical commentary and interpretationwith not a word about their translations. Annas and Barnes too find
nothing in their translation of the Pyrrho-text which merits comment, discussion, or justification.)
Stough begins her extended discussion of her translation (Greek Skepticism, 1734) with her translation of
adiaphora, "indeterminable." Acknowledging that the term's sentential context is capable of more than one
interpretation, she concludes (by questionable reasoning) that the meaning of sentence 3 is that "the nature of
things cannot be known" (18), "thus at the very outset a statement of Pyrrho's skepticism," which she earlier (4)
interprets as general skepticism. Adiaphora she treats as the fundamental term in sentence 3; astathm ta and
anepikrita she views as explanatory of adiaphora (18 n. 5). Recognizing that it was used by the early Stoics in an
ethical context to apply to entities or acts that are neither good nor bad but "indifferent," she then claims that in
sentence 3 the term has the extended sense (though she does not put it so) of aphasia, ''non-assertion," the refusal
to affirm (accept) or deny (reject) anything (the doctrine

< previous page

Page 27
we have already seen in Sextus, and seen misinterpreted), remaining neutral "for the reasons supplied by astathm
ta and anepikrita."
But what justification is there for thinking that in sentence 3 the term adiaphora has the extended sense which she
translates as "indeterminable" and then interprets as "unknowable"? I argue above that it makes no sense to say of
things, one by one or collectively, that they are indeterminable; I contend here that there is nothing in sentence 3 or
in the whole Pyrrho-text or in any other source of information about Pyrrho (e.g., the extended account supplied by
Diogenes Laertius) that warrants her translation and interpretation of adiaphora.
To begin at the beginning, adiaphora (like astathm ta and anepikrita) is a verbal adjective of the kind classified in
classical Greek grammars as an alpha-privative. It is a derivative of the verb diaph ro (with the negating alpha
prefixed), whose basic sense is to differ or to be different from (Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon). Thus,
adiaphora's basic meaning is "not different" in contexts such as x is not different from y (in this or that respect).
The term does indeed have an extended sense: for example, in the early Stoics whose ethical doctrine distinguished
three classes of actsthe ethically good, bad, and indifferent or neutral (neither good nor bad). Sextus himself notes
that the term is used in three senses: in the first, of that which is an object of neither inclination nor disinclination:
in the second, of that which, though it is an object of inclination or disinclination, is not particularly such an
object; and in the third, of that which contributes neither to happiness nor unhappiness (P.iii.177). Nowhere,
however, does he recognize the sense given to it by Stough and then interpreted as "unknowable." For
"indeterminable'' there are other terms in Greek.
In the Greek-English Lexicon (unabridged; the abridged twenty-sixty edition supplies only two senses), Liddell and
Scott list five different meanings in English for adiaphora: "Not different," "indifferent," "undiscriminating,"
"indistinguishable," and "having no logical differentia." Since "indeterminable" is not among them, the question is
where Stough got it and how. It will not do to say that Long's "indistinguishable" (in translation 4, sentence 3) and
Sedley's "undifferentiated" (in translation 5, sentence 3) are close enough. Stough's "indeterminable" has a different
meaning and conveys a different doctrine, and such terms have to be used with great care in a philosophical
context. What justifies going from "indistinguishable," which is supplied by Liddell and Scott, to "indeterminable,"
which is not? And why suppose that Pyrrho himself meant "unknowable" or "indeterminable" or
"indistinguishable" instead of the simpler and more natural "indifferent" used in translations 1, 2 and 6? He was
famous, indeed notorious, in his day for his detachment from all matters and so for the degree to which he had
attained ataraxia, in some measure a consequence of the influence of Indian spiritual masters he is reported to have
met in India when he accompanied Alexander the Great during the latter's military campaign into the Punjab.

The interpretive translations of the six translators seem as objectionable and questionable at many other points as I
have made them out to be at the points already considered; but as I lack the space to deal with them all in detail, I
must now deal with all the translations in more general terms. Questions arise about the Pyrrho-text and its
translations which do not seem to have arisenthere being no evidence that they havein the minds of any of the
translators. If Pyrrho-Timon had meant to say in Greek what some of our translators have him saying in
Englishthat things are indeterminablewhy did he not say so in Greek? There are wordsfor example, aoristos
("unbounded, indefinite, indeterminate, indeterminable" in Liddell and Scott)that in fact Sextus uses (see section
2.1.2, formula) to convey just this sense, which Pyrrho-Timon might have used to say, quite explicitly, that all
things are indeterminable. Why take the strange course of using adiaphora, which does not obviously mean
"indeterminable" and which, to the best of my knowledge, no other Greek philosopher uses in that sense?
There is a more fundamental question. Anyone who inspects the six translations without preconceptions can see
that in none of them does Pyrrho-Timon say that knowledge is impossible, and so forth, or that truth is
unattainable, and so forth. If Pyrrho-Timon had meant to say that the nature of things is unknowable (which, not
so incidentally, does not entail saying that things are unknowable: I can know innumerable men without knowing
the nature of man; innumerable material objects without knowing the nature of matter; innumerable works of art
without knowing the nature of art; innumerable works of philosophy without knowing the nature of philosophy),
why did he not say so in so many words? The text contains no knowledge-terms at all. Why, therefore, use
adiaphora (or astathm ta, or anepikrita) when those terms cannot by any stretch of the imagination be used to
convey a knowledge-proposition, and above all when the Greek language of his time and for centuries earlier had
the resources to convey just such propositions: gnosis, agnoston, ismen, gignoskein, and eidenai, among others?
Using these terms and/or others, he could have said that knowledge is impossible, and so forth, or that truth is
unattainable, and so forth. Such epistemic terms were in wide use by Greek philosophers both in his time and long
before his time by Aristotle, Plato, the early Stoics, Democritus, Xenophanes, and Metrodorus. Some of themfor
example, Metrodorus of Chioshad even used one or the other of these terms to convey what has been interpreted
by many scholars and philosophers as a form of general skepticism: "None of us knows anything, not even the
very fact whether we know or do not know; nor do we know what it is not to know or to know, nor in general
whether anything is or is not" (cf. L.i.88 for the Greek text of the first half of the quotation; and note the echoes in
sentence 4 of the Greek of Pyrrho-Timon). Gorgias had used other terms to convey what has been interpreted by
many scholars and philosophers as another form of

general skepticism: "first, nothing exists; second, even if anything exists it is inapprehensible by man; and third,
even if anything is apprehensible, it is certainly inexpressible and incommunicable to one's neighbor" (L.i. 656),
which Sextus then reformulatesI reproduce only the relevant second clauseas "even if anything exists it is
unknowable (agnoston) and inconceivable (anepino ton) by man" (L.i.77: one of the rare texts, cited in its original
formL.i.65by Hamlyn in The Theory of Knowledge [8 n. 1], where he evidently takes it at face value). Metrodorus
is a fourth-century figure, and Gorgias takes us back into the fifth. According to all the accounts available to us, all
this was known to Pyrrhoboth the epistemic terms and the Greek philosophers who used these and other epistemic
terms to formulate epistemological doctrine, skeptical or not. Timon, a personal acquaintance, attributes knowledge
of Sophists to Pyrrho in his Pytho and Silli (cf. Diogenes Laertius, Loeb Classical Library [2:479] and the account
of Pyrrho's life [2: chap. 11]). Yet Pyrrho makes no use of any of it in the text widely interpreted (after what in my
judgment is unwarranted translation) as a declaration of general skepticism. That is not credible.
The Pyrrho-text does indeed contain some epistemic and semantic terms: aisth sis, doxas, aleithuein, and
pseudesthae. But even with the help of these the text does not say in so many words that knowledge is impossible,
that truth is unattainable, that nothing is true (as in fact Sextus does), or that everything is false, and so on, ringing
all the changes we will. What it says at most is that two thingstwo classes of things: aisth sis and doxasare neither
true nor false; but no matter how anyone translates these two terms ("sense experience" and "belief" respectively,
by Stough; "senses" and "opinions'' by Burnet; "sensations" and "opinions" by Long and Sedley; or "senses" and
"judgments" by Annas and Barnes), the interpretation of the whole text as a statement of general skepticism would
be justified only if in addition we knew that according to Pyrrho-Timon aisth sis were the sole source or means of
knowledge and doxas the sole means of expressing it. But that is just whatto go by the given text or indeed by any
additional information or speculation provided by Diogenes Laertius, Aristocles, Cicero, Seneca, and above all by
Sextus Empiricuswe cannot know: the text advances no generalization to the effect that knowledge is obtainable, if
obtainable at all, solely by means of aisth sis, and that it is expressible, if expressible at all, solely in terms of
doxas.
That the inference does make, or imply, such a generalization is speculation unwarranted by any evidence available
in the text or anywhere else. For example, everyone who reads the Pyrrho-text in terms of general skepticism and
cites a certain text from Timon cites it as evidence of Pyrrho's general skepticism: "Aged Pyrrho, how and whence
did you find escape from slavery to the opinions and empty thought of the sophists and break the bonds of all
deceit and persuasion? You were not concerned to inquire what winds blow over Greece, and the origin

and destination of each thing." 30 But to interpret this Timon-text as a statement of general skepticism is again
unwarranted: escape from slavery to the opinions of the Sophists and unconcern about such physical and
metaphysical questions as those about the winds blowing over Greece and about the origins and destination of each
thing (these being questions central in the inquiries of the pre-Socratics, first and foremost among the Milesians) is
evidence not of general skepticismwhere are the denials of the possibility of knowledge?but of a certain
detachment from sophistical views and physical-metaphysical inquiries of just the "dogmatic" kind which Sextus is
concerned to repudicate as futile and unresolved if not unresolvable.
It is likewise unwarranted to claim that the Pyrrho-text entails that further inquiry about the world need not even
commence once the truth about the world"that it is in its own nature undifferentiated, unmeasurable, and
unjudgeable"31has been announced: this interpretation contradicts everything else that is reported about Pyrrho: for
example, that he traveled to India with Alexander the Great for the express purpose of inquiring about the world of
Indian culture; that he made fundamental changes in his mode of life as a consequence of what he
heardunveridically?an Indian saying to his companion Anaxarchus;32 and that by Diogenes' account Pyrrho does
all the things he is supposed to have eschewed as a general skepticmakes judgments, makes assertions, makes
discriminations, distinctions, and determinationsas indeed it is quite impossible to avoid doing.
This interpretation contradicts even the very Pyrrho-text itself, which does what, according to a number of
translations, the text is supposed to be saying cannot be done: discriminates between aisth sis and doxas, between
al thuein and pseudesthai, between adiaphora and astathm ta and anepikrita, between aphasia and phasis, and
between ataraxia and taraxis. If the world were, as Pyrrho-Timon is supposed to be saying and believing that it is,
an undifferentiated and featureless blob, on what possible basis could he be making the discriminations and
distinctions which he everywhere unfailingly makes? If Pyrrho had rejected all belief and even assertion (Annas
and Barnes), what was he doing inand how are we to construethe Pyrrho-text itself? And if he was supposed to
have advised and adopted speechlessness (Long and Sedley, Hamlyn, Burnet), how could he have advised it
without speech, and how, after having advised and adopted it, could he have continued chattering so cheerfully to
the end of his ninety years? None of this makes any sense on the basis of general skepticism (except on the further
supposition that Pyrrho was so unobservant that he failed in ninety years to detect his gross inconsistencies); but it
makes the best of sense on our interpretation of Sextus and of his interpretation of Pyrrho. But all these
inconsistencies and discrepancies are created by the translations; they are not to be found in the Greek text itself.

There is a still more fundamental general question, relevant to all classical Greek texts whether philosophical or
not (e.g., poetic, dramatic, or narrative), to which I must now address myself. I have hitherto allowed Hamlyn's
fourth version of general skepticismthat we never know anything (cf. Metrodorus' "None of us knows anything ")to
pass without comment; but it must now be said that the formulation is unacceptable as a version of general
skepticism. 33 General skepticism in any philosophically significant sense must be formulated in modal termsfor
example, in the version that knowledge is impossible or in the version that truth is unattainable. It is for that reason
among others that the six translators have Pyrrho maintaining that things are indeterminable, unmeasurable,
inarbitrable, untestable, indiscriminable, unjudgeable, unfathomable, and so on. If they had translated the Greek as
undetermined, unmeasured, unarbitrated, untested, undiscriminated, unjudged, unfathomed, and so on, the
doctrinal outcome would not be general skepticism in any philosophically significant sense but mere
ignorancecontingent, temporary, circumstantial, and superable: the situation of any ordinary or scientific
investigator who for the time being has not determined, measured, arbitrated, tested, discriminated, judged, or
fathomed whatever it is that he is investigating. Hence the modal terms and the modal formulations.
All these considerations are linked to a strange feature of classical Greek. It is a feature unmentioned by any of the
six translator-interpreters or in any other literature known to me that deals with the culture (philosophical, poetic,
dramatic, narrative, scientific, religious, etc.) of ancient Greece,34 and so neither these translators nor any other
student of ancient Greek or Hellenistic philosophy takes account of it in his translations and interpretations (e.g.,
A. E. Taylor, W. K. C. Guthrie, F. M. Cornford, G. E. L. Owen, Kirk and Raven, and J. Barnes). In English,
French, and Latin there are (although not invariably even in these languages) distinctive linguistic means of
indicating the difference in meaning between verbs and their related or derived verbal adjectives: in English,
educate and educable, extricate and extricable, discover and discoverable, experience and experienceable, perceive
and perceivable, know and knowable; in French inconnu and inconnaissable; in Latin indeterminatus and
indeterminabilis. In classical Greek that is not the case: one linguistic form serves for two or more distinct
meanings, depending upon contextabatos for "untrodden," "not to be trodden," and "inaccessible"; aneureton for
"not found out" (as a matter of fact), ''not to be found out" (forbidden?), and "undiscoverable" (in principle beyond
the reach of the discoverer-to-be); adiaphora for "not different" (as a matter of fact), "indifferent"
(psychologically), "neutral" (ethically), and "indistinguishable" (in principle beyond the capacity of the perceiver-
to-be to distinguish); anepikrita for "undecided" (as a matter of fact) and "undecidable" (in principle

Page 32
beyond the capacity of the decider-to-be); agnoston for "unknown" (as a matter of contingent fact) and
"unknowable" (in principle beyond the reach of the knower-to-be).
This means that, unlike English, French, and Latin, classical Greek (not the Koine of the New Testament or the
demotic of modern Greece) lacks distinctive linguistic forms to express the distinct meanings expressed by the
pairs undiscovered and undiscoverable, undetermined and indeterminable, unapprehended and inapprehensible,
unconceived and inconceivable, uncommunicated and incommunicable, undecided and undecidable (or unresolved
and unresolvable), untested and untestable, unknown and unknowable, and so on for all the alpha-privatives, or at
any rate for all those I have checked, which number in the scores. This is not to say that classical Greek is
incapable of expressing such modal meaningsfor example, that reality is unknowable or that truth is
undiscoverable. On the contrary. But when it does so and does so unambiguously, it does so first by means of
locutions (e.g., "the truth cannot be apprehended" [P.i.2]) which can then be legitimately and acceptably equated
with assertions formulated in terms of the related verbal adjectives, especially in their alpha-privative form (e.g.,
akatal pton, "unapprehended" or "inapprehensible''), which otherwise are ambiguous or equivocal.
These facts about classical Greek are of the utmost importance in the assessment of the philosophical significance
of the Pyrrho-text and indeed of all texts like it in the relevant respects (e.g., that of Metrodorus of Chios already
quoted and that of Gorgias). Given a sentence like number 3 in the Pyrrho-text, how translate and then interpret it?
The three crucial predicate-terms in it are alpha-privative verbal adjectives: adiaphora, astathm ta, and anepikrita.
All three have been translated modally by almost all six translators. But the three words are equally translatable
nonmodally: undetermined instead of indeterminable, and so on. How, then, decide which it is to be? On that
decision hangs the interpretation of the sentence, and of all sentences like it, as a statement of general skepticism.
I have already indicated the answer: the decision can be made solely in terms of the context of the
sentencecontexts like that (but not only like that) which I cite in the case of a text of Sextus. Although he uses
alpha-privatives in sentences that, out of context, in isolation, are ambiguous and translatable in the very different
ways already noted, he in fact uses them in contexts which make it clearbecause the idea is expressed in terms of
other locutions that are themselves unambiguousthat the alpha-privative is to be translated modally. But such a
context is precisely what is lacking in the Pyrrho-text (hence my emphasis upon the extreme brevity of the text):
there are no other sentences in the text that do not use alpha-privatives and that nevertheless convey the modal
sentential meanings by means of modal terms which, according to all six translators (and all those other
interpreters, like Hamlyn and Russell, who provide no translation),
 
< previous page

< previous page

Page 33
sentence number 3 conveys. I conclude, then, that there is no textual or other evidence justifying these modal
translations, and therefore no justification for the subsequent interpretation of the whole text as a statement of
general skepticism.
2.1.4 Four principles of interpretation. In section 2.1 I have so far examined the prime exhibits among the ancient
skeptics in achronological order: the last of the Greek Skeptics first, and the first of them last. There are two very
important reasons for such order. The first is that in the case of Sextus, uniquely, there is an enormous mass of
primary data (four volumes' worth in the Loeb edition) on the solid basis of which to formulate a conception of the
Skeptics' (and especially Sextus') philosophical outlook; there is nothing even remotely comparable in the case of
all the remaining Greek Skeptics and the others. The second is that the very plethora of data in the case of Sextus
and the dearth of data in the case of Pyrrho suggests principles of interpretation with the help of which we can
more soundly interpret such texts, so ambiguous and difficult to interpret, as that of Pyrrho-Timon and, indeed, of
all the remaining prime exhibits (and all such texts whether philosophical or not, for that matter). 35
In the Pyrrho-text there are just six sentences, only four of which are directly relevant to my present concerns, just
two of which are central, and only one of which is at the very center of the center. Consider now what the
predicament of translators and interpreters of Sextus would have been if the textual data had been as minimal and
meager as the Pyrrho-Timon data are. I divided the Sextus data into two classes: those that seem to support my
eleven theses and those that seem to contradict them. Then I pointed out that Sextus advances numerous
formulasnot just one, or two, or four, or six, but a great many moresome of which (but only some of which) have
been cited by those who interpret him as a general skeptic. The extraordinary and startling fact is that it is possible,
out of the mass of data available in the Sextus corpus, to select four sentences and to construct a "Sextus-text"
which corresponds almost perfectly to the Pyrrho-text. Almost certainly, in the absence of all the other data I have
adduced in support of my eleven theses, the conclusion would have been drawn by almost everyoneas it has with
respect to Pyrrhothat Sextus is a general skeptic: and almost certainly that conclusion would have been erroneous,
if all the counterconsiderations adduced in the course of our enquiry are what I say they are.
What is it, then, that makes it possible to avoid that conclusion (which I have resisted and questioned, in the first
place, fundamentally because it is incredible)? In the broadest terms, two things: Sextus' own practice and his own
explanations (section 2.1.2.1 and interspersed throughout section 2.1.2.2). On the explanatory side there are four
things of crucial importance: definitions of key doctrines and key terms; explanations that do not amount to full
definitions of key doctrines and key terms; a very large number of concrete examples and illustrations; and,
overall, a comprehensive context consisting of thousands of assertions,

< previous page

Page 34
judgments, and explanations systematically set forth, in the light of which interpretation is greatly facilitated.
The four principles of interpretationto be quite explicitare formulable, then, as follows: If an isolated philosophical
text is to be adequately interpreted and even translated, then at least four conditions must be satisfied: first, the key
doctrines and key terms must be identified and defined; second, in the absence of such definitions, explanations
that approximate definitions for such key doctrines and key terms must be provided; third, whether definitions and
explanations are or are not provided, concrete examples and illustrations of various important aspects of the
doctrine must be provided, the more examples and illustrations of the more aspects the better; and fourth and
finally, the isolated text must be embedded in the context of a comprehensive and systematic text. Without the
satisfaction of these conditions, at the very least, the translation and subsequent interpretation (or just
interpretation, if the interpreter and the interpreted are using the same language) of an isolated philosophical text is
little better than educated guesswork. We can see such guesswork operating in scholarly and philosophical
attempts to translate and then to interpret the Ionians, the Pythagoreans, the Eleatics, and the Sophists, some of
whose surviving fragments form a total text far more extensive than that of the Pyrrho-text; and we can see it
operating where philosophers such as Spinoza, Hegel, Whitehead, and Wittgenstein are concerned, whose
published works form a total text incomparably greater in extent and hardly less obscure than the Pyrrho-text.
Not one of the four principles of interpretationwhich I would be inclined to call obvious, except that they seem
never to have been noticed or formulated beforeis satisfied by that text. Whatever the key doctrines and terms are,
none of them is defined, none of them is explained, none of them is illustrated by example, and no contextcertainly
no comprehensive and systematic contextis provided. What does Pyrrho-Timon mean when he asks, hopoia
pephuke ta pragmata? The problem in this case is not one of translation: the correct translation is unquestionably,
in my judgment, that of Burnet and Stough. The problem is what the translated question means. The text provides
no explanation. What, when he/they say that things are equally adiaphora? The text provides no explanation. What,
when it says that things are equally astathm ta? The text provides no explanation. What, when it says that things
are equally anepikrita? The text provides no explanation. When, on the basis of the central assertion in the text
(section 3), the text goes on to say (sentence 4) that neither aisth sis nor doxa is true or false, how are we to
understand these key terms and key denials? Neither aisth sis nor doxa is defined or explained in the text itself,
nor are they illustrated by means of examples in the text itself; and none of Pyrrho's contemporaries or near-
contemporaries or interested later commentatorsTimon, Diogenes Laertius,

Page 35
Cicero, Seneca, and otherssupplies definitions, explanations, or illustrations.
What are we to take to be the scope or extension of these terms? Does every possible assertion we makefor
example, the assertion by Pyrrho that he accompanied Alexander the Great on his military expedition of conquest
to India, and all those by Pyrrho reported in the extended account by Diogenes Laertius, and for that matter all
those recorded in the Pyrrho-Timon text itselffall into the category of doxa? Does every possible mode of
apprehension of which we seem to be capable (the apprehension of physical objects by sense, of logical relations
by reason, of our own states of consciousness by intuition, and so on) fall into the category of aisth sis, or is it the
only or only possible mode of apprehension, according to Pyrrho-Timon? If the latter (as the six interpreters
clearly think), then how are we to construe the statement that things are equally adiaphora, and so on, and the two
following inferences that neither aisth sis nor doxa has any truth value and that we should not trust either (a
statement and inferences which the six interpreters do not undertake to explain)? Does the statement that things are
equally adiaphora, and so on, itself have any truth value and cognitive value? Does the statement that neither aisth
sis nor doxa has any truth value itself have any truth and cognitive value? What about the statement that the
outcome for those who adopt the recommended attitude will be ataraxia? How are we supposed to construe that? It
it supposed to be true? And if so, only true but not known or even believed to be true? We can only stumble
blindly in a pitch-black swamp, sinking deeper with every step.
Given the contextor lack of itthese questions are bottomless, unanswerable in the absence of the satisfaction of the
four principles of interpretation. But they arise only on the ground that Pyrrho is a general skeptic; they are
otherwise groundless, and do not arise on our interpretation of Sextus and Sextus' interpretation in turn of Pyrrho.
2.1.5 The remaining "general skeptics": a short-cut through them. If I were to deal with the remaining prime
exhibits among the supposed general skeptics in the ancient world as I have dealt with Sextus Empiricus and
Pyrrho, the length of this study would become intolerable. Fortunately, there is a shortcut through all of them by
way of the four principles of interpretation. It consists in the following claim: if the principles of interpretation
elicited in my examination of Sextus and applied to Pyrrho are applied to any of the remaining supposed general
skeptics, the conclusion is the same as it was for Sextus and Pyrrhothat the interpretation of them as general
skeptics is mistaken, being unwarranted by the available evidence and ruled out by application of the four
principles. In the case of Metrodorus of Chios, for examplewhose single surviving sentence Barnes cites, quotes,
takes at its face value, and unhesitatingly interprets as a statement

< previous page

Page 36
of general skepticism 36I unhesitatingly repudiate the interpretation in accordance with the principles of
interpretation: the total absence of definitions, explanations, examples, and context. This can be done with every
one of the remaining alleged general skeptics: all those Greek Skeptics we haven't dealt with in detail (Timon of
Phlius, Arcesilaus of Pitane, Carneades of Cyrene, Aenesidemus, and Agrippa), the Greek Sophists (Protagoras and
Gorgias),37 and then Democritus, Leucippus, and Xenophanes.
My general conclusion, then, is that in the case of Sextus (the only supposed skeptic for whom there is a mass of
primary data) there is overwhelming reason to believe that he is not a general skeptic, and that in the case of all the
rest there is woefully insufficient reason to believe that any of them is. This amounts to saying that thesis 7the
existence thesis about general skepticsis either false or is unwarranted by the evidence; and that implies that thesis
3the genetic thesis about the conditions under which epistemology and its problems arise (e.g., Russell, Ayer,
Hamlyn, Quine, and Pollock)is false, or is at any rate unwarranted by the evidence.
2.2 Plato, Epistemology, and General Skepticism: The Historical Thesis (Thesis 5) and the Genetic Thesis (Thesis
3) Revisited
2.2.1 My interest in the historical thesis is due exclusively to its alleged link with the genetic thesis (that Plato
originated epistemology in response to the general skepticism of the Sophists). However, at least one major
philosophical historian of pre-Socratic and early Greek philosophy does not subscribe to the historical thesis:
according to Jonathan Barnes, epistemology was invented by the early pre-Socratics, centuries before Plato.38 I am
myself prepared to acknowledge that Plato, if anyone, was the true originator of epistemology (at least in the sense
specified by Guthrie and Hamlyn) and that he originated it in the Theaetetus. But given what at bottom is at
stakethe very conception of epistemology, and more generally of philosophy, with all the massive implications of
such determinations about matters of the most fundamental and general human concernit must be said that the
notion of the founder, inventor, or originator of a discipline, especially of one as controversial as epistemology
(and more generally of philosophy), is too amorphous to sustain objective investigation and resolution of
disagreements such as that between Russell, Guthrie, Hamlyn, and company and Barnes. Especially where such
disciplines are concerned, there are no generally accepted criteria of the notion of originator, or any criteria at all,
for that matter. Thus it is that, depending in part upon the subjective inclinations of scholars, Aristotle is singled out
as the founder of metaphysics (Collingwood), although centuries earlier Parmenides engaged in recognizably
metaphysical speculation;
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_37

Page 37
Aristotle again as the founder of logic (Bochenski), or Leibniz instead (C. I. Lewis), although recognizably logical
speculations are to be found earlier than Leibniz or Aristotle.
2.2.2 If we take for granted the conception of epistemology with which Guthrie, Hamlyn, and company operate, it
is undeniable that Plato is the originator of epistemology. But if Barnes had taken the conception for granted, he
would have come to the same conclusion: there is just one philosopherPlatowho first satisfies their criteria. But that
conclusion exposes the unacceptability of their conception of epistemology. The epistemological enterprise is not,
except arbitrarily, to be confined to the investigation, more or less methodical and systematic, of the questions
these philosophers identify as basic for epistemology. Epistemological inquiries and speculations can go on and
have gone on in the absence of the epistemological enterprise as conceived in terms of those basic questions.
Philosophers universally recognized as epistemologists (recognized in fact by Russell, Guthrie, Hamlyn, and
others) 39 have engaged in it without dealing with their basic questions, especially with the question which they
identify as the most basic: "What is the nature of knowledge?" It suffices to cite Hume: in the Treatise and
Enquiries his treatment of the concept of knowledge is at best perfunctory and derivative, nowhere approaching
that of Plato, nowhere making knowledge itself the main or even a considerable subject of investigation, and
nowhere engaging in a search for the essence of knowledge. By the Guthrie-Hamlyn criteria, Hume is not an
epistemologist at all. But Hume is an epistemologist, and so it is the criteria which are too restrictive and thus
inadequate.
This shows that it is possible to engage in recognizably epistemological inquiry and speculation that is not confined
to the questions or pursued in the ways specified by Guthrie, Hamlyn, and company. As Parmenides engaged in
metaphysical speculation, despite the unquestionable preeminence in some sense of Aristotle, so too did many of
the pre-Socratic philosophers engage in epistemological inquiry and speculation, despite the acknowledged
preeminence (again unquestionable) of Plato and the unprecedented character of his epistemological inquiries in the
Theaetetus. But these two features of Plato's epistemological investigations, although relevant to some questions,
are irrelevant to the most basic, which is whether epistemology in the sense of epistemological inquiries and
speculations, not in the arbitrary sense laid down by Hamlyn and Guthrie, arose in response to general skepticism.
My answer to that basic question is that there is no evidence in the surviving literature of any of these pre-Socratic
or pre-Platonic philosophers (the so-called fragments) that their epistemological inquiries and speculations arose in
response to general skepticism.40
2.2.3 There is, furthermore, no evidence in the Platonic dialogues that Plato's epistemological investigations, even
in the Theaetetus (the locus, according to Guthrie, Hamlyn, and company, of Plato's invention of epistemology),
arose in

Page 38
response to general skepticism, and conclusive evidence that it did not. In the Theaetetus, Plato begins cafter the
usual preparatory introduction) by having Socrates say (145B) that he cannot make out what knowledge is; and
very soon, after some fumbling misstarts, Theaetetus proposes the theory that knowledge (epist m ) is perception
(aisth sis). it is one of three theories of knowledge advanced and critically examined in the dialogue, the second
being that knowledge is true opinion (al th s dox [187B]) and the third being that knowledge is true opinion
accompanied by an account (logos [201C]). But even these meager data suffice to show that in the very dialogue in
which Plato is supposed to have founded or originated epistemology, which up to that point is supposed to have
been nonexistent (like the non-Euclidean geometries invented by Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann),
Plato begins at the very outset by considering a theory of knowledgea central component of any complete
epistemologythat existed before he began to consider it. The same is true of the remaining two theories of
knowledge, none of which was ever held by Plato or Socrates, and the third of which is expressly ascribed by
Theaetetus (201C) to someone unnamed who, having made the distinction between knowledge and true judgment
or opinion, also advanced just this theory that knowledge is true judgment plus an account (or explanation, or
reason: in short, justification). Something very like the first theory is traceable to Heraclitus: not that knowledge is
perception but that it is obtainable by perception (fragments 55, 101a, and 107).
It is true that shortly after Theaetetus advances the first theoryin response not to general skepticism but to Socrates'
questionsSocrates proceeds to identify the theory with various statements of Protagoras: first that man is the
measure of all things, and so on, and then that any given thing is to one perceiver of it whatever it appears to that
perceiver to be and is to a second perceiver whatever it appears to the second to be, "appearing" (phantasia) then
being interpreted by Socrates to mean "perceiving" (152C). Subsequently combining Theaetetus' first theory of
knowledge, construed in such quasi-Protagorean terms (for which there is in fact no known historical justification),
with a Cratylus-like extreme version of Heraclitean doctrine to the effect that everything is always changing
(152C153D), Socrates then argues that this composite doctrine (never held by anyone) has two absurd and
intolerable consequences: first, that knowledge is impossible; second, that all discourse is impossible (179C183D).
Here at last is the thesis of general skepticismconcocted by ''interpretation" and ascribable to nobodythat our own
contemporaries have made so much of in their conceptions of epistemology and of its proper functions. Plato-
Socrates then proceeds to subject the composite doctrine and its consequences to severe criticism.
But Plato's epistemological opposition to general skepticism, which is undeniable, is one thing; the question of
what prompted his epistemological investigations is another. My thesis is that there is no evidence in the Theaetetus
or in any
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_39

Page 39
of his other dialogues that they arose in response to general skepticism. The first theory of knowledge advanced in
the Theaetetus is advanced not in response to general skepticism (of which there is no trace at that point or earlier
in the dialogue) but in response to a series of questions put by Socrates to Theaetetus: first, which of the young
men of Athens are thought likely to attain distinction? (143C); second, is Theaetetus learning astronomy and the
other subjects from Theodorus? (145C); third, does learning about something mean becoming wiser about it?
(145D); fourth, is wisdom in any way different from knowledge? (145D); and finally, after Theaetetus has
answered the fourth question by saying that wisdom and knowledge are the same thing, Socrates' expression of
puzzlement"That is precisely what I am puzzled about. I cannot make out to my own satisfaction what knowledge
is" (145E). Shortly thereafter, as noted above, the first theory of knowledge is elicited under the stimulus of further
Socratic questioning. The question of general skepticism does not even arise in the dialogue until the first theory of
knowledge has been elicited by means of other, wholly nonskeptical questions; and the question does not arise at
all in connection with the second and third theories of knowledge.
2.2.4 There is not only no evidence in the Theaetetus that its epistemological investigations were engendered or
prompted (Quine's term) by general skepticism; there is evidence elsewhere in the dialoguesin my judgment
conclusive evidencethat Plato's epistemological investigations were not so engendered. There is a consensus among
contemporary Plato scholars that Plato's dialogues fall into chronological groupings designated as early, middle,
and late. There is also a consensus that the central focus of the early group of dialogues is moral-ethical; of the
middle group, metaphysical; and of the late group, ontological and epistemological. 41 The Theaetetus, it is
generally agreed, falls into the late group. If, then, there are dialogues that are earlier than the Theaetetus and that
engage in epistemological inquiry without being prompted by or arising in response to general skepticism (whether
that of the Sophists or of any of the pre-Socratics, none of whom, according to my investigation in 2.1, is a general
skeptic), there is evidence, and conclusive evidence, that Plato's epistemological investigations, like those of all
classical epistemologists (from Parmenides to Chisholm), arose in response to other considerations which are
largely if not wholly nonskeptical in nature (for which see section 3.2). There are in fact at least six such dialogues:
the Meno, the Phaedo, the Republic, the Symposium, and the Phaedrus, all of which belong to the middle period,
and the Charmides, in the early period. All contain investigations of the concept of knowledge (although none to
the extent that the Theaetetus and the Sophist do), but none does so in response to general skepticism or, indeed,
skepticism of any kind.
Having concluded in section 2.1 that the existence thesis and the genetic thesis are false, I now find my conclusion
reinforced by this examination of Plato. To

that conclusion, therefore, I now add the conclusion that the historical thesis, too, is false.
2.3 An Analytic Theory of Knowledge in the Context of an Analytic Theory of Epistemology: Thesis 2 and Thesis
1
2.3.1 Roderick Chisholm has posed two fundamental questions of epistemology: "What do we knowin other words,
what is the extent of our knowledge? And how are we to decide, in any particular case, whether we knowin other
words, what are the criteria of knowing?" 42 My question is: Is it possible for a philosopher who subscribes to an
analytic theory of knowledge in the context of an analytic theory of epistemology to answer those questions, and if
so, how? Hamlyn, for one, endorses the idea of a complete epistemology;43 but what he understands by the idea
neither he nor any other adherent of analytic epistemology defines or explains. Nevertheless, he does two things
that make it possible to determine what he takes a complete epistemology to be. He defines epistemology as "that
branch of philosophy which is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, its presuppositions and basis,
and the general reliability of claims to knowledge" ("Epistemology,'' 89);44 and in more or less general terms he
lays out the philosophical problems about knowledge as those concerned with the nature and general conditions of
knowledge, the scope of knowledge, and special disciplines and fields of knowledge (e.g., science, mathematics,
history, and religion; whence philosophy of science, of mathematics, of history, and of religion [Theory of
Knowledge, 37, esp. 7]). A complete epistemology, then, would presumably be one that deals with all the essential
problems of epistemology indicated in the definition of epistemology and specified in general terms in the account
of the philosophical problems about knowledge. It would seem, then, that Hamlyn's reference to the scope of
knowledge is the equivalent of Chisholm's reference to the extent of knowledge, and that Hamlyn's reference to the
general reliability of claims to knowledge is the equivalent of Chisholm's reference to the decision problem. In The
Theory of Knowledge, the whole of part 1 ("The Conditions of Knowledge") is concerned to establish the
possibility of knowledge-in-general in opposition to general skepticism, and the whole of part 2 ("The Scope of
Knowledge") is concerned to establish the possibility of knowledge-in-special ("whole ranges of forms of
knowledge" [6]; knowledge by perception, knowledge by memory, knowledge of oneself and others, and a priori
knowledge, respectively in chaps. 6, 7, 8, and 9) in opposition to the limited skepticisms with respect to perception
and so forth.
2.3.2 I can best answer my questionI show in section 3.1 how Chisholm answers his own questionsif I first set
forth an account of a complete epistemology

as it is conceived in the classical world tradition. 45 Epistemology so conceived (e.g., by Locke or Descartes) is
designed to answer Chisholm's two questions among others; and so classical epistemologists set up a fundamental
desideratum that guides the whole epistemological enterprisethat of providing a general critique of the grounds
upon which any knowledge-claim may be justified or refuted. In order to do this, classical epistemologists
formulate a system of principles by means of which any cognitive claimwhether a claim with respect to the formal
validity of any argument or with respect to the logical truth or empirical truth of any other sort of statementcan
rationally be assessed. In order to carry out such a rational assessment, conceptual clarification of the terms of
epistemic judgment is required, and the principles of assessment must themselves be justified. Thus, a complete
epistemology so conceived is in part desiderative (setting out the general purposes of the epistemological
enterprise), in part normative (setting out the general principles by means of which to determine the cognitive merit
of any cognitive claim), in part analytic (formulating the conceptual apparatus of epistemology), and in part
descriptive or metaphysical (providing an account of man's cognitive powers: perceptual, memorial, rational,
intuitional, etc.).
Logic classically conceived (from Aristotle to Quine) is thus a part of epistemology thus comprehensively
conceived. The fundamental desideratum of logicians in the classical tradition is the more limited one of the
assessment of the formal validity of any argument and the logical truth of any statement. In order to carry out that
task, classical logicians formulate general normative principles of formal validity and of logical truth (a truth-
functional argument is valid if and only if ; a truth-functional sentence is logically true if and only if ; and so on);
analyze or devise terms of logical appraisal (definitions of truth-functional connectives and of logical validity,
implication, equivalence, and so on); analyze decision procedures (for deciding, given any argument, whether it is
valid, etc., or not) and of proof procedures (for determining, given any argument, that its conclusion is formally
derivable from its premises if in fact the conclusion is derivable, or, given any premises, what conclusions are
formally derivable from them); and formulate principles and procedures for paraphrasing arguments and statements
couched in ordinary or extraordinary (e.g., scientific, metaphysical, religious, or theological) language into logical
form and then reducing these logical paraphrases to logical schemata, to which the formal techniques of logic are
then applicable. So when logicians speak of the scope of logic in general, or of the scope of its branches (truth-
functional, syllogistic, monadic-quantificational, general-quantificational, identity), they are speaking of its general
power to assess any argument (as formally valid or invalid) or any statement (as true by virtue of its logical form,
or not).46
That is how the scope of classical epistemology too (sufficiently developed, of

Page 42
course) is conceived: in terms of its capacity, when applied, to assess the cognitive merit of any knowledge-claim
framed in the form of an argument or inference or statement purporting to be true by virtue of its logical form or in
virtue of the facts of reality. As classical logicians provide or attempt to provide an answer to Chisholm's two
questions in terms of logical matters ("What do we know logicallyin other words, what is the extent of our logical
knowledge? And how are we to decide, in any particular case of a claim to logical knowledge, whether we knowin
other words, what are the criteria of logical knowledge?"), so classical epistemologists provide or attempt to
provide an answer to those questions in terms of all matters, logical and nonlogical alike. That is precisely what
the applicability and so the utility of logic consists in, and that is precisely what the applicability and so the utility
of epistemology consists in. If the principles of logic were inapplicable to actual arguments and statements for the
purpose of assessing the merit of the cognitive claims made in terms of them, it would have no utility at all; and if
the principles of epistemology were inapplicable to actual knowledge-claims (e.g., knowledge-claims about the
existence and nature of God, of microscopic and macroscopic entities, in the present, in the past, or in the future,
of moral and spiritual questions, of political, social, and economic questions, and so on), epistemology too would
have no utility at all. Its capacity to apply to all actual and possible knowledge-claims is precisely what a complete
epistemology is, according to the classical conception of epistemology, whether they be the claims of common
sense, science, religion, theology, astrology, or whatever. The knowledge-claims of philosophers
themselveswhether moral, metaphysical, or epistemological philosophersfall under the jurisdiction of a complete
epistemology; and so do knowledge-claims about the very nature of epistemologyfor example, the claim that
epistemology is to be defined and/or otherwise explained in terms of general skepticism.
2.3.3 The idea, engendered by Hamlyn's definition of epistemology, that his conception of epistemology is
traditional 47 is soon dispelled by his pervasive critique of "traditional" epistemology: his repudiation of what he
takes to be its distinctive featuresits taking for granted the nature of knowledge, its seeking instead to establish
unshakeable foundations of knowledge by discovering certainties, indubitables, or infallibilities, its attempts to
counter general skepticism either by rationalist methods (Descartes) or by empiricist methods (Locke), its
architectural model of the structure of knowledge, and so on (Hamlyn, Theory of Knowledge, chap. 2). In fact,
however, his repudiation of the traditional or classical conception of epistemology is more radical than he himself
makes it out to be or, indeed, seems even to realize. When in his definition of epistemology he makes reference to
the general reliability of knowledge-claims, it is natural to take him to mean what classical epistemologists
meanfor example, Chisholm in his reference to the decision problem. And when in Hamlyn's account of the

Page 43
scope of a complete epistemology he makes reference to the scope of knowledge, it is natural to take him to mean
what classical epistemologists meanfor example, Chisholm in his reference to the extent of our knowledge
("extent" being a term which Hamlyn in fact uses in the very first sentence of the first chapter of his book, clearly
using it as a synonym of "scope")or what classical logicians mean when they speak of the scope of logic or of
logical knowledge.
But Hamlyn does not mean by "the scope of knowledge" what Chisholm means by "the extent of knowledge." 48
Hamlyn's account of the scope of knowledge is not an answer to Chisholm's question, "What do we knowin other
words, what is the extent of our knowledge?"; and Hamlyn's account of the general reliability of claims to
knowledge is not an answer to Chisholm's question, "How are we to decide, in any particular case, whether we
knowin other words, what are the criteria of knowing?" This failure is no accident or matter of oversight; it is a
matter of principle: it follows from the very conception of epistemology adopted by Hamlyn and all analytic
epistemologists. Let us see how and why this is so.
2.3.4 In the first sentence of the following passage we have Hamlyn's theory of knowledge; the rest of the passage
explains it:
One might say, in sum, that someone knows that p if he is in the appropriate position to certify or give his
authority to the truth of p. Someone will be in this position if one or more of a number of relevant
considerations do not rule it out. The considerations mentioned thus furnish necessary conditions of
knowledge. These two conditionstruth and belief in itare positive, but other necessary conditions of
knowledgeor some of them, at any rateare negative in form. The man who knows must not be guessing, he
must not hit on the truth by chance, he must not rely on bad reasons if he relies on reasons at all. It is the
fact that these conditions are negative that makes it impossible to give the sufficient conditions of
knowledge except in a vague and general formula of the kind that I have invoked. (Theory of Knowledge,
101)
But how is the theory to be used? What use can be made of it for the purpose of answering Chisholm's or
Hamlyn's question about the scope of knowledge? And how with its help are we to decide, in any particular case,
whether we know?
Consider standard procedure in logic when we are confronted, say, by a particular argument or particular statement,
and the question is how we are to decide in the case of this particular argument whether it is logically valid, or in
the case of the particular statement whether it is logically true. The typical procedure in logic is first to formulate a
definition of logical validity or of logical truth. But such definitions by themselves are insufficient for the purpose;
they have to be supplemented by a number of other elements of the total logical apparatus: first by the techniques
of logical paraphrase (putting the original argument into logical form) and logical schematization (reducing the
argument, now logically paraphrased, into abstract schematic form) and then by decision
 
< previous page

< previous page

Page 44
procedures and proof procedures. Without putting the original argument through the processes of logical
paraphrase and logical schematization and then applying the appropriate decision procedures or proof procedures
(this whole process being fully described in, e.g., Quine's Methods of Logic or in any comparable text), the original
argument's logical validity cannot be assessed (except intuitively).
So it is with Hamlyn's (or, for that matter, anyone's) theory of knowledge: by itself, unsupplemented, it is
insufficient for the purpose of answering Chisholm's question how we are to decide, with respect to any particular
p, whether we know p. How, then, does Hamlyn supplement it? In fact in no way: supplementation of it by means
of procedures or criteria which would enable anyone to determine, with respect to any particular p, that we know
or do not know p, forms no part of his "complete epistemology." When he initially explains his use of the
expression "the scope of knowledge," he explains it by the expression "what it is that in general deserves the title
of knowledge" and immediately adds:
I say "in general" because the problems that confront the philosopher here are not the specific ones of
whether any particular claims made by a scientist, an historian, or a specialist within any other discipline
deserve the name of knowledge. The verdict on such claims can be arrived at only by those with the
relevant specialist knowledge, or by those who have the techniques or knowledge of the methodology
appropriate for the discovery of the truth in question. The same is true even of particular claims to
knowledge made by the man in the street; for only those who have access to the relevant facts, who can
make the relevant inferences, and so on, are competent to pass judgment on such claims. (Theory of
Knowledge, 4)
What, then, according to Hamlyn, is it that the nontraditional or new epistemologist is investigating when he
investigates and seeks to determine the scope of knowledge? He says that an account of the nature of knowledge
may have further implications for further problems concerning the scope of knowledge (Theory of Knowledge, 4);
49 but theory of knowledge is an account of the nature of knowledge (9), and according to Hamlyn a correct
account of the nature of knowledge may serve to counter skepticism of the general and limited varieties by
depriving them of any justification. Thus, when Hamlyn seeks to determine the scope of knowledge, all he seeks to
determine is the possibility of knowledge-in-general, in opposition to the general skeptic who says that knowledge-
in-general is impossible, and the possibility of knowledge-in-special (knowledge by perception, by memory, etc.),
in opposition to the limited skeptic who maintains that such knowledge is impossible. Establishment of the
possibility of knowledge-in-general is the central burden of part 1 of his Theory of Knowledge, and establishment
of the possibility of knowledge-in-special ("the problem of whether whole ranges of forms of knowledge are
possible, and if so, how," as he puts it [6]; see also chap. 10) is the major burden of part 2 of the book.
This retreat from a concern with Chisholm's first question explains the unconcern

Page 45
with Chisholm's second question. Neither Hamlyn nor Ayer nor any other analytic epistemologist has any interest
in determining the actual scope of human knowledge in Chisholm's sense, and so as a consequence attempts no
answer to Chisholm's question about the criteria of knowing, in the sense in which criteria are relevant to the
question of deciding, with respect to any particular p, whether we know p. Hamlyn says as much in so many
words; and Danto says that a theory of truth does not augment the stock of truths any more than a theory of
knowledge increases the stock of knowledge. What in analytic epistemology has replaced the concern with
Chisholm's and the classical epistemologist's two fundamental questions is the obsession with philosophical
skepticism of the general and limited kinds: "the theory of knowledge is primarily an exercise in scepticism; the
advancement and attempted rebuttal of arguments which are intended to prove that we do not know what we think
we know." 50 That is why in Hamlyn's "complete" epistemology his theory of knowledge is unsupplemented by
any measures that make it possible to answer Chisholm's and the classical epistemologist's questions about the
extent of our knowledge and about the criteria of knowing.
Of course, a theory of knowledge, as such, does not by itself enable us to determine the scope or extent of
knowledge or to decide, with respect to any particular p, whether we know p. But a logical theory of validity,
implication, equivalence, or inference is in exactly the same boat: definitions of logical validity, logical truth, and
all the rest have to be supplemented by all the paraphernalia already specified if any particular argument or
statement is to be determined to be logically valid or logically true. But given all that supplementary paraphernalia,
logic does make it possible to decide, with respect to any particular argument or statement, whether it is what we
think it is. Hamlyn's exemption of the particular knowledge-claims of scientists and other specialists from the
investigations of epistemologists has no counterpart in logic, which after all is a branch of epistemology. The
logician does not ask whether the particular arguments or statements he intends to assess were claimed to be
logically valid or logically true by scientists, historians, theologians, astrologists, and the like; he assesses them
anyway. He does not care whether the particular claims to logical knowledge are made by the man in the street or
the man in the moon: the origin of the claims is irrelevant. And contrary to what Danto says, a theory of logical
inference, when supplemented by all the paraphernalia specified, does augment, or at any rate is in principle
capable of augmenting, the stock of logical inferences known to be sound; and a theory of logical knowledge does
increase, or at any rate is in principle capable of increasing, the scope of our logical knowledge. The collection of
actual logical inferences identified by twentieth-century logicians as logically valida collection which has been
increasing since Aristotle's timeis vastly greater than the collection identified by Aristotle as logically valid. All
this is

< previous page

Page 46
common knowledge among logicians, and I assume I do not need to provide a list of logically sound inferences
known to contemporaries which were unknown to Aristotle, and which were in fact discovered with the help of
logical techniques (decision procedures and proof procedures) unknown to Aristotle.
After propounding his moral philosophy, Ayer explains what he has done in the following terms:
The theory is entirely on the level of analysis; it is an attempt to show what people are doing when they
make moral judgments; it is not a set of suggestions as to what moral judgments they are to make. And this
is true of all moral philosophy, as I understand it. All moral theories , in so far as they are philosophical
theories, are neutral as regards actual conduct. To speak technically, they belong to the field of meta-ethics,
not ethics proper. 51
What this implies is that a moral theory "neutral" in this sense is in principle incapable of answering Chisholm's
question "How are we to decide, in any particular case, whether or not a given act is right?"52 which is the
analogue for moral philosophy of his question "How are we to decide, in the case of any particular p, whether or
not we know that p?" Thus it is that a theory of knowledge and a theory of epistemology like that of Hamlyn, Ayer,
and Danto, which is "neutral" in the same sense, is in principle inapplicable to particular cases, and so is useless.
Like Russell's possibilist conception of philosophy, this is a possibilist conception of knowledge and of
epistemology: at best it can tell us that knowledge-in-general is possible and that ''whole ranges of forms of
knowledge are possible," but never what is in fact the case.

Epistemology, Philosophy, and the Nature of Man
3.1 A Classical Theory of Knowledge in the Context of a Classical Theory of Epistemology
3.1.1 SINCE 1957, RODERICK CHISHOLMWHOSE EPISTEMOLOGICAL INVESTIgations are for their depth,
breadth, and sustained development unequaled in the twentieth centuryhas attempted to provide what constitutes,
according to the classical conception of epistemology, "a complete epistemology." 1 Although he does not use that
term or any equivalent, and although he also does not say that he subscribes to the classical theory of epistemology
(which he never mentions), the slow but steady development of his epistemological views has in fact moved
toward the realization of that conception. This fact has been obscured by two other facts: first, Chisholm himself
has never claimed the development of a complete epistemology in the classical sense as an overriding desideratum;
and second, although every aspect of Chisholm's epistemology has for thirty years been the subject of intense
critical scrutinyfor example, his theory of knowledge, his theory of perceiving, his theory of sensing, his
foundationalism, and his analysis of numerous epistemic conceptsthe general character of his general epistemology
has been ignored or overlooked.2
No one, including Chisholm himself, it seems, has viewed his work as a whole. Nevertheless, his epistemology is a
complete epistemology (at least in principle, or potentially, not yet being completed) in the classical sense:
Chisholm subscribes to the general desideratum of the classical conception of epistemology; he provides a general
system of general normative principles of knowledge and reasonable belief; he advances justification of that
general system and those general principles; he carries out a full conceptual analysis embodied in a system of
definitions of epistemic terms; and he provides an account (although so far only summarily and schematically) of
the cognitive powers of man which are presupposed by the general normative principles of knowledge and
reasonable

Page 48
belief. Important (even if eventually judged to be unsound) as the specific elements of his general epistemology
may be, far more fundamental and significant, for my purposes, are these general features of his general
epistemology themselves: its completeness (which is not that of Hamlyn) in terms of the classical conception of
epistemology, which distinguishes his work from that of every other twentieth-century epistemologist known to
me.
3.1.2 In epistemology, Chisholm has developed a system of epistemic logic. 3 Like any system of formal logic
intended to be applicable to arguments and statements couched in ordinary or extraordinary language (e.g., Quine's
Methods of Logic), it has at least two parts or dimensions: the conceptual and the procedural. The conceptual
dimension he explains summarily in the following terms:
We have been trying to explicate some of the basic concepts of the theory of knowledge. It is obvious that,
if we are able to explicate any given concept, we can do so only by making use of certain other concepts.
Or, to put the matter in a somewhat different way, if we are able to define any given expression, we can do
so only by making use of other expressions that we do not define. We have been using the undefined
technical term, "p is more reasonable than q for S at t."4
Like the formal logician who unavoidably takes some truth-functional connective or connectives as basic and
undefined, and then defines others in terms of it, and so on, Chisholm takes the expression, "p is more reasonable
than q for S at T" as basic, and then defines "h is beyond reasonable doubt for S" in terms of it; then in succession,
in a chain of connected definitions, defines "h has some presumption in its favor for S''; "h is acceptable for S"; "h
is certain for S"; "h is evident for S"; and so on for a list of thirty-one definitions of epistemic concepts (Theory of
Knowledge, 13538; the volume's appendix lists these definitions in order).
But these definitions, like the corresponding definitions of logical concepts, are inapplicable and therefore unusable
without provision of a procedural apparatus. The procedural dimension he explains summarily in the following
terms:
The things that we ordinarily say we know are not things that are thus "directly evident." But in justifying
the claim to know any particular one of these things, we can be led back, in the manner described, to
various things that are directly evident. Should we say, therefore, that the whole of what we know, at any
given time, is a kind of "structure" having its "foundation" in what happens to be directly evident at that
time? If we do say this, then we should be prepared to say just how it is that the foundation serves to
support the rest of the structure. But this question is difficult to answer, for the support that the foundation
gives would seem to be neither deductive nor inductive. That is to say, it is not the kind of support that the
premises of a deductive argument give to their conclusion, nor is it the kind of support that the premises of
an inductive argument give to their conclusion. For if we take as our premises the whole of what is directly
evident at any time, and if we make use of
 
< previous page

< previous page
page_49
next page >
Page 49
no additional premises, then we cannot formulate a good deductive argument, and we cannot formulate a
good inductive argument, in which any of the things we ordinarily say we know appears as a conclusion. It
may be, therefore, that in addition to the "rules of deduction" and the "rules of induction," there are also
certain basic "rules of evidence." The deductive logician tries to formulate the first type of rule; the
inductive logician tries to formulate the second; and the epistemologist tries to formulate the third. (Theory
of Knowledge, 2 3)
Underlying these rules of evidence is a theory of evidence, which he summarily explains in the following terms:
In investigating the theory of evidence from a philosopicalor Socraticpoint of view, we make three general
presuppositions.
We presuppose, first, that there is something that we know. We presuppose, second, that the things we know
are justified for us. And we presuppose, third, that if we do thus have grounds or reasons for the things we
think we know, then there are valid general principles of evidenceprinciples stating the general conditions
under which we may be said to have grounds or reasons for what we believe. (Theory of Knowledge, 1617)
He gives illustrative examples of such abstract rules of evidence: "'What justifies me in believing that I know that a
is F is the fact that it is evident to me that b is G'" (Theory of Knowledge, 18). For a concrete instance of such an
abstract principle: "'What justifies me in thinking I know that he has that disorder is the fact that it is evident to me
that he has those symptoms'" (18). Presupposed by the answer just given, according to Chisholm, is an epistemic
principle, or a rule of evidence, of the form "'If it is evident to me that b is G, then it is evident to me that a is F'"
(19). Chisholm then formulates a series of Rules of Evidence, A to I:
(A)S's being F is such that, if it occurs, then it is self-presenting to S that he is F.
(B)For any subject S, if S believes, without ground for doubt, that he is perceiving something to be F,
then it is beyond reasonable doubt for S that he perceives something to be F.
(C)For any subject S, if S believes, without ground for doubt, that he is perceiving something to be F,
then it is evident for S that he perceives something to be F. (73,76,78)
Then come a number of principles of evidence concerning memory (8081), confirmation, and concurrence (82 83);
"and finally, from our concurrent set of propositionsnow reasonable as well as acceptablewe extract still another
class of propositions; countenanced as evident":

Page 50
(I)If S believes, without ground for doubt, that he perceives something to be F, and if the proposition
that there is something that is F is a member of a set of concurrent propositions each of which is
beyond reasonable doubt for S, then it is evident for S that he perceives something to be F.
How Chisholm arrives at all these definitions of epistemic concepts and formulations of these principles of
evidence is not here my concern. It may well be that some or even all of his definitions are unacceptable or
incorrect and that some or even all of his principles of evidence are unacceptable or inadequate; and that too is not
my concern here. What is my concern here is what he next says: "The set of concurrent propositions cited just
above [not included in the passages I have quoted] includes the perceptual proposition 'A cat is on the roof.' Hence,
in virtue of the principle I, and the definition of knowledge to be proposed in Chapter 6, we may be able to say, at
last, that S knows that there is a cat on the roof." (84). The definition of knowledge proposed in chapter 6 is as
follows:
D6.4 h is known by S = Df h is accepted by S; h is true; and h is nondefectively evident for S. (110)
Chisholm has thus provided what, it seems to be, is necessary if a "theory of knowledge," or an epistemology, is to
be both applicable and useful: a conceptual apparatus (the definitions of the epistemic concepts, etc.) and a
procedural apparatus (the principles of evidence). Chisholm provides definitions of beyond reasonable doubt
(D1.1), some presumption in its favor (D1.2), acceptable (D1.3), certain (D1.4), evident (D1.5), and so on, for
thirty-one definitions altogether. But the definition of knowledge, of h is known by S, taken by itself, is inapplicable
and therefore useless; taken in conjunction with any or all of the remaining thirty definitions of epistemic concepts,
it is no less inapplicable and therefore useless. The definition of knowledge and likewise of these other epistemic
concepts, becomes applicable and usable for the purpose of determining the rational justifiability of any given or
possible claim to knowledge only when it is combined, as in principle it is combined in Chisholm's system of
epistemic logic, with the principles of evidence. It is in these terms that Chisholm can answer the two fundamental
questions of classical epistemology which Hamlyn and all those whose epistemology is confined to the analysis of
epistemic terms and statements cannot answer: "What do we know? or, What is the extent of our knowledge? and
How are we to decide, in any particular case, whether we know? or, What are the criteria of knowing?"

3.2 A Classical Theory of Epistemology in the Context of a Classical Theory of Philosophy
3.2.1 After this lengthy examination of the new epistemology it is time to summarize it before setting forth my
concluding views. Having in Chapter 1 summarily explained the new epistemology in its more general analytic
context (sections 1.1 and 1.2), I then set forth its scope thesis (section 1.3) and its existence thesis (section 1.4) at
length. In Chapter 2, I examined first the existence thesis and the genetic thesis (section 2.1) at length, concluding
that both were false or unwarranted by the available evidence; then the historical thesis (section 2.2), concluding
that it too was false, or unwarranted by the available evidence; then the definitional thesis concerning knowledge
and the scope theses concerning both the scope of epistemology and the scope of knowledge (section 2.3),
concluding that the definitional thesis, being inapplicable, was useless, that the scope thesis concerning knowledge
was incapable of providing what it seemed to promise, and that the scope thesis concerning epistemology was
arbitrary and unjustifiable.
3.2.2 This leaves thesis (1), the definitional thesis concerning the nature of epistemology itself, which I have yet to
assess. That thesis (although none of its numerous proponents has said so) has in fact two foundations. The
narrower foundation consists of the compound thesis consisting of the existence thesis, the genetic thesis, and the
historical thesis. But if my critique of these three pillars of the definitional theory of epistemology is correct, that
foundation is nonexistent: all three theses are either false or are unwarranted by the available evidence. The
definitional theory thus rests on no foundation, being suspended, so to speak, in midair. But these are the only
specific positive grounds upon which the classical theory of epistemology can rationally be repudiated; there are no
others. The broader, more generic foundation is the analytic theory (or theories) of philosophy itself; if philosophy
itself is wholly analytic, then all its branches (ethics, metaphysics, and finally epistemology itself) are analytic, too.
The conception of the branches of philosophy is derived from the conception of philosophy, the generic foundation
of the whole enterprise as conceived in analytic philosophy. But that foundation itself is arbitrary, unwarranted by
any evidence or other considerations, and, more fundamentally, unsound; 5 so that foundation, too, is not a
foundation that is capable of supporting the conception of epistemology derived from it.
3.2.3 Every thesis of the new epistemology with which I have taken issue I have countered with a constructive or
positive thesis of my own. My own historical thesis is indicated in the course of my critique of the new
epistemology's historical thesis: there is evidence of epistemological inquiry and speculation

Page 52
almost from the very beginnings of Western philosophy and increasing evidence of increasing epistemological
inquiry and speculation as the end of the pre-Socratic period is approached. Much of that evidence I have cited
summarily, and all of it I can cite in detail if necessary. As for my existence thesis, it too has been indicated
summarily in the course of my critique: none of the ancient philosophers is a general skeptic; all
philosophersancient, medieval, modern, or contemporaryare limited skeptics. All philosophers in the history of
philosophy, Eastern or Western, deny the possibility of knowledge with respect to some area of putative
knowledge (because, e.g., there is nothing there to be known). For some Western philosophers, the area is
theological; for others, mathematical; for others, astrological; for others, philosophical; for others, ethical; for
others, metaphysical; for others, epistemological; for others, paranormal and extrasensory; for others, the past; and
so on. And that is just as it should be, being little more than a corollary of what it is to be a philosopher, endlessly
critical, questioning (not necessarily doubting), and probing; but not just so. On the contrary. But what I deny is
what everyone elsefor example, Ayerasserts: that there is a special class of philosophers who may be justifiably
classified as philosophical skeptics, all the rest being not so classifiable.
3.2.4 My "genetic" thesis has not been indicated heretofore; but because it seems to me that the terminology used
by some ("arises against and by contrast with" [Hamlyn], "generate" [Pollock], "prompts" [Quine]) is misleading
and even inaccurate, involving assumptions which themselves are false or unwarranted, I begin by reformulating
the question: What, if any, are the conditions under which epistemological inquiry and speculation arise? I suggest
that it is to be explained in two different ways by reference to two different sorts of conditions: conditions external
and conditions internal. The firstthe external conditionsis the existence of fundamental philosophical disagreements
about matters of ultimate and general human concern: fundamental disagreements about questions moral (e.g., the
existence and nature of the good, the right, and the obligatory), metaphysical (e.g., the nature and kinds of reality),
religious (e.g., the existence and nature of God)fundamental disagreements of all such kinds that in addition have
shown themselves to be unresolvable by any rational means of a nonepistemological kind available to all those who
find themselves entangled in such fundamental disagreements. An example of a fundamental metaphysical
disagreement of this kind, to this day unresolved, is that between metaphysical monism (Parmenides) and
metaphysical pluralism (Heraclitus); of a fundamental religious disagreement, to this day unresolved, that between
theism and atheism; of a fundamental ethical disagreement, to this day unresolved, that between absolutism and
relativism, or that between cognitivism and noncognitivism; and so on without end.
In such contexts, I suggest that the epistemological enterprisereflection upon the questions whether we know, what
we know, how we know, and so onarises

when all other means of resolving these fundamental disagreements are found to fail. In such circumstances the
question will inevitably arise why it is that men of good will and intellectual integrity are unable to resolve those
fundamental disagreements despite seeming to be fully aware of the considerations underlying the disagreements. 6
Like two astronomers with their telescopes trained on the same region whose reports of the existence and character
of the things to be found in that region are in fundamental conflict, each astronomer will inevitably wonder, to
begin with, what is wrong with the telescope of his colleague, or even with his colleague, and then, more
fundamentally, what is wrong with his own telescope, or with himself. (It is a notable and significant fact that there
is no evidence of wonderment of the latter kind among the major analytic philosophers.) Questions of such kinds,
when the disagreements are of the fundamental kind indicated, are epistemological questions; and the attempt to
answer such questions, both critically and contructively, issues in epistemology. In that context, epistemological
inquiry functions as the court of last appeal (and if not epistemology, then what?): the last possible means of
resolving otherwise unresolvable fundamental disagreements. Thus arises that branch of philosophy known as
epistemology: as a consequence of fundamental disagreement, a two-sided affair, it is to be noted; not as a
consequence of general skepticism, which is a one-sided affair. The whole history of global philosophy, Western
and Eastern, bears out this interpretation, I believe, of one of the major conditions under which the general
enterprise of philosophy arises. Two examples, one drawn from modern Western epistemology and one drawn
from ancient Western metaphysics, will have to suffice by way of evidence.
In An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke writes that "my purpose [is], to enquire into the
original, certainty, and extent of human Knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of Belief, Opinion, and
Assent";7 and in "The Epistle to the Reader" with which he prefaces that work he writes:
Were it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should tell thee that five or six friends meeting at
my chamber, and discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly at a stand by
the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had a while puzzled ourselves without coming any nearer a
resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts, that we took a wrong course; and
that, before we set ourselves upon enquiries of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities,
and see what objects our understandings were or were not fitted to deal with.
In a footnote to this passage, Pringle-Pattison explains, "According to a manuscript note in a copy of the Essay
which belonged to James Tyrrell, one of the friends present at the meeting, the difficulties arose in discussing 'the
principles of morality and revealed religion.'"8 In other words, there was discussion of

< previous page

Page 54
fundamental questions of morality and religion; there were fundamental disagreements among the discussants; the
disagreements were unresolvable by whatever means the discussants had recourse to; and Locke as a consequence
turned to an inquiry which is identifiable as a general epistemological inquiry. That Locke's epistemological
inquiry did not arise against or even in response to general philosophical skepticism is clear enough from his
whole Essay and otherwise from his whole philosophical outlook, but it is especially clear in the following
passage, in which he expresses his scorn of such skepticism:
But yet, if after all this anyone will be so skeptical as to distrust his senses, and to affirm that all we see and
hear, feel and taste, think and do, during our whole being, is but the series and deluding appearances of a
long dream whereof there is no reality; and therefore will question the existence of all things or our
knowledge of anything: I must desire him to consider, that if all be a dream, then he doth but dream that he
makes the question; and so it is not much matter that a waking man should answer him. 9
According to Aristotle, metaphysics too, in the sense of first philosophy, arose in response to fundamental
disagreements about the first principles of philosophy. In his Metaphysics, he writes: "It is necessary, with a view
to the science which we are seeking [protê philosophia, 'first philosophy'], first to recount the difficulties which
should first be discussed. These concern all the divergent views which are held about first principles."10 Among
the disagreements he cites are those between the "Physical" philosophers of early Greek philosophy and the
Pythagoreans and Platonists. In short, "first philosophy" was born out of fundamental philosophical disagreement
about first principles of philosophy and Aristotle's subsequent attempt to resolve those disagreements. The
similarity to the first passage from Locke is striking, and generally overlooked.
All the same, there is, it seems to me, a still deeper source for "reflection upon the nature of knowledge"
(Chisholm), and it has nothing to do with external conditions, either the external conditions which the new
epistemologists (Russell, Ayer, Hamlyn, Pollock, Quine, Schlick, et al.) cite, or those which Aristotle and Locke
cite. That deeper source, I believe, is simply the nature of man: the natural tendency of the human mind to wonder
about, to inquire into, and to reflect upon the nature, scope, and means of knowledge; to wonder about, to inquire
into, and to reflect upon the questions whether it knows, how it knows, how much it knows, how much it can in
principle know, and what it is to know at all.11 "Man," Sextus Empiricus said, "is by nature a truth-loving animal"
(L.i.27); "All men," Aristotle said, ''desire by nature to know":12 and all men, I would add, desire by nature to
know whether they know, how they know, how much they know, how much they can know, and what it is to
know.13 The instinct for knowing is inherent in all men; for knowing in the special way of doing science equally
so;

Page 55
for knowing in the way of doing epistemology equally so; and more generally for knowing in the way of doing
philosophy. The tendency of the human mind to engage in epistemological reflection and inquiry is as natural as
the tendency of the human mind to engage in philosophical reflection and inquiry in general, and as natural as
looking, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, laughing, and thinking in general. 14 There is no need to look for
external sources or conditions of the general philosophical enterprise or of the special epistemological one, and no
justification for it, any more than there is any need to look for external sources or conditions of the general human
activities of looking, eating, drinking, sleeping, and thinking. To seek the source or condition of epistemological
reflection and inquiry, as of philosophical reflection and inquiry generally, in the accidental historical occurrence
of general skepticismeven if, contrary to fact, it had occurredseems to me to have a grave tendency to impoverish
and trivialize such reflection and inquiry. To seek its source rather in the attempt to resolve otherwise unresolvable
fundamental disagreements of ultimate and universal human (not just academic philosophical) concern, or even
more deeply as the natural impulse of the human mind, seems to me to restore to philosophy its fundamental
human significance and importance: a significance and importance philosophy has had for 2,500 years, until the
advent of analytic philosophy.15

Notes
1. The Problem: A General Introduction
1. The terms "epistemology" and "theory of knowledge" are widely used in the literature as synonyms. In this work
they are used differently: "epistemology'' for the whole field of philosophical inquiry into the nature, types, means,
and scope of knowledge; "theory of knowledge" strictly for what it saystheory of (the nature of) knowledge, on a
par with theory of (the nature of) truth, belief, and so forth. See section 3.2 for a fuller account of the nature of
epistemology.
2. Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy (1912; reprint, London: Oxford University Press, 1959), 14951.
3. Bertrand Russell, An Outline of Philosophy (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1927), 1. For similar explanations
indistinguishably of epistemology and philosophy, see his Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for
Scientific Method in Philosophy (Chicago and London: Open Court, 1915), 6367, and An Inquiry into Meaning and
Truth (New York: Norton, 1940), 40, where he uses "theory of knowledge" and "epistemology" to designate what
in the earlier works he used "philosophy" to designate.
In "Russell on the Foundations of Knowledge," in The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, ed. P. A. Schilpp
(Evanston and Chicago: Northwestern University Press, 1944), 423, R. M. Chisholm had already pointed out
that Russell defines philosophy and epistemology indistinguishably in terms of methodological skepticism. At
that time the conception had not been as widely adopted as it has since, and so it did not then have the
significance for philosophy which it has acquired in the following decades. But it must also be said that at that
time I failed to realize the significance of Chisholm's observation.
4. A. J. Ayer, The Problem of Knowledge (London: Macmillan, 1956), viii. The same conception is to be found in
Ayer's The Concept of a Person and Other Essays (London: Macmillan, 1963), 31, and The Central Questions of
Philosophy (New York: Morrow, 1975), 1, 63; it is suggested more amorphously in almost all the rest of his works.
5. D. W. Hamlyn, "Epistemology, History of," in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Paul Edwards (New York:
Macmillan and Free Press, 1967), 3:89. Hereafter cited in text as "Epistemology."
6. D. W. Hamlyn, The Theory of Knowledge (Garden City: Doubleday, Anchor, 1970; London: Macmillan, 1971),
78.
7. This mingled historico-genetic thesis has its counterpart in ethics: "If physical philosophy begins in wonder,
ethics may be said to have begun in scepticism"; Alexander Grant, The Ethics of Aristotle, 4th ed., 2 vols.
(London, 1885). The thesis is no truer in ethics than it is in epistemology. For the thesis in epistemology, see
sections 2.1 (the genetic thesis) and 2.2 (the historical thesis). The human concern about morality and moral
philosophy has no essential connections with moral skepticism.
In the most comprehensive and thorough critique of ethical skepticism known to me, Panayot Butcharov still
finds it possible to explain ethics itself in constructive and skeptical terms; see his Skepticism in Ethics
(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989), 2930, 16465.
8. W. V. Quine, "The Nature of Natural Knowledge," in Mind and Language, ed. Samuel Guttenplan (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1975), 6768. I owe thanks to Roger F. Gibson, Jr., for supplying me with this passage.
9. John L. Pollock, Knowledge and Justification (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974), 5. In his most
recent major work in epistemology, Pollock still maintains many of the positions he advanced in his earlier
workfor instance, that there are general philosophical skeptics and that these skeptics are insusceptible to rational
considerations and so are best ignored; Contemporary Theories of Knowledge (Totowa: Rowman and Littlefield,
1986), 37.

respectively; Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945), 73.
Neither Ayer nor Hamlyn nor Quine nor Pollock nor any of the others acknowledges Russell as the source of his
conception of epistemology, apparently viewing it as a self-evident conception to which any epistemologist would
subscribe.

13. The significance of all this documentation emerges in section 1.4.
14. According to A. J. Ayer, himself one of the adherents of the new conception of philosophy, these conceptions
are not new. The majority of the great figures in the history of philosophy were, according to him, analytic
philosohers in his sense; Language, Truth and Logic, 2d ed. (London: Victor Gollancz, 1949, 5156, esp. 52. That
half a century later he still subscribes to this historical thesis is clear from his Philosophy in the Twentieth Century
(New York: Random, Vintage, 1982), chap. 1, esp. 1315.
For a very recent distortion of philosophy and its history, see A. C. Danto, "Philosophy and Its History," chap.
1 of Connections to the World (1989; New York: Harper & Row, Perennial Library, 1990), esp. 5.
15. Strictly speaking, neither Russell nor Moore was ever an adherent of the analytic conception of philosophy;
both repeatedly repudiated it. But they are still widely so viewed, e.g., by Ayer, in Logical Positivism, and in
Philosophy in the Twentieth Century, ix, where he writes of "what is loosely called the analytic movement,
covering philosophers as diverse as Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolf Carnap and other
members of the Vienna Circle." That is like speaking of what is loosly called the school of logical positivism,
covering philosophers as diverse as Parmenides, Pythagoras, Saint Augustine, and A. J. Ayer. It obliterates
genuine, fundamental, and important cleavages to use classificatory schemes in that way. See note 23 to the
present chapter and note 6 to chapter 2.

23. A good many contemporary philosophers, unwilling, for reasons never explained, to abandon the designation
"analytic philosophy" after they have clearly abandoned its defining metaphilosophical theses, have taken to
designating philosophy in the classical world tradition too as "analytical philosophy." Thus David M. Armstrong
writes: "Since that time [the time of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein, and Ryle], philosophers in the 'analytic
tradition' have swung back from Wittgensteinian and Rylean pessimism to a more traditional conception of the
proper role and tasks of philosophy.

Many analytic philosophers now would accept the view that the central task of philosophy is to give an
account, or at least play a part in giving an account, of the general nature of things and man. (I would include
myself among that many.)" The Nature of Mind and Other Essays (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981), 17.
That is not my usage in the present essay. My usageunderlying which is a general principle of terminologyis
that when the essential metaphilosophical doctrines of the analytic conception of philosophy have been
abandoned in favor of the essential metaphilosophical doctrines of the classical world tradition, the designation
too ought to be abandoned. That in reverse is in fact what the major early analytic philosophersCarnap, Schlick,
Ayer, and othersdid when they jettisoned the metaphilosophical doctrines of the classical world tradition
without being evasive about it, and rightly so.
For more recent examples of such misleading uses of "analytical philosophy," see Bernard Williams, Ethics and
the Limits of Philosophy (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), viiviii; D. W. Hamlyn, A History of
Western Philosophy (New York: Viking Penguin, 1987; London: Penguin, 1988), chap. 17; and Thomas Nagel,
Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), ix. Hao Wang's search for a clear and true
conception of analytic philosophy is instructive but inconclusive. See his Beyond Analytic Philosophy: Doing
Justice to What We Know (Cambridge: MIT Press, A Bradford Book, 1986), xxi, 24 n. 23, 32, 100.

Enlarging upon these themes, F. Waismann writes: "Previous philosophers have almost always directed their
attention to the answers given in reply to philosophical questions. The great mistake of philosophers up to now,
which has led to so many misunderstandings, is that they have produced answers before seeing clearly the

nature of the questions they have been asking. They seem to have been quite unaware of the possibility that the
form of the question itself might conceal an error" (Principles, 34). If that was a mistake of philosophers up to
now, it was not a mistake made by Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha; for, according to the Pali Canon, the
Buddha was known by his

contemporaries in the India of the sixth century B.C. as a vibhajja-vãdian analytic teacherand he divided all
philosophical questions into four classes: questions to be answered categorically, definitely, or directly (pañho
ekamsavyakaraniyo *); questions to be "answered" with a counterquestion (pañho patipuccha-vyakaraniyo);
questions to be set aside, or rejected, as wrongly formulated (pañhothapaniyo*); and finally questions to be
"answered" with a prior analysis of the question before being answered directly and categorically (pañho vi
bhajja-vyakaraniyo). In the Canon, this classification of philosophical questions is to be found in Anguttara*

Thomas Reid, Hume's contemporary and a severe critic of what he took to be the skepticisms of Hume and
Berkeley, never, to the best of my knowledge, formulated a general conception of skepticism; but he did think
the skepticisms of Hume and Berkeley were traceable to "Pyrrho the Elean, the father of this philosophy"in
Reid's own words, "giving no credit to the senses"; The Works of Thomas Reid, ed. Sir William Hamilton, 4th
ed. (London: Longmans, Green, 1854), 167. But the only source he cites for this judgment is "Antigonus the
Carystian, quoted by Diogenes Laertius." There is no evidence that he based his judgment on the Pyrrho-text, or
even knew of its existence; and there is no evidence of the Pyrrho-text in Diogenes Laertius.

In the most massive philosophical and scholarly study of the pre-Socratic philosophers ever written (to the best
of my knowledge), Jonathan Barnes writes, "The sceptical philosophers of Hellenistic Greece held that no one
at all could know anything at all; and with commendable consistency they proceeded to deny that they
themselves knew that distressing fact"; The Presocratic Philosophers, rev. ed. (London: Routledge & Kegan

It has been brought to my attention by Richard Watson and Charles Young that in a recent work, Essays in
Ancient Philosophy (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), Michael Frede has defended a view
about Pyrrhonian skepticism which is similar to mine, and they ask me to sort out the points of similarity and
differenceI shall henceforth speak in addition of agreements and disagreementsbetween our two treatments.
Frede's relevant essays are "The Skeptic's Beliefs" (which appeared first in German in 1979 and in English
translation in Essays) and "The Skeptic's Two Kinds of Assent and the Possibility of Knowledge" (in English,
1984). My attention has been directed especially to the following passage:
According to [the usual interpretation of Pyrrhonian skepticism], the skeptic not only claims to have no
deeper insight into things, he also claims not to know anything at all. The skeptic refuses to assent to any
proposition.
Any interpretation along these lines, however, seems fundamentally mistaken to me. No matter how
ingenious he may be, the skeptic cannot avoid knowing many things. (Essays, 179)
There are indeed many points of similarity and difference, of agreement and disagreement, between our two
treatmentsso many that I cannot possibly deal with them adequately or even fairly in this note. I shall, however,
indicate some of the similarities and differences and some of the agreements and disagreements as summarily
as possible.
We agree that, according to Sextus Empiricus, "the skeptic, in many instances, does think of himself as
knowing something" (Essays, 180). I indicate that there are thousands of such instances.
We agree that such claims to knowledge are "perfectly compatible with his skepticism" (Essays, 180).
We agree that on what Frede calls "the usual interpretation of Pyrrhonian skepticism" (although he does not
identify those interpreters), "the skeptical position turns out to be inconsistent" (Essays, 180).
We agree that the (Pyrrhonian) skeptic can have and does have beliefs (Essays, 180, 189, 192).
We agree on the dubious value of Timon's testimony concerning Pyrrho's views (Essays, 18283).
We cite a substantial number of the same skeptical textsespecially those of Sextus Empiricusin support of the
same interpretations of skepticism.
The list of similarities and agreements could go on; but the list of differences and disagreements is, it seems to
me, even greater and more striking. Among those numerous differences and disagreements are the following:
He holds that there are no views or beliefs that define Pyrrhonian skepticism (Essays, 179). I think there are and
have indicated what some of them are, doing little more in fact than report the explicit statements and
definitions of Sextus Empiricus himself.
He holds that there are no specific doctrines or dogmas which a Skeptic, rather than a member of one of the

Dogmatic schools, would have. That judgment, it seems to me, is true for dogmas (as defined by Sextus) but
false for doctrines, many of which I have specified.
He holds that Pyrrhonian skepticism is not "characterized by specifically skeptical views that rely
 
< previous page

< previous page

Page 65
on 'deeper' insights into the true nature of things" (Essays, 179), while I hold that one of the specifically
"skeptical" views (in Sextus's sense) does rely on a deeper insight into the true nature of things when those
things are philosophical theories, for one kind of example. According to Sextus, the Dogmatists and the
Academics are both mistaken, the Dogmatists thinking that they have discovered philosophical truth, and the
Academics thinking that philosophical truth is undiscoverable.
He holds that "even the phrase, 'nothing is to be known,' is not accepted by the skeptical philosopher as
expressing a skeptical doctrine (Sext. Emp. P.H. I 200)" (Essays, 129); I argue (in section 2.1.2.2) that it is, at
least by Sextus Empiricus himself, once he has reformulated it. And then too, at this point, "the peculiar feature
of classical Greek" comes into play. I would just add, without comment, that the Greek for which Frede gives
"nothing is to be known" is panta estin akatal pta, which does not seem to me to be correctly translatable as
"all is unknown" or "all is unknowable.'' Philosophically, the point is important; and the word katal ptos is
another of those verbal adjectives from which those alpha-privatives are derived, in this case akatal pta.
The differences between our treatments are also numerous and striking.
Perhaps the biggest and most significant difference is in our respective overall outlooks. In the two essays
cited, his approach seems to be mainly that of a classical scholar trying to determine the truth about "the
skeptic," mainly "the Pyrrhonian skeptic." Mine is mainly philosophical: I am trying essentially to determine
the truth about the nature of epistemology and the nature of philosophy in opposition to the most influential
school of philosophy in the twentieth century, that of analytic philosophy. My concern with philosophical
skepticism, whether general or restricted, is mainly rooted in the alleged connections (definitional,
chronological or historical, and genetic, etc.) between general skepticism, epistemology, and philosophy
(including its two additional branchesmetaphysics and moral philosophy). I do not think that any branch of
philosophy is essentially prompted by general philosophical skepticism; and I think that philosophy in the
twentieth century has gone badly astray in its preoccupation with general skepticism.
Another is that my central focus in the present work is on the concept of knowledge; my references to belief,
assent, speech or assertion, judgment, argument, proposition and doubt, and so forth are secondary. His focus
seems to be just the reverse: in the two essays cited, the skeptic's claim to knowledge is set aside; it is the
possibility of skeptical belief that forms his main concern in the first essay (Essays, 180), and skeptical assent
that forms the main concern of his second.
A third is that in those essays at least, his focus is upon Sextus Empiricus; Pyrrho is mentioned in passing and
then put aside. My focus in section 2.1 is equally upon both, devoting a great deal of critical attention to the
Pyrrho-text, which he neither deals with nor mentions.
A fourth is that in addition to Sextus and Pyrrho I deal with the remaining Greek Skeptics, the major Greek
Sophists, and "the odds and ends"for example, Metrodorus of Chios; he does not.
A fifth is that in the course of dealing with Sextus and Pyrrho I elicit four principles of interpretation with the
help of which I deal with all those other ancient skeptics.
A sixth is my focus on what I call "a strange feature of classical Greek," which looms large in my argument; in
his essays there is no mention of that featurepossibly because he does not think it is a feature of classical Greek,
or that even if it is a feature it is unimportant. I have noted in my text that I have been unable to find any
discussion or even any reference in the scholarly classical literature to this peculiar feature.
6. It is curious that G. E. Moore's general account of what philosophy isan account which he never repudiated,
evidence that he was never one of those who subscribe to an analytic conception of philosophyis traceable to
Sextus Empiricus, whose account is traceable to the early Stoics; G. E. Moore, Some Main Problems of Philosophy
(London: Allen & Unwin; New York: Macmillan, 1953), chap. 1.
7. Cf. Chisholm's judgment that "epistemologists presuppose that they can succeed. This means, therefore, that they
have a kind of faith in themselves"; Theory of Knowledge, 3d ed., 5.

8. All this, and the rest of section 2.1, makes clear the extreme inadequacy of Quine's conception of skepticism,
and consequently the inadequacy of his critical response to skepticism.
9. In The Modes of Skepticism Annas and Barnes write: "There are passages in Sextus' work in which he poses as a
defender of Common Sense and an opponent only of scientific and philosophical dogmatism By and large the Ten
Modes are designed to produce a radical skepticism" (124). My view is that he was not posing and that the Ten
Tropes are not designed to produce a "radical"

Page 66
(i.e., utterly general) skepticism. The evidence Annas and Barnes cite in support of their interpretation is highly
incomplete; see note 13.
10. E.g., Rescher, Scepticism, chap. 1, esp. 1011. The passage from Montaigne's Apology for Raymond Sebond
which Rescher quotes at that point shows how Montaigne misinterpreted the Greek Skeptics, and how as a
consequence Hume was misled in turn, depending as he did upon secondary sources and worse. See note 44 to
chapter 1.
Of all the world's epistemologists known to me, the one who has most strenuously grappled with "the problem
of the criterion" is R. M. Chisholm; see, e.g., his Theory of Knowledge, 2d ed. (Englewood Cliffs,
N.J.:Prentice-Hall, 1977), chap. 7; The Foundations of Knowing, chap. 5; Theory of Knowledge, 3d ed., (1989),
67, 36.
11. In The Modes of Skepticism, 22, 124, Annas and Barnes argue that Sextus Empiricus is a general skeptic; but
their translations and discussions of his account of the Ten Tropes are very incomplete, omitting much of the most
important evidential data that I cite. Long and Sedley do the same; cf. The Hellenistic Philosophers 1:473.
12. In Modes (17, 16668), Annas and Barnes do just that; but so does Montaigne (Complete Essays, 372), although
nothing could be clearer than Sextus' explanation of the double dimension of the Skeptic's End.
13. Where the content of Skeptic doctrine is concerned, Bury's lengthy introduction to the Loeb edition consists
wholly of interpretations, apparently assuming them to be so evident that substantiating evidence does not need to
be cited (although interpretations in his numerous footnotes to his translation are tied to particular passages and
terms). Annas and Barnes (Modes) cite evidence drawn mainly from the first group; Stough (Greek Skepticism), in
her chapter on Sextus, cites evidence drawn mainly from the third; and Hamlyn cites no evidence. I know of no
student of Greek Skepticism who takes account of all the evidence marshaled in these pages, or even much of it.
14. E.g., Annas and Barnes, Modes, 2, 8, 9, 25.
15. E.g., by Stough, Greek Skepticism, 2628; by Annas and Barnes, Modes, 11, 25; by Rescher, Scepticism, 15, 5;
and by Montaigne, Complete Essays, 37374.
16. These possible variations in the translation of the Greek will be discussed in section 2.1.3, especially in the
section on Pyrrho, and their significance assessed.
17. Stough, Greek Skepticism, 141, 146. In Hegel's Introduction to the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, trans.
T. M. Knox and A. V. Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985; Clarendon Press, 1987), 181, Hegel writes:
"Among the Greeks, we have to consider the philosophy of sophists and skeptics. They have propounded the
doctrine that the truth cannot be known" (emphasis added).
My references here and in note 5 to Hegel have prompted one of the editors, Richard A. Watson, to suggest
that I add something about Michael N. Forster's Hegel and Skepticism (Cambridge:Harvard University Press,
1989), which has just been published and so has been unavilable to me for present purposes (except in a
photocopy of its introduction, first two chapters, and associated notes, provided by Watson). In these comments
I shall on the whole confine myself to those views of Hegel (and Forster) which bear on what I have previously
said, leaving consideration of the much larger questions raised by Forster's valuable and welcome study to
another venue.
In note 5 I say, in the context of the eleven theses which I advance about Sextus Empiricus, that "Hegel is an
eighteenth/nineteenth-century student [of philosophical skepticism] who denies some" of those eleven theses.
Among his theses which I deny (since his statement of his views antedates mine by two centuries) are the
following:
1.that Sextusand more generally "radical ancient skepticism, and particularly Pyrrhonism as preserved
in the writings of Sextus Empiricus" (Hegel, 9)is a general skeptic;
2.that the suspense-of-judgment (epoche *) for which Sextus and the Pyrrhonists argue is general or

universal (Hegel, 9);
3.that "the older (i.e., Pyrrhonian) skepticism proves the untruth of all" (Hegel, 36); and
4.that the principle and method of equipollence (isostheneia: equal logical force) is absolutely general
in scope (Hegel, 10).
Against Hegel's thesis 1 the whole of section 2.2.2 is a sustained argument. Against his thesis 2 is my seventh
thesis, for which I argue on pages 1618. Against his thesis 3 are my antitheses stated

Page 67
in the form of the third, the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth theses (p. 13), some of the arguments for which are
presented on pages 1416, then headon in page 21, and earlier by way of preparatory considerations on pages
1921 (the elliptical character of many of Sextus' crucial "skeptical" formulations). Against Hegel's thesis 4 I
argue on page 19. Neither in Hegel (according to Forster) nor in Forster (when he is stating his own views) is
there any reference to Sextus' explanations of the elliptical character of many of his skeptical formulations, and
the limited scope of those formulations when the ellipticity is eliminated.
Sometimes when Forster takes issue with one of Hegel's interpretations, he seems to me to advance
misinterpretations of his own. Thus with respect to thesis 3, above, Forster says that "the ancient skeptics did
not aim to prove anything and did not attempt to show in any way that claims were untrue" (Hegel, 36). But in
fact theyat any rate Sextusdid: e.g., at L.ii. 1718 (one of numerous similar passages in his work), where in the
space of two sentences (about truth itself) he says "as we shall prove," "as we shall demonstrate," and ''as we
shall establish." Whether in saying these things Sextus was contradicting his general philosophical outlook is
another question, irrelevant to the question whether he ever aimed to prove anything.
Throughout the present work I have protested against the use of expressions like "the ancient skeptics" in the
context of assertions like many of those of Hegel and Forster. Following Burnyeat, I have pointed out that
much of the writing on skepticism by Hume, Montaigne, Wittgenstein, Ayer, Quine, Ryle, "and numerous
others" is conducted in a kind of philosophical vacuum into which Quine himself falls after having himself
protested against it ("Strawson v. Strawman"). Given, for example, that all that survives of the writings of
Metrodorus of Chiosone of those "ancient skeptics"is a single sentence (p. 28; see pp. 356 for a typical
interpretation of it by Jonathan Barnes), we are in no position to say what he aimed to prove or whether or not
he aimed to prove anything at all. As for Pyrrhoanother of "the ancient skeptics"what we have in terms of the
Pyrrho-text certainly provides reason to believe that he was trying to prove something: sentence 3 in that text is
advanced as a reason for believing sentence 4; and the unnumbered sentence following 4 starts with
"therefore." As for Sextus, he argues at great length that all the centuries-old disagreements and controversies
about matters philosophical, scientific, and artistic (philosophia, episteme *, kai techne*) are, if not absolutely
unresolvable, at any rate unresolved, and that suspense-of-judgment with respect to all of them is for the time
being and under the circumstances the wisest course to take and the only course leading to ataraxia and
eudaimonia. On page 17 I cite numerous logical and other principles and techniques to which he appeals, and
the passages in which he appeals to them, all of which look to me like "attempts to prove something."
Earlier in this note I quoted Hegel's judgment that the Greek Sophists and Skeptics "have propounded the
doctrine that the truth cannot be known." This judgment is weaker than his judgment, earlier quoted, that "the
older skepticism proves the untruth of all."
First concerning the Greek Skeptics: Sextus I have already dealt with in this note. As for Pyrrho and
Pyrrhonism, I argue at length in section 2.2.3 not that there is (as I think there is in the case of Sextus)
conclusive or all but conclusive reason to believe that he is not a general skeptic, but that there is "woefully
insufficient reason" to believe that he is. The argument in his case is rather intricate and involves (1)
translations and interpretations of a number of crucial terms in the Pyrrho-text; (2) "a more fundamental
question," the absence of certain epistemic terms from the Pyrrho-text which one would expect to find if Pyrrho
were opting for general skepticism; (3) the "still more fundamental question," that is, that general skepticism in
any philosophically significant sense must be formulated in modal, not nonmodal, terms; (4) the even more
fundamental fact which I characterize as "the strange feature of classical Greek" concerning its use of verbal
adjectives, especially the negative ones called alpha-privatives; (5) the significance of that feature when
combined with the extraordinary brevity of the Pyrrho-text; and finally (6), the four principles of interpretation,
which, I argue, must be satisfied "if an isolated philosophical text (e.g., that of Metrodorus of Chios or of
Pyrrho-Timon) is to be adequately interpreted and even translated," and which, I argue, is not satisfied by the
Pyrrho-Timon text. Neither Hegel (according to Forster) nor Forster (in his own voice) takes account of any of
these six considerations in his critical examination and interpretation of "the ancient skeptics." But, to the best
of my knowledge, neither does any other student of ancient philosophical skepticism. I would on that account
tend to think that something must be wrong with my account; but given these considerations, I see no way to
avoid my conclusion. Perhaps Forster can.

As for the remaining Greek Skeptics, although I have made as exhaustive a study of all of them (Timon of
Phlius, Arcesilaus of Pitane, Carneades of Cyrene, Aenesidemus, Agrippa, and others) as I have of Sextus, with
the same result (that there is insufficient reason to interpret them as general skeptics), nevertheless when I hit
upon the four principles of interpretation and saw (or thought I saw) that the latter could be used to circumvent
all the scholarship, the amassing of the evidence, and the tripling of the size of the study, that is what I did; I
then extended the maneuver to take in the Greek Sophists (for whom I have done what I have done for all the
Greek Skeptics). The reader (especially the skeptical reader) is then free to do either of two things: carry out the
application on his own, concluding either that I am right about my prediction or that I am wrong; or insist that I
carry it out on my own in public. A third alternative is to judge the project wrongheaded to begin with and so
not worth carrying out.
Very much to my surprise, given that I received my philosophical education or miseducation in schools heavily
influenced or dominated by analytic philosophy (whose classical literature portrays Hegel in the most repulsive
terms), I find myself agreeing with or sympathetic to much of Hegel's outlook on philosophical skepticismfor
example, his judgment that ancient skepticism is philosophically superior to (what in his day counted as)
modern skepticism (Hegel, chap. 1). The presentation of philosophical skepticism in Sextus Empiricus seems to
me incomparably superior to anything to be found in modern philosophy in point of scope, depth, system, and
exhaustiveness. Neither Wittgenstein nor Quineto single out two twentieth-century writers most highly regarded
by the generality of their colleagueshas even begun to come to grips with that system. I have already mentioned
Chisholm as one of the rare contemporary philosophers who has.
Despite my criticism of Hegel (and in passing of Forster), I should like to conclude by saying that I am thankful
to Forster for bringing this widely overlooked dimension of Hegel's general philosophy to the philosophical
community's attention (and I am therefore thankful to Watson for bringing Forster's study to my attention). As
Forster writes, "Hegel's reflections on the nature of the skeptical tradition have considerable intrinsic merit,
containing original insights from which contemporary historians of philosophy and philosophers concerned
with skepticism can profit" (Hegel, 1). In the familiar works on HegelStace, Mure, and Findlaythere is no hint
of any of this; nor is there any hint of it in D. W. Hamlyn's "History of Epistemology" or in Richard Popkin's
historical survey, "Skepticism" (Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edwards, 7:44961), covering the period from the
fifth century B.C. to the twentieth century A.D., or in his The High Road to Pyrrhonism (''selected studies in
eighteenth-century philosophy, with one excursion into the nineteenth").
Hamlyn, A History of Western Philosophy, 35, 83, 8587, repeats Hegel's judgment of the skeptics, and so the
error survives century after century.

Western Philosophy, 23335, is appallingly inaccurate; he appears not to have read even the secondary or tertiary
sources with any care.
All these works are Western; but a recent Eastern or non-Western account of philosophical skepticism
advances many of the interpretations of Pyrrho and the later Pyrrhonists with which I take issue; see A. S.
Bogomolov, History of Ancient Philosophy: Greece and Rome (Moscow: Progress, 1985), 30518.
19. The handful of facts just summarized are known to all the specialists in Greek Skepticism, but nowhere in the
works of any of those specialists are those facts collected in one place and set out clearly so as to make clear their
collective significance, which is important.
20. In every work in the Library of Living Philosophers in which the philosopher subjected to critical scrutiny
responds, the philosopher laments the misunderstandings of his writings.

23. Burnet, "Sceptics," 229.
24. Stough, Greek Skepticism, 17; hereafter cited in text.
25. Long, Hellenistic Philosophy, 8081.
26. Sedley, "The Motivation of Greek Skepticism," 24, 14.
27. Annas and Barnes, Modes, 11.
28. On this point, see Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy, the introduction (130, but esp. 1011) and the appendix ("On
the meaning of jsis"), 36364; and Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy 1:55, 73, 82, 83, esp. 82, 83.
29. Sedley's predicate"undifferentiated"seems no less unwarranted than his subject, "The world." Among the five
senses of adiaphora listed in the unabridged Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott, the nearest to Sedley's
"undifferentiated" is ''having no logical differentia," which is presumably the sourceSedley himself does not
explainof Sedley's "undifferentiated." But the Lexicon itself seems to be in error: the textAristotle's Metaphysics
1016a18it cites in justification of its listing of "having no logical differentia" in fact says nothing to warrant the
listing. That sense, therefore, should, it seems, be struck out of the Lexicon; and, if so, then Sedley's
"undifferentiated" too has no warrant. In The Hellenistic Philosophers (1:1617), Sedley and Long set forth their
joint interpretation of the Pyrrho-text, which they later characterize as "the metaphysical interpretation instead of
the narrowly epistemological reading fashionable since Zeller" (2:6).
30. Sedley is one who does so; see The Skeptical Tradition, 14. The Greek original can be found in Diogenes
Laertius, trans. R. D. Hicks, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1925), 2:478.
31. Sedley, "The Motivation of Greek Scepticism," 14.
32. There is a very good study of the possible links between Pyrrho and India by E. Flintoff, "Pyrrho and India,"
Phronesis 25 (1980): 88108. To the best of my knowledge, that study has remained almost completely disregarded
by Western students of Greek Skepticism. See, e.g., Annas and Barnes, Modes, 12, 193; Sedley, "The Motivation
of Greek Scepticism," 15. Flintoff has not said all there is to be said about this matter, but his study constitutes a
solid foundation for further scholarly exploration and philosophical theory.
33. It is a formulation accepted by many other students of philosophical skepticisme.g., G. E. Moore, "Four Forms
of Skepticism," in Philosophical Papers, 196226, esp. 196; D. J. O'Connor and Brian Carr, Introduction to the
Theory of Knowledge (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982), 23; Frede, Essays, 179, 201; Stough,
Greek Skepticism, 4; and Annas and Barnes, Modes, 7, 12, 13.
34. Unable on my own to find verification of this feature in scholarly works accessible to me, I have consulted
three classical scholars: Maria Asimakopolus, Jesuit High School, Carmichael, California; David Traill, Chair,
Department of Classics, University of California at Davis; and Leslie Threatte, Department of Classics, University
of California at Berkeley. The first said she was unaware of the feature; the second and third verified it
immediately, but were unable to refer me to any works in which the feature was even mentioned, much less
discussed and its implications drawn out. I owe thanks to all three for their generous responses to my numerous
questions, but especially to Traill and Threatte.
Neither Burnet nor Guthrie nor any of the contributors to The Pre-Socratics: A Collection of Critical Essays,
ed. Alexander P. D. Mourelatos (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor, 1974), nor G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven, The
Presocratic Philosophers, nor G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven and M. Schofield, The Pre-Socratic Philosophers,
nor Jonathan Barnes, The Presocratic Philosophers, mention the feature. In Early Greek Philosophy
(Middlesex: Penguin, 1987), Jonathan Barnes devotes a major part of his introductionsections 3, "The
Evidence" and 4, "The Texts" (2435)to a discussion of problems of translation, and with all the essentials of
that judicious and illuminating discussion I am in full agreement; but the feature of classical Greek to which I
am drawing attention remains unmentioned in that discussion.

35. I have been unable to find any hint of such principles in any of the works accessible to me, e.g., those few
mentioned in the preceding note.
36. Barnes, The Presocratic Philosophers (559), where he says that Metrodorus "purveys an extreme skepticism
which foreshadows, in its ingenious comprehensiveness, the most extravagant claims of Pyrrho." He then goes on
revealingly to admit that "of Metrodorus' book little else [but

Page 70
that one sentence] survives and nothing to tell us what his scepticism rested upon." In The Hellenistic
Philosophers (1:472), Long and Sedley espouse the same interpretation on the basis of the same sentence.
37. In section 1.4 I noted that Hamlyn cites the Greek Sophists, "especially Gorgias and Protagoras" (Theory of
Knowledge, 8n.1), as major examples of general skeptics. It is therefore worth noting in the present context that in
The Sophistic Movement (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 9399, G. B. Kerferd critically discusses
three conflicting interpretations of Gorgias' notorious "On That Which is Not, or on Nature"conflicting
interpretations still unresolvedand that in The Presocratic Philosophers Jonathan Barnes, unable to make any sense
of that treatise, merely translates it (17374, 182, 471) without commentalthough in his 700-page tome he comments
at length on every other text he deals with.
38. Barnes, The Presocratic Philosophers, 136, 144, 151.
39. Guthrie, for example, cites and discusses the epistemological speculations of Empedocles (A History of Green
Philosophy 2:22843), Anaxagoras (2:31920), and Xenophanes (1:395401)in the case of Xenophanes even
providing the heading "Theory of Knowledge" for the section on Xenophanes' epistemological speculations and
adding that "the Sceptics of the fourth century B.C. and later seized eagerly on these lines as anticipation of their
view that knowledge was unattainable." In fact, Guthrie provides the same heading, "Theory of Knowledge,'' for
his discussion of Anaxagoras.
40. I have gathered a mass of evidence concerning the pre-Socratics to this effect and can cite it on demand, but do
not do so in the present study out of considerations of brevity.
41. In A History of Greek Philosophy, Guthrie discusses the whole problem (4:4154) and sets forth the conclusions
which I have here adopted.
42. R. M. Chisholm, Theory of Knowledge (2d ed., 1977), 3, 120; also in "Theory of Knowledge," in Philosophy,
244; reprinted as "Theory of Knowledge in America," in The Foundations of Knowing, 113. In Theory of
Knowledge (3d ed., 1989), 1, Chisholm reformulates these two traditional questions, but their gist remains the
same.
43. Hamlyn, Theory of Knowledge, chap. 10, esp. secs. a and b. Hereafter cited in text.
44. That Hamlyn still subscribes to this conception of knowledge in the context of this conception of epistemology
is clear from two recent works: Metaphysics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), vii; and A History of
Western Philosophy (1988), which on its critical side repeats much (although sometimes with variations) of what
we have already recorded of his views.
45. What I call "the classical conception or theory of epistemology" has been formulated but not so designated by
Ernest Nagel in Ernest Nagel and Richard B. Brandt, eds., Meaning and Knowledge: Systematic Readings in
Epistemology (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1965), xixiii; Nagel characterizes it as "a fully adequate
epistemology" instead of as "a complete epistemology." I adopt the latter designation partly because Hamlyn does
and partly because of the notion of completeness in elementary logic, e.g., the notion of a complete logic of truth-
functions and of general quantification, etc., which is relevant to my critical assessment of Hamlyn's notion. My
account of it varies in some respects from Nagel's. Although Nagel does not say so, it seems to me that his
conception of epistemology was formulated in large measure to fit the various aspects of Chisholm's epistemology.
46. See, e.g., W. V. Quine, Philosophy of Logic (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1970; 3d ed. 1986), chap.
5; W. V. Quine, Methods of Logic (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1950; 3d ed. 1972), 7376 (for truth-
functions), 174ff., 18283 (for quantification theory), and 226 (for identity theory).
47. Cf. Locke's account of his own purpose in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, abridged and
edited by A. S. Pringle-Pattison (Oxford: Clarendon, 1924), 1.1.2.
48. At the end of his book Hamlyn explains that his use of this term, which he has used throughout the book, "is
misleading in many ways"; but he does not explain why in that case he chose to use it, or why he did not choose

instead to use an unmisleading term; Theory of Knowledge, 285.
49. Ayer says very much the same thing in The Central Questions of Philosophy, 1.

3. Epistemology, Philosophy, and the Nature of Man
1. In a succession of works, among which are Perceiving: A Philosophical Analysis (Ithaca: Cornell University
Press, 1957); "Theory of Knowledge," in Philosophy (1964), reprinted in The Foundations of Knowing (1982) as
"Theory of Knowledge in America" (circa 19301960); Theory of Knowledge (1966; 2d ed., 1977; 3d ed., 1989);
and The Foundations of Knowing (1982). Other major papers are cited below.
2. E.g., in Keith Lehrer, ed., Analysis and Metaphysics: Esays in Honor of R. M. Chisholm (Dordrecht and Boston:
Reidel, 1975); "Essays on the Philosophy of Roderick M. Chisholm," special number of Grazer Philosophische
Studien 78 (1978), reprinted as Essays on the Philosophy of Roderick M. Chisholm, ed. Ernest Sosa (Amsterdam:
Editions Rodopi N.V., 1979); "Papers on the Philosophy of Roderick M. Chisholm with His Replies," Philosophia:
Philosophical Quarterly of Israel 7, nos. 34 (July 1978).
3. First formulated in Theory of Knowledge (1966); then developed, with Robert G. Keim, in "A System of
Epistemic Logic," Ratio 14, no. 2 (December 1972): 99115; then developed further in Theory of Knowledge (2d
ed., 1977).
4. Chisholm, Theory of Knowledge, 2d ed., 12. Hereafter this edition will be cited in text.
5. That this is the case is argued in G. Chatalian, "Early Indian Buddhism and the Nature of Philosophy," Journal
of Indian Philosophy 11 (1983):167222, especially section 5 (2015) and section 4 (197209), which lays the ground
for the critique advanced in section 2.1.
6. I know of no satisfactory explanation in the philosophical literature. Those of Sextus Empiricus seem better than
any advanced in the twentieth century.
7. Locke, Essay 1.1.2.
8. Locke, Essay, 4.
9. Locke, Essay, 4.11.8.
10. Aristotle Metaphysics, book B (I.995a2527). My understanding of this passage came through the treatment of it
by Giovanni Reale, The Concept of First Philosophy and the Unity of the Metaphysics of Aristotle, ed. and trans.
John R. Catan (Albany: State Univ University of New York Press, 1980), originally published as Il concetto di
filosofia prima a l'unità della Metafisica di Aristotele (Milan: Vita e Pensiero, 1961; 2d ed., 1965; 3d ed., 1967).
The translation is of the third edition and is authorized by the author.
11. It is perhaps clear that in advancing this view I am by implication denying the economic determinism of Karl
Marx and the instrumentalism of John Dewey.
12. Aristotle Metaphysics Book A (I.980a22).
13. It is perhaps worth recording the fact that I have quite unintentionally found some evidence for this
generalization in conversations with illiterate persons.
14. Cf. A. J. Toynbee, Greek Historical Thought (New York: New American Library, Mentor, 1952), xxvii:
"Thinking is as unnatural and arduous an activity for human beings as walking on two legs is for monkeys. We
seldom do more of it than we have to."
15. Although I cannot and would not claim Hao Wang's endorsement of the present workI know that he questions
much of itI think I can justifiably claim that my general philosophical outlook is very much in accord with that
which he formulates in Beyond Analytic Philosophy: Doing Justice to What We Know. However, I would ask why
philosophers cannot aspire to do justice not only to what we know, but also to what we do not yet know but only
dimly sense, and even to what we do not yet know and do not yet even dimly sensenot only in metaphysics but
also in epistemology and in moral philosophy. The antecedent in Strawson's "If there are no new truths to be

discovered, there are old truths to be rediscovered" seems to me to be untrue in epistemology, moral philosophy,
and metaphysics.

GEORGE CHATALIAN LAST TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IFE (NIGERIA) AS Visiting Professor of
Philosophy (197883); earlier, he taught at the University of Lagos (Nigeria), where he also served as Head of the
Department of Philosophy (197678). Since his retirement from teaching in 1983 he has devoted himself mainly to
the preparation of the following book-length works: a comprehensive critical study of the worldview of a noted
American philosopher recently deceased; a comprehensive critical study (in a series of works) of the philosophy of
Leo Tolstoy; and an anthology of early (Indian) Buddhist Discourses (suttas) designed to serve as the basis of
systematic philosophical study of early Indian Buddhism. His present research also includes the study of M. K.
Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent reform both in its own terms and in terms of its relation to the Tolstoyan ideas
from which in part it was derived. Since 1950 he has published articles in American and African philosophical
journals on probability theory, metaphysics, the nature of philosophy, global philosophy, early Indian Buddhism,
and Madhyamika Buddhism.
