You are lucky!

Two key problems
1. Dated data; lacking triggers; repetitive work
2. Inflexible ways of lateral queries of knowledge (Categories and their limitations)

Two key problems
One solution
An editable central storage for structured and linked data, 
on a wiki, under a free license.
(AKA Wikidata)

In short:
Wikidata is <3

Structured data, you say?
Statement = Item --> Property --> Value
Item is any topic (Wikipedia article, thing, person, place, 
concept, etc.)
Property is a specific single kind of data relevant to this 
item (e.g. height for mountains, capitals for countries, 
gender for humans)
Value is either a reference to another Item (the capital of 
Germany is Berlin) or a literal value (e.g. 8848 meters)

Statement examples
Earth --> highest-point --> Mount Everest
Mount Everest --> elevation above sea level --> 
8848 meters
Earth --> deepest point --> Challenger Deep
Challenger Deep --> elevation above sea level --> 
-10,994±1 metre

Once more with feeling numeric IDs
Earth (Q2) --> highest-point (P610) --> Mount Everest (Q513)
Mount Everest (Q513) --> elevation above sea level (P2044) --> 
8848 meters
Earth (Q2) --> deepest point (P1589) --> Challenger Deep 
(Q459173)
Challenger Deep (Q459173) --> elevation above sea level 
(P2044) --> -10,994±1 metre

Once more without squishy humanspeak
Q2 --> P610 --> Q513
Q513 --> P2044 --> 8848 meters
Q2 --> P1589 --> Q459173
Q459173 --> P2044 --> -10,994±1 meters

Items and Properties
An item is described by a series of statements, 
each asserting a single datum or fact about it.
A property is a specific kind of information, like a 
field in a form, and is used to describe what the 
data means.

Examples
An item about a country would have statements 
about the following properties: population, land 
area, official languages, borders-with, anthem, 
capital city, demonyms, Gross Domestic Product, 
etc. etc.

Examples
An item about a person would have statements 
about: name, date of birth/death, place of 
birth/death, citizenship, occupation, languages 
spoken, religion, father, mother, children, notable 
works, place of education, etc. etc.

Querying Wikidata
* query Wikidata using [[SPARQL]]
* Wikidata will tell you everything it knows, but 
no more
* The more data and the more links in Wikidata, 
the more useful it becomes (so contribute!)
