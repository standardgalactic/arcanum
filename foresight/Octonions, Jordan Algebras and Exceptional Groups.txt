Preface 
In the summer of 1963, T.A. Springer gave a course of lectures at the Math-
ematical Institute of G6ttingen University on the theory of octonion and 
Jordan algebras and some exceptional groups related to these. Notes were 
written by Peter Eysenbach and these were published in mimeographed form 
by the G6ttingen Institute under the title "Oktaven, lordan-Algebren und 
Ausnahmegruppen" ([Sp 63] in the references at the end of this book). For 
a considerable part the results exposed in these lectures were not new, but 
they were brought in greater generality, with new proofs or with a different 
approach. New features were the introduction of twisted composition alge-
bras, and their use in the description of exceptional Jordan division algebras. 
The G6ttingen notes shared the fate of so many mimeographed lecture notes: 
to become of difficult access after some time. But they are still being referred 
to in recent publications, so that they have some actual value. Therefore a 
new edition does not seem out of place. 
The present volume contains an English version of the original German 
notes. The text has been completely revised: the order of exposition has been 
changed at several places and proofs have been rewritten. Also, the notes have 
been expanded: proofs are included for results that originally were mentioned 
without proof, additional results that fit in the framework are included and 
more recent developments are discussed. 
The initiative to publish the old notes was due to Martin Kneser. We thank 
him heartily for his past and present interest. Also, we are indebted to Peter 
Eysenbach for writing the original German notes. 
We most gratefully acknowledge the help of Joseph C. Ferrar, who very care-
fully read the whole text of the present version. He sJ-ved us from several 
errors and offered numerous suggestions for improvement. We are also very

new version of old notes.

1. Composition Algebras 
In this chapter we present the basic theory of composition algebras and de-
termine their structure. Since these are (not necessarily associative) alge-
bras with quadratic norms, we need some fundamental parts of the theory 
of quadratic forms, which we therefore recall in the first section. It will be 
shown that the norm on a composition algebra already determines the alge-
bra up to isomorphism. This leads to a more or less explicit determination 
of all composition algebras over some special fields, using the classification of 
quadratic forms over these fields. 
The theory in this chapter, and in the following two chapters, will in 
general be developed over arbitrary fields. In particular, there will be no 
restriction on the characteristic, though occasionally in characteristic two 
the situation may be slightly different from other characteristics. 
1.1 Quadratic and Bilinear Forms 
In this section we present some basic material from the theory of quadratic 
and bilinear forms. For proofs and more information about these forms, 
we refer the reader to [Che 54, Ch. 1] or [Dieu, Ch. I, § 11 and § 16]j for 
forms over fields of characteristic #2, one may consult textbooks like [Ja 74, 
Ch. 6], [Lam], [Lang, Ch. XIVj, [O'M, § 42F] or [Schar, Ch. 1]. For the ba-
sic definitions and most elementary results no restriction on the dimension of 
vector spaces is needed, but sometimes the dimension must be finite, which we 
will make mention of in each case. For quadratic forms in infinite-dimensional 
spaces in particular, we refer to [Gro]. 
To begin with, we recall that a quadratic form on a vector space V over 
a field k is a mapping N : V -+ k with the properties: 
(i) N(>..x) = >..2 N(x) (>.. E k, x E V)j 
(ii) The mapping ( , ) : V x V -+ k defined by 
(x,y) = N(x + y) - N(x) - N(y) 
is bilinear, i.e., it is linear in each of x and y separately. 
One calls ( , ) the bilinear form associated with Nj as one sees, it is 
symmetric. If there is danger of confusion, we may use the notation N( , ) 

2 
1. Composition Algebras 
for the bilinear form associated with a quadratic form N, so N(x, y) instead 
of (x, y). From the conditions (i) and (ii) it follows that 
(x,x) = N(x+x)-N(x)-N(x) = N(2x)-2N(x) = 4N(x)-2N(x) = 2N(x). 
So if char(k) i 2, then N(x) = !(x,x). But if char(k) = 2, then always 
(x, x) = O. The case char(k) = 2 will sometimes require a separate treatment 
in the sequel. 
A vector x E V is called isotropic if N(x) = 0 and anisotropic if N(x) i O. 
The quadratic form N is said to be isotropic if there exist nonzero isotropic 
vectors in V and anistropic otherwise. Finally, a subspace W of V is said 
to be anisotropic or isotropic if the restriction of N to W is anisut.ropic or 
isotropic, respectively, and totally isotropic if N(x) = 0 for all x E W. 
The mdical R of N is defined by 
R = {r E V I (r, x) = 0 for all x E V, N(r) = O}. 
If char(k) i 2, (r, x) = 0 for all x E V implies already that N(r) = !( r, r) = 
0, so in that case 
R = {r E V I (r, x) = 0 for all x E V}. 
Consider a bilinear form ( , ) : V x V -+ k. The vectors x, y E V are 
said to be orthogonal if (x, y) = OJ notation: x 1- y. Two subspaces P and 
Q of V are called orthogonal, P 1- Q, if x 1- y for all x E P and y E Q. The 
orthogonal complement of a subspace P of V is 
p.i = {x E Vlx 1- yfor all YEP}. 
p.i is a subspace of V. For a E V we usually write a.i instead of (ka).i. 
The form ( , ) is said to be nondegenemte if V.i = 0, i.e., if 
(x, y) = 0 for all y E V => x = O. 
From this condition we infer: If (a, y) = (b, y) for all y E V, then a = b. 
A linear subspace W of V such that the restriction of ( , ) to W x W 
is nondegenerate, is called a nonsingular subspace. If W is a nonsingular 
subspace of finite dimension, then V = W El1 W.i, a direct sum decomposition, 
and W.i is nons in gular , too. 
A quadratic form N on a vector space V over k is called nondegenemte, 
if the associated bilinear form ( , ) is nondegenerate (see Rem. 1.2.2 below). 
If N is a quadratic form on V and the subspace W of V is nonsingular with 
respect to the associated bilinear form, then W may be considered as a vector 
space with a nondegenerate quadratic form, viz., the restriction of N to W. 
If char(k) = 2, the fact that N is nondegenerate on a finite-dimensional 
space V means that V has even dimension and N is nondefective in the sense 
of [Dieu, Ch. I, § 16]. 

1.1 Quadratic and Bilinear Forms 
3 
With respect to a quadratic form N on V, all maximal totally isotropic 
subspaces of V have the same dimension, which is called the Witt index (or 
index for short) of N. If N is nondegenerate and dim V is finite, the index is 
at most equal to ~ dim V. 
Let Vi (i = 1, 2) be vector spaces over fields ki , with nondegenerate 
quadratic forms Ni and associated bilinear forms ( , k A a-similarity t of 
V1 onto V2, where a is an isomorphism of kl onto k2 , is a surjective a-linear 
mapping such that 
(x E vd 
for some n(t) E k*, called the multiplier of t. Clearly, (t(x), t(Y))2 = 
n( t )a( ( X, y h), from which it follows that t is also injective and hence bi-
jective. If a = id, one calls t a similarity; if n(t) = 1, then t is said to be 
a a-isometry; if both n(t) = 1 and a = id, then t is an isometry. If there 
exists a a-similarity or a similarity of V1 onto V2, one calls the quadratic 
forms Nl and N2 a-similar or similar, respectively; in case of a-isometries 
one speaks of a -isometric forms and in case of isometries of isometric or 
rather of equivalent forms. 
A key result about isometries is Witt's Theorem: If V1 and V2 have fi-
nite dimension and the nondegenerate forms Nl on V1 and N2 on V2 are 
a-isometric, then every a-isometry of a subspace of V1 onto a subspace of V2 
can be extended to a a-isometry of V1 onto V2 . 
In the case of one vector space V with a nondegenerate quadratic form 
N, an isometry of V onto itself is called an orthogonal transformation in 
V with respect to N. These orthogonal transformations form a group, the 
orthogonal group in V, denoted by O(N). Orthogonal transformations in 
finite dimension have determinant ±1, and if char(k) # 2, the orthogonal 
transformations having determinant 1 form a subgroup SO(N) of index 2 in 
O(N), called the special orthogonal group or rotation group with respect to 
N; its elements are called rotations. The definition of SO(N) in characteristic 
2 is different; see [Dieu, Ch. II, § 10]. 
Consider again an arbitrary quadratic form N on a vector space V over 
k. A special type of orthogonal transformations which are not rotations are 
the following. For a E V with N (a) # 0 we define Sa by 
sa(x) = X - N(a)-l (x, a)a 
(X E V). 
(1.1) 
If char(k) # 2, this is the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to a. If 
char(k) = 2, it is the orthogonal transvection with center a. We will use the 
word "reflection" to also mean an orthogonal transvection in characteristic 2. 
By a hyperbolic plane we understand a two-dimensional subspace H = 
ka EIJ kb with N(a) = N(b) = 0, (a, b) = 1. If k has characteristic # 2, this 
is equivalent to requiring that H = kc EIJ kd with N(c) = 1, N(d) = -1 
and (c,d) = 0 (take c = a + b, d = a - b, and conversely a = ~(c + d), 
b = ~ (c - d)). Every nonzero isotropic vector not contained in the radical is 

4 
1. Composition Algebras 
contained in a hyperbolic plane. On a hyperbolic plane, the quadratic form 
N takes all values since N(~a + TJb) = 
~TJ. In particular, a nondegenerate 
isotropic quadratic form takes all values. If HI and H2 are hyperbolic planes 
in V, the restrictions of N to HI and H2, respectively, are equivalent, so by 
Witt's Theorem the same holds for their orthogonal complements Hi- and 
H;j-, provided N is nondegenerate and dim V is finite. 
1.2 Composition Algebras. The Minimum Equation 
After the above preparations, we start with composition algebras. 
Definition 1.2.1 A composition algebra C over a field k is a not necessarily 
associative algebra over k with identity element e such that there exists a 
nondegenerate quadratic form N on C which permits composition, Le., such 
that 
N(xy) = N(x)N(y) 
(X,yEC). 
The quadratic form N is often referred to as the norm on C, and the associ-
ated bilinear form ( , ) is called the inner product. A linear subspace of Cis 
said to be nonsingular, if it is nonsingular with respect to the inner product. 
By a subalgebra of a composition algebra C, or composition subalgebra, 
we understand a nonsingular linear subspace D which is closed under multi-
plication and contains the identity element e of C. 
Let Ci be a composition algebra over ki with norm Ni for i = 1,2, and let 
a denote an isomorphism of kl onto k2. A bijective a-linear transformation 
t : CI --+ C2 is called a a-isomorphism if 
t(xy) = t(x)t(y) 
We call t a linear isomorphism, or isomorphism for short, if kl = k2 and 
a = id. 
In Cor. 1.2.4 we will see that the norm N on a composition algebra is 
already determined by the algebra structure, i.e., the structure of vector space 
with a product, and that a a-isomorphism is automatically a a-isometry. 
Conversely, it will be shown in Th. 1.7.1 that the existence of a a-similarity 
between two composition algebras implies that they are a-isomorphic. So the 
algebra structure and the metric structure on a composition algebra mutually 
determine each other. 
In the above definition, no restriction on the dimension of Cover k is 
made. We will see, however, that this dimension must be finite and can, in 
fact, only be 1, 2, 4 or 8 (see Th. 1.6.2). 
Remark 1.2.2 In the literature, one also calls a quadratic form N nonde-
generate if N(a+x) = N(x) for all x implies a = 0, or equivalently, N(a) = 0 
and (a, x) = 0 for all x implies a = o. In characteristic i 2 this is equivalent 

1.2 Composition Algebras. The Minimum Equation 
5 
to the definition we have given in § 1.1, since then (a, x) = 0 for all x implies 
N(a) = o. In characteristic 2, the alternative definition would lead to some 
more composition algebras, viz., k itself (as in all other characteristics, see 
Th. 1.6.2) and certain purely inseparable field extensions of k; cf. [BlSp 59, 
p. 408]. Since the latter case is uninteresting, we have preferred to call a 
quadratic form nondegenerate if the associated bilinear form is nondegener-
ate; this makes certain proofs simpler. 
From Def. 1.2.1 we will derive a number of equations for the norm and 
the associated bilinear form on a composition algebra. From 
N(x) = N(ex) = N(e)N(x) 
(x E C) 
we deduce 
N(e) = 1. 
Further, we have 
N(XlY + X2Y) = N(XlY) + N(X2Y) + (XlY, X2Y) 
= N(Xl)N(y) + N(X2)N(y) + (XlY, X2Y), 
and on the other hand 
hence 
N(XlY + X2Y) = N«Xl + X2)Y) = N(XI + x2)N(y) = 
N(xd + N(X2) + (Xl, X2) )N(y), 
In a similar way we find 
(1.2) 
(1.3) 
(1.4) 
If we replace Y by Yl + Y2 in equation (1.3) and subtract from both sides the 
terms with Yl only or Y2 only, we obtain 
(XIYl,X2Y2) + (XIY2,X2Yl) = (Xl,X2 )(Yl,Y2) 
(XllX2,Yl,Y2 E C). 
(1.5) 
We say that this equation is obtained from (1.3) by linearizing it with respect 
to the variable y. A special case of (1.5) is 
(X,yX) + (x2,y) = (x,y)(e,x) 
(X,y E C), 
(1.6) 
which we will use in the proof of the proposition that follows. This proposition 
says that every element of a composition algebra satisfies a quadratic equa-
tion, which is its minimum equation if the element is not a scalar multiple of 
the identity. 

6 
1. Composition Algebras 
Proposition 1.2.3 Every element x of a composition algebra C satisfies 
x2 - (x,e)x + N(x)e = O. 
(1.7) 
Forx,y E C we have 
xy + yx - (x, e)y - (y, e)x + (x, y)e = O. 
(1.8) 
If the subspace ketBkx is two-dimensional and nonsingular, it is a composition 
algebra. 
Proof. Form the inner product of the' left hand side of equation (1.7) with an 
arbitrary element y of C: 
(x2 - (x,e)x + N(x)e,y) = (x2,y) - (x,e)(x,y) + N(x)(e,y) 
= (x2,y) - (x,e)(x,y) + (x,yx) 
(by (1.3)) 
= 0 
(by (1.6)). 
Since this holds for all y E C, (1.7) follows. The other equation is proved by 
linearizing, i.e., by replacing x by x + y in (1.7) and subtracting from the 
expression thus obtained the equations (1.7) for x and y, respectively. 
To prove the last point observe that W = ke tB kx is a commutative and 
associative subalgebra of C by (1.7). If W is two-dimensional, N(ae + f3x) = 
a2 + af3(x, e) + f32 N(x) is the determinant of the linear map of W defined 
by multiplication with ae + f3x. It follows that the restriction of N permits 
composition and that W is a composition subalgebra if that restriction is 
nonsingular. 
0 
Formula (1.8) is convenient for changing the order in certain products; it 
implies, in particular, that xy = -yx if x, y E e.L with x 1- y. 
Corollary 1.2.4 The norm N on a composition algebra is uniquely de-
termined by its algebra structure (vector space with multiplication). A a-
isomorphism is necessarily a a-isometry. 
Proof. N().e) = ).2, and for x ¢ ke, (1.7) is the minimum equation of x, which 
is unique. The second statement follows by a similar argument. 
0 
The powers of an element x of any nonassociative algebra A are defined 
inductively by 
and 
(If A has an identity element e, one starts off with XO = e.) A is said to be 
power associative if xixj = xi+j (i, j 2: 1) for all x E A, or equivalently if 
the subalgebra k[x] generated by x is associative for every x E A. (The word 
"subalgebra" here means a linear subspace closed under multiplication, as 
is usual in the theory of general nonassociative algebras; it is also assumed 

1.3 Conjugation. Inverses 
7 
to contain the identity element, if there exists one in the whole algebra. For 
a "composition sub algebra" we require in addition that it is a nonsingular 
subspace, see Def. 1.2.1.) From (1.7) it is immediate that in a composition 
algebra xx2 = x 2x for all x, and from this it follows by a straightforward 
computation that for any x E C the one- or two-dimensional algebra k[x] is 
associative. Thus we have: 
Corollary 1.2.5 Composition algebras are power associative. 
1.3 Conjugation. Inverses 
We now introduce conjugation in a composition algebra C, which is the map-
ping - : C ~ C defined by 
x = (x,e)e - x = -se(x) 
(x E C), 
(1.9) 
where Se is the reflection in e.l. One calls x the conjugate of x. 
Lemma 1.3.1 The following rules hold for conjugation in a composition al-
gebra. 
(i) xx = xx = N(x)e; 
(ii) xy = yx; 
(iii) x = x; 
(iv) x + y = x + y; 
(v) N(x) = N(x); 
(vi) (x,y)=(x,y). 
Proof. (i) Immediate from (1.7). 
(ii) This is proved by the following computation. 
yx = «(y,e)e-y)«(x,e)e-x) 
= (x,e)(y,e)e- (x,e)y- (y,e)x+yx 
= (x,e)(y,e)e-xy- (x,y)e 
(by (1.8)) 
= (xy, e)e - xy 
(by (1.5)) 
= xy. 
(iii) This follows from the fact that x ........ -x is a reflection, or by a straight-
forward computation. 
(iv) Immediate. 
(v) N(x)e = xx = xx = N(x)e. 
(vi) Immediate from (v) and (iv).

Other useful identities are given in the following lemma.

1. Composition Algebras 
Lemma 1.3.2 For x, y, z E C, 
(xy,z) = (y,xz), 
(xy,Z) = (x,zy), 
(xy,z) = (yz,x). 
(1.10) 
(1.11) 
(1.12) 
The last equation shows that (xy, z) is invariant under cyclic permutations. 
Proof. We prove the first equation; the other ones then easily follow by using 
Lemma 1.3.1. 
(y,xz) = (y,«(x,e)e-x)z) = (x,e)(y,z) - (y,xz) 
= (xy,z) + (xz,y) - (y,xz) 
(by (1.5)) 
= (xy,z). 
From the above lemma we derive some more important formulas. 
Lemma 1.3.3 For all x, y, z E C, 
(i) x(xy) = N(x)y; 
(ii) (xy)y = N(y)x; 
(iii) x(yz) + y(xz) = (x, y )z; 
(iv) (xy)z + (xz)y = (y, z )x. 
Proof. To prove (i), we take the inner product of x(xy) with any z E C: 
(x(xy),z) = (xy,xz) 
= N(x)(y,z) 
= (N(x)y, z). 
(by the previous lemma) 
(by (1.4) and Lemma 1.3.1 (v)) 
o 
Since this holds for all z E C, we get the result. By conjugating (i) we get 
(ii), and (iii) and (iv) follow by linearizing (i) and (ii). 
0 
The first two statements of this lemma can be interpreted as associativity 
results; indeed, since xx = N(x), we can read (i) as 
x(xy) = (xx)y 
and similarly for (ii). Recall that we have not assumed associativity in 
Def. 1.2.1. We will see in Th. 1.6.2 that there are, indeed, composition alge-
bras that are not associative. 
In a not necessarily associative algebra A an element a is said to have b 
as an inverse if 
a(bx) = b(ax) = (xa)b = (xb)a = x 
(x E A). 

1.4 Moufang Identities. Alternative Laws

In other words: a has b as an inverse if and only if the left multiplication 
la : A -4 A, x I--t ax, and the right multiplication ra : A -4 A, x I--t xa, are 
invertible and have lb and rb as inverses, respectively. If A has an identity 
element e, then ab = ba = e; in that case the inverse b is uniquely determined 
by a, viz., b = l;;le, and it is denoted by a-l. 
Proposition 1.3.4 In a composition algebra an element a has an inverse if 
and only if N(a) 1= 0, and then a-l = N(a)-la. 
Proof. Use (i) and (ii) of Lemma 1.3.3.

1.4 Moufang Identities. Alternative Laws 
The aim of this section is the proof of three important identities for compo-
sition algebras, the Moufang identities, and some consequences thereof. 
Proposition 1.4.1 In any composition algebra, the following identities hold. 
(ax)(ya) = a((xy)a); 
a(x(ay)) = (a(xa))y; 
x(a(ya)) = ((xa)y)a. 
(1.13) 
(1.14) 
(1.15) 
(M oufang identities) 
Proof. To prove the first identity we form the inner product of the left hand 
side of (1.13) with an arbitrary z E C: 
((ax)(ya),z) = (ya, (xa)z) 
(by (1.10) and Lemma 1.3.1) 
= (y,xa)(a,z) - (yz,(xa)a) 
(by (1.5)) 
= (xy,a)(z,a) - N(a)(yz,x) 
(by (1.10) and Lemma 1.3.3). 
The inner product of the right hand side of (1.13) with any z becomes 
(a((xy)a),z) = ((xy)a,az) 
= (xy,a)(a,z) - ((xy)z,aa) 
= (xy, a ) ( z, a) - N ( a) ( (xy) z, e ) 
= (xy,a)(z,a) - N(a)(xy,z) 
= (xy,a)(z,a) - N(a)(yz,x). 
So the left hand side and the right hand side of (1.13) have the same inner 
product with every z, which implies that they are equal. The proof of the 
second identity runs along similar lines: 

10 
1. Composition Algebras 
( (a(xa»y, z) = (a(xa), zy) 
= (xa, a(zy)) 
= (x, (a(zy))a) 
= (x, a((yz)a)) 
= (x, (ay)(za)) 
= (x, (az)(ya) ) 
= (x(ay), az) 
= (a(x(ay)),z), 
(by Lemma 1.3.1 (vi)) 
(by the first Moufang identity) 
(by Lemma 1.3.1 (vi) again) 
which proves the second Moufang identity. To prove the third identity, conju-
gate the second one and use Lemma 1.3.1 (ii) and the identity (ax)a = a(xa), 
which follows from (1.13). 
0 
From the Moufang identities we derive three more associativity relations. 
Lemma 1.4.2 In a composition algebra the following identities hold. 
(xy)x = x(yx); 
x(xy) = x2y; 
(xy)y = xy2. 
(1.16) 
(1.17) 
(1.18) 
(Alternative laws). 
This means that for all x E C, the left multiplication Ix and the right multi-
plication rx commute: lxrx = rxlx, and that l~ = lx2, r~ = rx2. 
Proof. The first relation is immediate from the first Moufang identity (1.13). 
The second relation is a consequence of the following set of equalities: 
x(xy) = (xx)y 
(by Lemma 1.3.3), 
x(((x,e)e-x)y) = (x((x,e)e-x))y, 
x((x,e)y-xy) = ((x,e)x-x2)y, 
(x,e)xy - x(xy) = (x,e)xy - x2y. 
The third relation is proved in a similar way. 
o 
The three relations of this lemma permit us to rewrite the Moufang iden-
tities in the following form: 
The expression 
(ax)(ya) = (a(xy»a; 
a(x(ay)) = ((ax)a)y; 
x((ay)a) = ((xa)y)a. 
{x,y,z} = (xy)z - x(yz)

1.5 Subalgebras. Doubling

is called the associator of x, y and z. It is trilinear, i.e., linear in each of 
its three variables, because of the distributive law. Lemma 1.4.2 says that 
the associator vanishes whenever two of its variables are equal, i.e., it is 
an alternating function. Any not necessarily associative algebra with this 
property is called an alternative algebra. By linearizing the alternative laws 
one shows that the associator changes sign whenever two of its variables are 
interchanged, so it is skew symmetric: {X".(l) , x". (2) ,X".(3)} = Sg(1T){Xl' X2, X3} 
for any permutation 1T. In characteristic i= 2 the latter property is equivalent 
to the alternative laws, but in characteristic 2 it is weaker. 
In an alternative algebra associativity holds for any product of three ele-
ments at most two of which are distinct, by definition. A beautiful result by 
Artin says that this implies a stronger property, viz., that every subalgebra 
generated by two elements is associative: 
Theorem 1.4.3 (E. Artin) The subalgebra generated by any two elements 
of an alternative algebra is associative. 
For a proof, we refer to [Schaf, Th. 3.1], or to [Ja 74, § 7.6, ex. 9j. 
0 
This implies in particular that any alternative algebra is power associative; 
for composition algebras we saw this already in Cor. 1.2.5. 
1.5 Subalgebras. Doubling 
In this section we study finite-dimensional sub algebras of composition alge-
bras; these will be the key to the description of the structure of composition 
algebras. (In the next section we will see that all composition algebras have 
finite dimension, so then the restriction "finite-dimensional" becomes super-
fluous.) It is clear that a sub algebra of a composition algebra is closed under 
conjugation. 
Let C be a composition algebra and D a finite-dimensional composition 
subalgebra. Since D is a nonsingular subspace of finite dimension, C = D EB 
DJ. and DJ. is also nonsingular. If D i= C, there must exist a E DJ. which is 
anisotropic, Le., N(a) i= o. 
Proposition 1.5.1 Let C be a composition algebra and D a finite-dimensional 
composition subalgebra, D i= C. If a is chosen in DJ. with N(a) i= 0, then 
is a composition subalgebra. Product, norm and conjugation on Dl are given 
by the formulas 
(x + ya)(u + va) = (xu + Xvy) + (vx + yu)a 
(x, y, u, v E D ),(1.22) 
N(x + ya) = N(x) - >..N(y) 
(x, y E D), 
(1.23) 
x + ya = x - ya 
(x, y E D), 
(1.24) 

12 
1. Composition Algebras 
respectively, where >. = - N (a), and dim Dl = 2 dim D. 
Proof. We begin by shoWing that Da ~ DJ..., from which it follows that the 
sum of D and Da is indeed direct. If XED, then 
( xa, y) = (a, xy) = 0 
(y ED), 
so xa E DJ.... It is evident that Dl is closed under addition. To prove this for 
multiplication, it suffices to derive (1.22). This formula is a consequence of 
the following three formulas: 
x(va) = (vx)a 
(x,v ED); 
(ya)u = (yu)a 
(y,u ED); 
(ya)(va) = -N(a)vy 
(y, v ED). 
(1.25) 
(1.26) 
(1.27) 
To prove the first of these three formulas, we form the inner product of the 
left hand side with an arbitrary z E C: 
( x( va), z} = (va, xz ) 
= -(va,zx) 
(by (1.9), since (va,e) = 0) 
= (vx,za) 
(by (1.5) and (a,x) = 0) 
= -(vx,za) + (z,e)(vx,a) 
(by (1.9)) 
= -(vx,za) 
(since (vx,a) = 0) 
= ( (vx )a, z) 
(since a = -a). 
Since this holds for all z E C, formula (1.25) follows. The proof of (1.26) is 
similar, but easier: use (1.5) and a E DJ.... For the proof of (1.27), we first 
notice that 
ya = -ay + (ya, e)e = ay 
since ya E DJ... and a = -a. Now 
(y ED), 
(1.28) 
(ya)( va) = (ay)( va) 
= a((yv)a) 
= a(a(vy)) 
= -N(a)(vy) 
(by (1.28)) 
(by the first Moufang identity, (1.13)) 
(by (1.28) again) 
(by Lemma 1.3.3 (i), since a = -a). 
This completes the proof of (1.27), whence also that of formula (1.22). 
Since (x, ya) = 0, we have 
N(x + ya) = N(x) + N(y)N(a), 
which proves formula (1.23). From this it easily follows that the norm N is 
nondegenerate on D1, which completes the proof that Dl is a composition 
subalgebra. 

1.5 Subalgebras. Doubling 
13 
Formula (1.24) is proved as follows: 
x + ya = x + ay = x - ay = x - ya 
using (1.28). 
Since Ta : D --+ Da is bijective, Da has the same dimension as D, so 
Dl = D E9 Da has double dimension. 
0 
Dl is said to be constructed from D by doubling. 
Proposition 1.5.2 Let C be a composition algebra and D a finite-dimensional 
proper subalgebra. Then D is associative. A subalgebra DE9Da, where a E D.L 
with N(a) 1= 0, is associative if and only if D is commutative and associative. 
Proof. Choose any a E D.L with N (a) 1= OJ let again >. = - N (a). By writing 
out 
N«x + ya)(u + va)) = N(x + ya)N(u + va) 
(x,y,u,v ED), 
we find 
(xu,vy) - (vx,yu) = 0, 
hence 
(xu)y,v) = (v,(yu)x) = (x(uy),v). 
Thus (xy)z, w) = (x(yz), w) for all wED, which implies that (xy)z = 
x(yz) for all x, y, zED, i.e., D is associative. 
Now assume that DE9Da is associative, where a E D.L with N(a) 1= O. By 
(1.25), x(va) = (vx)a. Using associativity we get (xv)a = (vx)a. Multiplying 
this on the right by a-l yields xv = vx, which proves commutativity of D. 
Conversely, a straightforward computation shows that D E9 Da is associative 
if D is commutative and associative. 
0 
As a counterpart of Prop. 1.5.1 we have the following result, which per-
mits us to start from any associative composition algebra D and construct a 
composition algebra C from it by doubling. 
Proposition 1.5.3 Let D be a composition algebra and>' E k*. Define on 
C = D E9 D (direct sum) a product by 
(x, y)(u, v) = (xu + >.vy, vx + yu) 
(x,y,u,v E D) 
and a quadratic form N by 
N«x, y)) = N(x) - >.N(y) 
(x,y ED). 
If D is associative, then C is a composition algebra. C is associative if and 
only if D is commutative and associative. 
Proof. The verification of these facts is left to the reader.

1.6 Structure and Dimension of a Composition Algebra 
The results of the previous section enable us to prove a key result on the struc-
ture of a composition algebra C. Assume C has dimension> 1. If char(k) i 2, 
the subspace D = ke is a subalgebra of C, and with the aid of Prop. 1.5.1 
we find a two-dimensional subalgebra Dl. In case char(k) = 2 we have to 
proceed differently, for then the subspace ke is no longer nonsingular since 
(e, e) = O. In this case, pick any a with (a, e) i 0. 
Lemma 1.6.1 Let C be a composition algebra over a field k of characteristic 
2. If a E C with (a, e) i 0, the linear subspace ke EB ka is a two-dimensional 
composition subalgebra of C. 
Proof. The subspace ke EB ka is nonsingular, for Ae + /La 1- e, a yields /L = ° 
and A = O. By Prop. 1.2.3, Dl = ke EB ka is a composition subalgebra. 
0 
Thus we have found a two-dimensional sub algebra Dl of C in any charac-
teristic. If dim C > 2, we apply Prop. 1.5.1 again to find a four-dimensional 
subalgebra D2 :::) Db and if dim C > 4, we repeat this to obtain an eight-
dimensional sub algebra D3 :::) D2 . In this way we get a sequence of composi-
tion sub algebras Dl C D2 C D3 of dimensions 2, 4 and 8, respectively. 
At this point the doubling process has to stop, as the following argument 
shows. Dl is evidently a commutative, associative subalgebra. By Prop. 1.5.2, 
D2 must be associative; however, it is not commutative. For pick a E Dl 
with a i a; from the argument at the beginning of this section it follows that 
D2 n Dr is nonsingular, so there exists x E D2 n Dr with N{x) i 0. Then 
xa+ ax = 0, 
whence 
xa = ax i ax. 
This implies by Prop. 1.5.2 that D3 is not associative, so by the same propo-
sition D3 is not a proper subalgebra of C. Thus we have proved the following 
structure theorem. 
Theorem 1.6.2 Every composition algebra is obtained by repeated doubling, 
starting from ke in characteristic i 2 and from a 2-dimensional composition 
subalgebra in characteristic 2. The possible dimensions of a composition al-
gebra are 1 (in characteristic i 2 only), 2, 4 and 8. Composition algebras 
of dimension 1 or 2 are commutative and associative, those of dimension 4 
are associative but not commutative, and those of dimension 8 are neither 
commutative nor associative. 
A composition algebra of dimension 2 over k is either a quadratic field 
extension of k or is isomorphic to kEBk. A composition algebra C of dimension 
4 is called a quaternion algebra and its elements are called quaternions. If C 
has dimension 8, it is called an octonion algebra and its elements are called 
octonions. 

1.6 Structure and Dimension of a Composition Algebra 
15 
Corollary 1.6.3 Any octonion algebra C over a field k of characteris-
tic i= 2 has an orthogonal basis of the form e, a, b, ab, c, ac, bc, (ab)c with 
JV(a)JV(b)JV(c) i= o. 
If char(k) = 2, then C has a basis e, a, b, ab, c, ac, bc, (ab)c with 
(e, a) = 1, 
(b, ab) = JV(b), 
(c, ac) = JV(c), 
(bc, (ab)c) = JV(b)JV(c), 
all other inner products between distinct basis vectors are zero and 
JV(a)JV(b)JV(c) i= O. 
Similarly for quaternion algebras and for two-dimensional composition alge-
bras, except in one case, viz., k = 1F2' dimC = 2, JV isotropic. 
Proof. In the characteristic i= 2 case one uses the proof of Th. 1.6.2 and 
Prop. 1.5.1. If char(k) = 2 one uses in addition Lemma 1.6.1 to construct 
a basis satisfying the inner product relations between distinct basis vectors 
and such that JV(b)JV(c) i= O. If then JV(a) = 0 and dimC > 2, one starts 
again with a replaced by a' = a + b and then proceeds to find b' and c' for 
the desired basis. If char(k) = 2, k i= 1F2' dimC = 2 and JV(a) = 0 for some 
a with (e, a) = 1, then replace a by a' = >.e + a with>' i= 0,1. (In the 
exceptional case C ~ 1F2 EB 1F2.) 
0 
We call a triple a, b, c in an octonion algebra that provides a basis as in 
the above corollary a basic triple. 
If char(k) i= 2, we understand by a standard orthogonal basis of an octo-
nion algebra C an orthogonal basis as in the above corollary, but normalized 
so as to make the product of the norms of all basis vectors equal to 1: 
(1.29) 
In an octonion algebra C over a field k of characteristic 2 we take a basis 
as in the above corollary. Then el = e, e2 = b, e3 = c, e4 = bc, e5 = a, 
e6 = JV(b)-lab, e7 = JV(c)-lac, e8 = JV(b)-l JV(c)-l(ab)c form a basis of C 
such that 
(ei,ei+4) =1 
(l~i~4) and (ei,ej)=O 
(l~i<j~8,ji=i+4), 
(1.30) 
which we call a symplectic basis. After at most three separable quadratic 
extensions of k we may require in addition that JV(a) = JV(b) = JV(c) = 1. 
Then we get a symplectic basis with JV(ei) = 1 for all i; we call that a 
standard symplectic basis of C. 
Let a be any element of a composition algebra that is not a multiple of 
the identity. If ke EB ka is nonsingular, it is a sub algebra by Prop. 1.2.3. But 
if the restriction of the norm to ke EB ka is degenerate, a is not contained in 
a two-dimensional subalgebra. However, we can prove that a is contained in 
a four-dimensional subalgebra. 

16 
1. Composition Algebras 
Proposition 1.6.4 Every element a of an octonion algebra Cover k is con-
tained in a quaternion subalgebra of C. 
Proof. For a E ke this is obvious, so assume a f/. ke. If char(k) -# 2, we may 
assume that (a, e) = 0, for if not, we can replace a by a - ! ( a, e )e. If either 
char(k) -# 2, (a, e) = 0 and N(a) -# 0 or char(k) = 2 and (a, e) -# 0, then 
the subspace D = ke EEl ka is nonsingular, so it is a subalgebra. By doubling 
D we get a quaternion subalgebra containing a. 
Now assume char(k) -# 2, (a, e) = 0 and N(a) = o. Pick b E e.L with 
(a, b) -# 0 and N(b) -# o. The subspace D = ke EEl kb is a subalgebra. Take 
c = a + )"b with (c, b) = o. One easily sees that N(c) = _)..2 N(b) -# O. So 
c E Dl.. with N(c) -# 0 and D EEl Dc is a quaternion sub algebra containing a 
(cf. Prop. 1.5.1). 
Finally, we have to consider the case where char(k) = 2 and (a, e) = o. 
We may assume that N(a) -# 0, for otherwise replace a by e + a. Since el.. 
and al.. are distinct subspaces of the same dimension, we can find b with 
( a, b) = 0 and (e, b) -# o. Then D = ke EEl kb is a subalgebra. Now a E D.L 
and N(a) -# 0, so D EEl Da is a quaternion subalgebra that contains a.

1. 7 A Composition Algebra is Determined by its Norm 
The metric structure of a composition algebra C already determines its alge-
braic structure, i.e., a scalar multiple of the norm on C determines C up to 
isomorphism: 
Theorem 1.7.1 Let C and C' be composition algebras over fields k and k', 
respectively, and let a : k --+ k' be a field isomorphism. If there exists a 
a -similarity of C onto C', then the two algebras are a -isomorphic. 
Proof. The identity elements of C and C' are denoted by e and e', respectively; 
the two norms are both denoted by N. Let t : C --+ C' be a a-similarity with 
multiplier n(t). Since N(t(e)) = n(t)N(e) = n(t) -# 0, t(e) is invertible. The 
map 
C --+ C', X t-+ t(e)-lt(x), 
is a a-isometry which maps e to e', so we may assume that t is a a-isometry 
with t(e) = e'. 
We give the rest of the proof for octonion algebras; in lower dimensions 
one just has to stop earlier. For simplicity of notation, we write down the 
proof in the case that t is an isometry, i.e., a = id; the general case is a 
straightforward extension. We are going to construct a linear isomorphism 
cp : C --+ C'. 
Pick a E C with (a, e) = 0 and N(a) -# 0 if char k -# 2, and with (a, e) = 
1 if char k = 2, and take a' = t(a). Then N(a') = N(a) and (a', e') = (a, e). 

1. 7 A Composition Algebra is Determined by its Norm 
17 
The two-dimensional subalgebras D = ke E9 ka and D' = ke' E9 ka' of C and 
C', respectively, are isomorphic and 
c.p : D --+ D', Ae + JLa 1-+ Ae' + JLa' 
(A, JL E k), 
is an isomorphism; if char k ::! 2, this follows from Prop. 1.5.1, and in the 
characteristic 2 case one has to use Lemma 1.6.1. Notice that c.p coincides 
with the restriction of t to D. 
Pick b E Dl. with N(b) ::! 0 and take b' = t(b); then b' E D'l. and 
N(b') = N(b). We extend c.p to D E9 Db by defining 
c.p(x + yb) = c.p(x) + c.p(y)b' 
(x,y ED). 
This is an isomorphism from the subalgebra E = DE9Db onto the subalgebra 
E' = D' E9 D'b' by Prop. 1.5.1, using that c.p(x) = c.p(x) for xED. 
By Witt's Theorem we can extend c.p to an isometry u : C --+ C'. Now we 
repeat the last step with c E El., N(c) ::! 0 and c' = u(c), extending c.p to an 
isomorphism from C onto C' by 
c.p(x + yc) = c.p(x) + c.p(y)c' 
(x,y E E). 
o 
As a special case of the above theorem we have the following corollary. 
Corollary 1.7.2 Let C be a composition algebra over k and 0' a field auto-
morphism of k. Then there exists a a-automorphism of C if and only if there 
exists a a-isometry of C onto itself. 
From the proof of the Theorem we infer another important corollary. 
Corollary 1.7.3 Let C be a composition algebra and let D and D' be sub-
algebras of the same dimension. If C admits a a-isometry onto itself, then 
every 0' -isomorphism from D onto D' can be extended to a 0' -automorphism 
of C. In particular, every linear isomorphism from D onto D' can be extended 
to an automorphism of C. 
Also from the proof of Th. 1.7.1 we can derive a transitivity result, which 
will be used in the next chapter. First a definition. 
Definition 1.7.4 For A,JL E k with A ::! 0 and JL ::! 0 if char(k) ::! 2, and 
with JL ::! 0 (and A arbitrary) if char(k) = 2, we define a special (A, JL)-pair to 
be an ordered pair a, b with a, b E C satisfying: 
• if char(k)::! 2, then (a,e) = (b,e) = (a,b) = 0, 
N(a) = A, 
N(b) = JL; 
• if char(k) = 2, then (a,e) = 1, 
(b,e) = (a,b) = 0, 
N(a) = 
A, 
N(b) = JL. 
By a special pair we understand a special (l,l)-pair if char(k) ::! 2 and a 
special (O,l)-pair if char(k) = 2.

1. Composition Algebras 
Notice that every special (A, JI.)-pair a, b is contained in a unique quaternion 
subalgebra, which has e, a, b, ab as a basis, and that every quaternion subal-
gebra contains special (A, JI.)-pairs for suitable A and JI.. Now the transitivity 
result is: 
Corollary 1.7.5 For any two special (A,JI.)-pairs a,b and a',b' in a compo-
sition algebra C, there exists a linear automorphism cp of C with cp(a) = a' 
and cp(b) = b'. 
1.8 Split Composition Algebras 
With respect to the metric structure of a composition algebra there is an 
important dichotomy: either N is isotropic, i.e., there exist nonzero x E C 
with N(x) = 0, or N is anisotropic, i.e., N(x) i= 0 for all x E C, x i= O. 
Since xx = xx = N(x)e by Lemma 1.3.1, C has zero divisors in the first case, 
viz., all x i= 0 with N(x) = O. In the second case, every nonzero x E C has 
an inverse, viz., N(X)-lX (see Prop. 1.3.4); such a C is called a composition 
division algebra. 
We further examine the case that N is isotropic. First assume that 
char(k) i= 2. We want to find a E e.L with N(a) = -1. Pick any nonzero 
x with N(x) = O. If x E e.L, we pick a' E e.L with (a', x) = 1, then 
a = a' - (1 + N(a'))x does the job. If x rf. e.L, then we can write x = o:e + y 
with 0: i= 0 and y E e.L. Since 
0= N(x) = 0:2 + N(y), 
we find N(y) = _0:2. We can take a = o:-ly. 
The subspace ke $ ka is nonsingular and hence it is a composition sub-
algebra. Further, it is isotropic, since N(e + a) = O. By repeatedly applying 
the doubling procedure (cf. Prop. 1.5.1 and Th. 1.6.2) we find that the Witt 
index, i.e. the dimension of any maximal totally isotropic subspace, must be 
~ dimC. 
In case k has characteristic 2, we can reach the same conclusion by the 
following argument. First, we must find a E C with N(a) = 0 and (a, e) i= O. 
To this end we pick any nonzero x E C with N(x) = O. If (x,e) i= 0, we 
take a = x. If (x, e) = 0, then we further pick y E C with (y, e) i= 0 and 
(y,x) i= 0; if N(y) = 0, we take a = y, and if N(y) i= 0, then 
a = SyX = x - N(y)-l(x,y)y 
has the required properties. Now the subspace ke $ ka is a subalgebra by 
Lemma 1.6.1, and it is isotropic. As above we find that C has maximal Witt 
index, i.e., equal to ~ dimC. 
Two vector spaces of the same dimension over the same field with a non-
degenerate quadratic form of maximal Witt index are necessarily isometric. 

1.8 Split Composition Algebras 
19 
It follows from Th. 1.7.1 that any two composition algebras of the same di-
mension over the same field k which both have isotropic norm are isomorphic. 
We call these split composition algebras. Summing up our results, we have 
proved: 
Theorem 1.8.1 In each of the dimensions 2, 4 and 8 there is, up to iso-
morphism, exactly one split cqmposition algebra, i. e., composition algebra 
with isotropic norm, over any given field k. These are the only composition 
algebras containing zero divisors. 
The two-dimensional split composition algebra over k is k El1 k with 
N((~,'T))) = ~'T) (~,'T) E k). The four-dimensional one is the algebra of 2 x 2 
matrices over k with the determinant as norm, the split quaternion algebra. 
An easy computation shows that for a matrix 
we have (x, e) = tr(x), where e denotes the identity matrix, tr(x) is the trace 
of the matrix x, and 
x = ( _~~~ -~~~ ) . 
The split octonion algebra can be constructed from the split quaternion 
algebra D by the doubling process as in Prop. 1.5.3. We may take an arbitrary 
>. 1= 0 in this proposition, since all the resulting algebras are isomorphic. 
Choosing>. = 1, we get for the product 
(x, y)(u, v) = (xu + vy, vx + yu) 
(x,y,u,v E D) 
and for the norm 
N((x, y)) = det(x) - det(y) 
(X,YED). 
There is another description of split octonions over a field k, which uses vector 
matrices 
where k3 is the three-dimensional vector space over k. On k3 we have the 
nondegenerate bilinear form ( , ) defined by 
3 
(x,y) = L~i'T)i 
i=l 
and the exterior product 1\ defined by 
(x 1\ y, z) = det(x, y, z) 

20 
1. Composition Algebras 
Addition of vector matrices is defined entrywise, and multiplication by 
( ~ x) (e x') _ ( 
~e + (x, y' ) 
~x' + 1/' x + y 1\ y,) 
Y1/ 
y'1/' 
-
1/y'+ey+xl\x' 1/1/'+ (y,x') 
. 
The quadratic form N is defined by 
The bilinear form associated with N is obviously nondegenerate, and one 
easily verifies that N permits composition, using the identity 
(xl\x',yl\y') = (x,y)(x',y') - (x,y')(x',y) 
for the exterior product. Thus, the vector matrices form an eight-dimensional 
composition algebra, and since N is isotropic this must be the split octonion 
algebra. 
1.9 Center and Associating Elements 
By the center of a composition algebra C we understand {c E C I ex = 
xc for all x E C}. We determine the center of a quaternion or octonion al-
gebra, and also the elements in an octonion algebra that "associate" with all 
other elements. 
Proposition 1.9.1 The center of a quatemion or octonion algebra Cover 
k is ke. 
Proof. That the center of a quaternion algebra C is ke, is seen by extending 
k to an algebraic closure K. The norm N on CK = K ®k C is isotropic, so 
CK ~ M(2,K), which has center Ke. 
Let now C be an octonion algebra and z an element of its center. By 
Prop. 1.6.4, z is contained in a quaternion subalgebra D. Since z is central 
in D, it must lie in ke. 
0 
Thus, a quaternion algebra over k is a central simple associative algebra 
over k (see [Ja 80, § 4.6]). 
Proposition 1.9.2 Let C be an octonion algebra. If a E C satisfies 
(xy)a = x(ya) 
(x,y E C), 
(1.31) 
then a Eke. Condition (1.31) is equivalent to the condition (xa)y = x(ay) 
for all x, y E C, and also to (ax)y = a(xy) for all x, y E c. 

1.10 Classification over Special Fields 
21 
Proof. The latter statement is a consequence of the fact that the associator 
{x,y,z} = (xy)z - x(yz) is an alternating function, which we saw in § 1.4 
before Artin's Theorem 1.4.3. Let a satisfy (1.31). By Prop. 1.6.4 we can pick 
a quaternion subalgebra D which contains a. Write C = D EB Db with some 
bE DJ.., N(b) = -A # o. Taking x = ub (u E D) and y = b in (1.31), we get 
((ub)b)a = (ub)(ba). 
Write this out, repeatedly using formula (1.22) in which a is replaced by b: 
Aua = (ub)(ab) = Aau. 
This implies that ua = au for u E D, so a lies in the center of D, which is 
ke. 
0 
1.10 Classification over Special Fields 
Over some special fields k one can give a classification of quaternion and 
oct onion algebras; we will do this for algebraically closed fields, the reals, 
finite fields, complete, discretely valuated fields with finite residue fields, and 
for algebraic number fields. 
In a four- or eight-dimensional composition algebra C we choose a basis 
as in Cor. 1.6.3. If char(k) # 2, the norm N gets the form (in coordinates 
~o, ... ,6 or ~o, ... ,6, respectively): 
~5 + a~i + {3~~ + a{3~~ 
~5 + a~i + {3~~ + a{3d + 'Yd + a'Y~; + (3'Y~g + a{3'Y~? 
with nonzero constants a,{3 and 'Y. If char(k) = 2, we get for N: 
~5 + ~o6 + a~i + {3~~ + {3~26 + a{3~~ 
~5 + ~o6 + ad + {3d + {366 + a{3~~ + 
'Y~~ + 'Y~4~5 + a'Y~; + {3'Y~~ + {3'Y~66 + a{3'Y~? 
(1.32) 
(1.33) 
(1.34) 
(1.35) 
with nonzero constants a, {3 and 'Y. (Quadratic forms of these kinds are called 
twofold and threefold Pfister forms, respectively.) 
Since by Th. 1.7.1 the norm determines a composition algebra up to iso-
morphism, the classification of quaternion and octonion algebras boils down 
to the description of the equivalence classes of the above quadratic forms. We 
do this for some special fields. 
(i) k algebraically closed. 
Here all quadratic forms are isotropic, so there are only split composition 
algebras. 

22 
1. Composition Algebras 
(ii) k = JR., the field of the reals. 
It is easily seen that there are two classes of quadratic forms (1.32) and 
(1.33), respectively, viz., the isotropic ones and the positive definite ones. To 
the latter correspond the Hamiltonian quaternions and the Cayley numbers 
(real octonion division algebra), respectively. 
(iii) k a finite field. 
If k has characteristic ::I 2, every quadratic form in dimension> 2 is isotropic 
(see, e.g., [O'M, § 62)). In the characteristic 2 case, every element of k is a 
square, so a quadratic form as in (1.34) or (1.35) has a nontrivial zero, viz., 
with eo such that e6 = {3, 6 = 1 and all other ei = O. Hence there are only 
the split quaternion and octonion algebras. 
(iv) k a complete, discretely valuated field with finite residue class field. 
In this case all quadratic forms in dimension> 4 are isotropic (see [O'M, 
§ 63]), so there is only the split octonion algebra. In dimension 4 there is 
exactly one class of anisotropic quadratic forms, so there exists one isomor-
phism class of quaternion division algebras. 
(v) k an algebraic number field. 
For the classification of quadratic forms in this case one has to use Hasse's 
Theorem, which says that two quadratic forms over k are equivalent if and 
only if they are so over all local fields kv, where v runs over all places of k 
(see [O'M, § 66)). 
If dim C = 8, a form like (1.33) has maximal Witt index at all finite 
places, and also at all complex infinite places. So we have to look at the 
real places. Let r be the number of these places. At each of them we have 
two possibilities as we saw above in (ii), so according to Hasse's Theorem 
there are at most 2r octonion algebras over k. These can all be realized by a 
suitable choice of the signs of a, {3 and 'Y at the real places. For k = Q, the 
field of the rationals, we thus find exactly two octonion algebras, the split 
one and the division algebra. 
For the case dim C = 4, one needs, moreover, Hilbert's Quadratic Reci-
procity Law (see [O'M, § 71)). The result is as follows. If S is any finite 
set of an even number of finite or real places of k, then there is, up to iso-
morphism, exactly one quaternion algebra over k whose norm is anisotropic 
precisely at the places v E S. All quaternion algebras are obtained in this way. 
(vi) Let k be a field with the following property: for any quaternion alge-
bra Dover k its norm ND takes all values in k. Then any octonion algebra 
Cover k is split. For, constructing C by doubling as in § 1.5, one sees from 
(1.23) that the norm of C is isotropic, hence C is split (see § 1.8). 
Fields which have this property are the perfect fields with cohomological di-

mension ::; 2, see [Se 64, 5-e ed., p.98]. Examples of these are: finite fields 
(which have dimension 1), p-adic fields and totally imaginary algebraic num-
ber fields, see [loc.cit., p.90, p.96, p.97]. 
1.11 Historical Notes 
The four-dimensional division algebra of real quaternions was discovered by 
W.R. Hamilton in 1843, as a result of a vain search for a three-dimensional 
division algebra over the reals. Hamilton was interested in the latter for ge-
ometric reasons: he wanted to use these ''triplets'' to describe motions in 
three-space, just as complex numbers are used for this purpose in the plane. 
J.T. Graves (1843) and, independently, A. Cayley (1845) followed with the 
eight-dimensional nonassociative real division algebra of the octaves, or Cay-
ley numbers. We prefer the name octonions, of more recent date, in view of 
its analogy with "quaternions", and since "octave" already refers to other 
notions, in particular in music. 
Quaternions and octonions over the complex numbers followed soon, and 
in due course one became interested in quaternion and octonion algebras over 
arbitrary fields, possibly with zero divisors. In [Zo 31], M. Zorn studied them 
in the framework of alternative rings; from this paper stems the represen-
tation of the split oct onions by vector matrices. In [Zo 33]' Zorn gave the 
classification of octonion algebras over algebraic number fields, as in (v) of 
§ 1.10 above. 
A typical feature of quaternion and octonion algebras is the presence 
of a quadratic norm N (the square of the absolute value) which permits 
composition: N(xy) = N(x)N(y). The study of such forms goes back to GauE 
and culminated in Hurwitz's Theorem, which says that they can only exist 
in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8 (cf. Th. 1.6.2). N. Jacobson [Ja 58] placed all this 
in the framework of what he named composition algebras. He determined the 
structure of these algebras over fields of characteristic not two, a restriction 
removed by T.A. Springer in [Sp 63]. 
For more historical information about this subject, see [BI] and [Eb]. 

2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion 
Algebra 
In this chapter we study the group G = Aut( C) of automorphisms of an 
octonion algebra C over a field k. By "automorphism" we will in this chapter 
always understand a linear automorphism. Since automorphisms leave the 
norm invariant, Aut(C) is a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(N) of the 
norm of C. 
Let K be an algebraic closure of k and put CK = K ®k C. The auto-
morphism group G = Aut(CK) is a linear algebraic group in the sense of 
[Bor] , [Hu] and [Sp 81]; we refer to these books for the necessary background 
from the theory of algebraic groups. In the sequel we will, as a rule, denote 
algebraic groups by boldface letters. 
G is a closed subgroup of the algebraic group O(N) (the orthogonal group 
of the quadratic form on CK defined by N). We will prove in Th. 2.3.5 that 
G is a connected, simple algebraic group of type G2. 
We will prove in Prop. 2.4.6 that the algebraic group G is defined over 
k; from this it follows that the automorphism group G is the group G(k) of 
k-rational points of the algebraic group G. 
The results in this chapter are valid in any characteristic, though the 
characteristic two case sometimes requires a separate treatment. 
2.1 Automorphisms Leaving a Quaternion Subalgebra 
Invariant 
We begin by studying the automorphisms that map a given quaternion sub-
algebra D of C onto itself. Let t be such an automorphism. From t(D) = D 
it follows that t(Dl..) = Dl... As we did before, we write Dl.. = Da for a fixed 
a E Dl.. with N(a) #- 0; every element of C can then be written as x + ya 
with x, y E D. We have 
t(x + ya) = t(x) + t(y)t(a) 
with t(x), t(y) E D and t(a) E Dl.. = Da. We define mappings u, v : D -
D 
by 
t(x) = u(x) and t(y)t(a) = v(y)a 
(x,y ED). 
Hence 

26 
2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion Algebra 
t(x + ya) = u(x) + v(y)a 
(x,y ED). 
Clearly, u = tiD is an automorphism of D, and v is an orthogonal transfor-
mation. Writing out 
t((xa)w) = t(xa)t(w) 
(x,W E D) 
with the aid of (1.22), we find 
v(xw) = v(x)u(w) 
(x,W ED). 
Since u is an automorphism, u(w) = u(w). Hence, writing y for w, 
v(xy) = v(x)u(y) 
(x,y ED). 
Substituting x = e and defining p = v(e) we derive from this 
v(y) = pu(y) 
(y ED). 
Here p ED, and since v is an isometry, N (P) = 1. Thus we find for t: 
t(x + ya) = u(x) + (pu(y))a 
(x,y ED). 
(2.1) 
Conversely, for any p E D with N (p) = 1 and any automorphism u of D, 
equation (2.1) defines an automorphism t of C which leaves D invariant; this 
is easily verified using (1.22) and the associativity of D. 
Since the associative algebra D is central simple, every automorphism of 
D is inner by the Skolem-Noether Theorem (see, e.g., [ArNT, Cor. 7.2Dj or 
[Ja 80, § 4.6, Cor. to Th. 4.9]). Hence by (2.1) every automorphism of C that 
leaves D invariant can be written as 
t(x + ya) = cxc-1 + (pcyc-1)a 
(x,y ED) 
(2.2) 
with c E D, N(c) t- 0 and p E D, N(P) = 1. Here c is determined by t up to 
a nonzero scalar factor. 
2.2 Connectedness and Dimension of the Automorphism 
Group 
For a quaternion sub algebra D of C, denote by GD the algebraic group of 
K-automorphisms of CK that fix DK elementwise and by GD the group of 
k-automorphisms of C that fix D elementwise. Dl is the algebraic group 
of elements p E DK with N(p) = 1, and Dl = Dl n D. These are the 
norm one groups in D K and D, respectively. G D is a closed subgroup of the 
algebraic group G. The group Dl is isomorphic to the special linear group 
SL2 = SL2(K), since DK is isomorphic to the algebra of 2 x 2 matrices over 
K with det as norm. So Dl is a three-dimensional connected algebraic group. 

2.2 Connectedness and Dimension of the Automorphism Group 
27 
Proposition 2.2.1 There is an isomorphism of algebmic groups cp : G D -+ 
Dl which induces an isomorphism GD -+ Db such that for every t E GD, 
t(x + ya) = x + (cp(t)y)a 
Consequently, G D is 3-dimensional and connected. 
Proof. Use equation (2.1) with u = id and the associativity of D. 
0 
G is contained in the stabilizer of e in the orthogonal group O(N), which 
also leaves the orthogonal complement e.l in CK invariant. We will need 
that restriction of the stabilizer of e in SO(N) to e.l yields an isomorphism 
with the rotation group SO(Nd, where Nl is the restriction of N to e.l. 
In characteristic 1= 2 this is an almost trivial matter, but in characteristic 2 
there are complications due to the fact that then e E e.l. For the purposes 
of the present chapter we could do with less, but in the next chapter we will 
use the full isomorphism result. 
Let F be the stabilizer of e in O(N), and SF = F n SO(N). These are 
closed subgroups of O(N) and SO(N), respectively. We denote by F and 
SF the corresponding groups over k. If t E F, it leaves e.l invariant and its 
restriction to e.l is an element of the orthogonal group O(Nl). 
If char(k) = 2 the quadratic form Nl is degenerate. Then O(NI) and O(Nl) 
are defined to be groups of linear isometries of e.l, as in §1.1. In this case we 
put SO(Nl) = O(Nd, SO(Nt} = O(Nd· 
Proposition 2.2.2 The restriction homomorphism 
is an isomorphism of algebmic groups which induces an isomorphism SF -+ 
SO(Nl)· 
Proof. It is evident that (! is a homomorphism of algebraic groups. If char ( k) 1= 
2, define for u E SO(Nl) its extension c(u) to C by c(u)(e) = e. Clearly, 
c : SO(Nl) -+ SF is a homomorphism of algebraic groups and c = (!-l, so (! is 
an isomorphism of algebraic groups. The proposition follows. In characteristic 
2 the extension of u E O(N1) to an element of SF cannot be defined in this 
way: then e E e.l, whereas we have to define the image of a vector outside 
e.l. We will follow a different approach in this case. 
So let char(k) = 2. Note that in this case the restriction Nl is a quadratic 
form having defect 1, i.e. dim V.l = 1 (cf. [Che 54, § 1.2] or [Dieu, Ch. I, 
§ 16]). Every element of O(Nl) is a product of orthogonal transvections 
or reflections Sa, N(a) 1= 0 of the form (1.1) (see [Dieu, Ch. II, § 11]). The 
algebraic group O(Nt} is connected; this can be seen in the following manner. 
The restriction of the polynomial function N - 1 to e.l is irreducible (over 
the algebraic closure K), since otherwise Nl would be a square of a linear 
polynomial, which would vanish on a 6-dimensional subspace of e.l. It would 

28 
2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion Algebra 
follow that there were 6-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces with respect 
to the nondegenerate quadratic form N in C, which is impossible. Hence 
S = {x E el.I N(x) = I} (over K) is an irreducible variety. The morphism 
maps S onto an irreducible set of generators of O(N1) containing the iden-
tity, so O(Nt} is a connected algebraic group (see [Hu, § 7.5] or [Sp 81, 
Prop. 2.2.6]). 
The quadratic form N on C is nondegenerate, so here we have a rotation 
subgroup SO(N). Rotations are now orthogonal transformations with Dick-
son invariant 0; every rotation is a product of an even number of reflections 
(see [Dieu, Ch. II, § 10]). 
The restriction homomorphism 
is surjective, since every orthogonal transformation of el. leaves e invariant 
and can be written as a product of reflections Sa with a E el.. Its kernel 
has order 2, it is the subgroup generated by the reflection Se. This can be 
seen by using a symplectic basis el = e, ... , es of C as in (1.30); the ei 
with i :f. 5 form a basis of el.. Since Se is not a rotation, the restriction 
homomorphism SF -+ O(N1) is an isomorphism of abstract groups. Clearly, 
e is a homomorphism of algebraic groups. To show that it is an isomorphism 
of algebraic groups, it suffices by [Sp 81, Cor. 5.3.3], to prove that the Lie 
algebra homomorphism de : L(SF) -+ L(O(Nl)) is an isomorphism. The 
Lie algebra L(SF) is contained in the space S of the linear transformations 
t : C K -+ C K satisfying 
(x,tx) = 0 (x E CK) and te = O. 
To see this we work over the ring of dual numbers K[fJ, 102 = 0 (see [Bor, Ch. 
I, 3.20]). The elements of L(SF) are linear maps t of CK with te = 0 such 
that id + lOt, acting on x + lOy E K[f] ® C, satisfies 
N((id + lOt) (x + lOy)) = N(x + lOy). 
It follows that (x, tx) = O. Writing this out for the matrix (Qij ) of t with 
respect to the above symplectic basis, we find 43 independent equations: 
Qi,jH + Qj,iH = 0 
Qi,i+4 = 0 
Ql,j = 0 
(i :f. j, indices mod 8), 
(i:f. 1), 
(allj). 
So S has dimension 21. As L(SO(Nl)) also has dimension 21, we have S = 
L(SO(Nl))' The Lie algebra homomorphism de acts on the matrices ofL(SF) 

2.2 Connectedness and Dimension of the Automorphism Group

by deleting the fifth row and the fifth column. Since aj,S = a1,j+4 for j f= 1, 
as,j+4 = aj,l for j f= 1 and a1,1 = as,s = 0, de is injective and hence is an 
isomorphism. The last point is clear. 
0 
Proposition 2.2.3 The automorphism group G of CK is a connected alge-
bmic group of dimension 14. 
Proof. Consider the set of special pairs in CK (see Def. 1.7.4). Since K is 
algebraically closed, special pairs certainly exist. For any two special pairs 
there exists a linear isometry t of C K fixing e and mapping one pair to· the 
other, by Witt's Theorem; clearly, we may assume that t is a rotation. So the 
group SF operates transitively on the set of special pairs. 
Fix one special pair a, b with a, b E DK, a quaternion subalgebra of CK. 
The stabilizer H of a, b in SF is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group 
SO(N2 ) of a five-dimensional quadratic form N 2 , under the isomorphism 
e of SF with SO(Nt). If char(k) f= 2, this isomorphism is restriction to 
(KeEB Ka EB Kb).l; that this is an isomorphism of algebraic groups is seen as 
in the first paragraph of the proof of Prop. 2.2.2. If char(k) = 2, we restrict 
in two steps: first to (KeEBKa).l (same argument as in the characteristic f= 2 
case), from there to (KeEBKa).l nb.l = (KeEBKaEBKb).l (argument as in 
the characteristic 2 case in the proof of Prop. 2.2.2). 
The homogeneous space X = SF /H can be identified as a set with the 
set of all special pairs. Counting dimensions we find 
dim X = dim SF /H = dim SO(N1) - dim SO(N2 ) = 21 - 10 = 11. 
From Cor. 1.7.5 we infer that G operates transitively on the set of special 
pairs, i.e., on X. Since e, a, b and ab form a basis of DK, the stabilizer in 
G of the special pair a, b is G D. This implies that X S:! G /G D. SO another 
dimension count yields 
dimG = dim X + dimGD = 11 + 3 = 14. 
As a homogeneous space of a rotation group, X is an irreducible algebraic 
variety. Since GD is connected, it follows that G is connected (see [Sp 81, 
Ex. 5.5.9 (1)]). 
0 
The transitivity of G on special pairs implies transitivity on the set of 
quaternion subalgebras, so 
Corollary 2.2.4 The automorphism group G of CK acts tmnsitively on the 
set of quaternion subalgebms. 
(This also follows from Cor. 1.7.3, since over an algebraically closed field K 
all quaternion algebras are isomorphic to M2(K).) 
We remarked at the beginning of this chapter that G is contained in 
O(N). The connectedness of G implies that it must be contained in the

connected component of the identity in O(N), which is SO(N). This implies 
the following corollary. 
Corollary 2.2.5 The automorphism group G is a subgroup of the rotation 
group SO(N). 
2.3 The Automorphism Group is of Type G 2 
In this section we are going to further determine the structure of the algebraic 
group G. We view the split octonion algebra CK as an algebra of pairs (x, y) 
with x,y E DK, the algebra of 2 x 2 matrices over K, and with N((x,y)) = 
det(x) - det(y)j see § 1.8. We begin by describing a maximal torus in G. To 
this end we consider (2.2) for the particular case where c and p are diagonal 
matrices. We denote the 2 x 2 diagonal matrix diag(~, ~-l) with ~ E K* by 
c/(.. 
Lemma 2.3.1 The group T consisting of the automorphisms 
(2.3) 
with A, J.L E K*, is a 2-dimensional torus in G. Every element of G that 
commutes with all elements of T lies in T, so T is a maximal torus. Hence 
G has mnk 2. 
Proof. For a E Dl. we take (0, e) with e the 2 x 2 identity matrix. Notice that 
(x,O)a = (0, x). As a basis of CK we take 
(eu,O), (e12,O), (e2bO), (e22,0), (O,eu)' (O,e12), (O,e2d, (O,e22), 
where eij denotes the 2 x 2 matrix with (i, j)-entry equal to 1 and the other 
entries 0. The matrix of tA,,,, with respect to this basis is 
Observe that L A,_,.. = tA,,,,, so the obvious parametrization by A and J.L is 
not one-to-one. We can reparametrize via ~ = AJ.L and TJ = AJ.L-lj this gives 
an isomorphism of algebraic groups from (K*)2 onto T, viz., 
This shows that T is a 2-dimensional torus. 
We now prove that if t E G commutes with all tA,,.., then it lies in T. Any 
such t leaves the eigenspaces of every tA,,.. invariant. From (2.4) we see that 
these eigenspaces are 

2.3 The Automorphism Group is of Type G2 
31 
if we choose >., J.L E K* in such a way that t).,,,, has seven distinct eigenvalues. 
This implies that t must leave DK invariant, so it has the form given by (2.2): 
t : x + ya ~ cxc-1 + (pcyc-1)a 
with C,p E DK, det{c) = det(p) = 1. Since t has to leave the eigenspaces of 
every t).,1£ invariant, its restriction to DK , Le., the mapping 
has to leave K e12 and K e21 invariant. This implies that ce12 E K e12C and 
ce21 E K e21 c, so c = CL for some t E K*. In a similar way, the invariance of 
all K eij under the mapping 
implies that p is diagonal. Thus we have proved that t = t L,/(' for some t, K, E 
r.

It is easy now to determine the center of G. 
Lemma 2.3.2 The center of G consists of the identity only. 
Proof. Since a central element commutes with all elements of the maximal 
torus T, it must lie in T, so it has the form 
using the notation of the previous lemma. It must commute with all auto-
morphisms t that leave DK invariant, which by (2.2) have the form 
t: x + ya ~ cxc-1 + (pcyc-1)a (x,y E DK) 
with C,p E DK, N(p) = 1. This implies that t).,,,,IDK has to commute with all 
inner automorphisms of D K , the full 2 x 2 matrix algebra over K. This can 
only happen if >.2 = 1, so t).,,,,IDK = id. Since this holds for every quaternion 
subalgebra of CK and since every element of CK is contained in a quaternion 
subalgebra by Prop. 1.6.4, we conclude that t).,,,, = id.

In the next theorem, C may be an arbitrary composition algebra. In fact, 
the proof for octonion algebras uses the case of quaternion algebras, which 
we therefore have to settle first. 
Theorem 2.3.3 Let C be any composition algebm over k. The only non-
trivial invariant subspaces of CK under the action of Aut(CK) are Ke and 
e.L. 

32 
2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion Algebra 
Proof. If dim( CK) = 2, the result is trivial if K has characteristic i- 2. If 
char(K) = 2, we have Ke = e.L. Let a f/. Ke with (e,a) = 1; set N(a) = 0:. 
The element e+a satisfies the same conditions, so by Prop. 1.2.3 it satisfies the 
same minimum equation as a. It follows that there exists an automorphism 
which carries a to e + a, so a cannot span another invariant subspace. 
Next we deal with the case that CK is of dimension 4, so CK = M(2, K). 
Every automorphism of this algebra is inner by the Skolem-Noether Theorem 
(see § 2.1). Let V be an invariant subspace of CK and let t E M(2, K) be a 
diagonal matrix with distinct nonzero eigenvalues. Then the eigenspaces of 
the linear map x t-t txrl of M(2,K) are Ken + Ke22, Kel2, Ke2l (where 
the eij are as in the proof of Lemma 2.3.1). So V is spanned by vectors of 
the form o:en + (3e22 and mUltiples of el2 and e2l. 
If el2 E V then for all .x E K 
( 10) 
(10) 
(-.x 1) 
.x 1 el2 
-.x 1 
= 
_.x2.x 
lies in V, whence e2l E V, en - e22 E V. It follows that then V ::) e.L. 
If o:en + {3e22 E V and 0: i- (3 then similar arguments give that el2, e2l E V. 
So if el2 and e2l do not lie in V, we must have V = K e. This proves the 
Theorem for quaternion algebras. 
Finally, let CK be an octonion algebra over K. Consider any subspace 
V of C K that is invariant under Aut( C K), and any quaternion subalgebra 
Dl . Let Vl = V n Dl . Every automorphism of Dl can be extended to an 
automorphism of CK by Cor. 1.7.3. So Vl is invariant under Aut(Dl ), whence 
Vl = 0, K e, e.L n Dl or D l . Let D2 be another quaternion subalgebra of OK; 
call V n D2 = V2. By Cor. 2.2.4 there exists an automorphism cp of CK 
carrying Dl to D2. We must have cp(Vl ) = V2· Consequently, V2 = 0, Ke, 
e.L n D2 or D2 according to whether Vl = 0, Ke, e.L n Dl or Dl . Since by 
Prop. 1.6.4 every element of CK is contained in a quaternion subalgebra, it 
follows that V = 0, Ke, e.L or CK. 
0 
Focussing attention on octonion algebras again, we derive the following 
important corollary to the above theorem. 
Corollary 2.3.4 The automorphism group G of the octonion algebra CK 
over K has a faithful irreducible representation. 
Proof. If char(K) i- 2, the 7-dimensional representation of Gin e.L is faithful 
and irreducible. If char(K) = 2, this is not true anymore, since in that case 
K e is an invariant subspace contained in e.L. But then the representation of 
G in the 6-dimensional quotient space e.L / K e is irreducible, and it is not 
hard to verify that it is faithful. 
0 
We can now identify G. 
Theorem 2.3.5 The algebraic group G defined by an octonion algebra C is 
a connected, simple algebraic group of type G2. 

2.4 Derivations and the Lie Algebra of the Automorphism Group 
33 
Proof. We continue to work in the algebra CK over the algebraically closed 
field K. From Prop. 2.2.3 and Lemma 2.3.1 we know that G is a connected 
linear algebraic group of dimension 14 and rank 2. By the previous Corollary 
G has a faithful irreducible representation. This implies that G is reductive 
(see [Sp 81, Ex. 2.4.15]). As the center of G is trivial by Lemma 2.3.2, G 
is semisimple. From Prop. 2.2.3, Lemma 2.3.1 and [Sp 81, 8.1.3J we deduce 
that the two-dimensional root system of G has 12 elements. It then must be 
irreducible (the only reducible two-dimensional root system has 4 elements), 
and must be of type G2 (see [Sp 81, 9.1) or [Bour, p.276]). 
0 
In Prop. 2.4.6 we will see that k is a field of definition of the algebraic 
group G = Aut( C) if C is an octonion algebra over k. 
2.4 Derivations and the Lie Algebra of the 
Automorphism Group 
Let C be an algebra over k with identity element e. A derivation of C is a 
linear map of C such that 
d(xy) = x.d(y) + d(x).y (x, y E C). 
Taking x = y = e it follows that d( e) = o. If d, d' are derivations an easy 
check shows that their commutator 
[d, d') = dod' - d' 0 d 
is also one. It follows that the derivations of C form a Lie algebra Der( C) 
or Derk(C). Our aim is to prove that if C is an octonion algebra, DerK(C) 
is the Lie algebra L(G), where G is as in the previous section. (From this it 
will follow that G is defined over k, see Prop. 2.4.6). For more on derivations 
of octonion algebras see [Ja 71, §2). 
Let C be an arbitrary composition algebra. To deal with Der( C) we use 
the doubling process of § 1.5. Let D and a be as in [loc.cit.]. If d E Der(C) 
there are linear maps do and d1 of D such that for xED 
d(x) = do(x) + d1(x)a. 
Lemma 2.4.1 (i) do E Der(D). 
(ii) For X,y E D we have d1(xy) = d1(x)y + d1(y)x. 
Proof. This follows by a straightforward computation, using the multiplica-
tion rules (1.22) and the definition of a derivation. 
0 
If D is a two- or four-dimensional composition algebra denote by S the 
space of linear maps d1 of D with the property of part (ii) of the lemma. 

34 
2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion Algebra 
Lemma 2.4.2 dim S ::; 2 if dim D = 2 and dim S ::; 8 if dim D = 4. 
Proof. As in the case of derivations, we have d1 (e) = 0 for d1 E S. If dim D = 2 
this implies the stated inequality. If dim D = 4 then D is generated by two 
elements a,b (see Cor. 1.6.3), and d1 E S is completely determined by d1(a) 
and d1 (b). The inequality follows. 
0 
C and D being as before, denote by Dero(C) the space of derivations 
whose restriction to D is zero. 
Lemma 2.4.3 dimDero(C) ::; 1 (respectively, ::; 3) if dimC = 4 (respec-
tively, 8). 
Proof. Let d E Dero(C). Then d is determined by da. From the relations 
a2 = A, ax = xa (x E D) we deduce that 
(da)a + a(da) = 0, (da)x - x(da) = o. 
(2.5) 
Write da = b + ca. From the second relation we deduce that bx + xb = 0 for 
all xED. If dim D = 2 then D is commutative, and (x + x)b = (x, e)b = 0 
for all xED, whence b = o. If dim D = 4 then 
b(xy) = -(yx)b = -y(xb) = y(bx) = -(by)x = -b(yx). 
So b annihilates all elements of the form xy + yx. We can conclude that b = 0 
by producing an invertible element of this form, and it suffices to do this 
over the algebraic closure K. But then D is isomorphic to the algebra of 
2 x 2-matrices over K, and we may take x = e12, Y = e21. 
We have now shown that da = ca and from the first relation (2.5) we find 
that c + C = o. The lemma follows. 
0 
Lemma 2.4.4 Der( C) = 0 if C is two-dimensional and dim Der( C) ::; 3 
(respectively, ::; 14) if C has dimension 4 (respectively, 8). 
Proof. If dim C = 2, then C = k[a]. Using (1. 7) we find that if d is a derivation 
2a(da) - (a, e)da = O. 
If char k =I 2 we may assume that (a, e) = 0 and otherwise that (a, e) = 1. 
In both cases da = 0 and d = o. 
Now let dim C > 2. We use the doubling process. D being as before, it 
follows from Lemma 2.4.1 that we have an exact sequence 
0-+ Dero(C) -+ Der(C) -+ Der(D) EB S. 
Hence 
dimDer(C) ::; dim Dero(C) + dim Der(D) + dimS. 

2.5 Historical Notes 
35 
If dimC = 4 using Lemmas 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 we find that dim Der(C) ~ 3. (In 
fact we have equality since, as is easily seen, the derivation algebra contains 
the three-dimensional space of inner derivations x ....... ax - xa. But we are 
mainly interested in the octonion case.) If C is an octonion algebra the same 
argument gives the desired inequality. 
0 
We can now prove the results announced in the beginning. 
Proposition 2.4.5 Let C be an octonion algebra. Then dim Derk(C) = 14 
and DerK(C) is the Lie algebra olG. 
Proof. Since DerK(C) = K ®k Derk(C) and dimL(G) = dimG = 14 (see 
Th. 2.3.5) it suffices to prove the second point. Let V = End(CK®KCK, CK) 
be the space of K-linear maps of CK®KCK to CK. Denote by J.I. the multipli-
cation map x®y ....... xy. The algebraic group of automorphisms G = Aut(CK) 
is the stabilizer of J.I. in the algebraic group GL( CK), under the obvious action 
of GL(CK) on V, and the Lie algebra L(G) consists of derivations of CK (see 
[Hu, p.77]; one can also see this by working with the ring of dual numbers 
K[E], as before in the proof of Prop. 2.2.2). Since dim L(G) = dim G = 14 (by 
Prop. 2.2.3), it follows from Lemma 2.4.4 that we have the desired equality. 0 
As a consequence of the proposition we have: 
Proposition 2.4.6 Let C be an octonion algebra over k. Then the automor-
phism group G is defined over k. 
Proof. We use the notations of the previous proof. V(k) = Endk(C ®k C) is 
a k-structure on V in the sense of [Sp 81, §111, J.I. E V(k) and the algebraic 
group GL( CK ) is defined over k (by [loc.cit., 2.1.5]). Let <p : G -+ V be the 
morphism g ....... g.J.I.. It is defined over k. To prove that the stabilizer G is 
defined over k it suffices by [loc.cit, 12.1.2] to prove that the kernel of the 
differential d<pe has dimension 14. But this kernel is precisely Der( CK ), as 
follows from [Hu, p. 77]. An application of the previous Proposition proves 
the assertion.

2.5 Historical Notes 
E. Cartan remarked in rCa 141 that the compact real exceptional simple Lie 
group of type G2 can be realized as the automorphism group of the real 
octonions; see [Fr 51] for an explicit proof. A similar result for Lie algebras of 
type G2 over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero was proved independently 
by N. Jacobson [Ja 39] and E. Bannow (Mrs E. Witt) [Ba]. 
Generalization to groups over arbitrary base fields was a fairly obvious 
idea. L.E. Dickson defined analogs of the Lie group G2 over arbitrary fields -
without referring to octonion algebras - and proved simplicity over finite fields 

36 
2. The Automorphism Group of an Octonion Algebra 
as early as 1901, after he had dealt with the classical groups; see [Di 01aJ and 
[Di 05J. C. Chevalley refers to this work by Dickson in his Tohoku paper 
[Che 55J. In [Ja 58], Jacobson made an extensive study of the groups of au-
tomorphisms of octonion algebras over fields of characteristic not two, and 
proved they are simple if the algebra is split, so in particular over algebraically 
closed fields and over finite fields. 

3. Triality 
In this chapter we deal with algebraic triality in the group of similarities 
and in the orthogonal group O(N) of the norm N of an octonion algebra 
C, and with the related triality in the Lie algebras of these groups, usually 
called local triality. Geometric triality on the quadric N(x) = 0 in case N is 
isotropic will be left aside; the reader interested in the subject may consult 
[BlSp 60] and [Che 54, Ch. IV]. 
The results are proved here in all characteristics. In the existing literature, 
local triality has only been dealt with in characteristic not two. It turns out 
that for local triality in characteristic two one cannot use the Lie algebra 
L(SO(N)) of the orthogonal group, but has to pass to the Lie algebra of the 
group of similarities, which is one dimension higher, or to a subalgebra of 
L(SO(N)) of codimension one. The proof we give for the characteristic two 
case is different from that in the other cases. 
Algebraic triality defines two outer automorphisms of the projective simi-
larity group of N, which generate a group of outer automorphisms isomorphic 
to the symmetric group S3' Further, we derive a characterization of the au-
tomorphism group of C within the group of rotations that leave the identity 
element of C invariant (cf. Cor. 2.2.5). We use triality to give an explicit 
description of the spin group of the norm of C, and we describe the outer 
automorphisms induced by triality in this spin group. Finally, we prove that 
the corresponding algebraic group is defined over the base field of C. 
Bear in mind that C will always be an octonion algebra in this chapter. 
In the first section we present material related to quadratic forms that we 
need in the remainder of the chapter. 
3.1 Similarities. Clifford Algebras, Spin Groups and 
Spinor Norms 
Let N be a nondegenerate quadratic form on a vector space V (of finite 
dimension) over a field k. We recall from § 1.1 that a similarity of V with 
respect to N is a linear transformation t : V -
V such that 
N(t(x)) = n(t)N(x) 
(x E V) 

38 
3. Triality 
for some n(t) E k*, called the multiplier of t. Then (t(x), t(y) ) = n(t){ x, y) 
(x, y E V), so t is bijective. The similarities form a group GO(N) (or 
GO(N, V) if there is danger of confusion), called the similarity group of N, 
and n is a homomorphism GO(N) -
k*. The kernel of n is the orthogonal 
group O(N). 
If t is a similarity, so is )..t for)" E k*, and n()..t) = )..2n(t). Since we will 
often have to deal with similarities up to a nonzero scalar multiple, it is useful 
to introduce the homomorphism 
where k*2 denotes the subgroup of squares in k*. We call1l(t) the square class 
of the multiplier of t. 
Now consider the case that N is the norm of an octonion algebra C. The 
left multiplication La by an element a with N(a) =1= 0 is a similarity with 
n(la) = N(a), and so is the right multiplication ra. Any t E GO(N) can 
be written as t = lat' with a = t(e) and t' E O(N). It follows that every 
similarity is a product of a left mUltiplication and a number of reflections. 
Here we recall the convention of § 1.1 that for char(k) = 2 we understand by 
a reflection an orthogonal tmnsvection. 
The remainder of this section is devoted to a digression on Clifford alge-
bras, spin groups and the spinor norm. We will, to a large extent, only give 
an exposition of the definitions and results we need, referring to the literature 
for proofs: [Ar, Ch. V, § 4 and § 5], [Che 54, Ch. II], [Dieu, Ch. II, § 7 and 
§ 10], [Ja 80, § 4.8], [KMRT, § 8]. 
Consider again an arbitrary vector space V of finite dimension n over a 
field k with a nondegenerate quadratic form N. In the tensor algebra 
T(V) = k $ V $ (V ®k V) $ ... 
consider the two-sided ideal IN generated by the elements x ® x - N(x) 
(x E V). The Clifford algebm of N is the algebra CI(N) = T(V)/IN . (In the 
literature Clifford algebras are commonly denoted by a C, followed or not by 
something within parentheses. We use the notation CI to avoid confusion with 
the C denoting a composition algebra.) The canonical map of V, considered 
as a subspace of T(V), into CI(N) is injective; one identifies V with its image 
in CI(N). For x, y E CI(N) we denote their product in CI(N) by x 0 y, to 
avoid confusion with the product in C if CI(N) is the Clifford algebra of the 
norm N on an octonion algebra C. As an algebra, CI(N) is clearly generated 
by V, and one has the relations 
xo2 = N(x) and x 0 y + y 0 x = (x, y) 
(x,y E V), 
using the notation xo2 = x 0 x. It follows that every x E V with N(x) =1= 0 
has an inverse in CI(N), viz. xo- 1 = N(x)-lx. 
If el , e2, ... ,en is a basis of V, a basis of CI( N) is formed by the elements 

3.1 Similarities. Clifford Algebras, Spin Groups and Spinor Norms 
39 
so dim CI(N) = 2n. The elements x 0 y with x, y E V generate a subalgebra 
Cl+(N) of Cl(N), which has dimension 2n - 1 and which is called the even 
Clifford algebra of N. This even Clifford algebra can also be described as 
follows. Take the even tensor algebra 
The ideal rt = IN n T+(V) is generated by the elements x ® x - N(x) and 
u ® x ® x ® v - N(x)(u ® v) (u,v,x E V). Now CI+(N) = T+(V)/I~. 
The Clifford group of N is the group r(N) of invertible u E CI(N) such 
that u 0 V 0 uo - 1 = V. The even Clifford group is r+(N) = r(N) n CI+(N). 
For u E r(N), we define tu as the restriction to V of conjugation by u: 
tu : V -... V, X f-+ U 0 X 0 uo - 1. 
This is an orthogonal transformation of V, since 
N(uoxouO-1) =uoxouo-1ouoxouo- 1 =N(x). 
Clearly, tuov = tutv for u,v E r(N). If u E V with N(u) f 0, then we have 
for x E V, 
u 0 x 0 uo- 1 = N(U)-lU 0 X 0 U = 
N(u)-l( -x 0 uo2 + (x, u )u) = -x + N(u)-l( x, U )u, 
so u E r(N) and tu = -Suo Every rotation is an even product of reflections 
Sal Sa2 ... Sa2r' SO it is of the form tu with u = al 0 a2 0···0 a2r E r+(N), all 
ai E V, N(ai) f O. All elements of r+(N) are of this form, and u E r+(N) 
is determined up to a factor in k" by tu , since the intersection of the center 
of CI(N) with r+(N) is k*. In other words, there is an exact sequence 
1 -... k* -... r+(N) ~ SO(N) -... 1, 
(3.1) 
where X denotes the homomorphism u f-+ tu. 
The main involution L of CI(N) is the anti-automorphism of order 2 de-
fined by 
For u = al 0···0 a2r E r+(N), (ai E V, N(ai) f 0), define 
N(u) = u 0 L(U) = N(al)'" N(a2r) E k*. 
It is easily verified that N(u 0 u') = N(u)N(u') and N(>..u) = >..2 N(u). So 
N: r+(N) -... k*, u f-+ N(u), 

40 
3. Triality 
is a homomorphism. Its kernel is called the spin group Spin(N). Notice that 
the spin group is contained in the even Clifford algebra CI+(N). 
Since u E r+(N) is determined by tu up to a nonzero scalar factor, it 
makes sense to define the homomorphism 
a: SO(N) _ k* /k*2, tu I-t N(u)k*2. 
One calls a(t) the spinor norm of t E SO(N). If t = Sal··· Sa2r with all 
ai E V, N(ai) # 0, then a(t) = N(at}··· N(a2r)k*2. The kernel of a is 
the reduced orthogonal group O'(N). The homomorphism X of (3.1) maps 
Spin( N) onto 0' (N). 
Let us consider all these objects over the algebraic closure K of k. The 
vector space V with the quadratic form N is replaced by VK = K ®k V 
with the extension of N to VK, which we sometimes denote by NK. Clearly, 
CI(NK) = K ®k CI(N). The invertible elements of CI(NK) form an algebraic 
group, of which r(NK) is a closed subgroup. (From the fact that r(NK) is 
defined over k - though we will not prove that here - it follows that r(N) 
is the group of k-rational points of r(NK).) Similarly, we have the algebraic 
group r+ (N K ), a closed subgroup of r( N K ), and a closed subgroup Spin( N) 
of r+(NK). The exact sequence (3.1) (with k replaced by K) is an exact 
sequence of algebraic groups, and N: r+(NK) -
K* is a homomorphism of 
algebraic groups. Every rotation has spinor norm 1 over K since K* = K*2, 
so O'(N) coincides with SO(N) over an algebraically closed field. (Notice 
that, in general, O'(N) is not the group of rational points of an algebraic 
group.) 
The algebraic group Spin(N) is connected provided dim V 2: 2; we show 
this in a similar way as in the proof of Prop. 2.2.2 for SO (N). The polynomial 
function N - 1 on VK is irreducible, so S = {x E V I N(x) = 1} is an 
irreducible algebraic variety in V. The morphism 
S x S _ Spin(N), (x, y) I-t X 0 y, 
maps the irreducible variety S x S onto an irreducible set of generators of 
Spin(N) containing the identity, so this must indeed be a connected algebraic 
group (cf. [Hu, § 7.5J or [Sp 81, Prop. 2.2.6]). (If dim V = 1, then Spin(N) = 
{ ±1 }.) 
We have a homomorphism of algebraic groups 1f' : Spin(N) -
SO(N), 
where 1f' is the restriction of X to Spin(N) (so 1f'(al 0 a2 0 ... 0 a2r) = 
Sal Sa2 ... Sa2J, where Spin(N) is the simply connected covering group of 
SO(N) (cf. [Sp 81, 10.1.4]). The homomorphism 1f' is a separable isogeny 
with kernel of order 2 if char(K) # 2; if char(K) = 2, 1f' is an inseparable 
isogeny with kernel {1 }. We will discuss this in detail for the case that N is 
the norm on an octonion algebra C, though in fact the argument will work 
for the general case. We assume that k = K is algebraically closed. Then N 
is the unique (up to equivalence) form of maximal Witt index in dimension 
8. We denote the corresponding spin group by Spin(8), etc. 

3.1 Similarities. Clifford Algebras, Spin Groups and Spinor Norms 
41 
We have to determine explicitly the Lie algebra L(Spin(8» of Spin(8). 
To this end we introduce again the ring of dual numbers K[e] (as in the 
proof of Prop. 2.2.2), extend N to a quadratic form on e[e] = K[e] ® K e and 
consider the corresponding Clifford algebra K[e] ®K Cl(N). The Lie algebra 
of r+ (N K) consists of elements U E Cl+ (N K) such that 
(1 + eU) 0 e[e] 0 (1 + eut- l ~ e[e], 
that is, 
(1 + eu) 0 (x + ey) 0 (1 + eut-l E e[e] 
Since (1 + eu)o-l = 1 - eU, this leads to 
x + ey + e(U 0 x - x 0 u) E e[e] 
Since x + ey E e[e], we get the condition 
(X,yEe). 
(X,yEe).

(x E e). 
(3.2) 
Now first let char(K) 1= 2. Choose an orthonormal basis el, ... , es of e, write 
x as a linear combination of these and U = Lt=o L Qil ... i2! eil o· .. oei2!' where 
the second sum is taken over all sequences i l , ... , i21 with 0 ~ i l < ... < i21 ~ 
8. One easily sees that (3.2) holds if and only if U = Qo + Li<j Qijei oej. Since 
Spin(8) consists of the z E r+(NK) with ZOt(z) = 1, we need for L(Spin(8)) 
the extra condition (1 + eu) 0 t(1 + eu) = 1, which yields U + t(u) = O. Since 
u + t(u) = 2Qo, we get Qo = 0, so L(Spin(8» is contained in the space S 
of the elements u = Li<j Qijei 0 ej. Since dimS = 28 = dimL(Spin(8)), 
we have L(Spin(8) = S. The Lie action of u on e, x 1--+ u 0 X - X 0 u, has 
matrix ( 'Yij )l<i "<s with 'Yii = 0, 'Yij = 2Qij for i < j and 'Yji = -2Qij for 
_ ,3_ 
i < j. So we see that d1r : L(Spin(8)) -+ L(SO(8)) is an isomorphism if 
the characteristic 1= 2, which means that 7r is a separable isogeny (cf. [Sp 81, 
Th. 4.3.7]). 
In the case char ( K) = 2 we have to use a symplectic basis el, ... ,es for e 
(cf. (1.30». Proceeding as above we find again that the elements u that satisfy 
condition (3.2) are those of the form u = Qo + Li<j Qijei 0 ej. In this case, 
writing out the extra condition u + t(u) = 0 for the elements u E L(Spin(8)) 
yields 
4 L Qi,H4 = O.

The Lie action of u = Qo + Li<j Qijei 0 ej satisfying (3.3) on eK, x

'Yi,j+4 = 'Yj,H4 = Qij 
(1 ~ i < j ~ 4), 
'YH4,j = 'Yj+4,i = Qi+4,j+4 
(1 ~ i < j ~ 4).

3. Triality 
It follows that the kernel of d7f is K (considered as a subspace of Cl(NK ». 
Its image is a 27-dimensional sub algebra of the 28-dimensional Lie algebra 
L(SO(8)), because of condition (3.3). Thus we see that 7f is an inseparable 
isogeny if char(K) = 2 (cf. [Sp 81, § 9.6]). 
3.2 The Principle of Triality 
The following theorem is the central result of this chapter. 
Theorem 3.2.1 (Principle of Triality) Let 0 be an octonion algebra over 
a field k, with norm N. 
(i) The elements t1 E GO(N) such that there exist t2, t3 E GO(N) with 
(x,y E 0) 
(3.4) 
form a normal subgroup SGO(N) of index 2, called the special similarity 
group. If (tt,t2,t3) and (t~,t~,t3) satisfy (3.4), then so do (t1t~,t2t~,t3t3) 
and (tl1,t2\t3"1). 
(ii) Ift1 E GO(N), then there exist t2, t3 E GO(N) such that 
(x,y EO) 
(3.5) 
if and only if it ¢ SGO(N). 
(iii) The elements t2 and t3 in (3.4) and in (3.5) are uniquely determined 
by t1 up to scalar factors A and A -1 in k*, respectively. For t1 = la, the 
similarities t2 = lara and h = la-1 = N(a)-1la satisfy (3.4), and similarly 
with t1 = ra, t2 = ra-l = N(a)-lra, t3 = lara; for t1 = Sa, (3.5) is satisfied 
by t2 : y 1---+ -N(a)-lay, and t3 : x 1---+ xa; for t1 = SaSb we can take 
t2 = N(a)-llal/j and t3 = N(b)-lrar/j to satisfy (3.4). Ift1 E SGO(N), then 
so are hand t3. 
(iv) Iftt,t2,t3 are as in (3.4) or (3.5), then n(tt) = n(t2)n(t3)' 
(v) Let t E GO(N); it is a product of a left multiplication by an invertible 
element of 0 and an orthogonal transformation t'. Then t E SGO( N) if and 
only if t' is a rotation. 
(vi) If tl, t2, t3 are bijective linear transformations of 0 that satisfy (3.4) or 
(3.5), then they are necessarily similarities with respect to N. 
Proof. Call t1 E GO(N) even or odd if there exist t2, t3 E GO(N) such that 
(3.4) or (3.5) holds, respectively. 
(a) If two triples (t1, t2, t3) and (t~ A, t3) of invertible linear transformations 
satisfy (3.4), then so does their product (ttt~, t2t~, t3t3)' since 
If the first triple satisfies (3.4) and the second one (3.5), then their product 
satisfies (3.5). If the first triple satisfies (3.5) and the second one (3.4), then 

3.2 The Principle of Triality 
43 
(tlt~, t2ta, t3t~) satisfies (3.5), and this last triple satisfies (3.4) if both initial 
triples satisfy (3.5). Finally, if (tb t2, t3) satisfies (3.4), then the same is true 
for (til, t2"l, tal). For, substituting in (3.4) t2"l(X) for x and tal(y) for y 
yields 
from which we infer 
(x,y E C). 
So the product of two even or two odd similarities is even and that of an even 
and an odd similarity is odd, while the inverse of an even similarity is even. 
(b) We show now that a similarity cannot be both even and odd. For assume 
that (tl, t2, t3) satisfies (3.4) and at the same time (tl' t~, ta) satisfies (3.5). 
Then, by the results of (a), (id, U2, U3) with U2 = t~tal and U3 = tat2"l would 
satisfy (3.5). Thus, 
(x,y E C). 
Taking y = e we get x = u2(e)u3(x), so U3 = La with a = u2(e)-1; taking 
x = e we get U2 = Tb with b = u3(e)-1. Thus, 
xy = (yb)(ax) 
(x,y E C). 
For x = y = e this yields e = ba, so b = a -1. If we take y = a, we get 
xa = ax 
(x E C). 
This means that a belongs to the center of C, so a = Ae for some A E k by 
Prop. 1.9.1, and b = A-Ie. Thus we arrive at the relation 
xy = yx 
(x,y E C). 
Since C is not commutative, we have a contradiction. 
(c) Every similarity is a product of a left multiplication by an invertible 
element and a number of reflections, so to show that we have either (3.4) or 
(3.5), it suffices by (a) to consider the cases tl = La and tt = Sa for a E C 
with N(a) =I o. 
For tl = La we deduce from the second Moufang identity (1.14) that 
a(xy) = (axa)(a-Iy) 
(x,y E C). 
Hence if we take t2 = laTa and t3 = la-l, then (tl,t2,t3) satisfies (3.4). If we 
conjugate the above relation and then replace a by a, y by x and x by y, we 
get 
(xy)a = (xa-l)(aya) 
(X,yEC), 

44 
3. Triality 
Next consider a reflection Sa : X f--+ X - N(a)-l(x,a)a. Since (x,a)e = 
xii + ax, 
Sa(x) = X - X - N(a)-laxa = -N(a)-laxa. 
Using the first Moufang identity (1.13) we get: 
sa(xy) = -N(a)-la(yx)a 
= -N(a)-l(ay)(xa) 
(x,y E C), 
so if we take tl = Sa, t2 : y f--+ -N(a)-lay, and t3 : x f--+ xa, we have a triple 
of similarities which satisfies (3.5). 
Combining this with the results of (a) and (b), we find the statements 
(i), (ii) and (v) of the Theorem and the statements in the second and third 
sentence of (iii). The normality of SGO(N) in GO(N) follows from the fact 
that it has index 2. The relation in (iv) is easily proved by taking norms on 
both sides of (3.4) and (3.5). 
(d) We now prove the uniqueness of t2, t3 up to a scalar factor. Assume 
(tl , t2, t3) and (tl , tz, t3) both satisfy (3.4), then with Ui = tilt~ (i = 1,2) we 
have by (a), 
(x,y E C). 
Taking y = e we find x = U2(x)u3(e), so U2 = ra with a = u3(e)-1, and 
similarly U3 = lb with b = u2(e)-1. Hence 
xy = (xa)(by) 
(x,y E C). 
Substitution of x = y = e yields ab = e, so b = a-I. Replacing y by ay we 
find 
x(ay) = (xa)y 
(x,y E C). 
By Prop. 1.9.2, a = Ae for some A E k, so b = A-Ie. This implies that tz = At2 
and t3 = A-It3. 
Now let (tl' t2, t3) satisfy (3.5). Define similarities Ui by Ui(X) = ti(X). 
Then (Ul, U2, U3) satisfies (3.4). The uniqueness of U2 and U3 up to factors A 
and A-I, respectively, implies the same for t2 and t3. 
(e) To prove (vi), finally, consider arbitrary bijective linear transformations 
h, t2, t3 of C that satisfy (3.4). Taking y = e in (3.4), we get 
(x E C). 
As h is bijective, there exists x E C such that N(tl(X)) i= 0; since N(tl(X)) = 
N(t2(X))N(t3(e)), we see that N(t3(e)) i= 0, so t3(e) is invertible. Hence 
t2 = ratl with a = t3(e)-I. By substituting x = e in (3.4), we find in a 
similar way that t3 = lbtl with b = t2(e)-I. We can now rewrite (3.4) in the 
following form: 
(x,y E C). 
(3.6) 

3.3 Outer Automorphisms Defined by Triality 
45 
From h(e) = t2(e)t3(e) it follows that t1(e) is invertible. Set c = h(e)-l. 
The similarity t~ = Ie can be completed to a triple of similarities (t~, t~, t~) 
satisfying (3.4) as we saw in (c) above. Then the product triple (t~t1' t~t2' t~t3) 
also satisfies (3.4) as we saw in (a). Now t~t1(e) = letl(e) = e, so for the 
proof of (vi) we may as well assume that tl(e) = e. Taking x = y = e in 
(3.6), we find ab = e. Taking norms of both sides of (3.6), we get, since 
N(a)N(b) = N(e) = 1, 
N(tl(XY)) = N(tl(X))N(tl(Y))· 
This means that the nondegenerate quadratic form N on C defined by N(x) = 
N(h(x)) (x E C) permits composition. This implies by Cor. 1.2.4 that N = 
N, so tl is orthogonal. Then t2 and t3 must be similarities, since each of them 
is a product of h and a similarity. 
A similar proof shows that bijective linear transformations t 1 , t 2 , t3 that 
satisfy (3.5) must be similarities. 
0 
The elements of SGO(N) are called proper similarities, the other simi-
larities improper. For h E GO(N) we fix the notation t2 and t3 by the rule 
that the triple (tt, t2, t3) satisfies either (3.4) or (3.5); such a triple (tl, t2, t3) 
is said to be related. Bear in mind that t2 and t3 are determined by tl up to 
factors A and A -1, respectively. Equation (3.4) is called the first form of trial-
ity and (3.5) the second form of triality. Consider a related triple (tl, t2, t3); 
if h E SO(N), it satisfies the first form of triality, and hence t2, t3 E SGO(N). 
With the aid of the spinor norm we can determine when we can take hand 
t3 to be orthogonal. 
Proposition 3.2.2 For h E SO(N), the similarities t2 and t3 such that 
(tl' t2, t3) satisfies (3.4) have square class of multiplier lI(ti) = 0"(t1). Hence 
t2 and t3 can be taken to be orthogonal if and only if O"(tt} = 1; in that case 
they are both rotations. 
Proof. The equality lI(ti) = O"(tl) follows from the case t1 = SaSb in (iii) of 
Th. 3.2.1. We have also seen there that t2, t3 E SGO(N), so if we take them 
to be orthogonal, they are rotations by (v) of the same theorem. 
0 
Remark 3.2.3 If k* = k*2, which is for instance the case if k is algebraically 
closed, every rotation has spinor norm 1. Then for every h E SO(N) one can 
find t2, t3 E SO(N), unique up to a common factor ±1, such that (tt, t2, t3) 
satisfies the first form of triality (3.4), so the Principle of Triality holds in this 
form for SO(N) over algebraically closed fields, more generally over fields in 
which every element is a square. 
3.3 Outer Automorphisms Defined by Triality 
For t E GO(N) we define i E GO(N) by 
i(x) = n(t)-lt(x) 
(x E C). 

46 
3. Triality 
Lemma 3.3.1 For t E GO(N) we have n(t) = n(t)-l and 
(x E C, N(x) :I 0). 
Further, 
tv' = iu 
and 
i = t, 
so t 1---+ £ is an involutory automorphism of GO(N). 
Proof. Easy verifications. 
o 
Lemma 3.3.2 Lett1.t2,t3 E SGO(N). If(tt,t2,t3) satisfies the first form of 
triality, then so do (t2' t1. i3), (t3, i2, tt), (iI, i3, i2), (i2,t3, it) and (i3, i1. t2)' 
Proof. From 
we infer for N (y) :I 0, 
Hence 
(x,y E C, N(y) t- 0). 
Working over K, we obtain a polynomial equality which is valid on a Zariski 
open subset of CK x CK. It must hold for all x, y E CK and in particular for 
x, y E C. So (t2' t l , i3) is a related triple. In a similar way one proves that 
(t3, £2, tt) is related. 
Thus, if we interchange in a related triple satisfying the first form of 
triality the first and the second (or the third) component and replace the 
remaining component t by £, we get another related triple satisfying the first 
form of triality. Applying this operation a few times in a suitable way, we get 
the other three related triples.

Corollary 3.3.3 1ft is a rotation, then a(t) = aCt). Iftl is a rotation with 
a(tl) = 1 and (tl, t2, t3) is a related triple of rotations, then a(t2) = a(t3) = 
1. 
Proof. If t is a rotation, then i(x) = t(x); since conjugation is the negative of 
the reflection Se, i is a rotation with the same spinor norm as t. The second 
statement follows by combining the above lemma with Prop. 3.2.2.

In dealing with similarities of the octonion algebra C up to a scalar fac-
tor, it is natural to interpret them as transformations of the set P(C)(k) of k-
rational points of the seven-dimensional projective space P( C) = (C\ { 0 }) / K* . 
These transformations form the projective similarity group PGO(N) = 

3.3 Outer Automorphisms Defined by Triality 
47 
GO(N)jk*. The image of SGO(N) in PGO(N) under the natural projec-
tion is the projective special similarity group PSGO(N) = SGO(N)jk*. For 
t E GO(N), we identify its image tk* in PGO(N) with the projective transfor-
mation it induces in IP'(G), and we denote both by It]. Every [t1] E PSGO(N) 
uniquely determines [t2]' [t3] E PSGO(N) such that (t1, t2, t3) is a related 
triple. 
Proposition 3.3.4 The mappings a,f3,e: PSGO(N) -+ PSGO(N), 
a : [tt]1-+ [t2], 
f3 : [t1] 1-+ [i3] , 
e : [t]1-+ Ii], 
are automorphisms of PSGO(N). The automorphisms a and f3 generate a 
group S of outer automorphisms of PSGO(N), which contains e, and which 
is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3. 
Proof. That a and f3 are homomorphisms follows from part (i) of Th. 3.2.1 
and Lemma 3.3.1, and their bijectivity follows from Lemma 3.3.2. 
From Lemma 3.3.2 it also follows that 
and 
f3 : 
[tt]1-+ [i3] 1-+ [i2] 1-+ [t1], 
[t2] 1-+ [t3] 1-+ [i1] 1-+ [t2]. 
This implies e = af3. Further one derives the relations 
2 -
f33 - ( (3)2 - 1 
a -
-
a 
-, 
denoting by 1 the identity automorphism. These are the defining relations 
for the symmetric group S3, if one takes as generators (12) and (123). So 
there exists a homomorphism 
T : S3 -+ S, (12) 1-+ a and (123) 1-+ f3. 
The only nontrivial normal subgroup of S3 is the alternating group A3. Since 
(123) E A3 is not mapped onto 1 by T, we see that T must be an isomorphism. 
There remains the proof that all elements -# 1 of S are outer automor-
phisms. Let A be the quotient of the group of automorphisms of PSGO( N) 
by the group of inner automorphisms. We have to show that the homomor-
phism S3 -+ A induced by T is injective. If not, its kernel would contain the 
alternating group A3 , and f3 would be an inner automorphism. If this were 
the case, there would exist u E SGO(N) such that 
(t1 E SGO(N)). 
If t1 = la, then f3([t1]) = [i3] with t3 = N(a)-lla by Th. 3.2.1 (iii). Writing 
this out we see that for each a E G with N(a) -# 0 there is Aa E k such that 

48 
3. Triality 
N(a)u(ax) = Aau(x)a 
Taking x = u- 1(a- 1) we find 
(x E C). 
(a E C, N(a) i= 0). 
Taking norms of both sides of (3.7) we get 
N(a)2n(u)N(a) = A~n(u)N(a), 
(3.7) 
(3.8) 
from which we infer A~ = N(a)2, so Aa = ±N(a) for a E C, N(a) i= o. We may 
assume that k is algebraically closed. Since a 1--+ Aa is a polynomial function 
on C by (3.8) and since Ae = 1, we must have Aa = N(a) if N(a) i= O. By 
Zariski continuity this must hold for all a E C. Using Prop. 1.9.2 we conclude 
that e E k* e. Consequently, f3 = Inn( u) = id, which is a contradiction. 
0 
Remark 3.3.5 Since c E S, it is an outer automorphism of PSGO(N). One 
can extend c to an automorphism ttl 1--+ til of PGO(N), which is an inner 
automorphism since in GO(N) we have 
i = n(t)-lcte-1, 
where e is the similarity x 1--+ x. Notice that e satisfies (3.5), the second form 
of triality, so c f/. SGO(N). Since c is an outer automorphism of PSGO(N), 
we have [e] f/. PSGO(N), so PSGO(N) i= PGO(N). 
3.4 Automorphism Group and Rotation Group of an 
Octonion Algebra 
Let C be an octonion algebra over k. We saw in § 2.2 that the algebraic 
group G is a closed subgroup of the stabilizer SF of e in SO(N), which 
also leaves el. invariant, and that restriction of elements of SF to el. defines 
an isomorphism e of SF onto SO(N1); see Prop. 2.2.2. We will henceforth 
identify the elements of SF with their e-images in SO(N1), and conversely 
identify every t E SO(N1) with its extension e-1(t) to a rotation fixing e. 
Thus, we have identified G with a closed subgroup of SO(Nt). Similarly, we 
identify G = Aut(C) with a subgroup of SO(N1)' 
For x, y E C, both i= 0, we denote k*x E JP>(C)(k) by [x], and sometimes 
write [x].[y] for [xy]. For t1 E SO(N1) there exist similarities t2, ta, unique 
up to scalar factors A and A -1, respectively, such that (t1' t2, ta) satisfies the 
first form of triality (3.4). We define a mapping ..1 from SO(Nt) to JP>(C)(k) 
by 
..1 : SO(N1) -+ JP>(C)(k), t1 1--+ [t2(e)]. 
By Lemma 3.3.2, (t2' t1, ia) also satisfies the first form oftriality. This implies 
ia(e) = t2(e) since t1(e) = e. Using all this, we find for the map ..1: 

3.4 Automorphism Group and Rotation Group of an Octonion Algebra 
49 
Thus, 
L1(tu) = [t](L1(u)).L1(t) 
(t, u E SO(NI)). 
If tl E Aut(C), then tl = t2 = t3, so L1(tl) = [e]. This necessary condition is 
also sufficient as we see in the following proposition. 
Proposition 3.4.1 For t E SO(Nl) we have t E Aut(C) if and only if 
L1(t) = [e]. 
Proof. It remains only to prove the "if" part. If h E SO(Nl) and L1(tl) = [e], 
we may assume t2(e) = e. From (3.4) with x = e it follows that tl(Y) = t3(Y) 
for all y. Then t3(e) = tl(e) = e, hence taking y = e in (3.4) yields that 
tl(X) = t2(X) for all x. Thus we have found that tl = t2 = t3, which means 
that tl E Aut(C). 
0 
If h E SO(NI), t2(e) has nonzero norm. We claim that every element of 
C with nonzero norm can be obtained in this way. 
Lemma 3.4.2 For every c E C with N(c) :f:. 0 there exists tl E SO(NI) such 
thath(e) =c. 
Proof. We try tl = SaSb with a, bE e.L. Then h(e) = e, so tl E SO(Nl). Pick 
any a E C with (a, e) = (a, c) = 0 and N( a) =f O. Take b = Aac with A E k* 
still to be chosen. Then N(b) :f:. 0 and 
(b,e) = A(ac,e) = A(c,a) = -A(c,a) = o. 
By Th. 3.2.1 (iii), we can take t2 = laIr,. Then 
t2(e) = ab = -ab = -Aaac = Aaac = AN(a)c. 
So if we take A = N(a)-l, we have t2(e) = c as desired. 
o 
We define an action T of SO(Nl) in J1D(C)(k) by T(t) = a([tJ) with a as 
in Prop. 3.3.4, so T(h) = [t2]. If T(t) = lid], then [t] = lid] since a is an 
automorphism; this implies that t = id since t E SO(Nl). Thus, T is faithful. 
For k = K we have obtained an action of SO(NI) on IP'(C). Consider in J1D(C) 
the Zariski open subset 
0= { [c] I N(c) :f:. O}. 
It is the complement of a projective quadric which is defined over k. 
Lemma 3.4.2 shows that T(SO(Nl)) operates transitively on the set O(k) 
of k-rational points of O. According to Prop. 3.4.1, t E SO(Nl) is an auto-
morphism of C if and only if T(t) fixes [e], so G = Aut(C) is the stabilizer 
of [e]. Working over K we see that T induces a bijective morphism T of al-
gebraic varieties from the homogeneous space SO(Nl)/G onto O. Counting 
dimensions yields 

50 
3. Triality 
dimSO(N1)/G = 21 - dimG = dim 0 = dimlP'(C) = 7 
(use [Sp 81, Th. 5.1.6]), from which we derive again that dimG = 14. By 
Prop. 2.4.6 we know that G is defined over k. 
The group SO(N1) is the rotation group of a 7-dimensional quadratic 
form, it is a quasisimple algebraic group of type B3 (see [Sp 81, 17.2.1 and 
17.2.2]) and G is a closed algebraic subgroup which is an exceptional simple 
group of type G2 • We have found a bijective morphism r of SO(N1)/G 
onto a Zariski open subset 0 of the 7-dimensional projective space lP'(C), 
which induces a bijection between SO(Nl)/G(k) and O(k) s;:; lP'(C) (k). If 
the norm N is anisotropic, Le., if C is an octonion division algebra, then 
O(k) = lP'(C)(k). 
The bijective morphism r : SO(N1)/G ~ 0 is even an isomorphism of 
algebraic varieties. According to [Sp 81, 5.3.2] it suffices to show that the 
tangent map (dr)e is surjective. To prove this, we consider the map 
..:1 : SO(Nd ~ 0, t I-> T(t)[e]. 
The surjectivity of (dr)e will follow if we can show that (d..:1)e is surjective. 
Pick a E e..L, N(a) = 1. The map 
((e..L\{ o})/ K*) n 0 ~ ((ae..L\{ o})/ K*) n 0, [x] I-> [ax] = [ax], 
is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties which factors through ..:1, for 
(x E e..L\{O}, N(x) i= 0). 
The image of (d..:1)e must therefore contain ae..L, which we can identify with 
the tangent space to 0 at [a]. This shows that dre is surjective.

3.5 Local Triality 
If k = K is an algebraically closed field, the Principle of Triality holds already 
for the algebraic group SO(N), as we noticed in Rem. 3.2.3. It has an analog 
in the Lie algebra L(SO(N)) of this algebraic group, the Principle of Local 
Triality, at least in characteristic not two. 
In characteristic two the situation is more complicated. In the first in-
stance we have to work in the Lie algebra L(SGO(N)) of the special similar-
ity group, or in the quotient by its one-dimensional center. For local triality 
in the Lie algebra L(SO(N)) in characteristic two we have to restrict to a 
subalgebra M thereof which has codimension 1; in the next section we will 
see that M is the commutator subalgebra of L(SO(N)). 
Before we formulate and prove local triality, we have to discuss the Lie 
algebras involved here and, in particular, to find suitable generators for them. 

3.5 Local Triality

The similarity group GO(N) is the algebraic group consisting of the in-
vertible linear transformations t which satisfy the equations 
N(t(x)) = N(t(e))N(x) 
Notice that for a similarity t with respect to the norm N on C the multiplier 
n(t) equals N(t(e)) (cf. § 3.1). ,The special similarity group SGO(N) is the 
identity component of GO(N). We denote its Lie algebra by Lo. To find 
it one can use the ring of dual numbers K[c:J. The method of the proof of 
Prop. 2.2.2 gives that Lo consists of the linear maps t of CK satisfying the 
condition 
(x,t(x)) = (.e,t(e))N(x) 
We denote by Lo the Lie algebra of linear maps t of C satisfying the same 
condition. Such a t is called a local similarity, and the factor (e, t(e)) its local 
multiplier. Examples of local similarities are the left and right multiplications 
le and re for c E C, because by (1.3) 
(x,cx) = (e,c)N(x), 
and similarly for the right multiplications. 
The subalgebra L1 = L(SO(N)) is given by the equations 
(x,t(x)) = 0 
The similarly defined subalgebra of Lo is L1. It consists of the alternating 
linear transformations. These are also skew symmetric: 
(t(x),y) + (x,t(y)) = 0 
(x,y E C). 
Examples of alternating transformations are 
ta,b : C -t C, X f-+ (x, a)b - (x, b )a, 
with a, b E C; further, the La with (a, e) = 0, the ra with (a, e) = 0, the 
me = le - re for all c E C, and finally the lalb -lbla and rarb - rbra for all 
a, bE C, as one easily verifies. 
Lemma 3.5.1 If tt and t2 are local similarities of C, then their Lie com-
mutator [tl. t2J = t1t2 - t2t1 is alternating. 
Proof. Let tt and t2 have local multipliers).1 and ).2, respectively. The relation 
(x E C) 
leads to 

52 
3. Triality 
(x E C). 
After cancelling terms on both sides of the equality sign we find 
(x E C). 
Now write down this relation with t1 and t2 interchanged, and subtract that 
from the above relation. Then we find (x, [h, t2JX) = 0 (x E C). 
0 
Lemma 3.5.2 (i) L1 is generated as a vector space by the ta,b with a, bE C. 
(ii) If char(k) = 2, then L1 is generated as a Lie algebra by {la, rb, me I a, bE 
e.L, C E C}, and Lo is generated as a Lie algebra by {la, rb I a, bE C}. 
Proof. For t E Llo define Nt = {x E C I t(x) = o}. For a = t(e) we have 
(e, a) = o. Pick b E C with (e, b) = -1. Then ta,b(e) = a = t(e), so 
t' = t - ta,b maps e to 0, i.e., e E Nt'. 
Next assume we have t E L1 with e E Nt i: C. Pick u E C, u ¢ Nt. For 
a = t(u) we have (u,a) = 0, and for x E Nt, 
(x,a) = (x,t(u)) + (t(x),u) = o. 
Choose b E Nl with (u, b) = -1. Then 
ta,b(X) = (x,a)b-(x,b)a = 0 
{x E Nt), 
ta,b(U) = (u, a)b - (u, b)a = t(u). 
Hence for t' = t - ta,b we have Nt' ;2 Nt and u E Nt" so Nt' i: Nt. By 
induction we arrive at statement (i). Notice that after the first step we have 
only used transformations ta,b with a, b E e.L. 
For the proof of (ii), consider any t E L1. Take a = t(e), then (a, e) = 
o. For t' = t - la we have t'(e) = 0, so e E Nt'. Continuing as in the 
previous paragraph we find that L1 is generated as a vector space by the 
transformations la and ta,b with a, b E e.L. In order to prove (ii) it therefore 
suffices to express these ta,b in left and right multiplications by elements of 
e.L and transformations me with C E C. 
Let a, b E e.L. From a = -a we infer that -ax + xa = (x, a )e, so ax = 
xa - (x, a )e, and similarly xb = bx - (x, b )e. Using this, we find: 
[la,rb](x) = a(xb) - (ax)b 
= a(bx) - (xa)b + (x, a)b - (x, b)a 
= a(bx) - (xa)b + ta,b(X) 
(x E C), 
so 
(x E C). 
(3.9) 
Since the associator in C is alternating, 

3.5 Local Triality 
53 
(xa)b - x(ab) = (ab)x - a(bx) 
(x E C), 
so 
a(bx) + (xa)b = (ab)x + x(ab) 
(x E C). 
Now assuming that char(k) = 2, we substitute this into (3.9), thus getting 
ta,b(X) = [la, rb](x) + (ab)x + x(ab) 
Hence we find 
= [la,rb](x) + (ab)x - (ab)(x,e) +x(ab) - (x,e)(ab) 
= [la, rb](x) + (ab)x + x(ab). 
(a,b E e.l), 
which shows that Ll is generated as a Lie algebra by the la, rb and me as 
stated in (ii). 
For Lo, finally, fix any dEC with (e,d) = 1; then by (1.4), 
(x, dx) = (e, d)N(x) = N(x) 
(x E C). 
If t E Lo has local multiplier -X, then t - -Xld ELI. Since me = le - re, we see 
that Lo is generated by allla and rb. 
0 
As in the last paragraph of the above proof we see that in any character-
istic Lo is spanned by Ll and ld for some d fj e.l. If char(k) 1= 2, we can take 
d = ~e, but in characteristic 2 we have le ELI. Thus, 
Lemma 3.5.3 (i) dim Lo = dim Ll + 1. 
(ii) If char(k) 1= 2, then Lo = Ll EI1 kid, a direct sum of Lie algebras. If 
char(k) = 2, then kid eLI. 
For later use, we formulate another consequence of Lemma 3.5.2, which is of 
a technical nature and which easily follows from the proof of part (ii) of that 
lemma. 
Lemma 3.5.4 Assume char(k) = 2. Let M be the subalgebra of Ll generated 
as a Lie algebra by the la and rb with a, b E e.l, and let d be some element of 
C with (d,e) = 1. Then Ll = M + kmd. 
We will see later that md fj M. 
We are now ready to formulate and prove the result on local triality. 
Theorem 3.5.5 (Principle of Local Triality) Let C be an octonion al-
gebra with norm N over a field k. 
(i) If char(k) 1= 2, then for every tl E Ll there exist unique t2, t3 E Ll such 
that 
(x,y E CJ. 
(3.10) 
The mappings {}2 : tt ~ t2, and {}3 : tl ~ t3, respectively, with tl, t2, t3 
satisfying (3.10), are Lie algebra automorphisms of L1• 

54 
3. Triality 
For tl = ta,b, (3.10) is satisfied by t2 = !(lbla -lalb) and t3 = !(rbra -
rarb)· 
(ii) If char(k) = 2, then for every tl E Lo there exist t2, t3 E Lo such that 
(3.10) holds. These t2, t3 are unique up to a change t2 I--t t2 + Aid, t3 I--t 
t3 + Aid, for some A E k. The mappings 
f)2 : tl + k id I--t t2 + kid, 
and 
tJ3 : tl + k id I--t t3 + kid, 
with tI, t2, t3 satisfying (3.10), are Lie algebra automorphisms of Lo/ kid. 
(3.10) is satisfied by the triples tl = la, t2 = la + ra, t3 = la and tl = rb, 
t2 = rb, t3 = lb + rb· 
Proof. Let N be the set oftl E Ll (or E Lo in characteristic 2) for which there 
exist t2, t3 E Ll (E Lo, respectively) such that (3.10) is satisfied. If (ti, t~, t~) 
also satifies (3.10), then clearly so does (Atl + J.Lti, At2 + J.Lt~, At3 + J.Lt;) for 
A, J.L E k. Further, 
tlt~(xy) = tl(t~(X)Y + xt~(y)) 
= tl(t~(X)Y) + h(xt~(y)) 
= t2t~(X)Y + t~(X)t3(Y) + t2(X)t~(y) + xt3t~(y) 
(x,y E C). 
Interchanging the ti and the t~ and then subtracting from the above relation 
yields 
(x,y E C). 
This shows that N is a Lie sub algebra of L1 (or Lo in characteristic 2). Hence, 
to prove the Theorem it suffices to prove that N contains a set of generators 
of Ll or Lo, respectively. 
First, we consider the char(k) =F 2 case for L1. We use the ta,b as genera-
tors. 
ta,b(XY) = (xy, a)b - (xy, b)a 
= (y,xa)b- (y,xb)a 
= (by)(xa) + (b(ax))y - (afi)(xb) - (a(bx))y 
= (b(ax) - a(bx))y + (by)(xa) - (ay)(xb). 
(3.11) 
From the definition of ta,b it is immediate that ta,b(Z) = ta,b(Z), so using the 
above expression we get 
ta,b(XY) = ta,b(fiX) 
= x((ya)b - (yb)a) + (afi)(xb) - (by)(xa). 
(3.12) 
Adding (3.11) and (3.12) and dividing by 2 yields 
1 
-
1 
-
ta,b(XY) = 2(b(ax) - a(bx))y + 2x((ya)b - (yb)a). 

3.5 Local Triality 
55 
Just as we noticed before Lemma 3.5.1, !(hla -lalr,) and !(rbra - rarjj) are 
elements of L l . This proves existence in case (i). 
For existence in case (ii), we take as generators of Lo the la and rb. Since 
the associator is symmetric in characteristic 2, 
a(xy) + (ax)y = x(ay) + (xa)y, 
so 
a(xy) = (ax + xa)y + x(ay). 
Hence (3.10) is satisfied by h = la, t2 = la + ra and b = lao Similarly with 
tl = rb, t2 = rb and t3 = lb + rb· 
Now about uniqueness. Assume that the triples (tl,t2, b) and (iI, t~, t~) 
both satisfy (3.10). Then U2 = t2 -
t~ and U3 = t3 -
t~ satisfy 
U2(X)Y + XU3(y) = 0 
(x,y E C). 
Taking y = e we find U2(X) = xa with a = -u3(e), while with x = e we find 
U3(y) = -u2(e)y = -ay. Then 
(xa)y - x(ay) = 0 
(x,y E C). 
By Prop. 1.9.2 this implies that a = >.e for some>. E k, so U2 = -U3 = >. id. 
If char(k) =f 2, this transformation does not belong to Ll if>. =f 0, so in that 
case t2 and t3 are uniquely determined by h. 
The statements about the automorphisms {)2 and {)3 are consequences of 
the first paragraph of this proof. 
0 
A triple (h, t2, t3) of local similarities which satisfies (3.10) is said to be 
related. The following result is immediate from the first paragraph of the 
proof of the Theorem combined with Lemma 3.5.1. 
Corollary 3.5.6 If (tl' t2, t3) and (t~, t~, t3) are related triples of local simi-
larities, then the triple of alternating transformations ([iI, t~], [t2' t~l, [t3, t3J) 
is related. 
Remark 3.5.7 In characteristic =f 2, the Principle of Local 'friality holds in 
Lo as well. Then tl determines t2 and t3 up to adding opposite multiples of 
the identity. Taking iI = id as an extra generator besides the ta,b, the triple 
tl = id, t2 = id, t3 = 0 satisfies (3.10). 
Assume char(k) = 2. Then the principle of local triality does not hold in 
L l . For consider tl = md = ld + rd E L1 for some dEC with (d, e) = 1. 
Since the associator is invariant under cyclic permutation, we have 
d(xy) + (dx)y = x(yd) + (xy)d, 
so 

56 
3. Triality 
d(xy) + (xy)d = (dx)y + x(yd). 
The Principle of Local Triality in Lo says that t2 = ld + oX id and t3 = r d + oX id 
are the only elements in Lo such that the triple (t1' t2, t3) satisfies (3.10). But 
none of these t2 and t3 are in L1 if d 1- el.. 
One way out is to formulate a Principle of Local Triality for L1 in com-
bination with two other subalgebras L2 and L3 of Lo which we define as 
follows: Li is the subalgebra containing k id such that Ldk id = 'l9i(Ll/k id) 
for i = 2,3. For t1 E L1 one can then find t2 E L2 and t3 E L3 such that 
(3.10) holds, and these are unique up to adding to both of them one and the 
same multiple of the identity. 
Another approach is to restrict to a subalgebra of L 1. Let M be the 
Lie subalgebra of L1 generated by all la and rb with a, b E el.. We saw in 
Lemma 3.5.4 that L1 = M + kmd, so L2 = M + kld and L3 = M + kr d. Since 
ld and r d have local multiplier (e, d) = 1, they do not belong to L 1. On the 
other hand, if hEM, then t2, t3 E M by Th. 3.5.5. Hence md 1- M, and L 1, 
L2 and L3 are three distinct Lie algebras which have M in common, while the 
sum of any two of them is Lo. Recall that dim L1 = 28, hence dim M = 27. 
Thus we have proved the following theorem. 
Theorem 3.5.8 Assume char(k) = 2. Let M be the Lie subalgebra of L1 
generated as a Lie algebra by all la and r a with a E el., and let d be a fixed 
element of C with d 1- el. . 
(i) dimM = 27, L1 = M EB k(ld + rd), L2 = M EB ld and L3 = M EB rd. 
Further, Li n L j = M and Li + Lj = Lo for 1 S i 1 j S 3. 
(ii) For hELl there exist t2 E L2 and b E L3 such that (3.10) holds, and 
these are unique up to adding a common multiple of the identity to them. 
(iii) For t1 E M there exist t2, t3 E M, unique up to adding a common 
multiple of the identity, such that (3.10) holds. For t1 E L11 T1 1- M such t2 
and t3 in L1 do not exist. 
Lemma 3.3.2 about permutations of related triples of proper similarities 
has a local analog. First some notation. For a local similarity t, the local 
similarity £ is defined by 
£(x) = t(x) 
(x E C). 
£ and t have the same local multiplier. The mapping t 1-4 £ is an involutory 
automorphism of the Lie algebra Lo, and it maps L1 onto itself. 
Lemma 3.5.9 Assume tl, t2, t3 E L1 if char(k) 12, and t1, t2, t3 EM 
if char(k) = 2. If the triple (t1,t2, t3) is related, then so are the triples 
(t2' t 1, £3), (t3,t2' t1), (£1,t3, £2), (£2, t3, £1) and (£3, £1,t2)' In the characteris-
tic 2 case, t E M implies i EM. 
Proof. Substitution in (3.10) of xy for x and of f} for y yields 
(x,y E C), 

3.5 Local Triality 
57 
hence 
(x,y E C). 
Multiplying all the terms in the latter equation on the right by y, we get 
(x,y E C). 
Now 
((xy)t3(y))Y = ((xy)i3(y))y 
= -((xy)y)i3(y) + (y, i3(y) )xy 
(by Lemma 1.3.3 (iv)) 
= -N(y)xi3(y) 
(since i3 ELI)' 
Thus we get 
(x,y E C, N(y) i= 0), 
and by Zariski continuity this holds for all x, y E C, so (t2' tl, i3) is related. 
Further, 
i 1(xy) = t 1(tj:i) 
---..,,.....,------;--:-
= t2(Y)X + fjt3(X) 
= Xi2(y) + i3(X)y 
(x,y E C), 
from which it follows that (iI, i3, i2) is related. In particular, we see that 
i1 E M if t1 E M. 
The other three cases follow by applying the above results.

In § 3.1 we considered the projection 7r : Spin(N) ....... SO(N), which sends 
a1 0 a2 0 ... 0 a2r to sal Sa2 ... Sa2r' We saw that in the characteristic 2 case 
d7r maps L(Spin(N)) onto a 27-dimensional subalgebra of L 1. We will see in 
Cor. 3.6.7 that this image is M (defined as in Th. 3.5.8). Using this result 
we will then derive that M is the commutator subalgebra [L1' L1], which 
provides a characterization of M that does not depend on a special set of 
generators. 
The fact that, in characteristic 2, M is the commutator subalgebra of L1 
could also be derived in a different way. From Cor. 3.5.6 and Th. 3.5.8 one 
infers that [Lo, Lo] ~ M, so M is a 27-dimensional ideal in L1. The latter is a 
Lie algebra of type D4 of intermediate type, i.e., belonging to the orthogonal 
group and not to the simply connected nor to the adjoint group. From general 
results about Lie algebras of classical type in nonzero characteristic it follows 
that M must be the commutator subalgebra [Ll, L 1] (see [Ho 78, Th. (8.20)] 
or [Ho 82, Th. (2.1)]). These general results also tell us that Ll has a 1-
dimensional center in this case; in the following lemma we prove this directly, 
and also that L1 has trivial center in the other characteristics. 

58 
3. Triality 
Lemma 3.5.10 (i) Ifchar{k) '" 2, the center of Ll is trivial, and the center 
of Lo as well as the centralizer of Ll in Lo is kid. 
(ii) If char{k) = 2, then Lo, Ll and M have center kid, and this is also the 
centralizer in Lo of each of these Lie algebras. 
Proof. Let t E Lo commute with all la and r a for a E e.L. From tla = La t it 
follows that 
t{ax) = at{x) 
(a E e.L, x E C). 
Taking x = e we get that t{a) = au for a E e.L, where u = t(e). Replacing la 
by r a we find that t{ a) = ua for a E e.L. Thus, 
t{x) = xu = ux 
(3.13) 
If char(k) '" 2, we can drop the restriction x E e.L in (3.13), since this equation 
also holds for x = e. This implies that u is central in C, so by Prop. 1.9.1 
u = Ae for some A E k. Hence t = A id; this is an element of Lo, but not of 
L 1· 
Now assume char(k) = 2. Then (3.13) and Prop. 1.2.3 together imply 
(x, u)e + ( u, e)x = 0 
Since x need not be a multiple of e, we see that (u, e) = 0, and hence 
(x, u) = 0 for all x E e.L. This proves that u = Ae for some A E k. Finally, 
consider x f/- e.L. Choose a E e.L n x.L with N{a) '" O. Then ax E e.L, since 
(ax,e) = (x,a) = (x,a) = O. Hence 
t(x) = t(a- 1(ax)) = N(a)-lt(a(ax)) = N{a)-lat{ax) = N(a)-la(Aax) = AX, 
so t = Aid. This is contained in M if char{k) = 2 by Th. 3.5.8 (iii).

3.6 The Spin Group of an Octonion Algebra 
We consider again the rotation group SO(N) of the norm N of an octonion 
algebra Cover k. The phenomenon of triality makes it possible to give an-
other description of the simply connected covering of SO(N). In fact, we will 
construct an algebraic group RT( C) which we show to be isomorphic to the 
spin group Spin(N) of § 3.1. 
We let the group SO(N)3 = SO(N) x SO(N) x SO{N) act componentwise 
on the vector space 
v = C3 = {(XI,X2,X3) IXi E C, i = 1,2,3}. 
In SO(N)3 we consider the subgroup RT(C) of related triples, Le., RT(C) 
consists of the triples that satisfy the first form of triality: 

3.6 The Spin Group of an Octonion Algebra 
59 
Recall that for related triples (tl, t2, t3) of rotations we must have all ti E 
O'(N), the reduced orthogonal group. By (i) of Th. 3.2.1, RT(C) is closed 
under componentwise multiplication and taking inverses. 
A rotation tl with a(h) = 1 can be written as 
with ai, bi E c, It N(ai)N(bi) = 1. According to Th. 3.2.1 (iii) the corre-
sponding rotations t2, t3 such that (tl' t2, t3) is related are given by 
We can get the plus sign here by replacing al by -al, if necessary. Hence, 
RT( C) consists of the elements 
(ai, bi E C, II N(ai)N(bi) = 1). 
i 
where ai, bi E c, It N(ai)N(bi) = 1. 
We denote RT(CK) by RT(C). Over the algebraic closure K of k the 
reduced orthogonal group O'(N) coincides with SO(N), so RT(C) is a closed 
subgroup of the algebraic group SO(N)3. We will see in Prop. 3.7.1 below 
that the algebraic group RT( C) is defined over k. It then will follow that 
RT(C) is the group of rational points RT(C)(k). 
Proposition 3.6.1 RT(C) is a connected algebraic group, and 
is a surjective homomorphism of algebraic groups which has a kernel of order 
2 if char(k) =1= 2 and which is bijective if char(k) = 2. The group RT(C) is 
mapped onto SO(N) by el. 
Proof. It is obvious that l!l is a surjective homomorphism of algebraic groups. 
Since t2 and t3 are determined by tl up to a common factor ±1, ker(el) = 
{1, 1- }, with 1 and 1- denoting (1,1,1) and (1, -1, -1), respectively. Note 
that 1- = 1 if char(k) = 2. 
To prove the connectedness of RT( C), consider in C K the set S = {x E 
CK I N(x) = 1}; this is an irreducible variety as we remarked already in 
the proof of the connectedness of Spin(N) in § 3.1, hence so is S x S. The 
elements (SaSb' lalli' rar/)) with N(a) = N(b) = 1 generate RT(C). There is a 
morphism of algebraic varieties 

60 
3. Triality 
Its image under, is an irreducible subvariety of RT( C) which contains the 
identity and generates RT(C), hence RT(C) is connected (see [Hu, § 7.5] or 
[Sp 81, Prop. 2.2.6]). The last point is clear. 
0 
To find the Lie algebra L(RT(C)), we work again over the ring K[€] of dual 
numbers. We must have the triples (tl' t2, t3) such that (1 +€tl, 1 +et2, 1 +€t3) 
is a related triple ofrotations in CK[e]. This leads to triples of ti E Ll which 
satisfy 
h(xy) = t2(X)Y + xt3(Y) 
Thus we find in characteristic i- 2: 
(x,y E C). 
Recall that, in this case, tl E Ll uniquely determines t2 and t3. So the right-
hand side has dimension dim Ll = 28 = dim RT( C), and it follows that the 
inclusion must be an equality. If char(k) = 2, the components ti of a related 
triple of alternating transformations must lie in M. We obtain that 
Now h determines the couple (t2' t3) modulo k(I, 1). Again, the inclusion is 
an equality. 
Corollary 3.6.2 (!l is a sepamble isogeny if char(k) i- 2, and an insepamble 
isogeny with ker d{!l of dimension 1 if char(k) = 2. 
Proof. If char(k) i- 2, then 
d{!l : L(RT(C)) ---? Ll, (tl' t2, t3) ~ tl, 
is bijective, so {!l is a separable isogeny (see [Sp 81, Th. 4.3.7]). If char(k) = 2, 
then d{!l has a I-dimensional kernel, viz. k(O, 1, 1), so then {!l is an inseparable 
isogeny (see [Sp 81, § 9.6]). 
0 
We see that the situation of RT(C) with its projection (!l onto SO(N) 
is the same as that of Spin(N) and its projection 7r onto SO(N) (treated at 
the end of § 3.1). Hence RT(C) must be the simply connected covering of 
SO(N) and is therefore isomorphic to Spin(N), at least in characteristic i- 2. 
Rather than exactly figuring out the situation in characteristic 2 (with root 
systems and all that), we prefer to exhibit directly an isomorphism between 
RT( C) and Spin(8) in all characteristics. 
Proposition 3.6.3 There is an isomorphism of algebmic groups 
'P: Spin(N) ---? RT(C) 
defined by 

3.6 The Spin Group of an Octonion Algebra 
61 
where ai, bi E CK, TIi N(ai)N(bi) = 1. It commutes with the projections of 
Spin(N) and RT(C) on SO(N) and induces an isomorphism of Spin(N) 
onto RT(C). 
Proof. We follow a detour via the even tensor algebra of C, 
and the algebra End( C) of k-linear transformations of C into itself. The 
bilinear transformation 
C xC --t End(C), (a, b) ~ lalb' 
defines a linear transformation 
This can be extended to an algebra homomorphism 
'PT : T+(C) --t End(C) with 'PT(a ® b) = lalb 
for 
a, bE C. 
'PT maps the ideal rt in T+ (C) generated by the elements x ® x - N (x) and 
u®x®x®v - N(x)(u®v) (u, v, x E C) onto 0, so it can be factored through 
the even Clifford algebra CI+(N) = T+(C)/rt of C, that is to say, we find 
an algebra homomorphism 
In a similar way we define an algebra homomorphism 
'P2 : CI+(N) --t End(C) with 'P2(a 0 b) = rarb 
for a, bE C. 
We determine the kernels of 'PI and 'P2. First assume char(k) =I- 2. The center 
of CI+(N) has dimension 2 and is spanned by 1 and z = el 0 e2 0 ···0 es 
where el = e, e2, ... ,es is a standard orthogonal basis of C (see (1.29)). Since 
zo2 = 1, the elements UI = ~(1 + z) and U2 = ~(1- z) are orthogonal central 
idempotents. The algebra CI+(N) is the direct sum of two simple two-sided 
ideals, viz., It = UI 0 CI+(N) and 12 = U2 0 CI+(N), both of dimension 
64 (see [Che 54, Th. lI.2.3 and Th. lI.2.4]). Since dimCI+(N) = 128 and 
dim End( C) = 64, the kernel of 'PI must have dimension at least 64. Since 
'PI =I- 0, ker('PI) is either It or h It follows that 'PI(UI) = ° 
or 'PI (U2) = 0, so 
'PI(Z) = 1 or -1. In the former case we replace es by -es, so we may assume 
'PI(Z) = -1. This implies ker('PI) = It. We have 

62 
3. Triality 
By conjugating we obtain Tel Te2 •.• Te7 Tes = -1. Since e1 = e1 and ei = -ei 
for i > 1, this implies 
Therefore, ker( 'P2) = h 
If char(k) = 2, we proceed similarly, but there is some difference in the 
details. We choose a standard symplectic basis e1 = e, e2, ... ,es, i.e., a basis 
as in (1.30) with all N(ei) = 1. The center ofCI+(N) is again two-dimensional 
and is spanned by 1 and z = e1 0 es + e2 0 e6 + e3 0 e7 + e4 0 es (see [Dieu, 
Ch. II, § 10]). The element z satifies the equation z02 + z = O. It follows that 
U1 = z and U2 = Z + 1 are orthogonal central idempotents. As above we see 
that either 'P1 (z) = 0 or 'P1 (z) = 1. In the latter case we replace es by e + es, 
which interchanges z and z + 1 and hence U1 and U2. SO we may assume that 
'P1(Z) = O. One easily computes that 'P2(Z) = 'P1(Z) + 1 = 1, since es = e+es 
and ei = ei for i I: 5. As in the characteristic I: 2 case above one finds that 
ker('Pt} = It = U1 0 CI+(N) and ker('P2) = 12 = U2 0 CI+(N). 
Thus we find that in every characteristic the algebra homomorphism 
('Pt, 'P2) : CI+(N) -
End(C) x End(C), x 1-+ ('P1(X), 'P2(X)) (x E CI+(N)), 
is injective and hence an isomorphism since both algebras have dimension 
128. 
Working over K we obtain a homomorphism of algebraic groups 
1/;: RT(C) -
SO(N) x SO(N), (t1' t2, t3) 1-+ (t2' t3). 
RT' (C) = 1/;(RT( C)) is a closed subgroup of SO(N) x SO(N). For (t2' t3) E 
RT'(C), the element tt E SO(N) such that (tt,t2,t3) satisfies the first form 
of triality is unique, since (3.4) implies 
Hence 1/;: RT(C) -
RT'(C), has an inverse 1/;-1, which is a morphism. Thus, 
1/; induces an isomorphism of algebraic groups between RT(C) and RT'(C). 
From Th. 3.2.1 (iii) it follows that RT'(C) consists of the elements ofthe 
form 
Since Spin(N) consists of the elements 
the algebra isomorphism ('P1, 'P2) induces an isomorphism of algebraic groups 
from Spin(N) onto RT'(C). Combining this with 1/;-1 we obtain an isomor-
phism'P = 1/;-1('P1,'P2) of algebraic groups from Spin(N) onto RT(C). A 
similar argument with generators shows that 'P maps Spin(N) onto RT(C). 0 

3.6 The Spin Group of an Octonion Algebra 
63 
We saw in § 3.3 how triality induces in the projective special similarity 
group PSGO(N) a group S of outer automorphisms which is isomorphic 
to the symmetric group 83 . We have similar automorphisms of the simply 
connected covering group RT(C) ~ Spin(N), coming from permutations of 
the three "components" of related triples (cf. Lemma 3.3.2). More precisely, 
consider 7i : RT(C) ~ RT(C), for i = 1,2,3, defined by 
71 : (tl' t2, t3) f-+ (£1,t3, £2), 
72 : (tb t2, t3) f-+ (t3, £2, td, 
73 : (tl' t2, t3) f-+ (t2' tl, £3). 
By Th. 3.2.1 (i) and Lemma 3.3.2 these are automorphisms of RT(C). We 
have similar automorphisms of RT(C). 
Proposition 3.6.4 72 and 73 generate a group S of automorphisms of 
RT( C) which is isomorphic to the symmetric group 83 . The nontrivial 
elements of S are outer automorphisms. 
Proof. We have 7~ = 71 = id and 727372 = 737273 = 71. It follows that S 
consists of id, 71, 72, 73, 7273, 7372, so has order 6. 
Assume char(k) 1- 2. The central elements (1, -1, -1), (-1,1, -1) and 
(-1, -1, 1) of RT(C) are permuted by the elements of S. This defines an 
isomorphism orS onto 83 . An inner automorphism induces the trivial per-
mutation of the center, so the nontrivial elements of S must be outer auto-
morphisms. 
The above argument breaks down in characteristic 2, since then the above 
central elements coincide. In that case we work over K, and use the center Z 
of L(RT(C))). This center consists of the related triples (tl' t2, h) with all ti 
belonging to the center of M, so by Lemma 3.5.10, 
Z = { (A, J-L, A + J-L) I A, J-L E K}. 
The above automorphisms 7i induce in L(RT( C)) automorphisms d7i which 
are described by the same formulas as the 7i, but with tl, t2 and t3 denoting 
this time elements of Ll (see also Lemma 3.5.9). So they induce permuta-
tions of the elements (1,1,0), (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) of Z. Thus, we get an 
isomorphism of S onto 83 again. Since the inner automorphisms of RT(C) 
act trivially on Z, the nontrivial elements of S are outer automorphisms. 0 
Remark 3.6.5 RT(C) ~ Spin(8) is an algebraic group of type D4. The 
quotient of Aut(RT( C)) by the group of inner automorphisms Inn(RT( C)) 
is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of D4, which 
is 83 (see [Hu, § 27.4] or [Stei, § 10]). The above proposition gives an explicit 
splitting Aut(RT(C)) = S. Inn(RT(C)), with S ~ 83. 

64 
3. Triality 
We have three representations fli of RT(C) in CK, given by 
Proposition 3.6.6 The representations fli are irTeducible and pairwise in-
equivalent. 
Proof. The image of fli is 80(N), which acts irreducibly in CK. 
If char(k) =fi 2, then the kernels of flb fl2 and fl3 are < (1, -1, -1) >, 
< (-1,1,-1) > and < (-1,-1,1) >, respectively. Since these kernels are 
distinct, the representations can not be equivalent. 
In the case that char(k) = 2, we seek refuge in the Lie algebra L(RT(C)) 
again. There, dflb dfl2 and dfl3 have kernels k(O, 1,1), k(l, 0,1) and k(l, 1, 0), 
respectively. These being distinct, the representations are not equivalent. 0 
Composing the fli with the isomorphism 'P : 8pin(8) = 8pin(N) -
RT(C) of Prop. 3.6.3, we get three surjective homomorphisms 1I'i of 8pin(8) 
onto 80(8), which yield inequivalent representations in C. Prop. 3.6.3 en-
ables us to write these out explicitly. We will see that 11'1 is the same as the 
homomorphism 11' we considered at the end of § 3.1. 
For these explicit computations we need to fix a nontrivial idempotent z 
in the center of CI+(N, K). If char(k) =fi 2, we choose a standard orthogonal 
basis e1, e2, ... , eg in CK (see (1.29)), and take z = e1 ° e2 ° ... ° eg. A 
straightforward computation shows that 'P1(Z) = -1 and 'P2(Z) = 1. (Hint: 
in the proof of Prop. 3.6.3 it was shown that 'P1(Z) = ±1 and that 'P2(Z) = 
-'P1(Z), so it suffices, e.g., to check that 'P2(z)(e) = e, which is easy using 
(1.8), Moufang identities and Lemma 1.3.3.) 
The image of L(8pin(8)) under d1l'i is L1 = L(80(N)) in characteristic 
=fi 2, as follows from Th. 3.5.5. 
If char(k) = 2, we use a standard symplectic basis e1 = e, e2, . .. ,eg (as 
in (1.30)) with all N(ei) = 1) and take z = 2::=1 ei ° eH4. Then 'P1(Z) = 1 
and 'P2(Z) = O. (Hint: from the proof of Prop. 3.6.3 we know already that 
'P1(Z) = 0 or 1, and that 'P2(Z) = 'P1(Z) + 1, and one easily checks that 
'P1(z)(e) = e in this case.) As we saw at the end of § 3.1, the Lie algebra 
L(8pin(8)) consists of the elements u = ao+ 2:i<j aijeioej with ao, aij E K, 
2::=1 ai,H4 = O. Its image under dIP is 
L(RT(C)) = {(tb t2, t3) E M31 (tb t2, t3) related}. 
From Th. 3.5.8 we infer that dfli(L(RT(C))) = M for i = 1,2,3. We thus 
find: 
Corollary 3.6.7 The homomorphisms of algebmic groups 1I'i : 8pin(8) -
80(8) which are defined by

order 2, viz., < -1 >, < -z > and < z >, respectively. If char(k) = 2, then 
the 7l"i are bijective, insepamble isogeniesj the kernels of d7l"l, d7l"2 and d7l"3 are 
the subspaces k 1, k(1 + z) and kz of L(Spin(8)), respectively, and the d7l"i 
all have image M. 
We can now prove the result announced after Lemma 3.5.9. 
Lemma 3.6.8 (i) If char(k) = 2, then M = [M, M] = [L1' L1] = [Lo, Lo]. 
(ii) [L(Spin(8)), L(Spin(8))] = L(Spin(8)). 
Proof. We know already that [Lo, Lo] £:;; M (see Cor. 3.5.6 and Th. 3.5.8), 
hence 
[M, M] £:;; [L1, L1] £:;; [Lo, Lo] £:;; M. 
Therefore, to get (i) it suffices to prove that [M, M] = M. This will follow 
from [M,M] = M. Since M = d7l"1(L(Spin(8))), it suffices to prove (ii). We 
do this by picking generators of L(Spin(8)) and expressing these as sums 
of commutators. As generators we take 1, the ei 0 ej with 1 $ i < j $ 8, 
j '" i + 4, and the elements ei 0 eiH + ej 0 ejH with 1 $ i < j $ 4, using 
the notations introduced just before the above corollary. In the following 
commutator relations, which are easily verified, the indices i, j, k are distinct 
and 1 $ i,j,k $ 4. 
hence 
This also enables us to write 1 as a sum of commutators. Further, 
lei 0 ek, ek+4 0 ej] = ei 0 ej, 
lei 0 ek, ek+4 0 ej+4] = ei 0 ej+4, 
[ei+4 0 ek, ek+4 0 ej+4] = ei+4 0 ej+4. 
Thus we see that all generators of L(Spin(8)) are in the commutator subal-
gebra.

3.7 Fields of Definition 
The results of the foregoing sections enable us to prove that the algebraic 
group RT(C) is defined over k. 

66 
3. Triality 
Proposition 3.7.1 Let C be an octonion algebra over k. The algebraic group 
RT(C) of related triples of rotations is defined over k. 
Proof. We proceed as in the proof ofTh. 2.4.6. Let A = GL( CK)3, the product 
of three copies of GL(CK)' This is an algebraic group which is defined over k. 
Further, V = EndK(CKQ9KCK, CK) is a vector space over K with k-structure 
V(k) = End(C Q9k C, C). In a similar way we have the vector space Q(C)(K) 
over K of quadratic forms on CK, which has Q(C)(k) as a k-structure. The 
multiplication map p, : x Q9 y 1--+ xy lies in V(k) and in Q(C)(k) we have the 
norm N of C. On the vector space 
x = V X Q(C)(K)3 
we have an action of A defined by 
(tl, t2, t3) : X ---+ X, (v, ql, q2, q3) 1--+ (tIl 0 V 0 (t2 Q9 t3), ql 0 tl, q2 0 t2, q3 0 t3)' 
Now notice that tIl 0 P, 0 (t2 Q9 t3) = p, if and only if the triple (tl, t2, t3) 
satisfies the first form of triality (3.4). Therefore, the stabilizer Gx of 
x = (p" N, N, N) E X consists of the triples (tl' t2, t3) of orthogonal transfor-
mations that satisfy (3.4), i.e., of the related triples of rotations. Hence, this 
stabilizer is just the group RT(C). 
By [Sp 81, 12.1.2] the stabilizer will be defined if the kernel of the dif-
ferential dcpe has dimension 28 = dim RT(C) , where cp(a) = a.x (a E A). 
Arguments like those used after the proof 3.6.1 show that this is indeed the 
case. 
o 
By Prop. 3.6.3 we identify RT(C) with Spin(N). The previous Proposi-
tion then gives a structure of algebraic group over k on Spin(N). 
3.8 Historical Notes 
The study of triality originated with the treatment of geometric triality be-
tween points, spaces of one kind and spaces of the other kind on a quadric in 
complex seven-dimensional projective space, by E. Study [Stu] and E. Cartan 
rCa 25]. Octonions appeared in this connection in papers by F. Vaney [Va] 
and E.A. Weiss [Weiss]. Local triality in Lie algebras of type D4 was studied 
by H. Freudenthal [Fr 51] for the real and complex case. F. van der Blij and 
T.A. Springer [BlSp 60] treated algebraic triality over arbitrary fields and lo-
cal triality over fields of characteristic not two. N. Jacobson [Ja 64b], [Ja 71] 
dealt with local triality in characteristic not two, and with algebraic triality 
in [Ja 60]. The results on local triality in characteristic two presented here 
are new, to our knowledge. 
In the literature one often finds the Principle of Triality formulated in 
a different way: for any similarity t, there exist similarities tl and t2 such 

3.8 Historical Notes 
67 
that either tl(XY) = t(X)t2(Y) for all X,Y E Cor tl(XY) = t(y)t2(X) for all 
x, y E C, and similarly with local trialityj this convention goes back to Cartan 
rCa 25J. The formulations used here (and also in [Ja 64b] and [Ja 71]) are 
more convenient in applications and make some proofs simpler. Lemmas 3.3.2 
and 3.5.9 ensure that the different formulations are in fact equivalent. 

4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
Twisted composition algebras are somewhat similar to composition algebras, 
and the two notions are strongly interrelated. On the other hand, twisted 
composition algebras have close connections with Jordan algebras, which we 
will deal with in the next chapter. In fact, the motivation to set up this theory 
comes from exceptional Jordan algebras and twisted algebraic groups of type 
D4. In particular, the notion of reduced twisted composition algebra comes 
from reduced Jordan algebras. We refer to Ch. 6 for the details. 
In this chapter, k will denote a field and [ a separable cubic field extension 
of k. The normal closure of [ over k is [' = [(d), where d satisfies a separable 
quadratic equation over k (see, e.g., [Ja 74, Th. 4.13 and ex. 3 in § 4.8]). 
If char(k) of 2, we can take d = Vl5, Le., either of the square roots of the 
discriminant D of lover k . We set k' = k(d). So either [ is a Galois extension 
of k with cyclic Galois group of order three (a cubic cyclic extension), and 
then [' = [ and k' = k, or [' and k' are quadratic extensions of [ and k, 
respectively, and [' is a cubic cyclic extension of k'. We identify [' with k' 0k [. 
Fix a generator a of Gal([' jk'). We view it also as an element of Gal([1 jk) 
and as a k-isomorphism of [ into ['. We denote by T the element of Gal([1 jk) 
whose fixed field is [ if [' of [, and T = id if [' = [. We denote by Nl/k and 
Trl/k norm and trace function of the extension [ of k. 
We first introduce twisted composition algebras for the case that the 
separable cubic extension [ of k is normal, so a cubic cyclic extension; we call 
algebras of this type "normal twisted composition algebras" . The basic theory 
of these algebras will be developed in § 4.1. In the next section we generalize 
this to the case that the separable cubic extension [ of k is not normal; we 
then get the general twisted composition algebras. In both cases we have a 
vector space with an additional operation; this is binary in the normal case 
(a product), and unary in the nonnormal case (a squaring operation). There 
will be close relations between the two types. 
In the theory of normal twisted composition algebras the characteristic 
of the field k can be arbitrary, but when dealing with the nonnormal twisted 
composition algebras, more precisely with their relations to the normal alge-
bras, we have to exclude characteristic two and three. For the applications 
to Jordan algebras in Ch. 6 this is not a problem, since there a restriction to 
characteristic not two or three will be in force anyway. 

70 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
To study the automorphism group of a twisted composition algebra in 
§ 4.4, we also have to consider twisted composition algebras over a split cubic 
extension of a field K, i.e., over K EB K EB K; we develop that theory in § 4.3. 
But in all other sections we work over a separable cubic field extension l of 
k. 
In the last sections we discuss explicit constructions of twisted composi-
tion algebras, involving connections with cubic central simple algebras. 
4.1 Normal Twisted Composition Algebras 
We first deal with the case of a cubic cyclic field extension [ of k, so [' = l 
and k' = k. 
Definition 4.1.1 A vector space F over l provided with a nondegenerate 
quadratic form N, and associated bilinear form ( , ), is said to be a normal 
twisted composition algebra over l and a if there is a k-bilinear product * on 
F which satisfies the following three conditions. 
(i) The product x * y is a-linear in x and a 2-linear in y, that is 
(>..x) * y = a(>..)(x * y), 
x * (>..y) = a2(>..)(x * y) 
(x,y E F, >.. E l); 
(ii) N(x * y) = a(N(x))a2(N(y)) 
(x,y E F); 
(iii) (x * y,z) = a((y * z,x)) = a2((z * x,y)) 
(x,y,z E F). 
One calls N the norm of the algebra. The normal twisted composition algebra 
is also denoted by (F, *, N), or simply by F. 
A bijective l-linear mapping t : Fl ---> F2 between normal twisted compo-
sition algebras Fl and F2 over l satisfying 
t(x * y) = t(x) * t(y) 
is called an isomorphism. 
We will see in Cor. 4.1.5 that the norm of a normal twisted composition 
algebra is already determined by the linear structure and the product *, and 
that an isomorphism preserves the norm. 
If >.. E k* we define for x,y E F 
x *>. Y = >..(x * y), N>.(x) = a(>..)a2(>..)N(x). 
It is immediate from the definitions that (F, *>., N>.) is a normal twisted com-
position algebra, denoted by F>.. We say that F>. is an isotope of F, and that 
F and F>. are isotopic . . It is easy to see that F>.p, = (F>.)p, (>.., J.L E l*). 
From condition (iii) it follows that 

4.1 Normal Twisted Composition Algebras 
71 
T(x) = (x*x,x) 
(x E F) 
is invariant under a, so T(x) E k for all x E F. Thus, T is a cubic form over 
k in 3 diml F variables. 
In the following two lemmas we give a number of useful identities. 
Lemma 4.1.2 In any normal twisted composition algebm F we have for 
X,y,Z,w E F, 
(x*z,y*z) =a((x,y))a2(N(z)), 
(4.1) 
(x*z,x*w) =a(N(x))a2((z,w)), 
(4.2) 
(x * z, y * w) + (x * w, y * z) = a( (x, y) )a2 ( (z, w)). 
(4.3) 
Proof. From (ii) in the definition we infer 
N((x + y) * (z + w)) = a(N(x + y))a2(N(z + w)). 
Write this out and, using (ii), cancel all terms which contain only two of 
the variables; this yields a relation we call (*). Taking w = 0 in (*), we get 
(4.1) and taking y = 0 we get (4.2). Now cancel all terms in (*) containing 
only three variables by using (4.1) and (4.2), then what remains is precisely 
equation (4.3). 
0 
Lemma 4.1.3 In any normal twisted composition algebm F we have for 
x,y,z E F, 
x * (y * x) = a(N(x))y, 
(4.4) 
x*(y*z)+z*(y*x) =a{(x,z))y, 
(4.5) 
(x * y) * x = a2(N{x))y, 
(4.6) 
(x * y) * z + (z * y) * x = a2((x,z))y, 
(4.7) 
(x * x) * (x * x) = T(x)x - N(x)(x * x). 
(4.8) 
Proof. Since 
(x*{y*x),u) =a2{(u*x,y*x)) 
= a(N(x))( u, y) 
(by (iii) of Def. 4.1.1) 
(by (4.1)) 
= a(N(x))( y, u) 
for all u E F, we get (4.4). Linearizing this equation, we find (4.5). The 
following two equations are proved in the same way. Finally, to prove (4.8) 
take y = x and z = x*x in (4.5): 
x * {x * (x * x)) + (x * x) * (x * x) = T(x)x. 
Since x * (x * x) = a{N{x))x by (4.4), we get 

72 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
(x * x) * (x * x) = T(x)x - x * (a(N(x))x) = T(x)x - N(x)(x * x). 
o 
Consider for a E F the left multiplication l~ : F --t F, x t-t a * x, which 
is a 2-linear, and the right multiplication r~ : F --t F, x t-t X * a, which is 
a-linear. From (4.4) and (4.6) we infer: 
Lemma 4.1.4 If a E F has N(a) -:I 0, then l~ and r~ are invertible, with 
inverses r?v(a)-la and l?v(a)-la' respectively. 
The following result is also immediate from (4.4). 
Lemma 4.1.5 The norm N on a normal twisted composition algebra F over 
I and a is determined by the linear structure over I and the product * on F. 
Isomorphisms of normal twisted composition algebras are norm preserving. 
There exists a close relationship between normal twisted composition al-
gebras and ordinary composition algebras; in fact, either kind can be related 
to the other one. First, consider a normal twisted composition algebra F over 
I and a. Pick a, bE F with N(a)N(b) -:I O. Define 
xy = (a * x) * (y * b). 
This product is I-bilinear, and the norm N satisfies: 
N(xy) = N((a * x) * (y * b)) 
= a(N(a * x))a2(N(y * b)) 
= a2(N(a))N(x)N(y)a(N(b)) 
= >..N(x)N(y) 
with>" = a2(N(a))a(N(b)) -:I o. Take as new norm N = >"N. This obviously 
permits composition (see Def. 1.2.1). An identity element is 
as a straightforward computation using (4.4) and (4.6) shows. We have thus 
obtained a structure of composition algebra on F. As a consequence one finds 
using Th. 1.6.2: 
Proposition 4.1.6 A normal twisted composition algebra over I can only 
have dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8 over 1. 
From the considerations below it will follow that in each of the dimensions 
1, 2, 4 and 8 there do exist normal twisted composition algebras. We will 
mainly be interested in such algebras of dimension 8; we also call these nor-
mal twisted octonion algebras. 

4.1 Normal Twisted Composition Algebras 
73 
We further exploit the connection between ordinary composition algebras 
and normal twisted composition algebras. Let F be as before. Denote by 
N(F)* the set of nonzero values of the norm N and by M(N) the group of 
multipliers of similarities of N (see 1.1). 
Proposition 4.1. 7 M(N) is a (1-stable subgroup of l* and N(F)* is a coset 
>..M(N) , with N1/ k (>..) E M(N). 
Proof. Let N be as before. Clearly, M(N) coincides with the similar group 
M(N), which is the set of nonzero values N(x) (see the beginning of the 
proof of Theorem 1. 7.1). It follows from what we established above that if 
a, bE F, N(a)N(b) =J. 0 we have 
M(N) = (12(N(a))(1(N(b))N(F)*, 
from which we conclude (using that M(N) contains (l*)2) that N(F)* is 
a coset of M (N) and also that M (N) is the set of nonzero elements of the 
form (12(N(a))(1(N(b))N(c) (a, b, c E F). This implies that M(N) is (1-stable. 
Taking a = b = c we see that N1/ k (>..) E M(N) for all >.. E N(F)*.

We now give a construction of a normal twisted composition algebra from 
a composition algebra Cover k. As before, l is cubic cyclic field extension of 
k and (1 a generator of the Galois group. Let Nc be the norm of C. Extend 
the base field to l: 
F = l0k C, 
extend Nc to a quadratic form over l on F, denoted by N, and similarly for 
conjugation and the product. Define a (1-automorphism rp of F by 
rp(~ 0 x) = (1(~) 0 x. 
Notice that N(rp(z)) = (1(N(z)) for z E F. Define 
x * y = rp(x)rp2(fj) 
(x, y E F). 
(4.9) 
A straightforward computation shows that (F, *, N) is a normal twisted com-
position algebra. For the verification of point (iii) in Def. 4.1.1, use (1.10). In 
this verification one sees that it is necessary to take the conjugates of x and 
y in definition (4.9) of the product * ; without conjugation, things go wrong. 
We denote this twisted composition algebra by F(C). 
Definition 4.1.8 A normal twisted composition algebra F over land (1 is 
said to be reduced if there is a composition algebra Cover k and>" E l* such 
that F is isomorphic to the isotope F(Ch. 
Proposition 4.1.9 (i) If the reduced normal twisted composition algebras 
F = F(Ch and F' = F(C'»..I over land (1 are isomorphic, then the compo-
sition algebras C and C' are isomorphic. 
(ii) The normal twisted composition algebras F(C». and F(C)..' over land 
(1 have the same automorphism group. 

74 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
Proof. (i) An isomorphism from F onto F' preserves the norm by Lemma 
4.1.5, hence the norms Nc of C and Nc' of C' are similar over l. It follows (see 
the first paragraph of the proof of Th. 1.7.1) that Nc and Nc' are equivalent 
over l. By a result of Springer (see [Sp 52, p. 1519,bj or [Lam, p. 198]), they 
must be similar over k, so by Th. 1.7.1 C and C' are isomorphic. 
(ii) The condition that a linear bijection is an isomorphism is invariant under 
~~.

We will develop several criteria for a normal twisted composition algebra 
to be reduced. The following theorem is the first result in this line. 
Theorem 4.1.10 Let F be a normal twisted composition algebra over l. The 
following conditions are equivalent. 
(i) F is reduced. 
(ii) T represents zero nontrivially, i.e., there exists x # ° in F such that 
T(x) = (x*x,x) =0. 
(iii) There exists x # ° in F such that x * x = AX for some A E l. 
Proof. (i) => (ii). Assume F is reduced. We may assume that F = F(Ch, as 
before. We write ( , ) and ( , )c for the bilinear forms associated with N 
and Nc, respectively. For x, y E C we have x * y = AXY. Pick x E C, x # 0, 
(x,e)c = 0, then x = -x and x2 = -Nc(x)e by (1.7). Using (1.10) we find 
(x * x, x) = A( x2, x)c = -ANc(x) ( e, x)c = 0, 
which proves (ii). 
(ii) => (iii). If T represents ° nontrivially, we pick y E F, y =1= 0, such that 
T(y) = 0. By (4.8), 
(y * y) * (y * y) = -N(y)y * y. 
We take x = y if y * y = 0, and x = y * y if y * y # 0; in either case, x # ° 
and x * x = AX for some A E l. So (iii) holds. 
(iii) => (i). Under the assumption of (iii), we have to construct a composition 
algebra Cover k such that F ~ F( C) .. for some A E l*. We divide the proof 
into a number of steps. Pick x E F, x # 0, such that x * x = AX with A E l. 
We first introduce e E F which is going to play the role of identity element 
in C. 
(a) If N(x) = J.l # 0, we put e = x. Using (4.6) we see that 
(]"2(J.l)X = (]"2(N(x))x = (x * x) * x = A(]"(A)X. 
It follows that (]"2(J.l) = A(]"(A), so J.l = (]"(A)(]"2(A) and A # 0. Hence e has the 
properties 
e * e = Ae with A E l, A # 0, 
N(e) = J.l = (]"(A)(]"2(A) # 0. 
(4.10) 
(4.11) 

4.1 Normal Twisted Composition Algebras 
75 
(b) Assume now N(x) = O. By (4.8), 
(x*x) * (x*x) = T(x)x = (x*x,x)x = A(X,X)X = O. 
Now either x * x = 0, or y = x * x =1= 0 satisfies y * y = 0 and 
N(y) = N(x * x) = a(N(x»a2(N(x» = O. 
So we may as well assume that we have x =1= 0, N(x) = 0 and x * x = O. 
Since x is contained in a hyperbolic plane (see § 1.1), there exists y E F with 
N(y) = 0 and (x,y) = -1. Using (4.5) we find: 
(z E F), 
(4.12) 
since (x, y) = -1. Hence 
The sets x*F and y*F are subspaces of the vector space F. They are totally 
isotropic for N, since 
N(x * u) = a(N(x))a2(N(u)) = 0 
(UEF), 
and similarly for y * F. It follows that both subspaces have dimension S 
~ dim F (see § 1.1 again). Together they span F, so they must both have 
dimension equal ~ dim F and we have a direct sum decomposition 
Consider the right multiplication r; in F. If Z* x = 0, then z = -x * (Z* y) by 
(4.12), so kerr; ~ x*F. By (4.6), on the other hand, r;(x*Z) = (x*z)*x = 
a2(N(x»z = O. Hence 
kerr; =x*F. 
In the same way we derive from (4.7) the following analog of (4.12): 
(x * z) * y + (y * z) * x = -z 
(z E F). 
(4.13) 
With the same arguments as above one derives: 
For the left multiplication l; one derives using (4.13) and (4.4), 
kerl; = F * x. 
We define a = x * y and b = y * x. Using the identities of Lemma 4.1.3 
one verifies the following relations, where Q = (y, x * y) = (y, a). 

76 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
x * a = -x, a * x = 0, 
x * b = 0, 
b * x = -x, 
a*a = b+a(a)x, 
b* b = a +ax, 
a * b = 0, 
b * a = a 2(a)x. 
(4.14) 
(4.15) 
(4.16) 
(4.17) 
(4.18) 
(4.19) 
From (4.14) and (4.15) we infer that a i= ° and b i= 0, respectively. Using 
(4.3) and the relations in Def. 4.1.1 one further sees 
(a,b) = 1, 
N(a) = N(b) = 0, 
( a, x) = (b, x) = 0. 
In this case we put e = a2(a)x + a + b. We see that 
and 
e * e = (a2(a)x + a + b) * (a2(a)x + a + b) 
= -ax + b + a(a)x - a(a)x + a2(a)x + a + ax 
=a2(a)x+a+b = e 
N(e) = N(a2(a)x + a + b) 
(4.20) 
(4.21 ) 
(4.22) 
= a2(a)2N(x) + N(a) + N(b) + a2(a)(x,a) + a2(a)(x,b) + (a,b) 
= (a, b) = 1. 
Again, e satisfies equations (4.10) and (4.11), this time with ,\ = J-L = 1. 
(c) The next step towards the construction of a composition algebra C is the 
definition of conjugation in F and of a a-linear mapping <p of order 3 (cf. 
( 4.9) and the discussion preceding that equation). 
We define conjugation as in (1.9): 
x = -x + (x, e )N(e)-le 
(x E F). 
(4.23) 
Then - is a linear map, e = e, N(x) = N(x), so (x,y) = (x,y), and x = x. 
Further, we have for x E F, 
x * e = -x * e + (x * e,e)N(e)-le 
= -x*e+a((e*e,x))N(e)-le 
= -x * e+a('\)a((e,x))N(e)-le 
= -x * e + a( (e, x) )('\a2(,\))-1(e * e) 
= (-x+ (x,e)N(e)-le) * e 
= x* e, 

4.1 Normal Twisted Composition Algebras 
77 
and similarly 
e * x = e * x. 
Notice that if F = F(C».., then x * e = Acp(X) by (4.9). This leads us to 
define the (j-linear mapping 
cp : F ____ F, x f-t A -1 (x * e). 
We show that cp has order 3: 
cp2(X) = A-1((A- 1(x*e») H) 
= A-1(j(A)-1((x * e) * e) 
= A -l(j(A)-l ( - (e * e) * x + (j2( ( e, x)e) 
= A -1 ( - e * x + A -1 (j( A) -1 (j2 ( ( e, x ) )e * e) 
=A-1(e*x). 
cp3 ( x) = cp ( cp2 ( X ) ) 
= A -1 ("'-A ---'1:-:-( e-*-x--'-) * e) 
= A -l(j(A)-l((e * x) * e) 
= A-1(j(A)-1(j2(N(e»x = x. 
Further, cp(e) = e and 
cp(x) = A-1(X * e) = A-1(X * e) = cp(x). 
(d) We now define a new product on F (cf. (4.9»: 
(x,y E F). 
(4.24) 
(4.25) 
We show that this product defines a structure of composition algebra over I 
on the vector space Fi see Def. 1.2.1. First, for x E F, 
and in a similar way we find that ex = x. 
To prove that the norm N permits composition up to a scalar factor we 
first show that cp is a (j-similarity: 
N(cp(x» = N(A- 1(X * e» = A-2(j(N(x»(j2(N(e» = A-1(j(A)(j(N(x». 
(4.26) 
U sing this we find 
N(xy) = N(A-1(cp2(x) * cp(y))) 
= A -2(j(N( cp2(x» )(j2(N( cp(fJ))) 
= A-2((j(A)-lAN(x)(j2(A)-lAN(y») 
= fL- 1 N(x)N(y) 
(x, y E F). 

78 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
Hence, if we define 
N(x) = /L-l N(x) 
(x E F), 
(4.27) 
N permits composition. Thus we have proved that the vector space F with 
the new, bilinear, product and the norm N is a composition algebra over l; 
we denote this by 6. 
The conjugation - we defined in step (c) is the normal conjugation in this 
composition algebra 6 with respect to the bilinear form of its norm N. SO 
xy = yx, xx = N(x), etc. 
(e) In this step we prove that cp is a a-automorphism of the composition 
algebra 6. 
cp(XY)=A-1(XYH) = A-1(yx*e) 
= A-1a(A)-1((cp2(y) * cp(x)) * e) 
= r1a(A)-1 ( - (e * cp(x)) * cp2(y) + a2( (cp2(y), e) )cp(x)) 
= A-1a(A)-1( (e * cp(x)) * ( - cp2(y) + (cp2(y), e )N(e)-le)) 
= A-1a(A)-1((e* cp(x)) * cp2(y)) 
= A-1a(A)-1((Acp2(cp(x))) * cp2(iJ)) 
= A-l(cp2(cp(x)) * cp2(y)) 
= cp(x)cp(y) 
(x, y E 6). 
From (4.26) it follows that 
N(cp(x)) = a(N(x)) 
(x E 6). 
( 4.28) 
(f) Define 
C = {x E 61 cp(x) = x}. 
( 4.29) 
Then C is a vector space over k such that 6 ~ l0k C (see [Sp 81, 11.1.6]). 
From the multiplicativity of cp it follows that C is closed under multiplication, 
and (4.28) implies that N(x) E k for x E C. Since C contains the identity 
element e, it is a composition algebra over k. To verify condition (4.9), we 
compute 
A(cp(X)cp2(iJ)) = cp2(cp(X)) * cp(cp2(y)) 
=x*y 
(X,yEF). 
It follows that F ~ F(C) ...

The above theorem enables us to prove, for some special fields k, that 
every normal twisted octonion algebra over a cubic cyclic extension field l of 
k is reduced, namely, if the cubic form T in 24 variables over k represents 0 

4.2 Nonnormal Twisted Composition Algebras 
79 
nontrivially. This is so in the following two cases. 
(i) k a finite field. 
A theorem of Chevalley [Che 35, p. 75J (also in [Gre, Th. (2.3)J, [Lang, third 
ed., 1993, p. 214, ex. 7]), [Se 70, § 2.2, Th. 3] or [Se 73, p. 5]) implies that 
every cubic form in more than three variables over a finite field represents 0 
nontrivially. 
(ii) k a complete, discretely valuated field with finite residue class field. 
Every cubic form in more than nine variables over such a field represents 0 
nontrivially; see [Sp 55, remark after Prop. 2], or also [De] or [Le]. 
If k is an algebraic number field, then also every normal twisted octonion 
algebra over a cubic cyclic extension l of k is reduced; see the end of 4.8. 
This will follow from a further study: in §§ 4.5 and 4.6 we will thoroughly 
explore the structure of normal twisted octonion algebras, especially of those 
whose norm N is isotropic, leading to another criterion (Th. 4.8.1) for nor-
mal twisted octonion algebras to be reduced. But first we introduce general 
twisted composition algebras in the following section, and in the next section 
we will identify the automorphism groups of reduced, normal or nonnormal, 
twisted composition algebras as twisted forms of an algebraic group of type 
D4· 
4.2 Nonnormal Twisted Composition Algebras 
In the present section the separable cubic extension field 1 of k is not neces-
sarily normal. Notations are as fixed in the introduction to this chapter. 
Suppose l' =1= l. Then O'(A) f/. l if A E l, A f/. k, so we cannot carry over the 
definition of a normal twisted composition algebra in Def. 4.1.1 to a vector 
space F over l. However, 0'(A)0'2(A) E l. If F' = A' ®l F is a normal twisted 
composition algebra over l' and if x*x happens to lie in F for x E F, then also 
( AX ) * (AX) E F. This suggests that instead of the product * we must consider 
the square x*2 = X * x. Thus we are led to the the following definition. For 
A E l we write A*2 = 0'(A)0'2(A). 
Definition 4.2.1 Let l be a separable cubic extension of k and 0' a nontrivial 
k-isomorphism of l into its normal closure l'. By a twisted composition algebm 
over land 0' we understand a vector space F over l provided with a unary 
operation *2 : F --+ F, called the squaring opemtion, and a nondegenerate 
quadratic form N, called the norm, with associated bilinear form ( , ), such 
that the following four axioms are satisfied: 
(i) (AX) *2 = A *2 X *2 
(A E l, X E F); 
(ii) f: F x F --+ F defined by 

80 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
f(x, y) = (x + y) *2 -x *2 _y *2 
(x,y E F) 
is k-bilinear; 
(iii) N(x *2) = N(x) *2 
(x E F); 
(iv) T(X)=(X*2,X)Ek 
(xEF). 
We use the notation (F, *2,N), or simply F, for such a twisted composition 
algebra. 
An isomorphism of twisted composition algebras Fl and F2 as above is a 
bijective l-linear map t : Fl -
F2 such that t(x *2) = t(x) *2 for x E Fl. 
Notice that in this definition it is allowed that the cubic extension ljk be 
Galois, so l' = land k' = k. 
If F is a twisted composition algebra as before, and >. E l*, we define the 
isotope F).. to be (F, *'2, N)..), where X*'2 = >.(x *2) and N)..(x) = >. *2 N(x). It 
is immediate that F>. verifies the axioms of a twisted composition algebra. 
The relations between normal and nonnormal twisted composition alge-
bras are given in the following two propositions. 
Proposition 4.2.2 (i) If 1 is cubic cyclic over k and (F, *, N) is a normal 
twisted composition algebra over l, then F with the same norm N and squar-
ing operation defined by x *2 = X * X (x E F) is a twisted composition algebra 
over 1 and a. 
(ii) Let char(k) i- 2,3. If 1 is cubic over k, but not necessarily Galois, and 
(F, *2, N) is a twisted composition algebra over land (j, then F' = l' ®t F with 
the extension of N to a quadratic form over l' on F' carries a unique struc-
ture of normal twisted composition algebra over l' and a such that x *2 = X * x 
for x E F. (For uniqueness it is necessary that the extension of the isomor-
phism a of 1 into l' to an automorphism of l' is given.) 
(iii) If Fl and F2 are twisted composition algebras over 1 and a with char(l) i-
2,3 and F{ and F~, respectively, are their extensions to normal twisted com-
position algebras over l' as in (ii), then an l-linear bijection t : Fl -
F2 
is an isomorphism of twisted composition algebras if and only if its l' -linear 
extension is an isomorphism of normal twisted composition algebras between 
F{ and F~. 
Proof. (i) being obvious, we tackle (ii). Extend the k-bilinear mapping f : 
F x F -
F as in (ii) of Def. 4.2.1 to a k'-bilinear mapping F' x F' -
F'. 
Pick a basis el, ... , en of F over l; this is also a basis of F' over l'. Write 
n 
f(x, y) = L <Pi(X, y)ei 
(x,y E F') 
i=l 
with symmetric k'-bilinear <Pi : F' X F' -
l'. By Dedekind's Theorem, the 
automorphisms id, a and 0'2 form a basis of Endk,(l') over l'. It follows that 
for each i,

2 
'Pi(>"X,y) = L o-j (>")1f!i,j (x, y) 
j=O 
(>.. E I', x,y E p') 
with unique k'-bilinear mappings 1f!i,j : P' x P' -> I'. Thus, 
2 
f(>"x, y) = L o-j (>..)fJ(x, y) 
j=O 
(>.. E I', X,y E F') 
with unique k'-bilinear fJ : P' x P' -> P'. Repeating this argument, we find 
unique k' -bilinear mappings 9i,j : P' X P' -> P' such that 
2 
f(>"x, {LY) = L o-i(>..)o-j ({L)9i,j(X, y) 
(>..,{L E I', x,y E p'). 
(4.30) 
i,j=O 
From the symmetry of f we infer, using Dedekind's Theorem again, that 
(X,yEF') 
(4.31 ) 
for 1 ::; i, j ::; n. By considering f(>..ax, {L/3y) as a function of >.. and {L, we 
find with Dedekind from (4.30) that 
(a,/3 E I', X,y E F') 
(4.32) 
for 1 ::; i,j ::; n. Using this relation and the fact that f(x,x) = 2x*2, we 
rewrite condition (i) of Def. 4.2.1 in the form 
0-(>..)0-2 (>..)f(x, x) = f(>"x, >..x) 
2 
= L o-i (>..)o-j (>")9i,j (x, x) 
i,j=O 
Linearizing in >.., we get for >.., {L E I', x E P' 
2 
(>.. E I', x E p'). 
(0-(>..)0-2({L) + 0-2 (>..)o-({L))f(x, x) = L (o-i(>..)o-j({L) + o-j(>")o-i({L))9i,j(X, x) 
i,j=O 
2 
= L o-i(>")o-j({L)(9i,j(X,X) + 9j,i(X,X)). 
i,j=O 
By Dedekind this implies 
9i,j(X,X) + 9j,i(X,X) = ° (x E P', (i,j) i: (1,2), (2, 1)). 
If char(k) i: 2, it follows by (4.31) that 9i,j(X, x) = 0, so 9i,j is antisymmetric 
for (i,j) i: (1,2), (2, 1). From this we derive, using the symmetry of f, (4.30) 
and (4.31),

f(x, y) = 2(f(x, y) + f(y, x))

= 2(9l,2(X,y) + 92,1(X,y) + 9l,2(Y,X) + 92,1(Y,X)) 
= 9l,2(X, y) + 9l,2(Y, x) 
(x, yEP'). 
Hence if we define 
x * y = 9l,2(X, y) 
(x, yEP'), 
we have a k'-bilinear product on P' which by (4.32) satisfies condition (i) of 
Def. 4.1.1 and such that x *2 = X * x for x E P. The uniqueness of the product 
* is obvious from the proof. 
Extend the norm N on P to a quadratic form over l' on P'. In condition 
(iii) of Def. 4.2.1 we replace x by AX + J.Ly + vz + {!W, with x, y, z, wE P and 
A, J.L, v, {! E k. Writing this as a polynomial in A, J.L, v and {! and equating the 
terms with AJ.LV{!, we find 
(f(x, y),j(z, w)) + (f(x, z), f(y, w)) + (f(x, w), f(y, z)) = 
a( (x, y) )a2( (z, w)) + a( (z, w) )a2( (x, y)) + 
a( (x, z) )a2( (y, w)) + a( (y, w) )a2( (x, z)) + 
a ( ( x, w ) ) a2 ( ( y, z )) + a ( ( y, z ) ) a2 ( ( x, w ) ) . 
Here we use that k has more than four elements. The above relation is four-
linear over k, so it remains valid if we extend k to k'. Hence it also holds 
for x, y, z, w E P'. Replace x, y, z, w in the above relation by AX, J.Ly, VZ, {!W, 
respectively, with x, y, z, w E P' and A, J.L, v, (! E l'. In the relation we thus 
obtain, the terms with a(A)a2(J.L)a(v)a2({!) on either side must be equal by 
Dedekind, so 
Replacing z by x and w by y yields the validity of condition (ii) of Def. 4.1.1 
for P'. 
Applying a similar argument to (iv) of Def. 4.2.1, viz., trilinearization over 
k and then extension of this field to k', yields that T(x) E k' for all x E P'; 
here we use char(k) :I 3. Replacing x by AX + J.Ly + vz and using Dedekind 
then proves that condition (iii) of Def. 4.1.1 holds for P'. This completes the 
proof of part (ii) of the Proposition. 
As to (iii), let t : Pl -+ P2 be an isomorphism of twisted composition 
algebras. Denote its l'-linear extension also by t. On Pi, t-l(t(x) * t(y)) 
is a product for a normal twisted composition algebra which extends the 
squaring operation x 1--7 x *2 on P l , since rl(t(x) *2) = X *2 for x E Pl. By 
uniqueness in (ii), rl(t(x) * t(y)) = x * y for x, y E P{, that is, the extension 
t is an isomorphism of normal twisted composition algebras. The converse is 
obvious.

4.2 Nonnormal Twisted Composition Algebras 
83 
If F is a twisted composition algebra over l with char(l) =1= 2,3, then the 
normal twisted composition algebra F' over l' determined by F as in part 
(ii) of the above proposition will be called the normal extension of F. If l is 
a cubic cyclic extension of k of characteristic =1= 2,3, a twisted composition 
algebra over l may be identified with the normal twisted composition algebra 
it determines. The restriction to fields of characteristic =1= 2,3 is not too much 
of a nuisance; the theory of tWisted composition algebras is set up in view 
of applications to Jordan algebras (see Ch. 5 and 6), and there we need the 
same restriction on the characteristic. 
It is clear that if two twisted compositions algebras are isotopic, the same 
holds for their normal extensions. 
Corollary 4.2.3 Let char(l) =1= 2,3. The norm N of a twisted composi-
tion algebra F over l is uniquely determined by the linear structure and the 
squaring operation 
*2. Isomorphisms of twisted composition algebras pre-
serve the norm. A twisted composition algebra can only have dimension 1, 2, 
4 or 8 over l. 
Proof. Let F' be the normal extension of F. In the proof of part (ii) of 
the above proposition, the product * on F' is determined by the squaring 
operation 
*2 on F and the linear structure; the norm plays no role there. 
By Lemma 4.1.5, the norm on F' is determined by the product and the 
linear structure. This proves the first statement. The second one is proved in 
a similar way. The last statement follows from Prop. 4.1.6 on the dimensions 
of twisted composition algebras. 
0 
As in the normal case, we speak in the case of dimension 8 about twisted 
octonion algebras. 
If F' is a normal twisted composition algebra over l' and l' =1= l, how do 
we find twisted composition algebras F over l such that F' is the normal 
extension of F ? The following proposition gives an answer to this question. 
Recall that r is the generator of Gal(k'/k). 
Proposition 4.2.4 Assume char(k) =1= 2,3 and l' =1= l, so [l' : k] = 6. Let F' 
be a normal twisted composition algebra over l'. 
(i) If F' is the normal extension of a twisted composition algebra over land (J, 
then there exists a unique bijective r-linear endomorphism u of F' satisfying 
u2 = id and 
u(x * y) = u(y) * u(x) 
(x,y E F') 
( 4.33) 
such that F = Inv(u) = {x E F' I u(x) = x}. 
(ii) Conversely, for any u as in (i), Inv(u) is a twisted composition algebra 
over l which has F' as its normal extension. 
(iii) Every u as in (i) satisfies 
N(u(x)) = r(N(x)) 
(x E F'). 

84 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
(iv) If F = Inv(u) and Fi = Inv(ui) are twisted composition algebras over 
1 and a which both have F' as their normal extension, then F ~ Fi if and 
only if there exists an automorphism t of F' such that Ui = tut- i , and every 
isomorphism: F ~ Fi extends to such an automorphism. In particular, 
Aut(F) = {tiF It E Aut(F'), tu = ut}. 
Proof. (i) Identify F' with l' ®t F. The transformation u = 1" ® id is bijective 
1"-linear with u2 = id and F = Inv(u). To prove (4.33), consider for A,J.t E 1 
and x,y E F, 
Z = (AX) * (J.ty) + (J.ty) * (AX) E F, 
so Z is invariant under u. By the 1"-linearity of u, 
Since 1"a = a21" and since A and J.t are 1"-invariant, u(z) = z implies 
a2(A)a(J.t)u(x * y) + a(A)a2(J.t)u(y * x) = 
(AX) * (J.ty) + (J.ty) * (AX) = 
a(A)a2(J.t)(u(x) * u(y)) + a2(A)a(J.t)(u(y) * u(x)). 
By Dedekind's Theorem, 
u(x * y) = u(y) * u(x) 
(x,y E F). 
Since I' = k' ®k I we have F' = l' ®l F = k' ®k F. Using the 1"-linearity of u 
we see that 4.33 holds. 
(iii) Apply u to both sides of equation (4.4) and use (4.6). 
(ii) F = Inv(u) is a vector space over Inv(1") = I of the same dimension as the 
dimension of F' over I' (see, e.g., [Sp 81, 11.1.6]). If X E F, then u(x * x) = 
u(x) * u(x) = X * X, so X * X E F, and further N(x) = N(u(x)) = 1"(N(x)), 
so N(x) E I. It is straightforward now that F with X,.2 = X * x and the 
restriction of N as norm is a twisted composition algebra which has F' as its 
normal extension. 
(iv) Let s : Fi -+ F2 be an isomorphism of twisted composition algebras over 
I and a which both have F' as their normal extension. Let Fi = Inv( Ui) (i = 
1,2). Define t : F' -+ F' as the l'-linear extension of s. From 
(x E F) 
we derive as in the proof of part (i) above that 
t(x * y) = t(x) * t(y) 
(x,y E F'). 
From t(Fi) = F2 and it follows U2 = tUiri. This implies the "only if" part 
of (iv). The "if" part is immediate.

4.2 Nonnormal Twisted Composition Algebras 
85 
A T-linear mapping u as in the above proposition is called an involution 
of F'. If F = Inv(u), then u is said to be the involution associated with F. 
Let F be any twisted composition algebra over l, with norm N. We have 
a (partial) analogue of Prop. 4.1.7. Let, as before, N(F)* to be the set of 
nonzero values of Non F, and M(N) the multiplier group of N. 
Proposition 4.2.5 N(F)* is a coset >...M(N) with N1/k(>...) E M(N). 
Proof. We represent F as in the preceding Proposition, via F' and u. We 
proceed as in the proof of Prop. 4.1.7, with a E F and b = a. We obtain 
a structure of composition algebra C' on F', with norm N = N(a) *2 N, 
and identity element e = (N(a) *2)-la *2 E F. Moreover, we have u(xy) = 
u(y)u(x) for x, y E C. Let v = Se 0 u. Then v is a T-linear automorphism of 
C' with fixed point set F. Now C' induces on F a structure of composition 
algebra C, with norm NIF. It follows that N(F)* = N(a) *2 M(N), and 
Nl/k(N(a)) = N(a) *2 N(a) E (N(a) *2)2M(N) = M(N). 
0 
Corollary 4.2.6 (i) If>... is as in the proposition, then N(F)..)* = M(N). 
(ii) If FJ.t ~ F, then J-l E k* M(N). 
Proof. The first point follows from the last equality of the proof. If FfJ, 
F, then N(FJ.t)* = N(F)*. Since the multiplier groups of Nand NJ.t are 
the same, it follows from the proposition that J-l *2 E M(N). But then J-l = 
N1/k(J-l)(J-l *2)-1 E k* M(N), proving the second point. 
0 
It can be shown that if F is a normal twisted octonion algebra over land 
()" (and charl =f. 2,3) the converse of (ii) is also true, see [KMRT, Th. (36.9)]. 
The proof is rather delicate. 
In view of the close connection between normal and nonnormal twisted 
composition algebras, one can expect properties of the former to be inherited 
by the latter. We give one identity, to be used later in Lemma 4.1.3. 
Lemma 4.2.7 In a twisted composition algebra F over a field of character-
istic =f. 2,3, the following identity holds for x E F, a E l: 
(ax+x *2) *2 = (T(x) -aN(x) +Trl/k(aN(x)))x+(a *2 -N(x))X*2. (4.34) 
Proof. In the normal case this follows from the formulas of Lemma 4.1.3. If 
F is nonnormal, work in the normal extension. 
0 
It would be rather natural to call a nonnormal twisted composition algebra 
F reduced if its normal extension F' is so. We prefer an apparently stronger 
definition; we will see in Th. 4.2.10 that these two definitions are in fact 
equivalent. 
If C is a composition algebra over k, we have over l' the normal twisted 
composition algebra F(k' @k C). Its underlying vector spaces is 

86 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
F' = l' ®k' (k' ®k C) = l' ®k C. 
On F' we have the r-linear automorphism u with u(e ®k x) = r(e) ® x (e E 
l', x E C). Let F = Inv( u). It is straightforward to check that F' and u 
are as in Prop. 4.2.4. By that Proposition we obtain a structure of twisted 
composition algebra on F. We denote this twisted composition algebra by 
F(C). 
Definition 4.2.8 A twisted composition algebra F over a field l of charac-
teristic =I- 2,3 is said to be reduced if there exist a composition algebra Cover 
k and A E l* such that F is isomorphic to the isotope F(C».. 
If l is cubic cyclic over k, then this boils down to the definition of 4.1.8. If 
F(C» .. is a nonnormal reduced twisted composition algebra over l, then its 
normal extension is F(C'):, .. with C' = k' ®k C. 
If F = F( C» .. is a reduced nonnormal composition algebra for land u, 
then 
F = (l ®k e) EB (lVD ®k Co), 
where D is the discriminant of lover k (so r(.fi5) = -.fi5) and Co = e.L in 
C. We have the following formulas for the squaring operation and the norm 
in F (where e,,,, E l, x E 0 0 ) : 
(e ® e + ",VD ® x) *2 = A(U(e)U2(e) - Du(",)u2(",)Nc(x)) ® e 
-AVD(u(e)u2(",) + u2(e)u(",)) ® x, 
N(e ® e + ",VD ® x) = U(A)U2(A)(e + ",2 DNc(x)). 
(4.35) 
(4.36) 
In Prop. 4.1.9 (ii) we saw that the automorphism group of a reduced normal 
twisted composition algebra F( C». is independent of A. The same holds for 
reduced nonnormal twisted composition algebras. 
Proposition 4.2.9 The automorphism group of the twisted composition al-
gebra F = F( C». does not depend on A. 
Proof. By Prop. 4.2.4, Aut(F) = {tiF It E Aut(F'), tu = ut}, where F' is the 
normal twisted composition algebra F( 0'». with 0' = k' ®k O. Now Aut(F') 
is independent of A, and the same holds for action on it of the involution u. 0 
Th. 4.1.10 on the characterization ofreduced normal twisted composition 
algebras carries over to the following result for the general case. 
Theorem 4.2.10 Let F be a twisted composition algebra over l, char(l) =I-
2,3, and let F' be its normal extension. The following conditions are equiva-
lent. 
(i) F is reduced. 
(ii) F' is reduced. 
(iii) T represents 0 nontrivially on F, i.e., there exists x =I- 0 in F such that 
T(x) = (x*2,x) = o. 
(iv) There exists x =I- 0 in F such that x *2 = AX for some A E l. 

4.2 Nonnormal Twisted Composition Algebras 
87 
Proof. We may assume that F is nonnormal. If F is reduced, then F' = 
F(C'h. with c' = k' ®k C and C as in Def. 4.2.8, so (i) implies (ii). If F' 
is reduced, T represents zero nontrivially on F' by Th. 4.1.10, hence so it 
does on F by the lemma below. Thus, (ii) implies (iii). If (iii) holds, then (iv) 
follows by the same argument as in the proof of Th. 4.1.10. 
Finally, assume (iv) holds. We follow the lines of the proof of the implica-
tion (iii) ::::? (i) in Th. 4.1.10, with some adaptations; we refer to that proof as 
to "the old proof". Choose x E F such that x *2 = Ax with A E i. If N(x) ::fi 0, 
we take e = x as in part (a) of the old proof. If N(x) = 0, we follow part 
(b) of that proof. We may assume that x ::fi 0, N(x) = 0 and x * x = O. Pick 
y E F with N (y) = 0 and (x, y) = -1. Then F' = x * F' + y * F'. 
We take again e = a2(a)x + x * y + y * x with a = (y, x * y). Notice that 
0'2 (a) = 0'2 ( ( y, x * y )) = (x, Y *2) E l 
and that x * y + y * x = (x + y) *2 _x*2 _y*2 E F, so e E F. In either case, 
whether N(x) equals zero or not, we have found e E F satisfying equations 
(4.10) and (4.11). Now proceeding as in step (c) and (d) of the old proof, 
one arrives at an l'-bilinear product and a new norm if which define on F' a 
structure of composition algebra over l' with identity element e; we call this 
6. As in step (e) of the old proof, we show that cp (as in the old proof) is a 
a-automorphism of 6 of order 3 which commutes with conjugation. 
Let U be the involution of F' associated with F. Straightforward compu-
tations show that U commutes with conjugation and that ucp = cp2u. From 
this it follows that u is a T-linear anti-automorphism of 6. We define by 
Ucr = cp and 
Ur(x) = u(x) 
(x E F') 
an isomorphism f! 
f-+ Ul! of Gal(l' jk) onto a subgroup of the group of 
semilinear automorphisms of 6 such that each ul! is a e-automorphism. As 
in step (f) of the old proof one proves that 
C = Inv( ul! I f! E Gal(l' jk) ) 
with the restriction of if as norm is a composition algebra over k which has 
the properties required by Def. 4.2.8. Thus, F is reduced.

We still owe the reader the lemma we used in the beginning of the above 
proof. 
Lemma 4.2.11 Let U be any vector space over a field k, T a cubic form 
on U, and k' a quadratic extension of k. 1fT represents zero nontrivially on 
U' = k' ®k U, then so it does on U itself 
Proof. Pick a basis 1, £ of k' over k and write the elements of U' as x + £y 
with x, y E U. Let T(x + £y) = 0 for some x + £y ::fi O. If y = 0 or if y ::fi 0 
and T(y) = 0, we are done. So let T(y) ::fi O. Consider the cubic polynomial 

88 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
T(x + Xy) E k[X]. This has a root c in the quadratic extension k' of k, so it 
must have a root a in k itself. Hence T(x + ay) = 0. If x + ay # 0, we are 
done. If x + ay = 0, we find 
T(x + cy) = T( -ay + cy) = (c - a)3T(y) # 0, 
a contradiction. 
o 
The following lemma will be used later. Let F be an arbitrary twisted 
composition algebra. The notations are as in Def. 4.1.1. 
Lemma 4.2.12 There exists a E F such that the following conditions are 
satisfied. 
(i) T(a) = (a*2,a) #0; 
(ii) a and a *2 are linearly independent over I; 
(iii) the restriction of ( , ) to the two-dimensional subspace la + la *2 is 
nondegenerate, or equivalently (provided (ii) holds), T(a)2 - 4NI/k(N(a)) # 
0. 
If N is isotropic, there exists isotropic a with T(a) # 0. Such an a also 
satisfies the conditions (ii) and (iii); moreover, a *2 is isotropic and satifies 
(i), (ii) and (iii), and we have (a *2) *2 = T(a)a and T(a *2) = T(a)2. 
Proof. If a and a *2 are linearly independent, ( , ) is degenerate on la \Bla *2 
if and only if 
i.e., if 
T(a)2 - 4NI/k(N(a)) = 0, 
so indeed the two conditions in (iii) are equivalent, provided (ii) holds. 
If F is not reduced, every nonzero a E F satifies (i) and (ii) by Th. 4.2.10. 
If N is isotropic, we choose a # ° with N(a) = 0, then (iii) also holds. 
For anisotropic N we argue as follows: if char(k) # 2, then no vector can 
be orthogonal to itself, so the bilinear form ( , ) is nondegenerate on any 
subspace; if char(k) = 2 and a # 0, then 
T(a)2 - 4NI/k(N(a)) = T(a)2 # 0. 
Now assume F reduced: F = F(C) .. for an octonion algebra Cover k 
and some>. E l*. Let D be a two-dimensional composition subalgebra of C. 
If we have a E D satisfying (i) and (ii) then (iii) must hold, too. For a E C 
we have 
a*2 = >.a2 = >.(-a+ (a,e)e)2 
= >.(a2 - 2( a, e)a + (a,e )2e) 
= >.( - (a,e)a+ ((a,e)2 - N(a))e), 
and 

4.3 Twisted Composition Algebras over Split Cubic Extensions 
89 
T(a) = (a *2, a) = NI/k(A)( a, e)( (a, e)2 - 3N(a)). 
The conditions (i) and (ii) together are equivalent to the following four con-
ditions: 
a ~ ke, (a,e) f= 0, (a,e)2 f= N(a), (a,e)2 f= 3N{a). 
If the restriction of N to D is isotropic, we pick a E D with (a, e) = 1 and 
N(a) = 0; this satisfies our conditions. If k is finite we may assume this to be 
the case. So we can now assume that k is infinite and N is anisotropic on D. 
The four conditions require a E D to lie outside a finite number of lines in 
D. Since k is infinite, such a exist. This proves the first part of the Lemma. 
Finally, let a with N(a) = 0 satisfy T(a) f= O. Since (a,a*2) = T(a) f= 0, 
(ii) must hold. Further, (iii) holds. From (4.34) we infer that (a *2) *2 = T(a)a, 
so T(a *2) = T(a)2 f= 0; further, N(a *2) = O. Hence a *2 is isotropic and 
satisfies (i), so also (ii) and (iii). 
0 
At the end of § 4.1 we gave some examples of fields over which every 
normal twisted composition algebra is reduced. These fields have the same 
property for arbitrary twisted composition algebras. This is clear for the case 
of finite fields: since every finite extension of a finite field is Galois, every 
twisted composition algebra over a finite field is normal. Over a complete, 
discretely valuated field with finite residue class field every twisted compo-
sition algebra is reduced; in the nonnormal case this follows from the above 
theorem by the same argument as used at the end of § 4.1 for the normal 
case. 
4.3 Twisted Composition Algebras over Split Cubic 
Extensions 
In this section we generalize the notion of twisted composition algebra to the 
situation where the cubic field extension llk is replaced by a direct sum of 
three copies of a field. This generalization will be used in the next section 
to determine the automorphism groups of eight-dimensional twisted compo-
sition algebras. These will turn out to be twisted forms of groups of type 
D4. 
The motivation for the generalization lies in the following situation. Con-
sider as in § 4.1 a normal twisted composition algebra F = (F, *, N) over a cu-
bic cyclic extension field 1 of k. Let K be an extension field of l; this is a split-
ting field of lover k, Le., an extension of k such that L = K 0kl ~ K$K$K. 
See Ch. I, § 16 (in particular ex. 2) in [Ja 64aJ. Denote the three primi-
tive idempotents in L by el, e2 and e3, so el = (1,0,0), etc. The action of 
the Galois automorphism a of lover k is extended K-linearly to L, i.e., as 
id 0a; it then induces a cyclic permutation of the primitive idempotents, say, 

90 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
O"(ei) = ei-l (indices to be taken mod 3) (cf. the proof of Th. 8.9 in [Ja 80]). 
The group < 0" > plays the role of "Galois group" of Lover K. 
Extend the vector space F over l to the free module FK = K ®k F over L, 
and the norm N, which is a quadratic form over l, to a quadratic form over L 
on FK, also denoted by N. Finally, extend the k-bilinear product * on F to 
a K-bilinear product * on FK. The conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Def. 4.1.1 
remain valid on FK. (Since (ii) involves polynomials of degree 4 over k, one 
has difficulties if k does not have at least five elements; these difficulties are 
avoided if one views N as a polynomial function on FK which is defined over 
k.) We thus arrive at a notion of twisted composition algebra over the split 
cubic extension L of K; we formalize this in the following definition. 
Definition 4.3.1 Let K be any field. By the split cubic extension of K we 
understand the K -algebra L = K EB K EB K. Call its primitive idempotents 
el = (1,0,0), e2 = (0,1,0) and e3 = (0,0,1). Fix the K-automorphism 0" 
of L by O"(ei) = ei-l (i = 1,2,3 mod 3). A twisted composition algebra over 
Land 0" is a free L-module F provided with a K-bilinear product * and a 
non-degenerate quadratic form N over L (this notion being defined in the 
obvious manner) such that the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Def. 4.1.1 hold. 
If l with char(l) i 2,3 is a cubic field extension of k which is not normal 
and F is a twisted composition algebra over l, we have a normal extension 
F' = l' ®zF, which we identify with k' ®kF. If now K is any field extension of 
l', we have again K®kl = K®k,l' = KEBKEBK (with obvious identifications of 
tensor products), and FK = K ®k F = K ®k' F' with the twisted composition 
algebra structure induced by that on F' is again a twisted composition algebra 
over the split extension L = K EB K EB K of K. 
The 3-cyclic group generated by 0" plays the role of "Galois group" of L 
over K. The formulas of Lemmas 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 remain valid in the situation 
of Def. 4.3.1; we will, in fact, only need (4.4) and (4.6). 
We now turn to an explicit determination of the structure of a twisted 
composition algebra F over L = K EB K EB K. It will turn out that F is 
the direct sum of three copies of a composition algebra Cover K, with the 
product * in F determined in a specific way by the product in C. 
Put Fi = eiF for i = 1,2,3; these are vector spaces over K, and we have 
a direct sum decomposition 
of vector spaces over K. The formulas in (i) of Def. 4.1.1 with .x = ei show 
that 
Fi * F ~ FH2 and F * Fi ~ FHl 
It follows that for 1 ~ i, j ~ 3, 
(i = 1,2,3). 
Fi*Fj=O (jii+l) and 
Fi*Fi+l~Fi+2. 

4.3 Twisted Composition Algebras over Split Cubic Extensions 
91 
For x E Fi we have 
So we can define Ni : Fi -+ K by 
It is readily verified that Ni is a nondegenerate quadratic form on the vector 
space Fi over K for i = 1,2,3. We denote the associated K-bilinear form by 
N i (, ). Formulas (ii) and (iii) of Def. 4.1.1 yield 
Ni+2(X * y) = Ni (x)Ni+1(Y) 
Ni(y * z, x) = Ni+l (z * x, y) 
(x E Fi , Y E Fi+l), 
(4.37) 
(x E Fi , Y E Fi+l' Z E Fi+2) (4.38) 
for i = 1,2,3. 
Put C = Fl' Take a E F3 with N3(a) :f. 0 and bE F2 with N2(b) :f. O. In 
the same way as in Lemma 4.1.4 we derive that the K-linear map /2 : C -+ 
F2, X ~ a * x, is bijective, and similarly for h : C -+ F3, X ~ X * b. 
We define a K-bilinear product on C by 
xy = (a * x) * (y * b) = /2(x) * h(Y) 
(x,y E C). 
(4.39) 
Using (4.4) and (4.6) one sees that e = N3(a)-1 N2(b)-I(b * a) is an identity 
element for this multiplication. Putting No(x) = N3(a)N2(b)NI(X) 
(x E 
C), we conclude from (4.37) that 
No(xy) = No(x)No(y) 
(X,yEC). 
Thus we have obtained on C a structure of composition algebra over K; we 
denote this by Ca,b(F). Set !I = id : C -+ Fl' We have constructed a K-linear 
bijection 
f = (!I,/2,/3): CEl1CEl1C -+ F, (Xl,X2,X3) ~ (!I(XI),/2(X2),h(X3)) 
(4.40) 
with !i(Xi) E Fi . Notice that F determines the norm of C up to a K*-
multiple, hence it determines C up to isomorphism by Th. 1.7.1. 
We encountered a similar situation in the proof of Prop. 4.1.6 (which we 
gave before stating the proposition itself). In the present case, too, F can have 
dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8 over L. Notice that the composition algebra structure 
on C determines the quadratic form N and the product * on F, provided the 
K-linear bijections /2 : C -+ F2 and h : C -+ F3 as well as N3(a) and N2(b) 
are given; to prove this, use (4.37), (4.38), (4.4) and (4.6). 
From any composition algebra Cover K we can construct a twisted com-
position algebra Fs(C) over L = K El1 K El1 K. As an L-module we take 
Fs(C) = C ffi C El1 C, the product and the norm are defined by

4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
(x,y,z) * (U,v,w) = (yw,zu,xy), 
N((x, y, z)) = (No(x), No(Y), No(z)) , 
with No denoting the norm of C. One easily verifies the conditions of 
Def. 4.1.1, keeping in mind that the "Galois automorphism" a acts on L by 
a((o:,;1,1')) = (;1,1',0:). Taking a = (0,0,1) and b = (0,1,0) we reconstruct 
C from Fs(C) as described above: C = Ca,b(Fs(C)). 
If we start from an arbitrary twisted composition algebra F over the split 
cubic extension L of K, and construct the composition algebra C = Ca,b(F) 
with the aid of a E F3 and b E F2 with N3(a) = N2(b) = 1 (provided these 
exist), then F ~ Fs(C). 
4.4 Automorphism Groups of Twisted Octonion 
Algebras 
Let F be a twisted octonion algebra, either normal over the cubic cyclic 
extension field l of k, or nonnormal over the separable but not Galois cubic 
extension field l of k; in the latter case we assume char k -I 2,3. Denote 
the automorphism group of F by Aut(F). An automorphism of a twisted 
composition algebra FK over a split cubic extension L of K is, of course, 
an L-linear bijection that preserves *; as in Lemma 4.1.5 one sees that it 
also leaves N invariant. The group of these automorphisms is denoted by 
Aut(FK ). If we take for K an algebraic closure of l', the automorphisms of 
FK = K ®k F form a algebraic group G. 
Now let K again be any extension field of l'. Let u be an automorphism 
of FK ; the L-linearity of u implies that it stabilizes every Fi . Let Ui be the 
restriction of u to Fi ; it is a K-linear bijection. As in the preceding section, 
let C be the octonion algebra Ca,b(F) over K defined by a E F3 and b E F2 
with N(a)N(b) -10. We have the linear bijection of (4.39) 
From (4.39) we infer that 
(x,y E C). 
(4.41 ) 
Define t = (tl, t2, t3) E GL(C)3 by t = r
1 0 u 0 I, i.e., ti = li- 1 0 Ui 0 Ii-
Since U preserves N, all ti lie in O(No). According to (4.41) and (4.39), they 
must satisfy the condition 
(x,y E C) 
(remember that h = id). This means that (tl. t2, t3) is a related triple of 
rotations of C (cf. the Principle of Triality, Th. 3.2.1), necessarily of spinor 
norm 1 (cf. § 3.2, in particular Prop. 3.2.2 and Cor. 3.3.3). Conversely, any 

4.4 Automorphism Groups of Twisted Octonion Algebras 
93 
related triple of rotations (tI, t2, t3) (necessarily of spinor norm 1) of C defines 
an automorphism u of FK as above. Thus we get an isomorphism between 
Aut(FK) and the group RT( C) ofrelated triples of rotations of CK (see § 3.6): 
<p : G ---- RT(C), u I-t f- I 0 U 0 f. 
( 4.42) 
Taking first K = l', we obtain a composition algebra Cover l'. Then taking 
for K the algebraic closure of l', we see that the algebraic groups G and 
RT(CK) are isomorphic. Now by Prop. 3.7.1 the group RT(CK) is defined 
over l'. Also, the isomorphism f of 4.40 is defined over l'. We thus obtain on G 
a structure of algebraic group over l'. By Prop. 3.6.3, RT( C K) is isomorphic 
to the spin group Spin(No). Thus we have shown the following result. 
Proposition 4.4.1 G is an algebraic group over l' which is isomorphic to 
Spin(8). 
We will see in Th. 4.4.3 that G is defined over k. 
In the rest of this section we take for K a separable closure ks of k 
containing l'. Then O'(No) = SO(No). For the case char(k) =I 2 this follows 
from the fact that ks contains all square roots of its elements, so all spinor 
norms are 1. In all characteristics, one can use a Galois cohomology argument, 
see [Sp 81, §12.3]. The Galois group Gal(ks/k) (which we understand to be 
the topological Galois group if ks has infinite degree over k) acts on ks®kl and 
on Fk s = ks ®k F by acting on the first factor. It permutes the idempotents ei 
and the components Fi ; thus we have a homomorphism a : Gal(ks/k) ---- 83 
such that 
,(ei) = e"('Y)(i) 
(y E Gal(ks/k)). 
Lemma 4.4.2 a(Gal(ks/k)) has order 3 if l is Galois over k, and order 6 if 
l is not Galois over k, so it equals the degree of l' over k. 
Proof. The invariants of Gal( ks / k) in ks ®k l form the field k ®k l = l, so every 
idempotent ei is displaced. This implies that a(Gal(ks/k)) has order at least 
3. The idempotents exist already in l' ®k l, which is invariant under Gal( ks / k), 
so their permutation is in fact accomplished by the action of Gal(l'/k), that 
is, a can be factored through a homomorphism a' : Gal(l'/k) ---- 83 . If l' = 
l, then Gal(l'/k) has order 3, so then la(Gal(ks/k))1 = 3. If l' =I l, then 
Gal( l' / k) ~ 83 and the kernel of a' in Gal( l' / k) is a normal subgroup of order 
at most 2, so it consists of the identity only, whence la(Gal(ks/k))1 = 6. 
0 
Over ks the octonion algebra Ck. = ks ®k C is split, so we may replace 
C = Ca,b(F) by the split octonion algebra. Thus we get from (4.42) an 
isomorphism, which we also call <p, of G(ks) onto RT(C)(ks), where C is 
the split octonion algebra over l. For, E Gal(ks/k) we have the conjugate 
isomorphism 'Y<p = ,0 <p 0 ,-I. Then z(')') = 'Y<p 0 <p-I is an automorphism of 
RT(C)(ks). This defines a nonabelian l-cocycle of Gal(ks/k) with values in 
RT(C)(ks) (see [Sp 81, § 12.3]). 

94 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
The automorphism zh') acts on RT(C)(ks) as 
zh') : (t1, t2, t3) ..... (t~(-y)(1)' t~(-y)(2)' t~(-y)(3»)' 
where a is the homomorphism of Gal(ks/k) into 83 as in the above lemma, 
and tj is the image of tj under some inner automorphism (depending on j) 
of SO(No). In case char(k) # 2, tj = tj if tj = ±1, so then zh') permutes the 
central elements (1, -1, -1) etc. of RT(C)(ks) in the same way as ah'-I) 
does; if char(k) = 2, a similar argument with central elements of the Lie 
algebra of RT works (see Prop. 3.6.4 and its proof). It follows that the image 
of zh') in Aut(RT(C))/Inn(RT(C)) ~ 83 is ah'-I). 
G is a ks-form of RT(C) which can be obtained by twisting RT(C) by 
the cocycle z (see [Sp 81, § 12.3.7]); it is defined over k. From Lemma 4.4.2 
we infer that it is of type 3D4 or 6D4 (see [Ti]) according to whether the cubic 
extension l/k is Galois or not. Thus we have proved the following theorem. 
Theorem 4.4.3 G is defined over k. If l is a cubic cyclic extension of k and 
F a normal twisted octonion algebra over l, then G is a twisted k-form of the 
algebraic group Spin(8) of type 3D4 . 
If l is cubic but not Galois over k with char(k) # 2 or 3, and F is a 
nonnormal twisted octonion algebra over l, then G is a twisted k-form of 
Spin(8) of type 6D4 . 
4.5 Normal Twisted Octonion Algebras with Isotropic 
Norm 
In this section, F will be a normal twisted octonion algebra over a cubic 
cyclic field extension l of k (and we will omit the adjective "normal" when 
speaking about twisted octonion algebras). 
From now on we fix a E F that satisfies the three conditions of Lemma 
4.2.12; if N is isotropic, we moreover assume a isotropic. We take E to be 
the orthogonal complement of la Ef) la * a, 
E = {x E C I (x, a) = (x, a * a) = O}. 
Lemma 4.5.1 E * a ~ E and a * E ~ E. 
Proof. If x E E, then x * a E E, for 
(x * a, a) = a( (a * a, x)) = 0, 
and by (4.1), 
Similarly for a * x. 
This allows us to define the a-linear transformation t in E by 
t : E ~ E, x ..... x * a.

Lemma 4.5.2 The transformation t : E -+ E satisfies 
and 
t2(x) = -(a*a) *x 
(x E E), 
t3(x) = -T(a)x - a * (a * (a * x)) 
t6 + T(a)t3 + NI/k(N(a)) = O. 
Proof. We compute, using Lemma 4.1.3, 
t2(x) = (x * a) * a = -(a * a) * x, 
t 3 (x) = - ( (a * a) * x) * a 
= (a * x) * (a * a) - a2 ( ( a * a, a ) )x 
(x E E), 
(4.45) 
(4.46) 
= -T(a)x-a*(a*(a*x)) 
(since (a*x,a) =a2((a*a,x}) =0), 
so 
t3(x) + T(a)x + a * (a * (a * x)) = o. 
Apply t 3 to both sides of this equation: 
t6(x) + T(a)t3(x) + [{(a * (a * (a * x))) * a} * a] * a = O. 
Since (a * y) * a = a2(N(a))y, the last term on the left hand side equals 
NI/k(N(a))x, so we get the formula. 
0 
We call a twisted composition algebra isotropic if its norm is isotropic. 
From now on we assume that F is an isotropic twisted octonion algebra 
(normal, as is the convention now). We take a as in Lemma 4.2.12 with 
N(a) = o. We define 
and 
Using Lemma 4.1.3 one easily verifies 
e1 * e1 = >'le2, 
e2 * e2 = >'2el. 
e1 * e2 = e2 * e1 = 0, 
with >'1 = T(a) E k* and >'2 = >'11. Further, 
N(e1) = N(e2) = 0 and (el. e2) = 1. 
A straightforward computation now yields

T(~le1 + ~2e2) = >'1 NI/k(6) + >'2 NI/k(~2). 
(4.52) 
Notice that replacing a by T(a)-la * a, which also satifies the conditions in 
Lemma 4.2.12 and is isotropic, amounts to interchanging e1 and e2 and also 
>'1 and >'2·

Define D = lel Ef) le2 and E = Dl.. The restriction of ( , ) to D and 
the restriction to E are both nondegenerate. Define as in (4.44) the a-linear 
transformations 
(4.53) 
From (4.45) we infer that 
t~(x) = -Aiei+l * x 
(x E E, indices mod 2). 
(4.54) 
Take Ei = ti(E). Trivially, ti(Ei) ~ Ei . Since N(ei) = 0, both Ei are totally 
isotropic, hence they have dimension :5 3. By (4.7), 
(e2 * x) * el + (el * x) * e2 = a2 (( el, e2 ))x = x. 
Since ei * E = t~+l(E) ~ E, it follows that E = El + E2. Since dimEi :5 3, 
we must have a direct sum decomposition: 
with both Ei having dimension 3. Using (4.7) again, we see for x E E, 
(x * el) * e2 + (e2 * et) * x = a2((x, e2 ))el = O. 
Since e2 * el = 0 by (4.50), we find that t2tl = o. Similarly, tlt2 = o. Hence 
(i # j), 
(4.55) 
and therefore 
ti(Ei) = Ei 
(i = 1,2). 
(4.56) 
It follows that Ei = t~(E), so by (4.54) 
(4.57) 
From (4.46) we know that 
t~(x) = -AiX - ei * (ei * (ei * x)). 
By (4.4), ei * Ei = ei * (E * ei) = 0, so 
(4.58) 
It follows that 7ri = -Ai+lt~ is the projection of Eon Ei . 
Since El and E2 are totally isotropic and ( , ) is nondegenerate on E, 
the Ei are in duality by the isomorphism 
where 
u: E2 --+ l, x 1-+ (u,x), 

4.5 Normal Twisted Octonion Algebras with Isotropic Norm

and similarly E2 ....... Ei. For Xi E Ei we have 
(4.59) 
for 
(h (Xl), t2(X2) ) = (Xl * el, X2 * e2) = 0"( ( el * (X2 * e2), xI)) = 0"( (Xl, X2 )), 
since by (4.54) el * (X2 * e2) = ->'lt~(t2(X2)) = ->'lt~(X2) = X2. This means 
that t2 = (ti) -1 and vice versa. 
We now compute Xl * X2 and X2 * Xl for Xi E Ei. We write Xi as Xi = 
ti(Zi) = Zi * ei with Zi E Ei and find 
Xl * X2 = (Zl * eI) * (Z2 * e2) 
= -((Z2 * e2) * ed * Zl + 0"2((Zl' Z2 * e2 ))el 
(by (4.7)). 
Xl * X2 = 0"2 ( (tll (Xl)' X2 ) )el 
= 0"( (Xl, t2(X2) ) )el 
(by (4.59)). 
Similarly for X2 * Xl. Thus, 
(4.60) 
Next consider X * Y for x, y EEl. We have 
(X * y, e2 ) = 0"( (y * e2, X)) = 0, 
since El * e2 = t2(El) = o. So X * Y E E. Using (4.5) we find 
since (x * el, el ) = o. Also, 
Now using (4.54) and (4.58), we find 
tl(X) *tl(Y) = ->'lt~(->'lt~(X*Y)) = ->'lt2(X*Y), 
and similarly with t2 and x, Y E E2 . Thus, 
(X,y E EJ

An immediate conclusion is that 
(4.62) 
To describe the multiplication of elements of Ei it is convenient to intro-
duce a bilinear product 
(i = 1,2) 
by defining 
Xi /\Yi = til(Xi) *ti(Yi) 
(Xi,Yi E Ei). 
(4.63) 
From (4.61) it is immediate that 
ti(Xi) /\ ti(Yi) = -Aiti+I(Xi /\ Yi) 
(Xi, Yi E Ei). 
(4.64) 
This wedge product is alternating. For if X E E I , then 
X /\ X = (e2 * x) * (x * el) 
(by (4.54) and (4.58)) 
= -((x*el)*x)*e2 
(by (4.7), since (e2,x*et) =0) 
= N(x)(el * e2) 
(by (4.6)) 
= 0 
(since N(x) = 0, or el * e2 = 0), 
and similarly for x E E2 . By linearizing one finds 
x /\ Y = -Y /\ x 
(x, Y E Ei , 
i = 1,2). 
(4.65) 
For this wedge product we can prove the formulas that are well known for 
the vector product (cross product) in three-space. 
Lemma 4.5.3 For Xi, Yi E Ei, (i = 1,2), one has 
(XI/\YI) /\X2 = (XI,X2)YI - (Yt,X2)XI, 
(4.66) 
(X2/\Y2) /\XI = (X2,Xt}Y2 - (Y2,Xt}X2, 
(4.67) 
(Xl /\ Yt, X2/\ Y2) = (Xl, X2)( YI, Y2) - (Xl, Y2)( X2, yt}. 
(4.68) 
Further, Xi /\ Yi = 0 for all Yi (or for all Xi) implies Xi = 0 (Yi = 0, respec-
tively), (i = 1,2). 
Proof. From (4.63) we get 
(XI/\ YI) /\ X2 = t21(f[I(XI) * tl(yt}) * t2(X2) 
= -AI(t12(xt} * YI) * t2(X2) 
(by (4.61)) 
= (tl(XI) * YI) * t2(X2) 
(by (4.58).) 
Now by (4.7) and (4.59), 

4.6 A Construction of Isotropic Normal Twisted Octonion Algebras 
99 
(tl(Xl) * Yl) * t2(X2) + (t2(X2) * yd * tl(Xl) = 0'2(( tl(Xl), t2(X2) ))Yl 
= (Xl,X2 )Yl, 
and by (4.59) and (4.60), 
t2(X2) * Yl = 0'( (tl(Yl), t2(X2)) )e2 = 0'2( (Yb X2) )e2. 
Using these relations, we find 
(tl(xd * Yl) * t2(X2) = -(t2(X2) * Yl) * tl(Xl) + (Xl, X2 )Yl 
= - ( Yl, X2 )( e2 * tl (Xl)) + (Xl, X2 )Yl 
= -(Yl,X2)Xl + (Xl,X2)Yl 
(by (4.54) and (4.58)). 
This proves the first formula, and the same argument leads to the second 
one. 
For the third formula we proceed as follows: 
(Xl 1\ Yl, X2 1\ Y2) = (ti"l(Xl) * tl (yd, t2'1(X2) * t2(Y2) ) 
= (-A2)( -Al)( t2(ti"2(Xl) * yd, tl(t2'2(X2) * Y2)) 
= 0'( (tl (Xl) * Yb t2(X2) * Y2)) 
= (Y2, (tl(Xl) * yd * t2(X2))' 
Now (tl(Xl) * Yl) * t2(X2) was computed above; substituting that expression 
we find formula (4.68). 
The last statement of the Lemma is easily derived from (4.66) and 
(4.67).

Define an alternating trilinear function ( , , ) on Ei by 
(X,y,z) = (x,yl\z). 
From 4.59 and 4.64 we obtain 
4.6 A Construction of Isotropic Normal Twisted 
Octonion Algebras 
(4.69) 
We maintain the convention that all twisted composition algebras are nor-
mal. The analysis made in the previous section leads to a construction of 
isotropic twisted octonion algebras, to be described in the present section. 
This construction will yield all such algebras. 
We first discuss some generalities. Let V be a three-dimensional vector 
space over the field l and V' its dual space. The bilinear pairing between V 

100 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
and V' is denoted by ( , ). There is a vector product A on V with values 
in V', and one on V' with values in V with the following three properties 
(where x, y E V, x', y' E V') : 
(x Ay) AX' = (x,x')y - (y,x')x, 
(x' Ay') Ax = (x,x')y' - (x,y')x', 
(x' A y', x A y) = (x, x' ) ( y, y') - (x, y' ) ( y, x' ). 
(4.70) 
(4.71) 
(4.72) 
Using these properties, one easily verifies that x A y is alternating bilinear on 
V, nonzero if x and yare linearly independent, and that (x, y, z) = (x, Y A z ) 
is an alternating trilinear function on V (Le., invariant under even permuta-
tions of the variables and changing sign under odd permutations); similarly on 
V'. On a three-dimensional space, an alternating trilinear function is unique 
up to a nonzero factor, viz., it is a multiple of the determinant whose columns 
are the coordinate vectors of the three variables with respect to some fixed 
basis. It follows that the vector products on V and on V' are unique up to 
multiplication by some 0: E l* and 0:- 1, respectively. 
If t : V -t V is a a-linear transformation, where 0' is an automorphism of l, 
then another alternating trilinear function of x, y, z is a-1( (t(x), t(y), t(z))). 
Hence it is a multiple of (x,y,z). We define det(t) E l by 
(t(x), t(y), t(z)) = det(t)a( (x, y, z)) 
(x,y,z E V). 
If we replace the wedge product x A yon V by o:x A y, so ( , , ) by 0:( , , ), 
then det(t) changes to 0:0'(0:)-1 det(t). We call det(t) the determinant of t 
with respect to the given choice of the wedge product (or the choice of the 
alternating trilinear form). 
Let t' be the inverse adjoint transformation of t in V', Le., 
(t(x),t'(x')) =a«(x,x')) 
(x E V, 
x' E V'). 
t' is also a-linear. 
Lemma 4.6.1 For x, y E V we have 
t(x) A t(y) = det(t)t'(x A y). 
(4.73) 
Moreover, det(t') = det(t)-I. 
Proof. The first formula follows from the equations 
(z, (t')-I(t(X) A t(y))) = a2( (t(z), t(x) A t(y))) = a2( (t(z), t(x), t(y))) = 
a 2(det(t))( z, x A y). 
Similarly, we have for x', y' E V' 
t'(x') A t'(y') = det(t')t(x' A y'). 

4.6 A Construction of Isotropic Normal Twisted Octonion Algebras 
101 
Using (4.70) and the definition of det(t) we see that 
(t(x) /\ t(y)) /\ (t(X1) /\ t(Y1)) = det(t)t((x /\ y) /\ (Xl /\ yd), 
which by what we already proved equals 
det(t)2(t'(x /\ y) /\ t'(X1/\ Y1)). 
It follows that 
t'(x') /\ t'(y') = det(t)-lt(x' /\ y'), 
where x' = x /\ y, y' = Xl /\ Y1. Since any element of V' is a wedge product 
of elements of V, the last formula holds for arbitrary x', y' E V'. The second 
assertion of the lemma follows.

Now assume that l is, as before, a cubic cyclic extension of the field 
k, and that a is a generator of the Galois group. Assume that t is a 0'-
linear transformation of V such that t3 = -A with A E k*. We also assume 
that the vector product on V is such that det(t) = -A. This can always be 
arranged. For if not, then Nl/k( -A -1 det(t)) = 1, as one sees by computing 
(t 3(x),t3(y),t3(z)) in two different ways. By Hilbert's Theorem 90 there 
exists a E l such that det(t) = -Aa- 1O'(a). Replacing the vector product 
x /\ y on V by ax /\ y changes the determinant of t to det(t) = -A. Our 
assumption determines the vector product on V up to a multiplicative factor 
p E k* and the vector product on V' up to p-1. For the inverse adjoint 
transformation t' we have t'3 = _A-1 and det(t') = _A-1. 
V and t are the ingredients of the construction of a (normal) twisted 
composition algebra F(V, t). We are guided by the results of the preceding 
section. Taking (with the notations of 4.5) V = E 1 , V' = E 2 , t = t1 the 
definition of F(V, t) is explained by the formulas of that section. 
We define F = F(V, t) = l EB l EB V EB V' and put e1 = (1,0,0,0), e2 = 
(0,1,0,0). We define a product * in F as follows: 
(6e1 + 6e2 + x + x') * (1]le1 + 1]2e2 + y + y') = 
{A -10'(6)0'2(1]2) + 0'( (x, t'(y')) )}e1 + {AO'(6)O'2(1]1) + 0'( (t(y), x') )}e2 + 
O'(6)t-1(y) + O'2(1]dt(x) + t'(x') /\ (t')-l(y') + 
O'(6)(t')-1(y') + O'2(1]2)t'(X') + t(x) /\ C 1(y). 
(4.74) 
for f.i,1]i E l, x,y E V, x',y' E V'. We further define the norm N on F by 
N(6e1 + f.2e2 + x + x') = 66 + (x,x') 
(4.75) 
for f.i E l, x E V and x' E V'. 
Theorem 4.6.2 With this product and norm F(V, t) is an isotropic twisted 
octonion algebra, and all such algebras are of this form. For z = 6el +6e2 + 
x + x' the cubic form T(z) = (z * z, z) is given by

Proof. It is clear that the product * is a-linear in the first variable and 0'2_ 
linear in the second variable. The verification of the other two requirements 
for a twisted composition algebra (cf. Def. 4.1.1), viz., 
N(x * y) = a(N(x))a2(N(y)) 
(x,y E F) 
and 
(x,y,z E F), 
and the computation of T are straightforward, so we omit them. That we ob-
tain all twisted composition algebras with isotropic norm in this way, follows 
from the analysis in the preceding section.

4.7 A Related Central Simple Associative Algebra 
We continue to consider an isotropic twisted octonion algebra F = F(V, t). 
Notations and conventions are as in the preceding section. We introduce the 
associative algebra Dover k consisting of all transformations of V of the form 
(We write 1 for the identity here.) We show that this is a cyclic crossed 
product. (For crossed products, see [AI 61, Ch. V], [ArNT, Ch. VIII, §§ 4 
and 5] or [Ja 80, §§ 8.4 and 8.5].) The notation D is used since in the most 
important case for us it is a division algebra. 
Lemma 4.7.1 The elements 1, t and t2 form a basis of D over I, and D is 
isomorphic to the cyclic crossed product (I, a, -"\), so it is a central simple 
algebra of degree 3 over k. If,.\ E Nl/k(l*), this crossed product is isomorphic 
to the algebra M3(k) of 3 x 3 matrices over k, and if"\ tj Nl/k(l*), it is a 
division algebra. 
Proof. If 
~o + 6t + 6t2 = 0 
with ~i E I, then for all X E V and 'T/ E I we have 
Since the automorphisms 1, a, 0'2 are linearly independent over I, it follows 
that all ~i are zero. So 1, t, t2 is a basis of D over I. 
The cyclic crossed product (I, a, -,.\) is the algebra generated by l and an 
element u such that u3 = -,.\ and u~ = a(~)u (~ E I). It has dimension 3

over t. Clearly, there is a homomorphism (t, (1, ->.) -+ D sending u to t and 
extending the identity map of t. Since D has dimension 3 the homomorphism 
is bijective, hence is an isomorphism. The crossed product is known to be 
isomorphic to M3(k) if ->. E Nl/k(l*) and to be a division algebra if -A ¢ 
Nl/k(l*). We may omit the minus sign, since NI/k(-I) = -1.

Lemma 4.7.2 There exists Vo E V such that V = D.vo. 
Proof. If D is a division algebra, we can pick any nonzero Vo E V. For then 
D.vo is a nine-dimensional subspace of V over k, which must coincide with 
V. 
If D is not a division algebra we have D ~ M3(k). As a D-module, V 
is isomorphic to the direct sum of three copies of the simple module k3 of 
M3(k). But then the D-module V is isomorphic to D, viewed as a left module 
over itself. We can then take for Vo the image in V of any invertible element 
of D.

On the central simple algebra Dover k, one has the reduced norm, see 
[AI 61, Ch. VIII, § 11], [Schar, Ch. 8, § 5] or [Weil, Ch. IX, § 2]. It is the unique 
polynomial function on D which upon extension of k to a splitting field of 
D becomes the determinant. It is multiplicative, i.e., ND(UV) = ND(u)ND(V) 
for u, v ED, and u is invertible if and only if N D (u) i= O. The following 
lemma gives a simple characterization of the reduced norm. 
Lemma 4.7.3 If A is a central simple algebra of degree n over k, then the 
reduced norm NA is the unique homogeneous polynomial function of degree n 
on the vector space A over k with NA(I) = 1 which satisfies the conditions: 
x E A is invertible if and only if N A (x) i= 0 and there exists a homogeneous 
polynomial map P : A -+ A of degree n - 1 such that 
(x E A, NA(X) i 0). 
Proof. For A = Mn(k) it is known that x E A is invertible if and only 
det(x) i= 0, and then x- 1 = det(x)-l adj(x), where adj(x) is the adjoint 
matrix of x, i.e., the matrix whose entries are the cofactors of x (see, e.g., 
[Ja 74, § 2.3]). As to the uniqueness of N A , let N~ with N~(1) = 1, in 
combination with pI also satisfy the conditions. Then N~(x) i 0 if and only 
if det(x) i= 0, and 
det(x)pl(x) = adj(x)N~ (x) 
(x E A, det(x) i 0). 
Since det is an irreducible polynomial in the entries of the matrix x (see, e.g., 
[Ja 74, Th. 7.2]), either det divides all entries of adj (viewed as a matrix with 
polynomial entries), or det divides NA. The first case being absurd, we must 
have N~ = det. 

104 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
In the case of an arbitrary central simple algebra A, work with a Galois 
splitting field m of A, i.e., with a Galois extension m of k such that m®k A ~ 
Mn(k). We have a reduced norm NA over m. For any a E Gal(mjk), let a(NA) 
denote the polynomial obtained by the action of a on the coefficients of NA. 
Then a(NA) also satisfies the conditions for a reduced norm on m®kA, so by 
the uniqueness of this, a(NA) = NA. This means that NA has its coefficients 
in k, and hence its restriction to A is a reduced norm on A. The uniqueness 
of the reduced norm on A is immediate from the fact that its extension to 
m ®k A is a reduced norm on the latter algebra.

With the aid of the above lemma it is not hard to compute the reduced 
norm on D explicitly. (The proof can, in fact, be adapted to any crossed 
product.) 
Lemma 4.7.4 The reduced norm of u = eo + el t + 6t2 in D is 
Nv(u) = NI/k(eO) - ), NI/k(6) + ),2 NI/k(6) +), TrI/k(eOa(el)a2(6)). 
This can also be written as Nv(u) = det(Au), where Au is the matrix 
( eo -),a(6) -)'a2(6)) 
Au = 
6 a(eo) -),a2(6) 
. 
6 
a(6) 
a2(eo) 
Proof. An element u = eo + 6t + 6t2 has an inverse if and only if the 
right multiplication by u, i.e., v 1--+ VU, is bijective. This right multiplication 
is a linear transformation over l which has matrix Au as above. Hence u 
is invertible if and only if det(Au) -# 0, and then u- 1 is the solution v of 
Auv = 1, so of the form det(Au)-l P(u). A straightforward computation 
yields that 
det(Au) = NI/k(eO) - ),NI/k(6) + ),2 NI/k(6) +), TrI/k(eoa(eda2(6)). 
So det(Au) E k and it is a cubic polynomial in coordinates over k. P is a 
map D -+ D that is quadratic in coordinates over k. 
0 
In exactly the same way as we did with D we introduce the associative 
algebra D' of l-linear combinations of 1, t' and t'2, acting on V'. This has 
the same properties as D except that t,3 = -)'-I, so in the formulas for the 
reduced norm one must replace ), by ),-1. We call D' the opposite algebra of 
D, a name which is justified by the fact that D and D' are anti-isomorphic 
as we will see in the following Lemma. 
Lemma 4.7.5 The mapping 
D -+ D', u = eo + 6t + 6t2 1--+ U' = eo - ),a(6)t' - ),a2(el)t'2 
is an anti-isomorphism of D onto D'. It preserves the reduced norm: 
(u ED). 

4.8 A Criterion for Reduced Twisted Octonion Algebras. Applications 
105 
Proof. Both statements are verified by straightforward explicit computation 
in the coordinates ~o, 6, 6. Notice that we can also write u' = ~o + (t')- 16 + 
(t,)-26. 
0 
We now return to the twisted composition algebra F(V, t) of §4.6. 
Lemma 4.7.6 (i) The nonzero values of the reduced norm ND on D form a 
subgroup N(D)* of k*. We have N(D')* = N(D)*. 
(ii) For v E V we have T(v) # 0 if and only if V = D.v. Then T(u.v) = 
ND(u)T(v) for U E D, so the nonzero values of T on V form a coset of 
N(D)* in k*. 
(iii) Similarly, the nonzero values of T on V' form a coset of N(D)* in k*. 
Proof. N D is multiplicative, and N D (u) # 0 if and only u is invertible, so 
the nonzero values of N D form a subgroup of k*. The second point of (i) 
follows from the preceding lemma. According to Th. 4.6.2, the value of T( v) 
for v E V is 
T(v) = _,\-l( v, t(v), t2(v)). 
Pick Vo E V such that V = D.vo (d. Lemma 4.7.2). Write 
Then 
T(v) = det(X)T(vo), 
where X is the matrix which expresses v, t(v), t 2(v) in vo, t(vo), t 2(vo): 
From Lemma 4.7.4 we infer that det(X) = ND(u) with u = ~o + 6t + 6t2 . 
Thus we find that T(v) = T(vo)ND(U). We see that T(v) # 0 if and only if u 
is invertible, which implies the first assertion of (ii). This proves (ii). 
(iii) is proved in the same way, also using (i).

4.8 A Criterion for Reduced Twisted Octonion 
Algebras. Applications 
In Th. 4.1.10 we gave criteria for a normal twisted composition algebra to be 
reduced. The following theorem can be viewed as a sharpening of part (ii) 
of Th. 4.1.10. Let F = F(V, t) be as in Th. 4.6.2. Notations and conventions 
are as before. 

106 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
Theorem 4.8.1 The isotropic twisted octonion algebra F is reduced if and 
only if there exists x E V, xi- 0, and U E D such that T(x) = ND(U). 
Proof. First assume there exists x E V, x i- 0, and U E D such that T(x) = 
ND(u). If T(x) = 0, then F is reduced by Th. 4.1.10. If T(x) = ND(U) i- 0, 
then by Lemma 4.7.6 ND(U) E T(a)N(D)* for some a E V, so T(a) E N(D)*. 
It follows that there exists y E V with T(y) = 1. Now (y * y, y) = T(y) = 1, 
whereas (y, y) = 0 (since N is identically zero on V by (4.75)), so y and y*y 
are linearly independent. Hence z = y + y * y i- 0 and 
z * z = (y + y * y) * (y + Y * y) 
= y * y + y * (y * y) + (y * y) * y + (y * y) * (y * y) 
= y * y + a(N(y))y + a2(N(y))y + T(y)y - N(y)y * y 
= y* y +y = z. 
Again we conclude by Th. 4.1.10 that F is reduced. 
Conversely, assume F reduced. We are going to show the existence of 
x and U with the required properties. Since F is reduced there exists by 
Th. 4.1.10 a nonzero z = e1e1 + 6e2 + x + x' E F with ei E l, x E V and 
x' E V' such that z * z = o:z for some 0: E l. By Th. 4.6.2 this amounts 
to saying that the following system of equations has a nontrivial solution 
(6,6,x,x',0:): 
A -la(6)a2(6) + a( (x, t'(x') )) = 0:6 
(4.77) 
),a(6)a2(6) +a«t(x),x')) = 0:6 
(4.78) 
a(6)r1(x) + a2(e1)t(X) + t'(x') 1\ (t')-l(X') = o:x 
(4.79) 
a(6)(t,)-1(x') + a2(6)t'(x') + t(x) 1\ r1(x) = o:x'. 
(4.80) 
(a) We first consider the case that there is a solution with x i- O. We compute 
T(x) = (x, t(x) 1\ r 1(x) ). 
Using (4.80) we get 
T(x) = 0:( x, x') - a(6)( x, (t,)-l(x')) - a2(6)( x, t'(x')). 
Applying a2 to both sides of (4.77) and then multiplying the result bya2(e2) 
yields 
Further, 
a(6) (x, (t')-l(x') ) = a(6)a2( (t(x), x')) 
= a(o:e16) - ANl/k(6) 
(by (4.78)). 
With these formulas we find 

4.8 A Criterion for Reduced Twisted Octonion Algebras. Applications 
107 
T(x) = >. NI/k(6) + >. -1 NI/k(6) - 0'(0:66) - 0'2(0:66) + 0:( X, x'). (4.81) 
If 0: = 0, then T(x) = ND(U) with u = -6t + >.-16t2 by Lemma 4.7.4. 
For the rest of case (a) assume that 0: of 0. By (4.11) we have N(z) = 
0'(0:)0'2(0:). Since N(z) = ~16 + (x,x') we find that 
(x,x') =0'(0:)0'2(0:) -66. 
Inserting this into in (4.81) we find 
T(x) = NI/k(O:) + >. NI/k(6) + >. -1 NI/k(6) -
TrI/k(0:~16) = ND(U), 
where U = 0: -
0'2(~1)t + >.-10'(6)t2. 
(b) Now assume we have a solution (6,6,0, x', 0:) of the system of equations 
(4.77)-(4.80) with 6 of 0. From (4.77) we infer that also 0: of ° 
and 6 of 0. 
Multiplying the opposite sides of (4.77) and (4.78), we get 
0:>.-1 NI/k(6) = 0:>. NI/k(6), 
>.-2 = NI/k(6~21), 
>. = NI/k(>'6~21). 
This implies that the cyclic crossed product D is isomorphic to the matrix 
algebra M3(k). Hence ND(U) runs over all elements of kif U runs over D, so 
for any nonzero x E V there is U E D with T(x) = ND(U). 
(c) Finally, let there be a nonzero solution of the form 
(~1J 0, 0, x', 0:). 
By (4.78) we have 6 = 0. By (4.79), t'(x') !\ t'-l(X') = 0. This is only 
possible if t'(x') = ~x' for some ~ E l. Since t' is a-linear and t'3 = ->.-1, we 
find by computing t'3(x') that >.-1 = Nl/k( -~). So again>. E Nl/k(l*) and 
we can complete the proof as in case (b). 
0 
We mention, in particular, the following consequence, which we will use 
in Ch. 8. 
Corollary 4.8.2 If F is not reduced, then D is a division algebra. 
Proof. If D is not a division algebra, then D ~ M3(k). In that case the 
reduced norm ND takes all values in k, so for any nonzero x E V there exists 
U E D such that ND(U) = T(x). Hence F is reduced by Th. 4.8.1. 
0 
As an application of the above theorem we can give another class of 
special fields k over which all twisted octonion algebras are reduced. We 
assume char(k) of 2,3. 
Theorem 4.8.3 Assume that k has the following property: If A is a nine-
dimensional central simple algebra A whose center k' is either k or a quadratic 
extension of k, then N A (A) = k'. Let further l be a cubic extension of k. Then 
every twisted octonion algebra over land 0' (as in Def. 4.2.1) is reduced. 

108 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
Proof. Let F be a twisted octonion algebra over land 0". If the norm N of 
F is isotropic, we take k' = k, and if N is anisotropic, we choose a quadratic 
extension k' of k which makes N isotropic. Extend 1 to a cubic cyclic exten-
sion l' of k', with 0" (extended to a k'-automorphism of l') as generator of 
Gal(l' /k'). In either case, F' = k' ®k F is a twisted octonion algebra over l' 
of the form described in Th. 4.6.2. The reduced norm of l'[t] takes all values 
in k'; if l'[t] is a division algebra over k', this follows from the assumption 
we made about the reduced norm on nine-dimensional division algebras over 
k', and if l'lt] ~ M3(k'), this is always the case. By the previous theorem, F' 
is reduced. By Th. 4.1.10 this is equivalent to the fact that the cubic form 
T represents zero nontrivially on F'. By Lemma 4.2.11, T already represents 
zero nontrivially on F. That implies that F is reduced. 
D 
Here are some examples of fields with the property of the theorem. 
(i) k an algebraic number field 
If D is a central simple algebra over a field k, then the nonzero reduced norms 
of elements of D form a subgroup N(D)* of k*. Let SLD be the norm one 
group of D, Le. the group of elements of DK with reduced norm 1. This is a 
an algebraic group over k. Then the quotient group k* /N(D)* can be identi-
fied with the Galois cohomology set Hl(k,SLD ) (see [Se 64, Ch. III, § 3.2]). 
The reduced norm map will be surjective if and only if the Galois cohomol-
ogy set is trivial. That this is indeed the case if k is an algebraic number 
field and D is nine-dimensional follows from the Hasse principle (see [loc.cit., 
§ 4.7, Remarque 1]). This shows that a number field k has the property of the 
previous theorem. Hence over such a field any twisted composition algebra is 
reduced. 
(ii) As in case (vi) of § 1.10 perfect fields with cohomological dimension 
~ 2 also have the required property, as follows from [loc.cit., Ch. III, § 3.2]. 
Examples are finite fields and p-adic fields. 
4.9 More on Isotropic Normal Twisted Octonion 
Algebras 
This section gives some complements to the material of § 4.5 and § 4.6. We 
prove two somewhat technical lemmas that will be used in Ch. 8. Let F be an 
isotropic normal twisted octonion algebra and consider an isotropic element 
a E F with T(a) f. OJ then a and a * a are linearly independent and the 
restriction of ( , ) to la E!) la * a is nondegenerate (see Lemma 4.2.12). The 
corresponding subspaces E = (la E9la * a).l as in (4.43) and Ei = ti(E) 
(i = 1,2) with ti as in (4.53) will now be denoted by E(a) and Ei(a), since 
we are going to vary a: 

4.9 More on Isotropic Normal Twisted Octonion Algebras 
109 
E(a) = (la EBla * a)l., 
El(a) = {x*a!(x,a) = (x,a*a) =O}, 
E2(a) = {x * (a * a)! (x, a) = (x, a * a) = O}. 
By (4.57), we also have 
El ( a) = { (a * a) * x ! (x, a) = (x, a * a) = ° }, 
E2(a) = {a*x! (x,a) = (x,a*a) = O}. 
Since (a * a) * (a * a) = T(a)a by (4.8), Ei(a * a) = Ei+l(a). By (4.4) and 
(4.6), a * (a * a) = (a * a) * a = 0, hence we can also write 
El (a) = {x * a ! (x, a * a) = ° }, 
E2(a) = {a * x! (x, a * a) = O}. 
Recall that El (a) and E2 (a) are totally isotropic subspaces which are in 
duality with respect to ( , ). 
Lemma 4.9.1 Let a, bE F be isotropic with T(a)T(b) =I=- 0. Then b E El(a) 
if and only if a E E2(b). 
Proof. Let b E El(a). By (4.56), we may assume that b = x*a with x E El(a). 
Pick z E E2(a) with (x, z) = 1. According to (4.62), b * b E E2(a), so 
(z, b * b) = 0. From (4.7) it follows: 
b * z = (x * a) * z = -(z * a) * x + a2( (x, z) )a. 
By (4.55), z * a = 0. Hence a = b * z E E2(b). 
The proof of the converse implication is similar. 
o 
Lemma 4.9.2 Assume again a, bE F to be isotropic with T(a)T(b) =I=- O. If 
a * b = 0, then E2(a) n El(b) =I=- O. 
Proof. We may assume that F = F(V, t) is as in Th. 4.6.2 with el = a, e2 = 
T(a)-la*a, V = El(a) and V' = E2(a) (see the part of § 4.5 beginning with 
equation (4.47». Using the multiplication rule (4.74) it is straightforward to 
see that a * b = ° 
implies that b = ae2 + v, with a E k, v E V. If v = 0, then 
b is a nonzero multiple of e2 and El(b) = E2(a), proving the lemma in that 
case. So we may assume that v =I=- 0. Then 
b * b = A -la(a)a2(a)el + a(a)C1(v) + t(v) 1\ C1(v). 
Take z E V, with (z, t(v) 1\ rl(v») = 0, z ¢ kt(v), then 
(z,b*b) = (z,t(v)I\C1(v») =0, 
and z * b is a nonzero multiple of t(z) 1\ t-1(v) which lies in V' n El(b) = 
E2(a) n El(b).

4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
4.10 Nonnormal Twisted Oct onion Algebras with 
Isotropic Norm 
In this section we briefly discuss analogues of the results of § 4.5 and § 4.6 
in the case of a nonnormal twisted octonion algebra. We use the notations of 
Def. 4.2.1. So l is a non-cyclic cubic extension of k. Assume that char(k) -# 
2,3. Let F be a twisted composition algebra over l and a and assume that 
the norm N is isotropic. The normal extension F' = l' ®l F of F, introduced 
in Prop. 4.2.2, is an isotropic normal twisted composition algebra over l', and 
U = r ® id defines a r-linear anti-automorphism of F /, by Prop. 4.2.4. 
Take a E F with the properties of Lemma 4.2.12. Then a and a *2 are 
fixed by u. We carry out the analysis of § 4.5 for a, with F' instead of F. 
Notations being as in that section, we have for x E F' . 
u(x * a) = a * u(x), u(x * a *2) = a *2 *u(x). 
It follows that for x E Ei 
u(X * ei) = ei * x. 
Using (4.54) we see that u induces a r-linear bijection Ei -+ Ei+l. From 
(4.58) we find that for x E Ei 
(4.82) 
and from (4.63) it then follows that 
U(Xi 1\ Yi) = U(Yi) 1\ U(Xi) (Xi' Yi E Ei). 
(4.83) 
Next, (4.60) implies that 
(Xl. t2(X2) ) = ar( (U(X2), (t2 0 U)(Xl) )), 
and using (4.82) 
(Xl. X2) = ar( ( (u 0 t2"1)(X2), (t2 0 U)(Xl)) ) = ar( (tl (U(X2)), t2(U(Xl)) )), 
whence 
(U(X2), U(Xl)) = r( (Xl. X2)). 
(4.84) 
From (4.83) and (4.84) we deduce that for x, y, z E Ei 
(u(x), u(y), u(z) ) = -r( (x, y, z)), 
where the alternating trilinear form ( , , ) is as at the end of § 4.5. 
The properties of U which we just established indicate how to modify the 
construction of § 4.6 in order to deal with nonnormal twisted composition 
algebras. The notations are as in the beginning of the chapter. Assume we 
are given a normal twisted composition algebra F' = F(V, t) over l' and a. 

4.10 Nonnormal Twisted Octonion Algebras with Isotropic Norm 
111 
Definition 4.10.1 A hermitian involution of (V, t) is a T-linear bijection 
t : V --t V' with the following properties: 
(i) (x,t(y)) = T«(y, t(x))) (x,y E V). 
(ii) tot = (t,)-1 0 t. 
(iii) t-1(x 1\ y) = t(y) 1\ t(x). 
Using (4.72) one finds by the same kind of argument as used in the proof of 
Lemma 4.6.1 that we also have 
(iii)' t(x' 1\ y') = t -1 (y') 1\ t -1(x') (x', y' E V'). 
The next theorem is the analogue of 4.6.2 for nonnormal twisted compo-
sition algebras. 
Theorem 4.10.2 Let t be a hermitian involution of (V, t). Then U(6e1 + 
6e2 + x + x') = T(6)e1 + T(~2)e2 + t-1(x') + t(x) defines an involution of 
F'. The fixed point set Inv( u) is an isotropic nonnormal twisted composition 
algebm over l and a. All such algebms are of this form. 
Proof. The proof that u is an involution (as defined after the proof of 
Prop. 4.2.4) is straightforward. The second point then follows from Prop. 4.2.4. 
The last point is a consequence of what was established in the beginning of 
this section. 
0 
The properties of t of 4.10.1 can be reformulated. Putting 
h(x, y) = (x, t(y)) (x, y E V), 
(4.85) 
it follows from property (i) that h is a nondegenerate hermitian form on the 
l'-vector space V, relative to T. Then, using (ii), 
h(t(x), y) = (t(x), t(y) ) = a( (x, (t')-1(t(y)) )) = a( (x, t(t(y)) )) = 
a(h(x, t(y))), 
which explains the adjective "hermitian" in De£. 4.10.1. 
Using the three properties we also find 
(t(x),t(y),t(z)) = (t-1(yl\x),t(z)) =T«(Z,yl\x)) = -T«(X,y,z)), 
from which we see that det(t) = -1, the determinant being defined as in 
§ 4.6. 
Conversely, given a nondegenerate hermitian form on V, there is a unique 
T-linear map t such that (4.85) holds. The requirements that t be hermitian 
relative to h and that det(t) = -1 give conditions equivalent to those of 
Def. 4.10.1. 
Let D be the cyclic crossed product (l', a, ->.), see § 4.7. Its center is k'. 
It is immediate that 

112 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
defines an involution of the second kind of D, i.e. an anti-automorphism of D 
which induces a nontrivial automorphism on the center of D. (In the present 
case this is T.) 
Finally, we notice that by property (ii) we have t3 = ~-l 0 (t,)-3 o~. Since 
t3 and (t,)-3 both are scalar multiplication by ->., we conclude that now 
r(>.) = >.. We will say that in this case the involution of the second kind of 
D is hermitian. 
4.11 Twisted Composition Algebras with Anisotropic 
Norm 
In this section we will review analogues Th. 4.6.2 for the case of twisted 
composition algebras with anisotropic norm. We need a complement to 
Lemma 4.2.12, which we first establish. For the moment, F is an arbitrary 
twisted composition algebra, as in Def. 4.2.1. The restriction char(k) '# 2,3 
remains in force .. Assume that b E F has the properties (i), (ii), (iii) of 
Lemma 4.2.12 and that N(b) '# O. In particular D(b) = T(b)2_4NI/k(N(b)) '# 
O. The polynomial with coefficients in k 
(4.86) 
has two distinct roots e and TJ, which are nonzero. Assume that they lie in k 
and put 
Lemma 4.11.1 a is isotropic and (a, a') = N(b)-l. We have a *2 = 
-N(b)TJ-1a', T(a) = -TJ-1. Moreover, a has the properties of Lemma 4.2.12. 
Similar results hold for a'. 
Proof. That a is isotropic follows by a direct computation, using that e is a 
root of (4.86). We have (a, b) = (e -TJ)-1(2e +T(b)) = 1, since T(b) = -e -TJ. 
Hence, a being isotropic, (a, a') = (a, N(b)-lb - a) = N(b)-l. The formula 
for a *2 follows from (4.34), using that NI/k(N(b)) = N(b)N(b) *2 = eTJ. The 
remaining assertions are easy. 
0 
Now assume that the norm N is anisotropic on F. Then k is infinite. We 
also assume that (with the notations of Prop. 4.2.5) N(F)* = M(N). By 
Cor. 4.2.6 this can be achieved by replacing F by an isotope. 
Lemma 4.11.2 There exists bE F with N(b) = 1 having the three properties 
of Lemma 4.2.12. 
Proof. As N is anisotropic, k and l are infinite. View F as a vector space 
over k. By Lemma 4.2.12 there exists c E F with T(c) '# 0, U(c) = T(c)2 -
4NI/k(N(c)) '# 0 and N(c) '# O. View T and U as homogeneous polynomial 

4.11 Twisted Composition Algebras with Anisotropic Norm 
113 
functions of respective degree 3 and 6, and N as a homogeneous quadratic 
mapping of F to l = k3 . Let K be an algebraic closure of k. By homogeneity, 
there is d E K Q9k F with T(d) =J 0, U(d) =J 0, N(d) = 1. 
Let Q be the variety in K ®k F defined by the equation N(x) = 1. The 
set 0 of x E Q with T(x) =J 0, U(x) =J ° is an open subset of Q which is 
nonempty, by what we just saw. By our assumptions there exists bo E F with 
N(bo) = 1. If x E F, N(x) =J 0, then x = bo - (N(x))-l(bo,x)x E Q, as a 
straightforward calculation shows. Since k is infinite, we can choose x E F 
such that N(x) =J ° and x E O. Then b = x has properties (ii) and (iii) of 
Lemma 4.2.12, and N(b) = 1. Also, if we had b*2 = ~b, then since N(b) = 1 
we had e = 1 and T(b) = (~b, b) = 2~, whence the contradiction U(b) = 0. 
Hence property (i) also holds. 
0 
Choose b as in the preceding lemma. Since N is anisotropic the polyno-
mial (4.86) has no roots in k. We have to distinguish several cases, which we 
briefly discuss. 
Case (A). F is a normal twisted composition algebra. 
Let kl be the quadratic extension of k generated by the roots ~ and "., of 
(4.86). Notice that now ~"., = 1. Denote by Tl the nontrivial automorphism 
of kdk. Then II = kl ®k l is a Galois extension k which is cyclic of degree 6. 
Viewing a and Tl as elements of its Galois group, aTl is a generator of that 
group. Now Fl = h ®l F is a normal twisted composition algebra over hand 
a, with an isotropic norm. 
We perform the analysis of § 4.5 for Fl , with a as in Lemma 4.11.1. Then 
el = a, and by the lemma e2 = a'. Denote by v the Tl-linear map T1 ® id 
of Fl = h ® F. Then v is an automorphism of F1 and F is the space of 
invariants Inv(v). Moreover v(x * ei) = v(x) * ei+1 (x E Fl. i = 1,2). With 
the notations of 4.5, v induces a Tl-linear bijection Ei ~ Ei+l. As in § 4.10 
we find 
V(Xi 1\ Yi) = V(Xi) 1\ V(Yi), 
(V(X2)' V(Xl)) = Tl(( Xl, X2)). 
These formulas indicate how to modify the construction of 4.6 in the 
present case. Assume given a twisted composition algebra Fl = F(Vl' t) over 
hand a. 
Definition 4.11.3 A unitary involution of (VI, t) is a T1-linear bijection Ll : 
VI ~ V{ with the following properties: 
(i) (X,LI(Y)) = T((y,LI(X))) (x,y E Vt). 
(ii) Ll 0 t = t' 0 Ll. 
(iii) Lll(x 1\ y) = Ll(Y) 1\ L1(X). 

114 
4. Twisted Composition Algebras 
We also have 
(iii)' £l(X' /\ y') = £11(y') /\ £11(x'). 
Theorem 4.11.4 Let £1 be a unitary involution of (Vb t). Then V(e1e1 + 
e2e2 +x + x') = 71(6)e1 + 71 (e1)e2 - £11(x') - £l(X) defines a 71-linear auto-
morphism of Fl. The fixed point set Inv(v) is a normal twisted composition 
algebra over land (1, with N(F)* = M(N). All anisotropic normal twisted 
composition algebras with the last property are of this form. 
Proof. The proofs of the assertions about v and F are straightforward. The 
last point follows from what was established in the beginning of this section. 0 
Again, there is a reformulation of the properties of Def. 4.11.3. Define 
h(x, y) = (x, £1 (y») (x, y E Vl). 
Then h is a nondegenerate hermitian form on V1, relative to 71. We now have 
h(t(x), t(y)) = (1(h(x, y)), 
which explains the adjective "unitary". Also, det(Lt} = -l. 
The cyclic crossed product occurring in the present case is D = (Lt, (1, e), 
where e is as before. Notice that 'f/ = 71(e) = e- l . The central simple algebra 
Dover k1 has the involution of the second kind 
We now call the involution unitary. 
Case (B). F is a nonnormal twisted composition algebra and the normal 
composition algebra F' is anisotropic. 
In this case (4.86) has no root in k'. Let k1 and 71 be as in Case (A). 
Now l~ = k1 ®k l' is a Galois extension of k whose group is 82 X 83 . We view 
(1,7 and 71 as automorphisms of li. Put F{ = k1 ®k F'. By 4.6.2 we may 
assume that is of the form F{ = F(Vb t), where V1 is a vector space over II 
and t is (1-semilinear. By 4.10.2 we have a 7-linear hermitian involution £ 
on (Vb t) and an involution on Vb whereas by case (A) we have a 71-linear 
unitary involution on (Vl' t) and an automorphism v of F{. Then 
F = Inv(u, v) = Inv(u) n Inv(v). 
In the present case the cyclic crossed product D is a central simple algebra 
over the field ki = k1 ®k k'. It has two commuting involutions of the second 
kind: a 7-linear one which is hermitian, and a 71-linear one which is unitary. 
Case (C). F is a nonnormal twisted composition algebra and (4.86) has roots 
in k'. 

4.12 Historical Notes 
115 
We can now take ~ and TJ in k/, hence a E F'. Proceeding as in 4.10 we 
have 
u(x * ei) = eHl * x (x E Ei), 
u 0 ti = ti lou. 
It follows that u defines T-linear bijections ~ and ~' of V and V', respectively. 
Moreover, (4.83) holds, and we have the counterpart of (4.84) 
Assume again that F' = F(V, t), with Va vector space over l'. Then we 
have a T-linear automorphism ~ of order 2 such that 
Lot=t-10~. 
Moreover, ~' being as in the last equation, 
~/(X I\y) = ~(x) 1\ ~(y) (x,y E V). 
With these notations, 
defines a T-linear involution of F', such that F is the fixed point set Inv(u). 
Any twisted composition algebra of Case (C) can be obtained in this way. 
The cyclic crossed product D = (l', 0', -A) has the unitary involution of 
the second kind 
4.12 Historical Notes 
Twisted composition algebras were introduced by T.A. Springer in the normal 
case, with a view to a good description of nonreduced Albert algebras (see 
Ch. 6). The theory was first exposed in a course at the University ofG6ttingen 
in the summer of 1963 (see [Sp 63]). The generalization to the nonnormal case 
is due to F.D. Veldkamp (in an unpublished manuscript). Independently, it 
was also given in [KMRT, §36]. 

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
In this chapter we discuss a class of Jordan algebras which includes those 
that are usually named exceptional central simple Jordan algebras or Albert 
algebras. Our interest in Albert algebras is motivated by their connections 
with exceptional simple algebraic groups of type E6 and F 4, a topic we will 
deal with in Ch. 7. They also playa role in a description of algebraic groups 
of type E7 and Es, but we leave that aspect aside. We will not enter into the 
general theory of Jordan algebras, but use an ad hoc characterization of the 
algebras under consideration by simple axioms, which are somewhat remi-
niscent of those for composition algebras. We call these algebras J-algebras, 
since they are in fact a limited class of Jordan algebras; see Remark 5.1.7. 
In this and the following chapters, fields will always be assumed to have 
characteristic i= 2,3. The assumption characteristic i= 3 is for technical rea-
sons and could possibly be removed. However, characteristic i= 2 is essential 
for our approach to Jordan algebras as (nonassociative) algebras with a bi-
nary product. If one wants to include all characteristics, it is necessary to use 
quadratic Jordan algebras as introduced by K. McCrimmon [McC]; see also 
[Ja 69]' [Ja 81] or [Sp 73]. 
5.1 J-algebras. Definition and Basic Properties 
Let k be a field with char(k) i= 2,3 and let C be a composition algebra over k. 
For fixed "Ii E k*, let A = H(C; "Ib "12, "(3) be the set of bb"l2,"(3)-hermitian 
3 x 3 matrices 
x = h(6,6,6;cl,C2,C3) = ("I2J~lC3 -f: _

with ei E k and Ci E C (i = 1,2,3); here - denotes conjugation as in § 1.3. We 
define a product in A which is different from the standard matrix product: 
1 
1 
2 
2 
2 
xy = -(x·y+y·x) = -((x+y) -x -y ), 
2 
2 
(5.2) 
where the dot indicates the standard matrix product and the square is the 
usual one with respect to the standard product (which coincides with the 

118 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
square with respect to the newly defined product). This multiplication is not 
associative. Together with the usual addition of matrices and multiplication 
by elements of k, it makes A into a commutative, nonassociative k-algebra 
with the 3 x 3 identity matrix e as identity element. We introduce a quadratic 
norm Q on A by 
Q(x) = t tr(x2) 
(53) 
= 2(e~ + e~ + e§) + ')'i1')'2N (Cl) + ')'11')'3N (c2) + ')'i1')'lN(C3) 
. 
for x = h( 6, 6, 6; CI, C2, C3) E A, and the associated bilinear form 
(x, y) = Q(x + y) - Q(x) - Q(y) = tr(xy) 
(x,y E A). 
This bilinear form is nondegenerate. Of special interest is the case that C 
is an octonion algebra; we then call A = H(C; ')'1, ')'2, ')'3) an Alben algebra. 
More generally, A is called an Alben algebm if k' ®k A is isomorphic to 
such a matrix algebra H(C'; ')'1, ')'2,')'3) for some field extension k' of k and 
some octonion algebra C' over k'. In Prop. 5.1.6 we will prove the relation 
x2(xy) = x(x2y), which is typical for Jordan algebras. The reader will have 
no difficulty in verifying the following three rules: 
Q(x2) = Q(X)2 
if (x, e) = 0, 
(xy,z) = (x,yz), 
3 
Q(e) = 2' 
(5.4) 
(5.5) 
(5.6) 
We will, conversely, consider a class of algebras with a quadratic norm Q 
that satisfies (5.4), (5.5) and (5.6). This class will turn out to contain, besides 
the algebras related to the algebras A = H(C; ')'1, ')'2,')'3) introduced above, 
one other type of algebras; see Prop. 5.3.5, the remark that follows it, and 
the classification in Th. 5.4.5. 
Definition 5.1.1 Let k be a field of characteristic #- 2,3. A J-algebm over 
k is a finite-dimensional commutative, not necessarily associative, k-algebra 
A with identity element e together with a nondegenerate quadratic form Q 
on A such that the conditions (5.4), (5.5) and (5.6) are satisfied. Q is called 
the norm of A, and the associated bilinear form ( , ) will often be called the 
inner product. 
A J-subalgebm is a nonsingular (with respect to Q) linear subspace which 
contains e and is closed under multiplication. 
An isomorphism t : A --+ A' of J-algebras over k is a bijective linear 
transformation which preserves multiplication: t( xy) = t( x )t(y) (x, YEA). 
Remark 5.1.2 It will be shown in Prop. 5.3.10 that in a J-algebra of dimen-
sion > 2 the norm Q is already determined by the linear structure and the 
product, and the same holds for the cubic form det that will be introduced 
in Prop. 5.1.5. As a consequence, an isomorphism necessarily leaves Q and 
det invariant in dimension > 2. 

5.1 J-algebras. Definition and Basic Properties 
119 
We begin the study of J-algebras with a lemma that gives a linearized 
version of (5.4). 
Lemma 5.1.3 If (x, e) = (y, e) = (z, e) = (u, e) = 0, then 
2(xy, zu )+2(xz, yu )+2(xu,yz) = (x, y)( Z,u )+(x, z )(y, u )+(x, u)( y, z). 
Proof. By substituting AX + /LY + vz + flU for x in (5.4), writing both sides 
out as polynomials in A,/L,V and (J, and equating the coefficients of A/Lv{J on 
either side, we immediately get the formula. Here we use that the degree of 
the polynomials is 4 and that Ikl > 4. 
0 
Proposition 5.1.4 If A is a J-algebra over a field k and I is any extension 
field of k, then I ®k A, with the extension of the product and the quadratic 
form, is a J-algebra over l. 
Proof. The linearized version of (5.4) that we proved in the Lemma is in fact 
equivalent to (5.4) itself. This multilinear version clearly also holds in I ®k A. 
Similarly for (5.5). 
0 
By the Hamilton-Cayley Theorem, every element in a 3 x 3 matrix algebra 
over a field satisfies a cubic equation. It is conceivable that a similar result 
holds in a "matrix algebra" H( C; /'1, /'2, /'3). In fact, it does in all J-algebras. 
Proposition 5.1.5 Every element x in a J-algebra A satisfies a cubic equa-
tion 
1 
x3 - (x, e )x2 - (Q(x) - '2 (x, e )2)x - det(x)e = 0, 
(5.7) 
called its Hamilton-Cayley equation. Here det is a cubic form on A. 
Proof. With the aid of equation (5.5) we derive from Lemma 5.1.3 (with 
z = U = x) 
(x3 - Q(x)x,y) = ° 
(x,y E A, (x,e) = (y,e) = 0). 
Since ( , ) is nondegenerate, this implies that 
x3 - Q(x)x = ~(x)e 
(x E A, (x,e) = 0), 
(5.8) 
where ~ is a cubic form with values in k. We can write any x E A as x = 
x' + %( x, e)e with (x', e) = 0. Substitution of x - %( x, e)e in equation (5.8) 
yields after some computation 
1 
x3 - (x, e )x2 - (Q(x) - '2( x, e )2)X - det(x)e = ° 
(x E A), 
where det is a cubic form on A with values in k. 
o 
If det(x) i= 0, then 

120 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
satisfies xx- l = ej we will come back to this in Lemma 5.2.3. The polynomial 
1 
Xx(T) = T3 - (x, e )T2 - (Q(x) - 2( x, e )2)T - det(x) 
(5.9) 
is called the characteristic polynomial of x, and det(x) the determinant of 
Xj the cubic form det is called the determinant function on A, or just the 
determinant of A. 
By taking the inner product of the left hand side of (5.7) with e, one finds 
1 
0= (x3,e) - (x,e)(x2,e) - (Q(x) - 2(x,e)2)(x,e) - det(x)(e,e) 
1 
= (x2,x) - 3Q(x)(x,e) + 2(x,e)3 - 3det(x). 
Hence 
1 
1 
det(x) = 3( x2, x) - Q(x)( x, e) + 6( x, e )3. 
(5.10) 
Notice that det(e) = l. 
With the aid of (5.10) one easily computes det(x) for an element x = 
h(6, 6, 6j Cl, C2, C3) of H(Cj II, 12, 13) as in (5.1): 
det(x) = 666 -'3l'26N(ct}-'ll'36N(C2)-,il'16N(C3)+N(ClC2, (3)' 
(5.11 ) 
Here N( , ) denotes the bilinear form associated with the norm Non C. 
The cubic form det uniquely determines a symmetric trilinear form ( , , ) 
with 
(x, x, x) = det(x). 
We have 
6( x, y, z) = det(x + y + z) - det(x + y) - det(y + z) - det(x + z)+ 
det(x) + det(y) + det(z). 
We derive some consequences of the Hamilton-Cayley equation. Replacing 
x by x + y + z in (5.7) yields 
1 
(x+y+z)3_( x+y+z, e )(x+y+z)2_(Q(x+y+z)-2( x+y+z, e )2)(x+y+z) = 
det(x + y + z)e. 
Collecting in both sides terms which are linear in each of the variables x, y 
and z, we obtain the following formula. 
x(yz) +y(xz) + z(xy) = (x,e)yz+ (y,e)xz + (z,e)xy + 

5.1 J-algebras. Definition and Basic Properties 
121 
1 
1 
2((y,z) - (y,e)(z,e))x + 2((x,z) - (x,e)(z,e))y + 
1 2 (( x, y) - (x, e) ( y, e))z + 3( x, y, z )e. 
(5.12) 
Replacing z by x in this equation we find 
2x(xy) + x2y = 2( x, e )xy + (y, e )x2+ 
1 
((x,y) - (x,e)(y,e))x+ (Q(x) - 2(x,e)2)y+3(x,x,y)e. (5.13) 
From equation (5.12) one easily derives a formula that expresses the sym-
metric trilinear form associated with det in the inner product and the prod-
uct. Namely, take the inner product of either side of (5.12) with e, apply 
condition (5.5) several times and use (e, e) = 3. After rearrangement and 
dividing by 3 one finds: 
1 
1 
1 
3 ( x, y, z) = (xy, z) - 2 ( x, e ) ( y, z) - 2 ( y, e ) ( x, z) - 2 ( z, e ) ( x, y ) + 
1 2(x,e)(y,e)(z,e). 
(5.14) 
We can now prove the Jordan identity. 
Proposition 5.1.6 In any J-algebra A the Jordan identity holds: 
x2(xy) = x(x2y). 
Proof. It suffices to prove that x2(xy) and x(x2y) have equal inner products 
with any z E A. In view of (5.5) this amounts to showing that 
(xy,x2z) = (xZ,x2y) 
(x,y,z E A). 
(5.15) 
This relation is immediate from (5.5) if y = e or z = e, so it suffices to prove 
it for the case (y, e) = (z, e) = o. Under these assumptions, we take the 
inner product of either side of equation (5.13) with xz and, using (5.5), find 
the relation 
2(x(xy),xz) + (x2y,xz) = 2(x,e)(xy,xz) + (x,y)(x,xz)+ 
1 
Q(x)(y,xz) - 2(x,e)2(y,xz) +3(x,x,y)(x,z). 
Replacing 3( x, x, y) in the right hand side by the expression that follows 
from equation (5.14), we arrive at the formula 
(x2y,XZ) = -2(x(xy),xz) +2(x,e)(xy,xz) + (x,y)(x,xz)+ 
1 
Q(x)(y,xz) - 2(x,e)2(y,xz) + (x,xy)(x,z) - (x,e)(x,y)(x,z) 
for (y, e) = (z, e) = o. It is straightforward to verify that the right hand side 
of this equation is symmetric in y and z. So the left hand side is symmetric 
in y and z, too, which just amounts to (5.15).

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Remark 5.1. 7 A commutative algebra over a field k of characteristic 1= 2 
in which the Jordan identity holds is called a (commutative) Jordan algebra. 
So the above proposition says that every J-algebra is a Jordan algebra. A 
consequence of the Jordan identity is power associativity: xmxn = xm+n 
(m, n ~ 1); see, e.g., [Ja 68, Ch. I, Th. 8) or [Schaf, Ch. IV, §1, p. 92). For J-
algebras, power associativity follows more easily, as we show in the following 
corollary. 
Corollary 5.1.8 For any x in a J-algebra A, the subalgebra k[x) generated 
by x is a homomorphic image of k[Tl/xx(T), where Xx is the characteristic 
polynomial of x (see equation (5.9)). Consequently, A is power associative. 
Proof. By substituting x for y in the Jordan identity we find that x2x2 = 
X4. By the Hamilton-Cayley equation (5.7), every element of k[x) can be 
written in the form ~oe + 6x + 6x2 (but notice that e, x and x2 need not 
be linearly independent). The product of two such elements is associative 
since (xlxm)xn = xl+m+n for l,m,n:OS; 2, as follows from the Jordan identity. 
In other words, k[x) is the homomorphic image of the associative algebra 
k[Tl/Xx(T). 
0 
Remark 5.1.9 The word "subalgebra" above is meant in the sense of the 
theory of nonassociative algebras, so as a linear subspace containing e and 
closed under multiplication. For a J-subalgebra we also required in Def. 5.1.1 
that the restriction of the norm Q to it is nondegenerate; we will see in 
Prop. 5.3.8, that this need not be the case with k[x]. 
5.2 Cross Product. Idempotents 
With the aid of the symmetric trilinear form ( , , ) associated with det and 
the bilinear inner product we introduce a cross product x that will be used 
frequently in future computations: in a J-algebra A, we define x x y (x, YEA) 
to be the element such that 
(x x y, z) = 3( x, y, z) 
(z E A). 
(5.16) 
The cross product is evidently symmetric. In the following lemma we express 
it in terms of the ordinary product, and collect some formulas that will be 
useful in later computations. 
Lemma 5.2.1 The following formulas hold for the cross product. 
(i) x x y = xy -
~(x,e)y -

(v) 4(x X y) X (z X u) + 4(x X z) X (y X u) + 4(x X u) X (y X z) = 
3( x, y, z)u + 3( x, y, u)z + 3( x, z, u)y + 3( y, z, u )x; 
(vi) 4x X (y X (x X x)) = (x,y)x X x + det(x)y; 
(vii) det(x X x) = det(x)2. 
Proof. (i) By equation (5.14), (x X y, z) equals the inner product with z of 
the right hand side of the formula in (i), for all z. Hence (i) holds. 
(ii) Using the above formula to compute x X x, one finds 
1 
x(x X x) = x3 - (x,e)x2 - (Q(x) - 2"(x,e)2)x 
= det(x)e 
(by the Hamilton-Cayley equation (5.7)). 
(iii) A straightforward computation using (i) and equation (5.14) yields 
1 
(x X x) X y = x2y - 2(y,e)x2 - (x,e)xy + 
1 
1 
1 
2 
3 
2(x,e)(y,e)x - 2(Q(x) - 2(x,e) )y - 2(x,x,y)e. 
Using equation (5.13), one reduces this to 
1 
1 
(x xx) X y = 2"x2y - x(xy) + 2" (x, y )x. 
Linearizing this one obtains the formula in (iii). 
(iv) Replace Xl and X2 by x, and y by x X x in the formula of (iii). Then 
using (ii), the Hamilton-Cayley equation and power associativity, one easily 
gets the result. 
(v) This follows by linearizing the previous formula. 
(vi) and (vii) In (v), replace x, z and u by x X x; this yields 
4[(xxx)x(xxx)]x[yx(xxx)] = 3(xxx,xxx,y)xxx+det(xxx)y. (5.17) 
The left hand side equals 4det(x)x x (y X (x x x)) by (iv). Further, 
3(x X x,x X x,y) = (x X x) x (x x x),y) = det(x)(x,y), 
by (5.16) and (iv). Replacing y by x x x in this formula we get 
det(x x x) = det(x)2, 
i.e., (vii) holds. Using these last two equations to replace terms in the right 
hand side of (5.17), we find 
4det(x)x x (y x (x x x)) = det(x) ( x, y)x x x + det(x)2y. 
This yields formula (vi) for det(x) i= 0; by continuity for the Zariski topology 
over an algebraic closure of k it holds everywhere (cf. the end of the proof of 
Prop. 3.3.4).

An important role in developing the theory of J-algebras will be played 
by idempotent elements, i.e., elements u such that u2 = U.

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Lemma 5.2.2 If u =I 0, e is an idempotent in A, then det( u) = 0 and Q( u) = 
! or Q(u) = 1; in addition, (u, e) = 2Q(u). Jilurther, e - u is an idempotent 
with u(e - u) = 0, (u, e - u) = 0 and Q(e - u) = ~ - Q(u). So if A contains 
an idempotent =I O,e, then it contains an idempotent u with Q(u) =!. 
Proof. The Hamilton-Cayley equation reads for an idempotent u: 
1 
(1- (u,e) - Q(u) + 2(u,e}2)u = det(u)e. 
Since an idempotent =I 0, e can not be a multiple of e, we find det(u) = 0 
and 
1 
2 
1-(u,e}-Q(u)+2(u,e} =0. 
Using (5.5) we see that 
1 
1 
2 
1 
Q(u) = 2(u,u) = 2(u ,e} = 2(u,e), 
so (u,e) = 2Q(u). Substituting this in equation (5.18), we get 
3 
1 
Q(u)2 - 2Q(u) + 2 = o. 
(5.18) 
This yields Q(u) = ! or Q(u) = 1. The rest of the proof is straightforward. 0 
An idempotent u with Q(u) = ! is called a primitive idempotent. This 
name is in agreement with the usual terminology. For let u be an idempotent 
with Q(u) = ~, and suppose we could decompose 
Then we would have 
and (Ui' e) = 2Q(Ui) = 1 or 2, which leads to a contradiction. On the other 
hand we will see in Prop. 5.3.7 that in most cases e - u is a sum of two 
orthogonal primitive idempotents. 
We next prove an addition to Prop. 5.1.5. 
Lemma 5.2.3 Let A be a J-algebra. For x E A, there exists X-I E A having 
the properties xx-I = e and x(x-Iy) = x-I(xy) (y E A) if and only det(x) =I 
O. Such an element x-I is unique, viz., 

5.3 Reduced J-algebras and Their Decomposition 
125 
Proof. If det(x) i= 0, then 
satisfies xx- 1 = e by the Hamilton-Cayley equation (5.7). From the Jordan 
identity it follows that x(x- 1y) = x- 1(xy) (y E A). If z satisfies xz = e 
and x(zy) = z(xy) (y E A), then x2z = x and x3z = x2. Hence by the 
Hamilton-Cayley equation, 
1 
det(x)z = x2 - (x,e)x - (Q(x) - 2(x,e)2e, 
which shows uniqueness. 
Now suppose X-I would exist for x i= 0 with det(x) = O. Then 
1 
x2 - (x,e)x - (Q(x) - 2(x,e)2)e = O. 
Taking the inner product with e we find that Q(x) = ~(x,e)2. Hence x2 = 
(x, e )x. Then 
( -1) 
-1 2 
( 
) 
X = X X 
X = X 
X = x, e e. 
It follows that x is a nonzero multiple of e. Since det(e) = 1 we obtain a 
contradiction. 
0 
The element X-I as in the Lemma is called the }-inverse or just inverse 
of x. It is not an inverse in the general sense of nonassociative algebras as we 
defined at the end of § 1.3, since x- 1(xy) = y need not hold for y fj. k[x]. 
5.3 Reduced J-algebras and Their Decomposition 
A J-algebra is said to be reduced provided it contains an idempotent i= 0, e. 
By Lemma 5.2.2 it also contains a primitive idempotent. 
We consider a reduced J-algebra A over k and fix a primitive idempotent 
u in A. Define 
E = (keEBku).L = {x E AI (x,e) = (x,u) = O}. 
The restriction of Q to ke EB ku is nondegenerate, hence the same holds for E. 
From x E E we infer that ux E E, for (ux,e) = (x,u) = 0 and (ux,u) = 
( x, u) = o. So we can define the linear transformation 
t : E -> E, x I-t ux.

Lemma 5.3.1 t is symmetric with respect to ( , ), and t2 = ~t. We have 
E= EoEDEl 
with Eo.l Et, 
where 
Ei = {x EEl t(x) = ~iX}. 
Proof. Let x, y E E. The symmetry of t follows from property (5.5): 
(t(x),y) = (ux,y) = (x,uy) = (x,t(y)). 
Using Lemma 5.2.2, we get from equations (5.13) and (5.14) 
2u(ux) + ux = 2ux, 
from which t 2 = ~t follows. This implies that the possible eigenvalues of t are 
o and ~, and the symmetry of t implies that the eigenspaces are orthogonal 
and span E.

Eo and El are called, respectively, the zero space and half space of u. The 
restrictions of Q to Eo and to El are nondegenerate. 
Lemma 5.3.2 The following rules hold for the product in E. 
(i) For x, y E Eo, 
1 
xy = 2(x,y)(e - u). 
(ii) For x, y E Ell 
1 
xy = 4 ( x, y ) (e + u) + x 0 y with x 0 y E Eo. 
(iii) If x E Eo and y E Ell then xy EEl' 
Proof. First we derive a formula for arbitrary x, y E E. Replacing z by u in 
equation (5.12) we get 
1 
u(xy) + x(uy) + y(ux) = xy + 2( x, y)u + 3( u, x, y)e 
(X,yEE). 
Now 3( u, x, y) = (u, x x y) and in the latter expression we replace x x y by 
the expression given in Lemma 5.2.1. This leads to the equation 
1 
1 
u(xy) +x(uy)+y(ux) = xy+ 2(x, y )u+(( ux, y) - 2(x, y))e 
For x, y E Eo this equation reduces to 
1 
1 
u(xy - "2(x,y)e) = xy - "2(x,y)e. 
(x,y E E). 
(5.20) 

5.3 Reduced J-algebras and Their Decomposition

The only elements z of A satisfying the relation uz = z are the multiples of 
u, so 
1 
xY - 2(x,y)e = /'i,U 
for some /'i, E k. Taking inner products with u, we get 
1 
(xy,u) - 2(x,y)(e,u) = /'i,(u,u). 
Since (xy,u) = (x,uy) = 0, we find /'i, = -~(x,y). Hence 
1 
xy = 2 ( x, y ) (e - u), 
which proves (i). Next, we consider x, y EEl. We define x 0 y by 
1 
x 0 y = xy - 4: ( x, y )( e + u) 
(5.21) 
Using that (x 0 y,u) = ~(x,y) we find that (x 0 y,u) = O. Likewise, 
(x 0 y, e) = O. Hence x 0 y E E. From equation (5.20) we infer that 
u(xy) = ~(x,y)u, so 
1 
1 
u(x 0 y) = u(xy - 4:( x, y )(e + u)) = u(xy) - 2( x, y)u = o. 
Hence x 0 y E Eo. This proves (ii). Finally, let x E Eo and y EEl. Then 
(xy,u) = (y,ux) = 0 and (xy,e) = (x,y) = 0, 
so xy E E. Equation (5.20) yields u(xy) + ~xy = xy, so u(xy) = ~xy. This 
proves that xy EEl'

In the following lemma we collect a number of formulas involving products 
between elements of Eo and E 1. 
Lemma 5.3.3 The following formulas hold for x, xl, X2 E Eo and y EEl. 
(i) x(xy) = ~Q(x)y; 
(ii) Xl(X2Y) +X2(XIY) = ~(Xl,X2)Y; 
(iii) yo xy = ~Q(y)x; 
(iv) (y 0 y)y = iQ(y)y; 
(v) (Yl 0 Y2)Y3 + (Y2 0 Y3)Yl + (Y3 0 Yl)Y2 = ~(Yl'Y2)Y3 + ~(Y2'Y3)Yl + 
i(Y3,Yl )Y2; 
(vi) Q(xy) = ~Q(x)Q(y); 
(vii) Q(y 0 y) = ~Q(y)2. 

128 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Proof. (i) For x E Eo and y E El we have by (5.13), 
2x(xy) + x2y = Q(x)y + 3( x, x, y )e. 
According to equation (5.16) and Lemma 5.2.1, 
3(x,x,y) = (x,x x y) = (x,xy) = 0, 
since x E Eo and xy EEl. By Lemma 5.3.2 (i), x2 = Q(x)(e - u). So we get 
1 
2x(xy) + Q(x)y - 2Q(x)y = Q(x)y, 
from which (i) follows. (ii) follows from (i) by linearizing. 
(iii) Interchanging x and y in formula (5.13) and using (5.16) and Lemma 5.2.1 
again, we find 
xy2 + 2y(xy) = Q(y)x + (x, y2 )e. 
Using y2 = Y 0 Y + ~Q(y)(e + u), we get 
1 
x(y 0 Y + 2Q(y)(e + u)) + 2y(xy) = Q(y)x + (x, y2 )e. 
By Lemma 5.3.2 (i), 
1 
1 
1 
1 
x(yoy) = 2(x,yoy)(e-u) = 2(x,y2- 2Q(y)(e+u))(e-u) = 2(x,y2)(e-u). 
Substituting this into the above formula and rearranging terms, we get 
111 
2y(xy) - 2(x, y2)U = 2Q(y)x + 2(x, y2 )e. 
By (5.5) this yields 
1 
1 
y(xy) - 4(y,xy )(e+u) = 4Q(y)x, 
from which (iii) follows. 
(iv) The Hamilton-Cayley equation (see Prop. 5.1.5) for y E E reads 
y3 _ Q(y)y _ det(y)e = 0. 
Now for y E El, 
3det(y) = (y,y x y) = (y,y2 _ Q(y)e) = (y,y2) = 
1 
(y, yo y - 2Q(y)(e + u)) = 0, 
so the Hamilton-Cayley equation for y E El becomes 

5.3 Reduced J-algebras and Their Decomposition 
129 
y3 = Q(y)y. 
From this we derive 
1 
1 
1 
1 
(y 0 y)y = (y2 - 2Q(y)(e + u))y = Q(y)y - 2Q(Y)Y - 4Q(Y)Y = 4Q(y)y, 
thus obtaining (iv). (v) is obtained by linearizing. 
(vi) From Lemma 5.1.3 we derive 
4Q(xy) + (x2,y2) = 2Q(x)Q(y). 
Computing x2 and y2 with the aid of Lemma 5.3.2, we get 
1 
4Q(xy) + 2Q(x)Q(y)( e - u, e + u) = 2Q(x)Q(y). 
Since (e - u, e + u) = 2, we arrive at the formula of (vi). 
(vii) By (vi) and (iv), 
1 1 1  
4Q(y 0 y)Q(y) = Q((y 0 y)y) = Q(4Q(y)y) = 16Q(y)3, 
so Q(y 0 y) = ~Q(y)2 follows for Q(y) =1= O. By Zariski continuity (over an 
algebraic closure of k), this holds for all y EEl'

Statement (i) in the above lemma can be interpreted in terms of Clifford 
algebras (d. § 3.1). This will be used later on. 
Corollary 5.3.4 Let CI(Qj Eo) be the Clifford algebra of the restriction of 
Q to Eo. The map r.p : Eo -+ End(EI) defined by 
r.p(x)(y) = 2xy 
can be extended to a representation ofCI(Qj Eo) in EI , i.e., a homomorphism 
of CI(Qj Eo) into End(EI)' 
Proof. By (i) in the Lemma, 
r.p(X)2(y) = Q(x)y 
so the extension of r.p to a homomorphism of the tensor algebra T(Eo) into 
End(Et} respects the defining relations for CI(Qj Eo).

Proposition 5.3.5 Let A be a reduced J-algebra. Consider a primitive idem-
potent u in A, and let E, Eo and EI be as before, with respect to u. 
(i) Eo = 0 if and only if A is 2-dimensional; then A = ku E9 k(e - u), an 
orthogonal direct sum.

where q is a nondegenerate quadratic form on Eo with associated bilinear form 
q( , ). Conversely, for any vector space Eo (possibly 0) with a nondegenerate 
quadratic form q, the above formulas define a J-algebra A. 
Proof. If Eo = 0, then yo y = 0 for y E E1, so Q(y) = 0 by Lemma 5.3.3 
(iv). Since the restriction of Q to El is nondegenerate, this implies El = 0. 
Hence A is the 2-dimensional algebra ku El) k(e - u). 
If El = 0, then A is an orthogonal direct sum of vector spaces: 
A = ku El) k(e - u) El) Eo. 
The product is determined by Lemma 5.3.2 (i), if we take for q the restriction 
of Q to Eo. Conversely, any vector space Eo with a nondegenerate quadratic 
form q yields a J-algebra A of dimension equal to dim Eo + 2 as above; it is 
straightforward to verify the axioms (5.4)-(5.6). 
0 
We call a J-algebra as in (ii) of the above proposition a J-algebra of 
quadratic type. Such a J-algebra A is closely related to the Jordan algebra 
of the quadratic form q as in [Ja 68, p. 14J; in fact, A is the algebra direct 
sum of a one-dimensional algebra ku and the subalgebra k(e - u) El) Eo, the 
latter being the Jordan algebra of q with e - u as identity element (and also 
a J-algebra if we multiply Q by ~). 
Lemma 5.3.6 If El :I 0, hence also Eo :I 0, then there exists Xl E Eo with 
Q(Xl) = ~. In fact, one can take Xl = Q(y)-ly 0 Y for any y E E1 with 
Q(y) :I OJ then XlY = h· 
Proof. Since the restriction of Q to El is nondegenerate, there exists Y E El 
such that Q(y) i= o. Then Xl = Q(y)-ly 0 Y E Eo. By Lemma 5.3.3 (vii), 
Q(Xl) = ~. From (iv) of that same lemma we infer XlY = ~y.

In the discussion after Lemma 5.2.2 we claimed that in most cases e - u is 
a sum of two orthogonal primitive idempotents if u is a primitive idempotent. 
We can now prove the precise result. 

5.3 Reduced J-algebras and Their Decomposition 
131 
Proposition 5.3.7 If A is a reduced J-algebra and u is a primitive idem-
potent in A, then e - u is a sum of two orthogonal primitive idempotents 
unless 
A = ku $ k(e - u) $ Eo 
and Q does not represent 1 on Eo. The latter condition is independent of the 
choice of u such that the corresponding half space E1 is zero. 
Proof. If E1 ~ 0, then there exists Xl E Eo with Q(X1) = ~ by the above 
lemma. Then ~ (e - u) + Xl and ~ (e - u) - Xl are primitive idempotents with 
sum e - u. If E1 = 0, then 
A = ku $ k(e - u) $ Eo. 
Consider a = AU + p,(e - u) + a1 with a1 E Eo, and b = e - u - a, so 
b = -AU + (1 - p,)(e - u) - a1 and a + b = e - u. One easily verifies that a 
and b are both idempotent if and only if A = 0, p, = ~ and Q(a1) = ~. Then 
indeed Q(a) = Q(b) = ~ and ab = 0. 
The restriction of Q to ku $ k(e - u) is independent of u, so by Witt's 
Theorem the same is true for the restriction to the orthogonal complement 
Eo.

We saw in Prop. 5.1.5 that every element satisfies a cubic equation, the 
Hamilton-Cayley equation. We compare this with the minimum equation. 
Let a E A and denote by ma its minimum polynomial. So k[a] ~ k[T]/ma(T) 
and ma divides Xa. 
Proposition 5.3.8 The polynomials ma and Xa have the same roots in a 
common splitting field. Hence ma = Xa if Xa has three distinct roots in a. 
For a ~ ke, the restriction of the norm Q of A to k[a] is nondegenerate if and 
only if not all roots of Xa are equal. If Xa has a root in k, then k[a] contains 
a primitive idempotent if and only if not all roots of Xa are equal. 
Proof. Upon replacing k by a splitting field of Xa, we may assume that Xa 
splits in k. If dim k[a] = 1, then a = Ae for some A E k. Then ma(T) = T - A, 
and one easily computes that Xa(T) = (T - A)3. 
Next assume dim k[a] = 2. If ma(T) = (T - A)2, consider X = a - Ae. 
This satisfies x2 = ° and X ~ 0, so mx(T) = T2. It follows that Xx(T) = 
T3 - (x,e)T2, so Q(x) = ~(x,e)2. But Q(x) = ~(x,x) = ~(x2,e) = 0, 
hence also (x,e) = 0. This implies that (a,e) = 3A and Q(a) = ~A2. Since 
det(a) = A3, we find that Xa(T) = (T - A)3. It is easily verified that in 
k[a] = k[x] there is no idempotent ~ e, and that the restriction of Q to this 
subspace is degenerate. 
If ma(T) = (T - A)(T - p,) with A ~ p" then 
k[a] ~ k[T]/(T - A)(T - p,) ~ k $ k, 
so k[a] contains orthogonal idempotents u and e - u; we may assume u to be 
primitive. Q is nondegenerate on k[a] (see Lemma 5.2.2). If a = au+,B(e-u), 

132 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
then ma(T) = (T - a)(T - (3), so a = ..\ and {3 = /1-, or a = /1- and (3 = ..\. One 
easily computes that Xa(T) = (T - a)(T - (3)2, which is (T - "\)(T - /1-)2 or 
(T - ..\)2(T - /1-). 
Now let dim k[a] = 3. Then ma = Xa. If Xa has three distinct roots, 
then k[a] ~ k ffi k ffi k, i.e., k[a] is spanned by three idempotents Ut, U2, 
U3 with UiUj = 0 for i =1= j. These must be orthogonal with respect to Q 
since (Ui, Uj) = (e, UiUj) = 0 if i =1= j. Hence the restriction of Q to k[a] is 
nondegenerate. 
If Xa(T) = (T - ..\)(T - /1-)2 with ..\ =1= /1-, then k[a] ~ k ffi k[x] for some 
x =1= 0 with x2 = o. So k[a] contains. an idempotent. The restriction of Q to 
k[x] is degenerate, and since the two components k and k[x] in the direct sum 
decomposition k[a] = kffik[x] are ideals generated by orthogonal idempotents, 
the restriction of Q to k[a] is degenerate. 
If Xa(T) = (T - ..\)3, then k[a] = k[x] for some x with x2 =f:. 0 and x3 = o. 
With arguments as in the case ma(T) = (T - ..\)2 treated above, one sees 
that the restriction of Q to the subspace kx ffi kx2 is identically zero and that 
this subspace is orthogonal to ke. Thus we find that the restriction of Q to 
k[a] is degenerate. It is also straightforward to verify that k[x] contains no 
idempotents =1= e. 
Finally, suppose no longer that k is necessarily a splitting field of Xa, but 
that Xa has a root in k. Then either all three roots lie in k, and then the 
statement about the existence of a primitive idempotent in k[a] follows from 
the above analysis. Or there are two distinct roots in a quadratic extension I of 
k which are not in k itself. Then k[a] ~ kffil, which contains an idempotent. 0 
Corollary 5.3.9 If k is algebraically closed and dimk A> 2, then mx = Xx 
for x in a nonempty Zariski open subset of A. 
Proof. We first construct a primitive idempotent U1 E A. To this end, we pick 
an element x with (x, e) = 0 and Q(x) =f:. O. Then 
Xx(T) = T3 - Q(x)T - det(x) with Q(x) =1= 0, 
which does not have three equal roots. By Prop. 5.3.8, k[x] contains a 
primitive idempotent U1. Prop. 5.3.7 implies that e - U1 is the sum of two 
orthogonal primitive idempotents U2 and U3, since Q represents all values 
on the subspace (kU1 ffi k(e - ur)).L if k is algebraically closed. An element 
y = 1]1 U1 + 1]2U2 + 1]3U3 with three distinct 1]i has characteristic polynomial Xy 
with three distinct roots, viz., the 1]i, so then Xy = my. The x E A such that 
Xx has three distinct roots are characterized by the fact that the discriminant 
of Xx is not zero, so these form a Zariski open set.

In Rem. 5.1.2 we indicated that the norm Q and the cubic form det on a 
J-algebra are determined by the algebra structure, provided it is of dimension 
> 2. We will now prove this. 

5.4 Classification of Reduced J-algebras 
133 
Proposition 5.3.10 On a J-algebra A over k with dimk(A) > 2, the 
quadratic form Q satisfying conditions (5.4)-(5.6) and the cubic form det are 
determined by the algebra structure of A, i.e. the structure of vector space 
over k and the product. Hence for an isomorphism t : A ~ A' of J-algebras 
over k of dimension> 2 we have: Q'(t(x)) = Q(x) and det'(t(x)) = det(x) 
(x E A). 
Proof. It suffices to prove this for algebraically closed k. There is a nonempty 
Zariski open subset S of A such that Xx is the minimum polynomial of x for 
XES. The coefficients of Xx determine det(x) and Q(x). So the polynomials 
det and Q are determined on S and therefore on all of A.

Remark 5.3.11 If dimk(A) = 2 and A is reduced, then there are two or-
thogonal idempotents UI and U2 such that A = kUI EB kU2 (cf. Prop. 5.3.5). 
One of these idempotents is primitive and the other is not: Q(u) = } and 
Q(e-u) = 1 for U = UI or U2. For x = ~u+7)(e-u) we have Q(x) = ~~ +7)2; 
with the Hamilton-Cayley equation one finds det(x) = ~7)2. Hence in this case 
there are two possibilities for Q and det, Le., these are not determined by the 
algebra structure. 
Corollary 5.3.12 If det(x) -/:: 0 then x has a J-inverse x-I and det(x- 1) = 
det(x)-l. 
Proof. For the first point see Lemma 5.2.3. It suffices to prove the equality 
for algebraically closed k. We first assume that dimk(A) > 2. Let V be the 
Zariski open set {x E A I det(x) -/:: O}, and W the Zariski open set on 
which mx = Xx (see Cor. 5.3.9). On V n W, Xx(T) = T3 ... - det(x) is the 
unique cubic polynomial which has x as a root, and similarly for Xx-1 (T) = 
T3 . .. - det(x- 1). But k[x] is associative, so X-I is also a root of 
- det(x)-IT3Xx(T-l) = T3 ... - det(x)-l, 
so det(x- 1 ) = det(x)-l for x E V n W. By Zariski continuity, the relation 
holds on all of V. 
Now let dimk(A) = 2. For x = ~u + 7)(e - u) as in the above remark, 
det(x) = ~7)2. If ~7) -/:: 0, then det(x- l) = ~-17)-2 = det(x)-l.

5.4 Classification of Reduced J-algebras 
We continue with the determination of the structure of reduced J-algebras. 
This will lead to the result that besides the J-algebras of quadratic type, 
which we found in Prop. 5.3.5, there is only one other type of reduced J-
algebra, viz., the matrix algebras H( C;)'l, )'2, )'3) we introduced at the be-
ginning of § 5.1; see Th. 5.4.5. We again fix a primitive idempotent U and 
assume that EI -/:: o. Further we fix Xl E Eo with Q(xt} = i·

Lemma 5.4.1 Consider the linear mapping 
(i) s is symmetric with respect to ( , ) and s2 = 116 • 
(ii) El = E+ $ E_ with E+ .1 E_, where E+ and E_ are the eigenspaces of 
s for the eigenvalues ~ and -~, respectively. 
(iii) If dim Eo > 1, then both E+ 1= 0 and E_ 1= o. 
(iv) If dim Eo = 1, then El = E+ or El = E_. 
Proof. (i) The symmetry of s follows from (5.5). The second statement of (i) 
is a consequence of Lemma 5.3.3 (i). 
(ii) From (i) it follows that s has eigenvalues ~ and -~, and that El is the 
orthogonal direct sum of the corresponding eigenspaces E+ and E_. 
(iii) Pick x E Eo with (x, Xl) = 0 and Q(x) 1= o. If E+ 1= 0, pick Y E E+ 
with Q(y) 1= o. By Lemma 5.3.3 (ii), 
1 
Xl(XY) = -X(XlY) = -4xy, 
so xy E E_. Further, Q(xy) 1= 0 by Lemma 5.3.3 (vi), so xy 1= o. Hence 
E+ 1= 0 implies E_ 1= o. Similarly, E_ 1= 0 implies E+ 1= O. 
(iv) Suppose E+ 1= 0 and E_ 1= o. Pick y E E+ with Q(y) 1= 0 and z E E_ 
with Q(z) 1= o. By Lemma 5.3.3 (iii), 
yo y = 4y 0 XlY = Q(Y)Xl. 
Hence (y 0 y)z = -~Q(y)z. By Lemma 5.3.3 (v), 
1 
1 
2(y 0 z)y + (y 0 y)z = 4Q(y)z + 4( y, z )y. 
Since (y, z) = 0, we find 
1 
2(y 0 z)y = "2Q(y)z, 
which shows that y 0 z 1= o. On the other hand, 
1 
(XbYoZ) = (XbYZ) = (XlY,Z) = 4(Y'z) =0. 
This implies that dim Eo > 1. Now (iv) follows. 
o 
In case (iv) of the above lemma we may assume that El = E+; otherwise, 
we take -Xl instead of Xl. We can now replace u by another primitive idem-
potent, viz., u' = ~(e - u) - Xl: one easily verifies that indeed U,2 = u' and 
Q(u') = ~. Further, it is straightforward that A is an orthogonal direct sum 
A = ku' $ k(e - u') $ E~, 

5.4 Classification of Reduced J-algebras 
135 
where Eo = k( !u' + Xl) E9 E+ satisfies u' Eo = o. This shows that A is a 
J-algebra of quadratic type if dim Eo = 1; see Prop. 5.3.5. 
This being dealt with, we sharpen our assumptions: A is a reduced J-
algebra with a primitive idempotent u such that dim Eo > 1 and E1 # o. 
Then, by (iii) of the above lemma, E1 = E+ E9 E_ with both E+ # 0 and 
E_ # o. We will see that under these assumptions A is isomorphic to a J-
algebra H( C; 71, 72, 73) of Hermitian 3 x 3 matrices over a composition algebra 
C, as introduced in the beginning of § 5.1. To start with, we define the vector 
space 
C = xt n Eo = {x E Eo I (x, xI) = O}. 
In Prop. 5.4.4, C will be given the structure of a composition algebra; before 
that, we prove two technical lemmas. 
Lemma 5.4.2 Fory+,z+ E E+ andy_,z- E E_ we have: 
(i) y+ 0 z+ = !( y+, z+ )X1; 
(ii) y_ 0 z- = -!( y_, z- )X1; 
(iii) y+ 0 y_ E C; 
(iv) (y+ oy_)y+ = iQ(y+)y-; 
(v) (y+ 0 y-)y- = iQ(y-)y+; 
(vi) Q(y+) = Q(y_) = 0 ify+ oy_ = 0 and y+ # 0 # y_; 
(vii) Q(y+ 0 y_) = ~Q(y+)Q(y_). 
Proof. (i) Using Lemma 5.3.3 (iii), we find y+ oy+ = 4y+ OX1Y+ = Q(Y+)X1. 
By linearizing we find the result for y+ 0 z+. Similarly for (ii). 
(iii) (xt.Y+ oy_) = (X1,Y+Y-) = (X1Y+,y-) = ~(y+,y-) = O. 
(iv) By Lemma 5.3.3 (v), 
1 
1 
2(y+ 0 y-)y+ + (y+ 0 Y+)Y- = 4Q(y+)y- + 4(Y+'Y- )y+. 
Using (i) and the fact that E+ .L E_, we easily get the result. The proof of 
(v) is similar. 
(vi) This is immediate from (iv) and (v). 
(vii) By Lemma 5.3.3 (vi), 
Using (iv) we find 
so 
1 
Q(y+ oy_) = 4Q(y+)Q(y-), 
if Q(y+) # o. By continuity for the Zariski topology (over an algebraic closure 
of k), the relation holds everywhere. It is not hard, by the way, to prove (vii) 

136 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
for Q(y+) = 0 directly with the aid of Lemma 5.3.3 (i), and (iv) of the present 
lemma: 
Now we fix a+ E E+ and a_ E E_ with Q(a+)Q(a_) # O. 
Lemma 5.4.3 The maps 
e+ : C ---7 E+, x I-t 4Q(a_)-lxa_, 
e_ : C ---7 E_, x I-t 4Q(a+)-lxa+, 
are linear isomorphisms. Their inverses are, respectively, 
E+ ---7 C, y+ I-t a_ 0 y+ = a_y+, 
E_ ---7 C, y_ I-t a+ 0 y_ = a+y_. 
Proof. From (v) of the above lemma one sees that 
o 
is injective, and from Lemma 5.3.3 (iii) that it is surjective. That e+ is its 
inverse, follows from either of these. Similarly for e_ with (iv) of the above 
lemma instead of (v). 
0 
We now make C into a composition algebra. 
Proposition 5.4.4 The vector space C with the product 0 defined by 
xox' = e+(x)e_(x') 
= 16Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-1(xa_)(x'a+) 
(x,x' E C) 
and with the norm N defined by 
(x E C) 
is a composition algebra. 
Proof. We have to verify the conditions of Def. 1.2.1. First, c = a+a_ is an 
identity element for the multiplication: 
by Lemma 5.4.2 (iv), hence 
xOc = e+(x)e_(c) = 4Q(a_)-1(xa_)a_ = x 
(x E C) 
by Lemma 5.3.3 (iii), and similarly cox = x. Using Lemma 5.4.2 (vii) and 
Lemma 5.3.3 (vi), we derive

Q(x 0 x') = Q(e+(x)e_(x'))

= 4Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-lQ(x)Q(x'). 
From this it is immediate that N permits composition. N is nondegenerate 
since the restriction of Q to C is so. 
0 
We denote the bilinear form associated with N by N( , ) to distinguish 
it from the bilinear form ( , ) associated with Q. 
Theorem 5.4.5 A reduced J-algebra A over a field k of characteristic -=J 2,3 
with identity element e and quadratic form Q is of one of the following types, 
and conversely, all such algebras are reduced J-algebras. 
(i) A = ku EB k(e - u) EB Eo (orthogonal direct sum), where u is a primitive 
idempotent, ux = 0 for x E Eo, and xx' = !(x,x')(e - u) for x,x' E Eo· 
Here Eo can be any vector space (possibly 0), and the restriction of Q to Eo 
can be any nondegenerate quadratic form on it. 
(ii) A ~ H(C;rbr2,r3), the algebra of3 x 3 (rl,r2,r3)-hermitian matrices 
over the composition algebra Cover k. In this case dim A = 6, 9, 15 or 27. 
A J-algebra of type (i) cannot be isomorphic to one of type (ii). 
Proof. We maintain the assumption that we have a primitive idempotent u 
such that dim Eo > 1 and El -=J 0, and fix Xl E Eo with Q(xd = 
~; so 
El = E+ EB E_. We know already that in all other cases A is of type (i). 
The elements UI = U, U2 = ~(e - u) + Xl and U3 = ~(e - u) -
Xl are 
three orthogonal primitive idempotents whose sum is e. Using Lemma 5.4.3, 
we see that every X E A can be written in a unique way as 
(5.22) 
= ~IUI +6U2+6u3+2Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-lcl +4Q(a+)-lc2a++4Q(a_)-lc3a_ 
with 6,6,6 E k and Cl, C2, C3 E C; as usual, - denotes conjugation in the 
composition algebra C. As we know, C2a+ E E_ and C3a_ E E+. We claim 
that 
x2 = {~? + Q(a_)N(c2) + Q(a+)N(c3)}Ul + 
{~~ + Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-l N(Cl) + Q(a+)N(c3)}U2 +

(5.23)

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
We postpone the proof of this formula and first complete the argument that 
leads us to type (ii). To this end, we compare the expression for x2 with the 
square of an element in H(Cj 'Yb 1'2,1'3). Using the notation as in (5.1), we 
get by a straightforward computation: 
where 
h(el,e2,e3j Cl,C2,C3)2 = h(~l'~2,~3jdl,d2,d3), 
~l = ef + 'Yll'Y3N (c2) + 'Y2"I'YlN(C3) 
~2 = e~ + 'Yal'Y2N(CI) + 'Y2"I'YIN(C3) 
173 = e~ + 'Yal'Y2N{CI) + 'Yll'Y3N {C2) 
dl = {6 + 6)CI + 'Y2"l'Y3C3 ¢ C2 
d2 = (6 + 6)C2 + 'YaI 'YICI ¢ C3 
d3 = (6 +6)C3 +'Yl l 'Y2C2¢CI 
with ¢ denoting the product in C. Now, if we choose 
then the bijective map cp : A -+ H(Cj 'Yb 1'2, 1'3) given by 
satisfies cp{x2) = cp(x)2. Since both algebras are commutative, it follows that 
c.p is an isomorphism. One sees that c.p maps UI = U, Xl, a+ and a_ to, 
respectively, h(l, 0, OJ 0, 0, 0), h(O,~, -~j 0, 0, 0), h(O, 0, OJ 0, lQ(a+), 0) and 
h(O, 0, OJ 0,0, lQ( a_», hence U2 to h(O, 1, OJ 0, 0, 0) and U3 to h(O, 0, 1j 0, 0, 0). 
Conversely, we saw already in § 5.1 that the algebras H(Cj'Yb'Y2,'Y3) sat-
isfy the axioms for J-algebras. 
Now we give the postponed proof of formula (5.23). We multiply the right 
hand side of (5.22) by itself and consider separately the squares and products 
that arisej we only deal with the less trivial ones. Notice that the idempotents 
Ub U2, U3 act on C E C, Y+ E E+ and Y_ E E_ as follows: 
O
I l  
UlC = 
, UIY+ = ¥Y+, UIY- = '2Y-j 
U2C = ic' U2Y+ = '2Y+, U2Y- = OJ 
U3C = '2C, U3Y+ = 0, 
U3Y- = !Y-. 
(a) Consider 16Q(a+)-2Q(a_)-lcI(C2a+)j by (iii) of Lemma 5.3.3, this can 
be written as 
64Q( a+) -2Q( a_) -2 {a_ (CI a_) }(C2a+). 
In formula (5.12) we substitute X = a_, Y = Cla_, Z = C2a+j this yields

(For the second step we use the fact that the restriction of ( , ) to C is a 
multiple of the bilinear form N( , ) associated with the norm N on C, so 
(c,C2) = (c,c2).) Next,

Thus we find

16Q(a+ )-2Q(a_ )-lCl(C2a+) = 
16Q(a+)-2Q(a_ )-2( C2, C )cla- - 4Q(a+)-lQ(a_ )-l(Cl 0 c2)a_ =

4Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-1{cl 0 (N(C2,c)c - c2)}a_ = 
4Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-1(cloc2)a_. 
In the same way one computes that 
16Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-2c1(C3a_) = 4Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-1(c3 oCl)a+. 
(b) 32Q(a+)-lQ(a_)-1(c2a+)(c3a_) = 2C3 0 C2 by the definition of o.

= 16Q(a+)-2~Q(C2)Q(a+)(ul + U3) 
= Q(a_)N(c2)(Ul + U3), 
and similarly 
The remaining computations needed to prove formula (5.23) are left to the 
reader. 
Finally, we show that a reduced J-algebra as in (i) and one as in (ii) 
cannot be isomorphic. This will be done by showing that the cubic form det 
is reducible in case (i), but irreducible in case (ii). In case (i), consider an 
element z = Au + J.l(e - u) + x with x E Eo. Using the Hamilton-Cayley 
equation (5.7), one finds by a straightforward computation that 
det(z) = A(J.l2 - Q(x)), 
which is reducible. 
For case (ii), we may assume that k is algebraically closed. Consider 
A = H(Cj 1'1. 1'2, 1'3) and its subspace V = H(kjl'1.1'2;1'3) consisting of the 
elements h(6,6,6jc1.C2,C3) with all Ci E k. The polynomial det is homo-
geneous of degree three, so if it were reducible on A, the factors would be 
homogeneous of degree at most two. Hence the restriction of det to V, which 
is the common 3 x 3 determinant, would have to be reducible or identically 
zero. It is known that this is not the casej see, e.g., [Ja 74, Th. 7.2]. 
0 
We already named reduced J-algebras of type (i) in the Theorem J-
algebras of quadratic typej we call those of type (ii) proper J-algebras, since 
our main interest is in this type of J-algebras, or rather in those which are iso-
morphic to H(C; 1'1. 1'2, 1'3) with an octonion algebra C (these are the reduced 
Albert algebras). 

5.5 Further Properties of Reduced J-algebras 
141 
Corollary 5.4.6 A reduced J-algebra is proper if and only if the determinant 
polynomial of A is absolutely irreducible. The image of a J-algebra A under 
an isomorphism is of the same type as A itself, that is, of quadratic type or 
proper according to whether A is of quadratic type or proper. 
5.5 Further Properties of Reduced J-algebras 
The structure theory for J-algebras in the previous section is based on the 
existence of an idempotent, i.e., it holds for reduced algebras only. We now 
look for conditions that ensure a J-algebra is reduced, and in that case we 
classify the primitive idempotents. This being done, we will prove that in a 
proper reduced J-algebra, i.e., in H(C; 1'1, 1'2, 1'3), the composition algebra C 
is independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the primitive idempotent 
u and of the choices of Xl, a+ and a_. 
Theorem 5.5.1 In a J-algebra A, an element X satisfies X x x = 0 if and 
only if either x is a multiple of a primitive idempotent (and then (x, e) =1= 0) 
or x 2 = 0 (and then (x, e) = 0). If A contains a =1= 0 with a2 = 0, then it 
contains a primitive idempotent u with ua = O. 
So a J-algebra is reduced if and only if it contains x =1= 0 with x x x = O. 
Proof. Let x x x = O. If (x, e) = 0, we infer from Lemma 5.2.1 (i), 
x 2 - Q(x)e = O. 
Hence 
0= (x 2 - Q(x)e, e) = 2Q(x) - 3Q(x) = -Q(x), 
so x 2 = O. Conversely, if x 2 = 0, the Hamilton-Cayley equation ( 5.7) implies 
thatQ(x) = ~(x,e)2. SinceQ(x) = ~(x,x) = (x2,e) =O,weconcludethat 
Q(x) = (x, e) = 0, whence x x x = 0 by part (i) of Lemma 5.2.1. 
If x x x = 0 and (x,e) #- 0, we may assume that (x,e) = 1 and then 
Lemma 5.2.1 (i) yields 
2 
1 
x - x - (Q(x) - -)e = 0 
2 
. 
Taking the inner product of both sides of this equation with e, we find 
3 
( x, x) - 1 - 3Q (x) + 2 = 0, 
hence Q(x) = ! and therefore x 2 = x, so x is a primitive idempotent. 
Conversely, if x is a primitive idempotent then (x, e) = 2Q (x) = 1, so 
x x x = 0 by Lemma 5.2.1 (i). 
Let a2 = 0, a =1= o. As we saw, this implies Q(a) = 0 and (a, e) = O. Since 
the restriction of Q to e.l is nondegenerate, there exist b E e.l with Q(b) = 0 
and (a, b) = 1. From equation (5.13) we infer 

142 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
2a(ab) = a 
(since a x a = 0), 
(5.25) 
2b(ab) = -ab2 + b + (a, b2 )e 
(b x b = b2 by Lemma 5.2.1 (i)),(5.26) 
2a(ab2) = (a, b2 )a. 
(5.27) 
Equation (5.12) with x = a, y = band z = ab yields 
3 
1 
a(b(ab)) + b(a(ab)) + (ab)2 = 2ab + 2( a, b2 )a, 
since by Lemma 5.2.1 (i), 
1 
3(a,b,ab) = (a x ab,b) = (a(ab) - 2a,b) = 0 
(by equation (5.25)). 
Computing a(b(ab)) and b(a(ab)) with the aid of equations (5.25)-(5.27), we 
derive from this 
1 
1 
(ab)2 = 2ab + 4 (a, b2 )a. 
Now one easily verifies that u = e + (a, b2 )a - 2ab is idempotent. Further, 
(u, e) = 1, so u is primitive. By (5.25), ua = O. 
0 
Theorem 5.5.2 A l-algebra A is reduced if and only if the cubic form det 
represents zero nontrivially on A. 
Proof. If A contains a primitive idempotent u, then u x u = 0 by the previous 
theorem, so det(u) = o. Conversely, let x E A be nonzero with det(x) = o. 
By Lemma 5.2.1 (iv), either x x x = 0 or y = x x x =J 0 and y x y = o. By 
the previous theorem again, A is reduced. 
0 
Proposition 5.5.3 Let A be a reduced l-algebra and let u E A be a fixed 
primitive idempotent. The primitive idempotents in A are the elements 
(i) t = (Q(y) + 1)-1(u+ ~Q(y)(e - u) + y oy + y) 
(y E Eb Q(y) =J -1); 
(ii) t = ~(e-u)+x+y 
(x E Eo, Q(x) =!, y EEl, xy = h, Q(y) = 0). 
In type (ii), the condition Q(y) = 0 can be replaced by yoy = o. The primitive 
idempotents of type (i) are characterized by the fact that (t, u) =J 0, those of 
type (ii) by (t,u) = o. 
The elements tEA with t2 = 0 are, up to a scalar factor, of the form 
(i) t = u - !(e - u) + y 0 y + Y 
(y E Eb Q(y) = -1); 
(ii) t = x + y 
(x E Eo, y E Eb Q(x) = Q(y) = 0, xy = 0, yo y = 0). 
In case (ii), Q(y) = 0 already follows from yoy = o. An element t with t2 = 0 
is of type (i) if (t, e) =J 0 and of type (ii) if (t, e) = o.

Proof. The notations are as in §5.3. To find the primitive idempotents and 
the nilpotents of order 2, we describe the elements tEA with txt = o. Let 
t = ~e + 1]U + x + y 
A straightforward computation yields 
So txt = 0 is equivalent to the following set of equations: 
1 
e + ~17 -
"2Q(y) = 0, 
1 
-~17 - Q(x) + "2Q(y) = 0, 
yo y -
(~ + 1])x = 0, 
2xy -
~y = 0 
We distinguish three cases. 
(i) ~+171= o. Replacing t by a nonzero multiple, we may assume that ~+17 = l. 
Then we must have 
1 
t = U + "2Q(y)(e - u) + Y 0 Y + y 
Using part (iv) of Lemma 5.3.3 one sees that the set of equations is satisfied, 
whence txt = o. From (t, e) = 1 + Q(y) it follows by Th. 5.5.1 that t 2 = 0 
if Q(y) = -1 and that otherwise (Q(y) + 1)-lt is a primitive idempotent. 
(ii) ~ + 17 = 0, ~ 1= o. In this case we may assume that ~ = ~ and we find 
1 
t="2(e-u)+x+ y, 
where Q(x) = ~, xy = h, yo y = 0 and Q(y) = o. We may drop either of 
the last two conditions. For if y 0 y = 0, then 
so Q(y) = o. Conversely, if Q(x) = ~, xy = hand Q(y) = 0, choose Xl = x. 
In the decomposition of E with respect to this Xl we have y E E+. By 
Lemma 5.4.2 (i), yo y = Q(Y)Xl = O. Since (t, e) = 1, these elements are 
primitive idempotents. 
(iii) ~ = 1] = o. Then 
(X E Eo, y E El, Q(x) = Q(y) = 0, xy = 0, yo y = 0). 
As in (ii), yo Y = 0 implies Q(y) = o. These elements are nilpotent.

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
The statement about a primitive idempotent t being of type (i) if ( t, u) :/: 
o and of type (ii) if (t, u) = 0 follows from the fact that 
(t,u) = (Q(y) + 1)-1:/: 0 
for t of type (i) and (t, u) = 0 for t of type (ii). Similarly for t2 = O.

From the classification of primitive idempotents we easily derive the fol-
lowing lemma. 
Lemma 5.5.4 [fu and t are primitive idempotents in a J-algebra, then there 
exist primitive idempotents Vo = U,Vl. . .. ,Vn-l,Vn = t with n ::; 3 such that 
(Vi-l. vd = 0 for 1 ::; i ::; n. 
Proof. Let (t, u) :/: 0; by the above proposition, 
1 
t = (Q(b) + 1)-l(u + "2Q(b)(e - u) + bob + b) 
(b EEl. Q(b) :/: -1). 
We have (t,u) = (Q(b) + 1)-1. We distinguish two cases. 
(i) (t, u) :/: 1, i.e., Q(b) :/: O. A primitive idempotent v with (u, v) = 0 is of 
the form 
1 
v="2(e-u)+x+ y 
1 
1 
(x E Eo, Q(x) = 4' y EEl. xy = 4Y' Q(y) =0). 
Then 
1 
(t,v) = (Q(b) + 1)-l("2Q(b) + (bob,x) + (b,y)). 
If we choose x = -Q(b)-lb 0 b, y = 0, then (t, v) = O. So in this case the 
result holds with n ::; 2. 
(ii) (t, u) = 1, so Q(b) = O. Pick 
1 
v = -(e - u) + x 
2 
1 
(x E Eo, Q(x) = 4)' 
Then (t, v) = (b 0 b, x). If this equals 1, replace x by -x, so we may assume 
that (t, v) :/: 1. Hence we can go from v to t in at most two steps, by (i). 0 
Remark 5.5.5 The elements x with x x x = 0 have a geometric characteri-
zation. Assume that k is algebraically closed and that A is a proper J-algebra 
over k. The cubic polynomial function det is irreducible (see Cor. 5.4.6). It de-
fines an irreducible cubic hypersurface S in the projective space P(A) (whose 
points are the one-dimensional subspaces of A). It follows from (5.16) that 
the singular points of S are the lines kx, where x:/:O and x x x = o.

5.6 Uniqueness of the Composition Algebra 
In Th. 5.4.5 we saw that a proper reduced J-algebra is isomorphic to an 
algebra H(Cj 'Yl'Y2,')'3). We show in this section that the composition algebra 
C depends only on A and not on the choice of an idempotent u nor on the 
choices of Xl, a+ and a_. So we may call C the composition algebra associated 
with A. This will be followed by the result that C depends only on the cubic 
form det. 
Theorem 5.6.1 If A is a proper reduced J-algebra, then the composition 
algebra C such that A ~ H(Cj ')'1, ')'2, ')'3) is uniquely determined up to iso-
morphism. 
Proof. We fix a primitive idempotent u, and for any other primitive idempo-
tent t we consider 
E~ = {x' E A I (x', e) = (x', t) = 0, tx' = 0 } 
= {x' E A I ( x' , e) = 0, tx' = 0 }, 
since (x',t) = (tx',e) = 0 iftx' = O. In E~ we choose xi with Q(xi) = i, 
and then 
C' = {x' E E~ I ( x', xi ) = 0 }. 
By Witt's Theorem, the restriction of the quadratic form Q to the orthogonal 
complement C' of xi in E~ is unique up to isometry. The norm N on C' is 
a mUltiple of Q, so it is unique up to similarity. By Th. 1.7.1, this implies 
uniqueness of the composition algebra up to isomorphism. So we have to show 
for one choice of xi in Eb only that the restriction of Q to C' is similar to 
the restriction of Q to C. 
By Lemma (5.5.4) it suffices to prove this for a primitive idempotent t 
with (t, u) = o. So we may assume by Prop. 5.5.3 that t is of the form 
1 
t="2(e-u)+a+b 
1 
1 
(a E Eo, Q(a) = 4' bE El, ab = 4b, Q(b) = 0). 
We recall that the last condition can be replaced by bob = O. The zero space 
Eb of t consists of the elements x' = ee + 'T/U + x + y (e, 'T/ E k, x E Eo 
and y E E I ) which satisfy (x', e) = 0 and tx' = O. Writing out these two 
conditions, we get the following five equations in e, 'T/, x and y. 
3e +'T/ = 0, 
1 
e + ( a, x ) + "2 ( b, y) = 0, 
1 
-e - (a, x ) + "2 ( b, y) = 0, 
1 2x + ea + boy = 0,

4Y + ay + (e + 2'T/)b + bx = O.

(5.32)

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Equation (5.28) yields." = -3';. The equations (5.29) and (5.30) give 
(b, y) = ° and 
.; = -( a, x). 
From (5.31) we get 
x=-2';a-2boy. 
If x satisfies this equation, then'; = - ( a, x ), for 
(a,x) = -2';(a,a) - 2(boy,a) 
= -e - 2( by, a) 
= -e - 2( ab, y ) 
1 
= -e - "2 ( b, y ) 
= -e 
(since (b,y) =0). 
From (5.32) we infer, using (5.31), 
1 
ay = -4Y + eb + 2(b 0 y)b. 
By Lemma 5.3.3 (v), 
1 
1 
(b 0 b)y + 2(b 0 y)b = 4Q(b)y + 4( b, y)b. 
Now bob = 0, Q(b) = ° and (b, y) = 0, so (b 0 y)b = o. Hence 
1 
ay = -4Y + ';b. 
All this together shows that x' E Eh if and only if 
x' = .; (e - 3u - 2a) - 2b 0 y + y 
1 
(( b, y) = 0, ay = - 4Y + eb). 
(5.33) 
If we pick'; = ~ and y = !b, then indeed (b, y) = Q(b) = ° and 
1 
1 
1 
1 
1 
ay = "2ab = gb = -gb + 4b = -4Y + ';b. 
Further, boy = !y 0 y = 0. So if we choose xi = ~(e - 3u - 2a) + !b, then 
xi E Eh, and one easily verifies that Q(xi) = ~. For x' E Eh as in (5.33), 
(x', xl ) = 2e + (a, boy) + ~ ( b, y). 
Since 
1 
( a, boy) = (a, by) = (ab, y) = 4 ( b, y) = 0, 

5.6 Uniqueness of the Composition Algebra 
147 
we find (x', Xl ) = 2~. Hence 
G' = {x' = -2boy+y!y E El, (b,y) = 0, ay = -~y}. 
If we choose Xl = a, then b E E+ and y E E_, so automatically (b, y) = O. 
It follows that 
G' = {x' = -2b 0 Y + y! y E E_ }. 
(5.34) 
Using Lemma 5.4.2 (vii), we find for x' E G', 
Q(x') = 4Q(b 0 y) + Q(y) = Q(b)Q(y) + Q(y) = Q(y), 
(5.35) 
so we see that G' and E_ are isometric. Since the latter is similar to G (with 
multiplier iQ(a+)), we conclude that G and G' are similar. 
0 
We now prove that the associated composition algebra depends only on 
the determinant. 
Theorem 5.6.2 If A and B are proper reduced J-algebras over k with deter-
minants detA and detB, respectively, then the associated composition algebras 
are isomorphic if and only if there exists a linear transformation t : A --..+ B 
such that detB(t(x)) = adetA(x) (x E A) for some a E k*. 
Proof. Let A = H(G;"YI,"Y2,"Y3) and B = H(G';"Yi,"Y~,"Y~), and let s: G --..+ G' 
be an isomorphism of composition algebras. For x = h(6, 6, 6; CI, C2, C3) E A 
we have by equation (5.11): 
detA(x) = ~166-"Y31"Y2~INh)-"Yll"Y36N(C2)-"Y21"Y16N(C3)+( CIC2, C3), 
and similarly for det B. The linear transformation 
t: A -> B, h(6,6,6;CI,C2,C3) ~ h(AI6,A26,A36;s(CI),S(C2),S(C3)) 
with Ai = b:+l"Yi+2)-I"Y:+2"Yi+l (indices mod 3) satisfies detB(t(x)) = 
detA(x). 
Conversely, we will prove that if det is given up to a nonzero scalar factor, 
then G is determined up to isomorphism. By Th. 1.7.1 it suffices to show that 
the norm N of G is determined up to a nonzero scalar factor. Take v#-O in 
A with v x v = O. Consider the quadratic form Fv on A defined by 
Fv(x) = (v,x,x) 
(x E A). 
We will show that Fv determines N up to a scalar factor. Two cases must be 
distinguished. 
(a) v is a primitive idempotent. 
We then decompose A as in § 5.3 with respect to v instead of u. By equation 
(5.14), 

148 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
1 
3Fv(x) = (vx,x) - Q(x) - (x,e)(v,x) + '2(x,e)2 
(x E A). 
For x = 'e+17v+a+b (',17 E k, a E Eo, bE El) this leads after some simple 
computations to 
3Fv(x) = e -Q(a). 
This shows that the radical Rv of Fv is kv Ee El. The quadratic form induced 
by Fv on AI Rv is equivalent to the restriction of Fv to Sv = ke Ee Eo, a 
complement of Rv in A. This restriction is given by 
We see that Sv is the orthogonal direct sum of a hyperbolic plane, viz. keEekxl 
for Xl E Eo with Q(xt} = i, and e, so Fv determines the restriction of Q to 
e by Witt's Theorem. The latter in turn is a scalar multiple of the norm N 
one. 
(b) v2 = o. 
By Th. 5.5.1 we can choose a primitive idempotent u with uv = O. Decompose 
A with respect to u. From the classification of elements with square zero in 
Prop. 5.5.3 we infer that v E Eo with Q(v) = O. Using (5.14) we find for 
x = 'e + 17U + a + b (',17 E k, a E Eo, bE El): 
3Fv(x) = (V,x2) - (x,e)(v,x) = -('+17)(v,a) + (v,bob). 
The radical of Fv is easily seen to be 
Rv = {'(e - u) + a + b I' E k, a E Eo, (v, a) = 0, bEEt, vb = o}. 
The isotropic element v is contained in a hyperbolic plane in Eo. So there 
exist Xl E Eo with Q(xt} = i and c E e = xt n Eo with Q(c) = -i such 
that v is a nonzero multiple of Xl + c, say v = Xl + c. 
Decompose El = E+ Ee E_ with respect to Xl and write b = b+ + b_ 
with b± E E±. Then vb = i(b+ - L) + cb+ + cb_, so vb = 0 if and only if 
cL = -ib+ and cb+ = ib_. From L = 4cb+ it follows by Lemma 5.3.3 (i) 
that cL = 4c(cb+) = Q(c)b+ = -ib+. So vb = 0 is equivalent to b_ = 4cb+, 
hence 
A complementary subspace of Rv is 
for some fixed Vi E Eo, (v, Vi) = 1, Q(vt} = O. The quadratic form induced 
by Fv on AI Rv is equivalent to the restriction of Fv to Sv, which is given by 

5.7 Norm Class of a Primitive Idempotent 
149 
Sv is the orthogonal direct sum of the hyperbolic plane ke El1 kVl and E_. 
Hence Fv determines the restriction of Q to E_ up to equivalence. Since the 
latter is equivalent to a scalar multiple of the norm N on C, Fv determines 
N up to a scalar factor. 
0 
5.7 Norm Class of a Primitive Idempotent 
In a proper reduced J-algebra the isometry class of the restriction of Q to Eo 
is not independent of the choice of the primitive idempotent u. For x = ~Xl +c 
(~E k, c E C), 
1 
Q(x) = 4e + o:N(c) , 
where 0: = ~Q(a+)Q(a_) (cf. Prop. 5.4.4). The isometry class of this form 
depends on the class of 0: in k* modulo the subgroup 
N(C)* = {N(c) ICE C, N(c) -# O}. 
This class is denoted by ";(0:) and is called the norm class of 0:: 
";(0:) = o:N(C)* E k* jN(C)*. 
,,;( 0:) depends on the primitive idempotent u, but we claim that it is indepen-
dent of the choice of Xl E Eo with Q(Xl) = ~. For a different choice of Xl in 
Eo, say x~, leads to another composition algebra C' with norm N' and iden-
tity element c'. For X = ex~ +d (e E k, c' E C,), let Q(x) = ~e2 +0:' N'(c'). 
By Witt's Theorem, there exists a linear transformation t : C -+ C' such that 
o:N(c) = o:'N'(t(c)) (c E C). Take c E C with t(c) = c', then o:N(c) = 0:', 
which shows that 0:' has the same norm class as 0:. We may therefore call 
";(0:) the norm class of u, denoted by ,,;(u). 
Proposition 5.7.1 Let A be a proper reduced J-algebm, let u be a primitive 
idempotent in A and Xl E Eo with Q(Xl) = ~. Set 
T = (ke El1 ku El1 kXl).l = C El1 E l . 
The set of norm classes of the primitive idempotents in A coincides with 
{,,;(Q(t)) It E T, Q(t) -# O}. 
Proof. By Witt's Theorem, the restriction of the norm Q to T is independent 
of the special choice of u and Xl in A. We fix u and Xl. We are going to 
compute the norm classes ,,;(v) for the different primitive idempotents v. 
First assume (v, u) -# 0, so by Prop. 5.5.3, 
1 
v = (Q(b) + 1)-l(u + "2Q(b)(e - u) + bob + b) 
(b EEl, Q(b) f. -1). 

150 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
We determine the zero space Eb of v. Writing out the equation vx' = 0 for 
x' = ee + 'T]u + x + y with e, 'T] E k, x E Eo and y EEl, i.e., 
1 
(u + 2Q(b)(e - u) + bob + b)(ee + 'T]U + x + y) = 0, 
we arrive at the following four equations in e, 'T], x and y. 
1 
1 
1 
2Q(b)e+ 2(b ob,x) + "4(b,y) = 0, 
(5.36) 
111 
-2Q(b)e + e + 'T] - 2 (b 0 b, x) + "4 (b, y) = 0, 
(5.37) 
1 
2Q(b)x + eb 0 b + boy = 0, 
(5.38) 
1 
1 
1 
("4Q(b) + 2)y + (e + 2'T])b + (b 0 b)y + bx = O. 
(5.39) 
Multiplying equation (5.38) by 2b, we find with the aid of Lemma 5.3.3 (iv) 
and (v) 
1 
1 
1 
Q(b)bx + 2eQ(b)b + "4Q(b)y + "4( b, y)b - (b 0 b)y = O. 
(5.40) 
Adding equations (5.36) and (5.37), we find 
1 
1 
"4( b,y) = -2(e + 'T]). 
(5.41) 
From (5.39) we infer 
1 
1 
1 
(b 0 b)y = -( -Q(b) + -)y - eb - -'T]b - bx = 0 
422 
. 
If we substitute this and (5.41) into equation (5.40) and then divide this by 
hQ(b) + 1) (recall that Q(b) =1= -1), we find 
y = -2bx - eb. 
(5.42) 
Conversely, using Lemmas 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, we see that if y has this form the 
equations (5.36)-(5.39) hold if and only if 
(-Q(b) + l)e + 'T] - (b 0 b, x) = o. 
(5.43) 
The condition (x', e) = 0 is equivalent to 
3e + 1] = o. 
(5.44) 
Thus we find that the elements of Eb are of the form 
(e E k, x E Eo), 
(5.45) 

5.7 Norm Class of a Primitive Idempotent 
151 
where ~ and x have to satisfy 
-(Q(b) + 2)~ - (b 0 b, x) = o. 
(5.46) 
The norm Q on Eb is easily computed: 
Q(x') = (Q(b) + 3)e + (Q(b) + l)Q(x) + 2~( bob, x). 
(5.47) 
If Q(b) = -2, then by equation (5.46) (b 0 b,x) = O. In this case we 
choose Xl = ib 0 b, then Q(X1) = i and x E xt n Eo = C by (5.46). Take 
x~ = ~(e - 3u - b); according to equation (5.45) with ~ = ~ and x = 0, 
x~ E Eb and Q(x~) = i. Since (x',xU =~, the subspace C' = (xi)..L nEb 
consists of the elements 
x' = x - 2bx 
(x E C). 
(5.48) 
For such an element, 
Q(x') = (Q(b) + l)Q(x) 
(5.49) 
by (5.47), so K(V) = K(Q(b) + l)K(u). 
If Q(b) "# -2, -1, we get from (5.46): ~ = -(Q(b) + 2)-1( bob, x). Thus 
we find as elements of Eb: 
x' (x) = - (Q ( b) + 2) -1 ( bob, x )( e - 3u - b) + x - 2bx 
(x E Eo). 
An easy computation shows 
Q(x'(x)) = (Q(b) + l){Q(x) - (Q(b) + 2)-2(bo b,x)2}, 
and hence 
(x' (x), x' (y)) = (Q(b) + 1){ (x, y) - 2(Q(b) + 2)-2( bob, x)( bob, y)}. 
Now, in addition to Q(b) "# -2, -1, we assume Q(b) "# o. In this case we 
choose 
and 
x~ = ~Q(b)-l(Q(b) + 1)-l(Q(b) + 2)x'(b 0 b). 
Q(xt) = Q(xi) = i, as one easily verifies. C = {x E Eo I (b 0 b, x) = O} and 
C' = {x' (x) E Eb I x E C}. 
(5.50) 
For x E C, 
Q(x'(x)) = (Q(b) + l)Q(x), 
(5.51 ) 
so again we find K(V) = K(Q(b) + l)K(u). 
From equations (5.49) and (5.51) we conclude that the possible norm 
classes of primitive idempotents include all K(Q(b) + l)K(u) with b E El, 
Q(b)"# -1,0. We may drop the condition Q(b)"# 0 here, since K(U) is also a 

152 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
norm class. With the notations of § 5.4 it follows from Prop. 5.4.4 that K.( u) = 
K.(Q(a+)Q(a_)). We conclude that the possible norm classes of primitive 
idempotents we have found so far are the norm classes of the nonzero elements 
of the form 
(Ci E C). 
These are all K.(Q(t)) with t E T, Q(t) =I o. 
Now consider any primitive idempotent v. Pick a primitive idempotent 
U such that (v, u) = O. We remarked already that a change of u does not 
affect the possible values of Q on T. For such v it follows from the proof of 
Th. 5.6.1 that K.(v) = K.(Q(a+))K.(u) = K.(Q(a_)), so K.(v) = K.(Q(t)) for some 
tETwithQ(t) =10.

5.8 Isomorphism Criterion. Classification over Some 
Fields 
If two proper reduced J-algebras are isomorphic, the quadratic forms Q and 
Q' must be equivalent by Prop. 5.3.10, and by Th. 5.6.1 the associated com-
position algebras are isomorphic. We will now show the converse. 
Theorem 5.8.1 Two proper reduced J-algebras A and A' with isomorphic 
associated composition algebras are isomorphic if and only if the quadratic 
forms Q on A and Q' on A' are equivalent. If this is the case and if U E A 
and u' E A' are primitive idempotents, there exists an isomorphism of A onto 
A' which carries u to u' if and only if u and u' have the same norm classes: 
K.(u) = K.(u'). 
Proof. Assume Q and Q' are equivalent. Prop. 5.7.1 implies that we can 
choose primitive idempotents u E A and u' E A' such that their norm classes 
are the same. This implies that the restrictions of Q to Eo and of Q' to Eo are 
equivalent, hence the same holds for the restrictions of these quadratic forms 
to EI and E~ by Witt's Theorem. So we can pick a+ E EI and a~ E E~ 
such that Q(a+) = Q'(a~) =I O. Take Xl = ~Q(a+)-la+ 0 a+ E Eo; by 
Lemma 5.3.6, Q(xt} = ~ and a+ E E+. Similarly with a~ in A'. Choose any 
a_ E E_ with Q( a_) =I 0 and a'- E E'- with Q' (a'-) =I O. Since 
we may replace a'- by some a'-c' so as to make Q(a_) = Q'(a'-); here c' E C', 
the orthogonal complement of x~ in Eo, which as a composition algebra is 
isomorphic to the composition algebra C of A. 
Now it follows from the proof of Th. 5.4.5 that A and A' are isomorphic 
to the same algebra H(C;,),1,"Y2,')'3), viz. with 

5.8 Isomorphism Criterion. Classification over Some Fields 
153 
Under these isomorphisms the primitive idempotents u and u' are both 
mapped upon the matrix h(l, 0, OJ 0, 0, 0) with 1 in the left upper corner 
and zeros elsewhere. Thus we have found an isomorphism of A onto A' which

Corollary .5.8.2 If C is a split composition algebra, there is only one iso-
morphism class of proper reduced l-algebras with C as associated composition 
algebra. The automorphism group of such a l-algebra is transitive on primi-
tive idempotents. 
Proof. If C is split, its norm form N takes on all values in k. So the quadratic 
forms Q and Q' on any two proper reduced J-algebras which have C as 
associated composition algebra are necessarily equivalent (see equation (5.3) 
for the form of Q and Q'). Since k* jN(C)* has only one element in this case, 
there is only one norm class of primitive idempotents.

The above theorem reduces the classification of proper reduced J-algebras 
over a given field k to a problem about quadratic forms over k. We will dis-
cuss the situation for some special fields. We only consider Albert algebras, so 
the associated composition algebras are octonion algebras, since that is the 
case we are most interested in. We make use of the classification of octonion 
algebras over special fields that is given in § 1.10. 
(i) k algebraically closed. 
By Th. 5.5.2, A is reduced. There is only the split octonion algebra in this 
case, so Cor. 5.8.2 implies that all Albert algebras over k are isomorphic and 
that Aut(A) is transitive on primitive idempotents. 
(ii) k = R, the field of the reals. 
The cubic form det represents zero nontrivially over the quadratic extension 
C of R, hence so it does over R itself by Lemma 4.2.11. So Th. 5.5.2 implies 
that A is reduced. There are two isomorphism classes of octonion algebras C, 
the split algebra and the Cayley numbers. All reduced Albert algebras with 
split C are isomorphic and in that case Aut(A) is transitive on primitive 
idempotents. For the Cayley numbers, N is positive definite and takes on all 
positive values, so k* jN(C)* = {±1}. In this case there are two isomorphism 
classes of reduced Albert algebras, for as we see from equation (5.3) there 
are two inequivalent possibilities for the quadratic form Q, viz., the positive 
definite form with all 'Yi = 1 and the indefinite form with, e.g., '11 = '12 = 1, 
'13 = -1. In the positive definite case, all primitive idempotents have norm 
class 1, so Aut(A) is transitive on them. In the indefinite case, the norm class 
of a primitive idempotent can be 1 or -1, so then there are two transitivity 
classes of primitive idempotents under the action of Aut ( C).

5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
(iii) k a finite field. 
According to a theorem of Chevalley [Che 35, p. 75] (see also [Gre, Th. (2.3)], 
[Lang, third ed., 1993, p. 214, ex. 7], [Se 70, §2.2, Th. 3] or [Se 73, p. 5]), the 
cubic form det represents zero nontrivially over a finite field, so A is reduced 
by Th. 5.5.2. C must be the split octonion algebra, so there is one possibility 
for A, with Aut{A) acting transitively on the primitive idempotents. 
(iv) k a complete, discretely valuated field with finite residue class field. 
The cubic form det represents zero nontrivially (see [Sp 55, remark after 
Prop. 2], or [De] or [Le]) , so A is reduced. C is split, so there is one iso-
morphism class of Albert algebras A and Aut{A) acts transitively on the 
primitive idempotents. 
(v) k an algebmic number field. 
We know that every twisted composition algebra over such a field k is reduced 
(see the end of § 4.8). In the next chapter we will show that this implies that 
every Albert algebra over k is reduced (see Cor. 6.3.4). As in (v) of § 1.10 we 
use Hasse's Theorem on the classification of quadratic forms (see [O'M, §66]). 
There is only one possibility for kv ®k A at each finite or complex infinite 
place v by (iii) and (i) above. At each real place there are three possibilities as 
we saw in (ii), so we get 3r isomorphism classes of Albert algebras, r denoting 
the number of real places of k. For k = Q this leads to three isomorphism 
classes of Albert algebras, just as in the real case. 
5.9 Isotopes. Orbits of the Invariance Group of the 
Determinant 
In this last section of Ch. 5 we intend to prove a transitivity result for the lin-
ear transformations in a proper reduced J-algebra that leave the determinant 
invariant, a result we need in Ch. 7. For this purpose, we develop a procedure 
to construct from a J-algebra a new J-algebra with different identity element 
and different norm. We further characterize automorphisms of J-algebras by 
the fact that they leave e and the determinant invariant, also for use in Ch. 7. 
A is as in the previous sections. We first give two special cases of formula 
(v) in Lemma 5.2.1, which will be frequently used in this section. 
4{x x x) x (x x y) = det{x)y + 3(x,x,y}x 
2(x x x) x (y x y) + 4(x x y) x (x x y) = 
3( x,x, y}y + 3(x, y, y}x, 
(5.52) 
(5.53) 
where x, yEA. From the first formula we derive a simple but important 
lemma. 

5.9 Isotopes. Orbits of the Invariance Group of the Determinant 
155 
Lemma 5.9.1 If a, x E A and det(a) # 0, then a x x = 0 implies x = O. 
Proof. Since a x x = 0 we have 3( a, a, x) = (a, a x x) = O. From (5.52) we 
obtain det(a)x = O. Since det(a) # 0, we must have x = O. 
0 
Let a be an element of A with det(a) = >. # O. On the vector space A we 
define a symmetric bilinear form ( , )a by 
(x,Y)a = -6>.-1(x,y,a) + 9>.-2(x,a,a)(y,a,a) 
(x,y E A). 
(5.54) 
Notice that 
(x,a)a = 3>.-1(x,a,a), 
(5.55) 
whence (a,a) = 3. 
The form is nondegenerate. We have 
(x,Y)a = (x,-2>.-1 y x a+3>.-2(y,a,a)a x a). 
If this is zero for all x, then y x a = aa x a for some a E k, so (y-aa) x a = O. 
Then y = aa by the above Lemma, but (x, a)a is not identically zero, so 
y = O. 
Let Q a be the nondegenerate quadratic form on A whose associated bi-
linear form is ( , )a: 
(x E A). 
(5.56) 
By (5.55) we can also write this as 
-1 
1 
2 
Qa(x) = -3>. 
(x,x,a) + 2(x,a)a 
(x E A). 
(5.57) 
Further, we define a new product on A, for which the notation 'a will be used: 
-1 
1 
x'aY = 4>. 
(x x a) x (y x a) + 2((X,Y)a - (x,a)a(y,a)a)a 
(x,yEA). 
(5.58) 
Proposition 5.9.2 Let a E A with det(a) = >. # O. The algebra Aa which 
has the vector space structure of A, the norm Qa as in (5.56) and the product 
'a defined by (5.58), is a J-algebra with a as identity element. The determinant 
of Aa is 
deta(x) = >.-1 det(x) 
(x E A). 
For a = e we get the original J-algebra structure of A (with Qe = Q and 
dete = det). 
Aa is reduced or proper if and only if A is reduced or proper, respectively. 
If A is proper and reduced (hence so is Aa), then the composition algebras 
associated with Aa are isomorphic to those associated with A. 

156 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Proof. We first observe that Qa(a) = ~. Using (5.52) we derive from (5.58): 
(x E A), 
so a is an identity element of Aa. To verify (5.5) for Aa, we have to show that 
(x.aY, z)a is symmetric in x, y and z. From (5.54) we find 
(x.ay,z)a = -6>.-1(x.ay,z,a) +9>.-2(x.ay,a,a)(z,a,a). 
Substituting (5.58) into this, we get: 
3 
(x.ay,z)a = -24>.-2( (x x a) x (y x a),z,a) + '2>.-l(X,Y)a(z,a,a) 
3 
-'2>.-l(x,a)a(y,a)a(z,a,a) + 36>.-3(x x a) x (y x a),a,a)(z,a,a). 
The first term on the right hand side equals -24>'-2 (x X a, y x a, z X a), 
which is symmetric. The third term on the right is symmetric by (5.55). For 
the second term we find, using (5.54), 
3 '2>.-l(X,Y)a(z,a,a) = -9>.-2(x,y,a)(z,a,a)+ 
27 -2 
2">' 
(x,a,a)(y,a,a)(z,a,a). 
As to the fourth term, we have 
4( (x X a) X (y x a),a,a) = 4( (x x a) X (a X a),y,a). 
Applying (5.52) to the right hand side we get: 
so 
4( (x x a) X (y X a),a,a) = >.(x,y,a) + 3(x,a,a)(y,a,a), 
(5.59) 
36>.-3 ( (x x a) x (y x a),a,a)(z,a,a) = 9>.-2(x,y,a)(z,a,a)+ 
27>' -3 (x, a, a) (y, a, a) (z, a, a). 
We see that the contribution of the second plus the fourth term is symmetric. 
This proves the symmetry of (x.aY, z)a in x, y and z, and hence (5.5). 
Now to the proof of (5.4). We use the notation x·2 for X'aX. By (5.57), 
1 
Qa(x·2) = _3>.-1(x·2,x·2,a) + '2(x·2,a)~. 
If (x,a)a = 0, we get using (5.58) for -3>.-1(x·2,x·2,a): 
-3>. -1( 4>. -l(x x a) x (x X a) + Qa(x)a, 4>. -l(x x a) x (x x a) + Qa(x)a, a) = 

5.9 Isotopes. Orbits of the Invariance Group of the Determinant 
157 
-16A-3 (((x x a) x (x x a)) x ((x x a) x (x x a)),a) 
-24A-2Qa(X)((X x a) x (x x a),a,a) -3Qa(x)2. 
By Lemma 5.2.1 (iv) we get for the first term on the right hand side: 
-16A-3(det(x x a)x x a,a) = -48A-3 det(x x a)(x,a,a) = 
-16A-2det(x x a)(x,a)a = O. 
With (5.59) we find 
-24A -2Qa(X)( (x x a) x (x x a), a, a) = 
-6A-1Qa(X)(x,x,a) -18A-2Qa(X)(x,a,a)2 = 
2Qa(X)2 -
6A-IQa(X)(x,a)~ = 2Qa(X)2. 
Finally, by (5.5), 
1 
"2(x·2,a)~ = 2Qa(x)2. 
Adding up we get Qa(x·2) = Qa(x)2 if (x,a)a = o. Thus, Aa is a J-algebra. 
We now compute deta. Let Xa denote the cross product in Aa , corre-
sponding to ( , , )a according to (5.16). By Lemma 5.2.1 (i) and (5.58) we 
have: 
X xa X = 4A- 1(X x a) x (x x a) - (x,a)ax 
Using (5.53), (5.55) and (5.57), we find from (5.60): 
(x E A). 
(5.60) 
1 
x xax = -2A- 1(X x x) x (a x a) - (Qa(x) -
"2(x,a)~)a 
(x E A). (5.61) 
So for x E A, 
3 deta (x) = (x X a x, X ) a 
= -6A- 1(X xax,x,a) +9A-2(X xax,a,a)(x,a,a). (5.62) 
With (5.61) we calculate (x Xa x,x,a) as follows: 
-1 
1 
2 
(x Xa x,x,a) = -2A ((x x x) x (a x a),x,a) - (Qa(x) - "2(x,a)a)(x,a,a) 
1 
= -2A- 1((X x a) x (a x a),x,x) - (Qa(x) -
"2(x,a)~)(x,a,a) 
1 
1 
1 
2 
= -"2 det(x) - "6 A(Qa(X) - "2(x,a)a), 
the last equality coming from (5.52), (5.57) and (5.55). Similarly, one finds: 
1 
1 
2 
(x xax,a,a) = -3 A(Qa(X) - "2(x,a)a). 

158 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
Plugging in these two expressions one gets from (5.62) that deta{x) = 
>.-1 det{x) (x E A). 
In case a = e we have>. = det(e) = 1, so dete{x) = det(x) (x E A). For 
x,yE A, 
(x,y)e = -6(x,y,e) + 9(x,e,e)(y,e,e) 
= -2(x,y x e) + (x,e x e)(y,e x e). 
By Lemma 5.2.1 (i), x x e = -!x+ !(x, e )e. Using this formula, one derives 
by a straightforward computation that (x, Y)e = (x, y). In a similar way we 
find for x, YEA, 
1 
1 
X.eY = 4(x x e) x (y x e) + 2(x,y)e - 2(x,e)(y,e)e 
1 
1 
1 
1 
= x x y + 2(x, e)y + 2(y,e)x + 2(x, y)e - 2(x, e )(y,e )e, 
which equals xy by Lemma 5.2.1 (i). Thus we see that Ae = A. 
Aa and A have the same determinant function up to a nonzero factor, 
so they are simultaneously reduced or proper by Th. 5.5.2 and Cor. 5.4.6, 
respectively. The last result is a consequence of Th. 5.6.2, as we see by taking 
for t : A ---? Aa the identity map. 
0 
We call the J-algebra Aa an isotope of A, and these two J-algebras are 
said to be isotopic. 
The next proposition answers the question when two isotopes Aa and Ab 
are isomorphic. We also obtain a transitivity result for transformations of a 
J-algebra that leave the determinant invariant. This is the result we hinted 
at in the introductory paragraph of this section. 
An isomorphism t : Aa ---? Ab must carry the identity element to the 
identity element, so t( a) = b, and it must preserve the determinants, so 
detb(t(x)) = deta(x) (x E A), provided dimk(A) > 2 (see Prop. 5.3.10). 
Proposition 5.9.3 Let A be a proper J-algebm, and let a, b E A, with 
det(a) det(b) 1= o. The following are equivalent. 
(i) Aa ~ Ab. 
(ii) there exists a linear tmnsformation t : A ---? A such that t(a) = band 
(t(x), t(y), t(z) ) = det(a)-1 det(b)( x, y, z,) (x, y, z E A). 
If, moreover, A is reduced, the conditions are also equivalent to 
(iii) the bilinear forms det(a)-l( x, y, a) and det(b)-l( x, y, b) are equivalent. 
Proof. Recall that Aa and Ab are also proper. We noticed already the implica-
tion (i) => (ii). Also, (ii) => (iii) clearly holds in all cases. Because the algebra 
structure of Aa is completely determined by a (see (5.54) and (5.58)), (ii) 
implies (i). If A is reduced all Aa have isomorphic associated composition al-
gebras. That in this case (ii) and (iii) are equivalent follows from Th. 5.8.1. 0 

5.10 Historical Notes 
159 
Finally, we give a characterization of automorphisms of J-algebras. 
Proposition 5.9.4 If A is a J-algebm of dimension> 2, then a linear 
tmnsformation t of A is an automorphism if and only if t(e) = e and 
det(t(x)) = det(x) (x E A). 
Proof. The "only if" part is known (see Prop. 5.3.10); we prove the "if" part. 
Since Ae = A, 
(x,y) = -6(x,y,e} +9(x,e,e}(y,e,e} 
by (5.54). So a linear transformation t that leaves e and det invariant, also 
leaves ( , ) invariant. From 
(t(x x y),t(z)) = (x x y,z) 
= 3(x,y,z) 
it follows that 
= 3( t(x), t(y), t(z)) 
= (t(x) x t(y), t(z)) 
(x,y,z E A) 
t(x x y) = t(x) x t(y) 
(x,y E A). 
Using (i) of Lemma 5.2.1 one derives that t(xy) = t(x)t(y) (x, YEA).

5.10 Historical Notes 
Jordan algebms over the reals were introduced in the early thirties by the 
physicist P. Jordan, who proposed them in the foundation of quantum me-
chanics; see [Jo 32]' [Jo 33] and the joint paper [JoNW] with J. von Neumann 
and E. Wigner. The general theory over arbitrary fields of characteristic not 
two was developed by several people. We just mention A.A. Albert and N. J a-
cobson, in particular their joint paper [AlJa] where one finds among other 
things the classification of Albert algebms over real closed fields and algebraic 
number fields. 
The definition of J-algebms, a limited class of Jordan algebras including 
the Albert algebms, and the whole approach followed in the present chapter 
originates from T.A. Springer's paper [Sp 59]. 
The notion of isotopy of Jordan algebras was introduced by Jacobson, 
see [Ja 68, p.57]. The notion of isotopy introduced in 5.9 is an adaptation to 
J-algebras. 
The characterization of the automorphisms of a J-algebra in Prop. 5.9.4 
as the linear transformations that leave the cubic form det invariant and fix 
the identity element e was earlier proved by N. Jacobson in [Ja 59, Lemma 1]. 
C. Chevalley and R.D. Schafer [CheSch] gave an equivalent characterization, 

160 
5. J-algebras and Albert Algebras 
viz., as transformations that leave the quadratic form Q and the cubic form 
det invariant. They dealt with Lie algebras F 4 and E6 over algebraically closed 
fields in characteristic zero, so instead of automorphisms they considered 
derivations; see also H. Freudenthal [Fr 51J. 

6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition 
Algebras 
The study of J-algebras in the previous chapter has yielded a description of 
all reduced J-algebras. In the present chapter we develop another description 
of J-algebras which includes all nonreduced ones. For this purpose we make 
a link between J-algebras and twisted composition algebras. We will see that 
a J-algebra is reduced if and only if certain twisted composition algebras are 
reduced. This will lead to the result, already announced at the end of Ch. 5, 
that every J-algebra over an algebraic number field is reduced (see Cor. 6.3.4). 
As in the previous chapter, a field will always be assumed to have 
characteristic =/= 2,3. 
6.1 Reducing Fields of J-algebras 
Let A be a J-algebra over a field k. In Prop. 5.3.8 we saw that for a E A, the 
minimum polynomial rna divides the characteristic polynomial Xa and has 
the same roots. The following proposition is an immediate consequence. 
Proposition 6.1.1 IfXa is irreducible over k, then k[a] is a cubic extension 
field of k and Xa has a root in this field, viz., a itself. If Xa with a f/ ke is 
reducible over k, then k[a] contains an element x =/= 0 with x x x = o. So A 
is not reduced if and only if k[a] is a cubic extension field of k for all a f/ ke. 
Proof. If Xa is irreducible, rna = Xa. If Xa is reducible, it has a root in k 
since it is of degree 3. If not all roots of Xa in a splitting field are equal, k[a] 
contains a primitive idempotent. If Xa has three equal roots in k, then k[a] 
contains a nilpotent element, hence also an x =/= 0 with x 2 = O. In either case 
we find a nonzero x with x x x = 0, so A is reduced (see Th. 5.5.1). The rest 
is clear. 
0 
Thus, a nonreduced J-algebra A over k of dimension> 1 necessarily 
contains a cubic extension field l of k, viz., any k[a] for a 1. ke. In l ®k l there 
exist idempotents, hence l ®k A is reduced. We call an extension field l of k 
such that l ®k A is reduced a reducing field of A. A J-algebra is reduced if and 
only if the cubic form det represents zero nontrivially by Th. 5.5.2. Hence if 
A is not reduced and l is a reducing field of A, the cubic form det does not 

162 
6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition Algebras 
represent zero on A, but it does represent zero on l ®k Aj by Lemma 4.2.11 
the degree of lover k can not be 2. 
If A is not reduced and l is a reducing field, the reduced J-algebra l ®k A 
is either of quadratic type or proper (cf. Th. 5.4.5). This does not depend on 
the choice of l, for if l' is another reducing field, we pick a common extension 
m of land l', then the reduced algebras l ®k A and l' ®k A must be of the same 
type as m ®k A. So it makes sense to call a J-algebra A over k of quadratic 
type or proper according to whether l ®k A is of quadratic type or proper 
for any reducing field l of k. A is said to be an Albert algebra if and only if 
l ®k A is an Albert algebra for some (hence any) reducing field l. We will see 
towards the end of this chapter (see Cor. 6.3.3) that a nonreduced J-algebra 
must necessarily be proper. 
In a nonreduced J-algebra the cubic form det does not represent zero 
nontrivially by Th. 5.5.2, so by Lemma 5.2.3 every nonzero element has a 
J-inverse. For this reason, a nonreduced J-algebra (Albert algebra) is also 
called a J-division algebra (Albert division algebra, respectively). 
For given a E A with dimk k[a] = 3, we define F = k[a].L, so A = k[a] EB F 
as a vector space over k. We will in particular be interested in the case that 
k[a] is a field. From the structure of J-algebra on A we will derive a structure 
of twisted composition algebra on F over the field k[a] such that A is reduced 
if and only if F is reduced as a twisted composition algebra. Notice that if 
k[a] is of degree 3 over k and is not a field, then A is reduced anyway, as 
we saw above. By way of example, we first consider a simple situation, viz., 
a reduced J-algebra H(Cj'Yl,'Y2,'Y3) and a = h(al,a2,a3jO,O,O) with three 
distinct ai, in the notation of (5.1). Then 
k[a] = {h(6,6,6jO,O,O)16,6,6 E k} 
and 
F = {h(O, 0, OJ Cl, C2, C3) I Cl, C2, C3 E C}. 
So in this example k[a] is not a field, but a split cubic extension of k, and we 
will provide F with a structure of twisted composition algebra over a split 
cubic extension (viz., k[a]) of k as treated in the first part of § 4.3. This 
has sufficient analogy with the field case to exhibit essential phenomena. (If 
instead of the above split extension k[a] of k we have k[a] = l with l a cubic 
cyclic field extension of k, then Al = l ®k A will be a J-algebra over l and we 
may suppose that we are in the situation of the example with k replaced by 
l.) As action of k[a] on F we take 
b.x = -2b x x = -2bx + (b,e)x 
(b E k[a], 
x E F). 
Writing this out explicitly we find 
h(~l'~2,~3jO,0,0).h(0,0,OjCl,C2,C3) = h(0,0,0;~lCl'~2C2,~3C3), 
which is the natural structure of free k[a]-module on F. 

6.2 From J-algebras to Twisted Composition Algebras 
163 
On k[a] we consider an automorphism of order three: 
a(h(6,6,6;0,0,0)) = h(6,6,6;0,0,0). 
The group < a > can be considered as a "Galois group" of k[a] over k. 
We compute the cross product of two elements x = h(O, 0, 0; Cl, C2, C3) and 
y = h(O, 0, 0; db d2, d3) of F; using Lemma 5.2.1 we get: 
1 
+"2h(O, 0, 0; '2l,3(C2d3 + d2C3), '31'1 (C3dl + d3Cl), 'll,2(cld2 + dlC2)). 
If we define 
N(x, y) = h(r3 l ,2( Cl, dl ), ,ll,3( C2, d2 ), '21'1 (C3, d3 ); 0, 0, 0), 
-1 --
-1 --
-1 --
x*y=h(0,0,0;'2 ,3C2d3"3 ,lC3d1"1 ,2C1d2), 
we see that 
111 
x x y = --N(x, y) + -x * y + -y * x.

2 
N(, ) is a nondegenerate symmetric k[a]-bilinear form on the free k[a]-module 
F, associated with the quadratic form N() with N(x) = ~N(x, x), and * is a 
k-bilinear product in F which is a-linear in the first variable and a 2-linear in 
the second one. The conditions (ii) and (iii) of Def. 4.1.1 are easily verified, 
so F is a twisted composition algebra over the split cubic extension k[a] of k. 
We now return to the general case. 
6.2 From J-algebras to Twisted Composition Algebras 
We again consider an arbitrary a E A with dimk k[a] = 3, and F = k[aJl., so 
A = k[aJ EEl F. By Lemma 5.2.1 (i), k[aJ is closed under the cross product, 
i.e., b x c E k[aJ for b, C E k[aJ. From (5.5) we infer that k[aJF = F and from 
Lemma 5.2.1 (i) and (iii) we derive: 
2b x (b xx) = _b2 X X 
(b E k[a], x E F). 
(6.1) 
As in the example in the previous section, we introduce an action of k[a] on 
F by k-linear transformations: 
p(b)(x) = -2b x x = -2bx + (b, e)x 
(b E k[a], x E F). 
(6.2) 
(For the second equality, see (i) of Lemma 5.2.1.) Then p : k[a] ---t Endk(F) 
is k-linear, p(e) = id, and from equation (6.1) it follows that 
(b E klan. 

164 
6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition Algebras 
Linearizing this relation we obtain 
1 
p(bc) = 2 (P(b)p(c) + p(c)p(b)) 
(b,c E k[a]). 
Since p(a2) = p(a)2 it follows that p(a3) = p(a)3, from which we conclude 
that 
p(bc) = p(b)p(c) 
(b, c E k[a]). 
We can therefore define a structure of k[a]-module on F by 
b.x = p(b)(x) 
(b E k[a], x E F). 
(6.3) 
The product b.x written with a dot should be distinguished from the ordinary 
J-algebra product bx which is written without a dot. Notice that (Ae).x = AX 
for A E k and x E F, so we may identify k with the subfield ke of k[a], which 
will usually be done in the sequel. We will write be.x for (bc).x, which equals 
b.(c.x) (x E F, b,c E k[a]). 
From now on we assume that a is chosen such that k[a] is a field 01 degree 
3 over k, which we denote by I. As in Ch. 4, l' is the normal closure of lover 
k, so if Ilk is not Galois, then l' = l(.Ji5) with D a discriminant of Ilk. 
Further, k' = k(.Ji5). We fix a generator q of Gal( I' I k'), also considered as 
an element of Gal(l'lk) and as a k-isomorphism of 1 into I'. Finally, T is the 
element of Gal(I'lk) whose fixed field is I if l' 1= I, and T = id if If = I. We 
first express the cross product in 1 in terms of the field product and q. 
Lemma 6.2.1 For b, c E I, 
1 
b x c = 2(q(b)q2(C) + q2(b)q(c)). 
We have det(b) = NI/k(b) and b x b = N1/k(b)b- 1 il b f:: o. 
Proof. For bEL, the Hamilton-Cayley equation 
1 
b3 - (b, e )b2 - (Q(b) - 2( b, e )2)b - det(b) = 0 
has roots b, q(b) and q2(b) in l', whence 
b+q(b) +q2(b) = Trl/k(b) = (b,e) 
and 
bq(b)q2(b) = NI/k(b) = det(b). 
(6.4) 
Using part (ii) of Lemma 5.2.1 we obtain the last formulas of the lemma. We 
also see that b x b = q(b)q2(b), from which we obtain the first formula.

A and F are vector spaces over I; recall that A = 1 EEl F. To prepare for 
a structure of twisted composition algebra over I on F, we define the maps 
N : F x F -+ I and 1 : F x F -+ F by 
1 
XXY=-2N(x,y)+/(x,y) 
(X,yEF). 
(6.5) 

6.2 From J-algebras to Twisted Composition Algebras 
165 
Lemma 6.2.2 N is a nondegenerate symmetric I-bilinear form on F. 
Proof. Symmetry and k-bilinearity are clear. For bEL and x, y E F we have: 
(b.x,y) = -2(b x x,y) = -2(b,x x y) = (b,N(x,y)). 
Using this repeatedly, we derive for b, eEL and x, y E F: 
(c, N(b.x, y) ) = (cb.x, y) = (cb, N(x, y)) = (c, bN(x, y) ). 
This implies that N(b.x, y) = bN(x, y), so N is a symmetric l-bilinear form. 
If x E F satisfies N(x, y) = 0 for all y E F, then 
(x,y) = (e.x,y) = (e,N(x,y)) =0 
(y E F) 
(6.6) 
and hence x = O. Thus, N is nondegenerate. 
o 
From (6.4) and (6.6) we infer that 
(x, y) = TrI/k(N(x, y)) 
(x,y E F). 
(6.7) 
Put N(x) = !N(x,x). 
Now we focus attention on the component f(x, y) of x x y in F .. 
Proposition 6.2.3 With squaring operation 
X*2 = f(x,x) 
(x E F) 
and norm N, F is a twisted composition algebra over l (not necessarily nor-
mal). 
Proof. (a) It is obvious that f is symmetric and k-bilinear. Linearizing (ii) in 
Lemma 5.2.1, we find: 
b(x x y) + x(b x y) + y(b x x) = 3(x,y,b)e 
(b E l, x, Y E F). 
The right hand side equals (x x y, b )e, in which we replace x x y by its 
component in l. Thus we get 
1 
b(x x y) +x(b x y) +y(b x x) = -"2(N(x,y),b)e 
(b E l, x, Y E F). 
From this formula we derive by equating the components in F on either side 
and using (6.2), (6.5) and Lemma 5.2.1 (i): 
f(b.x,y) + f(x,b.y) = «(b,e) - b)·f(x,y) 
(x, y E F, bEl). 
(6.8) 
Using the symmetry of f we conclude that 
1 
f(x,b.x) = 2«(b,e) - b)f(x,x). 

166 
6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition Algebras 
Now (6.8) gives 
f(b.x,b.x) = -f(x,b2.x) + ((b,e) - b)f(x,b.x) = 
1 2(-(b2,e) + b2 + ((b,e) - b)2)f(x,x). 
From (6.2) we see that Trl/k(b) - b = a(b) + a2(b), and similarly for b2. 
Inserting these formulas we obtain 
f(b.x, b.x) = a(b)a2(b)f(x, x) 
(b E l, x E F). 
This shows that the squaring operation defined by X*2 = f(x,x) for x E F 
satisfies condition (i) of Def. 4.2.1. 
(b) It is obvious that condition (ii) of Def. 4.2.1 is fulfilled, for 
(x + y) *2 -x *2 _y *2 = 2f(x, y) 
with f as in (6.5), and this is k-bilinear. 
(c) By Lemma 5.2.1 (iv), we know that 
(x,y E F) 
(x x x) x (x x x) = det(x)x. 
On the other hand, we infer from (6.5) that 
xxx=-N(X)+x*2. 
This yields 
(6.9) 
(6.10) 
(x x x) x (x x x) = N(x) x N(x) + N(x).x *2 -N(x *2) + (x *2) *2. (6.11) 
In (6.9) the right hand side has zero component in l, so the same must hold 
in (6.11). Thus we find with Lemma 6.2.1, 
N(X*2) = N(x) x N(x) = a(N(x))a2(N(x)) 
(x E F), 
which proves (iii) in Def. 4.2.1. 
(d) Using Lemma 5.2.1 (i) and (ii) and equation (6.10), we compute: 
1 
1 
x x (x x x) = det(x) + 2(N(x),e)x - 2(x,x*2). 
(6.12) 
On the other hand, we find with (6.10) and (6.5): 
x x (x x x) = x x (-N(x) +X*2) 
1 
= 2(N(x).x - N(X,X*2)) + f(x,X*2). 
(6.13) 
The l-component on the right hand side of equation (6.12) is in k, so the same 
must hold for (6.13), Le., N(x, x *2) E k. This proves (iv) of Def. 4.2.1.

6.3 From Twisted Composition Algebras to J-algebras 
167 
Let u be a nonzero element of l. So A = det(u) = NI/k(U) =1= o. Then the 
isotope Au is defined. see § 5.9. By (5.58) and (5.61) the product on Au is 
given by 
1 
1 
x·uy = -2A((XXY)X(UXU))+"2r1(x,UXU)Y+"2A-1(y,uxu)x (x,y E A). 
(6.14) 
Notice that A -1 (u xu) = U -1. 
For x, y E l we obtain from part (iii) of Lemma 5.2.1 in a straightforward 
manner that X.uuy = u-1(xy). It follows that a also generates in the algebra 
Au the vector space l. Moreover, we see from (5.54) that the orthogonal 
complement of l relative to ( , ) is again F. We now have on F a new 
structure of l-module 
(b,x) ~ Pu(b)x = -2b Xu x (b E l,x E F). 
Using the bilinear version of (5.61) we see that this equals u-1.(b.x) 
(u- 1b).x. Likewise, we find for the bilinear function fu associated to the 
J-algebra Au that 
fu(x, y) = u-1·f(x, y). 
Let F be as in Prop. 6.2.3. The preceding results prove imply the following 
result. 
Proposition 6.2.4 The twisted composition algebra associated to the isotope 
Au is the isotope FU-l of F. 
Isotopes of twisted composition algebras were defined in § 4.2. 
6.3 From Twisted Composition Algebras to J-algebras 
Consider a twisted composition algebra F over a cubic extension field l of k; 
let I' be the normal closure of lover k as in the previous section, etc. We 
construct from F a J-algebra, which will turn out to be proper. Denote the 
multiplication of elements of F by elements of l by a dot, so A.X for A E l 
and x E F; let N be the norm on F and N(, ) the associated l-bilinear form. 
Take A = l E!7 F as a vector space over k. On l we define the quadratic form 
1 
2 
Q(A) = "2 TrI/k(A ) 
(A E l), 
(6.15) 
with associated bilinear form 
(6.16) 
Since 1, 0- and 0-2 are linearly independent over l' by Dedekind's Theorem, Q 
is nondegenerate. In accordance with (6.7), Q is extended to a nondegenerate 
quadratic form on A by defining 

168 
6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition Algebras 
Q(A + x) = Q(A) + (N(x), e) 
1 2 
= TrI/k("2A + N(x» 
The associated bilinear form is 
(A + x, j.£ + y) = TrI/k(Aj.£ + N(x, y» 
Define the k-bilinear 
(A E l, x E F). 
(A,j.£ E l, x,y E F). 
1 
f: F x F -+ F, f(x,y) = "2«x + y) *2 _X*2 _y*2). 
The cross product x in A is defined by 
1 
(A + x) x (j.£ + y) = "2{ U(A)U2(j.£) + U2(A)U(j.£) - N(x, y)}+ 
(6.17) 
(6.18) 
1 
f(x, y) - "2(A.y + j.£.x), 
(6.19) 
where A, j.£ E l, x, Y E F (cf. Lemma 6.2.1 and equations (6.2) and (6.5». 
Define the cubic form det on A by 
3 det( a) = (a, a x a) 
(cf. the definition of the cross product as given in (5.16». An easy computa-
tion shows that 
det(A + x) = NI/k(A) - TrI/k(AN(x» + T(x) 
(A E l, x E F), 
(6.20) 
with T(x) = (X*2,X) as in Def. 4.2.1 (iv). We define the ordinary product 
on A as is to be expected from Lemma 5.2.1 (i): 
1 
111 
ab = a x b+ "2(a,e)b+ "2(b,e)a+ "2(a,b)e - "2(a,e)(b,e)e. 
(6.21) 
A straightforward computation yields: 
1 
(A + x)(j.£ + y) = Aj.£ + "2{u(N(x, y» + u2(N(x, y»}+ 
1 
f(x, y) + "2{(U(A) + U2(A».y + (u(j.£) + u2(j.£».x}. 
(6.22) 
Notice that AX = A.X for A E k and x E F, but this equality need not hold 
with arbitrary A E l. The multiplication 
l x F -+ F, (A, x) ~ AX 
does not define a structure of vector space over l on F, since A(j.£X) and (Aj.£)X 
are not equal in general. 
The cross product and the ordinary product on A are both commutative 
and k-bilinear, and the identity element e of l and k is also identity element 
for the product in A. Thus, A with the ordinary product is a commutative, 
not necessarily associative, algebra over k. We will show that it is a proper 
J-algebra. 

6.3 From Twisted Composition Algebras to J-algebras 
169 
Definition 6.3.1 For a cubic extension I of k and a twisted composition 
algebra F over I, the k- algebra I tJJF provided with the product as in (6.21) 
together with the quadratic form Q as defined by (6.17) is denoted by A(l, F) 
and will be called the l-algebra associated with I and F. 
Theorem 6.3.2 If I is a cubic extension of the field k and F a twisted com-
position algebra over I, the algebra A(l, F) is a proper l-algebra over k. Every 
l-algebra over k that contains an element a such that k[a] is a cubic field ex-
tension of k is of the form A(l, F), viz., with I = k[a] and F = k[aj-L. 
A(l, F) is reduced as a l-algebra if and only if F is reduced as a twisted 
composition algebra. 
Proof. We first verify the conditions (5.4) - (5.6) for A(l, F); we start with a 
purely technical result. 
(a) If Trl/k(.\) = 0, then Trl/k(.\4) = 2 TrI/k(.\2O'(.\)2). This is easily verified 
by computing the fourth power of (.\ + 0'(.\) + 0'2(.\)) and equating this to O. 
(b) To prove (5.4), consider a = .\ + x (.\ E I, x E F) with (a, e) = 0, i.e. 
with Trl/k(.\) = O. It is straightforward to compute Q(a2) and Q(a)2 and to 
verify that these are equal, using Trl/k(.\) = 0 and the result of (a). 
(c) For a = .\ + x, b = J-L + Y and c = 1/ + z (.\, J-L, 1/ E I, x, y, z E F) we find 
after some computing: 
where t stands for 
1 
.\J-LI/ + 2{(O'(I/) + O'2(1/))N(x, y) + (0'(.\) + O'2(.\))N(y, z) + 
(O'(J-L) + 0'2 (J-L))N(x, z)} + N(f(x, y), z). 
If we extend F to a normal twisted composition algebra over I' (d. Prop. 4.2.2), 
we get 
1 
1 
N(f(x, y), z) = 2N(x * y, z) + 2N(y * x, z). 
By Def. 4.1.1 (iii), N(x*y, z) = O'(N(y*z, x)), so Tr1/k(N(x*y, z)) is invariant 
under cyclic permutations of X,y and z, and similarly for Tr1/k(N(y * x, z)). 
Hence ( ab, c) is invariant under cyclic permutations of a,b and c. This proves 
(5.5). 
(d) From the definition of Q in (6.17) it is immediate that Q(e) = 
~, as 
required in (5.6). This completes the proof that A(l, F) is a J-algebra. 
(e) We now want to prove that A(l, F) is proper. To this end, we consider 
A(l, F)l = I Q9k A(l, F) = I Q9k I tJJ I Q9k F. 
This is an algebra over I with I acting on the first factor of the tensor product. 
The action of a on I is extended to I Q9k I as 1 Q9k O'. There are three orthogonal 

170 
6. Proper J-algebras and Twisted Composition Algebras 
primitive idempotents Cl, C2, C3 in I ®k I, which are permuted cyclically by 0': 
O'(ci) = Ci-l (indices mod 3). 
We consider the product I x F -
F, (A, x) 1--+ A.X as a k-bilinear trans-
formation and extend it to an I-bilinear product on (l ®k l) x (l ®k F), also 
denoted by a dot (.). Similarly, we consider the I-bilinear form N( , ) asso-
ciated with the norm N of the (not necessarily normal) twisted composition 
algebra F as a k-bilinear form and extend it to an I-bilinear form on I ®k F, 
denoted by N(, )j this form is nondegenerate. 
For a E 1 ®k 1 define the I-linear transformation 
to: : 1 ®k F -I ®k F, x 1--+ o:x. 
From (6.22) one infers that to:(x) = !((7(0:) + (72(0:)).x (x E I ®k F). Since 
N( , ) is I-bilinear on F, to: is symmetric for all 0: E 1 ®k I, for 
1 
N(to:(x), y) = N("2((7(O:) + (72(0:)).X, y) 
1 
= N(x, "2((7(0:) + (72(0:)).y) 
= N(x, to: (y)) 
(x, y E F). 
Hence to: is symmetric on I ®k F for all 0: E I ®k l. 
In particular, 
(indices mod 3). Each te; is a symmetric linear transforma.tion with t~; = ~te;, 
so 1 ®k F is the direct sum of eigenspaces of te; with eigenvalues 0 and ~. 
Since te; and tej commute, they leave each other's eigenspaces invariant. As 
tel + te2 + tea = id and tel te2 tea = 0, the eigenspaces with eigenvalue 0 have 
dimension over 1 equal to dim, F and the eigenspaces with eigenvalue ! have 
dimension 2 dim, F. 
We pick the idempotent u = Cl in A(I, F),. By the preceding argument, 
dim, Eo > 0 and dim, El > O. It follows that A(I, F)" hence also A(I, F) 
itself, is proper (see Th. 5.4.5 and its proof). 
(f) By Th. 5.5.1, A(I, F) is reduced if and only if there exists A+X # 0 (A E l, 
x E F) such that (A + x) x (A + x) = o. By (6.19), the latter is equivalent to 
and 
(6.23) 
So, if A(l, F) is reduced, then F is reduced by Th. 4.2.10. 
Conversely, if F is reduced, pick a nonzero x E F such that x *2 = A.X for 
some A E I. By condition (iii) in Def. 4.2.1, 
(6.24) 
By action of 0' and (72, respectively, on this equation we get two equations: 

6.4 Historical Notes 
171 
a2(N(x))N(x) = a(A2)a(N(x)), 
N(x)a(N(x)) = a2(A2)a2(N(x)). 
Multiplying these two equations we find: 
N(x)2a(N(x))a2(N(x)) = (a(A)a2(A))2 a(N(x))a2(N(x)). 
If N(x) i- 0, this implies N(x) = ±a(A)a2(A). From N(x) = -a(A)a2(A) it 
would follow that 
which contradicts (6.24). So N(x) = a(A)a2(A) if x *2 = A.X and N(x) i- 0, 
hence x satisfies (6.23) and therefore A(l, F) is reduced. 
Now let x *2 = A.X and N(x) = O. As we saw in step (a) of the proof 
of Th. 4.1.10, either x *2 = 0, hence x satisfies (6.23) with A = 0, or for 
y = x *2 i- 0 we have y *2 = 0 and N(y) = 0, so y (instead of x) satisfies 
(6.23) with A = O. Again we conclude that A(l, F) is reduced. 
0 
If the J-algebra A with dimk A > 1 is not reduced, it certainly contains 
a cubic extension field l = k[a] of k. By the above theorem, A is of the form 
A(l, F) and therefore proper. Thus we have found: 
Corollary 6.3.3 If a l-algebra A is not reduced, then it is proper. In partic-
ular, a non reduced l-algebra of dimension 27 is an Albert division algebra. 
The above theorem implies that if a field k has the property that every 
twisted composition algebra over a cubic extension of k is reduced, then every 
J-algebra over k is reduced. For fields k with this property, see, e.g., Th. 4.8.3. 
Examples are the algebraic number fields. We have seen at the end of 4.8 
that every twisted composition algebra of dimension 8 over a cubic extension 
of an algebraic number field is reduced. Together with the above theorem this 
gives the result we announced in (v) at the end of Ch. 5: 
Corollary 6.3.4 Over an algebraic number field every Albert algebra is re-
duced. 
6.4 Historical Notes 
As remarked in the historical note to Ch. 4, the use of twisted composition 
algebras for the description of proper J-algebras stems from T.A. Springer 
(see [Sp 63]). With this device, Springer managed to prove that every Albert 
algebra over an algebraic number field is reduced, a result originally proved 
in a quite different way by A.A. Albert (see [AI 58, Th. 10]; in that paper, 
Albert also proved that Albert algebras over real closed fields are reduced). 

7. Exceptional Groups 
In this chapter we identify two algebraic groups associated with Albert alge-
bras. We first determine the automorphism group; this will be shown to be 
an exceptional simple algebraic group of type F 4. Then we study the group 
of transformations that leave the cubic form det invariant and show that this 
is a group of type E6 • 
As in the previous two chapters, all fields are supposed to have charac-
teristic =/:- 2,3. We mainly deal with Albert algebras, but several results hold, 
more generally, for proper J-algebras. 
7.1 The Automorphisms Fixing a Given Primitive 
Idempotent 
In this section we study Aut(A)u, the group of automorphisms of a proper 
reduced J-algebra A that fix a given primitive idempotent u. For some results, 
we will have to restrict to reduced Albert algebras. Notations being as in § 5.3, 
an automorphism s that fixes u must leave invariant the zero space Eo and 
the half space El defined by u. Since s is orthogonal, it induces orthogonal 
transformations t in Eo and v in E 1; we will see in Th. 7.1.3 that t must even 
be a rotation. The fact that s is an automorphism implies that t and v satisfy 
the relation 
v(xy) = t(x)v(y) 
This situation will first be analyzed. That analysis will lead to Th. 7.1.3, 
which identifies Aut(A)u as the spin group of the restriction of Q to Eo. 
Proposition 7.1.1 (i) Let A be a proper reduced J-algebm. Let u be a 
primitive idempotent and Eo and El the zero and half space, respectively, 
of u in A. For every rotation t of Eo there exists a similarity v of El such 
that 
v(xy) = t(x)v(y) 
(7.1) 
If t = Sal Sa2 ... Sa2h for certain ai E Eo, then one may take for v the following 
map: 

174 
7. Exceptional Groups 
(ii) Assume that A is an Albert algebra. Then for any rotation t of Eo the 
similarity v of El such that equation (7.1) is satisfied is unique up to multipli-
cation by a nonzero scalar, and the square class of the multiplier of v equals 
the spinor norm oft: v(v) = a(t). Moreover, ift is an orthogonal transfor-
mation of Eo which is not a rotation, then there does not exist a similarity v 
of El satisfying (7.1). 
Proof. This result is somewhat similar to the Principle of Triality, and the 
proof resembles the proof we gave for that Principle in Th. 3.2.l. 
First consider a reflection Sa: X t--> X - Q(a)-l(x,a)a in Eo. We have 
1 
a(xy) = -x(ay) + 4(a,x)y 
(by Lemma 5.3.3 (ii)) 
= -(x - Q(a)-l(a,x)a)(ay) 
(by Lemma 5.3.3 (i)) 
= -sa(x)(ay) 
(x E Eo, y E Ed. 
From Lemma 5.3.3 (vi) we infer that y t--> ay is a similarity with multiplier 
iQ(a). 
It is easily seen that if (tl. vt) and (t2, V2) satisfy equation (7.1), then so 
does (tlt2,vlV2). Since every rotation t is a product of an even number of 
reflections, the existence of a similarity v such that (7.1) holds easily follows. 
The square class of the multiplier of this v evidently equals the spinor norm 
of t. 
Assume that A is an Albert algebra. To prove the uniqueness statement 
of (ii), it suffices to prove that t = id implies v = A. id for some A E k*. So 
let v be a similarity of El with 
v(xy) = xv(y) 
Now we saw in Cor. 5.3.4 that there is a representation cp of the Clifford 
algebra Cl(Q; Eo) in El such that cp(x)(y) = 2xy (x E Eo, y EEl). We 
have dim Eo = 9, dimE1 = 16 and dimCl(Q;Eo) = 29. Over an algebraic 
closure K of k it is the sum of two full matrix algebras of dimension 28 , so the 
irreducible representations have dimension 16. Hence cp must be absolutely 
irreducible. The endomorphism v of El commutes with the representation cp, 
so it follows from Schur's Lemma that v = A. id for some A E k. 
Finally, let t be an orthogonal transformation of Eo which is not a rotation 
and suppose there exists a similarity v of El such that (7.1) holds. Write 
t = Satl with a reflection Sa and a rotation tl , and pick a similarity Vi 
of El such that tIl and Vi satisfy (7.1). We saw above that there exists a 
similarity V2 of El , viz. V2(y) = ay, such that V2(XY) = -Sa(X)V2(Y). Then 
for w = VVl V2 we find 
w(xy) = -xw(y) 
(x E Eo, y E Ed. 
Using again the representation cp of the Clifford algebra Cl( Q; Eo) in E 1, 
we see that wcp(x) = -cp(x)w for x E Eo. It follows that w2 commutes 

7.1 The Automorphisms Fixing a Given Primitive Idempotent

with the representation cp, so w2 = >..2. id for some>.. E k. Over k we have 
El = W + EB W _ with W ± the eigenspace of w for the eigenvalue ±>... If 
x E Eo, then cp(x) interchanges the eigenspaces, so they have equal dimen-
sion. The even Clifford algebra Cl+(Q; Eo) leaves W+ and W_ invariant. In 
case dime = 8, Cl+(Q;Eo) is a full matrix algebra of dimension 28 , so its 
irreducible representations have dimension 16. This contradicts the fact that 
the restriction of cp to Cl+(Q; Eo) has invariant subspaces W+ and W_ of 
dimension 8.

To prepare the way for Th. 7.1.3 we need a lemma. Notations as before. 
Lemma 7.1.2 In a proper reduced J-algebra we have for any rotation t of 
Eo and similarity v of El satisfying equation (7.1), 
v(y) 0 v(y) = n(v)t(y 0 y) 
Proof. In the equation v(xy) = t(x)v(y) we replace x by y 0 y; using 
Lemma 5.3.3 (iv), we then find 
1 
t(y 0 y)v(y) = '4Q(y)v(y) 
Assume Q(y) f= O. With Xl = Q(y)-lt(yoy) we have Q(Xl) = i and XlV(Y) = 
iv(y), so v(y) E E+ if we decompose El in E+ and E_ with respect to Xl, 
as in § 5.4. By Lemma 5.4.2 (i), 
v(y) 0 v(y) = Q(V(Y))X1 = n(v)t(y 0 y). 
Working over an algebraic closure of k, this relation holds on all of E1 by 
Zariski continuity.

Theorem 7.1.3 Let A be a reduced Albert algebra over k, u a primitive 
idempotent and Eo and El the zero and half spaces of u in A. The restriction 
mapping 
ResEo : s f-t slEo 
(s E Aut(A)u) 
is a homomorphism of Aut(A)u onto the reduced orthogonal group O'(Q; Eo) 
with kernel of order two. 
Proof. Let s be an automorphism of A with su = u. As we remarked at 
the beginning of this section, s leaves Eo and E1 invariant, and induces 
orthogonal transformations t and v in Eo and E1, respectively. Since s is an 
automorphism, t and v satisfy the relation (7.1). This implies by Prop. 7.1.1 
that t is a rotation. Since v is orthogonal, n(v) = 1 and hence O'(t) = 1. Thus 
we have a homomorphism 
ResEo : Aut(A)u ~ O'(Q; Eo), s f-t slEo. 

176 
7. Exceptional Groups 
Conversely, given a rotation t of Eo with a(t) = 1, we choose a similarity 
v of E1 such that (7.1) holds. Since lI(v) = a(t) = 1, we may choose v 
such that n( v) = 1, so v is an orthogonal transformation. Define the linear 
transformation s : A ~ A by 
s(e) = e, 
s(u) = u, 
slEo = t and 
SIEl = v. 
With Lemma 7.1.2 one easily verifies that s(z2) = s(z)2 for Z E A; since 
the product in A is commutative, s is an automorphism of A. This proves 
surjectivity of Res Eo : Aut(A)u ~ O'(Q; Eo). 
If t = id, then v = A. id by Prop. 7.1.1; but since v is orthogonal in 
the present situation, v = ± id. Hence the kernel of Res Eo consists of two 
elements.

In Prop. 7.1.1 we found a relation between spinor norms of rotations in 
Eo and square classes of multipliers of similarities in E1. We are now going 
to show that the group of spinor norms in Eo coincides with the group of 
square classes of multipliers in E1. First a lemma. 
Lemma 7.1.4 Let A be a proper reduced J-algebra. For any y, z E E1 satis-
fying Q(y)Q(z) =I 0 there exist elements a1, a2, ... , al E Eo such that 
z = a1(a2(··· (alY)·· .)). 
It is always possible to do this with an even number l of multiplications. 
Proof. The notations are as in § 5.4. We first consider the case that yo y = 
AZOZ for some A E k*; this implies that Q(y)2 = ..\2Q(z)2, so Q(y) = ±..\Q(z). 
Take Xl = Q(Z)-l Z 0 z. Then Q(X1) = ~ and X1Z = ~z, so z E E+. Further, 
X1Y = ±~y, so y E E±. If y E E_, there is e E C such that z = cy (by 
Lemma 5.4.3, with a_ = y and a+ = z). If y E E+, we pick any e E C with 
Q(c) =I 0, then y' = ey E E_, so we can find dEC such that e'y' = z. 
Now assume that y 0 y and z 0 z are linearly independent. For Q: = 
Q(y)Q(z)-l we have Q(y 0 y) = Q:2Q(z 0 z) = Q(Q:z 0 z). By Witt's Theorem 
there exists an orthogonal transformation t of Eo such that t(y 0 y) = Q:Z 0 z; 
since dim(Eo) > 1, we may assume that t is a rotation. Write t as a product 
of reflections, t = Sal Sa2 ... Sal. By Prop. 7.1.1, the similarity 
V: E1 ~ El, w I--t a1(a2(··· (alw)···)) 
satisfies relation (7.1). By Lemma 7.1.2, 
v(y) 0 v(y) = n(v)t(y 0 y) = AZ 0 z. 
So by the first part of the proof, v(y) can be transformed into z by one or 
two multiplications by elements of Eo. 
If in this way we end up with an odd number of multiplications, we can 
multiply in addition by 4Xl with Xl = Q( z) -1 Z 0 Z as in the first part of the 
proof, since 4X1Z = z.

7.1 The Automorphisms Fixing a Given Primitive Idempotent 
177 
Proposition 7.1.5 Let A be a proper reduced J-algebm, u a primitive idem-
potent and Eo and El the zero and half spaces, respectively, of u in A. The 
group of spinor norms of rotations of Eo with respect to QIEo coincides with 
the group of square classes of multipliers of similarities of El with respect to 
QIEl · 
Proof. In view of Prop. 7.1.1 it suffices to show that for every similarity v of 
El there exists a rotation t of Eo such that cr(t) = II(V). Pick y E El with 
Q(y) =1= O. Applying the preceding lemma to y and z = v(y), we obtain an 
even number of elements al. a2, . .. ,al of Eo such that 
v(y) = al(a2('" (am)" .)). 
Then n(v) = Q(at)Q(a2)'" Q(az). So for the rotation 
one has indeed cr(t) = II(V). 
o 
More explicitly, this proposition says that the group of spinor norms of 
the quadratic form e + aN ( c) in dim C + 1 variables coincides with the group 
of square classes of multipliers of similarities with respect to the quadratic 
form N(c) + aN(c') in 2 dimC variables (for those a E k* whose norm class 
x;(a) is the norm class of a primitive idempotent u E A; cf. § 5.7). 
We next discuss the algebraic groups occurring of the situation of the 
present section. As in previous chapters we denote algebraic groups by 
boldface letters. Let again K denote an algebraic closure of K and put 
AK = K 0k A etc. View A as a subset of AK. 
The group Aut(AK)u is an algebraic group, denoted by Gu. Further, we 
have the spin group Spin(Q; Eo). 
Proposition 7.1.6 G u is isomorphic to Spin(Q, Eo). 
Proof. The spin group Spin(Q; Eo) is the subgroup of the even Clifford al-
gebra Cl+(Q; EO)K consisting of the products s = al 0 ... 0 a2h with ai E Eo, 
Q(ai) = 1, see § 3.1. For such an s define 1jJ(s) E G u to be the linear map of 
AK fixing e, u, Eo and El , such that 1jJ(s)IEo = Sal"'Sa2h and 
(y E Ed. 
Then 1jJ is a homomorphism of algebraic groups. It follows from Th. 7.1.3 
that it is bijective. 
Let 7r : Spin( Q; Eo) -t SO( Q; Eo) be the canonical homomorphism. Then 
7r = ResEo o1jJ. Since the characteristic is not 2, 7r is a separable homomor-
phism. Hence the Lie algebra homomorphism d7r is bijective (see [Sp 81, 4.3.7 
(ii)]. But then d1jJ also must be bijective. It follows that 1jJ is an isomorphism 
(see [loc.cit., 5.3.3]).

7. Exceptional Groups 
Corollary 7.1. 7 The Lie algebm L = L(Gu ) is the space of derivations d of 
AK with du = O. 
Proof. By [Hu, p. 77], L is contained in the space S of these derivations (cf. 
2.4.5). If dES then de = du = 0, and d(Ei) C Ei (i = 0,1). Put di = diE;. 
From Lemma 5.3.2 we see that 
for x, y E Ei . In particular, for x E Eo we have that do (x) is skew symmetric 
relative to QIEo' Using [Sp 81, 7.4.7 (3)] it follows that d 1--+ do is a linear 
map of S to L(SO(Q; Eo)). If x E Eo and do(x) = 0 then dl(xy) = xdl(y) 
for y EEl. Arguing as in the proof of the uniqueness part of Prop. 7.1.1 we 
see that dl = >. id. But since >.( y, y) = (y, dl (y) ) = 0 (y EEl) we must have 
>. = O. Hence the map d 1--+ do of S is injective. It follows that 
dimL:::; dimS:::; dimL(SO(Q;Eo}} = dimSO(Q;Eo) = dimGu = dimL. 
It follows that S =L, as asserted.

7.2 The Automorphism Group of an Albert Algebra 
We are now going to show that the automorphisms of an Albert algebra form 
an exceptional simple algebraic group of type F4. Let A be an Albert algebra 
over a field k, and K an algebraic closure of k. We keep the notations of the 
previous section. Then G = Aut(AK) is an algebraic group. 
Theorem 7.2.1 G is a connected simple algebmic group of type F4 which 
is defined over k. 
Proof. (a) We first show that G is a connected algebraic groupof dimension 
52. We do this by considering its action on the variety V of primitive idem-
potents in AK. By Cor. 5.8.2, this action is transitive. We claim that V is an 
irreducible variety of dimension 16. Consider the orthogonal primitive idem-
potents UI = U, U2 = ~(e-u)+xI and U3 = ~(e-u)-xi (cf. the beginning 
of the proof of Th. 5.4.5), and let Vi be the Zariski open subset of V defined 
by 
Vi = {t E V I (t, ud # o}. 
VI consists of the primitive idempotents of type (i) in Prop. 5.5.3, i.e., the 
elements 
1 
t = (Q(y) + l)-I(u + "2Q(y)(e - u) + Y 0 Y + y) 
(y E EI, Q(y) # -1). 
Since the y E EI with Q(y) # -1 form a Zariski open set in EI, VI is an 
irreducible variety of dimension 16. Similarly for V2 and V3. If t E V, t ¢ VI, 
it is of type (ii) as in Prop. 5.5.3: 

7.2 The Automorphism Group of an Albert Algebra 
179 
1 
t='2(e-u)+x+y 
1 
(x E Eo, Q(x) = 4' y EEl, Q(y) = 0). 
Then (t,U2) = ~ + (Xl,X) and (t,U3) = ~ - (Xl,x). At least one of these 
two must be i= 0, so t E V2 or t E V3. Hence V = VI U V2 U V3. Moreover, we 
see that V2 n V3 i= 0, and similarly for VI n V2 and VI n V3. Hence Vi n Vj is an 
open dense subset of Vi, We conclude that VI n V2 n V3 is an irreducible open 
subset of each Vi, Hence its closure contains all Vi, and must be V. Then V, 
being the closure of an irreducible subset, is itself irreducible. As V = VI it 
has dimension 16. 
By Prop. 7.1.6, the stabilizer G u of u in G is isomorphic to Spin(Q; Eo). 
The latter is a connected quasisimple algebraic group of type B4, which has 
dimension 36. It follows that G is connected (cf. [Sp 81, 5.5.9 (1)] and has 
dimension 52. 
(b) Gleaves el. = K (e - 3u) EEl Eo EEl El invariant, since it leaves the quadratic 
form Q invariant (see Prop. 5.3.10); we show that this is an irreducible rep-
resentation. 
The stabilizer G u of u in Gleaves K(e - 3u), Eo and El invariant. In Eo 
it induces the rotation group by Th. 7.1.3, so there it acts irreducibly. G u 
induces in El the spin representation of Spin( Q; Eo), which is irreducible. 
(This irreducibility also follows from Prop. 7.1.1 and Lemma 7.1.4.) So the 
representation of G u in el. is the sum of the three inequivalent irreducible 
representations in K (e - 3u), Eo and E1. 
Every G-invariant subspace of el. contains a Gu-invariant subspace. Since 
G is transitive on the primitive idempotents, it can move u to U2, so e - 3u 
to e - 3U2 = -~(e - 3u) - 3XI and El to E+ + C (where C = xf n Eo, cf. 
§ 5.4). It follows that the representation of Gin el. is irreducible. 
(c) Since G has a faithful irreducible representation, it is reductive (see the 
proof of Th. 2.3.5). A central element of G must induce A. id in el. for some 
A E K*; since its restriction to Eo is a rotation (cf. Th. 7.1.3) we must have 
A = 1. So G haS trivial center and is semisimple. 
(d) Since G has trivial center, G = G 1 x·· ·xGs , each G i being simple and G i 
centralizing G j for i i= j; see [Sp 81, Th. 8.1.5]. Notice that G i n TI#i G j = 
id, since a finite normal subgroup must be central. Let 71'i : G ---+ G i be the 
projection on the i-th component. 
By Th. 7.1.6, Gu is a quasisimple algebraic group of type B4, so dim G u = 
36. We have 71'i(Gu) i= id for some i, say, for i = 1. Since G u is quasisimple, 
the kernel of the restriction of 71'1 to Gu is finite, so dim 71'1 (Gu) = 36. Hence 
dim G 1 2:: 36. Since G has dimension 52, we must have 71'i(Gu) = id for i > 1, 
so G u ~ G 1 . 
G 2 , ... , G s centralize G 1, hence also Gu. If t E G normalizes G u, then 
t ( u) is fixed under the action of Gu; since G u leaves no other idempotents 
fixed than u, it follows that t(u) = u. Hence N(Gu ) = Gu. This implies that 
G i ~ G u ~ G 1 for i > 1, hence s = 1. We conclude that G is a simple group 
of dimension 52. A simple algebraic type of classical type has dimension [2 -1 

180 
7. Exceptional Groups 
or ~l(l - 1) for some integer l. Such a dimension cannot equal 52, hence G 
must be of exceptional type, and can only be of type F4 (see e.g. [Bour, 
Planches)). 
(e) To prove that G is defined over k, we proceed as in the proof of Prop. 2.4.6. 
In the present case it suffices to show that the Lie algebra L(G) coincides 
with the space of derivations D = Der(AK), or that dim D ~ 52. 
Let u be a primitive idempotent of AK and let El be its half space, as 
usual. If dE D we have d(u) = d(u2 ) = 2u.d(u), which shows that d(u) EEl' 
On the other hand, the subspace of D of derivations d with d( u) = 0 has 
dimension 36, by Cor. 7.1.7. SincedimEl = 16, weseethatdimD ~ 16+36 = 
52, as desired.

We state explicitly a result mentioned in the proof. 
Corollary 7.2.2 L(G) = Der(AK)' 
7.3 The Invariance Group of the Determinant in an 
Albert Algebra 
A is as in the previous section. In this section we consider the algebraic group 
H of linear transformations of AK leaving det invariant, and prove that this 
is an exceptional simple algebraic group of type E6 . To a large extent the 
proof goes along the same lines as that of the previous theorem. At the end 
of the proof, however, we need an extra argument, viz., that H has an outer 
automorphism; we first give a proof of that fact . 
. For a bijective linear transformation t of any J-algebra A, define i : A -+ A 
by 
(t(x),i(y)} = (x,y) 
(x,y E A), 
the contragredient of t. It is clear that i = t and that tu = iil for bijective 
linear transformations t and u of A. 
Proposition 7.3.1 Let A be a J-algebra and let H be the group of bijective 
linear transformations t of A leaving the cubic form det invariant. Then 
t E GL(A) lies in H if and only if 
t(x) x t(y) = i(x x y) 
(x,y E A). 
If t lies in H then so does i. The mapping 
- : H -+ H, t ~ i, 
is an outer automorphism of order 2 of H. 

7.3 The Invariance Group of the Determinant in an 
Albert Algebra 
181 
Proof. It suffices to give the proof for algebraically closed k = K. If t leaves 
det invariant, then, 
(t(x x y),t(z)) = (x x y,z) = 3(x,y,z) = 3(t(x),t(y),t(z)) 
= (t(x) x t(y), t(z)) 
(x, y, z E A), 
so i(x x y) = t(x) x t(y). The argument may be reversed, which proves the 
first statement of the proposition. 
If t E H then 
i(x x x) x i(x x x) = (t(x) x t(x)) x (t(x) x t(x)) 
= det(t(x))t(x) = det(x)t(x) 
(x E A) 
by Lemma 5.2.1 (iv). Replacing x by x x x and using (iv) and (vii) of the 
same lemma, we arrive at 
det(x)2i(x) x i(x) = det(x x x)t(x x x) = det(x)2t(x x x) 
(x E A). 
Hence i(x) x i(x) = t(x x x) if det(x) i= OJ by Zariski continuity it holds for 
all x E A. Linearization yields i(x) x i(y) = t(x x y) (x, YEA), which implies 
that i E H. 
So t 1-+ i is an automorphism of H. Suppose it were inner. Then there 
would be u E H such that i = utu- 1 for all t E H. Let e be a primitive third 
root of unity in k, and take t = e. id. Then i = utu- 1 = e. id. But from the 
definition of i we infer that i = e- 1. id. Thus we arrive at a contradiction. 0 
Now we come to the main result of this section. 
Theorem 7.3.2 H is a connected, quasisimple, simply connected algebraic 
group of type E6 which is defined over k. 
Proof. (a) By Cor. 5.4.6 the polynomial function det on AK is irreducible. 
Hence 
w = {x E AK I det(x) = 1} 
is a 26-dimensional irreducible algebraic variety. H acts on it. For a E W, let 
Ba be the bilinear form on AK with Ba(x,y) = (x,y,a) for X,y E AK. This 
form is nondegenerate, for 
(x,y,a) =0 
implies that y x a = 0, hence y = 0 by Lemma 5.9.1. Over the algebraically 
closed field K any two nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms of the same 
dimension are equivalent. So by Prop. 5.9.3, H acts transitively on W. 
(b) The stabilizer He of e in H is the automorphism group G, by Prop. 5.9.4. 
By Th. 7.2.1 this is a connected algebraic group of dimension 52. Together 
with (a) this implies that H is a connected algebraic group of dimension 
52 + 26 = 78. 

182 
7. Exceptional Groups 
(c) He = Aut(AK ), acting in AK , has as irreducible subspaces Ke and e..L, 
as we saw in part (b) of the proof of Th. 7.2.1. H leaves neither of these 
subspaces invariant, so its faithful representation in AK is irreducible. Hence 
H is reductive (see the proof of Th. 2.3.5). A central element of H must be 
of the form .\. id with .\3 = 1, so the center of H has order 3. It follows that 
H is semisimple. 
( d) To prove that H is quasisimple we argue as in the proof of part (d) of 
Th. 7.2.1. There are some complications, however; one is that H has non-
trivial center, so it need not be a direct product of quasisimple groups. Let 
H = H' / D, where H' = HI X ... x Hs, each Hi being quasisimple and Hi 
centralizing H j for i of- j, and where D is a finite central subgroup. Let (! be 
the projection of H' onto H, and 1fi that of H' onto its i-th component Hi. 
Let H~ be the identity component of (!-I(He). Then (!(H~) = He and H~ is 
a simple group of type F4 , so dimH~ = 52. We have 1fi(H~) of- id for some i, 
say, for i = 1. The kernel of the restriction of 1fi to H~ is trivial since H~ is 
simple, so dim 1f1 (H~) = 52. Hence dim HI 2: 52. Since H' has dimension 78, 
we must have 1fi(H~) = id for i > 1, so H~ ~ HI and therefore He ~ (!(HI). 
H 2, ... , Hs centralize HI, so (!(H2)" .. , (!(Hs) centralize He. Now con-
sider the normalizer N(He) of He in H. If t E H normalizes He, then t(e) 
is fixed under the action of He. Since the representation of He in e..L is 
irreducible, the elements of W that are fixed under He lie in ke n W = 
{6e I 6 3 = 1 }. It follows that the identity component of N(He) is He itself, 
so (!(Hi) ~ He ~ (!(Ht} for i > 1. This implies that s = 1, since (! has 
finite kernel. Hence H is a quasisimple group of dimension 78. The argument 
of the proof of Th. 7.2.1 now gives that there are three possible types for 
such a group, viz., B6, C6 and E6 Since H has an outer automorphism by 
Prop. 7.3.1, it can not be of type B6 or C6, so it is of type E6; see [Hu, § 27.4], 
or [Sp 81, Th. 9.6.2]. Since its center has order 3, H must be the simply con-
nected group of that type (see [Sp 81, 8.1.11] and [Bour, Planches]). 
( e) The proof that H is defined over k is similar to part (e) of the proof of 
Th. 7.2.1. The Lie algebra L(H) is contained in the space S of linear maps t 
of AK such that 
(t(x),x,x) = 0 (x E AK), 
as follows for example by an argument using dual numbers. From (5.14) we 
see that for t E S we have (t(e), e) = 0, hence t(e) lies in a hyperplane of 
AK , which has dimension 26. Using Cor. 7.2.2 we conclude that dim S :s:: 78, 
from which one deduces that S coincides with L(H). An application of [Sp 81, 
12.1.2] proves that H is defined over k.

7.4 Historical Notes 
C. Chevalley and R.D. Schafer [CheSch] discovered that the automorphism 
group of an Albert algebra over lR or C is a simple Lie group of type F 4; see 

7.4 Historical Notes 
183 
also [Fr 51 J. The characterization of E6 as the stabilizer of the cubic form det 
goes back to H. Freudenthal [Fr 51J for the real case; Chevalley and Schafer 
gave a different description of E6. Notice that Chevalley and Schafer as well 
as Freudenthal all worked with Lie algebras, so with derivations rather than 
automorphisms, and with linear transformations t such that (t(x),x,x) = 0 
for all x. 
It was again L.E. Dickson who in 1901 considered the analog of the com-
plex Lie group E6 over an arbitrary field, as a linear group in 27 variables that 
leaves a certain cubic form invariant; see [Di OlbJ and [Di 08J. N. Jacobson, 
inspired by Dickson and by Chevalley's Tohoku paper [Che 55J, studied the 
automorphism group of an Albert algebra and the stabilizer of the cubic form 
det over arbitrary fields of characteristic not two or three in a series of papers 
[Ja 59], [Ja 60], [Ja 61J. He proved, for instance, that these groups are simple 
(quasisimple, respectively) if the Albert algebra contains nilpotent elements 
(or is reduced, respectively). 
The result in Th. 7.1.3 that the automorphisms of an Albert algebra over 
an algebraically closed field that leave a primitive idempotent invariant form 
a group isomorphic to Spin(9) is found in [Ja 60J. 

8. Cohomological Invariants 
In this final chapter we discuss a number of more recent developments 
in the theory of octonion and Albert algebras. Specifically, we deal with 
some cohomological invariants. At the end we make the connection with the 
Freudenthal-Tits construction (or first Tits construction) of Albert division 
algebras. The presentation will be more sketchy than in the preceding chap-
ters. The invariants we will discuss are elements of certain Galois cohomology 
groups. In the first section we therefore give a rudimentary exposition of some 
notions from Galois cohomology, mainly referring to the literature for defini-
tions and proofs. 
8.1 Galois Cohomology 
Let k be a field and ks a separable closure. Denote the (topological) Galois 
group Gal( ks / k) by r. Let A be a finite abelian group on which r acts 
continuously, i.e., via a finite quotient by an open subgroup. We then have 
the cohomology groups Hi(r, A), also written as Hi(k, A). See [Se 64, Ch. I, 
§ 2 and Ch. II, § 1]. The group operation in Hi(k, A) is usually written 
as addition. For generalities about homological algebra and, in particular, 
cohomology of groups, see also [Ja 80, Ch. 6]. 
Assume B is another finite abelian group with continuous r -action. There 
are cup product maps 
Here A ® B is the tensor product of A and B considered as Z-modules, and 
the r-action on it is defined by ')'(a ® b) = ')'(a) ® ')'(b). For an i-cocycle i, 
and a j-cocycle g, the cup product of their cohomology classes [i] E Hi(k, A) 
and [g] E Hj(k, A) is [i] U [g] = [h] with the (i + j)-cocycle h defined by 
(8.1) 
(see [CaEi, Ch. 11, § 7] or [Br, Ch. 5, § 3]; in the latter the definition is 
slightly different, with a factor (_l)ij inserted). We have

8. Cohomological Invariants 
(8.2) 
Let n be an integer prime to char(k). We denote by J.Ln the group of n-
th roots of unity in ks with the natural r-action. Br(k) denotes the Brauer 
group of kj it may be identified with H2(r, k;) (see [Ja 80, § 4.7 and § 8.4]). 
If A is a central simple algebra of dimension n2 over its center k, then its 
class [AJ has order dividing n in Br(k). We denote the subgroup of Br(k) 
of elements whose order divides n by nBr(k). The following facts are well 
known. 
Proposition 8.1.1 Let n be prime to char(k). 
(i) Hl(k, J.Ln) ~ k* j(k*)n. 
(ii) H2(k, J.Ln) ~ nBr(k). 
Proof. We have an exact sequence 
the third arrow being the n-th power map. This gives rise to a long exact 
sequence 
I-t HO(r,J.Ln) -t HO(r,k;) ~ HO(r,k;) -t H 1(r,J.Ln) -t Hl(r,k;) ~ 
~ Hl(r, k;) -t H2(r, J.Ln) -t H2(r, k;) ~ H2(r, k;). 
If A is a r-module, HO(r, A) is the subgroup of r-invariant elements in A, 
so HO(r, k;) = k*. By Hilbert's Theorem 90, Hl(r, k;) = 1. Hence we find 
an exact sequence 
k* ~ k* -t Hl(r, J.Ln) -t 1, 
which implies (i). Since H2(r, k;) ~ Br(k), the last four terms of the long 
exact sequence yield the exact sequence 
This implies (ii). 
o 
The isomorphism of (i) can be made explicit. For a E k*, let ~ E k; be 
an n-th root of a. The map 
(8.3) 
is a l-cocycle of r with values in J.Ln whose cohomology class [aJ depends only 
on the coset a(k*)n. The map a(k*)n f-4 [aJ is an isomorphism k* j(k*)n ~ 
Hl(k, J.Ln). We will consider this as an identification, so [aJ stands for the 
I-cohomology class as well as for the class of a mod (k*)n in k*j(k*)n. As 
before, we assume that n is prime to char(k). Let ZjnZ be the cyclic group 
of order n with trivial r-action. If J.Ln C k, the r-action on it is trivial, so 

8.1 Galois Cohomology 
187 
then I-tn ~ Z/nZ as a r-module. In that situation, choose a primitive n-th 
root of unity ( E k. Then we have an isomorphism 
We identify Z/nZ 0 Z/nZ with Z/nZ via the isomorphism 
(i + nZ) 0 (j + nZ) 1-+ ij + nZ. 
Via the isomorphism of (8.4) this yields an isomorphism 
¢( : I-tn 0 I-tn ---+ I-tn· 
(8.4) 
(8.5) 
(8.6) 
As the notation indicates, this isomorphism depends on (: if w is another 
primitive n-th root of unity and ( = wa , then 
as is readily checked. We also obtain an isomorphism 
¢'c. : I-tn 0 I-tn ---+ Z/nZ. 
(8.7) 
If w is as above, we have ¢~(A) = a2¢'c.(A). 
We continue to assume that I-tn C k with n prime to char( k). Let a, f3 E k*, 
and let ( E k* be a primitive n-th root of unity. Define the cyclic algebra 
A«(a,.8) to be the associative algebra over k generated by elements x and y 
subject to the relations 
xn = a, 
yn =.8, 
xyx- 1 = (y. 
This is a central simple algebra over k of dimension n2 . If a or f3 is an n-th 
power in k, then A«(o:, (3) is isomorphic to the matrix algebra Mn(k) (see 
[Mi, § 15, pp. 143-144]). Cyclic crossed products (see [AI 61, Ch. V], [ArNT, 
Ch. VIII, §§ 4 and 5] or [Ja 80, §§ 8.4 and 8.5]) of dimension n 2 over k can be 
viewed as cyclic algebras. For let l be a cyclic field extension of k of degree n, 
and let a be a generator of the Galois group Gal(l/k). We can write l = k(17) 
with 17n = .8 E k*. Then a(17) = (y for some primitive n-th root of unity 
( E k. For a E k*, the cyclic crossed product (l, a, a) is the vector space over 
l with basis 1, u, u2, ... ,un- 1 such that un = a and ue = a(e)u fore E l. 
Taking x = u and y = 17 as generators, one sees that (l,a,a) = A«(a,f3). 
The result in the following lemma is well-known, see e.g. [KMRT, p. 415]. 
For the convenience of the reader we sketch a proof. We first explain a nota-
tion. For a, f3 E k* we have their cohomology classes [a] and [.8] in Hl(k, I-tn) 
as defined by (8.3). The cup product [a] U f3]lies in H2(k,l-tn 0l-tn). The 
isomorphism ¢( of (8.6) induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups 
¢( : H2(k, I-tn 0l-tn) ---+ H2(k, Iln), 
sending [J] to [¢( 0 fl· 

188 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
Lemma 8.1.2 Assume that n is prime to char(k) and that J.Ln C k. Let 
a, {3 E k*, and let ( E k* be a primitive n-th root of unity. Then the class of 
A,(a,{3) in Br(k) lies in nBr(k) and equals 4>,([a] U [{3]). 
Proof. A, (1, 1) ~ Mn (k) is generated by elements X and Y with relations 
xn = yn = 1 and XY X- 1 = (Y. Now A,(a, {3) is a k-form of A,(I, 1), that 
is, the ks-algebras ks ®k A,(a, {3) and ks ®k Ad1, 1) are isomorphic. We give 
an explicit isomorphism of the former algebra onto the latter. Let ~,TJ E ks 
be n-th roots of a and {3, respectively. Then 
defines such an isomorphism. 
The Galois group r acts on ks ®k A,(a,{3) and on ks ®k A,(I, 1) via the 
first factor. For 0' E r, 
Cu = 't/J 0 0' 0 't/J-1 00'-1 = 't/J 0 u't/J-1 
is an automorphism of ks ®k Ad1, 1) ~ Mn(ks ). It defines a noncommutative 
l-cocycle of r in the automorphism group of kS®kAd1, 1) (see [Se 64, Ch. I, 
§ 5]); this automorphism group is isomorphic to PGLn(ks) by the Skolem-
Noether Theorem. 
Define functions a and bon r with values in {O, 1, ... , n - I} by 
Notice that a(O') + a(T) - a(O'T) = 0 or n for (7, T E r and similarly for b. A 
direct check shows that Cu is the inner automorphism Inn(gu), where 
gu = X-b(u)ya(u) 
Put 
CU,T = gu 0' (gT )g;; 
We compute this explicitly: 
((7 E r). 
(0', T E r). 
CU,T = X-b(u)ya(u) X-b(T)ya(T)y-a(uT) Xb(UT) 
= (a(u)b(T) X-b(u)-b(T)y+a(u)+a(T)-a(uT) Xb(UT). 
Since a( 0') + a( T) - a( aT) = 0 or n and similarly for b, and since further 
xn = yn = 1, we have y+a(u)+a(T)-a(uT) = 1 and X-b(u)-b(T)+b(UT) = 1, 
whence 
C 
-
/"a(u)b(T) 
t:T,T -
~ 
(O',TEr). 
This function C is a 2-cocycle of r with values in J.Ln, and it is well known 
that its cohomology class in H2(k, J.Ln) = nBr(k) is the class of A,(a, {3) (see 
[Sp 81, § 12.3.5 (1)] and [Se 64, Ch. I,§§ 5.6 and 5.7]). 
On the other hand, by (8.3) [a] = [f] with 

8.2 An Invariant of Composition Algebras 
189 
(0' E r), 
and similarly for [.8] = [g]. By (8.1) the cup product is [a] U [.8] = [h] with 
(0', r E r). 
Then ¢,([a] U [.8]) = [¢, 0 h], and 
(¢, 0 h) (0', r) = (a(tT)b('T). 
This proves the Lemma. 
o 
Recall that ¢, as defined by (8.6) depends on the choice of (, hence so 
does ¢,. If w = (a is another primitive n-th root of unity, then the class of 
Ada,.8) in the Brauer group equals a¢:([a] U [.8]). 
Only for n = 2 is the isomorphism ¢, canonical, viz., ¢-l. In that case 
A_l (0,.8) is a quaternion algebra, whose class in 2Br(k) is ¢~l ([a] U [.8]); we 
simply write [a] U [.8] for this class in the sequel. 
For n = 3 we have a canonical isomorphism ¢( : JL3 ® JL3 -t Zj3Z as 
in (8.7), since there is only one other root of unity besides (, viz., (2, and 
¢(2 = 22¢, = ¢,. Hence the class ¢(*([a] U [.8]) in H2(k, Zj3Z) is uniquely 
determined. By abuse of notation, we write [a] U [.8] for this class and call it 
"the cup product of [a] and [.8] in H2(k, Zj3Z)". 
8.2 An Invariant of Composition Algebras 
The first cohomological invariant we deal with is an invariant of composition 
algebras. 
We will use a theorem of Merkuryev-Suslin [MeSu]. Let D be a division 
algebra with center k, of degree n over k. Assume n to be prime to char(k). 
Then the class [D] in the Brauer group of k is an element of H2(k, JLn). For 
a E k* denote by [a] its class in k* j(k*)n = Hl(k,JLn)' The cup product 
[oj U [DJlies in H3(k, JLn ® JLn). 
Theorem 8.2.1 (Merkuryev-Suslin) Assume that n is prime to char(k) 
and not divisible by a square. Let a E k*, and let D be a division algebra with 
center k, of degree n over k. Then [oj U [D] = 0 if and only if a is the reduced 
norm of an element of D. 
For a proof, see [MeSu, 12.2]. The difficult part of the theorem is the "only 
if" part. We will need the theorem for n = 2,3. In these cases we have 
JLn ® JLn ~ ZjnZ (see the end of the previous section). 
Assume that char(k) ::I 2. Let C be a composition algebra of dimen-
sion 4 or 8. In C we choose an orthogonal basis of the form e, a, b, ab or 
e, a, b, ab, c, ae, be, (ab)e as in Cor. 1.6.3. Recall that in the octonion case we 

190 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
call such elements a, b, c a basic triple. If 0 is a quaternion algebra, it de-
termines an element of order 1 or 2 in the Brauer group, so an element 
[0] E H2(k, Zj2Z). Taking as generators a and b as above, we see that 0 
is the cyclic algebra A_1( -N(a), -N(b)), so [0] equals the cup product 
[-N(a)] U [-N(b)] (see Lemma 8.1.2 and the remark following it). Hence 
that cup product is independent of the choice of the elements a and b that 
provide the orthogonal basis. Conversely, this cup product determines the 
class [0] in the Brauer group; since 0 is the only 4-dimensional algebra in its 
class, it is determined up to isomorphism by [-N(a)] U [-N(b)]. 0 is split if 
and only if [C] = 0, that is, if [-N(a)] U [-N(b)] = O. 
We now exhibit a similar invariant in the case that 0 is an octonion 
algebra. 
Theorem 8.2.2 Let 0 be an octonion algebra over k, with char(k) 1= 2, and 
let a, b, c be a basic triple in o. 
(i) The cup product (a,b,c) = [-N(a)] U [-N(b)] U [-N(c)] E H3(k,Zj2Z) 
does not depend on the choice of the basic triple a, b, c. 
(ii) (a, b, c) = 0 if and only if 0 is split. 
Proof. Let D be the subalgebra of 0 with basis e, a, b, abo It is a quaternion 
algebra over k and [D] = [-N(a)] U [-N(b)]. This is 0 if and only if D is 
split, in which case 0 is also split. 
Assume that D is a division algebra. The element c is anisotropic and 
orthogonal to D. It follows from Prop. 1.5.1 that the class of N(c) modulo 
the group ND(D*) of reduced norms of nonzero elements of D is uniquely de-
termined. (Recall that the reduced norm of D coincides with the composition 
algebra norm N.) By the "if" part of Th. 8.2.1, (a,b,c) = (a,b,c') if the 
anisotropic elements c and d are both orthogonal to D. It also follows from 
Th. 8.2.1 that (a, b, c) = 0 if and only if -N(c) E ND(D*). Using Prop. 1.5.1 
we see that this is so if and only if 0 is split. Now (ii) follows. If 0 is split 
(i) also follows. 
Assume that C is a division algebra. Let a', b', d be another basic triple; 
we have to prove that (a', b', d) = (a, b, c). Denote by D' the quaternion 
subalgebra generated by a' and b'. The 4-dimensional subspaces Dl. and 
D'l. of el. have an intersection of dimension ~ 1. Taking d 1= 0 in that 
intersection, we have 
( a, b, c) = (a, b, d) = (d, a, b ). 
(Notice that the cup products are symmetric since the coefficient group is 
Zj2Z.) We have, similarly, 
( a' b' c') = (d a' b') 
, , 
, , 
. 
Hence, in order to prove (i) we may assume that a = a'. Then a similar 
argument yields that we may assume that c = d, or by symmetry of the cup 
products, b = b'. But then we are in the case already dealt with.

8.3 An Invariant of Twisted Octonion Algebras 
191 
We write now (a, b, c) = f (C). This is an invariant of the octonion al-
gebra C, lying in H3(k,Zj2Z). In fact, f(C) completely characterizes the 
k-isomorphism class of C, see [Se 94, Th. 9]. 
In characteristic 2 there also exists a co homological invariant that char-
acterizes octonion algebras up to k-isomorphism; see [Se 94, § 10.3]. 
8.3 An Invariant of Twisted Octonion Algebras 
In this section we introduce an invariant of twisted octonion algebras, which 
will be used in the next section to obtain an invariant of Albert algebras. 
We first define it in a special case and will afterwards handle the general 
situation. 
From now on, all fields are assumed to have characteristic not 2 or 3. 
Let l be a cubic cyclic field extension of k and F a normal twisted octonion 
algebra over l. We assume that k contains the third roots of unity. There is 
0: E k such that l = k(~) with e = 0:. Fix a generator a of Gal(ljk) and a 
primitive third root of unity ( E k such that a(~) = (~. We further assume 
that F is isotropic and we choose a E F with N(a) = 0 and T(a) = .x f. O. 
Decompose F with respect to a: 
(see §§ 4.5 and 4.9). Let D be the k-algebra generated by l and the trans-
formation t with t3 = -.x that we introduced in the first paragraph of § 4.7. 
D is isomorphic to the cyclic crossed product (l,a, -.x) (see Lemma 4.7.1), 
so to the cyclic algebra A((-.x,o:). The class of Din 3Br(k) = H2(k,Zj3Z) 
is [D] = [-.x] U [0:] (see Lemma 8.1.2 and the remark at the end of § 8.1). 
In H1(k, Z/3Z) = k* /(k*)3 we have [-.x] = [.x] = [T(a)], so by (8.2) we find 
[D] = -[0:] U [T(a)]. 
Choose v E El (a) with T( v) f. 0; the existence of such a v follows from 
Lemma 4.7.2. Consider the cup product 
g(a, v) = [0:] U [T(a)] U [T(v)] = -[D] U [T(v)] E H3(k, Zj3Z Ii) Z/3Z). 
Identifying Z/3Z Ii) Z/3Z with Z/3Z by the isomorphism of (8.5), we get 
g(a,v) in H3(k,Z/3Z). If we replace v by another element w E El(a) with 
T(w) f=- 0, T(v) gets replaced by T(v)v, where v is a nonzero reduced norm 
of an element of D, according to Lemma 4.7.6. This does not change the cup 
product [D] U [T(v)] by the "if" part of Th. 8.2.1. Hence g(a, v) depends only 
on a, and we may write g(a) instead. 
In a similar way one sees that the cup product [0:] U [T(a)] U [T(v')] with 
v' E E2(a), T(v') f. 0, is independent of the particular choice of v'. 
Lemma 8.3.1 There exists v' E E2(a) with (v, v') = T(v) and T(v' ) = 
T(V)2. 

192 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
Proof. By Th. 4.6.2 we may assume that F = F(V, t), with V = E1(a), V' = 
E2(a). We have the O'-linear map t of V with t(x) = x * a (x E V). Take 
v' = t(v) A t-1(v). By (4.76), 
T(v) = (v, t(v) A C1(v)) = (v, v'). 
Further, using (4.64) we see that 
t'(v') = t-1(v) A v, t,-l(V') = v A t(v). 
Using (4.70) we conclude that 
t'(v') A t,-l(V') = T(v)v, 
whence by (4.76) 
T(v') = (t'(v') A t,-l(v'), v') = T(v)( v, v') = T(v)2. 
In HI(k, 7../37..) ~ k* /(k*)3 we find 
[T(v')] = [T(v)2] = [T(V)-l] = -[T(v)]. 
Thus we have also: 
g(a) = -[a] U [T(a)] U [T(v')] = [D] U [T(v')] 
for v' E E2(a), T(v') ::/: o. 
o 
Now we are going to prove that g(a) is independent of the particular 
choice of a, and that it is zero if and only if F is reduced. 
Proposition 8.3.2 Assume that k contains third roots of unity, that I is a 
cubic cyclic extension of k and F an isotropic twisted octonion algebra over 
I. If a, bE F are isotropic with T(a)T(b) ::/: 0, then g(a) = g(b). F is reduced 
if and only if g(a) = O. 
Proof. If F is reduced, then there exist a nonzero v E EI(a) and u ED such 
that T(v) = ND(U) by Th. 4.8.1. If T(v) ::/: 0, then 
g(a) = -[D] U [T(v)] = -[D] U [ND(u)] = 0 
by Th. 8.2.1. Assume now that T(v) = O. Pick Vo E Eo with T(vo) ::/: O. By 
Lemma 4.7.6, T(v) = T(vo)ND(w) for some nonzero wED. Then ND(w) = 
0, so D is not a division algebra. Hence D ~ M3(k), so [D] = 0 and therefore 
g(a) = O. If, conversely, g(a) = 0, then T(v) E ND(D) by Th. 8.2.1. This 
implies by Th. 4.8.1 that F is reduced. 
Now assume that F is not reduced. Then D is a division algebra by 
Cor. 4.8.2, hence T(v) ::/: 0 for all nonzero v E E2(a) by Lemma 4.7.6. First 

8.3 An Invariant of Twisted Octonion Algebras 
193 
assume that a * b = O. By Lemma 4.9.2, E2(a) n El(b) 1= O. Pick a nonzero 
v E E2(a)nEl(b); then v is isotropic and T(v) 1= O. According to Lemma 4.9.1, 
a E El(V) and b E E2(v). Then 
g(a) = -[a] U [T(a)] U [T(v)] 
= [a] U [T(v)] U [T(a)] 
(by (8.2)) 
= g(v) 
(since a E El(V)). 
Similarly, g(b) = g(v). Hence g(a) = g(b). Finally, let a * b = d 1= O. By 
condition (ii) of Def. 4.1.1, d is isotropic, and by (4.4) and (4.6) we have 
b*d = d*a = O. According to what we already proved, g(b) = g(d) = g(a). 0 
From the Proposition we see that g(a) is, in fact, an invariant of F. We 
denote it by g(F) or g(F, k). To define g(F, k) we assumed that k contains 
the third roots of unity and that F is isotropic. We now want to get rid of 
these restrictions and we also want to include nonnormal twisted octonion 
algebras. 
We first recall some results from Galois cohomology which we shall use. 
Let k, ks and A be as in the beginning of § 8.1. If m is a finite separable 
extension of k, the Galois group Gal(ks/m) is a subgroup of r = Gal(ks/k). 
The cohomology groups Hi(m, A) are defined and we have a restriction ho-
momorphism 
Resm/k : Hi(k, A) ---+ Hi(m, A) 
which is induced by the restriction of co cycles of Gal(ks/k) with values in A 
to the subgroup Gal(ks/m). If m/k is a Galois extension, the Galois group 
Gal(m/k) acts on Hi(m,A) (see [Se 64, Ch. I, p. 12-13]) and the image of 
Resm/k is fixed elementwise by Gal(m/k) ([loc.cit., p. 11]). If, moreover, the 
order of A is prime to the degree [m : kJ, then ReS7n/k defines an isomorphism 
of Hi(k, A) onto the subgroup of Gal(m/k)-invariant elements of Hi(m, A) 
(as follows from [CaEi, Cor. 9.2, p. 257]). 
m being arbitrary, let m' be a finite separable extension of m. Then 
Res7n, /k = Res7n, /7n 0 Res7n/k . 
Finally, Resm/k is compatible with cup products. 
Let now k be any field with char(k) 1= 2,3, and let F be a twisted octo-
nion algebra over a cubic field extension l of k. We shall define an invariant 
g(F) = g(F, k) of F, lying in H3(k, J.L3 ® J.L3) = H3(k, 7-/37-) (for this identi-
fication see the end of § 8.1). We proceed in several steps. 
(a) F is an isotropic normal octonion algebra over l and a. 
We use the notations of the beginning of this section, but we do not as-
sume that k contains the third roots of unity. D is defined as before. The 
class [D] now lies in H2(k,J.L3)' Choose again v E El(a) with T(v) 1= O. 
We have [T(v)] E Hl(k,J.L3)' Define g(F,k) to be the element -[D] U [T(v)] 

194 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
of H3(k,JL3 ® JL3) = H3(k,Z/3Z). We have to show that this is indepen-
dent of choices. Let k' = k(JL3) and put l' = k' ®k l, F' = l' ®l F. Then 
F' carries an obvious structure of normal twisted octonion algebra over l' 
and a. We have the invariant g(F', k') dealt with above, and it is clear that 
Resk' /k(g(F, k)) = g(F', k'). To prove that g(F, k) is independent of choices, 
we use the injective homomorphism Resk, / k to pass to k', over which field we 
have already proved independence (in Prop. 8.3.2). 
(b) Let F be as in (a) and let FjJ. be an isotope of F (see § 4.1). We claim 
that g(FjJ.' k) = g(F, k). 
FjJ. and F have the same underlying vector space and proportional quadratic 
forms. The cubic form of FjJ. is NI/k(JL)T, where T is the cubic form of F. An 
isotropic vector a for F can also serve for Fw The cyclic crossed product which 
it defines for FjJ. is (l, a, -NI/k(JL)oX), which is isomorphic to D = (l, a, -oX) 
(the notations being as before). Since the space E1 ( a) is the same for F and 
FjJ.' we conclude that 
g(FjJ., k) = -[D] U [NI/k(JL)T(v)]. 
As NI/k(JL) is a reduced norm of an element of D we conclude that g(FjJ.' k) = 
g(F, k), establishing our claim. 
(c) F is an arbitrary normal octonion algebra over l and a. 
We may assume that F is anisotropic. Replacing F by an isotope we may 
assume that we are in the situation of Case (A) in § 4.11. We then have the 
quadratic extension k1 of k and the cyclic extension h = k1 ®k l of k1' whose 
Galois group is is generated by a. Moreover, we have the isotropic normal 
twisted composition algebra F1 over II and a. Then g(Fl. k1) is defined. 
Denote again by 1'1 the nontrivial automorphism of kdk. It acts on hand 
commutes with a. We have a 1'l-linear automorphism v of Fl. This can be 
viewed as an isomorphism of F1 onto the twisted algebra Ti (FI) (i.e., F1 with 
the scalar action of h twisted by 1'd. It follows that g(Ti (F1), kd = g(Fl. kd. 
But g(Ti (FI), kI) = 1'l.g(Fl. kI). Hence g(Fl. k1) is fixed by Gal(kdk) and 
there exists a unique g(F, k) E H3(k, Z/3Z) with 
g(Fl. kd = Reskdk(g(F, k)). 
As in step (a), g(F, k) is independent of choices. Also, if F' is an isotope of 
F we have g(F',k) = g(F,k) (by step (b)), 
(d) Let F be a normal twisted octonion algebra over l and a. The opposite 
FO of F is a normal twisted composition algebra over land a2 . It has the 
same underlying vector space and quadratic form as F, but its product x *0 y 
is the reversed product y * x (x, y E F). The cubic form of FO is the same as 
the form T of F. We claim that g(FO, k) = g(F, k). 
To show this we may perform quadratic extensions, to reduce to the situation 
that F is isotropic over k and JL3 C k. Then choose a as before, with T(a) = 
oX =I- O. The cyclic crossed product defined by a for FO is (l, a2 , -oX), which is 
isomorphic to the opposite D' of D = (l, a, -oX). Then 

8.4 An Invariant of Albert Algebras 
195 
g(FO, k) = -[D'] U [T(v')] = [D] U [T(v')], 
when~ v' lies in the space like El (a) relative to FO and T( v') # O. But from 
§ 4.9 we see that this space coincides with the space E2(a) relative to F. 
Using Lemma 8.3.1, we conclude that g(FO,k) = g(F,k), as claimed. 
(e) F is arbitrary. 
We may assume that F is nonnormal. Let k', l' and F' be as in Prop. 4.2.4. 
Then F' is a normal twisted octonion algebra over l' and a. So g(F', k') is 
defined. T being the nontrivial automorphism of k' /k, we have the T-linear 
antiautomorphism u of F' of F'. This can be viewed as an isomorphism of 
the twisted algebra T (F') onto (F')o. Proceeding as in step (c) we see that 
T.g(F', k') = g((F')O, k'). By step (d) this equals g(F', k'). It follows that 
there exists a unique g(F, k) E H3(k, Z/3Z) with g(F', k') = Resk1Ik(g(F, k)). 
We have now defined g(F, k) for any twisted octonion algebra F. It follows 
from our constructions that this invariant can be defined in the following 
manner. Let mjk be a tower of quadratic extensions such that m contains 
third roots of unity and that Fm = m®k F is an isotropic normal twisted oc-
tonion algebra. Let g(Fm, m) be as in Prop. 8.3.2. Then g(F, k) is the unique 
element of H3(k, Z/3Z) such that 
Resmlk(g(F, k)) = g(Fm' m). 
If m' /m is a finite tower of quadratic extensions, then it follows from the 
definitions that 
Resml/m(g(Fm,m)) = g(Fml,m'). 
From this one concludes that g(F, k) does not depend on the particular choice 
of m. By Th. 5.5.2 and Lemma 4.2.11, Fm is reduced if and only if F is so. 
Hence F is reduced if and only g(F, k) = O. 
Thus, g(F) is an invariant which detects whether F is reduced or not. The 
answer to the following question is not known: assuming that F is isotropic, 
is its isomorphism class uniquely determined by g(F)? This is related to a 
similar question for Albert algebras; see the end of the next section. 
8.4 An Invariant of Albert Algebras 
Let A be an Albert algebra over a field k, char(k) # 2,3. We will attach to 
it an invariant g(A) E H3(k, Z/3Z). Consider a E A, a ~ ke. If k[a] is not a 
cubic field extension of k, then we set ga(A) = 0; by Prop. 6.1.1, A is reduced 
in this case. Assume now that k[a] = l is a cubic field extension of k. As in 
§ 6.2, we take F = l~ and make this a twisted octonion algebra over l. We 
define 
ga(A) = g(F). 

196 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
It is obvious that this depends only on the field l and not on the particular 
choice of a in l. It is our purpose to show that it is even independent of l, in 
other words, that ga(A) is an invariant of A. 
By Prop. 8.3.2, g(F) = 0 if and only if F is reduced; by Th. 6.3.2, this is 
the case if and only if A is reduced. So, in particular, if F is reduced, g(F) 
does not depend on l. 
Assume now that A is a division algebra, so F is not reduced. We recall 
from Th. 5.5.2 that A is a division algebra if and only if the cubic form det 
does not represent 0 nontrivially over k, and according to Lemma 4.2.11 the 
property of a cubic form of not representing 0 nontrivially is not affected by 
quadratic extensions of the base field. We have seen in the previous section 
that g(F) is not affected either by quadratic extensions of k, so we may 
assume that j.t3 C k. Then a may be chosen in l such that a3 = a E k. By 
the Hamilton-Cayley equation (5.7) this is equivalent to Q( a) = (a, e) = 0 
and det(a) = a. Moreover, l is a cyclic extension of k. As in § 8.3, we fix a 
third root of unity ( E k, and denote by a the unique generator of Gal(ljk) 
with a(a) = (a. Since ljk is cyclic, we may consider F as a normal twisted 
octonion algebra over l with a product which is a-linear in the first factor and 
a 2-linear in the second one. After another quadratic extension, if necessary, 
we may assume that the norm N of F is isotropic. Recall that the cubic form 
T associated with F does not represent zero nontrivially if F is not reduced 
(see Th. 4.1.10). 
We saw in the previous section that ga(A) = g(F) = [a] U [T(b)] U [T(c)], 
where b E F, b::j:. 0 (and hence T(b) ::j:. 0), Q(b) = 0, and c E E1(b), c::j:. o. 
This can also be written as 
ga(A) = [det(a)] U [det(b)] U [det(c)], 
since T(x) = det(x) for x E F by (6.20). Recall from the previous section 
that we may replace c E E1(b) by a nonzero d E E2(b), provided we put a 
minus sign in front of the cup product: 
ga(A) = -[det(a)] U [det(b)] U [det(c')]. 
The restriction to F of Q is related to N by 
Q(x) = TrI/k(N(x)) 
(x E F) 
(see (6.7) or (6.17)). It follows that for an l-subspace of F the orthogonal 
complement with respect to ( , ) (the k-bilinear form associated with Q) 
coincides with the orthogonal complement with respect to N( , ) (the l-
bilinear form associated with N). From (6.22) we get that x *2 = x2 if x E F, 
N(x) = o. The action of l on F is given by (6.3) and (6.2); recall that this 
action is denoted with a dot to distinguish it from the J-algebra product in 
A, so we write d.x for dEL and x E F. In particular, we have 
e.x = x, 
a.x = -2ax 
(x E F), 
(8.8) 
since (a, e) = o. All this together leads to the following conclusion. 

8.4 An Invariant of Albert Algebras 
197 
Lemma 8.4.1 E(b), the orthogonal complement ojlbEBlb*b in F with respect 
to N( , ), is the orthogonal complement in A with respect to ( , ) of 
Eo(b) = ke EB ka EB ka2 EB kb EB kab EB ka2b EB kb2 EB kab2 EB ka2b2. 
Next we characterize El(b) and E2(b) within E(b) in terms of the product 
in A. 
Lemma 8.4.2 For i = 1,2 we have 
Ei(b) = {w E E(b) I (ab)w = (ib(aw) = (2ia(bw)}. 
Proof. From (6.22) we know: 
v * w + w * v = 2vw 
(v,w E F, N(v,w) = 0). 
(8.9) 
Replacing v by a.v we get 
(a.v) * w + w * (a.v) = 2(a.v)w 
(v,w E F, N(v,w) = 0), 
which can be written as 
(a.(v * w) + (2a.(w * v) = 2(a.v)w 
(v,w E F, N(v,w) = 0). 
(8.10) 
Similarly, 
(2a.(v * w) + (a.(w * v) = 2v(a.w) 
(v,w E F, N(v,w) = 0). 
(8.11) 
By (4.55) and (4.56), El(b) = {w E Eo(b)l.l b*w = o}. Let wE El(b). From 
(8.9) we see that w * b = 2bw. From (8.10) and (8.11) with v replaced by b 
we obtain, using (8.8), 
-4(2a(bw) = -4(ab)w, 
-4(a(bw) = -4b(aw), 
whence (ab)w = (b(aw) = (2a(bw). 
Conversely, let wE Eo(b)l. satisfy (ab)w = (b(aw). From (8.11) and (8.8) 
we obtain 
(2a.(b * w) + (a.(w * b) = -4b(aw) = -4(2(ab)w. 
On the other hand, we have by (8.10), 
(a.(b * w) + (2a.(w * b) = -4(ab)w. 
Dividing this by ( and then subtracting it from the previous equation,we get 
((2 _ l)a.(b * w) = O. Hence b * w = 0, so w E El(b). 
This proves the Lemma for El (b). The case of E2 (b) is similar. 
0 

198 
8. Cohomological Invariants 
As we see from the proof, the condition (ab)w = (ib(aw) already suffices 
to characterize Ei(b), but for the application that follows it is convenient to 
have a condition in which a and b appear symmetrically. 
We now interchange the roles of a and b. Let l' = k[b), F' = k[b).L. We take 
the generator u' of Gal(l' /k) such that u'(b) = (2b, so we also interchange 
the roles of ( and (2. We have the subspaces E'(a), EHa) and E~(a) in F', 
and also Eb(a). 
Lemma 8.4.3 El(b) = E~(a). 
Proof. Since a and b playa symmetric role in the set of generators of Eo(b) 
(see Lemma 8.4.1), Eb(a) = Eo(b) and hence E'(a) = E(b). Now the result 
follows from Lemma 8.4.2. 
0 
After these preparations we can prove that ga(A) is independent of the 
choice of a. Replacing k by a tower of quadratic extensions (which we are 
allowed to do) we may assume that 
a E A, a ¢ ke, Q(a) = (a,e) = OJ bE k[a].L,b::l O,Q(b) = OJ 
cl. e,a,a2,b,ab,a2b,b2,ab2,a2b2,c::l 0, (ab)c = (b(ac). 
The independence of ga(A) follows from the following theorem. 
Theorem 8.4.4 Let A be an Albert division algebm over k and let a, b, c be 
as above. Then 
g(A) = [det(a)) U [det(b)) U [det(c)) 
is a nonzero element of H3(k, 7./37.) that is independent of the particular 
choice of the elements a, band c. 
Proof. Let a' E A satisfy the same conditions as a. We have to prove that 
ga(A) = ga' (A). After performing quadratic extensions we may assume that 
k contains the third roots of unity and that k[a) and k[a') are cyclic over k. 
Choose an isotropic element b::l 0 in A orthogonal to e, a, a2, a', (a')2 (which 
may require another quadratic extension of k). 
Pick a nonzero c E E~ (a). Then 
9b(A) = -[det(b)] U [det(a)) U [det(c)) 
= [det(a)) U [det(b)) U [det(c)) 
(by (8.2)) 
= ga(A) 
(by Lemma 8.4.3). 
Similarly, gb(A) = 9al (A). Hence ga(A) = ga' (A). 
0 
With the aid of [PeRa 96, § 4.2) and the results of the next section one 
can identify g(A) with plus or minus the Serre-Rost invariant. (Due to choices 
that have to be made, there is a sign ambiguity in the definition of the latter 
invariant, anyway.) J.-P. Serre has raised the question whether g(A) together 
with two invariants of A in H*(k, 7./27.) characterizes A up to isomorphism 
(see [Se 94, § 9.4) or [PeRa 94, p. 205, Q. 1)). 

8.5 The Freudenthal-Tits Construction 
199 
8.5 The Freudenthal-Tits Construction 
In this section we briefly indicate how the decomposition of an Albert division 
algebra A into subspaces Eo(b), El (b) and E2(b) is related to the Freudenthal-
Tits construction (or first Tits construction) of A (see [Ja 68, Ch. IX,§ 12], 
[PeRa 94, p. 200], [PeRa 96, § 2.5] or [PeRa 97, § 6]). We continue to consider 
the situation of § 8.4, assuming that /-L3 C k. Let D again be the k-algebra 
generated by l and the transformation t with t 3 = -A that we introduced in 
the first paragraph of § 4.7. Since A is a division algebra F is not reduced, 
hence D is a division algebra by Cor. 4.8.2. Eo(b) is a 3-dimensional vector 
space over l = k[a], on which t acts a-linearly by 
t(ailJ.i) = a(a)ilJ.i+1 = (iailJ.i+1, 
with b3 = det(b). This provides Eo(b) with a structure of I-dimensional vector 
space over D. 
D acts on V = El(b) as in § 4.7, which makes it a I-dimensional vector 
space over D. The opposite algebra D' acts on V' = E2(b) (see § 4.7). Since 
D' and D are anti-isomorphic by Lemma 4.7.5, E2(b) is also a I-dimensional 
vector space over D. 
Take ao = e, then Eo(b) = Dao· Pick al i= 0 in E1, then E1(b) = Dal. In 
E2(b) we take a2 = T(al)-lt(ad/\r1(al). By Lemma 8.3.1, T(a2) = T(al)-l 
and (al' a2) = 1. Further, (ti(al), a2) = 0 for i = 1,2. We now have a 
decomposition 
A = Dao EB Dal EB Da2· 
Besides the reduced norm ND, we have on D the reduced trace TD. Over the 
dual numbers k[6] (6 i= 0,62 = 0) one has 
Nk[el~hD(l + cu) = 1 + 6TD(u), 
so from Lemma 4.7.4 we get that 
TD(~o + 6t + 6 t2) = TrI/k(~O). 
Put a = T(al); then T(a2) = a- 1. 
For u = ~o + ~lt + 6t2 let u' be as in Lemma 4.7.5 and put u = ~o -
a(6)t + a2(6)t2. A tedious but straightforward calculation, using the results 
of Chapter 7, yields that for z = doao + d1al + d~a2 E A we have 
det(z) = ND(do) + aND(d1) + a- 1ND(d2) - TD(dod1d2). 
(8.12) 
This is precisely the cubic form that plays the role of det in the Freudenthal-
Tits construction, also called first Tits construction (see[PeRa 94, (14)], 
[PeRa 96, § 2.5] or [PeRa 97, § 6]). Starting with a central simple 9-dimensional 
algebra Dover k and an element a E k* the construction produces a struc-
ture of Albert algebra on DEB D EB D, whose identity element is (1,0,0) and 
whose cubic form is given by (8.12). One can verify, using Prop. 5.9.4, that 
the Albert algebra obtained from our D and a is isomorphic to A.

8. Cohomological Invariants 
8.6 Historical Notes 
The invariant of octonion algebras dealt with in § 8.2 stems from J.-P. Serre; 
see [Se 94, § 8 and§ 10.3]. The invariant mod 3 of Albert algebras in § 8.4 has 
been introduced by M. Rost [Ro], following a suggestion by Serre [Se 91]. 
H.P. Petersson and M.L. Racine gave a simpler proof for its existence 
[PeRa 96] and named it the Serre-Rost invariant. Their proof is valid in 
all characteristics except three, and in [PeRa 97] they show that with certain 
modifications their approach works in characteristic three as well. 
Our construction of the invariant of twisted octonion algebras in § 8.3 was 
inspired by the work of Petersson and Racine. It is, in fact, the Serre-Rost 
invariant in disguise. The approach to the Serre-Rost invariant via the twisted 
composition algebras, given here, works only in characteristic not two or 
three. It would be interesting to extend this to the remaining characteristics. 
What is nowadays usually called the first Tits construction is already 
found in H. Freudenthal's paper [Fr 59, § 26] for the special case that D 
is the 3 x 3 matrix algebra over the reals. This is why we use the name 
Preudenthal-Tits construction. J. Tits communicated the construction in its 
present general form and a second construction which is closely related to 
the first one to N. Jacobson, who published them in his book [Ja 68, Ch. IX, 
§ 12]
