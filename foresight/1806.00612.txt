Abstract
We demonstrate a model which captures certain
attractive features of SU(5) theory, while providing a pos-
sible escape from proton decay. In this paper we show how
ladder operators arise from the division algebras R, C, H,
and O. From the SU(n) symmetry of these ladder operators,
we then demonstrate a model which has much structural sim-
ilarity to Georgi and Glashow’s SU(5) grand uniﬁed theory.
However, in this case, the transitions leading to proton decay
are expected to be blocked, given that they coincide with
presumably forbidden transformations which would incor-
rectly mix distinct algebraic actions. As a result, we ﬁnd that
we are left with Gsm = SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.
Finally, we point out that if U(n) ladder symmetries are used
in place of SU(n), it may then be possible to ﬁnd this same
Gsm = SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6, together with an
extra U(1)X symmetry, related to B−L.
1 Introduction
From a wide range of possible theories, the standard model
has emerged almost uniquely, after having survived decades
of experimental scrutiny. And so this raises the question:
What makes SU(3)C × SU(2)L ×U(1)Y /Z6 so special? Of
the inﬁnite number of imaginable gauge groups, why this
gauge group?
Furthermore,asweknow,achoiceofgaugegroupdoesnot
imply a complete description of a theory. Even if we were to
understand why nature’s local symmetries should be given by
Gsm ≡SU(3)C×SU(2)L×U(1)Y /Z6,wewouldstillbeata
loss to explain the standard model’s particle content. Clearly,
the requirement of anomaly cancellation alone cannot go far
enough to narrow down the possibilities.
However, despite this embarrassment of riches, the stan-
dard model’s fermions are nonetheless identiﬁed with a
a e-mail: nf252@cam.ac.uk
speciﬁc choice of SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6 repre-
sentations. These are given by L = (1, 2, −1/2) for left-
handed leptons, Q = (3, 2, 1/6) for left-handed quarks, E =
(1, 1, −1) for the right-handed electron, U = (3, 1, 2/3) for
right-handed up quarks, and D = (3, 1, −1/3) for right-
handed down quarks. These irreducible representations must
then be replicated twice, so as to account for the standard
model’s three generations.
So in addition to deciphering the reasoning behind the
standard model’s curious gauge group, it is furthermore upon
us to decipher the reasoning behind its curious list of irre-
ducible representations.
Now, in 1974, H. Georgi and S. Glashow introduced one of
the ﬁrst grand uniﬁed theories, based on the 24-dimensional
gauge group SU(5). The group SU(5) is the smallest simple
Lie group to contain Gsm, admit complex representations,
accommodate the standard model’s particle content, and be
free of anomalies [1,2]. Hence, it offers perhaps the most
natural simpliﬁcation of particle physics at high energies.
More importantly, SU(5) theory does reveal at least a cou-
ple of clues about the standard model’s mysterious struc-
ture. For example, we ﬁnd that the standard model’s pecu-
liar list of hypercharges is explained when Gsm is embed-
ded into SU(5) [3,4]. Furthermore, some modern versions
of the Georgi–Glashow model have SU(5) acting on the
32-C-dimensional exterior algebra ΛC5 (as opposed to the
originally proposed 5∗and 10 irreps). The exterior algebra
ΛC5 breaks down into the 1 ⊕5 ⊕10 ⊕10∗⊕5∗⊕1 irre-
duciblerepresentationsof SU(5).Thissuccessfullycompiles
a full generation of quarks and leptons into a single object,
ΛC5, while accounting for their anti-particles, and including
a right-handed neutrino.1
However, with this being said, we note that SU(5) the-
ory does not truly explain the origin of Gsm. In the typi-
1 It should be noted that accounting for particles and anti-particles sep-
arately is generally thought of as double counting.

cal scenario, SU(5) breaks down to Gsm via spontaneous
symmetry breaking, mediated by a cleverly chosen Higgs
ﬁeld and potential. The question: Why SU(3)C × SU(2)L ×
U(1)Y /Z6? in this theory is then merely replaced by Why
SU(5)? and Why this Higgs?
To make matters worse, the extra generators of SU(5)
enable transitions which cause the proton to decay. Calcula-
tionsoftheprotonlifetimewithinminimal SU(5)theoryvary
depending on source [5], but are generally considered to be at
odds with experiment. This conﬂict was conﬁrmed recently
by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration [6,7], which thus far
has turned up no evidence in support of the proton’s decay.
As a result, minimal SU(5) theory is largely believed to be
ruled out. However, given its strengths, one might be led to
wonder if perhaps there could be some missing mathematical
structure which ultimately saves SU(5) theory from itself.
In this paper, we begin with four special algebras: the real
numbers, R, the complex numbers, C, the quaternions, H,
and the octonions, O. Uniquely, these are identiﬁed as the
only four normed division algebras over the real numbers.
They are of dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8 respectively.
Using only R, C, H, and O, we construct a faithful rep-
resentation of the Clifford algebra Cl(10), acting on a 32-
C-dimensional spinor. This 32-C-dimensional spinor is built
as a minimal left ideal, which, for our purposes, can be seen
to be equivalent to ΛC5. We then propose to identify the
model’s gauge symmetry with the special unitary symmetry
of Cl(10) ladder operators. For Cl(10), these ladder sym-
metries are identiﬁed as SU(5). Consequently, we obtain a
division algebraic representation of Georgi and Glashow’s
SU(5) model.
However, upon closer inspection, we argue that SU(5)
symmetry should never be fully realised in this division
algebraic construction. Instead, the new underlying alge-
braic structure is seen to block certain transitions under the
assumption that conceptually distinct algebraic actions do
not mix. Incidentally, these are the transitions responsible
for proton decay. In place of SU(5), we are then left with a
symmetry group given by SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.
This work builds on an early ﬁnding [8], that the octonions
break down into 1 ⊕3 ⊕3∗⊕1 irreducible representations
under SU(3) ⊂Aut(O) = G2. In their paper, Günaydin and
Gürsey identiﬁed the 3 and the 3∗as a triplet of quarks and
anti-quarks under the colour group SU(3)C.
Since that time, a number of authors have expanded on
these early results, notably [9–11]. The authors [9,10] were
able to ﬁnd signiﬁcant pieces of standard model structure by
consideringcarefullychosentensorproductsofCliffordalge-
bras, whereas [11] identiﬁed signiﬁcant pieces of standard
model structure starting from the algebra R ⊗C ⊗H ⊗O
augmented to 2×2 matrices. Readers are encouraged to con-
sult the work of these earlier authors.
This paper contributes to the existing literature by expos-
ing a rather straightforward path from R, C, H, and O to
the standard model’s gauge group, SU(3)C × SU(2)L ×
U(1)Y /Z6, with the possibility of an extra U(1)X sym-
metry, related to B −L. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the
stable subspaces (minimal ideals) of this division alge-
braic model exhibit the behaviour of one full generation
of quarks and leptons, supplemented with a right-handed
neutrino.
It is hoped that these results will be of direct use to those
currently working on grand uniﬁed theories [12–19], extra
dimensions [20–24], and non-commutative geometry [25–
29]. Furthermore, it may lend helpful clues to those work-
ing in related ﬁelds such as supersymmetry [30–36], and
other topics closely related to the division algebras [37–40].
Finally, the possibility of an extra B−L symmetry mentioned
here is particularly exciting given the recent ﬁndings of [41–
44].
2 The Georgi–Glashow model
2.1 SU(5) acting on ΛC5
The SU(5) model is perhaps the most logical choice for a
grand uniﬁed theory. With its 24 dimensions, SU(5) is the
smallest acceptable Lie group in which the 12-dimensional
Gsm can be embedded. From SU(5)’s list of irreducible
representations, Georgi and Glashow selected the 5∗and
10 so as to portray the standard model’s 15 quarks and
leptons.
Having said that, more modern versions of the theory
have since included the singlet of SU(5), which plays the
part of a sterile right-handed neutrino. These representations,
1 ⊕5∗⊕10, combine naturally into the exterior algebra
ΛC5 ∼1 ⊕5∗⊕10 ⊕10∗⊕5 ⊕1. Clearly, ΛC5 now also
includes representations corresponding to the anti-particles
of the 1 ⊕5∗⊕10 states. In Fig. 1, we depict the irreducible
representations of SU(5) within ΛC5.
Parenthetically, we mention that ΛC5 can alternately split
into two 16-C-dimensional irreducible representations under
Spin(10), for the “SO(10)” grand uniﬁed theory. In this
case, one irreducible representation corresponds to the even-
graded subspace of ΛC5, and the other corresponds to its
odd-graded subspace. Furthermore, we point out that the full
32-complex-dimensional ΛC5 provides the only irreducible
representation for the complex Clifford algebra, Cl(10).
Already at the level of SU(5) acting on ΛC5, one might
begin to suspect that the standard model’s particle content
is not entirely arbitrary. It seems too much a coincidence
to think that ΛC5 should gratuitously provide the perfect
space for one full generation, and that SU(5) should naturally
include SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.

irreducible representations. Here, the basis elements within a given
irreducible representation appear within a single row. Starting from
the bottom and moving upward, the grade-0 object, 1, forms an SU(5)
singlet, the grade-1 objects, αi, form the 5, the grade-2 objects, αiα j,
form the 10, the grade-3 objects, αiα jαk, form the 10∗, the grade-4
objects, αiα jαkαℓ, form the 5∗, and the grade-5 object, α1α2α3α4α5,
forms another singlet
2.2 Breaking SU(5)
Now with this being said, SU(5) does indeed condone proton
decay, a process thought never to have been observed. For this
reason, it is standard practice to then propose an additional
Higgs ﬁeld so as to break SU(5) →Gsm at high energy.
The typical representation chosen for this task is the 24-
dimensional adjoint Higgs [5]. Its vacuum expectation value
is then made to be proportional to the generator of U(1)Y .

2.3 SU(5) summary
In searching for a minimalistic model of particle physics, one
would be hard-pressed to surpass SU(5) acting on ΛC5. Its
particle content is concisely deﬁned, and its simple gauge
group comes as close as could be expected to that of the
standard model of particle physics.
However, compliance with experiment prompts the intro-
duction of a carefully chosen 24-dimensional Higgs ﬁeld and
potential. This breaks SU(5) →Gsm, but in the process, also
compromises the simplicity of the original model.
More troublesome still, we ﬁnd that SU(5) theory conﬂicts
with experiment, even with this adaptation. For example,
experimental lack of proton decay, lack of ’t Hooft-Polyakov
monopoles, the doublet-triplet splitting problem, and inaccu-
rate mass predictions have all taken their toll on SU(5) theory
to varying degrees [5]. However, given the virtues of SU(5)
theory, one might wonder if it could be possible to construct
a similar model which can bypass these hazards.
We will now build up a division algebraic representation
of the Georgi–Glashow model, piece by piece. Along the
way, we will encounter several group representations familiar
from particle theory. We begin with the complex quaternions,
C ⊗H.
3 C ⊗H: spin and chirality
3.1 Introduction to C ⊗H
A generic element of C ⊗H is written c0ϵ0 + c1ϵ1 +
c2ϵ2 + c3ϵ3, where the ci ∈C and ϵ0 ≡1. The basis vec-
tors ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3 follow the associative, but non-commutative
quaternionic multiplication rules
ϵ1ϵ1 = ϵ2ϵ2 = ϵ3ϵ3 = ϵ1ϵ2ϵ3 = −1,
(4)
from which we obtain ϵ1ϵ2 = −ϵ2ϵ1 = ϵ3, ϵ2ϵ3 = −ϵ3ϵ2 =
ϵ1, ϵ3ϵ1 = −ϵ1ϵ3 = ϵ2.
We deﬁne two notions of conjugation on an element
a ∈C ⊗H. The complex conjugate of a, denoted a∗, maps
the complex i to −i. That which we will call the hermitian
conjugate of a, denoted a†, maps i to −i and ϵ j to −ϵ j
for j = 1, 2, 3, while reversing the order of multiplication,
(ab)† = b†a†.
A well-known correspondence exists between the com-
plex quarternions and the Pauli matrices. That is,
iϵ1 ↔σx,
iϵ2 ↔σy,
iϵ3 ↔σz.

Fig. 2 The 4-complex-dimensional C ⊗H gives a faithful represen-
tation of Cl(2). The pair of vectors, iϵ1 and iϵ2, form the generating
space (1-vectors) of the Clifford algebra, and ϵ3 = ϵ1ϵ2 is a bi-vector
However, readers should note that these objects behave more
symmetrically than do the Pauli matrices under complex con-
jugation. Explicitly, (iϵ j)∗= −iϵ j ∀j versus σx ∗= + σx,
σy∗= −σy, σz∗= + σz.
3.2 Clifford algebraic structure
It is straightforward to conﬁrm that the left action of C⊗H on
itself gives a faithful representation of the complex Clifford
algebra Cl(2). Please see Fig. 2. Here the generating vectors
iϵ1 and iϵ2 obey {iϵm, iϵn} = 2δmn for m = 1, 2 and n =
1, 2.
Now, the generating space given in Fig. 2 may be rewritten
in terms of a new basis,
α ≡1
2 (ϵ2 + iϵ1) ,
α† ≡1
2 (−ϵ2 + iϵ1) .
(6)
Under anti-commutation, these operators behave as
{α, α} = {α†, α†} = 0,
{α, α†} = 1.
(7)
Since α and α† span the Clifford algebra’s generating space,
we then see that all of C ⊗H ≃Cl(2) may be described as
sums and multiples of these ladder operators.
3.3 Right-handed Weyl spinors as minimal left ideals
The Clifford algebraic structure of C ⊗H is important for
us since it will allow us to construct Weyl spinors. That is,
we will make use of the fact that spinors can be deﬁned as
minimal left ideals of Clifford algebras [45].
Given an algebra, A, a left ideal, B, is a subalgebra of A
whereby ab is in B for all b in B, and for any a in A. Said
another way, the subspace B is stable under left multiplica-
tion by any of the elements a ∈A. Now, a minimal left ideal
is a left ideal which contains no left ideals other than {0} and
itself. (This choice of deﬁnition for spinors was motivated
by the algebraic path integral model described in Chapter 2
of [46], where particles are identiﬁed as surviving subspaces
of some fundamental algebra.)
We will now construct spinors as minimal left ideals,
largely following the procedure set out in [45] for Clifford
algebras Cl(2n) with n ∈Z > 0. In this construction, the
ﬁrst task is to build a particular idempotent, v = vv. Then
the spinor is obtained by simply left multiplying Cl(2n) onto
v, as in Ψ ≡Cl(2n)v.
In our current case of Cl(2), our idempotent will be
deﬁned as vs ≡αα†, where the subscript s refers to spin.
For generic Cl(2n), the Clifford algebra’s generating space
will be split into n operators αi and n operators α†
i . In this
more general case, the idempotent v will be constructed as
v ≡α1α2 . . . αnα†
n . . . α†
2α†
1.
For C⊗H ≃Cl(2), readers may conﬁrm that the resulting
minimal left ideal Cl(2)vs takes the form
ΨR ≡ψ↑
Rα†vs + ψ↓
Rvs,
(8)
where ψ↑
R and ψ↓
R are complex coefﬁcients. Here, we have
labelled the basis vector α†vs as spin-up since 1
2iϵ3α†vs =
1
2α†vs, and we have labelled vs as spin-down since 1
2iϵ3vs =
−1
2vs. We have furthermore labeled the spinor ΨR as right-
handed, which may be viewed as an arbitrary choice at this
point.
Readers may notice the resemblance between ΨR and a
Fock space, where vs formally plays the role of a vacuum
state.
3.4 Left-handed Weyl spinors as minimal left ideals
Incidentally, another spinor may be constructed in Cl(2) by
swapping the roles of α and α†. In this case, let us then deﬁne
v′
s ≡α†α. When expressed in terms of C ⊗H, it so happens
that v′
s is given by v′
s = v∗
s . From here, we can construct a
minimal left ideal, linearly independent from the ﬁrst.
ΨL ≡ψ↑
Lv∗
s + ψ↓
Lαv∗
s ,
(9)
where ψ↑
L and ψ↓
L are complex coefﬁcients.
The identiﬁcation of ΨL and ΨR as left- and right-handed
Weyl spinors is justiﬁed when we take γ5 to be represented as
right multiplication by −iϵ3 as shown in Section 4.7 of [46].
Furthermore, in Chapter 3 of [46], ΨL is shown to transform
as does a left-handed Weyl spinor under SL(2, C), Ψ ′
L =
LΨL, and ΨR is shown to transform as does a right-handed
Weyl spinor, Ψ ′
R = L∗ΨR. Here, L ∈C ⊗H is deﬁned as
L ≡exp (r jϵ j + b jiϵ j), where j = 1, 2, 3, and r j, b j ∈R.
Putting both subspaces together, we may deﬁne Dirac
spinors as ΨD ≡ΨL + ΨR. When translated into the for-
malism of 2 × 2 C matrices via relations (5), this gives
ΨD →


(10)
so that each Weyl spinor occupies a column within the 2×2 C
matrices. Multiplying from the left induces rotations between

Page 5 of 12
 375 
spin states, while multiplication from the right induces rota-
tion between chiralities.
In this paper, we will sometimes alternate between matrix
descriptions and division algebraic descriptions of our states.
Having said that, readers should take note that not all descrip-
tions are created equal. After all, it is the division algebras,
not the matrix algebras, which ultimately dictate which Clif-
ford algebras we will consider. Also, the familiar operation of
charge conjugation ﬁnds a more succinct description within
this division algebraic formalism, as we will now show.
3.5 Complex conjugation and charge conjugation
To give a basis for comparison, let us ﬁrst consider the Dirac
spinor, as described by 2 × 2 C matrices in relation (10).
Undertheactionofcomplexconjugation,i →−i,wesimply
conjugate the four complex coefﬁcients, a procedure which
does not lead to anything of particular signiﬁcance.
In contrast, let us now apply the map i →−i to ΨD when
it is described in terms of C ⊗H,

(11)
This transformation may be recognizable to readers as ψ →
ψc = −iγ2ψ∗from the standard formalism of quantum ﬁeld
theory (up to a phase). In other words, i →−i in the C ⊗H
formalism yields charge conjugation on Dirac spinors.
In this light, we may see that the role of iγ2 in the standard
formalism is to take into account the complex conjugation of
basis vectors in the C ⊗H formalism. When spinors are
written in terms of C ⊗H, the object iγ2 need no longer be
put in by hand.
3.6 Dirac algebra
The Weyl spinors ΨL and ΨR were each constructed as min-
imal ideals of C ⊗H, under left multiplication. However,
transitions between ΨL and ΨR can be effected via right mul-
tiplication. This right action provides another faithful repre-
sentation of Cl(2).

(12)
Hence the combined action of both left and right multiplica-
tion gives Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(4). From these actions, we
may construct the C ⊗H-equivalent of the Dirac matrices.
Generators of the Dirac algebra in the Weyl basis may be
described as
γ 0 = 1|iϵ1
γ 1 = iϵ1|ϵ2
γ 2 = iϵ2|ϵ2
γ 3 = iϵ3|ϵ2,
(13)
as introduced in Section 4.7 of [46]. Here, we made use of the
bar notation of [47]. By deﬁnition, the operator x|y acting
on some element z, for x, y, z ∈C ⊗H, is given by xzy.
We end this section by pointing out that C ⊗H is capable
of describing more than just Weyl and Dirac spinors. This
4-C-dimensional algebra was shown in [46] to also describe
Majorana spinors, scalars, four-vectors, and the ﬁeld strength
tensor - each in the form of generalized ideals. By generalized
ideals, we mean invariant subspaces under some action of
the algebra on itself. These account for all of the Lorentz
representations of the standard model.
For a recent electromagnetic model which builds on this
formalism, see [48].
3.7 C ⊗H summary
In this section, we showed that the left action of C ⊗H on
itself gives a faithful representation of the Clifford algebra
Cl(2). We then identiﬁed anti-commuting ladder operators
generating Cl(2), and used them to build a pair of minimal
left ideals, ΨL and ΨR. These two Weyl spinors may then be
combined as ΨD = ΨL +ΨR so as to give a single irreducible
representation when both the left and right actions of C ⊗H
are considered. This results in a faithful representation of
Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(4) ≃C ⊗Cl(1, 3). In short, C ⊗
H lends itself naturally to the description of those spinors
familiar to 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions.
4 C ⊗O: colour
We will now repeat this construction for the case of the com-
plex octonions. In analogy to the C ⊗H minimal left ide-
als ΨL + ΨR, we will construct C ⊗O minimal left ideals,
Su + Sd. Subsequently, we will ﬁnd that Su and Sd mirror
the behaviour of one generation of quarks and leptons under
SU(3)C.
4.1 Introduction to C ⊗O
A generic element of C⊗O is written 
7

,
apart from e0 ≡1. The multiplication rules for these imag-
inary units can be deﬁned by setting e1e2 = e4, and then
applying the following rules,

eie j = −e jei
i ̸= j,
eie j = ek
⇒
ei+1e j+1 = ek+1,
eie j = ek
⇒
e2ie2 j = e2k.
(14)
Alternately, readers may consult [46,49], or [50], where the
given Fano plane depicts these same multiplication rules. The
octonions form a non-associative algebra, meaning that the
relation (ab)c = a(bc) does not always hold. Octonionic
automorphisms are given by G2, the 14-dimensional excep-
tional Lie group.
4.2 Clifford algebraic structure
In parallel with the case of C ⊗H, we will now consider the
left action of C ⊗O on itself. It can be conﬁrmed that com-
plex linear combinations of octonions repeatedly left multi-
plying f ∈C ⊗O may always be written in the canonical
form
M f ≡c0 f +

where the coefﬁcients c0, ci, . . . ∈C. Readers may note that
the octonionic imaginary unit e7 is not explicitly expressed
in these maps. This is due to the fact that
e7 f = e1(e2(e3(e4(e5(e6 f )))))
∀f ∈C ⊗O,
(16)
thereby making e7 redundant as a left-action map. Of course,
e7 itself holds no preferred status within the octonions, and
the space of left-action maps may equivalently be described
by chains built from any six of the seven imaginary units.
By using the identity (16), the Eq. (15) may then be written

Fig. 3 The left action of C ⊗O on itself provides a faithful repre-
sentation of Cl(6), and is hence isomorphic to the 8 × 8 C matrices.
Here, left-action maps, i←−
e j , for j = 1, . . . 6, form the generating space
(1-vectors)
for i, j = 1, . . . 6, and ∀f ∈C⊗O, and furthermore that the
left action of C ⊗O on itself gives a faithful representation
of the Clifford algebra Cl(6). Please see Fig. 3. Here, multi-
plication is understood to be given by the composition of left
action maps, and hence is associative by deﬁnition. The Clif-
ford algebra Cl(6) is isomorphic to the 8×8 C matrices. This
scenario closely emulates our earlier example where the left
action of C⊗H on itself gave a faithful representation of the
Clifford algebra Cl(2), isomorphic to the 2 × 2 C matrices.
Now, the generating space given in Fig. 3 may be rewritten
in terms of a new basis,

Here, we deﬁne the conjugation † to map i →−i and ←−
e j →

e j for j = 1 . . . 7. As with the hermitian conjugation of
matrices, † also reverses the order of multiplication, that is,
the order of left action maps: (←−
x ←−y )† = ←−y †←−
x †.
Under anti-commutation, these operators behave as
{←−

{←−

which is simply a higher-dimensional analogue of equa-
tions (7).
From this point forward, we will not be interested in the
object f ∈C⊗O, only the maps ←−
ai and ←−
a j † which act on it.
Hence, we will no longer refer to f explicitly. Furthermore,
in the interest of simplifying notation, we will forfeit the use

of arrows on our left action maps, although their presence
should be implicitly understood. Equations (20) can then be
rewritten more succinctly as
{ai, a j} = 0,
{a†
i , a†
j} = 0,
{ai, a†
j} = δi j.

4.3 Quarks and leptons as minimal left ideals
Now that we have established Clifford algebraic structure
generated by C ⊗O, we would like to build minimal left
ideals analogous to ΨL and ΨR. Again following [45], let
us deﬁne ω ≡a1a2a3 so that our idempotent is then given
by vc ≡ωω†. Our ﬁrst minimal left ideal will be given by
Su ≡Cl(6)vc,
Su

where V, ¯Dr, . . . E+ are 8 suggestively named complex coef-
ﬁcients.

(23)
where ¯V, Dr, . . . E−are eight complex coefﬁcients. The one-
generation labeling we have used in Su and Sd will be par-
tially justiﬁed now, and fully justiﬁed by the end of this arti-
cle.
4.4 SU(3) ladder symmetry
Let us now consider an SU(3) symmetry acting on the ladder
operators, a1, a2, a3. Takingr j ∈R, our raising and lowering
operators transform as
eir jΛ j ake−ir jΛ j
and
eir jΛ j a†
ke−ir jΛ j ,
(24)
where the eight Λ j span su(3), and are given by
Λ1 = −a†

Λ2 = ia†
2a1 −ia†

.
(25)
This representation of SU(3) is given by the subgroup of G2
which holds the octonionic e7 constant.
Given that our minimal left ideals are built entirely out of
ladder operators, we see that transformations on ai and a†
j
thereby induce transformations on Su and Sd. Under SU(3),
Su and Sd are found to transform as
Su ∼1 ⊕3∗⊕3 ⊕1,
Sd ∼1 ⊕3 ⊕3∗⊕1.
(26)
Extending this SU(3) symmetry to U(3) = SU(3) ×
U(1)/Z3 gives an additional U(1) generator, which can be
found to coincide with electric charge. This U(1)em sym-
metry is generated by the number operator for the system,
thereby providing an unusually straightforward explanation
of charge quantization. Details may be found in [50].
Finally,readersareencouragedtoverifythatcomplexcon-
jugation, i →−i, sends particles to anti-particles, Su ↔Sd.
This parallels our earlier ﬁndings for C ⊗H where i →−i
similarly gave ΨL ↔ΨR.
4.5 Minimal left ideals in the matrix formalism
For those more comfortable with the language of matrices,
we point out that Su and Sd may be formulated as
Su + Sd →
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
V 0 0 0 0 0 0 E−
¯Dr 0 0 0 0 0 0 ¯Ur
¯Dg 0 0 0 0 0 0 ¯U g

Ub 0 0 0 0 0 0 Db
E+ 0 0 0 0 0 0
¯V
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
(27)
Written in this way, it becomes obvious that there are in fact
eight linearly independent minimal left ideals which can be
built within Cl(6). Readers interested in ﬁnding additional
generations of quarks and leptons within Cl(6) should con-
sult [49], Section 9.6 of [46] and [51].
For an interesting proposal connecting this one-generation
model to braids, see [52].
4.6 Towards weak isospin
As with the example of ΨL and ΨR, the two minimal left ide-
als Su and Sd may be transformed into each other under right
multiplication. However, this time, it is the ladder operators
ω and ω† which effect these transitions, generating another
123

copy of Cl(2). Taking the sum, S16 ≡Su + Sd, we then have
a faithful representation of Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2),

isospin type.
(28)
As Cl(6) operators acting on f ∈C ⊗O, schematically, we
have Suωf ∼Sd f and Sdω† f ∼Su f.
These two ladder operators, ω and ω†, can be seen to
induce transitions between isospin pairs, eg V and E−, Ur
and Dr, etc. However, this description of weak isospin is
clearly not complete in that there is nothing at this stage to
indicate that these objects should act on only left-handed
states. This will be addressed in the next section.
Before moving on, it should be noted that earlier papers
have been found which have much in common with the octo-
nionic model presented here. In 1973, Günaydin and Gürsey
found the SU(3)C structure for a triplet of quarks and anti-
quarks using the split octonions [8]. Subsequently in 1977,
Barducci et al. [9], built a one-generation model of quarks
and leptons from [8], based on Cl(6) and Cl(2). The main
differences between the model presented here and [9] lie
in the way that particles and anti-particles are related, and
in how transitions between isospin states occur. Because of
our use of octonionic minimal left ideals, particles and anti-
particles are related here simply by i →−i. Furthermore,
as we have constructed our quark and lepton states within
the space of octonionic maps, not as column vectors, we
may then ﬁnd objects ω and ω† which automatically have
the correct electric charges, without having to implement
these characteristics by hand. Finally, in the case of U(1)em,
we ﬁnd that electric charge is proportional to the number
operator for the system, as opposed to being given by a dif-
ference between number operators of two distinct Clifford
algebras.
4.7 C ⊗O summary
In this section, we showed that the left action of C ⊗O on
itself gives a faithful representation of the Clifford algebra
Cl(6). We then identiﬁed anti-commuting ladder operators
generating Cl(6), and used them to build a pair of minimal
left ideals, Su and Sd. Under SU(3) ladder symmetry, these
ideals were found to transform as do the quarks and lep-
tons of one generation of standard model particles. When
this SU(3) symmetry is further extended to U(3), we then
ﬁnd an additional U(1) factor, generated by electric charge
[50]. Combining Su with Sd then provided a faithful rep-
resentation of Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(2), where the additional Cl(2)
factor enables transitions between isospin up- and down-type
states.
5 Cl(4): weak isospin
Readers are encouraged to also see a closely related model
by Woit [31], which addresses weak isospin in the context
of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. For a recent review
article on Cl(4) and electroweak theory, see [53].
5.1 Clifford algebraic structure
We will now draw the reader’s attention to the right action
on ΨL + ΨR, and the right action on Su + Sd, which each
generated a copy of Cl(2). Recall that the right action on
ΨL + ΨR induced transitions between chiralities L and R,
while the right action on Su +Sd induced transitions between
isospin up- and down-type states. Together, these two Cl(2)
right actions form Cl(2) ⊗C Cl(2) ≃Cl(4). Readers should
note that this Cl(4) is conceptually distinct from what we
have seen before, in that it effects transitions on the space of
idempotents.
Nonetheless, we will now work through the same con-
struction with Cl(4) as we did in previous sections. Genera-
tors of this Cl(4) may be carefully chosen as
{τ1iϵ1, τ2iϵ1, τ3iϵ1, iϵ2},
(29)
where τ1 ≡ω + ω†, τ2 ≡iω −iω†, τ3 ≡ωω† −ω†ω.
It should be noted at this point that the behaviour of our
generators (29) under complex conjugation differs from that
of previous sections.
As before, these generators may be rewritten in a new
basis given by {β1, β2, β‡
1, β‡
2} where
β1 ≡1
2 (−ϵ2 + iϵ1τ3) , β2 ≡ω†iϵ1.
(30)
Here, ‡ maps i →−i, ϵ j →−ϵ j for j = 1, 2, 3, and
ek →−ek for k = 1, . . . 7, while reversing the order of
multiplication. It is then not difﬁcult to conﬁrm that
{βi, β j} = {β‡
i , β‡
j } = 0,
{βi, β‡
j } = δi j,
(31)
∀i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2.

(33)
The bars over top of the variables here, as in ¯L and ¯VL,
are meant only to identify anti-particles; they do not imply
hermitian conjugation and multiplication by γ 0.
It should be noted that in this particular Cl(4) construc-
tion (29), swapping βi ↔β‡
i provided a new minimal right
ideal, γ 0 ¯L, which automatically includes a factor of γ 0. This
additional γ 0 will be familiar from QFT kinetic terms of the
form ψ†γ 0γ μ∂μψ.
5.3 SU(2) ladder symmetry
In parallel with the previous section, SU(2) symmetries may
now be applied to our ladder operators as
e−ir j Tj βkeir j Tj
and
e−ir j Tj β‡
k eir j Tj .
(34)
The three Tj generate SU(2), and are found to be
T1 ≡τ1
1
2(1+iϵ3),
T2 ≡τ2
1
2(1+iϵ3),
T3 ≡τ3
1
2(1+iϵ3).
(35)
As before, transformations on the ladder operators induce
transformations on our minimal right ideals. So we then ﬁnd
that under SU(2), the ideals L and γ 0 ¯L transform as
L ∼1 ⊕2 ⊕1,
γ 0 ¯L ∼1 ⊕2 ⊕1.
(36)
These transformation properties agree with the leptonic iden-
tiﬁcations we made in Eqs. (32) and (33), which will be fur-
ther justiﬁed in the next section.
So here we have again found standard model group repre-
sentations by taking the special unitary symmetries of our
ladder operators, and examining the transformations they
induce on minimal one-sided ideals. In this case, we have
found the behaviour of leptons under SU(2)L. It is worth
emphasizing here that when the SU(2) symmetry of these
ladder operators was applied to minimal right ideals, it acted
automatically on states of only a single chirality. We did not
need to implement a projector by hand. Please see Fig. 4.
Finally, we point out that if a U(2) ladder symmetry is
taken in place of SU(2), then we ﬁnd an extra U(1) charge,
given that U(2) = SU(2) × U(1)/Z2. This U(1) is again
generated by the system’s number operator, and in this case,
coincides with weak hypercharge [46,53].
Fig. 4 The leptonic minimal right ideal L. As with our previous exam-
ples, this ideal resembles a Fock space, with the right-handed neutrino
acting as the (formal) vacuum state. It should be noted that the SU(2)
symmetries of our ladder operators are found to act automatically on
lepton states of only a single chirality. That is, without the need to
impose a chiral projector by hand
5.4 Cl(4) summary
In this section, we focussed in on a representation of Cl(4)
which induces transitions of isospin and chirality idempo-
tents. We identiﬁed a particular set of anti-commuting ladder
operators generating Cl(4), and used it to build a pair of min-
imal right ideals, L and γ 0 ¯L. Under the SU(2) symmetry of
these ladder operators, the ideals were found to transform as
do the leptons of one generation of standard model particles,
together with a right-handed neutrino. Here, the group SU(2)
was found to act automatically on states of only a single chi-
rality. Finally, when a U(2) ladder symmetry was used in
place of SU(2), we then found an additional U(1) generator
with eigenvalues consistent with weak hypercharge.
6 All together: ladder symmetries to
SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y/Z6
We have just come from ﬁnding familiar standard model par-
ticle representations by considering the action of division
algebras on themselves. That is, the special unitary symme-
tries of division algebraic ladder operators led to SU(3)C and
SU(2)L when acting on minimal one-sided ideals. Our goal
now is to combine these fragments into a single model.
6.1 Clifford algebraic structure
It is well known that the Clifford algebra Cl(10) can pro-
vide the background structure for Spin(10) and SU(5) grand
uniﬁed theories [4]. We will then use our division algebraic
actions from previous sections to build a representation of
Cl(6) ⊗C Cl(4) ≃Cl(10).
Making use of equations (19) and (30), let us deﬁne ten
ladder operators to be
123

where I represents the identity. Given Eqs. (21) and (31), it is
trivial to conﬁrm that these obey the usual anti-commutation
relations.
Readers should note that from the perspective of the Clif-
ford algebra alone, there is no real distinction between the
Ai operators and the B j operators. However the same cannot
be said when the Ai and B j operators are realised in terms
of division algebras, as they were in this article. That is, the
B j may be considered as truly distinct from the Ai, in that
the B j were introduced so as to effect transitions between
idempotents. Said another way, the Ai can be seen to map a
left ideal to itself, whereas the B j were introduced so as to
map one ideal to another.

(39)
As with γ 0 ¯L of Eq. (33), the antiparticles within S can be
seen to include a factor of γ 0 automatically. The complex
coefﬁcients, VR, ¯Di
L, . . ., are written here so as to anticipate
how these states will eventually transform under SU(3)C ×
SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6 ⊂SU(5).
As before, this minimal left ideal exhibits the structure
of a Fock space. Readers may also notice that removing the
idempotent vt from these states leaves us with the exterior
algebra ΛC5, as described in [4].
6.3 From SU(5) ladder symmetry to
SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6
It is straightforward to see that the special unitary transforma-
tions on Cl(10) ladder operators give SU(5). These SU(5)
laddersymmetriesfurtherinducetransformationsonthemin-
imal left ideal (39). Readers are encouraged to conﬁrm that
the action of SU(5) on (39) coincides exactly with the SU(5)
transformations of particles and anti-particles in the Georgi–
Glashow model.
In total, there are 24 generators of SU(5) ladder symme-
tries, which split into two types. The ﬁrst type of generator
mixes A- and B-type ladder operators. These will be known
as mixing generators, and can be written using the hermitian
forms
A‡
j Bk + B‡
k A j
and
i A‡
j Bk −i B‡
k A j.
(40)
Since j runs from 1 to 3 and k runs from 1 to 2, we ﬁnd 12
generators of this ﬁrst type.
Now, as far as the Clifford algebra Cl(10) is concerned,
we have no reason to exclude these generators from con-
sideration. However, from the perspective of our division
algebraic construction, A- and B-type ladder operators are
clearly algebraically distinct. We will then exclude these 12
elements from this model. Incidentally, it is precisely this
ﬁrst type of generator which is responsible for proton decay.
The second type of generator does not mix A- and B-
type ladder operators. In total, there are 12 such generators
remaining. The ﬁrst eight are given by
Λ1|I = −A‡

which can be seen to generate SU(3)C when applied to the
minimal left ideal (39). Here, the Λ j are deﬁned as in equa-
tion (25). The next three generators are given by

I|T2 = i B‡
2 B1 −i B‡

which generate SU(2)L when applied to (39). Here, the Tj
are deﬁned as in equation (35). Finally, the twelfth generator
is realised as

and can be seen to assign charges to (39) which coincide with
hypercharge, Y.
Hence, we have found that it is exactly the non-mixing
SU(5) ladder symmetries which generate the standard mo-
del’s gauge group, SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.
Finally, as with previous cases, we may consider U(5) =
SU(5) ×U(1)/Z5 ladder symmetries, as opposed to SU(5).
This again introduces an extra U(1) generator, proportional
to the number operator. Up to an overall phase, this number
operator,

6.4 Summary
In this section, we combined our previous Cl(4) and Cl(6)
results so as to yield a division algebraic representation of
Cl(10). From Cl(10) ladder operators, we constructed a 32-
C-dimensional minimal left ideal. Then, under special uni-
tary ladder symmetries, this minimal left ideal was found to
transform as do the particles and anti-particles of the SU(5)
Georgi–Glashow grand uniﬁed theory.
Finally, under the requirement that A- and B-type division
algebraic actions be kept distinct, we ﬁnd that the SU(5)
ladder symmetries then reduce immediately to SU(3)C ×
SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.
Making use of the fullU(5) symmetry leads us to the same
result, but introduces the possibility of an extra (presumably
gauged) U(1)X.
7 Outlook
Wehavecomefromdemonstratinghowfourlow-dimensional
algebras: R (1D), C (2D), H (4D), and O (8D), can act on
themselvessoastoyieldgrouprepresentationsoftheGeorgi–
Glashow model. Here, the group SU(5) arises as symmetries
of Clifford algebraic ladder operators. We point out, though,
that only half of these SU(5) generators preserve the under-
lying algebraic structure. Perhaps unexpectedly, we ﬁnd that
it is precisely this subset which generates the standard model
gauge group, Gsm = SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y /Z6.
It bears mentioning that the reduction of SU(5) →
SU(3)C × SU(2)L ×U(1)Y /Z6 has not been mediated here
by a Higgs boson. Instead, we emphasize that the full SU(5)
symmetry should never be fully realised in this division alge-
braic model in the ﬁrst place.
Finally, we point out one last avenue worth investiga-
tion. Readers may have noticed that with the introduction
of ω ≡a1a2a3, and ω† = a†
3a†
2a†
1, we were able to
show that sequences of complex octonions can behave as
Cl(2) ≃C ⊗H. In other words, new algebraic behaviour
can arise at different chain lengths of the original algebra
(length three in this case).
This algebraic phenomenon bears resemblance to the
emergence of effective theories in physics at different energy
scales. We might then ask if collective algebraic behaviour
might ultimately be used to address currently unexplained
physical phenomena, such as colour conﬁnement.
